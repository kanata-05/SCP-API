When instances of SCP-4730 are located, Mobile Task Force Nu-2 (\"Save the Clowns!\") are to be dispatched, and are to dismantle the anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-4730-A specimens are to be tracked and guarded. Unauthorized personnel discovering SCP-4730-A specimens are to be given proper amnestics.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4730 designates the manifestation of clown cars in sparsely inhabited regions. It manifests around areas with sizable \ncorydon\n1\n populations (designated SCP-4730-A). SCP-4730 seems to have also been repurposed, with various parts not commonly seen in clown cars.\n\n\nSCP-4730 will manifest within range of SCP-4730-A, to which it will respond by inspecting the vehicle. SCP-4730 will wait for large instances of SCP-4730-A to enter, before locking the instances inside and preventing escape.\n\n\nAfterwards, two unidentified entities (SCP-4730-1 and -2) will arrive and remove SCP-4730 from the area, disappearing along with it.\n\n\nAccording to information from PoI-90958, non-anomalous versions of SCP-4730 are popular toys for domesticated SCP-4730-A specimens. SCP-4730-A specimens seem to enjoy being inside the vehicle and will keep entering until it is full, unaware of its properties. It is unknown where SCP-4730-A instances are brought after being captured.\n\n\nAddendum 4730.58\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [PoI-90958 \u2018\nBambousio Starswinger\n\u2019]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [Junior Researcher Cosmo Aston]\n\n\nForeword:\n \n[The following is an interview conducted with PoI-90958 to obtain further information on the anomaly. PoI-90958 agreed to cooperate with the Foundation, as he mentioned his disdain towards SCP-4730-1 and -2 instances.]\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAston:\n Good afternoon, PoI-90958. I appreciate your cooperation with us.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n It\u2019s Mr. Starswinger. And yeah, anything to get those cursed poachers away from the precious wild clown populations.\n\n\n\n\nAston:\n Um, can you elaborate on that?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Didn\u2019t you read through my blog? I\u2019m saying there\u2019s illegal hunting of wild clowns-\n\n\nAston:\n That. Are they people dressed as clowns or\u2026can you repeat that?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n What? No! Who does that? Nobody dresses up as clowns, that\u2019s weird. That\u2019s like\u2026I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the word\u2026\n\n\nPoI-90958 quickly snaps his fingers.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Furries! A teenager commented that on one of my posts. I don\u2019t know what that is, though. Anyway, these are wild clowns being kidnapped by illegal poachers, being sold off on the black market to various places.\n\n\nAston:\n Interesting. Do you know anything on how the cars and poachers manifest?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n They use what everyone uses, Time Clowns. It\u2019s disgusting, I hate their exploitation of the breed. They\u2019re probably not even properly taken care of. They use the Time Clowns and probably some other temporal clown breeds to make portals in and out of this dimension. It happens with entire locations, too.\n\n\nPoI-90958 deeply sighs.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Time Clowns. Bane of my existence.\n\n\nAston:\n That is a whole string of coherent words that sure don\u2019t make sense as sentences. So you\u2019re saying the poachers use the um\u2026\u2018Time Clowns\u2019 to transport the specimens to secondary locations?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n I\u2019m saying that wild clowns don\u2019t have proper protection! So you have laws for other species but not clowns, like we don\u2019t notice, hah! Clowns are just as important as your \u2018elephants\u2019 or \u2018rhinos\u2019, yet I don\u2019t see any patrolling for wild clown herds or laws against poaching them! While I get the general public may not know about the clowns, we still need them for the people who do know. It's a small world. You see, this is why I do what I do, because-\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]\n\n\nAston:\n That was lovely, Mr. Starswinger. Do you have any idea as to where the clowns are taken after being captured?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n I sure do. Either the circuses or the ranches. Neither provides a better fate.\n\n\nAston:\n Okay\u2026That will be all for now. Thank you very much, Mr. Starswinger.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n It\u2019s my pleasure. You better catch those bastards, by the way.\n\n\nAston:\n We\u2019ll do what we can.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n \nAddresses suspected to contain missing SCP-4730-A specimens were given by PoI-90958, on the condition the offenders would be reprimanded in some manner. PoI-90958\u2019s blog remains open to known members of the \u2018clown husbandry\u2019 community, but will be hidden from the public, as the existence of domesticated clowns is unknown to the non-anomalous community.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4730.59\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-2 arrived at the given coordinates of one of the suspected areas.\n\n\nUpon arrival, it was noted as a normal abandoned meat processing plant. During inspection there was nothing explicitly out of the ordinary nor anomalous. However, there were a log of items retrieved:\n\n\n\n\nA chunk of multicoloured hair.\n\n\nA red ball, with a gelatinous substance inside.\n\n\nA tape recording of a promotional video for \u2018\nClowning about Ranches\n'\n\n\nA small scrap of unidentified meat, analysis shows it to have some similarities to chicken.\n\n\nA torn document logging various purchases and sales.\n\n\n\n\nBehind the plant was also the outline of connected rooms, and one of the doors of the plant opened to the outside.\n\n\nAddendum 4730.60\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [PoI-90958 \u2018Bambousio Starswinger\u2019]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [Junior Researcher Cosmo Aston]\n\n\nForeword:\n \n[The following is an interview conducted after the exploration of one of the given coordinates from PoI-90958.]\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nAston:\n Do you recognise any of these items?\n\n\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Oh, oh my god, why would you show me this?!\n\n\nAston:\n So you recognise them?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n These are clown parts. You\u2019re showing me dead clown parts.\n\n\nAston:\n What a shame. When the task force arrived at the location, there was no sign of recent activity, except imprints of rooms in the field behind it. I\u2019m guessing this is, as you use as an excuse for everything, \u2018Time Clowns\u2019?\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n That sounds like the ranch. They\u2019re sneaky. They wouldn\u2019t have suspected the Foundation to sniff them out, though. The owner\u2019s not that discrete.\n\n\nAston:\n The video was a gem to find for us. Showed us a lot about 'clowns' while we practically knew nothing. I knew already, actually.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Are you familiar with clowns already?\n\n\nAston:\n \u2026Nope! I watched the tape beforehand. I had my theories, though\u2026\n\n\nAston:\n Judging by the amount of objects left over, I doubt they thoroughly cover their tracks. The documents are a real find.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n How so?\n\n\nAston:\n Well, you\u2019re on it, for one. \u2018Bambousio Starswinger: 2 Pierrots\u2019\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n What? That can\u2019t be true. I had bought them from a known and genuine breeder, you liar!\n\n\nAston:\n No, it\u2019s right here, see? I guess they weren\u2019t as genuine as you thought.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n My god. The whole entire system\u2019s fucking corrupt, isn\u2019t it\u2026\n\n\nPoI-90958 is seen putting his head in his hands.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n That makes no sense as to how Clowning About Ranches was able to disappear before you came along, though.\n\n\nAston:\n All information given to the Foundation is classified. I doubt it.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Exactly. You must have a clown in your ranks.\n\n\n\n\nAston:\n What? Do you mean a rat?\n\n\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n No, I mean a clown.\n\n\nPoI-90958 is then seen grabbing Researcher Aston\u2019s wrist, before quickly rubbing the side of his hand. PoI-90958 lets go, showing residue white greasepaint on his hand to Researcher Aston.\n\n\nPoI-90958:\n Did you not think I would notice?\n\n\nAston:\n \u2026That will be all, thank you.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n \nQuickly after, PoI-90958 was forcibly removed from the room. During the commotion, Junior Researcher Cosmo Aston was seen leaving the premises with a brightly coloured unidentified entity, and the two seemingly vanished before they were caught.
