Subject vocalized \"Fuck off, Carl!\" prior to SCP-3213 being removed from the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3213\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-3213 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell on floor 20 of Site-88. Under no circumstances is SCP-3213 to be allowed unsupervised interaction with any member of any pinniped species (pinniped families include, but are not limited to, walruses, seals, and sea lions). Testing of SCP-3213's effects is to take place in the aquatic facilities on floor 21 of Site-88.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3213 is a 44-year-old human male named Carl Prosser. When SCP-3213 is in the direct line of sight of any member of any pinniped species, the animal will become sapient and capable of vocalization. SCP-3213-affected animals will then utilize this capability to direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213.\n\n\nAffected animals appear to possess individual personalities and behaviors, though all share a common dislike of SCP-3213. Affected animals either do not comprehend, or do not care to respond, to any verbal requests from individuals who are not SCP-3213. Repeated interactions between SCP-3213 and affected animals has yielded no verifiable information relating to the cause of the anomaly.\n\n\nWhen in the presence of pinnipeds, SCP-3213 is under constant danger of physical attack. Affected animals will attempt to inflict as much physical pain as possible on SCP-3213, although multiple tests in controlled settings have revealed that these attacks will cease if SCP-3213's life is in danger. All attacking animals will continue direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213 until removed from SCP-3213's presence.\n\n\nSCP-3213-affected animals do not appear to retain their sapience or ability to vocalize once out of direct line of sight of SCP-3213. Examination of live, actively affected specimens has been unsuccessful due to their aggression. SCP-3213 has, however, been cooperative in continued testing of the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nTest 3:\n\n\nPurpose:\n Visual demonstration of described anomaly.\n\n\nDate:\n 10/30/17\n\n\nMethod:\n SCP-3213 was given a video camera and told to enter a room with a tank housing two adult earless seals.\n\n\nResults:\n A relatively docile interaction occurred during this test. This is believed to have been an attempt to make SCP-3213 feel safe. Two separate attempts were made to physically drag SCP-3213 into the water six seconds after SCP-3213 turned his back on the seals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 5:\n\n\nPurpose:\n Attempts by Dr. Paul Clifford to communicate with affected animals while SCP-3213 was present.\n\n\nDate:\n 11/08/17\n\n\nMethod:\n SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals. Dr. Clifford was already present.\n\n\nInteraction Log:\n\n\nSeal 1:\n Go fuck yourself, Carl!\n\n\nSeal 2:\n Yeah, go fuck yourself. Long and hard, you fucking bastard.\n\n\nDr. Clifford:\n Excuse me, can you understand me?\n\n\nSeal 2:\n Carl, how's it feel to know that even though you're going bald, you'll never get any uglier?\n\n\nDr. Clifford:\n Can you hear me?\n\n\nSeal 1:\n What's the matter, Carl? Too much of a pussy to answer us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 16:\n\n\nPurpose:\n Attempts to glean more of the reason for the anomaly's existence.\n\n\nDate:\n 1/24/18\n\n\nMethod:\n SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals and to inquire as to the reason behind the anomalous behavior.\n\n\nInteraction Log:\n\n\nSeal 1:\n Should've figured you'd come back, bet you like the taste of shit.\n\n\nSCP-3213:\n What did I do to make you so mad at me?\n\n\nSeal 2:\n Oh ho! This piece of shit wants to know what he did.\n\n\nSeal 1:\n You fucking know what you did, Carl.\n\n\nSCP-3213:\n I never know what you're fucking talking about.\n\n\nSeal 2:\n You're a fucking asshole. We fucking remember 'cause we saw you do that shit, Carl.\n\n\nSeal 1:\n You got all these people fooled. You thought just 'cause it was dark and raining on the beach that night, no one was gonna see what you did?\n\n\nSCP-3213:\n Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n\nSeal 2:\n Coming back to you now, ain't it, asshole. Why don't you jump in here and I'll give you a taste of how it felt.\n\n\nSeal 1:\n Don't worry, we won't kill you. Promise.\n\n\nSCP-3213:\n Why?\n\n\nSeal 2:\n 'cause then we couldn't hurt you any more, Carl.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this interaction, SCP-3213 refused to elaborate on the incident described by the affected animals. It is also unknown why all members of pinniped species are aware of this triggering incident.\n\n\nInvestigation into SCP-3213's past has turned up nothing matching the described details. SCP-3213 testing is currently suspended, and daily interviews are scheduled to determine what events caused this anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3212\n | SCP-3213 | \nSCP-3214\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3213\n\" by Doctor Cimmerian, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
