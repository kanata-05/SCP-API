Portable instances of SCP-1595 are to be transferred into Foundation custody, while stationary instances are to be documented and deleted. Use of Class-C amnestics is authorized when necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1595 is a series of numbered messages originating from various time periods and locations. SCP-1595's anomalous properties stem from their anachronistic nature; instances of SCP-1595 will often be written using methods which should not be available in the time period or location from which they originate, and are always in modern English. SCP-1595 messages are internally serialized, and each instance discovered will follow the one found before it, despite sometimes being written centuries earlier.\n\n\nAdditionally, analysis of the handwriting used in SCP-1595 messages indicates that they have been composed by the same person, regardless of the aforementioned chronological discrepancies. Of the sixty-seven messages found so far, fifty-three have been addressed to the same person, an unknown woman named \"Molly\". Of the remaining messages, three address a \"Danny\", two address a \"Ben\", four have an unknown addressee, and five are mostly illegible.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-1595-A:\n The following is a list of notable instances of SCP-1595:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1595-1\n\n\nOrigin:\n Chiseled on the inside of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family mausoleum, London.\n\n\nApproximate date of writing:\n 1700's\n\n\nRecovered:\n 1920\n\n\nMessage:\n I know you're out there somewhere, Molly.
