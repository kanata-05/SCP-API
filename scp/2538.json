At least 2 security personnel must guard SCP-2538 at all times. Security officers will rotate in shifts accordingly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2538 is a large van with a set of seats in the back, along with several containers. The vehicle has several crude steel plates attached to the sides and windows. SCP-2538 has no visible license plating and manufacturer labels. Due to this, manufacturer and previous owner of SCP-2538 are unknown. The left side of the vehicle has a spray painted rectangular symbol with the letters \"R. S.\" written below.\n\n\nWhen opened by an outside source, several objects will appear inside SCP-2538's back compartment. The objects known to appear include:\n\n\n\n\n4 sets of tactical bullet resistant vests\n\n\n4 loaded M4A1 carbine rifles\n\n\n2 bags of plastic explosives\n\n\n4 masks depicting various animals\n1\n\n\n20 magazines of 5.56x45mm NATO cartridges\n\n\n\n\nUpon opening SCP-2538 again, a new set of the aforementioned items will appear, and will cause all previous items to disappear, regardless of where they are. Any objects placed inside SCP-2538's back compartment will also disappear once a new set is created. Any damage to SCP-2538 is repaired once the object is outside of human sight-lines.\n\n\nThe Foundation first discovered SCP-2538 in a warehouse owned by the company \"Cargo-Partner\" on the edge of Belgrade, Serbia. SCP-2538 was recovered along with a phone hidden inside the vehicle's glove compartment. After recovery the incidents of violent crime in Belgrade decreased.\n\n\nAddendum 2538/01\u00a002/04/10:\n The phone recovered from SCP-2538's glove compartment contained several audio recordings. Each recording dated from 3 months, to 2 days before recovery. These recordings are accessible by personnel of level 2 clearance and above.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0PHONE\u00a0RECORDINGS\u00a0[INPUT\u00a0CREDENTIALS]\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\u00a0[CLOSE\u00a0FILE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaller Name: Dragan\n\n\nHey Marco, I got some extra parts from that saleman.
