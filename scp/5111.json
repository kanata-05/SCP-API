The Pelican Nebula is to be monitored for further SCP-5111 instances. Instances of SCP-5111 present on common wavelengths are to be jammed remotely in order to prevent civilian access.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5111 refers to a series of radio transmissions received from the direction of the Pelican Nebula. It is currently uncertain whether the nebula is the origin of SCP-5111 instances, or whether they are made in its vicinity. SCP-5111 instances are marked by repeated, short messages received in quick succession, though the content of these transmissions varies. No other anomalous or memetic effects of SCP-5111 exposure have been found.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 2025/07/22, Foundation extraterrestrial survey systems detected an unusual radio transmission originating from the vicinity of the Pelican Nebula, located approximately 2000 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. Autonomous data analysis programs isolated the signal and found that it consisted of messages in Morse code, translating to sentences in English. Due to the inherent improbability of such a signal occurring naturally, it was declared anomalous and classified as SCP-5111.\n\nBelow is a table of notable SCP-5111 instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Received\n\n\nMethod of Transmission\n\n\nMessage Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/07/22\n\n\nSent in standard Morse code.\n\n\nTriple pyramoid communication array in Giza Region destroyed beyond repair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/07/30\n\n\nTransmission consisted of characters corresponding to hexadecimal colors. The first letter of each color was used to spell out a word.\n\n\nTHIS IS A LAST RESORT A FINAL REQUIEM GOODBYE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/08/01\n\n\nTransmission consisted of instructions to use the \"turtle\" command with the Python coding language in order to draw circular logograms. Occasionally a cephalopodic glyph would be present in the translation.\n\n\nLOW FUEL. ASSIST NEED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/08/11\n\n\nSent in standard Morse code.\n\n\nBabylo-hanging-style comms array destroyed. Stay quiet for your sake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/08/21\n\n\nSent in standard Morse code.\n\n\nRepository of information torched. It will not encroach upon this territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/08/26\n\n\nSent in the circular logogram language of 2025/08/01.\n\n\nIT WAS HONOR FAREWELL WE MEET AT OCEAN FLOOR NEW LIFE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/08/30\n\n\nSent in Morse code, though 'words' corresponded to muscle areas and movement of these muscles, communicating via Inuit Sign Language.\n\n\nCLOSE SEAL. LAST EFFORT. CONTACT GREEN BLUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/09/15\n\n\nSent in Morse code translating to Latin, with negligible spelling mistakes.\n\n\nThere is no alternative option. Only four of us, soon three. Goodbye, our friends. We praise and love you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/09/20\n\n\nSent in standard Morse code.\n\n\nGOODBYE. OUR ARMS HANG IN HONOR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025/09/26\n\n\nSent in standard Morse code.\n\n\nBE QUIET OR THEY WILL HEAR YOU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final SCP-5111 instance, received on 2025/09/26, consisted of the message shown above and a subsequent energy wave resembling an electromagnetic pulse, which proceeded to render most consumer electronics manufactured after 1980 inoperable in the Upper New York region. Foundation response efforts restored functionality of consumer and Foundation electronics and claimed the event was due to a solar storm.\n\n\nOnce technological functionality was restored, SCP-5111 instances were decoded. A Foundation cryptographer, Dr. Randall Wood, was interviewed as part of this decoding effort.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher James Marshall\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Cryptographer Randall Wood\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nMarshall:\n Hey Ran- Wood. How's the kids?\n\n\nWood:\n Pretty alright, thanks for asking. Jamie's gotten onto the softball team, but I'm still as burned out as ever. Missed his last two games.\n\n\nMarshall:\n Ah, a shame.\n\n\n(Wood points to a camera in the corner of the room. It is switched off.)\n\n\nWood:\n I- Is that thing on?\n\n\nMarshall:\n Oh. Huh. Yeah, I forgot.\n\n\n(Marshall remains silent for five seconds, before sighing.)\n\n\nMarshall:\n Alright, I'm just gonna get right into it. What's up with 5111?\n\n\nWood:\n 5111..? Oh, yeah, lemme just-\n\n\n(Shuffling can be heard as Wood searches around in his briefcase.)\n\n\nWood:\n So, we got the last transmission from it about three-ish weeks ago. It's gone dark. No idea why. Presumably power or the like? It's a fairly cut and dry situation, but what's concerning me is what they-\n\n\nMarshall:\n They?\n\n\nWood:\n Yeah, they.\n\n\n(Marshall sighs, scratching his beard. Rubbing his eyes, he points back at Wood.)\n\n\nMarshall:\n You said \"it\" just a second earlier.\n\n\nWood:\n I- you've gotta be kidding me.\n\n\n(Wood removes a series of images, each representing the decoded form of three different transmissions.)\n\n\nWood:\n Ok, it's clear we've got, at the \nvery\n least, three to five different propagators here. And that's the \nleast.\n Clearly, however, they're bouncing off each other, responding to what the other is saying, offering condolences, saluting, needing fuel, food-\n\n\nMarshall:\n Cut to the chase.\n\n\n(Wood frantically looks around in his bag.)\n\n\nWood:\n Jesus, alright. So look at this. \n(Wood displays a small sheet of paper.)\n This thing is a few bits and bytes of data. Tells us this: some of the propagators poofed. Went dark. Et cetera. You get the gist.\n\n\nMarshall:\n Yeah. Explain the whole pulse bit.\n\n\n(Wood sighs.)\n\n\nWood:\n I'm \ngetting\n there. Let me \nexplain it to you\n. Ok, so the pulse hits: at this point, we're down to two. When the wave/pulse/whatever-in-God's bleeding Earth you want to call this, it knocks down all comms in New York. You should've seen it.\n\n\n(Wood gestures to the map. Marshall takes a sip of coffee. Wood awaits for him to finish, with an annoyed look on his face.)\n\n\nWood:\n Back to more pressing matters, it took us a matter of minutes to get this bumfuck computer back up, along with the rest of this terribly designed system. We did, and no pings were heard. Just gone. We don't know what happened: were we not intended to hear it and the propagators left far, far away?\n\n\nMarshall:\n Possibly.\n\n\nWood:\n See, that's what \nI\n thought. It's a simple warning to us: one small issue. F, the nebula where these originate from, is two thousand light-years away, Marshall. \nTwo fucking thousand.\n This wasn't a \"drop it and go\" situation here.\n\n\n(Marshall raises an eyebrow.)\n\n\nMarshall:\n What are you saying here?\n\n\nWood:\n Radio transmits at light speed. If it takes light 2000 years to get here: \nall\n of these spacefaring guys existed 2000 fucking years ago. They're all gone.\n\n\nMarshall:\n Fuck.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssorted On-site Complaints Following Pulse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplaint:\n Site-75's cafeteria juice blender failed.\n\n\nStatus Of Complaint:\n Blender repaired.

With almost all mechanical equipment employed by the Foundation out of operation for the time being, the O5s decided to turn to us here in the Thaumaturgy Department to fix their little conundrum with a wormhole so they can mount an expedition to the source of SCP-5111. The only direction they gave us was that it needed to lead to some nebula 2000-odd light-years away, and be stable enough for whatever they decide to throw into it to make a return trip.\n\n\nCan't quite blame them for shifting their attention elsewhere, honestly. The world is something of a mess at the moment, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Veil doesn't hold up to the stress. Who knows what it\u2019ll take for things to settle down; I\u2019d rather not dwell on it.\n\n\nAnyway, on to the more pressing concern: manufacturing a stable wormhole to a specific location with nothing but 40-year-old technology and a healthy dose of magic. Not impossible by any means, but certainly difficult with our limited resources. I just sent a team to peruse the Wanderer's Library for some information that could prove useful. Here's hoping they get back in one piece.\n\n\nDate:\n 2025/10/1\n\n\nThe expedition team returned a few hours ago. Six days, for them at least, of roaming the twisted halls of the Library and we finally have what we came for. A thaumaturgical recipe for a targeted portal to wherever we want in the universe. Only problem is it's in an unknown cipher, and our AI cryptographers are out-of-order for the foreseeable future. Nothing to worry about, we still have the best human codebreakers in the world on our side, and they could use something to do.\n\n\nDate:\n 2025/10/5\n\n\nCode cracked. Didn't take as long as I feared, to be honest. After decrypting a combination of various obscure cryptography techniques and translating some ancient Sumerian, we have our wormhole recipe. I've got field agents out acquiring some of the basic components, 50 grams of rhenium dust, a live \nNepenthes peltata\n1\n, a Sumerian ritual dagger, and half a dozen minor ingredients. I won't clutter this log with every detail of the recipe, but despite its complexity, I doubt we'll have much trouble with it. The Foundation Thaumaturgy Department has weathered far worse storms, after all. Now we just need to wait for the folks over in Astronautics to put together a probe for the expedition, hopefully with some rudimentary FTL communication if we're lucky. And hope is about as much as we can do here at the moment.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGujar Protocol Mission Statement\n\n\nAssigned MTF:\n \nMTF Xi-63 (\"Luddites\")\n None. Mission will be carried out by an unmanned drone to minimize risk to human life.\n\n\nOverseeing Researcher:\n Dr. Jack Winters\n\n\nMission goal:\n Utilize a specially-constructed space drone, designated Farer 1, and a thaumaturgical artificial wormhole to access the presumed origin point of SCP-5111, ascertain its origins, and, if possible, contain it.\n\n\n00:00:\n Recording begins. Foundation Thaumaturgy operatives complete the ritual to open a wormhole to the Pelican Nebula. Stars are visible on the other side.\n\n\n00:23:\n Foundation Drone Farer 1 enters the wormhole. In the distance, an unknown spacecraft is visible. F 1 begins to travel towards the spacecraft.\n\n\n32:54:\n Farer 1 reaches the spacecraft. It measures approximately 4500 meters long and 1200 meters high. Floating outside the spacecraft are several dozen corpses, measuring an average of 1.4 meters in height with a humanoid frame, 6 limbs, and avian features. Clothing worn by these entities shows signs of severe burn damage. Near a cluster of corpses, there is a large hole in the hull of the spacecraft.\n\n\n34:21:\n Farer 1 finishes examining the corpses and enters the spacecraft via the large hole. As it crosses the threshold into the craft, a message appears in English for 3 frames of video. The message reads as follows:\n\nGREETINGS, NEW PASSENGERS. WELCOME TO CYCLE ERROR:OVERLOAD OF OUR 25 CYCLE VOYAGE. MOST COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTIONS NO LONGER CONTROLLABLE, APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.\n\n\n34:25:\n Farer 1 examines the chamber which the hole leads to. Equipment is strewn about the room, floating in a zero-G environment. In the center of the chamber is a machine of previously-unseen construction, assumed to be a power source. 3 of the 4 sides of the machine show signs of severe heat damage in excess of 6000 degrees Kelvin. On the opposite side of the room is a doorway.\n\n\n35:04:\n Farer 1 exits the maintenance chamber via the doorway and enters a corridor. As it does, another message appears on the video feed for 4 frames, reading:\n\nI SAW AN EVIL WITH MY BLACKENED EYES, BUT MY OWN LENSES DEVOURED MY INSIDES. WHAT I BIRTHED FOR MY LIFE WAS CORRUPTED AND MY HOME KILLED BY MY GRAND DESIGN\n\n\n37:43:\n Farer 1 continues down the corridor until reaching a large, roughly spherical chamber approximately 1100 meters in diameter. Lining the walls of the chamber are glass tubes 2 meters in height and 0.5 meters in width. Each tube has a derelict monitor on top of it. Visible inside each tube is a humanoid figure with avian features, similar to those seen outside the ship.\n\n\n39:23:\n Farer 1 crosses the chamber, moving towards another doorway on the opposite side. When the drone is roughly halfway across, another message is visible on the video feed for a duration of 2 frames, reading:\n\nPROTOCOLS FEATURING AGENTS J-eF-EK and K-SAGAN BOTH PROVEN SEMI-SUCCESSFUL: PROTOCOL CONTENT LOST.\n\n\n41:36:\n Farer 1 exits the spherical chamber, at which point another message is visible for a single frame of the video feed, reading:\n\nONLY IN THE SILENCE WHERE ONCE WAS SOUND CAN A HOME BE BUILT. THE PATH TO THE CREATORS' PARADISE IS PAVED IN THE ASHES OF PROGRESS. PROGRESS REQUIRES PAIN. PAIN BUILT ON BACKS OF THE OTHERS.\n\n\n45:04:\n Farer 1 continues down the corridor until it reaches a small chamber. The opposite wall is comprised of glass and perforated with holes 1-2 centimeters in diameter, presumably caused by micrometeor impacts. Strewn about the room are several computer terminals in various states of dereliction. One relatively intact terminal briefly begins to hum as Far 1 approaches it, before abruptly ceasing activity.\n\n\n46:29:\n As Farer 1 exits the chamber, a series of electronic beeps are audible, spelling out a message in English Morse Code. The message consists of the following:\n\nCONSOLE DOT LOG OPEN PARENTHESES YOU ARE BUT PREY IN A DARK FOREST COLON WARNING CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH CLOSED PARENTHESES ENTER KEY\n\n\nThe remainder of the survey was uneventful, and Farer 1 returned to the wormhole at 1:20:43. Upon examination of captured footage, one text file and one audio file were present on Farer 1's hard drive which were not present beforehand. These are recorded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following files were present alongside captured video footage upon return of Farer 1.\n\n\n\n\nTranslated Text File Recovered from Gujar Protocol Mission to SCP-5111 Source\n\n\nCongratulations on attending the first galactic council in nearly 912,500 cycles!

I won't clutter this log with every detail of the recipe, but despite its complexity, I doubt we'll have much trouble with it. The Foundation Thaumaturgy Department has weathered far worse storms, after all. Now we just need to wait for the folks over in Astronautics to put together a probe for the expedition, hopefully with some rudimentary FTL communication if we're lucky. And hope is about as much as we can do here at the moment. <END LOG>",
        "Gujar Protocol Mission Statement Assigned MTF: MTF Xi-63 (\"Luddites\") None. Mission will be carried out by an unmanned drone to minimize risk to human life. Overseeing Researcher: Dr. Jack Winters Mission goal: Utilize a specially-constructed space drone, designated Farer 1, and a thaumaturgical artificial wormhole to access the presumed origin point of SCP-5111, ascertain its origins, and, if possible, contain it. 00:00: Recording begins. Foundation Thaumaturgy operatives complete the ritual to open a wormhole to the Pelican Nebula. Stars are visible on the other side. 00:23: Foundation Drone Farer 1 enters the wormhole. In the distance, an unknown spacecraft is visible. F 1 begins to travel towards the spacecraft. 32:54: Farer 1 reaches the spacecraft. It measures approximately 4500 meters long and 1200 meters high. Floating outside the spacecraft are several dozen corpses, measuring an average of 1.4 meters in height with a humanoid frame, 6 limbs, and avian features. Clothing worn by these entities shows signs of severe burn damage. Near a cluster of corpses, there is a large hole in the hull of the spacecraft. 34:21: Farer 1 finishes examining the corpses and enters the spacecraft via the large hole. As it crosses the threshold into the craft, a message appears in English for 3 frames of video. The message reads as follows: GREETINGS, NEW PASSENGERS. WELCOME TO CYCLE ERROR:OVERLOAD OF OUR 25 CYCLE VOYAGE. MOST COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTIONS NO LONGER CONTROLLABLE, APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. 34:25: Farer 1 examines the chamber which the hole leads to. Equipment is strewn about the room, floating in a zero-G environment. In the center of the chamber is a machine of previously-unseen construction, assumed to be a power source. 3 of the 4 sides of the machine show signs of severe heat damage in excess of 6000 degrees Kelvin. On the opposite side of the room is a doorway. 35:04: Farer 1 exits the maintenance chamber via the doorway and enters a corridor. As it does, another message appears on the video feed for 4 frames, reading: I SAW AN EVIL WITH MY BLACKENED EYES, BUT MY OWN LENSES DEVOURED MY INSIDES. WHAT I BIRTHED FOR MY LIFE WAS CORRUPTED AND MY HOME KILLED BY MY GRAND DESIGN 37:43: Farer 1 continues down the corridor until reaching a large, roughly spherical chamber approximately 1100 meters in diameter. Lining the walls of the chamber are glass tubes 2 meters in height and 0.5 meters in width. Each tube has a derelict monitor on top of it. Visible inside each tube is a humanoid figure with avian features, similar to those seen outside the ship. 39:23: Farer 1 crosses the chamber, moving towards another doorway on the opposite side. When the drone is roughly halfway across, another message is visible on the video feed for a duration of 2 frames, reading: PROTOCOLS FEATURING AGENTS J-eF-EK and K-SAGAN BOTH PROVEN SEMI-SUCCESSFUL: PROTOCOL CONTENT LOST. 41:36: Farer 1 exits the spherical chamber, at which point another message is visible for a single frame of the video feed, reading: ONLY IN THE SILENCE WHERE ONCE WAS SOUND CAN A HOME BE BUILT. THE PATH TO THE CREATORS' PARADISE IS PAVED IN THE ASHES OF PROGRESS. PROGRESS REQUIRES PAIN. PAIN BUILT ON BACKS OF THE OTHERS. 45:04: Farer 1 continues down the corridor until it reaches a small chamber. The opposite wall is comprised of glass and perforated with holes 1-2 centimeters in diameter, presumably caused by micrometeor impacts. Strewn about the room are several computer terminals in various states of dereliction. One relatively intact terminal briefly begins to hum as Far 1 approaches it, before abruptly ceasing activity. 46:29: As Farer 1 exits the chamber, a series of electronic beeps are audible, spelling out a message in English Morse Code. The message consists of the following: CONSOLE DOT LOG OPEN PARENTHESES YOU ARE BUT PREY IN A DARK FOREST COLON WARNING CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH CLOSED PARENTHESES ENTER KEY The remainder of the survey was uneventful, and Farer 1 returned to the wormhole at 1:20:43. Upon examination of captured footage, one text file and one audio file were present on Farer 1's hard drive which were not present beforehand. These are recorded below.",

        "Audio File Recovered from Gujar Protocol Mission to SCP-5111 Source <BEGIN PLAYBACK> Unknown: (A static sound of varying volume is present throughout the recording, occasionally rendering the original audio incomprehensible.) This is an official manifest of the Ukheli-1781, a transport class freighter bound for the official council. The two suns are upon us again: it is thus that it determines a council must be held. We are guided not by one of us, for once , for Khay-es proved too unreliable. Instead we selected [STATIC] to provide it effortlessly, for it to take the proverbial reins whilst we look to the Outer Void. It is known that the council has not been held since the humanics lost capabilities - however, we, alongside a few others, have decided to function as liaisons. It will take a while, but this council is to be momentous: it is worth the travel. (There is silence for approximately 2 minutes.) Unknown: This is an official manifest of the Ukheli-1781: [STATIC] 6. We have lost contact with the octopoids. Whether this is a form of humor, I know not. None of us on the ship are quite familiar with their tentacled ways. We have, however, received a final transmission prior to them leaving us. We know not what it is. Our best debreakers are working on it as we speak, and by best, I mean Khay-es, so it is likely not going to be debroken. [STATIC] recommended [STATIC] schedule. It is most annoying. The council proved most momentous, despite the lacking attendance. I frown upon those who chose not to show. For those who physically could not, I hang my arms in honor. The threat is ever vigilant, and we lost many. (There is silence for approximately 1 minute.) Unknown: This is an official manifest of the [STATIC] -1781: [STATIC] . Khay-es is now navigating. We have attempted to shut down the infamous Worm as he did appear, but his winding form appears to have embedded itself most everywhere. In doing so, we acknowledged the threat, and requested access to official detection channels to locate the presence of our allies. We have them still. While they are here, we will persevere. We have also detected a faint signal from the humanics - the kind which [STATIC] dangerous on our own ship, We have requested two \"Effe Tee Elye\" class craft to destroy them as they appear. The Worm shall not continue. We have inadvertently dug this grave, but we are determined not to lie in it. Unknown: This is an official manifest of the [STATIC] . Khay-es could do no more. Our cycle is done. Bless the ones who remain. Bless what remains of our nest. Let us not be forgotten. Cast the shackles of the Worm off, humanics, and won't you rise from the rock of ignorance you hide [STATIC] that which protects you? Let us not be forgotten: our \"Effe Tee Elye\" craft reported a most beautiful phrase when they had destroyed the rotund transmission center: the hybrid arena. \"Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant.\" Let us not be forgotten. Goodbye. (There is a silence for exactly 10 seconds. At this point, the background static ceases.) Unknown: PRINT DOT THIS IS AN OFFICIAL MANIFEST OF THE UKHELI-1781. IF THE HUMANICS CAN HEAR THIS: NOTHING IS WRONG. NOTHING. PLEASE GIVE US THE COORDINATES TO DHARATI. THE HOMEWORLD. WE HAVE LOST THEM. IF THE HUMANICS ARE OUT THERE, PLEASE LISTEN TO US. WE SEEM TO HAVE MISPLACED THEM. IF NO RESPONSE IS RECEIVED, I CAN WAIT. IT IS WHAT I DO BEST. THERE'S NO ONE I CARE FOR LEFT. I WAIT FOR NONE BUT MYSELF. END PRINT (There is a silence for exactly 5 minutes.) Unknown: ALERT: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES DETECTED. INITIATING PACIFICATION PROTOCOLS. ANALYZING\u2026. CONFIRMED.
