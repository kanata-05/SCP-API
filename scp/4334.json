The former park office, located at the entrance to SCP-4334, has been converted into Provisional Site-133 for the purpose of housing research and security personnel. Security cameras have been stationed around the perimeter of SCP-4334. Site-133 personnel are to administer Class-A amnestics to any civilians attempting to trespass within SCP-4334. The Anomalous Communication Scrambling Network (ACSN) is to be utilized in intercepting and deleting messages sent by SCP-4334-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4334 designates the 3.4\u00a0km\n2\n of forest within Oakwood State Park, Connecticut. SCP-4334 exhibits multiple anomalous properties and phenomena, which began manifesting on 04/07/2016. The following is a list of observed anomalous features:\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 75% of trees within SCP-4334 exhibit wooden growths resembling Type B electrical outlets. These growths are functional, and emit between 100 and 127 volts of electricity.\n\n\nThe entirety of SCP-4334 emits WiFi signals with no discernible source. The WiFi network is named \"NatureIsCool\" and does not require a password to access.\n\n\nAt night, music can be heard within SCP-4334 with no discernible source. This music mostly consists of songs that are popular at the time, with a heavily amplified bass line.\n\n\nFireflies can be found within SCP-4334 during the entirety of the year, despite typically requiring temperatures in excess of 15\u00b0C to become active. Whenever music is played within SCP-4334, either by a human or through SCP-4334's previously stated property, these fireflies will form large clusters on tree branches and emit bioluminescence in a synchronized manner in time with the beat of the music.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4334-1 is the email account \"\nmoc.liamg|loocsierutan#moc.liamg|loocsierutan\n\". SCP-4334-1 has no known affiliation with the former Oakwood State Park staff or the Connecticut Department of Forestry and Conservation. SCP-4334-1 sends monthly emails to every individual under the age of 18 within a 5km radius of SCP-4334. These messages detail multiple characteristics of SCP-4334, both anomalous and otherwise, and appear to be attempts to garner interest in SCP-4334 within the recipient population. This behavior has continued even after the enactment of SCP-4334\u2019s containment procedures. It is thus presumed that the entity behind SCP-4334-1 is unaware of Foundation interference.\n\n\nAddendum 4334.1:\n \nDiscovery\n\n\nSCP-4334 was discovered on 04/10/2016 by Foundation personnel planted within the National Park Service. In the months following the enactment of containment procedures, several adolescent civilians attempted to enter SCP-4334. Upon questioning, each individual displayed partial knowledge of SCP-4334\u2019s anomalous properties, and cited emails they had received as the source of the information. This lead to the discovery of SCP-4334-1. All civilians were treated with Class-A amnestics and released.\n\n\nAddendum 4334.2:\n \nNotable SCP-4334-1 Transcripts\n\n\nThe following is a partial list of emails sent by SCP-4334-1. Please see Supplemental Document 4334-A for a full list of all archived emails.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 04/07/2016\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n First known email sent by SCP-4334-1. Message was sent at the same time that SCP-4334\u2019s first anomalous properties formed.\n\n\n\n\nHey Kids! Looking for a hip new crib for you and your squad? Why don\u2019t you come on down to Oakwood State Park! This isn\u2019t your average everyday forest, this forest is with the times! There are new state-of-the-art all natural power outlets, so your phone will never die (and neither will the fun). Not to mention free Wifi! So what are you waiting for? The forest of the future is here! #Natureiscool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 03/16/2017\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Email was sent following the discovery of music and anomalous firefly behavior within SCP-4334.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s good in the hood my dudes! Oakwood State park just underwent a major revamp. That\u2019s right, all the hottest new tunes are now here every night for you to get jiggy with! Not only that, the fireflies will join in too, making every night in the woods into an epic rave! This forest is more lit than any club scene around, so what are you waiting for???? Come on down to Oakwood State Park, and get turnt! #lit #epic #natureiscool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 08/21/2018\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Most recent email sent by SCP-4334-1.\n\n\n\n\nYou know what? Fuck all of you. You kids are everything that\u2019s wrong with the world today. Children like you used to play in me all the time, wading around in creeks, climbing trees, wholesome forest stuff. But noooooo, your generation is too good for that. Everything\u2019s gotta be all flashy and digital, and I\u2019ve gotta bust my ass to try to be \u201chip\u201d. Did you know that fireflies usually only come out in the summer? Do you know how hard it was to get mine to stick around all year? And even after all the effort I\u2019ve put in you still won\u2019t even show up. Well screw it, I quit. Enjoy your vapes or whatever the fuck you\u2019re all into nowadays. I\u2019m done.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Following 08/21/2018, SCP-4334-1 has ceased activity. Furthermore, exploration of SCP-4334 following this date has revealed no evidence of continuing anomalous phenomena. Proposals to reclassify SCP-4334 as neutralized are currently pending review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4333\n | SCP-4334 | \nSCP-4335\n \u00bb",
