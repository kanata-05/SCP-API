The floor is mirrored. Three (3) bright lights are positioned on the ceiling in such a way so that all the room is lit. These lights are to remain lit for 24 hours every day and are attached to a backup generator in case of power outage. The room will be examined for mold or stains daily, and these will be immediately removed if found.\n\n\nTwo level-2 guards are to be stationed outside SCP-598\u2019s room at all times. Supervised contact with SCP-598 is unrestricted to all personnel with Level-2 access. All are subject to searches before and after contact, and random psychoanalysis afterwards.\n\n\nUnless permission is received from a overseer, tools such as knives, scalpels, mirrors, paint-peelers, or cameras are restricted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-598 is an intelligent shade of yellow covering the whole of the inside of its cell. Attempts to reproduce SCP-598 with paints, crayons, etc., have failed. Through experimentation, SCP-598's properties have been discovered not to be tint or shade dependent (different shades of light, except for total darkness, will not affect the item's sentience) but are hue-dependent (a colored filter placed over the item's light source will cancel the effect).\n\n\nSCP-598 can process audiovisual stimuli in its nearby surroundings, but cannot speak nor move autonomously, nor communicate using normal senses. SCP-598 is, however, telepathic, and capable of holding extended mental conversations, enjoying topics like music, art, and science. It displays a slight interest in the SCP Foundation, although it is likely this is because of its immediate surroundings, and not for malevolent reasons.\n\n\nSCP-598 is not a physical organism- it does not move, grow, eat, sleep, or excrete waste, so it is not technically alive. Any color-accurate copy of SCP-598, reproduced by any means including computer, video recording or mirrors, will become SCP-598.\n\n\nAn interesting phenomena occurs whenever any short-wave radio is within 4 meters of SCP-598. They will begin to pick up a previously out-of-range station which will broadcast different noises.\n\n\nAs of yet, the following have been recorded:\n\n\n\n\nWolf-like howling\n\n\nWhale song\n\n\nFrogs croaking, punctuated by insect sounds\n\n\nLow humming of unknown origin\n\n\nHigh-pitched chirping noises, revealed to be bat noises brought into human hearing frequencies\n\n\n\n\nSCP-598 does not seem to know where these noises originate, yet enjoys a radio placed in the room and tuned to this frequency. The noises change at random, and go on for hours at a time.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nIt has been suggested by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that a sample of SCP-598 be introduced to \nSCP-085\n. Pending approval by overseers and all involved parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-597\n | SCP-598 | \nSCP-599\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-598\n\" by Sophia Light, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
