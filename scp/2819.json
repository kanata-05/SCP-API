Both are to be contained in standard small-organism terrariums inside Size-2 Containment Lockers on opposite sides of Site 67. A milkweed plant should be maintained inside each tank for the SCP instances to feed on.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-2819 refers to a set of two male \nTetraopes tetraophthalmus\n, otherwise known as the milkweed beetle. SCP-2819-1 is primarily white with black markings, while SCP-2819-2 is primarily black with white markings. This differs from usual instances of \nTetraopes tetraophthalmus\n, which are red.\n\n\nSCP-2819-1 and 2819-2 show extreme animosity towards each other, and will fight in a way inconsistent with behavioral patterns of non-anomalous \nTetraopes tetraophthalmus\n. If SCP-2819-1 and 2819-2 are within 100m of each other, they will seek out the other and attack it. The lengths at which they will fight have not been thoroughly tested; it is theorized that if left alone, they will fight to the death. Neither shows any violent tendencies toward other members of \nTetraopes tetraophthalmus\n, even ones disguised by Foundation personnel to resemble the opposite entity of SCP-2819.\n\n\nSubjects placed near SCP-2819-1 or -2 experience an emotional stagnation. 'Happy' or 'content' persons exposed to SCP-2819-1 will remain so indefinitely, and the opposite is true for individuals exposed to SCP-2819-2. This effect can be countered via Class-B Amnestics. Post-administration, subjects report 'a feeling of loss' for a few hours before returning to normal.\n\n\nBoth SCP-2819-1 and -2 were recovered on opposite sides of the garden belonging to Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a wealthy businessman in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Massachusetts.\n\n\nNote:\n High-power microphones located in both containment units detected a rhythmic clicking originating from SCP-2819-1 and -2's mandibles\u2014analysis determined this to be Morse code. Interviews were scheduled and conducted following this development.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a02819-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2819-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Webb\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: Hello.\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: Is Jackie here?\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: No. Why do you ask?\n\n\n[SCP-2819-1 pauses.]\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: You're lying. He is.\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: He is, but he's on the other side of the building. It's very far.\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: Good. Keep him there.\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: Why do you dislike SCP-2819-2?\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: Jackie? He makes everyone feel\u2026horrible. All he does is bring everyone down, and it's terrible. He's ruining humanity, a few people at a time.\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: And this drives you to attack him.\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: He's villainous. He must be stopped.\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: What do you do?\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: I come bearing gifts. Happiness is the ultimate goal for humanity\u2014if I can provide, why should I not give?\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: And by doing this, what do you hope to accomplish?\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: If everyone is happy, then Jackie will be useless. Hopefully he'll kill himself so I won't have to worry about it.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Webb\n: Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n\nSCP-2819-1\n: You're welcome. And if you see Jackie, step on him, will you?\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Webb felt no compulsion to attack SCP-2819-2 following the interview. He did report a more pleasant disposition, which he attributed to SCP-2819-1's effect. Class C amnestics were requested and distributed, with a recommendation to future personnel to take one following each interview with either instance of SCP-2819.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a02819-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2819-2\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Webb\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Webb:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-2819-2:\n Wilson's not here, is he?\n\n\nDr. Webb:\n SCP-2819-1 is not present.\n\n\nSCP-2819-2:\n I'll snap his fucking antennae if he gets near me, I swear.\n\n\nDr. Webb:\n Why do you dislike SCP-2819-1?\n\n\nSCP-2819-2:\n He's a liar.

I'm sure he told you all about how everything is \nmy\n fault, how \nI'm\n an awful person. I bet he didn't tell you about all the terrible things \nhe\n did. The bottom line is that we pissed off father together. So he punished us together.\n\n\nDr. Webb:\n I didn't ask SCP-2819-1 anything about that.\n\n\nSCP-2819-2:\n Then I'd better tell you.

But we fought all the time, and eventually\u2026well, he got sick. Sick of watching light fight dark. Good fight evil. Brother fight brother.
