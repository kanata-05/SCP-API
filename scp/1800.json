All accessways and rooms within a 200m radius of SCP-1800 shall be kept to authorized personnel only, and will be kept clear of unnecessary personnel during testing. Personnel authorized to be in the restricted area must not fit Profile Alpha-1800-1 \n(see: \nAddendum 2\n)\n or Profile Beta-1800-1 \n(see: \nAddendum 3\n)\n Testing is authorized on SCP-1800 with approval of the current project leader.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1800 is a bronze sculpture measuring 146cm in height. The casting appears identical to the work \nLe Minotaure\n by Salvador Dal\u00ed produced by the Valsuani foundry in 1982 with the following deviations:\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to date the sculpture have been inconclusive, but suggest it was created at least \u2588\u2588 years prior to the earliest date of official casting at the Valsuani foundry. (This would also predate the first known Dali painting of the subject by \u2588 years.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sculpture is missing a foundry mark and signature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe small drawer above the inner right ankle is functional, and can be opened and closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the drawer is an inscription absent from the official casting: \nQuin preu \u00e9s la virtut\n.\n1\n Inscription appears to have been engraved some time after casting.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1800 is typically in an inactive state during which it shows no anomalous properties. If some unit of minted currency is placed in the drawer in the lower right leg of the sculpture, and the drawer is closed, the contents of the drawer will disappear and SCP-1800 will enter a pending state.\n2\n\n\nWhen SCP-1800 is in a pending state it will appear inactive\n3\n until a human subject fitting Profile Alpha-1800-1 or Profile Beta-1800-1 enters an area within a 167m radius of effect\n4\n surrounding SCP-1800.\n\n\nWhen a human subject fitting Profile Alpha-1800-1 enters the radius of effect while SCP-1800 is in a pending state, SCP-1800 will become active and move its right arm to point two fingers in the direction of the subject for approximately 15 seconds\n5\n. The subject is subsequently designated SCP-1800-1. After 15 seconds, SCP-1800 will return to its original pose. If any instance of SCP-1800-2 exists, SCP-1800 will also then return to an inactive state, otherwise its state will continue to be pending.\n\n\nWhen a human subject fitting Profile Beta-1800-1 enters the radius of effect while SCP-1800 is in a pending state, SCP-1800 will become active and move its left arm to point three fingers in the direction of the subject for approximately 17 seconds.\n6\n The subject is subsequently designated SCP-1800-2. After 17 seconds, SCP-1800 will return to its original pose. If any instance of SCP-1800-1 exists, SCP-1800 will also then return to an inactive state, otherwise its state will continue to be pending.\n\n\nWhen any number of instances of SCP-1800-1 and SCP-1800-2 simultaneously exist, instances of SCP-1800-1 will seek out instances of SCP-1800-2\n7\n and initiate some form of ritualized interaction. After completion, the object(s) of this interaction will cease being designated as SCP-1800-2, and if there are no more remaining instances of SCP-1800-2, the initiator(s) of the interaction will cease being designated SCP-1800-1. The specific nature of the interaction initiated by SCP-1800-1 is determined by the type of currency used prior to SCP-1800 selecting SCP-1800-1.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a0T1800-37:\u00a0Table\u00a0of\u00a0Selected\u00a0SCP-1800-1/SCP-1800-2\u00a0Interactions\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a0T1800-37:\u00a0Table\u00a0of\u00a0Selected\u00a0SCP-1800-1/SCP-1800-2\u00a0Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency Used\n\n\nInteraction Observed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010 U.S. Lincoln Penny\n\n\nSCP-1800-1 verbally harasses SCP-1800-2 for a period of 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1943 Steel U.S. Lincoln Penny\n\n\nSCP-1800-1 verbally harasses SCP-1800-2 for a period of 23 minutes.

According to security cameras, at 13:25, the interview subject approached SCP-1800 and placed an unidentified coin in SCP-1800\u2019s lower drawer and closed it. SCP-1800 immediately entered an active state and selected SCP-1800-1 and SCP-1800-2 from the museum patrons. SCP-1800-1 immediately engaged in ritual rape, murder and dismemberment of SCP-1800-2. Three security guards were injured, one fatally, when they attempted to intervene. Ritual interaction was interrupted by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 police firing on and killing SCP-1800-1.

Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Were you expecting the statue to do something? Orwell: Like what? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Move. Orwell: Huh? I was metaphorically tweaking the Dal\u00ed industrial complex. It\u2019s not a vending machine or an amusement park ride. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : You didn\u2019t watch the statue after you closed that drawer? Orwell: I was paying more attention to the guards, who might have objected to my little protest. Then there was this slight issue of some German tourist killing his daughter and trying to\u2014 Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : We have witnesses that say the statue raised its arms and pointed at Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and his daughter. Orwell: What? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Are you certain you didn\u2019t see the statue move? Orwell: It\u2019s not a mannequin. That thing is solid bronze, no joints. It isn\u2019t going to wave its arms like a pirate on a Disney ride. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : So you didn\u2019t see anything? Orwell: You\u2019ve got to be kidding. I was watching something a lot more horrifying and transgressive than that derivative, self-plagiarized excuse for a sculpture. 8 Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Thank you, Mr. Orwell. Orwell: [pause] So, uh, are we cool yet? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Hmm? Orwell: Are we cool? Have you got what you need? Can I go? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : Uh-huh, see the nurse on the way out. <End Log> Closing Statement: As with all witnesses to SCP-1800\u2019s active phase, David Orwell was provided with a prophylactic Class-A amnestic to suppress any knowledge of SCP-1800\u2019s involvement in the case. Possible connections between David Orwell and any Groups of Interest were not perused until \u2588 years later when a routine review of SCP-1800\u2019s case files identified the phrase \u201care we cool yet?\u201d Mr. Orwell\u2019s statement pre-dates official Foundation recognition of the \u201cAre We Cool Yet?\u201d collective by \u2588 years. Subsequent attempts to locate Mr. Orwell for a follow-up investigation have yet to be successful. What, are we supposed to go back and re-investigate every piece of so-called art we have in containment now? It\u2019s a god-damn coincidence\u2014 Agent J. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, MTF-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588",
