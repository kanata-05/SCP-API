The public is to be informed that SCP-3816 is a non-anomalous telescope. Due to the security hazard it poses, entrance to SCP-3816 is restricted to personnel with Level 3/3816 clearance.\n\n\nSCP-3816 is being proposed for reconnaissance on Groups of Interest and other antagonistic entities pending O5 approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3816 is the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), located in Xinglong Station observatory, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China. SCP-3816 provides a seemingly omnipresent \"bird's-eye\" field of view capable of being maneuvered to areas and scales that appear physically impossible from the telescope's dimensions. Time does not elapse in the field of view provided by SCP-3816 and instead shows the same particular point in time as when the object was first used by the viewer. Movement of its field of view gradually speeds up to improbably high speeds when used, most likely to facilitate the convenient use of its large range.\n\n\nWhen viewed through SCP-3816, all sapient organic organisms take on a luminescent blue coloration which is present through walls and other physical barriers. This includes other non-human anomalous forms of life. On the lower right corner of the object's field of view, a counter notes the number of sapient organisms currently inside the field of view.\n\n\nSCP-3816 was built in 2008 by the Chinese Academy of Science. Its anomalous properties were discovered on 10/21/2014, 1 year, 3 months, and 13 days after the LAMOST regular survey began. It is currently hypothesized that SCP-3816 gained its properties through unauthorized alterations of its internal structure with an unknown anomalous impetus.\n\n\nAddendum 3816-1:\n Testing Logs\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 3/31/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Junior Researcher Jayesh Acharya, who is standing 50 meters away from SCP-3816.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Researcher Acharya is spotted, emitting a luminescent blue glow.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 3/31/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Junior Researcher Jayesh Acharya, who is standing 500 meters away from SCP-3816 and facing the posterior side of the telescope.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Researcher Acharya is spotted, emitting a luminescent blue glow. The orientation of SCP-3816 is unchanged.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 3/31/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Junior Researcher Jayesh Acharya, who is in his hotel room in Beijing 115\u00a0km away from SCP-3816.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Researcher Acharya is spotted, emitting a luminescent blue glow.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n1\n\n\n\n\nUpon realizing the large range that SCP-3816 exhibits, further testing was ordered to determine its capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/6/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Foundation Site-29, located in Busan, South Korea, approximately 1191\u00a0km away from SCP-3816.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Site-29 is spotted, and numerous figures glowing luminescent blue can be seen through its walls.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n523\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/6/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Foundation Site-91, located in Smolensk, Russia, approximately 6221\u00a0km away from SCP-3816.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Site-91 is spotted, and numerous figures glowing luminescent blue can be seen through its walls.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n491\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/6/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Foundation Site-67, located in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Canada, approximately 10444\u00a0km away from SCP-3816.\n\n\nRESULT:\n Site-67 is spotted, and numerous figures glowing luminescent blue can be seen through its walls.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n681\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/8/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Beijing, China\n\n\nRESULT:\n SCP-3816 is maneuvered directly above the nearby city of Beijing, China. Smog obscures much of the city. Due to a large number of sapient organisms in view, blue luminescence appears as a confluent mass surrounding the city above this scale.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n26102681\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/8/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n China\n\n\nRESULT:\n SCP-3816 zooms out until the whole of the People's Republic of China can be viewed, along with portions of Mongolia, India, and Thailand.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n1691731620\n\n\n\n\nFurther testing on SCP-3816 was ordered to determine how far its field of view can be zoomed out.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/9/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Earth\n\n\nRESULT:\n SCP-3816 zooms out until the eastern hemisphere of Earth is visible from outer space. At this point, SCP-3816 appears to bypass the Earth itself, perceiving all individuals on the western hemisphere as well, allowing SCP-3816 to identify all sapient life forms on Earth as of 12:26 PM CST, 4/9/2019. The Earth itself appears as a confluent sphere of blue luminescence.\n\n\nCOUNTER:\n \n7810295827\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 4/9/2019\n\n\nTARGET:\n Earth\n\n\nRESULT:\n SCP-3816 zooms out until the camera is estimated 0.25 AU from Earth.
