Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be located, it is to be retrieved and released into its natural habitat. MTF \u03bb-6 (Elmer Fudds) are to be equipped with standard tranquilizer firearms when searching for an instance of SCP-2706-2.\n\n\nIf any instance of SCP-2706-2 becomes hostile and detrimental to the survival of MTF \u03bb-6, then the mobile task force has full authorization to utilize any firepower available within Area-37 armory. Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be too dangerous for normal engagement parameters then Procedure 442 Kito-Fas is to be enacted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2706 is a white oak (\nQuercus alba\n) forest located thirty-six kilometers east of Clarksburg, West Virginia. The trees located within SCP-2706 (known as SCP-2706-1 instances) are unusually sturdy (with the density of an individual instance measuring 44.32\u00a0g/cm\n3\n). All SCP-2706-1 instances have between 3-10 abnormal growths (similar in appearance to burls) attached to their trunk.\n\n\nPeriodically these abnormal growths will produce an organism of the \nanimalia\n kingdom (referred to as SCP-2706-2 instances) through a process that is not fully understood. SCP-2706-2 instances are produced at different stages of development and are anatomically normal. All attempts to remove an SCP-2706-2 instance from an instance of SCP-2706-1 have resulted in the death of the organism.\n\n\nSCP-2706 was first recovered when the corpse of a bottle-nose dolphin (\nTursiops truncatus\n) was found in the area. Local authorities subsequently discovered a number of non-native animals in the area, including a pair of cheetahs, a kangaroo, six penguins, an anaconda, and two rhinoceros. All animals recovered were re-released into their natural habitat. Assets embedded in local law enforcement notified the Foundation, which established Area-37 in order to contain further SCP-2706-2 instances.\n\n\n\n\nLogin\u00a0Credentials:\u00a02706\u00a0Authorization\u00a0Token\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\nLogin\u00a0Credentials:\u00a0ACCEPTED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1\n\n\nOn August 17, 1972 a human instance of SCP-2706-2 was produced and discovered by MTF \u03bb-6. SCP-2706-2 was naked, in the advanced stages of shock and was given medical treatment. SCP-2706-2 claimed to be Jeremy Monroe (a botany student) from Hillsdale, Iowa.
