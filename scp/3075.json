MTF Tau-70 (\u201cSun Bathers\u201d) are on standby to recover SCP-3075-A instances should previously undocumented anomalous activity be observed, at the discretion of Site-49 Command.\n\n\nUPDATE (24.08.2023): Specimen ZQ-457, which is stored in Class III biocontainment at Site-86, is now provisionally a constituent object of SCP-3075. As part of recovery efforts, the search for similar instances in Nordfriesland and Schleswig-Flensburg is ongoing.\n\n\nUPDATE (09.12.2026): The containment revision of 24.08.2023 is hereby obsolete (see Addendum 3075-19).\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3075 is a statistical discrepancy concerning the number of births in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The anomaly was first noted by government statisticians during the European Union census of 2021; 468 more children (designated SCP-3075-A) between the ages of four and nine were reported in predominantly coastal communities in the district of Nordfriesland than could be accounted for in any way. In all cases, birth certification was absent and no other evidence of birth was found. Persons directly affected by SCP-3075 could not provide meaningful information regarding the circumstances of the appearance of SCP-3075-A and fail to express suspicion regarding SCP-3075-A in general.\n\n\nThe unusual and unexpected size of the discrepancy prompted a federal investigation that was unable to identify the cause of the anomaly; the case was handed to the Foundation by July of 2023.\n\n\nSCP-3075-A are physiologically and biologically indistinguishable from human children. However, instances exhibit difficulty with the comprehension and communication of complex abstract ideas. SCP-3075-A also exhibit poor facial and body language comprehension. The possibility that SCP-3075-A produce a memetic effect obscuring true anatomical characteristics has not been ruled out.\n\n\nPersons that regularly interact with SCP-3075-A tend to behave in an excessively agreeable manner and, in the case of psychologically mature individuals, exhibit a high degree of sexual assertiveness. This may be linked to persistently high levels of both serotonin and dopamine in affected individuals.\n\n\nSpecimen ZQ-457 is the cadaver of a humanoid entity of unknown provenance, discovered on 04.07.2021 (one month before the undertaking of the census) in the outskirts of a truck stop near Silberstedt, a town less than five kilometres outside Nordfriesland. The circumstances surrounding the specimen\u2019s discovery and autopsy results led to the provisional reclassification of the object.\n\n\nThe current focus of investigation is establishing a definitive connection between SCP-3075-A and ZQ-457.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimen\u00a0ZQ-457\u00a0Autopsy\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutopsy of Specimen ZQ-457\n\n\nDate, Time & Location of Examination:\n 08.07.2021, 09:45 CEST, Site-86 Operation Suite D\n\n\nConducted by:\n Dr. E. Kampf, Site-86 medical examiner; assisted by mortuary technician R. Penning\n\n\nExamination Summary:\n ZQ-457 is superficially human in appearance. The cadaver is largely covered with short brown hair, with the exception of the face, hands, and feet. The cadaver is reminiscent of a human child between the ages of four and five. Black putrefaction is evident.\n\n\nZQ-457\u2019s facial features and skull structure vaguely resemble those of a chimpanzee, with pronounced browridges and a notably narrow cranial cavity evident.\n\n\nThe brain exhibits significant deviations from conventional biology. Complex metallic plates cover approximately 40% of the total surface area of the brain. Moreover, metallic, filament-like strands extend into the brain, with a maximum depth of 18\u00a0cm evidenced.\n\n\nZQ-457 lacks a reproductive system. Furthermore, an approximately 27-week old human foetus of unclear sex was recovered from the abdominal cavity where the uterus would have been situated. The foetus was found to be covered in a polymer textile resembling a full-body bathing suit.\n\n\nManner of Death:\n Unclear.\n\n\nDNA results:\n In comparison to \nH. s sapiens\n, ZQ-457 possesses a similarity of 99.6%. The DNA of the specimen closely corresponds with that of extinct species \nH. erectus\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3075-A Surveillance Report E13 (15.09.2023)\n\n\nPrepared by:\n F. Hakim, Site-49 Surveillance Operative\n\n\nThere is little distinction in behaviour among the 45 SCP-3075-A instances under my team\u2019s surveillance. Instances invariably and indiscriminately exhibit a high degree of obedience, docility, and friendliness, effectively latching onto any individual with which visual contact has been established. Individuals that are the target of this affection tend to respond positively, especially with increasing exposure. However, even where a negative response is observed, SCP-3075-A do not deviate from their established behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation\u00a0LT05\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a03075-903\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 3075-903\n\n\nLocation:\n \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Orphanage \nDate and time:\n 07.01.2024, 12:35 CET\n\n\nInterviewer:\n D.

All but three instances possess an active sexual life, with multiple partners and a mean average of 3.5 offspring per instance. This fertility rate corresponds with those documented by most of my colleagues, and are higher than the national average. The offspring in question are behaviourally similar to their non-3075-A parent, exhibiting relatively little of the comprehension and communication issues that are, to an extent, still present in 3075-A instances.\n\n\n\n\nIncident 3075-12:\n At approximately 02:27 CEST on 17.09.2042, all surveillance infrastructure in SCP-3075-affected domiciles permanently failed without warning.

    "description": "SCP-3075 is a statistical discrepancy concerning the number of births in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The anomaly was first noted by government statisticians during the European Union census of 2021; 468 more children (designated SCP-3075-A) between the ages of four and nine were reported in predominantly coastal communities in the district of Nordfriesland than could be accounted for in any way. In all cases, birth certification was absent and no other evidence of birth was found. Persons directly affected by SCP-3075 could not provide meaningful information regarding the circumstances of the appearance of SCP-3075-A and fail to express suspicion regarding SCP-3075-A in general.",
