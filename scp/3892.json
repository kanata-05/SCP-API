Fiber analysis has revealed SCP-3892 to be made of a non-anomalous cotton-polyester blend.\n\n\nSCP-3892's anomalous properties manifest when it is worn by a sleeping child of age 10 or under. Once the subject has reached N1 (earliest) stage sleep, SCP-3892-01 will manifest within 10 meters of SCP-3892 (typically within a closet or hallway in domestic trials).\n\n\nSCP-3892-01 is a large (approx. 2.3 meters tall) skeletal humanoid figure, dressed in a spiked leather jacket, torn denim trousers, and black motorcycle boots. SCP-3892-01's eye sockets contain yellow lights, and luminous smoke can be seen issuing from its mouth and ribcage.\n\n\nUpon manifesting, SCP-3892-01 will silently approach the target. The air temperature within a 10-meter radius will warm to approximately 27\u00b0 C.\n\n\nSCP-3892-01 will then tuck the subject into bed, whisper \u201cGood night, (name)\"\n1\n, gently kiss the subject on the head, then demanifest.\n\n\nSCP-3892-01 has neither harmed nor awakened any children during testing trials, and instantly demanifests if approached or interrupted.\n\n\nAddendum 3892-01\n: On 10 May 2018, SCP-3892-01 looked directly into a testing chamber camera after kissing the subject, growled, and said, \"I know where you sleep.\" SCP-3892-01 then loudly cracked each of its knuckles and demanifested as normal.\n\n\nSCP-3892-01 has not responded to any attempt at communication by Foundation personnel before or since this event. The significance of this is unknown.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
