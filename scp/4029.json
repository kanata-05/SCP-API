A revised version will be uploaded to the database once investigations are complete. For more information, see \nAddendum 12-06-1998\n.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4029\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAswan, Egypt\n. SCP-4029 was located to the left of the salmon building (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n A unit of MTF Upsilon-Peor\u00f0 (\"Slings and Arrows\")\n1\n is to guide SCP-4029 away from population centres using a combination of blunt non-penetrative force, loud noise (between 130 and 140 decibels), bright strobing lights, and various other forms of stimuli irritants. An antimemetic barrier is to be erected around SCP-4029 whenever it enters a dormant phase (see description). A method of rendering SCP-4029 immobile is currently being researched.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4029 is a large office block, formerly the regional headquarters of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial, capable of locomotion by means of ten mechanical segmented limbs\n2\n, two of which terminate in claws. SCP-4029 displays signs of low-level sentience, showing self-preservation instincts and responding to external stimuli. SCP-4029 is entirely watertight, accessible only by a single airlock in place of the front entrance. The structure's interior is filled with a transparent nutrient-rich fluid\n3\n. The entrance is only accessible during times in which SCP-4029 is dormant or immobile, at which point SCP-4029 will dig its limbs into the ground until the front entrance is ground level and its limbs are hidden.\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-4029 remains largely unchanged from its original layout, with the following notable exceptions:\n\n\n\n\nThe refitting of the air conditioning system to extract waste products from the aforementioned fluid, and to replenish supplies of fluid.\n\n\nThe waterproofing of many (but not all) electrical installments, such as lights and cameras.\n\n\nA large hollow space at the centre of the fourth and fifth storeys (see Exploration Log 4029-1 for more information).\n\n\nA tightly-packed layout of workstations, each containing a small metal desk and standard office chair (both fixed securely to the floor), and a 1970s-era microcomputer of unknown brand with bundles of wires leading from the back to large ports in the floor, ceiling, and walls. ~98% of these workstations are occupied by human subjects, supplied with oxygen by means of clear plastic tubes inserted into the back of the neck. The majority of subjects (designated SCP-4029-1) appear to be former employees of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial, although other, unidentified instances have also been observed.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4029-1 instances will perform basic calculations (addition, subtraction, incrementation etc.) at their work stations from 09:00 to 17:00, Mondays to Fridays (excluding national holidays). SCP-4029 is entirely dormant and unresponsive during periods in which SCP-4029-1 are not active, suggesting the intelligence of the entity may be an emergent property of the network.\n\n\nBelow is a timeline of SCP-4029's manifestation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/29/1929\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial declares bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/30/1979\n\n\nAn image of an office building previously owned by \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial noticeably leaning into a neighbouring building appears in a newspaper in the city of Aswan, Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/3/1979\n\n\nSCP-4029 unearths itself at approximately noon, causing considerable property damage and causing over 200 injuries and 100 deaths in a 20 minute period. The SCP Foundation was unable to become involved before the Egyptian military responded and set up a perimeter, but was able to erect an antimemetic barrier that prevented the knowledge of SCP-4029's existence escaping the city as a temporary containment measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/4/1979\n\n\nThe Foundation collaborated with already onsite Egyptian military to force SCP-4029 out of the city and into an area of uninhabited desert. By 11:00, SCP-4029 had been successfully routed from Aswan. A meeting is called by Site-29 to discuss containment of SCP-4029 (URA-2979 at the time), and the R&C team is divided into two groups; one to run an amnesticization and disinformation campaign in and around Aswan and one to contain SCP-4029 itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/5/1979\n\n\nAn inactive unit of MTF Upsilon-Peor\u00f0 is assigned the duty of continuously guiding SCP-4029 into remote areas of the Saharan desert. Containment Procedures are formalised, and the amnesticization campaign begins shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10/1979\n\n\nWhile SCP-4029 remains uncontained, dormant periods and its predictable nature render it manageable. Once knowledge of SCP-4029's existence is purged from the civilian population, SCP-4029 is declared a contained anomaly, and given its current designation. SCP-4029's containment remains indefinitely delicate, and containment revisions are expected as ideas arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unknown how SCP-4029 remained unexplored and uninhabited in the time since \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial's bankruptcy. SCP-4029 is not currently believed to possess memetic or antimemetic properties; however, it is suspected that some such property existed between 9/29/1929 and 10/3/1979. The theory that \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial itself may possess self-inhibiting informational qualities is under investigation, but no evidence has yet been found to support the hypothesis.\n\n\nAddendum 01-29-1980 | Exploration Log 4029-001:\n\n\n\n\nOpening Statement:\n Drone explorations ceased to reveal information on 1/1/1980. SCP-4029-1 instances, presumably\n4\n, sought out and damaged drones before expelling them through the airlock. Along with this, several drones were lost within SCP-4029 after sudden loss of communication. A task force was provisioned to carry out a manned exploration of SCP-4029.\n\n\nA research team monitored footage and recorded from within a temporary Site-4029 (no permanent Sites are able to be erected for SCP-4029 research due to its mobility) as a precaution in case recording equipment was lost.\n\n\nExploration Crew:\n Provisional Task Force Duplic-4 (\"Inner Workings\"), consisting of:\n\n\n\n\nAgent Jessica Waters; Former commander for MTF Zeta-9 and member of MTF Alpha-5, field experience directing teams in anomalous explorations.\n\n\nAgent Langdon Farmer; Navigator for MTF Zeta-9, field experience navigating anomalous locations.\n\n\nAgent John Scholz; Former member of MTF Gamma-6, experienced at navigating flooded or otherwise fluid-filled areas.\n\n\nDr. Leslie Harrington; Biochemist and paramaterial researcher.\n\n\nD-004590, former oceanic photographer incarcerated for three counts of murder. Mute.\n\n\nAgent Four-B-Mortise\n; Defector from the Church of the Broken God, receiving Foundation asylum under the condition of participating in field work. Selected here due to not requiring oxygen, and being immune to most toxic environments.\n\n\nAgent Vincent LaFerrier; Experienced agent having partaken in several fatal missions in multiple Task Forces. No relation.\n\n\n\n\nDocuments recovered from relevant areas in logs are included following respective logs. They were discovered after the following excursion. They are the only paper documents recovered to date, and some are partially legible despite water damage (represented in part by \"[\u2026]\" to aid transcription).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Initial\u00a0Recording\n\n\n\n\n\u25c4\u00a0Hide\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log IR>\n\n\n[All members' footage displays the central lobby of the building. It is illuminated by several fluorescent lamps, the majority of which are flickering or deactivated. The room shows signs of water damage (as expected), and the carpet has been removed, revealing bare wood. To the back of the room is a supply closet with the door removed, and a single unilluminated corridor]\n\n\nWaters:\n Alright, everybody ready?\n\n\nFarmer:\n Yeah.\n\n\nHarrington:\n Yeah.\n\n\nScholz:\n Yep. Ready to go.\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Yes.\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Confirmation signal]\n\n\nMortise:\n Yeah, uh, check. Good to go.\n\n\nWaters:\n Alright, glad to hear it. The plan is basic reconnaissance: find anything the preliminary drone missed, take samples \u2014 that's you, Leslie \u2014 and as we say in the business, get the hell out of dodge. Understood?\n\n\nMortise:\n We all read the briefing, yeah. In and out, right?\n\n\nWaters:\n If we're lucky, yes. This thing's technically alive, so there's no telling what might be- yes, Leslie?\n\n\nHarrington:\n Yeah, uh, just wondering. You mentioned a preliminary drone, but I didn't see any footage transcripts in the briefing materials. Was that intentional, or\u2026\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nWaters:\n Yes, you're, uh, quite right, there was no footage in the briefing materials. Essentially, complications arose, and the monitoring team were forced to abandon the equipment once the signal was lost.\n\n\nScholz:\n And so they're sending us into the meat grinder instead. \n[Chuckles]\n Brilliant.\n\n\nWaters:\n I don't think that's quite-\n\n\nMortise:\n \n[Sighs deeply]\n\n\nWaters:\n Something wrong?\n\n\nMortise:\n Hmm? Oh, y'know, first exploration an' all that.\n\n\nFarmer:\n For what it's worth, commander, I agree with the metal man. Situation gives me the chills.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nWaters:\n There's no point worrying. No reason to believe it was anything \ndangerous\n \u2014 could have been anything\u2026 a mechanical fault, a, uh, specialised anomaly that could be \nreasoned\n with. It's not unheard of. Maybe it just hates technology rather than organic beings and we'll be fine. That's a fairly common trait for anomalous intelligences.\n\n\nFarmer:\n With all due respect, ma'am, we're on the ground floor of an office block in full deep-sea exploration suits. There's more tech in here than anywhere else in a ten kilometre radius.\n\n\nWaters:\n We're in here now anyway. Not much we can do except stick it out. If nobody else has any relevant comments to make, I'm going to end the initial recording.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Obscene gesture]\n\n\nWaters:\n Alright, end log.\n\n\n<End Log IR>\n\n\n<Relevant Documents>\n\n\n\n\nDocument 4029-01:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/29/1929\n5\n\nDear Vice President R. Bentley,\n6\n\n\n\u3000\u3000Hello, Robert. I'm sorry to be making such a personal letter like this, but I think recently we've been allowing the veil of professionalism to take a little break as everyone sorts out. And besides, we know each other well enough. I'm just writing this letter to appeal to your humanity. I know, because I have been in your position, that times like this, as a boss you can let the stress make you double down on your workers. It's hard not to take your anger, your frustration, maybe your confusion, out on your underlings, so to speak, but we're all feeling it. It's weird, Rob. We all know it's weird.\n\n\u3000\u3000I guess I'm writing this not because I am afraid that you won't do your job, that things won't go as normal ever again. But that maybe we need a good transition back into normal. You don't \n[\u2026]\n just any old day. What I'm saying is that we don't need a boss right now so much as we need a leader.\n\n\u3000\u3000Please, if you could call a meeting, or something, that just assesses company morale, and gets everyone to let out their feelings \u2014 or if you could give a big, long speech about why we can and will power through this, I think that would set a lot of people at ease. I think we could all use a guiding light in these trying times.\n\n\u3000\u3000In any case, thanks for reading my letter.\n\n\nA concerned citizen,\n\n\u3000\u3000Bart Stanton\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 4029-02:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFICE CLOSED; Meet in Boardroom 8 for Morale Meeting\n\n\n\n\n\nAll employees are \nencouraged\n to participate in a stress-relieving and team-building meeting today in Boardroom 8.

The first (LaFerrier, Harrington and Scholz) is attempting to access the elevator leading to the upper floors, while the second (Waters, Mortise, Farmer and D-004590) is exploring further down the corridor]\n\n\n<Begin Log 1.1>\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n I've found the elevators.\n\n\n[Harrington and Scholz swim towards the elevator hub]\n\n\nScholz:\n You know, they always say to use the stairs in case of a fire, but they never mentioned what happens if the building is flooded.\n\n\nHarrington:\n Electrics underwater, probably not a \ngreat\n idea\u2026\n\n\nScholz:\n We've got to get up somehow. Report said it was \nmostly\n insulated, anyway.\n\n\n[The trio swim into an already open elevator]\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Preference for a floor?\n\n\nScholz:\n My lucky number's four. Why don't we try that?\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Alright, good a reason as any. \n[Pause]\n Going up!\n\n\n[LaFerrier presses the button for floor four on the console, but nothing happens. LaFerrier attempts pushing the button again, with the same result. LaFerrier holds on the \"close doors\" button. Nothing happens]\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Looks like the console's busted.\n\n\nScholz:\n Damn. Try another one?\n\n\nHarrington:\n I don't see why we should. They're likely all busted.\n\n\n[Harrington swims to the top of the elevator and opens the escape hatch]\n\n\nHarrington:\n Woah.\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n What is it?\n\n\n[Harrington swims through the top of the hatch]\n\n\nHarrington:\n You're going to want to look for yourself.\n\n\n[LaFerrier and Scholz follow Harrington through the hatch. The inside of the elevator shaft is unlit, but the team's flashlights illuminate a tangle of thin plastic tubes extending upwards into the shaft, hindering visibility]\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Woah indeed\u2026\n\n\nScholz:\n That explains why the elevators don't work anymore. Doesn't matter, we can swim it.\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Heh, doesn't look like any other choice. Still floor four?\n\n\nScholz:\n If we're not blocked. If we are, we'll shoot for the highest floor we can get to.\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n Makes sense. Alright.\n\n\n[The group begins to swim upwards, into the mass of tubes. Soon in, the tubes become dense enough that each member has to hold onto one another to avoid losing track. The team continue swimming upwards in silence for approximately three minutes]\n\n\nScholz:\n Do you feel, like, waves?\n\n\nHarrington:\n Now you mention it, yes. Like something's moving around above us.\n\n\nScholz:\n Reckon we should\u2026\n\n\nLaFerrier:\n We're up this far, and I don't much fancy swimming back down. Let's at least see what's making the movements.\n\n\nScholz:\n It looks like\u2026 an empty space? Leslie, shine your flashlight up to that corner for a moment?\n\n\n[The area above and to the side of the shaft is partially illuminated, revealing a large empty area, upwards of 25 metres in width. Scholz approaches and peers through; cameras observe a network of walkways, at the centre of which is a white sack (diameter ~14 metres) being rhythmically compressed by a complex series of mechanical appendages. Plastic tubes extend from the top of the sack and either enter the elevator shafts, which open against one wall of the area, or connect directly to the SCP-4029-1 instances operating the machinery. The area does not appear to have a floor, and the space below is unilluminated]\n\n\nHarrington:\n Holy shit.\n\n\n<End Log 1.1>\n\n\n<Relevant Documents>\n\n\n\n\nDocument 4029-03:\n\n\n\n\nDocument 4029-03 appears to be a blueprint for the plastic air sack in the empty space in floors 4 and 5 of SCP-4029. At the bottom of the blueprint is the following note:\n\n\n\n\nAre we sure this is going to work? And if it does, will it do what we want it to do? What \ndo\n we want it to do? What's its function? Why am I making this? What's the point?\n\n\n\n\n<End Relevant Documents>\n\n\n<Begin Log 1.2>\n\n\n[Agent Mortise's head-mounted camera shows a large, open room with an estimated 200 SCP-4029-1 instances. The room is largely unlit and so visuals are minimal, but each instance has a small electric light surgically implanted in its forehead. The SCP-4029-1 instances do not react to Mortise's presence]\n\n\nMortise:\n Commander? Farmer? D-, uh, D-Class?\n\n\nWaters:\n What's up?\n\n\nMortise:\n There's a room here, filled with\u2026 people. Dash ones, I reckon.\n\n\nWaters:\n Jackpot. Nice work, we'll make a Field Agent out of you yet. Farmer, you got the flares?\n\n\nFarmer:\n Yep. Ready to go.\n\n\nWaters:\n Alright, D, I want you to stand at the entrance there and get ready to investigate. We have no idea how they'll react.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nWaters:\n D-004590?\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Eye roll, thumbs up]\n\n\nWaters:\n Good. Mortise stand back, and Farmer: get ready to throw that flare.\n\n\nFarmer:\n Primed and ready, Commander.\n\n\nWaters:\n Throw!\n\n\n[The flare slowly arcs across the room and lands on the desk of one SCP-4029-1 instance, who reacts, jumping from their desk and swimming across the room towards the Agents. Others nearby turn their heads briefly, and one other moves to their feet, but they are otherwise unresponsive]\n\n\nFarmer:\n We've got a runner. D, get ready to snap them.\n\n\n[The entity (visually identified as Robert Taylor, an intern hired by \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Industrial prior to the company's collapse and reported missing in 1929) makes it halfway across the room before stumbling. They begin to clutch at their throat, and the two individuals closest move from their seats to restrain them. After around two minutes, the first instance goes limp and floats in place. The others return to their work-stations]\n\n\nMortise:\n Jesus.\n\n\n[The other SCP-4029-1 instances drop the restrained instance and return to their seats. No further activity is observed]\n\n\nWaters:\n D, could you-\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Dismissive hand-wave, thumbs up]\n\n\n[D-004590 begins photographing and taking samples from the body\n8\n, while Mortise and Waters investigate the rest of the room. Farmer remains by the entrance, logging details of the event]\n\n\n[11 minutes pass without incident]\n\n\nMortise:\n Nothing especially weird over here. Corridor leading off, a couple aircon units pumping out more of this dark stuff.\n\n\nWaters:\n Same here. What about you, Farmer?\n\n\nFarmer:\n Still filling out the paperwork. Who knows when we might get another chance. \n[Pause]\n Well, fuck.\n\n\nWaters:\n Language, please. This is still official. What's the problem?\n\n\nFarmer:\n The corridor back there's gone. Some dash ones blocked it up, just saw them do it. Looks like we're caught in their maze.\n\n\nMortise:\n No. No, no way. This is a normal gig inside a freaky living office block, not some bloody extra-spatial nightmare-fuel-ass labyrinth.\n\n\nWaters:\n Be that as it may-\n\n\nFarmer:\n Buck up, kiddo. They've walled us in. It's their way or no way at all. Now quit your whining and act like a man.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Stands up, motions for others to follow]\n\n\nMortise:\n I guess anything's better than back there. What is it, mate?\n\n\nD-004590:\n \n[Points upwards, mimes choking himself with his right hand]\n\n\nWaters:\n Air ducts. Looks like the ceiling here's come away slightly. Good find.\n\n\n[Waters motions for Farmer and Mortise to come closer]\n\n\nWaters:\n Watch my back, I'm gonna swim up. I want to check if we can follow the ducts to whatever's supplying the air.\n\n\nMortise:\n You want to ditch \nboth\n of our potential unexplored routes, neither of which show any chance of dark, enclosed, dangerous spaces, in favour of a crawl-space?\n\n\nWaters:\n Pretty much.\n\n\nMortise:\n I don't-\n\n\nFarmer:\n Commander? Problem. Insulation in the air ducts is\u2026 \nhighly\n esoteric.\n\n\nWaters:\n How so?\n\n\n[Farmer unhooks their external microphone from their suit and holds it up into the vent. As it enters, recording is cut off abruptly]\n\n\nWaters:\n Ah. Basically a Faraday cage. \n[Sniffs]\n Must be one hell of a weird electric field in here. Farmer, I've got the best flashlight, I'll go first.\n\n\nMortise:\n You're all insane.\n\n\nFarmer:\n Undoubtedly, but it's worked so far.
