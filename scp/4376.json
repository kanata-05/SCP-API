Both bodies are genetically and visually matching.\n1\n Wilhelm Sch\u00f6der's medical history shows that he was diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 14, with the last evaluation at the age of 22, while psychological evaluations over the course of his containment could not identify symptoms of such a condition. Schr\u00f6der is aware of this and has expressed great pride in \"getting better\" and \"just following such a simple trick\" [sic].\n\n\nAddendum SCP-4376.1 Discovery:\n SCP-4376 was discovered on 2019/06/10 on his way home from his job at an insurance company. Witness reports to the police were intercepted and a disinformation campaign, portraying it as a viral advertisement for a new horror movie, was put in place. Co-workers reported seeing Schr\u00f6der using his phone to chat during the lunch break and afterwards going to the bathroom for an unusual amount of time before emerging in his current form.
