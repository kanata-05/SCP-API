Prepare for shenanigans.\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+208\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4914\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Foundation webcrawlers have confirmed that the only copy of SCP-4914 is in Foundation custody and the hard drive containing it is to be stored in a standard anomalous items locker. Testing of SCP-4914 is permitted by researchers level 1 or higher. These tests are only to be done on remote systems lacking internet access.\n\n\nThe internet activity of SCP-4914's creator\n1\n is to be monitored for further anomalous incidents.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4914 is a modified digital copy of the video game Doom, originally released in 1993 by id Software. Unlike standard versions of Doom, SCP-4914 is 468 megabytes in size and functions from a single executable file. Upon running SCP-4914, it functions as a standard copy of Doom.\n\n\nSCP-4914-1 are anomalous growths of \nDigitaria sanguinalis\n, a species of grass commonly referred to as crabgrass. SCP-4914-1 grows directly on the motherboard of the computer SCP-4914 is run on. This growth occurs 16 hours after SCP-4914 is executed. During its growth cycle, SCP-4914-1 uses high amounts of computer processing power from any available components.\n2\n SCP-4914-1 is capable of regrowing to full maturity within 5 minutes if it is removed by any means other than the use of vinegar.\n\n\nTo date, no other alternately modified copies have been recovered.\n\n\nAddendum 4914/1:\n SCP-4914 was originally discovered after its online posting by known members of GoI '\nGamers Against Weed\n.' The following are chat logs documenting SCP-4914's creation and initial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Access\u00a0Chat\u00a0Logs\u00a0/\u00a0Excerpt\u00a01\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0Logs\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBingledorf:\n but
