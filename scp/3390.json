This door is to be kept under observation until protocol violet has been completed.\n\n\nWhat remains of Site-99 Floor B19 is to be considered temporary containment zone 617\u03b1 and is for the exclusive containment of SCP-3390 until it can be removed and secured in a more permanent containment location. All personnel and equipment on this floor are to be considered irretrievable.\n\n\nStandard containment procedures regarding Breach Level and Temporary Containment scenarios are to be followed in the addition that no personnel with Germanic heritage, within two generations, are to enter Site-99 nor are any personnel to make disparaging remarks in regards to the performance of the French military forces, or the nation of France in general.\n\n\nIn the event of a failure of temporary containment, the three members of foundation personnel assigned to the monitoring of SCP-3390 are to remain behind until the containment status of SCP-3390 can be confirmed. Otherwise, standard evacuation protocols are to be observed.\n\n\nDescription:\n Due to the nature in which it is contained SCP-3390 has been able to evade all attempts at a full examination. As a result, all information pertaining to the description of SCP-3390, both physically and in reference to its anomalous effects are entirely through physical observation via eyewitness reports and security camera footage.\n\n\nSCP-3390 is a large mechanical construct that is superficially identical to a Char2C Armoured Fighting vehicle, or tank, manufactured 1919 and constructed by the Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (FCM) company for the French Armed Forces during the period of the First World War.\n\n\nSCP-3390 is approximately 4 meters high, 10 meters in length, 3 meters in width and is expected to be at least 70 tonnes in weight. It is painted in a dark green color typical of French Army forest camouflage schemes of the period and is showing signs of wear and tear that can be assumed to be from age and lack of maintenance.\n\n\nPrior to Incident 3390-1, the anomalous effects of SCP-3390 were unrecorded. It remained in an inactive state and was contained within a standard vehicle containment garage at the Site-99 underground motor-pool pending classification.\n\nFollowing incident 3390-1 SCP-3390 was observed via closed circuit security cameras until power to floor B19 was lost.\n\n\nAddendum: Incident Reports\n\n\nIncident-3390-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Foundation Site-99\n\n\nSCP-3390\n\n\nIncident Number\n: 3390-1\n\n\nDate:\n 18th September 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Incident:\n Events leading to SCP-3390's current containment conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of events\n\n4:35am\n\nSecurity Camera footage observing SCP-3390 at Section D of the underground containment motor-pool at Site-99 notes two members of security personnel, identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, patrolling the area stopping to observe SCP-3390. The remote mic picks up the two discussing Second World War history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:41am\n\nGuards return to their patrol route continuing to discuss history. One of the guards identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 utters the words \"Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys\", a common insult directed at the performance of the French forces during World War Two, at which point the engine of SCP-3390 turns over. Both guards are seen turning in confusion and SCP-3390 accelerates towards them.\n\nCause of death to both guards was through crushing injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:42am\n\nSCP-3390 continues moving on an eastern trajectory, it enters the D-block staff carpark at 4:44 am after breaching the secondary containment wall of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It pauses for exactly 2 minutes and opens fire 4 times with the 75mm cannon located in the main frontal turret, destroying several vehicles. Reason for this is currently under investigation.\n\nDetails of destroyed vehicles are listed here:\n\nPersonal vehicle of Dr. Lambart Steel, BMW X5 Black\n\nPersonal vehicle of Dr. Andrew Shepard, Volkswagen Golf White\n\nPersonal vehicle of O-class Micheal Brown, Audi A3 Yellow\n\nSite-99 Utility Vehicle, Unimog U4000 Orange\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:43am\n\nContainment Alarm is sounded, Site-99 begins evacuation protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:46am\n\nSCP-3390 continues moving on an eastern trajectory in a straight line. It penetrates the inner wall of the facility and enters corridor 44/B partially destroying Site-99's D-Lab block resulting in the deaths of \u2588\u2588 Personnel and injuring \u2588\u2588 others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:50am\n\nSCP-3390 has accelerated to a speed of 31kph and continues to move through the facility with complete disregard for any objects or persons in its way. SCP-3390 Demonstrates the capability to drive through solid objects beyond the expected capability for a machine of its design and period including concrete barricades, thick metal walls, and solid steel doors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:52am\n\nSCP-3390 penetrates D-Lab blast door, now entering Section F staff cafeteria.\n\nSecurity Personnel are witnessed opening fire using standard weaponry, SCP-3390 appears undamaged and returns fire.\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\nResulting blast weakens structure around staff cafeteria causing part of section F to collapse. SCP-3390 is witnessed falling with the collapse.\n\nSCP-3390 continues downwards through the facility, coming to a rest at Floor B19\n\nCurrent containment protocols were initiated\n\n\n\n\nObservation Notes\n\n\n\n\n[LEVEL-4\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0REQUIRED]\n\n\n\n\n[ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@SCPFoundation.com\n\nFrom \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@SCPFoundation.com\n\nDate: 5:01 am \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\nSubject: You [EXPLETIVE DELETED]\n\nYou [EXPLETIVE DELETED]!

The camera was not mounted in a position where it able to ascertain how SCP-3390 was able to do this. After several moments Freight elevator becomes active and descends to floor B19.\n\nUpon Arrival SCP-3390 enters the elevator and attempts to activate it before power to the entire floor is manually cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:12 am Camera, now on battery power, notes a large mechanical sounding scream followed by a series of violent explosions. Dust and smoke obscure the camera lens. SCP-3390 is not sighted and no further sounds are recorded for seven hours by which point battery expires and camera ceases operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\u00a0pm Probe camera mounted to a small robot sent to ascertain the status of SCP-3390 and locate any survivors.\n\nAfter initiating standard sweep SCP-3390 was discovered still within freight elevator. SCP-3390 was motionless however service panel to the elevator was open and the floor was scattered with various Foundation equipment, most notably batteries.

This report also claimed that SCP-3390 appeared to be \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nReasons for this are, again, not understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident-3390-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Foundation Site-99\n\n\nSCP-3390\n\n\nIncident Number\n: 3390-2\n\n\nDate:\n 20th July 20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 3:45 am GMT, PA system of Site-99 was briefly activated, a single message in a low pitched French accent was played before personnel were able to shut-off the system.\n\nRecording of the message follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[AUDIO LOG BEGINS]\n\nBient\u00f4t nous partons.

We're making a run for the hole it made when it fell through. Maybe there is enough debris we can climb up to floor 18 or maybe we can find a ladder or something. And after we get up there I think we've all agreed we're coming to your office to have a little \"discussion\". P.S I don't know what song. Some french shit I dunno, I'll sing it to you when I get there.",

The hole was blocked by debris, we tried clearing some of it but that thing just came at us again. I think I'm the only one left now, I think it knows it too. It's weird, every time I see it I get a sense of purpose from it like it knows what it's doing. It's stupid I know but I just can't help shake the feeling we're dealing with something intelligent here. Look I'm sorry for what I said but please, it's guarding the blast door now, if I can slip past it I can sneak up the stairs.",

It broke down the door to the freight elevator but the power was out, it kept trying to do something to the panel but I couldn't see what. I'm going to try approaching it, if it is intelligent it can be reasoned with. Also I broke open one of the vending machines for food, feel free to put my ass on disciplinary for that.",
