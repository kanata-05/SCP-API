There are no plans to revive testing of SCP-2950, due to the need to use resources more efficiently.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2950 is a metal folding chair. SCP-2950\u2019s anomalous effect causes those who sit in it to experience elevated levels of comfort that do not correspond to chairs of similar composition and style.\n\n\nIndividuals that sit in SCP-2950 report that they feel as if they need to sit in the chair constantly, and are often hostile when asked to leave their position.\n\n\nTesting has indicated that the longer an individual sits in SCP-2950, the more difficult it is to remove said individual. Subjects who sit in the chair for longer than 30 minutes cannot be removed from the chair without the use of force. Subjects who sit in the chair for longer than one hour cannot be coerced into leaving the chair.\n\n\n\n\ndArkN3ss201\u00a0f4l1S-Identity\u00a0Recognized\n\n\n\n\nl1ghT521\u00a0pR3vaiLs-Opening\u00a0Access\u00a0to\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the new O5-6,\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen this document before, and are wondering why you can now see this new addition, it\u2019s because you\u2019re the only person inoculated with the anti-cognitohazard capable of allowing you to see this. Nobody, not RAISA, not the researchers, not even the other O5s can see this. They\u2019ve got their own little projects to deal with anyways.\n\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably guessed, there are things that are below the surface in this big place we call work. You\u2019ve always wondered about the layers hidden behind the documents, and there\u2019s a reason why they exist: certain infohazards are more dangerous than others. Some are so dangerous that only a few people can ever know about them.\n\n\nAnd sometimes, that number is one.\n\n\nSCP-2950, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, is not simply a very comfortable chair. That\u2019s what we (and by we, I mean you and I) want people to think.\n\n\nSCP-2950 is a Keter-class entity that cannot be defined.

And so it was.\n\n\nIn the process, the Serpent\u2019s Hand drained themselves trying to stop us from getting that book. We never understood, and most of them didn\u2019t either. There were few who had the knowledge to tell us the truth, but they only told us when it was far too late.\n\n\nA secret meeting saw the O5s and the \nSerpent\u2019s Hand\n discussing what SCP-2950 was. They showed us their books and their stories that gave us what we needed to know. A lot of us were skeptical.
