Containment Team CT-4773 are to remain on standby during the initial Preliminary Analysis phase of containment, which is ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4773-2 is a brown, stuffed bear composed of synthetic fur and cotton. SCP-4773-2 will periodically levitate between 10 and 70 centimetres from the ground, and move in irregular patterns. Objects, entities, and surfaces near SCP-4773-2 may be wholly or partially imperceptible. This is considered normal behaviour.\n\n\nDue to events, it is suspected that the anomaly possesses some secondary mind-affecting effects. \nThis has been conclusively disproved.\n \nThis is considered \nnormal\n behaviour.\n See below.\n\n\nTentative Description:\n The following properties which may or may not relate to circumstances surrounding SCP-4773-2 are currently unconfirmed.
