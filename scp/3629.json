To reduce risks to secrecy or of situations like Incident 3629-1, these encounters will be arranged through a Foundation-designed service which will include surreptitious surveillance software to detect and interfere with any attempts to publicize information about the S\u2019kakithi.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3629 is a pattern of interactions between a small community of humans in New York City and certain individuals among the subterranean S\u2019kakithi population\n1\n in that vicinity. These respective parties voluntarily seek each other on dating applications, most frequently Tinder, for the purposes of paraphilic sexual activities.\n\n\nLike many smaller spiders, the S\u2019kakithi have substantially larger females than males, and the males, which are non-sapient, are frequently instinctively killed and consumed during or immediately after mating. To lessen the risk of this, the males tie the females up with their silk, and so in at least 70% of natural matings, the male survives. Because it is a part of the mating process, S\u2019kakithi females find being bound highly pleasurable. To avoid depleting their own population of males, some S\u2019kakithi engage in sexual activities with humans, and SCP-3629 refers to this interspecies cooperation. Humans, being approximately the size of a S\u2019kakithi female and not biochemically similar to their prey or their males, are resistant to S\u2019kakithi venom, and indeed experience euphoric hallucinations when injected with it.\n\n\nTo facilitate these encounters and meet proficient and interested humans, S\u2019kakithi create profiles on dating applications, with an estimated 2100 profiles on Tinder and only about 150 distributed across OKCupid, Fetlife, and ChristianMingle. As the S\u2019kakithi know that humans are not generally aware of their existence, these profiles do not explicitly identify the S\u2019kakithi as such.\n\n\nThe humans involved in SCP-3629 are drawn primarily from the New York City bondage community. These individuals are informally vetted by both the S\u2019kakithi and established members of this community, and are instructed in relevant information regarding the non-humanoid physiology of the S\u2019kakithi. It is believed that 90 humans have taken part in SCP-3629.\n\n\nSCP-3629 came to the Foundation\u2019s attention in February 2018 as a result of Incident 3629-1, after S\u2019kakithi investigators contacted the Foundation regarding a case they believed involved a human, in which S\u2019kakithi had gone missing after participating in SCP-3629. Some relevant documents are reproduced below.\n\n\nInterview 3629-3:\n To learn about SCP-3629 from a human perspective, on February 16, 2018, Agent Sebastian Allen interviewed Manny Li, whom the S\u2019kakithi had identified as a regular participant in SCP-3629. He was not believed to be a suspect in the disappearances, nor was he believed to have any knowledge of the anomalous outside of the context of SCP-3629. Also present at the interview was Investigator Chisithrita, the S\u2019kakithi liaison on the case. Note that as they are unable to vocalize English, S\u2019kakithi communicate by text.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Mr. Li, I\u2019m glad you could make it. We\u2019d like to ask you some questions about the Silkmaster community.\n\n\nManny Li:\n That\u2019s\u2026 Uh, I\u2019m sorry, officer, but I can\u2019t talk about that.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Are you worried about retaliation? My branch of NYPD liaisons with and addresses problems among New York City\u2019s\u2026 less traditional inhabitants, including the S\u2019kakithi. We have reason to believe a crime has been committed, and anything you can tell us will help.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Okay, so you know, but do they know you know? I\u2019ve never heard of the Special Crimes Posting. Do they know about you guys?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I believe I may be able to allay your concerns.\n\n\nAllen leaves the room and returns with Investigator Chisithrita\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n This is Chisithrita, our S\u2019kakithi contact in this case. She can remain here while we talk to confirm that I don\u2019t ask you about anything they\u2019d rather us not hear about.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00Hi there Manny! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nI\u2019m basically a spider cop\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nSebastian and his people are good people, and they are helping us with our investigation. Explain to them the trysts you have with our people.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Well, as Chisithrita says, I\u2014 Look, how much do you already know about this?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Only the basics, but we\u2019d like to know more about the group and how you got into this. We\u2019ve been in contact with them for a long time, but the S\u2019kakithi tend to share information only when they think it\u2019s relevant.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\ude09We like our discretion. But tell them.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Okay. I\u2019d been a part of the kink community for a while, both here and in Portland. Tom and Diane organize a lot of events for the local scene, and at one of these a year or so ago, Diane asked me to try a session with her where I tied her up according to some very specific and weird instructions and with something like a dozen tarantulas crawling on us. Screening, you see.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Forgive me, Investigator, but Manny, I would think a lot of people have problems dealing with the S\u2019kakithi? Tarantulas are quite a bit smaller.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Yeah, a few people drop out when they meet the S\u2019kakithi, but by that point they\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy. That\u2019s actually the other way I was vetted. Tom told me something \u2014 false, as it turns out \u2014 but explosive and told me not to tell anyone about it. That I didn\u2019t is why I had the spider scene with Diane.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Sensible. So what happened after they decided to bring you in?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Well, first understand that the scenes I\u2019ve been in are usually pretty tailored to an individual. But there\u2019s still commonalities, patterns \u2014 how to tie someone so they can breathe and won\u2019t have joint issues, establishing safewords, the sorts of materials and toys, how to end the session. That\u2019s all different with the S\u2019kakithi. Diane showed me the various binds on a volunteer, I think Irishis, as well as how to use webbing, and the safer ways to get a hit of venom from an aroused S\u2019kakithi. Better for her, too, so she doesn\u2019t sit around tied up too long.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nOoh, Irishis! She\u2019s a bit \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Sorry, getting a hit of venom? How is that safe?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Safe enough, and absolutely worth it. That stuff is just beyond anything else. Yeah, a couple inches of fangs going into you has its risks. But they patch up the punctures as if they were never there.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Investigator, you\u2019re using your medicine on random civilians?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nI\u2019m so sorry. Should we leave them riddled with holes? Or would you prefer we ate them?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n You know very well what we\u2019d prefer\u2026\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\ude1b\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n We can leave that. Manny, Mr. Li, tell me about how you arrange these encounters.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Tinder.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Tinder? Public-facing Tinder, where anyone, totally unvetted, could talk with one of the S\u2019kakithi?\n\n\nManny Li:\n I guess, but it\u2019s not like they have real photos or say \u201cHey, I\u2019m a giant spider\u201d.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWe have our own laws.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nIf they follow the Way of Chalt\u2019tiri, we\u2019ll follow the Tinder Terms of Service\n\n\nManny Li:\n There\u2019s other cues, like the picture being some woman with a spider tattoo or with spiders crawling on her \u2014 some of these are from the scene; Diane appears a bunch \u2014 and these days they\u2019ll usually say \u201cSilkmaiden\u201d somewhere on the profile. That\u2019s I guess what\u2019s become the name for this community, Silkmasters and Silkmaidens, though I guess you know about that. With us, we\u2019ll sometimes say \u201cSilkmaster\u201d, but personally I found that attracted questions when I\u2019m surfing for normal humans so I mostly use the chat to let them know that I\u2019m on the inside. I do make clear I\u2019m pretty into bondage though, which gets the S\u2019kakithi to swipe right and avoids incompatible humans.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I see. Are you usually able to find a match?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Always. This is really popular with the S\u2019kakithi, so there\u2019s tons of them for each of us.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\u261d\ufe0fYou stay on. We don\u2019t.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWe stay satisfied. But you humans are so horny!\ud83d\ude18\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nA whole species of Irishises\n\n\nManny Li:\n Okay, yes, that reduces the imbalance. Every S\u2019kakithi I\u2019ve met with drops off Tinder. I think they come back on eventually, but we\u2019re talking like a year.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Do you ever remain in touch with one of your dates to continue social relations?\n\n\nManny Li:\n No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m on Tinder for.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n So these dates, where do they take place?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Their place, usually.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nSebastian, we take them no further underground than we take you.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Yeah, there\u2019s elevators or fireman\u2019s poles or something. They have these hidden trapdoors all over. I meet with the night\u2019s partner at one of those, she grabs hold of me, then we fall, fall, fall. It\u2019s not dark down there, but I don\u2019t know what the lights are. Officer, it\u2019s vast.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Please continue.\n\n\nManny Li:\n Their homes, those I can understand. You\u2019d expect giant webs, but they\u2019re more like our houses, only in caves. Most of the appliances I recognized. I guess if you can use Tinder, you can use Amazon. I do the session with my date, and I\u2019ll usually spend the night, since the venom takes a while to wear off. In the morning, she drops me off wherever I need to be. Handy for getting to work.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Could you meet above ground if you wanted?\n\n\nManny Li:\n In some places. The first place I met one of the S\u2019kakithi was in the studio, and I\u2019ve done a scene or two there. I gather Leo has a tunnel into his basement. But my apartment would be completely impossible \u2014 I\u2019m on the sixth floor, and the S\u2019kakithi are pretty serious about their privacy. Diane makes sure we don\u2019t do anything that might bring them down on us. We add her on social media, share our Tinder password, clear any photos related to the scene before putting them up. But it\u2019s better than what the S\u2019kakithi do \u2014 sorry, Investigator. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to talk to you about this; I\u2019ve heard of people who just shared photos vanishing. They said we couldn\u2019t even tell our families.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nIt can\u2019t be allowed.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nThey do live. We\u2019re not monsters.\ud83d\udc7f\n\n\nManny Li:\n Officer, you said there had been a crime. What is this about?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Mr. Li, do you believe you could remove a S\u2019kakithi from her home to the surface?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nNot possible\n\n\nManny Li:\n I agree. Maybe if she was already pretty well-bound, I could move her, but up a vertical shaft? I don\u2019t think I could make it back up myself, even if I did know the way.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWhat about an ambush on being picked up or dropped off?\n\n\nManny Li:\n In most of my sessions, my date resists being tied up, but that\u2019s playacting, half-fighting. I couldn\u2019t subdue a truly uncooperative S\u2019kakithi. Maybe with friends? Or weapons? But I\u2019ve seen shed exoskeletal plates, and they\u2019re really tough. Even with a gun, I don\u2019t think I could stop her from at least getting back underground. Have S\u2019kakithi been going missing?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nYes\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude22\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Fine, we can tell him. So that leaves\u2026 Unless, Investigator, could they still be somewhere in your city?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWe would know.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nAssuming it is a human responsible, none of you could foil our methods.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Let\u2019s stick with that assumption for now. Mr. Li, it then seems that the only point of vulnerability would be during a session on the surface. Do you know of anyone who preferred to have their dates up here?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Maybe. As I said, a few people with ground level homes have passages in \u2014 Leo, Colleen, Muhammed, probably more \u2014 and I think Benjamin K is a claustrophobe, so he mostly meets at the studio. So yeah, him. But almost always we go under. Look, mood and atmosphere are really important for this kind of thing, and it\u2019s just not the same here.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I think I see. Have you noticed any unusual behavior by any of your friends lately?\n\n\nManny Li:\n Nothing unusual for them.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I believe that\u2019s everything, then. Investigator, do you have any further questions for Mr. Li?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\ude01Thank you so much for helping, Manny!\ud83d\ude01\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nSebastian may want to interrogate you further at some later point.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nI may want to meet you again for other reasons.\ud83d\ude09\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nIf I\u2019m not too forthright in asking, what\u2019s your profile name?\n\n\n\n\nManny Li:\n On Tinder? Geez, okay. It\u2019s \u201cHungManny\u201d.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nI\u2019ll keep my eyes out!\ud83d\ude01\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f (\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f)\n\n\n\n\nInterview 3629-6:\n On February 27, 2018, IAC gave the Foundation access to Tinder chat logs for human participants in SCP-3629 and for the missing S\u2019kakithi, in accordance with the plans from Interview 3629-5. Agent Sebastian Allen met with S\u2019kakithi Investigators Chisithrita and Iskeran on March 1, 2018 to discuss the findings.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Good morning, Investigator Iskeran, Investigator Chisithrita. Tinder finally turned over the logs.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWonderful! \ud83d\ude03 Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \n\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd0e\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Right, I guess we\u2019ll start off with the last to go missing. Let me know if you\u2019re having trouble seeing the screen. Here\u2019s the log for K\u2019taithar. She met with SeventhWalrus \u2014 okay, I guess for the mustache \u2014 which seems to be the account of one Eric Thierse.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nI\u2019ve seen the name.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nBut not one I\u2019ve met.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nHe looks strong. \ud83d\udcaa Could he be a web?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nI mean, bait?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nThe name has been there for a long time.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I don\u2019t think so. He seems to have an account history, and I\u2019d like to assume for now that our kidnapper isn\u2019t able to edit Tinder\u2019s files.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nLiaisons with both our kinds. I don\u2019t know this SeventhWalrus, but I do recall Aserak being quite satisfied. \ud83e\udd2a So he\u2019s real and just started grabbing \u26d3his partners one day? Are any of his humans missing?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I don\u2019t know yet. We can look into that. Let\u2019s go back to K\u2019taithar\u2019s last meeting. Is there anything odd about these messages?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nNot that I can tell. He comes off well here. But every predator should be pleasing to her prey.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nThey met at the studio rise.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nThat\u2019s relevant. We wouldn\u2019t travel from the Rise, so that must have been where K\u2019taithar was seized.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nA definite \ud83d\udd0e. Was that where the other \ud83d\udd77 were taken?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nSebastian, let\u2019s look at more. How about Espachia?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Okay. Let\u2019s see\u2026 Her last meeting wasn\u2019t with Mr. Thierse. Espachia met with someone named Tietan. It says here her real name is \u2014\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \n\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude30\ud83e\udd2f\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Uh, what is it, Investigator?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nI MET WITH HER\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n When?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWith one of their females? \ud83e\udd22 Do you think it would be okay to start eating people as well as fucking them?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nHumans don\u2019t have true gender. They\u2019re practically identical. Both \ud83d\udeba and \ud83d\udeb9 are ignorant of the Way of Chalt\u2019tiri. I see no difference.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nThey have the Tinder Terms of Service! If you got to know them, you\u2019d see that.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nThen wouldn\u2019t their men you let bind you also be People? And you call me a pervert?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Investigators! Please, I don\u2019t understand this, but is it really relevant? Iskeran, Investigator Iskeran, you said you met with Ms. Willard-Neeson, Tietan. Was this for, uh, SCP-3629? When was this?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nYes. And my fellow Investigator will find nothing in Chalt\u2019tiri to condemn that.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nI met with her four days ago.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n That\u2019s well after Espachia vanished. Did she seem uncomfortable or anything like that? Any indicator of anything wrong, any aggressive moves against you at the surface?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nI don\u2019t know how to tell if she was uncomfortable, but she was quite satisfying.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nHow did she talk to Espachia?\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n I\u2019ll bring that up. Oh, again meeting at the studio. That\u2019s definitely a theme.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nWe met at a Rise near her \ud83c\udfe0.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Are all of these meetings at the studio? Mind if I scroll through?\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83e\udd14Go right ahead.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Ikla\u2019akti disappeared after meeting RebelStar929\u2026 at the studio. Sichariti disappeared after meeting LionManWaistDown\u2026 at the studio. Chik\u2014\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\udd0eIs LionManWaistDown named Leo?\ud83d\udd0e\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Leonel Simcoe, yes.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWe built a rise to Leo\u2019s house. He is in touch with the ground. There\u2019s no reason he\u2019d ask to meet at the studio.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n That seems to be where all the abductions have happened. We can search the place, but perhaps there\u2019s something there necessary for subduing the victims.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI don\u2019t think so. Sebastian, Investigator Iskeran, might Leo and these others be imitated?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nA deception? It shouldn\u2019t be. Agent Allen, go back to the conversation between Espachia and Tietan.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Sure.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nDoes not this remind you of SeventhWalrus\u2019s approach?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nThis was not how Tietan spoke to me.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \n\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udd78\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83e\udde0Oh, good thinking, Investigator! \ud83e\udde0 Show your conversation with Tietan to us.\ud83d\ude09\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n We have experts on writing styles. I\u2019m not one myself, but I can contact one.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nYou are a human. If Iskeran thought she saw a difference, you\u2019re sure to.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nMy personal correspondences are not supposed to be a part of the case!\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nBut I can show Agent Allen.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n Okay, yes, that\u2019s definitely different than the Espachia conversation. Unless she forgot how to capitalize letters between talking to Espachia and to you. Okay, I think that\u2019s a good working hypothesis. Somehow, someone is getting onto the Tinder accounts of humans involved with 3629 and setting up meetings with S\u2019kakithi at the studio, where\u2026 what? We got stuck here when Manny was here too, Chisithrita. Shouldn\u2019t the victim realize that it\u2019s not her date there and bolt back underground?\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nNo.\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nYou look the same.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83e\udd2b\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nMore diplomatically, you look human.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \nWhen you\u2019re together, I can tell you apart \u2014 you have different clothes, skin, hair, size \u2014 but alone, it\u2019s harder. Especially since you change your appearance so much!\n\n\nInvestigator Iskeran:\n \nShe may have let herself be bound by someone else.\n\n\nAgent Allen:\n And then unable to free herself when they showed their true colors.\n\n\nInvestigator Chisithrita:\n \n\ud83d\ude25We have stories like that. Some are romantic \u2764\ufe0f when the hero finds her binder is a shimmering drone with thick silk instead of the shedding old lurker who\u2019d been around her nest. But in real life?

        "Agent Allen: Mr. Li, I\u2019m glad you could make it. We\u2019d like to ask you some questions about the Silkmaster community. Manny Li: That\u2019s\u2026 Uh, I\u2019m sorry, officer, but I can\u2019t talk about that. Agent Allen: Are you worried about retaliation? My branch of NYPD liaisons with and addresses problems among New York City\u2019s\u2026 less traditional inhabitants, including the S\u2019kakithi. We have reason to believe a crime has been committed, and anything you can tell us will help. Manny Li: Okay, so you know, but do they know you know? I\u2019ve never heard of the Special Crimes Posting. Do they know about you guys? Agent Allen: I believe I may be able to allay your concerns. Allen leaves the room and returns with Investigator Chisithrita Agent Allen: This is Chisithrita, our S\u2019kakithi contact in this case. She can remain here while we talk to confirm that I don\u2019t ask you about anything they\u2019d rather us not hear about. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00Hi there Manny! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 Investigator Chisithrita: I\u2019m basically a spider cop\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian and his people are good people, and they are helping us with our investigation. Explain to them the trysts you have with our people. Manny Li: Well, as Chisithrita says, I\u2014 Look, how much do you already know about this? Agent Allen: Only the basics, but we\u2019d like to know more about the group and how you got into this. We\u2019ve been in contact with them for a long time, but the S\u2019kakithi tend to share information only when they think it\u2019s relevant. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude09We like our discretion. But tell them. Manny Li: Okay. I\u2019d been a part of the kink community for a while, both here and in Portland. Tom and Diane organize a lot of events for the local scene, and at one of these a year or so ago, Diane asked me to try a session with her where I tied her up according to some very specific and weird instructions and with something like a dozen tarantulas crawling on us. Screening, you see. Agent Allen: Forgive me, Investigator, but Manny, I would think a lot of people have problems dealing with the S\u2019kakithi? Tarantulas are quite a bit smaller. Manny Li: Yeah, a few people drop out when they meet the S\u2019kakithi, but by that point they\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy. That\u2019s actually the other way I was vetted. Tom told me something \u2014 false, as it turns out \u2014 but explosive and told me not to tell anyone about it. That I didn\u2019t is why I had the spider scene with Diane. Agent Allen: Sensible. So what happened after they decided to bring you in? Manny Li: Well, first understand that the scenes I\u2019ve been in are usually pretty tailored to an individual. But there\u2019s still commonalities, patterns \u2014 how to tie someone so they can breathe and won\u2019t have joint issues, establishing safewords, the sorts of materials and toys, how to end the session. That\u2019s all different with the S\u2019kakithi. Diane showed me the various binds on a volunteer, I think Irishis, as well as how to use webbing, and the safer ways to get a hit of venom from an aroused S\u2019kakithi. Better for her, too, so she doesn\u2019t sit around tied up too long. Investigator Chisithrita: Ooh, Irishis! She\u2019s a bit \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 Agent Allen: Sorry, getting a hit of venom? How is that safe? Manny Li: Safe enough, and absolutely worth it. That stuff is just beyond anything else. Yeah, a couple inches of fangs going into you has its risks. But they patch up the punctures as if they were never there. Agent Allen: Investigator, you\u2019re using your medicine on random civilians? Investigator Chisithrita: I\u2019m so sorry. Should we leave them riddled with holes? Or would you prefer we ate them? Agent Allen: You know very well what we\u2019d prefer\u2026 Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude1b Agent Allen: We can leave that. Manny, Mr. Li, tell me about how you arrange these encounters. Manny Li: Tinder. Agent Allen: Tinder? Public-facing Tinder, where anyone, totally unvetted, could talk with one of the S\u2019kakithi? Manny Li: I guess, but it\u2019s not like they have real photos or say \u201cHey, I\u2019m a giant spider\u201d. Investigator Chisithrita: We have our own laws. Investigator Chisithrita: If they follow the Way of Chalt\u2019tiri, we\u2019ll follow the Tinder Terms of Service Manny Li: There\u2019s other cues, like the picture being some woman with a spider tattoo or with spiders crawling on her \u2014 some of these are from the scene; Diane appears a bunch \u2014 and these days they\u2019ll usually say \u201cSilkmaiden\u201d somewhere on the profile. That\u2019s I guess what\u2019s become the name for this community, Silkmasters and Silkmaidens, though I guess you know about that. With us, we\u2019ll sometimes say \u201cSilkmaster\u201d, but personally I found that attracted questions when I\u2019m surfing for normal humans so I mostly use the chat to let them know that I\u2019m on the inside. I do make clear I\u2019m pretty into bondage though, which gets the S\u2019kakithi to swipe right and avoids incompatible humans. Agent Allen: I see. Are you usually able to find a match? Manny Li: Always. This is really popular with the S\u2019kakithi, so there\u2019s tons of them for each of us. Investigator Chisithrita: \u261d\ufe0fYou stay on. We don\u2019t. Investigator Chisithrita: We stay satisfied. But you humans are so horny!\ud83d\ude18 Investigator Chisithrita: A whole species of Irishises Manny Li: Okay, yes, that reduces the imbalance. Every S\u2019kakithi I\u2019ve met with drops off Tinder. I think they come back on eventually, but we\u2019re talking like a year. Agent Allen: Do you ever remain in touch with one of your dates to continue social relations? Manny Li: No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m on Tinder for. Agent Allen: So these dates, where do they take place? Manny Li: Their place, usually. Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian, we take them no further underground than we take you. Manny Li: Yeah, there\u2019s elevators or fireman\u2019s poles or something. They have these hidden trapdoors all over. I meet with the night\u2019s partner at one of those, she grabs hold of me, then we fall, fall, fall. It\u2019s not dark down there, but I don\u2019t know what the lights are. Officer, it\u2019s vast. Agent Allen: Please continue. Manny Li: Their homes, those I can understand. You\u2019d expect giant webs, but they\u2019re more like our houses, only in caves. Most of the appliances I recognized. I guess if you can use Tinder, you can use Amazon. I do the session with my date, and I\u2019ll usually spend the night, since the venom takes a while to wear off. In the morning, she drops me off wherever I need to be. Handy for getting to work. Agent Allen: Could you meet above ground if you wanted? Manny Li: In some places. The first place I met one of the S\u2019kakithi was in the studio, and I\u2019ve done a scene or two there. I gather Leo has a tunnel into his basement. But my apartment would be completely impossible \u2014 I\u2019m on the sixth floor, and the S\u2019kakithi are pretty serious about their privacy. Diane makes sure we don\u2019t do anything that might bring them down on us. We add her on social media, share our Tinder password, clear any photos related to the scene before putting them up. But it\u2019s better than what the S\u2019kakithi do \u2014 sorry, Investigator. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to talk to you about this; I\u2019ve heard of people who just shared photos vanishing. They said we couldn\u2019t even tell our families. Investigator Chisithrita: It can\u2019t be allowed. Investigator Chisithrita: They do live. We\u2019re not monsters.\ud83d\udc7f Manny Li: Officer, you said there had been a crime. What is this about? Agent Allen: Mr. Li, do you believe you could remove a S\u2019kakithi from her home to the surface? Investigator Chisithrita: Not possible Manny Li: I agree. Maybe if she was already pretty well-bound, I could move her, but up a vertical shaft? I don\u2019t think I could make it back up myself, even if I did know the way. Investigator Chisithrita: What about an ambush on being picked up or dropped off? Manny Li: In most of my sessions, my date resists being tied up, but that\u2019s playacting, half-fighting. I couldn\u2019t subdue a truly uncooperative S\u2019kakithi. Maybe with friends? Or weapons? But I\u2019ve seen shed exoskeletal plates, and they\u2019re really tough. Even with a gun, I don\u2019t think I could stop her from at least getting back underground. Have S\u2019kakithi been going missing? Investigator Chisithrita: Yes\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude22 Agent Allen: Fine, we can tell him. So that leaves\u2026 Unless, Investigator, could they still be somewhere in your city? Investigator Chisithrita: We would know. Investigator Chisithrita: Assuming it is a human responsible, none of you could foil our methods. Agent Allen: Let\u2019s stick with that assumption for now. Mr. Li, it then seems that the only point of vulnerability would be during a session on the surface. Do you know of anyone who preferred to have their dates up here? Manny Li: Maybe. As I said, a few people with ground level homes have passages in \u2014 Leo, Colleen, Muhammed, probably more \u2014 and I think Benjamin K is a claustrophobe, so he mostly meets at the studio. So yeah, him. But almost always we go under. Look, mood and atmosphere are really important for this kind of thing, and it\u2019s just not the same here. Agent Allen: I think I see. Have you noticed any unusual behavior by any of your friends lately? Manny Li: Nothing unusual for them. Agent Allen: I believe that\u2019s everything, then. Investigator, do you have any further questions for Mr. Li? Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude01Thank you so much for helping, Manny!\ud83d\ude01 Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian may want to interrogate you further at some later point. Investigator Chisithrita: I may want to meet you again for other reasons.\ud83d\ude09 Investigator Chisithrita: If I\u2019m not too forthright in asking, what\u2019s your profile name? Manny Li: On Tinder? Geez, okay. It\u2019s \u201cHungManny\u201d. Investigator Chisithrita: I\u2019ll keep my eyes out!\ud83d\ude01 Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f (\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f)",
        "Agent Allen: Good morning, Investigator Iskeran, Investigator Chisithrita. Tinder finally turned over the logs. Investigator Chisithrita: Wonderful! \ud83d\ude03 Let\u2019s take a look. Investigator Iskeran: \ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd0e Agent Allen: Right, I guess we\u2019ll start off with the last to go missing. Let me know if you\u2019re having trouble seeing the screen. Here\u2019s the log for K\u2019taithar. She met with SeventhWalrus \u2014 okay, I guess for the mustache \u2014 which seems to be the account of one Eric Thierse. Investigator Iskeran: I\u2019ve seen the name. Investigator Iskeran: But not one I\u2019ve met. Investigator Chisithrita: He looks strong. \ud83d\udcaa Could he be a web? Investigator Chisithrita: I mean, bait? Investigator Iskeran: The name has been there for a long time. Agent Allen: I don\u2019t think so. He seems to have an account history, and I\u2019d like to assume for now that our kidnapper isn\u2019t able to edit Tinder\u2019s files. Investigator Chisithrita: Liaisons with both our kinds. I don\u2019t know this SeventhWalrus, but I do recall Aserak being quite satisfied. \ud83e\udd2a So he\u2019s real and just started grabbing \u26d3his partners one day? Are any of his humans missing? Agent Allen: I don\u2019t know yet. We can look into that. Let\u2019s go back to K\u2019taithar\u2019s last meeting. Is there anything odd about these messages? Investigator Chisithrita: Not that I can tell. He comes off well here. But every predator should be pleasing to her prey. Investigator Chisithrita: They met at the studio rise. Investigator Iskeran: That\u2019s relevant. We wouldn\u2019t travel from the Rise, so that must have been where K\u2019taithar was seized. Investigator Iskeran: A definite \ud83d\udd0e. Was that where the other \ud83d\udd77 were taken? Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian, let\u2019s look at more. How about Espachia? Agent Allen: Okay. Let\u2019s see\u2026 Her last meeting wasn\u2019t with Mr. Thierse. Espachia met with someone named Tietan. It says here her real name is \u2014 Investigator Iskeran: \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude30\ud83e\udd2f Agent Allen: Uh, what is it, Investigator? Investigator Iskeran: I MET WITH HER Agent Allen: When? Investigator Chisithrita: With one of their females? \ud83e\udd22 Do you think it would be okay to start eating people as well as fucking them? Investigator Iskeran: Humans don\u2019t have true gender. They\u2019re practically identical. Both \ud83d\udeba and \ud83d\udeb9 are ignorant of the Way of Chalt\u2019tiri. I see no difference. Investigator Chisithrita: They have the Tinder Terms of Service! If you got to know them, you\u2019d see that. Investigator Iskeran: Then wouldn\u2019t their men you let bind you also be People? And you call me a pervert? Agent Allen: Investigators! Please, I don\u2019t understand this, but is it really relevant? Iskeran, Investigator Iskeran, you said you met with Ms. Willard-Neeson, Tietan. Was this for, uh, SCP-3629? When was this? Investigator Iskeran: Yes. And my fellow Investigator will find nothing in Chalt\u2019tiri to condemn that. Investigator Iskeran: I met with her four days ago. Agent Allen: That\u2019s well after Espachia vanished. Did she seem uncomfortable or anything like that? Any indicator of anything wrong, any aggressive moves against you at the surface? Investigator Iskeran: I don\u2019t know how to tell if she was uncomfortable, but she was quite satisfying. Investigator Chisithrita: How did she talk to Espachia? Agent Allen: I\u2019ll bring that up. Oh, again meeting at the studio. That\u2019s definitely a theme. Investigator Iskeran: We met at a Rise near her \ud83c\udfe0. Agent Allen: Are all of these meetings at the studio? Mind if I scroll through? Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83e\udd14Go right ahead. Agent Allen: Ikla\u2019akti disappeared after meeting RebelStar929\u2026 at the studio. Sichariti disappeared after meeting LionManWaistDown\u2026 at the studio. Chik\u2014 Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\udd0eIs LionManWaistDown named Leo?\ud83d\udd0e Agent Allen: Leonel Simcoe, yes. Investigator Chisithrita: We built a rise to Leo\u2019s house. He is in touch with the ground. There\u2019s no reason he\u2019d ask to meet at the studio. Agent Allen: That seems to be where all the abductions have happened. We can search the place, but perhaps there\u2019s something there necessary for subduing the victims. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI don\u2019t think so. Sebastian, Investigator Iskeran, might Leo and these others be imitated? Investigator Iskeran: A deception? It shouldn\u2019t be. Agent Allen, go back to the conversation between Espachia and Tietan. Agent Allen: Sure. Investigator Iskeran: Does not this remind you of SeventhWalrus\u2019s approach? Investigator Iskeran: This was not how Tietan spoke to me. Investigator Iskeran: \ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udd78 Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83e\udde0Oh, good thinking, Investigator! \ud83e\udde0 Show your conversation with Tietan to us.\ud83d\ude09 Agent Allen: We have experts on writing styles. I\u2019m not one myself, but I can contact one. Investigator Chisithrita: You are a human. If Iskeran thought she saw a difference, you\u2019re sure to. Investigator Iskeran: My personal correspondences are not supposed to be a part of the case! Investigator Iskeran: But I can show Agent Allen. Agent Allen: Okay, yes, that\u2019s definitely different than the Espachia conversation. Unless she forgot how to capitalize letters between talking to Espachia and to you. Okay, I think that\u2019s a good working hypothesis. Somehow, someone is getting onto the Tinder accounts of humans involved with 3629 and setting up meetings with S\u2019kakithi at the studio, where\u2026 what? We got stuck here when Manny was here too, Chisithrita. Shouldn\u2019t the victim realize that it\u2019s not her date there and bolt back underground? Investigator Iskeran: No. Investigator Iskeran: You look the same. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83e\udd2b Investigator Chisithrita: More diplomatically, you look human. Investigator Chisithrita: When you\u2019re together, I can tell you apart \u2014 you have different clothes, skin, hair, size \u2014 but alone, it\u2019s harder. Especially since you change your appearance so much! Investigator Iskeran: She may have let herself be bound by someone else. Agent Allen: And then unable to free herself when they showed their true colors. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude25We have stories like that. Some are romantic \u2764\ufe0f when the hero finds her binder is a shimmering drone with thick silk instead of the shedding old lurker who\u2019d been around her nest. But in real life? By a human? \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 Agent Allen: So we want someone with access to the studio, a way to hack people\u2019s accounts, and some reason for doing this. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33I think I know who. Investigator Chisithrita: HungManny said that out of fear of our displeasure over our seclusion being spoiled, he and his fellow Silkmasters let BoundToPlease \u2014 Diane \u2014 audit their Tinder accounts. And of course she has access to the studio. Agent Allen: Yes! I think we had best bring her in for questioning. And her husband Tom too; if she is behind this, he might be as well. The two of them probably know more about you all than anyone outside the Foundation. Investigator Iskeran: Or the Global Occult Coalition. Investigator Iskeran: Or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Investigator Iskeran: Or the Leaves of Winter. Investigator Chisithrita: \ud83e\udd2b Now then, Investigator, let\u2019s leave some secrets for Sebastian to discover on his own.\ud83d\ude09",
