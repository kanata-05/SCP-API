At such time as the CHANT is returned to full functionality, translations of all \u03bd\n\u03c3\n communications by SCP-4170 are to be recorded in both the SCP database and the Dark Body database, where SCP-4170 maintains a dual-entry as 2014\nDBI\n Miriam.\n\n\nUpon completion of repairs, the CHANT is not to be used for monitoring of SCP-4170 until sufficient shielding has been installed to protect the telescope from direct attack by focused neutrino streams. As this shielding technology currently does not exist, the Foundation is to increase funding and resource allocation to the Dark Matter Astronomy department by at least 25%. These funds are to be earmarked for fast-track research and development of defenses against neutrino weaponry.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4170 is a dark-body intelligence (DBI) in circumsolar orbit with a period of 34.7 years and a semi-major axis of 10.64 AU, slightly beyond the orbit of Saturn. Calculations of mass decay rate imply that SCP-4170 is a relatively newly-formed body, having coalesced between 20 and 25 thousand years ago. In all physical respects, SCP-4170 is unremarkable among the population of known non-anomalous DBIs, with a core Higgs density of approximately 350 GeV and a Hess radius of 12 kilometers. Psychological reports indicate a moderate degree of asocial behavior and emotional volatility.\n\n\nDark matter is typically invisible and undetectable to ordinary baryonic matter (e.g. optical, x-ray, or radio telescopes) save through density measurements of the Higgs Field and detection of sterile neutrino (\u03bd\n\u03c3\n) emissions. As these dark matter astronomy techniques are not presently accessible to researchers outside the Foundation, the existence of DBIs is unknown to the general public. Conversely, though DBIs are sensitive to the powerful gravitational pull of the sun and nearby planets, there is no known mechanism by which DBIs could be cognizant of the existence of humanity. Though the Foundation has collected ample communications data from thousands of DBIs, there is no evidence that DBIs other than SCP-4170 are aware of any of the other sapient species that currently inhabit the Solar System, including \nHomo sapiens\n.\n\n\nSCP-4170 was first detected in a 2014 sky survey by the Foundation's Large Dark Matter Array, and was at that time designated 2014 DBI\n62\n by the Dark Matter Astronomy department. Detailed observation of its \u03bd\n\u03c3\n communications with other DBIs confirmed that it was at least a class-III (pseudosapient) or class-IV (sapient) intelligence, prompting assignment of the randomly-generated common designation \"2014\nDBI\n Miriam.\" Classification and renaming were delayed due to the perfunctory and terse nature of its social interactions with nearby class-III and class-IV DBIs, rendering sufficient data collection unusually challenging. Indirect evidence was collected from other DBIs to supplement the sparse dataset, an example of which is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0DBI\u00a0Communication\u00a0Log\u00a02014.83\u00a0[excerpt]\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0DBI\u00a0Communication\u00a0Log\u00a02014.83\u00a0[excerpt]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: For ease of reading, dialogue from SCP-4170 has been highlighted in \nred\n.\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Informal Greeting].

While the Foundation's discovery of extraterrestrial dark intelligence within our solar system was of great interest to researchers, current theories developed by the Foundation fully account for the evolution of sapient beings composed of dark matter. The primordial development, pseudo-neurology, language, and culture of DBIs are well-attested, and their existence is entirely compatible with our present-day understanding of the laws of nature. To date, SCP-4170 is the only DBI to be afforded an entry in the SCP database.\n\n\nPotential evidence of the anomalous nature of SCP-4170 first came to light in a conversation between SCP-4170 (2014\nDBI\n Miriam) and 2016\nDBI\n Theodore.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0DBI\u00a0Communication\u00a0Log\u00a02015.12\u00a0[excerpt]\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0DBI\u00a0Communication\u00a0Log\u00a02015.12\u00a0[excerpt]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Informal Greeting]\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Formal Greeting]\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Assertion: I have a new friend]\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Noncommittal reply]\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Assertion: My new friend is a planet]\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Noncommittal reply]\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Assertion: My new friend is Planet Three] \nTranslator's note: Earth.\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Noncommittal reply]\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Assertion: You cannot be friends with Planet Three]\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Noncommittal reply]\n\n\n2014\nDBI\n Miriam\n: [Assertion: Planet Three only talks to me]\n\n\n2016\nDBI\n Theodore\n: [Noncommittal reply]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this record, the Colorado High Accuracy Neutrino Telescope was tasked with 24-hour monitoring of 2014\nDBI\n Miriam in an effort to determine whether the DBI was in communication with a human or humans.
