After every reproduction incident, the new SCP-4456 instance is to be provided with 2,500 pounds of pure silver.\n\n\nDescription (Archived):\n SCP-4456 is an unmanned 16th-century Spanish galleon named \"\nSoy Mi Amante\n\"\n1\n. In terms of appearance, SCP-4456 is no different from ships of her model during the 1500s.\n\n\nEvery four to six days, an exact copy of SCP-4456 is generated in the nearest area of water that can hold her. If the new SCP-4456 instance is ever provided with approximately $519,000\n2\n in gold, silver, or gemstones, she will instantly disappear.\n\n\nIf an SCP-4456 instance is not supplied with sufficient resources within twenty-four hours of manifestation, she will animate and become hostile, attempting to breach containment via ramming and on-board cannons.\n\n\nAddendum 4456.1:\n During investigation into SCP-4456's origins, Foundation researchers discovered the following document, dating to circa 1500\u00a0C.E.:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a04456-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a04456-A\n\n\n\n\nNote: The following document has been translated from Spanish.\n\n\n\n\nMy Queen,\n\n\nI am filled with grief to report that the \nSoy Mi Amante\n has been struck down by unknown forces. She and her crew will be remembered as the mighty bread basket of our holy kingdom.\n\n\nHowever, I must express my concern towards her former nature. Her valiant crew would not speak of where they obtained their bounty, we only know that she carried much of it on her returns. I fear that her destruction may be the harbinger of some great and unknown force, which has tarried too long in its acceptance of our thievery. Perhaps even mightier forces are at play here, for it seems that no mortal entity could reduce such a mighty vessel as the \nSoy Mi Amante\n to mere ash in moments.\n\n\nMay we pray that God has not taken wrath upon us, and that we continue to prosper under His grace.\n\n\nYour humble servant, Dante.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4456.2:\n To determine where items placed on board SCP-4456 would go, ten silver coins, designed as exact copies were created and installed with microtrackers placed within each coin. After the coins had been placed aboard an SCP-4456 instance, the tracking receiver was activated, and immediately detected all Foundation coins in the \nMuseo Nacional del Prado\n. Investigation revealed that the Museum had carried the coins since 1827.\n\n\nFurther research by the Anomalous Chronology Department found that every time a new SCP-4456 instance is provided with sufficient resources to disappear, the Spanish government's wealth would be retroactively increased by the value of the resources placed aboard the instance. While the exact repercussions of Foundation actions are inconclusive, it is widely speculated that the Foundation may have been at least partially responsible for Spain's Price Revolution\n3\n.\n\n\nDue to the large amount of money lost to SCP-4456, as well as the potential violation of laws outlined in the FIR Convention\n4\n, SCP-4456 is proposed for Decommissioning\n5\n.\n\n\nThe following proposal was submitted to the newly created Decommissioning Department:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Decom.\u00a0Proposal\u00a04456\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Decom.\u00a0Proposal\u00a04456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4456\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nHead Researcher:\n Dir.

Raegis - Representing Foundation Legal Dept.\n\n\n\n\nPlease check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:\n\n\u2611 Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n\n\u2610 Excessive Danger\n\n\u2610 Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object\n\n\u2611 Expense\n\n\u2610 Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment\n\n\u2611 Legal Concerns\n\n\u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):\n____\n)\n\n\u2611 Other (please state): Temporal phenomena caused by causality paradox, with unknown and most likely undesirable effects. \n- Dr. D. Eon\n\n\nSummary:\n The sheer cost of containing SCP-4456, combined with the legal ramifications of doing so, makes continued containment inordinately expensive and inefficient. Additionally, failure to contain the object may result in exponential duplication on her part, quickly becoming unmanageable and eventually noticeable. Finally, we already know that SCP-4456 will be destroyed eventually, according to Document 4456-A, and that if she is not destroyed, it may result in some form of causality paradox. \n- Dir. Bold\n\n\n*Must be of level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4456.3:\n SCP-4456 was approved for Decommissioning. The Decommissioning consisted of SCP-4456 being incinerated completely; any remains in the form of ash or char spontaneously disappeared. Decommissioning of SCP-4456-D was officially declared a success.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. I am my lover.\n\n\n2\n. Roughly 2,500 pounds of silver.\n\n\n3\n.

Foundation International Relations Convention; carries guidelines for the Foundation's interactions with sovereign nations, including, in most cases, outlawing donations to other nations unrelated to anomalous containment.\n\n\n5\n. The Decommissioned class has not been used for several years, due to the Foundation's focus on containing rather than destroying anomalies. This changed with the creation of the Decommissioning Department, an organized department created for the purpose of intentionally destroying objects deemed too difficult to contain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+360\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Calibold\u00a0+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Calibold\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\nCalibold's Mega Cool Author Page\n\n\n\u2014 SCP Articles \u2014\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8421\n \u2014 Ruler of Everything\n\n\nSCP-8228\n \u2014 Here's To You, Mrs. Robinson\n\n\nSCP-7178\n \u2014 A Thief In The Night\n\n\nSCP-7179\n \u2014 E is for Eternity\n\n\nSCP-6469-D\n \u2014 A BABY?????\n\n\nSCP-2082\n \u2014 \nElephas cryophilus\n\n\nSCP-6156\n \u2014 Oh, Doug!\n\n\nSCP-6579-D\n \u2014 The Detective Killer\n\n\nSCP-6900-D\n \u2014 The House of Stars\n\n\nSCP-5277\n \u2014 What Can Go Wrong\n\n\nSCP-5363-D\n \u2014 Controlled Containment\n\n\nSCP-3482\n \u2014 fine mayor posters campaign by dado\n\n\nSCP-5156\n \u2014 monke\n\n\nDirector Bold's Proposal-J\n \u2014 \"Guys, please don't read our SCPs \ud83e\udd7a\"\n\n\nSCP-2693\n \u2014 Fell Into The Well, Fell Into The Well, Fell Into The Deep Dark Well\n\n\nSCP-5559-D\n \u2014 The Great Ambrose Bake-Off!\n\n\nSCP-3448-J\n \u2014 Should Have Taken Him Sleeping\n\n\nSCP-4456-D\n \u2014 No One Expects The Spanish Decommission!\n\n\nSCP-4745\n \u2014 Spooky Scary Snowman\n\n\nSCP-4645\n \u2014 Blackmailing Computer\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Tales \u2014\n\n\n\n\nOpusConfidant Wiki - SCP-4645 - Threatini\n\n\nDiary Of An Existential Kid\n\n\nResponsible Promotion\n\n\nFriends Of Us Never Die\n\n\nTruth Lies\n\n\nA Team You Can (Maybe) Trust\n\n\nHappy Father's Day\n\n\nMission: Decommission\n\n\nA Bold Choice\n\n\nI Am Become Death\n\n\nUlysses B.
