If an SCP-2238-A instance is reported to have occurred, Foundation personnel are to record said instance for the purpose of record keeping. Additionally, all civilians involved\n1\n will be detained by Foundation personnel and released if they are found to have no involvement with the SCP-2238 phenomenon and are to undergo Class-A amnestics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen shot of SCP-2238-A-14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2238 is the official designation of an anomalous phenomenon primarily affecting television broadcast stations in the Southern United States, manifesting itself as a series of historical documentaries within the affected area. This phenomenon affects specific time slots within the affected region by 'hijacking' local TV transmitters through a currently unknown method.\n\n\nThe main broadcast intrusion occurs during the airing of historical documentaries. The types of documentary that SCP-2238 affects are primarily made by European or American filmmakers, specifically those that focus on the First and Second World War, although it has been reported that SCP-2238 will affect others that do not fall into this category.\n\n\nDuring an intrusion, SCP-2238 will play a similar documentary to the one being interrupted. This documentary, now known as SCP-2238-A, will have several deviations from the original, such as different events, different historians, and actors used in the documentary.\n2\n The amount of deviations from the original vary between each instances of SCP-2238-A. Currently, there are twenty-two instances of SCP-2238-A.\n3\n\n\nThe first reported SCP-2238 event was on 5-12-1992, when a civilian reported to a local broadcasting service about the inaccuracies of the documentary \nNapoleon: Man Of Power\n4\n in [REDACTED], Alabama. The documentary discusses the effects of Napoleon Bonaparte's annexation of Russia and over a majority of the Eurasian continent.\n\n\nAddendum-2238.1\n\nFoundation scientists and analysts have compiled a full timeline of events from all twenty-two instances of SCP-2238-A.\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1812\n\n\nInvasion of Russia by Napoleon I, ending in its annexation. The war of 1812 begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1813\n\n\nNapoleon III is installed as the new Czar of Russia. Closer diplomatic ties between the US government and the new French Empire occur. The Peninsular War ends one year earlier in a French victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1814\n\n\nFrance becomes involved in a war against Great Britain. A three year famine occurs in Russia due to an early winter, creating more resentment against the French-installed Russian government. In the same year, the formation of the Party of Russian Nationalists occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1815\n\n\nWar of 1812 ends with a US/French victory. Most of the former British Empire is split between the US and France. US annexes Canada, causing it to control most of the fur trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1816-1820\n\n\nThe US government begins encouraging its citizens to settle Canada. Napoleon I begins conquering most of mainland Europe, dismantling their governments in favor of Pro-French ones. The French government start to kill Russian nationalists and those for an independent Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1821\n\n\nThe French Empire collapses due to the death of Napoleon I via assassination by nationalists during his first visit to Russia. A revolution, referred to as the 'Russian Upheaval' occurs. Napoleon III is killed and replaced with a descendant of Czar Alexander.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1822-1850\n\n\nMost of Northern and Western Europe experiences a 'dark age' due to significant in-fighting between various factions following the death of Napoleon I. Central and Eastern Europe are divided between pro and anti-French forces, primarily ending in anti-French victory, further deteriorating the already fracturing French Empire. Southern Europe was primarily affected by this, as the lack of major Austrian and French interference in the region allowed radicals and Italian Nationalists to gain power. A new Russian government is created, this time with a system similar to a constitutional democracy. Along the same time, Great Britain experiences great social unrest, with several riots and attempted revolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1850-1865\n\n\nA new government is finally established in France, this time under the control of a Queen known as Abella I, the daughter of an anti-Napoleon general. She re-establishes centralized authority in the mainland of France, creating a dictatorial police state, killing dissenters and radicals. The American Civil War does not change from the original timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1866-1911\n\n\nAbella I regains control over most of the pre-1812 territorial borders, excluding The Duchy of Warsaw, but her state continues to suffer from radicalism and independence movements. The Russian government undergoes another revolution, this time by Russian communists under the control of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Revolution ends in 1910, with a Communist victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1912\n\n\nThe House of Commons of Great Britain is attacked by radical communists via improvised explosives. Over a hundred Members of Parliament are killed in the explosion, resulting in a temporary suspension of constitutional rights and annual elections. During this time, the new Communist government, now calling itself the Soviet Union, annexes most of the Eastern European states not under French influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1913\n\n\nThe creation of the Allied Powers, an alliance between The US, Great Britain, Austrian and the French government. Its creation was due to the recent territorial expansion from the Soviet government of most of Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1914-1924\n\n\nThis time period, known as the 'Great War', was a war between the Soviet government and the Allied powers. It began after the assassination of Vladimir Lenin, with Leon Trotsky declaring possible French involvement in Lenin's assassination. By 1914, a small border skirmish between the client state of the Rhine Confederation and the Soviet Union lead to another war. The US, UK and Austria, honoring their agreement with the French, declared war on the Soviets. Following heavy causalities on both sides, the Soviet Union capitulated in 1924 after a victory near what is now modern day Warsaw. The Treaty of Berlin stated that the Soviet Union would give up most of its territorial gains after 1912, replaced with either French client states or independent countries. In addition, the Soviet Union is forced to pay reparations, either in gold or oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1929\n\n\nAn event known as the 'Great Depression' began, causing an economic crash. Due to this event, Abella II (Then Queen of France), desperate for economic wealth, convenes for an update to the Treaty of Berlin with the Allied Powers, to the exclusion of the Soviet Union. Austria and Great Britain refused to update the Treaty without the inclusion of the Soviet Union, while the US remained officially neutral, still wary over another possible war. Despite repeated claims from the Soviet government that they had sent diplomats to Berlin to discuss updating the Treaty, they never arrived, with evidence suggesting a possible French intervention. Abella II, frustrated with this diplomatic dysfunction, began mobilizing her forces along the Soviet borders, despite objections from her military advisers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1930\n\n\nAustria and the UK, wishing to avoid another Great War, attempt to persuade the US to intervene, believing that, with a possible four front war, the French Empire would back down from their threats. The US, still wary of war and suffering from the Great Depression, refused, and remained neutral in the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1930-1945\n\n\nAbella II, citing a belief in the supremacy of the French Empire and the inherent necessity of curtailing further attempts at Soviet expansionism, declares war against the Soviet Union. The Second World War, between 1931 and 1937, is at a constant stalemate. There is no full invasion of either country until the US enters the war against the French. In 1939, a full invasion of France begins with the help of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and Austria. It ends in 1945, with the invasion of Paris, destroying most of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1946\n\n\nYear of the creation of the United Nations, with the Soviet Union, the US, Austria and Great Britain as the major leaders of the Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle information is known about this world post 1946.\n\nAddendum-2238.2\n\n\nOn 1-23-2000, SCP-2238 affected the city of [REDACTED], Louisiana, broadcasting a documentary entitled \nHow They Hid In The Darkness\n5\n, which describes a X-Class 'Lift of the Veil' scenario of the Foundation due to increasing tensions between the Foundation and the \nGlobal Occult Coalition\n, specifically on an event that occurred 12-21-1991. It also focuses on how the Foundation adapts to a scenario.\n\n\nDue to an error in the Binah Pattern Recognition System\n6\n, the Foundation accidentally attacked a GOC base, ending in the death of over 3,000 GOC personnel. This event escalated tensions between the Foundation and the Coalition, causing an event called the 'GOC-Foundation War' that lasted three years.\n\n\nThe contents of the documentary includes footage of Foundation agents locating, capturing, and containing several anomalous objects and entities. It includes interviews with Foundation personnel and sapient entities, including an interview with O5-12. The following is an incomplete list of incidents, objects, personnel, and members of GoIs that appear in the documentary:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1892\n (Containment)\n\n\nSCP-1938\n (Containment)\n\n\nSCP-044\n (Recovery)\n\n\nSCP-2453\n (Containment)\n\n\n[REDACTED] (Interview)\n\n\nDr. Mann (Interview)\n\n\nD-2134122 (Interview)\n\n\nO5-12 (Interview)\n\n\nSCP-2273\n (Interview)\n\n\nMember of \nGoI-5869\n7\n (Interview)\n\n\nObject referred to as 'SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588'\n8\n (Containment)\n\n\nIncident 083-D/Kondraki\n9\n (Footage)\n\n\nFootage of O5-1, O5-2, O5-6, O5-7, and O5-12 during their first meeting (Circa 1912)\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n10\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this incident, the entire county of [REDACTED] was given Class-A amnestics over the course of five days, the elimination of all recordings of SCP-2238-A-23, and the detainment of over \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 staff members involved in the film\n11\n. All personnel involved with \nHow They Hid In The Darkness\n deny any involvement with the documentary.\n\n\nAddendum-2238.3\n\nThe following is a series of transcripts from the documentary \nHow They Hid In The Darkness.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0from\u00a0\"How\u00a0They\u00a0Hid\u00a0In\u00a0The\u00a0Darkness\"\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was early in the morning when I first started hearing the artillery shells.

I always thought it was a barracks or a laboratory, if only I knew\u2026.\n\n\n\"Some men drag me and my daughters out of the house. They say they are with the Coalition, a force trying to keep humanity safe. They tell us to get onto a bus to the nearest civilian safe zone.

I never saw my daughters again.\"\n \u2014 Survivor of Site-43 raid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our job was to get the civilians out to the safe zones. Most didn't know what was going on, and the ones that did knew there was no point in trying to keep themselves safe. The case that always sticks out in my mind was this old man near the border of Paris. He refused to leave his house. Lived in it since the second world war before the Communists and Brits invaded. We couldn't get him to move.

If we didn't produce that much, we were expected to spend nine months on the frontlines in Europe or America. We heard the horror stories. [Pauses] The bombings, the killings.
