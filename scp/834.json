SCP-834 has been moved into an unnamed safe containment locker by order of O5-13.\n SCP-834 is to remain locked in containment locker Alpha-12. When being tested, D-class upon which SCP-834 is used are to be kept in a standard containment cell for the duration of testing, and are exempt from monthly terminations until effects can be ascertained.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-834 is a set of four markers (black, red, yellow and blue.) Each marker bears only a '\nThe Factory\n' logo, and no other distinguishing characteristics. \nThe only effect of these markers is that they write permanently on human skin, resulting in tattoo-like markings. Testing has proven the ink sinks below the surface of the skin, and is only removable via laser dermabrasion, or similar tattoo removal procedures.\n See Addendum.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n On 2/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588 Junior Staff Researchers L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appropriated SCP-834 under the pretense of testing it further, but in actuality to use it on themselves.
