Photo taken on March 4th, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5284\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Foundation assets embedded in UNOOSA\n1\n are to continue monitoring SCP-5284's course and position. Should SCP-5284's heading change, its assigned Containment Director is granted authority to execute Protocol GLITTERW\u00d8LF at their discretion.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5284 is an extradimensional extrusion of undetermined mass and variable volume. Radiometric and spectroscopic observation has determined that it produces little to no heat, is comprised of an unidentified organic compound, and exhibits behavior comparable to that of a microscopic organism. Measurements taken by GRACE\n2\n satellites have determined that even at its largest observed volumes (estimated to be 21.352 * 10\n10\n km\n3\n), it exerts no measurable gravitational pull.\n\n\nAlthough there are fragmented historical references to SCP-5284, direct observation within Earth's solar system has occurred only once. On February 19th, 2015, Foundation personnel noted its presence (and comparable volume) behind Earth's Moon. For one week, SCP-5284 maintained its orbit; then, on February 26th, its orbital momentum increased.\n\n\nUnder Foundation supervision, an unmanned probe was launched by SHAR\n3\n from Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh (India). On February 28th, the probe orbited the Moon and came within 3\u00a0km of SCP-5284. SCP-5284 extended a structure similar to an amoeba's pseudopods, which it used to consume and destroy the probe. SCP-5284's momentum and volume dramatically increased.\n\n\nAfter examining several Sumerian fragments referencing SCP-5284, Researcher \nMary Ross\n suggested making contact with an entity referred to in these same fragments as \"Salu-ki\". \nMobile Task Force Sampi-6 (\"Imaginary Numbers\")\n was mobilized, and \u2014 with the help of Agent Yara Toma (an esoteric specialist familiar with Sumerian) \u2014 performed a ritual to summon Salu-ki into a suitably preserved human vessel.\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 1st, 2015\n\n\n\n\nTOMA:\n \u2014 think that should do it.

Not anymore. All I can manage is a rough approximation. But \u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \n[\nUnintelligible.\n]\n\n\nTOMA:\n Whatever they're saying, I don't think they're saying it in Sumerian.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 4th, SCP-5284's momentum and volume increased again. It was now partially visible from behind the Moon, and its orbit was decaying. Researchers estimated contact with Earth's atmosphere in one week.\n\n\nFoundation operatives mobilized military assets for a possible nuclear option. Meanwhile, linguistic researchers analyzed recordings of the subject and identified key elements shared by several ancient dialects. Maria Tilde \u2014 an outside expert on North-Eurasian proto-languages \u2014 was attending an unrelated convention in Burnaby, British Columbia; an agent was dispatched to her hotel.\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 5th, 2015\n\n\n\n\n[\nKnocking.\n]\n\n\n[\nRattling.\n]\n\n\nTILDE\n Um\u2026 Hello?\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Ms. Tilde?\n\n\nTILDE:\n Look, it's a little early, and I don't even have my suit ready \u2014\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Sorry to bother you at this hour.

Are you \u2014 are you even with the convention?\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Ms. Tilde, I'm going to need you to pack all your things and come with me.\n\n\n\n\nMs. Tilde was taken by Foundation agents and brought to Site-76 for debriefing. On March 6th, she was permitted to aid in an interview with the subject.\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 6th, 2015\n\n\nNOTE:\n An approximate translation of the proto-language being spoken has been provided.\n\n\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abHello?\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abYou speak roughly.

The first to know One Who Speaks.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abOne Who Speaks \u2014\u00bb\n\n\nHARDIN:\n What is he saying?\n\n\nTILDE:\n Just a minute \u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abIn the beginning, we were two. His people and mine. Neither had need of the other. But we hunted for the same food, lived on the same land. Our indifference became irritation \u2014 irritation became contempt, contempt became anger.\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abBut when the Enemy came\u2026 It was smaller, then. It struck at me as I rested. I ran off. Hid in a cave to lick my wounds. That is where One Who Speaks found me. I expected cruelty, or perhaps indifference. To be killed, forced out \u2014 or ignored. But\u2026\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abHe helped you.\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abHe tended my wounds. Fed me. Protected me. Watched over me. And as I warmed myself by the glow of his fire, my belly full of meat\u2026 the fire filled me. I made a vow \u2014 burned it into my heart. As he had fed me, I would feed him. As he had protected me, I would protect him. And as he watched over me, I would watch over him. We would be brothers, he and I. And so, I learned the Words \u2014 as did my people. Two became one. One stood against the Enemy \u2014 and One prevailed.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abHow?\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abHow? How else?

Photo taken on March 6th, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5284's orbit halted during the interview. It was now on a direct collision course with Earth. Researchers estimated impact with Site-76 in approximately 1 hour.\n\n\nNuclear missiles were launched from three separate sites: Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, Warren Air Force Base in Colorado, and a Naval submarine located off the coast of California. All three payloads were subsumed by SCP-5284.\n\n\nSite-76 personnel were ordered to evacuate to underground bunkers located onsite. Despite this, Agent Hardin escorted Ms. Tilde back to the subject's cell to resume the interview.\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 6th, 2015\n\n\n\n\nTILDE:\n Can you do something about those klaxons?\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Lady, we're literally gonna die in the next four minutes. Whatever the hell your theory is, now's the time to act on it.\n\n\nTILDE:\n O-okay. Um. \u00abSalu-ki? I need to ask you a question.\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abYes?\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abAre you \u2014 were you \u2014\u00bb \u2014 shit. There's no word for this that I know. Um.\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Make that three minutes.\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abSalu-ki, did you walk on two legs or four?\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abWhat sort of question is that?\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abAnswer?\u00bb\n\n\n[\nSnorting.\n]\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abFour, of course.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n He's not human, Hardin. His people aren't humans \u2014 they're \u2014 they're \nwolves\n.\n\n\nHARDIN:\n What?\n\n\nTILDE:\n The story he told me isn't just the story of two people uniting against a common threat. It's the story of humans domesticating wolves.\n\n\nHARDIN:\n How the fuck does that help us?! Two minutes and thirty seconds!\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abSalu-ki, why are you One Who Waits?\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abBecause One Who Speaks spoke the Words.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abHe told you to wait. He told you to \nstay\n.\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abYes. That is one of the Words. And I stayed. Because I am One Who is Good.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abSalu-ki, the Words you are waiting for, your people are waiting for \u2014 is it \u2014\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abThey are your people, as well.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00ab\u2014 is it\u2026 What? What do you \u2014 what do you mean?\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abDid you think I would not recognize my own kin?\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abI \u2014 I mean, um. Um. I'm not \u2014 my body isn't \u2014\u00bb\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Two minutes! Wrap this the \nfuck\n up!\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abDo you think we are bound by mere flesh? That a pack is a matter as trivial as \nblood\n? I can see it in your heart; our sacred vow, burning inside you. Bright as the sun. Just as it burns in the hearts of \nall\n our people.\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n \u00abI \u2014 I\u2026\u00bb\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n \u00abYou have asked me many questions, little pup. Now I shall ask \nyou\n one. Tell me: Why does the black moon howl?\u00bb\n\n\nTILDE:\n It howls\u2026\n\n\nHARDIN:\n Maria!\n\n\nTILDE:\n It howls because it's afraid.

    "description": "SCP-5284 is an extradimensional extrusion of undetermined mass and variable volume. Radiometric and spectroscopic observation has determined that it produces little to no heat, is comprised of an unidentified organic compound, and exhibits behavior comparable to that of a microscopic organism. Measurements taken by GRACE2 satellites have determined that even at its largest observed volumes (estimated to be 21.352 * 1010 km3), it exerts no measurable gravitational pull.",
