The outer bars of SCP-5326's aviary have been retrofitted with titanium aluminide, and have had an oil- resistant metal epoxy applied. Additionally, a grate manufactured with the same materials is installed under the aviary floor, and is connected to SCP-5326's feeding system. To meet both dietary and maintenance needs, approximately eight gallons of liquid petroleum is administered to SCP-5326 on a weekly basis, through the use of an internal piping system. Excess petroleum is to be collected for later use within Site-10, including feeding of SCP-5326.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5326 is a group of fifteen bio-mechanical automatons, built out of \nCygnus olor\n1\n carcasses. Each individual SCP-5326 instance possesses a limited degree of sentience, intelligence, and self-perception, concurrent with non-anomalous, fully biological \nCygnus olor\n specimens. SCP-5236 does not feed, but has been observed 'bathing' in petroleum; chemicals present within crude oil may provide SCP-5236 with prolonged substance.\n\n\nSCP-5236 is capable of rudimentary movement, achieved by usage of a timed electrical current to SCP-5236's heart. The heart organ of an SCP-5236 specimen is believed to not be avian of origin, and instead possibly related to an unidentified primate. The electrical current, approximately 32 microwatts, functions in a similar matter to a human pacemaker, though the origins are currently unknown. A plausible theory suggests a form of thaumaturgy, owing to SCP-5236's background. An oviduct, and ovary, transplanted from a \nGallus gallus domesticus\n hen allows the development of 'eggs', each of which primarily consist of hardened calcium carbonate.\n\n\nCertain eggs developed by an SCP-5236 specimen contain intricate patterning and lettering, some of which contains a message. The following were collected:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABANDONMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMASTER GONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONELINESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum No. 1: History:\n The entirety of SCP-5236 was originally manufactured in late 1869, by William Christopher Anderson, a noted manufacturer of animal based automatons and clockwork toys. Following October 21, 1861's Battle of Ball's Bluff, Anderson was drafted into the Union army. During his time in the army, he primarily repaired firearms and artillery devices, owing to his past experience as a clockmaker. After the Confederates' defeat on Apr. 9, 1865, and eventual end of the war, Anderson became a well-established business man, in the Portland, Oregon area. Aside from his business activities, Anderson joined the Seventh day Adventist Church, and became an ardent follower of millennialism\n2\n and apocalyptic theory, becoming convinced that the Rapture, and so-called 'end-times', were to occur shortly.\n\n\nOn September 18th, 1868, Anderson claimed to have been visited by God, who had reportedly instructed him to create animals to repopulate the Earth, following wide-scale flooding. It is currently unknown if any other similar specimens like SCP-5326 were created by Anderson; if so, they are believed to be unaccounted for.\n\n\nAddendum No. 2:\n Update\n\n\nFollowing discovery of the messages written on SCP-5236 eggs, Dr. Arthur Bernstein, current research-head of the project, began a period of observation of SCP-5236, and began a series of positive interactions with each entity. Following continued care, three eggs produced by SCP-5236 had the following messages inscribed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRIEND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
