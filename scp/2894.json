No Special Containment Procedures are necessary at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2894 is a nonexistent island located in the French territory of New Caledonia, at coordinates 19.22\u00a0S, 159.93\u00a0E. Records of SCP-2894's existence date back to 1774, when the island was first charted by Captain James Cook. The next public record of SCP-2894 dates to 1876, when the whaling vessel \nVelocity\n encountered the island. At that time, the island was surrounded by a wide beach, and thus was given the name Sandy Island. According to all available physical evidence, SCP-2894 does not exist, and has never existed.\n\n\nInformation pertaining to SCP-2894 is widespread, although the most sensitive data exists only in the Foundation database\n1\n.\n\n\nAddendum 2894-1:\n Transcript of recovered document from Foundation database, 14% data corruption.

Implementation of Procedure Metatron-13 is now authorized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 is an interdimensional anomaly located in an undersea cave system at the base of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island, New Caledonia (coordinates \u2588\u2588.22 \u2588, \u25885\u2588.\u2588\u2588 E). A spatial aperture within the cave leads to the floor of an extraterrestrial ocean, suspected to be [REDACTED]. Water is currently flowing through the aperture from the other side at a rate of \u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 m\n3\n/s. The water originating on the far side of the aperture is non-anomalous and contains no traces of biological life, although its mean temperature is \u2588 degrees cooler than the ocean surrounding \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island.\n\n\nTimeline of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 discovery and attempted containment procedures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Reference\n\n\nRemarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\u2588.1964\n\n\nOceanographers report temperature anomalies in the region of New Caledonia. Embedded Foundation operatives begin investigation when no natural cause seems plausible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09.1964\n\n\nFoundation oceanographers isolate source of anomaly at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island. Containment perimeter established. At this point, the flow rate of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 is stable at approximately \u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 m\n3\n/s. Plans for exploration begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01.1967\n\n\nA specialized robotic probe is deployed to explore the anomaly. Despite the heavily modified [REDACTED] turbine engines it is equipped with, the probe is unable to overcome the pressurized outflow and fails to enter the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05.196\u2588\n\n\nGlobal sea level rise caused by SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 is noted by scientists worldwide. Disinformation Protocol \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is instituted to exaggerate the effects of climate change-induced ice melting to account for the discrepancy. Attempted neutralization of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 discussed, but tabled until more information can be acquired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09.1971\n\n\nA second robotic probe is completed and deployed to explore SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588. The probe succeeds in entering the anomaly, but is immediately destroyed. Analysis of probe's sensor telemetry indicates that it was crushed by oceanic pressure in excess of \u2588\u2588\u2588 MPa. Ocean depth beyond the anomaly estimated at least 3\u2588,5\u2588\u2588 m. Projections indicate that the pressure differential between the opposite side of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 and Earth's oceans will not equalize until all land on Earth is submerged under at least \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 m of water. SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 upgraded to keter classification; attempts at neutralization authorized by O5 council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25881.19\u25884\n\n\nFoundation engineers attempt to seal SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 with 600,000 metric tons of [REDACTED] alloy, obtained via [DATA EXPUNGED]. Procedure is seemingly effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02.1975\n\n\nThe seal on SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 explosively fails, releasing over \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 m\n3\n within a period of \u2588 seconds. Site \u2588\u25883\u2588 and all personnel currently stationed there are lost. A tsunami is triggered, causing heavy property damage to areas in Australia and New Zealand. Disinformation campaign successfully attributes the event to an earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03.1975\n\n\nContainment of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 re-established. Containment failure analyzed and attributed to mounting pressure exceeding the seal's structural tolerance. Flow rate of the anomaly has now increased to \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 m\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07.1\u258877\n\n\nAll further attempts to neutralize SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 have met with failure. Global sea level rise has completely inundated The Netherlands, Bangladesh, and many other low-lying territories. Plausibility of climate change cover story increasingly called into question by global media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03.1979\n\n\nA series of \u2588\u2588 megaton thermonuclear demolition charges are fired into SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 with the use of a supercavitating subsurface electromagnetic accelerator cannon\n2\n in an attempt to collapse the passage from the other side. The warheads cross the dimensional threshold and detonate, but only serve to exacerbate the problem. Flow rate increases to its current value of \u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 m\n3\n/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04.\u2588979\n\n\nRadioactive contamination due to failed neutralization attempt is widespread across the Pacific Ocean. Sea level rise now exceeds projected maximum of total worldwide glacial melting by \u2588\u2588\u2588%. The nature of SCP-\u2588\u25883\u2588 remains unknown to the general public, but its widespread effects can no longer be plausibly explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04.1981\n\n\nGlobal sea level rise now exceeds 1\u2588\u2588 m. \u2588\u2588% of Earth's former land area is now submerged.
