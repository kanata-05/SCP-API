Standard Foundation access restrictions apply.\n\n\nAll active examples of SCP-1980-1 (whether found within SCP-1980 or elsewhere) are to be transported to Site-41 for containment and experimentation. It is critical that no direct human contact is made with an instance of SCP-1980-1, outside of approved experiments.\n\n\nAny person believed to have been exposed to SCP-1980-1 is henceforth designated an example of SCP-1980-2, and is to be contained and transported to Site-41 for interrogation and forcible removal of SCP-1980-1. After removal of SCP-1980-1, non-D-Class subjects may be given Class-A amnestics and released. MTF operatives should be aware that it is possible to internally implant SCP-1980-1 within a subject, producing an example of SCP-1980-2 with no obvious anomalies. SCP-1980-2 specimens may be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell and have no unusual care requirements.\n\n\nSCP-1980-3, the mechanism for creation of additional examples of SCP-1980-1, is currently within SCP-1980. Relocation to Site-41 will be undertaken when possible. By O5 order, SCP-1980-3 is not to be used until such relocation takes place.\n\n\nBiological artifacts (SCP-1980-4 and SCP-1980-5) in suspended animation within SCP-1980 are not to be disturbed. If any such items become animate, they should be contained if possible, otherwise terminated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1980 is a structure located approximately 2.4\u00a0km under the Antarctic ice, approximately 400\u00a0km from the South Pole at coordinates [REDACTED]. Based on the depth at which it was found, SCP-1980 was constructed approximately 14.5 million years ago in one of the last temperate zones on the Antarctic continent.\n\n\nUsage as a scientific research base is presumed based on finding:\n\n\n(1) A telescope, apparently fixed for long-term observation of an area of intergalactic space at coordinates [REDACTED]. No significant astronomic bodies or activity noted in this area.\n\n\n(2) Approximately 5000 examples of SCP-1980-1; metallic discs approximately 10cm in diameter, composed of a tungsten-rhenium alloy and partially overlaid with a crystalline structure of unknown composition. Interrogation of SCP-1980-2 subjects indicates that each SCP-1980-1 contains the consciousness of an individual of an unknown sapient race, presumed to be the builders of SCP-1980. Based on the number of SCP-1980-1 found, SCP-1980 is part of a much larger complex or colony.\n\n\n(3) A biological containment area, containing several primitive hominids (SCP-1980-4) in suspended animation, as well as an entity (SCP-1980-5) closely resembling the description of a [REDACTED] within SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n(4) SCP-1980-3, a machine used to create additional examples of SCP-1980-1, based on information gained through interrogating SCP-1980-2 subjects.\n\n\n(5) Records documenting the activities of the inhabitants of SCP-1980. See Addendum 3 for translation of relevant excerpts.\n\n\nA human subject in contact with SCP-1980-1 will have his/her higher mental functions dominated by those of the entity contained within SCP-1980-1. These subjects are designated SCP-1980-2. The process takes approximately six hours, during which the subject is unconscious. Upon awakening, SCP-1980-1 will have control of the subject, and significant access to the subject\u2019s knowledge and memories. Removal of SCP-1980-1 negates this effect, leaving the subject physically unharmed, but disoriented in a manner resembling the application of amnestics. The degree of disorientation is commensurate with the amount of time exposed to SCP-1980-1.\n1\n\n\nExisting SCP-1980-1 instances contain the consciousness of the builders of SCP-1980. However, it is apparently possible to create additional examples of SCP-1980-1 from any sapient being, using SCP-1980-3 and a blank template of SCP-1980-1. 68 such templates were found. The research team working on replicating SCP-963-1 has \nsuccessfully made use of SCP-1980 materials to create SCP-963-2\n determined it is not possible to recreate SCP-1980-3 or SCP-1980-1 templates using current human technology.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n SCP-1980 was discovered in 2010, when an automated distress signal activated and was intercepted by Foundation personnel. The signal was traced and the surrounding area contained as Site-79. Extensive hot-water drilling has allowed limited access to SCP-1980.\n\n\nThe initial research team investigating SCP-1980 was compromised by SCP-1980-1 exposure, before the effects of SCP-1980-1 were fully known. Team leader Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 abandoned his post and removed approximately 500 examples of SCP-1980-1 from the site. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has not been recovered by the Foundation, and it is assumed that there are now a significant number of uncontained instances of SCP-1980-2, with unknown motivations. MTF Zeta-29 is responsible for their ongoing capture and containment. 27 examples of SCP-1980-2 are contained as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2012, including 6 intentionally-exposed D-Class subjects.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Martin, a member of the original exploration/containment team, and now an instance of SCP-1980-2\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Baker\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n When it was discovered that the exploration team was compromised, all members other than Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were successfully contained and interrogated.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n First, let\u2019s dispense with the idea that you're unaffected by SCP-1980. We know what SCP-1980-1 does, and we know your team was exposed.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Martin:\n Fine. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will complete his mission no matter what I tell you.
