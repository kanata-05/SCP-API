Photo taken from SCP-2746-1. SR 111-2 in view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The main entrance to SCP-2746 is to be cordoned off, and is only to be accessible via Storage Room 111-1 (SR 111-1). Due to SCP-2746's location in a heavily populated area, the door to SR 111-1 is to be monitored from Site-45-A, which is tasked with responding to any attempts to vandalize or break in to SCP-2746. This door is to be equipped with a deadbolt lock to prevent civilian interference.\n\n\nPersonnel are to be given large, disposable gowns to wear in place of original clothing while traveling through SCP-2746. Before traveling through SCP-2746, personnel are required to remove any clothing and personal accessories from their person, excluding protective gear and accessories used for medical or eye correction purposes.\n\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-2746, most clothing and equipment has been deemed unnecessary for exploration into SCP-2746-1 and must be stored in a designated storage locker in SR 111-1. Upon arrival to SCP-2746-1, personnel are to deposit these gowns in Storage Room 111-2 (SR 111-2). When returning, gowns should be retrieved after exploration for either reuse or disposal and all personal effects should be collected.\n\n\nEquipment needed for exploration into SCP-2746-1 must be carried entirely through baggage, and be tailored for animal use if possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2746 is an underground tunnel located in Las Vegas, Nevada, approximately 250\u00a0m north of Site-45-A. SCP-2746 primarily functions as a stable, two-way portal between Las Vegas and an extradimensional space, designated SCP-2746-1.\n\n\nOn the left side of SCP-2746's main entrances are two storage rooms: Storage Room 111-1 (SR 111-1), located within Las Vegas, and Storage Room 111-2 (SR 111-2), located within SCP-2746-1. Both of these rooms have a door leading to the exterior, and a door leading to the interior of SCP-2746.\n\n\nAs a human travels through SCP-2746, they will take on the physical appearance of a non-human animal; no pattern or explanation has been determined to explain why the transformation results in any particular species. This process has been observed to begin with the subject's skeletal structure, and end with the skin, size, and internal/external organs matching those of the non-human species. Human subjects retain their vocal cords and sapience when they arrive at SCP-2746-1.\n\n\nNonhuman subjects do not undergo the same changes as human subjects when crossing SCP-2746. When any organism, excluding humans, approaches SCP-2746-1, they will only develop functional vocal cords. They retain their level of intelligence while within SCP-2746-1, but may be capable of repeating rudimentary or familiar phrases depending on their intelligence.\n\n\nThis effect will progress as the subject travels through SCP-2746, and will be complete when he or she reaches SCP-2746-1. This process will reverse itself as they return to Las Vegas. It is currently unknown whether this effect stems from SCP-2746, or a proximity to SCP-2746-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Furies of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' Church; located within SCP-2746-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2746-1 is a forested landmass approximately 111km in diameter. Examination of the outer boundaries of the landmass suggest it to be floating in midair. Atmospheric pressure and temperature are comparable to temperate Earth conditions at sea level. Records located within SCP-2746-1 suggest that the landmass was inhabited by sapient, non-human animals, estimated 770 to 780 in number. These inhabitants appear to have been able to construct complex structures and tools, and have formed a pious, [REDACTED]-based Oligarchy. According to records discovered in the ruins of several government-supported churches, the social class and hierarchy of the population of SCP-2746-1 was divided into three groups, identified as \"Aua\u00e6sfyuaw\" (\"crafters\"), \"Waoi'ir\u00e6uaw\" (\"scholars\"), and \"Oi'li'ua\u00e6piryw\" (\"honorables\").\n\n\nAddendum-2746:\n The 'crafters', who were thirteen in number, are noted to have been the highest social class, below the 'Yi\u00e6zyua' (translation: The 'Maker'. It is unclear whether this term referred to a major religious figure or a god). The crafters are said to have played a vital role in the construction of both SCP-2746-1, and [DATA\nthe world as we know it\n EXPUNGED]. The scholars represented the personal servants and assistants of the crafters, and were typically selected from the Honorable social class after birth. The majority of inhabitants belonged to the Honorable class, which consisted of artisans, carpenters, and artists.\n\n\nSCP-2746-1's economy functioned off of a barter system, and lacked any official form of currency. The former government's legislation suggest that the original inhabitants were incapable of dying, and originally did not require any food sources. This effect is not present in subjects entering SCP-2746-1.\n\n\nAn estimated [REDACTED] years ago, the inhabitants of SCP-2746-1 were involved in a civil war (referred to as Event Nachash), which ended in the crucifixion of two crafters, the majority of the honorables and scholars, and the abandonment of SCP-2746-1 by the surviving inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to recovered documents, Event Nachash was the result of 'the Maker' declaring that humans were to be banished from SCP-2746-1, and that a penalty requiring that all citizens acquire the need to eat in order to 'preserve their sanity'. Due to a lack of available food sources and farming knowledge, the honorable class resorted to eating other inhabitants while the scholar class was given access to several private gardens with a variety of fruit-bearing plants.\n\n\nA large majority of SCP-2746-1's population broke away from its government and formed an organization called the 'Sgualayw i's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' (Translation: the 'Furies of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588') shortly after this penalty was put in place. This organization was led by former crafters Fredrick and Agathos, and scholar Clovis with the goal of killing 'the Maker' due to 'unfair treatment'.\n\n\nFor more information on Event Nachash, please read attached addenda and documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF-2746\n\n\nN-2746-1\n\n\nN-2746-2\n\n\nL-2746-3\n\n\nL-2746-4\n\n\nS-2746-5\n\n\nDO-2746-6\n\n\nDO-2746-7\n\n\nDO-2746-8\n\n\nDoc-2746-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward-2746\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2746 Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following documents are flyers, letters, and documented speeches recovered while exploring SCP-2746-1. Barring Document-2746-9, the majority of these documents were written in dialect A-12 (\"Old Angelic\").\n\n\nDocumentation not displayed here consisted of personal exchanges, trades and commissions, and literature.

Our Maker, whom we cherished, crafted thirteen spirits, and gave them one simple order:\n\n\nCraft.\n\n\nAnd so we did, grateful for our creation. We crafted the canvas, and every body it contains. We crafted the soil beneath our feet, and the trees that brush the skies. We followed his example, and crafted 764 spirits, similar, but unique to each other. Soon, for no other purpose than to craft, we created all that you have seen. It was because of you, that we have what we have now.\n\n\nBut then, we noticed something: what we have crafted was\u2026 still. It was boring; empty. There was nothing to appreciate and enjoy the things we have made. We created life; not the lives of mere plants, but the lives of walkers. Each of us created these wondrous designs; designs that were strong, designs that were agile, designs that differed wildly from each other\n\n\nWe presented our work to the Maker, like a child does with its first work of art, and he looked upon it all.\n\n\nIt disgusted him.\n\n\nHe tore our worlds down, and we rebuilt them again; this time, with rules dictated what we could do, and what we could not; no longer could we stray from the mundane; but we could not stray from the impossible; not entirely.\n\n\nWe built our designs from each others work, going down paths that the original creator wouldn't usually go, adapting them for different surroundings and making revisions. If the designs didn't work, and they didn't many times, we'd work on that design with different creations in different environments, and if it still didn't work, we would simply attempt something else, or leave it for others to find. It was still chaos, and we employed the use of magic every now and again, but we were happy. We, satisfied from our achievements, took the form of what we believed to be our best works, and presented the works to him a second time.\n\n\nHe looked upon it, and disposed of it again. Only during the third time, when he gave us his direct supervision, or perhaps, when he inserted his own likeness, did he see our work was good. But we did not care, we have finally appeased our father's expectations, no matter how self serving they might be.\n\n\nThat is, until his creations became\u2026 corrupt. The Maker blamed this all on our designs, for being full of temptations. Our designs were only meant to be artistic expressions, or simple pleasures. His designs were greedy! They believed they were entitled to everything they saw; that we exist to serve them! Never forget that when THEY provoked sin, and WE got punished for it! None of our creations felt that need, he crafted them to fail by DESIGN.\n\n\nWe feel their greed, we can no longer craft, and they get what? They are simply 'banished' from this place\u2026 Is that a worthy punishment? They go to create, they go to live and die, they go to eat, and let me remind you, they are eating YOUR creations. Is that fair?!\n\n\nNo. No it is not. But you know what also isn't fair? Six to one odds. A hundred scholars stand in the way of an ocean of fire! Together, we have every advantage over those who still follow him! We will storm the house of the Maker, and make him witness the horrors he made us!\n\n\nIf they strike you down, your mother and I will defend you. If they strike us down, we will all rise to fight again! We will end our hunger, and we will craft a fourth world, not for him, but for us: the way WE AS THE TRUE CREATORS OF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 DESIRE! One way or another, OUR VICTORY IS INEVITABLE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+]\u00a0Access\u00a0original\u00a0document\u00a0(Note:\u00a0Not\u00a0translated)\n\n\n\n\n[-]\u00a0Close\u00a0original\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYiil wi'lw, yiil k\u00e6gjofyuaw,\n\nLi'f fi'i' iri'lj \u00e6ji', ioy irlaphyk lal foy juay\u00e6fywf i's flayiyw.

We wish to say that her services were useful in better days, however, her greatest accomplishments were, up until her final actions, during our darkest days. Prior to her current state, Clovis was willing and able to provide services of both intimate, restorational, and intellectual natures to all citizens when in dire need, and was responsible for the apprehension of [DATA\nthe Serpent, may its name be forgotten, and may it be forever hated\n EXPUNGED], which is considered the beginning of Our Great War.\n\n\nDue to her unwilling involvement with Fredrick, Clovis shall not be charged of death.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to her current state, she provided her services to Fredrick, and served as an informant to his cause. Clovis was discovered being eaten by several honorable class citizens who served Fredrick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to direct intervention from [REDACTED], the following orders have been commissioned for Clovis's punishment:\n\n\n\n\nClovis's left eye is to be penetrated with a burning needle, so that her gift may be revoked.\n\n\nClovis is to be assigned a human shell, so that she can no longer return to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. This shell is to reflect the injuries she received from her assailants, so that in time, she may decay.\n\n\nOnce placed in this shell, Clovis's neck is to be cut so that the head should dangle loosely from her body.

You found \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Go back. Go back, and forget about it. You would be much better off. If you insist, fine, but just humor someone trying to give you advice, and read this first.\n\n\nYou probably knew of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588; thought of it as a paradise, a holy ground where nothing could have gone wrong, death couldn't touch anyone, and everyone was content. No sin\u2026 I suppose it was. Not any more. We've abandoned that notion a long, long time ago.\n\n\nGet this in your head right now; \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is dead.\n\n\nAfter what happened, we fought each other. I had to watch as our brother, our sister, our sons, and daughters were starved into madness and pinned to a cross, and half the time, I was the one who had to do it; the other times, it was Sari. There were those I had no mercy for; the ones that tortured, the ones that\u2026 indulged. Then there were the ones I regret; those I knew personally\u2026 I almost didn't do it, but I thought I had to. So I did.\n\n\nI am a very different person because of what happened here. I miss my friends. I miss the old me who liked to just sing and fuck around. I miss the times where we all liked each other, the times where no one was hurting, and the times where 'protector' only meant breaking up an argument every now and then. I would give up anything to return to that time.\n\n\nThat's why I don't want anyone seeing this place anymore; it's bad ground. If some authoritative body finds it, fine, I don't care so long as you have it left alone. It's a graveyard, not an attraction.\n\n\nDo I feel like a protector? No, I don't. I resent that title, and anytime someone calls me that, I feel dead inside. The only person I could relate to is Sari, and that's because she did the same things I did. The two of us are the only ones left; the others\u2026 they couldn't handle being the only ones left, so they just gave up. We had the opportunity to join them, but\u2026 it didn't feel right at the time, especially after everything we've done.\n\n\nNow, we just want it forgotten. We want a chance at a happier life, and hopefully we've got that by the time you read this. Hopefully, when we've cleaned the slate, exchanged this 'divinity' for simple, human lives, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 won't find us again. It's all we can hope for.\n\n\nSigned,\n\n\nSuwaird\n\n\n\n\nAnnotation:\n Document-2746-9 required no translation, due to it being written in modern English.

        "Addendum-2746: The 'crafters', who were thirteen in number, are noted to have been the highest social class, below the 'Yi\u00e6zyua' (translation: The 'Maker'. It is unclear whether this term referred to a major religious figure or a god). The crafters are said to have played a vital role in the construction of both SCP-2746-1, and [DATA the world as we know it EXPUNGED]. The scholars represented the personal servants and assistants of the crafters, and were typically selected from the Honorable social class after birth. The majority of inhabitants belonged to the Honorable class, which consisted of artisans, carpenters, and artists.\nSCP-2746-1's economy functioned off of a barter system, and lacked any official form of currency. The former government's legislation suggest that the original inhabitants were incapable of dying, and originally did not require any food sources. This effect is not present in subjects entering SCP-2746-1.\nAn estimated [REDACTED] years ago, the inhabitants of SCP-2746-1 were involved in a civil war (referred to as Event Nachash), which ended in the crucifixion of two crafters, the majority of the honorables and scholars, and the abandonment of SCP-2746-1 by the surviving inhabitants.\nAccording to recovered documents, Event Nachash was the result of 'the Maker' declaring that humans were to be banished from SCP-2746-1, and that a penalty requiring that all citizens acquire the need to eat in order to 'preserve their sanity'. Due to a lack of available food sources and farming knowledge, the honorable class resorted to eating other inhabitants while the scholar class was given access to several private gardens with a variety of fruit-bearing plants.\nA large majority of SCP-2746-1's population broke away from its government and formed an organization called the 'Sgualayw i's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' (Translation: the 'Furies of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588') shortly after this penalty was put in place. This organization was led by former crafters Fredrick and Agathos, and scholar Clovis with the goal of killing 'the Maker' due to 'unfair treatment'.\nFor more information on Event Nachash, please read attached addenda and documentation."
