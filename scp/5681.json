The anomaly may be viewed under strict limitations, with explicit approval of Site Director McInnis.\n\n\nI/O METATRON is to monitor electronic communications at all television studios for mention of SCP-5681 or GOI-5889.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-5681 designates a VHS tape containing a single episode of the game show \nGehenna Arcade\n, sponsored and distributed by GOI-5889 (\u201c\nVikander-Kneed Technical Media\n\u201d). The tape is intended to serve as a pilot for a syndicated series, to be viewed by entertainment executives in order to sell them on the merit of the show.\n\n\nIndividuals who begin watching the recording find it difficult to stop watching. SCP-5681\u2019s other anomalous effect only manifests when a subject watches the entirety of the VHS in one sitting. In this scenario, the subject will develop a need to repeatedly watch the episode, forgoing personal hygiene, eating, and other activities in favor of repeated viewings.\n\n\nIf the subject is restrained from viewing SCP-5681 for a duration of twenty-four hours, the compulsory effect will cease. Upon release from the effect there is a chance for development of anomalous side effects (such as cognitive or behavioral changes).\n\n\nDiscovery\n:\n\nOn 28 July, 1991, embedded Foundation agents in three major television networks sent out an alert for anomalous media recovery. The copy of SCP-5681 sent to ABC and NBC were retrieved without any need for amnesticization. Unfortunately, the copy that was sent to CBS found its way to Jeff Sagansky, President of CBS Entertainment.\n\n\nMr. Sagansky was reticent to surrender the VHS tape to his assistant, an embedded Foundation agent, suspecting a prank. Mr. Sagansky began obsessively watching SCP-5681 over and over, missing meetings and failing to return home that evening. At 01:00 on 29 July, personnel from MTF Kappa-43 were mobilized and covertly entered CBS\u2019 headquarters in New York City, New York. Agents found Mr. Sagansky bent over, face pressed against a CRT monitor/VHS combination unit. Attempts to pull the subject from the monitor revealed he was catatonic. The SCP-5681 instance was recovered, and Mr. Sagansky was airlifted out for medical treatment.\n1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nContents of SCP-5681\n:\n\n\n\n\nAt the opening of the VHS, the following description of the show appears:\n\n\n\u201cGehenna Arcade is the next exciting project from Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. A classic gameshow featuring host Jeremy Kincaid\n2\n and three contestants. Each segment presented features a unique sub-game; scores are allotted to each contestant based on how well they did at the individual games. At the end of each segment, a prize will be awarded to the contestant who scored the most points. At the close of the show point totals for each contestant are tallied and a grand winner is declared.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the first segment:\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 walks out onto set. He is wearing a black-and-white checkered suit coat, wide black tie over white collared shirt, and gray slacks. His skin is sallow, characteristic of an individual with advanced jaundice and his eyes are consistently leaking black, oily tears. He smiles at the camera; his teeth are bloody and stained yellow. He is holding a long, thin microphone measuring at least forty-five centimeters.]\n\n\n[Audience applause follows SCP-5681-1\u2019s appearance behind his podium.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Welcome to the very first episode of Gehenna Arcade: the game show designed to challenge the wits and physical endurance of our contestants like no other! Brought to you by the fine folks of Vikander-Kneed Technical Media.\n\n\n[The contestants come out and stand in a line on the stage. Kiara and Kevin look excited, while Sandra is sweating and frowning.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Let\u2019s introduce our three contestants: Kevin Fillmore, Sandra Gonzales, and Kiara Bakshi!\n\n\n[Light audience applause.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Here\u2019s where I\u2019ll ask you each to tell us a little about yourself.\n\n\nKevin\n: Well, I go to University of Washington, with a major in criminal ju\u2013\n\n\n[Audience starts booing.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh no, Kenneth, you\u2019ve already lost a point. Not a good start!\n\n\n[Camera cuts to a large score board with three parallel columns, each with one of the contestant\u2019s names over it. The sound of several dogs whining loudly plays and the zero under Kevin\u2019s name drops to -1.]\n\n\nKevin\n: Actually, it\u2019s Kevin.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Right, so Sandra, your turn!\n\n\nSandra\n: I\u2019m currently unemployed but I just graduated with a master\u2019s in psychology from University of Texas.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a lot of use out of that degree!\n\n\n[Audience laughs. Sandra frowns again and looks down at the floor.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Alright, so Kiara, let\u2019s keep this train moving!\n\n\n[Kiara opens her mouth to speak but SCP-5681-1 interrupts her.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh shoot! Just ran out of time. Let\u2019s talk about the game!\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 beckons the three over to the front of the stage, where three wide, low platforms stand in a row. Each is approximately eighteen centimeters off the floor.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \n[Pointing at the three platforms]\n So, this is what we like to call the trivia game.\n\n\n[The three contestants stare at SCP-5681-1, who is bending down to pat one of the platforms. He steps back and smiles. None of the three move.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: What\u2019s the matter?\n\n\nKiara\n: I thought you said this was trivia.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: It is! You\u2019re not afraid of heights, right? \n[Turns to look at the camera with an arched eyebrow. The audience laughs.]\n Get. On. The. Platforms.\n\n\n[All three stand on the platforms.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Now, members of the audience, remember, don\u2019t help any of the contestants!\n\n\n[Camera turns and looks at the audience, but none of them are lit. There are several dozen figures sitting in the audience, barely perceptible silhouettes not moving at all. Several sets of eyes begin to glow a dull red.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Great, I knew I could count on you! \n[Turning to the contestants.]\n So, the rules are simple, the most correct answers gets you the most points, just shout out when you have an answer. And make sure to keep your footing! If you step onto the stage before the round is done, you lose two points!\n\n\n[A countdown overlay utilizing LCD numbers begins with \u201803\u2019, with an accompanying buzzer sound as each second passes. When the countdown hits \u201800\u2019, SCP-5681-1 begins asking questions.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: What is the fourth Amendment to the Treaty of Versailles?\n\n\n[All three exchange looks without speaking. Sandra visibly shrugs. After thirty seconds, a buzzer sounds.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Aw, I\u2019m sorry, no winners. Audience?\n\n\n[The contestants are pelted by gravel from the direction of the audience.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Next question!\n\n\n\n\nEleven hours of footage are cut for the sake of brevity.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scoreboard shown in SCP-5681.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 continues asking questions, many of which were dependent on knowing fine details of historical and scientific knowledge. Each time the group fails to answer, they are pelted with gravel, sand, or what appears to be potting soil. By the end of that period Kevin has four points, Sandra and Kiara have eleven points each.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Alright! It\u2019s time to break that tie!\n\n\n[Each of the contestants are dirty and covered in small scratches where they had exposed skin. Sandra\u2019s and Kevin\u2019s legs exhibit obvious tremors.]\n\n\nKevin\n: Do I even need to keep playing at this point?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \n[Eyes narrowed.]\n Yes, Carl, you do. We\u2019ll get you back to your \u201ccriminal justice\u201d degree soon, don\u2019t worry.\n\n\n[Audience boos and throws sand solely at Kevin.]\n\n\n[Kevin shakes his head.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Okay! What is the source of life on planet Earth?\n\n\nSandra\n: God!\n\n\nKiara\n: Single-celled organisms developed out of proteins being created because of optimum conditions for the development of life.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Kiara, that\u2019s incorrect! Sandra, close enough! You win!\n\n\nKiara\n: Wait a minute, that\u2019s bullshit.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: No one likes a sore loser, Kiara.\n\n\nSandra\n: So, what do I win?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Win?\n\n\nSandra\n: Yeah, the producer said there\u2019d be a prize at the end of each round for the winner?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh right. Well, I award you the satisfaction in a job well done.\n\n\nSandra\n: That doesn\u2019t seem like much of a prize.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \n[Murmuring with his microphone away from his mouth.]\n Hey Jerry, I think I hate this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the second segment:\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 is behind his podium, smiling at the camera. His suit jacket is stained along the front with the black fluid weeping from his eyes and flowing down his face and neck. Each of the three contestants stands in front of blue door with their name labeled in gold.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Now we come to the part of the show called Labyrinth of Death!\n\n\n[All three contestants look back at SCP-5681-1, with varying degrees of displeasure evident.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: It\u2019s just a phrase! Come on\u2026 Okay, so each of you will enter the maze through your separate doors and the first one to meet me on the other side wins the prize!\n\n\nSandra\n: Hope it\u2019s a better prize than last time.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: I heard that!\n\n\n[The score board, having reset to zero for each, shows Sandra with a \u2018-1\u2019.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \n[Turning to the audience]\n It\u2019s like they don\u2019t know I\u2019m vindicative by now, right?\n\n\n[Camera cuts to the audience. The seats are empty. The camera holds on the empty audience for three full minutes before switching back to SCP-5681-1.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: 3-2-1, let\u2019s go!\n\n\n[All three doors in front of the contestants open. Each contestant is followed by cameras to allow for continued monitoring, the screen split into three. Despite the fact that each was standing within a meter of each other, each contestant is now alone.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA still taken from the labyrinth section of SCP-5681.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Kevin walks forward down a passage. He does not notice at first but the floor begins sloping down. Sandra similarly leaves the starting room and finds a narrow passage that twists in a spiral pattern, which should have crossed where she had come from, but does not. Kiara opens a door at the end of her starting room and finds a ladder going up, and into open air. She climbs to a wooden scaffolding extending off until the horizon. She looks down and sees only clouds, the ladder and passage gone. She sits and hugs her knees to her chest, shivering. The host begins speaking over the split screen footage.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh, and we\u2019re off to an excellent start, Kiara is basically struggling to breathe but hopefully that doesn\u2019t count her out!\n\n\n[Sandra continues down the spiral corridor until she reaches a red door set into brick. It is roughly half the height of a normal door and she needs to crouch down to shuffle through it. Kevin has found himself slipping as the sloping floor\u2019s angle increases, screaming until his voice gives out. Kiara manages to get up and move forward along the scaffolding, but it begins narrowing until it is less than a meter across. There are no handrails.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Kev Kev is making real headway!\n\n\n[Kevin continues sliding until he lands in a pool of brackish water, sinking below the surface for thirty seconds before breaching the surface. The pool is at least two kilometers in diameter. Sandra is crawling through a corridor that is getting slowly smaller in diameter as she continues. Kiara is holding out her arms for balance as she walks along the thin scaffolding, until finding another ladder going down into the mist.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh look, no one\u2019s dead yet.\n\n\n[Kevin climbs out of the water onto a pontoon bridge, leading into an enclosed stone corridor. Sandra continues crawling until she reaches a wider corridor constructed of the same stone Kevin was last seen in. Kiara climbs down the ladder, through the mist and finds herself in the same corridor. At the opposite end of the passage a spotlight illuminates a single blue door. A blinking red sign appears above the door reading \u201cEXIT.\u201d]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \n[Whistling.]\n\n\n[The three contestants, now in the same room, continue down the corridor, and begin jogging and then running towards the door. Kevin pulls ahead and slams open the door, throwing himself through. As he collapses on his knees just outside, it closes on its own. SCP-5681-1 is directly in front of Kevin, applauding lightly.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Ah, congratulations, Trevor! You\u2019ve won!\n\n\n[The scoreboard shows an increase of ten points under Kevin\u2019s name. Kevin stands and brushes off his knees.]\n\n\nKevin\n: Uh\u2026 yeah, thanks. So, what do I win?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: You win your life!\n\n\n[Screams are heard through the exit to the labyrinth. Blood and viscera flow through the space under the door.]\n\n\nKevin\n: What the hell? You said \u201cLabyrinth of Death\u201d was just a phrase!\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh sorry, I meant to say it \nis\n a phrase. Because it is. I mean, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you in the face, Mark\u201d is a phrase. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not about to murder you.\n\n\n[Kevin bends over and screams, slowly sinking to his knees on the stage.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: God, you\u2019d think you\u2019d be excited to win. \n[Sighing.]\n Next segment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the third segment:\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 is standing at the front of the stage looking out towards the audience. Applause follows for forty-five seconds. SCP-5681-1 holds up his hands in a waving motion as if to tell the audience to stop, but he is smiling. His entire face is covered in the black substance from his eyes, which are now two empty sockets constantly producing more liquid. His clothes are slick with the black liquid, such that small wet sounds are produced every time he moves.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Alright alright, enough of that! We\u2019ve got our final segment of the show and it\u2019s a fan favorite. Let\u2019s get our contestant out here!\n\n\n[Kevin is pushed into frame by a pair of hands off camera. He is followed by Sandra and Kiara, both covered in blood but otherwise apparently unharmed. All three contestants have faces stained with tears and shift back and forth on their feet.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Uh, wait. Didn\u2019t you\u2013\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 touches his ear and starts speaking in a low tone, still audible on the recording.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: What the fuck, Jerry? Didn\u2019t they die? \n[Silent for several moments. Nodding his head.]\n Right right, ok\u2026 fill ins. I just wonder about the brand, you know? Calling something a Labyrinth of Death isn\u2019t gonna have a lot of impact with the demo if they ain\u2019t dead\u2026 right, ok. We\u2019ll figure it out in post.\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 turns to the three contestants and smiles.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Well, Sandra and Kiara, looks like you\u2019ve still got the chance to win. It all rides on this last game!\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 turns back to the camera, still smiling.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: \u201cWhat\u2019s that worth?\u201d is our final game for the day! Contestants take turns guessing at the value of a revealed prize and the closest wins points! At the end we tally all the points accrued and we announce a grand winner! Okay, contestants, are you ready?\n\n\nKevin\n: Sure, whatever.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Okay Conner, I\u2019m gonna need you to perk it up a bit alright? This is a game show! What about Sandra and Kiara, you girls ready?\n\n\nKiara\n: Whatever gets me home the fastest.\n\n\n[Sandra flips off the camera.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Excellent, let\u2019s go!\n\n\n[Spotlights illuminate six doors ringing the stage, labelled with corresponding Roman numerals. Camera cuts to the scoreboard showing the totals as: Kevin \u2013 8, Sandra \u2013 11, and Kiara \u2013 11.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Right, let\u2019s give George a chance to catch up. You\u2019re up first.\n\n\nKevin\n: That is not my name.\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 smiles and nods and gestures to the doors. Spotlights center on Door #1, which opens to reveal a rusted car missing its two front tires and the hood.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: A used, 1972 Plymouth Dodge! How much is that worth, Leo?\n\n\nKevin\n: Uh\u2026 $100?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Girls?\n\n\nSandra\n: Jack shit.\n\n\nKiara\n: \n[Laughing.]\n $150.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Kendal is closest without going over, so he get the points!\n\n\n[Kevin\u2019s score goes up by two points.]\n\n\nSandra\n: Wait, isn\u2019t that just The Price is\u2013\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Shut up. Ok, next door!\n\n\n\n\nSixteen minutes cut for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the \"prizes\" shown during the game, with a price of 8 cents due to its value as compost material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The game continues, with the following items: a rotten apple core, a signed first edition of Dante\u2019s Inferno, a parking ticket,\n4\n and a twenty-seven inch color television. The score at this point is: Kevin \u2013 12, Kiara \u2013 13, and Sandra \u2013 13.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: The competition is fierce. Let\u2019s see who comes out on top! Final door, please!\n\n\n[The spotlights center on Door VI, which opens to reveal a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice from University of Washington. The name has been filled out to read \u201cKevin Fillmore.\u201d]\n\n\nKevin\n: Oh, what in the hell?\n\n\nSandra\n: $23,000.\n\n\nKiara\n: $24,500.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Fred wins!\n\n\n[Sandra and Kiara are ushered off stage by production assistants, while SCP-5681-1 approaches Kevin.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Goddamn, what an upset! You were so far behind, but you pulled it off, my boy!\n\n\nKevin\n: I didn\u2019t even guess.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Well, you knew the value in your heart and that\u2019s what matters. Six years of wasted effort and a chance to join a police academy to help oppress people of color and other marginalized minorities, aren\u2019t you proud?\n\n\nKevin\n: I don\u2019t even think I want to be a co\u2013\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Who cares? \n[Turning to the camera.]\n Well, that\u2019s gonna do it here for Gehenna Arcade! Make sure to tune in same day, same channel! Sponsored by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media, for a better tomorrow\nTM\n!\n5\n\n\nKevin\n: Wait, don\u2019t I even win anything?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Oh right, you do.\n\n\n[SCP-5681-1 reaches into his inner suitcoat pocket, pulling out a slip of paper. It is slick with the black substance covering the entity\u2019s clothes and face. SCP-5681-1 slaps it against Kevin\u2019s chest. It sticks to his clothing.]\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: A $50 gift certificate to Red Lobster! Congratulations!\n\n\nKevin\n: Jesus, what even is that stuff?\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: Aw, he\u2019s already started the otherizing process against those different from himself. Isn\u2019t it cute, folks? Little baby police officer Kevin!\n\n\nKevin\n: You\u2019re a dick.\n\n\nSCP-5681-1\n: ACAB! Goodnight, America!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUpdate \u2013 13 October, 1991\n: Follow-up research revealed that all three contestants are who they claimed to be, and are unharmed by the experience.
