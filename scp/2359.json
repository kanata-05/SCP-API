The process is to be handled by a full response team equipped with sound-proof ear protection and motion-mapping closed helmets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Addendum 2539-Gamma for relevant documentation on SCP-2359\u2019s revised classification and containment procedures.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2359 is a humanoid of 1.76 meters in height and 75.2 kilograms in weight. All further physical description of SCP-2359 is impossible. There is no method of observation that would perceive the entity's identifying characteristics without being exposed to its cognitohazard, and hence having the viewer\u2019s perceptions altered. While humanoid in shape and proportion, SCP-2359 does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, and only does so when directly observed.\n\n\nSCP-2359\u2019s primary anomalous property is a cognitohazard that propagates to anyone who makes visual, auditory or informational contact with it.\n2\n The infection impresses a false identity and memories of SCP-2359 onto the mind of the affected subject. As a result, the subject believes SCP-2359 to be a person with whom they have been acquainted with for most of their lives, such as a close family member or childhood friend. The implanted identity is a person whom the subject trusts innately and \u2013 in a large majority of documented occurrences \u2013 would go to great lengths to assist, including committing acts of violence. Interviews with multiple infected subjects have indicated that the infection does not make the victim believe SCP-2359 is a person already known to them, but inserts an entirely new person and set of experiences into the victim\u2019s memories. Complete removal of the infection necessitates precision application of Class-C amnestics.\n\n\nSCP-2359\u2019s cognitohazard propagates through all current forms of media with the capacity to distinguish identifying characteristics. Class-D test subjects have displayed recognition of SCP-2359 when exposed to Polaroid photographs or digital images; film or digital videos; analogue or digital audio recordings; and software-dictated transcriptions of audio recordings.\n\n\nAfter initial exposure to SCP-2359 or an instance of SCP-2359-A, the effects of the cognitohazard can take between a few seconds and up to several minutes to fully manifest. During this period the affected subject will display extreme confusion to the point of debilitation. The time required for indoctrination seems to be shortened by continued exposure to the cognitohazard and lengthened by immediate separation from the source, but there is no known way to stop the infection without the application of amnestics.\n\n\nIt is impossible to communicate with SCP-2359 through any medium without becoming indoctrinated by its cognitohazard. Likewise, it is impossible to visually observe SCP-2359 or any visual captures of it \u2013 including abstracted renders such as software-resolved radar imaging \u2013 without becoming infected. The only current method of observation that has not been evidenced to result in infection is a system of motion-mapping cameras that construct a representative animation of motion within SCP-2359\u2019s containment cell. The entity\u2019s cognitohazard also cannot propagate through second-hand documentation, description or repetition of what subjects believe SCP-2359 has said.\n\n\nIf contradicted, SCP-2359\u2019s cognitohazard functions as a latent kill agent. When presented with evidence that contradicts the memories inserted by the infection, the resulting dissonance experienced by a victim or subject cascades into a infohazardous kill agent.\n3\n \nSee Addendum 2359-Alpha for relevant details.\n\n\nAddendum 2359-Alpha:\n \nTranscript of Senior Researcher Gillard\u2019s Debriefing Interview with Agent Shaw\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02359-Alpha\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02359-Alpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Field Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588 Shaw\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gillard\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Good morning.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Good morning.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n For the record, please state your name and position.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588 Shaw, Nashville office Field Agent.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n And you understand that this debriefing pertains to the recent containment of SCP-23\u2026 uh\u2026 2359, yes?\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Yes, ma\u2019am, I do.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Alright. Just so you know, we have all the documentation we need on the procurement of 2359. This is a testimonial for our research into its anomalous properties.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n I understand.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Then that\u2019ll do for the pleasantries. Now\u2026 can you tell me about your involvement in the operation?\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t really remember all of it.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n That\u2019s fine, just tell me what you can recall. From the beginning, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Okay, well\u2026 I was dispatched from Nashville to Buxton County \u2013 uh, that\u2019s Nashville, Tennessee, by the way.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Yes, \u2588\u2588\u2588. Please continue.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n So I was dispatched to Buxton County with Hereford and Dietrich. There\u2019d been a lotta stroke victims in the county morgue last month, and our supervisor wanted us to sweep for anomalies. Honestly, I expected that we\u2019d just tell the locals to cut back on the salt and that\u2019d be it.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n But it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n \u2019Course not. We poked around Buxton proper for a few days; interviewed the next of kin and so on, but there were no leads on any sort of anomaly. Not until we started talking to the rural residents. One guy\u2026 uh\u2026 Henry Sturman, I think it was, said that his brother had come home from town talking about having seen the Mayor. The thing was, he\u2019d called the mayor by the wrong name. I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details \u2013 I\u2019ll have a proper report around my desk, somewhere \u2013 but the guts of it is that they got into an argument, and Sturman ended up showing his brother a photograph of him meeting the \nactual\n mayor. Sturman\u2019s brother gets woozy, and half an hour later he\u2019s dead of a stroke. Sturman thought the confusion was just a symptom.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n And that was your lead?\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n It was. We tracked back to some of the other families, and that was our link. All of the victims had died just a while after talking about the mayor.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n That was when you knew you were dealing with an anomaly.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Yeah, that\u2019s right. We kept talking with the locals, and something else came up. Most of the rural residents said that their mayor was a white guy, [REDACTED], but every last townie was sure to the bone that their mayor was a biracial guy called Edward Nimitz. One call to the Nashville office and we knew that Nimitz wasn\u2019t on any registries.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n When was it that you began to suspect that the anomaly was cognitohazardous \u2013 or memetic \u2013 in nature?\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n I feel a little dumb to say it, but it hadn\u2019t really clicked for me yet that it was all down to a mindfuck. I think I had a\u2026 well, an inkling of some sort. It just wasn\u2019t quite there yet.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n So what happened next?\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Dietrich set up a temporary monitoring post outside the township. Hereford and I went back to Nashville for a debrief. Do I need to talk about that?\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n We have the transcript already.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Okay. Well, while the MTF was being assembled our supervisor decided to send us back to Buxton, to case the town hall for the procure-op. I remember\u2026 Hereford and I were finishing our debrief docs at our desks when we got word\u2026 and\u2026 and that was the last time I saw Hereford.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n The last time that you can recall.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Yeah. Uh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember leaving. I don\u2019t remember anything after I handed in my docs.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n You\u2019ve been briefed, though.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Yes.\n\n\n(\nThere is a brief silence\n)\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n For the record-\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Oh, right. Well, Uh\u2026 they told me that Hereford and I arrived back in Nashville at the end of the day, but we were messed up.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Infected.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n We both thought that Nimitz was the mayor. We didn\u2019t even remember why we\u2019d been worried about him. They separated us, questioned us about what we did. Do you-\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n We have that documentation, too.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n \u2019Course, right. They\u2026 uh, they told Hereford that Nimitz wasn\u2019t meant to exist. They showed him the state registry, and\u2026 and it killed him. Uh\u2026 a \u2018hemorrhagic stroke\u2019; same as the civs in Buxton. I was dosed with amnestics, the MTF deployed the next morning \u2013 yesterday \u2013 and\u2026 well, that\u2019s it, right?.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n I think so, yes. Thank you, \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Was it anything you didn\u2019t already know?\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n No, but it gives context. Hopefully, we\u2019ll soon be able to understand what exactly 2359\u2019s anomaly is.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n Okay. Do\u2026 uh, sorry.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Go on.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n I was just wondering if I could ask a question.\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n Of course.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n The task force. Did it affect them as well?\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n All of them, we\u2019re fairly sure. Uh\u2026 we haven\u2019t finished the debriefings yet, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a motherlode.\n\n\nAgent Shaw:\n The thing got to them, and they still bagged it?\n\n\nDr Gillard:\n There were some\u2026 some internal complications, but yes, the operation was a success. They did have orders, after all.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Agent Shaw, along with all other staff involved in the procurement of SCP-2359, was placed on psychiatric probation and rotated to clerical duties for a period of six months. Agent Shaw completed his probation without indicating any lingering cognitohazardous effects, and resumed his duties as a field agent at the Nashville office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2359-Beta:\n \nTranscript of Assistant Researcher Mayhew\u2019s First Interview with SCP-2359\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02359-Beta\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02359-Beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2359\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Assistant Researcher Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mayhew\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n Uh\u2026 h-hello.\n\n\n(\nDr Mayhew pauses. SCP-2359 seems to return the greeting, and/or enquire the reason for his presence.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m here to ask you some questions.\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to invite Dr Mayhew to continue.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I have them here. Just\u2026 well, why are you here?\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to ask for clarification.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I mean\u2026 uh\u2026 why-\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 interrupts Dr Mayhew.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n But I\u2026 they-\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 interrupts again. There is thirty-two (32) seconds of silence before Dr Mayhew speaks again.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n So\u2026 s-so why are you here?\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to ask for clarification, or Dr Mayhew pauses before continuing.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n Why did they bring you here, Nora? D-do they think you\u2019re anomalous?\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359\u2019s reaction is unclear. It appears to further conflict or confuse Dr Mayhew.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I think I remember\u2026 no\u2026 w-what were you-\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to ask Dr Mayhew for assistance in breaching its containment.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can. They\u2019re recording me.\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to ask if it is also being recorded.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n No, not you. I don\u2019t think they want to.\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359\u2019s reaction is unclear. It appears to give Dr Mayhew conviction to assist it in breaching its containment.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I can\u2019t let them keep you here. I-I don\u2019t know what they think you are, but they\u2019re wrong. I know you too well.\n\n\n(\nSCP-2359 seems to encourage Dr Mayhew.\n)\n\n\nDr Mayhew:\n I\u2019ll try my best. I\u2026 I love you, Nora.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr Mayhew was debriefed by his colleagues after exiting SCP-2359\u2019s containment, but feigned ignorance as to the nature of his responses and suggested that SCP-2359 had somehow altered the recordings. Dr Mayhew became violent when Senior Researcher Gillard requested that he submit for psychiatric evaluation. He attacked his colleagues and attempted to tamper with research equipment before being apprehended by a response team and treated with Class-C amnestics.\n\nSCP-2359 breached containment at 1822 hours the following day, and was later recaptured. Access logs indicated that, for eighty-six (86) seconds, Dr Mayhew had access to a research terminal with necessary clearance to allow a containment breach. This has been identified as the most likely source of the programming script that opened SCP-2359\u2019s containment cell door.\n\nDr Mayhew displayed no indicators of lingering cognitohazardous effects during or after recuperation, and was rotated to other duties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2359-Gamma:\n \nRevisions to Containment Procedures for SCP-2359\n\n\n\n\nIn response to SCP-2359\u2019s long history of manipulating staff and subsequently breaching containment \u2013 and with special regard to its most recent containment breach, during which SCP-2359 successfully contacted SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2013 SCP-2359\u2019s classification has been upgraded from Euclid to Keter. Subsequently, SCP-2359 will now be kept under revised containment procedures, as follows:\n\n\nDue to the length of SCP-2359\u2019s most recent containment breach, during which its movements were unaccounted for over a period of several days, it is unknown how many foundation staff have been exposed to its cognitohazard and may be subsequently conspiring to free it from containment. To safeguard against this, current research programs involving SCP-2359 have been suspended indefinitely and interaction with SCP-2359 is now prohibited at all Security levels. Exemption applications are to be submitted to O5-14 for approval. Repeated applications for exemption will result in psychiatric evaluation.\n\n\nWith respect to SCP-2359\u2019s current feigned comatose state and Senior Researcher Gillard\u2019s current hypothesis that its cognitohazard may be able to propagate through motion-mapping cameras, live observation of SCP-2359 is to be filtered into binary detection of movement. As a precautionary measure, still frames captured from the digitized motion feed of SCP-2359 have been expunged from its documentation. Access to SCP-2359\u2019s live camera feed remains prohibited, and applications for access to the digitized motion feed are now subject to approval by O5-14.\n\n\nSCP-2359 is not to be relocated for any reason. Exceptions are now subject to approval by O5-14.\n\n\nThe above procedural revisions are effective 22/01/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 From the desk of O5-14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research logs have been edited by someone with O5 clearance, but the changelog is classified. The others say there is a staff notice from O5-14. They say that the containment for 2359 has been revised; that our project has been shut down, and we\u2019re being reassigned.\n\n\nIf there is one thing I know, it is that there are only thirteen. There has only ever been thirteen.\n\n\nI am certain that this time tomorrow, I will know that there have always been fourteen.\n\n\nWhat do I do? There's no protocol for this. How am I meant to stop it?\n\n\nI don't think I can.\n\n\n\u2013 G\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Colloquially in English; a throat microphone.\n\n\n2\n. Similar to \nSCP-1500\n.\n\n\n3\n.

There\u2019d been a lotta stroke victims in the county morgue last month, and our supervisor wanted us to sweep for anomalies. Honestly, I expected that we\u2019d just tell the locals to cut back on the salt and that\u2019d be it. Dr Gillard: But it wasn\u2019t. Agent Shaw: \u2019Course not. We poked around Buxton proper for a few days; interviewed the next of kin and so on, but there were no leads on any sort of anomaly. Not until we started talking to the rural residents. One guy\u2026 uh\u2026 Henry Sturman, I think it was, said that his brother had come home from town talking about having seen the Mayor. The thing was, he\u2019d called the mayor by the wrong name. I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details \u2013 I\u2019ll have a proper report around my desk, somewhere \u2013 but the guts of it is that they got into an argument, and Sturman ended up showing his brother a photograph of him meeting the actual mayor. Sturman\u2019s brother gets woozy, and half an hour later he\u2019s dead of a stroke. Sturman thought the confusion was just a symptom. Dr Gillard: And that was your lead? Agent Shaw: It was. We tracked back to some of the other families, and that was our link. All of the victims had died just a while after talking about the mayor. Dr Gillard: That was when you knew you were dealing with an anomaly. Agent Shaw: Yeah, that\u2019s right. We kept talking with the locals, and something else came up. Most of the rural residents said that their mayor was a white guy, [REDACTED], but every last townie was sure to the bone that their mayor was a biracial guy called Edward Nimitz. One call to the Nashville office and we knew that Nimitz wasn\u2019t on any registries. Dr Gillard: When was it that you began to suspect that the anomaly was cognitohazardous \u2013 or memetic \u2013 in nature? Agent Shaw: I feel a little dumb to say it, but it hadn\u2019t really clicked for me yet that it was all down to a mindfuck. I think I had a\u2026 well, an inkling of some sort. It just wasn\u2019t quite there yet. Dr Gillard: So what happened next? Agent Shaw: Dietrich set up a temporary monitoring post outside the township. Hereford and I went back to Nashville for a debrief. Do I need to talk about that? Dr Gillard: We have the transcript already. Agent Shaw: Okay. Well, while the MTF was being assembled our supervisor decided to send us back to Buxton, to case the town hall for the procure-op. I remember\u2026 Hereford and I were finishing our debrief docs at our desks when we got word\u2026 and\u2026 and that was the last time I saw Hereford. Dr Gillard: The last time that you can recall. Agent Shaw: Yeah. Uh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember leaving. I don\u2019t remember anything after I handed in my docs. Dr Gillard: You\u2019ve been briefed, though. Agent Shaw: Yes. ( There is a brief silence ) Dr Gillard: For the record- Agent Shaw: Oh, right. Well, Uh\u2026 they told me that Hereford and I arrived back in Nashville at the end of the day, but we were messed up. Dr Gillard: Infected. Agent Shaw: We both thought that Nimitz was the mayor. We didn\u2019t even remember why we\u2019d been worried about him. They separated us, questioned us about what we did. Do you- Dr Gillard: We have that documentation, too. Agent Shaw: \u2019Course, right. They\u2026 uh, they told Hereford that Nimitz wasn\u2019t meant to exist. They showed him the state registry, and\u2026 and it killed him. Uh\u2026 a \u2018hemorrhagic stroke\u2019; same as the civs in Buxton. I was dosed with amnestics, the MTF deployed the next morning \u2013 yesterday \u2013 and\u2026 well, that\u2019s it, right?. Dr Gillard: I think so, yes. Thank you, \u2588\u2588\u2588. Agent Shaw: Was it anything you didn\u2019t already know? Dr Gillard: No, but it gives context. Hopefully, we\u2019ll soon be able to understand what exactly 2359\u2019s anomaly is. Agent Shaw: Okay. Do\u2026 uh, sorry. Dr Gillard: Go on. Agent Shaw: I was just wondering if I could ask a question. Dr Gillard: Of course. Agent Shaw: The task force. Did it affect them as well? Dr Gillard: All of them, we\u2019re fairly sure. Uh\u2026 we haven\u2019t finished the debriefings yet, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a motherlode. Agent Shaw: The thing got to them, and they still bagged it? Dr Gillard: There were some\u2026 some internal complications, but yes, the operation was a success. They did have orders, after all. <End Log> Closing Statement: Agent Shaw, along with all other staff involved in the procurement of SCP-2359, was placed on psychiatric probation and rotated to clerical duties for a period of six months. Agent Shaw completed his probation without indicating any lingering cognitohazardous effects, and resumed his duties as a field agent at the Nashville office.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-2359 Interviewer: Assistant Researcher Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mayhew <Begin Log> Dr Mayhew: Uh\u2026 h-hello. ( Dr Mayhew pauses. SCP-2359 seems to return the greeting, and/or enquire the reason for his presence. ) Dr Mayhew: I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m here to ask you some questions. ( SCP-2359 seems to invite Dr Mayhew to continue. ) Dr Mayhew: I have them here. Just\u2026 well, why are you here? ( SCP-2359 seems to ask for clarification. ) Dr Mayhew: I mean\u2026 uh\u2026 why- ( SCP-2359 interrupts Dr Mayhew. ) Dr Mayhew: But I\u2026 they- ( SCP-2359 interrupts again. There is thirty-two (32) seconds of silence before Dr Mayhew speaks again. ) Dr Mayhew: So\u2026 s-so why are you here? ( SCP-2359 seems to ask for clarification, or Dr Mayhew pauses before continuing. ) Dr Mayhew: Why did they bring you here, Nora? D-do they think you\u2019re anomalous? ( SCP-2359\u2019s reaction is unclear. It appears to further conflict or confuse Dr Mayhew. ) Dr Mayhew: I think I remember\u2026 no\u2026 w-what were you- ( SCP-2359 seems to ask Dr Mayhew for assistance in breaching its containment. ) Dr Mayhew: I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can. They\u2019re recording me. ( SCP-2359 seems to ask if it is also being recorded. ) Dr Mayhew: No, not you. I don\u2019t think they want to. ( SCP-2359\u2019s reaction is unclear. It appears to give Dr Mayhew conviction to assist it in breaching its containment. ) Dr Mayhew: I can\u2019t let them keep you here. I-I don\u2019t know what they think you are, but they\u2019re wrong. I know you too well. ( SCP-2359 seems to encourage Dr Mayhew. ) Dr Mayhew: I\u2019ll try my best. I\u2026 I love you, Nora. <End Log> Closing Statement: Dr Mayhew was debriefed by his colleagues after exiting SCP-2359\u2019s containment, but feigned ignorance as to the nature of his responses and suggested that SCP-2359 had somehow altered the recordings. Dr Mayhew became violent when Senior Researcher Gillard requested that he submit for psychiatric evaluation. He attacked his colleagues and attempted to tamper with research equipment before being apprehended by a response team and treated with Class-C amnestics. SCP-2359 breached containment at 1822 hours the following day, and was later recaptured. Access logs indicated that, for eighty-six (86) seconds, Dr Mayhew had access to a research terminal with necessary clearance to allow a containment breach. This has been identified as the most likely source of the programming script that opened SCP-2359\u2019s containment cell door. Dr Mayhew displayed no indicators of lingering cognitohazardous effects during or after recuperation, and was rotated to other duties.",
        "In response to SCP-2359\u2019s long history of manipulating staff and subsequently breaching containment \u2013 and with special regard to its most recent containment breach, during which SCP-2359 successfully contacted SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2013 SCP-2359\u2019s classification has been upgraded from Euclid to Keter. Subsequently, SCP-2359 will now be kept under revised containment procedures, as follows: Due to the length of SCP-2359\u2019s most recent containment breach, during which its movements were unaccounted for over a period of several days, it is unknown how many foundation staff have been exposed to its cognitohazard and may be subsequently conspiring to free it from containment. To safeguard against this, current research programs involving SCP-2359 have been suspended indefinitely and interaction with SCP-2359 is now prohibited at all Security levels. Exemption applications are to be submitted to O5-14 for approval. Repeated applications for exemption will result in psychiatric evaluation. With respect to SCP-2359\u2019s current feigned comatose state and Senior Researcher Gillard\u2019s current hypothesis that its cognitohazard may be able to propagate through motion-mapping cameras, live observation of SCP-2359 is to be filtered into binary detection of movement. As a precautionary measure, still frames captured from the digitized motion feed of SCP-2359 have been expunged from its documentation. Access to SCP-2359\u2019s live camera feed remains prohibited, and applications for access to the digitized motion feed are now subject to approval by O5-14. SCP-2359 is not to be relocated for any reason. Exceptions are now subject to approval by O5-14. The above procedural revisions are effective 22/01/2016 \u2013 From the desk of O5-14",

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-2359 should be held within a standard humanoid containment cell lined with soundproofing materials. The cell must not contain media with which SCP-2359 could record information. SCP-2359 must be observed neither directly nor by live camera feed. Observation must be performed by binary positive-negative detection of motion within SCP-2359\u2019s containment cell.",
    "description": "SCP-2359 is a humanoid of 1.76 meters in height and 75.2 kilograms in weight. All further physical description of SCP-2359 is impossible. There is no method of observation that would perceive the entity's identifying characteristics without being exposed to its cognitohazard, and hence having the viewer\u2019s perceptions altered. While humanoid in shape and proportion, SCP-2359 does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, and only does so when directly observed.",
