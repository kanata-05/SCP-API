When visited by a subject without a dog or cat, SCP-3867 will instead display an image and the most recent actions taken by an animal available for adoption at the nearest animal shelter. Subjects will then be prompted to adopt the animal in question in order to 'experience these cute moments firsthand'.\n\n\nSCP-3867 Testing Log\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Researcher Jade\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe vewwy vewwy quiet!\n\n\n\n\nFranklin just snored a little bit but didn't wake up. He seems to be dreaming about sleeping. What a lazy, lazy boy! Make sure to pet him as soon as you get home, he misses you and wants to sit next to you as you unwind!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Researcher Watts\n\n\nNote:\n Researcher Watts does not own a pet.\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hate Mondays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDexter is pretty sure he just saw something dart across the wall, but he thinks it might just be that weird bright thing he can never seem to catch. He decided that rather than waste his efforts in grabbing the sneaky culprit now, he's going to let things play out. Sorry Dexter, but that was just light coming in through the window!\n\n\nIf you like Dexter and want to experience such cuteness in person, you can adopt him from the Chattanooga Cat Rescue, where he is currently in a Foster Home!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Researcher Matthias\n\n\nNote:\n Researcher Matthias does not own a pet, but expressed his parents owned a cat.\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRain, rain, go away!\n\n\n\n\nSommer's sunbathing was just interrupted by a raindrop. Uh oh, Sommer, you best find somewhere to hide before it really starts coming down!

Nala stopped wondering after she stopped breathing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Examination Notes:\n \nThis is the third time the messages condemned subjects who have committed some form of atrocity towards animals. I'd like to see what would happen when SCP-3867 is tested on someone who has neutralized a large number of them. - Dr. Yerko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Yeatley\n\n\nNote:\n Dr. Yeatley was selected due to their position as lead \nSCP-1459\n researcher.\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop Culling Puppies, Dick.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will totally go to hell for this.\n\n\n\n\nA blender?
