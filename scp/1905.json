Access to SCP-1905 is restricted according to standard anomalous firearm handling procedures. SCP-1905 is to be thoroughly cleaned before and after testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1905 is a stopping rifle chambered for the .577 Tyrannosaur round. SCP-1905 lacks a serial number and possesses no manufacturing marks. The left side of SCP-1905\u2019s stock has the phrases \u201cJur-ass-kick\u201d and \u201cDino-sore\u201d carved into it. When SCP-1905 is loaded and within 3 meters of an individual capable of firing it, an instance of SCP-1905-1 will spontaneously manifest relatively close to SCP-1905. SCP-1905 will misfire unless it is aimed directly at an instance of SCP-1905-1.\n\n\nSCP-1905-1 instances are sentient beings physically resembling various animals of the clade Dinosauria. Instances of SCP-1905-1 have all displayed a high degree of hostility. At the time of writing, instances of SCP-1905-1 have been found to resemble over \u2588\u2588 different species of dinosaur in testing. All instances of SCP-1905-1 have resembled dinosaurs known to have existed in the Cretaceous Period; the majority of instances have been found to resemble either \nTyrannosaurus rex\n or \nTriceratops horridus\n.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-1905-1 are composed primarily of fiberglass and plaster; they show no abnormal resilience and cease function upon receiving sufficient amounts of damage to their infrastructure. A single shot from SCP-1905 will cause the immediate destruction of an instance of SCP-1905-1 regardless of where it makes contact with the object. If SCP-1905 is still loaded when an instance of SCP-1905-1 is destroyed, a new instance of SCP-1905-1 will materialize in close proximity to SCP-1905.\n\n\nRecovery Log 1905:\n SCP-1905 was recovered in rural \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Foundation assets in the area traced several alleged \u201cdinosaur sightings\u201d to the residence of 24 year old \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-1905 was located inside of a barn near the corpse of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. An instance of SCP-1905-1 inside of the barn was engaged and destroyed by the retrieval team. The initial attempt to relocate SCP-1905 to Site 83 was unsuccessful (See Incident Report 1905-Alpha). SCP-1905 was recovered from the wreckage of the transport aircraft undamaged and successfully transported to Site 83.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Supplementary\u00a0Document\u00a01905-Delta\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\nThe following document is a copy of the contents found on a piece of paper inside a shipping crate in Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s residence. Neither the paper nor the crate possessed a return address. The paper was somewhat damaged at the time of recovery.\n\n\n\n\nHello there, my \nTESTOSTERONE\n rich friend.

Approximately 14 minutes after departing for Site 83, an instance of SCP-1905-1 manifested in the cockpit of the transport aircraft; control was lost shortly after, causing the plane to crash into a small wooded area. Information regarding the crash was successfully suppressed and SCP-1905 was recovered intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1904\n | SCP-1905 | \nSCP-1906\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1905\n\" by Jack Slate, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
