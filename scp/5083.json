(2006)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigned Site\n\n\nSite Director\n\n\nResearch Head\n\n\nAssigned Task Force\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-17\n\n\nT. Moose\n\n\nM. Lodge\n\n\n\u039f-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\n\nFoundation Satellites are to report any new radio transmissions originating from Eunike 185 to Site-17. If any messages contain coordinates, MTF Omicron-17 (\"Bank Busters\") is to be dispatched to that location in anticipation of an SCP-5083 event. Any messages received from Eunike 185 are to be classified to the general public. Omicron-17 should keep track of any large crowds in the vicinity but stay at least 30m away at all times before the 5083 event occurs. Personnel are not to attempt to prevent 5083 events by disrupting crowds in the area.\n\n\nAny 5083-1 instances detained by Omicron-17 are to be transported to Site-17 and stored in Low-Danger Humanoid Holding Wing Sub-Section 3. If the number of 5083-1 instances contained at Site-17 reaches or surpasses 15, further instances are to be hydraulically pressed for easier storage.\n\n\nIf a 5083-1 instance is eaten, agents are to be dispatched to the consumer's home to seize newly appeared currency.\n\n\nCurrently, 10 instances of 5083-1 are contained at Site-17, and 5 at \nSite-228\n. 8 of the instances are missing at least one body part.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-5083 is an event that occurs 1-4 times a year in the vicinity of a group of at least 10 people. First, an instance of SCP-5083-1 will materialize next to the crowd and begin running in the opposite direction. All members of the aforementioned crowd will then gain a strong desire to consume 5083-1, and begin to chase after it. After the event, all of the affected people will become amnesic, forgetting the events since 5083-1's manifestation, and losing their desire to consume 5083-1.\n\n\nSCP-5083-1 is a humanoid entity composed entirely of solid gold. Despite this, they are able to animate their limbs in the same fashion as humans and have been observed to run up to speeds of 35km/h. While 5083-1's body is as durable as gold in almost all situations, its body will become soft and malleable upon any attempt to consume it. To date, no negative effects have been recorded as a result of digesting 5083-1 material.\n\n\nIf the 5083-1 is eaten, the consumer will receive a pile of their local currency inside their home (if one of their doors or windows are unlocked) or on the roof of their home (if all entrances are locked) 10-12 hours after consumption. The currency will be worth as much as the gold making up the 5083-1's body. If the mass of the 5083-1 is consumed by multiple people then they will each receive currency proportional to the amount of 5083-1 they consumed.\n\n\nUnless they have undergone at least Level 3 memetic agent resistance training, any further people that see 5083-1 after initial manifestation will gain the same desires to consume them. When 5083-1 stays at least 30m away, and out of sight from, all affected individuals for at least 150 seconds, the event ends and 5083-1 is classified as 'escaped'. The Foundation is currently aware of at least 22 escaped 5083-1 instances. What happens to a 5083-1 when it 'escapes' is unknown.\n\n\n48 hours before each SCP-5083 event, a radio transmission will be sent from the asteroid, Eunike 185, located in the asteroid belt, with the coordinates of the event. An example of one such transmission from 2012/04/10 is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nROUND 36: 11\u00b041\u203213\u2033N 106\u00b035\u203247\u2033E\n\n\n\n\nInterviews with SCP-5083-1 instances have failed to uncover any useful information about their existence.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: Notable Incident Reports\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0Incident\u00a01\u00a0\u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0Incident\u00a01\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 1: Discovery\n\n\n2002/03/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge of SCP-5083's existence was first discovered on 2002/03/11 in Manchester, United Kingdom. The Incident began when SCP-5083-1 materialized nearby a large crowd in Buile Hill Park at around 7:00 AM. Two police officers nearby heard the commotion caused by the crowd and moved in to investigate.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of Officer Joo-won Seo's bodycam footage and audio.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log, 7:03]\n\n\nEthan Payne:\n Do you hear that?\n\n\nJoo-won Seo:\n Hear what?\n\n\nFrom the center of the park, multiple people yelling can faintly be heard.\n\n\nEthan:\n We should\u2026 probably check that out.\n\n\nJoo-won:\n (\nSpeaking into his radio\n) We're hearing what sounds like some sort of violent commotion coming from Buile Hill Park. Heading in now.\n\n\nJoo-wen and Ethan run into the park towards the source of the commotion, passing several confused bystanders. The sound of multiple people yelling unintelligible phrases gets progressively louder as they get nearer to the source.\n\n\nJoo-won:\n Over there!\n\n\nEthan:\n What in the bloody-?\n\n\nAbout a dozen people, all appearing to be over the age of 60, are gathered around a large tree, throwing coins and rocks into the branches while yelling various insults.\n\n\nHoward Lawson:\n.\nAll civillians were later identified using facial recognition algorithms.\n (\nWhile beating the tree trunk with a cane\n) Get down from there you- (\ncough\n) tasty bastard!\n\n\nBeatrice Corbyn:\n (\nWhile hurling coins into the branches\n) You can't stay up there forever! Only the Queen is immortal!\n\n\nAn instance of SCP-5083-1 is in the tree, concealed by the branches.\n\n\nPatrick Holden:\n God I want that hunk of metal\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n Help! Somebody help me!\n\n\nJoo-won:\n Holy shit there's someone up there!\n\n\nEthan:\n I- you radio for backup! I'll go and deal with this!\n\n\nEthan runs towards the tree and the crowd\n\n\n\n\nJoo-won:\n (\nSpeaking into his radio\n) We need more officers down here at, uh, Buile Hill Park, straight in the middle. Right now. (\npauses\n) There's a\u2026 large of group of- elderly people- around a tree, and it looks like there's someone\u2026\n\n\n\n\nEthan:\n (\nSpeaking to the crowd\n) Everyone, get away from that tree!\n\n\nMost of the crowd ignore Ethan and continue to fixate on the tree.\n\n\n\n\nJoo-won:\n (\nSpeaking into his radio\n) \u2026stuck in a tree\u2026\n\n\n\n\nMargaret Hoyles:\n (\nWhile raising her handbag threateningly towards Ethan\n) Back off, plonker! This one's ours!\n\n\nHoward Lawson:\n Yeah! Good luck getting past us!\n\n\nEthan:\n I said get away from that tree!\n\n\n\n\nJoo-won:\n (\nSpeaking into his radio\n) \u2026No, no, there's quite a lot of them\u2026\n\n\n\n\nEthan tries to get closer to the tree but is blocked by three members of the crowd.\n\n\nEthan:\n This is your last damn warning before I start making arrests!\n\n\nAt this moment, an old man, identified as Steven Hitchcock, walks into the vicinity carrying a chainsaw. As he comes into view the crowd cheers and begins chanting \"eat him up!\".\n\n\n\n\nJoo-won:\n (\nSpeaking into his radio\n) and one of them just- Oh my god!\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n Help, please! I don't want to die!\n\n\nEthan steps in front of Steven and draws his taser.\n\n\nEthan:\n (\nShouting\n) PUT DOWN THE CHAINSAW!\n\n\nSteven stops for a moment, scowling at Ethan, before switching on his chainsaw and continuing to walk towards Ethan with a grin.\n\n\nHoward Lawson begins running from the crowd, towards Ethan and Steven.\n\n\nJoo-won:\n Ethan, wait-!\n\n\nEthan fires his taser at Steven, but as he does, Howard dives in front of him. The two barbed darts impale themselves in Howard's sides. He collapses to the ground, writhing and screaming as he is electrocuted.\n\n\nEthan:\n FUCK!\n\n\n\n\nJoo-won makes visual contact with SCP-5083-1.\n\n\nJoo-won:\n Man, why am I\u2026 so hungry\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSteven kicks Ethan in the stomach sending him tumbling to the floor. The crowd cheers as Steven continues toward the tree.\n\n\nBy this time, more police had arrived outside of the park, and the Foundation had become aware of the event through Police radio transmissions, and had dispatched MTF Nu-12 to deal with the situation.\n\n\nWhile Margaret Hoyles beats the incapacitated Ethan with her handbag, Steven begins sawing into the base of the tree trunk.\n\n\nStuart Leonard:\n Get into my stomach!\n\n\nSteven:\n Timbeeeeer!\n\n\nAs the tree begins to topple over, and the crowd rushes to capture SCP-5083-1, it leaps up from the treetop multiple meters into the sky. Its golden, shiny body reflects the sunlight, creating a bright flash and momentarily blinding some members of the crowd. When it lands on the ground, it immediately begins running away. After a second, the members of the crowd recover and chase after it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-5083-1 exited the tree, the multitude of people watching the commotion saw SCP-5083-1 and became affected by 5083-1's compulsion.\n\n\nBackup police arriving on the scene also became affected and began chasing SCP-5083-1 into Manor Rd. Around this time, MTF Nu-12 (\"Trashdogs\") arrived on the scene and attempted to capture the anomaly while Extraction Team N-12K waited on standby. (Nu-12 were unaffected by SCP-5083-1 due to prior memetic agent resistance training.)\n\n\n\n\nThe following a transcript of Nu-12's audio and video log.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All members of Nu-12 were riding on motorbikes.\n\n\n[Begin Log, 7:37]\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Anomaly spotted up ahead.\n\n\nSCP-5083-1 is being chased by a crowd of about one hundred people who are swamping Claremont Rd.\n\n\nNu-12-4\n How are we getting past the crowd?\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n We'll go around it. Follow me.\n\n\nNu-12 speed up and turn right onto Penelope Rd, then left onto Summer Rd and left again back onto Claremont Rd, in front of the crowd.\n\n\nNu-12-3:\n The fuck do we do now?\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n We grab the anomaly and run.\n\n\nAs SCP-5083-1 and the crowd get closer to Nu-12, Nu-12-2 fires his Bolas gun twice at SCP-5083-1. The weights wrap around SCP-5083-1, tying its legs to each other, and its arms to its body. Nu-12-1 catches SCP-5083-1 as it falls over and straps it to the back of her vehicle, as well as concealing it with a black cloth.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n GO! GO! GO!\n\n\nAs Nu-12 drives away, the crowd attempts to throw various projectiles at them, such as water bottles and phones.\n\n\nNu-12 rides away from the crowd for two minutes.\n\n\nNu-12-3:\n I think we lost 'em. No way they'll catch up to us.\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n Who the hell are you guys?\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Command, requesting extraction team now.\n\n\nCommand:\n Affirmative.\n\n\nExtraction team Nu-12K begins to fly into Nu-12's area, manifesting in their audio as helicopter blades slowly getting louder.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Hold on. I think we have a problem\u2026\n\n\nAt the end of the street, a police van is driving towards Nu-12 above the speed limit.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Move!\n\n\nAt this point MTF Alpha-45 \"Janitors\" is dispatched in anticipation of necessary post-mission cleanup.\n\n\nNu-12 begins driving down Lancaster Rd onto E Lancashire Rd (A highway). The police van continues to pursue them.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Command, we'll have to delay that extraction!\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n Uh, \nhellooo?!\n You guys wanna tell me who you are?\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Let's shake 'em!\n\n\nNu-12 enters the traffic of Bolton Rd swerving around multiple vehicles. The police van follows, lurching to the side to swerve around a black car.\n\n\nAhead, two trucks are driving side by side.\n\n\nNu-12-2:\n Think it's time we got outta here.\n\n\nNu-12 -1 through -4 move into a line formation and speed up towards the trucks.\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n What the fuck is happening?\n\n\nWhile they are still driving side-by-side, the four MTF members ride in through the narrow gap between the two trucks.\n\n\nNu-12-4:\n Hell yeah!\n\n\nSCP-5083-1:\n Can you at least explain why those old men were trying to grab me?\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Command, prepare for extraction. Exiting the highway at-\n\n\nThere is a large explosion behind them as the police van smashes through the back of the two trucks, sending them both careening to the side. Its front appears severely damaged.\n\n\nAt this point Foundation Drones begin scrambling all local police communications to prevent further police force from arriving.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Scratch that, Command.\n\n\nNu-12 continues to speed down E Lancashire Rd with the police van in pursuit, both swerving around vehicle after vehicle. The police van occasionally crashes through another vehicle to keep going. Out of the right side window of the police van, a man emerges holding a pistol. He fires at Nu-12-4, hitting the side mirror of the motorbike, shattering it.\n\n\nNu-12-4:\n I just got fired at!\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Copy!\n\n\nAnother man emerges from the opposite side of the police van, also carrying a pistol.\n\n\nAs Nu-12-2 swerves around a blue car, one of the armed men fires at Nu-12-2, hitting and shattering the blue car's back screen.\n\n\nNu-12-2:\n Crap! We need to lose these guys fast!\n\n\nMultiple bullets continue to fly past the members of Nu-12, occasionally colliding with nearby civilian vehicles.\n\n\nNu-12-1:\n Okay, we'll turn right here onto-\n\n\nA bullet collides with Nu-12-1's back wheel, bursting it and sending her and SCP-5083-1 tumbling sideways. SCP-5083-1 screams. Nu-12-1 is unconscious.\n\n\nNu-12-3:\n Nu-1, what happened?

Three men exit the side vehicle, grab SCP-5083-1 and haul it into the van.\n\n\nAs the police van turns around, Nu-12 -2, -3, and -4 swerve around Nu-12-1 and give chase. Suddenly the van begins lurching around sporadically, and SCP-5083-1 can be heard screaming inside. The van collides with multiple vehicles before coming to a full stop. Nu-12 surround the van and enter it to find six half-conscious police officers, all amnesic, and SCP-5083-1 missing.\n\n\n\n\nDirectly after the events of Incident 1, MTF Alpha-45 arrived to perform post-mission cleanup.
