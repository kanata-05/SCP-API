One instance of SCP-5434 is to be installed on Dr. Simon Glass' company cellular phone at all times in order for the subject to remain in correspondence with SCP-5434-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5434 is an anomalous smartphone application called \u201cAsk a Love God\u201d which spontaneously appears in digital storefronts whenever a user suffers from problems related to romantic intimacy. When opened, it presents a digital chatroom \nseemingly\n (See Update 5434-01) connected to an sapient intelligence named \"Himeros\".\n\n\nWhen spoken to about the aforementioned romantic problems, the entity will attempt to repair the issues via a therapeutic dialog\n1\n. During its \"sessions\", SCP-5434-1 has been seen to use tactics such as psychological examination and empathetic suggestion in order to remedy these issues. No sign of anomalous compulsion was detected during these sessions.\n\n\nAddendum 5434.01:\n Shortly after its discovery and containment by the Foundation, SCP-5434 began to send notifications to users with it installed, asking \u201cif there was anything I could do to help you.\u201d This allowed Foundation operatives to better isolate and remove SCP-5434 instances out of containment, which caused the notifications of SCP-5434 to increase in frequency. A list of SCP-5434 notifications can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 days after beginning of containment, reported to show once every week.\n\n\nHello! Is there anything that ails you? Remember that Himeros is always here for you.\n\n\n\n\n14 days after beginning of containment, reported to show once every four days.\n\n\nIf there\u2019s anything you need to talk about, don\u2019t hesitate to come to me.\n\n\n\n\n20 days after beginning of containment, reported to show once every three days.\n\n\nNot doing much over here. Send me a PM if you guys need help with anything love-related.\n\n\n\n\n22 days after beginning of containment, reported to show once every two days.\n\n\nHeya, is anyone out there? I\u2019ve only gotten a few people in the last few days. If you need help, tell me, alright?\n\n\nNote: Shortly after this, it was reported that SCP-5434 instances have been seen in greater numbers than before. Due to this, Foundation containment efforts have increased.\n\n\n\n\n25 days after beginning of containment, reported to show twice every day.\n\n\nOh gods, is anyone there? Just send me a text or something, yeah? I\u2019d love to see if you guys still need\u2026 help.\n\n\n\n\nShortly after, the notifications from SCP-5434 ceased.\n\n\nUpdate 5434-01\n: Two months after the onset of initial containment, Foundation liaisons to the Serpent's Hand began to receive requests to assist an entity named \"Himeros\". Shortly after, a message from the Wanderer's Library was sent to Site-19.\n\n\n\n\nTo the Heads of Site-19,\n\n\nRegrettably, we have recently been informed that your Jailing efforts have sadly deprived the Erotes\n2\n love god Himeros\n3\n of his pastime and comfort. Himeros has assisted many people in the past, and after the deaths of his brothers and mother has tried to seek comfort in assisting mortals- namely, us. We'd like to ask you to allow him some sort of recourse, to comfort him in his time of need.\n\n\nKindly keep in mind that this is not a demand, but a request. Himeros is a benevolent force; and though we know that you may not have intended to deprive him of what he wishes to do, we beseech you to correct it in the near future. We acknowledge that relations between our organizations have not been cordial, but we hope that you can do the right thing in this regard.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Keepers of the Wanderer's Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the arrival of the message, Site-19's director conferred with Dr. Glass of the Ethics Committee on the condition of SCP-5434-1, and if Foundation intervention is needed to assist the anomaly even if it is not actively in containment.\n\n\nAn excerpt of the meeting is included below.\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n This excerpt takes place fifteen minutes into the meeting, where the members discuss the heart of the issue.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin log>\n\n\nDirector Bright:\n Keep in mind, the \nSerpent's Hand\n just asked us to do this. They don't ask us to do anything. Why the hell should we comfort this god in lieu of them? This isn't some powerful eldritch being bent on the world's destruction. It's just a minor entity that we've contained, like a lot of others.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n The Wanderer's Library is still in recovery after recent run-ins with the GOC, which definitely explains why they're asking \nus\n to do this. They themselves said that the anomaly is benevolent, and we don't have any evidence to suggest that what they're saying is false.\n\n\nDirector Bright:\n I just don\u2019t get why we need to be concerned about it. What we\u2019re talking about is the SCP, the \napp\n, and not the entity that\u2019s behind the app. You\u2019re right in that it needs help, but does it need \nour\n help?\n\n\nDr. Glass\n: Relatively speaking, this is one of those anomalies that actively need it. We, the Foundation, took away its only means of connecting with people outside of its own dimension.\n\n\n[Dr. Glass leans forward]\n\n\nDr. Glass\n: Shouldn\u2019t we be doing something to remedy that? Plus, something like this is bound to help us keep it contained in one place, without the need for containment efforts elsewhere. If we can convince it to stop spreading the SCP, that would definitely help.\n\n\nDirector Bright:\n It still feels like something out of our jurisdiction to me, and it definitely still doesn\u2019t feel like we should expend resources on something that may not need it- especially when the Hand requests it.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n Think about this. We\u2019ve always felt the need to have company. We\u2019ve always felt the need to try to \nconnect\n with other people. This is a powerful extradimensional entity, yes.\n\n\nDirector Bright [crossing his arms]:\n Your point?\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n But just because it\u2019s a god doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need a \nfriend\n.\n\n\n[A ten second silence follows]\n\n\nDirector Bright:\n I mean\u2026 fine. If it really doesn\u2019t take that much and we\u2019re willing to get a trial, I\u2019m fine with it. As head of Psychology, you'd be the best candidate for it.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n Thank you, Director. I'll\u2026 make sure to do it immediately.\n\n\n<End log>\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the end of the Ethics Committee meeting, Dr. Glass\u2019 company cellular phone was installed with an instance of SCP-5434. A transcript of their first conversation can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\nOh, hello. You\u2019re the first one that\u2019s logged on in a while. You don't know how happy that makes me! What do you need help with?\n\n\nhello, himeros. are you doing well?\n\n\nMe?\n\n\nyes. you, himeros.\n\n\nAh, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s talk about you, though. What romantic troubles ail you, friend?\n\n\nwell\n\n\nYes?\n\n\nyou\u2019re someone who helps people right?\n\n\nYep! I\u2019m someone who just wants to help people. Less people seem to need my help now, but\u2026 hey. I can get over it.\n\n\nwell I\u2019m someone who likes to help people, too. I\u2019m a psychologist, someone that wants to help people get past their troubles.\n\n\nWoah. That is amazing. Are you something like a therapist? I\u2019ve heard people talk about that, too.\n\n\nI can be a therapist, yes. people need a lot of help, don\u2019t they? that\u2019s why people like us want to them to get past all that.\n\n\nA kindred spirit, finally! I\u2019ve never talked to someone like you before. Does your world have a lot of people like you?\n\n\nthere are a lot like me, yes\n\n\nare there a lot like you?\n\n\nI have a bunch of people like me, yes. I haven\u2019t gotten in touch with them in thousands of years, though. I wasn\u2019t close with them before, either.\n\n\ndamn, I\u2019m sorry. why weren\u2019t you close with them?\n\n\nMe and my brothers\u2026 we do a lot of stuff about love.\n\n\ncan you tell me who those brothers are?\n\n\nI mean, sure. Er is our oldest brother. He isn\u2019t around much- he\u2019s usually with Mom or taking care of his wife. Hedy is always off sweet-talking people. I meet a bunch of his kids sometimes. Herma is a really good person, but after he merged with his girlfriend, we never really talk much. Hyme has always been off at the pantheon ever since Mom died. Poth and Ant\u2026 they died a long time ago, too. We were always the closest.\n\n\nwhy are you doing this, though, himeros? this love advice thing?\n\n\nLove advice? Heh, I\u2019m the god of unrequited love. I can\u2019t do anything like my brothers when it comes to all that. But you guys\u2026 you always have a chance. I guess that's why my mom (rest her vain divine soul) always took an interest in you.\n\n\nJust a shame that it seems like no one wants my help anymore, I guess. What\u2019s that saying of yours? \u201cI guide others to a pleasure I cannot address?\u201d\n\n\n\u201dI guide others to a treasure I cannot possess.\u201d yes. that\u2019s from a movie that just came out a few years ago. :) do you think it describes your plight accurately?\n\n\nI\u2019m not bitter, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just that\u2026 it can get a bit lonely. I tried courting a few titans and goddesses and even a few dryads and satyrs over the years but\u2026 well, what did I expect was gonna happen?\n\n\nFor a god of love, it can get pretty lonely not having anyone to love at all.\n\n\nI can understand that, yes, but\u2026 have you ever had a friend before, himeros?\n\n\nA friend? Well, no. I only had my brothers.\n\n\nthen this should be perfect for you. do you want me to be your friend? I can talk to you when I\u2019m available, we can speak about everything that crosses your mind, and\u2026 yeah.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never had a friend, before. What\u2019s uh\u2026 what\u2019s your name?\n\n\nsimon glass. you can just call me simon.\n\n\nSimon it is. I hope I can be a good friend to you, Simon. :)\n\n\nwoah, a smiley face. where did you learn that?\n\n\nFrom you, just now. Friends learn from each other, right?\n\n\n\u2026right on XD\n\n\n\n\nShortly after, a proposal was created for SCP-5434-1 to regularly correspond with Dr. Glass. In line with the Ethics Committee\u2019s recommendation, the proposal was approved by Site Direction and Director Bright. As of the time of writing, Dr. Glass is still in regular correspondence with SCP-5434-1.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. From the statistics of previous Foundation tests, the success rate of these attempts range from 98% to 99% percent effectivity.\n\n\n2\n. Winged Greek gods associated with love and desire\n\n\n3\n.
