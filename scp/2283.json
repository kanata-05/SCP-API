All Foundation personnel in the vicinity of the blast are recorded as MIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2283\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Instances of SCP-2283 found in the field are to be disarmed by Class D resources possessing military or law enforcement equivalent certifications in Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel permitted to approach an instance of SCP-2283 presumed or suspected of possessing a live payload.\n\n\nIn the event appropriate Class D resources are unavailable to deactivate an instance of SCP-2283, the instance is to be remotely detonated from a safe distance using any appropriate explosive projectile.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances are Foundation personnel to use remotely controlled vehicles to dispose of instances of SCP-2283, although if no other situational alternative exists, the acting HMCL supervisors\n1\n may authorize the use of Class D resources to perform this task. Personnel should refer to Incident Log 2283-12 for more information.\n\n\nDeactivated instances of SCP-2283 are to be stored at least 50m underground in a facility designed to hold high explosive munitions with standard Foundation physical security and surveillance measures, in ordnance magazines built with aluminum non-sparking shelving. Currently, Ordnance Bunker 12 at Site-19 has been selected for this purpose.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances are personnel below security classification 2283-2 to be permitted entry to the selected storage site, with the exception of qualified Class D resources selected to perform mandatory biweekly inventory and degradation inspections.\n\n\nPartial data on non-anomalous aspects of SCP-2283-A's molecular composition is to be added to the Threat Recognition Analytics Certified Realtime (TRACR)\n2\n forensic database to aid Foundation anterior detection and containment efforts. Foundation police liaisons in all regions where instances of SCP-2283 have been deployed or are suspected to be deployed must be trained in the item's detection, and are to alert their regional command upon reasonable suspicion of such deployment.\n\n\nIf Foundation personnel become aware of the detonation of an instance of SCP-2283 in a civilian area, Foundation intelligence assets are to immediately enact Procedure False Flag, entailing the return of falsified human remains to relatives of the victims, and blame for the incident to be attributed to the most convincing possible perpetrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult of Incident 2283-29 in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. No human remains or injured persons were recovered from the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2283 is a collection of 287 individual munitions and explosive devices of varying design, yield, age and manufacture, including but not limited to hand grenades, improvised explosive devices, timed charges and field ordnance. Instances of SCP-2283 resemble traditional explosives in most respects, including non-anomalous mechanical and electronic components, wiring, and blasting caps.\n\n\nHowever, the explosive component of each SCP-2283 instance is composed of SCP-2283-A, an unknown material superficially resembling RDX (PVV-5A), but with several unexplained physical properties\n3\n.\n\n\nEvery recorded instance of the detonation of an instance of SCP-2283 has resulted in damage to nearby inanimate objects as would otherwise be expected for a non-anomalous RDX device of an equivalent yield. However, persons within the blast radius of an SCP-2283 instance will not suffer the effects of said explosion, but will instead instantaneously vanish along with all possessions on their person\n4\n from known space, and mirror the creation of SCP-2283-B, Class 4 Incorporeal Entities\n5\n with unique characteristics.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2283-B are unable to perceive or interact with each other directly and do not appear to require sustenance or conditions required for homeostasis in non-anomalous humanoids. It is currently unknown how long instances of SCP-2283-B remain extant, though available evidence indicates no known maximum lifespan of the entities.\n\n\nThrough test detonations with Class D resources, it has been determined SCP-2283-B instances report subjective experiences consistent with continuity of consciousness between base and incorporeal states\n6\n. Foundation scientific personnel became aware of SCP-2283-B upon the interception of anomalous communications in the form of phone calls, text messages, and other electronic messages apparently composed by the entities. Personnel with security classification 2283-2 or higher should refer to logs 2283-1 through 2283-495.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2283 have been recovered in the course of Foundation security operations from a variety of groups of interest, as well as recovered from conflict zones and law enforcement agencies responding to bomb threats or reports of suspicious objects, in at least 65 different countries. Direct attacks on Foundation personnel and assets involving SCP-2283 is suspected in at least \u2588\u2588\u2588 incidents. Foundation intelligence has been unable to determine the source of SCP-2283\n7\n.\n\n\n\n\nLOG-2283-17\n\n\n\n\nLOG-2283-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a confirmed detonation of an instance of SCP-2283 [REDACTED], resulting in six civilian casualties, Foundation personnel intercepted text messages sent from a number matching the phone of SCP-2283-B-12 to POI-2283-58, the instance's father, arriving approximately five hours later. A partial transcript follows.\n\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad i love you\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad please answer there was an explosion i'm hurt\n\nPOI-2283-58: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? is that you? where have you been?\n\nPOI-2283-58: your mother and i have been worried sick. the police won't tell us anything. where are you?\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad im here\n\nPOI-2283-58: is this \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad please\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: im outside do you see me please say you see me\n\nPOI-2283-58: i'm calling the police.\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: dad why cant you see\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: please\n\nSCP-2283-B-12: it hurts so much\n\n\nPOI-2283-58 has reported similar communications from SCP-2283-B-12 on a sporadic basis for the past \u2588\u2588 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT\u00a0LOG\u00a02283-12\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT\u00a0LOG\u00a02283-12\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, upon the detection of an instance of SCP-2283 in the Battery Park City neighborhood of New York City, Foundation security operative Mitchell Sohmer attempted to destroy the instance using a remotely controlled model MK4 \"Wheelbarrow\" disposal robot. Upon successful detonation, operative Sohmer dematerialized.\n\n\nFoundation personnel have not received any communications from any entity claiming to be Sohmer subsequent to this event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM-2283-1\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM-2283-1\n\n\n\n\nThe following is excerpted from: Charalambou, L. E. (2009). 'Theoretical frameworks of anomalous terrorism: SCP-2283.' Foundation Level 3 Security Review, 8, 101-129.\n\n\n\n\nMany modern terrorism theorists ascribe to a so-called realist model of terrorism, envisioning the use of terror tactics as a rational choice made by rational agents in pursuit of concrete goals. Others from the constructivist school, or those who understand terrorism through the perspective of organizational process theory, tend to propose the fundamental nature of terrorism is a social construct, and that various actors conduct terrorist activities not just for the narrow purpose of achieving political goals, but as the predictable result of alienating social and political realities.\n\n\nEither approach envisions an act of terrorism as inflicted upon victims, but primarily intended for another party entirely - the audience, the public, who will be filled with fear. Hence the term terrorism.\n\n\nSCP-2283 is not a tool for terrorists, at least as that term is used in the mundane world of politics and violence. A non-anomalous bomb inspires fear, pain, suffering; it leaves behind physical evidence of the power of those who put it there in the form of dead bodies, maimed survivors and tortured lives. But when an SCP-2283 device detonates the victims simply disappear without the requisite carnage.\n\n\nAt least for us, the audience. But to the victim, the blast has apparently eternal consequences. Imagine: being blasted into eternal solitude, like a cursed spirit, forced to wander in isolation for all we know until the heat death of the universe.\n\n\nIn other words, very unpleasant. Thus at face value the erstwhile analyst may conclude it is a technology more suited to retaliation or revenge against specific individuals or organizations than terrorizing an entire population.\n\n\nHowever, standard models of terrorism apply to some extent \u2026 groups aware of, or engaged in the use of anomalous phenomena may be aware of the existence of SCP-2283 devices, and the threat of their use may inspire greater terror and fear than the deadliest of traditional bombs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT\u00a0LOG\u00a02283-292\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT\u00a0LOG\u00a02283-292\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/17/2016, MTF Rho-17 (\"Counter-Terrorists Win\") recovered 200 fully loaded 7.62mm magazines containing SCP-2283-A incendiary rounds from an armory in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-controlled territory in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Testing with Class D resources has demonstrated the rounds result in similar anomalous effects including the instantaneous transition of humanoid targets to a Class 4 Incorporeal Entity.\n\n\nFour members of MTF Rho-17 were reported MIA during the initial operation.
