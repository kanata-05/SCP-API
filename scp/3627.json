Any recorded instances of unprompted anomalous behavior on the part of SCP-3627 are to be reported to a supervisor of Level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3627 is a children\u2019s music box approximately 23cm x 15cm x 8cm in size. The word \u201cACROBATS\u201d is written on the front of SCP-3627, below which is a glass casing containing two acrobat figurines connected at the hands to a rotating axle. At the base of SCP-3627 is a small compartment with the phrase \u201cDREAMY JASTERS\u201d written in faded paint. No company or manufacturing labels are present on SCP-3627, and attempts to identify the origins of SCP-3627 have been unsuccessful.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-3627 manifest when a human inserts an object into SCP-3627\u2019s base compartment. Objects inserted by nonhuman entities have not triggered any anomalous phenomena. Upon the insertion of an object and the closing of the compartment, the two acrobat figurines within SCP-3627 will rotate around the central axle, and a series of chime-like sounds will be produced. The exact pattern of these sounds varies depending on the object inserted and the individual performing the insertion. A single iteration of the pattern will generally last between 5 and 15 seconds and will repeat for a period between 4 and 8 hours. Attempts to open the compartment door during this process using conventional means have been met with failure.\n\n\nSubjects who have experienced the effects of SCP-3627 report vivid and emotionally charged dreams. Although the contents of these dreams vary widely between instances, certain similarities are always present.\n\n\n\n\nDreams invoked by SCP-3627 always exhibit some relation to the inserted object, whether it be directly, through the literal presence of the object in the dream, or indirectly, through an idea or experience that the subject associates with the object.\n\n\nDespite the frequent presence of disturbing content within these dreams, subjects will ultimately view them as a positive experience, and will feel a sense of peace upon awakening.\n\n\nSubjects who experience dreams invoked by SCP-3627 will lose any prior attachments to the inserted object, as well as any personal or abstract concepts associated with said object. This is the only known permanent effect of SCP-3627.\n\n\n\n\nUpon the conclusion of the musical pattern, the object formerly inserted into SCP-3627 will no longer be present within the compartment. The location of inserted objects following their disappearance is currently unknown. In place of the object will be a 6cm x 6cm segment of paper containing a typed note.\n\n\nNotes delivered by SCP-3627 are generally between 6 and 12 lines long, \nand are loosely formatted in iambic pentameter\n (see Addendum 3627.3) with an alternating rhyme scheme. While these notes are generally only produced after the insertion of an object and the completion of SCP-3627\u2019s auditory process, the appearance of a note without the occurrence of these events has been observed on \n1\n 2 occasions. The notes themselves are non-anomalous in their physical composition. However, the written contents of the notes indicate a level of sentience on the part of SCP-3627. The notes are always directed at the subject who most recently experienced SCP-3627 auditory effects, and generally provide cryptic analysis and advice regarding their relation to the inserted object (see Addendum 3627.2 for more information). SCP-3627 always uses plural pronouns when referring to itself within these notes, suggesting that multiple entities may be responsible for SCP-3627\u2019s effects. SCP-3627 will occasionally reference its SCP status and its current location within Foundation custody, as well as knowledge of other SCPs and Foundation activities. SCP-3627\u2019s level of knowledge regarding the Foundation is currently unknown, as is its means of accessing said knowledge.\n\n\nAddendum 3627.1:\n \nInitial Discovery\n\n\nSCP-3627 was discovered by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during a routine thrift shop sweep in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Montana. Upon inspection, SCP-3627 produced the following note. No objects were inserted prior to the production of this message, and no auditory phenomena were observed.\n\n\n\n\nHello, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it seems you\u2019ve found\n\nAn object that is worth being secured\n\nContained, and yes, protected for its sound\n\nA wondrous tune that you have not yet heard\n\nJust place a gift into our waiting grasp\n\nA memory that haunts your waking mind\n\nAnd in return we shall relax the clasp\n\nThat keeps it with your soul so intertwined\n\nYour line of work is filled with those who need\n\nthe closure and the peace that we bestow\n\nBring those that are desiring of this deed\n\nwe\u2019ll ease the pain and help them to let go\n\n\n\n\nUpon realizing the note contained obvious allusions to the Foundation, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 purchased the object and delivered it to containment personnel at Site \u2588\u2588\n\n\nAddendum 3627.2:\n \nExperiment Logs\n\n\nThe following experiments detail the effects of SCP-3627 on certain individuals upon the insertion of certain objects. Information pertaining to the psychological and personal history of the subjects has been included, as it is believed to be pertinent to the resultant effects of SCP-3627.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03627-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 3627-A\n\n\nSubject:\n D-2213\n\n\nInserted Object:\n Wedding ring belonging to Subject D-2213\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Subject\u2019s husband died in an automobile accident four months prior to Foundation recruitment. Psychiatric testing has revealed severe emotional trauma resulting from this event.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject recalled dreaming of her wedding day. The dream was identical to her memories of her actual wedding day with the exception of the groom, who was motionless throughout the ceremony and appeared to be in an advanced state of decay. Neither the subject nor anyone else attending the ceremony were bothered by this. Upon being instructed to \u201ckiss the bride\u201d, the subject recalled the transfer of a warm, viscous, and malodorous fluid from the groom's mouth into her own. Subject was once again unphased, and swallowed the entirety of the fluid produced, recalling that it produced a \u201cwarm, comforting feeling\u201d inside her. Following this exchange, the groom disappeared and was absent for the duration of the ceremony. Subject awoke shortly after cutting into the wedding cake.\n\n\nUpon awakening, the subject was unbothered by the disappearance of her wedding ring. Subject reported a strong sense of closure regarding the death of her husband, stating that \u201cI know he\u2019ll always be a part of me and that he would want me to move on\u201d. Long-term psychiatric analysis has confirmed a notable improvement in the subject\u2019s mental health.\n\n\nThe note produced by SCP-3627 following this experiment is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNo pain is like the bondage of two souls\n\nDetached by cruel and unforgiving fate\n\nBut true pain is when one\u2019s own grief controls\n\nThe life that still remains under its weight\n\nWe cannot say for sure if you will meet\n\nAgain upon a distant rising dawn\n\nBut if your memories are still complete\n\nYour lover\u2019s soul is never truly gone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03627-B\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 3627-B\n\n\nSubject:\n D-4256\n\n\nInserted Object:\n Standard #2 Pencil\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Subject enjoys drawing as a recreational hobby.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject recalled dreaming of a windowless brick room lit by a single incandescent light bulb. The room bore a heavy resemblance to the basement of the subject\u2019s childhood home. Subject recalled frantically scribbling on dozens of sheets of paper and taping them to the left wall of the room. Once finished, the scribblings formed the shape of a humanoid figure. The humanoid figure then emerged from the papers and became a three-dimensional being resembling the subject, although with slight differences in facial structure. Subject then recalled being assaulted by the figure and pressed against the wall, causing him to become a two dimensional being confined to the papers. Subject at this point entered an omniscient point of view, as he saw the figure exit the room through a previously nonexistent door which lead into the street of a suburban neighborhood. At this point, the passage of time appeared to increase in rate, as houses on either side of the street gradually decayed and were overgrown by plant life. The figure was seemingly unaffected by this process, and stood motionlessly in the street. After several minutes, the passage of time returned to a normal rate, and a mushroom cloud indicative of a nuclear detonation appeared in the distance. Subject awoke shortly after watching the figure slowly melt in the street and detecting a strong odor of burning paper.\n\n\nUpon awakening, the subject showed little interest in drawing. Subject displays no displeasure toward drawing, and was able to draw upon instruction with the same level of skill as before, but stated that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel any desire to do it anymore\u201d. To date, the subject still has not partaken in drawing or any other visual artistic medium without being instructed to do so.\n\n\nThe note produced by SCP-3627 following this experiment is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe one and only noble goal of man\n\nTo leave one\u2019s mark forever on the Earth\n\nIs strived for through whatever means one can\n\nCreate a piece of true artistic worth\n\nAlas, the subtle marks upon one\u2019s soul\n\nCannot be cloned by any mortal hands\n\nA life is better lived when short and whole\n\nThan stretched across the ever shifting sands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03627-C\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 3627-C\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInserted Object:\n Video recording device remotely connected to a viewing monitor.\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Experiment aims to observe the destination of objects inserted into SCP-3627. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, head of SCP-3627 experimentation, performed the insertion in order to gain a better idea of the dreaming process.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject recalled dreaming of a hallway located in a foundation containment facility similar to site \u2588\u2588. The hallway was lined with containment cells containing numerous SCPs. Subject specifically recalled seeing SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, despite none of these SCPs being stored in the same facility in reality. Subject recalls being suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of dread, and sprinting through multiple corridors in an attempt to exit the facility. The layout of the building was nonsensical and labyrinthine, containing multiple unnecessary loops and dead ends. Upon locating an exit, the subject ran several hundred meters from the facility before gaining enough composure to look back. The facility was several hundred times larger than any active Foundation site, and had the same approximate dimensions as a human heart. The outside of the building was lined with several thousand containment cells, each containing an SCP. The facility began to beat at regular intervals, sending tremors through the surrounding area. Subject recalled losing balance from the force of the vibrations. The tremors slowly increased in magnitude until the surrounding land \u201cshattered\u201d, and the subject was left falling through a \u201cblack, swirling void\u201d. Subject awoke shortly thereafter.\n\n\nUpon awakening, subject destroyed all video footage received from the inserted recording device, stating that \u201csome things are better left unexplained\u201d. Subject later submitted a formal resignation, and was administered amnestics and released.\n\n\nThe note produced by SCP-3627 following this experiment is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe human\u2019s sense of curiosity\n\nIs what puts them above the animals\n\nBut there are things that man should best not see\n\nThat can\u2019t be kept within foundation walls\n\nThe tortured minds of ancient horrors shriek\n\nTheir calls can shred the Earth and tear the skies\n\nIf their secrets you do persist to seek\n\nThen you\u2019re seeking your very own demise\n\n\n\n\nFurther experimentation on SCP-3627 has been discontinued indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3627.3:\n \nIncident Report \u2588/\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nOn \u2588/\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, 87 days after experimentation on SCP-3627 was discontinued, SCP-3627 produced a pattern of tones without the prior insertion of an object. These tones could be heard outside of SCP-3627\u2019s holding cell, and caused two D-Class personnel to fall unconscious (this was the first instance of SCP-3627 invoking REM sleep in multiple individuals at once). The pattern of tones was repeated for 2 minutes and 34 seconds, a notably shorter duration than those previously observed. Upon the conclusion of the pattern, both subjects awoke and immediately attempted to access the holding cell containing SCP-3627, first by attempting to guess the access code, then by repeatedly ramming into the cell. Their activity was eventually detected by the on-site security system, and armed Foundation personnel were dispatched to the area. Both subjects were successfully terminated before causing a containment breach. SCP-3627\u2019s containment procedures have been updated accordingly.\n\n\nThe following note was found within SCP-3627 shortly after the incident.\n\n\n\n\nWe revealed ourselves to you\n\nSo that you would take us in\n\nWe did this because we knew\n\nYou had no short supply of sin\n\nWe thought we\u2019d help you to let go\n\nto ease the guilt and help you heal\n\nbut we were fools, for now we know\n\nyou have no guilt that you could feel\n\nYou really think you\u2019re going good\n\nwith all that you collect\n\nBut then again, of course you would\n\nSecure.
