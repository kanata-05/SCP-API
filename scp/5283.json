Seriously. I have tried everything. Manpower. Blades. Saws. Fire - no, you do not need to remind me of how big of a failure that was. Detonation charges. I even spent over an hour shouting at the damn thing! No matter what I do, it doesn't budge. Nothing! I feel like I'm going insane. I've become a laughingstock here. The guy who \"can't even move a nerf dart.\" It's degrading.\n\n\nIf you have any ideas, I'd \nlove\n to hear them.

Since its removal, all anomalous effects have ceased and SCP-5283 has been reclassified as \"Neutralized.\"\n\n\nDr. Wilson has since started seeing a Foundation therapist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
