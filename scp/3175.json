Toys, books, games and other stimulation are to be provided at the discretion of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-3175 is to be allowed up to two hours of outdoor play per day under supervision.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3175 is Lonnie James \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, recorded date of birth \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2010. In all physiological respects, SCP-3175 appears to be a normal 6-year-old boy. Psychologically and cognitively, SCP-3175 displays a number of abnormalities which remain unexplained.\n\n\nSCP-3175 claims to be Edwin Makepeace \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, recorded date of birth \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1956\n1\n. According to SCP-3175, sometime during the night of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016, after celebrating his 60th birthday, he found his consciousness transported by means unknown into the body of SCP-3175.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-3175 came to the attention of the Foundation in 2016 during a routine review of school records as part of Project SAMSARA. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was flagged as possibly of interest to Project SAMSARA based on repeated disciplinary action for \u201ctelling the most ridiculous lies\u201d in class. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was subjected to preliminary psychological screening under the supervision of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and although not found to meet the inclusion criteria for Project SAMSARA, was subsequently catalogued as SCP-3175. SCP-3175 was taken into Foundation custody under the cover story of the fatal rupture of a previously undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm. SCP-3175 has been transferred to secure housing at Site \u2588\u2588.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\n\n\nPre-Classification\u00a0Evaluation,\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u00a0Lonnie\u00a0James,\u00a0\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016\n\n\n\n\nPre-Classification\u00a0Evaluation,\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u00a0Lonnie\u00a0James,\u00a0\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTESTS ORDERED:\n\n\n  * STANDARD INTELLIGENCE SCALE, 5TH ED.

Did up the whole downstairs, like it was a kid\u2019s party, you know? Balloons and streamers, ice cream and cake. You know those candles shaped like numbers? Lizzie put them on the cake.

It was the candles, okay? There was the six and there was the oh, like I said, for sixty, and I was just looking at the six. And I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be nice. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be six and to have it all to do over again.\u201d\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And then what?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And then nothing.
