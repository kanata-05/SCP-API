Joseph Barrow\n\n\nA. Ann Starse\n\n\nL-8 \"Ape Mode\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCressona, PA, USA: now designated Site-5076-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Law enforcement channels worldwide are to be monitored for clusters of missing persons reports consistent with SCP-5076 activity.\n\n\nFoundation web crawler Beta-12 (\"BANANAPEELER\") is to monitor the web for any mention of the phrase '\nOBOBAN NATION\n', as well as any related SCP-5076-related keywords.\n\n\nUpon confirmation of an SCP-5076 event, personnel are to be dispatched immediately according to procedure 'WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE', detailed in Document-5076-O.\n\n\nAll roads leading to Site-5076-1 have been redirected. A cover story detailing a nuclear meltdown having occurred on 1/18/20 has been disseminated, and all former inhabitants of Site-5076-1 legally declared dead. For a complete operational purview of Veil-keeping regarding Site-5076-1, see Document-5076-V-1.\n\n\nMTF Lambda-8 \"Ape Mode\" is to be stationed along the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1. All online activity originating from Site-5076-1 is to be monitored. If Site-5076-1's Veil is at risk due to the online activities of an SCP-5076-A instance, all internet connection to Site-5076-1 is to be cut off for a duration of 5 hours, and the offending SCP-5076-A instance reprimanded.\n\n\nEntrance to Site-5076-1 outside of a Veil-restoring operation or as a member of the 5076 Cultural Exchange Liaison is forbidden without the express permission of Area-179's director, and a unanimous vote by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nEntities entering or exiting Site-5076-1 without authorization are to be neutralized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5076 refers to an anomalous event in which the inhabitants of a moderately sized human population center spontaneously disappear, followed by the appearance of sapient members of the \nPongo\n genus.\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-5076 has only occurred once- in Cressona, Pennsylvania- a northeastern borough formerly holding a human population of around 1500. Cressona has since been designated Site-5076-1.\n\n\nThe orangutan specimens inhabiting Site-5076-1- labeled SCP-5076-A, demonstrate intelligence and vocal capabilities comparable to humans as well as a \u2588\u2588-class technological proficiency. Human art, religion, and culture seem to be major topics of interest to SCP-5076-A.\n\n\nDue to the nature of their appearance at Site-5076-1, SCP-5076-A claims regarding the history and culture of their species cannot be verified. Notable claims include:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5076-A vocalize using a 'universal communication field', and are capable of speech with any biological life\n\n\nSCP-5076-A have no connection to non-anomalous members of the \nPongo\n genus existing on earth- referring to them as 'crude effigies'\n\n\nSCP-5076-A are a race of inter-dimensional nomads known as the \nObobans\n\n\nSCP-5076-A have existed long before humanity\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5076-A have constructed what appears to be a religious shrine at the center of Site-5076-1; a random assortment of machinery- including wires, cables, automobile and computing components- arranged and modified in a way that serves no apparent purpose or function. All SCP-5076-A instances have been observed to gather around this structure at 20:00 daily, appearing to meditate as a group for hours on end. SCP-5076-A have refused to disclose the meaning of this ritual.\n\n\nA number of religious artifacts written in an unknown language have been recovered from Site-5076-1- seemingly having materialized alongside SCP-5076-A- partly validating claims regarding a history. A translation of these texts- made possible through the assistance of orangutan priests- is pending.\n\n\nIn order to gain a more holistic understanding of \nOboban\n society and beliefs, the 5076 Cultural Liaison was established. For documentation of information gained through this program, see files under 5076-CL-EP. As this exchange is still underway, 5076-CL-EP files will be updated routinely.\n\n\nAddendum 5076.1:\n Discovery\n\n\n@\n\nOn 1/18/2020, a staggering amount of emergency calls- mostly regarding missing persons from Cressona, Pennsylvania- came to the Foundation's attention. A large-scale amnestics program was enacted, and the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1 was secured. A misinformation campaign regarding a nuclear meltdown was disseminated into media and law enforcement channels.\n\n\nHours later, a website operating under the name '\nOBOBAN NATION\n' was discovered, hosted from servers in Cressona. The entire website, sans the title, was written in an unknown text. The page depicted images and videos of SCP-5076-A instances engaging in routine activities at Site-5076-1. Scenes depicted \nOboban\n families caring for their offspring, a recording depicting a ritual revolving around the site's makeshift shrine, and a recorded message from SCP-5076-A-402- the apparent leader of \nOboban\n society, addressing the viewer in what is assumed to be the same language the website was written in. Notably, SCP-5076-A-402 does not resemble an adult orangutan.\n\n\n'\nOBOBAN NATION\n' was put under immediate digital quarantine.\n\n\nAddendum 5076.2:\n Engagement Log Transcripts\n\n\nEngagement of SCP-5076-A occurred on 5/19/2020. Because of his experience with dangerous anomalies, as well as his [DATA EXPUNGED], Area-179 senior researcher Dr. Edward Dune was chosen to initiate contact with SCP-5076-A. Researcher Angela Starse kept in contact with Dune via radio.\n\n\nA body camera was attached to Dr. Dune's person for documentation purposes. Transcripts of the engagement mission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Access\u00a0File:\u00a0Engagement\u00a0Mission-5076.1-1,\u00a0Codename:\u00a0First\u00a0Contact\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Recording>\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n You on?\n\n\nDr. Dune:\n Check.\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n Be nice.\n\n\n<A makeshift barricade of automobiles surrounds the immediate perimeter of Site-5076-1.

Doctor, we mean you no harm. Our appearance here will not be permanent. It is best that you leave.\n\n\nDr. Dune:\n \n<shouting>\n Can't. Sentient monkeys appear out of the sky and now fifteen-hundred people are missing? Oh, ape-man, you don't know the Foundation.\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n Sapient.\n\n\nSCP-5076-A-328:\n You will be of no assistance to us. Guards, hold position.

We just want to play a couple games here and there, nothing major.\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n Sir, I can't guarantee anything at the moment- but I'm sure we can find a compromise. An isolated network might be a possibility, but as it stands- nothing will get done without compliance on your part as well. Do you see what I'm getting at?\n\n\nSCP-5076-A-402:\n You want your friend back.\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n That would be a start.\n\n\nSCP-5076-A-402:\n He's in there. \n<gesturing towards a closet>\n\n\n<Starse appears to hold back laughter>\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n May I retrieve him?\n\n\nSCP-5076-A-402:\n It doesn't matter to me, he's an asshole.\n\n\nResearcher Starse:\n That may be true.\n\n\n<Starse opens the closet.

Nothing major, really- except, oh- it seems that you've misspelled orangutan in every goddamn instance of the word.\n\n\n36! 36 fucking times you used the word 'orangutang'. 36 times I had to correct a middle-school level mistake in what's going to be an official Foundation document. What the hell, Ang? Just because you're hanging around a bunch of primates doesn't give you the excuse to start spelling like one. Get your shit together.\n\n\nAnyways, I had another question: why are you writing as if this wasn't just a one-time thing? SCP-5076 should be designated Cressona, not the event of monkeys appearing out of thin air, yeah? It's ultimately your call, but it's something to consider. I doubt Roman's going to approve of those conprocs just because there's a \nslight\n chance it'll happen again. Maybe I'm missing something, though. It's late. Get back to me soon.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDr. Edward T. Dune, Senior Researcher, Area-179\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNEW MESSAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Edward Dune (\nten.pcs.hcrsr|enud.e#ten.pcs.hcrsr|enud.e\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Researcher Angelina Starse (\nten.pcs.hcrsr|esrats.a#ten.pcs.hcrsr|esrats.a\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:SCP-5076 File Draft Peer Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward, it was a spelling error. This is why you're a frequent topic of discussion for Site Administration.\n\n\nOnto business- yes, you have every right to question my judgement on the SCP-5076 denotation. In fact, I was midway through the first draft when I got news from the Liaison team. Those translations they were working on with \nBo'naub\n are done. He was reluctant to translate this particular book, but felt he was 'doing the right thing'- apparently against the wishes of \nGabo'an\n.\n\n\nI took a look at them, and- well, I think it's best for you to see for yourself.\n\n\nPet theory: that thing they're building in the center of town? It's not a shrine. It's a communications tower, and every night they're sending a distress signal to whatever is left of their race.\n\n\nI've attached the addendum below. You'll see what I mean. We should be cautious, Edward.\n\n\nI'm not sure what we've gotten ourselves into.\n\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nAngelina Starse, Senior Researcher, Area-179\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5076.3:\n Recovered and Translated Artifact from Site-5076-1\n\nThe following is a translated portion from the SCP-5076-A religious text- \nOn Creation, and its End\n- supposedly written by a great Oboban prophet-king, foretelling the 'death of life', and the last days of SCP-5076-A society:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe, great Progenitors of Life,\n\n\nUniverse, sing to us\n\n\nOur Creations bear Creations,\n\n\nImages of us\n\n\nEons, this will be so\n\n\nI say, this will be so\n\n\nAll 13 Houses of Bo-Too'a\n\n\nUnited, creating, traveling\n\n\nWe, nomad Gods of Life\n\n\nCreations, vast and without end\n\n\nWill one day fall\n\n\nIn the Millennia of the Damned\n\n\nHe will come\n\n\nThe Tribes Shall Be Split\n\n\non the Black Night of His arrival\n\n\nOur Canvas shall cry out and soon be silenced\n\n\nBy the Jaws of His Presence\n\n\nWe shall run, endlessly throughout our Creation\n\n\nHe will pursue\n\n\nWe will scatter, to the depths and cracks of Our Canvas\n\n\nEach time, He will find us\n\n\nBrothers and Sisters lost, awaiting contact\n\n\nHe has already found them\n\n\nWherever our House be built\n\n\nHe will dismantle it\n\n\nI say to you, listen\n\n\nHis coming is swift- His pursuit endless\n\n\nDread Devourer of Stars, He is inescapable\n\n\nThe Prison of Glass cannot stand\n\n\nThe Chains of String cannot hold\n\n\nThe Blaspheme of Order cannot continue\n\n\nWherever we roam\n\n\nThe Death of Life follows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5075\n | SCP-5076 | \nSCP-5077\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5076\n\" by J Dune, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Addendum 5076.1: Discovery @ On 1/18/2020, a staggering amount of emergency calls- mostly regarding missing persons from Cressona, Pennsylvania- came to the Foundation's attention. A large-scale amnestics program was enacted, and the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1 was secured. A misinformation campaign regarding a nuclear meltdown was disseminated into media and law enforcement channels.\nHours later, a website operating under the name ' OBOBAN NATION ' was discovered, hosted from servers in Cressona. The entire website, sans the title, was written in an unknown text. The page depicted images and videos of SCP-5076-A instances engaging in routine activities at Site-5076-1. Scenes depicted Oboban families caring for their offspring, a recording depicting a ritual revolving around the site's makeshift shrine, and a recorded message from SCP-5076-A-402- the apparent leader of Oboban society, addressing the viewer in what is assumed to be the same language the website was written in. Notably, SCP-5076-A-402 does not resemble an adult orangutan.\n' OBOBAN NATION ' was put under immediate digital quarantine.",
        "Addendum 5076.2: Engagement Log Transcripts\nEngagement of SCP-5076-A occurred on 5/19/2020. Because of his experience with dangerous anomalies, as well as his [DATA EXPUNGED], Area-179 senior researcher Dr. Edward Dune was chosen to initiate contact with SCP-5076-A. Researcher Angela Starse kept in contact with Dune via radio.\nA body camera was attached to Dr. Dune's person for documentation purposes. Transcripts of the engagement mission are listed below.\n"
