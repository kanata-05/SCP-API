The presence of four security personnel is required prior to entry. Restraints may not be removed unless specifically required for testing. For communication purposes SCP-1360 is to be provided with a pen and notebook.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1360 is an animate, fully articulated android. SCP-1360 stands at 1.83\u00a0m tall and weighs 100\u00a0kg. Two white PMMA circles, approximately 3\u00a0cm in diameter, represent the android\u2019s eyes. SCP-1360\u2019s body is composed of molded polycarbonate casings over an aluminum frame. These casings are covered in a black fabric of unknown composition, referred to as SCP-1360-1. This covering acts as a skin and has a universal thickness of 1\u00a0cm. The serial number 031 is woven into SCP-1360\u2019s left arm in a red variant of SCP-1360-1.\n\n\nTesting to identify SCP-1360-1 has so far met with limited success. The material is a type of aramid fiber with a tensile strength of approximately 4000\u00a0MPa, along with a gravity of 1.1, making the material lighter and stronger than Kevlar. The material is self-repairing, with adjacent damaged SCP-1360-1 fibers reweaving and fusing back together. SCP-1360-1 is also capable of repairing damage to SCP-1360\u2019s polycarbonate casings, as SCP-1360-1 fibers will fill in damaged areas during the repair of the outer covering. All samples of SCP-1360-1 disintegrate after 48 hours of separation from SCP-1360.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA section of SCP-1360-1 harvested from SCP-1360's lower back on 08/09/2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1360\u2019s fingers contain a series of tools. These tools are accessed by unscrewing the tip of the finger, and include:\n\n\n\n\nA steel needle attached to a roll of red thread made from the same material as SCP-1360-1. (Left thumb)\n\n\nA roll of patches made of the same material as SCP-1360-1: 5.1\u00a0cm wide. (Left index)\n\n\nA pair of miniature steel fabric scissors. (Right thumb)\n\n\nA steel scalpel (Right index)\n\n\n\n\nBoth middle and ring fingers are hollow and serve as storage space.\n\n\nSCP-1360 is intelligent and displays a clear knowledge of unarmed combat and firearms usage. It is obsessed with escaping and subsequent return to an entity it refers to as \u201c\nAnderson.\n\u201d\n\n\nSCP-1360 claims to feel pain despite its apparent lack of a nervous system. It claims that this pain is the result of a component having been removed prior to containment and as a result views itself as incomplete.\n\n\nDespite being incapable of speech, SCP-1360 can read and write English, Japanese and German fluently. Interviews have been moderately successful, though escape and repair are favorite topics of conversation.\n\n\nAddendum: 1360-A:\n The following message was discovered on a flash drive within SCP-1360\u2019s right middle finger upon recovery.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT DISCARD\n\nDear James,\n\n\nCongratulations on the purchase of your new \nPeregrine Series Humanoid Utility Droid (Civilian Model)\n. Unit #31 comes equipped with the following standard features:\n\n\n\n\nPreprogrammed Personality #4 (Hector).\n\n\nFull understanding of up to three languages (English, Japanese and German).\n\n\nOur standard aramid covering and full self-repair functionality.\n\n\n\n\nAs you discussed with Mr. Saker during your consultation meeting, #31 has also been altered to include your requested modifications, these include:\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of Vocalization Capabilities.\n\n\nOur Advanced Firearms Skill Set.\n\n\nOur Advanced Unarmed Combat Skill Set.\n\n\n\n\nLike the \nKestrel\n and \nMerlin\n units you have purchased, #31 has been programmed to take commands only from yourself and your daughter. In addition it can also serve as a command unit. With your permission, #31 is capable of issuing commands to your other droids in your absence.\n\n\nIt is important to note, however, that unlike your previous purchases, #31 contains a highly adaptive artificial intelligence to make the unit\u2019s interactions more human and personal. #31\u2019s personality will evolve over time based on its interactions with you and your use of the unit. Within a matter of days #31 can become both your daughter\u2019s best friend and your most loyal servant.\n\n\nAs with your other units, please do not attempt to repair #31 if malfunctioning. In the event that you become unsatisfied with the unit\u2019s performance, please lock this flash drive back into place within the right middle finger storage compartment and speak your return phrase. #31 will then automatically return to one of our facilities and you will be contacted with more information on replacing or refunding your purchase.\n\n\nAs always, it\u2019s a pleasure doing business with you.\n\n\nAnderson\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: 1360-B:\n On \n17/11/2009\n, following a fourth failed escape attempt, the following note was found in SCP-1360-\u2019s cell:\n\n\n\n\nReturn signal terminated. We\u2019re better off keeping you where you are.\n\n\nWe\u2019re sorry, #31.\n\n\nAnderson\n\n\n\n\nAs of this date SCP-1360 has ceased all communication with Foundation personnel. In addition, SCP-1360 has also ceased all resistance to containment and SCP-1360-1 collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1359\n | SCP-1360 | \nSCP-1361\n \u00bb",
