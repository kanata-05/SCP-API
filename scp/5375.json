The empty cell is the slot for the DeVry Core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:\n Anderson Systems executives are fully cooperating in an effort to locate and secure SCP-5375. Due to the involvement of SCP-5353, the investigation is being headed by MTF \u03b8-15 (\"Nametaggers\"). The PANOPTICON system is operating at peak efficiency and should be capable of triangulating the location of PoI-0000 (Nobody) should they come in range of a node or Aerial Surveillance Drone.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-5375 is a proprietary piece of paratechnology developed by Anderson Systems, LLC, identified by the codename \"the Name Machine\". SCP-5375 was designed & constructed under an exclusive contract between the Foundation and Anderson Systems, and kept strictly confidential by both parties. Information tracing is ongoing to discover any unauthorized individuals who could feasibly have discovered SCP-5375's existence.\n\n\nSCP-5375's stated purpose is to more effectively combat and contain identity-based cognitohazards and paramemes. It accomplishes this through a mixture of paratechnology and traditional engineering, the specifics of which are available with proper clearance at the \nSCP-5375 Full Schematic Dossier\n. SCP-5375 is capable of extracting identity-based concepts and topologies from individuals or objects, applying them to other individuals or objects, or fabricating such concepts and identities to apply to semantically null individuals or objects, given a 'source' to pull concepts from. At the time of loss, SCP-5375 had only been tested in controlled laboratory conditions.\n\n\nSCP-5375 was stolen from its secure location in Lab 34E of the Anderson Complex, New Portland, on 09.27.2077, by an unidentified party of two individuals. The prototype was largely complete at this point, only lacking a critical power component removed for maintenance (the DeVry Core), paid for in full, and set to be transported into Foundation custody on 10.02.2077. The individuals evaded the significant security systems installed in the building and lab, disconnected the 5-ton prototype, and transported it out of the building without attracting attention, implying some level of anomalous capability. In addition, they possess a deleterious effect on surveillance data depicting them. Camera footage will depict them as a shifting black blur, and biometric sensors fail to record any data when they enter or exit a facility. Whether this is anomalous ability or technologically-based is currently unclear.\n\n\nHowever, by piggybacking onto these tracking systems, global surveillance and identification system PANOPTICON was able to track the physical presence of one individual by identifying the absence of data wherever they appeared, effectively creating an informational silhouette. The ability of individual to evade the PANOPTICON is a pressing threat to Foundation security interests; Engagement Rule B-19 \"Good Hunting\" is in effect for the remaining individual.\n\n\nFoundation Fast-Response Fireteams aerially deployed to the discovered individual's location in a disused warehouse on Bumaro Plaza and forcibly took them into custody for questioning. At this point, it became clear that this individual was \nSCP-5353\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5375.1\n\n\nLOGS \u2014 09.30.2077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERROGATION LOG - SCP-5353\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n Prior to the arrest, SCP-5353's location had been triangulated via PANOPTICON nodes and MTF \u03c0-1 (\"City Slickers\") established a secure perimeter, diverting public aircar traffic with the explanation of a potentially dangerous anomaly on the premises. FRFT7 deployed aerially through the roof of the factory, engaging in a small firefight with SCP-5353 before disabling him with nonlethal charges. Further investigation revealed a small cot and living space set up in a former office, indicating that he had been present there for some time. SCP-5375 was not found on the premises.\n\nAn injured member of FRFT7 was medevaced to Our Lady Saint Hedwig Memorial Hospital for medical care. SCP-5353 was taken into holding at Mass Containment Site Beta for questioning by MTF \u03b8-15 (\"Nametaggers\") Captain Aleksander Maliz.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Well, \ngood\n evening.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Hello. You're SCP-5353, correct? The Man in the White Suit?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Huh. Yeah, that's me. I can't say I expected anyone to remember.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n My name is Captain Maliz-\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n \nAh.\n That explains that. Tyler's son, taking up the old family mantle?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Tyler Maliz was my uncle.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Making Hester your\u2026 I see. Funny how fate seems to fit us together.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Sure. I was saying, I'd like to talk to you about SCP-5375. The Name Machine.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n What makes you think I know anything about that?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Because I haven't even explained what it is yet.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Ah, bollocks.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n And we have surveillance records of you from before the Drop, 2019. The day you met my uncle, actually. Even then, you had the exact same effect on the old CCTV cameras as Nobody. You were in the Anderson building with Nobody. You took the Machine, or you know where Nobody has it. And you're going to tell me.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n And why would I do that, son?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Why wouldn't you?\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Hell does that mean?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n I know the history. You've been hunting Nobody since World War I - \na hundred and fifty years.\n What changed, I wonder - why are you now willing to cover for it?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I haven't exactly been hunting Nobody though, have I?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Yeah? Then what were you doing when you met my grandmother and my uncle?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I was hunting what it leaves behind. Husks, shells of people. The empty wrappers it leaves behind when it's done feasting.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Why?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n What do you think I am? What do you think the connection between us is?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n You're Nobody's foil. You exist only in opposition to him.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Not entirely wrong, but not what I was looking for. I'm a walking reminder of Nobody's body count.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n I don't understand.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I contain multitudes, mate. I'm every single body it left behind, wrapped neat into a package with a bow on top. No one mourns the forgotten, it's why they're forgotten. So I give them a second chance; an opportunity to end Nobody's cycle.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n So\u2026 are you a person, or some sort of hive-mind?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Neither. Certainly not a hive mind\u2026 but I can't exactly be a person either. I'm not sure I ever really existed at all. I just became.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Then what changed? If I was you, I'd be out there aiming for Nobody's skull.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n The\u2026. situation has changed. A new element is in play, and it could very well change the game.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n The Machine.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Aren't you a sharp one? Just like your grandmother.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n What do you plan to use it for?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Sorry, not sharp enough. We're not there yet, and I'd be remiss to spoil the show.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n You don't have to. The machine builds identities, you two are without them\u2026 it won't work, you know.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n What?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n You're pushing the machine to do something it wasn't meant to do - it fabricated a few identities under trial conditions, and it can't make more than one at a time without some sort of base source. It'll have to consume something, someone, for more.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Two's not that much more than one.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Not that you'll ever get the opportunity as it stands. But, tell us where Nobody has the machine\u2026 maybe we can work something out.\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I'll take my chances.\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n This is the part where you get mad, call me a cryptic asshole and then leave.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n You are a cryptic asshole, but this is more than you've ever talked to us. I know where I stand in these matters. Do you?\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n You think I could get a carton of cigs?\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Cigarettes? Christ, no. It's not the 2020s anymore.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Fuck off.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n Captain Maliz reported that SCP-5353 appeared visibly disturbed by his questioning through the interview. Another interrogation was scheduled for the following day, while PANOPTICON nodes and FRFTs were placed on high alert for possible Nobody movement on the streets or skytops. The New Portland Peacekeeper Wing was also forwarded information on Nobody to maximize nodes of detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAMERA LOGS - ANDERSON L.C.F\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n On 9.31.2077 at 3:26 AM (local time), security at Anderson Systems' Las Cruces Facility, a New Mexico campus host to a number of skunkworks projects, reported a break-in in the area of Simurgh Labs, the research group responsible for the development and construction of SCP-5375. Only one item was reported missing - a component of SCP-5375, the DeVry Core, that was awaiting shipment to the greater Anderson Complex in New Portland.

Gas in the vent makes it difficult to see but the figure continues their scooting down the pipe.]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Nobody eats your identity, it's what it always does. It's in the nature of the thing. But, I figure that it's not instantaneous.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n You figure? Shouldn't you know better than anyone? You're his victims.\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n No. That's not true. I'm not his victims, I'm only made of them. It only leaves shreds of identity left\u2026 but add enough shreds together and you get something resembling a painting, no? I\n\n\nMALIZ:\n So you're saying you're something else entirely?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I'm saying I'm greater than the sum of my parts. But as I was saying\u2026\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Sure.\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n The consumption isn't instantaneous. It takes a while for it to shear through what makes you \nyou.\n And I'm getting the sense that\u2026 you were right.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n About what?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n Something's different this time around.

Two boots pop out as the figure extricates themself from the air-conditioning vent and drops to the floor. No one else is visible in the hallways. The figure starts briskly jogging down one of the paths.]\n\n\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Okay - the host, then. What's different?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I don't know. Maybe his will is stronger or maybe it's just not been long enough, but he still has some vestiges of humanity left. For better or for worse.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n That's enough to make you trust him? Really?\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n No. I wasn't entirely truthful earlier.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n No kidding. About what?\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n I have been hunting Nobody. I didn't start out that way, but somewhere along the line I forgot why I was doing all of it and got caught up in the kill.\n\n\nMALIZ:\n Yeah, I know what you mean. But decades, really?\n\n\n[Rattling.]\n\n\nSCP-5353:\n It's a war across centuries.

FRFTs attempted to locate Nobody or SCP-5353 but were unsuccessful. The remains of SCP-5375 were found in the basement of the warehouse, largely destroyed as a result of an implosion of the DeVry Core. The blast's temporary shutdown of PANOPTICON rendered any standard identification of survivors infeasible; many individuals were let go without a full identity scan.
