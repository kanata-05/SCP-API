All Specimens of SCP-1664 have been relocated to Site-298 for security reasons.\n\n\nAccess to SCP-1664 specimens is permitted only to staff members possessing Level 3 clearance and above. SCP-1664-1 through -5 are contained in hermetically sealed capsules located in Containment cell 1664-298-B5. Specimen -6 is contained in an A4 sheet of paper within Containment cell 1664-298-B6. Specimens -7 and -8 are contained in separate airtight containment cells and surrounded by Class 8 Magnetic Field Gates. Any personnel interacting with SCP-1664 must be outfitted in Type 4 HazMat suits. All specimens must be monitored at all times for signs of unusual activity. In the event of an emergency, Protocol G-1664-8369-02 may be initiated by a Level 4/1664 supervisor, whereupon all areas containing samples of SCP-1664 will be exposed to an electromagnetic field of 10,000 G until a stable containment state has been achieved.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1664 is a Class 7 Liquid Organism. Visually, it resembles black ink and possesses a consistency identical to that of water. SCP-1664 exhibits the ability to process thought, consume materials, reproduce, communicate and respond to stimuli. SCP-1664 does not require food, water or oxygen for continued function. SCP-1664 is capable of learning new information and applying this knowledge to new situations. SCP-1664-8 has been successfully taught to communicate in English. SCP-1664 consumes iron and materials possessing traces of iron; it accomplishes this by exhibiting a corrosive effect on the material, breaking it down into a liquid form which is then added to SCP-1664's overall mass. This corrosive effect has not been observed with any other materials. This consumption serves as a means of reproduction. Despite not requiring iron for continued existence, SCP-1664 will exhibit hunger and will actively seek out and consume iron and iron-based material.\n\n\nWhen administered to a biological entity, SCP-1664 will, over the course of 72 hours, convert all iron-rich biological matter present within the host to SCP-1664. Notably, converted subjects will not return to an entirely liquid form following total infestation. Instead, host forms will enter a state of semiliquidity. Converted subjects will exhibit some liquid attributes, such as the ability to move through small spaces and revert to a consistent shape after being dispersed. Converted hosts will revert back to the original host\u2019s physiology while idle. Converted subjects are capable of verbal communication, regardless of the host's prior form. Subject's speech will remain incomprehensible prior to learning new languages. Currently, the only known method of significantly damaging SCP-1664 and related specimens is through the use of powerful magnetic fields. Any field above 9,925 G is capable of affecting SCP-1664. Short term exposure (under 30 minutes) will only temporarily disable SCP-1664's properties. However, any long term exposure (over 30 minutes) will permanently render the substance inert. Converted hosts exposed to fields of this magnitude will exhibit extreme pain before being rendered unconscious and eventually expiring.\n\n\nInterview Log:\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Designation:\n INT-1664-291-8-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-1664-8 [Formerly D-1664-2740]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor:\n Dr. Harper\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Moor\n\n\n\n\nLOG TRANSCRIPT BEGIN\n\n\nDr. Moor:\n Test\u2026 Testing, hello?

All hosts were hunted down and contained, then destroyed.\n\n\nThe building has since been seized by one of the Foundation's fronts and remains under constant surveillance. Any and all mention of Caelum Cervi's Tattoo Parlour and Bar, along with the Caelum Cervi website have been scrubbed from both digital and physical sources. A total of 302 civilians have been administered B-Class Amnestics.\n\n\n\n\nCaelum Cervi's Tattoo Parlour and Bar advertisement [Translated from Spanish]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want a tattoo , but I fear it will not stand out?

I'm asking because I've used it on a few friends just a test and a few things don't seem to be working. The ink itself looks like it works, but none of the command spells in this book you gave me are working on them! They're just wandering around like a bunch of drunkards, yelling things I don't understand and stealing all the cutlery in the bar.\n\n\nI swear to god, man. You had better not have scammed me, here. I've tried everything! I even tried some of the spells in the back of the book that you said were for emergencies only and not even they work! What do I do?

But apparently you weren't listening. So I'll say it again: The spells only work between the hours of 11:00pm and 1:00am. If you try them at any time other than that, you'll just make a fool of yourself.\n\n\nDon't email me back unless you somehow manage to fuck that up, too.\n\n\nPeace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Caelum-Cervi@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nTo:\n Demeter@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n re:re:Some questions\n\n\nDate:\n04-04-12\n\n\nOf course I fucking remember what you told me! What do you think I am? Some kind of retard?\n\n\nThe spells don't fucking work, man. They worked when you showed them to me but when I try them, nothing happens! Now I have 15 fucking people in my basement bashing on the door! And I have more clients tomorrow, too!

Just got a few questions about this magic ink of yours. I'm asking because I've used it on a few friends just a test and a few things don't seem to be working. The ink itself looks like it works, but none of the command spells in this book you gave me are working on them! They're just wandering around like a bunch of drunkards, yelling things I don't understand and stealing all the cutlery in the bar. I swear to god, man. You had better not have scammed me, here. I've tried everything! I even tried some of the spells in the back of the book that you said were for emergencies only and not even they work! What do I do? I locked the guys up in the basement but I have like 10 appointments later today, I can't keep everybody down there! Get back to me as soon as possible.",

But apparently you weren't listening. So I'll say it again: The spells only work between the hours of 11:00pm and 1:00am. If you try them at any time other than that, you'll just make a fool of yourself. Don't email me back unless you somehow manage to fuck that up, too. Peace.",

    "description": "SCP-1664 is a Class 7 Liquid Organism. Visually, it resembles black ink and possesses a consistency identical to that of water. SCP-1664 exhibits the ability to process thought, consume materials, reproduce, communicate and respond to stimuli. SCP-1664 does not require food, water or oxygen for continued function. SCP-1664 is capable of learning new information and applying this knowledge to new situations. SCP-1664-8 has been successfully taught to communicate in English. SCP-1664 consumes iron and materials possessing traces of iron; it accomplishes this by exhibiting a corrosive effect on the material, breaking it down into a liquid form which is then added to SCP-1664's overall mass. This corrosive effect has not been observed with any other materials. This consumption serves as a means of reproduction. Despite not requiring iron for continued existence, SCP-1664 will exhibit hunger and will actively seek out and consume iron and iron-based material.",
