Every morning he\u2019d boil the rag in hot water, dry it, and soak it in the fat of his breakfast. He\u2019d chew on that cloth all day long, every minute of the day. The act was maddening; always chewing, never swallowing, but it kept him from a deeper madness.\n\n\nJoshua packed up his camp and made his way down the silent highway; a nettle-grove of empty cars and twisted rebar. He gave each vehicle a quick glance as he passed, but he never slowed, and he never hoped. He knew better. Besides, he wasn\u2019t here for prizes. He was using the highway for it's intended purpose; a quick route from here to there.\n\n\nTo the light in the window.\n\n\nHe\u2019d seen it two days ago from across the city: a single glowing plane on the 24th floor of a high-rise, nestled deep in the forest of skyscrapers. His vision narrowed on it even now, dark as it was in the daylight. It was like a familiar face across a distant room. It called to him. It could mean\u2026 it might mean\u2026\n\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d\n\n\nJoshua flinched and turned. He'd been staring at the window, and had forgotten his surroundings. He'd been spotted. They were coming for him now.\n\n\nA figure came barreling out from between two trucks, tall and skeletal, running at him with hands outstretched.\n\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d it screamed. \"I need it! Please! I'm so-\u201d\n\n\nThe gunshot rang out. It echoed across the whole, empty city. Birds would have taken wing, flying up from the nearby trees\u2026 but of course, neither had existed in a long, long time. Here and now, the thing took three more trembling steps, one hand still outstretched. Then, it collapsed.\n\n\nJoshua didn't lower his gun. He knew there\u2019d be consequences for the sound. He checked his blind spots. Sure enough, there were a half dozen more, watching him with their sunken eyes. Most stayed crouched, but one had come to stand in the center in the road. The way it looked at him\u2026 it was almost taunting Joshua for a repeat performance. Begging, maybe. It was impossible to tell; there was barely any face left to read. Joshua held his breath and waited for the coin-flip decision. Would they rush him, or\u2026\n\n\nNo, they slunk off, one by one crawling over car hoods and through concrete rubble. The standing one stayed the longest, watching Joshua until the last moment before walking away.\n\n\nJoshua exhaled. He stood over his kill. One shot, through the neck. Clean. Lucky. They never had much neck on them, just a thin chicken bone propping up the head. This one was no different, all hollow cheeks and browning teeth. Joshua worked the tip of his machete against the things ribs; the gangrenous, bone-flattened flesh was a thin as rice paper. No meat.\n\n\nUseless.\n\n\n\n\nIt was late in the day before Joshua reached the high rise. Silently, he climbed the many flights of stairs, satchel held tight under his arm. It was light. Too light. He chewed roughly on the fabric in his mouth, dull and flavorless. It made his stomach churn, but he had to. He couldn\u2019t end up like them. \nNothing else was more important.\n He chewed so hard his gums began to bleed.\n\n\nRoom 2405.\n\n\nThe door wasn't locked; it wasn't even fully closed. As Joshua stepped inside, the apartment seemed like every other home he\u2019d ever trespassed upon, all bare shelves and broken cabinets, full of grime and absence. Family photos and personal trinkets laid broken on the floor. No one had cared when things got bad.\n\n\nA young man sat on the couch. He wore a filthy t-shirt and jeans, his black hair long and unkempt. His skin was sickly, but rounded, sitting over a bed of real fat, muscle and sinew.\n\n\nHe looked up as Joshua entered. They stared at each other in one long, empty moment before the young man turned back to a tiny, flickering screen on the coffee table.\n\n\nJoshua approached the arm of the sofa, pulling the cloth out of his mouth, staring at the smartphone with a mix of surprise and awe. The cracked screen was alive with flowing light and motion. Joshua couldn't recall the last time he'd seen a lit screen, but then again, he hadn't really been looking.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d Joshua asked.\n\n\n\u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d the young man replied. His voice was dry and cracking, but still filled with youthful energy. \u201cIt's a kind of Japanese cartoon. It's really good. I was actually going to visit Japan, y\u2019know, before this all happened. I had this whole show saved on my phone for the plane ride so\u2026 I figured I might as well finish it.\u201d\n\n\nAnother moment passed.\n\n\n\u201cLooks cool.\u201d Joshua finally said, then glancing around the room. \u201cDo you have any-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFood?\u201d the young man finished. \u201cNo. I ran out yesterday.\"\n\n\n\u201cShame.\u201d Joshua said. \u201cYou know they\u2019ll see the light, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d the young man asked, looking away from the screen. The credits had begun to roll. A foreign, melancholy song played on the tiny speaker. \u201cAh\u2026 you mean the starving ones. Yeah, I figured they might. I don\u2019t really care much anymore. I'm too tired. I'm tired of scavenging and being hungry all the damn time. I don't care if they find me\u2026 but hey, looks like you found me instead!\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled. His teeth were yellow. His gums were pale pink. \u201cIsn\u2019t that lucky? It\u2019s been a long time since I had anyone to talk to. So, tell me friend, what is your theory? Why don\u2019t they die?\u201d\n\n\nJoshua didn\u2019t reply.\n\n\n\u201cEveryone had a theory, you know, back in the early days; back when there was food. The internet was alive with speculation! How could it not be? This is like something out of a horror film! I mean, sure, they\u2019re not quite zombies; they still think, and talk, and- well, they\u2019re still human\u2026 I think. They're just starving people who don\u2019t seem to die. Still pretty damn scary, huh?\u201d\n\n\nJoshua didn't reply.\n\n\n\u201cSo! What do you think?\u201d the man asked, head falling to one side. \u201cSuper virus? Alien mind control? Some kind of government experiment?\u201d\n\n\nAfter another long, painfully quiet moment, the man finally asked what should have been his first question. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\n\nSlowly, and without a hint of malice, Joshua raised his machete.\n\n\n\u201cAh, of course.\u201d the young man said, looking back at the coffee table, folding his hands in his lap.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5055.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Containment of SCP-5055 is no longer possible.
