Testing procedures for SCP-1344 are to be authorized by the Level 3 Senior Researcher currently attached to this project, and are to only utilize visually impaired D-Class personnel with residual vision below 20%. Personnel deemed eligible are to be briefed on the positive effects of SCP-1344 on their vision to reduce the chances of an attempted removal of SCP-1344 by the subject, and on the permanent nature of exposure to SCP-1344. D-Class personnel used in testing are to be considered permanently attached to the SCP-1344 project and relocated to its attached habitation unit. New test subjects are only to be assigned to SCP-1344 upon either the death of previously assigned subject, or after the removal of SCP-1344 from an assigned subject's face. Currently, no instances of SCP-1344 are in use for testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1344 refers to a collection of five goggles of various types, all exhibiting anomalous behaviour when worn by a human being. Site-44 currently holds the following instances of SCP-1344:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1344-01: \"Swedish-style\" swimming goggles\n\n\nSCP-1344-02: AN-6530 aviation goggles\n\n\nSCP-1344-03: \u2588\u2588\u2588 brand welding goggles\n\n\nSCP-1344-04: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand paintball goggles\n\n\nSCP-1344-05: Handcrafted goggles with a design aesthetic common to the steampunk subculture\n\n\n\n\nAll SCP-1344 instances contain two hollow, telescoping needles (approximately 48\u00a0mm long and 2\u00a0mm thick), hidden in recesses in the frame. Each side of the frame contains one of these needles. Instances of SCP-1344 show no anomalous behaviour unless worn by a living human being.\n\n\nAfter approximately 5 seconds, both needles will extend and pierce the subject's eye, moving through the conjunctiva, sclera, and the interior of the eyeball before embedding themselves in the optic nerves. Though this process does not appear to cause any physical pain or discomfort in the subject\n1\n, the psychological repercussions are as expected. Subjects will, unless sedated, invariably attempt to remove the instance of SCP-1344 from their face. If allowed to proceed with removal, a subject will extract their eyeballs in their entirety from the ocular orbit. This provokes the expected physical responses. Once successfully removed, both needles retract, releasing the subject's eyeballs. Safe removal of SCP-1344 is only possible through an invasive medical procedure that leaves the patient blind.\n\n\nHowever, if the instance of SCP-1344 is not removed after its initial anomalous effect manifests, the subject's vision is gradually restored to a minimum of 50%, with a cap at 85%, over a period of 3-5 minutes.\n\n\nSubjects that do not remove an instance of SCP-1344, report seeing orbs with an average estimated diameter of 8.7\u00a0cm, and of varying colouration, hovering in place over the heads of both the majority of human beings and other mammals subjects are exposed to. These orbs move with the persons or animals in question. Tests with various species of insects, arachnids, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds have yielded no results. It is unknown why this phenomenon is only reported with the majority of human beings as opposed to all other mammals. It is noted that multiple SCP objects have been observed to have orbs of their own as well, including \nSCP-1875\n and the products of \nSCP-158\n testing. Research into the exact criteria for the manifestation of this phenomenon is ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 1344-A-01:\n \nExcerpts from testing log 1344/T/20050312:A\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2005-03-12\n\n\nTest lead:\n Senior researcher R.L.
