The cell should be modified to fit the following specifications:\n\n\n\n\nWalls should be constructed using modular concrete panels, made from a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach individual panel should measure 30\u00a0cm in width. Additionally, it is advised that these panels be lined with a polyether-based polyurethane padding with viscoelastic properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Class 2 Titan Vault Door is to be installed in replacement of standard cell entry-way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard ventilation is to be installed with a separated gas supply system. In the event of a containment breach, the system will dispense a Class-B sedative nerve agent.\n\n\n\n\nTransport teams of SCP-4128 should be equipped with an aerosolized anesthetic. SCP-4128 is currently held within Site-88 on Floor 18. An on-site psychiatrist should conduct a full psychological evaluation check every two weeks.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4128 is a human male formerly known as Samson Sachs. The entity claims to be 108 years old, despite appearance being that of middle age. Saliva-based testing has confirmed genetic makeup to be of human origin.\n\n\nSCP-4128's most notable anomalous property is its incredible mark of strength and endurance. SCP-4128 is capable of lifting 3,500\u00a0kg with ease and shows great effort when lifting over 20,000\u00a0kg. Additionally, SCP-4128 can sprint at a top speed of approximately 85\u00a0km/h, as well as perform an 18-meter vertical leap. The epidermic cells of the entity are formed from a polymeric protein, giving it an innate ability to withstand extreme physical trauma. SCP-4128's bones are eight times denser than that of the average human.\n1\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4128's existence was first discovered in 1975 through the Foundation\u2019s A.S.R.P.\n2\n, when correlating reports of a man performing impossible feats of strength came to light. The first confirmed instance by the Foundation occurred when witnesses reported a semi-truck accident in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Belgium. A woman reportedly lodged the front half of her car under a tractor-trailer. While awaiting first-responders, a man approached the car and proceeded to pull it out by the frame.\n\n\nA cover story disguised the incident as an instance of hysterical strength. Following this event, a 48 year hunt for SCP-4128 ensued, before recovery on \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, 2018 in Brooklyn, New York. This event is detailed in Recovery Incident Document-4128.\n\n\nA sample timeline of notable confirmed SCP-4128 activities, designated as L.E. (\nLimited Edition\n) Events, are reported within Evidence Documentation-4128-L.E.0138:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence\u00a0Documentation-4128-L.E.0138\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION EVENT-04\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n January 24, 1978\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Goslar, Germany\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\nPolice were surprised to find Franziska \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n3\n sitting outside the local police station. Upon initial questioning, it was discovered that she had been held captive by Daniel \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Franziska claimed to have woken in the middle of the night, finding a \"strange man\" hovering over her. In her recollection of the escape, she remarked how she was chained to the wall of the basement and repeatedly stated how the man used no equipment, but rather his hands, to break her free.\n\n\nRESPONSE:\n Class-A amnestics were administered to all individuals involved. A falsified investigation was established as the catalyst of Franziska's rescue, with embedded Foundation personnel acting as correspondents to the report. Daniel \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was later taken into custody.\n\n\n\n\nCONFISCATED EVIDENCE: NONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION EVENT-10\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n August 31, 1985\n\n\nLOCATION:\n East Los Angeles, California\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities were alerted when a group of residents had successfully apprehended Richard Ramirez, a serial killer and rapist who went under the alias of \"The Night Stalker.\" Upon arrival at Hollenbeck Police Station, Ramirez began ranting about a man with impenetrable skin. Detective George Thomas, a field agent for the Foundation, was present during this display and immediately contacted Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\"). Upon questioning by Agent Thomas, Ramirez recalled being followed by \"a man in a red barn jacket\" before fleeing across the Sante Anne Highway. Upon an attempt to carjack a woman, Ramirez noticed the man in close proximity and attempted to stab him with a kitchen knife obtained in an earlier raid. After a short chase, Ramirez was rendered unconscious, where then he awoke, surrounded by other bystanders who had joined the man.\n\n\nRESPONSE:\n MTF-Iota-10 retrieved the knife before forensics arrived at the scene. A false transcription of the interrogation was released to the public. Due to the high-profile nature of Richard Ramirez, a combination of Class-G and Class-C amnestics were used to ensure that any account of the incident would not leak to the press.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION EVENT-23\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 5th, 1990\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Austin, Texas\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\nFoundation agents intercepted a call from a local reporter regarding the inexplainable placement of a Dodge Aries on the roof of an abandoned factory. Four men were found to be trapped inside the car, visibly distressed; three of the men were armed with 9MM handguns and one with a Remington 870 shotgun. A correlation was established when reports regarding a drive-by shooting on a nearby block came to light.\n\n\nRESPONSE:\n A videotape of SCP-4128 was confiscated by Foundation personnel. The reporter, who was the sole witness to the L.E. Event, was administered a Class-B amnestic after initial interrogation. The four men were apprehended by Foundation operatives and subsequently incarcerated into D-Class personnel.\n\n\n\n\nCONFISCATED EVIDENCE:\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Screen capture shows SCP-4128 in mid-jump. The entity has shown no flight capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION EVENT-30\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n April 28, 2000\n\n\nLOCATION:\n The Bronx, New York\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\n46th Precinct Police of Bronx received a call regarding a street fight. When police arrived at the scene, a man was found lying on the pavement unconscious. Upon admittance into NYC \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Hospital, X-rays revealed a complete fracturing of the ulnar shaft and a broken jaw. Witnesses identified the man as Jason \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a local resident of an apartment complex on Unionport Road, who had been going around the complex with a gun to extort money from other residents. During one of these extortion raids, a witness reported seeing a man approach Jason, grabbing him by the arm. Jason proceeded to cry out in pain. The emergency call was made shortly after.\n\n\nRESPONSE:\n Class-A amnestics were administered to convince Jason \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of a prolonged engagement. Later court rulings found him guilty on the account of three separate charges. This use of excessive violence was recorded as a notable escalation in an L.E. Event. Recovery of SCP-4128 from here on was deemed a \nVidar\n-level priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete access to the full timeline must be approved by current Site-88 Director, Dr. Phillip Foster.\n\n\nAddendum 4128-A1:\n Genetic markers indicate that myostatin-related hypertrophy\n4\n may be involved. However, this does not fully explain all reports regarding the entity's feats, such as its ability to leap across vast distances.\n\n\n\n\nIf he were to have this condition, one would assume that SCP-4128 have immense muscular proportions previously unseen in humanoid anatomy. However, I can find no physical difference between the entity and any other athlete. If we're being completely honest, the guy's got a bit of a pudge.\n\n-Dr. Andrew Winstabt\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4128-A2:\n In a recent checkup, it was discovered that SCP-4128 had gradually been losing hearing in its left ear due to excessive bone growth putting pressure on the cranial nerves. Request for a hearing aid is pending approval. SCP-4128 has reported suffering minor seizures in the past; researchers are required to provide immediate notice to medical staff should another lapse occur.\n\n\nAddendum 4128-B1:\n A series of interviews were conducted in order to uncover the origin of SCP-4128's anomalous properties and the motivation behind the entity's activities. The following are transcriptions of the video logs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log-4128-R03\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4128\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Robert Markstrom\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview was approved after recent psychological consultation and evaluation deemed SCP-4128 mentally sound. The interview was conducted within an observable chamber. The entity was restrained via handcuffs which were chained to a metal plate in the ground. Two armed guards kept watch outside the room, equipped with throwable canisters of nitrous oxide.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Hello, 4128. How are we feeling today?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n I'm sorry, could you say that one more time?\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n How are you today? Are you feeling any better?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Oh, yes. I'm doing okay, I suppose. It was a little jarring, having y'all knock me out with that damn gas. (\nPause\n) I'm- I'm not going to hurt anyone.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Security measures have to be taken. It's nothing personal. I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Do you understand?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Yes, I do.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Good. Let's get started. When and where were you born?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588, 1913. I lived on the outskirts of Glenville with my Ma and Pa. In Ohio, that is.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n 4128, can you tell me why we have no records of you or your family present at that time?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Well, Ma and Pa weren't exactly legal. They also never left the farm much.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Interesting. How did you obtain your anomalous properties?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Obtain? (\nChuckle\n) I suppose whenever I was conceived. My parents realized fast. They'd find things broken that shouldn't be. Ma nearly had a heart attack when she saw me pick up the recliner. (\nAnother chuckle, then silence.\n) She was always so patient. She'd broken more than one finger during that time.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Can you recall the first time you purposely used your abilities on a human being?\n\n\n(\nNo response is given.\n)\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n I understand why this topic may be difficult to discuss, but the more we uncover, the higher chance we have of finding a way to suppress your abnormal condition. Answer the question, please.\n\n\n(\nSilence for several more seconds before an audible sigh is given by SCP-4128.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n I was nineteen at the time. Whenever we needed new supplies for home, my parents would send me into town. Figured I could take care of myself, believe it or not. Ma needed me to pick up fabrics at a haberdashery, a place ran by a- oh, what's his name -Mitchell Siegel. He and one of his boys were working that night.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 can be seen looking away from Dr. Robert.\n)\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n I need you to keep going. What happened?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Three men came in. One fella stood perched by the door, real suspicious-like. I noticed one of them start stuffing some shirts into his coat. Everything tends to blur after that. I remember reaching for him when the lookout pulled out a roscoe\n5\n. The bullet hit and I fell. When I got up, they were gone, the son included. Then I saw the old man lying on the floor.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n The shoplifter shot him, too?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Heart attack, apparently. I found out the day after.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n I'm assuming you chased after these men?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Of course. I was\u2026 well, it'd be gracious to say I did it out of a \"sense of justice\". I was ticked. The kid took Pa's truck so I had to chase after them on foot. It was the first time I'd started using my get-away sticks to their potential. Couldn't stop myself correctly, but, hey, I still managed to catch them on the outskirts.\n\n\n(\nPause\n)\n\n\nI was so careless then.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Could you please elaborate?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n I didn't even think what would- I picked the car up and threw it. The haberdasher's son just parked the truck and watched.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Did you dispose of the witness?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Did I- God, \nno\n. After seeing\u2026 I don't think I'd ever thrown up that much. No, the rest of that night we just talked. It was the most damned thing, I tell ya. He asked questions. I gave \nsome\n answers. He asked me where I came from. Know what I told him? An alien planet! (\nChuckle\n) The gullible idiot nearly lost his mind.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n You let him free knowing he could identify you?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Well, he promised he wouldn't tell anyone; a sort of repayment for avenging his father, I suppose. (\nPause\n) You know what I've realized, doc? That night was a damn warning.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n We'll wrap it up for today. One more thing.\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Yes, doc?\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Did you ever get his name? We'll need to run a background check, just for cautionary measures.\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Jerry was his name.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n After SCP-4128 was taken back to its cell, a background search was performed on Jerry Siegel. Findings led to his designation as PoI-4128-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log-4128-R04\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4128\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Robert Markstrom\n\n\nForeword:\n Upon discovery of PoI-4128-A (\ndeceased\n) and the correlation between his works and SCP-4128, another round of questioning was approved. Conditions of the previous interview were kept.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and I'll need you to answer each with full, transparent honesty. Can you do that for me?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Course I can.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Okay, good. To start off, can you fly?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n What? Not that I'm aware of. I can jump pretty good, though.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Noted. Do you possess any form of \"X-ray\" or \"heat\" vision?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Oh. I see what this is all about.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 can be seen smiling.\n)\n\n\nI suppose y'all put it together, right?\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Well, considering we found several of Siegel's works in your apartment, I have to inquire about their validity. Are any of these stories true?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Hate to disappoint, but no. Pretty much all of it is made up or exaggerated. Embellished to look pretty, you know?\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n I figured as much. When did you realize that these graphic illustrations were about you?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n It was several years after the first one. Figured it was a funny coincidence, till I did my research. Found out that the writer was none other.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Did you confront him?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n No.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 pauses for a moment, seemingly trying to decide what to say.\n)\n\n\nTruth is, I loved it. I was engrossed.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Could you elaborate?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n You know what I majored in, doc? Accounting. That cubicle was slightly better than this place, but it wasn't \nmy\n place, you understand? The occupation didn't matter, the income didn't matter. None of it did, as long as I could do \nthis\n.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 can be seen flicking its wrist, breaking the restraints. The two guards posted charge in.\n)\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Back to your post! It's fine. He's not causing any harm. Apologies, please continue.\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n Why God gave me this, I couldn't understand. Was it luck? A curse? Then, these stories pop up. Maybe I was part of something greater, maybe there was a reason I could do what I do. The little grifter basically told me that I was a gift to the world.\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n You're saying his works inspired you to take up these vigilante activities?\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n I thought it was the best choice I ever made. Scary, at times. Finding your calling always is, I suppose. My first patrol ended with me getting hit by a truck, you believe that? After a time, I\u2026 I witnessed \nterrible\n things.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 begins to cover its eyes.\n)\n\n\nDr. Markstrom:\n Let's not get off topic. There are still more things I'd like to discu-\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 raises its voice slightly.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4128:\n I just wanted to bring hope, you know? I never meant to- (\nPause\n) You just start to lump 'em all together. The murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. You forget. You forget some of them are just goddamn people, and then you get mad and careless and- I'm supposed to be a hero, right?\n\n\n(\nSCP-4128 can be seen in visible emotional distress.\n)\n\n\nWhat kind of hero would do the things that I did?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Robert Markstrom requested continued psychological consultation for SCP-4128 along with prescribed antidepressants. Both requests were approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\u00a0Incident\u00a0Document-4128\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION EVENT-38\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, 2018\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Brooklyn, New York\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\nFoundation agents were alerted when SCP-4128 had reportedly turned itself in to local authorities. An investigation revealed that SCP-4128 had followed David \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n6\n to his apartment with the intent to apprehend him. Upon breaking into the apartment, Kyaus \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, David's fifteen-year-old son, proceeded to sneak up on the entity with a gun. SCP-4128 was reportedly startled and attacked the young man in the dark. An autopsy report showed that the chest wall was strongly crushed, and the side wall of his right ventricle was sandwiched between the costal cartilages and seventh thoracic vertebrae before it ruptured. Surgery revealed a large amount of coagulated blood in the pericardium.\n\n\nRESPONSE:\n Class-A amnestics were administered to all individuals involved. Embedded Foundation agents implemented a cover investigation which framed David \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as the murder suspect. David subsequently went to trial in the following month. SCP-4128 was recovered by MTF-Iota-10 without incident.\n\n\n\n\nCONFISCATED EVIDENCE:\n\n\nTranscript of Initial Interrogation.

Dr. Markstrom: 4128, can you tell me why we have no records of you or your family present at that time? SCP-4128: Well, Ma and Pa weren't exactly legal. They also never left the farm much. Dr. Markstrom: Interesting. How did you obtain your anomalous properties? SCP-4128: Obtain? ( Chuckle ) I suppose whenever I was conceived. My parents realized fast. They'd find things broken that shouldn't be. Ma nearly had a heart attack when she saw me pick up the recliner. ( Another chuckle, then silence. ) She was always so patient. She'd broken more than one finger during that time. Dr. Markstrom: Can you recall the first time you purposely used your abilities on a human being? ( No response is given. ) Dr. Markstrom: I understand why this topic may be difficult to discuss, but the more we uncover, the higher chance we have of finding a way to suppress your abnormal condition. Answer the question, please. ( Silence for several more seconds before an audible sigh is given by SCP-4128. ) SCP-4128: I was nineteen at the time. Whenever we needed new supplies for home, my parents would send me into town. Figured I could take care of myself, believe it or not. Ma needed me to pick up fabrics at a haberdashery, a place ran by a- oh, what's his name -Mitchell Siegel. He and one of his boys were working that night. ( SCP-4128 can be seen looking away from Dr. Robert. ) Dr. Markstrom: I need you to keep going. What happened? SCP-4128: Three men came in. One fella stood perched by the door, real suspicious-like. I noticed one of them start stuffing some shirts into his coat. Everything tends to blur after that. I remember reaching for him when the lookout pulled out a roscoe 5 . The bullet hit and I fell. When I got up, they were gone, the son included. Then I saw the old man lying on the floor. Dr. Markstrom: The shoplifter shot him, too? SCP-4128: Heart attack, apparently. I found out the day after. Dr. Markstrom: I'm assuming you chased after these men? SCP-4128: Of course. I was\u2026 well, it'd be gracious to say I did it out of a \"sense of justice\". I was ticked. The kid took Pa's truck so I had to chase after them on foot. It was the first time I'd started using my get-away sticks to their potential. Couldn't stop myself correctly, but, hey, I still managed to catch them on the outskirts. ( Pause ) I was so careless then. Dr. Markstrom: Could you please elaborate? SCP-4128: I didn't even think what would- I picked the car up and threw it. The haberdasher's son just parked the truck and watched. Dr. Markstrom: Did you dispose of the witness? SCP-4128: Did I- God, no . After seeing\u2026 I don't think I'd ever thrown up that much. No, the rest of that night we just talked. It was the most damned thing, I tell ya. He asked questions. I gave some answers. He asked me where I came from. Know what I told him? An alien planet! ( Chuckle ) The gullible idiot nearly lost his mind. Dr. Markstrom: You let him free knowing he could identify you? SCP-4128: Well, he promised he wouldn't tell anyone; a sort of repayment for avenging his father, I suppose. ( Pause ) You know what I've realized, doc? That night was a damn warning. Dr. Markstrom: We'll wrap it up for today. One more thing. SCP-4128: Yes, doc? Dr. Markstrom: Did you ever get his name? We'll need to run a background check, just for cautionary measures. SCP-4128: Jerry was his name. <End Log> Closing Statement: After SCP-4128 was taken back to its cell, a background search was performed on Jerry Siegel. Findings led to his designation as PoI-4128-A.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-4128 Interviewer: Dr. Robert Markstrom Foreword: Upon discovery of PoI-4128-A ( deceased ) and the correlation between his works and SCP-4128, another round of questioning was approved. Conditions of the previous interview were kept. <Begin Log> Dr. Markstrom: I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and I'll need you to answer each with full, transparent honesty. Can you do that for me? SCP-4128: Course I can. Dr. Markstrom: Okay, good. To start off, can you fly? SCP-4128: What? Not that I'm aware of. I can jump pretty good, though. Dr. Markstrom: Noted. Do you possess any form of \"X-ray\" or \"heat\" vision? SCP-4128: Oh. I see what this is all about. ( SCP-4128 can be seen smiling. ) I suppose y'all put it together, right? Dr. Markstrom: Well, considering we found several of Siegel's works in your apartment, I have to inquire about their validity. Are any of these stories true? SCP-4128: Hate to disappoint, but no. Pretty much all of it is made up or exaggerated. Embellished to look pretty, you know? Dr. Markstrom: I figured as much. When did you realize that these graphic illustrations were about you? SCP-4128: It was several years after the first one. Figured it was a funny coincidence, till I did my research. Found out that the writer was none other. Dr. Markstrom: Did you confront him? SCP-4128: No. ( SCP-4128 pauses for a moment, seemingly trying to decide what to say. ) Truth is, I loved it. I was engrossed. Dr. Markstrom: Could you elaborate? SCP-4128: You know what I majored in, doc? Accounting. That cubicle was slightly better than this place, but it wasn't my place, you understand? The occupation didn't matter, the income didn't matter. None of it did, as long as I could do this . ( SCP-4128 can be seen flicking its wrist, breaking the restraints. The two guards posted charge in. ) Dr. Markstrom: Back to your post! It's fine. He's not causing any harm. Apologies, please continue. SCP-4128: Why God gave me this, I couldn't understand. Was it luck? A curse? Then, these stories pop up. Maybe I was part of something greater, maybe there was a reason I could do what I do. The little grifter basically told me that I was a gift to the world. Dr. Markstrom: You're saying his works inspired you to take up these vigilante activities? SCP-4128: I thought it was the best choice I ever made. Scary, at times. Finding your calling always is, I suppose. My first patrol ended with me getting hit by a truck, you believe that? After a time, I\u2026 I witnessed terrible things. ( SCP-4128 begins to cover its eyes. ) Dr. Markstrom: Let's not get off topic. There are still more things I'd like to discu- ( SCP-4128 raises its voice slightly. ) SCP-4128: I just wanted to bring hope, you know? I never meant to- ( Pause ) You just start to lump 'em all together. The murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. You forget. You forget some of them are just goddamn people, and then you get mad and careless and- I'm supposed to be a hero, right? ( SCP-4128 can be seen in visible emotional distress. ) What kind of hero would do the things that I did? <End Log> Closing Statement: Dr. Robert Markstrom requested continued psychological consultation for SCP-4128 along with prescribed antidepressants. Both requests were approved.",
        "Interrogated: SCP-4128 Interrogator: Lt. Jeremy \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Foreword: Upon SCP-4128 calling the authorities, dispatch transported the subject to Brooklyn's \u2588\u2588 Precinct. Lt. Jeremy \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 conducted the following interrogation. <Begin Log> Lt. Jeremy: Look, we found no weapons on you. Nothing at the crime scene either, except for the gun the kid had. As far as I understand, no bullet wounds have been found either. So how the hell did you cave that kid's guts in? ( No response is given. ) God damn it! What the hell did you do to that kid? ( SCP-4128 is heard mumbling unintelligibly. ) What? Speak up for Christ's sake. SCP-4128: ( Low ) I punched him. Lt. Jeremy: You punched him? Jesus, you didn't know when to stop? SCP-4128: Just once. Lt. Jeremy: Really? Tell me how the fuck could one punch do that? SCP-4128: I-I didn't watch myself. ( SCP-4128 begins sobbing uncontrollably, talking between catches of breath. ) Dear God, I just watched him h-hold his kid. God, forgive me. I couldn't save him. I couldn't- ( SCP-4128 strikes both fists onto the table. Dents are visible on the feed. ) I'm a hero. I'm- I can't save them. <End Log> Closing Statement: Lt. Jeremy \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was administered a Class-A amnestic. The security footage was copied and the original expunged. After this, a raid on SCP-4128's local residential address was conducted."
