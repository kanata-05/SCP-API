Site-26 has been disguised as a weather observatory and agents within the Greek government are to ensure that the site is publicly viewed as such.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2095 is a primarily subterranean temple complex\n1\n located at Gyaros, an arid and uninhabited Greek island in the Aegean Sea. Structure predates previously known archaeological sites on the island. Inscriptions found within have included Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A, Hittite Cuneiform, and a previously unknown writing system composed of spiral-shaped glyphs varying in complexity.\n2\n\n\nSCP-2095 is composed of entirely biological material and is believed to have once been a living organism. Samples taken from SCP-2095 have revealed bone, chitin, muscle, adipose and viscera. Radiocarbon dating has placed the subject's death at cal 1200\u20131000 BCE (1\u03c3) with soft tissue having undergone a form of embalmment.\n\n\nChambers are connected together via tunnels which are structurally and cellularly similar to the inner lining of the human intestinal tract. Large sphincters appear to have served as doors and are permanently relaxed. These portals would have likely been able to open and close as needed pre-mortem.\n\n\nThe largest room contains an altar composed of bone, a component of the SCP-2095 organism. Forensic evidence suggests that it was used in a sacrificial manner. It is believed possible that living sacrifices provided SCP-2095 with the nutrients necessary for its survival and the floor itself shows signs of acidic corrosion. The base of the altar has been carved into an Ouroboros, believed to be a symbol of religious importance to the creators of SCP-2095.\n\n\nTwenty-nine scrolls were discovered within the northern most chamber of SCP-2095. Only four were found to be written in Hittite Cuneiform while the rest remain undecipherable. Of those four, three are considered to be of a spiritual/philosophical nature while one appears to be an inventory report.\n\n\nFoundation archaeologists have found evidence of warfare throughout the island. This has included skeletal remains depicting likely anomalous causes for death such as implosion, internal combustion, disintegration, radiation poisoning, and fatal physical reconfiguration.\n\n\nThe Foundation became aware of SCP-2095 after reports of a \"cathedral of bone\" being discovered by a team of Greek archaeologists who had been studying a large mound on the isle of Gyaros. Class-B Amnestics were administered and the archaeologists were returned to the general population. SCP-2095 was easily secured and construction of Reliquary Site-26 was completed by 12/09/1949.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0INVENTORY\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources:\n\n\n[illegible]\n\n\n1340 slaves - 10 surrendered at the Shrine of Consumption when the Black Moon holds dominion over the Heavens\n\n\n\n12 biltu of gold, pure\n3\n\n\n1200 goats\n\n\n300 pigs\n\n\n[fragment missing]\n\n\nOur Sacred Legion\n:\n\n\n3000 Adytite faithful\n\n\n\n500 Thracian faithful, including 12 [\"storm-beasts\"?]\n\n\n2000 Urartu [\"converts\"/\"conscripts\"?]\n\n\n400 Sardinian mercenaries\n\n\n250 Kaskian faithful\n\n\n100 Caphtor conspirators - can their loyalty be trusted when they so easily betrayed their own?\n4\n\n\n300 Mycenaean mercenaries\n\n\nArmory:\n\n\n2550 bone-crafted blades and shields\n\n\n2000 bone-crafted bows\n\n\n10,000 bone-crafted arrows, poisoned with hellebore and venom of adder\n\n\n60 amphora of [illegible]\n\n\n200 amphora of \"liquid fire\"\n\n\n20 \"curse tablets\" - placed around perimeter of island\n\n\n1 amphora of \"Red Death\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCROLL\u00a0I\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wound, cut from the flesh of totality - deep, it severed the line of future and past.
