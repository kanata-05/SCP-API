MTF-Gamma-81 (\"Pinniped Pirates\") is to play the part of a scientific research crew, aboard the \nSCPF Pickup Line\n icebreaker vessel, with a direct wired video link to the \nHermit-1\n remote submersible.\n\n\nIf SCP-3828 approaches a civilised port or harbour, it is to be gently redirected using reinforced nets to the nearest uninhabited beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range that SCP-3828 usually occupies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3828 is a young male Weddell seal (Latin name \nLeptonychotes weddellii\n) currently located in the Arctic sea, specifically in the Fram sea, Lincoln strait, Barents sea, and Greenland sea. The anomalous properties of SCP-3828 continuously manifest in a region within its visual range on any solid object. SCP-3828 is vulnerable to physical harm, but does not appear to age. The social nature and location of SCP-3828 are anomalous; Most Weddell seals are solitary most of the time, and live in the Antarctic, not the Arctic. It is unknown how SCP-3828 got to its current location.\n\n\nAn object sighted by SCP-3828 will then be seized by an as-of-yet unbreakable force and held in place; if it is more than the size of an adult Weddell seal (roughly 3.5m\n3\n), a mass of that size will be separated from the main mass and then be acted upon by SCP-3828 without further affecting the leftover material (excluding additional iterations of this process). If there is less than approximately 1m\n3\n of material, but there is a similar material nearby, that material will be included in the process. This material is given the designation SCP-3828-1, with existing instances given the designation SCP-3828-1-A through -Z.\n\n\nDuring this process SCP-3828 appears externally to enter an underwater-sleep state which is usual for seals\n1\n, but both hemispheres remain active, with one becoming electrically super-active in a way that typically only occurs during a \ngrand mal\n attack. This does not harm SCP-3828.\n\n\nInstead, SCP-3828-1 will be physically changed into the shape of a Weddell seal. SCP-3828-1 will then behave as a regular seal would, appearing to hunt and consume fish. This occurs regardless of the material SCP-3828-1 is comprised of, and the material available does not appear to affect the buoyancy or absorbency of SCP-3828-1. SCP-3828-1 instances are usually safe, as they behave as normal seals, despite the fact many instances are biohazardous or much more resilient than a natural seal due to their composition.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Instances\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3828-1.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Instances\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3828-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nMaterial\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3828-1-A\n\n\nA variety of Arctic fish, of differing species' and states of decay.\n\n\nCeased to animate in incident S1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3828-1-B\n\n\nFishhooks and metal shards.\n\n\nPreviously thought to be the most dangerous possible iteration of SCP-3828-1.

The staff on the boat reported the encounter to a local newspaper, which alerted a nearby Foundation cell. The following is a log of events on the day.\n\n\n\n\n0400:\n SCP-3828 is located by a Foundation boat sent for that purpose heading towards the Arctic circle.\n\n\n0415:\n A Foundation crew contains SCP-3828 and all accompanying instances of SCP-3828-1 (A-J) using a reinforced net; The instances that would be capable of slipping through the net do not, possibly to remain with SCP-3828.\n\n\n0417:\n SCP-3828 is brought aboard the boat and placed in a holding tank specifically made for the purpose. The SCP-3828-1 instances are also taken aboard, and stored in similar tanks. Once outside of visual range of SCP-3828, the SCP-3828-1 instances become inanimate and inert, resuming their usual properties based on the materials they were comprised of.\n\n\n0419:\n Samples are collected of every instance of SCP-3828-1 and SCP-3828 itself\n3\n. A tracker is implanted in SCP-3828\n\n\n0450:\n SCP-3828 and the remains of all accompanying SCP-3828-1 instances are taken into Site-256 and placed in standardised steel / perspex aquatic containment rooms. At this point, SCP-3828 has become highly agitated, however, has not manifested any unusual effects, and is assumed to be a regular non-anomalous seal, with the SCP-3828-1 entities being the anomalous articles.\n\n\n0512:\n On-site animal behavioural scientist Dr. Carver notes that SCP-3828 shows signs of extreme distress, typical in younger specimens kept without companions or isolated from their group. Conclusion dismissed as insignificant; Dr. Carver was on break at that point, and under review for attempting to access containment procedures in self-admitted leisure time. SCP-3828 thought to be non-anomalous at this time.\n\n\n0602:\n Results come back from chemical analysis labs and it is discovered that SCP-3828-1 instances and SCP-3828 are physically non-anomalous. Study shifts to SCP-3828. Testing permissions applied for, but left pending due to low-priority rating.\n\n\n0635:\n SCP-3828 enters a pseudo-sleep state. Brain activity is not monitored during this time. Over the course of the next minute, the perspex walls of the containment tank and the steel walls of the chamber itself are seen to buckle and shift into SCP-3828-1 instances. The holes torn in the walls of the chamber cause a Stage 1 lockdown to occur, sealing all sections of Site-256.\n\n\n0700:\n Camera footage shows SCP-3828 moving across the floor of a corridor outside of its section, tailed by SCP-3828-1-K and -L. Later, a hole was discovered in the lockdown door of that section of Site-256, explaining how SCP-3828 is seen here. The amount of material taken from the door is roughly 2.5m\n3\n implying that SCP-3828-K is primarily composed of this door.\n\n\n0703:\n SCP-3828 is shown in increasing amounts of distress, returning to its now-drained tank and vocalising frequently. Analysis shows SCP-3828 was dehydrated.\n\n\n0715:\n SCP-3828 is seen leaving the facility on external CCTV, followed by SCP-3828-K and SCP-3828-L, as well as SCP-3828-K2. SCP-3828-K2 is later found to be restrained by a Foundation perimeter fence.\n\n\n0800:\n Lockdown disengaged. No casualties or further breaches. Staff commended for proper use of protocol, excluding those who dismissed the likelihood of SCP-3828 being anomalous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0S2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0S2\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1994, a new experimental SCP restraint system was under testing at Site-256, and SCP-3828 deemed an ideal candidate for the final stages of testing, based on the mistaken assumption that SCP-3828 had to be touching the material that they created SCP-3828-1 instances out of. The experimental restraint system relied on electromagnets powerful enough to influence diamagnetism in the subject, meaning potentially any object made out of atoms could be contained.\n\n\nSCP-3828 was captured easily, with only SCP-3828-1-L and -K in tow. The reasoning for the relative lack of company is unknown; it is hypothesised that formation of new SCP-3828-1 entities takes significant effort on the part of SCP-3828 and is not easily repeated.\n\n\nSCP-3828 was taken back to Site-256, in a larger tank accompanied by SCP-3828-1-L and -K. This was thought to decrease the chances of a breach, by keeping SCP-3828 relatively satisfied, since it is believed that SCP-3828 primarily requires the company of its derivative entities to stay placated.\n\n\nOnce in the holding tank, 6 Maximum Strength Suspension Electromagnets were activated facing inwards from all directions, causing SCP-3828 to be restrained from touching the walls of its containment tank, with a relative freedom of movement. However, SCP-3828-1-K rapidly experienced an unforseen ferromagnetic force due to its alloyed composition\n4\n, and was pulled towards the wall of the tank, causing that wall section to crack, bend, and leak water. Lockdown was automatically initiated in that section of Site-256 due to a detected breach, causing the magnets to switch to backup power, creating a slight surge in force and fully destroying the wall of the tank.\n\n\nFollowing this, security logs show SCP-3828 entering the sleep state necessary for formation of new instances of SCP-3828-1 and the magnets in the walls of the tank coming together, until 3 each make up SCP-3828-1-M and -M2. The electromagnets appeared to remain powered, and created an effect around SCP-3828, SCP-3828-1-K, -L, -M, and -M2 that caused all obstacles to be pushed out of the way of their egress.\n\n\nWhen the group encountered water, a short circuit occurred in -M and -M2 causing complete loss of power to the magnets. However, reactivation events have been logged since, often causing distress to both instances and the remaining SCP-3828-K instance, as well as disrupting observation equipment.\n\n\nThere were no casualties or further breaches. The responsible staff on-site were reprimanded and demoted for poor foresight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting:\n\n\nAs SCP-3828 is currently physically uncontained, testing is difficult. Also, SCP-3828 is not invulnerable or even resistant to damage moreso than a regular seal. Testing with \nSCP-3213\n is pending due to logistical concerns.\n\n\nAddendum 1.1:\n SCP-3828-1-K2 has been extensively studied to the point of being fully deemed non-anomalous. As a result, permission has been granted to display K2 in the mess hall of Site-256. Employee feedback is strongly positive.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
