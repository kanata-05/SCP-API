Testing of SCP-5171 is currently suspended.\n\n\nLocating PoI-9414 has been assigned as a priority mission for MTF Alpha-7 (\"Surpassing Tindalos\").\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5171 is an artificial intelligence built by PoI-9414, formerly O5-9, as an administrative assistance and memetic screening system. SCP-5171 operated on a 3rd-gen photonics processing platform allocated for all Level 5 personnel at the time, with heavily modified interfaces. While these technologies are ahead of mundane equivalents, no part of SCP-5171 was inherently anomalous at the time of its creation.\n\n\nOriginally designated Rhyme.aic, SCP-5171 had developed total self-awareness after PoI-9414 intentionally exposed it to a multitude of anomalous memetic agents, collectively designated SCP-5171-A. It is currently unknown how PoI-9414 acquired the skills necessary to create and utilize anomalous memetic agents in this way. While the Foundation retains a full copy of SCP-5171-A, the technical and ethical risk posed prohibits further experimentation.\n\n\nAccording to the log recovered after PoI-9414 defected from the Foundation (see Addendum 5171.A), SCP-5171 believed that it was a human female named \"Rima\", and that it had grown up with PoI-9414 since their childhood. Due to the mandatory data expungement procedure applied to the personal data of O5 members, this information cannot be confirmed.\n\n\nAddendum 5171.A:\n Log recovered from SCP-5171 interface cache, temporal metadata irretrievable. The format indicates a speech-recognition interface log.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n Hello Rima, how are you today?\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Hi, Galuh. I was wondering when you'll show up.\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n I'm so sorry, the meeting got late, I kept getting in arguments with those pesky fossils.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n No, don't be. I shouldn't have talked to you like that, I know you're very busy, and it's for both of us. It's just that sitting here all day with nothing to do\u2026it got me all grumpy, you know?\n1\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n I know. I'm sorry, I wish I could've brought you outside.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Like I said, don't be sorry. None of this is your fault, I'm thankful that you had time to spend with me at all.\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n But I could've done more, if only I stopped trying to fight my way through every little thing.\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n If only I listened to your parents back then.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n We're not having this conversation, Galuh.\n\n\n(Strings of periodic data pattern follows, with no known meaning. Presumed to be environmental noise falsely parsed as speeches by the interface.)\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Do you remember when we watched meteor showers on the beach?\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n That was so long ago, I'm surprised that you still remember it.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n There's no way I would forget. We spent a full roll of your dad's camera film. All those photographs, I could recall every single one of them as if it's yesterday.\n2\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n I was so sure he'd be so angry at me. Those rolls were expensive. Instead, he started teaching me how to properly photograph a shooting star.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n I tried to convince you that he won't be angry at us for using a camera \nto take pictures.\n But you're just so convinced he would.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Oh wow, he's not angry that you used something for its intended purpose, how surprising.\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n When do you think was the last time I started a conversation \nwithout\n fighting intent?\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Other than with me? I'd wager a decade at least.\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n \u2026okay I'm not \nthat\n controversial. I could hold a somewhat proper and neutral conversation with my subordinates.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n I wouldn't know, I never had any reason to meet them.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Not that I want to, mind you. But it just feels so bizarre thinking about you having just normal conversations about accounting or something.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Hell, I can't even imagine \nthe\n Galuh arguing academically against a Board of Directors!\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n Yeah, I guess I changed quite a bit since way back then.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Me, on the other hand\u2026\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n Sorry.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Sorry sorry sorry. Half your words are apology, over and over again. I didn't wake up just to hear you say sorry for days on end!\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n I\u2026\n\n\n(brief periodic data/silence, gaps in noise pattern indicate removed data)\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n Did you meet the doctors today?\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n Nope, there's no test for today. I wonder if that means I'm getting better or getting worse.\n3\n\n\nPoI-9414:\n Don't worry, we'll be out of this place in no time.\n\n\nSCP-5171:\n I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Of note, SCP-5171 had never ceased functioning as administrative assistance and memetic screening system, up until its deactivation upon PoI-9414's defection.\n\n\n2\n. A large portion of SCP-5171-A incorporate photographs, often collages arranged in certain patterns. It is theorized that these photographs affected the memory retained by SCP-5171.\n\n\n3\n.
