All personnel are to have at least C1 certifications in Russian. Radio equipment is to receive weekly diagnostic checks to ensure all devices are in working condition. Personnel are rotated off-site on a monthly basis.\n\n\nIf, at any time, an occurrence of SCP-3034 is detected, personnel are to immediately respond on the same frequency with a message in Russian: \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e (\"All is well\"). In any instance where communication is lost with the site, MTF Epsilon-10 (\"Santa's Little Helpers\") will be mobilized to investigate and secure the area.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances is on-site radio equipment to be used for any other purpose besides transmitting the phrase, \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\" (\"All is well\"). Under no circumstances should an attempt be made to communicate with SCP-3034 (see attached incident report).\n\n\nUnder no circumstances are children permitted on-site.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3034 is a reoccurring anomalous radio broadcast of unknown origin. As of this date, the transmission has only been observed within approximately 2 kilometers of Provisional Site-3034. All attempts to triangulate the source of SCP-3034 have failed. Since 1964, there have been over 627 occurrences of this broadcast. They occur at apparently random intervals \u2014 the shortest gap being two weeks, and the longest, 6 months.\n\n\nAll occurrences of SCP-3034 follow the same format: A synthesized musical 'tone' plays for approximately 10 seconds, followed by the voice of SCP-3034-A (estimated to be a female adolescent of Russian nationality). SCP-3034-A immediately begins to count backwards from 200 in Russian (UPDATE 2015/05/17: See attached incident report). If, during this countdown, Provisional Site-3034 broadcasts \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\" on the same frequency, SCP-3034-A immediately stops counting. The same tone from the beginning of the broadcast plays again, and the broadcast ends.\n\n\nA notable \naudio distortion\n occurs in the background of SCP-3034 as SCP-3034-A speaks:\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to analyze this distortion are ongoing (see attached audio analysis below).\n\n\nTesting has shown that SCP-3034 does not respond to recorded occurrences of \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\". It is for this reason that personnel must be present at Provisional Site-3034 at all times.\n\n\nAddendum 3034.1:\n Attachments\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3034/discovery/debriefing.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOVERY REPORT\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 1964/02/02\n\n\nRECOVERY LEAD:\n Commander Robert Malthus\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-3034\n\n\n\n\nWe were first made aware of the site by a defecting agent of GRU-P.\n1\n Although allegedly a Russian-aligned counting station,\n2\n preliminary reports indicated a high probability of anomalous activity.\n\n\n\nI assembled a team consisting of myself, five of my men, and \nAgent Browning\n (selected for his proficiency in several Russian dialects).

Agent Browning informed us that this woman was counting downward, and had reached '76'.\n\n\nAfter a short debate, it was decided that the most prudent course of action would be to follow the instructions on the desk. Dr. Browning interrupted the broadcast with the provided phrase (\"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\", or \"ALL IS WELL\"). The voice stopped.

During that time, we've recorded every instance of SCP-3034 since its discovery (except the very first one; attached you'll find a mission report regarding details of this occurrence). That's over 600 recordings.\n\n\nWe've explored every avenue of inquiry I can think of. We can't track the signal, and upper management \u2014 quite reasonably \u2014 doesn't want us trying to talk to it. That's why I'm contacting you.\n\n\nI'm hoping with in-depth vocal analysis, you'll be able to tell us more about the voice on this recording. Cross-reference it with recordings of other number stations, maybe. Or give us a geographical location based on dialect and accent \u2014 an estimated age. Something, \nanything\n.\n\n\nOtherwise, I'm out of ideas. All I know is that someone's broadcasting recordings of a little girl counting down to zero \u2014 and we're all too scared to find out what happens if we let her finish.\n\n\nI'm starting to wonder if this isn't some sort of \nelaborate prank\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2012/09/15\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Emerson <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|nosremer#noitadnuof.pcs|nosremer\n>\n\n\nTO:\n Dr. Schulkill <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb#noitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb\n>\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n RE: Audio Analysis of SCP-3034\n\n\n\n\nThe broadcasts aren't recordings.\n\n\nVariations in tone, pitch, and phrasing make it clear that each instance of SCP-3034 is a new occurrence; each count-down is vocally unique. Either someone recorded this little girl counting down over and over again, hundreds of times\u2026 or she's been broadcasting these signals for over 50 years.\n\n\n\nThere's more: We've analyzed the audio distortion in the background. It appears to be more voices, only slowed down. Just like SCP-3034-A, these are vocally unique for each occurrence. Regrettably, the distortion is far too weak for us to make out what they're saying. However, the length of the broadcast seems to correlate with the strength of the distortion \u2014 the longer the broadcast goes on, the louder the distortion becomes.\n\n\nIronically, the problem is that we're \ntoo\n good at containment: Foundation personnel mobilize so quickly that no transmission we've recorded has lasted longer than 30 seconds. If we had longer transmissions, we might be able to extrapolate more data.\n\n\nMy recommendation is that you allow the signal to go on for longer than 30 seconds. Maybe then we'll be able to determine precisely what it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2012/09/16\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Schulkill <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb#noitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb\n>\n\n\nTO:\n Dr. Emerson <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|nosremer#noitadnuof.pcs|nosremer\n>\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n RE: RE: Audio Analysis of SCP-3034\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation approved. Foundation personnel have been instructed to allow the next five iterations of SCP-3034 to continue until it reaches '50'. Hopefully, this will provide enough useful data for us to analyze the distortion and figure out what the hell is going on.\n\n\nI'll send you the files once we have them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2013/01/19\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Emerson <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|nosremer#noitadnuof.pcs|nosremer\n>\n\n\nTO:\n Dr. Schulkill <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb#noitadnuof.pcs|llikluhcsb\n>\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-3034\n\n\n\n\nI finished analyzing three of the five files you sent.\n\n\nIt's just screaming.

During an occurrence of SCP-3034, she attempted to establish communication with SCP-3034-A.\n\n\nSCP-3034-A ceased counting. Approximately 5 seconds later, an extremely powerful broadcast was detected. This signal consisted of a high-pitched 'screech' which inflicted significant levels of pain, dizziness, and disorientation to all personnel present. The signal continued for a period of 25 seconds, at which point Dr. Willis used Provisional Site-3034's radio equipment to transmit the appropriate phrase (\"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\"). The broadcast immediately ceased.\n\n\nWithin the next 24 hours, researchers noted a significant increase in missing children cases across the world. In the majority of these cases, the disappearances occurred at a time roughly correlating with the 25-second broadcast. All cases believed to be associated with SCP-3034 have remained unsolved.\n\n\n\nDisciplinary action against Dr. Willis is still under review. Special containment procedures have been updated to reflect the importance of not interacting with SCP-3034-A outside of stated parameters.\n\n\n\nAll tests regarding SCP-3034 are suspended until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3034/incidents/202.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT REPORT\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT #:\n 3034-202\n\n\nDATE OF OCCURRENCE:\n 2015/06/04\n\n\n\n\nAn occurrence of SCP-3034 was detected.

VOICE 2: A sacrifice that will save millions, if not billions\u2014 VOICE 1: Presuming the Americans even believe this 'fable' exists. Presuming they think us monstrous enough to use it. VOICE 2: They will. We will show them. A small taste. Just as they demonstrated their power at Hiroshima, we will \u2014 [ Scuffling, followed by shouting. ] VOICE 2: I trust you will control yourself, now? VOICE 1: ( panicked ) You cannot do this. The nightmares. I know you have had them, just as I have. The voices, screaming in the dark. That's what it wants, Vaslov. That's what it is . You cannot make a deal with this thing \u2014 we have finally contained it, and now you want to offer it \u2014 VOICE 2: Only if they force our hand.

During that time, we've recorded every instance of SCP-3034 since its discovery (except the very first one; attached you'll find a mission report regarding details of this occurrence). That's over 600 recordings. We've explored every avenue of inquiry I can think of. We can't track the signal, and upper management \u2014 quite reasonably \u2014 doesn't want us trying to talk to it. That's why I'm contacting you. I'm hoping with in-depth vocal analysis, you'll be able to tell us more about the voice on this recording. Cross-reference it with recordings of other number stations, maybe. Or give us a geographical location based on dialect and accent \u2014 an estimated age. Something, anything . Otherwise, I'm out of ideas. All I know is that someone's broadcasting recordings of a little girl counting down to zero \u2014 and we're all too scared to find out what happens if we let her finish. I'm starting to wonder if this isn't some sort of elaborate prank .",

Variations in tone, pitch, and phrasing make it clear that each instance of SCP-3034 is a new occurrence; each count-down is vocally unique. Either someone recorded this little girl counting down over and over again, hundreds of times\u2026 or she's been broadcasting these signals for over 50 years. There's more: We've analyzed the audio distortion in the background. It appears to be more voices, only slowed down. Just like SCP-3034-A, these are vocally unique for each occurrence. Regrettably, the distortion is far too weak for us to make out what they're saying. However, the length of the broadcast seems to correlate with the strength of the distortion \u2014 the longer the broadcast goes on, the louder the distortion becomes. Ironically, the problem is that we're too good at containment: Foundation personnel mobilize so quickly that no transmission we've recorded has lasted longer than 30 seconds. If we had longer transmissions, we might be able to extrapolate more data. My recommendation is that you allow the signal to go on for longer than 30 seconds. Maybe then we'll be able to determine precisely what it is.",

Foundation personnel have been instructed to allow the next five iterations of SCP-3034 to continue until it reaches '50'.

        "INCIDENT REPORT INCIDENT #: 3034-201 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 2015/05/17 A Foundation researcher assigned to SCP-3034 (Dr. Uriel Willis) misappropriated radio equipment to conduct an unofficial experiment. During an occurrence of SCP-3034, she attempted to establish communication with SCP-3034-A. SCP-3034-A ceased counting. Approximately 5 seconds later, an extremely powerful broadcast was detected. This signal consisted of a high-pitched 'screech' which inflicted significant levels of pain, dizziness, and disorientation to all personnel present. The signal continued for a period of 25 seconds, at which point Dr. Willis used Provisional Site-3034's radio equipment to transmit the appropriate phrase (\"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\"). The broadcast immediately ceased. Within the next 24 hours, researchers noted a significant increase in missing children cases across the world. In the majority of these cases, the disappearances occurred at a time roughly correlating with the 25-second broadcast. All cases believed to be associated with SCP-3034 have remained unsolved. Disciplinary action against Dr. Willis is still under review. Special containment procedures have been updated to reflect the importance of not interacting with SCP-3034-A outside of stated parameters. All tests regarding SCP-3034 are suspended until further notice.",
        "INCIDENT REPORT INCIDENT #: 3034-202 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 2015/06/04 An occurrence of SCP-3034 was detected. Personnel present responded with the appropriate transmission, leading to a cessation of SCP-3034. However, two distinct changes were noted: SCP-3034's audio distortion was significantly louder. SCP-3034-A began at 199.",
