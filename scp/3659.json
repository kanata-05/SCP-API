SCP-3659-A instances are kept in a specialized dinosaur habitat with adequate vegetation and an electric fence, and are to be monitored by members of \nMTF Phi-2 (\"Clever Girls\")\n.\n\n\nReports of ceratopsian dinosaurs are to be investigated, and MTF Phi-2 deployed to capture any SCP-3659-A or SCP-3659-B instances present.\n\n\nSCP-3659-B instances are kept in individual, reinforced dinosaur enclosures, and supplied with a live pig once every two days.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3659 instances are rubber hand puppets in the shape of a \nTriceratops\n head.\n\n\nWhen a subject wears SCP-3659, it will adhere to the subject's hand. When attached, SCP-3659 is sentient and behaves as such. The subject can 'feed' SCP-3659 plants by opening and closing their hand to make SCP-3659's mouth open and close.\n\n\nNo compulsive or memetic effects have been identified. If test subjects decline to feed or play with SCP-3659 for several days, SCP-3659 will become inert and detach from the subject's hand until worn by someone new.\n\n\nIf SCP-3659 is continually fed, it will gradually expand to cover more of the subject's body. Additional rubber, dinosaur-shaped accessories will manifest near the subject while they sleep: these include gloves and boots shaped like \nTriceratops\n feet, a wearable rubber tail, and a poncho with a reptilian skin pattern.\n\n\nAfter 2-3 days, SCP-3659 and any added accessories worn at the time will stretch until they envelop the subject's entire body. At this point, SCP-3659's rubber components will fuse at their junctions and form the shape of a juvenile \nTriceratops\n, and peel itself off of the subject. In 2-4 hours, SCP-3659's rubber will transmute into reptilian flesh and SCP-3659 will become a visually nonanomalous \nTriceratops\n, designated SCP-3659-A. SCP-3659-A will then proceed to lay a clutch of eggs, each one hatching to reveal a new instance of SCP-3659.\n\n\nAddendum:\n D-61195 was instructed to feed his SCP-3659 instance meat in place of plants. SCP-3659 stretched to envelop him after only 12 hours of adhesion, and did not eject D-61195 upon taking form. The resulting dinosaur, designated SCP-3659-B, resembled a stocky, quadrupedal tyrannosaur with a \nTriceratops\n frill and horns. Testing revealed the non-ceratopsian features (jaws, teeth, hip bones, and claws) to be a genetic match for D-61195.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3658\n | SCP-3659 | \nSCP-3660\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3659\n\" by Weryllium, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
