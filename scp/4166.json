SCP-4166-1 has previously requested:\n\n\n\n\nFive meals daily (Denied 07-26-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree meals daily (Granted 07-26-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pistol (Denied 07-26-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA taser (Granted 07-27-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCigarettes and marijuana cigarettes (Denied 07-30-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA butane lighter (Denied 07-30-2008, 08-02-2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious books, magazines, and video games (granted 07-31-2008, pending review and approval of contents).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA copy of the Holy Bible (Douay-Rheims, Challoner Revision) (Granted 08-01-2008, Removed by request 08-02-2008, Granted again 08-04-2008.).\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4166-2 manifestations are to be terminated upon sight, followed by administration of Class-A\u03db amnestic/sedative to SCP-4166-1.\n\n\nSCP-4166-1 is to be provided 1 cc of human semen weekly, administered via capsule with food; SCP-4166-1 is allowed to deny administration once per month if refusal would not cause irrevocable harm. Arrangements have been made with a local sperm bank for these purposes. Psychological evaluations of SCP-4166-1 are to be undertaken once a week to monitor the efficacy of psychiatric treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of symptoms of SCP-4166-3 stage two, recovered from SCP-4166-1's notebook. Text appears to be St Matthew 6:9-12, better known as the Lord's prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4166-1 is a female human class-C reality bender responsible for the creation of SCP-4166-2 and SCP-4166-3. It displays numerous psychological ailments, including aversion to men, fear of sleeping, PTSD, and suicidality.\n\n\nMedical analysis has discovered significant scarring on the palms, feet, and genital area. Additionally, SCP-4166-1 develops cachexia if not administered 1 cc of human semen weekly.\n\n\nEvery seven days, or in times of increased distress, SCP-4166-1 manifests an instance of SCP-4166-2 (if one does not currently exist).\n\n\nSCP-4166-2 is a mute shadow-like humanoid figure with no defining visual features which otherwise exhibits typical human characteristics. Upon manifestation, SCP-4166-2 enters the room containing SCP-4166-1 through the primary method of entry, regardless of barriers. It then attempts to approach SCP-4166-1.\n\n\nIf SCP-4166-1 retains the memory of containment of SCP-4166-2, SCP-4166-2 proceeds to take action to counteract previous methods of containment, up to and including manifesting with weaponry.\n\n\nUpon termination, SCP-4166-2 instances demanifest instantaneously.\n\n\nSCP-4166-3 is a three-phase mental illness affecting individuals who have observed an instance of SCP-4166-2, lasting for the duration of SCP-4166-2's manifestation.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Description\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-4166-3\u00a0stages\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Description\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-4166-3\u00a0stages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of symptoms of SCP-4166-3 stage three, recovered from SCP-4166-1's notebook. Text appears to be Psalms 138:1-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage one of SCP-4166-3 typically lasts two months before progressing to stage two. Symptoms include:\n\n\n\n\nIncreased irritability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscomfort with being alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsion to lock doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased startle response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing things in the periphery of vision\n\n\n\n\nStage two of SCP-4166-3 typically lasts one month before progressing to stage three. Accompanying those present during stage one, symptoms include:\n\n\n\n\nThe conviction that one was being immolated during major life events, such as birthdays or weddings (does not abate when provided with evidence otherwise).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual hallucinations of shadowy hands when viewing doorknobs, lasting approximately one second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAversion to religious ceremonies and masculine-presenting persons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep paralysis.\n\n\n\n\nStage three of SCP-4166-3 lasts until the termination of SCP-4166-2. Accompanying those present during prior stages, symptoms include:\n\n\n\n\nTactile hallucinations of hands grasping one's person, displaying no notable pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual hallucinations of SCP-4166-2 in empty doorways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurning sensations throughout one's whole body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConviction and fear of eternal suffering after death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a04166-A:\u00a0Circumstances\u00a0of\u00a0Retrieval\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a04166-A:\u00a0Circumstances\u00a0of\u00a0Retrieval\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4166-1 was raised in a Catholic orphanage twelve years prior to the hospitalization of Father \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in an apparent case of spontaneous combustion. Six days afterwards, the first manifestation of SCP-4166-2 occurred on 07-24-2008. During this manifestation, a gunshot attracted the attention of the nuns. Upon entering the room, they found SCP-4166-1 alone, holding a pistol at the entrance to its room.
