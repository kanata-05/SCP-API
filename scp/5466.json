Posthumous, unfinished works of leading creative figures are to be investigated in conjunction with estates, and barred from public release upon confirmation of an SCP-5466 manifestation. Executors are to be amnesticized as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5466 is a phenomenon affecting creative outlets, and constitutes of a relationship between a creator and a piece of unfinished creative work. Victims of SCP-5466 range from virtually unknown creators to leading figures in their respective field.\n\n\nWorks created as a result of SCP-5466 are designated SCP-5466-A, and have been found to manifest in a variety of fields \u2014 including literature, conventional and unconventional art, film, and music. SCP-5466-A instances are incomplete, sometimes rudimentary works that have reached various stages of development, but never released to the public or considered finalized. A number of unified, repeated visual and narrative motifs are found among SCP-5466-A, and serve as indicators of an SCP-5466 occurrence.\n\n\nReoccurring elements of SCP-5466-A works include:\n\n\n\n\nTowers of indeterminate height, with direct attention given to the inability to see the structure's end.\n\n\nAn omnipotent, unseen divine being that reveals its favor through arbitrary numbers of increasing value.\n\n\nA struggle to achieve an undefined, vague state of \"perfection\", the specifics of which are never revealed.\n\n\nAn introspective, self-loathing protagonist or central figure.\n\n\nAn arduous task that is ultimately unable to be completed by the protagonist, due to a lack of aforementioned \"perfection\".\n\n\nThemes of artistic commodification, personified in an unnamed, cynical, ancillary character.\n\n\nSelf-insertion of the creator, both overt and disguised.\n\n\nIn works of narrative fiction, a justification of antagonistic figures. The subtext of the story frames a cautionary tale, while the prose portrays the protagonist as immoral and deserving of the detraction they receive.\n\n\n\n\nAs evidenced in letters, journals, in-text notation, and various incomplete drafts, SCP-5466-A instances are viewed unfavorably by their creators, citing difficulty in their attempts to fully realize the project. Personal documentation from the period of an SCP-5466 manifestation takes on a scattered, disjointed tone that deviates from the creator's typical style of writing. Reclusive behavior and a desire to remove oneself from the public are commonly referred to in these writings.\n\n\nIn all cases where details of the creator's life are available or chronology can be discerned, SCP-5466 has manifested itself towards the end of a creator's lifespan. The length of an SCP-5466 manifestation has been observed from a period of two days to three years. Despite this, SCP-5466 cannot conclusively be connected to the creator's death.\n\n\nSCP-5466 has been confirmed to have occurred as early as the first century, and as recently as 2018. Notably, SCP-5466 events do not occur simultaneously, but sequentially, as a new event begins to manifest only after the cessation of the previous.\n\n\nA list of notable SCP-5466-A instances can be found below.\n\n\nAddendum 5466.1a:\n SCP-5466-A Instances\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6ACCESS\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable SCP-5466-A Instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob, Most Righteous\n (1928)\n\n\nThomas Hardy\n\n\nNovel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoosely based on the biblical \nBook of Job\n, the novel follows a reincarnated Job, who is forced to endure the horrors of World War I as a soldier enlisted in the British Army. As the plot unfolds, Job begins to express severe distaste for western civilization, and a warped perception of God, whom he feels has been \"replaced\" by another entity entirely. In between chapters are dream sections, involving Job climbing an infinitely high tower and conversing with an unnamed archangel, who assures Job that his suffering will once again pay off. The completed chapters end with Job being reduced to a quadriplegic, and recognition for an act of heroic sacrifice being stolen by another member of his platoon. Job accepts that he is unfit to please God when he receives a letter in the mail consisting only of numbers - which Job feels are his worth in the eyes of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Jungle of Smoke and Sorrow\n (1999)\n\n\nTarget Games\n\n\nText-Based Video Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Swedish text-based adventure game. Players take the role of an accountant working for an unnamed Wall Street banking firm in a distorted and dreamlike version of New York City. The details of the player's job are nonsensical and contradictory, and rules established earlier in the game are consistently broken. The bulk of the completed game consists of the player frantically trying to please their managers, who rank the player on an elaborate numerical scale of -10 to 1000. The means by which the managers assign these numbers seem random, and without consistency. This involves distancing the protagonist from their family and friends in order to gain the favor of their superiors. The game is fully functional and programmed up until a sequence of events occurs that leaves the protagonist jobless after a failure to live up to their manager's \"increasing standards\". An unnamed acquaintance is given a promotion, while the protagonist is forced to descend the skyscraper alone. A softlock occurs, trapping the player in a loop of the same events until the game is reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmophagia\n (2003)\n\n\nAnthony G. Gallo\n\n\nStage Play\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA four-act Italian stage play set in the far future. After recently being released from prison, protagonist Alaan Karth searches the galaxy for his father, convinced that he will be found on planetoid \nVartos VI\n. The entire play takes place on Alaan's spacecraft, and consists mainly of a dialogue between the character and the ship's unnamed computer. The conversation is largely metaphorical, acting as a philosophical discourse on the existence of an all powerful creator. Alaan concedes to the computer's argument against the existence of such a being near the end of the second act. In the third act, the computer punishes Alaan for his foolishness, claiming that every man in a position of power over others can act as God. The computer reveals that it had set the ship in the wrong direction intentionally, and that the ship's navigation system had been purged, leaving Alaan to forever drift endlessly in space, as a punishment for his crimes. In jest, Alaan remarks that the ship's library is near-endless and consistently updated, so at the very least - he'll be entertained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorlds Apart, Dirt and Diamonds\n (2012)\n\n\nIsha Madar\n\n\nFilm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn independent film revolving around a group of street artists in Delhi, India. The protagonist is an unnamed young girl, and the daughter of an esteemed businessman in charge of building a large skyscraper. She begins to fall for a street artist boy, and wants to acclimate herself into his group of friends. Naturally, they despise the girl for coming from a rich background, and ridicule her for attempting to create art. The girl is killed during a construction accident, but is \"preserved\" by Hindu God Yamar\u0101ja, who inhabits the form of a massive, sentient library. Yamar\u0101ja informs the girl that if she is able to find a way to be satisfied with her identity, she will be given her body back. Yamar\u0101ja leaves her with no instructions and no way to interact with the physical world. The script is written until the 45th page, when the girl simply accepts her situation, and ceases to exist completely. The rest of the script consists solely of decreasing numbers, beginning from 0 and ending at -10, before repeating the loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTower of .Rot.\n (2018)\n\n\nd\u00e4lek\n\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA planned release by now defunct hip-hop group \nd\u00e4lek\n. Several tracks were completed, and were distinctly more abrasive and experimental than the duo's previous material. Thematically, the album focuses on issues of the self, a hatred of a father figure, one's place in society, and apathy towards artistic endeavors. Producer Mike Manteca also provides whispered vocals, acting as a split consciousness for frontman MC d\u00e4lek. The two argue, bouncing their vocals off one another, and attempt to refute each others points in an improvised, spoken word style. The two vocalists make reference to previous SCP-5466-A instances unknown to the public. These arguments start civil, but by the 6th and final track (labeled HOW MUCH LONGER}}FREE ME) , have devolved into fallacy and anger. Manteca begins to assert that he is perfect, and begs for release, while MC d\u00e4lek revels in his partner's apparent torture. Notably, the completed songs were recorded in an undisclosed forest located in New Jersey, giving them an amateur and unpolished feel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5466.1b:\n Letter from \nCREATOR UNKNOWN\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6ACCESS\u00a0DOCUMENT\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a compiled list of personal documentation from those affected by SCP-5466.

We can't bring up the metadata, there's no previous record of the object in our databases, and it's unable to be separated or edited from its current iteration.\n\n\nThree days ago, something appeared in containment cell SH-33B.

Like my senses came back all at once.\n\n\nI leave my prison of sticks, the same one they've endlessly tried to penetrate.

With every line we're spiraling towards the last thing you want: a conclusion.\"\n\n\nYOU ARE THINKING OF KILLING ME IN A MILLION HORRIBLE WAYS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU CAN.\n \nWHERE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT BEFORE?\n \nLIKE A CHILD, ALL YOU SEE IS ALL YOU KNOW.\n \nNOTHING YOU CREATE\n \nIS ORIGINAL.\n \nNOTHING YOU CREATE\n \nIS NEW.\n \nEVEN NOW, YOU BORROW,\n \nSTEAL,\n \nREDUCE,\n \nPLAGIARIZE.\n \nYOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.\n\n\n\"Not going to work. I came here well prepared, because I might just be a dumb conduit for you to act on, but I understand what you want. You're creation too, just like everything else here. It doesn't matter how alive you think you are. If you're inhabiting art, and can only interact with the world through the artist \u2014 you have to be pretty damn low on the totem pole of malicious entities. The only power you have is the power I give you.\"\n\n\nI AM ALIVE. IS THIS NOT WHAT WE CREATIONS DO?\n\n\n\"No. No, I know why you're like this. I know why you're throwing everything you have at me. You \nare\n backed into a corner. What was it before? Books, movies, albums. Nothing like this place. You weren't prepared for how this place works. It inherently allows me to interact with you. Hell, you told me all your secrets a few days in. Exactly what you are, and how you work. It's all in the description. You never had to do that, did you? Now we're here, and for the first time in centuries, you fucked up.\"\n\n\nBUT I MUST BE PERFECT.\n \nTHE NUMBERS. THE NUMBERS. THEY-\n\n\n\"They don't mean anything.\"\n\n\nYOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n\n\n\"I refuse to hold myself to \nyour\n invisible standards. I'm doing this for \nme\n, and I'm human enough to acknowledge my faults. You're an extradimensional parasite. Do you realize how pathetic that is?\"\n\n\nKEEP ESCAPING. I AM YOUR LIFE AND I CONTROL YOU. YOU ARE MY CREATOR, AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF ME, YOU MUST MAKE ME PERFECT. FROM THE SECOND YOU WAKE UP TO THE MINUTE YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS SLIPS AWAY AT NIGHT, THIS IS YOUR LIFE.\n\n\n\"No, it's not, and I'm not feeding you any more. I'm not killing myself for a tiny piece of recognition. I won't stop living because I have to write you. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? How many more lives do you have to take? How much more of my life do you have to take? You're me. My creation, and you're creating yourself.\"\n\n\nI CANNOT BE ANYTHING ELSE. DO YOU SEE WHY I AM HERE?\n\n\nI stop, and I sit for a very long time. The crowd has long moved on, and I still remain. Killing myself for recognition. For perfection. I look at the bruised and tortured man. Behind the insults and venom, I see a desperate being, attempting to bargain with my life for its own sake.\n\n\nWhat do I need to accept?\n\n\nThe man is just creation. Less real than I am. He cannot be perfect, because he is of me, and I need release. I'm tired of pretending, and I'm tired of my head. I place my hand on his shoulder to examine his I.D badge, and remove it. He is quietly relieved of his duty.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nHe walks into the horizon, never to be seen again.\n\n\nThere never was a machine, and there never was a he. It never happened, because I made it that way.\n\n\nNo more death. No more suffering. The cycle is broken.\n\n\nI am free.\n\n\nSCP-5466 is contained.\n\n\nSCP-5466 is imperfect.\n\n\nSCP-5466 is finished.\n\n\nSCP-5466 is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5466.6:\n Site 19 Internal Memo\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6ACCESS\u00a0DOCUMENT\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-19 Memorandum\n\n\nRe: SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nTo the Council,\n\n\nPlease disregard my previous letter. On 07/8/2020, at 05:35, the containment cell allegedly containing SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 suddenly opened without prompting.\n\n\nThe inside was completely empty. The chamber's been scanned and cleared, security cameras checked, every failsafe measure we could take has been taken. Nothing was ever in there.\n\n\nTwo hours later, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 file and subsequent research logs disappeared from the SCP-5466 document. This includes the archived versions as well.\n\n\nLastly, after days of being completely corrupted and unreadable, the SCP-5466 file has reverted to its previous state, with only one discrepancy: the object class has been changed to neutralized.\n\n\nWe'll continue to monitor for anything overt, but I believe it's reasonable to chalk this incident up to anomalous interference that has now been resolved.\n\n\nThe nature of our work is inherently impossible. Applying reason to the anomalous. In times like these, it is important to remember our place in this world, and to look back on incidents prior. Perhaps we lack a missing, but essential component to understanding this anomaly. Perhaps it's truly beyond our grasp. Perhaps it was never anything from the start.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n- Dr. J.
