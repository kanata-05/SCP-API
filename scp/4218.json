If courses matching the criteria are located, web crawlers will remove the course and all associated information and quarantine all removed items for study at Site-15. Once quarantined, members of MTF Rho-1 (\"The Professors\") should enroll in SCP-4218-1 through SCP-4218-5, as well as any future courses uncovered, as part of ongoing containment. They should complete each course as offered and prepare a report on its contents for the Site Director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4218 is a series of five educational web seminars offered by \nALEXYLVA UNIVERSITY\n.\n1\n Courses were discovered by members of MTF Rho-1 during investigation of ALEXYLVA's website. Special attention was given not only because of a previously unknown relationship with Anderson Robotics, but because the courses appear to be accessible interdimensionally via the world wide web.\n\n\nEach known seminar, here labeled SCP-4218-1 through -5, appears to be made in conjunction with \nAnderson's Robotics\n. The format generally adheres to the standard of a MOOC\n2\n or other, similar online course. Topics covered include but are not limited to philosophy, ethics, introductory robotics, anomalous history, and android biology.\n\n\nA list of known courses is available below:\n\n\nSCP-4218-1: THE PINOCCHIO QUESTION: HUMANITY'S DEFINITION\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0show\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION:\n DOES ARTIFICIALLY CREATED LIFE HAVE THE SAME VALUE AS THAT OF A NATURAL BORN HUMAN?

We must urge our fellow scholars to seek masters of history, of art, of state and politics. We must reach out to \nthose who paint the town red\n, who \nrule the world with gold and green\n, even those who remained loyal to \nthe Lab which stole fire from the gods\n. Friend Vincent has already planned to launch an inter-curricular program with \nhis Alma Mater\n.\n\n\nThere are zero excuses to delay Friend Vincent's plan to unite the world by way of shared information, and we must enact the expansion of our new course catalog with all haste.

WHAT BETTER MAN TO LEAD THE NEW UNION OF MAN AND MACHINE THAN HE WHO IS THE MASTER OF BOTH?\n\n\nBY THE END OF THIS EIGHT WEEK COURSE, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY ANDROIDS ARE THE NEXT STAGE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION, WHY ANDERSON ROBOTICS IS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE, AND WHY ONLY VINCENT ANDERSON IS FIT TO LEAD IT.
