Image taken from aerial drone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n All satellite and flyover data of the SCP-4382 affected region must be actively censored. Blockades and checkpoints have been constructed along all roads leading to SCP-4382. Outpost 4382 will continue to monitor SCP-4382's rate of expansion.\n\n\nAll personnel assigned to SCP-4382 must work in paired teams; partners should be chosen with strong, preexisting relationships. If any member of staff begins to exhibit \"looping\" behaviors, contact the Outpost 4382 medical team immediately, then employ the following measures:\n\n\n1. Speak their names loudly and clearly. Use varying titles and nicknames.\n\n2. Use light physical contact such as shaking the shoulders or jostling.\n\n3. Make sudden, loud noises such as clapping, snapping, or shouting.\n\n4. Elaborate on a shared experience or planned event. Focus on key sensory details.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4382 is the town of Hulwick, Kentucky, U.S.A. Since October 18th, 2018, this town has been encased in a reality-altering anomaly, affecting 8.7km\n2\n and expanding outward in a spherical radius at .5m\n2\n per month. When viewed from the exterior, this sphere produces a mild visual distortion. Staff has described this phenomenon as \"like the skin of a giant soap bubble.\"\n\n\nAll objects, animals, and people inside the town of Hulwick will continuously perform a single pattern of actions ad infinitum, and with total disregard for any physical laws.\n\n\nThis effect is poorly documented, as the area of SCP-4382 causes severe aliasing and static interruption in all forms of visual data. Audio transmissions appear unaffected. On May 18th, 2019, MTF-Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n1\n were dispatched to investigate this anomaly, and determine its source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 1 - SCP-4382\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/05/18 | 1:15PM\n\n\nLocation:\n Outpost 4382\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\nSite-9:\n Xi-5, this is Command, please report in.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n 5-1, coms online.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n 5-2, coms online.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n 5-3, coms online!\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n 5-4, coms online.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Squad is green, Command. We've just finished our last equipment check; Kant Counters\n2\n, Sandford Clocks\n3\n and Livelights\n4\n are all calibrated.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Roger, Xi-5. You are cleared to enter 4382. Locate the source of the anomaly, and contain if possible. If not, document everything you can.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n You heard 'em Bullies. Let's get weird.\n\n\nThe task force are observed by Outpost 4382 video-drones entering the distortion field; straight-line formation, five second delays.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, we're in. Looking up, the sun has completely changed position. It looks like early morning around here, and we're getting 3 ticks on the Hume already. Team, remember the protocols. No dwelling on anything. Vary up your sights, your sounds, and your thoughts. We've got a long hike into town.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n Yes Captain.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Confirmed, sir.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Conf- I mean, uh, affirmative Team Leader.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Good. Let's get moving.\n\n\n16 minutes of radio silence; team chatter expunged.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, we're about 30 minutes out. We're coming up over a hill. I can see the main thoroughfare, and the clocktower. Anyone got eyes on a loop?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Nothing yet, Captain. It's all baseline- I mean, except the fact we're walking through an October forest in May. This is kind of nice actually; I've always loved autumn.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n I figure after eight months it gets old. Hold on- hey, Command? I've got a squirrel.\n\n\nSite-9:\n 5-4, please repeat?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n Squirrel, Command; American Red, specifically. It's on a low branch of a nearby tree. I swear it's been chewing on the same acorn for the past twenty seconds.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n I see it. I'm going to approach.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Confirmed. Use caution, 5-3.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n It's a friggin' squirrel.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Banks.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n I copy, Command.\n\n\nXi-5-3 approaches the subject\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Huh. Yeah. It's not responding to my presence at all. I'm nearly touching the thing. The acorn\u2026 woah, freaky. The squirrel is eating it in that typical turn-and-bite way, but the previous bites are growing back at an equal pace. It's like an endless acorn. I wonder wha- woah!\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n Banks, you alright?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Uh, yeah, sorry. I just sort of, uh, flicked it. Now\u2026 yep. It's dead Command. It dropped right out of the tree.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n You weren't cleared to engage, 5-3.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Sorry Captain; but it's good to know before we encountered any people, hey?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Hmh. Command, should we get a sample of-\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n Uh, sir? Sir I think- Higs, you good? Hey, Higs!\n\n\nTask force converges on Xi-5-2's location. Someone is heard snapping loudly.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n 5-2. Higs. Higashi. Yasuo. Snap out of it, come on.\n\n\nXi-5-2 does not respond. Very faint, repetitive mumbling is heard over Xi-5-2's coms.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n Command, I think 5-2 is looping. He's crouched down by\u2026 a fern, I think. A drop of water is falling from one of the leaves, but before it reaches the ground, it re-appears on the leaf. It just forms, rolls, and drops. It forms, rolls, and drops. Forms, rolls, dro-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Lyydia!\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n R- Ah! Fuck! I\u2026 sorry, Captain. I don't know\u2026\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Command, I think I've got 5-2. He's lucid, but he's a bit glossy-eyed.\n\n\nSite-9:\n We've sent a retrieval team for 5-2. Should we scrub?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Negative, Command. We're already here. Banks, Saksa, you're still green?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n That's a copy, Captain. Higs, hey buddy, keep looking at me, okay? Dispatch is coming; you'll be at the outpost in no time. You've got one of Molly's lunches waiting, remember? She always makes you the best lunches. You better wake up Higs, or I'm stealing your fucking lunch.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Hey! We've got a smile. Command, I'd like to report a smile here. I think he's alright\u2026 but all the same, tell that retrieval team to hustle up, hey?\n\n\nSite-9:\n Copy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a02\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a02\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 2 - SCP-4382\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/05/18 | 3:10PM\n\n\nLocation:\n Hulwick\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, this is Xi-5-1. We've reached the center of town. How's Higs?\n\n\nSite-9:\n Copy 5-1. 5-2 is responding well. We've got him on the same treatment regimen as the recovered civilians from last year. We're seeing a good response to rapid visual stimuli.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Thanks Coms, keep me posted. As for Hulwick\u2026 I have to tell you Command, this is one of the freakier ones.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Please elaborate, 5-1.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: It looks like they were setting up a celebration when the anomaly occurred; that means they've been decorating for the last eight months non-stop. There's a woman ahead of me in a blue dress. She's climbing a ladder, and tying off one end of a banner. \"Hulwick Harvest Festival\", it says. She climbs down, moves the ladder across the street. Just as she finishes tying the other side, the first knot unravels, and the banner falls. She moves back across the street to string it up again, only for the other side to fall. She's repeated this pattern eighteen times now, and it's the same everywhere I look.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Copy, 5-1. Remember, do not observe any single temporal loop for too long.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: I don't think this is temporal, Command. I'm not seeing any sudden \"cuts\" or speed deviations, and my Sandford is ticking on normally. Kant Counter is nearing a hard 8, though. I honestly think this might just be a Wildcat\n5\n.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Without a deviant temporal frequency?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: I'm telling you, we've got stable tempo in here. You almost wouldn't notice anything is wrong, if everyone wasn't doing the same thing repeatedly. Something must be actively maintaining the HUI\n6\n. Something powerful. I can't imagine what though.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Neither can I Command, but I can guess where it is! Just did a quick 360 and, yep, guess what? The Humey is peaking when I aim it towards 4382's radial center. How nice, we were heading to Point Alpha anyway.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: Hey, guys, I've got a protracted loop here. Clocked it at six minutes.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Damn, that is a long one! Report, Saksa.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: It's a kid on his bike. He's wobbling a bit as he rides; probably because of that big fuckin' shoulder bag he's got. He's riding along, then for a split second looks away from the sidewalk to re-adjust his bag, just in time for a group of boys to round out of an alley. They collide.\n\n\nOne of the boys is knocked to the ground, and the kid falls off his bike. A bunch- like, six books fall out of his bag. The boys help their friend up, and start shouting at the bike kid. He scrambles to collect the books. One of the boys kicks a big red hardcover off the sidewalk, and it falls open-page on a sewer grate covered in wet clumps of leaves.\n\n\nThe boys laugh, and walk on. The bike kid is trying to dry the book off with his sleeve. He's crying, I think. I can't tell, and I don't want to get too close. He's wiping his nose a lot, at least. He gets back on his bike, and wobbles a bit before taking off. I've seen this exact scene play out three times already. The kid seems to be cycling around the block, and the alleyway boys keep doubling back. Cycle, collide, spill, kick, cry. Over and over.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Thank you, 5-4. Please stop observing this loop.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: I'm seeing similar patterns, Command. Shorter loops. The same man forgetting his coat in the hair salon, going back for it, and walking out without it again. A trio of feral cats running between the legs of an old woman, making her stumble and drop a can of tomatoes from her grocery bags. A little girl skips by and helps her pick it up. Now cats run by again, she drops it again and- yep, there's the little girl. Command, I think the anomaly is causing closed loops; causal loops, actually. People are getting trapped in a cycle of actions. I'd almost say it's memetic, but, well, nobody has fallen over or starved. It's like the reality here is just allowing for it, until something stops it.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Like the squirrel.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Yes, like the squirrel. Alright, let's group back up and head for Point Alpha.\n\n\n45 seconds of radio silence as the task force regroups.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: 5-4, you with us? Lyydia?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: Hm? Oh, fine, Captain. Just thinking about that kid. What a fucking hell, huh? Eight months living that awful moment again and again.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Not to him. None of the civilians we recovered from the outskirts remembered looping, Saksa. To that kid, it's just happening once.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: Once is too many.\n\n\nTask force begins moving through down again, heading for Point Alpha.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Hey, Saksa? You still thinking about that kid? You're awful quiet.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: No, I'm just\u2026 there were boys like that in my home town too. Vicious little bastards. They'd always make fun of my hair.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Yeah, well, you're the Bully now, right? M.T.F. Xi-5 hey hey!\n\n\nXi-5-4 does not respond.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Hey?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa\n: It's just- It's knowing that it keeps happening over and over, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's just like when I was a kid; I'd get to homeroom, sit at my desk and then Paavo's there pulling on my hair. He'd always do it so quick. The teachers never believed me. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to class, and there's Paavo pulling my hair. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to cla-\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Uh, Captain? Captain!?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Saksa? Lyydia! God damn it, what was she watching!?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Nothing! We were just talking! Fuck! Command, copy! Copy damn it, Lyydia is looping. Hey, hey girl, look at me!\n\n\nXi-5-3 begins clapping her hands loudly, and at infrequent tempos\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n -vo pulling my hair. Every day, I'd just wake up-\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Come on Lil, snap out of it! You're not there anymore! You grew up! You're a bad-ass science commando now! You're my squad-mate! Lyydia!\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Command, we need that evac now.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Dispatch sent, 5-1. It's going to take some time. We need you to keep moving to Point Alpha.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: What!? Command, we're not leaving her here-\n\n\nSite-9\n: The longer you're inside SCP-4382, the higher risk we run 5-3. Activate 5-4's beacon, and move on.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Command, I have to protest-\n\n\nSite-9\n: That's an order, Captain.\n\n\nXi-5-1 and Xi-5-3 go silent. Xi-5-4 continues speaking.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Saksa:\n -ake up, go to class, and there's Paavo-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Copy, Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a02019/05/18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log Part 3 - SCP-4382\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/05/18 | 5:56PM\n\n\nLocation:\n Hulwick.\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Site, this is Xi-5 reporting in. Please tell me this is the first time this hour.\n\n\nSite-9:\n We're receiving you Captain. Don\u2019t worry, you aren\u2019t looping.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Thank God. We\u2019re approaching Point Alpha. It's getting harder to focus, and the loops are all short here.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Copy, and please elaborate.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Yeah, Command? I\u2019ve got eyes on one right now. Elderly woman; I can see her through the garden window. She's making soup I think. She\u2019s just chopping the same carrot, over and over. Little, tight rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same carrot, over and over. Little tight rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same carrot, over and-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n 5-3, focus up! Hey! Listen to me.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n -ittle rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same ca-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Not again, damn it- Chile! Come on Banks, think! After this, you\u2019re going on vacation, remember? Chile, the salt flats? The desert after the rain?\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n -ver and over\u2026 same\u2026 salt flats. The desert after the rain, like one big mirror so I'm standing in the stars\u2026 Captain?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n There you go. Good. Command, be advised. 5-3 is returning to base.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Salt\u2026 what? Hey, no!\n\n\nA muffled clattering sound is heard as Xi-5-3 grabs Xi-5-1 by the shoulders and shakes them.\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Cap, you cannot be here alone! Command, this is 5-3. I\u2019m fine. Repeat, I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m repeating because I \nchoose to\n. Disregard that last advisory.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Damnit Banks- Command! This is Captain Adamson, and I am ordering 5-3 to return to base.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Captain, what\u2019s going to happen if you\u2019re the one who goes loopy? Who\u2019s going to snap you out of it?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Damnit Banks\u2026 Damnit Banks-\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Wes! Sna-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n I'm not looping, you idiot! I\u2019m just pissed off at you! Jesus, you never listen to me! This is why we didn't-\n\n\nRadio silence for 4 seconds.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Uh, Xi-5, this is command. We\u2019re making the call. You move forward. 5-3 is right, we need you in pairs.\n\n\nXi-5-1 exhales hard.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Roger.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Roger.\n\n\nThe sound of Xi-5-1 and Xi-5-3 walking through dry leaves is heard for 3 minutes.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, I think we\u2019re here. The Kant Counter is in the red\u2026 hell, I think it\u2019s gone past the red. It looks like an old farm house, except there\u2019s no farm out here. It\u2019s just an empty lot, and a big house. Address is 13 Chadwick.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Checking the directory. Property belongs to\u2026 Dennis and Margret McArthur. Nothing on file for either of them. Is the source inside the house?\n\n\nSounds of walking is briefly heard.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Nnnnnegative command; Kant has a slight drop off at the house, actually. I\u2019m looking into one of the windows a-\u2026 oh, Christ.\n\n\nSite-9:\n 5-3?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Eugh. Uh, Command, we\u2019ve got two corpses here. They\u2019re just laid out on the living room. Lots of stab wounds. They-\u2026 oh god, Command, scratch that. One of them is still alive. Or\u2026 fuck, maybe he just can\u2019t die? The man is trying to pull himself up towards a wall-mounted rotary phone. He keeps slipping back down the bloody wall, over and-\u2026 eugh.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, the source seems to be coming from the back yard- back field, I mean. We\u2019re proceeding there now.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Uh, Captain, shouldn't we-?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Too risky, and anything we'd do would kill him anyway.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n That might be for the best.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Point Alpha is our priority, Anna. Come on.\n\n\nXi-5-1 is heard walking. After a two second delay, Xi-5-3 moves as well.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n We\u2019ve got a secondary structure here. Large, sheet metal; it's partially collapsed and covered in rust. It looks like a big garage of some kind.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n It's a tractor garage. We had 'em back home. See the big ass tire treads worn into the dirt?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Huh. So the source is\u2026 a tractor?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Only one way to find out. Command, I\u2019m going to open \u2018er up.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Confirmed. Be careful 5-3.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Roger.\n\n\nThe sound of rusted metal grinding on an axle is heard.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Whoa!\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Holy fucking shit.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Squad, report. What is it? What\u2019s inside the garage?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n It\u2019s, uh\u2026 a machine, Command. I think. It\u2019s like one of those spider web colonies that cover whole trees, just with wires and pipes and stuff. It's all scraps and pieces wrapped around this big metal stalk\u2026 you know those globes they have at the Science Museum? Van-De-Whatevers; the ones that make your hair stand on end. Its like one of those, except it has a glass sphere at the center with five metal balls inside. They\u2019re all rolling around each other, over and over. Damn this is huge, Command. It's nearly touching the ceiling!\n\n\nSite-9:\n Confirmed. Do you see a power supply? Do the cables run anywhere?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Yeah, everywhere. Hold on.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Command, I\u2019ve got something.\n\n\nSite-9:\n A power supply?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Negative. There\u2019s a small desk tucked into the corner. I see some diagrams, a few equations- it\u2019s all scribes but- huh. Command? I think this might be a journal. It\u2019s signed \"Seth McArthur\u201d.\n\n\nSite-9:\n Checking\u2026 confirmed, the home owners did have a son named Seth.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n That might explain who this is! I followed the cables around the back of the garage. There's a kid here, standing in front of a big\u2026 transformer, maybe? He doesn't look much older than 16. He keeps pressing buttons. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over a- gah! Damn it. The kid looks, I don\u2019t know, panicked? He\u2019s gritting his teeth, and his foreheads all sweaty\u2026 I can't be sure, but I think maybe he\u2019s trying to shut it down.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Or he might just be keeping it running, Command.\n\n\nSite-9:\n What do you mean, 5-1?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n I\u2019ve been skimming the journal, and it\u2019s pretty clear the kid made this mess. \u201cJanuary 5th, 2008. Nobody gets it. The world is wrong. Why can\u2019t they see. Why doesn\u2019t anyone listen to me. I\u2019m the smartest kid in school. I skipped four grades. Even the teachers are stupid compared to me-\u201c Wow, seems like a nice kid.\n\n\nSite-9:\n 5-1, does it say anything about the device?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Hold on, there\u2019s a lot here. It\u2019s mostly nonsense. \u201cI\u2019ve read all the books. Every physics textbook in the school library, and it\u2019s all wrong. I know it. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve skipped a number\n7\n. All our predictions and theories are based on a faulty premise. I just know it. I don\u2019t know how, but when I look at these equations, I just know they\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re all wrong. It\u2019s all wrong.\u201d Jesus kid, repeat yourself much? \u2026 aha! Here. \u201cI can build it. It's so simple, that's how I'll show them all! Perpetual motion is possible, you just need the right machine. They just don\u2019t get it; it's not about creating motion, it about creating a place where you change the constant of the universe.\u201d Wait, what?\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Command, hang on. I think I might have something here. The kid keeps hitting the same three buttons, but for a split second before he goes back to \u2018Red\u2019, his finger moves just a fraction closer to this little switch here. I think that might be the sequence!\n\n\nSite-9:\n Negative 5-3, do not attempt to operate the device.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n \u201cOctober 15th, 2010\u201d Oh shit, Command, I think this is it! \u201cI worked through the night. It\u2019s nearly finished. I had to take apart nearly everything in the house. Dad was furious. He and mom confronted me this morning. They said I\u2019ve been acting \u2018queer\u2019. They told me I need to stop skipping school. Dad knocked the microwave out of my hands. It was that moment I realized he'd never understand. Some minds are too small. Thankfully, I had my multi-tool with me. One more problem solved.\u201d Jesus Christ.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks:\n Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Re- ghuh! Command! I really think this is the sequence! I can shut this thing down!\n\n\nSite-9:\n Negative 5-3. You are not to touch anything. Do you copy? 5-3, do you copy?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n \u201cOctober 15th, 2010, Part 2. It\u2019s ready. The phone won't stop ringing in the house. I think my parents were supposed to help set up for that stupid festival. People must be wondering where they are. I need to hurry. None of it will matter soon. No one will care about two dead hicks when I've re-defined science. I've run through the first cycle, and it looks like the loop is stable. No energy in, no energy out, no energy lost. It's perfect. The diodes are rolling. Over and over. Over and Over. Over and over.\"\n\n\nSite-9\n: 5-1? Damn it. Captain Adamson, do you copy? We\u2019re scrubbing the mission. Return to the evac point now.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: Command, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just reading what he wrote. He just kept writing those words. \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and over. \u201cOver and over.\u201d\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Squad, get out of there! 5-1, 5-3, wake up!\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and over. \u201cOver and over.\u201d\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white- God, fuck it!\n\n\nAll audio is suddenly overtaken by loud, disjointed static. Outpost 4382 reports decreased visual distortions around the town perimeter. Task force audio levels out, but a high-pitch whine is now heard in the background, steadily growing louder.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson\n: \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and Over\" \"Something is wrong. The field is expanding. How can it be expanding?\"\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Red, orange\u2026 hey! Command, this is 5-3! It looks like- yep, the lights are starting to flicker off. I think it\u2019s shutting down! Even the kid seems to be waking up. Hah! We did it! Hey, kid, how in the hell-\n\n\nSeth McArthur\n: Wait! Wait oh fuck wait I need to-\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Whoa- whoa kid! Back away from the panel!\n\n\nThe high-pitched noise grows extremely loud. The sound of Xi-5-3 chambering a round in her gun is heard.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: Back away right now. Do not turn that fucking machine back on.\n\n\nSeth McArthur\n: I\u2019m not! You don't understand! I have to- oh, god, fuck, fuck!\n\n\nThe whine becomes overpowering. Garbled, panicked voices are barely audible.\n\n\nSite-9\n: Squad? 5-1, do you copy? Adamson, Banks, do you copy!?\n\n\nThe noise suddenly stops. Full radio silence for 6 seconds.\n\n\nSeth McArthur\n: Whew, okay\u2026 I think that got it. I just needed to re-balance the-\u2026 I just-\u2026 oh\u2026 ohhhh.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Banks\n: What? What is it?\n\n\nSeth McArthur\n: I\u2026 just figured out where all the energy goes.\n\n\n\n\nA large explosion is heard. The signal cuts out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2019/05/18:\n A helicopter fly-over of Hulwick shows a mushroom cloud originating from Point Alpha. No sound, or shockwave was detected by Outpost 4382. Most of the McArthur farm plot is enveloped. The cloud appears to be suspended in mid-combustion, fire continuously rolling beneath the upper cloud rim.\n\n\nAddendum 2019/06/03\n: The Hulwick explosion is still ongoing. Outpost 4382 reports the conflagration is animated, but the explosion itself is still static in shape and size. While the SCP-4382 anomaly has stopped expanding, the 8.7km\n2\n \"bubble\" shows no signs of collapse. All testing and exploration of Hulwick have been suspended until a solution can be devised.\n\n\nAddendum 2019/08/19:\n Outpost 4382, during an autonomous sonar sweep of the SCP-4382 interior, has detected a repeating communication signal from Captain Wes Adamson. Xi-5 Captain Saksa and Officer Higashi have filed an official request to mount an extraction mission. The Foundation has ruled that, due to their proximity to the explosion and length of time within SCP-4382, both Wes Adamson and Anna Banks shall be declared KIA. Xi-5's request has been denied.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - SCP-4382\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/05/18 | 6:12PM\n\n\nLocation:\n Hulwick.\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-1|Adamson:\n Banks? Banks, stay there!

        "Exploration Log 1 - SCP-4382 Date: 2019/05/18 | 1:15PM Location: Outpost 4382 MTF: Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\" Site-9: Xi-5, this is Command, please report in. Xi-5-1|Adamson: 5-1, coms online. Xi-5-2|Higashi: 5-2, coms online. Xi-5-3|Banks: 5-3, coms online! Xi-5-4|Saksa: 5-4, coms online. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Squad is green, Command. We've just finished our last equipment check; Kant Counters 2 , Sandford Clocks 3 and Livelights 4 are all calibrated. Site-9: Roger, Xi-5. You are cleared to enter 4382. Locate the source of the anomaly, and contain if possible. If not, document everything you can. Xi-5-1|Adamson: You heard 'em Bullies. Let's get weird. The task force are observed by Outpost 4382 video-drones entering the distortion field; straight-line formation, five second delays. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, we're in. Looking up, the sun has completely changed position. It looks like early morning around here, and we're getting 3 ticks on the Hume already. Team, remember the protocols. No dwelling on anything. Vary up your sights, your sounds, and your thoughts. We've got a long hike into town. Xi-5-4|Saksa: Yes Captain. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Confirmed, sir. Xi-5-3|Banks: Conf- I mean, uh, affirmative Team Leader. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Good. Let's get moving. 16 minutes of radio silence; team chatter expunged. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, we're about 30 minutes out. We're coming up over a hill. I can see the main thoroughfare, and the clocktower. Anyone got eyes on a loop? Xi-5-2|Higashi: Nothing yet, Captain. It's all baseline- I mean, except the fact we're walking through an October forest in May. This is kind of nice actually; I've always loved autumn. Xi-5-4|Saksa: I figure after eight months it gets old. Hold on- hey, Command? I've got a squirrel. Site-9: 5-4, please repeat? Xi-5-4|Saksa: Squirrel, Command; American Red, specifically. It's on a low branch of a nearby tree. I swear it's been chewing on the same acorn for the past twenty seconds. Xi-5-3|Banks: I see it. I'm going to approach. Site-9: Confirmed. Use caution, 5-3. Xi-5-3|Banks: It's a friggin' squirrel. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Banks. Xi-5-3|Banks: I copy, Command. Xi-5-3 approaches the subject Xi-5-3|Banks: Huh. Yeah. It's not responding to my presence at all. I'm nearly touching the thing. The acorn\u2026 woah, freaky. The squirrel is eating it in that typical turn-and-bite way, but the previous bites are growing back at an equal pace. It's like an endless acorn. I wonder wha- woah! Xi-5-4|Saksa: Banks, you alright? Xi-5-3|Banks: Uh, yeah, sorry. I just sort of, uh, flicked it. Now\u2026 yep. It's dead Command. It dropped right out of the tree. Xi-5-1|Adamson: You weren't cleared to engage, 5-3. Xi-5-3|Banks: Sorry Captain; but it's good to know before we encountered any people, hey? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Hmh. Command, should we get a sample of- Xi-5-4|Saksa: Uh, sir? Sir I think- Higs, you good? Hey, Higs! Task force converges on Xi-5-2's location. Someone is heard snapping loudly. Xi-5-1|Adamson: 5-2. Higs. Higashi. Yasuo. Snap out of it, come on. Xi-5-2 does not respond. Very faint, repetitive mumbling is heard over Xi-5-2's coms. Xi-5-4|Saksa: Command, I think 5-2 is looping. He's crouched down by\u2026 a fern, I think. A drop of water is falling from one of the leaves, but before it reaches the ground, it re-appears on the leaf. It just forms, rolls, and drops. It forms, rolls, and drops. Forms, rolls, dro- Xi-5-1|Adamson: Lyydia! Xi-5-4|Saksa: R- Ah! Fuck! I\u2026 sorry, Captain. I don't know\u2026 Xi-5-3|Banks: Command, I think I've got 5-2. He's lucid, but he's a bit glossy-eyed. Site-9: We've sent a retrieval team for 5-2. Should we scrub? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Negative, Command. We're already here. Banks, Saksa, you're still green? Xi-5-4|Saksa: That's a copy, Captain. Higs, hey buddy, keep looking at me, okay? Dispatch is coming; you'll be at the outpost in no time. You've got one of Molly's lunches waiting, remember? She always makes you the best lunches. You better wake up Higs, or I'm stealing your fucking lunch. Xi-5-3|Banks: Hey! We've got a smile. Command, I'd like to report a smile here. I think he's alright\u2026 but all the same, tell that retrieval team to hustle up, hey? Site-9: Copy.",
        "Exploration Log 2 - SCP-4382 Date: 2019/05/18 | 3:10PM Location: Hulwick MTF: Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\" Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, this is Xi-5-1. We've reached the center of town. How's Higs? Site-9: Copy 5-1. 5-2 is responding well. We've got him on the same treatment regimen as the recovered civilians from last year. We're seeing a good response to rapid visual stimuli. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Thanks Coms, keep me posted. As for Hulwick\u2026 I have to tell you Command, this is one of the freakier ones. Site-9 : Please elaborate, 5-1. Xi-5-1|Adamson : It looks like they were setting up a celebration when the anomaly occurred; that means they've been decorating for the last eight months non-stop. There's a woman ahead of me in a blue dress. She's climbing a ladder, and tying off one end of a banner. \"Hulwick Harvest Festival\", it says. She climbs down, moves the ladder across the street. Just as she finishes tying the other side, the first knot unravels, and the banner falls. She moves back across the street to string it up again, only for the other side to fall. She's repeated this pattern eighteen times now, and it's the same everywhere I look. Site-9 : Copy, 5-1. Remember, do not observe any single temporal loop for too long. Xi-5-1|Adamson : I don't think this is temporal, Command. I'm not seeing any sudden \"cuts\" or speed deviations, and my Sandford is ticking on normally. Kant Counter is nearing a hard 8, though. I honestly think this might just be a Wildcat 5 . Site-9 : Without a deviant temporal frequency? Xi-5-1|Adamson : I'm telling you, we've got stable tempo in here. You almost wouldn't notice anything is wrong, if everyone wasn't doing the same thing repeatedly. Something must be actively maintaining the HUI 6 . Something powerful. I can't imagine what though. Xi-5-3|Banks : Neither can I Command, but I can guess where it is! Just did a quick 360 and, yep, guess what? The Humey is peaking when I aim it towards 4382's radial center. How nice, we were heading to Point Alpha anyway. Xi-5-4|Saksa : Hey, guys, I've got a protracted loop here. Clocked it at six minutes. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Damn, that is a long one! Report, Saksa. Xi-5-4|Saksa : It's a kid on his bike. He's wobbling a bit as he rides; probably because of that big fuckin' shoulder bag he's got. He's riding along, then for a split second looks away from the sidewalk to re-adjust his bag, just in time for a group of boys to round out of an alley. They collide. One of the boys is knocked to the ground, and the kid falls off his bike. A bunch- like, six books fall out of his bag. The boys help their friend up, and start shouting at the bike kid. He scrambles to collect the books. One of the boys kicks a big red hardcover off the sidewalk, and it falls open-page on a sewer grate covered in wet clumps of leaves. The boys laugh, and walk on. The bike kid is trying to dry the book off with his sleeve. He's crying, I think. I can't tell, and I don't want to get too close. He's wiping his nose a lot, at least. He gets back on his bike, and wobbles a bit before taking off. I've seen this exact scene play out three times already. The kid seems to be cycling around the block, and the alleyway boys keep doubling back. Cycle, collide, spill, kick, cry. Over and over. Site-9 : Thank you, 5-4. Please stop observing this loop. Xi-5-1|Adamson : I'm seeing similar patterns, Command. Shorter loops. The same man forgetting his coat in the hair salon, going back for it, and walking out without it again. A trio of feral cats running between the legs of an old woman, making her stumble and drop a can of tomatoes from her grocery bags. A little girl skips by and helps her pick it up. Now cats run by again, she drops it again and- yep, there's the little girl. Command, I think the anomaly is causing closed loops; causal loops, actually. People are getting trapped in a cycle of actions. I'd almost say it's memetic, but, well, nobody has fallen over or starved. It's like the reality here is just allowing for it, until something stops it. Xi-5-3|Banks : Like the squirrel. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Yes, like the squirrel. Alright, let's group back up and head for Point Alpha. 45 seconds of radio silence as the task force regroups. Xi-5-1|Adamson : 5-4, you with us? Lyydia? Xi-5-4|Saksa : Hm? Oh, fine, Captain. Just thinking about that kid. What a fucking hell, huh? Eight months living that awful moment again and again. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Not to him. None of the civilians we recovered from the outskirts remembered looping, Saksa. To that kid, it's just happening once. Xi-5-4|Saksa : Once is too many. Task force begins moving through down again, heading for Point Alpha. Xi-5-3|Banks : Hey, Saksa? You still thinking about that kid? You're awful quiet. Xi-5-4|Saksa : No, I'm just\u2026 there were boys like that in my home town too. Vicious little bastards. They'd always make fun of my hair. Xi-5-3|Banks : Yeah, well, you're the Bully now, right? M.T.F. Xi-5 hey hey! Xi-5-4 does not respond. Xi-5-3|Banks: Hey? Xi-5-4|Saksa : It's just- It's knowing that it keeps happening over and over, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's just like when I was a kid; I'd get to homeroom, sit at my desk and then Paavo's there pulling on my hair. He'd always do it so quick. The teachers never believed me. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to class, and there's Paavo pulling my hair. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to cla- Xi-5-3|Banks : Uh, Captain? Captain!? Xi-5-1|Adamson : Saksa? Lyydia! God damn it, what was she watching!? Xi-5-3|Banks : Nothing! We were just talking! Fuck! Command, copy! Copy damn it, Lyydia is looping. Hey, hey girl, look at me! Xi-5-3 begins clapping her hands loudly, and at infrequent tempos Xi-5-4|Saksa: -vo pulling my hair. Every day, I'd just wake up- Xi-5-3|Banks : Come on Lil, snap out of it! You're not there anymore! You grew up! You're a bad-ass science commando now! You're my squad-mate! Lyydia! Xi-5-1|Adamson : Command, we need that evac now. Site-9 : Dispatch sent, 5-1. It's going to take some time. We need you to keep moving to Point Alpha. Xi-5-3|Banks : What!? Command, we're not leaving her here- Site-9 : The longer you're inside SCP-4382, the higher risk we run 5-3. Activate 5-4's beacon, and move on. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Command, I have to protest- Site-9 : That's an order, Captain. Xi-5-1 and Xi-5-3 go silent. Xi-5-4 continues speaking. Xi-5-4|Saksa: -ake up, go to class, and there's Paavo- Xi-5-1|Adamson : Copy, Command.",
        "Exploration Log Part 3 - SCP-4382 Date: 2019/05/18 | 5:56PM Location: Hulwick. MTF: Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\" Xi-5-1|Adamson: Site, this is Xi-5 reporting in. Please tell me this is the first time this hour. Site-9: We're receiving you Captain. Don\u2019t worry, you aren\u2019t looping. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Thank God. We\u2019re approaching Point Alpha. It's getting harder to focus, and the loops are all short here. Site-9: Copy, and please elaborate. Xi-5-3|Banks: Yeah, Command? I\u2019ve got eyes on one right now. Elderly woman; I can see her through the garden window. She's making soup I think. She\u2019s just chopping the same carrot, over and over. Little, tight rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same carrot, over and over. Little tight rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same carrot, over and- Xi-5-1|Adamson: 5-3, focus up! Hey! Listen to me. Xi-5-3|Banks: -ittle rows. Perfect straight cuts. The same ca- Xi-5-1|Adamson: Not again, damn it- Chile! Come on Banks, think! After this, you\u2019re going on vacation, remember? Chile, the salt flats? The desert after the rain? Xi-5-3|Banks: -ver and over\u2026 same\u2026 salt flats. The desert after the rain, like one big mirror so I'm standing in the stars\u2026 Captain? Xi-5-1|Adamson: There you go. Good. Command, be advised. 5-3 is returning to base. Xi-5-3|Banks: Salt\u2026 what? Hey, no! A muffled clattering sound is heard as Xi-5-3 grabs Xi-5-1 by the shoulders and shakes them. Xi-5-3|Banks: Cap, you cannot be here alone! Command, this is 5-3. I\u2019m fine. Repeat, I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m repeating because I choose to . Disregard that last advisory. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Damnit Banks- Command! This is Captain Adamson, and I am ordering 5-3 to return to base. Xi-5-3|Banks: Captain, what\u2019s going to happen if you\u2019re the one who goes loopy? Who\u2019s going to snap you out of it? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Damnit Banks\u2026 Damnit Banks- Xi-5-3|Banks: Wes! Sna- Xi-5-1|Adamson: I'm not looping, you idiot! I\u2019m just pissed off at you! Jesus, you never listen to me! This is why we didn't- Radio silence for 4 seconds. Site-9: Uh, Xi-5, this is command. We\u2019re making the call. You move forward. 5-3 is right, we need you in pairs. Xi-5-1 exhales hard. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Roger. Xi-5-3|Banks: Roger. The sound of Xi-5-1 and Xi-5-3 walking through dry leaves is heard for 3 minutes. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, I think we\u2019re here. The Kant Counter is in the red\u2026 hell, I think it\u2019s gone past the red. It looks like an old farm house, except there\u2019s no farm out here. It\u2019s just an empty lot, and a big house. Address is 13 Chadwick. Site-9: Checking the directory. Property belongs to\u2026 Dennis and Margret McArthur. Nothing on file for either of them. Is the source inside the house? Sounds of walking is briefly heard. Xi-5-3|Banks: Nnnnnegative command; Kant has a slight drop off at the house, actually. I\u2019m looking into one of the windows a-\u2026 oh, Christ. Site-9: 5-3? Xi-5-3|Banks: Eugh. Uh, Command, we\u2019ve got two corpses here. They\u2019re just laid out on the living room. Lots of stab wounds. They-\u2026 oh god, Command, scratch that. One of them is still alive. Or\u2026 fuck, maybe he just can\u2019t die? The man is trying to pull himself up towards a wall-mounted rotary phone. He keeps slipping back down the bloody wall, over and-\u2026 eugh. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, the source seems to be coming from the back yard- back field, I mean. We\u2019re proceeding there now. Xi-5-3|Banks: Uh, Captain, shouldn't we-? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Too risky, and anything we'd do would kill him anyway. Xi-5-3|Banks: That might be for the best. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Point Alpha is our priority, Anna. Come on. Xi-5-1 is heard walking. After a two second delay, Xi-5-3 moves as well. Xi-5-1|Adamson: We\u2019ve got a secondary structure here. Large, sheet metal; it's partially collapsed and covered in rust. It looks like a big garage of some kind. Xi-5-3|Banks: It's a tractor garage. We had 'em back home. See the big ass tire treads worn into the dirt? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Huh. So the source is\u2026 a tractor? Xi-5-3|Banks: Only one way to find out. Command, I\u2019m going to open \u2018er up. Site-9: Confirmed. Be careful 5-3. Xi-5-3|Banks: Roger. The sound of rusted metal grinding on an axle is heard. Xi-5-3|Banks: Whoa! Xi-5-1|Adamson: Holy fucking shit. Site-9: Squad, report. What is it? What\u2019s inside the garage? Xi-5-3|Banks: It\u2019s, uh\u2026 a machine, Command. I think. It\u2019s like one of those spider web colonies that cover whole trees, just with wires and pipes and stuff. It's all scraps and pieces wrapped around this big metal stalk\u2026 you know those globes they have at the Science Museum? Van-De-Whatevers; the ones that make your hair stand on end. Its like one of those, except it has a glass sphere at the center with five metal balls inside. They\u2019re all rolling around each other, over and over. Damn this is huge, Command. It's nearly touching the ceiling! Site-9: Confirmed. Do you see a power supply? Do the cables run anywhere? Xi-5-3|Banks: Yeah, everywhere. Hold on. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Command, I\u2019ve got something. Site-9: A power supply? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Negative. There\u2019s a small desk tucked into the corner. I see some diagrams, a few equations- it\u2019s all scribes but- huh. Command? I think this might be a journal. It\u2019s signed \"Seth McArthur\u201d. Site-9: Checking\u2026 confirmed, the home owners did have a son named Seth. Xi-5-3|Banks: That might explain who this is! I followed the cables around the back of the garage. There's a kid here, standing in front of a big\u2026 transformer, maybe? He doesn't look much older than 16. He keeps pressing buttons. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over a- gah! Damn it. The kid looks, I don\u2019t know, panicked? He\u2019s gritting his teeth, and his foreheads all sweaty\u2026 I can't be sure, but I think maybe he\u2019s trying to shut it down. Xi-5-1|Adamson: Or he might just be keeping it running, Command. Site-9: What do you mean, 5-1? Xi-5-1|Adamson: I\u2019ve been skimming the journal, and it\u2019s pretty clear the kid made this mess. \u201cJanuary 5th, 2008. Nobody gets it. The world is wrong. Why can\u2019t they see. Why doesn\u2019t anyone listen to me. I\u2019m the smartest kid in school. I skipped four grades. Even the teachers are stupid compared to me-\u201c Wow, seems like a nice kid. Site-9: 5-1, does it say anything about the device? Xi-5-1|Adamson: Hold on, there\u2019s a lot here. It\u2019s mostly nonsense. \u201cI\u2019ve read all the books. Every physics textbook in the school library, and it\u2019s all wrong. I know it. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve skipped a number 7 . All our predictions and theories are based on a faulty premise. I just know it. I don\u2019t know how, but when I look at these equations, I just know they\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re all wrong. It\u2019s all wrong.\u201d Jesus kid, repeat yourself much? \u2026 aha! Here. \u201cI can build it. It's so simple, that's how I'll show them all! Perpetual motion is possible, you just need the right machine. They just don\u2019t get it; it's not about creating motion, it about creating a place where you change the constant of the universe.\u201d Wait, what? Xi-5-3|Banks: Command, hang on. I think I might have something here. The kid keeps hitting the same three buttons, but for a split second before he goes back to \u2018Red\u2019, his finger moves just a fraction closer to this little switch here. I think that might be the sequence! Site-9: Negative 5-3, do not attempt to operate the device. Xi-5-1|Adamson: \u201cOctober 15th, 2010\u201d Oh shit, Command, I think this is it! \u201cI worked through the night. It\u2019s nearly finished. I had to take apart nearly everything in the house. Dad was furious. He and mom confronted me this morning. They said I\u2019ve been acting \u2018queer\u2019. They told me I need to stop skipping school. Dad knocked the microwave out of my hands. It was that moment I realized he'd never understand. Some minds are too small. Thankfully, I had my multi-tool with me. One more problem solved.\u201d Jesus Christ. Xi-5-3|Banks: Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Re- ghuh! Command! I really think this is the sequence! I can shut this thing down! Site-9: Negative 5-3. You are not to touch anything. Do you copy? 5-3, do you copy? Xi-5-1|Adamson: \u201cOctober 15th, 2010, Part 2. It\u2019s ready. The phone won't stop ringing in the house. I think my parents were supposed to help set up for that stupid festival. People must be wondering where they are. I need to hurry. None of it will matter soon. No one will care about two dead hicks when I've re-defined science. I've run through the first cycle, and it looks like the loop is stable. No energy in, no energy out, no energy lost. It's perfect. The diodes are rolling. Over and over. Over and Over. Over and over.\" Site-9 : 5-1? Damn it. Captain Adamson, do you copy? We\u2019re scrubbing the mission. Return to the evac point now. Xi-5-1|Adamson : Command, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just reading what he wrote. He just kept writing those words. \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and over. \u201cOver and over.\u201d Xi-5-3|Banks : Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Site-9 : Squad, get out of there! 5-1, 5-3, wake up! Xi-5-1|Adamson : \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and over. \u201cOver and over.\u201d Xi-5-3|Banks : Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white- God, fuck it! All audio is suddenly overtaken by loud, disjointed static. Outpost 4382 reports decreased visual distortions around the town perimeter. Task force audio levels out, but a high-pitch whine is now heard in the background, steadily growing louder. Xi-5-1|Adamson : \u201cOver and over\u201d. \u201cOver and Over\" \"Something is wrong. The field is expanding. How can it be expanding?\" Xi-5-3|Banks : Red, orange\u2026 hey! Command, this is 5-3! It looks like- yep, the lights are starting to flicker off. I think it\u2019s shutting down! Even the kid seems to be waking up. Hah! We did it! Hey, kid, how in the hell- Seth McArthur : Wait! Wait oh fuck wait I need to- Xi-5-3|Banks : Whoa- whoa kid! Back away from the panel! The high-pitched noise grows extremely loud. The sound of Xi-5-3 chambering a round in her gun is heard. Xi-5-3|Banks : Back away right now. Do not turn that fucking machine back on. Seth McArthur : I\u2019m not! You don't understand! I have to- oh, god, fuck, fuck! The whine becomes overpowering. Garbled, panicked voices are barely audible. Site-9 : Squad? 5-1, do you copy? Adamson, Banks, do you copy!? The noise suddenly stops. Full radio silence for 6 seconds. Seth McArthur : Whew, okay\u2026 I think that got it. I just needed to re-balance the-\u2026 I just-\u2026 oh\u2026 ohhhh. Xi-5-3|Banks : What? What is it? Seth McArthur : I\u2026 just figured out where all the energy goes. A large explosion is heard. The signal cuts out.",
