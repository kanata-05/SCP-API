The distance of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from Earth and the conditions on the planet itself render any breach of containment of active instances of SCP-1124 unlikely; these entities have been observed to be exclusively terrestrial. A repeat of the lander incident at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Air Force Base is unlikely as no more than one lander and shuttle was stationed at ILYENA at the time of the outbreak. Research drones have revealed that the since missing shuttle is currently eroding on the planet surface.\n\n\nSamples of SCP-1124 have been transferred to warehouse compound 1124Xa as per recommendation by Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Researcher Sanders, Dr. Herman, and Dr. Smith have been given special clearance to access the samples at their own discretion with the conditions that update logs and proof of inactivity or reactivation are immediately placed on record. Indefinite surveillance of these researchers is enacted as a precaution. With the exception to the ILYENA incident no instances of SCP-1124 have been activated save for SCP-1124-C.\n\n\nThe housing compound is located 70km underground outside of Site \u2588\u2588, and is equipped with a failsafe nuclear device should emergency protocol fail. Individual instances of SCP-1124 are encased in airtight, soundproof, heatproof, 1\u00a0m x 1\u00a0m x 1\u00a0m steel \u201cblast safes\u201d.\n\n\nIsolated instances of SCP-1124 are kept individually in steel stores with equipped motion and heat sensing equipment. No more than one instance of SCP-1124 is to be tested at any given time. Testing is to be done with approval from each of the three aforementioned personnel, Site Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and O5 directorate approval. It is recommended drones instead be sent to ILYENA for research.\n\n\nShould defensive systems within the testing chambers fail, the chamber is to be immediately sealed, filled with triflic acid, and incinerated. Any researchers present inside of the testing chamber are to remain there during the termination protocol.\n\n\nEfforts are being taken to destroy SCP-1124-C before it matures, although with current results this seems unlikely. The progeny itself is contained in a 3\u00a0m x 3\u00a0m x 3\u00a0m containment unit with acid-proof titanium sheeting. The container should be completely submerged and re-cycled with triflic acid at all times. The unit itself is to be lined monthly with extra titanium sheeting to replace dissolved or destroyed sheeting. This maintenance process should be completed within a span of 40 (forty) minutes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1124 are metallic objects found near research base ILYENA on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The first instances of SCP-1124 were recovered from canisters underneath [DATA EXPUNGED] mountain range.\n\n\nEntities contained by the canisters have the appearance of cephalopods, weighing exactly 1.0268\u00a0kg.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-1124 are impervious to heat and pressure. Each is otherwise non-responsive to external stimuli save for physical contact with biological matter, which will cause instances of SCP-1124 to activate and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Reaction to biological matter originating from a sapient creature tends to elicit a more violent response.\n\n\nThough observations are performed daily through a viewing window in tank 1124-C by monitoring cameras, a definite shape cannot be substantiated. The most recent appearance appears similar to a larval grub. SCP-1124-C is in all instances metallic in appearance.\n\n\nThe entity frequently gnaws and consumes the casing in its containment unit, although the amount of damage taken is acceptable due to the density and thinness of the film used to line the chamber. Further research into containment is deemed necessary as the creature has been shown to grow in minor increments when more material is consumed.\n\n\nA tear located in Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's body suit during transfer allowed [DATA EXPUNGED] activating 1 (one) instance of SCP-1124. Security cameras show the entity quickly gnawing itself out from the inside of its alloy casing and then launching itself into the mouth of one Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. This method of mobility is believed to be a spring like motion using its appendages but this is still unconfirmed. Following containment procedures Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 sealed himself inside unit 1124-C and activated the failsafe mechanism, effectively containing SCP-1124-C.\n\n\nSee incident report 1124: Personnel Termination Dossier.\n\n\nReference SCP-1124 Transmitted Data and Video Transcript-c for further details.\n\n\nx-23c ILYENA [6555-x23] Lander: Transmitted Data:\n\n\n\n\n13:31:45:\n\n\nSanders\n: Dr. Sanders, audio log A20, reporting successful mission.

[6555-x23] was obtained by the organization after being alerted of the circumstances of its arrival by General \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. [6555-x23] arrived with no passengers and loaded past carrying capacity with instances of SCP-1124 in their original canisters. Attempts to contact Theta or the station have since been unsuccessful.

Researchers remotely operating the drone attempt to communicate with the entity. As a result of this verbal stimulus the entity charges toward the drone and finally communication with x-23e ceases. No further data could be obtained.\n\n\n[DATA INVALIDATED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilers Note - Addendum-d\n\nInstances of SCP-1124's progeny that express low heat signature vary slightly in appearance but share some characteristics including metallic angular features and segmented limbs.\n\n\nEntities with higher heat signatures appear less angular and are not segmented. Some bodily features are similar to animals that were previously housed on site, although these influences seem to be primarily reptilian.\n\n\nTemperatures on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 range from -208 to -223 \u00baC and surface gravity is roughly 44.88\u00a0m/s^2. Life support systems at ILYENA are not functional. Gravity stabilization generators inside ILYENA are also non-functioning. The atmosphere of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 would corrode most Earth metals. These entities do not require air and are composed of currently unclassified organic material and metals.\n\n\nTesting is requested on earth housed samples to confirm whether environmental factors affect the abilities SCP-1124 as testing on active samples at ILYENA is limited due to aforementioned conditions at ILYENA and the limitations of the research drones.\n\n\nVideo Recording 1124C area:\n\n\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enters area 1124C carrying container with one instance of SCP-1124.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 loses balance. A tear is shown on closer inspection near the researcher's leg. A negligible amount of blood is spilled on the casing.\n\n\nThe casing begins to move around and slide along the floor.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 places two hands on the casing, effectively stopping it from moving.\n\n\nA small hole appears on the casing surface. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 places one hand over the hole and quickly recoils in pain.\n\n\nA figure matching typical appearance of SCP-1124-1 emerges from the hole slightly, pausing for roughly 3s.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 remains still and continues looking at SCP-1124.\n\n\nSCP-1124 retreats into the hole.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 produces emergency film from a storage closet near unit 1124-C and leans over the box to begin applying it to the casing.\n\n\nSCP-1124 shoots out of its casing into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 mouth.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to panic, runs into cell 1124-C and begins punching a button linking to the failsafe.\n\n\nDoors to unit 1124-C lock and the chamber begins filling with triflic acid and mist.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s head appears to \u2018inflate\u2019 slightly. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 collapses. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s skull appears through cracks in the skin on the head. Blood beginning to drain from cranial orifices.\n\n\nAt this point filming is obscured by acid all but completely filling the tank. The sound of a metallic screeching can be heard, followed by a dull thud and a sound \"similar to a balloon popping\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\u00a0Documentation\n\n\n\n\nRelated\u00a0Documentation\n\n\n\n\nShort History of ILYENA, Project Tantalus, and the Grey Dragon Incident\n\n\nILYENA, or Site-x19 was established for conducting research and experimentation deemed too risky for planet-side operations. Due to its location on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, ILYENA was a low risk solution and conveniently dispensable. The atmosphere on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 rendered any containment breach irrelevant, and allowed for quick termination.\n\n\nAfter decades of research and failed termination attempts, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 became docile. During this 30 year \u201cgrace period\u201d, absolutely no research or testing was devoted into the nature or genesis of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 was re-designated as Euclid although there was no change in containment procedure.\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s highly unusual, docile behavior was almost inexplicable at the time. This period of general quiet surrounding SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 began shortly after the Foundation's involvement in Sector \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The Foundation\u2019s extraterrestrial involvement was a response to civilian developmental breakthroughs resulting from the discovery of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 equation, and the subsequent colonization of Sector \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 once again became active when pods containing the SCP-1124 canisters landed at [DATA EXPUNGED] Air Force Base in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, NV on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588. The resulting destruction of Site-\u2588\u2588 and the continent of [DATA EXPUNGED] is known as the \u201cGrey Dragon Incident\u201d.\n\n\nWhen pods arrived at [DATA EXPUNGED] Air Force base, alarms in block \u2588 of Site-\u2588\u2588 sounded as a result of thermal and kinetic changes in the containment cell of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. D-Class personnel on assignment guarding SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported movement in the containment cell. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 broke containment shortly after, ignoring site personnel and heading directly toward the ILYENA lander coordinates.\n\n\nAn alert was sent to General \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The General ordered a battalion of soldiers outfitted with [DATA EXPUNGED] to intercept SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 on route to the lander. This resulted in \u2588\u2588\u2588 casualties. Mobile Task Forces Alpha-2 and Delta-5, each carrying single Alpha pods of SCP-1124, were intercepted and destroyed by SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Foundation losses were extreme. It was later revealed by Mobile Task Force Iota-5 after returning the lot of SCP-1124 that protocol was broken and these pods were given to the other groups as a diversionary measure. It is not known what became of the pods used for the diversion.\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 went uncontained for \u2588\u2588 years. The continent of [INFORMATION OMITTED] inhospitable, marking the most severe breach in Foundation history. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 was finally lured into a new containment cell using an inactive SCP-1124.\n\n\nDuring the operation to intercept SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s containment cell was refit and housed 70km underground in a previously decommissioned facility. Walls were surrounded with pools of triflic acid and containment procedures were established on site. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's containment, and Mobile Task Force Iota-5\u2019s return and immediate termination marked the conclusion of the Grey Dragon incident.\n\n\nProject Tantalus began in the summer of 20\u2588\u2588 following the string of incidents caused by the containment breach of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s correlation with SCP-1124 was revealed through its actions. The project consists of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's relocation to a new research facility in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for a new series of termination attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated SCP Objects:\n \nSCP-682\n \"Hard-To-Destroy Reptile\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1123\n | SCP-1124 | \nSCP-1125\n \u00bb",

        "Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enters area 1124C carrying container with one instance of SCP-1124. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 loses balance. A tear is shown on closer inspection near the researcher's leg. A negligible amount of blood is spilled on the casing. The casing begins to move around and slide along the floor. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 places two hands on the casing, effectively stopping it from moving. A small hole appears on the casing surface. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 places one hand over the hole and quickly recoils in pain. A figure matching typical appearance of SCP-1124-1 emerges from the hole slightly, pausing for roughly 3s. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 remains still and continues looking at SCP-1124. SCP-1124 retreats into the hole. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 produces emergency film from a storage closet near unit 1124-C and leans over the box to begin applying it to the casing. SCP-1124 shoots out of its casing into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 mouth. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appears to panic, runs into cell 1124-C and begins punching a button linking to the failsafe. Doors to unit 1124-C lock and the chamber begins filling with triflic acid and mist. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s head appears to \u2018inflate\u2019 slightly. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 collapses. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s skull appears through cracks in the skin on the head. Blood beginning to drain from cranial orifices. At this point filming is obscured by acid all but completely filling the tank. The sound of a metallic screeching can be heard, followed by a dull thud and a sound \"similar to a balloon popping\"."

The distance of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from Earth and the conditions on the planet itself render any breach of containment of active instances of SCP-1124 unlikely; these entities have been observed to be exclusively terrestrial. A repeat of the lander incident at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Air Force Base is unlikely as no more than one lander and shuttle was stationed at ILYENA at the time of the outbreak. Research drones have revealed that the since missing shuttle is currently eroding on the planet surface.",
