While knowledge of SCP-3001 is available to personnel of any level should they wish to learn about it, research and experimentation with SCP-3001 and its associated technology is strictly limited to personnel of Level 3 and above, with special clearance designation granted from Sites 120, 121, 124, and 133.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3001 is a hypothesized paradoxical parallel/pocket \"non-dimension\" accessible through the creation of a momentary Class-C \"Broken Entry\" Wormhole.\n1\n While believed to be an infinitely extending parallel universe, SCP-3001 is almost completely devoid of any matter and has an extremely low Hume Level of 0.032,\n2\n contradicting Kejel's Laws of Reality with the relation between Humes and spacetime. This phenomenon causes matter inside it to decay at an extremely low rate, and damage that would otherwise prove fatal does not impede any biological/electronic function; simulations suggest an organism can lose more than 70% of their body's tissue and still operate normally, as long as at least 40% of the brain remains. However, prolonged exposure will cause said matter to gradually approach SCP-3001's own Hume Level, resulting in severe tissue/structural damage as the matter's own Hume Field begins to disintegrate.\n\n\nSCP-3001 was initially discovered on January 2, 2000, at Site-120, a facility dedicated to testing and containing reality-bending technology. Dr. Robert Scranton and his wife Dr. Anna Lang were Head Researchers at Site-120, and were developing an experimental device, called the \"Lang-Scranton Stabilizer\" (LSS).\n3\n Dr. Scranton was transported to SCP-3001 after unexpected seismic activity damaged several active LSS in Site-120 Reality Lab A.\n\n\nInitially presumed dead, Dr. Scranton has survived in SCP-3001 for at least five years, 11 months, and 21 days. During this time, he was able to record his experiences and observations within SCP-3001 through a somehow still functioning LSS control panel, which was also brought into SCP-3001 with him through the Class-C \"Broken Entry\" Wormhole. These recordings were later recovered upon the panel's sudden return, an unexpected side effect from testing improved reality-bending technology; these logs are the basis of SCP-3001 study. Despite new technologies being developed, retrieval and re-integration of Dr. Scranton has been unsuccessful. His current physical and mental states, if he is still alive, are unknown. \n[Further information on Dr. Scranton's possible retrieval is under Ethics Committee review.]\n Transcripts of Dr. Scranton's logs are below.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access,\u00a0File:\u00a0Scranton\u00a0SCP-3001\u00a0logs,\u00a0Section\u00a01.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[No discernible/coherent dialogue can be heard from Dr. Scranton for the first eight days. He cycles through periods of panic, confusion, and anger throughout, and it seems he was attempting to navigate SCP-3001 to find a way out. He finally moved close enough to the recording log on the eleventh day, though did not notice it was operating for several more hours.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName, Robert Scranton.

Yeah, yeah, my name, is Robert Scranton, former researcher at Foundation Site-120. It has been\u2026 I don't know, actually, I\u2026 I can't remember. I\u2026 I estimate it's been ten days, but, I-I-I don't, I can't\u2026 Oh God, can anyone hear me?! I-I-I don't know what's happened, I-I don't know where I am, and-and, please, please is anyone there?! Hello?! Anyone?! ANYONE?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can hear me. Oh God, oh God, oh God. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hell is this thing even working, it can't be working, it SHOULDN'T be working, so what the hell?! I need to \u2014 God, I need to, I need to\u2026 see, how\u2026 long can I talk here, I think there's a-a-a cap or something on the recording log, and I-I-I can't see anything, I can only see the red light blinking on and off, I can't see any of the switches next to it\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm really hungry.\n\n\nThirsty, too. I think I should be dead from dehydration by now, but\u2026 I don't know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, little red light. Can you talk to me? Can you talk to\u2026 Anna, for me? Hello?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found the controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks, three days, forty-seven hours, and fifty-eight minutes\n.\n\n\nTwo weeks, three days, forty-seven hours, and fifty-eight minutes.\n\n\nTwo weeks, three days, seven hours, and fifty-eight minutes.\n\n\nTwo weeks, three days, seven hours, and fifty-eight minutes.\n\n\nOh\u2026 Jesus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR WITH PLAYBACK, ERROR WITH PLAYBACK. ERROR WITH PLAYBACK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever the hell I am, I'm pretty sure now that\u2026 I don't need to eat to stay alive. It hurts\u2026 a lot, but\u2026 at this point I don't think I'm gonna die\u2026 So\u2026 I'm gonna\u2026 I'm gonna take my time\u2026 I guess. I\u2026 Maybe some sort of miracle will happen and I'll get out. Heh. Keep dreaming, Robert. Yeah, I'm\u2026 I'm tired, I'm gonna sleep.\n\n\nThree weeks, four days, nineteen hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a picture of Anna in my pocket. I almost forgot. Little red light, let me see her face, please? Just a little bit, I just\u2026 I just want to see her a bit.\n\n\nHi, Anna, I'm still here, I'm still here. I'm coming back, okay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months, four days, three hours.\n\n\n\u2026 Hi. Robert here. Yeah, I-I haven't really recorded much to hear in the past few weeks. Ha. Hahahaha\u2026 Hahaha\u2026 huh\u2026 huh\u2026\n\n\nSorry, gotta keep it together. Breathe.\n\n\nI've been\u2026 I've been busy. Trying to learn more about the place I'm in. My prison. My kingdom all my own. Heh, King Robert. God, I stink. Is there even air in this goddamn place? Stinky King Robert, king of GODDAMN NOTHING FUCK.\n\n\n\u2026Sorry, sorry. I, I gotta keep this professional. I'll\u2026 I'll come back when I'm feeling rested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 Okay, here goes. \n[Inhales then exhales deeply.]\n\n\nMy name is\u2026 Robert Scranton. I am a former Head Researcher of Site\u2026 120, a Foundation facility dedicated to studying various reality-bending SCPs, for the purpose of developing more advanced countermeasures towards such threats.\n\n\nFor the last\u2026 red light, speak to me,\n\n\nTwo months, eight days, sixteen hours.\n\n\nWhat red light said. I have been trapped in what I believe to be an empty pocket dimension. Alone. Yeah\u2026 alone. All alone.\n\n\nI'm calling this place SCP\u2026 I don't know, I can't remember where we are, screw it. I don't know what's happened in the past\u2026 red light, please, again.\n\n\nTwo months, eight days, sixteen hours.\n\n\nBut\u2026 no one else is around to argue, and at this point\u2026 I'm just talking into this control panel to keep myself together. I\u2026 I need to keep a record. There might be some poor bastard in the future who ends up like me, and\u2026 if this ever actually makes it out\u2026 maybe, maybe I can help stop that from happening. That's all I have going for me right now, and I \nreally\n need something to go for, hahahaha\u2026\n\n\n\u2026So, yeah, Robert\u2026 Scranton\u2026 documenting a new SCP for\u2026 future research purposes. That'll have to do. Here we go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access,\u00a0File:\u00a0Scranton\u00a0SCP-3001\u00a0logs,\u00a0Section\u00a02.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nTwo months, eleven days, ten hours.\n\n\nItem number, SCP I don't fucking care.\n\n\nObject Class, Euclid, I guess, but I don't know, I might update this in time. I need to explore more.\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures, god I sound so much like a shrink right now\u2026 Um\u2026 I don't know if we could\u2026 contain wherever I am. It's\u2026 definitely not on Earth. To be honest I don't know where it is. I\u2026 I think it has do something with the Stabilizer prototype\u2026 I'll explain that more later. Okay\u2026 um\u2026 yeah, wherever I am, I don't think it can be contained much as\u2026 created. No, no, that's not the word I'm looking for. Um\u2026 entered. Yeah, entered is better. I came into this place because of some really bad reality-bending accident and\u2026 no, no, Robert, don't be like that yet, you don't know if there's no exit yet. Ooooh\u2026 livin' on a prayer\u2026 halfway\u2026 there. Ahem.\n\n\nTwo months, eleven days, eighteen hours.\n\n\nSo\u2026 wait, no, Description, Robert, stick to the format\u2026 This place\u2026 It's some sort of reality gap, I think. It's dark. Really dark. As in, this little red light that shows my words are actually being recorded is the only visible light in this entire place. I can't see my hands, and I can barely see the control panel here. I've had to basically use the light as a center, and remember how many steps I take and in which direction. I haven't gone past a hundred yet. I'm too\u2026 I'm too scared to. Heh. I wonder if my hair is turning white, right now? I can't even see what color it is anymore. Speaking of which, my head has been a bit itchy recently. If I don't concentrate on it, it's fine, but I feel this\u2026 tingling all over my face. I'm not sure why.\n\n\nTwo months, fifteen days, four hours.\n\n\nOkay\u2026 hoooo\u2026 I-I need to relax for a minute, Jesus, god, shit. Holy\u2026 shit, shit, shit\u2026 I\u2026 just discovered a new property of this place. All this time, I've been thinking I might be walking on\u2026 some sort of\u2026 flat ground, if you will. I kept eye contact with little red as far as I could see, and it seems I could walk in a straight, flat path. Jesus, my head is buzzing right now, I think the adrenaline is still kicking\u2026 But, if my hypothesis is correct, and this really is some sort of reality\u2026 void, then there shouldn't be anything to walk on. Now that I think about, the whole time I've been in here, it's felt like\u2026 I'm walking, but I'm also swimming through something. And this something is thick, and form-fitting, it has this\u2026 pressure, which I know isn't the correct term, but goddamn it, this place makes \nno damn sense\n and I'm doing my best to understand it, okay?!\n\n\nGod\u2026 Sorry.\n\n\nSo, the best analogy I can come up with is\u2026 it's like I'm walking through really thick black gel. There's enough tension to keep me on a\u2026 \"surface\", but if I\u2026 imagine myself pressing down hard enough, I can descend. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think\u2026 I think I need to test this more, I'll be back.\n\n\nTwo months, seventeen days, two hours.\n\n\nNavigation is largely affected by\u2026 conscious impulses to travel in a certain direction. So, this definitely isn't a complete reality gap, at least according to mine and Anna's theories. If-if it \nwere\n I wouldn't have been able to move at all, since space wouldn't \nhave existed\n. Holy shit, okay, okay, this makes a lot more sense than it did before, great, \ngreat\n job, Robert, you're getting there. \u2026Come to think of it, I should've realized that sooner when I was able to move in a flat plane to and from little red. It also explains why I'm not dead from dehydration or hunger yet, time barely passes in here. Okay yeah, so, I stood right next to little red, and went straight\u2026 \"down.\" Okay, from here on out, imagine little red as the origin of a 3D space. I went straight\u2026 down, right, yeah, and then\u2026 and then I was then able to come back \"up\" to little red again. I've also been able to \"fly\" above red. Movement in here is slow, like I said, gel analogy, best I can describe it by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months, twenty-two-days, three hours.\n\n\nReporting back for another update, red, SIR! Hahaha, come on red, lighten up. Ha! Pun not intended\u2026 Come on red, crack a little smile, it's funny!\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026 Fine, whatever. Ahem.\n\n\nThis place still seems like it \nbarely\n follows Kejel's Laws of Reality Parameters. And by barely, I mean, really just \nbarely\n. I'm pretty sure my math is right, but\u2026 hold on, I'm gonna check again\u2026\n\n\nJesus. Yeah, yeah, pretty sure it's good still. Okay, this place\u2026 if we're using the standard Hume scale, I'm pretty sure I'm in a reality where the Hume Field is\u2026 point zero\u2026 four\u2026 ish. Yeah, really, really, \nreally\n fucking low, so\u2026 Like I said above, space-time exists on a very minuscule scale, so my biology is not getting shot to hell and back because of any malnutrition, but that also means\u2026 I\u2026 I'm actually not sure what that also means\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nAdding on from the last entry. I'm\u2026 I'm not sure how my biology will react in such a low Hume concentration, actually. I mostly worked with higher than average Hume Fields, and the reality benders we tested never had a Field lower than 0.8. This\u2026 this is gonna be a first. An all-time first. I remember Site-133's \"Prommel Killer\", they called it that because it broke the previous theory about the lowest limit of Hume concentration. Really expensive, really weird machine that brought down a small area to 0.4. 0.05 is\u2026 yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was lying. I was lying, last log\u2026 I\u2026 I'm lying to myself. My own body, and\u2026 little red here too\u2026 We're about the realest things in this place. And that means\u2026 over time\u2026 the Hume field's going to want to\u2026 equalize, and\u2026 I'm\u2026 I'm gonna go for now, I have some\u2026 some calculation to do again. Red, Anna, take note I'm using Kejel's Second, Third, and Fourth Laws, got it? Use\u2026 use 0.05 as the surrounding, my external field as\u2026 somewhere in between 1 and 1.4, use the Second Law's error estimation correction, and my internal as\u2026 as\u2026 as\u2026 shit. I'm not done yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am real. I am super-real. Super duper real. Ultra real, the realest guy in a world of no-real.\n\n\nYou have no sense of humor as usual, red. I'm talking about the LSS, red. When we got sent here, I think\u2026 I think our reality got cranked up a notch. Red, didn't you pay attention in class? Hey, don't get fucking smart with me, red. Okay, the \npoint\n is, the LSS surge got us up to\u2026 to\u2026\n\n\nTwo months, eighteen days, seven hours.\n\n\nNo, red, not even fucking close, you must've converted Kejel's Third Law equation wrong. Because of the malfunctioning LSS we got blasted by, we're somewhere in between 2.2 and 3.6. \nYes\n, that's good red, that's very good, because that means we have more time than we thought to\u2026 to\u2026 yes, red, before we fucking DIE, okay?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months, twenty four days, five hours.\n\n\nAbout three years. Four, if\u2026 If I don't interact too much. If\u2026 If I had had an LSS here, I could maybe stretch it out to\u2026 eight, maybe, that's best case scenario\u2026 But I have\u2026 I have to\u2026 I\u2026 know\u2026 but\u2026 but\u2026 three years. Three years, then it's past the point of no return. Ha. Hahahahaha. I should\u2026 I should definitely figure something out by then. I think I still should be pretty good for a while\u2026 At least\u2026 no, no, I won't be in here that long\u2026 I'll definitely figure something out\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna, what would we do with a case like this? I need your help, honey. That\u2026 that tingling I've been feeling\u2026 That's my Hume Field diffusing\u2026 My\u2026 my reality fading\u2026 Three years. I need to stabilize myself within three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been thinking\u2026 Anna and I, we had this theory\u2026 Even though the Hume Field is low, it's still a Hume Field. And precisely since it's so low, Hume diffusion should take quite a while. Now if\u2026 if I could\u2026 contain\u2026 recycle the fields, keep the diffusion from spreading too thin, I could\u2026 And I could also maybe\u2026 it's only a theory, but\u2026 It's worth a shot. But that means\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, red. I\u2026 I'm gonna have to go for a bit. I want to test something, and you can't come with me. I\u2026 I'm sorry. No, no, red, I'm really, \nreally\n sorry, I want you to come, I do, but\u2026 if we're together the diffusion will increase faster\u2026 We both need as much time as possible. I need to figure this place out more, and \nyou\n need to make sure you keep all that info in your head. It's\u2026 red, come on. You- you'll be fine red, I know you will, you're tough. A lot tougher than me\u2026 it'll only be for a bit, red, but I need to see if I can find a way to keep us alive a bit longer. Maybe even get us out of here. If I can contain enough field, I can\u2026 I can maybe even get us out. No, \nno\n I'm not sure, but I need to find out. Red, we're talking about possibly escaping, okay? Yeah, it's a gap. A gap should have an end, like a\u2026 like the walls of a canyon, understand? I need to find a wall, and then, and then I can\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI'm sorry, red, I hope we're still friends when I come back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI'm\u2026 I'm going now\u2026 I'll see you soon.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access,\u00a0File:\u00a0Scranton\u00a0SCP-3001\u00a0logs,\u00a0Section\u00a03.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix months, ten days, five hours.\n\n\nHello again, little red.

        "\u2026 Okay, here goes. [Inhales then exhales deeply.] My name is\u2026 Robert Scranton. I am a former Head Researcher of Site\u2026 120, a Foundation facility dedicated to studying various reality-bending SCPs, for the purpose of developing more advanced countermeasures towards such threats. For the last\u2026 red light, speak to me, Two months, eight days, sixteen hours. What red light said. I have been trapped in what I believe to be an empty pocket dimension. Alone. Yeah\u2026 alone. All alone. I'm calling this place SCP\u2026 I don't know, I can't remember where we are, screw it. I don't know what's happened in the past\u2026 red light, please, again. Two months, eight days, sixteen hours. But\u2026 no one else is around to argue, and at this point\u2026 I'm just talking into this control panel to keep myself together. I\u2026 I need to keep a record. There might be some poor bastard in the future who ends up like me, and\u2026 if this ever actually makes it out\u2026 maybe, maybe I can help stop that from happening. That's all I have going for me right now, and I really need something to go for, hahahaha\u2026 \u2026So, yeah, Robert\u2026 Scranton\u2026 documenting a new SCP for\u2026 future research purposes. That'll have to do. Here we go!",
        "\u2026 Two months, eleven days, ten hours. Item number, SCP I don't fucking care. Object Class, Euclid, I guess, but I don't know, I might update this in time. I need to explore more. Special Containment Procedures, god I sound so much like a shrink right now\u2026 Um\u2026 I don't know if we could\u2026 contain wherever I am. It's\u2026 definitely not on Earth. To be honest I don't know where it is. I\u2026 I think it has do something with the Stabilizer prototype\u2026 I'll explain that more later. Okay\u2026 um\u2026 yeah, wherever I am, I don't think it can be contained much as\u2026 created. No, no, that's not the word I'm looking for. Um\u2026 entered. Yeah, entered is better. I came into this place because of some really bad reality-bending accident and\u2026 no, no, Robert, don't be like that yet, you don't know if there's no exit yet. Ooooh\u2026 livin' on a prayer\u2026 halfway\u2026 there. Ahem. Two months, eleven days, eighteen hours. So\u2026 wait, no, Description, Robert, stick to the format\u2026 This place\u2026 It's some sort of reality gap, I think. It's dark. Really dark. As in, this little red light that shows my words are actually being recorded is the only visible light in this entire place. I can't see my hands, and I can barely see the control panel here. I've had to basically use the light as a center, and remember how many steps I take and in which direction. I haven't gone past a hundred yet. I'm too\u2026 I'm too scared to. Heh. I wonder if my hair is turning white, right now? I can't even see what color it is anymore. Speaking of which, my head has been a bit itchy recently. If I don't concentrate on it, it's fine, but I feel this\u2026 tingling all over my face. I'm not sure why. Two months, fifteen days, four hours. Okay\u2026 hoooo\u2026 I-I need to relax for a minute, Jesus, god, shit. Holy\u2026 shit, shit, shit\u2026 I\u2026 just discovered a new property of this place. All this time, I've been thinking I might be walking on\u2026 some sort of\u2026 flat ground, if you will. I kept eye contact with little red as far as I could see, and it seems I could walk in a straight, flat path. Jesus, my head is buzzing right now, I think the adrenaline is still kicking\u2026 But, if my hypothesis is correct, and this really is some sort of reality\u2026 void, then there shouldn't be anything to walk on. Now that I think about, the whole time I've been in here, it's felt like\u2026 I'm walking, but I'm also swimming through something. And this something is thick, and form-fitting, it has this\u2026 pressure, which I know isn't the correct term, but goddamn it, this place makes no damn sense and I'm doing my best to understand it, okay?! God\u2026 Sorry. So, the best analogy I can come up with is\u2026 it's like I'm walking through really thick black gel. There's enough tension to keep me on a\u2026 \"surface\", but if I\u2026 imagine myself pressing down hard enough, I can descend. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think\u2026 I think I need to test this more, I'll be back. Two months, seventeen days, two hours. Navigation is largely affected by\u2026 conscious impulses to travel in a certain direction. So, this definitely isn't a complete reality gap, at least according to mine and Anna's theories. If-if it were I wouldn't have been able to move at all, since space wouldn't have existed . Holy shit, okay, okay, this makes a lot more sense than it did before, great, great job, Robert, you're getting there. \u2026Come to think of it, I should've realized that sooner when I was able to move in a flat plane to and from little red. It also explains why I'm not dead from dehydration or hunger yet, time barely passes in here. Okay yeah, so, I stood right next to little red, and went straight\u2026 \"down.\" Okay, from here on out, imagine little red as the origin of a 3D space. I went straight\u2026 down, right, yeah, and then\u2026 and then I was then able to come back \"up\" to little red again. I've also been able to \"fly\" above red. Movement in here is slow, like I said, gel analogy, best I can describe it by.",
        "Two months, twenty-two-days, three hours. Reporting back for another update, red, SIR! Hahaha, come on red, lighten up. Ha! Pun not intended\u2026 Come on red, crack a little smile, it's funny! \u2026 \u2026 Fine, whatever. Ahem. This place still seems like it barely follows Kejel's Laws of Reality Parameters. And by barely, I mean, really just barely . I'm pretty sure my math is right, but\u2026 hold on, I'm gonna check again\u2026 Jesus. Yeah, yeah, pretty sure it's good still. Okay, this place\u2026 if we're using the standard Hume scale, I'm pretty sure I'm in a reality where the Hume Field is\u2026 point zero\u2026 four\u2026 ish. Yeah, really, really, really fucking low, so\u2026 Like I said above, space-time exists on a very minuscule scale, so my biology is not getting shot to hell and back because of any malnutrition, but that also means\u2026 I\u2026 I'm actually not sure what that also means\u2026",
        "\u2026 Adding on from the last entry. I'm\u2026 I'm not sure how my biology will react in such a low Hume concentration, actually. I mostly worked with higher than average Hume Fields, and the reality benders we tested never had a Field lower than 0.8. This\u2026 this is gonna be a first. An all-time first. I remember Site-133's \"Prommel Killer\", they called it that because it broke the previous theory about the lowest limit of Hume concentration. Really expensive, really weird machine that brought down a small area to 0.4. 0.05 is\u2026 yeah.",
        "I was lying. I was lying, last log\u2026 I\u2026 I'm lying to myself. My own body, and\u2026 little red here too\u2026 We're about the realest things in this place. And that means\u2026 over time\u2026 the Hume field's going to want to\u2026 equalize, and\u2026 I'm\u2026 I'm gonna go for now, I have some\u2026 some calculation to do again. Red, Anna, take note I'm using Kejel's Second, Third, and Fourth Laws, got it? Use\u2026 use 0.05 as the surrounding, my external field as\u2026 somewhere in between 1 and 1.4, use the Second Law's error estimation correction, and my internal as\u2026 as\u2026 as\u2026 shit. I'm not done yet.",
        "I am real. I am super-real. Super duper real. Ultra real, the realest guy in a world of no-real. You have no sense of humor as usual, red. I'm talking about the LSS, red. When we got sent here, I think\u2026 I think our reality got cranked up a notch. Red, didn't you pay attention in class? Hey, don't get fucking smart with me, red. Okay, the point is, the LSS surge got us up to\u2026 to\u2026 Two months, eighteen days, seven hours. No, red, not even fucking close, you must've converted Kejel's Third Law equation wrong. Because of the malfunctioning LSS we got blasted by, we're somewhere in between 2.2 and 3.6. Yes , that's good red, that's very good, because that means we have more time than we thought to\u2026 to\u2026 yes, red, before we fucking DIE, okay?!",
        "Two months, twenty four days, five hours. About three years. Four, if\u2026 If I don't interact too much. If\u2026 If I had had an LSS here, I could maybe stretch it out to\u2026 eight, maybe, that's best case scenario\u2026 But I have\u2026 I have to\u2026 I\u2026 know\u2026 but\u2026 but\u2026 three years. Three years, then it's past the point of no return. Ha. Hahahahaha. I should\u2026 I should definitely figure something out by then. I think I still should be pretty good for a while\u2026 At least\u2026 no, no, I won't be in here that long\u2026 I'll definitely figure something out\u2026",
        "Anna, what would we do with a case like this? I need your help, honey. That\u2026 that tingling I've been feeling\u2026 That's my Hume Field diffusing\u2026 My\u2026 my reality fading\u2026 Three years. I need to stabilize myself within three years.",
        "I've been thinking\u2026 Anna and I, we had this theory\u2026 Even though the Hume Field is low, it's still a Hume Field. And precisely since it's so low, Hume diffusion should take quite a while. Now if\u2026 if I could\u2026 contain\u2026 recycle the fields, keep the diffusion from spreading too thin, I could\u2026 And I could also maybe\u2026 it's only a theory, but\u2026 It's worth a shot. But that means\u2026",
        "Hey, red. I\u2026 I'm gonna have to go for a bit. I want to test something, and you can't come with me. I\u2026 I'm sorry. No, no, red, I'm really, really sorry, I want you to come, I do, but\u2026 if we're together the diffusion will increase faster\u2026 We both need as much time as possible. I need to figure this place out more, and you need to make sure you keep all that info in your head. It's\u2026 red, come on. You- you'll be fine red, I know you will, you're tough. A lot tougher than me\u2026 it'll only be for a bit, red, but I need to see if I can find a way to keep us alive a bit longer. Maybe even get us out of here. If I can contain enough field, I can\u2026 I can maybe even get us out. No, no I'm not sure, but I need to find out. Red, we're talking about possibly escaping, okay? Yeah, it's a gap. A gap should have an end, like a\u2026 like the walls of a canyon, understand? I need to find a wall, and then, and then I can\u2026 \u2026 I'm sorry, red, I hope we're still friends when I come back.",

This phenomenon causes matter inside it to decay at an extremely low rate, and damage that would otherwise prove fatal does not impede any biological/electronic function; simulations suggest an organism can lose more than 70% of their body's tissue and still operate normally, as long as at least 40% of the brain remains. However, prolonged exposure will cause said matter to gradually approach SCP-3001's own Hume Level, resulting in severe tissue/structural damage as the matter's own Hume Field begins to disintegrate.",
