Once a week subject is allowed one hour in the small courtyard at the center of Building 11, under the supervision of one guard. Once a year subject is allowed one new photograph each of Patricia Nixon, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower. All privileges are contingent on good behavior, and may be rescinded at any time by Project Head/2736. Subject\u2019s health should be monitored closely, as it has a history of phlebitis.\n\n\nSCP-2736-2 is uncontained at present. Long-term surveillance is to be maintained, with successful infiltration of its inner circle remaining a Class-IV Priority.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n Special Containment Procedures for SCP-2736 were discontinued on 23/04/1994.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2736 consists of two biologically-identical adult males, SCP-2736-1 and SCP-2736-2; as far as can be ascertained, both are former U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. They are the result of a little-understood event designated \u201cIncident Janus-2736\u201d, which resulted in a hitherto non-anomalous Richard M. Nixon being \u201csplit\u201d into two distinct individuals through unknown, anomalous means. SCP-2736-1 and SCP-2736-2 appear to share the entirety of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s memories up to Incident Janus-2736, at which point each individual developed a distinct consciousness; however, this cannot be conclusively verified due to the unavailability of SCP-2736-2 for study.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1 has been in Foundation custody since Incident Janus-2736, allowing its existence to remain concealed from the public. Despite having been produced through anomalous means, SCP-2736-1 displays no anomalous properties save for sharing a Level-II causal relationship (physical, mental) with SCP-2736-2 (see Addenda 3, 5). Heavy scarring is present on subject\u2019s chest, the result of injuries sustained during Incident Janus-2736.\n\n\nSCP-2736-2 is the individual known to the world as Richard M. Nixon, having served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 to 1974. Due to SCP-2736-2\u2019s high status and visibility, as well as the protection and continued interference of GoI-113 with Foundation efforts at recovery, SCP-2736-2 remains uncontainable at present.\n2\n\n\nRecovery\n: On 21/06/1951, Undercover Task Force Theta-3-3 (\u201cFederal Reserves\u201d) conducted a covert surveillance mission at the private campground known as Bohemian Grove, in Monte Rio, CA.\n3\n Theta-3-3 agents embedded in the campground\u2019s security force observed a summer solstice celebration attended by members of GoI-113, which culminated in Incident Janus-2736.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Document\u00a02736-V-0001\u00a0[Level\u00a04/Eyes\u00a0Only]\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm Log Transcript 2736-01 \u2013 Surveillance Mission [113]-V-779\n\n\nDate:\n 21/06/1951\n\n\nTime:\n 22:48 PST \u2013 23:27 PST\n\n\nLocation:\n Bohemian Grove (LoI-729)\n\n\nTask Force:\n Theta-3-3 (DEEP COVER)\n\n\nNote:\n The original film log was compiled from footage covertly shot by Theta-3-3 agents using two concealed, hand-held cameras. Camera-1 was situated at the back of the crowd, with a view of the entire clearing; Camera-2 was situated near the front of the crowd, with a relatively close view of the proceedings. Footage is in black and white.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n<00:01>\n Camera-1 shows a large clearing surrounded by giant redwoods. It is nighttime. At the center of the clearing stands a dilapidated 10m-tall stone statue depicting a ram\u2019s head. At the foot of the statue a large bonfire is burning; aside from some wooden torches carried by attendees, this is the only source of light. Several meters from the fire, a deep rectangular hole has been dug into the ground, and the removed earth piled next to it. The camera pans over a crowd, showing roughly 500 people in attendance. All are wearing dark robes with the hoods drawn.\n\n\n<07:28>\n (Camera-1) The crowd parts as a group of fourteen men arrive in the clearing and make their way toward the fire. All of them are dressed in robes.\n\n\n<07:40>\n (Camera-2) The group walks past the camera. All men are wearing masks, save for one, whose face is visible. [Examination of the still frames reveals the man to be Richard M. Nixon, to be henceforth referred to as \u201cR.N.\u201d He appears nervous and afraid.]\n\n\n<07:52>\n (Camera-2) R.N. is escorted to the front of the crowd and made to stop at the foot of the statue. A high-backed wooden chair, similar in appearance to a throne, is brought beside him. Some of the men around R.N. remove his robe, leaving him naked.\n\n\n<08:30>\n (Camera-2) R.N. is made to sit down on the wooden chair, to which his wrists and ankles are strapped. A noose is placed around his neck, and a crudely-made crown placed on his head. [The noose appears to serve a symbolic purpose, as it is not attached to a supporting beam. The crown appears to have been fashioned from shards of bone.]\n\n\n<11:13>\n (Camera-2) Twelve of the masked men position themselves around R.N. Each one produces a knife from inside his robe. The thirteenth man, who will henceforth be referred to as \u201cSpeaker\u201d, turns toward the crowd.\n\n\nSpeaker:\n Tonight marks the dawn of the New Age.\n\n\n(\nApplause and cheers from the crowd.\n)\n\n\nSpeaker:\n Tonight we witness the Birth of the First.\n\n\n(\nMore cheering.\n)\n\n\n<12:05>\n (Camera-2) One of the masked men, who will henceforth be referred to as \u201cMasked Man-1\u201d, approaches R.N.\n\n\n(\nCrowd becomes silent.\n)\n\n\n<12:52>\n (Camera-2) Masked Man-1 raises his knife to R.N.\u2019s face.\n\n\n(\nScreams of pain from R.N.\n)\n\n\n<13:20>\n (Camera-2) Masked Man-1 faces the crowd and raises his arm high above his head. He is holding a small object in his hand, from which blood appears to be dripping.\n\n\nSpeaker:\n We offer his left eye to the Fire, that the King may always see.\n\n\n<13:33>\n (Camera-2) Masked Man-1 throws the small object into the bonfire.\n\n\n<13:49>\n (Camera-2) Another masked man, who will henceforth be referred to as \u201cMasked Man-2\u201d, approaches R.N. with his knife raised and takes hold of his jaw with his free hand.\n\n\n(\nR.N. is heard screaming in pain; after several seconds a gurgling sound is heard.\n)\n\n\nSpeaker:\n We throw his tongue into the Flames, that the King may never betray himself.\n\n\n<14:42>\n (Camera-2) Masked Man-2 throws a small object into the bonfire.\n\n\n<15:10>\n (Camera-2) The remaining masked men, to be henceforth referred to as \u201cMasked Men-3 to -12\u201d, line up at R.N.\u2019s side and take turns cutting at his hands with their knives.\n\n\n(\nSustained screams of pain by R.N.\n)\n\n\nSpeaker:\n We cast his fingers into the Furnace, that the King\u2019s grip may never weaken.\n\n\n<16:31>\n (Camera-2) Masked Men-3 to -12 each throw a small object into the bonfire.\n\n\n<17:19>\n (Camera-2) R.N. is now bleeding profusely from the injuries sustained to his face and hands. Several of the masked men remove him from the chair and carry him over to the nearby hole, into which he is lowered.\n\n\n<18:44>\n (Camera-2) Several of the masked men take shovels and begin burying R.N. alive.\n\n\nSpeaker:\n We give his body to the Pit, that the Eternal Depths may grind it to dust, rending chaff from wheat.\n\n\n<21:25>\n (Camera-2) The masked men finish burying R.N. alive.\n\n\n(\nApplause and cheering from the crowd.\n)\n\n\n<21:42>\n (Camera-1) Two identical straw effigies, each measuring roughly 3m in height, are brought from the edge of the clearing to the foot of the statue, and propped up over the bonfire.\n\n\n<22:14>\n (Camera-2) The effigies begin to burn.\n\n\n(\nThe crowd is silent.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill frame from Camera-1, at <25:16>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<24:38>\n (Camera-1) As the effigies continue to burn, they start producing sparks, flashes of light and small, fireworks-like explosions. [It is not known whether explosives had previously been placed inside the effigies, or if these phenomena have an anomalous cause.]\n\n\n<29:01>\n (Camera-2) The effigies crumble as they finish burning. [Here, Theta-3-3 agents reported that the bonfire flames turned a deep red and appeared to grow darker, though this is not properly visible on the black-and-white film.]\n\n\n(\nA low sound reminiscent of stone grinding against stone becomes audible; the sound, of unknown origin, is heard throughout the clearing for several minutes, steadily growing in volume.\n)\n\n\n<35:05>\n (Camera-2) The two effigies have been completely reduced to ashes. [Here, Theta-3-3 agents reported that the bonfire flames regained their usual color and brightness.]\n\n\n(\nThe grinding sound gradually fades away. The crowd is silent.\n)\n\n\nSpeaker:\n The First will be reborn.\n\n\n<37:49>\n (Camera-2) View of the filled-in hole where R.N. is buried. The earth over the hole begins to shift, as though something were moving under the surface.\n\n\n<38:01>\n (Camera-2) Two hands emerge from the ground, and a naked man pulls himself out of the hole before collapsing in exhaustion on the ground. [Examination of still frames show that the man is Richard M. Nixon, although none of the injuries inflicted by the masked men are visible on his body. This individual will henceforth be referred to as SCP-2736-2.]\n\n\n<38:09>\n (Camera-2) Speaker approaches SCP-2736-2 and helps it to stand up.\n\n\n<38:15>\n (Camera-2) A second naked man pulls himself out of the hole. [Examination of still frames reveals the man is also Richard M. Nixon; again, none of the injuries inflicted by the masked men are visible on his body. This individual will henceforth be referred to as SCP-2736-1.]\n\n\n<38:43>\n (Camera-2) Speaker appears to address SCP-2736-2 before handing it a knife.\n\n\n<38:51>\n (Camera-2) SCP-2736-2 takes hold of the knife and turns toward SCP-2736-1. SCP-2736-1 attempts to stand up, but before it is able to SCP-2736-2 jumps on top of it and attempts to stab it with the knife. The two men struggle, with SCP-2736-1 sustaining a number of deep lacerations to its chest.\n\n\n<39:30>\n (Camera-2) SCP-2736-1 takes hold of a rock on the ground beside it and strikes SCP-2736-2 on the side of the head with it. SCP-2736-2 falls back, stunned. SCP-2736-1, bleeding from its injuries, stands up and flees from the crowd.\n\n\n<39:41>\n (Camera-1) View of SCP-2736-1 running toward the trees. Several of the masked men, as well as men from the crowd, start running after it.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, taking advantage of the general confusion, Theta-3-3 Commander William Meeks instructed Theta-3-3 agents to attempt to recover SCP-2736-1 and extract it from Bohemian Grove. It was thought that SCP-2736-1 might prove amenable to the Foundation given GoI-113\u2019s treatment of it, as well as provide valuable information regarding GoI-113 and LoI-729. The extraction was successful, though three Theta-3-3 agents were killed in the ensuing firefight with Bohemian Grove\u2019s security force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its extraction from Bohemian Grove, SCP-2736-1 was taken to Site-109, where its injuries were treated.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Document\u00a02736-V-0009\u00a0[Level\u00a04/Eyes\u00a0Only]\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 2736-001\n\n\nDate:\n 22/06/1951\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-109, Infirmary C\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Commander William Meeks (MTF Theta-3-3)\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2736-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nW.M.:\n I\u2019d like to ask you some questions, if you\u2019re feeling up to it.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n All right. I suppose I owe you boys that much.\n\n\nW.M.:\n Thank you. For the record, could you please state your name, age and occupation.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Richard Nixon, 38. I\u2019m a U.S. Senator.\n\n\nW.M.:\n How did you first become involved with Bohemian Grove?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n About uh, a year ago I was introduced to some people at a dinner. Real big-wigs. We got to talking, and they said I should come to the Grove for a weekend.\n\n\nW.M.:\n So you went.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Some people would kill for an invitation like that.\n\n\nW.M.:\n What happened when you were there?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Nothing much, that first time. They mostly showed me around. Beautiful place, all that forest, those redwoods\u2026 Old, \nreal\n old. We spent most of the time at one of the lodges, drinking, smoking. We talked.\n\n\nW.M.:\n What about?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Well, uh\u2026 me, actually. They seemed real interested in me, kept asking what I wanted out of life, what my plans for the future were. At one point I mentioned my career wasn\u2019t going as great as I thought it could. They told me maybe they could help.\n\n\nW.M.:\n Help, in what way?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n They didn\u2019t exactly say then, they just told me I should start coming to the Grove regularly, meet some more people. Wasn\u2019t long I was spending at least one weekend a month there, sometimes more. The people they had there, I tell you\u2026 Seemed like everyone who mattered was a member. Congressmen, governors, you name it. People with \nreal\n power, too, bankers, defense contractor presidents, oil magnates. And these men I\u2019d never even heard of, but you could tell how important they were just by the way the millionaires and billionaires looked at them. Like they were scared of them. After just a few months there I\u2019d made more political contacts than I had in my entire career up to that point. All of a sudden I had all these prospects.\n\n\nW.M.:\n So how did you wind up \nhere\n?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n (\nsighs\n) This one night I was invited to a ceremony. They said it was a club tradition, so I didn\u2019t question it when they gave me a robe to wear. We had to walk to this place in the forest called the Ram Shrine. Hundreds of us, all walking in the dark with torches. Took us almost an hour. Then we reached this open area with a statue of a ram\u2019s head, and the ceremony started. Real macabre stuff. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if I was meant to take it seriously, but then I\u2026 \nsaw\n\u2026 things. That\u2019s when I realized who I was dealing with, what those people were capable of achieving. When we got back to the lodge that night they made me a member. Wasn\u2019t long after that they offered to make me King.\n\n\nW.M.:\n Make you \nKing\n?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n They said we were entering a new era for mankind, but before that could happen four great Kings would have to rise to prepare the way. They said they\u2019d been looking for someone like me for a long time, someone to be the \nfirst\n King. They told me the whole world could be mine, all I had to do was say yes.\n\n\nW.M.:\n You accepted.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n (\npauses\n) Yes. And then last night they brought me back to the Ram Shrine and\u2026 well, you were there, you saw it. They\u2019d warned me it wasn\u2019t going to be pleasant, I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize it would be that bad. But they said all they\u2019d be doing to me would be for a reason. That before I could be the First I had to be reborn.\n\n\nW.M.:\n When they put you in the earth you remained buried for over fifteen minutes. Do you remember anything that happened during that time?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Not much. I think I was in shock from the blood loss, and when they started shoveling earth on me I thought that was it. I suffocated, and everything went black, but I didn\u2019t die, though. I had these\u2026 I guess I\u2019d call them dreams, except I can\u2019t remember what they were about. But there was someone else with me in the dreams, some\u2026 man. He was in the dark, couldn\u2019t see his face. He said something about stars, I\u2026 I think I was crying. Then I woke up, still in that hole, only I wasn\u2019t hurt anymore. I panicked, started clawing my way out. That\u2019s when I felt something move against me. It was \nhim\n. By the time I got out of the hole he was already standing there. The masked man gave him a knife, told him to cut out my heart and, uh\u2026 well, you know the rest. I didn\u2019t think I had it in me, knocking him out like that. Must have been my Navy training kicking in\u2026\n\n\nW.M.:\n And that dream you had, you said\u2013\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Listen, I\u2019m really tired, and I need to call my wife, tell her where I am. Do think you could arrange that?\n\n\nW.M.:\n I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be possible.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Document\u00a02736-V-0010\u00a0[Level\u00a04/Eyes\u00a0Only]\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 2736-002\n\n\nDate:\n 23/06/1951\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-109, Infirmary C\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Commander William Meeks (MTF Theta-3-3)\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2736-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n I told you, I\u2019m not saying anything else to you until you let me talk to my wife!\n\n\nW.M.:\n I lost three men getting you out of that place, not to mention an entire surveillance network that\u2019s taken us \ndecades\n to establish.

How have things been for you, though? Can\u2019t have been easy watching all of this unfold.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n It wasn\u2019t, watching him do that to my name, to this country, to\u2026 to Pat and the girls. They're even saying his marriage is on the rocks, did you hear that? Not that I\u2019m complaining, mind you, but I just keep thinking of Pat, about what she must be going through. At least he resigned, though, there's that. It\u2019s over now.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Yes, his political career certainly seems to be over\u2026 Actually, I was hoping to get your thoughts on something.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n All right.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Now, before the ritual at Bohemian Grove that began all this, you said your friends had told you the world would be yours if you became King.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n That\u2019s right.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Then how do you account for the events of the last few months? SCP-2736-2 becoming embroiled in a nationwide scandal, losing all his political capital, being forced to resign in disgrace? And it\u2019s not just the last months, is it? From the start it\u2019s never \nreally\n gone his way. First time he ran for president in 1960 he lost to Kennedy. Then Kennedy winds up dead not long after, and a few years later SCP-2736-2 \ndoes\n become president, but even then\u2026 the Vietnam War, the bombing of Cambodia, all terribly unpopular things that ultimately result in failure. And finally the Watergate scandal. We\u2019re far from the success your friends at the Grove promised you, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Yes, that's true.\n\n\nS.B.:\n I\u2019d like to know why you think that is. Is it possible the promises were all a lie?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n I really doubt that. I mean, it \nwas\n in their best interest to put me in power and uh, keep me there.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Then do you think they simply weren\u2019t \ncapable\n of delivering on their promises? That maybe they were never as powerful as you were led to believe?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n No, not a chance. I know for a fact they were capable of everything they promised me. More, probably.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Then\u2026 why? Why all the setbacks? Why this latest failure?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Well, my \u201cfriends\u201d from the Grove, as you call them, they haven\u2019t been idle all these years, have they?\n\n\nS.B.:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n I mean, they\u2019ve been looking for me since that night at the Grove. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\n\n\nS.B.:\n I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not cleared to discuss this with you.\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n I understand that. But I\u2019m not blind, I know there\u2019s a reason you transferred me to this place.\n4\n Why else would I need all this security? I\u2019m not dangerous, this isn\u2019t for \nme\n. I think my \u201cfriends\u201d were looking for me back then, and they still are today. I think all this time they never stopped.\n\n\nS.B.:\n Well, let\u2019s\u2026 let\u2019s say for a moment that were true. Why do you think that would be? Why would they keep dedicating so much time and effort to finding you?\n\n\nSCP-2736-1:\n Because the ritual was never finished. When you guys rescued me at the Grove, you threw a \nbig\n wrench in their plans. Didn\u2019t even realize it, but you did. That\u2019s why it\u2019s all gone to hell for them, for \nhim\n.
