On the first of every month, the full text of SCP-3163 is to be recorded and correlated with current astronomical and meteorological data, as observed from central Pennsylvania. SCP-3163 is to be monitored on a daily basis for unexpected edits or updates, and any such deviations are to be appended to its monthly record.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3163 is a hardbound book, entitled \"GLATTFELDER\u2019S NEW NORTHTON ALMANACK.\" SCP-3163 displays significant signs of wear and use, the most prominent of which are overlapping stains on the rear cover, identified as coffee, beer, and blood. While the anomalous nature of SCP-3163 precludes precise dating of its year of publication, chemical and historical analyses of the book indicate that SCP-3163 was manufactured in late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century America.\n\n\nThe interior and cover texts of SCP-3163 are mutable, though they consistently maintain the semantic structure of a farmer\u2019s almanac. The interior text updates itself on the first day of the month, and while the title text itself never changes, the year indicated by the subheading increments by one every January 1st. As of 01/01/2017, the subheading reads \"TRUE AND USEFUL PREDICTIONS FOR THE YEAR OF OUR LORDE\u2019S ASCENSION, TWO-HUNDRED AND NINETY-FOUR.\"\n\n\nThe first page of SCP-3163 takes the form of a short message, addressed to \"My Dearest Acolytes and Friends\" and signed by \"Henry Ian Glattfelder.\" There are no records of a Henry Ian Glattfelder residing in the United States of America, living or deceased. \nThe text of the message, reproduced in full in Research Log 3163-A, has remained constant through each update.\n The text of the message was observed to change into its current configuration on 09/01/2017. Research Log 3163-A has been updated to reflect this anomaly.\n\n\nThere are no records of a town or county named New Northton in the United States of America, though astronomical and meteorological predictions within SCP-3163 indicate that New Northton should be \nlocated in central Pennsylvania\n. However, while the timing of real-world eclipses, planetary transits, and lunar cycles are consistent with the text of SCP-3163, the item contains additional references to \"Nix, the Void-Star of Our Lorde.\" According to SCP-3163, Nix should occupy a solar orbit between Saturn and Uranus. No such object has been detected by historical or modern astronomical surveys.\n\n\nThough the monthly horoscopes given by SCP-3163 usually offer the mundane platitudes and suggestions typical of the genre, some unusual entries have been noted. A sample of such entries is listed below, in Research Log 3163-B.\n\n\nAs of 09/25/2017, Foundation astronomers and meteorologists have pinpointed the hypothetical location of New Northton to within a 3000 square kilometer area. \nMobile Task Force \u2588 is prepped to explore this area and, if possible, infiltrate New Northton in late October, 2017.\n\n\nFollowing loss of contact with Mobile Task Force \u2588, Mobile Task Force \u2588\u2588\u2588 is to be deployed for reconnaissance and armed intervention to the coordinates provided by Mobile Task Force \u2588 prior to their disappearance.\n\n\nFollowing loss of contact with Mobile Task Force \u2588\u2588\u2588, the O5 Council initiated Protocol Tipsy Eagle. The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been alerted through back-channels to the presence of large weapon stockpiles in the suspected area of New Northton, and Mobile Task Force \u2588\u2588 will be deployed for non-combat cleanup operations following Federal intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Research\u00a0Log\u00a03163-A:\u00a0Introductory\u00a0text\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Research\u00a0Log\u00a03163-A:\u00a0Introductory\u00a0text\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory text of SCP-3163, pre-09/01/2017\n\n\n\n\nMy Dearest Acolytes and Friends,\n\n\nAs the Lorde of Nocturne did bestowe the Wisdome of Ages unto Me, so too do I bestowe unto You, Citizens of New Northton, this modest Almanack. The astronomical Calculations and Predictions contained herein shall aid You in the Upkeep of your Farms, ensure the Prosperity of your Shoppes, and guide You in the Businesses of Family, Commerce, and Worship.\n\n\nThose who have kept the Faithe of Our Lorde of Nocturne alive and well into the Modern Worlde are, indeed, bless\u00e8d in His Sight. Good Citizens of New Northton, my Friends and Students in the Way of Our Lorde, I beseech You to hold that Faithe dear in your Hearts, for then surely You will prosper and flourish in the World that is to come. Though we know not the Daye of His Arrival, the Void-Star grows ever brighter Night after Night, a sure Sign of His burgeoning Immanence. Praise Him, Worship Him, and guide your Neighbors in such Activities befitting of His Glory.\n\n\nWith the aide of this holy Book, whose Text is inspired in Me direct from the Light of the Void-Star, New Northton has been a prosperous Township since its Founding in the First Year of Our Lorde. As we are now a goode and respectable Beacon of Faithe on this blasphemous Earth, we shall be raised unto the Greatest Glory of Our Lorde when he returns from the deepest Reaches of the Void. Truly, as His Children, we are the most fortunate little Towne in all of America.\n\n\nYour Neighbor, your Mayor, and your highest Priest of the Lorde of Nocturne,\n\nHenry Ian Glattfelder\n\n\n\n\nUpdated introductory text of SCP-3163, as of 09/01/2017\n\n\n\n\nMy Dearest Acolytes and Friends,\n\n\nCatastrophie has befallen our Towne! The Lorde of Nocturne, in His great Wisdome, has informed Me that there is a most dastardly Spye with a Copy of our holy Almanack.

The United States of America, though ignorant of the Will of our Lorde, has seen fit to enshrine the Right of Arms unto us all. It is time to take Advantage of that Right, and prepare to fight Tooth and Naile when the Heretics arrive to stamp out the Faithe of Our Lorde of Nocturne. Do not fear! Bless\u00e8d under the Holy Light of Nix, the Void-Star vun Haerrnacht, we shall be as the great Founders of our Towne, who drove off the Heathen Indians from our land with our fierce Resistance.\n\n\nAnd to you, creatures of Blasphemy who spye upon our modest Worship, I give you this warning: Do not meddle with the Affairs of the humble Towne of New Northton, for we will fight to the last Man, Woman, and Child to defend the Faithe of our Lorde of Nocturne.
