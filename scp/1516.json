SCP-1516 is to be provided with written words referring to food and nourishment. Under no circumstances is SCP-1516 allowed to interact with written words describing harmful and/or dangerous concepts that may cause damage to the vicinity or the subject itself, or text/inscription based anomalies, including \nSCP-1672\n, \nSCP-1889\n, \nSCP-2140\n. As per request, SCP-1516 has been allowed to possess an audiobook copy of the Bible.\n1\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1516 is a living typographical illustration of a human being measuring 1.9 meters in height and 78 kilograms in weight. SCP-1516 has a semi-variable appearance and is composed of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 typeface letters and words. Each part of SCP-1516's anatomy is composed of the Spanish word deformed to fit the shape of that part of the body. SCP-1516's anatomy is always labeled with the simplest possible term for the body part. When viewed from a closer perspective, SCP-1516's form will slowly change its shape to the terms for that part of the subject's body (i.e: its legs would be a deformed \"leg\" word, and arms, chest, face, etc will follow this pattern). This effect continues down to the subcellular level. When examined by electron microscopy nuclei isolated from SCP-1516 are full linked A's, T's, C's, and G's linked by the word \"sugar\". While SCP-1516 is aware of this aspect, it appears to be unable to control it in any way.\n\n\nWhen SCP-1516 performs any action that would produce a sound,\n2\n it will produce written words and/or onomatopoeias from the source of the sound instead, floating on the air for approximately 5-10 seconds before suddenly vanishing. It is of note that digital audio recorders can register them as sounds,\n3\n but cameras and other visual recorders may register a visual image of them.\n\n\nWhenever SCP-1516 enters in direct contact with a single noun written on any suitable surface, said word will detach itself from the paper and will deform to fit a tridimensional and functional object depicting the previous concept of the word (hereby called SCP-1516-1). Instances of SCP-1516-1 share the same physical characteristics with SCP-1516 itself. SCP-1516 is capable of controlling this ability, but is bounded by SCP-1516's knowledge and understanding of the word, and how complex the concept is. For a full list of SCP-1516's abilities, see test log-1516.\n\n\nTest log-1516:\n The following is a list of the experiments conducted to test SCP-1516's effect on different words at varying situations:\n\n\nWord:\n \"Sof\u00e1\" (couch)\n\n\nResult:\n Upon contact, the word suddenly detached itself, grew in size and deformed to form a tridimensional couch.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Cama\" (bed)\n\n\nResult:\n Similar results as per previous test.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Tel\u00e9fono\" (phone)\n\n\nResult:\n Upon contact, the word stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed that it doesn't know how a phone works.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Tomate\" (tomato), \"lechuga\" (lettuce) and \"cebolla\" (onion).\n\n\nResult:\n As expected, all the words were effectively turned into SCP-1516-1 instances. Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 used a standard kitchen knife to prepare a simple salad. When mixed together, they shifted into \"ensalada\" (salad). When allowed to consume the salad, SCP-1516 was capable of identifying all involved ingredients.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Vase\"\n\n\nResult:\n No change. SCP-1516 has claimed not to know what the word means.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Vase\". This time, SCP-1516 has been taught about the meaning of the word.\n\n\nResult:\n Upon contact, the word changed in the usual way.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Perro\" (dog)\n\n\nResult:\n Upon contact, the sample shifted as expected. When inspected, it did not show any life signs.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Papel\" (paper)\n\n\nResult:\n The sample stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed the word \"paper\" is immune to its effect.\n\n\nWord:\n \"Una silla rota\" (a broken chair)\n\n\nResult:\n No change. SCP-1516 has claimed it cannot affect anything beyond an isolated\n4\n word at once.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-1516 was discovered on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Venezuela. Following several reports of a \"man made of letters\" living in an abandoned house on the mountain. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the situation. SCP-1516 offered no resistance to capture. Witnesses were interviewed and treated with A-class amnestics. Forty-seven (47) instances of SCP-1516-1 were found on the vicinity and confiscated.\n\n\nInterview log:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1516.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Vasquez.\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n First interview following SCP-1516's capture. Translated from original Spanish. Subject appears to be calm and willing to cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nVasquez:\n Please state your name and nature.\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n I am Palabra Quintero. Nothing but a man in this universe.\n\n\nVasquez:\n I see. How long do you remember being in your current state?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n I've been like this since I was born. Dad took care of me since I was a child.\n\n\nVasquez:\n Where is your father right now? Was he like you?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n I don't know. He told me one day his job was done and let me on my own. And no, he was more like you. At least, our creator is always watching us, so I never felt truly alone.\n\n\nVasquez:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n I mean we are being observed. They watch over us most of the time. Constantly reading our actions in this universe.\n\n\nVasquez:\n Who is this creator?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n He is God. Or should I say they are God? It doesn't really matter, because God is always reading us.\n\n\nVasquez:\n Do you mean watching us?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n Well, it's all a matter of perspective. In my eyes, and in their eyes, we are just all the same thing.\n\n\nVasquez:\n I see. Any additional information regarding your father?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n He was a lovely man, but he had problems focusing in a single subject. Nothing more to say.\n\n\nVasquez:\n Now, what can you tell about the objects we found on your residence?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n Those are words I took from some children books my dad gave to me some years ago.\n\n\nVasquez:\n When you say you take them, do you mean physically remove a word from the paper?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n More or less. It's like grabbing an object from a bag. Although some words are really heavy to lift.\n\n\nVasquez:\n What is the\u2026 Most heavy word you ever tried to manifest?\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n I tried a tree once. It just didn't move at all.\n\n\nVasquez:\n I think that's enough information for now. We will move you to a new residence soon.\n\n\nSCP-1516:\n May God bless your tales, brother.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-1516 hasn't given any additional information regarding its \"father\" or its \"creator\". Further investigations on these matters are pending.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n At \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 SCP-1516 was approved to receive English classes 3 times a week. Due to the apparent lack of difference between oral and written communication, the subject showed a remarkable advance during courses. 10 weeks after the classes started, SCP-1516's body presented an irregularity when several body samples showed 12% of the total mass to be written in regular English. English course was suspended and several tests were run on SCP-1516's body. SCP-1516 expressed no physical discomfort for this event and requested to continue its English classes. After several discussions, SCP-1516 was allowed to continue its classes. At week 14 body mass changed into English had been increased to 20% and confirmed that English transmutation was directly proportional to SCP-1516's English skills. At week 37, SCP-1516 reached perfect use of English language and English transmutation stopped at 48% of its body mass. No objective secondary effects were visible, but a slight change in SCP-1516's personality has been noted connected to the language it uses to communicate.\n5\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. King James edition.\n\n\n2\n. Included but not limited to: speaking, walking, and interacting with its surroundings.\n\n\n3\n. SCP-1516's voice is consistent with a male human in his mid-twenties.\n\n\n4\n. A word written in an individual sheet or paper of at least 3x3cms.\n\n\n5\n. It appears to be more extroverted when using English language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1515\n | SCP-1516 | \nSCP-1517\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1516\n\" by FaustoV, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
