Personnel are to maintain all professional standards set forth by the Wendy\u2019s corporation. Night-shift guards are to be equipped with gas masks and broad-spectrum UV lights.\n\n\nThe freezer is to remain padlocked.\n\n\nEmployees are encouraged to ignore all sounds emanating from within.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2915 is a Wendy\u2019s franchise restaurant located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ohio. The establishment possesses two primary anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\nThe menu at the time of containment did not align with normal Wendy\u2019s products, appropriate health standards, or typical terrestrial biochemistry. All salvageable foodstuffs were removed from the premises for controlled laboratory study.\n\n\nThe freezer does not possess a floor. The depth of the resulting shaft is unknown \u2013 probing missions have proven inconclusive. Six winch systems are attached to the ceiling of the freezer, each consisting of a chain and large meathook. These winches are controlled by a series of valves located at the door. One chain remains lowered into the shaft.\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to reach the bottom of the freezer shaft have been unsuccessful \u2013 the longest-surviving probe broadcast for over four months before communication was lost. Adjusting the height of chains has not been attempted beyond establishing the use of the valves.\n\n\nYellow gas of currently-indeterminate chemical makeup will leak from the freezer during nighttime hours, generally between 0200 and 0445. This gas is heavier than air, mildly toxic (long-term exposure will result in damage to the lungs and kidneys), and will dissipate under concentrated ultraviolet radiation.\n\n\nSounds might occasionally be heard emanating from within the freezer, and may include banging within the shaft, the rattling of chains, the scraping of metal on the inside of the door, and distant echoes of \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin\u201d by Frank Sinatra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2914\n | SCP-2915 | \nSCP-2916\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2915\n\" by Djoric, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
