If an individual is found to have been afflicted with SCP-4325, they are to be located and sent to a Foundation quarantine facility, with staff to record the individual's symptoms and to check if SCP-4325 is present in their retina. If the symptom is unique enough to be classed as a variation of SCP-4325, it is to be recorded in Log-4325-A.\n\n\nFoundation front companies are to raise awareness and encourage research of \"visual snow\", as to help distinguish it from SCP-4325's anomalous effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4325 is an anomalous phenomenon and affliction that primarily affects those with the condition known as \"visual snow\", in which the user's vision displays a light amount of 'static', akin to a poorly tuned analogue television [See Log-4325-A for more information regarding symptoms].\n\n\nWhen SCP-4325 has infested and activated within an individual (now designated SCP-4325-1), their vision will begin to be overtaken by static. Within 3 hours of being afflicted, SCP-4325-1's vision will be completely overridden, leading to a complete loss of normal function within the eyes\n1\n. Tests have shown that only the subject's vision is affected, and other senses such as hearing and touch are not normally affected, although those with tinnitus report hearing noise akin to a radio tuned to a non-existent station.\n\n\nIndividuals affected by the main anomalous symptom of SCP-4325 (plain animated static) also report visual hallucinations of seemingly random objects and entities within the static. Analysis of these reports indicate that these hallucinations are caused by SCP-4325-1's mind, and not an anomalous effect of SCP-4325 itself. During physical examinations, symptoms of SCP-4325 have been found within the retina of the subject's eye. To date, every infected individual has displayed this property.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n D-98523\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ellis Darling\n\n\nForeword:\n D-98523 complained of \"bad eyesight\" at approximately 8 am. He then began to yell for personnel at 12:03\u00a0pm, screaming about how his vision has completely decayed.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n So, what exactly do you see, with your\u2026condition?\n\n\nD-98523:\n Don't you know what visual snow is, man? I mean, it's pretty damn obvious.\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n I may be a scientist, but I am not familiar with the condition, no. Can you describe it?\n\n\nD-98523:\n Well, in short, it's like looking through broken eyes. You think it's all normal, you think everyone else has it. But then it starts getting worse, and eventually you can't see anything anymore, except for one thing.\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n What's that one thing?\n\n\nD-98523:\n Static, man. I feel like a broken tv.\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n D-98523 refused to answer more questions.

It's as plain as night and day.\n\n\n(\nMiles holds his head in his hands\n)\n\n\nMiles:\n I\u2026 I can't see colour.\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be now classed as SCP-4325-RW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-C\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Romeo Richards\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ellis Darling\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n You've made quite a number of posts on [REDACTED] about your 'special' condition.

It's here right now\u2026\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n Wait, right now? What does it say, Romeo?\n\n\nRomeo:\n \"No signal.\"\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Shortly after the interview, Romeo's vision went to include colour bars used to test North American analogue televisions.

This unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be classed as SCP-4325-BW. Contrary to other variations of SCP-4325, the manifestation of static and complete vision loss did not occur until approximately 2 weeks after symptoms manifested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-E\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0SCP-4325-E\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Steve Jackson\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ellis Darling\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ellis:\n Hello Mr. Jackson, I'm Ellis.
