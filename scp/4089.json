Although the precise mechanism by which investments profit from this appears coincidental, analysis correlates each tooth consumed with an approximate value of US$250 (US$350 in the case of deciduous teeth).\n1\n\n\nSCP-4089 has several secondary anomalous effects, the most prominent of which is the rapid emergence of secondary and tertiary teeth. New teeth may vary from their predecessors in position, shape, or number.\n\n\nAddendum 4089.1:\n Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/4089/files/podcast05.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2017/07/17\n\n\nNOTE:\n Excerpt from a podcast (\"Kai Sanchez: Positively Rich\").

When you talk about this, tell people about this?\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Oh, yeah.\n\n\nKAI:\n When you \u2014\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Yeah. Yeah, I get that a lot. My friends are always telling me: 'Don't tell them that! Don't let them know. Keep them poor.'\n\n\nKAI:\n Hah!\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Because this is the thing, Kai. This is what the richest people don't want you to know. The poor will always be among us, but so long as you stay hungry? You won't be among them. As long as you're hungry, you'll \nthink\n.\n\n\nKAI:\n Yeah. Yeah, that's really it, isn't it? I think it's amazing how many folks just don't know about this. All you need are some ordinary tools you can get at any hardware store.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n And the right investment plan. We've got a kit, you can purchase it on our website. Has all the tools you need.\n\n\nKAI:\n Link'll be in the description, folks. Tell 'em Kai sent you.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n The kit includes a packet of pure ocean sea-salt. My own choice blend. Once you're done, mix it with a little mineral water, gargle, and spit. It helps the blood clots settle. Gives them a chance to develop.\n\n\nKAI:\n And they grow right back.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Yep.\n\n\nKAI:\n I mean, look at your mouth.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Hell, I've lost cavities.\n\n\nKAI:\n At this rate, you'll put dentistry out of business.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n (\nlaughing\n) We just might.\n\n\nKAI:\n Now, your site includes a kit for kids.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n (\nlaughing\n) Well, it's \u2014\n\n\nKAI:\n And some people, some people get a little squeamish about that?\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n It's more for the parents than the kids. We don't \u2014 we're not saying you should push your kids into this. It's just that, you know, when you're that young, they're coming out anyway, and \u2014\n\n\nKAI:\n Oh, right. Yeah.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n And I mean, this is the real world, you know? You can't afford to be squeamish in the real world. Kids need to learn that. They'll grow back. There's topical anesthetic in the kit. We even offer different flavors. Cherry, grape, whatever.\n\n\nKAI:\n Right, yeah.

It's genetic.\n\n\nKAI:\n That's so hard for people to understand.\n\n\nLUCIEN:\n Yeah. And that's a shame, but y'know, we'll always need people to clean the toilets. For the rest of us?
