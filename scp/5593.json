Below is security footage of that event.\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n(Footage displays the West wing\u2019s Researcher Restroom. A toilet flushes and Dr. Diaz exits a stall, walking over to a sink.)\n\n\n(All four faucets explode from their basins from the force of the water, drenching Dr. Diaz in the process. In reaction, Diaz bangs on the sink while yelling profanities.)\n\n\nEntity:\n HEY, WHAT THE HELL MAN!\n\n\nDiaz:\n Huh \u2014 Hello? Who is this?\n\n\nEntity:\n You just made this even more uncomfortable than it already is with your banging. Calm it down.\n\n\nDiaz:\n Are you the one responsible for the water coming out of the pipes?\n\n\nEntity:\n Probably man, I\u2019m just trying to get out of this joint but people like \nyou\n keep interrupting me.\n\n\nDiaz:\n No, you listen to me asshole, this whole week you\u2019ve been destroying\u2014\n\n\nEntity:\n I\u2019m stuck in here! I\u2019ve been trying to find a way out since ending up in this decrepit hellhole. Thought I was making some progress but I think I was just going back and forth.\n\n\nDiaz:\n \u2026How did you\u2014\n\n\nEntity:\n I didn\u2019t do it in purpose! I just made a wrong turn or something.\n\n\nDiaz:\n You\u2019re aware you\u2019re in Missouri, right? Kansas City, to be exact. Not sure you know where that is\u2026\n\n\nEntity:\n Of course, just my luck I end up with the Italians.\n\n\nDiaz:\n That\u2019s just not \u2014 Wait, if you could ask for help this whole time why didn\u2019t you just\u2026 do that?\n\n\nEntity:\n I get anxiety when I talk to people I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nDiaz:\n \n(Sigh.)\n Just stay put.\n\n\n\n\nThe wall behind the restroom was demolished, revealing no immediately apparent anomalies. The pipes were subsequently unscrewed, causing an explosion of extreme force from within. 68,000 kilograms of viscera and water erupted into the restroom and into the hallway, killing the mechanic team investigating.\n\n\nMedical examination of the organic material revealed the originating organism to be a non-anomalous Blue Whale.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
