Personnel stationed in the surroundings of SCP-2168's instances should avoid approaching the aforementioned area, unless directed otherwise by the Research Team. Foundation operatives are to keep track of the size and population of unaffected towns in order to prevent the emergence of new instances.\n\n\nDue to the self-containing nature of instances of SCP-2168-A and their docility towards the personnel, no special procedure is necessary. Whenever an instance of SCP-2168-A is required for interview or testing, it should be taken from its residence inside SCP-2168 by at least two unarmed members of the personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2168 is a phenomenon occurring in rural towns in the Uruguayan countryside. Areas affected by SCP-2168 will be subjected to a series of anomalous changes to their infrastructure and population, happening through two stages.\n\n\nDuring stage one, populations living in areas under SCP-2168's effects will feel a gradually increasing urge to abandon their homes during a seemingly arbitrary period of time\n1\n. Once this period has passed, regardless of the number of inhabitants left in the area, human-built infrastructure and objects in the area will start to spontaneously collapse. At the same time, the remains will rearrange into a structure reminiscent of a skyscraper, always located in the geographical center of the affected town. Attempts to dismantle these structures have been unsuccessful. Humans who stayed in the area once the structure's construction starts will invariably go missing.\n\n\nThe structure will continue growing in height until all surrounding buildings have been completely destroyed. At this point, the instance will enter into stage two, when several entities, the exact number being depending on the structure's size, start to appear inside the skyscraper. These beings, hereby designated SCP-2168-A, are sapient, pale, genetically identical humanoids of unspecific sex and gender. Instances of SCP-2168-A are extremely docile and display no threat to the personnel, complying with any order given.\n\n\nObservation \nin situ\n of SCP-2168-A has revealed that the entities follow a very strict daily routine, spending an average of ten hours per day sitting near a desk (apparently prevalent in all known instances' habitats) and performing seemingly meaningless tasks, such as reading from blank sheets of papers, connecting and disconnecting USB devices and pressing random buttons on a disconnected keyboard.\n\n\nAddendum 2168-1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0POI\u00a02168:\u00a0Audio\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview POI 2168-5-07: Mr. Rodriguez\n\n\nDate:\n 3/6/1999\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Sebasti\u00e1n Garc\u00eda\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Mr. Juan Rodriguez\n\n\nForeword:\n Mr. Rodriguez is a former resident of [REDACTED], Tacuaremb\u00f3, town currently designated as SCP-2168-5. The exchange has been translated from its original Spanish.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n Thank you for accepting this interview, Mr. Rodriguez.\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n Please, son, call me Peon. Mr. Rodriguez was my father.\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n Okay, Mr. Peon. You lived in the town of [REDACTED], correct?\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n That's right. Lived there my whole life, as everyone in my family since my good old grandfather came from Spain almost a century ago. Nice town, gotta say. Small, quiet, far from all the city noise, ya know? Everybody was polite and friendly with each other and the kids could play outside without fearing a car would run over them.\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n I see. Why did you move from there, then?\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n \n[After five seconds of hesitation]\n Heh\u2026 Well, you may find this unbelievable, young man\u2026\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n I have a pretty open mind, sir.\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n Very well, then. You look like a city boy, so you probably don't understand it, but\u2026 The fields know. It's hard to explain. How the wind blows, how the grass grows. And the animals! The animals always know when something is wrong\u2026\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n Interesting. What made you think something wrong was happening?\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n Everything, son, everything. The cows started to moo in the night, all night long, and stopped producing milk. The dogs were restless, jumpin' here and there, barkin', cryin'. And the chickens, good God, the chickens; they started to climb onto things and jump, over and over again until something breaks. And after all that, I myself started feeling uneasy there. Nausea, headaches, allergies. My gut started to tell me to get the hell out of there, and God forgive me, I did.\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n I understand. Something else you wish to tell me about it?\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n Uh, well\u2026 There was this thing. Everything started when this man with the hat appeared. Polite but very weird. Smelled like smoke, not good old tobacco but like an exhaust pipe of an old car. Came, talked with the \nCapit\u00e1n\n Suarez, invited him for a few shots and then left. The \nCapit\u00e1n\n always liked to talk with strangers, specially city dogs like this guy. No idea who he was, but he made my gut feel the same shit that I felt before I moved.\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n Hmm\u2026 Any idea of who this man was?\n\n\nMr. Rodriguez:\n Didn't give his name. Suspicious, heh? I am pretty sure he was a foreigner, if the accent means anything. I think he may be some kind of white glove criminal or one of those secret agencies' guys!\n\n\nAgent Garc\u00eda:\n Very well. Thank you Mr. Rodrig- I mean, Mr. Peon.\n\n\n<End log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2168-2:\n On 2/4/2001, 2:00 am -3 GMT, a squad of Foundation operatives were deployed to explore the location affected by SCP-2168-7. Exploration of the surroundings of the structure revealed that natural resources including bodies of water, wild animals and vegetation in the affected area were depleting. At this point, operatives were ordered to enter the main building.\n\n\nOperatives crossed the main entrance of the structure without inconvenience and proceeded to explore the building. The structure was discovered to contain only a few rooms inhabited by instances of SCP-2168-A, while several hundreds of other rooms were empty of occupants. All rooms displayed the exact same minimal organization and furniture, containing:\n\n\n\n\nA bed for one person\n\n\nA single plastic desk with a single plastic chair\n\n\nStandard bathroom equipment\n\n\nA prismatic structure resembling a modern refrigerator with several pipes emerging from behind\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to find out more about these entities, Foundation operatives were tasked to take a single instance under custody for studying and interviewing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a02168-A:\u00a0Audio\u00a0logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 2168-A-01\n\n\nDate:\n 2/4/2001\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Daniel Adams\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2168-A-176\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-2168-A-176, seventeenth instance of SCP-2168-A discovered in the area of SCP-2168-7, was taken to a nearby Foundation's facility, two kilometers west from the affected area.

I would like you to answer some questions regarding your residence.\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n M-My cubicle? There is not much to say actually\u2026 I sleep there, and eat there and work there\u2026 I live a simple and productive life.\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n Right.

The\u2026 The ones that\u2026 almost scrape the skies?\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n Yes\u2026 You are saying you never knew where you were?\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n I-I knew where I was. I was inside my cubicle.

My job\u2026 I am productive. I sit at my desk and think ways to be productive\u2026 more efficient. I check how much energy and food I consume and see how much can I reduce it\u2026\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n I see. How do you achieve this, may I ask?\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n Oh, through a lot of ways\u2026 Uh, like eating less. Or using less electricity. Oh! And I thought of a very good one yesterday. Listen, listen. Ready? I sleep as few hours as possible so the bed never breaks! Am I smart or what!

And the room you gave me is very nice too\u2026 though it feels strange not having the Director to talk with me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n I am glad. Now, as we are talking about this \"Director\", could you please tell me about them?\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n Th-The Director? Sure\u2026 He is m-my friend. He is everyone's friend\u2026 He is the bond between the cubicles, between all the workers of the company.

I haven't seen anyone else until\u2026 you appeared, but the Director says there are other employees, so I-I can't tell for sure\u2026\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n I understand. How do you communicate with the Director?\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n I\u2026 He talks to me. Through the walls. Because, he is everywhere you know? Looking after us.

He does that from time to time\u2026 Cutting our food and water supplies, for example\u2026 He always says it is to compensate for what we have not produced, so I have no problem at all with it! Really!\n\n\nDr. Adams:\n I see. Do you know anything else about him?\n\n\nSCP-2168-A-176:\n I-I\u2026 I do-don't know!
