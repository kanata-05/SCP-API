Any personnel accessing SCP-1228 for testing purposes is to be accompanied by at least one Researcher, and must submit to mandatory psychological evaluation afterwards. \n(Access to SCP-1228 outside of testing purposes is now strictly forbidden. See Incident 1228-A for further details.)\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1228 is a website with the domain \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com. Any software used to monitor Internet connections crashes when applied to connections to SCP-1228, so its IP address is unknown. The domain is not registered by anyone, and when usually accessed gives the normal \"DNS lookup failed\" error. However, if viewed by an individual with a history of creative aspirations, SCP-1228 will appear as the page of the viewer\u2019s \u201cOfficial Fan Club.\u201d Although the site\u2019s contents vary from individual to individual, a few pages appear consistently.\n\n\n\n\nWiki:\n Extensive documentation of the subject\u2019s work. Subjects typically claim that the nonexistent titles listed are \u201csomething they\u2019ve always wanted to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews:\n Reports of nonexistent events in the subject\u2019s life. Events reported are invariably of a positive nature, such as the subject winning a major award for their work. Interviews with the subject are often listed here as well, with the subject usually mentioning in the interview that they\u2019re glad they chose to pursue their passion rather than their career path in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForums:\n Discussion of the subject and their work. Posters\u2019 comments are all unanimously positive, praising everything the subject has produced. \nIn order to gather as much information on SCP-1228 as possible, the Foundation strongly encourages test subjects to post on the forums themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStore:\n A store exists for the purchase of merchandise pertaining to the subject's work, such as T-shirts, posters, and figurines. Within \u2588\u2588 hours of making a purchase, an unmarked package will appear at the subject\u2019s address containing the product(s) in question. Attempts to trace the origin of the packages and their products have proven unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\nAfter viewing SCP-1228, test subjects will report feelings of depression, with thirty percent attempting suicide shortly afterwards.\n\n\nIncident 1228-A:\n On 09/17/20\u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the current Researcher presiding over SCP-1228, was reported missing. An aspiring writer in his youth, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had taken to browsing SCP-1228 obsessively.
