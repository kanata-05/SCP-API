Paper and pencil are to be supplied to SCP-2622 upon request. SCP-2622 is to be provided with 300 grams of Dietary Supplement 2622-Alpha, consisting of 25 parts protein paste to 75 parts soil, three times daily. SCP-2622\u2019s chamber is to remain in near-complete darkness unless research access to its cell is desired, in which case the lights may be raised to allow low visibility.\n\n\nSCP-2622 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, and is not considered a major containment breach risk. Any personnel with Level 2 or higher security clearance are permitted to enter SCP-2622\u2019s containment chamber, with no special clearance required.\n\n\nThe personal effects in SCP-2622\u2019s possession upon initial containment are to be contained in a locker in Non-Anomalous Item Storage. Requests by SCP-2622 for these items to be returned are to be summarily denied.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2622 is a roughly humanoid creature approximately 1.80 meters tall and weighing approximately 85 kilograms. Subject is male and of unknown age, but is believed to be in the middle adulthood range due to several physiological indicators, such as greying hair and early-onset rheumatoid arthritis in the hands.\n\n\nSCP-2622 is a member of an unknown sapient species seemingly adapted for subterranean living. Subject\u2019s eyes are approximately fifteen centimeters in diameter and are protected by transparent nictitating membranes, lacking more traditional eyelids. Subject is extremely sensitive to light, experiencing extreme ocular pain in brighter than dim lighting conditions. In addition, SCP-2622\u2019s nose occupies the entire front of the skull and is ringed with twenty-two fleshy appendages. Said appendages are partially prehensile and highly sensitive to touch, as well as audio frequencies, electrical currents, and vibrations within solid substances. SCP-2622\u2019s hands are covered in light grey scales, limiting their touch sensitivity, and its fingers are limited in motion and tipped with 5-centimeter-long claws; as a result, SCP-2622 examines objects primarily via smell and nasal touch. The rest of the subject\u2019s body is covered in fur, primarily dark grey-black in color with aging-induced pigmentation loss on the head, upper back, and shoulders. Subject is typically dressed in Foundation-provided human clothing, with a professed fondness for khaki, aloha shirts, and men\u2019s sun hats.\n\n\nSCP-2622 speaks fluent English with an affected English accent, but denies that its way of speaking is an affectation. Subject claims to be an ambassador-at-large to humankind from a civilization that it calls \u201cthe Terra Interia Empire\u201d. According to SCP-2622, the Terra Interia Empire encompasses over 500 million kilometers of tunnels and caverns within the Earth\u2019s crust, inhabited by animals, plants, and sapient species completely unknown to humankind. Notable inhabitants and landmarks of the Terra Interia Empire, as relayed to Foundation researchers by SCP-2622, include:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cInterians\u201d.\n The species to which SCP-2622 belongs. According to SCP-2622, they are a peaceful race with a highly advanced culture and technological standard.\n\n\n\u201cAnapsidons\u201d.\n A race of sapient reptilian creatures, described by SCP-2622 as violent, aggressive, and warlike. SCP-2622 has given conflicting accounts to interviewers of the Anapsidon\u2019s diplomatic status with the Interians. See Interview Log for further details.\n\n\n\u201cKrystopolis\u201d.\n The capital city of the Terra Interia Empire, located directly beneath the Earth\u2019s magnetic North Pole. Buildings in Krystopolis are supposedly constructed from a green organic crystal that grows into directed shapes.\n\n\n\u201cThe Fire Plain\u201d.\n A cavern located beneath the south-central Pacific Ocean, with nearly constant volcanic activity that prevents plant life growth. The Fire Plain is supposedly inhabited by silicon-based crystalline animals, as well as a sapient species of hunter-gatherers called \u201cthe Rock Men\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cThe Great Underland Sea\u201d.\n A body of water located underneath the approximate center of the continent of Africa, populated by prehistoric sea life ranging from the Devonian to the Cretaceous periods (419 \u2013 65 million years ago) in temporal period of origin, as well as a mysterious sapient species of fishlike humanoids.\n\n\n\u201cThe Savage Country\u201d.\n A cavern of immense size (given by SCP-2622 as \u201ca hundred thousand square miles\u201d [approximately 2.6 million square kilometers] in area) located underneath the island of Greenland in the Arctic Ocean, tropical in climate and supposedly inhabited by dinosaurs.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2622 claims that humankind engaged in frequent diplomatic relations with the Terra Interia Empire hundreds of thousands of years in the past, and that a cataclysmic event \u2013 the nature of which SCP-2622 refuses or is unable to specify \u2013 permanently divided the two cultures. Foundation investigations have so far failed to substantiate any of SCP-2622\u2019s claims.\n\n\nSCP-2622 was discovered wandering the maintenance areas of the London Underground, suffering from mild to moderate malnutrition and dehydration. After recovering while in Foundation custody, SCP-2622 excitedly commented on \u201chow bloody much (humankind had) improved\u201d, and repeatedly related its personal history to all present Foundation medical and research personnel. SCP-2622 claims to have been cut off from the Terra Interia Empire since the aforementioned cataclysmic event, and has repeatedly requested that the Foundation reestablish contact with the Terra Interia Empire and allow it to return home. A complete search of the London Underground by Foundation field agents uncovered nothing of interest save for SCP-2622\u2019s personal effects, detailed in Addendum 2622-1.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following interview was taken on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/2013, ten days after SCP-2622\u2019s initial containment.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Quinan\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2622\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Good morning, SCP-2622.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Ah, finally! Room service! I ordered my p\u00e2t\u00e9 two hours ago! And I don\u2019t know what you just called me, dear boy, but I suggest you address me by my full and proper title!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n There\u2019s no room service here, 2622. I\u2019m here to-\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n No room service? What kind of hotel is this? The service is bloody abominable! See if I ever stay here again!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n This isn\u2019t- I\u2019m here to interview you. I\u2019m here to ask you some questions.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Oh, well\u2026 I suppose the lack of service can be overlooked. This once!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Mm-hm.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n So what would you like to hear, my dear boy?\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n This \u201cTerra Interia Empire\u201d you come from-\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Oh, great Interia! How I long to return to the motherland!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n We\u2019ve been unable to determine any evidence of its existence.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Well, of course you wouldn\u2019t be! Not since the great disaster! I suppose I was the first you\u2019d heard of it.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n That\u2019s correct.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Just as I suspected. Wiped from the cultural memory.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Can you explain how this \u201cgreat disaster\u201d came to pass?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Oh, I wasn\u2019t present at the time, unfortunately. I was in Terra Exteria on a diplomatic excursion, trying to negotiate the first inter-layer trade routes. Oh, if we had only known the terrible fate that would befall our world!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Do you have any idea as to what might have happened?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n I\u2019d bet you a thousand crystal coins it was those dastardly Anapsidons.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Why do you think that?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Always jealous of my people, they were, squatting in their muddy hovels and gazing up at our glorious crystal spires. I suspect they meant to knock us down a peg.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Yesterday you told Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Anapsidons were, quote, \u201cthe most valiant and gentlemanly brothers-in-arms an Interian could ask for\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n You can\u2019t predict those Anapsidons, my dear boy, they\u2019re always up to something.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n I see.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Ever since the Eighth Battle of the Ice Forest, after we turned the tide against them in the Great Interior War, they\u2019ve been out for revenge. It looks to me as though they\u2019ve gotten it.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Were you present at this \u201cBattle of the Ice Forest\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Indeed I was, my dear boy. Slew a dozen Anapsidons myself.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n When did this battle take place?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n [REDACTED]\n1\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n That\u2019s quite impressive.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Thank you. Ah, if only I still had my medals.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Can you tell me a little more about this \u201cIce Forest\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n It\u2019s beautiful there, when not wracked by war. A frozen cavern, a thousand miles wide, deep beneath the land you surface dwellers call \u201cKorea\u201d. Ice crystals the size of cities!\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n I thought that was where the Thorn Wastes were located. That\u2019s what you told Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588 two days ago.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Well, tectonic shifts, you know.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Oh, of course. I think that about wraps it up for now, 2622. Thank you for your time.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Oh, one thing before you go, dear boy.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n Yes?\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n I\u2019d like some materials on which to write my memoirs. It might be a long time before I can return to my homeland. I\u2019d like to tell my story.\n\n\nResearcher Quinan:\n I\u2019m sure that can be arranged.\n\n\nSCP-2622:\n Thank you, my good man.
