Containment procedures should therefore centre on the suppression of public knowledge pertaining to the existence, location and nature of SCP-3655 and the doctoring of satellite and telescopic images of the structure.\n\n\nThe interior of the anomaly should be patrolled on a bi-monthly basis by MTF Epsilon-9, accessed from the nearby Lunar-Area 32 using Foundation lunar-surface vehicular technology. Any changes to the interior of the structure should be noted and investigated immediately.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3655 is an exact replica of Las Vegas\u2019 \u201cThe Mint\u201d Hotel and Casino located on the lunar surface, approximately seven kilometres from Oceanus Procellarum\n1\n: (\u201cOcean of Storms\u201d). Based on physical evidence collected from within the structure, it is probable the duplication of SCP-3655 occurred at some point within the month of December, 1966, although no notable suspicious or anomalous activity was reported by the hotel\u2019s inhabitants during this period. The means behind SCP-3655\u2019s appearance on the lunar surface are currently unknown.\n\n\nInternally, the structure maintains an atmosphere identical to that of Earth, a constant temperature of 21 degrees Celsius and generates or receives water and electricity from an unknown source. However, the interior remains the only area fit for human habitation, as normal lunar conditions resume beyond the outer limits of the structure.\n\n\nOf note is the significant amount of damage sustained by the interior of the structure, most prominently within the foyer area of the hotel and the central gambling hall of the casino. Furniture and equipment lie vandalised throughout, the foyer has sustained a large amount of fire damage and human remains recovered from beneath floorboards suggest the widespread occurrence of violence following SCP-3655\u2019s appearance.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n A potential lunar anomaly was first brought to the Foundation\u2019s attention during the immediate aftermath of NASA\u2019s Apollo-12 mission, when Foundation assets embedded within the agency discovered reports of \u201clunar lights\u201d from Apollo 12\u2019s crew. Further research conducted by the Foundation was later able to verify these claims, with the source being identified as a large, unknown object in close proximity to the Apollo-12 mission site. Despite this knowledge, owing to the limitations of the Foundation\u2019s astronomic capabilities at the time, the duplicated structure was not fully explored and did not receive SCP-classification until\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/76, an estimated ten years following its appearance.\n\n\nUpon Foundation discovery, the remains of some 189 inhabitants of the hotel were found throughout the complex in various states of decay, suggesting the anomalous event that led to the duplication of \u201cThe Mint\u201d similarly affected any guests present within the structure at the exact moment of duplication. However, this number falls far short of the average number of inhabitants within the hotel and casino at any given time in 1966, suggesting that a significant number of these visitors were either spared the effects of the duplication or have not yet been discovered in or around SCP-3655.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03655-1A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\u00a03655-1A\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3655-1A:\n The following are excerpts from a journal recovered from the office of Harrison Garcia within SCP-3655: casino floor manager for \u201cThe Mint\u201d between 1965 and 1976, likely detailing the events within SCP-3655 leading up to and directly following the duplication event. The original Harrison Garcia died of natural causes in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n12/06/66:\n As expected, things have been picking up around here along with the holiday season. Good for the casino and hopefully good for Team Garcia too. More gamblers equal more opportunity! At the rate the numbers are growing, my team and I may be hard pressed to keep things running smoothly, but still, duty calls. We\u2019ll make it work and I\u2019ll make this worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/10/66:\n I finally have my extra security on the cards, hopefully they\u2019ll work wonders on the festive raucous kicking in! I\u2019m always grateful for extra muscle around this time of year, even if they are a little rough around the edges. Secure doors being left unlocked. Excessive force. Grown men confused about the building layout. Typical stuff. They may not be the smartest bunch, but I\u2019ll whip them into shape. At least I\u2019ll try.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/15/66:\n Huge swell of people into the hotel today. I have business to attend to so you\u2019ll have to forgive a short entry for tonight. At least when you finally get around to reading this. Security still wandering around like headless chickens but I have a hunch we\u2019ll all need to step up big tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/16/66:\n This isn\u2019t right. None of this is right. Things have taken a turn for the worst around here, and I\u2019m not talking about profit margins. Don\u2019t ask how it happened. Don\u2019t ask who the hell was responsible. I\u2019m shaking just writing this because no one knows where we are, what the hell is going on or how we\u2019re going to get out of this. One minute it\u2019s business as usual, the next all hell starts breaking loose. Whatever it was, I wasn\u2019t there to see it. But there\u2019s nothing out there now, nothing at all recognisable, and the staff I sent out to investigate still haven\u2019t come back. I have hundreds of terrified patrons banging at my door and we\u2019ve yet to establish anything resembling order amongst them. God help us. Give me strength Coraline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/17/66:\n Somehow we\u2019ve managed to get a grip on the situation, however bleak the circumstances. We\u2019ve assembled all the survivors we could find in the casino, since outside the building is no man\u2019s land now. One of our dealers, poor lad, learnt that the hard way when he tried to get out through the foyer.\n\n\n\nThe silver lining is that somehow the lights and water still work, so there\u2019s that, and we\u2019ve had security handing out food from the cafeteria to those that\u2019ll take it. Definitely feels lonelier around here though. We still haven\u2019t taken a count of those left, but it\u2019s starting to look like a sizeable few just didn\u2019t make it. As for the survivors, a fragile peace has taken hold, but I\u2019m worried about how long it\u2019ll last and terrified about the long run. At least I can confide that in here, because out there they sure as hell can\u2019t afford to see me break down. I need to stay strong. For their sakes and mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/18/66:\n I think my fellow employees are already starting to crack. I had to stop a colleague of five years from heading back to the cage and allowing the exchange of chips for cash, not to mention the restaurant staff from selling food and booze like nothing\u2019s the matter. As if cash has any value at a time like this! I don\u2019t know how much booze got out before I put a stop to it, but I do know that drunkenness is not a wildcard I\u2019d like to be contending with given the already dire circumstances. I\u2019m going to have to run a much tighter ship if we\u2019re to stand any chance of getting through this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/19/66:\n We\u2019ve managed to track down those with alcohol. Too bad they\u2019re mostly members of my own damn security staff. One of them has already managed to drink himself into a coma, and plenty more seem intent on following that example. So not only do we now have fewer hands on deck, but our supplies are dwindling by the day to boot. Coraline, I wonder if I\u2019m already the only sane one left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/20/66:\n The past couple of hours have been a nightmare. The fire started before anyone knew what was happening, and that was when we noticed it. Some damaged electrics had ignited a fireball that damn near consumed the lobby and us with it. It was a miracle we managed to get it under control, let alone stop it, but in the end the sprinklers and our bravest managed to come through. I just hope there aren\u2019t any more surprises headed our way, because our hopes and resources are stretched far enough as it is. But at least now there\u2019s a little more per head and a half-dozen fewer mouths to feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/25/66:\n Christmas today. Even though I knew I\u2019d be spending it without you, somehow our predicament only makes the feeling worse. I can only hope your fortunes are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/29/66:\n More trouble in Paradise. To say we should\u2019ve rationed our food supplies better is an understatement, since we let a lot of good stuff go to waste in the chaos following the start of this ordeal. Fear and anger, on the other hand, are here in abundance.\n\n\nWe took a count. There are two hundred and seventeen of us stuck here. I doubt we have enough to last us a fortnight. What should I do? What can I do?\n\n\n\nI wish you were here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/01/67:\n The hungry are turning violent.\n\n\nThere\u2019s practically a mob forming in the Poker Hall and they seem intent on claiming the scraps we have left one way or another. That and lashing out at anything or anyone they can get their hands on. The patrons. The security. The dealers. Me. We all want answers. We all want solutions. The difference is that I\u2019m expected to deliver. Not to mention that we\u2019re still no closer to figuring out what on earth started this mess. The phones are useless. We can\u2019t get a radio signal. We\u2019re cut off.\n\n\nYet still, fixing this mess is my duty. Why else am I here, separate from you? No matter the odds, I have to try.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/05/67:\n I\u2019ve tasked the few workers who\u2019ll still obey with keeping those who have kept order safe, but the rest have all turned on us by now. My hands are tied. The Assistant Floor Manager has a dozen or so survivors holed up in the smoking room, convinced that escape is their only option. They\u2019re close to jumping ship. Maybe they already have. Duty continues to call, but I\u2019m finding it difficult to answer.\n\n\nI\u2019m spending more and more time holed up in this office alone. Out there, violence is becoming more and more common, so it seems like a smart enough move for now. But the hunger is only getting worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/06/67:\n I\u2019m writing this to try and dull the nagging pain in my stomach, and keep some spark of hope going in the darkness outside. More and more are abandoning the casino in favour of whatever lies out there, but I don\u2019t blame them. The people still here are changing, driven mad by panic, hunger and desperation. I haven\u2019t eaten in days, and even though I hate to admit it, even I\u2019m struggling to keep a level head and a clear mind.\n\n\nAnd so this is starting to look more and more like the end. Coraline, you seem so impossibly far away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/10/67:\n My hunger continues to grow, but some have found a solution to theirs. Dozens missing. Dozens dead. But I suppose I should\u2019ve expected this. They came here to gamble, and gamble they will, whatever the odds. To eat or be eaten, all down to a roll of the dice. I can only refuse, keep my dignity for whatever it\u2019s worth. For now I\u2019m still safe in my office. It\u2019s preferable to the destruction and depravity that lies beyond.\n\n\nI can hear them, even now. The rolling of dice. The spin of the roulette wheel. The inevitable screams and whoops of crazed mania that follow. Then, at last, silence until the next round.\n\n\nWhat happens when they need new suckers for their little game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/12/67:\n My luck has run out and it appears my time is up. They\u2019re at my door now, and in a few short moments they\u2019ll be upon me, so I\u2019m writing now for anyone who\u2019ll listen. To preserve what happened here. To ask why.\n\n\nKnow that I tried. Tried to hold things together. Tried to do my duty. Tried for the people that matter most. It was only the promise of a better future that brought me here, and even if I can never share that with those I love, I can share this message of regret with you. Tell Coraline I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The landing site of NASA\u2019s Apollo 12 mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3654\n | SCP-3655 | \nSCP-3656\n \u00bb",
