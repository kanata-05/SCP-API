Any transmissions emitted from SCP-5173 are to be intercepted by the Foundation.\n\n\nIn the event that SCP-5173 becomes known to non-Foundation personnel, MTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\") are to be deployed, and given the authority to utilise any fabricated cover story that they deem necessary to obfuscate the existence of SCP-5173.\n\n\nIn the case of an emergence event, the Foundation are to declare an Amida-class situation entailing an attempt to neutralise the anomaly using all weaponry capable of reaching SCP-5173.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-5173 refers to a gravitational singularity orbiting at the edge of the Oort cloud.\n\nSCP-5173 was detected as suddenly materialising within the solar system on the 4th July 2019 at 22:11 and was immediately sighted by Foundation OrbSat PERIHELION.\n\n\nAt the time, SCP-5173 appeared to be the nova of a hereto unknown object with a mass of 0.08M\u2299.\n1\n It was classified \"Keter\", due to its potentially uncontainable nature.\n\n\nIn addition, the Foundation intercepted a long-range radio wave isolated from NASA's DSN.\n2\n This long-range radio wave was detected on the 4th July 2019 at 22:02 but the Foundation was not immediately made aware of the discovery.\n\n\nThis long-range radio wave was transformed into an audio signal by Foundation staff and its contents are transcribed below in English:\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n$COPY PROCYON'ORIGIN'JCYLANSUA9128ASAAF:APHELIONWAKE.APHELIONWAKE.\n\n$TYPE EXPLORATIONSTARBOURNE\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!CLEARANCE-LEVEL:OCHRE!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n\nEVENT-1DEPART-PROCYON\n\n\nEVENT-2ARRI-APHELION\n\n\nEVENT-3FAILR-APHELION\n\n\nCONTENTS OF THE VFR OF PCS APHELION WAKE AWAITS BELOW.\n\n\nEVENT-1DEPART-PROCYON\n:\n\n\nRECEIVED INVENTORY NOTICE ON [[EXPUNGED]].

During this time, the object decayed in luminosity and size. On the 5th July 2020, a gravity wave was detected emanating from SCP-5173 indicating that the object had decayed and collapsed.\n\nSCP-5173 was declared neutralised to reflect the nature of this discovery.\n\n\nAddendum 5173.1\n:\n\n\nOn 5th July 2020, it was discovered by the Deep Space Satellite Relay that the radio transmission intercepted by the Foundation had also been broadcast to another location.
