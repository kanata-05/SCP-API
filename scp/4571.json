The Foundation satellite S-4571.01 shall remain in low Martian orbit to scan the entirety of the Terra Sirenum region for SCP-4571-2 instances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4571 is a bipedal creature of debated origin, currently residing on Mars' Terra Sirenum region in a packed regolith shelter of its own creation. SCP-4571's facial features are similar to both canine and feline facial features. SCP-4571's exact intelligence is currently unknown, but is thought to be fairly similar to human based on observation of SCP-4571's behaviors. SCP-4571's height is 183 centimeters.\n\n\nDespite SCP-4571's diet seeming to consist entirely of SCP-4571-2 fruit, it has relatively sharp teeth. This has lead to the current prevailing theory among our researchers, in which SCP-4571 has arrived from another star system, and has landed on mars unintentionally. No remains of the potential interstellar vehicle have been found. It is unclear if the radio communications device SCP-4571 is currently building is to signal Earth, or SCP-4571's potential home planet. SCP-4571 appears to farm SCP-4571-2 instances for survival. SCP-4571 has a type of tapered Keratin digits, and can carve Martian ice using them.\n\n\nSCP-4571-1 is a cored, amber coloured sphere 15 centimeters in diameter, its hole 5 centimeters in diameter. Upon physical contact between SCP-4571-1 and SCP-4571, A large amount of what resembles plasma is created, notably violet in the visible spectrum, and is abnormally low in temperature for plasma at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 Kelvin. SCP-4571 can control the plasma via sculpting it using its hands and/or mind, as observed during Incident dust storm 5. The plasma appears safely tangible in the hands of SCP-4571 and is capable of both precision cutting and blasts rivaling modern grenades. It has thus far taken on these forms:\n\n\n\n\nA sphere the exact size of SCP-4571-1 (estimated to be a neutral position)\n\n\nAn unknown form, exploding on impact with rover R.4571.01.\n\n\nSeveral circular disks, able to carry rover parts.\n\n\nA curved cutting wedge, 70 centimeters in length, used to separate and carve metal from R.4571.01.\n\n\nA protective spherical structure 20 meters in diameter.\n\n\nA spear-like object thrown by SCP-4571 at R.4571.02.\n\n\n\n\nR.4571.01 and R.4571.02 captured the plasma on camera before losing contact with Earth. Data R.4571.02 sent back indicates that a long, spear-like object had pierced the rover's tracks. The level of control SCP-4571 has over the produced plasma is similar to a Type green reality bender, to a strictly limited extent.\n\n\nDiscovery of SCP-4571 and SCP-4571-1 during rover R.4571.01's mission to investigate SCP-4571-2 instances provoked further observation and a change in object designations. Most notably, changing the plants' designation to SCP-4571-2.\n\n\nSCP-4571-2 is a Mars-based species of plant currently consisting of \ntwenty five\n several hundred individual plants, each bearing one to five fruit a total of five times during a given Martian year. Fruits range from 10-11 centimeters in height, all contain 10 slices in a similar fashion to orange slices. SCP-4571-2 instances do not require liquid water, as their stems have been observed feeding off of crushed ice and crushed dry ice. Only the stem of an SCP-4571-2 instance can process ice, it's roots instead act like an anchor to avoid being uprooted during dust storms.\n\n\nSCP-4571-2 instances are positioned at an estimate of 125 centimeters from each other in a \n5x5 square grid\n 25x25 square grid, for an approximate total grid size of \n6.5x6.5\n 32x32 meters. It is unclear whether SCP-4571-2 instances require this consistent pattern, or if SCP-4571 has simply arranged them for an ease of harvesting SCP-4571-2 fruit. Using data from R.4571.01's camera, mature instances have been calculated at a range of heights, approximately 28-48 centimeters. Further detailed in \nDocument 4571-A\n.\n\n\nFruit produced by SCP-4571-2 contains no traces of Perchlorate, despite its abundance in Martian soil. Furthermore they contain all of the necessary vitamins and minerals in just the right amounts for human survival, [DATA EXPUNGED], and an unidentified stable superheavy element. Use of SCP-4571-2 fruit in long term human survival is currently improbable due to it's location, intake, and SCP-4571's potential hostile reaction.\n\n\nData sent back from both rovers allowed Foundation botanists to determine SCP-4571-2's cells function with solid ice rather than water, a statement backed by infrared scans detailing that SCP-4571-2 instances assume the ambient temperature of the area. Should the temperature of the immediate area rise sufficiently for liquid water, even in small amounts it is likely that SCP-4571-2 instances would die off similarly to frozen Earth flora due to the change in volume, albeit via implosion of cells rather than a rupturing of cells.\n\n\nDocument 4571-A:\n Data captured by rovers R.4571.01 and R.4571.02\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0List\u00a0of\u00a0notable\u00a0SCP-4571-2\u00a0instances\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Credentials\u00a0Confirmed\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery date:\n The first 25 SCP-4571-2 instances were discovered and analyzed by R.4571.01 on 15/11/2018. Here are the most notable instances at the time.\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-4571-2-01\n\n\nDescription:\n 21 centimeters in height. Bore 1 fruit.

The shelter resembles a mud house, and contains at least 2 floors\n1\n. The mud house contains several mud shelves, and one mud formation resembling a couch in its first floor. Mud stairs lead to an unexplored second floor, however it is assumed much like the first floor to be one open room. The house contains a single window on the second floor facing the south, as to allow SCP-4571 to view the farm.\n\n\nNotes:\n It is unknown if the window can be closed.\n\n\nItem:\n Papyrus-like parchment made from SCP-4571-2 stems\n\n\ndiscovery date:\n 15/11/2018\n\n\nDescription:\n Roughly 25 centimeters in height and 20 centimeters in length, the parchment contains smears of SCP-4571-2 fruit mixed with Martian regolith, further observation is necessary to determine the nature of this mix.

Likewise, c likely represents three fifths of an SCP-4571-2 fruit. The usage of fifths have lead researchers to assume that these illustrations are for a base 5 number system, as supported by each symbol corresponding to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 fruit illustrations respectively. This assumption in turn supports the third line of the parchment in which \"\u25a0 \u2039 \u263c\" represents one and three fifths of SCP-4571-2 fruit, an indicator of the \u2039 symbol corresponding to a base five version of a decimal point. Post Incident 4571-B, SCP-4571 had drawn rover R.4571.01 as well as several of its individual parts. As of rover R.4571.02's last sent photo, 588 symbols have been drawn on the back side of the parchment.

SCP-4571 used SCP-4571-1 to create a protective sphere 20 meters in diameter.\n\n\nNotes:\n SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's skin seemed to resist the plasma produced by SCP-4571-1, making it possible that SCP-4571 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have previously encountered each other. SCP-4571 was visibly injured after the storm had cleared.\n\n\nItem:\n Changes to Parchment and carving\n\n\ndiscovery date:\n 21/11/2018\n\n\nDescription:\n Parchment now contained approximately 40 more symbols on its front, however R.4571.02 could not get a decent enough view of it to see specific symbols. A curved line was scratched by SCP-4571 onto the Solar system carving, resembling a flight path involving a gravity assist from The Moon to slow down into high Earth orbit.\n\n\nItem:\n A large cube of ice\n\n\ndiscovery date:\n 22/11/2018\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4571 walked 25 kilometers North-east, where R.4571.02 was unable to track SCP-4571. Satellite S-4571.01 was able to make out a slashing motion on the part of SCP-4571, before it began to return carrying a large cube-shaped chunk of ice.\n\n\nNotes:\n SCP-4571 had a pile of ice within 30 meters of the farm, which had been used up the previous night to water the SCP-4571-2 instances. Estimates put the cube of ice at 920 kilograms, much too heavy for SCP-4571 to carry on its own.

        "SCP-4571-2 instances are positioned at an estimate of 125 centimeters from each other in a 5x5 square grid 25x25 square grid, for an approximate total grid size of 6.5x6.5 32x32 meters. It is unclear whether SCP-4571-2 instances require this consistent pattern, or if SCP-4571 has simply arranged them for an ease of harvesting SCP-4571-2 fruit. Using data from R.4571.01's camera, mature instances have been calculated at a range of heights, approximately 28-48 centimeters. Further detailed in Document 4571-A .\nFruit produced by SCP-4571-2 contains no traces of Perchlorate, despite its abundance in Martian soil. Furthermore they contain all of the necessary vitamins and minerals in just the right amounts for human survival, [DATA EXPUNGED], and an unidentified stable superheavy element. Use of SCP-4571-2 fruit in long term human survival is currently improbable due to it's location, intake, and SCP-4571's potential hostile reaction.\nData sent back from both rovers allowed Foundation botanists to determine SCP-4571-2's cells function with solid ice rather than water, a statement backed by infrared scans detailing that SCP-4571-2 instances assume the ambient temperature of the area. Should the temperature of the immediate area rise sufficiently for liquid water, even in small amounts it is likely that SCP-4571-2 instances would die off similarly to frozen Earth flora due to the change in volume, albeit via implosion of cells rather than a rupturing of cells.",
