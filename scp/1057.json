Vegetation in SCP-1057's habitat is to be maintained twice a week (see document 1057-H-19 for specifications). It is forbidden to enter SCP-1057's tank for 30 minutes before and after feedings.\n\n\nSCP-1057 is to be fed five (5) kg of raw meat and fish, three (3) times a day. Once every four (4) days, this meat and fish is to be injected with non-toxic fluorescent dyes (see document 1057-G-4 for specifications). The tank is to be lit with ultraviolet lamps.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1057 is an animate empty space, five (5) meters long, in the shape of an adult tiger shark (\nGaleocerdo cuvier\n). It does not appear to have any mass; however, it displaces water by an unknown mechanism. SCP-1057's refractive index is approximately that of air, which makes it partially visible when immersed in salt water; as well, its \"anti-shadow\" is discernible under bright light. Experiments involving the insertion of inanimate objects into SCP-1057's \"body\" have revealed that there is nothing there; however, further experiments along these lines are contraindicated, as this triggers extremely aggressive behavior on the part of SCP-1057.\n\n\nSCP-1057's behavior has been assessed by Foundation ichthyologists as being within normal parameters for an adult tiger shark. Any food consumed by SCP-1057 disappears, with the exception of the non-digestible fluorescent dyes which are regularly added to SCP-1057's food to facilitate monitoring its behavior. These dyes persist within SCP-1057 for five to nine days, and outline a digestive and circulatory system; several hypotheses to explain how this is possible when there is manifestly no actual shark present have been suggested, tested, and disproved (see archive 1057-N4).\n\n\nAcquisition log\n: SCP-1057 was captured in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Public Swimming Pool, in [REDACTED], where it killed two swimmers and mutilated a lifeguard; five people were killed in the ensuing panic. Foundation personnel embedded in the local hospital reported the incident; retrieval agents arrived on the scene and SCP-1057 was eventually taken into custody. During forensic examination of the swimming pool premises, Document 1057-K24 was discovered on the staff bulletin board; although Document 1057-K24 is handwritten, no fingerprints were found on it.\n\n\nDocument 1057-K24\n:\n\n\n\n\nPanic means that the idea of a shark can be more dangerous than an actual shark.\n\n\nIt can even be more dangerous than no shark at all.\n\n\nAre we cool yet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1056\n | SCP-1057 | \nSCP-1058\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1057\n\" by SiriExMachina and Voct, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
