SCP-231-7 is to be kept at an undisclosed location. All personnel assigned to SCP-231 will be transported there blindfolded from Site-19 by a route including no fewer than seven different forms of transportation, including but not limited to aircraft, automobile, underground tunnel, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Individuals must score at least 72 points on the Milgram Obedience Examination, be unmarried, have no offspring, and express nothing less than total loyalty to the Foundation. Normal psychological screening procedures against Axis II disorders are waived, so long as the Class-D personnel in question has the mental capacity to carry out Procedure 110-Montauk as needed.\n\n\nLuke 23:34.\n\nPersonnel who express sympathy towards SCP-231-7's plight and/or express a desire to rescue or sympathize towards SCP-231-7 will be transferred to another project without delay. Any actual rescue attempts will be met with immediate termination. Personnel who have served on the staff of SCP-231-7's Containment Team are not required to divulge that information to others.

On-site staff are not to remove said uniforms in the presence of other staff members. Off-duty hours are to be spent in private quarters alone.\n\n\nSix Class D Personnel are to be assigned to SCP-231-7 each month for the purposes of carrying out Procedure 110-Montauk. Violent criminals are not to be used for this purpose due to the possibility of accidental fatality during the 110-Montauk process.\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Following repeated escape and suicide attempts, and based on the failure of containment for SCP-231-1 through 6, containment of SCP-231-7 has been amended to the following: SCP-231 is to be contained within a soundproof holding cell, adjacent to holding cells for six Class D Personnel assigned for the purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk. Cameras will monitor every inch of the cell at all times, and must be manned 24 hours a day. Malfunctioning monitoring equipment will be replaced without delay by psychologically screened staff. Doors will be magnetically locked, openable only by positive action by the control and monitoring facility. This includes all doors linking the main holding cell to those of the six Class D Personnel.\n\n\nSCP-231-7 is to be kept restrained to a hospital bed at all times except for the purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk. Hydration will be provided through IV drip. Feeding will be carried out twice per day through feeding tube by approved medical personnel who have not taken the Hippocratic Oath. Under no circumstances are narcotics, anesthesia, or other unapproved medications to be administered to SCP-231-7.\n\n\nthe potter told his 'prentice to prepare him seven jars. six he made with grace and skill, the last his hands did mar.\n\nProcedure 110-Montauk is to be carried out at least once every 24 hours by Class D Personnel. During Procedure 110-Montauk, at least one Security Clearance 4/231 staff member must monitor the procedure by camera at all times, although the sound may be turned off if the vocalizations of SCP-231-7 become too distressing. Following the procedure, all Class D Personnel must return to their holding cells or explosive collars will be detonated.\n\n\nthe cretin moon no more is howling, gone its mourning black. in their dreams its face is prowling, come to take them back.\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED PER ORDER OF O5-\u2588\u2588 ON \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points.\n\n\n\n\nYes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal [REDACTED].\n\n\nNo, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or anything else.\n\n\nNo, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.\n\n\nYes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.\n\n\nYes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.\n\n\nNo, we have not given up trying to save SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event associated with each subsequent SCP-\u2588\u2588 specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the cultists (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Seals,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B).\n\n\nNo, putting the poor girl out of her misery is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her. She has to be aware of what is going on for 110-Montauk to work.\n\n\n\n\nOne final note: The Foundation does many distasteful things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the price is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like \nSCP-682\n) but because of the danger that our resolve will fail, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to sympathy for the suffering of an innocent, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous acts. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the shrink.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDon't believe it when they say they're trying to save her. Why would they bother? They've got exactly what they want exactly where they want it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 231-c:\n Update\n\n\n231-07's emotional response to Procedure 110-Montauk appears to be reduced recently, despite proper execution of said procedure, increasing danger of SCP-\u2588\u2588 undergoing a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event. Two options have been proposed.\n\n\n1. Development of a new containment procedure with higher emotional response than Procedure 110-Montauk.\n\n\n2. Administration of a Class A Amnestic to SCP-231-7, allowing for a return to base emotional response state. Said memory modification is to be administered during execution of Procedure 110-Montauk to maintain heightened emotional state following memory reset.\n\n\nPlease advise.\n\n\nthe doctor never tells his god which one he really seeks. instead he hides himself away, and quietly, he weeps.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 231-d:\n Decision\n\n\nProverbs 1:32\n\n\nCarry out Option 2 at the first available opportunity.\n\n\ntheir god's own voice, he makes the choice, declaring with their word. \"in fear and pain let her remain, lest she be like the third.\"\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 231-e:\n Aftermath\n\n\nEzekiel 6:14\n\n\nOption 2 was carried out. SCP-231-7's emotional state returned to 100% efficacy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 subsequently committed suicide due to heightened emotional stress. Will continue analysis of efficacy of treatment.\n\n\nthe doctor's gun ended his run, as he put it to his ear. as she was defiled, the pitied child, he gave it to his fear.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 231-f:\n Continued Analysis of Efficacy of Treatment\n\n\nRevelation 18:21-24\n\n\nAfter some analysis, I have determined that it is not necessary to perform memory modification every time Procedure 110-Montauk is carried out. In fact, it is better to delay for some time before re-administering the agent. Analysis of Subject 231-7's emotional response indicates that efficacy of Procedure 110-Montauk seems to peak between the third and fourth performance of the procedure: the dread of anticipation of events seems to heighten emotional response for a time, before familiarity with the procedure begins to lessen the efficacy of treatment.

        "Addendum 231-b: Text of missive by O5-\u2588\u2588",
        "Addendum 231-c: Update\n231-07's emotional response to Procedure 110-Montauk appears to be reduced recently, despite proper execution of said procedure, increasing danger of SCP-\u2588\u2588 undergoing a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event. Two options have been proposed.\n1. Development of a new containment procedure with higher emotional response than Procedure 110-Montauk.\n2. Administration of a Class A Amnestic to SCP-231-7, allowing for a return to base emotional response state. Said memory modification is to be administered during execution of Procedure 110-Montauk to maintain heightened emotional state following memory reset.\nPlease advise. the doctor never tells his god which one he really seeks. instead he hides himself away, and quietly, he weeps. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588",
        "Addendum 231-d: Decision Proverbs 1:32 Carry out Option 2 at the first available opportunity. their god's own voice, he makes the choice, declaring with their word. \"in fear and pain let her remain, lest she be like the third.\" O5-\u2588\u2588",
        "Addendum 231-e: Aftermath Ezekiel 6:14 Option 2 was carried out. SCP-231-7's emotional state returned to 100% efficacy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 subsequently committed suicide due to heightened emotional stress. Will continue analysis of efficacy of treatment. the doctor's gun ended his run, as he put it to his ear. as she was defiled, the pitied child, he gave it to his fear. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588",
        "Addendum 231-f: Continued Analysis of Efficacy of Treatment Revelation 18:21-24 After some analysis, I have determined that it is not necessary to perform memory modification every time Procedure 110-Montauk is carried out. In fact, it is better to delay for some time before re-administering the agent. Analysis of Subject 231-7's emotional response indicates that efficacy of Procedure 110-Montauk seems to peak between the third and fourth performance of the procedure: the dread of anticipation of events seems to heighten emotional response for a time, before familiarity with the procedure begins to lessen the efficacy of treatment. My recommendation is that Class A Amnestics be administered once a week during Procedure 110-Montauk. The calendar has been modified accordingly. her memory a fickle thing, the strongest shall endure. when her weeping starts to waver, their drugs make her mind pure.

        "Dear Friends, It has come to my attention that recently, certain rumors have surfaced regarding SCP-231. Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points. Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal [REDACTED]. No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or anything else. No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail. Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project. Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it. No, we have not given up trying to save SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event associated with each subsequent SCP-\u2588\u2588 specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the cultists (see document \"Seven Brides, Seven Seals,\" SCP-231-Adjunct B). No, putting the poor girl out of her misery is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her. She has to be aware of what is going on for 110-Montauk to work. One final note: The Foundation does many distasteful things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the price is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682 ) but because of the danger that our resolve will fail, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to sympathy for the suffering of an innocent, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous acts. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the shrink. Sincerely, O5-\u2588\u2588 Don't believe it when they say they're trying to save her. Why would they bother? They've got exactly what they want exactly where they want it.",
