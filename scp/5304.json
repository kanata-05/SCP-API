Cover Story APOSTRA-\u03c6 \u201cCollaborative Fiction\u201d is to be disseminated to reduce public interest in SCP-5304 whenever discussion of the phenomenon occurs online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Update 23/8/2020:\n Two additional specialized webcrawlers (SIGMA-10-REMOVEDDIT and SIGMA-11-ERADICATEDDIT) have been deployed to monitor for the presence of SCP-5304 keywords. Any online discussion of SCP-5304 should be removed from civilian access as early as possible after discovery. Visual antimemetic agents should be deployed as deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Update 6/9/2020:\n In the event that civilians attempt to travel to or approach the building designated as SCP-5304, MTF Sigma-14 agents are to deter entry by any means necessary.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5304 is the persistent phenomenon of the internet location service Google Maps labeling an abandoned storage building in West Virginia as \u201cSCP Foundation - Site 50\u201d. No such site is, nor ever has been, owned by the Foundation.\n\n\nThe phenomenon is anomalously resistant to information suppression techniques; all efforts aimed at removing the designation of \"SCP Foundation - Site 50\" or reducing its visibility have been unsuccessful. In addition, all attempts at isolating the IP address of the person or persons maintaining this designation have been unsuccessful.\n\n\nThis effect is compounded by the fact that current suppression technology does not allow the instantaneous removal of sensitive information from civilian web services, including Google; at present, reviews of SCP-5304 remain accessible to civilian browsers for an average of 48 hours before removal by embedded Foundation agents. The improvement of current information suppression protocol is considered a high priority.\n\n\nInvestigation into the origin, nature, and purpose of SCP-5304 is ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 5304-1: Discovery\n\nFoundation webcrawler SIGMA-09-XEGEL registered sensitive keywords in the Google Maps service on 30/7/2020. SIGMA-09-XEGEL attempted to forcibly remove the location designation; when it was unable to do so, it alerted Site-15 researchers to the anomaly. After all manual attempts at removal were unsuccessful, SCP-5304 was deemed a priority due to information security concerns, classified, and issued its current containment procedures.\n\n\nPreliminary examination of the building subject to the SCP-5304 phenomenon revealed it to be a non-anomalous storage facility, showing signs of having been abandoned for upwards of twenty years.\n\n\nAt the time of containment, no civilian visits to the Google Maps location labeled \"SCP Foundation - Site 50\" had been recorded.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5304-2\n\nA theorized memetic effect of SCP-5304 has resulted in public interest in SCP-5304 steadily increasing, despite strict adherence to information suppression protocol. Numerous observations provide evidence for this conclusion: a marked uptick in traffic to the address of SCP-5304, an increase in reviews posted to SCP-5304, and the creation of threads discussing the phenomenon on minor forums pertaining to conspiracy theories. Creation of a dedicated Mobile Task Force is pending approval.\n\n\nAnalysis of these observations suggested the involvement of GoI-5869 (\u201cGamers Against Weed\u201d). The following are chat logs relevant to the origin of SCP-5304.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngaycopmp4\n\n\nToday at 4:28 PM\n\n\n\n\nyo check this shit out\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/SCP+Foundation+-+Site+50/@40.2838326,-80.600307,142m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883433802d2fc66d:0xabc910f9ed4ce48c!8m2!3d40.2838316!4d-80.5997598\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlesbian_gengar\n\n\nToday at 4:28 PM\n\n\n\n\ni am absolutely not clicking that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhetcopogg\n\n\nToday at 4:29 PM\n\n\n\n\nHA oh my god\n\nno its fine click it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlesbian_gengar\n\n\nToday at 4:29 PM\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhetcopogg\n\n\nToday at 4:29 PM\n\n\n\n\nlook at this shit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlesbian_gengar\n\n\nToday at 4:29 PM\n\n\n\n\nno one's ever going to notice this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngaycopmp4\n\n\nToday at 4:30 PM\n\n\n\n\ni know but i stopped by here on my way to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and had the idea and it was easier than shit\n\ni barely even needed to tech any shit up other than the usual cloaking shit google really just lets you say whatever you want on here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhetcopogg\n\n\nToday at 4:30 PM\n\n\n\n\nwait wait wait guys leave a bunch of stupid reviews\n\n\n@here\n leave a bunch of stupid reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlesbian_gengar\n\n\nToday at 4:30 PM\n\n\n\n\nhey come on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainerDP\n\n\nToday at 4:30 PM\n\n\n\n\nbro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhetcopogg\n\n\nToday at 4:30 PM\n\n\n\n\nsorry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngaycopmp4\n\n\nToday at 4:31 PM\n\n\n\n\nvore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvore-tracker\n\n\nToday at 4:31 PM\n\n\n\n\n@gaycopmp4\n referenced the forbidden word, setting the counter back to 0.
