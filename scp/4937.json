First of all, you attached a memetic hazard as the image, which, aside from being completely unethical, is just completely unacceptable. Then there's the containment procedures, which simply say [REDACTED]? That's unauthorized on so many levels. And I don't even want to talk about the description.\n\n\nWhat is SCP-4937?

Thing is, I\u2019ve got as many problems as I have fingers, if I count with the other hand, because I can\u2019t count with neither hand and if I use your hand to count then I\u2019m not counting, and then it doesn\u2019t count. What counts is\u2026well.\n\n\nBefore I begin\u2026let me tell you, we had just finished observing the breached site through a camera attached to a blown-up lighter than air, heavy-duty balloon being blown upward due to a draft, like the draft in my office where I wrote that first draft. Why a balloon? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because balloons have been blown up, while drones can be blown up, like that breached site. Anyways, that was when we noticed this anomaly. It wasn\u2019t that one, but our job is to contain this and contain that. That one wasn\u2019t there, so it hadn\u2019t been blown up. If it wasn\u2019t there, then this wasn\u2019t here, and we had just wasted a lighter than air, heavy-duty balloon. We let it go, like I let go of the case, and it went up in the air, like my expectations.\n\n\nAnyways, the breached site contained SCP-4937, which was what we were there for. SCP-4937 seems to enjoy balloons, especially balloon animals, since it was one. It seemed like a ghost, because we had nothing on it, and because ghosts float, like balloons. Why do I keep getting sidetracked? I\u2019m trying to say the right thing, but what\u2019s right has left my mind, and what\u2019s left in my mind is wrong. While we try to make sure everything goes right, sometimes nothing goes right instead, and balloons go up.\n\n\nOn the off-chance it was on-site and not blown up, as in exploded, it was probably underground. We descended into the sublevels with sub-optimal substitute lighting. The whole complex was flooded, and not with light. I continued through the long, dark hallway, until I came to a fork in the road. I chose the right path, which was the left path and not the right path. I should\u2019ve chosen the latter. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was a flood lamp on a brick wall. I went back through the tunnels flooded with light and not water to reach the tunnels filled with the latter and not the former, until I came upon a ladder. I chose the ladder.\n\n\nI went down on a hunch, and also because the floor above me was collapsed. This was the right path, because at the end was SCP-4937, blown up, as in expanded. But I felt like I had been gut punched, because while I had the guts to come here, my gut feeling was right. Picture this, but you won\u2019t, because there wasn\u2019t a picture, but there was this: it didn't float, because floats don\u2019t float, and neither do some balloons.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nNolan Rogers, Antimemetics Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Morowitz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: <\npcs.noitadnuof.citememitna|sregorn#pcs.noitadnuof.citememitna|sregorn\n>\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe: SCP-4937\n\n\nMarch 9, 2019 at 7:13 PM\n\n\nNolan Rogers,\n\n\nYou haven't addressed any of my concerns. I have notified your superiors and they are aware of the situation. Please don't make this a bigger problem than it already is.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel Morowitz, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4937\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-4937 is to be kept in Storage Containment Unit \u2588-\u2588\u2588 inside a 30\u00a0cm x 30\u00a0cm x 30\u00a0cm padded container. Personnel should be cautious when handling the object due to its fragile nature.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4937 appears to be a partially deflated 260Q modelling balloon of ordinary make and white coloration, originally measuring 32\u00a0cm from the end to the inflation valve, in a form described as that of a dog.\n\n\nSCP-4937 is the subject of a cognitohazardous meme. Information regarding its properties, behavior, and nature is \"evasively excessive\". Thus, it is only possible to understand information regarding SCP-4937 through direct observation.\n\n\nAttempts to describe SCP-4937's abstract properties have failed, as a result of either excessive imposition or evasive exposition. As such, information regarding SCP-4937 may or may not be true, and it may or may not present a significant threat to containment security.\n\n\n\n\nIn an ordinary sense, memes are essentially living ideas, and the proposed anti-meme is a suicidal meme. But this one, it's different. It grows, yes, but in the wrong direction. It isn't spreading or concealing information about itself, but rather, it's spreading the \nwrong\n information. It just wants us to \nthink\n it's a balloon dog. And since we can't understand it, and don't know what the hell it is, it\u2019s probably no laughing matter. - \nDr. Marcus Sonoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4937-1:\n\nSCP-4937 was recovered on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at Site-\u2588\u2588 by Junior Researcher Nolan Rogers.
