Research into developing a countermeme is ongoing. SCP-4065-3 instances are to be erased or deleted whenever possible; SCP-4065-3 has been deleted from most files requiring Level 2/General, Level 3/Ontokinetic, and/or Level 4/Memetic clearance to edit, although these changes are frequently reverted by infected personnel. Information about SCP-4065 is restricted to SCP-4065-resistant individuals via selective perception countermemes.\n\n\nAll anomalies whose containment procedures rely on the use of SCP-4065-1 are major breach risks; however, many of those anomalies have been infected with SCP-4065, and as such are partially self-containing. Alternate containment procedures for these anomalies are to be developed and enacted as soon as possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4065 is an anomalous memetic contagion that currently affects almost all Foundation personnel. Affected individuals believe in the existence and efficacy of a piece of technology identified as a \"Scranton Reality Anchor\" (SCP-4065-1), a device apparently intended to protect against ontokinetic threats; SCP-4065-1 instances apparently protect against these threats by stabilizing the \"Hume field\", an objective measure of the \"thickness\" of reality that can be detected by devices known as \"Kant Counters\" (SCP-4065-2). SCP-4065 was created by Dr. Susan Scranton, for whom SCP-4065-1 is named, as an experimental containment method for sapient ontokinetic anomalies; while it was largely successful in its original purpose, the parameters for infection were not well-defined, and it was quickly transmitted to Foundation personnel.\n\n\nSCP-4065-1 and -2 instances are created by infected individuals from available materials; SCP-4065-1 instances tend to be constructed from laboratory equipment, kitchen appliances, and desktop computers, while SCP-4065-2 instances tend to be constructed from smaller devices, such as pocket calculators and mobile phones. These devices usually have a number of buttons, switches, LEDs and dials that function as a control panel; SCP-4065-2 instances always have at least one prominent antenna or receiver dish. In addition to the electronic components, SCP-4065-1 and -2 instances occasionally contain more exotic materials, including large quartz crystals, radiation sources, and human remains. All documented SCP-4065-1 and -2 instances have been painted or otherwise marked with SCP-4065-3.\n\n\nSCP-4065-3 is a memetic trigger sigil, originally devised by Dr. Susan Scranton, which acts as the primary vector for SCP-4065 infection. When an individual who has moderate knowledge of the Foundation's existence, purpose, and ideology\n2\n sees SCP-4065-3, they begin to show symptoms of SCP-4065 infection within 48 hours; individuals who have worked directly with ontokinetic anomalies or have ontokinetic abilities themselves show symptoms within 8 hours. A secondary component of the SCP-4065 meme-complex is the idea that SCP-4065-3 is the primary logo or seal of the Foundation; as a result, SCP-4065-3 is now widely used by Foundation personnel as an identifying emblem, and variations have been adopted for use by all major Foundation departments.\n\n\nThere is currently no known countermeme for SCP-4065 infection. It is currently hypothesized that immunity to SCP-4065 requires full knowledge of its creation and the memes that compose it; the only individual who fulfills these criteria is the creator, Dr. Susan Scranton.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Constructed from a thermal immersion circulator. SCP-4065-3 redacted.\n\n\n2\n. All Foundation personnel and most sapient anomalies in Foundation containment fulfill these criteria. It is likely that members of most major groups of interest are also susceptible to SCP-4065 infection, although this is currently unconfirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4064\n | SCP-4065 | \nSCP-4066\n \u00bb",
