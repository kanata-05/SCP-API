Signs reminding staff of SCP-4379 and its properties should be positioned in any hallway featuring an entrance into SCP-4379, with emphasis near said entrances.\n\n\nPersonnel attempting to enter SCP-4379 via the attached ventilation shaft must be equipped with a functional parachute.\n\n\nExplorations into SCP-4379 must be pre-approved by a Foundation staff member with Level 3/4379 or higher clearance.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-4379 is an extradimensional location replacing the former office of the Assistant Director of Research at \nLunar Area-32\n.\n2\n To date, no method of accessing the original office has been successful, as all attempts invariably result in SCP-4379 being accessed instead.\n\n\nInternally, SCP-4379 is an arboreal mountain range of indeterminate size; exploratory teams have reported neither encountering nor seeing any boundaries or coastal features within or beyond a 1,000\u00a0km radius of the main entry point. The region is perpetually illuminated by a star consistent with the Sun, located directly above SCP-4379, and appears to lack a magnetic field, rendering discernment of cardinal directions\n3\n impossible.\n4\n The gravitational pull within SCP-4379 is approximately equal to Earth\u2019s.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of SCP-4379 is identical to that of Lunar Area 32 at any given time, excluding a 10% increase in humidity; the climate of SCP-4379 can be changed by altering the settings of Lunar Area 32\u2019s atmosphere regulator. This correlation is believed to arise from the ventilation shaft formerly connected to the Assistant Director of Research\u2019s office, which now leads to an indeterminate point within SCP-4379 several kilometres above the ground; however, it is unlikely the generator is sustaining the anomaly\u2019s atmosphere, or is doing so with the assistance of an ectoentropic anomaly.\n5\n\n\nThe biodiversity of SCP-4379 consists entirely of seven endemic species of flora, all genetically related to species found on Earth; of these \nPinus cembra\n var. \nlunae\n6\n is the only non-grass species present. To date, no fauna have been encountered whatsoever.\n\n\nGenetic analysis of soil samples from SCP-4379 remains inconclusive.\n\n\nSCP-4379 was initially discovered on March 12, 2009, following a period of twelve minutes wherein Lunar Area-32 was forced to function exclusively on backup power. Inspection of the FAM-32 reactor confirmed it was functioning at full capacity for the entire period, however all produced power was being drawn to an unknown source; a search of Lunar Area-32 for the source resulted in the discovery of SCP-4379.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\nExploration Audio Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Distributed Task Force Sigma-6 Division 9 (\u2018Spacemen\u2019)\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n D-6 \u2018Roller\u2019\n\n\nTeam Members:\n\nD-7 \u2018Skywalker\u2019\n\nD-8 \u2018Buzz\u2019\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRoller:\n Microphones on?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Yep.\n\n\nRoller:\n I want it on the record that we\u2019re trained for general security, not melting realities, so the moment the freaky stuff starts we\u2019re bailing.\n\n\nSkywalker\n (distant, via Buzz\u2019s microphone): Blondies should\u2019ve gotten this, not us.\n\n\nRoller:\n Fix your mic Skywalker, it\u2019s not coming through.\n\n\nCrackling feedback.\n\n\nSkywalker\n (distorted): Wah, wah\u2026\n\n\nBuzz:\n Still buggered.\n\n\nSkywalker\n (distorted): Oh for\u2026\n\n\nCrackling feedback.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n How about now?\n\n\nRoller:\n Perfect. Are we done complaining about the powers that be?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Quite.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Yep.\n\n\nRoller:\n Good. Spacemen entering the anomaly now.\n\n\nSound of an automatic door opening. Footfalls on concrete, changing to grass.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Nice view.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Usually are, apparently. How long do you reckon we\u2019ll last?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I\u2019ll give us an hour.\n\n\nRoller:\n Pay attention, you two.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Yes sir.\n\n\nBuzz\n (faint, via Skywalker\u2019s microphone): Fifty on twenty.\n\n\nRoller:\n Buzz!\n\n\nBuzz:\n Yes sir, sorry sir.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nBuzz:\n \nWhistles.\n That\u2019s a long drop.\n\n\nRoller:\n Don\u2019t fall.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Yeah, I\u2019d hate to have to shoot zombie-Buzz.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: ten minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nSkywalker:\n So, uhh\u2026 how\u2019s Rosie?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Oh, uhh\u2026 pretty good. Giving school her all; says she wants to go to space like me. Got a B in maths the other day. Or\u2026 at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Nice. I think I was a nuisance back at her age \u2013 sounds like you\u2019re doing it right.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I sure hope so. I just hope that she\u2019ll still listen to me down the track.\n\n\nRoller:\n Keep her away from our sort of work?\n\n\nBuzz:\n All of it, yeah. Look, can we \u2013 can we just change the topic? I don\u2019t want to be doubting my memory.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nBuzz:\n All these trees look the same. Cognitohazard, maybe?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I\u2019ll grab some samples, get them to tell.\n\n\nFootfalls stop.\n\n\nRoller:\n There. Twenty minutes and we\u2019re still rocking.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n That just means he owes me fifty, sir.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Hey, I\u2019ve still got margin of error. I ain\u2019t owe you anything for another twenty.\n\n\nSkywalker scoffs.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Margin of error? It\u2019s just as\u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n Shh!\n\n\nA dull roar rapidly approaches the group.\n\n\nRoller:\n Go! Go go go go!\n\n\nSeveral panicked footfalls. The roar \u2013 a loud rustling \u2013 overtakes the group and continues onward. The footfalls stop.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n It was the damn wind.\n\n\nRoller:\n For the record, that\u2019s the first time anything\u2019s moved other than us. Go grab the samples.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Just\u2026 give me a second. Thought that\u2026\n\n\nRoller:\n You were going to win the bet.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I\u2019m never going to hear the end of this, am I.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Ask \u2018em why they didn\u2019t go first; that\u2019ll shut them up.\n\n\nRoller:\n Come on, let\u2019s keep moving. We\u2019ve still got forty minutes before we can turn back.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n And if something happens before then?\n\n\nRoller:\n Survivors go back early, and it stops being our problem.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Here\u2019s hoping.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: ten minutes of footfalls against grasses.)\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Oh we\u2019ll be al~right, when the wind is in our sails \u2013\n\n\nRoller\n (correcting Skywalker): Oh we\u2019d be al~right, if the wind was in our sails \u2013\n\n\nSkywalker\n (Joining Roller): \u2013 oh we\u2019d be al~right \u2013\n\n\nBuzz\n (Joining Skywalker and Roller): \u2013 if the wind was in our sails, and we\u2019ll all hang on be-hind.\n\n\nBuzz, Roller, Skywalker\n (In unison): And we\u2019ll roll the old, chariot along, we\u2019ll roll the old, chariot along, we\u2019ll roll the old, chariot along, and we\u2019ll all hang on be-hind.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Well a night on the town wouldn\u2019t do us any harm \u2013\n\n\nBuzz, Roller, Skywalker\n (In unison): \u2013 well a night on the town wouldn\u2019t do us any harm, oh a night on the town wouldn\u2019t do us any harm, and we\u2019ll all hang on be-hind. And we\u2019ll \u2013\n\n\nRoller\n (Simultaneous with Buzz, Skywalker) \u2013 roll the old, chariot along, we\u2019ll roll the old, chariot along, we\u2019ll roll the old, chariot along \u2013\n\n\nBuzz, Skywalker\n (In unison, simultaneous with Roller): \u2013 ro~o~o~oll, we\u2019ll ro~o~o~oll, we\u2019ll ro~o~o~oll \u2013\n\n\nBuzz, Roller, Skywalker\n (In unison): \u2013 and we\u2019ll all, hang, on, be~hind.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Say that to Cyrus and \u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n Do you mean Site Director Cyrus Hourdoon, who is a respectable overseer for the facility, and will probably be personally reviewing these audio logs?\n\n\nA moment of silence.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Why would he check the logs over?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Are you kidding? This thing\u2019s literally down the hall from his office \u2013 he\u2019d want to know what sort of funky stuff is going on, and make sure it doesn\u2019t affect him.\n\n\nRoller:\n Let\u2019s drop the topic. Maybe Dev can get these redacted or something beforehand.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses. Buzz, Roller and Skywalker continue to hum the tune of\n Roll the Old Chariot \nin unison.)\n\n\nBuzz:\n Why were we singing?\n\n\nRoller:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nBuzz:\n We just started singing, for no reason.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I was bored. We always do shanties on duty.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I mean, I \nremember\n us doing that, but did we \nactually\n do that? Or are we just remembering something that never happened?\n\n\nRoller:\n I thought you said you didn\u2019t want to doubt your memory, Buzz.\n\n\nThe footfalls stop.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I do too, but what if I didn\u2019t? For all we know this place could be implanting memories into us. Maybe we aren\u2019t even MTFs.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Buzz?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Yeah?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Shut up.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nBuzz\n (mumbled): Damn coghazards.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\n\n\nHover to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\nBuzz:\n Roller.\n\n\nRoller:\n Yes?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Lake, over there.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Finally, something different.\n\n\nRoller:\n We\u2019ll follow this ridge down to it, grab some samples. Walker, photograph.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: ten minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses. Another gust of wind passes the group; none react to it.)\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Make sure not to touch the water. At all.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Got it.\n\n\nRoller:\n Why?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n We\u2019re coming up to an hour, and we just found something different.\n\n\nBuzz:\n You\u2026 you reckon this is the paste-maker?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n It\u2019s right on time.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I\u2026 don\u2019t want to get the sample.\n\n\nRoller:\n You\u2019re the sample-taker.\n\n\nBuzz:\n And I\u2019m the slowest runner.\n\n\nRoller:\n Go and put the damn vial in the lake.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Easy for you to say \u2013 you\u2019ve got a ten metre head-start!\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Oh for \u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n Alright then, Skywalker, you take the sample.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n What? No! It\u2019s Buzz\u2019s job.\n\n\nRoller grumbles.\n\n\nRoller:\n Fine. Paper Scissors Rock, then. Loser takes the sample.\n\n\nBuzz:\n It doesn\u2019t work with three people.\n\n\nRoller:\n That\u2019s because it\u2019s between you two.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n And why aren\u2019t you involved?\n\n\nRoller:\n Because I\u2019m team lead, and \nI said so.\n Now hurry up.\n\n\nBuzz, Skywalker\n (In unison): Paper, scissors, rock. Paper, scissors, rock. Paper, scissors, rock. Paper, scissors, rock.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Probability anomaly.\n\n\nRoller:\n Of course. Alright\u2026 first one to slap \u2013\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Ow!\n\n\nBuzz:\n Sucked in.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n That isn\u2019t fair, he didn\u2019t \u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n Go take the sample, Skywalker.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n But he \u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n Now.\n\n\nSkywalker grumbles. Sound of footfalls against grass. A watch alarm sounds momentarily.\n\n\nSkywalker\n Fffff\u2013 what? What\u2019s that?\n\n\nRoller:\n Hour\u2019s up. Take the sample and we can go home.\n\n\nBuzz:\n See anything?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Nope. Probably invisible. Alright, in three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of hurried footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nRoller:\n Alright\u2026 I think we\u2019re\u2026 in the clear. We good?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Yeah. Got\u2026 the sample.\n\n\nBuzz:\n I\u2019m fine. Anyone\u2026 see the\u2026 beastie?\n\n\nRoller:\n What \u2013 what? What did you see?\n\n\nBuzz:\n No, nothing. I was asking\u2026 if you\u2019d seen it.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I saw nothing, heard nothing.\n\n\nRoller:\n Possibly antimemetic then.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Which means it could be right behind us and we wouldn\u2019t realise it.\n\n\nA moment\u2019s silence.\n\n\nRoller:\n Lets keep going, shall we?\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: five minutes of hurried footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nBuzz:\n Roller?\n\n\nRoller:\n What?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Why is there only three of us?\n\n\nRoller:\n Because Kirk, Ripley and Teal\u2019c needed to keep everything together back in 32.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Yeah, but\u2026 what if there were more of us?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Not this again\u2026\n\n\nRoller:\n Alright, Buzz, if you don\u2019t shut up about this memory crap, I swear I\u2019m going to get you disciplined.\n\n\nBuzz:\n But \u2013\n\n\nRoller:\n I don\u2019t give a damn. If we\u2019re getting stuff erased, we can\u2019t find out until we\u2019re back, and there\u2019s no point in doubting ourselves. Do you have a better idea?\n\n\nBuzz:\n No sir.\n\n\nRoller:\n Then can it, both of you. If I hear anything more about this, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re right or not, I will report you to Site Director Cyrus Hourdoon, and he\u2019ll sort you out personally. Capiche?\n\n\nBuzz, Skywalker\n (In unison): Yes sir.\n\n\nRoller:\n Good.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: twenty minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nSkywalker:\n So.\n\n\nRoller:\n Hmm?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n What\u2019re we going to do once we get out?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Quarantine first. Check for biohazards, memes, all that. Can\u2019t risk it getting out in Area 32.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I meant after. Big first mission, and it seems to be going fine thus far.\n\n\nRoller:\n What are you thinking of?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n I reckon we crack open some cold ones with the D\u2019s. Maybe then Winston will stop thinking enough for me to beat him at cards.\n\n\nBuzz:\n You know he cheats, right?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n What? How?\n\n\nRoller:\n You know that pack of cards Dianne won off Buzz last year? The D-classes have been sharing it around; they all cheat, if they\u2019re good at it.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Why the hell wouldn\u2019t you take it off them?\n\n\nRoller:\n Three reasons. One: they\u2019re more cooperative with it. Two: if you haven\u2019t realised they were cheating, you probably don\u2019t deserve to win.\n\n\nBuzz laughs.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n And three?\n\n\nRoller:\n We\u2019ve been cheating too.\n\n\nSkywalker\n (Under breath): No wonder I\u2019ve never won a damn game\u2026\n\n\nBuzz:\n Cheer up Skywalker, at least now you can get on our level. I\u2019ll show you how to do it when we get back, alright?\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: ten minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nRoller:\n The exit should be just up there.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Should?\n\n\nFootfalls stop.\n\n\nBuzz:\n Sorry sir.\n\n\n(Extraneous audio redacted: fifteen minutes of footfalls against stone or grasses.)\n\n\nRoller:\n There it is.\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Sweet.\n\n\nRoller:\n So\u2026 synopsis of the expedition?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n We walked for an hour, got spooked by the wind along the way, found a lake, came back.\n\n\nRoller:\n Buzz?\n\n\nBuzz:\n That\u2019s what I remember sir.\n\n\nRoller:\n Same for me. Anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n Other than the fact that nothing happened, nope.\n\n\nRoller:\n Nobody got killed?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n No.\n\n\nRoller:\n No pursuits by a primordial curb-stomping deity?\n\n\nBuzz:\n Not that I recall.\n\n\nRoller:\n We just\u2026 came in, took some samples, wandered around, left?\n\n\nSkywalker:\n That sums it up.\n\n\nA moment\u2019s silence.\n\n\nRoller:\n Well then. I\u2026 guess I\u2019ll see you two after quarantine.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement/s:\n D-6, D-7 and D-8 were released from quarantine after 72 hours. No biological hazards, memetic / cognitohazardous infections, memory alterations or other anomalous influences were found on or affecting the team.\n\n\nSubsequent tests involving, and excursions into, SCP-4379 have confirmed a complete lack of any cognitohazardous, memory-affecting, or probability-affecting anomalies, as well as a lack of inhabitation by malevolent or antimemetic entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFile\u00a0Restricted:\u00a0Level\u00a03/4379\n\n\n\n\nShowing\u00a0file.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n\n\n\n\nInternal Memorandum\n\n\nLunar Area-32 \u2013 Site Director Cyrus Hourdoon\n\n\n\n\nThe following information is classified to Level 3/4379 clearance. Personnel divulging this information to individuals with insufficient clearance will be severely reprimanded.\n\n\nAnalysis of the samples taken by Mobile Task Force Sigma-6 (\u2018Puddlejumpers\u2019), Division 9 (\u2018Spacemen\u2019), Agent 8 (\u2018Buzz\u2019) revealed several abnormalities that are not included in the Level 2 or below version of this file. These abnormalities have consistently reoccurred in all samples taken from within SCP-4379.\n\n\nIn agreeance with Ethics Committee Liaison Devlin Winston, these details have been classified in the interest of maintaining on-site morale, and preventing unwarranted speculation or overreactions as demonstrated by MTF Sigma-6 Division-9 Agents 6 (\u2018Roller\u2019), 7 (\u2018Skywalker\u2019) and 8 in the first exploratory log for SCP-4379.\n\n\nThe surface of SCP-4379 is uniformly covered in a thin layer of dead human skin cells.\n\n\nSoil and stone samples taken from throughout SCP-4379 universally contain traces of human DNA in varying states of decomposition, and are significantly composed of decayed and/or compacted human faecal matter.\n\n\nWater samples taken from throughout SCP-4379 universally contain traces of human DNA and contain evidence to suggest they are, or formerly were, predominantly composed of human saliva, sweat, and/or urine.\n\n\nAll DNA samples recovered from SCP-4379 match, but do not match records in any databases accessible to the Foundation.\n\n\nAnalysis of the aforementioned faecal matter suggests the source subsists on a diet consisting exclusively of the flora found within SCP-4379, predominantly the seeds of \nPinus cembra\n var. \nlunae\n.\n\n\n\n\nHover to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\nOn February 8, 2017, the members of a Mobile Task Force engaging in a week-long exploration into SCP-4379 reported discovering a single building south-south-west of the main entrance to SCP-4379 (with \u2018north\u2019 being assigned to the direction the entrance of SCP-4379 is facing). A photograph is attached.\n\n\nThe building was comprised entirely from materials found within SCP-4379, predominantly stone, and showed strong evidence of having been inhabited at an indeterminate point. Numerous stone tablets were found throughout, all of which were engraved with text that appears to be a heavily degraded dialect of, or linguistic descendant of, modern English.\n\n\nSeveral rooms throughout the building were devoted entirely to the storage of large quantities of \nPinus cembra\n var. \nlunae\n seeds.\n\n\nSeveral members of staff have reported seeing glimpses of a \u2018man in black clothing, mid-stride\u2019 approaching the entrance of SCP-4379 from the interior. Comparison of the reported locations of the entity (now designated as SCP-4379-A) in consideration with physical proximity strongly suggests that the entity has approached / is approaching / will approach the entrance of SCP-4379 in an asynchronous order; SCP-4379-A has not yet been sighted outside of SCP-4379.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
