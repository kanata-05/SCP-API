As such, it is not the true file for SCP-4467. However, it acts as such for all personnel without Operation Blah training. To gain access to the true SCP-4467 document, contact Dr. L. K. Tolkien.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4467\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Site-31 containment engineers are to defer to Operation Blah alumni of 4/4467 clearance or higher on issues regarding SCP-4467's containment. At least twenty Operation Blah alumni are to be available in Site-31 for all SCP-4467 related activities (research, relocation, containment, etc.) for at least 12 hours each day. If a week goes by without this requirement being met at least 4 days of the week, a new draft of personnel are to be entered into Operation Blah until it can be met again. Though further containment procedures exist, they are unable to be communicated to personnel without Operation Blah training.\n\n\nSCP-4467 researchers are recommended to enlist in Operation Blah. To enlist, personnel may contact Dr. L. K. Tolkien at Site-31 or at his email, \ntenPiCS.cmod.pcs|neiklotkl#tenPiCS.cmod.pcs|neiklotkl\n. In the event that Dr. L. K. Tolkien is unavailable, contact any personnel of 4/4467 clearance. Be prepared to wait up to two weeks for confirmation or denial.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4467 is a linguistically elusive collection of matter, with conventionally indeterminate size, weight, composition, etc.. It is primarily orange in color, but the majority of other details of SCP-4467 are connected to concepts not conventionally found in any languages on earth. Notably, the languages that come closest are Basque, Japanese, and Veda (as determined by a Department of Miscommunications study which ranked over 1,000 terrestrial languages in terms of how close they come to communicating a wide range of anomalous concepts). Details that are unable to be easily communicated about SCP-4467 include:\n\n\n\n\nShape\n\n\nRigidity\n\n\nAcidity\n\n\nColor (to an extent)\n\n\nTexture\n\n\nDanger\n\n\nMobility\n\n\n\n\nNote that other details are unable to be listed above. In an attempt to subvert SCP-4467's communication inhibiting properties, the \nDepartment of Miscommunications\n has created Operation Blah. Progress is underway.\n\n\nAddendum | Operation Blah\n\nAn intensive program designed to build neurological pathways necessary to communicate about SCP-4467, Operation Blah is run by the Department of Miscommunications (or DoMc) and uses linguistics (including graphology, the study of writing, and paralinguistics) to enable Operation Blah alumni (those that have gone through the program) to read, write, speak of, and more deeply understand anomalously obtuse concepts. Personnel will have more success in Operation Blah if they\n\n\n\n\nare under 30 years of age,\n\n\nare bi- or trilingual,\n\n\nspeak an isolated language,\n\n\nare unfamiliar with etymology, and/or\n\n\ntravel regularly to countries with native languages different to theirs.\n\n\n\n\nFor personnel meeting three of these conditions, Operation Blah has an 80% success rate of instilling an understanding of, and ability to communicate, specific anomalous concepts. Operation Blah has also been found to produce an increase in memetic resistance, a deeper understanding of anomalous languages, and a heightened sense of emotional comprehension in alumni.\n\n\nOperation Blah requires 8 months of uninterrupted training by DoMc personnel of 4/4467 clearance or higher. Operation Blah is most successful if the enlisted personnel are not given any research assignments. However, because this is often unable to be accomplished, DoMc recommends that personnel are not involved in any linguistic anomalies, nor anomalies that in any way affect cognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing clearance\u2026\n\n\n> acc SCP-4467\n\n\nAccessing \nSCP-4467\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram \n4467Precaution\n has intercepted your request and has sent you a prompt.

The containment chamber is to be large and relless to\u00ef, and security cameras are to be checked thrice-ue\u0252ly \n(\u0252)\n (twice-weekly if SCP-4467 is in a state of reduced or mitigated \u00e7eartuus). In a containment breach, a DoMc task force (MTF Null-Alpha, \"Lexiconnoisseurs\") is to felha\u0101-ret\u00f8nt and m\u00f1ell for lipsper kaq\u013e\u00fdrly until SCP-4467 is once again contained.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4467 is a linguistically incompatible v\u00eblented \u015bfur, particularly notable for possessing gjai l\u00e0tettes (as opposed to hy\u00e6 l\u00e0tettes). SCP-4467 has been noted to an\u027euilt\u00e8 b-\u0158an on a semi- or psol-regular basis, which renders it capable of causing near-instantaneous ha\u0101 lexical pa\u012fr\u0259te in victims. The object is abnormally \u00e7eartuuate for a \u015bfurre plot\u0105te to\u00ef and its size, but not to a degree that constitutes a secondary anomaly. SCP-4467's potential for retter and brain activity outside of \u1e96-bounded \u0268tr\u0268 le\u012bpstung is unknown.\n\n\nPosu\u0255kis:\n SCP-4467 is known to induce posu\u0255kis in observers that lack Operation Blah training. Posu\u0255kis is considered a non-anomalous phenomenon (beyond being unnamed in any language), but is currently poorly researched due to being, beyond SCP-4467, rarely achievable. Consequently, it is unknown whether or not posu\u0255kis creates generally positive or negative changes in brain chemistry.\n\n\nPosu\u0255kis can be approximately described as a temporary state, during which a person and/or sapient being thinks without the use of words; it is therefore unachievable through SCP-4467 for any personnel with Operation Blah training, but easily reached for any untrained mind through extended contemplation of SCP-4467. Of note is that posu\u0255kis is often compared with lisp\u00e8sion of Wernicke's area, with the primary difference being that persons experiencing posu\u0255kis remain fully conscious.\n\n\nSo far, limited research has found that sufficiently deep or long-term posu\u0255kis can:\n\n\n\n\nSeverely limit communication skills\n\n\nInduce dyslexia\n\n\nCause spacial disorientation\n\n\nIncrease receptibility to foreign ideas\n\n\nIncrease comprehension of foreign concepts\n\n\nHasten tactile and auditory learning\n\n\nEnhance creativity and local \u00e4nmes\n\n\nEnhance the ability to improvise\n\n\nReduce psychological damage from memes and cognitohazards by an average of 60%\n\n\n\n\nDue to limited research, it has been determined that the safest option is to keep knowledge of posu\u0255kis restricted to Operation Blah alumni and selected SCP-4467 researchers.\n\n\nEDIT 3/16/2024: \nAfter extensive research and tweaking of Operation Blah protocols, a repeatable discipline has been developed that allows the user to voluntarily switch between posu\u0255kis and unposu\u0255kis. Various personnel with \"manual posu\u0255kis\" (or MP) have been given positions in every major DoMc project. Productivity and efficiency have risen 300%, while spending has fallen by 50% per project.\n\n\nIn consequence, the Department of Miscommunications was given the Roger Tarpan Award for Outstanding Departmental Innovation in 2023. This makes DoMc the 8th department to ever win the award.\n\n\nOperation Blah has been considered a success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4466\n | SCP-4467 | \nSCP-4468\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4467\n\" by DarkStuff, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
