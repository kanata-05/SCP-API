The code is to be changed on a monthly basis by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Personnel who wish to examine SCP-331 must ask Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for authorization beforehand.\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 SCP-331 is worn by SCP-331-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-331 is a red plastic cat collar, approximately 23\u00a0cm in length. Metal studs surround the collar in intervals of 1\u00a0cm; testing has confirmed the metal to be nickel. The bell consists of stainless steel electroplated with 24-carat gold. Ringing the bell has no distinguishable effect, adverse or otherwise. The word \u201cTumbles\u201d has been painted on the back of the collar in yellow paint; testing has confirmed that there is nothing unusual about the paint.\n\n\nSCP-331 exhibits no abnormal tendencies when worn by a living cat. When SCP-331 is fastened round the neck of a deceased cat (hereafter SCP-331-1), SCP-331-1 is resurrected with no initial adverse effects. The collar does not halt the decomposition process, however; fur and skin still rot at a regular pace. Organs are unaffected by the decomposition process; testing has yet to determine the exact cause for this. SCP-331-1 shows no signs of distress during the decomposition process. SCP-331-1 can be killed by conventional methods, whereupon it remains deceased. The separation of SCP-331 and SCP-331-1 [DATA EXPUNGED] unless SCP-331-1 is deceased. It should be noted that SCP-331-1 always answers to \u2018Tumbles\u2019 and has an amiable personality, despite what it was called or how it behaved pre-mortem.\n\n\nSCP-331 was discovered when reports reached Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of a \u2018zombie cat\u2019 witnessed around \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Park in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 immediately alerted the Foundation of a possible outbreak of \nSCP-008\n; MTF-\u2588\u2588 was dispatched and neutralized SCP-331-1, whereupon it was transported to Site \u2588\u2588 after no trace of SCP-008 was detected. Upon arrival research was conducted on SCP-331 that confirmed its properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-330\n | SCP-331 | \nSCP-332\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-331\n\" by Jack Rankin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
