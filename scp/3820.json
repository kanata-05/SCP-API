It is to be provided with an adult diet designated for large breed canines twice daily as well as a constant supply of water. The containment unit is also to be decontaminated daily. A Foundation personnel specializing in canine veterinary is to complete a health inspection on SCP-3820 annually.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3820 is a member of \nCanis lupus familiaris\n that is coated entirely in a material similar in texture and appearance to calcite, but is malleable enough to allow for normal movement. Other than the aforementioned anomalous properties, SCP-3820 vaguely resembles and behaves like a 5-year-old, female Golden Retriever.\n\n\nSite-19 security footage of the facility\u2019s lobby has shown the sudden appearance of a bright, blue-colored flash lasting for approximately one second before subsiding, with SCP-3820 manifesting at the center of the flash. Researchers have yet to determine the exact mechanism of SCP-3820's manifestation, or why it appeared at Site-19's lobby.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log-3820-1\n\n\n\n\n\u25c0\u00a0Collapse\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log-3820-1:\n On 08/08/2017, one month after SCP-3820's manifestation, Site-19 administration staff Harvey Black received a phone call from an unknown Person of Interest concerning SCP-3820. The Internal Investigation Department has failed to identify or trace the caller, as if the call never transpired.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the conversation between the unknown caller and Black:\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n Hey pal. Been a long day, so keep it short.\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Oh, sorry to hear that! We\u2019ll get straight to business then. Is this uh\u2026 Site-19?\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n \u2018Is this Site-19?\u2019 The hell are you- wait, what\u2019s your ID number?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Uh\u2026 sorry, don\u2019t have one since unlike you I don\u2019t work for the Foundation! I\u2019m just calling you about Marbs, my dog?\n\n\nBlack activates a silent emergency alert, designating the call to be a potential Level-3 security breach.\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n Hey, hold up, hold up. Before we talk about \u2018Marbs\u2019 or whatever\u2026 how did you get onto this network?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Oh, got your number in the phone book! Right between Site-\u2588\u2588 and Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nBlack receives a directive from Site-19 Security to continue the conversation with the unknown caller and attempt to acquire as much information as possible.\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n Right, right. So, who are you, really?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Just Marbs\u2019 parent, owner and guardian! And speaking of Marbs, I think she\u2019s registered as number thirty-eight\u2026 two-zero in your system?\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n Yeah um\u2026 just looked her up. Our file on \u2018Marbs\u2019 is a bit scant, so tell me more about her.\n\n\nCaller:\n Oh, she\u2019s just the sweetest albeit stiffest sentient canine statue ever! Bit quiet and melancholic though. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019s warmed up to you all already!\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n Very cute, very cute. Right, what\u2019s a\u2026 \u2018sentient canine statue\u2019?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n I\u2019m\u2026 honestly not sure really! Statue dogs just look so cool and so elegant- uh, okay, maybe Marbs\u2019 an exception. That's why I chose Site-19. I heard you guys are really good with living statues!\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n \u2026What the hell is happening? Oh, uh\u2026 how did \u2018Marbs\u2019 get here?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Wow, you\u2019re really blasting me with the Q and As today, huh? Uh\u2026 it\u2019s something to do with [REDACTED], maybe? Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, I-\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n I haven\u2019t got a clue what you\u2019re on about either. I\u2019m just the\u2026 well, guess I\u2019m just the receptionist today.\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Yeah, I get you, I so get you- oh! Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, you said to keep it short and now look at what I\u2019ve done!\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n What? Oh, nah, nah, nah, I got time now-\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n No, that won\u2019t be fair of me, so let\u2019s get back to business! I just wanna let you guys know that I\u2019m picking up Marbs soon, so you all better say your goodbyes to her!\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n The- the hell? Seriously?\n\n\n\n\nCaller:\n Oh, um\u2026 sorry, I should also thank you all at Site-19 for taking care of Marbs! And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve sorted out payment. Hey, it was fun chatting with you today. Really appreciate you putting up with me!\n\n\n\n\nThe caller disconnects.\n\n\n\n\nBlack:\n \u2026That\u2019s it. I\u2019m transferring to Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nOne hour after the phone call, SCP-3820 underwent a spontaneous disappearance event. Security footage has shown the appearance of a bright, blue flash, similar to the manifestation event, lasting approximately one second before subsiding and revealing the disappearance of the subject. Replacing SCP-3820 is exactly one kilogram of [DATA EXPUNGED]. As of the compilation of this incident log, the Foundation\u2019s potential use of [DATA EXPUNGED] is still being debated among the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3819\n | SCP-3820 | \nSCP-3821\n \u00bb",
