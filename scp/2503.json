Civilians are to be deterred from entering under the guise of dangerous building conditions.\n\n\nAt all times, at least two security members for each of Site-2503\u2019s entry points are to remain on site. Anyone who enters SCP-2503-1 without permission is considered lost if reappearance does not take place through SCP-2503-2 within 80 hours. All entities emerging from SCP-2503-2 are to be detained for further questioning and research. Outsiders who access the containment site must be detained, questioned, and administered Class-B amnestics before release. Access is currently available to research personnel with Level-2 clearances only, and SCP-2503-1 should remain open for the duration of non-D-class experiments (See Incident 2503-A).\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2503 is a temporal-spatial anomaly that exists within Site-2503, located within a town about \u2588\u2588 kilometers north of Burnaby, BC, Canada. Site-2503 is a residential house constructed in 1952 and has been unoccupied since 197\u2588, resulting in the current state of disrepair. The previous owners of the house were declared missing in 197\u2588. The room SCP-2503 locates is the master bedroom on the second floor, henceforth referred to as SCP-2503-1. SCP-2503\u2019s anomalous properties are only activated and displayed when someone enters it through SCP-2503-1\u2019s door. Otherwise when observed through another channel \u2013 such as the windows of SCP-2503-1 \u2013 only an empty room is visible. However, upon opening the door of SCP-2503-1, a path made of concrete tiles extending into the horizontal distance can be seen under a dimly illuminated sky with no identifiable light source. This space is assumed to be the inner space of SCP-2503.\n\n\nThe presence of SCP-2503 was discovered in 199\u2588 when local police force received reports of a gunshot being heard from within Site-2503 on the morning of 199\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588. Upon investigation the police team discovered in the garage the dead body of a man in his 30s, who was later confirmed as being Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an architectural designer from Vancouver, BC declared missing 3 days prior. Autopsy has later concluded that his death was due to an act of suicide. During the comprehensive search of the site, the police discovered the presence of SCP-2503 and an embedded agent notified the Foundation, which then quickly took over the case and transformed the house into a containment site.\n\n\nObservations indicate the time and space within SCP-2503 behave differently from our conventional understanding. Due to its nature, subjects that enter SCP-2503 do not age while inside SCP-2503's space. Subjects within SCP-2503 will perceive the passage of time but will not experience it. The speed with which subjects travels within SCP-2503 does not influence the amount of time it experiences.\n\n\nIt is unknown exactly how far the path within SCP-2503 stretches. SCP-2503 connects SCP-2503-1 to a small storage room (henceforth referred to as SCP-2503-2) within Site-2503's garage where a temporal-spatial distortion is detected via Geiger-Gregorian algorithms and traced back to SCP-2503-1. Currently, SCP-2503-2 is the only known exit of SCP-2503-1.\n\n\nAddendum 2503-001: Incident 2503-A\n\n\nDate:\n 199\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n Upon arriving at Site-2503 with the initial containment team, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ventured into SCP-2503-1 by himself. Through his personal intercom he expressed shock that when the door of SCP-2503-1 accidentally closed behind him, it vanished from his perspective within SCP-2503 and was no longer accessible. The containment team outside of SCP-2503-1 then immediately opened the door, but Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was nowhere to be found, despite his insistence that he had not moved since entry. Through the intercom Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 suggested that he should \u201cwalk forward a bit and see where this thing ends.\u201d However, communication soon ceased from his end and no further contact has been established. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was thus declared missing.\n\n\nAddendum 2503-002: Experiments Conducted on SCP-2503\n\n\nExperiment 1\n\n\nSubject:\n A semi-autonomous drone with built-in GPS and camera\n\n\nNote:\n The drone was sent into SCP-2503-1 and began sending back audio-visual feed after the door closed. At this moment, its GPS was no longer able to track its location and soon went offline. Video feed showed that concrete path did not seem to change with distance, and no other visible entity was present. Noteworthy was that despite the 6-hour battery life of the drone, it operated for much longer \u2013 about 39 hours before the signal was lost for unknown reason.\n\n\nExperiment 2\n\n\nSubject:\n D-029-271, equipped with a fully charged intercom and a standard explorer\u2019s kit with sufficient rations for about 3 days\n\n\nNote:\n D-029-271 was sent into SCP-2503-1 and told to walk forward along the path and report any discovery. The intercom equipped on D-029-271 was set to remain online for the duration of the experiment. The first thirty minutes of the experiment were uneventful. However, when the research team outside of SCP-2503-1 asked if D-029-271 wanted to take a break, D-029-271 responded that he did not feel tired, hungry, or thirsty at all, and expressed shock that only thirty minutes had passed, reporting to have felt \u201cas if hours or even days have gone by\u201d. About fifty-three minutes into the experiment, signals from D-029-271\u2019s intercom began to experience interference from within SCP-2503. All communications with D-029-271-2503 ceased at the 56 minute mark. D-029-271 was considered lost at this point.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Addendum\u00a02503-002:\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0from\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Document\u00a02503-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\u00a02503-002:\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0from\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Document\u00a02503-1\n\n\n\n\nThe following document was recovered from the personal belongings of Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. On the floor next to his body where he was discovered, there is a bag containing one Nokia 9110i cell phone, an industrial-sized notepad labeled as the property of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, four Hershey\u2019s candy wrappers, one 1958 issue of Playboy magazine, a standard Foundation personnel field kit, and two wallets (only one of which belongs to Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588). Recovered Document 2503-1 is a selection of entries found inside the notepad.\n\n\nAddendum: Excerpts from Recovered Document 2503-1\n\n\nTo whoever finds this note,\n\n\nI don\u2019t know who or where you might be, but if luck is on your side, let\u2019s hope you did not end up like me, trapped in wherever the hell this place is.\n\n\nMy name is Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and married to Rosaline. Together we were blessed with a daughter, Marianne, who will be turning 2 this year. My address is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 St, Vancouver. If you happen to come across this note by chance, please deliver it to my family \u2013 you may demand some payment for your service.\n\n\nTo be honest, I am not very certain how I ended up here in the first place. I work at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an architectural firm. Things are just like you\u2019d expect of a middle class white collar \u2013 busy, all the time, but fulfilling. Every Friday night my department hosts a pub night for us fellas to blow off some steam after a hard week at work. So I was there this week too, along with a couple of coworkers from other departments. We\u2019ve had some newbies joining so this turned into a welcome party of some sort, and I ended up drinking a little more than I probably should. At some point, I just blacked out completely, but before that I do remember asking Will and Kevin to get me home. It now looks like they didn\u2019t do as they were asked.\n\n\nWhen I woke up I just found myself here \u2013 lying on this path that leads to nowhere. It was funny how the first thing I did was to check my bag and wallet. Nothing was stolen, but I found something that wasn\u2019t there before. It was a folded piece of paper with a pocket watch attached. I thought the paper was written by me at first because of the handwriting but I don't recall ever writing anything like this. It's on the next page for your reference\u2026\n\n\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t take this personally.\n\n\nHenry, you\u2019ve been a great sport. Loved your work, loved your company, loved your outlook on life \u2013 that\u2019s why you're here. From you I learned a great deal about myself, and you are thanked dearly for your mentorship. That\u2019s why I think of leaving with you a little parting gift before I go.\n\n\nConsider this your deserving utopia. Always racing with the clock you were, but at here you are free from that. \nThe time is in your hands, and will only move forward so long as you do.\n It won\u2019t leave your grasp, ever, so you don\u2019t have to run all the time like you once did \u2013 walking is good, and will do.\n\n\nIsn\u2019t this something worth rejoicing over?\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you will find that this is where you truly belong, and you may wander wherever you like. Don\u2019t worry about food and water \u2013 there are more important things that should occupy your mind. If you ever want to leave, just follow the path and let the timer act as your guide to the exit \u2013 it will be a bit of a long walk, but you\u2019ll be fine.\n\n\nAfter all, the time is in your hands.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026I would assume they were left by whoever got me here. In any case, I don\u2019t know who that may be \u2013 interns come and go all the time. Hell, could be that Wesley kid from last month - I knew he'd be trouble if we kept him.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to get into contact with someone for at least 3 days now, but there\u2019s no cell phone signal or sign of anything that\u2019s living. Wherever this place is, it must be deep underground. There\u2019s also no way to tell time here. The clock on my phone is malfunctioning, and my watch stopped a while ago \u2013 that reminds me, there was that pocket watch attached. But it doesn\u2019t display time, or at least doesn\u2019t have the standard clock face. Rather, there\u2019s an electronic display, but it\u2019s not showing anything right now. I haven\u2019t figured out what it does yet. For now, I\u2019ll try to follow the walkway. There\u2019s no sun or moon here, and the vague lighting doesn\u2019t seem to have a source. However, one direction of the concrete walkway extends into the horizon, whereas the other is cut off shortly by darkness. My instinct is telling me to go towards the light. I guess I\u2019ll finish off here. If you are stuck in this space like me, best of luck to you and may you succeed where I fail. If you found this elsewhere, notify the police and my family. Once again, you have my thanks.\n\n\nSigned,\n\nHenry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nThis is Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 writing. I knew how I\u2019ve concluded my earlier note made that seem like my final words, but that was not my intention.\n\n\nAfter going around for a bit (can\u2019t really tell how long), I\u2019m quite amazed by what I\u2019ve seen here. First of all it seems like our understanding of the world doesn\u2019t really apply in this place. By my estimation, it has been at least 30 hours since I woke up, but my cell phone, which usually lasts about 80 hours in standby, is still at about 70% - the same as last night! What\u2019s more amazing is that I haven\u2019t taken in anything since pub, but I don\u2019t feel the slightest hint of hunger or fatigue.\n\n\nAnd on a different note - I think I\u2019ve found how the pocket watch works. It\u2019s actually embarrassing to say, but there\u2019s a little knob on its side (can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice it sooner) \u2013 if you press it a series of numbers appears on the screen for about 5 seconds before disappearing. The numbers also change as I walk. Still don\u2019t know what the numbers mean, but they\u2019re constantly going down for sure. Right now as I\u2019m writing this down, the number shows: 9927-330.\n\n\nAlso, I tried to put myself to sleep earlier. It didn\u2019t work out well because I\u2019m not tired at all, and also that the ground is made of concrete \u2013 probably not the best kind of bed. I\u2019m starting to get kind of worried by the state of my own health, but so far not eating, drinking, and sleeping has yet to take a toll on me. I guess I\u2019ll keep on walking a bit. There\u2019s still no sign of human activity anywhere \u2013 not a single living being is here, but I\u2019ll keep on looking. If I find anything worth noting, I\u2019ll jot it down here. From now on this notepad is my exploration log.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9927-129]\n\n\nSo I suppose it\u2019s time to write down another entry. Unlike the previous 8 times I actually have something of value to say. I have \nbad\n \ngood\n [UNREADABLE] news today. For some time now I\u2019ve recorded down the numbers on the watch each time I make an entry, and I think I\u2019ve figured out what they mean. It\u2026 should\u2019ve occurred to me sooner. I guess it did, but I just couldn\u2019t accept it somehow. Judging by the intervals of how the numbers decrease, the last three digits seem to go down by one every 24 hours. I know it. I can be sure of it. I\u2019ve become increasingly good at consciously counting time by walking. In other words I think it\u2019s a countdown of some sort.\n\n\nStill, it\u2026 may better off be unaccounted for. Here\u2019s my advice, to you, if you are reading this in my situation. Don\u2019t try to count how many minutes, hours, or days you\u2019ve walked. I\u2019ve given up doing that. That just drives you mad. Because your body doesn\u2019t get tired you don\u2019t feel the time passing, but if you slow your mind down to count, you will. Believe it or not, the last time I recall checking the watch consciously is still at 236.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9926-364]\n\n\nAnd there you [UNREADABLE, possibly expletives] go!\n\n\nOh how na\u00efve I have been. At some point I started counting again. I flipped out the pocket watch whenever I thought of it. I bid all of my hope on the moment when 1 drops to 0. I even purposely ignored the 4 digits on the left\u2026\n\n\nI was wrong. I thought that by not feeling hunger or fatigue I can make through this within blinks of my eye, but I am no god! I miss human interaction. I miss my family and friends! Why must I be put through this!? \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried this hard since dad died. But it\u2019s about time to finish up now. I still have to go. I have no reason not to. A moment ago I just saw the picture of Rosaline in my wallet while trying to see if I\u2019ve got any Hershey\u2019s left. And my poor Marianne\u2026 she should be about 4 by now, and 4 without her daddy. Even if it\u2019s just for her, I \nwill\n carry on.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9892-63]\n\n\nToday I made a great mistake. That would be my second greatest of all time. [UNREADABLE] \u2026The thing was some sort of a machine, small but flying. I haven\u2019t seen one myself, but think it is what you call a \u201cdrone.\u201d It\u2019d be one of those things \nJi\n \nDa\n that one guy who I roomed with during my sophomore year in college (it\u2019s been too long) \u2013 he\u2019d be all thrilled about it 'cause he\u2019s in engineering. Shame he wasn\u2019t here. I\u2019d really appreciate the company of just about anyone. Maybe even that drone, but I guess I was just too scared after being alone for so long. Without thinking I went up and attacked it with my bag. The thing was [UNREADABLE] \u2026figured I\u2019d just leave it there.\n\n\nI thought about taking a part of it as a souvenir, but then every time I look at it I\u2019d be reminded of my mistake\u2026 about \nthe missed opportunity of potentially getting into contact with someone outs\n I must not think of it. I\u2019ve learned how to do that now. I\u2019m able to.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9744-306]\n\n\nCan\u2019t believe it's been 7 years since my last entry. I have become inert. By human age, I should have died. Yet I am young still. My thoughts have become senile though, however, but through neither knowledge nor experience.\n\n\nTime passes quickly when one stops thinking, flows like water in a rapid stream - unhindered, unnoticed, and undisturbed. I am no wise, but should learn it was my proof. I will write it down how to do it here: [REDACTED]\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9725-350]\n\n\nA streak of light lit up the sky. For a moment it shone brightly but the next it is gone.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9308-144]\n\n\nMy conscience returns and I decided to sit down for the first time in 174 years. The earlier entries brings back some nostalgia. I'm reminded of some emotions that I thought I had long lost. Before I knew it tears were flowing down my cheek. \u2026 I can't allow myself to think. If I do it would be the end of me. On a separate note, sometime earlier I found something quite unusual on the ground. It was a Playboy magazine from 1958. I can\u2019t recognize anyone except for Lari Laine, whose movies were my teenage favorites. I\u2019ve decided to bring it with me in case I get lonely again in the distances ahead.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9217-31]\n\n\nI found a human being today.\n\n\nBut I don\u2019t know whether to be happy or sad.\n\n\nSupposedly, I should be happy, because at this point any entity besides myself is a solace in this solitude. But I can\u2019t converse to him. He\u2019s just lying there, face-down on the ground, with a hole opened on the side of his head. The poor fella shot himself. I guess he was also trapped here, like me. But he seems well-equipped from head to toe, like an officer of some sort.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. I feel disgusted with what my immediate reaction was. It was neither grief nor angst, but [REDACTED] \u2026After that, I did a thorough search. His belongings came down to a handgun, a tool kit consisting of a flashlight and some small gadgets, a pack of gum, an intercom (seems to be broken), and a personnel ID of an organization. I packed all these with me along with his wallet \u2013 not because I needed the money. I then said an informal eulogy before leaving him. Seeing how he ended up made me clear my mind a bit. I\u2019ve got to get out \u2013 however long it will take.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[9216-172?]\n\n\nThis may very well be my final entry. I\u2019m no different than a dead man now.\n\n\nYesterday\u2026 presumably, I couldn\u2019t really tell how long ago it was, but I finally lost the last bit of control. I began thinking again. I can't help it. I can no longer distract myself. It\u2019s like the urge to jump down when you are at a high place; you're fine at first but the longer you stand on the edge the more you want to just step forward. I tried to pretend to myself that it's all fine. But I can't. I then looked at how long it had been \u2013 almost eight hundred years. For eight centuries now I have walked\u2026 and not even sure where this all leads. What did I even do to deserve this?! In a fit of rage I threw the pocket watch away. It was swallowed up by the darkness behind me before I could change my mind, which I immediately did. I tried going back to search for it, but it just disappeared. I didn't even hear the sound. It took a second before I realized what I've done.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer I will be able to last. I already have nothing to return to. At this point I just want an answer. The handgun inside my bag is luring me, but I\u2019m not about to just let it have its way. I can still do this. I'll take it slow. The time is in my hands.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[????]\n\n\nThought voices were heard, not sure where.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[????]\n\n\nCold.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[????]\n\n\nLost in thought.

This entire thing felt like a blur, but it\u2019s too realistic to be written off like that. I\u2019m almost near the end of my journal and this journey\u2026 so it seems. I can\u2019t tell how long I\u2019ve got ahead, but the sun \u2013 or whatever that\u2019s glowing beyond the horizon \u2013 seems to be rising. Finally, it\u2019s about time for morning twilight.\n\n\n[No Regrets]\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT 2503-1\n\n\nAfterword:\n The journal, upon recovery, was in good condition, giving valuable firsthand observations from within SCP-2503. It should be mentioned that Henry \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is the only individual to have presumably exited the inner space. The timespan between his disappearance and reappearance (~80 hours) is thus taken as the amount of time necessary for a person to exit SCP-2503 via SCP-2503-2. Extensive background research has been conducted on him, his family, and his co-workers to cross-reference the information presented in Document 2503-1 and identify potential persons of interest. Noteworthy discrepancies are being studied at the moment. For instance, Henry\u2019s coworkers at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that prior to his disappearance Henry was experiencing heavy stress from work and began acting erratically. Many recall him acting and speaking differently at times. Those who had attended the pub night the Friday Henry disappeared noted that Henry, a frequent attendant of the event, had declined their invitation saying he needs \"some time to himself\". Rosaline \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and their family doctor commented on Henry\u2019s recently developed tendency to talk to himself out loud, adding that he was suffering from frequent episodes of insomnia. Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 also revealed that only one child is registered under the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 household, who she introduced as being Marty \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, their 13-year old son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2502\n | SCP-2503 | \nSCP-2504\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2503\n\" by Evrien, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Please don\u2019t take this personally. Henry, you\u2019ve been a great sport. Loved your work, loved your company, loved your outlook on life \u2013 that\u2019s why you're here. From you I learned a great deal about myself, and you are thanked dearly for your mentorship. That\u2019s why I think of leaving with you a little parting gift before I go. Consider this your deserving utopia. Always racing with the clock you were, but at here you are free from that. The time is in your hands, and will only move forward so long as you do. It won\u2019t leave your grasp, ever, so you don\u2019t have to run all the time like you once did \u2013 walking is good, and will do. Isn\u2019t this something worth rejoicing over? I\u2019m sure you will find that this is where you truly belong, and you may wander wherever you like. Don\u2019t worry about food and water \u2013 there are more important things that should occupy your mind. If you ever want to leave, just follow the path and let the timer act as your guide to the exit \u2013 it will be a bit of a long walk, but you\u2019ll be fine. After all, the time is in your hands.",

    "description": "SCP-2503 is a temporal-spatial anomaly that exists within Site-2503, located within a town about \u2588\u2588 kilometers north of Burnaby, BC, Canada. Site-2503 is a residential house constructed in 1952 and has been unoccupied since 197\u2588, resulting in the current state of disrepair. The previous owners of the house were declared missing in 197\u2588. The room SCP-2503 locates is the master bedroom on the second floor, henceforth referred to as SCP-2503-1. SCP-2503\u2019s anomalous properties are only activated and displayed when someone enters it through SCP-2503-1\u2019s door. Otherwise when observed through another channel \u2013 such as the windows of SCP-2503-1 \u2013 only an empty room is visible. However, upon opening the door of SCP-2503-1, a path made of concrete tiles extending into the horizontal distance can be seen under a dimly illuminated sky with no identifiable light source. This space is assumed to be the inner space of SCP-2503.",
