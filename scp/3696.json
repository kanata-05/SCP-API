Implanted Foundation agents in major observatories and space programs are to contain images of SCP-3696, research data of its gravimetric effect\n2\n, as well as scientific theories which would cast doubt on the ongoing cover story. An ongoing misinformation campaign is in effect, currently aimed at perpetuating the existence of the Norma Cluster to ease compliance with current physics models. This campaign has thus far been able to completely suppress any knowledge pertaining to SCP-3696 from public awareness.\n\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s DEep spaCE anoMalous oBservER (DECEMBER) satellite is to monitor SCP-3696 from an Earth-trailing orbit and report all sudden activity regarding SCP-3696 to Foundation Observation Sites.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3696 is an intergalactic gravitational anomaly located at the center of the Laniakea Supercluster\n3\n. The anomaly\u2019s position on Earth\u2019s celestial sphere resides within the area of the sky which is obscured by the Zone of Avoidance. This makes SCP-3696 currently impossible to directly observe due to the obscuring effects of the Milky Way\u2019s galactic plane. As such, the properties of this anomaly were determined by noting its measurable effect on galactic clusters across a region of several hundred million light-years.\n\n\nMeasurements taken of SCP-3696 suggest that it is a highly localized concentration of mass many thousands of times more massive than the Milky Way galaxy. Current physics models place such a mass-heavy physical structure as an impossibility. In addition, current gravitational models using data recorded by the Foundation\u2019s \u2018DECEMBER\u2019 satellite suggest that SCP-3696 is attracting the Milky Way\u2019s galactic cluster towards it at a rate of 7.1\u00a0Mm/s.\n\n\nGalactic clusters determined to be opposite SCP-3696 from the Milky Way\u2019s are all blueshifted, in accordance with Hubble\u2019s Law, indicating not only that they are approaching SCP-3696 relative to the Milky Way\u2019s and to each other, but the variations in their blueshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of the anomaly. The variations in their blueshifts cover a range of velocities from about +700\u00a0km/s to +100\u00a0km/s, depending on the angular deviation from the direction to SCP-3696. Variation in velocity was also dependent on distance from SCP-3696, with a range covering \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588m/s to 5.1\u00a0Mm/s. Should the Milky Way follow this velocity trend, galactic \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as a result of SCP-3696\u2019s gravitational influence is expected to occur in \u2588\u2588\u2588 million years.\n\n\nAddendum-1a:\n\nSCP-3696 was first discovered by civilian astronomers in 198\u2588 following a series of observations by X-Ray astronomer Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the target of which appeared to violate the idea of uniform universal expansion. SCP-3696 has only continued to display properties which place it in stark opposition to conventional astrophysical theory.\n\n\nAddendum-2a:\n\nFollowing Event-3696-20\u2588\u2588-09, it is imperative that the Norma Cluster cover story is upheld with the utmost priority. Efforts of Sites tasked with observing SCP-3696 is to be focused on recording any similar incidents, discern how SCP-3696 was able to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 an entire galaxy in just \u2588 hours and develop methods to stop the process.\n\n\n\n\n[+]\u00a0Event-3696-20\u2588\u2588-09:\u00a0Input\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\n[-]\u00a0Credentials\u00a0Approved:\u00a0Showing\u00a0Event-3696-20\u2588\u2588-09\n\n\n\n\nEvent-3696-20\u2588\u2588-09\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Observation Sites:\n Hawaii, Atacama\n\n\nFoundation Satellites:\n DECEMBER\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/09/20\u2588\u2588: 08:20 UTC -\n DECEMBER satellite records a steady growth of Cherenkov radiation coming from the area of space taken up by SCP-3696.
