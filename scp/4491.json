Requests to view SCP-4491 may be submitted to the project head for approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4491 is a 99 minute long video file consisting only of a black screen. While SCP-4491 has an audio track, no audible sound is produced at any point during the video's runtime.\n\n\nSCP-4491 was originally discovered on an internet movie discussion board as a .3g2 media file titled \"pulp ficktion\", uploaded on 2/14/2011 by \u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nHumans viewing more than 7 consecutive frames of SCP-4491 describe the footage in various ways. Despite reports of the footage often varying depending on viewer, the following features have been noted across all depictions:\n\n\n\n\nFocus on a single, consistent scene, regardless of subject's previous exposure to SCP-4491.\n\n\nExtended dialogue scenes, even in instances lacking audio entirely.\n\n\nGratuitous use, and often glorification, of excessive violence.\n\n\nMajority of scenes consisting of a single long take.\n\n\nAll on-screen characters being depicted barefoot.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4491-1:\n SCP-4491 video descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWitnessing Subjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-4977, D-2818\n\n\n[Footage is described as without audio.]\n\n\n\nScene described as a strange diner with a 1950's aesthetic. A plague doctor shares a milkshake with a porcelain mask propped against the napkin dispenser.\n\n\n\nThe shot subsequently pans slowly back, revealing more of the diner as the pair drifts out of focus in the frame. The dance floor is revealed to contain a corn crake stiffly dancing with a pile of fruit snacks, which remains motionless.\n\n\n\nThe shot further widens to reveal a fish-headed figure tied to a chair. The figure displays no visible wounds. Two nondescript subjects\n1\n approach from off-screen. The first subject proceeds to repeatedly punch the fish-headed figure while the second subject begins pouring gasoline on it. Scene proceeds as such for 3 minutes before ending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jack Bright\n\n\n[Footage is described as without audio.]\n\n\n\nScene is described as the basement of a home. The fish-headed figure sits bound in a chair alongside a man wearing an EMU-type spacesuit. A red ballgag is pressed into the fish-headed figure's mouth, and another is affixed tightly across the spaceman's visor.\n\n\n\nA man holding a shotgun\n2\n drifts into frame, and begins conferring with an off-screen figure. While his reflection is visible in the spaceman's visor, no second figure can be seen, though a string of distorted lowercase text is visible in the reflection.\n3\n\n\n\nThe man holding the shotgun brandishes the weapon at the bound pair repeatedly before smiling wickedly and standing. Feed cuts abruptly.\n\n\n\nRemaining 78 minute runtime is devoted to a black and white propaganda film extolling the virtues of capitalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-1843, D-2343, Dr. Cimmerian\n\n\n[Footage is described as accompanied by audio.]\n\n\n\nScene is described as the interior of a diner. Eight figures sit around a circular table around a briefcase. Subjects proceed to discuss United States wage law for 4 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe figure seated at the far left of the frame\n4\n begins speaking over others, and advocating for the destruction of multiple Euclid and Keter anomalies, including SCP-035, SCP-049, and SCP-343.\n\n\n\nThe figure seated at the opposite side of the table\n5\n rises and draws a gun, shooting the primary speaker twice in the chest.\n\n\n\nRemaining figures fall silent and stare at the gun. No significant change occurs for 18 minutes, at which point the briefcase on the table spontaneously opens and the scene ends before its contents are revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-1221\n\n\n[Footage is described as accompanied by audio.]\n\n\n\nScene described as a car interior. In the back seat, a man with a fish's head wearing a suit is bleeding profusely from a wound to the abdomen. A plague doctor drives the car, and a corn crake sits in the passenger seat.\n\n\n\nThe plague doctor alternates between reassuring the wounded figure that it is going to live, and discussing the nomenclature of hamburger sandwiches with the corn crake, who produces no audio.\n\n\n\nAfter 1 minute and 18 seconds, the corn crake turns around in its seat to face the wounded figure and opens its mouth.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle violently ruptures apart from concussive pressure, described as being caused by a 'deafening noise'. Scene ends.\n\n\n\n\n[D-1221 subsequently developed symptoms consistent with acute tinnitus.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Subsequently identified as O5-1 and O5-7\n\n\n2\n. Subsequently identified as Dr. Alto Clef\n\n\n3\n. Text described as difficult to read. Sequence of characters \"u, t, r, u, s, t\" was observed by the subject.\n\n\n4\n. Subsequently identified as Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian\n\n\n5\n. Subsequently identified as a group of 6 raccoons wearing a trench coat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4490\n | SCP-4491 | \nSCP-4492\n \u00bb",
