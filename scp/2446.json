Reports are to be officially scrubbed from record, and people involved in the discovery or documentation of SCP-2446 are to be administered class-B amnestics. All SCP-2446-1 retrieved are to be transported to Site-76 for containment and analysis.\n\n\nShould any SCP-2446-1 manifest partially or entirely inside of a permanent structure, retrieval personnel are to be dispatched to remove the instance and repair affected structures. SCP-2446-1 are to be removed as quickly as possible to minimize chances of civilian discovery.\n\n\nMembers of Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (\u201cWhite Rabbits\u201d) are to be kept unaware of the nature of SCP-2446-1 instances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2446 designates the occasional spontaneous manifestation of humanoid corpses (SCP-2446-1) in a roughly 12 kilometer area of San Jose, California. At least two instances have been directly observed manifesting, and have not demonstrated any limitations of time or location. Certain instances have been found partially or entirely inside of other matter. \u2588\u2588 SCP-2446-1 have been retrieved by Foundation personnel; however, it is unknown how many may be unaccounted for underground or inside permanent infrastructure.\n\n\nAll SCP-2446-1 share physical and genetic profiles with members of Foundation personnel, typically agents involved with Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (\u201cWhite Rabbits\u201d). Multiple such duplicates have appeared for single agents; however, differences (namely in weight, build, tattoo patterns, etc.) have been noticed between instances and related persons (See Addendum for details). Most intact SCP-2446-1 manifest in an early state of putrefaction.\n\n\nSCP-2446-1 tend to appear in dress similar to Foundation-issue Mobile Task Force combat gear. Style and composition of such dress (as well as worn equipment) vary frequently in both style and construction. No instance has manifested in clothing identical to those currently in issue. SCP-2446-1 which do not manifest in MTF gear manifest without any clothes. Although physical factors like weight vary between duplicates, genetic makeup never differs significantly.\n\n\nAddendum: Recovered SCP-2446-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #\n\n\nCircumstance of Recovery\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-A1\n\n\nAlley near Quimby Rd.; partially manifested around refuse.\n\n\nCaucasian male, 1.9m tall, 78\u00a0kg weight. Dressed in Foundation issue combat clothes, with the exception of any armor or equipment. Appeared to have suffered severe compression. Possessed numerous extreme bone fractures, collapsed organs, and lacerations, abrasions, and contusions on skin. Wore tags labeled \u201c\u039b-5: Alex Henderson\u201d. Genetic and physical profile match Foundation agent Alex A. Henderson, currently assigned to MTF Lambda-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-B1\n\n\nAlum Rock Park, beneath stone bridge; manifested into dirt, rocks, and plant debris.\n\n\nCaucasian male, 1.9m tall, 71\u00a0kg weight. Dressed in Foundation issue combat armor. Implanted with subdermal GPS tracking chip on right side of neck, unmarked. Possessed 12\u00a07.62x39mm gunshot wounds on head, torso, and arms. Left side appeared to have suffered minor burn and shrapnel damage. Text \u201cA10441 Wilder\u201d tattooed on left shoulder blade. Genetic and physical profile match Foundation agent Jacob H. Wilder, currently assigned to MTF Lambda-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-E1\n\n\nEmpty classroom, San Jose State University, Building 7.\n\n\nHispanic Male, 2m tall, 71\u00a0kg weight. Stripped nude. Several ballpoint pens appeared to have been manifested internally; numerous internal organ ruptures resulted. Genetic and physical profile match Foundation Agent Patrick Carter, currently assigned to MTF Lambda-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-B2\n\n\nLake Cunningham Park; manifested into lake Cunningham. All solid parts were liquified.\n\n\nBody and all equipment liquified, likely resultant of its in-water manifestation. Retrieved DNA found to match SCP-2446-B1 and Foundation agent Jacob H. Wilder. Large quantities of metal and \nSCP-148\n were found in water following manifestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-D3\n\n\nCoyote Creek at Roosevelt Park. Lower legs, right forearm, and front face liquified, front upper-torso manifested into rocks and topsoil.\n\n\nHispanic female, 1.8m tall, 63\u00a0kg weight. Dressed in Foundation-issue full combat armor, fully-lined with SCP-148, partially damaged. Two 9mm gunshot wounds on head. Genetic and physical profile identical to SCP-2446-D1, -D2, and Foundation agent Melissa King.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2446-B4\n\n\nGuadalupe River Park. Retrieved alive. [REDACTED]\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED] Genetic and physical profile match SCP-2446-B1, -B2, and Foundation agent Jacob H. Wilder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Research Report 2446.21\n\n\nDue in part to recent developments in reality-measuring technology, research and retrieval teams have initiated investigations into potential origins of SCP-2446. Although correlation between recorded Hume deficiencies and SCP-2446 have not been confirmed, certain readings fall outside of acceptable parameters for operation. Based on humological maps of the area, spatial disturbances most likely originate from an apartment complex located at \n2525 N Waterworks St.\n Direct investigation is forthcoming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2445\n | SCP-2446 | \nSCP-2447\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2446\n\" by embertech, tophatlord, zmax15, blithely, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
