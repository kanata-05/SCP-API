Access is permitted only to Foundation personnel specifically assigned to this item. Personnel are required to log all testing of SCP-1577-1, in addition to all materials recovered during testing. In the event that more instances of SCP-1577-1 are discovered, they are to be contained in separate lockers.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1577 refers to two objects, designated SCP-1577-1 and SCP-1577-2. SCP-1577-1 is a flare gun, identical in model to the one utilized by the United Kingdom Royal Air Force since shortly before World War II. The object shows minor wear and damage consistent with its apparent age. However, the serial number has been completely worn away, and analysis suggests this was a deliberate effort. The object functions as would be expected, and is capable of firing any flares of appropriate size (25\u00a0mm.) SCP-1577-1's properties become apparent when fired: any flare fired from SCP-1577-1 burns much hotter, brighter, and longer than would be expected. SCP-1577-1 is also capable of reliably firing in all circumstances, regardless of the condition of the loaded flare.\n\n\nExactly one hour after a flare is fired from SCP-1577-1, a model 685 Avro York transport aircraft, SCP-1577-2, appears sixty kilometers east of the point from where the flare was fired, traveling towards that location with a velocity of 650\u00a0km/h, at an altitude of 8,250 meters. This velocity is approximately 200\u00a0km/h higher than the known maximum velocity of historical models of this aircraft, and the altitude is approximately 1000 meters above the known maximum operational altitude.\n\n\nThere are no immediately apparent spatial anomalies at either point where SCP-1577-2 appears or disappears. However, instruments placed close to expected entry and departure points have shown that the ambient temperature in the immediate area drops by two to three degrees Celsius when SCP-1577-2 reaches them. On materialization, SCP-1577-2 appears to be almost entirely covered in frost, including the engines. This icing does not appear to affect performance of the aircraft at all, and three minutes after SCP-1577-2's arrival, most has melted or fallen away. Analysis of the water that forms this ice reveals no unusual properties.\n\n\nSCP-1577-2 travels over the location from which SCP-1577-1 was fired, and performs an airdrop consisting of one supply crate equipped with a parachute. After performing the airdrop, SCP-1577-2 continues west before vanishing sixty kilometers from the flare point. Given its speed, SCP-1577-2 is only detectable for approximately ten minutes.\n\n\nThe crate dropped by SCP-1577-2 measures 1m x 1m x 1m, and is composed primarily of wood, with several iron nails holding the crate together. Analysis of the crate and its parachute have revealed no anomalous properties. The surface of the crate contains stamping indicating what the crate contains, and in what amount. The supply crate is rarely filled to capacity. Supplies differ with every instance, but take the form of objects apparently intended for military use. Invariably, the contents of the crate display unexpected properties that inhibit their utility, or are outright dangerous. See testing log for further details.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-1577-Testing\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-1577-Testing\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nStated Contents:\n One hundred (100) \"B-Menu\" MRE.\n\n\nDescription:\n Meals Ready to Eat containing sausage, mashed potatoes, beans, and a bar of chocolate. One was opened, and the contents were determined to be uncooked. Labeling indicated that the MRE are cooked using water-activated chemical heating, similar to modern ones.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n The chemical heating process consistently burns at too high a temperature, and results in burnt, inedible food, and on one occasion, a minor chemical fire.\n\n\nStated Contents:\n One hundred (100) bottles of water purification tablets, fifty (50) tablets each\n\n\nDescription:\n Tablets appear identical in composition to modern instances.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Water treated with these tablets found to contain a high concentration of salt. Entirely unfit for human consumption.\n\n\nStated Contents:\n Thirty (30) \"Cold Night\" Raincoats\n\n\nDescription:\n Poncho-style raincoat, with hood, made from nylon.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Unexpectedly porous, and did not adequately keep wearers dry or warm.\n\n\nStated Contents:\n Ten (10) \"Lanchester-Special\" submachine guns, Fifty (50) box magazines of 7.62\u00a0mm ammunition, each containing 32 rounds.\n\n\nDescription:\n Similar to Lanchester submachine guns used by the R.A.F during World War II, except chambered for modern 7.62\u00d751\u00a0mm rounds. The original design for this weapon was exclusively chambered for 9\u00d719\u00a0mm Parabellum ammunition.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Due to insufficiently reinforced components suitable for the increased chamber pressures produced by the ammunition, the weapons displayed a tendency for stoppages, malfunctions, and catastrophic failures.\n\n\nStated Contents:\n Fifty (50) Water Canteens\n\n\nDescription:\n Capable of holding one and a half quarts of water. Containers found to be a poor insulator, and are prone to leaking.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n A handwritten note was found stapled to the side of a crate, reading \"Frequency \u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588 mHz. Call sign Icarus' Wing.
