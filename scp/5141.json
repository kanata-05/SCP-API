Foundation vehicles are to accompany SCP-5141, clearing the road ahead. Vehicles are to maintain a distance of 5 meters from SCP-5141 at all times.\n\n\nPersonnel are to be reminded that no attempt to slow down, stop, or otherwise interfere with SCP-5141 is to be made.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5141 is a black customized 1924 Studebaker Special Six.\n\n\nAt approximately 12:30\u00a0pm (UTC) on March 16th of every year, SCP-5141 emerges at some point within Maggie Valley, North Carolina. It then travels along the shortest available route to Cocke County, Tennessee; upon reaching the county, it gains significant speed and vanishes down one of several local roads.\n\n\nOutside of demonstrating considerable driving expertise and knowledge of local geography, no other anomalous properties have been observed.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On February 26th, 1951, the UIU\n1\n turned over several case-files to Foundation operatives as part of the MJ-12 Act\n2\n. This included reports of a 'driverless ghost-car' active in the Appalachian region. During this transition, William Summers (a veteran Foundation operative) conducted an interview with Daniel Martindale (a UIU field agent and former agent of the Bureau of Prohibition) regarding the nature of SCP-5141.\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 26 February, 1951\n\n\n\n\nSummers:\n So, let me know if I've got this straight.\n\n\nMartindale:\n Fire away.\n\n\nSummers:\n This thing\u2026 it's one of those old-timey cars, right? Like a Ford Model T, or \u2014\n\n\nMartindale:\n She ain't no tin lizzie, son. It's a Studebaker.\n\n\nSummers:\n Right. So, I'm guessing it tops out at, what\u2026 forty miles an hour?\n\n\nMartindale:\n About fifty.\n\n\n[\nSilence.\n]\n\n\nSummers:\n My wife's \nbeetle\n can hit a clean 80.\n\n\nMartindale:\n Well, good for her. Germans made a damn fine car.\n\n\nSummers:\n Christ. You've been on this thing's ass for eight years, and you've never \nonce\n caught up to it?!\n\n\nMartindale:\n Son, you ever try to out-run a one-legged man in his own backyard?\n\n\nSummers:\n I \u2014 Excuse me?\n\n\nMartindale:\n She's been running moonshine down these back-roads for over three decades. Before we chased her, it was the \nprohees\n3\n. I'm gonna tell you the same thing they told us: Leave it be. You ain't catching her, and she ain't doing no harm. Not unless you're dumb enough to get in her way.\n\n\nSummers:\n We're the Foundation. I think we'll manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUISITION REQUEST\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 3 March, 1952\n\n\nREQUESTER:\n Field Agent William Summers\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n Containment of SCP-5141.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 16th of last year, we observed SCP-5141 driving along I-40 West. After a ten minute pursuit, Agent Blackwell attempted to disable its tires with his service pistol. The vehicle immediately swerved into us and ran our vehicle off the road.\n\n\nI'd like to take another crack at it. For this, I'll need two sedans and an agent with significant driving experience.\n\n\n\n\nESTIMATED COST:\n $4k\n\n\nSTATUS:\n \nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\nRESULT:\n \nBoth sedans forced off the road. Personnel sustained minor injuries.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nREQUISITION REQUEST\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2 March 1953\n\n\nREQUESTER:\n Field Agent William Summers\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n Containment of SCP-5141.\n\n\n\n\nAfter discussing SCP-5141 with retired Prohibition agents who have pursued it in the past, we realized it always follows the same route. We just need to barricade the road. I'll need four men with shotguns, three sedans, two concrete barriers, and a strip of road spikes.\n\n\n\n\nESTIMATED COST:\n $8k\n\n\nSTATUS:\n \nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\nRESULT:\n \nSCP-5141 shifted gears, performed a power-slide\n4\n, then drove away. Agents later determined it used an alternate route. Agent Summers was reprimanded for discussing SCP-5141 with non-Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nREQUISITION REQUEST\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 22 February 1954\n\n\nREQUESTER:\n Field Agent William Summers\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n Containment of SCP-5141.\n\n\n\n\nMaggie Valley isn't very large. It only has a few roads leading in and out of it. Let's just barricade them all.\n\n\nI'll need twenty sedans, twenty men with shotguns, twelve concrete barriers, and six strips of road spikes.\n\n\n\n\nESTIMATED COST:\n $35k\n\n\nSTATUS:\n \nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\nRESULT:\n \nSCP-5141 did not appear at the barricades. On further investigation, tire tracks were found matching its make and model along a previously unknown back-road leading out of Maggie Valley and onto I-40 West. Agent Summers has received two weeks mandatory vacation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nREQUISITION REQUEST\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 10 February 1955\n\n\nREQUESTER:\n Field Agent William Summers\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n Containment of SCP-5141.\n\n\n\n\nSix customized trucks and five of the best drivers we've got.\n\n\n\n\nESTIMATED COST:\n $20k\n\n\nSTATUS:\n \nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\nRESULT:\n \nAll six trucks forced off the road.
