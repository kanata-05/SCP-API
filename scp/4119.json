An internal cavity magnetron maintains a constant low-wattage stream of microwaves within the chamber; all internal surfaces are kept at a temperature of 50\u00b0C. The walls of SCP-4119's cell are equipped with rapidly oscillating motors, vibrating them continuously. SCP-4119 itself is kept inside a Level 2 Thermal Isolation suit.\n\n\nOnce per week, SCP-4119 is to be sedated, blindfolded, restrained, and moved to a temporary cell. During this, the cell walls are to be cleaned of burnt blood residue and the vibration and microwave equipment inspected and maintained as needed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4119 is a young adult Hispanic female, identifying as \"Thalia Contreras\".\n\n\nSurfaces within the central 11\u00b0 cone of SCP-4119's line of sight excrete films of an oily, explosive liquid. SCP-4119's vision will trigger liquid uncontrollably up to a range of approximately 700m; beyond this, SCP-4119 must exert itself physically to cause liquid excretion.\n\n\nLiquid produced by SCP-4119 is 71% nitroglycerin and 29% human blood; this blood does not genetically match SCP-4119. SCP-4119's skin is abnormally thick and heat-resistant, protecting it from the heat and force of the detonations of its liquid.\n\n\nAcquisition:\n On 02/19/2017, a Type 3A dimensional anomaly appeared in the air, approximately 10km from Site-496, violently ejecting SCP-4119 and fragments of a concrete room into the surrounding woods. MTF Mu-8 (\"Southern Hospitality\") was dispatched.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4119\u00a0Encounter\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken during initial containment of SCP-4119.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF:\n Mu-8 (\"Southern Hospitality\")\n\n\nPersonnel:\n M8-Marquez, M8-Linares, M8-Sanchez\n\n\nDate:\n 02/19/2017\n\n\nSubject:\n Dimensional aperture and material ejected.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nM8-Marquez:\n Dammit. Portal's gone already. Readings match a type three-A. Linares, Sanchez, any visual on anything ejected before it closed?\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n Didn't see anything but we'll keep an eye out.\n\n\nM8-Linares:\n Hang on, there's a big crater over here.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4119 is lying still in a crater about 30m wide. It is wearing heavily charred armor over a torn bodysuit, and a pair of oversized goggles. Multiple sun-like insignias are visible on the armor.\n)\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n I got visual on the entity. Humanoid, unconscious, wearing some kind of orange and black armor.\n\n\nM8-Marquez:\n Excellent. Load it on an ATV and keep sweeping the area.\n\n\nM8-Linares:\n Metallic fragments all over the place in this direction, might wanna scan these first.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4119 awakens and stands up, rubbing its head.\n)\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n It's up!\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Who's there?\n\n\n(\nSCP-4119's goggles explode, and their fragments fall off SCP-4119's face.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Shit!\n\n\nM8-Linares:\n (\ninto comm\n) Subject conscious, preparing to engage.\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Oh god, my head. Wait, who's there?\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Think so. Where the hell am I?\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n Northern Minnesota; this is State Patrol\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Hold on, Minnesota?! (\ntowards the sky\n) Did you really think that would work, Victory? I'll break your neck once I get back there!\n\n\nM8-Sanchez:\n Come with us and we'll sort this out.\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n How stupid do you think I am? We blew the Coven headquarters to hell a year ago, not 100 miles away from here. I bet you guys got Valkyrie drones and anky-tanks and shit in the woods ready to pick me off but I ain't got time for this.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4119 removes its mask and throws it away. Smoke begins to emanate from its closed eyes.\n)\n\n\n(\nM8-Marquez throws a smoke grenade.\n)\n\n\nM8-Marquez:\n I don't know what you think is going on, but we're not whoever you think we are. Last chance to clear this up peacefully.\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Bring it.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4119 opens its eyes, and the tree stump next to M-8 Marquez explodes, throwing him to the ground.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4119:\n Whoa, that's\u2026 not right.\n\n\nM8-Linares:\n (\ninto comm, quietly\n) Subject hostile, explosive anomaly, resistant to gunfire, requesting immediate backup.\n\n(\nM8-Linares and M8-Sanchez open fire on SCP-4119 to no effect, until SCP-4119 detonates a large cluster of trees behind them.\n)\n\n\n(\nMTF agents get up and find cover.

So how about this.
