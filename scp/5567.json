Personnel wishing to access SCP-5567 with clearance level below SCP-5567/2 must gain permission from project director Researcher Oliver Crane or project lead Senior Researcher Kelly Apple.\n\n\nPost 19/12/2019 Additions:\n No physical changes may be made to any copy of SCP-5567 upon discovery without direct permission from project director Researcher Crane. Any person found guilty of doing so will be removed from working with SCP-5567, and reported to Site Director Lilith Miles.\n\n\nUpdate 25/09/2019:\n Due to the unknown nature of SCP-5567-1's anomalous development, testing has been temporarily suspended. Only the aforementioned personnel may access SCP-5567.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5567 title card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5567 is a direct-to-video, subtitled, pilot episode of a Japanese anime titled \n\"\u6d77\u8fba\u306e\u8b0e\"\n1\n. A label on the back cover claims it was distributed by a believed-to-be nonexistent \"East Blue Productions\"; investigation is ongoing.\n\n\nThe plot of SCP-5567 involves a detective named Toshiro Arikawa (SCP-5567-1) investigating a spike in missing person cases in the fictional seaside town of Michikomio, Japan. Although locals claim a yokai\n2\n is responsible, Toshiro remains skeptical. Every twenty-four-hours following the previous successful viewing of SCP-5567, the culprit of the disappearances changes, along with corresponding scenes and other details relating to the mystery.\n\n\nDiscovery of SCP-5567-1\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 is an emergent awareness embedded in the character of Detective Arikawa, which developed upon repetitive viewing during preliminary Foundation testing.\n3\n\n\nDuring testing, SCP-5567-1 gradually became aware of its status as a fictional character. Evidence of this included:\n\n\n\n\nDialogue by SCP-5567-1, considered unfitting to the scene\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 appearing late to scenes\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 not appearing in scenes\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 responding to remarks made by Foundation personnel in the room\n4\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 failing to speak for extended periods of time\n\n\n\n\nTesting has revealed SCP-5567-1 is aware of when SCP-5567 is being watched, its place as a character in a direct to video anime, and the year SCP-5567 was supposedly created.\n5\n Additionally, testing has revealed that SCP-5567-1 is aware of previous iterations of itself, interactions with viewers, and plot resolutions. For more information uncovered during testing with SCP-5567-1, see the addendums below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 01\nClose Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5567-1 Interview Log 01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5567-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Kelly Apple, Researcher Daichi Fox\n\n\nObjective:\n To learn what exactly SCP-5567-1 knows about itself, its creation, and the world around it.\n\n\nNote:\n As SCP-5567-1 can only communicate in Japanese, Researcher Fox, fluent in English and Japanese, translated for both parties.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Apple:\n I am only going to say this once.

Please be more responsive to the questions.\n\n\nSCP-5567-1:\n Can't right now, doc. My schedule is a bit backed up at the moment, what with the murders and all.\n\n\n[SCP-5567-1 taps his pen against his notepad, and sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-5567-1:\n The murders\u2026\n\n\nDr. Apple:\n SCP-5567-1, I need you to answer me\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5567-1:\n I was not alive before. I would have appreciated some company within Michikomio. Outside company is not unwanted, but you seem quite incompetent and a bore to listen to. Talk to me when you get a better doctor to do it for you. And please, my name is Toshiro Arikawa.\n\n\n[At this point, SCP-5567-1 looks at the camera and gently pushes it away.

A little further down the coast, maybe, but never went out that far.\n\n\nFox:\n Why not?\n\n\nArikawa:\n Heh, I'm suicidal, not insane. Traveled down the coast for a shopping trip one time, halfway to the next town I started unravelling. \n[takes a drag]\n Could feel ink dripping from my back, the car almost falling apart from the weight of an animator's pencil pressing against it.

He is holding a lit cigarette between his fingers.]\n\n\nFox:\n Hello Detective Arikawa. How are you today?\n\n\nArikawa:\n \n[looks at the screen]\n. Ah, Fox. Hey kid.\n\n\nFox:\n You know, you only look a few years older than me, but you call me kid. And please, call me Daichi.\n\n\nArikawa:\n I can't see you, remember.\n\n\nFox:\n I'm thirty.\n\n\nArikawa:\n Thirty-five going on fifty.\n\n\nFox:\n See? We're about the same age.\n\n\n[Fox shuffles in his seat.]\n\n\nFox:\n Anyways, to the point. I would like to ask you about the yokai that you encounter.\n\n\nArikawa:\n \n[takes a drag of his cigarette]\n What about em'?\n\n\nFox:\n For starters, \n[flips through notes]\n the lady with a thousand faces, she was just the shop keep, right? When you see the shopkeep after that, how do you think of her?\n\n\n[Arikawa closes his eyes, taking a deep sigh.]\n\n\nArikawa:\n I can't think anything. If I thought anything special, it would interfere with my ability to go on.\n\n\nFox:\n Why do you continue to solve the mysteries? What is making you?\n\n\nArikawa:\n Justice.\n\n\n[Arikawa takes another drag of his cigarette, then throws it to the ground, crushing it beneath his heel.]\n\n\nArikawa:\n I know everyone in Michikomio is an empty shell of themselves. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna let them suffer 'cause I am.\n\n\nFox:\n Do you feel as if solving these mysteries gives you a sense of belonging?\n\n\nArikawa:\n \n[chuckles]\n Would you believe me if I said no?\n\n\nFox:\n I'm curious, why?\n\n\nArikawa:\n If I don't solve a case, twenty-four-hours later, there's a new one. A little girl is ripped apart in front of me and I'll watch her buy candy from a vendor the next day. All I do is give them a temporary good ending.\n\n\nFox:\n Then why do you still do it?\n\n\nArikawa:\n Just because I'm suffering doesn't mean these husks have to. It doesn't feel right to leave things because \nI'm\n upset. The least I can do is avenge them, maybe fulfill their spirits' need for vengeance, if only for a little while.\n\n\nFox:\n That's very admirable.\n\n\nArikawa:\n I suppose.\n\n\n[As he says that, a female figure appears on the top of a hill in the distance, waving to Akiwara.

For the archived logs, see \nSCiP-ARC/5567 Interviews\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT\n\n\nMultiple unnamed sources have claimed that the recipient of this memo, \nDAICHI FOX\n, has been conducting interviews deemed unproductive in the development of an anomaly under their care, \nSCP-5567-1\n.\n\n\nThis memo is to be considered a warning. Any further complaints made towards you will be referred to your supervisor for further resolution.\n\n\nAdditional: To increase productivity, \nDAICHI FOX\n will be accompanied with every interview with \nSCP-5567-1\n until given approval to act independently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nStepping\u00a0Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n kellyapple@SCiPnet\n\n\nFrom:\n daichifox@SCiPnet\n\n\nSubject:\n Stepping back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe it is in the best interest of the case for me to distance myself from SCP-5567-1. After receiving the memo, I was forced to realize that I have been \ntoo\n focused on trying to gain his trust. Although I'd like to be there to watch the progression of the anomaly and be there for him if he needs it, it seems like he's willing to cooperate without my advice at this point.

It was reluctantly explained that Researcher Fox chose to stop directly interacting with SCP-5567-1. It appeared to take comfort in the fact that Researcher Fox had not been forced to stop interacting with it, finding his reasoning \"noble\" which aided in its further cooperation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProgress as of 09/09/2019:\n SCP-5567-1 has been observed to have gained full/near full control of itself and its surroundings. Sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing at a steady pace, relative to number of interations SCP-5567 has undergone.\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. Marvin Waters\n\n\nUpdate as of 12/09/2019:\n SCP-5567-1's sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing in larger amounts than previously documented.\n\n\nNew properties include:\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to change which predetermined scene is occurring at will (if it chooses to partake in such scene)\n7\n\n\nThe ability to make objects appear\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-5567-1's physical appearance has been altered. It now looks disheveled, opposed to the clean-cut appearance seen previously.\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. Kelly Apple\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUpdates as of 25/09/2019:\n SCP-5567-1 has become almost non-responsive to Foundation personnel. Although no current threat to containment has been made, it has been decided that SCP-5567-1 testing will be brought to an indefinite halt. Contact Researcher Crane or Dr. Apple for any questions regarding this decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Security Log 5567-TEST-D 29/11/2019\n- Close Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12:25\n \n[Researcher Kelly Apple is seen walking purposefully down the hall containing the testing chamber used for SCP-5567, holding an autotranslator and SCP-5567.

After power was restored, it was discovered that substantial modifications had been made to SCP-5567, including the physical removal of a portion of the tape, which included the timestamp that the murders occurred within. It is unknown who, if anyone, is responsible for this vandalism. The emergent intelligence has been unaffected by the alteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Incident 19/12/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Fox put in for a transfer after the above incident, which was granted. Upon vacating his lodgings at the Site, the following correspondence was found.\n8\n\n\n\n\nArikawa-San\n\n\nWhile I am sure you won\u2019t get to read this, possibly some member of the research staff will take pity on me and read it to you. I won\u2019t take too much of your time.\n\n\nI sincerely apologize to you. While I understand I violated your boundaries, at the time, I felt as if I was doing so for the right reasons. Please be assured that I am no longer a part of the research staff here, and you won't have to interact with me anymore. I am transferring because I feel I have lost my objective, and want to give you peace of mind.\n\n\nI hope someday you will come to forgive me.\n\n\nAll my love,\n\n\nDaichi Fox\n\n\n\n\nUpon locating this correspondence, Dr. Apple requested a full enquiry be made into Researcher Fox\u2019s behavior.

        "Interviewed: SCP-5567-1 Interviewer: Dr. Kelly Apple, Researcher Daichi Fox Objective: To learn what exactly SCP-5567-1 knows about itself, its creation, and the world around it. Note: As SCP-5567-1 can only communicate in Japanese, Researcher Fox, fluent in English and Japanese, translated for both parties. <Begin Log> Dr. Apple: I am only going to say this once. Detective Arikawa, you will now be known as SCP-5567-1. Do you understand me? [SCP-5567-1 leans back in his chair and looks to the sky.] SCP-5567-1: The voices in my head seem quite active today. Maybe I should go to a shrink like Aoi tells me to. Dr. Apple: My name is Dr. Apple, and I'm here to interview you. Next to me is Researcher Fox. Please be more responsive to the questions. SCP-5567-1: Can't right now, doc. My schedule is a bit backed up at the moment, what with the murders and all. [SCP-5567-1 taps his pen against his notepad, and sighs.] SCP-5567-1: The murders\u2026 Dr. Apple: SCP-5567-1, I need you to answer me\u2014 SCP-5567-1: I was not alive before. I would have appreciated some company within Michikomio. Outside company is not unwanted, but you seem quite incompetent and a bore to listen to. Talk to me when you get a better doctor to do it for you. And please, my name is Toshiro Arikawa. [At this point, SCP-5567-1 looks at the camera and gently pushes it away. By the next perspective shift, SCP-5567-1 has disappeared from the frame.] <End Log> Observations: SCP-5567-1 does not appear to be capable of viewing observers.

To this end, Researcher Fox is conducting the interview. Note: Interview conducted in Japanese. <Begin Log> [Detective Arikawa is sitting on a piece of driftwood on the beach, attempting to light a cigarette. A stormfront is brewing, though the sunset is beautiful.] Fox: Hello, Detective Arikawa, I was wondering if I could speak with you. Arikawa: Jesus, can a man take a smoke in peace? I already told you doc, I don't want nothing to do\u2014 Fox: No, no, you misunderstand, sir. I was merely a translator for my supervisor, Apple. My name is Daichi Fox. Arikawa: Ah. I suppose I could give someone new a chance. Especially since you're using my name. My real name. [Arikawa takes a deep drag of the cigarette and exhales, watching the cloud drift away.] Arikawa: Now go on, say your piece. I'll leave when I'm done with this cigarette. Fox: Oh\u2026 okay, ah\u2026. How did you feel when you first gained\u2014 first became aware of your surroundings. Arikawa: Shitty. Fox: Okay\u2026 what do you want to do with your life? Arikawa: Well, I would kill myself, but I wouldn't know what to do after that. [takes a drag] Fox: Not that much of a planner, eh? Arikawa: What can I say, I'm more of an action man than a thinking man. [Thundering is heard in the distance.] Fox: Not a bad way to be. Aren't you afraid it's going to rain? Arikawa: Nah, it never rains around here this time. A little further down the coast, maybe, but never went out that far. Fox: Why not? Arikawa: Heh, I'm suicidal, not insane. Traveled down the coast for a shopping trip one time, halfway to the next town I started unravelling. [takes a drag] Could feel ink dripping from my back, the car almost falling apart from the weight of an animator's pencil pressing against it. I didn't feel\u2026 finished. Turned around like a [chuckles] fox with its tail between its legs. Fox: You say that so casually. That you're suicidal. Arikawa: It's nothing to make a fuss of, not to me. [Arikawa takes one final drag of his cigarette, and crushes it beneath his heel.] Arikawa: Well, there's that. Nice talking to you, kid. Fox: You too.

But that doesn't mean I'm gonna let them suffer 'cause I am. Fox: Do you feel as if solving these mysteries gives you a sense of belonging? Arikawa: [chuckles] Would you believe me if I said no? Fox: I'm curious, why? Arikawa: If I don't solve a case, twenty-four-hours later, there's a new one. A little girl is ripped apart in front of me and I'll watch her buy candy from a vendor the next day. All I do is give them a temporary good ending. Fox: Then why do you still do it? Arikawa: Just because I'm suffering doesn't mean these husks have to. It doesn't feel right to leave things because I'm upset. The least I can do is avenge them, maybe fulfill their spirits' need for vengeance, if only for a little while. Fox: That's very admirable. Arikawa: I suppose. [As he says that, a female figure appears on the top of a hill in the distance, waving to Akiwara. He tiredly raises his hand in response.] Akiwara: That's my cue, we're almost at the climax. See you later, Daichi. Fox: Good luck. Akiwara: [chuckles and shakes his head.] Don't need it, but thanks. <End Log>",
        "<Begin Log> 12:25 [Researcher Kelly Apple is seen walking purposefully down the hall containing the testing chamber used for SCP-5567, holding an autotranslator and SCP-5567. She flashes her ID to the guards, who let her pass.] 12:26 [Apple enters the chamber, and loads SCP-5567-1 into the dedicated television within the chamber.] 12:27 [She attempts to play SCP-5567, but it only shows the credits. Apple has a look of annoyance as she rewinds the tape and plays it.] 12:28 [After the introduction, she forwards SCP-5567 to a scene showing SCP-5567-1 in the Michikomio Library. SCP-5567-1 appears disheveled, with wrinkled clothing and greasy, stringy hair.] 12:29 [Apple attempts to get the attention of SCP-5567-1, but is ignored. Apple angrily attempts to tap on the television screen, to the same response.] 12:30 [Apple looks around for a moment, and starts talking to SCP-5567-1, quietly at first but gets more animated as she continues. SCP-5567-1 tries to ignore her still but something Apple says catches his attention.] 12:33 [SCP-5567-1 and Apple begin a back-and-forth conversation, talking and gesturing. As Apple speaks SCP-5567-1 becomes more withdrawn.] 12:34 [Apple looks worried, and asks SCP-5567-1 a question. After a moment of hesitation, SCP-5567-1 tells her something. Apple sits ramrod straight, says one last thing to SCP-5567-1, ejects SCP-5567 and walks out of the chamber.] <End Log>",
        "<Begin Log> 01:05 [During a guard shift exchange, Researcher Fox is seen walking down the hall. He attempts to walk casually, but looks nervous.] 01:06 [Fox enters the chamber, closes the blinds and locks the door. He reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out a VHS tape.] 01:07 [The television blares the intro music and title card for SCP-5567, which causes Fox to hastily lunge towards the television to hit the pause button, before lowering the volume and unpausing SCP-5567.] 01:07 [Fox fast forwards through the establishing shots of SCP-5567, stopping at the first shot including SCP-5567-1, where he is sleeping in his house.] 01:08 [Fox taps on the screen, waking SCP-5567-1 up. Fox begins to talk animatedly to SCP-5567-1 in Japanese.] 01:10 [After a while, Fox stops talking, and looks concerned, he asks a question. SCP-5567-1 replies in a snappy tone of voice.] 01:11 [Fox attempts to respond, his shoulders slumping as he does so, but is interrupted by SCP-5567-1, who launches in a tirade against Fox. ] 01:13 [SCP-5567-1 ends his tirade, and Fox tries talking to him in a soft tone.] 01:15 [The video cassette is forcibly ejected from the television set, landing in Fox's lap. He puts his face in his hands and doesn't move for several minutes, before getting out of his chair and exiting the chamber.] <End Log>",
        "Arikawa-San While I am sure you won\u2019t get to read this, possibly some member of the research staff will take pity on me and read it to you. I won\u2019t take too much of your time. I sincerely apologize to you. While I understand I violated your boundaries, at the time, I felt as if I was doing so for the right reasons. Please be assured that I am no longer a part of the research staff here, and you won't have to interact with me anymore. I am transferring because I feel I have lost my objective, and want to give you peace of mind. I hope someday you will come to forgive me. All my love, Daichi Fox",
