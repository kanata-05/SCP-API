While conducting initial geological testing for the Aswan Low Dam renovation, Suez Canal Company workers accidentally breached an underwater chamber, releasing a flow of viscous white fluid. Workers 15 meters from the Lake Nasser embankment made physical contact with the fluid and experienced immediate glossolalia.\n.\nglossolalia:\n The phenomenon of speaking in an unknown language. Known colloquially as \"speaking in tongues.\"\n\n\nLanguage interpretation officials\n.\nThe Suez Canal Company employed a multitude of national and international specialists during its pre-Suez Crisis management of the Suez Canal region, which includes American, British, French, Saudi, and Egyptian nationals.\n identified the glossolalia as pre-Ptolemaic Era Egyptian. The phenomenon affected one Maat Mohamed (designated Person of Interest #11366) for the next three days. Mohamed later underwent medical evacuation at St. Sophia's Asylum \u2014 a Foundation-owned medical facility \u2014 under the guise of demonic possession affecting his memetic health. He became the first recorded vector for SCP-3739-1 phenomena.\n\n\nThe following is a translated excerpt of a key phrase spoken by Mohamed:\n\n\n\n\n\"Bat,\n.\nBat:\n The name of a Middle Egyptian goddess associated with femininity and fertility, typically depicted as a cow or ox.\n \nmy Earthly mother. She leads me out of the depths of my head. She says it is nutritious. Should I siphon the teat?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhilst in the recreational room at St. Sophia's Asylum, Mohamed imitated marketing jargon from commercials and shows played on television. He produced SCP-3739-1 marketing jargon after viewing Coca-Cola advertisements.\n.\nCorporate advertisements used minor compulsion memetics (which POI-11366 was likely affected by) until the UNGOC Extranormal Advertisement Act passed in 1961. \nMoosphere\n falls outside legal jurisdiction because of its location in metaphysical space.\n A week into his inpatient stay, Mohamed lactated, flooding his room. Mohamed displayed no further anomalous properties over the course of his month-long psychiatric containment.\n\n\nThree months after his release, Mohamed fled Egypt, escaping Foundation surveillance. Local law enforcement discovered his apartment abandoned, containing the following materials:\n\n\n\n\nPublications by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Sigmund Freud.\n\n\nBooks on cattle farming and entrepreneurship.\n\n\nSeveral documents indicating plans to establish a dairy farm.\n\n\nA bathroom containing 200 liters of curdled milk in the sinks, toilet, and bathtub.\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation became aware of \nMoosphere\n in 20\u2588\u2588 following a sudden influx of online and television advertisements flagged with memetic and cognitohazardous properties. The advertisements drew a similarity to POI-11366's behavior, prompting a formal investigation.

Can't imagine you were getting much sleep on those long nights out anyway. What's with the change in occupation?\n\n\nDrauss:\n I was conscripted. See, it starts slowly. You get fatigued. So, you put a little more cheese in your diet, maybe pour a little more skim milk in your decaf. Espresso won't work. Pills won't work, and some days you collapse from exhaustion. And when the coma hits? \n[\nHe drops his palms to his lap.\n]\n That means you're hired.

The livestream, entitled \"Sights of Wausaukee, Northeastern Wisconsin,\" displayed normative footage of the town's attractions interspersed with shocking imagery of large, writhing, gelatinous bovine masses. Simurgh.aic could not determine a geolocation and blocked the stream.\n\n\nFoundation officials investigated Wausaukee as part of a mandatory sweep for anomalous threats. An attached crew of field pataphysicists detected an aberrant mass of 150,000 individual bovine memes in and around the town, most of which centered on a 640\u00a0m\n2\n area. MTF-Eta-33 members initiated further investigation, and with the help of pataphysicists, tracked the memes to a nearby warehouse at the town's outskirts.\n\n\nA raid on the facility was scheduled for the following evening. Aware of the pataphysical findings, Site-82 Command became convinced of a likely risk to civilian populations and authorized the use of esoteric materials to combat potential oneiric threats and anomalous dairy entities.\n\n\n\n\nEXPLORATION TEAM:\n MTF-\u03b7-33\n\n\nTEAM MEMBERS:\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7-1 / Samara Maclear\n\n\n\u03b7-2 / Eli Hall\n\n\n\u03b7-3 / Allen Foxglove\n\n\n\n\nTEAM NOTES:\n Task force specialists were selected based on:\n\n\n\n\nTheir teamwork skills.\n\n\nPataphysical markers pointing to their archetypal significance, necessary for an operation of this nature.\n\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n\n\n\n\nThree sets of standard Spectra-fiber body armor.

On arrival, the cast iron and steel roofing were partially collapsed, leaving a large breach above the warehouse.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG | 09:47 PM]\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab9:47:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 and \u03b7-3 hold position outside the front entrance. \u03b7-2 operates a quadcopter drone over the exposed roof.\n\n\n\u00ab9:50:\u00bb\n The drone enters a dimly lit interior containing 25 docile cows inside compact rooms, guarded behind slide-doors. The cows display fitted metallic portholes on their left flank and udders.\n\n\n\u00ab9:52:\u00bb\n Manure and hay compositions surround a hole directly beneath the roof's breach. Gelatinous purple tubing networks lead out of the hole and crisscross between compact cow stalls.\n\n\n\u00ab9:57:\u00bb\n The drone feed captures generic farming utilities, fertilizer, and seed bags.\n\n\n\u00ab9:58:\u00bb\n Small outlines move within bushes near \u03b7-1's camera. \u03b7-1 shines her flashlight at the location of movement. After a moment, \u03b7-1 states, \"\nNegative sighting, remain alert\n.\"\n\n\n\u00ab9:58:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 gestures an \"all-clear\" signal. \u03b7-2 places the drone on auto-pilot and nods to \u03b7-3. \u03b7-3 installs a breach charge at the facility's front doors. The three pile behind a breaching blanket.\n\n\n\u00ab9:59:\u00bb\n The charge detonates. \u03b7-3 enters the facility, followed by \u03b7-2 and \u03b7-1.\n\n\n\u00ab10:01:\u00bb\n The team proceeds through a tight windowless vestibule into a wide foyer. No persons are present within, and the interior lacks light sources. Team members activate night-vision.\n\n\n\u00ab10:04:\u00bb\n The team makes a thorough sweep of the area, and two-thirds of the way down, turns left. They encounter a door, ajar, to an open office space. The office displays hundreds of laminated posters, each sporting motivational messages overlaid onto stock images of persons consuming dairy products.\n\n\n\u00ab10:06:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 discovers milk leaking from the ceiling. Drone feed captures undulating movement from no discernible source. \u03b7-2 whispers, \"\nIt's coming from everywhere\n.\"\n\n\n\u00ab10:07:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 takes a milk sample, enclosing it in a rally bag. The milk emits a faint green bioluminescence.\n\n\n\u00ab10:08:\u00bb\n \u03b7-3 leads the team into an antechamber at the back of the office and claims he \"\nsmells a sulfuric scent\n.\" \u03b7-1 activates electro-photonic sensors and registers aetheric radiation\n.\nA byproduct of aetheric energy, which powers all Thaumatology.\n leaking from an adjacent chamber.\n\n\n\u00ab10:09:\u00bb\n \u03b7-3 pushes into the next chamber, which is filled with curdled milk. \u03b7-3 opens a metal door, drawing his carbine. A cow comes into view, mooing. Aetheric emission flows from its posterior, consistent with bovine flatulence.\n\n\n\u00ab10:11:\u00bb\n The team returns to the foyer, traveling east through winding halls.\n\n\n\u00ab10:15:\u00bb\n A tremor shakes the facility, followed by a long bovine vocalization. \u03b7-1's milk sample vibrates and grows ten times in volume. She abandons the sample.\n\n\n\u00ab10:18:\u00bb\n \u03b7-3 reports a 3-meter-wide teat intersecting through support columns. The teat leaks faint green fluids.\n\n\n\u00ab10:19:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 makes incisions into the teat, revealing more flesh within. The flesh gurgles and pushes through the incision, consuming the cutting implement. She abandons cutting operation.\n\n\n\u00ab10:20:\u00bb\n The drone views cows either fleeing from, or charging toward, an indiscernible point.\n\n\n\u00ab10:23:\u00bb\n \u03b7-3 heaves open frosted double doors into a massive chamber ~20 meters in height that slopes downward toward the center. A writhing light brown udder (hereafter \"\nUdder\n\") of indeterminable width fills the chamber, producing hundreds of large teats, which stretch and collapse. Sleeping persons, presumably employees, levitate mid-air and upside down in groups of three around smaller teats. Cream cheese flows in bulk from their craniums down into a giant subterranean tank below.\n\n\n\u00ab10:24:\u00bb\n \u03b7-2's drone captures footage of a cow falling from an upper walkway, yelping. A moment before striking the floor, the Udder trembles. The cow contacts the floor in slow-motion and dissolves into a translucent white liquid. This liquid flows toward the room's center.\n\n\n\u00ab10:25:\u00bb\n Additional cows follow until all 25 have fallen. Newly transmogrified fluids spray the team members.\n\n\n\u00ab10:27:\u00bb\n A pale, floating pink udder (\nSCP-3739-1-B\n) approaches the trio. \u03b7-1 recoils, clutching her temples \u2014 she receives a telepathic payload. \u03b7-1 asks, \"\nWhat do you want?\n\" The entity undulates as if laughing and approaches the team. \u03b7-3 fires on the entity. In due part to its apparent metaphysical nature, it does not take damage.\n\n\n\u00ab10:27:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 and \u03b7-3 share a nod. \u03b7-3 then stands at guard in front of her, and \u03b7-2 steps beside him. \u03b7-1 sets down her tool kit and unpacks it. She burns incense and reads an excerpt from her personal dream journal.\n\n\n\u00ab10:28:\u00bb\n The entity sports multiple arms that unfold from within each other and into view. It grows an attractive, plump face, spewing off-white fluids from its mouth. With a giggle and piercing shriek, it says, \"\nYour mother wants you to finish your milk\n.\"\n\n\n\u00ab10:29:\u00bb\n \u03b7-2 trains the drone on a fleshy off-color sack near the middle of the Udder's anterior face. \u03b7-3 levels his carbine, waiting to fire.\n\n\n\u00ab10:30:\u00bb\n \u03b7-2 says, \"\nI'm lactose intolerant\n,\" and curses the entity with reductionist profanities. The drone registers natural chemosignals\n.\nPheromones used to convey emotion and directions to those under its effect.\n emerging from the entity (hereafter \"\nMother\n\"). Fifteen smaller bovine entities with the appearance of animated cartoon characters (SCP-3739-1-C, hereafter \"\nChildren\n\") separate from the Udder. Ten Children bombard \u03b7-2 with runny cream cheese projectiles. Others siphon fluids directly from the Mother and chant: \"\nEat it! Eat it!\n\"\n\n\n\u03b7-2 refuses to comply.\n\n\n\u00ab10:31:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 strikes a match, burning her thumb tip. She thumbs her tactical sigil, and then downs the milk-honey. Her body goes limp. An astral body sprouts up from her physical body's chest and flips toward the Mother. She grabs at loose teats and pulls.\n\n\n\u00ab10:32:\u00bb\n \u03b7-2 is fully covered in cream cheese but refuses to consume it. The Children drag him toward the Udder, causing him to drop the remote control as he fights to be freed. They force a leaking teat into his mouth. He has no choice but to comply.\n\n\n\u00ab10:33:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 combats the Mother. Both scream, trading blows. \u03b7-3 walks to the Udder, aims, and fires at the exposed fleshy protrusion. He yells, \"\nYou're not real\n.\" The flesh goes erect and sprays raw milk at him. He consumes the milk at will, downing liters without apparent stress.\n\n\n\u00ab10:34:\u00bb\n \u03b7-1 spirals and pirouettes through the air, faster than the Mother. It squeezes green liquids at her. She grabs a teat and stretches it with ease. The Mother screams in shock, deflates, and then falls to the floor. A palpable wet smack echoes throughout the room. The entity finally becomes tangible, leaking the rest of its fluids.\n\n\n\u00ab10:35:\u00bb\n \u03b7-2 is no longer visible. The large Udder shakes and spills raw milk into the vast room. \u03b7-1's astral body reconnects with her physical body. She ditches the astral projection kit. \u03b7-1 and \u03b7-3 escape.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG | 10:35 PM]\n\n\n\n\nEXTRACTION:\n Post-log footage taken autonomously from \u03b7-2's drone records \u03b7-2 screaming in distress. This occurs for roughly 30 minutes as the warehouse fills with milk.\n\n\nNear the end of the footage, \u03b7-2 emerges naked, and a disembodied cattle branding prosthesis marks him on the upper thigh. He shudders, mooing. The prosthesis spots the drone, extends, and emits electricity from a cattle prod, frying it.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0CODENAME:\u00a0How\u00a0the\u00a0Udder\u00a0Half\u00a0Lives\u00a0\u25b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRAISA POST-INVESTIGATION NOTICE\n\n\nBetween \n12 October\n and \n19 October 2023\n, a wide-scale interrogation campaign across U.S. farmlands reveals that over 3,100 oneiric advertisements coerced dairy corporate executives, regional managers, and ranchers to sign away rights to their dreams.\n\n\nOn \n21 November 2023\n, several hundred livestock facilities experience bovine and human inflation. Like the entities seen in OPERATION: L.I., body fluids became replaced with a voluminous amount of non-anomalous milk product.

The REM sleep of thousands of citizens becomes irreversibly altered. Despite reintegration attempts made by Stratford Cattle Productions (via top-selling beef and yogurt products implanted with gustatory memetic agents), large numbers of civilians from these regions support CEO M.M.'s presidential campaign, with running mate VP Jackie the Clown Cow.\n\n\nOn \n9 February 2024\n, the CEO of \nMoosphere\n interrupts all of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Washington's major telecommunication broadcasts with a payload of cognitohazardous advertisements. \nMoosphere\n employs affected populations by force.
