SCP-2493-1 is to wear SCP-2493-2 whenever outside their designated containment chamber, and is to be restricted from attempting to leave their chamber until it is ensured SCP-2493-2 is correctly secured. SCP-2493-1 is to be provided with three meals each day, transmuted into antimatter by use of designated devices received from 2493\u2019. (See Addendum 3.)\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is to be psychologically evaluated twice weekly, and medication to be administered as required.\n\n\nA list of SCP-2493-1\u2019s requests for updated containment procedures is to be submitted to the Ethics Committee on a bi-weekly basis for review and approval or rejection. Proposals to rescind approved requests are to be submitted to the Ethics Committee; any other attempts by staff to impede approved requests will result in severe reprimands at the discretion of the Overseer Council. The full list of approved and rejected requests are outlined in Document 2493-1; \u201c\nApproved & rejected requests by SCP-2493-1 for updates to containment procedures.\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSpecial\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0(Revision\u00a01)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\u00a0These\u00a0procedures\u00a0are\u00a0no\u00a0longer\u00a0in\u00a0effect!\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is to wear SCP-2493-2 at all times. SCP-2493-1 is to be kept in its modified humanoid containment cell at Lunar Area-32. The cell is to be filled with pure helium gas at a pressure of approximately 20 kilopascals, and kept at a temperature of approximately 280 Kelvin. The interior of the room is to be kept above a minimum of 270 Kelvin, to ensure continued biological function of SCP-2493-1. The interior surface of SCP-2493-1's containment cell is to be padded with a three centimetre thick layer of soft rubber. No sharp corners or points are to be present within SCP-2493-1's cell; all such corners or points are to be removed or padded. In the event of SCP-2493-2 becoming punctured, it and SCP-2493-1 are to be immediately jettisoned from the facility. MTF Gamma-4 (\"Blondebeard's Crew\") is to be notified to adjust the trajectory of the anomaly as required, and to prevent it from entering the earth's atmosphere and causing a UK-Class Global Irradiation event.\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is to be supplied at least 2 kilograms of waste matter daily, to a maximum of 10 kilograms.\n\n\nOnce weekly, a signal requesting contact is to be sent through the extradimensional anomaly located on the rear of SCP-2493-2 by use of a 4\u00a0MHz radio wave. The entity is also to be under surveillance at all times, and any attempts to hinder communication with the entity\u2019s location of origin are to be reported to the site director immediately. (See Addendum 3.)\n\n\nA list of SCP-2493-1\u2019s requests for updated containment procedures is to be submitted to the Ethics Committee on a bi-weekly basis for review and approval or rejection. Proposals to rescind approved requests are to be submitted to the Ethics Committee; any other attempts by staff to impede approved requests will result in severe reprimands at the discretion of the Overseer Council. The full list of approved and rejected requests are outlined in Document 2493-1; \u201c\nApproved & rejected requests by SCP-2493-1 for updates to containment procedures.\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2493 is the collective designation for two components; SCP-2493-1 and SCP-2493-2.\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is a male humanoid entity approximately 1.7 meters in height, and weighing approximately 95 kilograms. SCP-2493-1 is composed entirely of antimatter, but physically appears to be an ordinary human. SCP-2493-1 responds to the name of Joe Smith, and claims to originate from an alternate dimension composed primarily of substances with similar atomic composition to his. Psychological evaluation of SCP-2493-1 has revealed that it suffers from nostophobia\n1\n \nand an obsession with completing their mission\n. (See Addendums)\n\n\nSCP-2493-2 is a suit composed entirely of a previously undiscovered and currently poorly-understood substance that SCP-2493-1 refers to as \u2018Buffer\u2019, superficially resembling an airtight type 1 hazmat suit. This substance is entirely non-baryonic in nature, uniformly reflects all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation resulting in a mirrored surface, and is also capable of preventing interaction between matter and antimatter. These properties prevent the contents of anything composed of this material from being examined by use of X-ray scanning, and severely impede physical examination. The material comprising SCP-2493-2 is flexible in a manner comparable to rubber, but has a texture consistent with polished metal. An impermeable barrier replaces the substance around SCP-2493-1\u2019s facial region, serving as a two-way visor. The interior of the suit is also capable of emitting light from an undetermined source, and will do so upon instruction by SCP-2493-1.\n\n\nOn the back of SCP-2493-2 is a multifunctional backpack that serves as an air recycler, \na method of exchanging resources obtained by SCP-2493-1 for canned provisions,\n2\n and an airtight input for canned provisions. SCP-2493-1 has never been observed to physically ingest these supplies; the entity states that this is attributable to nanites present within the interior of the suit, which constantly reassemble small sections of food within his mouth whenever available. \nIt is theorized that the device is connected to SCP-2493-1's reality of origin via a stable extradimensional anomaly in the device, as this is the only reasonable explanation of how the provided waste materials can be converted into edible substances composed of antimatter.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a01:\u00a0Information\u00a0Summary\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0summary.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of information regarding SCP-2493-1\u2019s origins, obtained during several interviews. \nIt should be noted that the only source of such information is the entity itself, and as such cannot be confirmed to be factual.\n (See Addendum 3.)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 originates from an alternate reality (Henceforth 2493\u2019) consisting entirely of antimatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society of 2493\u2019 has access to or has developed technology that is significantly more advanced than that of our own, with such technology requiring large quantities of electrical energy to operate, typically exceeding the range of petajoules on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology within 2493\u2019 \napproximately 200 years ago\n 173 years ago produced large quantities of waste materials as by-products of their operation. Such technology has since been adapted to recycle their waste materials. These produced waste materials were transported to a poorly-understood location of abnormal geometry, described as being physically located between two of the three axis present within normal three-dimensional space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter \nan undefined period of time\n 40 years the inhabitants of this space began transporting their own waste materials to 2493\u2019, with several described objects exhibiting anomalous phenomena sufficient to be classified as SCPs. This prompted the inhabitants of 2493\u2019 to develop devices capable of severely hindering the transit of such waste material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unidentified object, presumed to be of abnormal geometric origin, initiated an XK-Class Vacuum Decay within 2493\u2019. Technology developed specifically to counter such a scenario spontaneously activates, protecting a small portion of 2493\u2019 from the event; however, such technology is required to be powered continuously in order to sustain such protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous working-class citizens of 2493\u2019 have been deployed to alternate realities to obtain matter and transport it back, for the purpose of powering antimatter reactors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a02:\u00a0Recovery\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2493-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted shortly after the acquisition of the entity, before the antimatter nature of SCP-2493-1 had been confirmed.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What is the suit you are wearing made of?\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n There's no atoms.

The explosion makes a lot of energy, which can be turned into electricity. I need to get uhh\u2026 two\u2026 two? Yeah, two kilograms minimum of antimatter per day. I uh, think that\u2019s how much they said would keep everything powered at least. Or was it five?\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What are you referring to?\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n Mainly home electrics, water recycling, food production and vehicle electricity. There\u2019s some more important things too, so could you please let me get back to work?\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n If you are made of antimatter, aren\u2019t you aware of the ramifications that will occur if your suit is punctured?\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n I die and my employers lose a supply line, it was on the contract. It\u2019s an acceptable loss, considering they can just find another source.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n It would be safer to simply send you back. If you cooperate, we should be able to devise a method of sending you back.\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n You don\u2019t need to send me back, I\u2019m fine here. Just let me stay.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Why shouldn\u2019t we send you back?\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n It\u2019s safer here. From what I\u2019ve seen of here, we\u2019ve been ahead of you in regards to technology for ages, but you\u2019ve been able to handle waste much better than we did. We got lazy and sent it off to some vague location between dimensions for a couple of years, but as it turned out there were\u2026 things, living there, and seeing as we were fine with sending them our garbage, they seem to have decided to send their garbage to us as well. You know what sort of things that beings from between dimensions consider garbage?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Theoretical calculations of the interaction of 2kg masses of matter and antimatter as described by SCP-2493-1 would produce 360 petajoules of energy; in comparison, the Three Gorges Dam in China, the world\u2019s largest power station as of writing, produces 356 petajoules of energy per year. \nQuestioning SCP-2493-1 in regards to the technology necessitating electrical input at this magnitude on a daily basis is currently underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03:\u00a0Event\u00a0logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0logs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, contact with 2493\u2019 was successfully established by use of a 4\u00a0MHz radio wave transmitted through the extradimensional anomaly located on the rear of SCP-2493-2. The superiors of SCP-2493-1 apologized for the extended period of time taken for them to respond, and requested to speak to SCP-2493-1 personally. Several of SCP-2493-1\u2019s claims, as well as additional false claims, were requested for confirmation to ensure that cooperative disinformation could not be attempted; all claims made by SCP-2493-1 (detailed in Addendum 1) were clarified and confirmed as true, with all additional false claims being denied.
