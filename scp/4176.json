Foundation agents planted in Adna are to administer amnestics upon an SCP-4176 event.\n\n\nObjects found produced from SCP-4176 events are to be used as Foundation assets.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4176 is a yearly reoccurring phenomenon affecting the Adna Post Office in Adna, Washington, typically occurring within the last week of January.\n\n\nSCP-4176 events begin with the sudden launching of an unmarked, customized ICBM in the Pacific Ocean\n1\n. Upon launch, the missile will be directed towards the unincorporated territory of Adna, WA, and land in the field in front of the area's post office. No civilians have been harmed as a result of an SCP-4176 event.\n\n\nAll missiles involved in SCP-4176 events feature secured hatches, with the phrases \"taxes for (year) fiscal year\" and \"to: internal revenue(sic)\n2\n service, washington usa\" spray-painted across the surface. The contents within the hatch are typically objects possessing large monetary value such as precious jewels, paintings, and other similar items.\n\n\nBelow is a list of objects recovered from SCP-4176 events.\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2010\n\n\nObject Log:\n Deed to a downtown Manhattan private parking garage, 50\u00a0kg of 16th-century gold coins, 15 sable fur coats, 75% of a well-preserved mammoth carcass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2011\n\n\nObject Log:\n \n'The Scream'\n by Edward Munch (verified to not be a replica), five wrapped Publix submarine BLT sandwiches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2012\n\n\nObject Log:\n 75\u00a0kg of radiant-cut rubies, 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card, Fender 1968 Stratocaster autographed by Jimi Hendrix, five boxes of Gurkha Black Dragon Cigars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2013\n\n\nObject Log:\n \n\"Landscape with Cottages\"\n by Rembrandt van Rijn, 693 liters of \nY-909\n, three mint condition first edition copies of Magic: the Gathering card 'Black Lotus'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2014\n\n\nObject Log:\n A padded case containing twenty humanoid figurines accompanied by a certificate of authenticity signed by Dr. Wondertainment, 25% of a moderately preserved mammoth carcass, one framed image of a guinea pig chewing on a carrot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2015\n\n\nObject Log:\n A single capsule of \nSCP-500\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear:\n 2016\n\n\nObject Log:\n Golden Buddha statue, one wooden chalice, one portrait of John D.

The location of these launches is not consistent and has changed every SCP-4176 event.\n\n\n2\n.
