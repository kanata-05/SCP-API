Once SCP-3198 has confirmed its compliance, it should be contained for transport and moved to a secure site.\n\n\nCurrently, SCP-3198 is contained in its original discovery location which has been repurposed as Site-1394. Any instances seen outside of Site-1394 are to be contained, or, if containment fails, destroyed.\n\n\nSite-1394's windows have been boarded up under the guise of a lethal asbestos exposure.\n\n\nPersonnel entering Site-1394 must be wearing full tactical body armor. Weapons are not to be discharged at SCP-3198 unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\nResearch into a way to return SCP-3198 to a normal state is ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3198 is the collective designation for the Mobile Task Force formerly known as Lambda-9 (\"Big Fucking Guns\"). This task force was created specifically to contain Keter level objects that required high damage output ordinance in the event of a containment breach. Being one of the largest MTF teams, Lambda-9 is comprised of:\n\n\n\n\n100 foot soldiers armed with M4 assault rifles, M249 light machine guns, fragmentation grenades and 2 FGM-148 Javelin missile launchers\n\n\n20 OSHKOSH M-ATV scout vehicles fitted with M2 Browning heavy machine guns\n\n\n2 AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopters with 2 crew members in each\n\n\n30 combat trained support personnel\n\n\n4 M970 fuel trucks carrying Diesel\n\n\n2 OSHKOSH M978A4 Fuel Servicing Trucks carrying JP8 Jet fuel\n\n\n4 MK25 Standard cargo trucks carrying food, water and general supplies\n\n\n\n\nAll units (both human and vehicular) of SCP-3198 have been reduced dramatically to a ratio of approximately 1:64 of their original size with a similar reduction in mass. SCP-3198 seems to be aware of having been altered by an anomalous effect, but is not aware of specifically what effect has occurred. SCP-3198 is unable to correctly perceive its environment, believing materials, lifeforms and its current location to be anomalous in nature. SCP-3198 is also extremely hostile to almost all lifeforms.\n1\n SCP-3198 has begun to consume small invertebrates that inhabit the area surrounding its current location for sustenance despite Foundation attempts to provide SCP-3198 with a more viable food source (which have been met with extreme hostilities from SCP-3198).\n\n\nCommunication with SCP-3198 has so far not been possible. The voices of SCP-3198 members have become extremely high pitched, audible as \"squeaking\" with some words occasionally being discernible. SCP-3198 speech can only be understood by lowering the pitch and speed on recordings. It is also assumed that normal human voices cannot be understood by SCP-3198, describing them as a deep booming sound, both in person and via radio contact.\n2\n\n\nThe vehicles used by SCP-3198 function exactly like their normal sized counterparts, though they require significantly less fuel to run. Handheld weapons and weapons attached to both the scout vehicles and attack helicopters are considerably less powerful than their full sized counterparts, but are still capable of causing significant damage to structures and living targets.\n3\n\n\nSCP-3198 largely inhabits the west side of Site-1394's attic, having created a fortified base out of wood, cardboard and insulation. SCP-3198 is able to access the first floor of 1394 by using the sides of the attic's stairs as a ramp, which has allowed the scout vehicles to be driven to the first floor. SCP-3198 has created a small tactical wall using \nJenga\n blocks at the top of the stairs leading from the ground floor. This wall is usually guarded by one scout vehicle containing between three and four foot soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLambda-9 scout vehicle prior to Incident 682-I\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9 was last active during a containment breach of \nSCP-682\n (See Incident-682-I). This breach had occurred after an attempt to shrink 682 to a manageable size using \nSCP-1056\n (please see \nExperiment Log T-98816-OC108/682\n). En route to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-682 ambushed Lambda-9, expelling a wave of unknown energy.\n4\n Contact was lost; all units of MTF-Lambda-9 were presumed KIA.\n\n\nSCP-3198 was discovered 4 days later, 2 kilometers from the location of Incident 682-I\n5\n after agents responded to an incident at what is now Site-1394. The prior residents of 1394 had reported to a local pest exterminator of hearing \"buzzing\" and \"scratching\" coming from the attic, assuming the noise to be caused by wasps. When the exterminator investigated, they were attacked by SCP-3198. The exterminator sprayed pesticides over a small portion of SCP-3198's fortification before exiting the attic and contacting local authorities. The Foundation then took over control of the property to contain SCP-3198.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nAddendum 3198-1: Incidents\n\n\nIncident-682-I\n\n\nThe following is the transcript of radio contact between MTF-Lambda-9 and Task Force Control during Incident-682-I. Lambda-9's orders were to head to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and set up a Forward Operations Base from which units could be sent to re-contain SCP-682:\n\n\n\n\nFOU046:/001_SCP/Keter/Incident_Logs/682/Incident-682-I\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Task Force Control, we are about 5 kilometers out from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. ETA is 10 minutes. Over.\n\n\nTask Force Control:\n Copy that, Lambda-9. Be advised that 19-Overwatch has lost visual contact of the target. Target last seen heading west near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Over.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Copy that, Control. We are-\n\n\nA loud explosion is heard, shortly followed by gunfire and vocalisations from SCP-682.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Task Force Control, we have sight of the target! We have engaged. Our location is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 heading west. Switching comms to open channel. Over.\n\n\nTask Force Control:\n Copy, Lambda-9. Incapacitate target if possible; MTF and containment teams will be directed to your position. Over.\n\n\nTask Force Control directs all other MTF units and containment teams to Lambda-9's position. An unknown sound is heard over Lambda-9's radio, followed by a 7 second period of static. Lambda-9 begins communicating again; however, Task Force Control assumes this is random noise. The following speech from Lambda-9 is a transcription after analysis of the recording was conducted.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Task Force Control, 682 just did\u2026 something, some sort of energy wave was released. We've lost visual. We are, we, something's not right, control. Over.\n\n\nTask Force Control:\n Lambda-9, please report current status. Over.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Oh Christ, what is that sound? Command, are you reading this? Over.\n\n\nTask Force Control:\n Lambda-9, Lambda-9, do you copy? Requesting update on sitrep. Over.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Command?! What the fuck did 682 do to us?!\n\n\nTask Force Control:\n All units, Lambda-9 is Status Black; communications lost. Target last seen heading westbound from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. 19-Overwatch, please proceed to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. All remaining units, move to intercept target. Over.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-9:\n Captain! Radio's fucked! All I'm getting is fucking screaming, what the fuck ha-\n\n\nCommunication is cut off to Lambda-9 by Task Force Control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident-3198-A\n\n\nThe following is a log of Incident-3198-A. The log is a transcription of events captured by Site-1394 video feeds on 25/06/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Video footage is captured on Camera 4, which is situated on the west side of 1394's roof, just outside SCP-3198's location:\n6\n\n\n\n\nFOU182:/001_SCP/Euclid/Incient_Logs/3198/Incident-3198-A\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<10:14:25> Attack Helicopter 0582 is seen to depart Site-1394 through a hole in the roof.\n\n\n<10:14:31> 0582 proceeds to slowly turn 180 degrees before flying alongside the roof for approximately 40 centimetres.\n\n\n<10:15:15> 0582 proceeds back inside Site-1394.\n\n\n<10:25:38> 0582 departs Site-1394 again. A blackbird can be seen approximately 1.3 metres from 0582. The blackbird slowly approaches 0582.\n\n\n<10:25:51> 0582 turns to face the blackbird as it flies towards 0582. 0582 discharges its main gun at the blackbird, killing it.\n\n\n<10:26:23> 0582 hovers in places for 15 seconds before moving south of Site-1394.\n\n\n<10:26:59> A number of seagulls fly towards 0582 from the roof of Site-1394 and attack 0582 off camera. 0582 reappears on camera shortly before one of the seagulls destroys 0582's tail. 0582 then falls and hits the ground, resulting in its destruction.\n\n\n\n\nWhat remained of 0582 was recovered by Foundation personnel shortly after the incident.\n\n\nFoundation personnel outside of Site-1394 at the time were unaware of this incident. When questioned, they advised that the seagulls had been seen, and were presumed to be fighting over food; personnel were unable to perceive 0582 due to its size. 0582 was only noticed after it exploded upon impact with the ground.\n\n\nThe hole SCP-3198 breached containment through has since been sealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3198-2: Communication logs\n\n\nLog-3198-A\n\n\nThe following is a transcript from 20/06/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 where researchers attempted to re-establish communication with SCP-3198 after it was discovered. The communication problems between humans and SCP-3198 were unknown at this time. The following speech from SCP-3198 is a transcription after analysis of the recording was conducted:\n\n\n\n\nFOU182:/001_SCP/Euclid/Communication_Logs/3198/Log-3198-A\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n Control, this is MTF-Lambda-9, do you copy? Over.\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n (Audible sigh) Task Force Control, this is MTF-Lambda-9, does anyone copy? Over.\n\n\nResearcher Sanders:\n MTF-Lambda-9, this is Level 3 Researcher Sanders. Please relay your status immediately. Over.\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n Agh fuck! What the fuck?\n\n\nResearcher Sanders:\n Lambda-9, can you hear me? Over.\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n This is you giant fucks, isn't it? Paul! I've got the giants on the phone, think they're pissed about us trying to blow them up.\n\n\nResearcher Sanders:\n Lambda-9, if you can hear me, I need you to listen. The hostiles you are targeting are friendlies, repeat, hostiles are friendlies, do not attack. Over.\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n Hey giants, how about you go suck 682's dick and while you're at it, make it undo whatever the fuck it did to us?\n\n\nResearcher Sanders:\n Lambda-9, I believe there may be some communication issues with your radio. If you can hear me, plea-\n\n\nSCP-3198:\n Yeah, that's what I thought.\n\n\nComm link is assumed to have been cut off by SCP-3198.\n\n\nResearcher Sanders:\n Lambda-9, is anyone there? Over. Lambda-9?\n\n\nFollowing this the transmission is analysed. Researchers attempt to re-establish contact for the next few days to no avail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog-3198-B\n\n\nOn 28/06/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation communications analysts based at Site-1386 recorded a brief interchange between two instant message devices located at Site-1394. The devices were in use by SCP-3198. It was not known prior to this event that any members of MTF-Lambda-9 had been equipped with such devices when deployed during Incident-682-I.\n7\n The recording of this conversation is below:\n\n\n\n\nFOU182:/001_SCP/Euclid/Communication_Logs/3198/Log-3198-B\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, Tash is it working? It's Lydia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah but batteries nearly dead, better make it quick. How's the wall holding up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wall's fine, giant poked it's head round then ran off when we fired at it but..shit, I swear it had something that looked like a Foundation symbol on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat? Are you sure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot 100%, the guys didn't see it, they were too busy shooting at the damn thing and the symbol looked kinda fucked up like someone had just dragged bits of it to be out of place but I'm sure it looked like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it's this place. It's just messing with your head. I'd keep it to yourself, don't start a panic. Last thing we need is everyone thinking the giants work for the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get you but what if it isn't this place? What does that mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR: MESSAGE WAS NOT DELIVERED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER HAS DISCONNECTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to contact either recipient since have been unsuccessful.\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3198-3: Recovered media\n\n\nOn 30/06/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a scout vehicle was captured by Foundation personnel after the main weapon had been disabled. Inside the vehicle were four foot soldiers later identified as Private Lang, Private Pimm, Sergeant Emmerson and Corporal Betson. As Foundation personnel were lifting the vehicle to remove the occupants, all four jumped from the vehicle, resulting in their deaths.\n\n\nUpon later inspection of the bodies, a Mobile Task Force field document was found in Betson's clothing with a letter having been written on the back. Due to the size of the item, a microscope was required to view it. Below are transcriptions of both sides of the document:\n\n\n\n\nFOU182:/001_SCP/Euclid/Recovered_Media/3198/Document-3198-A\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy of Document-3198-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Field Document - Lambda-9\n\n\nClearance: Level 3\n\n\n\n\nThe following document is intended for the purposes of recording data that cannot be obtained through voice, video or photograph. All information recorded in this document must be done so with the express purpose of being returned to researchers.\n\n\n\n\nNAME:\n Natalie Emmerson\n\n\nRANK:\n Sergeant\n\n\nDATE:\n ?????\n\n\n\n\nWriting down all the information I can about where we are to try and figure out where \"here\" is.\n\n\nBreach was likely caused by either trying to terminate 682 with another SCP or experimental technology. 682 has likely gained the ability of that SCP/techology which seems to be the ability to send other lifeforms/objects to an alternate universe/dimension. The main question is, which SCP or what technology was used?\n\n\nCreatures:\n\n\nGiants - Humanoid in appearance, 1/2 a km maybe more in height, first giant we came across was able to spray some sort of toxin contaminating our food supplies (haven't seen this since, mechanical weapon or biological?), men near the trucks have suffered serious chemical burns. Sounds they make sound like a deep booming, almost like a constant sonic boom. Apparently not fans of our weapons.\n\n\nAirborne hostile \"Death Hawks\" - Possibly some sort of bird, attacked Chopper 0582 in a flock, only 0582 made visual contact so description is unclear.\n\n\nVarious insectoids - ranging from 1 meter to 3 meters in length, roughly the appearance of beetles, woodlice, ants. All hostile, but easy to deal with, have started consuming as food. Taste\ns like sh\n is not good but is edible.\n\n\nLocation:\n\n\nPossibly some sort of mountain or \nman\ngiant made structure. Materials seem to be a couple of variations of a wood like substance, one variation was found in a block form with some sort of inscription on it (can't tell what language it is, likely something to do with the giants), plant or possibly some sort of fiber lines the ground (useful for construction of the fort), higher up the structure seems to be some stone/brick.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nThe SCP used\n \nWe are located inside an alt\n \nI don't know where we\n \nWE ARE FUCKED\n\nIt doesn't matter where we are. It's not home. Why am I even still bothering to write this shit? So some scientist can jack off to it when they find our corpses? Fuck this.

We're gonna drive outta here when we're on guard duty at the wall and get as far as we can and hopefully find a way home. Since we can't take the chopper as the death hawks will tear us to shreds, not that any of us can fly one of those things anyway, driving and taking our chances with the giants is our only option.\n\n\nI just can't take this shit anymore. I have to hold back vomit every time I eat bug guts whilst I look at our food trucks. I can see tins of beans in one of the trucks. Fuck what I would give just to taste beans again. Sometimes I get to the point where I think \"Fuck it, I'd eat contaminated food over this shit\" but then I hear the screams of the guys that got that toxic shit into their systems. Fucking giant fucks.\n\n\nI had a dream last night that I was home. Well I mean it wasn't actually home, it looked more like Mexico or something but in my mind it was home. Nothing really happened in it, I was just having a drink with some friends and just relaxing and for the first time in so long I felt happy\u2026 then one of the giants decided to speak. A giant had apparently decided to try coming up to the wall again and making that god awful sound. In an instant I was back to my pit of anxiety and hatred for the damn things. I could not stop crying this morning.\n\n\nThere's rumours going round at the moment that someone saw a Foundation symbol on one of the giants. I think it's bullshit but people are starting to think about it too much. There's been talks of maybe surrendering to the giants or that maybe we're in a Foundation experiment. I don't care either way, I'm not waiting around here to find out.\n\n\nI know you feel the same way Shaun, I know you miss your Husband and I know you'd do anything to get back to him. I can't guarantee we'll get home, but it sure beats this shit.\n\n\nPlease don't let me down - Nat\n\n\nP.S. Maybe we need to get ourselves some bigger guns now, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Likely due to being attacked by local wildlife as well as its contact with the pest exterminator that discovered SCP-3198.\n\n\n2\n. Attempts to raise the pitch on recordings of human speech and play them back to SCP-3198 have so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\n3\n. Whilst no human deaths have occurred, 3 personnel have been attacked by SCP-3198 and received life-threatening injuries.\n\n\n4\n. Believed to be a manifestation of SCP-1056's anomalous effect; however, SCP-3198 shows no adverse effects associated with resizing via SCP-1056.\n\n\n5\n. It is not currently known how SCP-3198 ended up in this location.\n\n\n6\n. It is theorised 0582 was relaying information back to SCP-3198 about the surrounding area.\n\n\n7\n. Investigation into how this went unnoticed is ongoing.\n\n\n8\n.

Task Force Control: Copy that, Lambda-9. Be advised that 19-Overwatch has lost visual contact of the target. Target last seen heading west near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Over. MTF-Lambda-9: Copy that, Control. We are- A loud explosion is heard, shortly followed by gunfire and vocalisations from SCP-682. MTF-Lambda-9: Task Force Control, we have sight of the target! We have engaged. Our location is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 heading west. Switching comms to open channel. Over. Task Force Control: Copy, Lambda-9. Incapacitate target if possible; MTF and containment teams will be directed to your position. Over. Task Force Control directs all other MTF units and containment teams to Lambda-9's position. An unknown sound is heard over Lambda-9's radio, followed by a 7 second period of static. Lambda-9 begins communicating again; however, Task Force Control assumes this is random noise. The following speech from Lambda-9 is a transcription after analysis of the recording was conducted. MTF-Lambda-9: Task Force Control, 682 just did\u2026 something, some sort of energy wave was released. We've lost visual. We are, we, something's not right, control. Over. Task Force Control: Lambda-9, please report current status. Over. MTF-Lambda-9: Oh Christ, what is that sound? Command, are you reading this? Over. Task Force Control: Lambda-9, Lambda-9, do you copy? Requesting update on sitrep. Over. MTF-Lambda-9: Command?! What the fuck did 682 do to us?! Task Force Control: All units, Lambda-9 is Status Black; communications lost. Target last seen heading westbound from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. 19-Overwatch, please proceed to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. All remaining units, move to intercept target. Over. MTF-Lambda-9: Captain! Radio's fucked! All I'm getting is fucking screaming, what the fuck ha- Communication is cut off to Lambda-9 by Task Force Control.",

Researcher Sanders: MTF-Lambda-9, this is Level 3 Researcher Sanders. Please relay your status immediately. Over. SCP-3198: Agh fuck! What the fuck? Researcher Sanders: Lambda-9, can you hear me? Over. SCP-3198: This is you giant fucks, isn't it? Paul! I've got the giants on the phone, think they're pissed about us trying to blow them up. Researcher Sanders: Lambda-9, if you can hear me, I need you to listen. The hostiles you are targeting are friendlies, repeat, hostiles are friendlies, do not attack. Over. SCP-3198: Hey giants, how about you go suck 682's dick and while you're at it, make it undo whatever the fuck it did to us? Researcher Sanders: Lambda-9, I believe there may be some communication issues with your radio. If you can hear me, plea- SCP-3198: Yeah, that's what I thought. Comm link is assumed to have been cut off by SCP-3198. Researcher Sanders: Lambda-9, is anyone there? Over. Lambda-9? Following this the transmission is analysed. Researchers attempt to re-establish contact for the next few days to no avail.",
        "CONNECTED Hey, Tash is it working? It's Lydia. Yeah but batteries nearly dead, better make it quick. How's the wall holding up? The wall's fine, giant poked it's head round then ran off when we fired at it but..shit, I swear it had something that looked like a Foundation symbol on it. What? Are you sure? Not 100%, the guys didn't see it, they were too busy shooting at the damn thing and the symbol looked kinda fucked up like someone had just dragged bits of it to be out of place but I'm sure it looked like it. I think it's this place. It's just messing with your head. I'd keep it to yourself, don't start a panic. Last thing we need is everyone thinking the giants work for the Foundation. I get you but what if it isn't this place? What does that mean? ERROR: MESSAGE WAS NOT DELIVERED USER HAS DISCONNECTED",
        "Shaun, Get your stuff ready to leave and meet me at the trucks when it gets dark\u2026 well whenever light stops coming through the cracks. I can't tell you this out loud, will probably get shot for even thinking this but I'm abandoning the group with Pimm and Lang. We're gonna drive outta here when we're on guard duty at the wall and get as far as we can and hopefully find a way home. Since we can't take the chopper as the death hawks will tear us to shreds, not that any of us can fly one of those things anyway, driving and taking our chances with the giants is our only option. I just can't take this shit anymore. I have to hold back vomit every time I eat bug guts whilst I look at our food trucks. I can see tins of beans in one of the trucks. Fuck what I would give just to taste beans again. Sometimes I get to the point where I think \"Fuck it, I'd eat contaminated food over this shit\" but then I hear the screams of the guys that got that toxic shit into their systems. Fucking giant fucks. I had a dream last night that I was home. Well I mean it wasn't actually home, it looked more like Mexico or something but in my mind it was home. Nothing really happened in it, I was just having a drink with some friends and just relaxing and for the first time in so long I felt happy\u2026 then one of the giants decided to speak. A giant had apparently decided to try coming up to the wall again and making that god awful sound. In an instant I was back to my pit of anxiety and hatred for the damn things. I could not stop crying this morning. There's rumours going round at the moment that someone saw a Foundation symbol on one of the giants. I think it's bullshit but people are starting to think about it too much. There's been talks of maybe surrendering to the giants or that maybe we're in a Foundation experiment. I don't care either way, I'm not waiting around here to find out. I know you feel the same way Shaun, I know you miss your Husband and I know you'd do anything to get back to him. I can't guarantee we'll get home, but it sure beats this shit. Please don't let me down - Nat P.S. Maybe we need to get ourselves some bigger guns now, right?",
