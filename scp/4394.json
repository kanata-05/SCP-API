When cooled below its freezing point (1.19\u00a0\u00b0C), a quantity of liquid SCP-4394-A crystallizes into a proportionally sized, functional grand piano. For example, freezing a few drops of SCP-4394-A will result in a piano roughly 1\u00a0cm wide.\n\n\nWhen ingested, SCP-4394-A will pass through the digestive tract unchanged, but may cause mild nausea. However, SCP-4394-A possesses narcotic and mutagenic properties when injected intravenously.\n\n\nWhile under the influence of SCP-4394-A, subjects experience a noted increase in creativity and productivity, as well as a heightened sense of hearing. SCP-4394-A is moderately addictive; its effects increase in potency before plateauing and tapering off as the body develops tolerance.\n\n\nWhen administered intravenously, SCP-4394-A gradually converts the blood, lymph, and cochlear fluid into itself over a period of 6-8 weeks. The conversion process can be accelerated by continued injections. Following full conversion of fluids, SCP-4394-A subjects report auditory hallucinations of constant piano music and an indistinct male human voice; otherwise, SCP-4394-A functions indistinguishably from the original bodily fluids.\n\n\nSCP-4394 was discovered bound in the basement of one Mackenzie Lawrence (now SCP-4394-B) who had been extracting and injecting SCP-4394-A for an estimated seven months. Other objects found in the basement include:\n\n\n\n\nOriginal and unfinished sheet music composed by SCP-4394.\n\n\nPartial and whole instruments owned or used by SCP-4394 at various points in his life, including one grand piano whose lid had been carved with a depiction of SCP-4394's face.\n\n\nSeveral thousand photographs of SCP-4394, dating over a period of 19 years.\n\n\nThe body of SCP-4394's high school music teacher.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4394 and SCP-4394-B were subsequently contained and administered psychiatric treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4393\n | SCP-4394 | \nSCP-4395\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4394\n\" by Weryllium, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
