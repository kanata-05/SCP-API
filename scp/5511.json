All witnesses of the victims' deaths have been amnesticized, with the corpses being cremated to prevent investigation of the cause of death. Cover stories for their deaths have been disseminated. A \ndisinformation campaign\n, painting the projection to the moon as a \nmarketing stunt\n, is currently underway.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5511 is an event that took place over the night of 2020/02/12 in which a total of 84 civilians died by having their heads spontaneously explode with a force of around one milliton of TNT. This caused another 20 people to die from the force or resulting debris, with over 30 being left injured. During this time, a projection of red letters (SCP-5511-1) appeared on the surface of the moon, changing whenever a new victim appeared. No cause or pattern could be found in any of the victims that could lead to finding a possible perpetrator.\n\n\nBelow is a list of a few notable victims, with the resulting change in SCP-5511-1.
