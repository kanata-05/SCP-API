Personnel assigned to Sector-19 must not fit Profile Alpha-1168 \n(see \nAddendum 1\n)\n or Profile Beta-1168 \n(see \nAddendum 2\n)\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1168 is a copper sculpture identical to the work \nStatue of Theseus\n by Georgios Fytalis, with the following deviations:\n\n\n\n\nDating indicates it was created at least \u2588\u2588 years after the genuine sculpture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the sculpture's left hand are 30 silver coins dating from ca. 30, stamped with the 1977 design of Chuck-E-Cheese game tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInscribed on the outer side of Theseus' shield is the phrase \n\u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70 \u039a\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\n.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInscribed on the inner side of Theseus' shield is the phrase \nSIC DOMITO SAEVVM PROSTRAVIT CORPORE THESEVS\n from Catullus 64.\n2\n The inscription appears to have been engraved some time after acquisition; it is currently unknown how this engraving occurred.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1168 displays no anomalous properties while inactive. The object activates whenever 170 or more meters of yarn is placed into the sculpture's right hand. SCP-1168 closes its right hand around the yarn, the yarn is annihilated by anomalous means, and the object enters a \"pending\" state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1168 in an inactive state, prior to containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-1168 is in a \"pending\" state it will appear inactive until a human subject fitting Profile Alpha-1168 or Profile Beta-1168 enters SCP-1168's radius of effect.\n3\n\n\nWhen a human subject fitting Profile Alpha-1168 enters SCP-1168's area of effect, SCP-1168 will unclench its right hand and move its right arm to point its tertiary finger in the direction of subject for at least 5 seconds\n4\n, after which it will return to its \"pending\" state. Subject is subsequently designated SCP-1168-1.\n\n\nWhen a human subject fitting Profile Beta-1168 enters SCP-1168's area of effect, SCP-1168 will move its left arm to point two fingers in the direction of subject for at least 10 seconds\n5\n, after which it will return to its inactive state. Subject is subsequently designated SCP-1168-2.\n\n\nWhen SCP-1168-1 and SCP-1168-2 simultaneously exist, SCP-1168 will deactivate, and SCP-1168-1 will instantly materialize a wooden club and be encased in a 3m x 3m x 3m cube of ice. SCP-1168-2 will seek instances of SCP-1168-1\n6\n and initiate ritualized interactions \n(see \nAddendum 3\n)\n. After completion, SCP-1168-2 ceases designation.\n\n\nThe ice surrounding SCP-1168-1 is impervious to any interference and melts at a rate of 176mL per day. After SCP-1168-1 is free of the ice, subject ceases designation.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a0I1168-01:\u00a0Profile\u00a0Alpha-1168\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a0I1168-01:\u00a0Profile\u00a0Alpha-1168\n\n\n\n\nProfile Alpha-1168 subjects have public records of any of a list of sex crimes \n(see document Alpha-1168 for a list of currently known crimes which fulfill the criterion)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a0I1168-02:\u00a0Profile\u00a0Beta-1168\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0Document\u00a0I1168-02:\u00a0Profile\u00a0Beta-1168\n\n\n\n\nProfile Beta-1168 subjects are blond Caucasian men aged 15 to 18.
