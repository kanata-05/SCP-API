These cultures are to be stored under a covering of sterile mineral oil at 4-6\u00b0C in a secure cold room of Unit 21 of Site-76. Only personnel of clearance 3 or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-4061.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4061 is a gene sequence copied via CRISPR-Cas9\n1\n from SCP-4061-\u03b1 into bacteria modified from \nEscherichia coli\n K\u201312\n2\n. These cultures carry genes that express the same anomalous qualities as SCP-4061-\u03b1, expire if not kept cool after 6 hours, and are not transmissible outside of lab conditions.\n\n\nSCP-4061-\u03b1 is the remains of a 4-year-old male German Shepherd dog which had the ability to detect and interfere with the use of photographic devices active and directed at it. SCP-4061-\u03b1 expired from natural causes on 06/05/16. Its remains were incinerated on site.\n\n\nSCP-4061-\u03b1 attempted to move out of view of any photographic device. During all attempts to record SCP-4061-\u03b1, it emitted either electromagnetic radiation that destroyed unprotected electrical recording equipment or a hazardous effect manifesting as nearby objects non-coincidentally interfering with devices recording SCP-4061-\u03b1.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-4061 was discovered on 05/07/16. Further documentation on SCP-4061 can be found in the Stealth Technology Research Division's project codenamed \"Stray Mutt\".\n\n\nSCP-4061-\u03b1 was recovered on 12/15/2015 by Mobile Task Force Pi-1. Field agents were deployed after several perimeter security cameras at a public front of a Foundation site had simultaneously failed. Agents were able to determine that the cause of the security camera failure was SCP-4061-\u03b1 after a nearby small-town news team attempted to run a story related to an \"unphotographable dog\". A disinformation campaign and amnestics were used to enable the transfer of SCP-4061-\u03b1 into Foundation custody.\n\n\nStray Mutt - Stealth Technology Research Division\n\n\n\n\nInput\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\nReturn\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/03/16\n\n\n\n\nDue to the existence of another \nanimal\n (of the same subspecies and located at Wilson's Wildlife Solutions) with similar anomalous qualities, Dr. Baxter has recommended gene sequencing of SCP-4061-\u03b1.\n\n\nHe hypothesized that there may be a similar gene that both animals carry and express that is not found in others of the C. l. familiaris subspecies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/07/16\n\n\n\n\nFollowing SCP-4061-\u03b1's genomic testing, an atypical gene was isolated, and is hypothesized to be the cause of SCP-4061-\u03b1's anomalous effects.\n\n\nDr. Baxter has submitted a request for approval in attempting to edit SCP-4061 into bacteria via CRISPR-Cas9 to create an anti-recording salve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/04/2016\n\n\n\n\nO5-7 has expressed interest in two possible applications of Dr. Baxter's proposal. The first is to mask the movement of Foundation agents and their alternate identities from digital surveillance of rival global organizations. The second would be to reduce the cost and liability of obtaining or altering data from devices after administering amnestics to non-foundation personnel in the field.\n\n\nA determination as to the posthumous duration of SCP-4061-\u03b1's anomalous properties is needed before funding can be allocated to the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/11/2016\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4061 was successfully edited into \nEscherichia coli\n K\u201312 bacteria and stored at Site 76. SCP-4061 expires in 6 hours if not kept at 4-6\u00b0C in a controlled environment. SCP-4061's properties last in the bacteria for 4 hours after expiration.\n\n\nSCP-4061-\u03b1 was redesignated as such, and the gene was designated SCP-4061.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/18/2016 - Performed by Dr. Baxter\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-4061-containing bacteria were added to a probiotic ointment and applied to subject D-1777. D-1777 was then instructed to sit in a chair in a clean room as multiple cameras were activated in 15-minute intervals.\n\n\nResults:\n Each surveillance camera was destroyed by strong electromagnetic radiation until 7 hours had passed.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n The repeated strain on the bacteria to prevent recording shortens their lifespan.\n\nAll anomalous properties of SCP-4061-\u03b1 are found to be acquired by a subject when a salve containing SCP-4061 is applied topically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncident FSRX2 Report\n\n\n\n\nInput\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\nReturn\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/19/18\n\n\n\n\nA sample of SCP-4061-carrying cultures were logged as missing.
