Sub-Site 34 has been constructed at the location for the purpose of monitoring the anomaly.\n\n\nPrior to conversation attempts with SCP-1478, personnel are to be equipped with proper desert safety clothing as defined by SCP-1478 specimens. This typically involves wearing a wide-brim hat and a thin or no top. Additionally, personnel are to comply with SCP-1478's demands within reason before talking to them in order to ensure the objects' compliance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1478 is a group of fifty-four (54) saguaro cacti (\nCarnegiea gigantea\n) located in the Sonoran Desert. All specimens of SCP-1478 are visually indistinguishable from non-anomalous cacti of the same species. Objects exhibit full sentience and sapience and often vocalize without apparent means to do so. Groups of these cacti will often converse with each other about topics primarily focused on their immediate area or neighbors.\n\n\nIf allowed to converse with subjects outside of their species, SCP-1478 will consistently advise the subjects in desert or American southwestern topics, usually while presenting erroneous information. No instance of SCP-1478 has exhibited hostile behavior; however, the objects will often refuse to participate in conversation for a number of arbitrary reasons. Personnel are to comply to these demands if they are within reason in order to gain information from SCP-1478.\n\n\nWhen a person conversing with these objects fails to meet its requirements, that person will be transfigured into an instance of SCP-1478. This process has been reported to be painful, but instantaneous. Additionally, persons who have been transformed into an instance of SCP-1478 are able to perceive their prior places of occupation through unknown means. The significance and vector for this trait are currently unknown.\n\n\nInterview Log-1478-Tau:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1478-01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Jason Myers\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following log was taken during primary discovery of SCP-1478. Agents arriving from Site 23 were attired in the standard black suits.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nMyers:\n Hello.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1478-01:\n Hey! Say, ain't you hot in that suit? Yer likely to overheat if yer not careful.\n\n\n\n\nMyers:\n Please, don\u2019t worry about me. It\u2019s really not important, I\u2019ll be gone in a minute. Now, if you would, please tell me about this colony.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1478-01:\n Not important? Sir, I must protest. The desert is mighty dangerous. Y'all goin' to have to change before I start talkin'.\n\n\n\n\n[Futher attempts at questioning the subject at this point yield no results other than requests that Myers dress in a manner that would be appropriate for the environment. Agent Myers leaves the scene to a retrieve a hat from the nearest city. Myers returns wearing a fedora, and once again attempts to converse with SCP-1478-01.]\n\n\nSCP-1478-01:\n You pulling my leg? That ain't enough to shade ya! Yer gonna need something with a wide brim. And what'd I say about them suits? All y'all, git fitted proper.\n\n\nMyers:\n \n[sighs heavily]\n Please, just answer our questions. I don\u2019t think changing for a two minute long interview is really worth going all the way\u2014\n\n\nSCP-1478-01:\n Not worth it? Not worth it?! Boy, do you know what happens when folks don\u2019t bother preparin\u2019 themselves fer the desert?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n At the cessation of this interview, Agent Myers was transfigured into an instance of SCP-1478. All personnel from now on are to be dressed in appropriate clothing for the desert as determined by SCP-1478 while interviewing the objects.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-1478-Chi:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1478-16\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Alexander Fredricks\n\n\nForeword:\n For the purpose of this interview, Agent Fredricks has been adorned in a sombrero and a poncho.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nFredricks:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n Howdy, pardner.\n\n\nFredricks:\n Could you please tell me abo\u2014\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n Whoa there, slick. I can\u2019t understand you a spit with yer thick accent. Yer gonna hafter talk in a way I can hear ya.\n\n\nFredricks:\n Um\u2026 right. Well, perdner, I was wonderin\u2019 if, er, you could inform me aboot this here colony. I reckon.\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n Oh shucks, yer wantin\u2019 to know about us? Well, we\u2019re just some humble folks out here in th\u2019 Sonoran, makin\u2019 our livin\u2019, you know. Shoot, I never introduced myself, did I? Th\u2019 name\u2019s Braxton. Arnold Braxton.\n\n\nFredricks:\n Arnold Braxton? The ex\u2014I mean, uh, you the feller that disappeared from Reno ten years ago? \n[Fredricks attempts to spit on the ground.]\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n \u2018sho \u2018nuff. I used t\u2019 work fer dem casiners, but I ended up here one day and thought, \u201cAw heck, I don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 city slicker tellin\u2019 me what t\u2019 do! I got e\u2019erythin\u2019 I need right here.\u201d So I stayed. I keep one eye on them, though, just in case they try \u2018n\u2019 do somethin\u2019 funny.\n\n\nFredricks:\n How do you reckon that you managed to do that?\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n You got broken eyes \u2018r somethin\u2019? They\u2019re e\u2019erywhere! Y\u2019 can\u2019t take two steps without bumpin' into a goddamn slot machine.\n\n\nFredricks:\n And what are they up to?\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n Swindlin' people. Ol' Roberson finally got fired from there. Good riddance, he probably was dementia'd or somet'in' th' whole time he worked there. An' somethin' about a robbery.\n1\n\n\nFredricks:\n Shucks, thanks. I think that\u2019ll be it for now.\n\n\nSCP-1478-16:\n Y\u2019all take care now, y\u2019hear?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-1478-Psi:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1478-054\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Fredricks\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-1478-054 has been positively identified as possessing the mind of Agent Myers.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nFredricks:\n Hey Jason.\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n \n[sighs]\n Hey Alex.\n\n\nFredricks:\n How are you holding up?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n Terribly. All these stupid cacti keep speaking in awful fake accents and it\u2019s driving me up the wall. It\u2019s so obvious that none of them have ever actually grown up with these. If I had movable arms and a head, I would have torn out my eardrums by now.\n\n\nFredricks:\n That bad, huh?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n You don\u2019t even know. Hey\u2026 I know you\u2019re not here just to chat; that\u2019s not how we work. Let\u2019s just get to it, please.\n\n\nFredricks:\n Right. I\u2019m sorry, Jason. Now, have you noticed any changes since the transfiguration?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n Well, for starters, I feel mentally connected with all these other cacti. Like, I \nfeel\n their minds, and it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just feel it. I can tell who these people used to be but just aren't anymore. Well, except for one of them. That one, it doesn't seem like it used to be human, and I can hear a very, very loud voice coming from it. It just\u2026 wants us to be \nSouthern.\n I don't understand why, and it just\u2026 I don't get it.\n\n\nFredricks:\n I see. Where is this one located?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n About ten meters to your left. Don't get too close to it, I think that it's testy. It'd probably make you into a cactus, too.\n\n\nFredricks:\n I see. Anything else?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n I somehow know what\u2019s going on over at Site 23. I don\u2019t see it, I don\u2019t hear anything, I just kinda know. Like, some idiot broke the vending machine yesterday, right? The new Jackson kid. I know it\u2019s true.\n\n\nFredricks:\n Okay, got it. Final remarks?\n\n\nSCP-1478-54:\n This is probably a side effect of the connection thing, but I feel like the other cacti are, I don\u2019t know\u2026 infecting me? I feel like I\u2019m slowly becoming more and more like them. I said \u201cain\u2019t\u201d yesterday, Al. I never fucking say \u201cain\u2019t,\u201d it\u2019s the worst word in the history of language, but I fucking said \u201cain\u2019t\u201d and, well, look at it.
