SCP-4054 is to be stored on-site in a secure locker. Access is limited to Level-3 personnel and above.\n\n\nFoundation agents monitoring flea-markets, yard-sales, and property auctions for anomalous activity are to be briefed on the existence of SCP-4054. Any NES cartridges suspected of being copies of SCP-4054 are to be purchased for examination.\n\n\nA Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SAURON) is to monitor online gaming communities for discussions regarding the existence of SCP-4054. A joint operation involving MTF Mu-4 (\"Debuggers\") and MTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\") is to be conducted to investigate these discussions and determine whether the participants are aware of SCP-4054.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.2:\n Title screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll copies are to be recovered, and action is to be taken to discredit the existence of SCP-4054 as a hoax or urban legend. Any screen captures or videos of SCP-4054 are to be removed or otherwise replaced with doctored images to further perpetuate this narrative.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4054 is \nThe Seventh Door\n, an unlicensed platform adventure game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. The contents of each cartridge vastly exceeds the storage limitations of its ROM (read-only memory) chip. Extracting SCP-4054's PRG ROM produces a data-file too large to be contained on any currently available device.\n\n\nBecause of its limited publication (three hundred units), inability to be copied, limited replay-ability, and incomplete state, functional copies of \nThe Seventh Door\n are highly valued by vintage NES collectors. The game is also notable for its unique method of bypassing the North American version of the 10NES lock-out system.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.3:\n Level 5 (Catacombs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach cartridge includes two transistors that function as a voltage inverter. When activated, this component produces a negative-charged voltage spike that can temporarily disable early versions of the console's CIC,\n3\n bypassing the authentication lock and allowing unlicensed cartridges to run. Later iterations of the NES would add a series of 1k resistors along with diodes and grounds to prevent this technique from circumventing the lock-out unit.\n\n\nHowever, a defect in this voltage inverter's design causes irreparable damage to \nThe Seventh Door\n's SRAM\n4\n with each successive reset. This produces an increasing number of glitches which will inevitably render the cartridge non-functional.\n\n\nThe Seventh Door\n was shipped prior to completion. As a consequence, several core components of game-play differ from what is depicted in its instruction manual and box-art:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.4:\n Level 7 (Buried City). Note several sprites and tiles failing to load correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protagonist has no extra lives; upon dying, all progress is lost. The cartridge resets.\n\n\nAll power-ups described in the manual are absent save one (the \nHand of Glory\n,\n5\n which prevents monsters and platforms from moving for ten seconds).\n\n\nAll monsters are absent.\n\n\nFalling into a pit does not kill the protagonist. The protagonist will instead continue to fall off-screen as the game-over sound loops.\n\n\nMemory overflow errors periodically cause sprites to load incorrectly.\n\n\nThe prisoners use the protagonist's sprite rather than their own.\n\n\nAfter unlocking a door, prisoners provide no clue regarding the location of other keys (the text boxes are empty).\n\n\nThe protagonist dies at apparently random intervals (typically after a period of remaining still). This occurs regardless of whether or not the game is paused.\n\n\nTo date, researchers have uncovered several hundred levels beyond the seventh (described in the manual as the final level, and the location of the seventh key). These stages consist of vast networks of crypts, prisons, abandoned factories, and empty underground cities. The precise number of additional levels beyond the seventh has not yet been determined, but vastly exceeds the storage capacity of the cartridge's ROM chip.\n\n\nThe seventh level does not contain the seventh key.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4054.1:\n Video Stream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.5:\n Footage taken from user inky49's video stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, Charles Rogers (an amateur NES cartridge collector) posted a thread at \nwww.opening-the-seventh-door.int\n (a defunct online forum that was dedicated to \nThe Seventh Door\n) under the user-name 'inky49'. There, he suggested using an NES Game Genie\n6\n to directly set the value associated with the protagonist's number of keys to seven.\n\n\nSeveral days later, Mr. Rogers posted a link to an online video stream where he intended to attempt and beat \nThe Seventh Door\n using this exploit. Part way through his run, the video abruptly stopped. A follow-up investigation determined that Mr. Rogers had gone missing; authorities suspected foul-play after discovering several fingernails torn from Mr. Rogers' left hand inside his NES console.\n7\n\n\nTo date, SCP-4054 has been linked to 25 disappearances. It remains under investigation.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n2\n. The 10NES lock-out system was designed by Nintendo to prevent unlicensed cartridges from operating on their consoles.\n\n\n3\n. Checking Integrated Circuit.\n\n\n4\n. Static random-access memory.\n\n\n5\n. According to European folklore, a \nHand of Glory\n is the left hand of a man who has been hanged for murder. When used as a candle, those who perceive its light cannot approach its holder.\n\n\n6\n. Produced in 1990, the Game Genie is a 'game-enhancing' module that attaches between the NES cartridge and console. It permits direct modification of reference addresses in the ROM of the cartridge via strings of characters, or 'code'.\n\n\n7\n.
