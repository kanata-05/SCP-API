Instances of SCP-2753-B and SCP-2753-C are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2753 is a 3 dimensional ratio that can be used to describe the relationship between the sides of a block.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and material are assembled into a standard Jenga\n1\n tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will immediately collapse with it.\n\n\nSince 2009, the growing popularity and accuracy of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation within OBJ files\n2\n as a printable Jenga set has led to 21 structural collapses, 35 injuries, and 14 deaths.\n\n\nAddendum 2753.1:\n Incidents\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/2753/incidents/007.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 1988/07/07\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-2753-A\n\n\n\n\nThe collapse of a warehouse used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo\n3\n was linked to an instance of SCP-2753-A. 14 additional anomalous objects (including \nSCP-1433\n, an instance of \nSCP-1617\n, and \nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n) were also recovered amidst the wreckage.
