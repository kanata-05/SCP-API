These vessels have been further designated as follows:\n\n\nSCP-2220-1: \nEssex\n class aircraft carrier \nUSS Bon Homme Richard\n (CV-31);\n\nSCP-2220-2: \nBenham\n class destroyer \nUSS Stack\n (DD-406);\n\nSCP-2220-3: \nBenham\n class destroyer \nUSS Wilson\n (DD-408);\n\nSCP-2220-4: \nAtascosa\n class oiler \nUSS Atascosa\n (AO-66) (vessel forward of the smokestack is missing, edge of missing section\u2019s curvature consistent with SCP-2220-5 aperture radius)\n\n\nSCP-2220-1 through -4 were located intact but battle damaged amid the debris of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 (see Courier-Post extract, \u201cMystery sinkhole swallows local mall\u201d). Excess seawater was tested for anomalous effects and drained via pipeline to the Delaware River. All working machinery, weapons, aircraft, crew effects and remains were removed to Site-76 for further study. Class-A amnestics were administered to all first responding personnel, and a cover story involving a previously undiscovered aquifer collapsing was disseminated to local news organizations. Foundation recovery teams dispatched to the site found that in the case of each vessel, all personnel found aboard were deceased at their battle stations. Ongoing autopsies of the crew have determined that the cause of death in each case (aside from those found with obvious combat related injuries) was found to be an abrupt cessation of cardiac action potential resulting in sudden cardiac arrest. Autopsies on crew remains are scheduled to be completed on 10/15/2015. Operational orders found aboard SCP-2220-1 indicate that the vessels were involved in combat operations supporting the Operation Olympic landings on the southern tip of Kyushu, specifically Ariake Bay. The last entry in the captain\u2019s logbook (dated 11/4/1945) describes catastrophic losses being taken by Allied ground units attempting to secure the Ariake beachhead; \u201cspecial weapons\u201d delivered by SCP-2220-1\u2019s aircraft were authorized in an attempt to force a breakthrough.\n\n\nNineteen aerial bombs superficially resembling the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d nuclear device (designated SCP-2220-5 to-24) were located in SCP-2220-1\u2019s forward magazine. Inventory manifests indicate that SCP-2220-1 sailed from Pearl Harbor Naval Base on 10/25/1945 with twenty-five devices. These records further indicate that five had been used operationally on 11/4/1945 and one was undergoing emergency maintenance for what was noted as a \u201cdetonator mechanism issue\u201d (the latter device is presently unaccounted for and believed to be responsible for the manifestation incident). These devices were removed from SCP-2220-1 and are currently stored at Site 76, Secure Armaments Wing.\n\n\nTest detonation of SCP-2220-5 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588 resulted in the creation of a spherical Einstein-Rosen aperture 1\u00a0km in diameter centered on SCP-2220-5\u2019s location and resulting in the instantaneous disappearance of the entire target area within the sphere. No concussive force was observed during the detonation. The location of the missing terrain remains unknown. Test observations indicate that the aperture created is non-traversable and apparently functions as a \u201cone way trip\u201d to an unknown destination in spacetime. Further testing with two of the devices has been approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2219\n | SCP-2220 | \nSCP-2221\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2220\n\" by NotoriousMDG, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
