Radiocarbon dating has placed this object's origin at sometime earlier than 3000 BC, though testing has proven difficult due to the object's first anomalous property: excessive durability. SCP-4112 is capable of resisting all instruments shy of those with diamond tips, in all components. Separated components are attracted to each other, and will, with a speed of up to 10 kph, reconfigure themselves if dismantled, including fragments and pieces reattaching to each other, with no visible join or crease.\n\n\nSCP-4112's second and more dangerous property manifests when a user touches the object with intent to make a sound. Such movements include strumming, tapping, and more. If said user completes this while intending to produce an effect, whatever effect the operator has in mind will occur, regardless of impossibility, depending upon the complexity of the performance. Previous tests have manifested objects, removed objects from existence, changed the laws of reality, temporally transported the user, and more.\n\n\n\n\nWARNING:\n\n\nA DISTURBANCE IS OCCURRING CONCERNING:\n\n\nSCP-4112 IN SITE-120.\n\n\nPLEASE SEE LIVE VIDEO DICTATION FOR MORE INFORMATION.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0LIVE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0DICTATION\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0LIVE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0DICTATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel Identified:\n Researcher Gary Harding, Researcher Jesse Mantell, Mr. Alex Lifeson.\n\n\n<Auto Conflict Detection activated 06:32, \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/81.

Personnel RESEARCHER GARY HARDING and RESEARCHER JESSE MANTELL are restrained and gagged with cordage.\n\n\nMr. Alex Lifeson:\n \nAnd now that I have a captive audience, I\u2019d like to play you a little melody I\u2019ve been working on. I\u2019m no singer, but I\u2019ve also never played a lyre before either.

Item 4112 is not to be removed from the Administrator's\n \npossession at any time, at penalty of erasure from reality. Should the Administrator have any need to remove Item 4112 from his person, a\n \ncopy of the Administrator will be given the device and no one else.\n\n\nDestruction Protocols:\n N/A.\n\n\nAppearance:\n Item 4112 is an electric guitar, more specifically, a Gibson ES-335, white coloration. No physical alterations or modifications can be observed. Sourcing the model to a specific maker has proved fruitless (no identifying markings or model numbers are present on the object), and testing has proved difficult due to the objects anomalous properties.\n\n\nAnomalies:\n\n\n\n\nExcessive Durability:\n Item 4112 is capable of resisting all instruments shy of those with diamond tips, in all components. Separated components are attracted to each other, and will, with a speed of up to 5 miles an hour, reconfigure themselves if dismantled, including fragments and pieces reattaching to each other, with no visible join or crease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvides Artificial Ontokinesis:\n Item 4112's second and more dangerous property manifests when a user touches the object with intent to make a sound. Such movements include strumming, tapping, and more. If said user completes this while intending to produce an effect, whatever effect the operator has in mind will occur, regardless of impossibility, depending upon the complexity of the performance. Previous tests have manifested objects, removed objects from existence, changed the laws of reality, temporally transported the user, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Documents:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Research\u00a0Team\u00a09's\u00a0Notes.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Research\u00a0Team\u00a09's\u00a0Notes.\n\n\n\n\nVoice logs:\n Item 4112\n\n\nEntry \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\"Mantell's log. Please, do not distribute the following findings. We in Research Team 9 believe there is more to Item 4112 than meets the eye. Something, something just doesn't add up in the documentation for Item 4112. I've checked its history as far as my clearance would allow, it doesn't say how the object came into the possession of the Administrator. Not only that, he seems to suddenly lack skills and experience one would expect from someone in his position. Additionally, despite being the object most important to the Administrator, the item is not numerically first in the archives of the Federation. Further investigation is\u2026 pending.\"\n\n\nEntry \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\"Harding's log. I followed though with Researcher Mantell's request to do some snooping. Turns out, there's a containment vessel in our very own Zone-120 logged to contain the item, but it's unlisted in the safety document. That's the very same safety document very specifically stating it ought to be with the big man at all times. Very suspicious, I'll be conducting measurements inside the empty locker later this week.\n\n\nI don't like the sound of this. It's starting to look like shady business is going with that guy. And if he is involved in something like that, we could all be in danger. Harding out.\"\n\n\nEntry \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\"Harding's log. There's been a\u2026 an enormous uncatalogued reality event in the near vicinity of locker 6B within the past month. We have conclusive evidence enough to reckon that our current Administrator has\u2026 artificially inserted himself into his position through use of Item 4112. Our findings will be reported to the Council of Syrinx posthaste.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING:\n\n\nA DISTURBANCE IS OCCURRING CONCERNING:\n\n\nITEM 4112 IN ZONE-01.\n\n\nPLEASE SEE LIVE VIDEO DICTATION FOR MORE INFORMATION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0LIVE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0DICTATION\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0LIVE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0DICTATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel Identified:\n Administrator Lifeson, ACU-Alpha-1-A, B, C, and D, Researcher Gary Harding, Researcher Jesse Mantell.\n\n\nPersons Unidentified:\n 1: Male, European Descent.
