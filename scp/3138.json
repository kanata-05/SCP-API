Should it prove feasible, all non-canonical corpses are to be extracted, examined, and catalogued. Otherwise, affected works are to be kept on-site in a secure locker. Access is restricted to Level-4 personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3138 is a phenomenon involving the insertion of human corpses into a printed work of published fiction. The work must convey a narrative capable of recognizably describing the presence of a human corpse.\n\n\nInserted corpses will be depicted in a manner suited to the work; for example, a corpse inserted into a poem relying upon a particular rhyming scheme will be described via this rhyme scheme. Extraction of inserted corpses can be accomplished by destroying the work or editing it to remove the depiction of a corpse. Should this occur, all erased corpses will immediately emerge from the text in question. Notably, corpses that emerge during these events are non-anomalous, and show signs of decay reminiscent of extended submersion in an acidic environment.\n\n\nThe method by which SCP-3138 is accomplished has yet to be determined.\n\n\nAddendum 3138.1:\n Recovery Logs\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3138/recovery/102.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOVERY LOG\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY DATE:\n 16/03/1942\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n A 1921 paperback edition of \nGreat Expectations\n by Charles Dickens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGREAT EXPECTATIONS\n\n\n \n\u2018Bless your soul and body, no,\u2019 answered Wemmick,\n\n\nvery drily. \u2018But he is accused of it.
