Delta-7 has been instructed to patrol in a spiral pattern, moving outwards from a central pre-determined location, known as the Origin. This pattern is to be maintained until Delta-7 either encounters SCP-3700-1, or reaches the edge of the designated 800\u00a0km zone wherein they will return to the origin and begin the process again.\n\n\nInformation regarding SCP-3700's actual depth is to be retracted from all public texts and scientific publications. Should SCP-3700-1 be encountered, Delta-7 is to accompany the entity until it encounters SCP-3700-2, or it demanifests. SCP-3700-1 has been implanted with 32 large scale Donovan holoprojectors which give the entity the appearance of a pod of humpback whales.\n3\n Delta-7 is authorized to dissuade SCP-3700-1 from directly approaching any of the archipelagos, via force if necessary. Inquiry into Delta-7's presence is to be explained via maritime exercises between international peacekeeping forces. High ranking elements of the British Royal Navy have been informed of Delta-7's presence and purpose.\n\n\nShould SCP-3700-1 encounter SCP-3700-2 at any point, Delta-7 is authorized to engage Protocol \"Winter Maelstrom\".\n\n\nProtocol Winter Maelstrom\n\n\nUpon encountering SCP-3700-2 in the presence of SCP-3700-1, Delta-7 is to take the following actions.\n\n\n\n\nDestroyers are to deploy harpoon based anchors into SCP-3700-2's skin on its head, securing it in one location.\n\n\nDestroyers are to move in a circular pattern at a distance of 200\u00a0m, and engage the entity with both L-cannons, and standard armaments, with anchors at full taut to ensure the entity cannot orient properly in any one direction.\n\n\nCruisers are to draw SCP-3700-2's attention away from both destroyers and battleships, via use of Class 3\u00a0L-cannons and standard armaments. Cruisers should engage in a circular serpentine pattern at 300\u00a0m.\n\n\nBattleships are to employ Class 4\u00a0L-cannons in systematic continuous barrages, at 180 degrees on either side of the entity, 400\u00a0m away. Both vessels should coordinate as to launch each barrage at the same time as their counterparts.\n\n\nAll vessels shall follow this protocol until either entity subdues the other.\n\n\n\n\nAs conventional weaponry and L-cannons are only capable of doing limited damage to SCP-3700-2, Delta-7 should not engage it in the absence of the other entity. Should SCP-3700-1 prove unable to subdue SCP-3700-2, or should SCP-3700-1 encounter SCP-3700-2 before Delta-7 encounters the entity, protocol \"Tumult\" will be put in place.\n\n\nProtocol Tumult\n\n\nThe following procedures are to be enacted upon failure to properly contain SCP-3700-2.\n\n\n\n\nEvacuation of naval and civilian craft from the 800\u00a0km area of effect.\n\n\nRerouting of trade and ferry routes to the archipelagos for a period of no less than six months.\n\n\nContinuous aerial and naval reconnaissance of, and engagement with SCP-3700-2.\n\n\nIncreased monitoring of \nSCP-3456\n activity, due to SCP-3700-2's regurgitation of instances and a result of the changing, hazardous, weather patterns.\n\n\nContinued surveillance for the reappearance of SCP-3700-1.\n\n\nActivation of land based aquatic defenses.\n\n\n\n\nDue to SCP-3700-1's degrading physical condition, inquiries into the potential damage caused by allowing SCP-3700-2 to subdue SCP-3700-1 twice every 5 years is ongoing. Cooperative requests to local GOC forces are pending via review of GOC demands.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3700 is the designation for a circular area in the North Sea with a diameter of 800\u00a0km encompassing the archipelagos of Faroe, Orkney, and Shetland. SCP-3700 has an abnormal depth, with the sea floor located approximately 5\u00a0km below the ocean surface, compared to an average of 250-300\u00a0m for the rest of the North Sea. SCP-3700 is subject to a wide and varied array of anomalous occurrences\n4\n due to ritualistic interactions between two entities, which have been designated SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2. Active effects of SCP-3700 are wholly dependent on which entity successfully subdues the other during each ritual. All rituals, with the exception of two consistent dates, take place at random periods of time.\n5\n SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2 always interact on dates corresponding with the spring and fall equinox of the given year.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0information\u00a0on\u00a0SCP-3700-1\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0information\u00a0on\u00a0SCP-3700-1\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3700-1 is an arthropod\n6\n six km in length, green in pigmentation, with a mixture of blue, yellow, pink, and red markings etched along the top forming a facsimile of a woman's face. It possesses six prehensile limbs\n7\n attached to an elongated crescent shaped segment of its abdomen on the anterior end, with eight legs attached to a cylindrical segment stretching roughly four km in length. The entity possesses four compound eyes, orange in pigment, attached to stalks at the front of the crescent.\n8\n SCP-3700-1's carapace is heavily damaged, with large amounts of scarring, cracking, and small holes which expose softer tissues.\n\n\nOther than its size, the entity possesses several anomalous capabilities, a number of which are used to subdue SCP-3700-2. SCP-3700-1 is capable of using its club-like appendages in a similar manner to a Peacock Mantis Shrimp, where both the strike and the resulting cavitation bubbles produce a force in excess of several tonnes of dynamite.\n9\n Two of SCP-3700-1's eyes are capable of projecting concentrated blasts of gamma radiation. The entity is capable of dispelling/dispersing storms, and other aberrant weather phenomena, while simultaneously increasing rates of erosion on any land mass it comes within 100\u00a0m of. Despite its size, SCP-3700-1 is capable of reaching speeds in excess of 100\u00a0km/hr, and has demonstrated an ability to demanifest entirely if it is unable to locate SCP-3700-2 within a certain timeframe.\n10\n\n\nSCP-3700-1 is benign in nature, and displays rudimentary signs of sapience. When accompanied by Delta-7, it will either ignore the presence of Foundation vessels, or provide some primitive form of aid via propelling disabled craft away from peril. The entity travels the length of the 800\u00a0km area in which it manifests in a spiral pattern, moving out from a central location\n11\n towards the edges. Since its discovery, and the subsequent implementation of containment protocols, the entity has slowed considerably in its movements, suffered several notable decreases in mass\n12\n and has weakened considerably in its ability to subdue SCP-3700-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0information\u00a0on\u00a0SCP-3700-2\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0information\u00a0on\u00a0SCP-3700-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistic rendition of SCP-3700-2 as described by native inhabitants of the Island of Orkney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3700-2 is an anomalous member of the Actinopterygii\n13\n which closely resembles \nEurypharynx pelecanoides\n in appearance with the exception of 13 appendages encircling the middle section of its body. These appendages resemble the tentacles of an octopus, with accompanying suckers, and tuck into the entity's torso when not in use. The entity is currently 32\u00a0km in length,\n14\n with the majority of its length being composed of a whip-like tail ending in a sharpened point, with the widest point of the entity being approximately 1\u00a0km from top to bottom. Each tentacle is estimated to be approximately 60m in length, and its mouth is estimated to reach 3\u00a0km in depth when opened. SCP-3700-2 is black in pigmentation, and is bio-luminescent, with white, purple, and red luminescent lines forming the facsimile of a man's face on either side of its torso.\n\n\nSCP-3700-2 is capable of invoking rapid changes in meteorological conditions, specifically invoking storm conditions in excess of category 5 hurricanes. The entity is capable of bending its torso between the tail, in the semblance of a joint where there is visibly not one, and then spinning the lower portion of its body, while its head remains oriented in a single direction. This allows SCP-3700-2 to generate a whirlpool/maelstrom, drawing any vessels within 150\u00a0m towards it, at which point its tentacles will grip and rip said objects apart, regardless of composition. The entity is capable of releasing high energy soundwaves and streams of blue fire\n15\n from its esophagus, allowing it to quickly dispatch close range targets.\n\n\nSCP-3700-2 manifests at random locations along its counterpart's spiral path, with the exception of the aforementioned equinoxes where it appears at the Origin. SCP-3700-2 remains submerged unless it is engaged with another object/organism or SCP-3700-1, and will demanifest ~15 days after first appearing. The entity is openly hostile to any and all organisms that approach it;\n16\n however, SCP-3700-2 reverts to rote predatory behavior in all instances other than interactions with SCP-3700-1. The entity cannot be subdued via conventional weaponry, and only suffers moderate damage from anomalous weaponry, thus only SCP-3700-1 is capable of fully subduing it. Several of SCP-3700-2's more notable anomalous properties, including its ability to regurgitate \nSCP-3456\n instances, have emerged in the last decade, as its counterpart has grown weaker.\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractions between SCP-3700-1 and 2 consist of prolonged struggle, where each entity will attempt to temporarily kill or subdue the other. Interactions on equinox dates always occurs at the center of the 800\u00a0km zone. Interactions shortly following the given equinox dates are usually short, and can occur in random locations, with the victor of the previous interaction quickly dispatching the other entity. Historically, the previously subdued party has defeated its counterpart during the next equinox, prior to implementation of current protocols.\n18\n This resulted in two six month cycles where SCP-3700-1\n19\n would dominate one cycle, and SCP-3700-2\n20\n the other. Since implementation of current containment procedures, SCP-3700-1 has subdued SCP-3700-2 for 64 straight equinoxes with Foundation aid.\n\n\nSuccessful defeat of one entity by the other induces a number of different geological and meteorological changes within the 800\u00a0km zone. These are described below:\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-3700-1 subdues SCP-3700-2\n\n\n\nStorms, and harsh weather are immediately dispelled, despite meteorological conditions in areas outside of the 800\u00a0km zone.\n\n\nReproductive rates of local oceanic and island fauna increase by a factor of three, and crop yields double for the duration of the six month period. Careful culling of ocean fauna must be undertaken, due to unintended creation of dead-zones as a result of overpopulation of certain species of zooplankton.\n\n\nErosion rates of each archipelago's shores increase from standard rates by a factor of five.\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-3700-2 subdues SCP-3700-1\n\n\n\nMeteorological conditions become perilous. Continuous storms, ranging in strength from that of a category 1 to category 5 hurricane occur throughout the 800\u00a0km zone. Temperatures experience rapid fluctuations, ranging from well below 0\u00a0C, to well above 28\u00a0C as a result of the constantly changing storm fronts. Such conditions may cause damage or complete destruction of buildings, and loss of life, resulting in SCP-3456 appearances.\n\n\nTravel by sea is rendered difficult, if not impossible, by turbulent storm surges and waves. Supplies, food, and transport must be arranged by air, or aboard specialized storm-faring vessels.\n\n\nOcean food sources are driven from the area due to the extreme conditions, and livestock often expire from exposure or disease. Crop yields are greatly reduced due to high winds, over-saturated soil, and lack of sunlight.\n\n\nSCP-3700-2 does not demanifest. It will actively patrol the zone, and is known to approach the archipelagos explicitly to regurgitate SCP-3456, as well as prey upon any unsuspecting civilian vessels capable of traversing the harsh conditions it generates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical reports indicate that SCP-3700-1 has been regularly encountered by local fishermen since the 1500s; however, based on oral traditions, and known folklore of the area, it is likely that SCP-3700-1 was present during the construction of several nearby [DATA EXPUNGED] and that its counterpart was one of the many targets of such efforts. Reports of SCP-3700-2 are also consistent in local folklore; however, no recorded sightings of the entity were noted until the mid 20th century.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0I-3700-039\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0I-3700-039\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log I-3700-039:\n\nThe following incident log contains a composite video and audio recording transcript of the interaction between SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2 which occurred on March 20th, 2017. Descriptions and events were constructed using mounted CCTV cameras and audio communication logs between task force vessels. It should be noted that the nature of this incident is novel, and the given containment procedures and description have not been revised to reflect it due to a distinct lack of certainty regarding its consequences, and absence of historical precedence in regards to such an occurrence.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log I-3700-039\n\n\nForeword:\n Delta-7 arrived at the \"origin\" at approximately 00:00 hours on March 20th, and began preparations for Protocol \"Winter Maelstrom\". SCPS Mither and SCPS Teran were the retrofitted battleships present for the engagement, with the Mither serving as the flagship for the force. 2 of the destroyers suffered minor damage during the engagement, and the destroyer SCPS Stronsay Beast suffered heavy damage, including complete engine failure, and had to be towed from the area. Several vessels reported loss of personnel following the incident, with the majority of losses due to unusually turbulent seas, or SCP-3456 appearances. Communications throughout the engagement refer to SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2 as HOMER and ANGIE respectively.\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n[At 17:32:37 an area of water, 600\u00a0m from where Delta-7 was anchored, began emitting intense rays of light for approximately three minutes, before SCP-3700-1 appeared.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"This is the Mither to all vessels, HOMER has appeared, I repeat HOMER has appeared.\"\n\n\n[Delta-7 withdraws their anchors from the ocean floor, and begin steaming towards SCP-3700-1. The entity begins moving slowly, in a circular pattern, as Delta-7 gains on it. It catches sight of Delta-7 after approximately five minutes, and appears to acknowledge their presence by raising 2 of its claws into the air, and clicking them repeatedly while emitting a low rumbling noise from the appendages around its mouth.]\n\n\n[Delta-7 escorts SCP-3700-1 around the origin for approximately 30 minutes, in formation, without incident. At approximately 18:02:08, weather conditions begin changing. Large black wall clouds resembling those found in hurricanes form within several seconds, the wind visibly increases in speed and the waves become turbulent.]\n\n\n[SCP-3700-1 raises its claws, and moves them in a circular motion, creating a small hole in the clouds above it and Delta-7. SCP-3700-1 is noted to cease this activity after approximately 30 seconds, its antenna drooping, visibly taxed by the effort. The hole remains for the duration of the incident.]\n\n\n[600\u00a0m in front of Delta-7 and SCP-3700-1 the ocean begins to froth, and foam, before SCP-3700-2 emerges from beneath the surface, head pointed vertically upwards. It rises up until the tops of its tentacles are visible, and then stops. Its torso bends and the head becomes horizontally level. The entity's jaw opens, unhinged, revealing several rows of serrated teeth, before it emits a roar, followed by a stream of blue fire. SCP-3700-1 dives beneath the surface at this point.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"All vessels, ANGIE has been spotted. Engage 'Winter Maelstrom.'\"\n\n\n[Delta-7 Scatters outwards from where SCP-3700-1 submerged. All 13 destroyers reach their positions and fire their harpoons, which embed in the entity's head. SCP-3700-2 emits a second vocalization and becomes agitated, as its lower body begins to spin, generating the characteristic whirlpool at its base. Cruisers reach their positions and open fire with L-cannons and conventional weaponry, drawing SCP-3700-2's attention. Destroyers begin moving at top speed, drawing the harpoon lines taut and dragging the entity's head in a continuous 360 degree loop. Battleships reach their designated positions and charge their cannons.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Fire barrage on my mark. 3\u20262\u20261\u2026Fire!\"\n\n\n[The first broadside barrage from the battleships collides with SCP-3700-2, causing it to wail. SCP-3700-2 begins emitting grunting vocalizations, before regurgitating an SCP-3456 entity into the water below. The instance begins moving towards the line of destroyers in excess of 50\u00a0km/hr, despite a lack of aquatic anatomical features.]\n\n\nSCPS Selkie:\n \"CENTAUR in the water! Headed straight towards us!\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Selkie, switch targets to CENTAUR #1, engage with all weaponry.\"\n\n\n[The SCP-3456 instance closes the gap between it and the SCPS-Selkie before the vessel can retarget its weaponry.]\n\n\nSCPS Selkie:\n \"It's too close!\"\n\n\n[The Selkie is briefly lifted from the water by the instance, and it can be seen reaching towards crew members who are clinging to the railing and their weapon emplacements. SCP-3700-2 is briefly relieved by this action, allowing it to orient itself and release a stream of blue fire which impacts the SCPS-Stronsay Beast.]\n\n\n[An audible crack is heard, as the Selkie is released, and the SCP-3456 entity wails. SCP-3700-1 surfaces, and strikes the entity with its club like appendages once, twice, and three times, each resulting in loud cracks. The SCP-3456 instance is torn in half by the third strike, sending its human torso flying through the air, before landing just beyond the SCPS-Mither. The Selkie returns to full steam, drawing the line taut and pulling SCP-3700-2 out of its orientation. The Stronsay Beast has suffered moderate damage due to the fire, and is visibly smoking near its engine compartments.]\n\n\n[SCP-3700-1 is seen lifting several crew members, from the Selkie, who were displaced into the ocean, and places them safely aboard another destroyer as it passes. The entity curls its tail down below it, leaving only its crescent segment visible above the water and turns towards SCP-3700-2. SCP-3700-1 moves toward the edge of the whirlpool, two of its eyes beginning to emit luminescence. SCP-3700-2 is beginning to show signs of moderate damage due to the L-cannon barrages. Several SCP-3456 instances can be seen in the surrounding waters, and are being kept at bay by smaller support craft.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Brace for the killing blow!\"\n\n\n[SCP-3700-1 emits several concentrated blasts of gamma radiation, carving several large holes in SCP-3700-2. SCP-3700-2 wails, and begins flailing violently. Its motions manage to snap all of the destroyer's harpoon lines, and creates several large waves which push all present vessels backwards. The entity's barbed tail snakes from below SCP-3700-1 and impales it in its midsection and then lifts it clear of the water. SCP-3700-1 strikes at the tail with its club like appendages, attempting to free itself several times, before all movement stops. SCP-3700-2 flings the entity past Delta-7 where it plunges beneath the ocean surface and does not reemerge.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"HOMER is down, HOMER is down, all ships pull out and regroup for implementation of protocol Tumult.\"\n\n\n[All Delta-7 vessels turn and begin moving in the opposite direction of SCP-3700-2. The SCPS-Stronsay Beast has visibly slowed, sputtering smoke, before coming to a complete halt. SCP-3700-2 has begun expanding its whirlpool, and the sea has become extremely turbulent, as its flails have ceased. It emits a loud vocalization, and turns towards the fleeing vessels, before spotting the Stronsay Beast.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Stronsay Beast, get out of there now!\"\n\n\nSCPS Stronsay Beast:\n \"We can't move! Our engines are shot!\"\n\n\n[The Stronsay Beast is caught in the whirlpool, and drifts towards SCP-3700-2. A tentacle rises from beneath the surface, and wraps around the damaged vessel. SCP-3700-2 opens its mouth, preparing to consume the destroyer. SCP-3700-1 leaps from beneath the surface as SCP-3700-2's jaws begin to close, managing to strike and sever the tentacle gripping the Stronsay Beast, then weakly attempting to strike it, sending the damaged destroyer just beyond the whirlpools edge.]\n\n\n[SCP-3700-2 emits another vocalization, jaws clamping down on top of SCP-3700-1. Several bright flashes of light are visible, and SCP-3700-2 roars in pain, thrashing as its lower half stops spinning, and its tentacles come up from beneath the waves, and begin tearing SCP-3700-1's legs from its abdomen. SCP-3700-2 tentacles stop moving, and a rapid succession of muffled cracks can be heard. SCP-3700-2's lower jaw is severed, dropping SCP-3700-1 into the water. SCP-3700-2 begins flailing, its movements growing weaker before it releases one final stream of fire onto SCP-3700-1 in the water. Delta-7 stops steaming in the other direction, and patiently waits for signs of a victor; however, after 5 minutes neither entity is seen moving.]\n\n\n[Delta-7 makes its way back towards the site of the clash, where they found neither entity moving or alive. Both entities dissolved shortly after Delta-7 reached their position, a single round object was seen, by multiple crew members aboard the Stronsay Beast, sinking beneath the surface where SCP-3700-1 had been. At this time, it was noted that the wall clouds had dispersed into standard cumulonimbus clouds, although surface conditions remained turbulent.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"This is Delta-7 to Command.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n \"We read you Delta-7.\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"We have a bit of a situation.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Go ahead Delta-7.\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"SCP-3700-1 and 2 are both down.\"\n\n\n[10 seconds of radio silence.]\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Please repeat Delta-7.\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"SCP-3700-1 and 2 are both down.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Stand by.\"\n\n\n[Approximately three minutes of radio silence.]\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Are either entities' effects active Delta-7?\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Negative command.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Is there any trace of either entity?\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Also negative.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n [Anxiously] \"It appears the anomaly has been neutralized. Delta-7 is to return to base for debrief following any recovery efforts.\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n Understood command.\n\n\n[Approximately five minutes of radio silence occur as recovery efforts begin, and the Stronsay Beast is attached to tug boats.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Command, we're picking up unusual levels of gamma radiation, and a sonar contact at a depth of 3\u00a0km. Requesting permission to deploy submersibles for exploration purposes?\"\n\n\n[One minute of radio silence passes, wherein command is recorded to have deliberated a decision.]\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Request denied. Return to base for debriefing.\"\n\n\n[Delta-7 turns from the scene of the preceding battle, and begins steaming in the direction of its berth.]\n\n\n[During the next 5 minutes of recording, gamma radiation levels continued to increase. Ocean surface turbulence visibly worsen, and several smaller vessels are seen tossed by large waves. CCTV cameras on multiple vessels record the abrupt cessation of surface turbulence, and the appearance of four large, yellow orbs, 300\u00a0m from Delta-7's location, below the surface. The orbs linger for approximately 2 minutes, during which time significant seismic activity is reported within the area, before vanishing. Command notes the presence of the objects at this time, but does not inform Delta-7.]\n\n\n[Following the disappearance of these objects, Delta-7 detects a new sonar contact 5\u00a0km directly beneath the task force. Initial readings indicated some sort of metallic structure.]\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Command, we've lost the signal from the previous contact, and are no longer detecting gamma radiation. We're detecting a new contact, 5\u00a0km deep, large, and metallic.\"\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Stand by Delta-7.\"\n\n\n[Command discusses further action for approximately 3 minutes.]\n\n\nCommand:\n \"Delta-7, you are authorized to deploy \nsubmersibles\n for exploration purposes. Be advised, should SCP-3700-2 manifest, exploration teams are to be considered lost, and you are to return to base.\"\n\n\nSCPS Mither:\n \"Roger Command.\"\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Incident Log I-3700-039 Foreword: Delta-7 arrived at the \"origin\" at approximately 00:00 hours on March 20th, and began preparations for Protocol \"Winter Maelstrom\". SCPS Mither and SCPS Teran were the retrofitted battleships present for the engagement, with the Mither serving as the flagship for the force. 2 of the destroyers suffered minor damage during the engagement, and the destroyer SCPS Stronsay Beast suffered heavy damage, including complete engine failure, and had to be towed from the area. Several vessels reported loss of personnel following the incident, with the majority of losses due to unusually turbulent seas, or SCP-3456 appearances. Communications throughout the engagement refer to SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2 as HOMER and ANGIE respectively. Begin Log [At 17:32:37 an area of water, 600\u00a0m from where Delta-7 was anchored, began emitting intense rays of light for approximately three minutes, before SCP-3700-1 appeared.] SCPS Mither: \"This is the Mither to all vessels, HOMER has appeared, I repeat HOMER has appeared.\" [Delta-7 withdraws their anchors from the ocean floor, and begin steaming towards SCP-3700-1. The entity begins moving slowly, in a circular pattern, as Delta-7 gains on it. It catches sight of Delta-7 after approximately five minutes, and appears to acknowledge their presence by raising 2 of its claws into the air, and clicking them repeatedly while emitting a low rumbling noise from the appendages around its mouth.] [Delta-7 escorts SCP-3700-1 around the origin for approximately 30 minutes, in formation, without incident. At approximately 18:02:08, weather conditions begin changing. Large black wall clouds resembling those found in hurricanes form within several seconds, the wind visibly increases in speed and the waves become turbulent.] [SCP-3700-1 raises its claws, and moves them in a circular motion, creating a small hole in the clouds above it and Delta-7. SCP-3700-1 is noted to cease this activity after approximately 30 seconds, its antenna drooping, visibly taxed by the effort. The hole remains for the duration of the incident.] [600\u00a0m in front of Delta-7 and SCP-3700-1 the ocean begins to froth, and foam, before SCP-3700-2 emerges from beneath the surface, head pointed vertically upwards. It rises up until the tops of its tentacles are visible, and then stops. Its torso bends and the head becomes horizontally level. The entity's jaw opens, unhinged, revealing several rows of serrated teeth, before it emits a roar, followed by a stream of blue fire. SCP-3700-1 dives beneath the surface at this point.] SCPS Mither: \"All vessels, ANGIE has been spotted. Engage 'Winter Maelstrom.'\" [Delta-7 Scatters outwards from where SCP-3700-1 submerged. All 13 destroyers reach their positions and fire their harpoons, which embed in the entity's head. SCP-3700-2 emits a second vocalization and becomes agitated, as its lower body begins to spin, generating the characteristic whirlpool at its base. Cruisers reach their positions and open fire with L-cannons and conventional weaponry, drawing SCP-3700-2's attention. Destroyers begin moving at top speed, drawing the harpoon lines taut and dragging the entity's head in a continuous 360 degree loop. Battleships reach their designated positions and charge their cannons.] SCPS Mither: \"Fire barrage on my mark. 3\u20262\u20261\u2026Fire!\" [The first broadside barrage from the battleships collides with SCP-3700-2, causing it to wail. SCP-3700-2 begins emitting grunting vocalizations, before regurgitating an SCP-3456 entity into the water below. The instance begins moving towards the line of destroyers in excess of 50\u00a0km/hr, despite a lack of aquatic anatomical features.] SCPS Selkie: \"CENTAUR in the water! Headed straight towards us!\" SCPS Mither: \"Selkie, switch targets to CENTAUR #1, engage with all weaponry.\" [The SCP-3456 instance closes the gap between it and the SCPS-Selkie before the vessel can retarget its weaponry.] SCPS Selkie: \"It's too close!\" [The Selkie is briefly lifted from the water by the instance, and it can be seen reaching towards crew members who are clinging to the railing and their weapon emplacements. SCP-3700-2 is briefly relieved by this action, allowing it to orient itself and release a stream of blue fire which impacts the SCPS-Stronsay Beast.] [An audible crack is heard, as the Selkie is released, and the SCP-3456 entity wails. SCP-3700-1 surfaces, and strikes the entity with its club like appendages once, twice, and three times, each resulting in loud cracks. The SCP-3456 instance is torn in half by the third strike, sending its human torso flying through the air, before landing just beyond the SCPS-Mither. The Selkie returns to full steam, drawing the line taut and pulling SCP-3700-2 out of its orientation. The Stronsay Beast has suffered moderate damage due to the fire, and is visibly smoking near its engine compartments.] [SCP-3700-1 is seen lifting several crew members, from the Selkie, who were displaced into the ocean, and places them safely aboard another destroyer as it passes. The entity curls its tail down below it, leaving only its crescent segment visible above the water and turns towards SCP-3700-2. SCP-3700-1 moves toward the edge of the whirlpool, two of its eyes beginning to emit luminescence. SCP-3700-2 is beginning to show signs of moderate damage due to the L-cannon barrages. Several SCP-3456 instances can be seen in the surrounding waters, and are being kept at bay by smaller support craft.] SCPS Mither: \"Brace for the killing blow!\" [SCP-3700-1 emits several concentrated blasts of gamma radiation, carving several large holes in SCP-3700-2. SCP-3700-2 wails, and begins flailing violently. Its motions manage to snap all of the destroyer's harpoon lines, and creates several large waves which push all present vessels backwards. The entity's barbed tail snakes from below SCP-3700-1 and impales it in its midsection and then lifts it clear of the water. SCP-3700-1 strikes at the tail with its club like appendages, attempting to free itself several times, before all movement stops. SCP-3700-2 flings the entity past Delta-7 where it plunges beneath the ocean surface and does not reemerge.] SCPS Mither: \"HOMER is down, HOMER is down, all ships pull out and regroup for implementation of protocol Tumult.\" [All Delta-7 vessels turn and begin moving in the opposite direction of SCP-3700-2. The SCPS-Stronsay Beast has visibly slowed, sputtering smoke, before coming to a complete halt. SCP-3700-2 has begun expanding its whirlpool, and the sea has become extremely turbulent, as its flails have ceased. It emits a loud vocalization, and turns towards the fleeing vessels, before spotting the Stronsay Beast.] SCPS Mither: \"Stronsay Beast, get out of there now!\" SCPS Stronsay Beast: \"We can't move! Our engines are shot!\" [The Stronsay Beast is caught in the whirlpool, and drifts towards SCP-3700-2. A tentacle rises from beneath the surface, and wraps around the damaged vessel. SCP-3700-2 opens its mouth, preparing to consume the destroyer. SCP-3700-1 leaps from beneath the surface as SCP-3700-2's jaws begin to close, managing to strike and sever the tentacle gripping the Stronsay Beast, then weakly attempting to strike it, sending the damaged destroyer just beyond the whirlpools edge.] [SCP-3700-2 emits another vocalization, jaws clamping down on top of SCP-3700-1. Several bright flashes of light are visible, and SCP-3700-2 roars in pain, thrashing as its lower half stops spinning, and its tentacles come up from beneath the waves, and begin tearing SCP-3700-1's legs from its abdomen. SCP-3700-2 tentacles stop moving, and a rapid succession of muffled cracks can be heard. SCP-3700-2's lower jaw is severed, dropping SCP-3700-1 into the water. SCP-3700-2 begins flailing, its movements growing weaker before it releases one final stream of fire onto SCP-3700-1 in the water. Delta-7 stops steaming in the other direction, and patiently waits for signs of a victor; however, after 5 minutes neither entity is seen moving.] [Delta-7 makes its way back towards the site of the clash, where they found neither entity moving or alive. Both entities dissolved shortly after Delta-7 reached their position, a single round object was seen, by multiple crew members aboard the Stronsay Beast, sinking beneath the surface where SCP-3700-1 had been. At this time, it was noted that the wall clouds had dispersed into standard cumulonimbus clouds, although surface conditions remained turbulent.] SCPS Mither: \"This is Delta-7 to Command.\" Command: \"We read you Delta-7.\" SCPS Mither: \"We have a bit of a situation.\" Command: \"Go ahead Delta-7.\" SCPS Mither: \"SCP-3700-1 and 2 are both down.\" [10 seconds of radio silence.] Command: \"Please repeat Delta-7.\" SCPS Mither: \"SCP-3700-1 and 2 are both down.\" Command: \"Stand by.\" [Approximately three minutes of radio silence.] Command: \"Are either entities' effects active Delta-7?\" SCPS Mither: \"Negative command.\" Command: \"Is there any trace of either entity?\" SCPS Mither: \"Also negative.\" Command: [Anxiously] \"It appears the anomaly has been neutralized. Delta-7 is to return to base for debrief following any recovery efforts.\" SCPS Mither: Understood command. [Approximately five minutes of radio silence occur as recovery efforts begin, and the Stronsay Beast is attached to tug boats.] SCPS Mither: \"Command, we're picking up unusual levels of gamma radiation, and a sonar contact at a depth of 3\u00a0km. Requesting permission to deploy submersibles for exploration purposes?\" [One minute of radio silence passes, wherein command is recorded to have deliberated a decision.] Command: \"Request denied. Return to base for debriefing.\" [Delta-7 turns from the scene of the preceding battle, and begins steaming in the direction of its berth.] [During the next 5 minutes of recording, gamma radiation levels continued to increase. Ocean surface turbulence visibly worsen, and several smaller vessels are seen tossed by large waves. CCTV cameras on multiple vessels record the abrupt cessation of surface turbulence, and the appearance of four large, yellow orbs, 300\u00a0m from Delta-7's location, below the surface. The orbs linger for approximately 2 minutes, during which time significant seismic activity is reported within the area, before vanishing. Command notes the presence of the objects at this time, but does not inform Delta-7.] [Following the disappearance of these objects, Delta-7 detects a new sonar contact 5\u00a0km directly beneath the task force. Initial readings indicated some sort of metallic structure.] SCPS Mither: \"Command, we've lost the signal from the previous contact, and are no longer detecting gamma radiation. We're detecting a new contact, 5\u00a0km deep, large, and metallic.\" Command: \"Stand by Delta-7.\" [Command discusses further action for approximately 3 minutes.] Command: \"Delta-7, you are authorized to deploy submersibles for exploration purposes. Be advised, should SCP-3700-2 manifest, exploration teams are to be considered lost, and you are to return to base.\" SCPS Mither: \"Roger Command.\" End Log"

    "description": "SCP-3700 is the designation for a circular area in the North Sea with a diameter of 800\u00a0km encompassing the archipelagos of Faroe, Orkney, and Shetland. SCP-3700 has an abnormal depth, with the sea floor located approximately 5\u00a0km below the ocean surface, compared to an average of 250-300\u00a0m for the rest of the North Sea. SCP-3700 is subject to a wide and varied array of anomalous occurrences4 due to ritualistic interactions between two entities, which have been designated SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2. Active effects of SCP-3700 are wholly dependent on which entity successfully subdues the other during each ritual. All rituals, with the exception of two consistent dates, take place at random periods of time.5 SCP-3700-1 and SCP-3700-2 always interact on dates corresponding with the spring and fall equinox of the given year.",
