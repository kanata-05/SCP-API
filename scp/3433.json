Each painting is to be encased in a glass container, approximately 127\u00a0cm x 127\u00a0cm x 8\u00a0cm. Currently, all paintings are on sale on an online site owned by the SCP Foundation at www.scp\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com, and are being constantly purchased and sold in rotation every 3 hours between 20 designated employees through an AI system programmed to purchase and sell items. Constant monitoring of this AI system is required at all times.\n\n\nIf this AI system fails, the 20 designated employees will be immediately alerted, with at least 7 employees required to report in (this number may change as new paintings related to SCP-3433 are discovered) to www.scp\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com, manually purchasing and selling the paintings until the AI system is recovered. All designated employees involved in this manual labor will be excused from their current jobs until further notice.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3433 is a social phenomenon related to a series of paintings by Andy Warhol from 1968-1987, created in \"The Factory\"\n1\n at 33 Union Square West, Manhattan, New York. It is currently unknown how many works related to SCP-3433 exist at this time. Currently, 3 paintings related to SCP-3433 have been claimed to exist, each designated as SCP-3433-n, but only 2 of these 3 have been confirmed as artwork related to SCP-3433.\n\n\nThe artwork related to SCP-3433 was distributed across the United States of America through several members of the \"Warhol Superstars\"\n2\n, who were each reportedly gifted an artwork of SCP-3433 by Andy Warhol himself. Following this, the works of SCP-3433 were distributed to various customers and museums. At this time, only 1 of these \"Warhol Superstars\" has been identified and apprehended for further interrogation.\n\n\nEach artwork related to SCP-3433 allows the current owner (person or institution) of SCP-3433-n, now classified as SCP-3433-n-n, to experience an event or phenomenon within the next 24 hours that results in them receiving approximately 14-15 days of widespread media attention. During this time, all sources of media, including radio, television, internet, and paper, will turn their focus to the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n. Subjects labelled as SCP-3433-n-n are unaffected further by SCP-3433.\n\n\nFollowing the aforementioned 14-15 days, SCP-3433-n-n experiences a series of events that continue to occur as long as SCP-3433-n-n maintains ownership over SCP-3433-n.\n\n\n\n\n1.\n \n(1-2 days)\n SCP-3433-n-n experiences an increasing attachment to SCP-3433-n. This attachment will increase over time, with SCP-3433-n-n becoming visibly distressed if others take interest in SCP-3433-n. This distress has been seen to evolve into violent outbursts against those who attempt to purchase or remove SCP-3433-n.\n\n\n2.\n \n(3-5 days)\n All public records (written and visual) of SCP-3433-n-n are removed or destroyed in both physical and digital forms through unknown means. Private possessions containing SCP-3433-n-n's information appear unaffected.\n\n\n3.\n \n(6-10 days)\n The memories of those who are aware of SCP-3433-n-n's existence and the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n appear to be affected, being unable to recall the events or even basic information on SCP-3433-n-n (including name, age, gender, etc.).\n\n\n4.\n \n(10-20 days)\n All memories (involving SCP-3433-n-n) of those aware of SCP-3433-n-n's existence and the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n have all been either modified or erased. Even SCP-3433-n-n's closest relatives and significant other are unable to recognize SCP-3433-n-n. New memories of SCP-3433-n-n are unable to be created, but new records are able to be produced.\n3\n\n\n5:\n \n(20-25 days)\n The ability to notice or visualize SCP-3433-n-n becomes increasingly difficult for others, taking approximately 7-10 minutes for an individual to even acknowledge SCP-3433-n-n. SCP-3433-n-n has visible difficulty in physically interacting with its surroundings and other objects [Data indicates that SCP-3433-n-n in this state appears to exhibit traits classified as \"intangibility\"].\n\n\n6:\n \n(25+ days)\n [UNCONFIRMED] At this time, SCP-3433-n-n is unable to be located through any means.\n\n\n\n\nThese effects appear to be permanent, but these effects cease to affect SCP-3433-n-n any further when SCP-3433-n-n sells or gives SCP-3433-n to another owner. If SCP-3433-n-n is an institution (e.g. Museum), then all employees and personnel related to the institution, as well as the structure itself are affected by the effects of SCP-3433.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ACCESS:\u00a0SCP/3433/files-code-Warhol/1-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3433-1\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n \"The Star\"\n\n\nDiscovered:\n October 23, 1999\n\n\nLocation:\n Tallahassee, Florida\n\n\nIncident 1:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (SCP-3433-1a) was in possession of SCP-3433-1 [approx. 36 days] and has been apprehended for further questioning.

That is, the artist, if I am correct?\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n That's right.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Are you aware of the alleged effects that this painting has on its owners?\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n What?

That whole thing. After that issue with Valerie\n5\n around '68, he went on and on about it for awhile. Kept him up for ages. I don't remember much else, though. I left the \"Factory\" around '73, and Andy gave me \"The Shadow\" just around then. I'm pretty sure he gave \"Viva\" one too, not sure.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \"Viva?\" Who else has access to these paintings?\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n Well, as far as I can tell, a couple other of us got one. Candy had one after '72. The last time I talked to Ultra Violet, maybe around '79? I think she mentioned about a painting. Who knows? There could be more out there. Last time I saw Andy, he just kept going.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n [\nscribbling\n] \"Ultra Violet,\" was it?

We all get our fifteen minutes of fame. After that, we have to move on. You know, make room for everyone else. Andy wanted us to help it get started. I had my fifteen back around '74. God, I still remember those days\u2026 but in the end, I had to move on like the rest. Just like Andy wanted us to.

No, no, I understand the concept, but if you could just explain how the paintings work, I'm sure this can be much more convenient for the both of us.\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n Well, that's alright. I didn't expect you to understand. Andy understood this all better than any of us. The best way I can explain it, is that all of us have a reason to exist, and Andy gave us purpose. You get your fifteen minutes. Then you have to move on, one way or another. You can't hold onto that fame forever, no matter how precious it is to you. You have to let go, or the world moves on without you. It leaves you behind.\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2 falls silent\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n [\nsighs\n] The world forgets you.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What does that even \u2014 I'm sorry, I don't seem to understand what you mean. Perhaps you could explain to me just exactly how the paintings work?\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n [\nlaughs\n] Oh please, doctor. Don't try to understand Andy. I don't think any of us really did. Just find your fifteen minutes with the rest of us, and you'll come to accept it as we all have\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is there any way you could be any clearer?\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n How much clearer can I be, doctor? Our time is running short. I do hope you get your fifteen minutes soon enough doctor, but just remember\u2026 [\nlaughs\n] all you get is fifteen minutes.

I have colleagues who have stood beside my work for decades. I don't think I would be so easily forgotten.\n\n\nWarhol-Superstar-2:\n Do you think you're any more special than the rest of them?

To further protect the identities of these individuals, they will be addressed as \"Mr. Superstar\" or \"Ms. Superstar\" as requested. A similar procedure will be followed for further apprehended \"Warhol Superstars\".] <Begin Log> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So, Mr. Superstar. You're the original owner of SCP-3433-3? Warhol-Superstar-2: You mean \"The Shadow\"? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yes, that's right. Might I ask, when did SCP-3433-3 come into your possession exactly? Warhol-Superstar-2: Oh, I suppose Andy gave it to me uh\u2026 maybe 1972? '73? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Andy Warhol, is it? That is, the artist, if I am correct? Warhol-Superstar-2: That's right. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are you aware of the alleged effects that this painting has on its owners? Warhol-Superstar-2: What? You mean the fifteen minutes of fame? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I beg your pardon? Warhol-Superstar-2: You know, \"in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes\" 4 . That whole thing. After that issue with Valerie 5 around '68, he went on and on about it for awhile. Kept him up for ages. I don't remember much else, though. I left the \"Factory\" around '73, and Andy gave me \"The Shadow\" just around then. I'm pretty sure he gave \"Viva\" one too, not sure. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \"Viva?\" Who else has access to these paintings? Warhol-Superstar-2: Well, as far as I can tell, a couple other of us got one. Candy had one after '72. The last time I talked to Ultra Violet, maybe around '79? I think she mentioned about a painting. Who knows? There could be more out there. Last time I saw Andy, he just kept going. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: [ scribbling ] \"Ultra Violet,\" was it? I see\u2026 Would you mind explaining what you mean by, \"kept going?\" Warhol-Superstar-2: Well uh\u2026 he did it, didn't he, doctor? It worked. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I'm sorry? What exactly worked? Warhol-Superstar-2: Our fifteen minutes. We all get our fifteen minutes of fame. After that, we have to move on. You know, make room for everyone else. Andy wanted us to help it get started. I had my fifteen back around '74. God, I still remember those days\u2026 but in the end, I had to move on like the rest. Just like Andy wanted us to. [ laughs ] Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The fifteen minutes of fame? No, no, I understand the concept, but if you could just explain how the paintings work, I'm sure this can be much more convenient for the both of us. Warhol-Superstar-2: Well, that's alright. I didn't expect you to understand. Andy understood this all better than any of us. The best way I can explain it, is that all of us have a reason to exist, and Andy gave us purpose. You get your fifteen minutes. Then you have to move on, one way or another. You can't hold onto that fame forever, no matter how precious it is to you. You have to let go, or the world moves on without you. It leaves you behind. Warhol-Superstar-2 falls silent Warhol-Superstar-2: [ sighs ] The world forgets you. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What does that even \u2014 I'm sorry, I don't seem to understand what you mean. Perhaps you could explain to me just exactly how the paintings work? Warhol-Superstar-2: [ laughs ] Oh please, doctor. Don't try to understand Andy. I don't think any of us really did. Just find your fifteen minutes with the rest of us, and you'll come to accept it as we all have\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is there any way you could be any clearer? Warhol-Superstar-2: How much clearer can I be, doctor? Our time is running short. I do hope you get your fifteen minutes soon enough doctor, but just remember\u2026 [ laughs ] all you get is fifteen minutes. Don't hang on for too long, doctor. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And just what are you implying? Warhol-Superstar-2: Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I'd hate to forget you. I'd hate for everyone to forget such an interesting face. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I have a family who loves me. I have colleagues who have stood beside my work for decades. I don't think I would be so easily forgotten. Warhol-Superstar-2: Do you think you're any more special than the rest of them? Are you the only person to have a family? Are you the only person to have peers to work beside them? The all-so memorable Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 6 ? It's people like you that clings onto their fifteen minutes. And for good measure. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Alright, [ sighs ] thank you for your cooperation. This has been\u2026 enlightening, I suppose. This will be all for today. Interviewer rises to leave Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: One last thing. Andy Warhol might have called you a \"superstar\", but to me, you're nothing more than another face in the crowd. Warhol-Superstar-2: Of course I am, doctor. That's the point. <End Log>",
