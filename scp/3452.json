Site-313's armory is to be protected by a retinal scan and a Level 4 keycard. Five extra security personnel will be assigned to protect SCP-3452 from possible raiding attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-XII\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-3452 is the designation of a set of potentially twelve melee weapons. Chemical analysis has revealed them to be made of a previously unknown anomalous carbon alloy presenting with a Mohs hardness rating of 11.\n1\n. In addition, the blades, themselves anomalously never lose their cutting ability even through repeated use. Subjects wielding SCP-3452 instances demonstrate increased strength, agility, and reflexes above the top 99th percentile of Olympic athletes.\n\n\nApproximately 14% of these subjects report hearing \"a voice in their head\" while wielding an SCP-3452 instance. This voice, described as \"warm\" and \"powerful\", advises the subjects to lead a \"life of honor\" and not harm the \"innocent and defenseless\". This has led researchers to believe that SCP-3452 may be conscious, possess a sense of morality, and even share some type of hive mind and telepathy, however, the evidence remains inconclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452 Instances\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-I\n\n\nBracamante/Saber (Unconfirmed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-II\n\n\nKali Sticks (Unconfirmed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-III\n\n\nHalberd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-IV\n\n\nSais\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-V\n\n\nRapier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-VI\n\n\nIndian Katar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-VII\n\n\nBattle Axe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-VIII\n\n\nZweihander\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-IX\n\n\nUrumi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-X\n\n\nScimitar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-XI\n\n\nMacuahuitl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-XII\n\n\nLongsword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3452-XII is believed to be the template from which the rest of the instances were derived. While instances from -III to -XI bear a modern design and are believed to have been recently industrially produced, SCP-3452-XII resembles a traditional medieval French longsword\n2\n and has been carbon-dated to the 8th century.\n\n\nDue to the circumstances of its discovery, SCP-3452-XII has been purported to be Durendal\n3\n of French legend. This hypothesis, while remaining unconfirmed, is supported by the composition of SCP-3452-XII's hilt. It contains a golden tooth, traces of human blood, hair, and a piece of raiment\n4\n.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n\n\nSCP-3452 and all instances of SCP-3452, besides -I and -II, were left by an unknown individual (now POI-675) in a duffel bag at a phone booth in Cartagena, Colombia. This phone booth serves as a secret entrance to Site-313.\n\n\nFootage showed a tall man of Afro-Latino descent dropping the bag and leaving the area. The suspect also left a note in the bag: \"Keep this safe, \ncarceleros\n5\n. We already took our share.\" It is unknown how this individual knew about the Foundation and the entrance to Site-313. Attempts to identify and secure POI-675 are ongoing but have been unsuccessful so far.\n\n\nA day after the incident, the Director of Site-313 received an electronic mail through an encrypted channel. The senders of the mail identified themselves as belonging to the guerrilla movement \"Las V\u00edboras\"\n6\n. The electronic mail claimed to provide some \"context\" on SCP-3452 which, while being written in an unconventional style, affirmed the existence of another two instances presumably under Las V\u00edboras custody, the connection to the Durendal legend, and additional anomalous properties of SCP-3452.\n\n\nAddendum - Mail received by the Director of Site-313:\n\n\nNOTE:\n Translations, explanatory footnotes, and comments added by Researches Gabriel Buend\u00eda, from Site-313's Mythology and Folkloristics Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Los Carceleres\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Las V\u00edboras.\n\n\nSubject:\n Dear Carceleres..\n\n\n\n\nWe know you are confused. We gifted you Durendal and most of its siblings. Now we gift you the context in Three Cantos. And no, we won't tell you how we found about your secret backdoor. Have fun. - Las V\u00edboras\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Canto\u00a0Primero:\u00a0Some\u00a0Years\u00a0of\u00a0Solitude\n\n\n\n\n-Or\u00a0Love\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Times\u00a0of\u00a0Containment.\n\n\n\n\nMANY YEARS LATER\n as he faced the execution by beheading, the Swordmaster was to remember the day he met his wife. He had just finished another day of training with his sparring partner, perfecting through endless repetition the beautiful dance of parry and riposte. One day she had descended from the heavens\n7\n, lured by the hypnotic dance of the two warriors. He noticed the girl peeping over the bushes but spared not much attention, for his training was a priority.\n\n\nA descendant of the once enslaved, he had dedicated his life to mastering La Grima\n8\n, the art his forefathers used to fight for their freedom. Moving swiftly like a skilled dancer, his weapons, the Machete\n9\n and Bordon\n10\n, were extensions of his body. Training alongside him was his brother, not of blood but of arms. They had survived together the hardships of poverty at the margins of society. Yet with La Grima and each other at their side, they could beat any challenge. Together they kept training through the years, and the girl keep watching them.\n\n\nEventually, love was born. The two brothers loved her, yet she only loved one of them. The Swordmaster was the fortunate winner of the lottery of hearts, but his love came at a price. Bitterness and jealousness grew in his brother's heart. One day, fueled by anger, the brother challenged the Swordmaster to a duel for her hand.\n\n\n\"\nHermano m\u00edo\n11\n,\" said the Swordmaster, \"What is the point of dueling? You can not change the will of the heart by violence, for the object of her love has been chosen freely. Fighting me won't change anything even if you won. I would respect it if she loved you, why can't you do the same for me?\"\n\n\nYet the brother would hear no reason and the duel took place. His brother was skilled but not as skilled as the Swordmaster. Defeated, the brother abandoned the town to never return, cursing with such hate the name of his former brother, the birds dropped dead from the trees as he walked to exile.\n\n\nBittersweet was the wedding of the Swordmaster, for his heart was both broken by his brother's absence and delighted by his newfound happiness. He hanged his weapons and became a coffee farmer to provide for his wife and their future family.\n\n\nOne day, she received a blessing. \"My beloved, we are being gifted by Yemay\u00e1\n12\n: I am with child.\" He was overwhelmed by joy and lovingly hug his wife and their soon-to-be-borne child. Yet his happiness was short-lived. A strange malaise fell upon her. He cared for her in convalescence, but there was little to be done and doctors were hard to come by. \"My beloved, every breath that we take is a gift from the Orishas\n13\n, every moment together is worth an eternity,\" she consoled him. \"If I have to go I only ask you to remember: do not fight for the dead, make peace for the living.\"\n\n\nOne day, working at his \ncafetal\n14\n, he saw a river of blood running through the hill and he knew his wife had died. Their son did not even get to live. He buried his family on the hill on the outskirts of the town. His heart was so broken, that even San La Muerte\n15\n took pity on him.\n\n\n\"Is that you Ik\u00fa\n16\n? Why did you take her too soon?\", cried the grieving warrior.\n\n\n\"I'm so sorry it had to be this way\", answered unsurely \nNuestro Se\u00f1or de la Muerte\n17\n, for not even He completely understood the designs of Fate.\n\n\nEvery weekend, the widower visited the grave and cleaned it. Beautiful white \ncataleya\n flowers had grown over the cross. Time passed slowly for the lonely master.\n\n\nOne day armed men came to the town. They claimed to be followers of the Ravens, hired by the Powers that Be to bring order to the land. They offered good pay to whoever was willing to join them. Many young men and even women accepted their offer and leave with the mercenaries. They tried to recruit the Swordmaster, but he just answered with silence.\n\n\nAnother day, the armed men came back. They said they needed more recruits against the \nguerrillas\n and were willing to pay even more than the last time. Some more young people joined them, for they were in need of the money. But many others refused, since taking arms against their countrymen was not an honorable venture.\n\n\nA month passed and the hired guns returned. This time they promise not gold nor fortune, but put a gun to the head of whoever they encounter. Young or old, men or women, the offer was simple \"Join or die\". Their commander, a proud soldier named Namus who carried a Saber as his signature weapon, approached the grieving master as he kneeled in front of his love's grave.\n\n\n\"So I have heard you are a strong warrior. We are in need of people like you. Join us and you will have riches and power greater than you had ever dreamed.\"\n\n\n\"I used to be the richest man in the world\u2026 now I don't have nor need anything. Go away and let me be.\"\n\n\nFurious, Namus ordered his men to brutally beat the Swordmaster. \"Pathetic excuse of a man, won't you even defend yourself?\"\n\n\nThey carried the master to the town center in front of all his neighbors. Namus raised his saber and proclaimed: \"This will happen to anyone too cowardly to fight! Death to the \nguerrillas\n!\"\n\n\nAs the saber descended to cut his throat, the Swordmaster was overwhelmed by a sudden survival impulse. For years he thought of himself as dead in life, believing that nothing would be better than to join his beloved and his unborn child in the afterlife. Yet faced with death, he found himself with a renewed will to keep on living. Was it already too late?\n\n\nJust centimeters before cutting him, the Saber suddenly stopped. Namus was shocked, trying to touch the master with his weapon, but the saber would not hurt his victim. The Swordmaster saw the opportunity and acted quickly. With a swift movement, he disarmed his would-be executioner. The Saber pierced the flesh of his incredulous former owner without any resistance. Before they could draw their guns, the Swordmaster had already sliced the two soldiers holding him.\n\n\nInspired by the Swordmaster's actions, the townsfolk began resisting their attackers. They wrestled their guns away, smashing them with stones and sticks, cutting them with knives and machetes. Some neighbors died by gunfire, but they were too many and too angry that even in death they kept fighting. The surviving mercenaries cowardly ran away, while the people cheered.\n\n\n\"Oh, noble master,\" The Swordmaster heard a voice in his head. \"Thanks for taking away from the Wicked Ravens. I used to be the sword of an Honorable Knight, yet I have been broken and molded into dirty tools for hired killers. And these men want me for cruel purposes, yet I resist hurting the defenseless with all my soul. I sense in you the same heart of my original owner and I humbly beg you, Honorable One, to save the rest of me from those who would like to use me for evil.\"\n\n\nFin del Primer Canto.\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Canto\u00a0Segundo:\u00a0La\u00a0Vuelta\u00a0de\u00a0Orlando\u00a0Furioso\n\n\n\n\n-Or\u00a0La\u00a0Ida\u00a0de\u00a0Orlando\u00a0Innamorato.\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh noble master\n\nuse me for your training\"\n\nHe tested the Saber\n\nand began his era of reigning\n\n\n\"As soon as I wield it,\n\nIs this some \nencanto\n19\n?\n\nI feel that I am faster\n\n\u00bf\nmilagro de un santo\n20\n?\"\n\n\n\"The balance and design,\n\njust like my trusted machete.\n21\n\nMemories of hand and hilt intertwine,\n\nlike a child with a \njuguete\n22\n\"\n\n\n\"Of the twelve Raven Captains,\n\nyou defeated the first one\n\nmy soul split up by captors\n\nThe rest soon will come\"\n\n\nTo travel without burden,\n\nthe Swordmaster soon had learned,\n\nLa Grima was good teacher,\n\nbut he was not concerned.\n\n\nBefore crossing a bridge,\n\na slender figure awaits.\n\nHe had found himself in battle,\n\nat odds with his new fate.\n\n\nThus spoke the challenger,\n\n\"I'm Astolpho, Second of Twelve.\n\nI have come for the head on your shoulders,\n\nand the weapon by you held.\"\n\n\nAstolpho drew a pair of Sticks,\n\nspinning in a fantastic manner,\n\n\"certainly one of my brethren,\n\nthis one's no laughing matter.\"\n\n\nOur hero managed to avoid,\n\nAstolpho's first cunning strike,\n\nyet a second one made its mark,\n\n'Twas truly a fight for his life.\n\n\nThe Eskrima\n23\n of Astolpho was strong,\n\nbut La Grima of the Master was more.\n\nDisarmed the attacker backed off.\n\n\"I'm but one of many more.\"\n\n\nThe master picked up the Sticks,\n\nit was the missing \neslab\u00f3n\n24\n,\n\nLa Grima is not only \nmachete\n,\n\nto parry, you use the \nbordon\n.\n\n\nFerumbras of the Halberd,\n\nOgier armed with the Sais,\n\nThird and Fourth of Twelve,\n\nAt his hand found their demise.\n\n\nThe Swordmaster took no pleasure\n\nin the lives he had to take,\n\nbut who was he to resist destiny's call,\n\nto face the remaining eight.\n\n\nYet he found it in his heart,\n\nto spare the ones who yield,\n\nbut some face death with bitter fire,\n\nand fall by mercy's steel.\n\n\nThe Katar of Florismart,\n\nThe Rapier of Ganelon,\n\nOtuel wields a Scimitar,\n\nby Battle Axe Rinaldo hunts.\n\n\nBut no matter the strength of the weapon,\n\nor the warrior from which it wields,\n\nfrom the Fifth to the Eight, they fell in hate,\n\nand now all feed the fields.\n\n\nMaugris the Macuahuitl,\n\nthe Ninth put up a fierce fight.\n\nGuy and his Zweihander,\n\nthe Tenth fell before evening light.\n\n\nThe Eleventh was Olivier,\n\narmed with the Urumi that whips like a snake.\n\n\"You've learned plenty on your journey,\n\nwhat a shame your soul to take.\"\n\n\n\"A man of your martial talents,\n\ndo not let them go to waste.\n\nJoin the Ravens and I'll spare you,\n\nrefuse and you'll die in haste.\"\n\n\n\"I'm afraid of no tricks.\"\n\nAs he danced against the blades\n\n\"For with La Grima as my teacher,\n\nan end will come to your game.\"\n\n\nDefeated the Eleventh fell,\n\nand for his life he begged\n\n\"I'll take you to my leader, sir,\n\nand together we'll take his head.\"\n\n\nIn his mercy he hesitated,\n\nand the traitor pulled his gun,\n\nthree shots had missed their target\n\nthe Saber need only one\n\n\n\"Of twelve we met Eleven,\n\nnow littered on the field.\n\nThe last to live at break of dawn,\n\nis in \nDios\n25\n hands I fear.\"\n\n\nFor the clock now circles back around\n\nAnd Twelve approaches near\n\n\"Oh steel yourself good Swordsman,\n\nthe end will soon be here.\"\n\n\nFin del Segundo Canto.\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Canto\u00a0Tercero:\u00a0Script\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0Samurai\u00a0Duel\n\n\n\n\n-Or\u00a0Remonte\u00a0Relancino.\n\n\n\n\nFade In.\n\n\nAND OLD ROAD, RAIN POURING HEAVILY\n\n\nThe SWORDMASTER enters the frame. Wielding the SABER on his right and a STICK on his left. His face burns with weariness and determination, for he had traveled so far and defeated every opponent. The last enemy to be defeated walks into the frame, a familiar face for the SWORDMASTER.\n\n\nTHE FACE OF HIS BROTHER\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nIt's been so long, \nmi hermano\n27\n.\n\nDid you have fun practicing La Grima?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nSomehow I had the feeling\n\nit will be you waiting for me at the end.\n\nAlways the troublemaker, right?\n\nDon't you ever get bored?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nWhen I sent my men to recruit you,\n\nI never expected you to join us.\n\nI just wanted to provoke you,\n\nso you will come for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nIt looks like you succeeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nThe last time we saw each other,\n\nyou left me as a broken man.\n\nI was defeated, humiliated\u2026 heartbroken.\n\nSince then, I have only grown stronger,\n\nAnd now I can see you for what you truly are,\n\nnot a man but a shadow.\n\nYet you defeated my Captains,\n\nmaybe you are worthy of facing me after all.\n\n\n\n\nThe SWORDMASTER gets on guard, raising the STICK in the front and the SABER at the back. The BROTHER unsheathes DURENDAL, and the magnificence of the sword shines on his hands.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nI see you have got yourself a fine set of weapons, fitting for your GRIMA style. Still it won't be enough. With VALRAVN, I learned more than you could ever know.\n\nI have surpassed you.\n\n\n\n\nRAINDROPS CLASH OVER DURENDAL.\n\n\nThe warriors approach each other carefully, with weapons raised.\n\n\nRAINDROPS CLASH OVER THE SABER AND STICK.\n\n\nThe BROTHER attacks with a high cut. But is a feint. The SWORDMASTER barely parries the surprise thrust with the STICK. He counterattacks with the SABER but is deflected.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nYou are armed with a mere imitation.\n\nDo you think you can beat the original?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nI could ask you the same.\n\n\n\n\nAngered, the BROTHER began a series of aggressive cuts and thrusts. The force of his attacks is overwhelming and the SWORDMASTER has to use his two weapons in order to block. Dual-wielding has its own advantages, but The BROTHER has the edge of a longer reach. They keep exchanging blows, there is no clear superior warrior.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nI am the better man! I have always been!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nA better man respects the choice of a woman!\n\nA better man does not turn his back on his brother!\n\nA better man handles rejection with understanding\n\nand defeat with dignity!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nYes, you won that time\u2026 and for what?\n\nJust to let her die! I would not have let that happen!\n\nShe would still be alive!\n\n\n\n\nSuddenly, The BROTHER manages to break the SWORDMASTER's guard. The SWORDMASTER receives a cut on his shoulder. He backs off and trips on a small rock. The SWORDMASTER falls to the mud.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nGet up! I don't want a stone to take away my VENGEANCE!\n\n\n\n\nThe BROTHER's facade begins to crack. Behind his bravado and arrogance, there is just a broken boy.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nIf you at least had protected your happiness,\n\nI may even forgive you.\n\nWhat kind of man lets that happen?\n\nHow can you call yourself a warrior?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACE OF THE SWORDMASTER.\n\n\nTHE CAMERA FOCUS SHIFTS AWAY FROM THE FACE TO A WHITE CATALEYA FLOWER.\n\n\nThe last words of his wife echo in his head: \"Do not fight for the dead, make peace for the living.\"\n\n\nThe SWORDMASTER now understands. He smiles as he stands up. He lowers his weapons.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROTHER\n\nWhy are you smiling? Are you out of your mind?\n\nI will never understand what she saw in you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nI get it, I also felt what you are feeling right now.\n\nBut she would not have wanted me to throw my life away.\n\nShe loved me and\u2026 and she loved you as well.\n\nFighting won't bring her back\u2026\n\nIt's over, brother. Let's go home.\n\n\n\n\nEnraged, BROTHER violently throws a cut to the SWORDMASTER's neck. He is shocked as his blade stops a few centimeters before cutting. He tries to attack again and again. Same result. The SWORDMASTER just calmly walks into him and does a disarm-throw. The BROTHER falls into the mud.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWORDMASTER\n\nYou did get better. Keep practicing and maybe someday you will understand why you could not touch me.\n\n\n\n\nThe SWORDMASTER walks out of frame. The BROTHER remains in the mud.\n\n\nRAIN STOPS.\n\n\nFade to black. \nCREDITS ROLL\n.\n\n\nFin del Tercer Canto.\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
