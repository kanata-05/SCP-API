A 350m perimeter is to be established around SCP-2462 during its blooming period, with access denied to all unauthorized individuals, save for citizens of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who live, work, or regularly visit inside the perimeter.\n\n\nSCP-2462 is kept at Outpost 2462-0. Four mirrors are to be stationed around SCP-2462, and must be cleaned regularly to maintain reflectivity.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2462 is a genetically unremarkable specimen of \nRafflesia arnoldii\n located outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Indonesia. While blooming, SCP-2462 generates a variable number of illusory \nR. arnoldii\n instances, collectively designated SCP-2462-A, within 250 meters of itself.\n\n\nSCP-2462-A do not displace any matter or have mass of their own, yet are opaque to light and respond realistically to environmental stimuli and physical interaction. Computer analysis of photographed SCP-2462-A has confirmed that they are not hallucinations.\n\n\nThe number of SCP-2462-A is variable. In its natural environment, SCP-2462 would maintain an average of 30,000 SCP-2462-A\n1\n under normal circumstances. The following factors are known to affect SCP-2462-A production:\n\n\n\n\nProximity of other \nR. arnoldii\n:\n Each living specimen within line of sight of SCP-2462 results in a ~60% reduction in SCP-2462-A's numbers.\n\n\nMalnourishment:\n SCP-2462-A production increases by 20-50% in periods where SCP-2462 is malnourished.\n\n\nLight:\n When illumination of SCP-2462 drops below levels typical of nighttime in its natural environment, SCP-2462-A will triple in number, receding when illumination is restored.\n\n\nDamage:\n When SCP-2462 is damaged, SCP-2462-A will cover almost every surface within 250 meters of it. SCP-2462-A will recede only when the damage to SCP-2462 is healed.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the difficulty of locating and transporting \nR. arnoldii\n instances\n2\n, containment by the presentation of other \nR. arnoldii\n instances is impracticable.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-2462 was identified in 2008, after photographs of SCP-2462-A were published on the official \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 tourism website. Interviews with citizens of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 indicate that SCP-2462 has been exhibiting anomalous properties since the previous year, with SCP-2462-A affecting two neighborhoods on the town's outskirts. Turning SCP-2462-A into a tourist attraction had only been considered in the months preceding SCP-2462's 2008 bloom.\n\n\nAddendum:\n At the recommendation of Dr. Breitkopf, SCP-2462 was surrounded by four mirrors, producing an effectively unlimited number of reflections, during a blooming period. SCP-2462-A was not generated. SCP-2462 was downgraded to Safe, and containment procedures were adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Roughly one per 6.5m\n2\n over its whole active radius.\n\n\n2\n. \nR. arnoldii\n exists as a parasite on the roots of the \nTetrastigma\n genus, and has not been successfully cultivated in captivity. It is not visible to the naked eye outside of its brief annual blooming period. Moreover, \nR. arnoldii\n is critically endangered due to deforestation \u2014 SCP-2462 is the only known member of its species within a 36km radius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2461\n | SCP-2462 | \nSCP-2463\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2462\n\" by Communism will win, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
