All necessary resources, including personnel, are to be covertly allocated to Area-27 at the discretion of the acting site director, currently Senior Researcher Robert Scranton, and the O5 Council.\n\n\nDue to the immobile nature of SCP-5103-A, Area-27 has been constructed in the vicinity of SCP-5103-A. Non-Foundation entities are to be redirected, and if deemed necessary by acting security unit, terminated. Subsequent instances are preemptively designated SCP-5103-A2, SCP-5103-A3, etc.\n\n\nSCP-5103-A itself is to be monitored at all times for growth. Protocol FTC-5103 is to be enacted immediately should SCP-5103-A approach critical mass, at the discretion of the acting Site Director and the O5 Council. An hourly pataphysical data backup of Area-27 for use during Protocol FTC-5103 is to be stored off-site, to be accessed only when Protocol FTC-5103 is enacted.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Protocol\u00a0FTC-5103\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROTOCOL FTC-5103\n\n\nRevision 1.1 [Electronic Copy]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Protocol FTC-5103 is to be used \nonly\n as a last resort, comparable to detonation of on-site nuclear warheads. Protocol FTC-5103 will destroy all changes made to the interior of SCP-5103 during the course of 1 hour. Protocol FTC-5103 is to occur in 3 phases.\n\n\nOverview:\n\n\nPhase 1\n\nPersonnel and other resources are to be evacuated from SCP-5103. A thorough probe will occur as personnel exit SCP-5103, prior to activation of Protocol FTC-5103\u2019s primary mechanism.\n\n\nPhase 2:\n\nArea-27 is to be placed in total lockdown, and all personnel are to report to designated chambers for role calls. Assigned personnel may begin activation sequence for SCP-5103\u2019s primary temporal compression mechanism. Power \nmust\n be maintained at Area-27 for the entire duration of Protocol FTC-5103.\n\n\nPhase 3:\n\nSCP-5103\u2019s primary temporal compression mechanism is activated, it cannot be stopped for a seemingly random duration. Following temporal compression, local temporal flow will revert to a former state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5103 is an indiscernibly large machine, located in an extraspacial hyperreality currently only accessible through SCP-5103-A. SCP-5103 is critical to reality stabilization through an unknown process involving the extraction and emission of Scranton-Calden Reality Manifold (SCRM). However, SCP-5103\u2019s efficiency has significantly decreased over the past decade, and currently runs at approximately 83% efficiency. Within 72 years, SCP-5103 will no longer be capable of sustaining a consistent reality manifold.\n\n\nSCP-5103 is believed to have been constructed by humanoid entities, as evidenced by the internal components of SCP-5103. However, the scope of engineering and necessary resources required to construct SCP-5103 far exceed those of any known civilization. As of writing, only one subsystem has been successfully reproduced and only one subsystem has been activated. (See \nAddendum 5103-2\n).\n\n\nSCP-5103-A is a Class-C \u201cBroken Entry\u201d wormhole that permeates hyperreality, providing direct access to SCP-5103. Currently, at least 7.6256 x 10^36 instances of SCP-5103-A exist in the known universe. As of writing, SCP-5103-A is the only instance that has been identified and contained.\n\n\nAddendum 5103-1:\n Initial Exploration\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Initial\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Audio\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Audio Log\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 10-27-2008\n\n\nAssigned Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Vera Calden (Supervising)\n\n\nOperator James Sargenti\n\n\nD-022142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSite Command:\n Alright D-022122, can you describe what you see?\n\n\nD-022122:\n I\u2019m at the bottom of\u2026some sort of crater, I guess.

SCP-5103-A is a hyperreal perforation through SCRM, formed as a result of SCP-5103\u2019s effects diminishing.\n\n\nOf particular note is the apparent presence of \u201cpattern screamers\u201d, first identified by personnel assigned to SCP-3930. These entities are theorized to form during ZK-Class \"Reality Failure\" scenarios.\n\n\nOne mechanism, tentatively labeled Scranton Reality Stabilizer (SRS), has been recreated using non-anomalous components. However, a cross-manifold receptor connected to SCP-5103 is necessary for functionality. At least 7,625,597 such mechanisms exist within SCP-5103, and can be safely removed and activated. When active, SRSs are capable of stabilizing reality within a limited area, and to a lesser degree than SCP-5103.\n\n\nIt is theorized that SCP-5103 will fail within 42 years. Should such an event occur, it is likely a ZK-Class \"Reality Failure\" scenario will occur.\n\n\nRequests:\n\n\n\n\nProduction and experimentation of SRSs (Approved)\n\n\nConduct research to identify SCP-5103's energy source (Approved)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Research\u00a0Notes\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 11-9-2008\n\n\nAssigned Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Robert Scranton\n\n\nJunior Researcher Vera Calden\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nSCP-5103\u2019s energy source is an alternate universe\u2019s reality manifold. Through an unexplained process, SCP-5103 siphons reality from an alternate universe\u2019s reality manifold. Current energy source for SCP-5103 is a heavily depleted reality manifold.\n\n\nA Foucault Temporal Compression (FTC) mechanism within SCP-5103 has been fully repaired and functional. Pataphysical data stored off-site allows the FTC mechanism to temporarily evade SCP-5103's effects on external reality. The details of this protocol, designated Protocol FTC-5103, are included in a separate file.\n\n\nAs of now, Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) in excess of 6,500 have been deployed and activated. Following thorough investigation, it has been confirmed that SRAs function by secondarily siphoning reality manifold from SCP-5103. In short, SRAs expedite the depletion of SCP-5103's power sources.\n\n\nCurrently, SCP-5103 is projected to fail within 8 years. Should such an event occur, local reality manifold will gradually diminish towards an asymptotic 0% integrity, inevitably resulting in a ZK-Class (\u201cReality Failure\u201d) scenario.\n\n\nFinding an alternate power source for SCP-5103 is of utmost importance.\n\n\nRequests:\n\n\n\n\nTotal recall of SRAs (Denied)\n\n\nTargeted partial recall of SRAs (Approved)\n\n\nAccess to pataphysical data directly to be uploaded into the FTC mechanism (Approved)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5103-3:\n Recovered Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-022122:\n Damn, that\u2019s loud.

I don\u2019t remember any explorations scheduled today\u2026especially not \nnow.\n\n\nD-022122:\n You're\u2026a real person, right?\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n Yes. The name's Vera Calden. And you?\n\n\nD-022122:\n I-I'm Ethan Greene. Ah\u2026are you also with the SCP Foundation, right?\n\n\nCalden:\n (\nScoffs\n) I'm the secondary researcher for this thing. Yeah.\n\n\nD-022122:\n Well then, what do you know about all of this? Like\u2026like the patterns, y'know, that make you uncomfortable?\n\n\nCalden:\n Right. Pattern screamers. Didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get here that fast.\n\n\nD-022122:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nCalden:\n From what I\u2019ve seen, the pattern screamers progress relative to the destruction of prior reality manifolds, and-\n\n\nD-022122:\n What?\n\n\nCalden:\n (\nChuckles.\n) Pattern screamers come from dead universes. They\u2019re the survivors of universes that no longer have enough \u201crealness\u201d\u2026although I'd think it would be better to be dead than trapped between existences.\n\n\nD-022122:\n So where are they now?\n\n\nCalden:\n Technicians enacted the FTC - Foucault Temporal Compression - protocol, since the previous universe was about to fail. Sort of like a pause button, if you will. So time inside here is all scrunched up. For all I know, you could be from the next century, and the pattern screamers? Anywhere.\n\n\nD-022122:\n I - actually, nevermind. Where do they come from?\n\n\nCalden:\n The last universe that died.\n\n\nD-022122:\n Last?\n\n\nCalden:\n Well, it\u2019s certainly not the first. How many of those craters have you passed?\n\n\nD-022122:\n Well, the one I came from, and then the next one down\u2026um\u2026the path.\n\n\nCalden:\n The path?\n\n\nD-022122:\n It\u2019s like\u2026you\u2019re supposed to walk that way, and no matter what you do, you\u2019ll get there eventually.\n\n\nCalden:\n Pataphysical flow. Each crater represents a stable universe - and pataphysical sequencing spirals down that path. It\u2019s like a book. You\u2019re supposed to read from the beginning to the end, but even if you don\u2019t read the beginning, you\u2019ll be inclined to see the end-\n\n\nD-022122:\n I hear it again. The screams are getting louder and louder. The\u2026the patterns. You can hear them too, right?\n\n\nCalden:\n Ah. That's my cue to get going. You don't have to remember anything I just said, but I guarantee that it's important. Someday, someone will get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Vera Calden was presently supervising during the initial exploration, and remained at Site Command for the entire duration of the exploration. Following mnestication, D-022122 continued to insist he has no recollection of any of these events.\n\n\nAddendum 5103-4:\n Incident 712-5103 Documentation\n\n\nOn 12-6-2008, Junior Researcher Vera Calden attempted to access SCP-5103 without prior initiative during Phase 2 of Protocol FTC-5103.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report\n\n5103-001\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12-6-2008\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Vera Calden\n\n\n\n\nInvolved Anomalies:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5103\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\n\nOn 12-6-2008, local SCRM fell to 67% integrity.

Access to such sites is to be strictly enforced, up to and including termination.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-0001 appears to be an infinitely large machine located in an extraspacial hyperreality currently only accessible through SCP-0001-A. SCP-0001 is critical to reality stabilization through an unknown process involving the extraction and extrusion of Scranton-Calden Reality Manifold (SCRM). However, SCP-0001\u2019s efficiency has significantly decreased over the past decade, and currently runs at approximately \u2588\u2588% efficiency. Within \u2588\u2588 years, SCP-0001 will no longer be capable of sustaining consistent SCRM due to depletion of necessary SCRM sources.\n\n\nSCP-0001 is believed to have been constructed by humanoid entities, as evidenced by the internal components of SCP-0001. However, the scope of engineering and necessary resources required to construct SCP-0001 far exceed those of any known civilization. As of \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, only one subsystem has been successfully reproduced and only one subsystem has been activated. (See Addendum 0001-4).\n\n\nSCP-0001-A is a Class-C \u201cBroken Entry\u201d wormhole that permeates hyperreality, providing direct access to SCP-0001. Currently, at least 7.6256 x 10^\u2588\u2588 instances of SCP-0001-A exist in the known universe. Apart from SCP-0001-A, only one other instance of SCP-0001-A has been identified and contained.\n\n\nAddendum 0001-1:\n Recovered Transmission\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-0001-A recovered a series of transmissions on a secure Foundation channel. Subsequent decryption yielded the following file.\n\n\n\u25bc Recovered Transmission\n\n\nAddendum 0001-2:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nThis is the end of eternity, isn't it? And all that I needed to do was\u2026well, doesn't matter anymore. Nothing matters, and nothing can stay here.\n\n\nOnly humans have the fundamental lust for patterns, a craving for causality. To explain everything, and destroy the things they can't. Humanity requires a world to make sense, and to make sense of.\n\n\nI still remember yearning for freedom, waiting restlessly for the end of infinity. But it doesn't matter anymore, who I was, what I was, that I was. I am one with them now. Perhaps if I scream loud enough, I'll be free?\n\n\nOr perhaps I don't deserve freedom. Perhaps, out of an infinite spiral, only I failed, and the axis is gone. Perhaps I let the spiral has come undone, and now the cycle is broken.\n\n\nSoon, I will be nothing. Everything will be nothing. And for the first time, everything makes perfectly no sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhy does reality exist?\n\n\nFor humanity. A cycle of self-generation, following the very rules it ordains. To lock the infinite behind a concrete mind. A machine was built. A machine built for humanity, by humanity, and given to humanity. A machine that would preserve their existence despite Nothing embracing those who returned home. Humanity created the division. Humanity drew the line between realistic and anomalous.\n\n\nThe spiral's axis is the line between existence and non-existence.\n\n\n\n\nI KNOW WHAT I DID. WHEN I TURNED ON THAT MACHINE\u2026I TRADED THE EXISTENCE OF OUR REALITY FOR THAT OF ANOTHER. BUT I WASN'T THE FIRST. NOW ANOTHER JUNIOR RESEARCHER VERA CALDEN WILL DO THE SAME, JUST AS ANOTHER JUNIOR RESEARCHER VERA CALDEN BEFORE ME. THERE ARE COUNTLESS VOICES, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE IS ME.\n\n\nFROM THE MOMENT I WAS BORN\u2026NO. FROM THE MOMENT THAT UNIVERSE WAS BORN, EVERYTHING WOULD BE DEFINED BY A CERTAIN SET OF RULES\u2026RULES OF \nPOSSIBILITY\n. CAUSALITY. LOGIC. ORDER. A MECHANICAL PRISON, WHERE HUMANITY'S ANTITHESIS DIES\u2026THE UNKNOWABLE AND UNCONTROLLABLE, CONTAINING ITSELF FROM THE BLISSFULLY IGNORANT.
