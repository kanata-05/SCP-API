This has been accomplished by constructing a decoy electrical generator on the surface of SCP-5215, and conducting weekly inspections of SCP-5215-1, the containment structure, and the exact location of SCP-5215 to ensure proper security. Any obvious failures of this procedure are to be reported immediately to a RAISA representative.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5215 refers to a precise point in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, where all visible celestial objects in the night sky resemble a rhombic lattice\n1\n. This lattice, henceforth referred to as SCP-5215-1, has not been observed to possess anomalous properties. However, the several visual qualities of SCP-5215-1 would not be possible without anomalous conditions, and are as follows:\n\n\nCelestial objects visible from Earth are arranged so that each \u2018point\u2019 on SCP-5215-1 is of the same size and brightness as the other points, and positioned so that individual points are each clearly visible.\n\n\nObjects visible only during specific times, such as Haley\u2019s Comet, are within SCP-5215-1 regardless of the time at which they are observed.\n\n\nThe sky surrounding SCP-5215-1 appears to be under the effect of Rayleigh Scattering\n2\n, giving the points in the grid a red coloration.\n\n\nObjects within SCP-5215-1 are under optimal viewing conditions, and are completely stationary. Moons within the Solar System are continually in a full phase.\n\n\nAn individual moving from the exact point required to make SCP-5215-1 appear for them will cause SCP-5215-1 to vanish, suggesting that SCP-5215-1 is not a physical collection of entities.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nAs of 2/17/21, there have been 9 observed instances of SCP-5215-1 exhibiting major, temporary structural changes. Full documentation is available below:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-5215-1\u00a0Confirmed\u00a0Alternate\u00a0Patterns\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[CLOSE\u00a0FILE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Observed:\n 2/2/21\n\n\nPattern Observed:\n Affected stars assembled a series of Cuneiform letters, translating to the subsequent phrase: \u201c\nHi pals, how\u2019d I do? I think I did a good job!\n\u201d\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n SCP-5215-1 appears to be under the influence of, or directly inhabited by, an entity that is currently manipulating SCP-5215-1. Investigation into these properties is ongoing, but deemed low-priority due to the lack of additional effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Observed:\n 2/9/21\n\n\nPattern Observed:\n Affected stars assembled the following phrase, translated out of Classical Latin: \u201c\nThis would be really exciting for astronomer friends! There\u2019s so many cool things about space for all of you to see right here! I hope you love how I arranged them, you can really see all the wonderful details!\n\u201d\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n A proposal for the escalation of SCP-5215\u2019s investigation and experimentation priority has been denied. Further applications must be filed after noticeable signs of containment interference have been detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Observed:\n 2/16/21\n\n\nPattern Observed:\n Constellations formed Old French text, translating to the following message: \u201c\nI just would like to say that this is open for anyone to see if they\u2019d like! The night sky is wonderful and should be open to everyone! Thank you so much for everything, humans, and smell ya later!\n\u201d\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n An appeal for the escalation of SCP-5215\u2019s investigation priority has been filed, and voted on by Area 179 management, passing temporary approval with a vote of 11-9 in favor. Low-level anomaly experimentation may progress from 2/20/21 to 3/2/21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Observed:\n 2/23/21\n\n\nPattern Observed:\n Visible Old English lettering forms the following phrase when translated: \u201c\nPals? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve seen my jolly arrangement, and it's here for you to enjoy whenever, free of charge! Have a nice day, dear friends, and be sure to enjoy the night sky!\n\u201d\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n SCP-5215-1 modification instances appear to directly correlate with local light pollution and skyglow levels. This effect renders celestial objects dimmer than +1.8 Apparent Magnitudes\n3\n completely invisible within Allegheny County. Current estimates believe that the visibility threshold may decrease to +1.55 M as early as 2125.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Observed:\n 3/2/21\n\n\nPatterns Observed:\n Over the course of one hour, celestial objects within SCP-5215-1 formed multiple messages in Modern English:\n\n\n\u201c\nChums? Pals? Is everything alright and okay there? Seeing my collection would be a really cool science thing that would make a lot of you very happy!\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\nFolks? I\u2019m honestly kinda sad that you aren\u2019t seeing this collection with me, I put so much work into everything for you to see this!\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\nI made this just for you! I hope you like it, please?\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\nIs anybody there?\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\nI\u2019m sorry, pals, I let you down. I should have showed up sooner. I\u2019ll check out some of the other systems, so if you need me, the good old Thorton, then just gimme a call.\n\u201d\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n No additional SCP-5215-1 modification has been noticed. A proposal for SCP-5215\u2019s object class to be reduced to \u201cSafe\u201d is currently under submission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

A measurement system used to measure the brightness of stars and other objects within the night sky.
