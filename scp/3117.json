MTF Phi-11 (\"Promise-Keepers\") is to investigate these discussions and make a determination for appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nAny materials confirmed to contain components of SCP-3117 are to be isolated if possible, and \u2014 if not \u2014 referred to the Foundation's Disinformation Bureau for immediate action. Subjects who have experienced SCP-3117 are to be isolated for study.\n\n\nMTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\")\n are to continue the ongoing investigation regarding the location featured in Addendum 3117.1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3117 is a recurring dream triggered via exposure to certain components. These components take the form of specific ideas, concepts, phrases, and images. While exposure to all components are required to trigger occurrences of SCP-3117, these components can be spread across multiple forms of media (including film, audio, print, and still images). Consequently, no one source is known to contain all components responsible for triggering SCP-3117.\n\n\nAlthough subjects' experiences with SCP-3117 vary, the following symptoms have been noted among those who have or will experience SCP-3117:\n\n\n\n\nAn aversion to discussing or describing SCP-3117.\n\n\nSuspicion that they are receiving warnings regarding SCP-3117.\n\n\nA growing sense of urgency, inevitability, and/or dread.\n\n\nThe belief that they are being watched.\n\n\n\n\nIn approximately 1 out of 7 cases, subjects who experience SCP-3117 will go missing shortly after the dream's first occurrence. Investigations into this phenomenon are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 3117.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nIn 2006, a member of the \nGlobal Occult Coalition\n's PSYCHE Division contacted Site-95 with the goal of transferring responsibility for containment of \"UTE-2639-Pygmalion Blit\" over to Foundation care. After several months of negotiation, 378 items (including several hundred documents, digital files, photographs, and one Betamax tape) were taken into Foundation custody. After an extensive clearance process by the on-duty HMCL supervisor, these items have been catalogued as part of SCP-3117's documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3117/goc/035.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n15 March 2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n\n\nUTE-2639-Pygmalion Blit\n\n\nASSESSMENT TEAM:\n\n\n761 (\"PERIWINKLE\")\n\n\nIN ATTENDANCE\n\n\n52841285/761 (\"LADYBUG\")\n\n\n52883762/761 (\"VOODOO\")\n\n\nSUBJECT 2639-712 (\"GAMMA\")\n\n\n\n\nLADYBUG: Tell us about the dream.\n\n\nGAMMA: I'm in a woods, or a park, something like that.

The tape is labeled 'HOME MOVIE - 3/8/1983'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:00]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:02]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo begins. Screen displays title for 12 seconds: \"THIS IS WHERE SHE APPEARS IN THE DARK OF NIGHT\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:00:12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera is focused on a path extending into the forest which curves to the right. Graffiti is visible at the bottom of the frame; it reads: 'THIS IS WHERE SHE APPEARS IN THE DARK OF NIGHT'. The camera begins to move forward, following the path for 3 minutes.\n\n\nThe next 5 minutes are obscured by static.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:08:47]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:08:55]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe static clears. The camera is focused on a stone staircase that spirals into the earth. 35 seconds pass as it focuses on the view below. The bottom cannot be seen.\n\n\nThe camera slowly descends the staircase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:15:31]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:15:50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera stops descending and turns up to face the entrance. Approximately 20 seconds are spent focused on the entrance.\n\n\nAbruptly, the camera turns back to the stairs and proceeds to rapidly descend. Heavy breathing is now audible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:18:12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:18:23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera's erratic movements indicate running. A brief shot of the stairway is visible; the bottom still cannot be seen.\n\n\nHeavy breathing continues. In addition, there is now a muffled rumbling sound.\n\n\nThe next 10 minutes are obscured by static.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:28:36]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:28:41]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe static clears. The camera is now moving significantly slower, maintaining a steady pace. A loud, rhythmic sound \u2014 reminiscent of large machines grinding \u2014 is heard. The camera pauses to briefly look down the staircase; the bottom can still not be seen.\n\n\nThe next 30 minutes are obscured by static.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[00:59:55]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:61:17]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe static clears. The camera is focused on the edge of a stone railing; beyond it, there is a pit with a bright, glowing light coming from below. The rhythmic sound of metallic grinding continues.\n\n\nThe camera approaches the edge of the railing with caution, slowly angling down. The metallic grinding grows louder.\n\n\nThe remaining 7 minutes are obscured by static.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3117.2:\n Interview\n\n\nAs part of the agreement between the Foundation and the GOC, the Foundation was permitted to interview a former GOC operative (Jennifer Selwick) who had been part of the assessment team assigned to investigate SCP-3117.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3117/interviews/103.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2006/09/19\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Jenner\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Jennifer Selwick (former GOC operative)\n\n\n\n\n[\nBEGIN LOG.\n]\n\n\nJENNER:\n What can you tell me about SCP-3117?\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n You've got all our files on it.
