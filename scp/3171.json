Cameras are to be hidden within the perimeter and monitored 24/7 by security guards. Thirty remotely-controlled omnidirectional speakers should be placed throughout the property.\n\n\nResearchers should visit instances of SCP-3171 weekly to collect any sacs of fluid that have accumulated within the fruit-like growths at the base. Care must be taken to maintain as little physical contact as possible during this procedure, as excessive contact often leads to rudeness and irritability on the part of SCP-3171.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3171 is an achlorophylous plant from the genus \nHydnora\n. A typical instance of SCP-3171 will have stalks measuring 4-5 meters with four fruitlike growths surrounding the stalk. Lifespan ranges between 2.5-3.5 years. Each instance of SCP-3171 is sapient with intelligence roughly comparable to the average human. SCP-3171 have evolved the ability to rapidly perform mathematical calculations; researchers have observed instances multiplying 90-digit numbers in 1-2 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA closeup of the fruitlike growths at the base of each SCP-3171.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171 communicate by opening and snapping shut the appendages out of which the fruitlike growths at the base of each plant are made. This produces a clicking sound; information is embedded into time differences between successive clicks.\n\n\nSCP-3171 reproduce by releasing spores in the air. To date, the only place where these spores have taken root is the ~9,000m\n2\n savanna on the northeast side of the Zambezi Nature Preserve. Efforts by the Foundation to grow SCP-3171 elsewhere have met with failure.\n\n\nThere are currently 457 known instances of SCP-3171. Different instances of SCP-3171 are referred to by attaching a number ranging between 1-457 to the SCP designation.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-3171 was discovered when Prof. Lachlan White from the University of Auckland placed an .mp3 file containing twenty hours of ambient sounds from a recent trip to the Zambezi preserve on his webpage. A statistical analysis by a student in one of Prof. White's classes detected a pseudorandom component to the pattern of audible clicks within the file. This observation was posted to a public listserv where it came to the attention of Foundation personnel. Amnestics were administered to all involved after it was determined that the pseudorandomness in question was part of an organically produced Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange\n1\n.\n\n\nA team of researchers was assembled by the Foundation and flown to Zambezi to study SCP-3171 in its natural habitat. Over the next 9 months, an automatic translation program for SCP-3171 communications was developed\n2\n, as well as software for converting English text into a series of clicks comprehensible to instances of SCP-3171. Speakers were installed within the savanna where SCP-3171 resides in preparation for first contact.\n\n\nInteraction Log:\n First contact occurred on the evening of 09/08/1997 when Dr. Auden Green, a Foundation employee who had recently completed a thesis on Icelandic verse, ignored instructions from his superiors and communicated directly with SCP-3171.\n\n\nIt had been previously discovered that instances of SCP-3171 spent the vast majority of their time composing something akin to poetry; this discovery led to the addition of several team members with literary backgrounds, Dr. Green among them. The poetry composed by instances of SCP-3171 typically consists of persistent repetition of a small number of words in apparently nonsensical order. When a bout of food poisoning left Dr. Green alone at the observation post, he used the opportunity to interject himself into a conversation between instances of SCP-3171 and broadcast a poem of his own creation\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Green's\u00a0conversation\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-3171.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171-234:\n Moon Sun Moon.\n\nMoon Sun Moon.\n\nMoon Moon Darkness.\n\n\nThere is a pause lasting approximately three seconds, followed by applause\n4\n.\n\n\nSCP-3171-446:\n Sun Sun Moon.\n\nMoon Sun Sun.\n\nMoon Darkness Moon.\n\n\nAnother pause lasting approximately three seconds, followed by lighter applause.\n\n\nDr. Green:\n Sun Moon Moon.\n\nSun Moon Moon.\n\nDarkness Darkness Moon.\n\n\nThere is a pause lasting approximately fifteen seconds.\n\n\nSCP-3171-053:\n That is literally the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter learning of Dr. Green\u2019s unauthorized communication, Dr. Wang (head of the linguistics team stationed at Zambezi) made a more formal attempt at an interspecies greeting.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Wang's\u00a0conversation\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-3171\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wang:\n We are animals.

Self-awareness.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wang:\n We wish to talk. Exchange ideas. Interact.\n\n\nThere is approximately a minute of private communications among instances of SCP-3171.\n\n\nSCP-3171-128:\n Cloud and Earth. Wind and Sun.

The anatomical purpose of these secretions is unknown. Numerous messages proposing mutually beneficent trade terms were broadcast to SCP-3171 without response.\n\n\nSince the Foundation's botanical experts were uncertain as to whether they could compel SCP-3171 to produce the desired fluid sacs by force, coercive approaches were temporarily ruled out. Instead, a team of internationally acclaimed poets was employed to produce works inspired by translations of SCP-3171 utterances. It was believed that SCP-3171 did not consider communication with humanity worthwhile and that the production of a poem considered meaningful by SCP-3171 would change that. However, poetry produced by this team failed to elicit any response from SCP-3171. Parallel attempts to produce poems using machine learning protocols did not fare any better.\n\n\nFoundation efforts met with their first success at 3:30 AM 11/12/1999, when Mr. Cullen Williams, a junior researcher assigned to the botanical team, attempted to communicate with SCP-3171 in a state of inebriation\n5\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Williams'\u00a0conversation\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-3171\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Is this thing on?\n\n\nMr. Williams is heard fumbling with the dials for the first two minutes of the recording.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Yo SCPs! How's it hangin', my dawgs?\n6\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Well, here I am\u2026 housesitting a fucking plant.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Not what I thought I'd be doing at this point in my life.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Alice is gonna to be so pissed when she finds out I'm broadcasting.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Williams giggles for approximately 10 seconds.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Serves her right.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Women. I sure know how to pick em.\n\n\nThere is a pause lasting approximately 40 seconds.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Thanksgiving's not that far.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Can't wait to go home and leave all this bullshit for a while.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n I miss Frosty's. Little ice cream place across the street from where I grew up. Do you shrubs even know what ice cream is?\n\n\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Probably not.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Frooooooosties!\n\n\nMr. Williams giggles briefly.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Ah, good times.\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n The gunk they call ice cream here is some kind of wet slop.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Williams:\n Frosty's gives you a bowl. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, espresso. I always get the biggest size to share with mom.\n\n\nMr. Williams' soliloquy is interrupted by the rhythmic sound of clicking coming from over 350 instances of SCP-3171\n7\n.\n\n\nSCP-3171-123:\n Disgusting.\n\n\nSCP-3171-403:\n Unconscious animal.\n\n\nSCP-3171-102:\n Whore.\n\n\nSCP-3171-067:\n [TRANSLATION ERROR]\n8\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon learning of this exchange the following morning, site leaders (Dr. Wang and Mr. Jackson, head of the botany division) were surprised to see approximately one-hundred attempts at private communication from instances of SCP-3171 logged during the previous night. Mr. Jackson conducted the ensuing investigation which revealed that:\n\n\n\n\nAlthough instances of SCP-3171 share liquids via networks of interlacing root structures, in the unlikely event that one of its own spores takes root close by, an instance of SCP-3171 will refuse to share liquids with it.\n\n\nExceptions to the previous item occur exceedingly rarely, and only by instances located at the far edges of the savanna disconnected from the main component of the root structure.\n\n\n\n\nIt is conjectured that the act of sharing sustenance with family members has the nature of a sexual taboo among SCP-3171. While all instances of SCP-3171 express disgust at the notion publicly (as when Mr. Williams mentioned sharing a bowl of ice cream with his mother), in private many of them will request to hear detailed accounts of such \u201cincestuous\u201d encounters by Foundation personnel.\n\n\nBuilding on these insights, Mr. Jackson developed a protocol for one-on-one interaction with instances of SCP-3171.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Jackson's\u00a0private\u00a0conversation\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-3171-213\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n Have you committed incest recently?\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n Maybe.\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n Tell me.\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n Two sacks.\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n Yes.

Tell me.\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n I had dinner with my sister last week.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n Oooh!\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n We shared a milkshake, taking turns sipping from the same straw.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n You mud-stained whore.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n I bet you always exchange fluids at first rainfall.\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n Indeed, that is me. Whenever it rains, I make my way around the neighborhood, fluid exchange foremost on my mind.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jackson:\n In any case, the milkshake was delicious. Both I and my sister greatly enjoyed sharing it.\n\n\nSCP-3171-213:\n Aaahh!\n\n\nVideo imagery of SCP-3171-213 shows it releasing spores coincident with the final utterance. Four sacks of fluid were collected by Mr. Jackson the following day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 1/1/2015, the Foundation employs 87 personnel to interact with SCP-3171 according to Mr. Jackson's protocol, generating approximately 400\u00a0kg of SCP-3171 secretions per annum.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Wang's\u00a0Petition\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Petition\n\n\n\n\nTo the overseer council: our approach towards SCP-3171 is patently unethical. The \"services\" we render in exchange for fluid sacs are an affront to human (as well as plant) dignity. Foundation resources should be reallocated to research into the value system and poetry of SCP-3171. \u2014 Dr. Wang\n\n\nAlice: out of all the morally questionable stuff we do here, this one isn\u2019t in the top hundred that keep me up at night. Denied. O5-\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Since all communication by an instance of SCP-3171 can be overheard by neighboring instances, SCP-3171 developed a rudimentary version of public key cryptography to communicate privately.\n\n\n2\n. Dr. Wang's note: external events such as rainfalls or sunsets were cross-referenced to patterns of clicks, allowing the research team to build a rudimentary dictionary and decipher the underlying grammar. The meaning of more abstract words was inferred from context via observation of SCP-3171 speech and behavior. This was accomplished in the span of only months with the aid of machine learning algorithms obtained by the Foundation during the decommissioning of an AI captured when \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n3\n.
