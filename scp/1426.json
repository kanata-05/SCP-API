Any personnel wishing to use SCP-1426 for testing purposes must have prior written permission from two (2) level three (3) personnel, plus testing approval from the Site Director.\n\n\nSCP-1426 bits are to be sterilised thoroughly before use, to prevent contamination of extracted samples. SCP-1426 bits are only to be tested on sterilised concrete breeze blocks, to reduce wear on the bits.\n\n\nSamples extracted are to be sealed in sterile, airtight boxes and stored in the glovebox in Research Lab-16 for study.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1426-1 to -9 are \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Electrical brand 52x150mm diamond-tipped core drill bits. When SCP-1426 bits are used to core a substance, the cylinder of material extracted is not the original material drilled. Instead, the sample will be an equal volume from a solid body in the Solar System. The body that the sample is extracted from is entirely dependent on the colour of the bit used. Occasionally, samples retrieved by SCP-1426 bits will show properties not present on some of the bodies that said samples are cored from (see Addendum-1426-1). The name of the body that the sample is taken from is etched into the side of all the bits. There is a very small chance (0.35%) that no sample will be retrieved. Instead, a rolled up piece of paper will be present inside the bit after drilling is complete. The contents of these pieces of paper vary with the drill bit used, but will always be a handwritten copy of part of their respective movements in Gustav Holst's symphony \nThe Planets\n. If the body is a moon, the movement will be of the planet they orbit. If the body has no movement, then the paper will show a non-existent movement, written to fit with the last existing movement of \nThe Planets\n (Neptune).\n\n\nSamples retrieved via SCP-1426 will maintain the temperature of the body they were cored from. In one test, SCP-1426-2 was used to drill a breeze block, and the sample retrieved was consistent with available data concerning the average surface temperature of Venus. SCP-1426 bits and the drill that they are being used with are not damaged by the properties of the sample they extract, but will wear down like ordinary core drill bits.\n\n\nSCP-1426 was discovered in the town of A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England, when builder \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 suffered 3rd degree burns to his left hand after attempting to remove a portion of a brick wall he had just drilled with SCP-1426-2. A routine Foundation sweep picked up the report and SCP-1426 was retrieved and transported to Reliquary Research and Containment Site-76. All other core drill bits examined at the local \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Electrical store showed no anomalous properties. Mr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and all witnesses were given Class-B amnestics and released.\n\n\nAddendum-1426-1:\n Current instances of SCP-1426.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour of bit\n\n\nBody sample extracted from\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrey\n\n\nMercury\n\n\nTemperature of sample depends on the temperature at Caloris Basin.
