Its development and deployment was disguised by the publicly announced Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), disparagingly known as \"Star Wars\", which was put forth by then-President Ronald Reagan during the same year. Officially, SCP-1514 is known as SDI-\u2588\u2588 System \"Xye\", and numerous components of it were developed by legitimate SDI research and development groups (namely Project Excalibur-\u2588\u2588). Known records indicate that the system was functional from 198\u2588 to 198\u2588, at which point the artifact's malfunctions and subsequent investigation by the Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU), Federal Bureau of Investigation brought SCP-1514 to the Foundation's attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1514-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1514-1A is a 1.5m x 0.9m x 0.6m device comprised mainly of steel. Various instruments along its exterior display the homeostatic state of an entity (SCP-1514-1B) currently residing inside the device. SCP-1514-1A is powered by an unknown internal source, and contains what is believed to be a sophisticated life-support system utilizing an unidentified dark red liquid. Due to the inherent risks of tampering with the device (see below), details regarding SCP-1514-1B and the life-support system are unclear or speculative. The remaining instruments belong to an interface system designed to input and receive data from SCP-1514-1B.\n\n\nInformation on SCP-1514-2 is limited and has thus far only been provided by documentation received from the UIU, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] (see \nDOCUMENT-SCP-1514-RM4\n for details). However, it is confirmed that SCP-1514-2 are a series of \u2588\u2588 satellites currently in orbit around Earth. Superficially they resemble the [REDACTED] satellite, with what is believed to be an array of 12 tactical X-ray laser (xaser) devices attached to the anterior side. The solar panels visible on SCP-1514-2 instances are reported to be fake, as the satellites' propulsion and weapon systems are powered by an alternative, anomalous source. Design specifications indicate the xaser system was originally to be utilized for disabling Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), though targeting algorithms do exist for ground-based targets.\n\n\nSCP-1514-1A generates an anomalous radio transmission once every hour, broadcasting to the nearest SCP-1514-2 instance. This transmission cannot be deterred or disrupted through any known method, including Faraday cage structures. According to documentation provided by [REDACTED], failure to receive this signal for a period lasting longer than 36 hours constitutes the immediate and autonomous implementation of the Coronet Contingency, causing all SCP-1514-2 instances to fire upon their preset land-based targets. Due to the scope of the Coronet Contingency, which was engineered by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and is far more extensive than was intended by the US government, this event has been deemed a probable XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario.\n\n\nInformation from [REDACTED] has indicated that several components of SCP-1514 were developed by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 through CIA Project M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 between 196\u2588 and 196\u2588, though it is unknown what the original purpose of these components were (see \nDOCUMENT-SCP-1514-RM27\n for details).\n\n\nSCP-1514-1A's interface is currently unresponsive to input, rendering all manual offensive and defensive capabilities of SCP-1514-2 defunct. This malfunction also prevents deactivation of the Coronet Contingency: this danger was the impetus for [REDACTED] contacting the Foundation and the subsequent Foundation custody of the artifact. While SCP-1514-1A is unresponsive to input, it has been observed to generate text messages via the control panel monitor:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0DOCUMENT-SCP-1514-O\u00a0(CLEARANCE\u00a04/1514\u00a0REQUIRED)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0DOCUMENT-SCP-1514-O\u00a0(IDENTITY\u00a0VERIFIED)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you hear\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm happy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the stars pretty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1513\n | SCP-1514 | \nSCP-1515\n \u00bb",
