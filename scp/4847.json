The Foundation has installed a subterranean containment facility under an uninhabited island in the North Atlantic ocean (designated Area-\u2588\u2588) in preparation of SCP-4847's containment. Area-\u2588\u2588 has been constructed around a central gigafauna containment cell, fitted with 12 Scranton Reality Anchors and 8 Tachyon Disruptor Engines. The single blast door leading to the containment cell is to be permanently sealed upon SCP-4847's containment.\n\n\nIn the event of containment breach, all on-site personnel are to immediately initiate Procedure 39-Mobilov and notify O5 command of the breach. MTF units \nLambda-5 (\"White Rabbits\")\n and Iota-3 (\"Tomorrow Never Comes\") are to be immediately dispatched to Area-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4847 is understood to be a reality-altering entity of unknown origin. SCP-4847 is reported to be able to manipulate its physical form using its abilities; as such, SCP-4847 has no definitive physical description. However, it has been reported to consistently mask its form under cloud cover or light refraction.\n\n\nSCP-4847 is reported to have breached containment on 2018/11/22 after causing extensive damage to Site-39\n1\n, where it was being contained. Given the circumstances surrounding SCP-4847's discovery, much of the information regarding SCP-4847 has been recorded from memory by members of Division Requiem; as such, certain elements of SCP-4847 may be inaccurate.\n\n\nSite-39 was initially discovered during MTF investigation of distress signals from an unknown location on a secured Foundation network. Upon arrival at signal origin, MTF units located a partially destroyed facility; further investigation revealed numerous Foundation-style components, including one large containment cell containing multiple Scranton Reality Anchors exhibiting various amounts of damage. Notably, this was the only containment cell located at the facility.\n\n\nDuring the Site-39 investigation, MTF units discovered a contingent of 22 researchers in the ruins of the facility. Given that, at the time, Site-39 was not a registered Foundation installation, all researchers encountered were temporarily designated SCP-4847-1 through 22 and detained at Site-\u2588\u2588 for interrogation. All of the researchers were carrying identification labelling them as Foundation personnel, although only 6 were recorded in Foundation databases as employed researchers. However, these 6 researchers were confirmed as working at other sites at the time; they were quickly brought in to aid with questioning.\n\n\nGenetic testing of 6 pre-existing researchers and their Site-39 counterparts revealed identical genome sequences between each pair, indicating that they are, in essence, the same person; although, all 6 of the Site-39 counterparts showed marked signs of ageing compared to their pre-existing versions.\n\n\nAnalysis of three partially-fragmented information drives recovered from Site-39 revealed documents ranging in date from 2040/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 to 2044/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588. When questioned about the date, all 22 researchers believed themselves to be in the year 2044. These answers, combined with the information drives, researcher identification, and genetic sequencing, has lead the Foundation to believe that SCP-4847, Site-39, and the 22 researchers are all from a prospective point in time. This has lead to the hypothesis that SCP-4847 has an understanding of, and the ability to manipulate the temporal continuum. In an attempt to nullify further temporal relocation, the 22 researchers (Now known as Division Requiem) have worked with the Foundation to develop technology for this cause.\n\n\n\n\nDocument 4847-DR-TDE00:\n The Tachyon Disruptor Engine (TDE) is an experimental collaborative effort between Division Requiem and Foundation staff intended to limit localised temporal instability. Based on current models of special relativity, the TDE is theorised to \"lock\" pockets of space-time by prohibiting superluminal molecular speeds in the surrounding vicinity. Particles in the TDE field of effect should be unable to be energised to the point of superluminal velocity, thus preventing manipulation of the temporal continuum. Due to the nature of reality-altering anomalies, conjunctive use of the TDE with Scranton Reality Anchors is necessary. Testing of the TDEs on other temporal anomalies is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the veracity of statements made by the Division Requiem cannot be proven, it currently serves as the most explicable reason for Site-39's sudden appearance. Furthermore, whilst Division Requiem is permitted to collaborate with current Foundation researchers on matters relating to SCP-4847 (under constant supervision), the Foundation is still considering the possibility that Division Requiem is a fraudulent contingent with motives detrimental to the Foundation.\n\n\nSince the limit and scope of SCP-4847's abilities is unknown, O5 command is treating SCP-4847 as at least a Class III reality-altering anomaly, and hypothetically capable of inducing a CK-class Reality Restructuring or ZK-class Reality Failure event.\n\n\n\n\n+Addendum-4847-1:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Dr\u00a0Pride\u00a0(Formerly\u00a0SCP-4847-16)\n\n\n\n\n-Addendum-4847-1:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Dr\u00a0Pride\u00a0(Formerly\u00a0SCP-4847-16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Dr Emilia Pride (Formerly known as and referred to as SCP-4847-16)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Level 5 Researcher Dr Connor Baker\n\n\nSpectators:\n Level 5 Researcher Dr Martin Vasiliev, Level 5 Researcher Dr Morgan Robins\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr Pride is questioned about SCP-4847.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, 03:47pm 2018/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588>\n\n\nDr Pride and SCP-4847-16 are sitting opposite each other in an interview room.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n Please state your name.\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n My name is Dr Emilia Pride.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n Dr Pride, can you please tell me about SCP-4847.\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n I'll tell you what I know, which, admittedly, isn't much. Most of our tests didn't end well.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n Any information is critical, as I'm sure you are aware.\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n Yes. Well, where do I start. Keter. Reality-bender. Time-bender too, apparently. Go figure.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n That brings up a question. Did Site-39 have any technology intended to prevent SCP-4847 from travelling through time?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n No. We had no idea it was capable of that. Until the breach, our SRAs kept it fully in check; we had no breaches prior to the current one. It must have figured out a way around the SRAs.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n I'll make a note of that. Can you describe SCP-4847's behaviour. Is it hostile?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n [//Pause]] Yes, I suppose so. But I wouldn't say it's malicious.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n It didn't seem inherently violent, but, more self-preservative. It would attack anything we sent at it, but it wouldn't go looking for people to kill. It's almost\u2026 animalistic.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n I see. Do you think it would be possible to reason with SCP-4847?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n No, no\u2026 We tried speaking to it, but it never responded. It's obviously sentient, but it never indicated it was \nsapient\n.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n Hmm. What else can you tell me about 4847?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n Hmm\u2026 Oh! Its hume levels were always in a constant state of flux. Like it couldn't control it. I haven't seen anything like it. I saw its external humes hit 32 once.\n\n\nDr Baker:\n Sorry, did you say 32?\n\n\nSCP-4847-16:\n Yeah. Crazy, isn't it?\n\n\n<End Log, 3:50pm 2018/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588>\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the interview of Dr Pride, containment priority of SCP-4847 was increased to high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Addendum-4847-2:\u00a0Containment\u00a0Attempt\u00a0Log\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n-Addendum-4847-2:\u00a0Containment\u00a0Attempt\u00a0Log\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Attempt Log 1\n\n\nMTF Units:\n Lambda-5 \"Ghostbusters\", Iota-3 \"Tomorrow Never Comes\"\n\n\nForeword:\n A Ukrainian helicopter pilot reported a sighting of \"some huge creature\" moving around inside a solitary thundercloud on an otherwise clear day.

A solitary thundercloud can be seen in the distance.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Bullpitt, tell me again that our equipment is ready to go.\n\n\nLieutenant Bullpitt:\n Check, Commander. All SRAs and TDEs operational and functioning correctly.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n They better be. If I get sent back to the 70's, I'm coming for you. I hate Elton John.\n\n\nLieutenant Bullpitt laughs weakly.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Liven up Bullpitt. This'll be over before you know it. Iota-3, how are you guys doing?\n\n\nCommander Michaels:\n We're prepped and good to go. Where are we going for drinks after this?\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n We'll think of that when we get there. \n[\nClaps hands\n]\n Alright gentlemen, it's game time. Let's split, Michaels, you bank right.\n\n\nCommander Michaels:\n Copy.\n\n\nAs Lambda-5 begins banking left, all TDEs aboard Lambda-5s vehicle begin humming loudly.\n\n\nLieutenant Bullpitt:\n Commander, I'm picking up tachyons around our VTOL. It's trying to send us back.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Dispatch, give me the time and date.\n\n\nFoundation Dispatch:\n Lambda-5, the time is 11:50am EEST, 2019/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n [\nLaughs\n] The TDEs are working boys. Let's get this over with.\n\n\nAs Lambda-5 and Iota-3 begin closing, a loud roar is recorded on the helmet camera. A single, massive tendril extends from SCP-4847 and slashes at the Iota-3 VTOL. Iota-3 tries to evade, but the tendril connects with an engine and Iota-3 begins spiralling downwards.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Shit! Sawyer, fire at that thing. We don't have the equipment to contain it by ourselves.\n\n\nLambda-5 fires multiple missiles and artillery rounds at SCP-4847. The space around SCP-4847 begins shimmering before SCP-4847 vanishes, along with 3 missiles. The rest continue on their trajectory.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Michaels, do you copy? Dispatch, we've lost visual on 4847 and Iota-3 is down.\n\n\nThe helmet cam looks out the window and sees the Iota-3 VTOL flaming on the ground below.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Sawyer, take us down. Iota-3, do you copy?\n\n\nCorporal Prince:\n This is Prince from Iota-3. I copy.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n Thank fuck. What's the situation down there? Put Michaels on the radio.\n\n\nCorporal Prince:\n Negative Commander. Vaughn and the others, they're gone.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn:\n [\nPause\n] They're all dead?\n\n\nCorporal Prince:\n No Commander, they're \ncompletely\n gone. I'm the only body left down here.\n\n\nCommander Vaughn is silent, before throwing his radio across the cabin.\n\n\nLieutenant Bullpitt:\n Dispatch, confirm copy.

The log was dated 1986/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588. The transcript is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nUnknown:\n Vaughn, do you copy? I repeat, Commander Vaughn, do you copy? Dispatch, do you copy? We're on foot.
