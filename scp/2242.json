Confirmation that SCP-2242 has not migrated is still pending final determination by Technical Researcher David Rosen.\n1\n\n\nFollowing the changeover, a small LAN\n2\n of approximately twelve stations will be maintained with FOS 14.1 at Site 15 for future surveillance and potential information exchange opportunities. Additional devices may be temporarily reverted to FOS 14.1 for research purposes at other facilities with approval from staff of Security Clearance 3/2242.\n\n\nIn the event of future SCP-2242 manifestations outside of FOS 14.1, non-essential access to all Foundation servers will be suspended until reversion to a stable and uninfected software iteration is completed.\n\n\nUntil total neutralization of SCP-2242 has been confirmed, digital storage of the following on any iteration of FOS is prohibited:\n\n\n\n\nAll documents requiring Level 5 Security Clearance.\n\n\nAll documents pertaining to extradimensional communication, dislocation, and integration.\n\n\nPersonnel files which have been updated within the last 90 days.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2242 is a phenomenon affecting FOS 14.1\n3\n and all records accessed using this software. No prior iterations have displayed any similar anomalous properties. SCP-2242 is currently understood to be an extradimensional connection to the intranet servers of the Foundation from an alternate timeline. To date these two instances of the Foundation\n3\n have only been able to interact by minor footnote and bibliographic reference alterations to documents with shared intranet locations.\n4\n Notations from baseline reality have the conventional \"Footnotes\" titling of the in-text and post-text citations; notations from SCP-2242-1 are labeled as \"Reference\" in-text and do not appear in a post-text citation block. Access to the SCP-2242-1 version of documents occurs at random intervals when attempting to access any intranet location extant within both realities, and it is understood that this effect is comparable within SCP-2242-1.\n\n\nCircumstantial evidence has led to the standing hypothesis that knowledge of SCP-2242 has not become ubiquitous among all Foundation personnel in SCP-2242-1 who would have had contact with affected documentation. It is instead believed that the information has been confined to personnel within the Information Technology Department, a small group of personnel from various other departments, and at least one member of the O5 Council.\n\n\nSCP-2242-1 has thus far been understood to conform to the same theories of physics as believed to govern baseline reality. Current estimates based on collected data hypothesize SCP-2242-1 to be approximately 97% identical to baseline reality; while the differences between the two timelines have resulted in some variations, all major historical events appear to be generally intact.\n4\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The first appearance of SCP-2242 activity was recorded on 01/13/2016, approximately forty-eight hours after the release of FOS 14.1; this has since been identified as coinciding with the release of FOS 14.11 in SCP-2242-1.\n5\n Integration of reference notations from both realities was complete within the following twenty-four hours.\n\n\nInitial theories presumed that the notations likely stemmed from a non-anomalous source, with the prevailing theory quickly becoming that of a cyber attack by an unspecified GOI. The lack of any coding on affected pages to correspond with the notations from SCP-2242-1 was discovered shortly thereafter, prompting reevaluation for potential anomalous properties. Further communication with the authors of the notations led to the current understanding of the situation. Verification of this phenomenon as authentic and anomalous was not determined until O5-7 reported receiving a communication\n5\n from their analogue within SCP-2242-1 confirming the existence of an extradimensional information breach.\n\n\nNotable Statistical Disparities Within SCP-2242-1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a02\u00a0Security\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Required.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Credentials\u00a0approved.\u00a0Access\u00a0recorded.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher's Note: The following statistics are presented as examples of the variance recorded between baseline reality and that of SCP-2242-1. It is not to be taken as a comprehensive list. Unabridged access to full demographic statistics is limited to personnel of Level 4 Security Clearance.\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\nTotal global population of SCP-2242-1 is estimated at 7.1 billion, approximately 300 million fewer than baseline reality. No significant alterations to historical events have currently been identified to account for this large of a disparity.\n\n\nLeft-handed individuals are estimated to make up 14% of the population of SCP-2242-1, as opposed to the approximately 10% in baseline reality.\n\n\nApproximately one out of every 129 individuals in one timeline has never existed in the other timeline.\n\n\n\nAt least 77 Foundation personnel in baseline reality have no record of employment with the Foundation in SCP-2242-1. Twenty-three of these individuals have no records of ever existing within SCP-2242-1.\n\n\nAt least 86 of SCP-2242-1's Foundation's personnel have no record of employment with baseline reality's Foundation. Twenty-two of these individuals have no records of ever existing in this timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomalous\n\n\n\n\nClassification policies of the Foundation within SCP-2242-1 are significantly more cautious.\n\n\n\nFifty-one objects from our \nLog of Anomalous Items\n have been given full SCP Item classifications within SCP-2242-1. Because of this, numerical designations for dozens of entries are inconsistent between the timelines.\n\n\nIn 13 cases, Items classified as Safe by our Foundation have been designated Euclid by SCP-2242-1's Foundation.\n\n\nIn 35 cases, Items classified as Euclid by our Foundation have been designated Keter by SCP-2242-1's Foundation.\n\n\nIn two cases, Items classified as Safe by our Foundation have been designated Keter by SCP-2242-1's Foundation.\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 19 Items previously undiscovered by our Foundation were identified by the records of the Foundation within SCP-2242-1.\n\n\n\nSix of these Items have since been contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2242-1's Foundation had not previously identified 28 Items within our records.\n\n\n\nTen of these Items have since been contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Credentials\u00a0approved.\u00a0Access\u00a0recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 01/29/2016:\n Recent reports from SCP-2242-1 confirm that the phenomenon has expanded to include additional realities.\n6\n Preliminary communication between SCP-2242-1 and these new instances, which have been designated SCP-2242-1-(1~7), indicates that the phenomenon continues to be isolated within Foundation intranet servers across all realities. Of note is increased variation in the affected FOS iterations, which now range from version 12.5 (in SCP-2242-1-2) to version 16.1.1 (in SCP-2242-1-5). Non-essential access to FOS 14.1 has been suspended while the extent of this effect and the potential fallout scenarios are determined; reversion to FOS 13.6 is currently underway.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
