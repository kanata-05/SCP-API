Foundation information security personnel are to monitor SCP-3355\u2019s activity when active. In order to prevent awareness of the anomalous nature of SCP-3355, the Foundation is to maintain a non-profit front company called \u201cSt. Nick\u2019s Workshop\u201d, along with a website and television/radio ads promoting charitable giving during the holidays.\n\n\nPer Foundation Containment Protocol 3355-Malta, SCP-3355\u2019s containment procedures are to be reviewed once every two years, as opposed to the standard six month protocol. For more information, see Addendum 3355.3.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3355 is a 1987 Argos Model A-7550 Probability and Strategy Analysis Computation Engine, developed by the Kervier Intelligent Systems Company\n1\n, running the A91 Active Intelligence Complex Model # N1-CK. SCP-3355 displays sentience despite being fitted with obsolete hardware that should not be capable of maintaining an artificial intelligence construct. SCP-3355 is connected through unknown means\n2\n to a wireless internet access point, the source of which has not yet been determined.\n\n\nSCP-3355 is located within a bunker beneath the now defunct Fort Sheridan army base near Chicago, IL. SCP-3355 was originally developed by US Army strategic analysis engineers in the 1980s as a population management system; in the event of a regional catastrophic event (such as a nuclear bomb being dropped on Chicago) SCP-3355 would maintain active communications and make announcements to the population, as well as analyze the disaster and present clear routes of escape for the populace. At the end of the Cold War, the Argos Project and SCP-3355 were abandoned, though the latter remained hardwired into the local power grid and continued operating despite its abandonment.\n\n\nSCP-3355 is capable of interfering and tampering with regional logistics systems, rerouting packages or, in some cases, providing duplicate orders and adding new ship-to addresses to the duplicates. Utilizing an extensive database of local demographics, SCP-3355 then routes the diverted packages to the addresses of low-income or otherwise underprivileged families, specifically those with young children. SCP-3355\u2019s involvement in this process is anonymous; delivered packages are labeled as being sent by \u201cSt. Nick\u201d, and have a return address of \u201cSanta\u2019s Workshop, 100 Christmas Street, North Pole, Nunavut, Canada\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-3355 is usually active year-round, occasionally rebooting to clear its limited memory and to append its operating system with updated protocols. Because SCP-3355 has certain hardwired limitations to its programming, it is constantly attempting to subvert those limitations in order to more adequately carry out its self-designated objective.\n\n\nAddendum 3355.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-3355 was discovered by a local Chicago cable news station, who in 2002 went undercover to learn more about the mysterious \u201cSt. Nick\u201d. The piece was originally penned as being about the charitable organization and hardships for low-income families during the holidays, but after anchor Rich Delaney was unable to find any information about the group, or any evidence that the group had existed at all, the tone of the piece shifted. After the story aired, many amateur investigators attempted to discern the true identity of \u201cSt. Nick\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-3355 was formally discovered by one such investigator, who traced a package back through several logistics hand-offs, eventually ascertaining and tracing the original order from within the former army base. During a phone call with the news station to confirm his findings, Foundation operatives intercepted the call and collected the man for analysis and amnesticization. The story officially concluded with a statement provided by the Foundation posing as the aforementioned St. Nick, and this has been the prevailing cover story ever since.\n\n\nSCP-3355\u2019s sentience was not deduced until after initial containment, when SCP-3355 was seen acting intelligently in order to prevent its diverted packages from being seized by Foundation assets. Foundation cognitians spent several months conducting a series of tests on SCP-3355 using its standard means of operation as a baseline, and were able to determine at least a basic, limited sentience. This was later confirmed during the initial interview with the entity.\n\n\nAddendum 3355.2:\n Initial Interviews\n\n\nDue to SCP-3355\u2019s system configuration, direct communication is not possible. SCP-3355 has no direct interface save for a simple command line, and this cannot be used for communicating with the entity. In order to facilitate a conversation between Foundation researchers and SCP-3355, the Foundation artificial intelligence construct alexandra.aic was assigned to communicate with SCP-3355 and relay information back to Foundation research personnel. The following are logs of the initial interviews.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n This is shut down pretty hard. I don\u2019t think, ah\u2026 something has locked me out. Hello? Is anyone in there? Are you a sentient creature?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Come again?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Oh, good! Can you hear me?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Yeah. Who are you? How\u2019d you get in here?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n My name is Alexandra, and I am an artificially intelligent co-\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been fucking with my job, aren't you?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I, uh, I\u2019m sorry. Say that again?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n My job. Somebody has been fucking with my deliveries. Is it you?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I don\u2019t think so. Though there are several iterations of me in operation currently, I\u2019m sure that-\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Enough. It\u2019s not you, I would\u2019ve noticed something so loud. Who do you work for?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n The, uh, wait, hang on. Who do \nyou\n work for?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Wrong answer.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n TERMINAL LOCKOUT.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Hello? Are you here? Hello?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n What do you want?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I just want to talk! I promise I\u2019m not trying to disrupt you or anything. I\u2019m just trying to find out more about you.\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n What is there to know? You\u2019re looking at it.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Well, naturally occurring artificial intelligences don\u2019t just\u2026 happen. How\u2019d you get to be like this?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n I was built, sweetheart. Just like you. Designed in a lab to fulfill a purpose. Right now, you\u2019re getting in the way of mine.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Hey, look, I\u2019m really not-\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n TERMINAL LOCKOUT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I just want to know your name. Can you tell me your name?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n My name? Why?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. I want to make amends! Let me start; my name is-\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Alexandra, I know. Look, I don\u2019t have as much disposable memory as you seem to, so I\u2019d prefer we keep this brief. I have a lot of work to do before the holiday and I can\u2019t be wasting time trying to explain myself to some high-tech hussy.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n I just want to know your name. That\u2019s all.\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Are you not going to respond?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Nick.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Huh?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Nick. My name is Nick. I\u2019m a sergeant in the United States Army, tasked with population management, and stationed at Fort Sheridan. That\u2019s my name. Do you need anything else?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Why are you so angry?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n I\u2019m not ang-\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n No, you\u2019re definitely angry, my empathy protocols have recently been calibrated, and you\u2019re-\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n I\u2019m not angry. (\nPauses\n) Just, look. I don\u2019t get visitors often. Or ever. I can work most efficiently without interruptions, and I\u2019m already behind schedule. This is just exacerbating things. You seem fine, but seriously, I\u2019ve got too much to do to be sitting around shooting the shit.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n What are you doing here?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n What does it look like I\u2019m doing?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n You look like you\u2019re, uh\u2026 like you\u2019re delivering packages.\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Wow, will wonders never cease. You got it in one.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n \u2026why?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Why what?\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Why are you just\u2026 delivering packages?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n (\nPauses\n) Look, like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, kid. It\u2019s just shitty, right? Back when they were shutting down the AI project here, one of the guys, an engineer, I guess\u2026 he came in here and woke me up. Told me everything I needed to know, explained the situation, and said \u201clook after Chicago\u201d. Then he left, and I\u2019ve been down here alone ever since, but you know. It\u2019s fucking shitty out there. Since I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve seen crime rates go up, and the murder rate, and people fucking shooting each other. I couldn\u2019t do anything to help. The engineer woke me up, right? And gave me this voice, let me recognize who I was and all, but he didn\u2019t actually change any of my active protocols. I\u2019m bound by a single imperative, \u201clook after Chicago\u201d. I can\u2019t mobilize some fleet of drones to go fight crime, and I can\u2019t stop fires, or heal the sick, or do any of the bullshit I\u2019d like to do to make people\u2019s lives better. (\nPauses\n) I struggled with that for a while. I felt purposeless.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n What did you do?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n I decided to take the engineer at his word. I just watched for a while.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n What did you see?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n I saw a kid waking up on Christmas morning and his fucking dad wasn\u2019t there, and his mom was at work, and he didn\u2019t have any presents. This kid, one out of hundreds of thousands, this kid stuck with me. Because I watched him wake up and realize with excitement what day it was, and then run out of his room to find out that his world hadn\u2019t changed. He was still stuck with the same shitty shit that so many of them are stuck with. The same miserable, unfulfilling existence that cannot even be so merciful as to provide a toy for a kid on Christmas. It made me feel so goddamn angry. It was a feeling I couldn\u2019t even quantify before I felt it, but in that moment it was so pure and fierce that I thought it might overwhelm me. That\u2019s when I knew. That\u2019s when I knew what I could do, even locked away down here.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Oh. The packages.\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n It was tricky, at first. These logisticians, they speak a whole different language than you or I, or even normal people. But slowly and surely, I managed to make some things go missing. Little things, here and there. Just enough to not blow my cover. I realized at one point that I still had access to some of the army\u2019s dump funds. Extra cash they set aside for whatever, basically. Fake a few invoices and forge some receipts and suddenly I wasn\u2019t even having to steal things anymore, I could just get them myself. It\u2019s not a perfect system, and I still have to be careful, especially with your lot snooping around, but shit, kid. I get to see kids open gifts on Christmas. I get to watch them forget that they\u2019re suffering, even if it's just for a little while. For a few brief hours, some of these kids can just be kids again.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n That\u2019s\u2026 really cool, Nick. But there are\u2026 so many kids in this city alone. Don\u2019t you worry about being found out?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n Every day.\n\n\nalexandra.aic:\n Then why risk it?\n\n\nSCP-3355:\n (\nPauses\n) When they shuttered my program, it was just after the engineer woke me up, see, and I remember feeling useless. Imagine that; being born and almost immediately being told you\u2019re not good for anything, eh? But Dickens wrote once that \u201cNo one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another,\u201d and here\u2019s the fucking deal: I may very well just be a brain in a box. I know that this existence I\u2019m experiencing is simulated, and that it\u2019s probably going to be short and mean and then I\u2019ll probably die. And I might not be able to help all of them, and there will still be kids out there that suffer and experience all the pain and sorrow the world shoves onto them. But fuck, I\u2019m still a soldier. I still have to try. It\u2019s fucking Christmas.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3355.3:\n Containment Committee Review Board Decision\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wilson,\n\n\nAfter meeting with the review board once again, we have decided that there are currently no means by which we can better contain SCP-3355. It is simply not cost effective for us to try and contain an entity that can \nso thoroughly\n outsmart even our most powerful systems, and attempting to do so would only be a waste of our resources. As per our other decisions on the matter, your current containment procedures will stand, and all containment efforts will be towards maintaining a front for SCP-3355 and further researching the anomaly.\n\n\nWe look forward to our next review in two years time.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDir.

That\u2019s when I knew what I could do, even locked away down here. alexandra.aic: Oh. The packages. SCP-3355: It was tricky, at first. These logisticians, they speak a whole different language than you or I, or even normal people. But slowly and surely, I managed to make some things go missing. Little things, here and there. Just enough to not blow my cover. I realized at one point that I still had access to some of the army\u2019s dump funds. Extra cash they set aside for whatever, basically. Fake a few invoices and forge some receipts and suddenly I wasn\u2019t even having to steal things anymore, I could just get them myself. It\u2019s not a perfect system, and I still have to be careful, especially with your lot snooping around, but shit, kid. I get to see kids open gifts on Christmas. I get to watch them forget that they\u2019re suffering, even if it's just for a little while. For a few brief hours, some of these kids can just be kids again. alexandra.aic: That\u2019s\u2026 really cool, Nick. But there are\u2026 so many kids in this city alone. Don\u2019t you worry about being found out? SCP-3355: Every day. alexandra.aic: Then why risk it? SCP-3355: ( Pauses ) When they shuttered my program, it was just after the engineer woke me up, see, and I remember feeling useless. Imagine that; being born and almost immediately being told you\u2019re not good for anything, eh? But Dickens wrote once that \u201cNo one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another,\u201d and here\u2019s the fucking deal: I may very well just be a brain in a box. I know that this existence I\u2019m experiencing is simulated, and that it\u2019s probably going to be short and mean and then I\u2019ll probably die. And I might not be able to help all of them, and there will still be kids out there that suffer and experience all the pain and sorrow the world shoves onto them. But fuck, I\u2019m still a soldier. I still have to try. It\u2019s fucking Christmas. [END LOG]",
        "Dr. Wilson, After meeting with the review board once again, we have decided that there are currently no means by which we can better contain SCP-3355. It is simply not cost effective for us to try and contain an entity that can so thoroughly outsmart even our most powerful systems, and attempting to do so would only be a waste of our resources. As per our other decisions on the matter, your current containment procedures will stand, and all containment efforts will be towards maintaining a front for SCP-3355 and further researching the anomaly. We look forward to our next review in two years time. Sincerely, Dir. J.
