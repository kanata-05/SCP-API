    "all_text": "rating:\u00a0\n+235\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5403\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nEuclid\n Neutralized (see Addendum 5403-4)\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5403 has been removed from all civilian databases. Foundation webcrawler ALPHA-03-TYCHO is to monitor web traffic for SCP-5403-relevant keywords.\n\n\nArchived Containment Procedures (last updated 09/12/1998):\n\nSCP-5403's IP address has been rendered inaccessible via standard internet providers, with any unauthorized access redirecting users to the default front page for its hosting service.\n\n\nEfforts to disable SCP-5403 entirely are ongoing. STF Chi-11 (\"Don't Like Don't Read\")\n1\n are to execute weekly DDoS attacks on the address, and continue to monitor its content and report any unusual fluctuations in activity. Communication with SCP-5403 is to be attempted when deemed necessary by Site-15 directors. If content posted on SCP-5403 is an information security risk, compromised researchers below Level 4 clearance are to be administered Class-A amnestics and transferred to another team. Under no circumstances should STF Chi-11 be disbanded.\n\n\nAfter review by the Ethics Committee, members of STF Chi-11 are permitted to request voluntary transfer after a minimum of two weeks.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5403 is a website accessible at the address www.g\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/MyFandationWorld. Attempts at tracing the website's IP address have yielded invalid results; evidence\n2\n suggests that an artificial intelligence or some other sapient, non-biological entity is responsible for the site's content.\n\n\nSCP-5403 has displayed the capacity to access comprehensive audiovisual surveillance of the Foundation through unknown means. The content of the site exclusively relates to observations derived from this surveillance. Despite the scope of SCP-5403's surveillance capabilities, it does not demonstrate awareness of its classification and containment by the Foundation.\n\n\nSCP-5403 is similar to a weblog in structure, including a \"guestbook\" where visitors can post public messages. These messages may be responded to by SCP-5403, deleted, or simply displayed without comment.\n\n\nThe posts made on SCP-5403 vary in content. The majority (approximately eighty-five percent) consist of commentary on current events relating to Foundation interests. SCP-5403 has not displayed the capacity to affect Foundation infrastructure directly, but it appears to have a vested interest in breaches of containment. Commentary posted on SCP-5403 is occasionally accompanied by photographic footage; metadata analysis shows that these photos do not originate from Foundation surveillance infrastructure.\n\n\nThe remainder of SCP-5403\u2019s content is highly derivative in nature, generally presented in the format of a narrative. These narratives often depict Foundation personnel engaging in \nexcessively dramatized\n and \nunprofessional\n behavior.\n\n\nAddendum 5403-1:\n Since the formation of STF Chi-11 (\"Don't Like Don't Read\"), SCP-5403 has fixated almost exclusively on its members. Due to the high stress levels reported by STF Chi-11 and other personnel made aware of SCP-5403's nature, the Ethics Committee has permitted staff referenced in its posts to record personal notes regarding their mention in this documentation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5403-2:\n The following is a log of excerpts from SCP-5403's posts, presented with commentary from the personnel discussed, if applicable.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Archived\u00a0data:\u00a0SCP-5403\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxX~Welcome To My FanDation~Xx\n\n\non 08/17/1998, 12:04\n\nHaiii~\n\nWelcome to my corner of the web! =(^.^)= I made this fanpage to talk about teh SCP foundation > and how cool it is!!!

How are you doing, Doctor?\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n \n[Brief pause.]\n How do you think?\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\n[Dr. Larask\u00eb sighs.]\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n I'm not going to lie to you. We're all pretty fucked up, Simon.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n I understand it's stressful, working with 5403.\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n Is that what they're calling it now? Stressful?\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n Look, I know from the outside it must look like the stupidest possible situation for researchers to be dropping out like flies, but\u2026 none of this shit is easy. None of us talk to each other anymore, but that doesn't make a damn difference to this thing. \n[Pause.]\n Nothing's sacred.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n Could you\u2026 elaborate on what you mean by that?\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n Found one of the junior provisional researchers crying at their workstation for the second time last night, after that thing about 2678. He'd seen the video, heard the logs, apparently. Used to be assigned to it. Poor kid nearly lost his lunch seeing it again. I told him to take the rest of the day off.\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n That's kind of you.\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n \n[Scoffs.]\n It's \nhumane\n, is what it is. That's how people are \nsupposed\n to treat other human beings. \n[Pause.]\n Can I smoke in here?\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n No. You seem to be very concerned about your team.\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n Shit. Well, we all found out A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's cheating on his wife the other night. 5403 posted all the juicy details. Like I said, nothing's sacred. We don't need to know all his personal shit, you know? Especially not written by a hyperactive\u2014\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n I'm asking about you, Doctor. How this is affecting \nyou\n. I know you care about your team, but\u2026\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n Like I said, Simon. How do you think? I'm at the epicenter of all this bullshit. I'm just keeping my head down, okay?\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n \n[Sighs.]\n You've been the head of Chi-11 for over a month now. You're well within your right to transfer out or take a break from the project if it's troubling you.\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n The thing is, I don't \nwant\n to. Everyone here is\u2014they've\u2026 they've been in the field at some point. Seen shit. Not that I haven't, but\u2026 I'm just straight out of MIT, holed up in Site-15 in my cushy little cubicle, you know?\n\n\nDr. Glass:\n Well, that isn't necessarily\u2014\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n So I can put up with this stupid website taking pictures of me, and ignoring what I have with Dr. Nyota so it can pretend I hook up with every man I work with. I can live with it, because it's even worse for the people who've actually \nbeen through\n the shit 5403 thinks is funny, or sexy, or \ncute\n, or whatever. If I'm not around to understand how this thing operates, and to give it someone to obsess over, then they'll have to get someone else to do it.\n\n\n[A chair scrapes audibly, and Dr. Larask\u00eb sighs.]\n\n\nDr. Larask\u00eb:\n And, Simon, this sucks. I'm not putting anyone else through this.\n\n\n<End Log, 14:21:19\u00a009/22/98>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Larask\u00eb has stated the intent to remain at her leadership position in STF Chi-11 indefinitely. Psychological evaluations should continue as planned.\n\n\n\n\nThe following post was uploaded to SCP-5403 shortly after the evaluation concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxX~HATECLUB~Xx\n\n\non 09/22/1998, 2:35\n\n\nUGHHHHH!!!!

        "Note - Commentary: So, Ethics said we can comment on these for \"catharsis\" or something. Said it'd help with the paranoia we're getting. Usually Dr. Larask\u00eb does this, but it seems like it's obsessed with me now, and she didn't want to comment on this one. I think it'd help more if we just didn't have to log these at all. Get a crawler to do it or something. - Researcher Harrison Denied. The information being dealt with here is too sensitive, and we're still in the preliminary stages of studying this anomaly.

        "Interviewed: Senior Researcher Ana\u00efs Larask\u00eb Interviewer: Head of Psychology Simon Glass <Begin Log, 14:15:28\u00a009/22/98> [Both are silent for approximately half a minute.] Dr. Glass: \u2026So\u2014 Dr. Larask\u00eb: I'm not bailing. Dr. Glass: I wasn't going to ask if you were \"bailing\". How are you doing, Doctor? Dr. Larask\u00eb: [Brief pause.] How do you think? [Silence.] [Dr. Larask\u00eb sighs.] Dr. Larask\u00eb: I'm not going to lie to you. We're all pretty fucked up, Simon. Dr. Glass: I understand it's stressful, working with 5403. Dr. Larask\u00eb: Is that what they're calling it now? Stressful? [Silence.] Dr. Larask\u00eb: Look, I know from the outside it must look like the stupidest possible situation for researchers to be dropping out like flies, but\u2026 none of this shit is easy. None of us talk to each other anymore, but that doesn't make a damn difference to this thing. [Pause.] Nothing's sacred. Dr. Glass: Could you\u2026 elaborate on what you mean by that? Dr. Larask\u00eb: Found one of the junior provisional researchers crying at their workstation for the second time last night, after that thing about 2678. He'd seen the video, heard the logs, apparently. Used to be assigned to it. Poor kid nearly lost his lunch seeing it again. I told him to take the rest of the day off. Dr. Glass: That's kind of you. Dr. Larask\u00eb: [Scoffs.] It's humane , is what it is. That's how people are supposed to treat other human beings. [Pause.] Can I smoke in here? Dr. Glass: No. You seem to be very concerned about your team. Dr. Larask\u00eb: Shit. Well, we all found out A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's cheating on his wife the other night. 5403 posted all the juicy details. Like I said, nothing's sacred. We don't need to know all his personal shit, you know? Especially not written by a hyperactive\u2014 Dr. Glass: I'm asking about you, Doctor. How this is affecting you . I know you care about your team, but\u2026 [Silence.] Dr. Larask\u00eb: Like I said, Simon. How do you think? I'm at the epicenter of all this bullshit. I'm just keeping my head down, okay? Dr. Glass: [Sighs.] You've been the head of Chi-11 for over a month now. You're well within your right to transfer out or take a break from the project if it's troubling you. Dr. Larask\u00eb: The thing is, I don't want to. Everyone here is\u2014they've\u2026 they've been in the field at some point. Seen shit. Not that I haven't, but\u2026 I'm just straight out of MIT, holed up in Site-15 in my cushy little cubicle, you know? Dr. Glass: Well, that isn't necessarily\u2014 Dr. Larask\u00eb: So I can put up with this stupid website taking pictures of me, and ignoring what I have with Dr. Nyota so it can pretend I hook up with every man I work with. I can live with it, because it's even worse for the people who've actually been through the shit 5403 thinks is funny, or sexy, or cute , or whatever. If I'm not around to understand how this thing operates, and to give it someone to obsess over, then they'll have to get someone else to do it. [A chair scrapes audibly, and Dr. Larask\u00eb sighs.] Dr. Larask\u00eb: And, Simon, this sucks. I'm not putting anyone else through this. <End Log, 14:21:19\u00a009/22/98> Closing Statement: Dr. Larask\u00eb has stated the intent to remain at her leadership position in STF Chi-11 indefinitely. Psychological evaluations should continue as planned.",
