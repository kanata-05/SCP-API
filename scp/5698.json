Foundation agents are to amnesticize all individuals who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the anomaly after it has demanifested. Pay records and bank accounts for affected individuals are to be artificially adjusted to conceal the effects of SCP-5698.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-5698 is the designation for a migrating multi-faceted pocket reality housing a consumer goods warehouse. The anomaly manifests as part of a pre-existing warehouse space, overwriting local baseline reality for the period of time the anomaly is present. Employees of the business being overwritten are folded into the manifestation, appearing as custodians and workers within SCP-5698. The manifestation can last anywhere from two days to a month. No known pattern has been discerned for SCP-5698\u2019s manifestations.\n\n\nIn these few instances where the property is abandoned, any individuals within one hundred meters of the manifestation at the time of its first appearance will be encoded as employees, regardless of their relationship with the property.\n\n\nIt is unclear what happens to the products stored within the business that is overwritten by SCP-5698. After a manifestation fades, the business returns to its normal appearance and the affected individuals are left with faint memories of their time as employees of the warehouse.\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscovery\n:\n\nSCP-5698 was discovered on 31 March, 2014, when an abandoned warehouse in Creekside, Ohio\n.\nPopulation is under five thousand individuals according to the 2010 United States Census.\n was taken over by the anomaly. The property was less than thirty meters from the building that housed the local courthouse and Creekside City Hall. All individuals working within this building were encoded into the rewriting of baseline reality to be employees of SCP-5698. Mayor Maria Hoffman took on the role of shipping and receiving manager, and the Honorable Judge Jacob Fischer became the general manager of the property.\n\n\nOn 2 April, 2014 police were called to the City Hall building as it was apparently abandoned and the reporting individual claimed the disappearance of the thirty-three county and city employees were due to \u201cthem damned Al-Qaeda hooligans.\u201d Creekside PD were called to the property housing SCP-5698 when Judge Fischer was observed in a short-sleeve button up shirt and wrinkled, grease-stained tie entering the building around 13:00 with a bag of fast food.\n\n\nIndividuals interviewed by Creekside PD were unaware that they had ever worked anywhere but SCP-5698.\n\n\nEmbedded Foundation agents within the Ohio State Police received reports of this phenomenon and informed Site-43, which launched an investigation upon learning the specifics. Police and witnesses were amnesticized.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5698-1\n\n\n\u2013 Record of Additional SCP-5698 Manifestations \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThurber, Texas\n\n\nPlayas, New Mexico\n\n\nNewry, South Carolina\n\n\nMadrid, New Mexico\n\n\nElcor, Minnesota\n\n\nNuma, Iowa\n\n\nTerlingua, Texas\n\n\nKohler, Wisconsin\n.\nAs more manifestations are discovered, they will be added to this file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5698-2\n\n\n\u2013 Recorded Interactions with Affected Individuals \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Interview\u00a05698-A\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Maria\u00a0Hoffman\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n \u2013 2 April, 2014\n\n\nInterviewer\n \u2013 \nResearcher Wettle\n\n\nInterview Subject\n \u2013 \nFormer Mayor Maria Hoffman\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5698 Shipping and Receiving Manager, Maria Hoffman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWettle\n: Someone told me you were the manager, that true?\n\n\nHoffman\n: I\u2019m the shipping-and-receiving manager. What\u2019s it to you, pal?\n\n\n[Wettle makes a throat-clearing sound.]\n\n\nWettle\n: I\u2019ve been sent by the County to discuss your permits to operate such a building, and to inspect the premises. Are you going to be a problem, Hoffman?\n\n\nHoffman\n: No, just I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d want to hear from me?\n\n\nWettle\n: Answers!\n\n\nHoffman\n: You haven\u2019t asked me any questions yet.\n\n\nWettle\n: Good, you\u2019re paying attention. Okay so, what sort of business is this?\n\n\nHoffman\n: We\u2019re the main distribution arm of the company. So, we store products made by the company and make sure they get to the store shelves.\n\n\nWettle\n: Alright, how long have you worked in this building?\n\n\nHoffman\n: Six years.\n\n\nWettle\n: Ever thought about running for political office?\n\n\nHoffman\n: Why would I do that when I have such a good job right here?\n\n\nWettle\n: What \nis\n your job, exactly?\n\n\nHoffman\n: I manage the shipping and receiving for the company from this location.\n\n\nWettle\n: Right, right. Still no chance you\u2019d run for office?\n\n\nHoffman\n: What is this?\n\n\nWettle\n: You don\u2019t remember running for Mayor eighteen months ago and winning?\n\n\nHoffman\n: No! That\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019ve been here this whole time.\n\n\nWettle\n: And \nhere\n, being this warehouse.\n\n\nHoffman\n: Yes, where else?\n\n\nWettle\n: What\u2019s so great about working here?\n\n\nHoffman\n: I work fifty hours a week, not a bit more.

Turn down the pithy energy, please.\n\n\nFischer\n: Well, friend, you\u2019re not the most pleasant person I\u2019ve talked to in a while. You said you worked for the County?\n\n\nWettle\n: I did. Okay, so how long have you worked in this warehouse?\n\n\nFischer\n: Twenty years.\n\n\nWettle\n: Did you go to college before that?\n\n\nFischer\n: God, no.\n\n\nWettle\n: So, you didn\u2019t graduate from law school twenty-eight years ago?\n\n\nFischer\n: \n[laughs]\n If I went to law school, you think I\u2019d work as a manager in a warehouse? Even one as nice as this?\n\n\nWettle\n: Alright, forget I asked. \n[muttering]\n Ridiculous.\n\n\nFischer\n: Yeah, I\u2019m lucky I got this job when I did. Right before I got this job, I was working at the tire factory, the whole town did. But it shut down, company moved it overseas. And suddenly, everyone in town is lucky to get unemployment benefits. After a while, people were moving away just to get dishwasher jobs. If the company hadn\u2019t opened up this warehouse, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be homeless or worse.\n\n\nWettle\n: So, you usually keep your employees working overtime?\n\n\nFischer\n: What\u2019s needed is what\u2019s done, that\u2019s the way it is with us. Besides, don\u2019t force no one to stay late.\n\n\nWettle\n: But it\u2019s not like they\u2019re making all that much, so why would they if they didn\u2019t have to?\n\n\nFischer\n: The company pays competitively, don\u2019t be like that. They\u2019re certainly making more than if they didn\u2019t have these jobs, right?\n\n\nWettle\n: You at least pay the federally mandated overtime amount?\n\n\nFischer\n: No one is working overtime, technically.\n\n\nWettle\n: What? Hoffman said she works fifty hours a week!\n\n\nFischer\n: Sure, and she does. But everyone\u2019s salary here. We work until the job is done.\n\n\n[Researcher Wettle makes a sound typically considered to be one of disgust.]\n\n\nFischer\n: You got a problem, buddy?\n\n\nWettle\n: You got a funny attitude towards your employees\u2019 benefits.\n\n\nFischer\n: Oh, they don\u2019t get benefits.

For example, individuals universally have more aggressive tones in their interactions with others and exhibit rough, even unprofessional language no matter what their background. Although they only retain partial, incomplete memories of their time as employees at SCP-5698, the experience often has a protracted effect on the subject\u2019s priorities.\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Creekside\u00a0City\u00a0Council\u00a0Records\u00a003/05/2014\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreekside City Council Meeting\n\n\nIndividuals involved\n: \nCouncilpersons Markam, Valencia, Gerber and Mayor Hoffman\n\n\nDate\n: 3 May, 2014\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[Excerpt begins with meeting already in session.]\n\n\nMarkam\n: I\u2019m sorry, Mayor, I don\u2019t think I understand?\n\n\nHoffman\n: Jesus, Jill, it\u2019s freaking obvious.\n\n\n[All three City Council members share significant looks but don\u2019t say anything.]\n\n\nHoffman\n: If these companies aren\u2019t going to make sure that their employees have medical and other benefits, I think we should open up a city-run clinic and food bank!
