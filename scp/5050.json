Site-449 will take jurisdiction over containment of SCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A. The SCP-5050 signals are to be monitored at all times; any errant changes should be reported to the lead researcher immediately.\n\n\nSCP-5050-A is to be monitored indirectly. Civilians are to be instructed to stay away from the location of SCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A and the road leading to them will be barricaded. Intruders are to be amnesticized. No overtly anachronistic technology is to be introduced to SCP-5050-A; incoming television and radio signals are to be monitored to this effect.\n\n\nThe Foundation database is to be checked bi-weekly for any unauthorized SCP-5050 behavior.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio propagation signals from SCP-5050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5050 is a large radio tower in the Bavarian Alps on the Austrian/German border, specifically the Mittenwald municipality in Germany and the Innsbruck-Land district of Austria. SCP-5050 constantly emits signals ranging from 2\u00a0kHz/kilohertz to 279\u00a0GHz/gigahertz\n1\n over a large area, although the maximum effective range is estimated to be within a 1,374 meter radius of SCP-5050. The frequency range produced by SCP-5050 is so extreme as to be considered anomalous by the disruption of applied physics.\n\n\nSCP-5050 also broadcasts television and audio signals as well as radio signals. These broadcasts can be occasionally intercepted by the Foundation; because the process requires a significant amount of time, the broadcasts usually do not last long enough to be fully intercepted. These media appear to be somewhat procedurally-generated.\n\n\nThe signal from SCP-5050 primarily affects the surrounding town of Drachen-Domane (designated SCP-5050-A). SCP-5050-A appears to be consisted of a mix of technology from the 1960s to the 1980s; the level of technological advancement in SCP-5050-A seems to be slowed. Its inhabitants appear to be affected easily by the signals, but no direct testing has been available to support this conclusion. Neither SCP-5050 nor SCP-5050-A have any historical construction records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram of a 21kHz frequency from SCP-5050. As of 08/1990, this has been the only decipherable frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem History:\n\n\nSCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A were discovered in 1987, when SCP-5050's high-frequency signals are picked up and triangulated by Foundation satellites. Further surveillance of SCP-5050-A was approved and aerial reconnaissance was carried out. During the reconnaissance, the signals from SCP-5050 interfered with the control system of a Foundation plane and severely damaged it in the process. Due to the inability to get in close proximity to SCP-5050, a ground task force has been assigned to initiate first contact with SCP-5050-A (See Addendum 01.1 - Contact Proposal).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation plane destroyed during aerial surveillance.

The first thing we saw wasn't exactly what we - or I - expected. On the side of the road, there's a sign that every self-respecting small town has, you know, \"Welcome to Plainsville\" or that sort of stuff. This one just said 'Drachen-Domane' but that's not the important part. Underneath that was this sort of Foundation logo. Stunned us there. It makes no sense cause we're the contact team; there shouldn't be any trace of us here at all. I had Audrey make a mockup of the sign using some of the stuff we have.\n\n\n\n\nInteresting start of the day. Got into the main area of Drachen; it's quaint overall. Reminds me of the days as a young girl roaming around the outskirts of town. Almost antique, if someone plucked it right out of the 70s. Roamed around for a while; people around are cautious but friendly. Understandable. Asked about the history of the town and the tower. Foundation too. Most people couldn't give us an awfully straight answer. Figures they wouldn't know much.\n\n\nStrangest part is the welcome sign. We asked around, but no one's actually ever seen the sign. You'd think at least one person in town would know. Does that mean no one ever leaves? Possible. We're staying at the Righiera Hotel in Drachen. Two rooms, connected by an adjacent door. Thankfully (or unusually) everyone here speaks English, not German. Turns out \"Drachen-Domane\" means \"Dragon's Domain\" in English. About right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 03, 2019:\n Saw the logo again. Middle of the tunnel, embossed straight into the wall. Made out of some sort of red acrylic or tile. No spaces in between the logo and the surrounding concrete. Didn't make it too far examining it before a young boy, dressed in what looked like a WW1 doughboy outfit, told us that the insignia is the town crest. Town crest. Makes sense given its prevalence but still: it's just our logo with a tower in it. I guess \"just\" is an understatement considering the preservation of the veil and all. It's also a crime to tamper with the 'town crest' according to that darned kid. Said he'd notify the Brigade. Law enforcement of the town, they run more like Military Police than any standard district. Derek paid him off with some sweets. Shouldn't have to look over our shoulders for a little while.\n\n\nDomane today. Same aesthetic as Drachen. We received some nice pictures today from some of the townfolk. They heard we were in town (it's a tiny place, I bet you could hear a pin drop at the other edge of the town) and dug into their library's archives. Visited the place ourselves, but all the books are very old and musty. Nothing new that I could spot. Found a town map, though. Had Audrey do some of her special work again for us. Took a nice pic, too.\n\n\n\n\nCalled it quits earlier than usual today. Mild headaches, nothing too severe, but annoying enough to hinder good work. Everyone in the team's got them, I think. As for me, I have this ringing in my ears - in the back, like if someone had a triangle clanging around in there. Lazenby's current diagnosis is tinnitus. Don't believe it for a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 04, 2019:\n God, my head is killing me. Feels like that one time I downed about a dozen tequila shots at that Foundation Christmas party last year. I can tell everyone's feeling it, too. Lazenby's trying his best but it's sort of clear he can't think really straight either. His left eye's been killing him. Day three and we're already out-of-action. Some top Foundation team we are.\n\n\nWatched TV. Not much on besides reruns of the original Twilight Zone. Watched \"A Thing About Machines\" and \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit.\" Great stuff, probably one of the best shows out there. Caught a broadcast directed to us. Not sure what to make of it.\n\n\nWe all eventually figured a bit later that we can't just sit around all day doing nothing, especially after that broadcast. Headed to the clinic doctor, Hubbard, to see if he knows anything that Lazenby doesn't. He chalked it up to 'pressure difference' in altitudes messing with us and that it was nothing to worry about. The probability of that being true is about the same as shooting the edge of a coin at 500 meters away. Even Lazenby argued with Hubbard for a while on the diagnosis. Guess it wasn't worth it to him to fight because he stopped after a while. Paid our dues and went back to the streets.\n\n\nWent wandering about Drachen-Domane. I don't know \nwhy\n we just went walking, but it was just a feeling that I had. It was almost like a trance. Snapped out of it when Lazenby shouted and ran off somewhere. Caught up to him, and he had one of the Brigade members by the collar. Relatively young man with chestnut hair. The soldier, a Captain Marek, explained that he was following us for our safety. Okay, sure. Told him to leave us alone, but Lazenby nearly tore his throat out. Hippocratic oath my ass. Pulled him off. Went back to the hotel after. Wrote most of what we learnt on a hotel notepad.\n\n\nLots of things to unpack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRough map of Drachen-Domane by Sampi-3.\n\n<Hover to Enlarge>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brigade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA townsperson gives a speech unequivocally praising SCP-5050 to fellow townspeople.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISUAL LOG\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5050 Broadcast: MAY 03. 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0:00]\n - \n[0:02]\n > Standard 120hz test tone.\n\n\n[0:02]\n - \n[0:08]\n > SCP-5050 generated jingle, aka 'opening'.\n\n\n[0:08]\n - \n[0:24]\n > \n\"It is my decree that our new visitors should be treated with respect and kindness and not mauled, maimed, disfigured, or killed in any way possible.

The Brigade's been giving us a little trouble - especially with the people following us around. Not quite sure who exactly's calling the shots there.\n\n\n[JMSN]\n: As in?\n\n\n[SNCR]\n: Well, as we had it explained to us, there's a rough chain-of-command in place. There's the Brigade Leader, but he takes orders from the Viceroy. The executive sector - the Viceroy's domain - also has the tower talkers too. They all listen to it and act as its servants, supposedly. Overall the Tower's in charge there. I've been trying to figure out to what extent the autonomy in Drachen-Domane is.\n\n\n[JMSN]\n: The images are quite telling. Almost looks like a personality cult worshiping the tower.\n\n\n[SNCR]\n: That's about right.\n\n\n[JMSN]\n: We also managed to capture that broadcast, too. Background was a visual feedback loop.

I\u2019m an adjutant for the Brigade here.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: The Brigade?\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: The Brigade. It serves a military and police function within our town. I\u2019ll give you a proper tour of the town later, but for now if you\u2019d gather your things and follow me.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: Follow you where?\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Military headquarters, sir. We have your room completely furnished.\n\n\n[NEAME]\n: \nOur\n room?\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: How- how did you know we were coming?\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: The Viceroy let us know in advance. He instructed the Brigade Leader to make sure that you were all comfortably accompanied.\n\n\n<The camera pans over to Roland.

Only seven minutes about, it\u2019s that building there, in the distance.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: Exquisite looking.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Indeed. Top of the line, sir. We run almost everything through there.\n\n\n<Marek turns and looks at Neame for several seconds.>\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Is there a problem, ma\u2019am?\n\n\n[NEAME]\n: Nothing necessarily, I was just thinkin\u2019 that you don\u2019t really look like a Captain.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: It- well- it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to say, ma\u2019am, but this isn\u2019t my uniform. Technically I\u2019ve been relieved of more pressing duties that requires the uniform so I can wear whatever I feel like.\n\n\n[NEAME]\n: Aye, they really rolled out the red carpet for us.

The military HQ appears to be a mostly complex maze of hallways and rooms. Soldiers are walking throughout the building. Neame and Roland follow Marek.>\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Splendid, isn\u2019t it? Military Headquarters. You could get tangled up in this building all day.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: Quite so, I\u2019d say.\n\n\n<A soldier passes by Marek, but stops to talk to the group.>\n\n\n[SOLDIER]\n: Captain Marek!\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Yes, what is it, Ralf?\n\n\n[SOLDIER RALF]\n: The Brigade Leader wants to talk about the weekly Sunday debriefs after you\u2019ve finished putting these two in their room.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: I see, thank you.\n\n\n<The soldier departs.>\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Well then, sorry for keeping you here.

It\u2019s much better than the hotel.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: Indeed. We\u2019re not troubling you by staying here? We can book a room at the Righiera.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: You\u2019re not causing any trouble, sir. Besides, the Righiera hasn\u2019t been in any working capacity for- oh, several months, I\u2019d say.\n\n\n[ROLAND]\n: Hrm. Well, alright. I don\u2019t want to keep you here.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: I apologize for not being able to take you on the tour right now, but I\u2019ll come collect for you later.\n\n\n[NEAME]\n: Good day.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: Good day. Oh, and one more thing, ma\u2019am- I please ask that you do not take the video camera with you into town.\n\n\n[NEAME]\n: Why so? It defeats the purpose somewhat, since we\u2019re a news team after all.\n\n\n[MAREK]\n: I understand, but some of the townspeople can get very belligerent over such things.

We can use their information without having to capitulate to them.\n\n\nR: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best decision for us to do that.

I agree with you that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\nR: Everything in moderation.\n\n\nN: The town has a unique aesthetic; one of those things you have to see to believe.\n\n\nR: Errant mix of the 1960s through the 1980s. Seems to have a different technological evolution than we do.\n\n\nN: So\u2026 Stanley Kubrick?\n\n\n<They laugh.>\n\n\nN: Anyways, I\u2019m more concerned about the Viceroy than our insider friend.

Some of the things we asked about:\n\n\n\n\nTown Crest \u2013 Nothing new regarding this. No one seems to know its origin.\n\n\nVon Gernreich \u2013 Literally nobody\u2019s seen this person or heard their name in their life. Go figure.\n\n\nRighiera \u2013 \u201cShut down\u201d following an incident several months ago. Owner disappeared suddenly after. The incident\u2019s most likely the Sampi-3 team\u2019s ambush.\n\n\nThe Viceroy \u2013 All the responses we got were enigmatic to say the least. Everyone had speculations on what he looked like. Seems like the only people who\u2019ve seen him are the Tower Speakers. Lives in Capis Cai \u2013 the executive manor in Domane. That\u2019s all we could factually get.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, not entirely a useful week.

What is your first question?\n\n\nNeame\n: First question?\n\n\nZoref\n: I give all visitors a set amount of questions. That way they won't waste my time.\n\n\nNeame\n: How many questions?\n\n\nZoref\n: Now, telling you would defeat the purpose of the\u2026 experiment.

Next?\n\n\nRoland\n: Do you take orders from anyone higher?\n\n\nZoref\n: Depends on what you mean about higher. I get orders from the Viceroy - and sometimes the Tower Speakers. Still under the Viceroy either way. Everything else judicial falls under my purview.\n\n\nNeame\n: Trial system?\n\n\nZoref\n: None standard. Usually summary judgement. Firing squad's the standard, but sometimes the Tower will provide punishment more divine than we do.\n\n\nRoland\n: I see. Feelings on outsiders?\n\n\nZoref\n: Rare, but we treat them equally as any townsperson. Last question.\n\n\n<A pause.>\n\n\nRoland\n: Brigade Leader, what do you know about the National Scientific Anthropological Society?\n\n\nZoref\n: W- that's strictly confidential. You outsiders have no right to know.\n\n\nNeame\n: Answer the bloody question, Brigade Leader.\n\n\n<Zoref slams his hands on the table.>\n\n\nZoref\n: There is nothing to answer!\n\n\nNeame\n: You said you'd treat outsiders the same as townspeople, Brigade Leader. What is so valuable to you that you're trying to hide it?\n\n\nZoref\n: Nothing at all. I'm simply just trying to do my job: secure, contain, and protect.\n\n\nNeame\n: What?\n\n\nRoland\n: What did you say?\n\n\nZoref\n: Secure, contain, protect. It's the first provision decreed by the Tower.\n\n\n<Zoref rubs his left eye and sits down.>\n\n\nZoref\n: I'm sorry, but there's nothing that I personally know that you most likely already have cataloged somewhere. I'll have Captain Marek escort you out.\n\n\n<The phone on Zoref's desk rings.>\n\n\nZoref\n: Let me just answer this. Hello, this is the Brigade Leader.\n\n\n<A pause.>\n\n\nZoref\n: Oh, I see. I understand. They'll be dealt with accordingly.\n\n\n<Zoref places the phone down.>\n\n\nZoref\n: I've been informed that you have been snooping around at night.

Zoref's hiding \nsomething\n.\n\n\nR: A good question is if it extends past Sampi-3 and their disappearance.\n\n\nN: I personally don't think so.

You must be Kit Neame. And you are Augustus Roland.\n\nRoland\n: That's right. You're a tower speaker, huh? Given you knew about the Viceroy, it fits.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Correct, Mr. Roland.\n\n\nNeame\n: You- aren't you-\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Erich Lazenby, Ms. Neame?\n\n\nNeame\n: You are! You're not dead! Why haven't you contacted the Foundation?\n\n\nRoland\n: It seems like a better move to have contacted the Site instead of us, given your technology.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Let me explain. I may have been Erich Lazenby at one point; but I am no longer that person. This is not quite what is happening, but I am living in the shell of Erich Lazenby. I am Kontakteen.\n\n\nRoland\n: Interesting, the phonetic mispronunciation.\n\n\nNeame\n: Of what?\n\n\nRoland\n: Contact team. Kontakteen. Can't you hear it?\n\n\nNeame\n: You're right, holy shit.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: I promised information - what do you wish for?\n\n\nNeame\n: When was Drachen-Domane founded?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: April 26th, 1964. It's a very important date in this town, beyond what you probably understand.\n\n\nRoland\n: How did you become one of the Tower Speakers? What is your purpose?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: How I became, I don't know. I just\u2026 was, one day. My purpose: I simply spread the message of the Tower.\n\n\nRoland\n: Fitting, I guess.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: This painting behind me. It is a beautiful painting, is it not?\n\n\nNeame\n: That's Goya, right?\n\n\nRoland\n: Saturn Devouring His Children.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Indeed. One of Francisco Goya's black paintings, painted directly on the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823. It's almost like you could walk directly through it into another world.\n\n\nRoland\n: You're knowledgeable about that.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: One of my passions, Mr. Roland. There are a lot more Goyas in the wine cellar.\n\n\nNeame\n: What does Project ROOK have to do with Capis Cai and this town?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: That one you will understand soon enough. I cannot answer that question.\n\n\nRoland\n: What about the Foundation?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: The Foundation\u2026 founds. Is it not amazingly simple?\n\n\nRoland\n: So they founded this town?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: It is up to you to decide how you want to interpret my statements, Mr. Roland.\n\n\nRoland\n: I see.\n\n\nNeame\n: Why so enigmatic now, Kontakteen? You were mostly straight forward with us then, why not now?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: The layers are only there to protect you, Mrs. Neame. Did Julius Ceasar listen to the Soothsayer? Maybe he couldn't understand dates!\n\n\n<Kontakteen laughs.>\n\n\nNeame\n: Oh. Okay.\n\n\nRoland\n: What is the Tower?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: The Tower? It is three looking for one, drunk on knowledge and wishing to take from the waters of Eden.\n\n\nRoland\n: Got it, thank you.\n\n\nNeame\n: What happens if you don't listen to the Tower?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Questioning the voice of the Tower is a missed step that it will forcefully rectify.\n\n\nNeame\n: Wait! That means\u2026 Kontakteen, did Von Gernre-\n\n\nKontakteen\n: Halt, stop!\n\n\nNeame\n: W- what is it?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: I thank you for visiting Capis Cai and heeding the warnings of the Tower.\n\n\nNeame\n: Huh?\n\n\nKontakteen\n: If you would like me to answer the rest of your questions, I will be available tonight. I will lead you to the exit.\n\n\nRoland\n (whispering): Just go with it.\n\n\nRoland\n : Thank you for your time. We can find our own way out.\n\n\nKontakteen\n: I understand. Good bye.\n\n\nNeame\n: Seeya.\n\n\nRoland\n: Goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n[END INTERVIEW]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG:\n AUG 17. 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufeffR: Err, 10:26 PM. Alright, we're going out to seek all the answers we can before getting the hell out of here. Break out of here, get the van, get Kontakteen, and scram. Leaving this on for posterity. It should automatically send.\n\n\nR (whispering): Kit, ready?\n\n\nN (whispering): Ready.\n\n\nN: And you're the reason why we're going to lose our jobs!\n\n\nN: It's not my fault you're such a shitty cameraman that you can't even keep a barn in focus!\n\n\nN: Oh yeah? I'm trying to keep the people from seeing your ugly-ass mug on national television, you fucking goblin!\n\n\n<A knocking is heard.>\n\n\nGuard: Hey, keep it down, you dissidents.\n\n\nN (whispering): Can I do it?\n\n\nR (whispering): Go for it.\n\n\nN: Oh? Make us, you cowbrained shitface. Pretending to be so stoic and all, you're probably-\n\n\n<The door can be heard being thrown open.>\n\n\nGuard: I warned you, you-\n\n\n<A loud shout and a scuffle can be heard, before a grunt and a body hitting the ground.>\n\n\nR: Hold it!\n\n\nGuard 2: Fine.\n\n\nR: Pass the handgun over.\n\n\n<The sound of a hard impact and another body hitting the ground.>\n\n\nR: Catch.\n\n\n<The slide of a handgun is racked.>\n\n\nN: Good, let's go.\n\n\n<15 minutes of noise removed.>\n\n\nZoref: They've escaped. Get the Brigade. They probably went to Capis Cai.\n\n\n<A partial gunshot is heard. The signal cuts out.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending this for good forewarning. Kontakteen's dead. Someone else got to him first, gutted him and strung him up like a fish. He left a note for us, telling us that he told us all the clues we need. We've pretty much deciphered everything. But I'll explain.\n\n\nGot to the wine cellar. Another Goya painting was there, Asmodeus. So we took what he said about stepping into the portrait and did that. Tiny crevice in the wall, but there was a door - a metal door. Locked by keycode, five numbers. That was the harder part. Tried 26564 and a bunch of combinations of April 26th 1964. Roland remembered his weird dig about Julius Caesar, then it clicked. Julian day. Using that, we got 35812. Worked like a charm.\n\n\nIt leads to this long, deep tunnel. We think this is the Project ROOK facility - or we hope so. Wish us luck, and a little bit of faith. We'll send anything we find before we book it the hell out of here.\n\n\nSee you all someday,\n\n\n\n\n- Kit Neame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Recovered\u00a0SCP-5050\u00a0Documents\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Project\u00a0ROOK\u00a0Documents\u00a0\u00ab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA door leading into SCP-5050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35mm Prints of the Project ROOK facility (1964).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA room in the Project ROOK facility (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation from Project ROOK Facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Logs from Project ROOK Facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Director VON GERNREICH \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're fools, goddamn fools. They ask for my assistance and then when I try to provide it to them they turn me down. I cannot finish my work otherwise! And they understand that too, but they are too afraid to let it become complete. I ask to install the matrix over and over. Always no. I tried to blackmail them by saying I would go to the Committee. They told me that 'dead men don't get opinions'. Bloated idiots, only caring about politics and the plum-pudding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Brigadier LANSDALE \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabarr warned me today that some of the personnel are getting really riled up. Violent outbursts, other things. I still slightly resent him for dragging me into his pet project. Those Foundation people aren't any better. After all, it's because of them this shit is happening. Crappy memorandums being posted up everywhere in my office. Pushing their agenda. So I've decided to take advantage of certain\u2026 mishaps they're making. Called up my scientist in their rank. Things should get juicy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Data Technician S. ZOREF \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalked to Cheryl down in records to see if the should let me take copies of the project data. She said yes, but warned me that the guards report anyone taking files over a certain size to the Viceroy. That would ruin our plan awfully quick. Of course for safety purposes, she doesn't know the size limit.\n\n\nRecruited anyone new? Maybe Jarre? I'm not entirely sure how he feels about the project. I'll come pick up your response in a day or two. Talk face-to-face when we can. Sandra out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Programmer NELDON \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI see. Looks like we'll have to smuggle this stuff out in small bits. Maybe even mix it in with other things, too. Didn't recruit anyone new yer. I considered Jarre, but he's been doing some suspicious-looking stuff around ANDANI recently. I don't fully trust him yet. Besides, there's a demo going on soon between the Brigade Leader and the Viceroy. Apparently the director's not even allowed to go, so it must be something pretty damn important. Let me know any updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Director VON GERNREICH \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my last straw. Those cretins had a meeting without me regarding ANDANI. I created it; they dare not include me in such matters? I've had enough of this. I'm going to use myself as a basis for a personality matrix. If I get mine in before they do, I will be the one holding the cards. After all, it's not like they would try to install a personality matrix after mine considering the consequences. The machine could go critical, disrupting its function and even possibly break due to the mixed matrices. That's not something they want - for sure. I will have my power back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Viceroy FABARR \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's absolutely wonderful! The Brigadier had one of his technicians install a custom personality matrix behind the silly Foundation's back. The new voice of warfare as we know it, and hand-delivered right into our hands! Listen to it!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nHowever, it may be incomplete. The technician told me there are limits installed in the matrix to keep it from breaking itself. Of course, I asked if these could be removed at a later time. He told me it would take a while, so we will wait to dissolve the partnership before we do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Director VON GERNREICH \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy brain is racked and addled with pain. I don't exactly feel all present, currently, but that was to be expected. Using my brain as a template weakened me to the tower's effects. My left eye burns. I go before the O5 council today to force them to listen to me. They will\u2026 they must. They wouldn't dare terminate me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Data Technician S. ZOREF \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director hasn't been in for a while. They may have reassigned him to another more pertinent project: we don't have a lot of time. I think we've got to move, and fast. Cheryl's authorized you to access the datatapes. Let me know when you take them. I can try a distraction - by removing ethic and other limits on ANDANI as well as temporarily inputting the Foundation database into its personality matrix, it should go haywire and hold everyone up enough so we can leave and get the Ethics Committee to shut this down. Sandra out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Programmer NELDON \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra - I've got the datatapes of the masters. It's not everything, but it's enough to take it to the Committee and get them to take us seriously about this. We have to do it quick, before they notice at the end of the day that the tapes are gone. Do that distraction of yours and let's scram. I'm outside in a car. Let's hope the brigade doesn't get us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2502 Technician DAVISON \u2502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething's gone terribly wrong with ANDANI. It's everywhere, spewing things left and right. It's\u2026 sentient? Crazy. Crazy and sentient. Trapped us in here. I think it's trying to vent the air out and kill us. Some of the guards were yelling about going after some of the technicians who escaped. Hopefully they'll do us justice.\n\n\nI don't know how things got so bad. Last I heard, not only had ANDANI's limits been removed, they found traces of four different personality matrixes in it. Three of them are separate from each other - but the last one. It's an amalgamation of all the others; and it's developing wildly, like a cancer. It's completely out of control.

What was once a mystery spiraling out of control was reined back in and will be a prominent case-file for the Foundation going forwards.\n\nBoth Task Force Sampi-3 and Sampi-4 were instrumental in discovering the origin of SCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A, and will be honored with a plaque at Site-449. The O5 Council has issued a statement at large apologizing for the Council's behavior in 1964. They have promised to be as transparent as possible to prevent such an incident from happening again. The Council and the US. Government signed a proviso disallowing such agreements in interests of war.\n\n\nAlthough the fate of Sampi-4 is unknown, the SCP-5050 signal's range and strength have diminished in the recent weeks. The documentation will be updated to reflect the new information. We expect no foreseeable problem with SCP-5050 nor SCP-5050-A; both will be put under continued indirect surveillance.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recent decipherable spectrogram of a signal from SCP-5050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE:\u00a0(1)\u00a0NEW\u00a0ADDENDUM.\u00a0VIEW?\n\n\n\n\nHIDE\u00a0TEXT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 04:\n DtCw7B7ZWemqwaJwJuLxHqM3qIVNSwT0ixCWeYGP3EUs4XT0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n[DID YOU KNOW THAT CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT?]\n\n\u25ba n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n[Addendum added to document.
