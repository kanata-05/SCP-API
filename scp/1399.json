If the page is observed to change in any way, notify the Site Administrator.\n\n\nAdditionally, an adjacent room, henceforth designated as the observation room, is to be set up with a television and radio set to switch between several news channels on an eight hour cycle.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1399 is a thin fifteen page children\u2019s book titled \u201cAnother Way of Hearing.\u201d The cover depicts the earth, with the title above it. There is no author indicated on the cover. SCP-1399\u2019s ISBN correlates to no assigned ISBN, and its labeled publisher, Detiskia Books, corresponds to no recognized publishing company.\n\n\nWhen read sequentially, one page at a time in its entirety, it consists of a variety of disconnected visual images that have strongly associated auditory connections, along with the words \u201cAnother Way of Hearing [Image]\u201d. Page three, for instance, is an image of a train, below which are the words \u201cAnother Way of Hearing Trains.\u201d Save for the last page, all images and text have remained static while in Foundation hands.\n\n\nThe anomalous effect of the book occurs once the last page is turned and the book is closed. Immediately, the reader ceases to be able to receive any auditory stimuli from the world around them. Instead, their eardrums will resonate in concert to what has been determined as the auditory stimuli of a variety of alternate worlds. That is, their hearing will be transposed to another reality. This phenomena extends only to hearing, with sight, touch, taste, smell, and less conventional senses apparently unaffected.\n\n\nIt has been determined that the particular alternate universe to which the book attunes its reader is dependent on the last page, which changes periodically. All readers who experience the effect between changes have been determined to be hearing the same world. A list of recorded historical diversions and related images can be found in Document-1399B.\n\n\nThe last page so far has appeared to change at the same time as a variety of major world-altering events occur. The book seems to re-attune people\u2019s hearing to a world where that event occurred differently, usually in a catastrophically negative way.\n\n\nThis phenomenon has been noted to create considerable distress among D-class personnel due to disorientation from a difference in auditory and visual stimuli. For this reason it is advised to provide any affected personnel with a pair of high-quality earplugs to assist with concentration during interviews and in the interest of preserving their sanity. D-class personnel subjected to the effects of SCP-1399 are exempt from monthly terminations until all possible acoustic mapping of the particular alternate reality has been completed.\n\n\nDocument-1399A\n\n\n\n\nPage Change Procedure\n\nIf at any time, the last page of SCP-1399 is observed to change, three D-class personnel are to be recruited on a voluntary basis; due to their subsequent removal from monthly terminations, volunteers have proved relatively easy to find. To prevent complications, personnel are to be briefed of the effects of SCP-1399 before exposure.\n\nOnce subjected to SCP-1399, the first D-class is to be escorted to the previously established observation room. The D-class is to be provided with a writing utensil and paper for them to record all possibly relevant information pertaining to the divergence. After eight hours, conduct a written interview and rotate in the second D-class. Continue process every eight hours until all possible information has been collected.\n\n\n\n\nDocument-1399B\n\n\n\n\nAn abridged record of the observed forms of the last page of SCP-1399 and its apparent correlating world event divergence.\n\n\nMarch 12, 2011:\n Page changes.\n\n\n\n\nNew page:\n [An image of waves breaking on a sandy beach] Caption: \u201cAnother Way of Hearing Waves\".\n\n\nAssociated world event:\n 9.0 magnitude earthquake in Japan.\n\n\nEstablished Diversion:\n The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant fails to stabilize, and a core meltdown occurs.
