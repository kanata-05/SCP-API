A removable safety net is to be mounted one meter from SCP-4903. Two digital clocks are to be in plain view of the chamber's security camera: one clock is to be positioned within SCP-4903-1 and the other is to be positioned within the containment chamber. Requests by SCP-4903-2 are to be sent to the Ethics Committee for approval. A bonesaw and standard first aid kit is to be positioned on the wall directly adjacent to SCP-4903.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-4903 is a cable loop measuring twelve meters in length and five centimeters in diameter, comprised of seven individual cords. Currently, the metallurgical makeup of four of the cords have been identified as iron, gold, lead, and cobalt. The remaining cords are fashioned from an unknown dark material with an Albedo rating of 0.02, an unknown reflective material with an Albedo rating of 0.98, and an unknown material which demonstrates complete transparency. Each cord has a word inscribed upon it.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Inscriptions\u00a0and\u00a0corresponding\u00a0cords.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition\n\n\nInscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\nCold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\nEternal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLead\n\n\nContain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobalt\n\n\nPersist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnknown dark material\n\n\nLive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnknown reflective material\n\n\nStay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnknown transparent material\n\n\nFade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area enclosed by SCP-4903 functions as a three-dimensional gateway between local reality\n\nand a pocket dimension, designated SCP-4903-1. The only physical structure native to SCP-4903-1 is a featureless white plane of indeterminate size. SCP-4903-1 is prone to temporal distortion events occurring approximately every three to twelve days. These events increase the passage of time within the anomaly by a significant multiplicative factor\n1\n from the perspective of those outside. These distortions have been observed as lasting anywhere between seven minutes to thirteen days standard time in duration. SCP-4903-1 possesses an abnormally high Hume level of 385 and an ambient temperature of 4.4 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nSCP-4903's manifestation within SCP-4903-1 is inert to all forces acting upon it from inside SCP-4903-1. Any movement of SCP-4903 causes its manifestation within SCP-4903-1 to mimic the horizontal motion introduced. Vertical motion of SCP-4903 has no effect on SCP-4903's manifestation. Sapient beings are unable to exit SCP-4903-1 through SCP-4903's manifestation.\n2\n\n\nSCP-4903-2 is the designation assigned to the former D-41312 following exploration of and subsequent inability to leave SCP-4903-1. SCP-4903-2 has demonstrated immunity to all attempted methods of termination\n3\n through a combination of rapid regeneration and a complete immunity to anomalous kill agents. SCP-4903-2 is generally amicable to Foundation personnel, although caution is necessary for interactions immediately following a temporal distortion event.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4903-A\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0requests\u00a0by\u00a0SCP-4903-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blindfold.\n\n\nApproved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter clothing.\n\n\nApproved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA digital watch.\n\n\nApproved.

Let's get him out first.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4903-2 is successfully removed from SCP-4903-1 via a rope harness pulled by Researcher Elmsway, Agent Xing, and Agent Goodwater.

SCP-4903-2 notably does not experience any of the typical disorientation inherent with such a procedure.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n Figured I'd leave you with some nonsense to make sense of.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n \n(Laughs)\n. Welcome to the other side.\n\n\n\n\nApproximately six seconds after SCP-4903-2 was revived, an anomalous force was exerted on SCP-4903-2, pulling the subject directly towards SCP-4903 at speeds exceeding 1645kph. SCP-4903-2 was pulled through twelve walls, breaching containment of \nSCP-2586\n and \nSCP-080\n. By its own account, the resulting impacts injured SCP-4903-2 severely but did not lead to loss of consciousness.\n9\n\n\n\n\nThe events following SCP-4903-2's return to SCP-4903-1 were captured by the containment cell security camera. The impact of SCP-4903-2 with the containment chamber walls caused loss of video feed for twelve seconds and loss of sound for twenty minutes. Restoration of video feed revealed SCP-4903-2 appearing to yell and assault SCP-4903 until sector lockdown was announced. Researcher Elmsway was able to enter SCP-4903's containment chamber immediately before the lockdown. SCP-4903-2 became visibly less agitated when Researcher Elmsway entered the room. Researcher Elmsway recounted his conversation with SCP-4903-2 for the purposes of this document.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n That should have worked. That was the fucking loophole. Who designs something like this and then adds a specific stipulation to close the only goddamn way out? I beat it fair and square.\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n Don't lose hope. Every anomaly has a fundamental weakness, or this world would have been destroyed a long time ago.\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n Looks like you missed an effect or two.\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n Or two?\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n Figure of speech. But riddle me this. What makes you think that you know every property of this purgatory? What if it turns into Disneyland if exposed to the right frequency of radiation? What if it releases a pantheon of hostile gods if you cut the cords? The only truth I've learned in here is that I understand nothing of the anomalous, and I think it laughable that anybody believes they can.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n We can't anticipate everything. Perhaps every conversation has the chance to complete a foul ritual and bring about the end times. Or perhaps we can act on the assumption that everything, no matter how strange it appears to us now, has some logical explanation that can be eventually discovered through the scientific process. I would prefer to believe the second.\n\n\nSCP-4903-2\n I didn't believe \nthis\n would happen to me. Tell me one thing. Did that change my fate?\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n No. But if optimism is what keeps me going so I can free you eventually, then so be it.\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n How long have I been in here from your perspective?\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n Twenty-one years, five months, and eleven days.\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n Don't give up and forget about me.\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n Trust me on this. I am not going to forget you.\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n And trust \nme\n on this. This is a well-founded fear. I do not blame you. But the fact remains that even if you manage to remember me for the rest of your life, even if the Foundation remembers me by some miracle until it falls, eventually I will be abandoned here. By any means necessary, and I do include anomalous means in that, do not let me fade into this hell forever.\n\n\nResearcher Elmsway:\n I will remember you, but I will not break Foundation regulation by using unapproved anomalous means to do so. My first duty is to the Foundation, not to any individual.\n10\n\n\nSCP-4903-2:\n Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports by Agent Xing and Agent Goodwater confirm that Researcher Elmsway was seated adjacent to SCP-4903 upon conclusion of the lockdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a09/9/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4903-D\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Regarding\u00a0reclassification\u00a0to\u00a0Thaumiel\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRE: Reclassification of SCP-4903\n\n\nThe rationale for SCP-4903 being utilized in containment procedures for Keter-class SCPs largely boils down to two arguments\u2026\n\n\n\n\n1.\n SCP-4903-2 has been unable to escape the confines of SCP-4903-1 for over 44 years on our end and a virtual eternity on its end.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n SCP-4903 may be placed within a containment chamber and simply be used as an additional layer of security for high-risk SCPs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither of these points accounts properly for the fact that we cannot say with certainty that SCP-4903-1 is inescapable.

        "RE: Reclassification of SCP-4903 The rationale for SCP-4903 being utilized in containment procedures for Keter-class SCPs largely boils down to two arguments\u2026 1. SCP-4903-2 has been unable to escape the confines of SCP-4903-1 for over 44 years on our end and a virtual eternity on its end. 2. SCP-4903 may be placed within a containment chamber and simply be used as an additional layer of security for high-risk SCPs. Neither of these points accounts properly for the fact that we cannot say with certainty that SCP-4903-1 is inescapable. Disregarding the time dilation, the greatest feat we have seen of SCP-4903-1 is containment of a single human. Allowing any entity defined by an ability to escape confinement entry into SCP-4903-1 would be an inherent gamble. Additionally, anything that manages to escape SCP-4903-1 would become an obscenely powerful reality bender as a result of Hume field diffusion.
