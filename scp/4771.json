SCP-4771 has displayed a predictable behavior set under extensive testing. As SCP-4771 was instrumental in preserving the safety of numerous Foundation personnel, as of 11/14/2021, MTF Members and Foundation Personnel with level 2 or above clearance may apply to use SCP-4771\n1\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4771 is an anomalous dog whistle. SCP-4771 does not produce any sound in any frequency spectrum, unlike its non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n\nSCP-4771's anomalous effects may manifest when it is blown by a former owner (henceforth referred to as subject) of a deceased pet canid.\n\n\nShould the subject's life come under threat at any point in time after SCP-4771 was used, a temporary, selectively hostile, volitional Class-VIII incorporeal entity in the form of the subject's deceased pet (referred to as SCP-4771-B) will appear to render aid to the subject. In 98% of subjects, this effect will occur only once.\n\n\nSCP-4771's anomalous effects will manifest with greater probability if the subject meets one or more of these criteria:\n\n\n\n\nSubject acquired SCP-4771-B as a puppy when said subject was a child/adolescent\n\n\nSubject adopted SCP-4771-B from a kill shelter\n\n\nSubject grew up with SCP-4771-B\n\n\nSubject has treated SCP-4771-B with respect and love during its lifetime\n\n\nSubject has spent a lot of time engaging in play activities with SCP-4771-B\n\n\nSubject was present at SCP-4771-B's death\n\n\nSubject held, caressed, or otherwise maintained physical contact with SCP-4771-B as it expired\n\n\nSubject interred SCP-4771-B's remains on the grounds of their place of residence\n\n\nSubject remembers habits, quirks, or other strong memories regarding SCP-4771-B\n\n\nSubject frequently talks about SCP-4771-B\n\n\nSubject has pictures or other forms of visual media depicting SCP-4771-B on display\n\n\n\n\nThe degree to which an SCP-4771-B instance can exert influence over the physical world is affected by the conditions listed above in blue. As a general rule, the more the subject in question partakes in activities listed in blue, the greater the effect a corresponding SCP-4771-B instance can exert.\n\n\nAnalysis of high fidelity recording of sounds produced by all SCP-4771-B instances shows that according to the Foundation\u2019s current understanding of auditory cognitohazards, all sounds produced by SCP-4771-B instances should be \nfatal\n to all human beings. Research on why this is not the case is currently ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Manifestation\u00a0Event\u00a03:\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Subject:\n Captain Jose Ortega, Leader of MTF Gamma-6 (Deep Feeders).\n\n\nPhysical Description of SCP-4771-B:\n Female Labradoodle, deceased at age 12.\n\n\nNotable Qualities:\n Subject suffered from depression, alcoholism, and drug use after the death of his parents in a car accident when he was 15. Subject spent several months homeless before encountering SCP-4771-B on the streets. Subject frequently credited SCP-4771-B with helping him overcome his substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\n\nBackground:\n On 2/4/2022, MTF Gamma-6 is sent to re-establish containment for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The mission was a failure with an extreme casualty rate. Out of 22 MTF members, only 3 agents (including the subject) survived. Subject suffers from extreme PTSD and survivor\u2019s guilt afterward. Foundation mandated mental health treatments see little success in improving subject\u2019s condition.\n\n\nEvent Description:\n On 8/2/2022, Subject attempts suicide using Foundation-issue .44 caliber revolver. According to testimony from the subject, as he placed the barrel of the firearm against his temple, cocked the hammer, and clenched his eyes shut, he felt a \u2018warm and fluffy mass\u2019 settling on his lap. Subject opened his eyes to see a barely visible shimmering apparition of SCP-4771-B sitting on his legs. SCP-4771-B remained with the subject for approximately 5 more minutes, during which time it nudged the gun away from the subject. SCP-4771-B instance licked the subject on the face a moment before dematerializing.\n\n\nEpilogue:\n Subject makes a call to Foundation mental healthcare services to report his suicide attempt and the aforementioned anomalous activity. Foundation therapists place subject under watch while providing him with additional care. Subject\u2019s PTSD symptoms vastly improve over the next few months. A DNA swab of the saliva sample taken from the subject\u2019s face reveals a 98.2% match with a dog of a Labradoodle breed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Manifestation\u00a0Event\u00a014:\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Subject:\n Assistant Researcher Patricia O\u2019Leary.\n\n\nPhysical Description of SCP-4771-B:\n Male German Shepherd, deceased at age 15.\n\n\nNotable Qualities:\n Subject grew up in an impoverished neighborhood with a high rate of violent crime. Subject noted several incidents where SCP-4771-B protected her from assailants during its lifetime. SCP-4771-B was described as always being alert for anything that may harm its owner.\n\n\nBackground:\n On 9/21/2022, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake occurs 12 miles away from Site 114. Structural damage sustained to Site 114 results in three instances of \nSCP-3199\n breaching containment.\n\n\nEvent Description:\n Dr. O\u2019Leary is seen running towards the stairwell to escape the Keter Containment Wing. A shriek is heard as an instance of SCP-3199 emerges from an adjacent corridor, cutting off Dr. O\u2019Leary from her escape route. As she turns around to double back, another SCP-3199 instance emerges around the corner, trapping Dr. O\u2019Leary.\n\nSuddenly, the first SCP-3199 instance is flung to the floor by an unseen force. 3199 instance shrieks and struggles to get back up without success. Aggressive growling and barking can be heard ringing throughout the site. Other SCP-3199 instance hesitates and runs in the opposite direction. Deep bite marks appear on the pinned SCP-3199 instance, severing vital tendons and major arteries. Dr. O\u2019Leary escapes through the stairwell. SCP-3199 instance expires from injuries sustained from SCP-4771-B.\n\n\nEpilogue:\n Forensic investigation done on the SCP-3199 cadaver reveals the bite marks match the profile of an adult domestic dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Manifestation\u00a0Event\u00a037:\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Subject:\n Corporal Sangchul Kim, Field Medic Assigned to MTF Beta-7 (Maz Hatters).\n\n\nPhysical Description of SCP-4771-B:\n Female Golden Retriever, deceased at age 18.\n\n\nNotable Qualities:\n Subject grew up as a first-generation immigrant in the rural United States. Due to routing issues, school buses dropped off subject half a mile away from his place of residence. On the application for SCP-4771 use, subject noted that SCP-4771-B would always be present at the drop off location to greet and walk the subject back to his house.\n\n\nBackground:\n MTF Beta-7 is sent to secure a modified strain of \nSCP-008\n from Chaos Insurgency Agents. The said strain had been augmented anomalously, drastically decreasing the time needed between exposure and onset of symptoms from three hours to several minutes. As a last-ditch effort, Chaos Insurgency agents expose MTF Beta-7 members to the modified SCP-008 samples. Corporal Kim was tending to a wounded MTF member (Private Jerry Steele) whose air filter was compromised by shrapnel during the operation. Before Pvt. Steele could be infected, Corporal Kim quickly removed his mask and applied it to his patient.\n\n\nEvent Description:\n The events of this incident were compiled through the body camera footage of Corporal Kim and Private Steele. Footage shows Corporal Kim sewing up and sealing a wound on Pvt. Steele\u2019s torso. The radio crackles to life and Captain Myers\n2\n informs the task force of an incoming gas attack. Corporal Kim hesitates for a second before ripping off his mask and applying it to Pvt. Steele\u2019s face. Moments after, an orange haze enters the camera\u2019s field of view, saturating the area with modified SCP-008 particles in a matter of few seconds.\n\n\nUpon contact with the modified SCP-008 particles, Corporal Kim\u2019s face convulses. He is seen stumbling away from Pvt. Steele before falling and leaning against a pile of rubble. The subject is seen coughing violently while orally ejecting copious amounts of blood and chunks of liquefied lung tissue. Subject begins to audibly groan in pain and writhe as he begins to bleed profusely from every single orifice. Over the next minute, severe tissue necrosis begins to affect the subject\u2019s exposed skin. Subject looks at Pvt. Steele and weakly issues orders to put as much distance between both of them.\n\n\nSuddenly, subject looks directly in front of him and reaches out with his arm. Camera footage from both individuals captured no third entity. Expressions of pain vanish on the subject's face and are replaced with a weak smile. Subject starts to caress and rub SCP-4771-B instance. Subject\u2019s breathing becomes less erratic, and convulsions begin to stop. Subject is heard whispering \u2018there\u2019s my good girl\u2019. Biometric sensors report fatally low blood pressure and heart rate during this time. Subject is heard asking SCP-4771-B \u2018come to take me home?\u2019 before expiring.\n\n\nEpilogue:\n After the battle ended, Corporal Kim was found deceased in the area of operation next to an unconscious, but alive Pvt. Steele. An autopsy reveals that while Corporal Kim had not suffered any head trauma and bloodstream was saturated with modified SCP-008 particles, the prion\u2019s anomalous reanimating effects did not take place.\n\n\nA lock of yellow fur was found on Corporal Kim\u2019s vest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
