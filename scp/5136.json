Two security staff equipped with radiation suits are to accompany SCP-5136 on this excursion, which is not to last longer than 90 minutes.\n\n\nFurther psychological & emotional evaluations are now to be completed on a weekly basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Special\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0Addendum,\u00a007/14/2020.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Special\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0Addendum,\u00a007/14/2020.\n\n\n\n\nUpon recommendation from Lead Researcher Hern\u00e1ndez, SCP-5136 is now primarily contained by the successful implementation of Project Inanna (see below). This has mitigated the worst effects of SCP-5136\u2019s recent emotional deterioration, and almost completely eliminated any involuntary radioactive emissions.\n\n\nAlthough Project Inanna represents a significant drain on Site-93 resources, its costs are still significantly lower than those projected for the sophisticated shielding and pacification that containment of SCP-5136 would otherwise require.\n\n\nResearch into SCP-5136\u2019s emergent telepathic connection is tentatively approved, but care must be taken when discussing sensitive topics, including Maria Fischer, Elizabeth Garc\u00eda, romantic love, depression, loneliness, and heartbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5136 is the designation given to Benjamin Speers, formerly of Lincoln, Nebraska. SCP-5136 constantly emits low-intensity ionizing radiation: a 1-minute exposure to SCP-5136 delivers, on average, a 1.2 \u03bcSv dose\n2\n. However, in situations of extreme stress \u2013 especially when SCP-5136 feels its life is threatened \u2013 this emission intensifies exponentially to fatal levels, with no known upper limit.\n\n\nSCP-5136 is generally compliant & nonviolent. Despite its plainly stated dissatisfaction with containment, SCP-5136 has never intentionally used its radioactive emissions to harm personnel or facilitate its own escape. Experimentation to determine SCP-5136\u2019s degree of control over this radiation is indefinitely suspended.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Description\u00a0Addendum,\u00a005/02/2020.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Description\u00a0Addendum,\u00a005/02/2020.\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in April 2020, SCP-5136 displayed intensifying symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation, likely due to prolonged isolation. Private counseling\n3\n with Lead Researcher Hern\u00e1ndez failed to meaningfully alter SCP-5136\u2019s mental & emotional state. Coupled with SCP-5136\u2019s apparent inability to control its radioactive emissions, this agitation presented significant risk to both Foundation personnel and feasible long-term containment.\n\n\nSCP-5136\u2019s containment procedures were revised to allow for limited time outdoors each day with a security escort, which considerably improved both SCP-5136\u2019s mood and its control over its radioactive emissions.\n\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that SCP-5136\u2019s increased volatility is somehow linked to its mental state, as its \u201cradiation incontinence\u201d followed shortly after its recent mental breakdown, despite 18 months of stability in prior containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Description\u00a0Addendum,\u00a007/14/2020.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Description\u00a0Addendum,\u00a007/14/2020.\n\n\n\n\nOn July 7, 2020, SCP-5136 began involuntarily emitting near-fatal levels of radiation with no apparent physical or emotional trigger. At the same time, SCP-5136 claimed to have suddenly become aware of Ms. Maria Fischer of Eau Claire, Wisconsin\n4\n, despite having never met or heard of her before, and expressed an intense need to \u201cmake things better\u201d for her.\n\n\nQuestioning led by Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez determined that SCP-5136 possessed significant awareness regarding Ms. Fischer\u2019s current emotional state and her history of romantic partners\n5\n. A recent period of prolonged loneliness had significantly worsened Ms. Fischer\u2019s mental health, which SCP-5136 claimed to be feeling as well.\n\n\nGiven the severity of Maria Fischer\u2019s depression and SCP-5136\u2019s associated distress, taking her into Foundation custody was deemed too great of a risk to both SCP-5136\u2019s agitation and any intensification of its radioactive effect. Ms. Fischer\u2019s water supply was laced with mood stabilizing compounds as a stopgap measure, as containment staff worked to increase radioactive shielding on SCP-5136\u2019s enclosure and devise a more long-term solution.\n\n\nAfter prolonged discussions, and with the noted objections of the Ethics Committee, Project Inanna was initiated. A viable subject was identified in Elizabeth Garc\u00eda, a coworker and acquaintance, who according to colleagues had tentatively flirted with Ms. Fischer on one occasion to no apparent reciprocation.\n\n\nRoughly two weeks after the successful launch of Project Inanna on 07/20/2020, SCP-5136\u2019s radioactive emissions dropped rapidly to near-baseline levels. Continued execution of Project Inanna was deemed necessary until a more permanent solution or explanation for SCP-5136\u2019s volatility could be devised.\n\n\nDue to the roughly 2-week delay between Ms. Fischer\u2019s emotional changes and SCP-5136\u2019s spike in radioactive emissions \u2013 and their observed exponential growth after that point \u2013 any changes to Ms. Fischer\u2019s emotional state must be resolved immediately via Project Inanna, without waiting to measure their effects on SCP-5136\u2019s radioactivity.\n\n\nUpgrade to Keter designation has been suspended, pending ongoing research into Project Inanna\u2019s long-term viability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Inanna:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Overview.\u00a0Access\u00a0Restricted\u00a0to\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Personnel.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ARCHIVED:\u00a0Overview.\u00a0Access\u00a0Restricted\u00a0to\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Personnel.\n\n\n\n\nProject Inanna is the ongoing Foundation initiative to covertly maintain the romantic relationship between Maria Fischer and Elizabeth Garc\u00eda, both of Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n\nProject Inanna\u2019s current volatility status is: \nCRITICAL\n.\n\n\nThe bulk of Project Inanna focuses on surveillance of communications between Fischer and Garc\u00eda, with any direct interference disguised as random chance. As the majority of this interference occurs on the cell phones, personal computers, and office equipment of Ms. Fischer & Ms. Garc\u00eda, physical interference is only to be deployed with great care and only as a last resort.\n\n\nProject Inanna Proposal Log\n\n\n\n\nProposal 0001\n\n\nDate:\n 2020-07-10\n\n\nBrief:\n Manipulation of social media algorithms to promote interest between Fischer and Garc\u00eda.\n\n\nStatus:\n Approved\n\n\nResults:\n Inconclusive.

A newly-implemented script rerouted her call and recorded her voice message, unbeknownst to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\n\n\nHi, Raul, It\u2019s Elizabeth.\n\n\nI know we haven\u2019t talked since April and I\u2019m really, really sorry it\u2019s so late, or early, right now, I guess. I\u2019ve been up all night, I\u2019m just thinking and, and I wanted your input, I mean, I know you\u2019re a psychologist. How much do you know about mental illnesses? Like if somebody had one. How would you know, that kind of thing. Like, what are the symptoms.\n\n\nLast time we talked, I told you about Maria. Well we\u2019re dating and it was nice for awhile but then it just felt, um, not right. I wasn\u2019t feeling it. And I thought it was just me overthinking and self-sabotaging like every other time, because we still had fun together, right, and God knows I'm good at ruining a good thing but it all felt a little\u2026perfect? Too good to be true?\n\n\nParanoia, right? I know \u201cparanoid schizophrenia\u201d, maybe that\u2019s it. I think it can\u2019t be that, but then I think \nhow\n, how can the universe just, like, \ngive\n me what I want like this? I know you told me to just be myself, be patient, it'll all work out. But I look back and the coincidences, they just feel too convenient, too perfect.\n\n\nYesterday was Valentine\u2019s Day and we didn\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t remember doing anything. Except I know we \ndid\n, we were \nsomewhere\n, because I\u2019m wearing my favorite dress right now. The one Maria got me for our 6-month. She said it was a steal. Like the universe just\u2013\u2013\n\n\nOh God.\n\n\nLike the universe just wanted me to have it.\n\n\nValentine\u2019s Day. Right. I don\u2019t remember it, I don\u2019t remember anything. It\u2019s all a blur, I feel like we went out but my brain is just this \nfog\n recently, I go to text her and there are messages I don\u2019t remember sending, messages I can\u2019t find that I\u2019m \ncertain\n I sent. I look at her and I\u2026I just want to hit her. But I can\u2019t remember any reason I\u2019d want to. And I feel so shitty right now, but it\u2019s like my body is constantly energized, giddy, like it usually feels after we\u2026\n\n\nBipolar disorder, I know that one. Maybe it\u2019s that. Or maybe paranoia.\n\n\nOr maybe I just watch too much TV.\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t okay. Calling you like this, it was a weird thing to do. I\u2019m sorry if I woke you. It\u2019s probably nothing.\n\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with the recording, Researcher Hern\u00e1ndez resigned his position with the Foundation and submitted himself willingly for interrogation and amnestic treatment. Project Inanna has been suspended indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log,\u00a0SCP-5136.\u00a0Project\u00a0Inanna\u00a0Decommission\u00a0Followup.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log,\u00a0SCP-5136.\u00a0Project\u00a0Inanna\u00a0Decommission\u00a0Followup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2021-02-16\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5136\n6\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ivanova, Interim Lead Researcher, SCP-5136\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n Good evening, Ben. I have a few follow-up questions from our earlier discussion, if you feel up to it.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Of course, Doctor. I\u2019m sorry again for causing this whole mess.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n Right now, your candor is more important than your guilt.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Of course. I won\u2019t lie again.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n I\u2019m glad to hear it. \n(pause)\n Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez claims that you faked your way through the \u201cempathic link\u201d tests on Maria Fischer with his help and a few subtle in-the-moment cues. An impressive piece of theatre.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Well, he trained me for it extensively.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n The private counseling.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Right. \n(pause)\n That\u2019s not gonna ruin it, is it? For any other, um, skips? That might actually need the counseling?\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n This process is about more than punishing Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. This is about making sure it can\u2019t happen again. I can\u2019t make any promises about how we\u2019ll use your answers, but I know that won\u2019t stop you from being honest about something so important.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n How\u2013 how can you be sure of that?\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n If you were willing to actually hurt people to make yourself more comfortable, you would\u2019ve gone nuclear the day we brought you in.\n\n\nSilence. Dr. Ivanova makes several notes.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n To be clear: you had no knowledge of either Elizabeth Garc\u00eda or Maria Fischer, prior to this scheme with Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez?\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Right. Though from his descriptions, I feel like I know Elizabeth pretty well now. She sounds nice. \n(pause)\n He cares a lot about her. That first planning session \u2013 where he proposed the whole plan, promised I'd get to see grass again \u2013 he'd talked to her the previous night. Comforting her for hours. He was so sad for her, so desperate to just help out even a little bit. I think he figured it'd only take a firm nudge.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n He overestimated his ability to keep the project low-profile.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Right, yeah.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n You\u2019ll be happy to hear that Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez corroborated your story. Insisted the entire scheme was his idea. Even your faked agitation and the \u201cnature walks\u201d cure.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Yes, that's right. Well, mostly. I really \nwas\n having a bad time of it.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n But no involuntary radiation?\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Right. That was his idea. Pretend I couldn\u2019t control it if I was in a bad place, mentally. He told me that you all \u2014 um, that The Foundation sometimes needs to be given a reason to be kind.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n Did he.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n I believed him, didn't I?\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n Those are all the follow-up questions I have for now. Thank you for your time, Ben.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Um, Doctor? Before you go\u2026I know I\u2019m in trouble right now, but considering my, uh, compliance\u2026I mean, Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez talked about how nasty some of the other things you contain are, and I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d ever\u2026I'm just, um\u2026\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n I'll see what we can do about your walks. I can't promise anything.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Um, thanks.\n\n\nDr. Ivanova:\n Have a good evening, Ben.\n\n\nSCP-5136:\n Thanks, Doctor.
