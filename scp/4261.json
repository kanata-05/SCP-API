It is under MEGIDDO precautions at all times. Per the terms of Foundation-HI JOA 2-63, three members of the Sons of Shammai and three Foundation employees of verified Abrahamic faith are to be on standby in an adjacent room at all times as preparation for possible use of SCP-4261.\n\n\nIf any of the following circumstances occur, SCP-4261 will be redesignated Thaumiel and is then authorized to be blown seven (7) times by an Abrahamic faithful, at the discretion of the Site Director:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0LEVEL\u00a05\u00a0AUTHORIZATION\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nLOGIN\u00a0AUTHORIZED\u00a0&\u00a0RECORDED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf at any point notification of \nCODE NIGHTMARE REGENT RED\n along with the appropriate codephrases are received;\n\n\nThere is incontrovertible evidence that threat entity \nCODENAME: Scarlet King\n is fully manifested in our universe and no appropriate countermeasures are or will be available to neutralize the threat entity;\n\n\nObjective verification from project coordinators that \nProject Palisade\n has failed at-large and multiversal reality failure is imminent;\n\n\nAny other verified K-class scenario in which the Foundation has objective evidence that \nmultiversal reality failure is imminent\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder no other circumstances is SCP-4261 to be blown. Attempts to utilize SCP-4261 apart from outlined circumstances will result in immediate termination. Additionally, if unauthorized personnel attempting to utilize SCP-4261 are verifiably linked to a GOI, that GOI will be declared an enemy of the Foundation without exception and its personnel will be treated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a001-05-2018\n\n\n\n\nTHANK\u00a0YOU\u00a0FOR\u00a0YOUR\u00a0ATTENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the events of 12-20-2017 and subsequent dissolution of Vatican-Foundation JOA 729, any members of GOI-182 (\n\"la Spada di Cristo\"\n) who are apprehended within 20km of Site-77 are to be taken offsite immediately for coercive interrogation followed by final processing. Under no circumstances are they to be processed onsite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4261 is a \nshofar\n, a type of trumpet traditionally made of ram\u2019s horn and used in ancient Israelite religious ceremonies. Though the material is identical in composition to ram\u2019s horn, it possesses physical properties and tensile strength far in advance of actual ram\u2019s horn, with removed samples shown to have energy dispersal properties sufficient to withstand an output equivalent to a 3.0 Megaton nuclear device. It should therefore be noted that in the event of Site-77\u2019s failsafe nuclear device activating, retrieval of this item is of the highest priority as it will most likely have withstood the blast.\n\n\nSCP-4261 also has a property that activates when it is blown. The sound waves it generates modify local reality, leading to oftentimes drastic changes in Hume levels. Additionally, as the reality-altering effects of sound waves correspond to the power of the sound waves themselves, they are subject to traditional wave interference principles - if the horn is blown more than once in quick succession, the sound waves will amplify and destroy each other at points of constructive or destructive interference, respectively. This will result in corresponding amplification of reality changes, with unpredictable results. For unclear reasons, amplified sound waves will propagate to roughly sevenfold their expected radius of effect based on standard acoustics principles, with corresponding reality changes. It is unknown what will occur if SCP-4261 is blown seven times in quick succession, but available documentation indicates that it may trigger a unique effect that would potentially be detrimental to Foundation interests (see Documentation for more information). As such, testing is currently contraindicated.\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-4261 has a final property that is unclearly related to its reality-altering ability. Namely, exactly 77 seconds after it is blown, all verified adherents of Abrahamic faith who hear the sound will instantaneously dematerialize. Notably, computer-rendered audio of the sound will also trigger the effect. Additionally, all corpses within earshot of the sound will immediately, regardless of their state of decomposition, begin to rapidly move upward at a vector directly perpendicular to the ground. Foundation satellites have documented a top speed of 0.1c prior to the objects exiting the upper atmosphere, after which they spontaneously dematerialize - no barrier to date has been able to stop or slow subjects' acceleration.\n\n\nPrior Documentation:\n\n\n\n\nNote: Assumptions Regarding SCP-4261\n\n\nThere are still many unknowns surrounding SCP-4261. For instance, it is unclear what documentation is referring to SCP-4261 or what further documentation will be uncovered in future searches - as such, we have taken broad liberties in including elements that may or may not be related, and this selection of documentation is neither exhaustive nor finalized. Based on the below documentation and others housed in Site-77 (for further information, please contact the Office of Strategic & Tactical Theology), we make the following assumptions regarding SCP-4261:\n\n\n\n\nThe use of SCP-4261 seven (7) times in quick succession will trigger an XK-Class scenario (\nhigh likelihood, high confidence\n);\n\n\nThe use of SCP-4261 seven (7) times in quick succession will additionally trigger a mass dematerialization of all adherents of Abrahamic ideology globally, not just those who are within range of the sound waves (\nhigh likelihood, low confidence\n);\n\n\nThose who dematerialize in response to SCP-4261 usage are being transported to an extradimensional location (\nmedium likelihood, medium confidence\n);\n\n\nThere is a coordinating force causing the dematerialization of SCP-4261 subjects that is capable of triggering an XK-Class scenario under the right circumstances (\nhigh likelihood, medium confidence\n);\n\n\nThis coordinating force is dematerializing SCP-4261 subjects for a benevolent purpose (\nlikelihood unable to assess, low confidence\n).\n\n\n\n\nSigned:\n\n\nIsmail al-Atassi, Analyst, Office of Strategic & Tactical Theology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParchment\u00a0Fragment/Recovered\u00a0from\u00a0Dig\u00a0Site-128/c.1200-1000\u00a0BCE\n\n\n\n\nRETURN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGYAROS\n UNDER (SIEGE/WAR/FLAME) IF (FALLS/LOST/CONSUMED) SEND WORD TO (SONS OF NOACH) LAST CHANCE SOUND THE (HORN/MUSIC) THEY FALL WITH US BURN THE (FLESH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u00a0Corinthians\u00a015:52/Translation\u00a0recovered\u00a0from\u00a0Dig\u00a0Site-54/c.350\u00a0CE\n\n\n\n\nRETURN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a rega (moment), in the wink of an eye, at the last shofar blast.

The pattern of their initial incursion and movements matched predictive models for an attempted theft of SCP-4261 to within 96.54%, triggering immediate onsite mobilization of Automated Response Force (ARF) Sigma-9 (\"Unthinking Servants\"). The incursion was successfully halted and repelled before the hostiles could breach SCP-4261, with 17 hostile casualties, 3 prisoners taken, four ARF UGVs decommissioned, and a total of eight Foundation casualties. The prisoners were interrogated immediately following the encounter - logs follow. Due to unclear capabilities of the intruders, interrogations were conducted remotely in a thaumaturgically warded chamber by interrogator Winfield via videoscreen.\n\n\n\n\nOPEN\u00a0INTERROGATION\u00a0LOG\u00a0-\u00a0Prisoner\u00a01\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0INTERROGATION\u00a0LOG\u00a0-\u00a0Prisoner\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEGIN LOG\n\n\nWinfield: State your name for the record, please.\n\n\nPrisoner: You've made a terrible mistake - you can still rectify it.

Why not let our Lord judge us? Let him take those he finds worthy - help me and you will be among that number, free of all pain.\n\n\nWinfield: State your name for the record, please.\n\n\nPrisoner: So be it then.\n\n\nThe prisoner angrily begins to chant in Latin.\n\n\nWinfield: I'm sorry, is that your first or last name?\n\n\nThe prisoner's voice raises in intensity, and one of the interrogation room's walls is replaced by a void. Approximately three seconds later, smoke begins to pour out of the void and forms into the shape of three Class III ontokinetic entities. Protective seals trigger on the walls and one of the entities vaporizes - it appears to have only a temporary stunning effect on the other two.\n\n\nWinfield: WE NEED BACKUP IN HERE, NOW!\n\n\nThe entities quickly break down the door. Security personnel arrive and, over the next several minutes, engage the entities in combat - several Foundation casualties occur before reinforcements arrive with spelleater rounds and successfully neutralize the entities. The prisoner is found dead in the room after the engagement.\n\n\nPost-Interrogation Assessment: Cause of death was cyanide poisoning - autopsy noted a shattered cyanide capsule buried in a false tooth. Presumably, the prisoner wanted to try a diplomatic approach first.

With a quick jerking motion, he snaps the left wrist cleanly, exposing bone - a bright flash fills the room, and the prisoner continues to scream as wounds appear on his hands and feet and he begins to bleed profusely from every orifice. Within twenty seconds, the prisoner has fully exsanguinated and promptly expires.\n\n\nPost-Interrogation Assessment: The prisoner's left radius was inscribed with a sigil designed to trigger upon exposure to air and blood simultaneously - a rather sophisticated fallback method if one no longer has access to a cyanide capsule.\n\n\nRecommendations: It remains unclear what capabilities these agents have, and what other fallback methods are available to prevent them falling into the wrong hands.

Despite consistently disavowing both the existence of and actions committed by GOI-182 (\n\"la Spada di Cristo\"\n), they have refused to share information or render known \nSpada\n agents over to Foundation custody. Our intelligence indicates clear financial and operation links between \nSpada\n and the Vatican - under the terms of Vatican-Foundation JOA 729, they are therefore considered under the umbrella and jurisdiction of the Vatican and are not to be interfered with by the Foundation. Due to the VOSP's unacceptable lack of cooperation, we are officially invoking the Dissolution Clause of JOA 729 - as such, any and all Vatican-affiliated GOIs that the VOSP disavows are no longer subject to diplomatic immunity and are to be treated as independent GOIs.

The prisoner grabs their left wrist with their right, without ceasing his screaming. With a quick jerking motion, he snaps the left wrist cleanly, exposing bone - a bright flash fills the room, and the prisoner continues to scream as wounds appear on his hands and feet and he begins to bleed profusely from every orifice. Within twenty seconds, the prisoner has fully exsanguinated and promptly expires. Post-Interrogation Assessment: The prisoner's left radius was inscribed with a sigil designed to trigger upon exposure to air and blood simultaneously - a rather sophisticated fallback method if one no longer has access to a cyanide capsule. Recommendations: It remains unclear what capabilities these agents have, and what other fallback methods are available to prevent them falling into the wrong hands.

        "BEGIN LOG Winfield: State your name for the record, please. Prisoner: WHERE AM I Winfield: State your name for the record, please. Then we can begin to answer some of your questions. Prisoner: MY FRIENDS CALL ME FABI Winfield: Excellent! Fabi, my name is Jacob. How are you today? Fabi: EVERYTHING IS BLACK Fabi: WHY CANT I FEEL MY ARMS AND LEGS Winfield: We've ripped your consciousness out of your body and into a computer - but good news! There's a way to put you back into your body. Let's just have a chat first, though. Fabi: WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO ME Winfield: Can't have you trying to kill yourself like your friends - we don't usually like to resort to this, but your team has forced us to get a bit creative. Fabi: RELEASE ME THIS INSTANT Winfield: Sorry, friend - can't be doing that just yet. How about we talk first? Fabi begins to chant in Latin. Winfield: Oh, please, go ahead - I can wait. Chanting continues for another thirty seconds. Winfield yawns. Winfield: Alright, that's enough of that. I'm sure by now you've realized that it's a bit harder to call on the powers of darkness when you don't even have a proper mouth or body to call with? Fabi: LET ME GO NOW Winfield: Counteroffer - Tell me something I don't know in the next thirty seconds, or I'll put you in a simulated 100,000 year timeloop and then you can tell me something I don't know. Fabi remains silent for another thirty seconds. Winfield: Alright, have it your way\u2026 Fabi: NO STOP Fabi: MY FULL NAME IS FABIANO LUCIANO VELLUCIANI Winfield: Excellent, now we're getting somewhere. Tell me, Fabiano - what do you do for work? Fabi: I AM ONE OF THE LORD'S SERVANTS Winfield: Could you be more specific? It's a big world - lots of Lords out there. Fabi: I AM A BLADE FOR CHRIST Winfield: Hmmm\u2026 So what's a Vatican assassin doing so far from home? Fabi: ISNT IT OBVIOUS Winfield: Enlighten me. Fabi: THE SEVEN SEALS OF DARKNESS ARE SHATTERING \\\\ THE WORLD IS BREAKING \\\\ THE ABOMINATIONS APPEAR MORE RAPIDLY \\\\ THERE IS NO HOPE FOR SAVING THIS EXISTENCE Winfield: So spell it out for me - what does this have to do with the horn? Fabi: THE SHOFAR BRINGS ABOUT AN ENDING AND FOR THE RIGHTEOUS HOPEFULLY A GOOD ONE Winfield: Nobody knows where the disappeared are going, or to what purpose - or what really happens if someone were to blow the horn seven times. All we've got are guesses - you know that, right? Fabi: BETTER THIS GAMBLE THAN THE THOUSAND SOUL DEATHS OF THE ABOMINATIONS THAT APPROACH Winfield: I see. And what about those not of Abrahamic faith? Fabi: I ECHO SAINT PAUL IN HIS EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS \\\\ WOULD THAT I COULD CUT MYSELF OFF FROM CHRIST FOR THE SAKE OF MY UNSAVED BRETHREN \\\\ THAT I COULD ACCEPT DAMNATION FOR THEIR SALVATION Fabi: BETTER TO GAMBLE ON THE SALVATION OF SOME THAN EMBRACE THE SURE DAMNATION OF ALL Post-Interrogation Assessment: Backchannels verified that Fabiano Velluciani is who he says he is. We've scoured every nearby city, town, and habitation, and found another few Spada agents scattered around. They have all been taken offsite for interrogation. Recommendations: None at this time.

        "MEMO: Dissolution of Vatican-Foundation JOA 729 From the Foundation Diplomatic Relations Office: The events of December 20, 2017 at Site-77 have not been adequately addressed by the Vatican Office for Secrets and Prophecies. Despite consistently disavowing both the existence of and actions committed by GOI-182 ( \"la Spada di Cristo\" ), they have refused to share information or render known Spada agents over to Foundation custody. Our intelligence indicates clear financial and operation links between Spada and the Vatican - under the terms of Vatican-Foundation JOA 729, they are therefore considered under the umbrella and jurisdiction of the Vatican and are not to be interfered with by the Foundation. Due to the VOSP's unacceptable lack of cooperation, we are officially invoking the Dissolution Clause of JOA 729 - as such, any and all Vatican-affiliated GOIs that the VOSP disavows are no longer subject to diplomatic immunity and are to be treated as independent GOIs. Note that this does not affect any other Vatican-Foundation JOAs, nor does this apply to Vatican-avowed GOIs. Signed: Allana Salviatore, Senior Director, Diplomatic Relations Office",

It is under MEGIDDO precautions at all times. Per the terms of Foundation-HI JOA 2-63, three members of the Sons of Shammai and three Foundation employees of verified Abrahamic faith are to be on standby in an adjacent room at all times as preparation for possible use of SCP-4261.",
    "description": "SCP-4261 is a shofar, a type of trumpet traditionally made of ram\u2019s horn and used in ancient Israelite religious ceremonies. Though the material is identical in composition to ram\u2019s horn, it possesses physical properties and tensile strength far in advance of actual ram\u2019s horn, with removed samples shown to have energy dispersal properties sufficient to withstand an output equivalent to a 3.0 Megaton nuclear device. It should therefore be noted that in the event of Site-77\u2019s failsafe nuclear device activating, retrieval of this item is of the highest priority as it will most likely have withstood the blast.",
