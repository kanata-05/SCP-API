A detachment of RRH in their insurgency guise intercepted Loyd four kilometers from the premises and he was terminated after firing upon the task force.\n\n\nIn his possession was a newly discovered stele, as well as a seed of the extinct Judean Date Palm tree. The latter was quickly discovered to possess powerful but mundane flesh manipulation and replication capabilities. It was designated Anomalous Item-001, and was given to Dr. Christopher Zartion to assist in the development of Project Lazarus. The Stele's contents are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he had borne him aloft a third league,\n\nThe eagle said to him, said to Etana,\n\n\"Look, my friend, how the land is now!\"\n\n\"The sea has become a gardener's ditch\".\n\nAfter they had ascended to the heaven of Anu,\n\nAt the gate of Sin\n\nThe eagle and Etana did obeisance together,\n\nBut the Mother would not give him the Seed.\n\nThey passed through the gates of Anu, Enlil and Ea,\n\nThe eagle and Etana did obeisance together,\n\nBut each would not give him the Seed.\n\nHe saw a gate with windows, it had no seal,\n\nAnd went inside.\n\nA remarkable young woman was seated therein,\n\nShe was imposing and beautiful of feature.\n\nA throne was set out, the ground was trodden down,\n\nUnder the throne lions were crouching.\n\nFor she was Shamash, and the eagle and Etana did obeisance together.\n\nEtana beseeched Shamash once again,\n\n\"Shamash, why do the Annunaki refuse me?\"\n\nThe goddess cried out,\n\n\"King of Kish, that power is not meant for you!\"\n\n\"You will live long, and then another blood must reign.\"\n\nEtana was cast out from the gate.\n\nNo god in heaven would help Kish.\n\nOn Eagle's wings, he ascended above heaven.\n\nBeyond the sky, the Black Moon.\n\nThe eagle and Etana did obeisance together,\n\nbefore the throne carved of ichor.\n\nThe King beyond time whispered to Etana,\n\n\"I know what you seek, and I will give it to you.\"\n\n\"But l must be given a gift as well.\"\n\n\"You desire it not for yourself, but for your people.\"\n\n\"They will bear me a gift in your stead.\"\n\n\"Kingship will reign in Kish, and order in Man.\"\n\n\"But for an age you will give unto me your nature.\"\n\n\"The beasts shall fall silent, and the Annunaki fade.\"\n\n\"Time's call will be heard, and the deathless shall die.\"\n\n\"To rise you will fall, and my howl shall resound.\"\n\n\"In time, the Life you have purchased will begin to fade,\n\n\"As the soul you have sacrificed will return.\"\n\n\"You will know the age is done, when you hear the Black Moon's howl.\"\n\nAnd Etana fell back to the earth, as Eagle could no longer hear him.\n\nSeed in hand, Bilah was born unto Kish. But his life was far shorter than his father's.\n\nKish did not cry as in Etana's vision,\n\nBut Kish did cry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Overseer Emergency Meeting 29\n:\n\n\n\n\nO5-1\n: You've heard the account. How do we proceed?\n\n\nO5-3\n: You're certain we can trust this? It could be any old mythological hogwash.\n\n\nO5-2\n: There's no doubt. It fits too well with the scattered accounts we've recovered from the \nChildren of the Night\n about the interregnum between our civilizations. They never made sense before.\n\n\nO5-8\n: Because we didn't know the truth about our own natures.\n\n\nO5-2\n: Yes.\n\n\nO5-6\n: Was everything we've done pointless? Are we just hypocrites in the end?\n\n\nO5-1\n: We've always been hypocrites, this merely extends the scale. But it doesn't change what we have to do.\n\n\nO5-11\n: Even if that means we've been locking up the only \"normal\" ones this whole time?\n\n\nO5-5\n: Right or wrong, I can't turn back. If I do, it means everyone who've died have been sacrificed for nothing. Can anyone here stand that weight?\n\n\nBrief Silence\n\n\nO5-12\n: I don't give a damn what an anomaly is in an empirical sense. It's an anomaly to our society, and that should be enough.\n\n\nO5-7\n: Hear, hear. What we once were does not change who we are today.\n\n\nO5-4\n: And what happens when the Black Moon howls, which this seems to imply will be soon?\n\n\nO5-1\n: Most likely, we fall. But on a timescale as long as this, even relatively close may give us centuries. No reason to despair over this when any of a hundred anomalies could end the world on any given day. In the meantime, we set precautions and try to create a warning system. It is all we can do.\n\n\nO5-13\n: There may be one recourse we can take to counter this threat, though it is not a guaranteed success.\n\n\nO5-1\n: What do you propose?\n\n\nO5-13\n: We have the Seed now, and with it the chance to complete Project Lazarus. Project Thaumiel and its component parts were intended solely as a failsafe, but with proactive use it may delay or prevent this event.\n\n\nO5-10\n: \u2026Agreed.
