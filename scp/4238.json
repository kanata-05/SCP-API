Meals are to be \ndelivered once a day via drone\n taken in the cafeteria. \nSCP-4238 is not to be given access to any sort of silverware or utensils at any point. Control of SCP-4238's cell is to be handled by Senior Researcher Fishbaum.\n\n\nA live security feed is to be recorded and \nsent to Senior Researcher Fishbaum\n stored on standard Foundation data servers. \nDue to SCP-4238's deceptive nature, no other individuals are to watch the recorded feeds without authorization from Senior Researcher Fishbaum.\n\n\nCleaning crews are to visit once a day after testing sessions to clean the chamber and, following Incident 4238-A, remove SCP-4238-1 instances before disposing of them.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4238 is an approximately 8-year-old female humanoid formerly known as Amelie Bassett. The entity is capable of anomalously enhancing physical objects, referred to as an SCP-4238-1 instance, and marked with a \"(+[Level])\" depending on the level of enhancement. Enhancing an item increases the object's durability, efficiency relative to the item's intended purpose by 30%\n1\n, and develop a colored aura. Items can be enhanced multiple times, increasing the durability and efficiency by an additive 30% as well as changing the color of the aura. The colors range from purple, seen in (+1) instances, to red, seen in (+7) instances.\n\n\nEnhancement appears to be governed by random chance, starting at approximately 95% chance of a successful enhancement for mundane items and decreasing to a lower limit of approximately 0% by the 7th enhancement. On an unsuccessful enhancement, the item will quickly break down into its base molecular components, effectively destroying the item.\n\n\nIn the case of an unsuccessful enhancement, SCP-4238 will spontaneously manifest injuries of varying severity dependent on the enhancement level of the item prior to failure.\n These injuries are offset by an enhanced regeneration factor, allowing the entity to recover from most injuries within minutes.\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n\n\nInitial testing was conducted by Senior Researcher Fishbaum, along with Junior Researcher Steven Han, from June 2nd, 2015 through June 25th, 2015. Extraneous logs have been removed for brevity. Full list available upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+]\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0[+]\n\n\n\n\n[-]\u00a0Close\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0[-]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 1\n\n\nItem:\n Standard screwdriver\n\n\nResult:\n Successful.

Interestingly, the wound healed within seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 4238-A:\n\n\nOn June 27th, 2015, Senior Researcher Fishbaum was attacked by SCP-4238 following an unsuccessful enhancement attempt. SCP-4238 utilized a plastic knife given to it for a meal that had been enhanced 3 times to stab Fishbaum. Given SCP-4238's size, Fishbaum was able to disarm the entity and subdue it until security intervened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Security Footage of SCP-4238's Containment Cell: Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n June 27th, 2015\n\n\nNotes:\n Due to an audio encoding error, the following file was submitted by Senior Researcher Fishbaum hours after the initial incident with several video and audio errors. Pitch shifts and screen blackouts are common.\n\n\nDiscrepancies are highlighted in red in the following transcript.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Han had been sent to acquire various items for testing.\n\n\n\n\nVideo begins with Fishbaum sitting at a metal table across from SCP-4238; its jumpsuit is stained with blood. Various items lay on the table, all glowing various shades of purple and blue. The table has several blackened spots covering the surface. Fishbaum holds a blurred item with a noticeable orange aura.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n \nAmelie\n, please stop making this difficult.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n I don't want to\u2026 it hurts\u2026\n\n\nVideo goes black\n\n\nFishbaum:\n (\nsighs\n). \nAmelie\n, if you \ndo\n this, I'll \nget you ice cream, okay?\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n \u2026no, I don't\u2026\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Great, so let's do this one more time, okay? For me?\n\n\n20 seconds of silence follow. SCP-4238 screams. 45 seconds of silence follow.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Help! Security!\n\n\nVideo resumes\n\n\nSCP-4238 is curled on the floor in a puddle of blood. Fishbaum is breathing heavily, a small gash visible on the palm of his left hand. A plastic knife with a blue aura is in his right hand. The table has been knocked over, scattering the various items onto the floor.\n\n\nSecurity personnel rush into the room and restrain SCP-4238.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice regarding SCP-4238's containment procedures\n\n\nSCP-4238's object class has been elevated to Keter following Incident 4238-A. All furniture is to be removed from the containment cell and all meals are to be delivered directly to the cell without any utensils. Any interviews, tests, or other meetings with SCP-4238 are to be cleared by me first. SCP-4238 should be handcuffed prior to any such meetings.\n\n\n\u2014 Senior Researcher Fishbaum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2:\n\n\nFurther testing was performed independently by Senior Researcher Fishbaum from August 1st, 2015, to September 23rd, 2015.

The video was taken with a Foundation-issued mounted body camera.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n December 20th, 2015\n\n\n\n\nRichards is walking towards SCP-4238\u2019s containment chamber. Fishbaum can be seen just outside, his hand on the biometric scanner. As Richards approaches, he takes his hand off of the scanner.\n\n\nRichards:\n Hi there, I'm Angela Richards, here to do a quick psych check on SCP-4238? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re Dr. Fishbaum, right?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Er, yes, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m sorry, who are you again?\n\n\nRichards:\n Angela Richards, on-site therapist? You got my email, right?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n No\u2026 no, I did not.\n\n\nRichards:\n Hm, must\u2019ve gotten lost then. Anyways, I have a scheduled psych eval for SCP-4238. Today. Right now.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n I\u2019m afraid that I have a testing session scheduled with SCP-4238 right now, so either you\u2019re mistaken or I am. But I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019m correct.\n\n\nRichards:\n Your testing can wait. I\u2019d like to speak with SCP-4238 as soon as possible to avoid any more delays. Unless you want me to explain to my superiors that you\u2019re delaying the psych eval for the second time.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n \u2026Fine. But I\u2019m going to be there as well.\n\n\nRichards:\n No can do. Your presence may aggravate SCP-4238, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to get a clear answer out of her if you\u2019re there.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Hm. Alright, go then. I\u2019ll just reschedule my testing for the next time.\n\n\nFishbaum walks past Richards.\n\n\nRichards:\n Uh, good talk\u2026 okay, let\u2019s go.\n\n\nRichards heads into the chamber and closes the door behind her. The lights are turned on. SCP-4238 is not in sight, though the blanket covering a curled-up individual on a futon appears conspicuous.\n\n\nRichards:\n Hello? Amelie? Oh. Okay then.\n\n\nRichards notices the blanket and crouches down before it.\n\n\nRichards:\n Hi, my name's Angela.\n\n\nThe blanket shifts slightly.\n\n\nRichards:\n Here, I uh, I brought cookies-\n\n\nThe blankets shift again and a small hole is formed through which the silhouette of SCP-4238 can be seen. Richards places a backpack down in front of her, and pulls out a flimsy plastic container of sugar cookies. She opens it and sets it down in front of SCP-4238.\n\n\nRichards:\n They're not the best, but uh\u2026 yeah. (\ncoughs\n)\n\n\nThe blanket shifts again. A single hand extends outward along the floor and towards the open box. It grabs a single cookie before slowly snaking back under the blanket. A brief flash emanates from the edges of the blanket before the hand returns with the cookie, now radiating a purple aura.\n\n\nRichards:\n Oh! No no, these are for you to eat.\n\n\nThe hand falters. Richards digs through her backpack and pulls out a notepad.\n\n\nRichards:\n Y-You can have them all, if you want. Really.\n\n\nThe hand pulls back into the blankets. The sounds of chewing can be heard. The hand extends again before grabbing the entire box and pulling it within the blankets.\n\n\nRichards:\n You're gonna get crumbs all over your blanket, but uh, I've done that in bed a couple times too so, no judgement from me.\n\n\nSCP-4238 violently coughs from underneath the blankets.\n\n\nRichards:\n Slow down, you're gonna choke.\n\n\nRichards pulls a water bottle from the backpack, opens it, and places it in front of SCP-4238, who grabs it quickly. The plastic container is ejected from the blanket along with an empty water bottle.\n\n\nRichards:\n Um, okay. Can I ask you some questions?\n\n\nSCP-4238 remains silent.\n\n\nRichards:\n This is worse than I expected. Well, uh, I'm gonna go now, okay? I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll try to come by again.\n\n\nRichards leaves the containment chamber and turns the camera off.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand\n\n\nFrom:\n Angela Richards\n\n\nSubject:\n Ethical Treatment of SCP-4238\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know I\u2019m not a licensed psychiatrist yet but fuck it. I believe that SCP-4238 is being mistreated and abused by Senior Researcher Connor Fishbaum. As I\u2019m sure you can see from the attachment, SCP-4238 appears to be deeply afraid of people and was traumatized heavily enough that when given a cookie, instead of eating it as a normal 8-year-old child does, she used her anomalous ability and gave it back. That is not normal.\n\n\nCombined with the odd testing logs, odd security logs, and the fact that Fishbaum delayed the initial psych eval of SCP-4238, all signs are pointing to abuse of the SCP in question, his position, or both. I ask that this be formally submitted to the Ethics Committee for review.\n\n\n- Angela Richards, M.S., B.S.\n\n\nRecording I took of SCP-4238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Angela Richards\n\n\nFrom:\n Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Ethical Treatment of SCP-4238\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve received your report and have submitted your findings for discussion.\n\n\n- Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-4:\n\n\nResearcher Fishbaum resumed testing of SCP-4238 from January 11th, 2016 to February 10th, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+]\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0[+]\n\n\n\n\n[-]\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0[-]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 87\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nResult:\n Unsuccessful.\n\n\nNoted Injuries:\n Light bruising along right chest.

Pitch shifts and screen blackouts are common.\n\n\nDiscrepancies are highlighted red in the following transcript.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4238's outline can be seen underneath its blanket as Fishbaum enters the chamber.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Hello? \nAmelie?\n I'm back.\n\n\nThe blankets shift slightly. SCP-4238's outline shrinks.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Come now, let's not make things hard for \nus\n. Come on, get out.\n\n\nThere is no response from SCP-4238.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Please? (\nsigh\n) Alright, that's fine.\n\n\nVideo goes black.\n\n\nFishbaum: Not sure why it cut out here. Just told SCP-4238 that I'd get it its favorite flavor of ice cream if it worked with me.\n\n\nVideo is restored.\n\n\nSCP-4238 sits at the table, biting its lip. Its blanket is in the corner of the room, opposite the futon. Fishbaum stands in front of the table and wipes his brow with a sleeve before taking a seat.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n There\u2026 that wasn't so bad, was it? \u2026right?\n\n\nSCP-4238 nods.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Alright, let's get started then.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-6:\n\n\nAn audio log was recorded by on-site therapist Richards in a meeting with Senior Researcher Fishbaum.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n January 16th, 2016\n\n\n\n\nRichards:\n Sorry about that, I had to finish up a draft I was working on. You wanted to see me?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Yes, I just wanted to ask how your meeting with 4238 went?\n\n\nRichards:\n The one from a month ago? It was fine. I\u2019ll be meeting with her again soon, actually. You\u2019ll have to forgive me if I can\u2019t divulge more. Doctor-patient confidentiality and all.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n \u2026Right. Listen, Richards.\n\n\nRichards:\n Mhm?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Unfortunately, you\u2019ve been transferred. You received the email, right?\n\n\nRichards:\n What email? What are you talking about?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Well, Director Yol was made aware of the danger that 4238 posed and with you being a relatively new employee, well, he was concerned that you were putting yourself at risk. So, he\u2019s decided to transfer you to a less dangerous skip. Maybe Euclid, you know?\n\n\nRichards:\n Amelie is \nmy\n patient. She- We\u2019ve barely even begun the bonding process-\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Exactly, and that makes this transition easier on 4238. It hasn\u2019t really bonded with you, as you\u2019ve said. So, what\u2019s the problem with changing therapists at this point, right?\n\n\nRichards:\n I- but\u2026\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Well, that\u2019s really all I wanted to say.

Auxiliary power supplies kept major security measures intact, though lower priority systems, such as personal monitoring systems of Risk Class: Warning and below were disconnected.\n\n\nDuring this time, SCP-4238's containment chamber logged an entrance and exit by on-site therapist Angela Richards. This corroborates the following personal video taken by Richards.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n February 17th, 2016\n\n\nNotes:\n Video was recorded on a Foundation-issued body mounted camera.\n\n\n\n\nRichards appears to be within SCP-4238's containment chamber.\n\n\nRichards:\n (\nmuttering\n) If he wants direct evidence, I'll get direct evidence.\n\n\nRichards sighs and walks over to SCP-4238, which is hiding underneath its blanket.

Homemade, this time.\n\n\nRichards places her backpack on the floor beside her and withdraws a Ziploc-brand plastic bag. She opens the bag and retrieves a single cookie. She places the bag at the edge of the blanket. SCP-4238 grabs it.\n\n\nRichards:\n Can I sit next to you?\n\n\nSCP-4238 goes still.\n\n\nRichards:\n It\u2019s fine if you say no. I can sit over here, it\u2019s fine.\n\n\nSCP-4238 shuffles slightly to the side, creating a small space on the futon.\n\n\nRichards:\n Is that a yes? Okay, thank you very much.\n\n\nRichards quickly moves over to the futon and sits down.\n\n\nRichards:\n This is a lot more comfortable than the hard floor.\n\n\nSCP-4238 nods and continues eating. The two sit in silence for several minutes with Richards periodically checking her watch.\n\n\nRichards:\n \u2026are you okay, Amelie?\n\n\nSCP-4238 does not respond.\n\n\nRichards:\n If you\u2019re not happy, you can tell me.

He moves over to SCP-4238 who is underneath its blanket again.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Good morning, \nAmelie\n! How\u2019re you doing today? Good? Good.\n\n\nSCP-4238 remains motionless.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Alright, time to get up. We got a lot of testing to go through today, and I\u2019d like to go through this rather quickly. Come on, get up. \nPlease?\n\n\nVideo goes black\n\n\n45 seconds of silence follow.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n \nGosh, you\u2019re such a silly girl.\n Always making things diffi- What is this? Where\u2019d you get this from? \nAmelie, please tell me where you got this from.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n M-Miss angel gave it to me\u2026\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Angel? What? When? \nAh, whatever, let\u2019s just get to testing.\n\n\n3 minutes of silence follow. SCP-4238 screams in pain before abruptly stopping. Another 5 minutes of silence follow.\n\n\nVideo resumes\n\n\nSCP-4238 is curled up on the floor, its hands clutching its stomach. One of its legs is twisted at an odd angle. The table has shifted against the wall and Fishbaum stands directly before SCP-4238.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Why\u2019d you have to go and do that, \nAmelie? You know that trying to enhance further than red doesn\u2019t work.\n God \ndang\n it, I\u2019ll be back later.\n\n\nFishbaum leaves the cell with his bag.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-9:\n\n\nAnother audio log was recorded by Angela Richards and Senior Researcher Fishbaum.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 7th, 2016\n\n\n\n\nRichards:\n Sorry, I was on the phone with someone, did you need me for something? I\u2019m a bit busy right now.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n This conversation being recorded?\n\n\nRichards:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Odd question to ask, sorry. Wife\u2019s been getting on my case about \u2018big government\u2019. She uh, she doesn\u2019t know about the Foundation. Anyways, uh, another odd question, have you seen, uh, SCP-4238 recently?\n\n\nRichards:\n Um, no? I was taken off because of the \u2018danger\u2019, remember?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Right, yeah, so, um, \nsomeone\n got into the chamber. There was a foreign object in there, something that could\u2019ve been used as a weapon in the right hands. I\u2019m just going through a list of people who have access to SCP-4238 and I noticed you were still on that list apparently.\n\n\nRichards:\n Yeah no, I uh, I haven\u2019t even seen um, SCP-4238 in, months now?\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Yeah okay, no that makes sense. I\u2019m just here to let you know that we\u2019re replacing the old biometric scanner and locking down 4238\u2019s chamber. No one in or out without explicit permission. We\u2019re talking revamped biometrics, rotating passcodes, a retina scanner, the works.\n\n\nRichards:\n I see.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Well, that\u2019s all I wanted to ask you. I still have a few more people to talk with, so I\u2019ll leave you be.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-10:\n\n\nOn March 9th, 2016, Angela Richards recorded and sent the following video to Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 9th, 2016\n\n\nNotes:\n Video was recorded on a Foundation-issued body mounted camera.\n\n\n\n\nRichards stands before SCP-4238\u2019s containment cell. Various tools are lying against the wall where the biometric scanner is. Wires stick out from the wall and pieces of technology are partly implemented, though offline.\n\n\nRichards:\n Marlon, you better be right about this\u2026\n\n\nRichards pulls out a thin piece of wire and begins pushing it through a small hole in the biometric scanner plate. She maneuvers it around for several seconds before a loud beep sounds out and the door opens.\n\n\nRichards:\n Alright, that\u2019s good.\n\n\nRichards quickly walks into the cell and over to SCP-4238, who is currently asleep. Its blanket has multiple holes in it.\n\n\nRichards:\n Amelie? Amelie! It\u2019s me!\n\n\nSCP-4238 opens its eyes, blinking multiple times before jerking backwards and fumbling with its blanket. It calms down after several seconds and sits upright.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Miss Angel?\n\n\nSCP-4238 tears up and begins to cry quietly.\n\n\nRichards:\n Oh god, I\u2019m so sorry, Amelie.\n\n\nRichards tentatively puts her arms around SCP-4238. SCP-4238 buries its head into Richards.\n\n\nRichards:\n I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Please help me\u2026 please\u2026\n\n\nRichards:\n I- I\u2019m trying, Amelie.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n I\u2019ll do anything, please just help me\u2026 I\u2019ll be good, I promise.\n\n\nRichards:\n \u2026okay, shh, shhh\u2026 It\u2019s okay, everything will be alright.\n\n\nSCP-4238 continues to cry, though substantially less.\n\n\nRichards:\n Amelie\u2026 I promise you, I will get you out of here. Okay? I promise. But I need you to be brave for me, okay? Can you be brave for me?\n\n\nSCP-4238 pulls away from Richards slightly, and nods.\n\n\nRichards:\n Okay\u2026 okay\u2026 (\nRichards takes multiple deep breaths.\n) I need you to stay here-\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n No\u2026 no no no, please no! I don\u2019t want to be here anymore. I want my daddy!\n\n\nSCP-4238 begins to cry again.\n\n\nRichards:\n Please, Amelie, I- I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t do this, do you understand? Just for a little bit longer.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n I don\u2019t want to\u2026\n\n\nRichards:\n One month. Okay? I know that sounds like a long time, but just one month, and you\u2019ll never be hurt again. Ever.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n \u2026do you promise?\n\n\nRichards:\n I promise.\n\n\nRichards pulls SCP-4238 in again and holds it tightly for several seconds.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n He hits me. Every time. Even if I do what he wants.\n\n\nRichards:\n I'm sorry. He won\u2019t do it again. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\n\n\nRichards pulls away and digs through her backpack. She withdraws a small, round, plush owl and places it in SCP-4238\u2019s hand.\n\n\nRichards:\n This is Mr. Squishy. He\u2019s my good luck charm.\n\n\nSCP-4238 cradles the plush and looks up at Richards, her tears slowing down.\n\n\nRichards:\n One month, okay? I\u2019ll save you.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Richards sent another message to Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand regarding SCP-4238 on March 10th, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand\n\n\nFrom:\n Angela Richards\n\n\nSubject:\n How about now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about this?

Notably, this entry did not contain any of the previous entries' video and audio errors.\n\n\n\n\nFishbaum can be seen entering the room with a heavy duffel bag. SCP-4238 is under its blanket again.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Hello, 4238. I'm back, so you know what that means, right?\n\n\nSCP-4238 remains still.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Again? Really? You remember what happened last time, right? Get up. Now.\n\n\nFishbaum walks over to the blanket and grabs it roughly. He pulls the blanket off SCP-4238 and throws it into a corner. It slowly sits upright, avoiding looking at Fishbaum.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n There we are. Good to see you again, 4238- What is that?\n\n\nFishbaum kneels down and roughly pulls a small plush owl from SCP-4238\u2019s hands.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Where did you get this from?? Look at me. Look at me. I SAID LOOK AT ME!\n\n\nFishbaum slaps SCP-4238. It falls to the ground and whimpers.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Fuck. Look what you made me do. Get up. Now tell me. Where did you get this from? Hm? Did Angela give it to you? Did she do that?\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n G-Give him back!\n\n\nFishbaum:\n You know what? Fuck it. I don\u2019t have time right now. I\u2019ll deal with this later. (\nmuttering\n) I don\u2019t need Marshall on my ass again.\n\n\nFishbaum opens the duffel bag and takes out a large caliber sniper rifle. He places it onto the table.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n What are you waiting for? Go.\n\n\nSCP-4238 places its hands on the rifle and shuts her eyes. The rifle flashes white as SCP-4238 winces. A pale purple aura now emanates from the rifle.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Again. I need this at a green at least. So you better pray to god that you don't mess up.\n\n\nSCP-4238 places her hands on the rifle again. It flashes white again. SCP-4238 cries out as the rifle disintegrates over the course of 20 seconds. Her eyes are wide as they flick from the rifle\u2019s prior location to Fishbaum.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Goddammit. You know how much one of those things cost? Ten fucking grand.\n\n\nFishbaum grabs SCP-4238's head and slams it against the table's edge. SCP-4238 recoils and falls backwards while screaming. A large gash can be seen on its forehead, slightly covered by its hands. Blood spills over SCP-4238's hands and onto the floor.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Why do you have to do this? Hm? Every fucking time. It's not much, you know? All I'm asking for is just a little favor, and here you are, making things difficult.\n\n\nFishbaum takes out another large caliber sniper rifle and sets it on the table.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Let's try this again. Now.\n\n\nSniffling, SCP-4238 takes its hands off its wound, allowing the blood to flow freely down its face, and places them on the rifle. It begins again and successfully enhances the rifle three times, resulting in a green aura.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n See? I knew you could do it! Why couldn't you do this last time? Hm? Are you trying to mess with me?\n\n\nFishbaum returns the rifle to the duffel bag and pulls out a small vial. He places it on the table carefully.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Now, careful with this. I \nneed\n this at yellow, minimum. Do you understand me? You fuck this up, and I'll shred your little owl friend, okay?\n\n\nSCP-4238 nods twice after a brief pause.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Good. Get started.\n\n\nSCP-4238 places its hands on the vial and begins the enhancement process. SCP-4238 proceeds with the enhancement five times, resulting in a yellow aura around the vial.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Oh\u2026 how beautiful\u2026 again. Do it again.\n\n\nSCP-4238 pulls her hands back, shaking her head.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n I said again. Do it. Come on\u2026 Do you want to do it or do you want me to hit you again, hm?\n\n\nSCP-4238 places its hands back on the vial and enhances it again, keeping its eyes shut. The vial flashes white and now possesses a distinct orange aura.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Ohhh, this is good. This is very good. Again.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n I don't want to-\n\n\nFishbaum slaps SCP-4238. It whimpers again.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Again.\n\n\nSCP-4238 takes several breaths before putting its hands on the vial and beginning the enhancement process again. The vial flashes white and SCP-4238 freezes. The vial disintegrates.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n GOD FUCKING DAMMIT! YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!\n\n\nFishbaum throws the table to the side and kicks SCP-4238 in the chest, knocking it over. He begins to stomp on SCP-4238's thigh. SCP-4238's bones audibly crack as blood pools around its curled body.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Why can't you do \nanything\n right?! Huh!? WHY?!\n\n\nThe containment chamber door opens as Fishbaum continues to assault SCP-4238. He does not appear to notice. From the doorway, Richards, holding a large wrench, runs into the chamber and towards Fishbaum. She swings the wrench at his head. Fishbaum drops to the floor as blood spills from his head.\n\n\nRichards:\n Amelie! Oh, Jesus Christ.\n\n\nRichards drops to her knees before SCP-4238 and attempts to assess its condition. Fishbaum rises to his feet unsteadily. He holds his head with one hand while the other pulls out a handgun.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n (\nwheezing\n) You fucking bitch.\n\n\nRichards turns her head towards Fishbaum and freezes.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Scared now, eh?\n\n\nRichards:\n Fishbaum, you don't-\n\n\nFishbaum fires his handgun. Richards is thrown backwards as the bullet hits her in the chest. He aims the gun at SCP-4238.\n\n\nFishbaum:\n Guess I gotta tie up loose ends here. It was good while it lasted-\n\n\nRichards suddenly sits up and throws her wrench at Fishbaum. It directly connects with his head, causing him to drop his gun. Yelling, Richards gets up and rushes Fishbaum, tackling him to the floor. Bleeding profusely, Fishbaum is straddled by Richards, who begins to repeatedly punch him in the face. Richards only stops when Fishbaum ceases to move. Breathing heavily, Richards crawls over to SCP-4238 and takes off her lab coat, revealing standard-issue Foundation light body armor. She sits down by SCP-4238 and drapes her lab coat over it.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-11:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Security Footage of Site-17 Kitchen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n September 10th, 2016\n\n\nNotes:\n Following Incident-4238-B, SCP-4238 was granted limited usage of the Site-17 kitchen under the supervision of two Foundation guards. On recommendation of Ethics Committee Liaison Marlon Brand, Henry Bassett was hired to Site-17 as part of the \u2018Better Meals, Better Feels\u2019 initiative.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4238 stands upon a stool at a table, struggling to stir the contents of a large metal bowl. Henry Bassett stands beside SCP-4238, looking into a notebook. \"Amelie's Recipe Book\" is poorly written on the cover.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Are you sure it's supposed to be three sticks?\n\n\nBassett peers over notebook.\n\n\nBassett:\n Yep. That's what it says here. 'Three sticks of butter.'\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Hmm\u2026 okay.\n\n\nRichards appears in the kitchen from behind the man, who turns and looks surprised upon seeing her. SCP-4238 stops mixing.\n\n\nBassett:\n Angela? What're you doing here? I thought you weren't coming until Friday?\n\n\nRichards:\n Yeah uh, there's been a change in plans. What're you all up to?\n\n\nBassett:\n Well, Amelie is hard at work right now.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n No looking! It's a surprise!\n\n\nSCP-4238 attempts to put herself between Richards and the mixing bowl.\n\n\nRichards:\n Alright, okay. I won't look.\n\n\nSCP-4238 squints at Richards before turning back to the mixing bowl and continuing to mix with increased fervor.\n\n\nBassett:\n So, what're you actually doing here, Angela?\n\n\nRichards:\n I uh, just wanted to give an update on Fishbaum and uh, one other thing.\n\n\nSCP-4238 pauses its mixing upon hearing \"Fishbaum,\" before resuming.\n\n\nBassett:\n Oh? You guys didn\u2019t um, off him?\n\n\nRichards:\n No, he's not dead. I'm uh, not allowed to divulge too much, but uh, he's no longer in any position to hurt anyone. Ever. Not quite B-Class anymore.\n\n\nBassett:\n I uh, I see\u2026 How\u2019d you get this update? I thought you said this kind of stuff was kept in a blackbox?\n\n\nRichards:\n Yeah, that's the other thing. I've uh, I've changed departments. I'm not going to be able to have my bimonthly visits anymore.\n\n\nSCP-4238 spins around and looks at Richards with wide eyes. It gets off the stool and walks up to Richards.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Y-You're not visiting anymore? Is it because of me? Did I do something?\n\n\nRichards:\n Oh god no, Amelie, it's not because of you. It's just\u2026 the Foundation doesn't really like it when their workers hit other workers with wrenches.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n \u2026so it's my fault?\n\n\nRichards pulls SCP-4238 into a hug. She crouches down to SCP-4238's eye level, placing her hands on its shoulders.\n\n\nRichards:\n No, and stop saying that. Whatever happens will \nnever\n be your fault. I chose to do what I did because it was the right thing to do. Never blame yourself for being hurt, okay?\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Then why can't we meet anymore?\n\n\nBassett:\n Amelie! Don\u2019t ask questions like that. You know how much she\u2019s done for both of us.\n\n\nRichards:\n It\u2019s fine, Henry. I've joined the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nBassett:\n The Ethics Committee? The ones who let that \nmonster\n have my daughter? You\u2019re joining \nthem\n?\n\n\nRichards:\n First, calm down, and uh, second, not quite. They had their reasons, Henry. I- I can\u2019t tell you why, but they were dealing with\u2026 things. And\u2026 I want to make a difference. To make sure that what happened to Amelie doesn\u2019t happen again. That we don\u2019t just forget the smaller good in favor of the greater good.\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n So we can't meet anymore?\n\n\nRichards:\n What? No, no. Just\u2026 not as often. I'm going to be moving around a lot more. Making sure that what happened to you, doesn't happen to anyone else.\n\n\nBassett:\n I trust you, Angela. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m incredibly thankful for everything you\u2019ve done for me and Amelie. Getting me this position, letting me see my daughter again, I never thought this could happen.\n\n\nRichards:\n Please, it was mostly Marlon who set everything up. Man\u2019s got pull with a lot of people. But enough about me, how about you tell me what you've been up to, hm?\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n I was, um, making cookies. For you.\n\n\nRichards:\n Can I help you then? Before I leave?\n\n\nSCP-4238 nods several times.\n\n\nRichards:\n Alright, I'll teach you my special homemade recipe while we're here so when I visit again, you can make me cookies, okay?\n\n\nSCP-4238:\n Okay!\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

    "description": "SCP-4238 is an approximately 8-year-old female humanoid formerly known as Amelie Bassett. The entity is capable of anomalously enhancing physical objects, referred to as an SCP-4238-1 instance, and marked with a \"(+[Level])\" depending on the level of enhancement. Enhancing an item increases the object's durability, efficiency relative to the item's intended purpose by 30%1, and develop a colored aura. Items can be enhanced multiple times, increasing the durability and efficiency by an additive 30% as well as changing the color of the aura. The colors range from purple, seen in (+1) instances, to red, seen in (+7) instances.",
