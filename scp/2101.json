The Foundation has currently negotiated with the Chinese government to halt all funding for the public excavation of SCP-2101. Any private donations aimed at completing the excavation of SCP-2101 are to be intercepted and redirected.\n\n\nReconstructions of fragments or whole SCP-2101-1 instances are to be occasionally loaned to outside museums and other sources, in order to maintain the disinformation campaign. A minimum of 8000 SCP-2101-1 instances must be maintained within the mausoleum at all times.\n\n\nCommunication with SCP-2101-1 must be approved in a request form beforehand, to avoid unnecessary strain. At no point is \nSCP-926\n or similar objects to be allowed within SCP-2101.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2101 refers to a sphere of effect located at 34.3849\u00b0 N, 109.2731\u00b0 E, the location of the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u9675\u53ca\u5175\u9a6c\u4fd1\u5751) (transliteration: Q\u00edn sh\u01d0 hu\u00e1ng l\u00edng j\u00ed b\u012bng m\u01ce y\u01d2ng k\u0113ng) The origin point of SCP-2101 is located roughly 8 meters below the current lowest level of the mausoleum\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-2101\u2019s anomalous effect currently triggers in all individuals who enter within a 10-meter range of the object. Given SCP-2101\u2019s position, this only affects those individuals who are located on the same level as the main excavation floor, where SCP-2101-1 instances are located. SCP-2101 projects speech directly into the minds of individuals. The content of the speech centers around attempts to free SCP-2101, with several references to \u201criches\u201d and \u201chuge tracts of land\u201d to individuals who assist in releasing SCP-2101 from its current location.\n\n\nSCP-2101-1 refers to a collection of statues constructed of terracotta, commonly known as the \u201cTerracotta Army\u201d (\u5175\u9a6c\u4fd1) (transliteration: b\u012bng m\u01ce y\u01d2ng). These statues resemble soldiers from the Qin Dynasty period of Chinese history. It has been noted that each statue is unique in its appearance. All SCP-2101-1 instances are currently located on the lowest floor of the mausoleum.\n\n\nSCP-2101-1 instances are capable of speech and movement, but they have stated that it is difficult for them to do so. Only one SCP-2101-1 instance ever speaks at one time. The speech is very slow and stilted, and has been noted to be difficult to understand at times.\n\n\nSCP-2101-1 instances claim that they actively contain SCP-2101. Multiple instances have reiterated their need to stay in their current location in order to properly maintain containment of SCP-2101. The veracity of these claims cannot be determined at this point. In past incidents, removal of SCP-2101-1 instances to the point in which less than 8000 instances were present has caused small scale seismic activity, measuring between 2 and 4 on the moment magnitude scale. The magnitude of the seismic activity increases the longer the instances are kept away from the lowest floor.\n\n\nShould the head of an SCP-2101-1 instance be destroyed, or if more than 50% of the body by mass is no longer in connection with the head, the SCP-2101-1 instance is considered to have been removed from the lowest floor. Reconstructing SCP-2101-1 instances through reconnecting destroyed pieces is the only method of rectifying this.\n\n\nObject Recovery Report 2101-A:\n The following is a transcript of the video log compiled by the containment team that made first contact with SCP-2101. The dialogue has been translated from the original Mandarin.\n\n\n\n\nDate of Recovery:\n 12/1/1974\n\n\nContainment Team:\n Bravo-20\n\n\nCommander:\n Agent Yizhong Liao\n\n\n[Video begins]\n\n\n[Opening shot is of a containment team wearing standard People\u2019s Liberation Army uniforms with the standard loadout of a small fire team.

Be advised, knowledge of anomaly has spread in the area. Stronger containment protocols may be needed.\n\n\n[Containment team reaches level containing SCP-2101-1 instances. Team disengages from ropes, and encounters SCP-2101-1 instances.]\n\n\nLiao:\n Heavens above\u2026what is this?\n\n\nAgent Hua:\n Looks like something out of a historical li\u00e1n x\u00f9 j\u00f9\n2\n.\n\n\nLiao:\n Recorded note: Team has made contact and found what appears to be thousands of statues resembling ancient soldiers.

A rough transcript of what the team recalls SCP-2101 said has been included here.]\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n Welcome, welcome. It looks like some good souls have finally arrived to free me from my imprisonment.\n\n\nLiao:\n Identify yourself.\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n I am your emperor. Bow before me, and release me from this prison. I will reward you with the riches of kings and lords.\n\n\nLiao:\n There is no emperor. Identify where you are located.\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n What do you mean by that? Surely my dynasty lives on, even now. Those petty warlords are no match for the might of my empire. I am below you, trapped in this dirt and stone by these infernal soldiers.\n\n\nLiao:\n What soldiers?\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n Those damned clay ones. I know that they\u2019re still there, else I would be free by now. Quickly, dig through this layer and free me.\n\n\n[Agent Hua approaches a statue.]\n\n\nHua:\n These are made of clay.

Keep destroying them!\n\n\n[Seismic activity begins. A new SCP-2101-1 instance (designated SCP-2101-1-2) steps forward]\n\n\nLiao:\n Cease fire! Cease fire!\n\n\nSCP-2101-1-2:\n Fix the ones destroyed. We cannot allow him escape.\n\n\nLiao:\n What is this place? What is your purpose?\n\n\nSCP-2101-1-2:\n Hard to talk or move. We were men once but sacrifice to contain emperor. He turned dangerous. Had to stop him. Saw the right path. Gave ourselves up.\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n And betrayed your emperor and liege! A monstrous betrayal, one made by cowards and thieves, the servants of those damned warlords! An entire army, rising up against me! You must right this wrong and destroy them!\n\n\nSCP-2101-1-2:\n Must not listen to him. His lies killed many.\n\n\nSCP-2101:\n I brought peace and riches to all in the land! Quickly, you must not listen to their lies! Free me now, and I will take my throne again. The empire needs me. I am its true founder and leader. They have no right to imprison me here.\n\n\nLiao:\n Why is this ground shaking?\n\n\nSCP-2101-1-2:\n He is escaping. Need focus else he escapes.\n\n\nLiao:\n We need to call in for backup and figure out what to do. Cut that camera out, Ting.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this incident, it was agreed upon in a 7 to 6 vote by the O5 Council that containment would be followed by aiding SCP-2101-1 instances, due to the implied breach caused by freeing SCP-2101.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
