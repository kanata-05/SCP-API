In addition, the property surrounding SCP-211 is currently under Foundation management, and an armed guard has been stationed in the buildings. Unauthorized personnel entering the area are to be terminated on sight.\n\n\nA series of explosive charges has been set within SCP-211, and is to be examined every \u2588\u2588 days for degradation. Should SCP-211 become overtly hostile or neutralization is otherwise requested, it is to be terminated by detonating these charges simultaneously.\n\n\nTo avoid inadvertent activation of SCP-211's defense mechanisms, extraction of SCP-211-1 should take place at a rate of fewer than \u2588 pages per hour.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-211 is a two-story building located in an abandoned district of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, IA. Records from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's archives heavily suggest that the building was originally a middle-class dwelling, belonging to G\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (since deceased of natural cause). Since then, all furnishings have disappeared, save standard light fixtures and a radiator (pictured above). Note that several of these lights' switches have not been discovered, rendering them useless. Additionally, the building's topography has been nearly completely covered with an estimated \u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 sheets of paper, hereafter collectively designated as SCP-211-1.\n\n\nGiven these facts, SCP-211 itself is in remarkably poor condition. Severe mold and grime contamination are threatening to collapse a large section of the second floor, and the attempted May 4 demolition (see Document 211-01) has left a large hole in the south wall of the building.\n\n\nRecovered sheets of SCP-211-1 may be of various aspect and origins: blank, depicting various images, ripped pages from books (most often encyclopedias or novels), printouts from the Internet, etc. The paper may be of any color; in fact, the above picture is of the only hallway in which all sheets are printed on white paper. Entire stacks of paper have been discovered in the building's basement, whose individual sheets bear little or no relation to each other. Their only real identifying characteristic is that individual sheets' edges are unusually sharp, and that should a portion of SCP-211-1 be removed, more sheets appear (from unknown origin) as replacement. Research is pending, but so far, individually, SCP-211-1's constituent parts seem to have little purpose beyond [REDACTED: See Addendum 211-01] and defense.\n\n\nDocument 211-01\n\n\n\n\nSCP Status for SCP-211 was established after the building was condemned and scheduled for demolition on 4 May 2\u2588\u2588\u2588, when the building \u201cattacked\u201d the team (hereafter labeled Incident Zero). The following is an interview of E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, one of four survivors, conducted by Dr. Spinoza.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Spinoza:\n Please state your name and occupation.\n\n\nInterviewee:\n E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, employed at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Construction.

We pretty much ruled out undermining for some reason. Something to do [DATA EXPUNGED]. Main thing is management decides to just use a couple of bulldozers to level the thing.\n\n\nDr. Spinoza:\n Was there any action on the part of the building before you attempted demolition?\n\n\nR\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Not really. We went in there, after all, making tests and all that. Found the mold, joked about all that paper all over the place. Only thing that really happened before we started was\u2026yeah, when we were in the basement and someone else, I forget who, started ripping pages from the wall, just t'check how bad the mold was. Big stack of the stuff suddenly drops from the ceiling, outta nowhere, on top of the guy, and he gets a nice bunch of paper cuts. Thing that got us, though? His gear was all cut up as all hell. I mean, clothing, hat, glasses, what have you. All nicked up, had a big damn gouge in his glasses. Damn good thing he was wearing those glasses, I tell you.\n\n\nDr. Spinoza:\n And then?\n\n\nR\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Well, we didn't like being in a big house of knives, you know, so we got him out of there. Other than that, besides, well, you know, and nothing else happened.\n\n\nDr. Spinoza:\n And on May 4?\n\n\nR\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Well, we had everything set up, and started driving a pair of bulldozers toward the house, when all of a sudden all that paper on that one wall - outside, right? - well, it all just falls off by itself. Now, I should tell you, that day there wasn't a breeze in the air at all, so we thought that, well, the building's destroyin' itself and stuff, and we decide to help it along, and all of a sudden there's a big rumble - one you can hear over the bulldozers! - and all that paper flies into the air by itself and tears up everything in sight!\n\n\n[END OF INTERVIEW REDACTED]\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nDocument 211-02\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent to Incident Zero, testing was taken to determine the responsiveness of SCP-211.
