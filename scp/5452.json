Personnel with clearance level 2 or higher can experiment with SCP-5452 if permitted by the Head for Research of SCP-5452, Dr. Ivanna Novakova.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5452 is a Dating Simulator video game simply called \"LOVER\", produced by GoI-078 (\"\nArcadia\n\") where the player interacts with the game's characters, collectively designated as SCP-5452-2, in an attempt to engage romantically with one of them.\n\n\nThe game is contained on a series of files in a USB flash drive designated SCP-5452-1 which cannot be extracted, copied, or reproduced. SCP-5452 was programmed in Pavon, an anomalous programming language that uses thaumic methods to create metafictional entities. The object can only be played by one person at any time. All attempts to include other subjects that are not the main player will cause the game to terminate itself until the main player is alone. A new player can play the game only if the previous one completes the plot by marrying one of the SCP-5452-2 instances. The following log was recovered from a text file named README.txt inside one of SCP-5452-1's folders and describes SCP-5452\u2019s rules:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Game\u00a0Mechanics\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Game\u00a0Mechanics\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to our community! We call ourselves Lovers, the fandom of the LOVER game. As the game doesn\u2019t really have a tutorial, I managed to create this \"ReadMe\" text with all the mechanics.\n\n\n\n\nYou can walk to different locations or stay in your room.\n\n\nThere are five locations on the game map: the School, the Park, the Museum, the Church, and the Alley.\n\n\nEvery location has three options: Work, Buy, or Interact.\n\n\n\nWork: makes the player earn money to buy gifts.\n\n\nBuy: spend money buying a gift. Every place has different gifts and every character likes or dislikes specific items, so beware!\n\n\nInteract: makes the player interact with a character nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction options include Talk, Gift, Date, and Greet.\n\n\n\nTalk: a short conversation, sometimes letting you choose between lines.\n\n\nGift: uses one of the items earned at a vending machine to offer to the character.\n\n\nDate: only available if the person has an amity level above 50%. Gives the option to take the character on a date. Dates are match-three puzzles, similar to Candy Crush. Some gifts can give bonuses here.\n\n\nGreet: gives a hug or a kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the character, each interaction can increase or decrease the amity level.\n\n\nThe game will conclude when the amity level with a character gets to 100%. The Greet interaction will be changed to Marry and will end the game.\n\n\n\n\nI wish you luck with the game! Also: Eva\u2019s ending was prohibited by the PC Bang owner, so don\u2019t try to get it or you\u2019ll be banned!\n\n~Lovefool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Game\u00a0Mechanics\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452-2 are five sapient and sentient ANIMA entities\n1\n that the player can interact with. SCP-5452-2 also present metafictional characteristics such as:\n\n\n\n\nRetaining memories from previous playthroughs\n\n\nAbility to adapt and learn of its environment outside of the game, even in the absence of the appropriate programming\n\n\nReacting to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli\n\n\nRecognize themself as characters in a game\n\n\nInteracting with other instances even when off-screen\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452-2 has also demonstrated telepathy,\n2\n psychometry,\n3\n empathy,\n4\n and technopathy.\n5\n The range of these powers is to be determined, but from recent experiments, it appears that most of them solely affect the player. Added below are the specifications of the individual SCP-5452-2 instances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452-L\n\n\nSCP-5452-O\n\n\nSCP-5452-V\n\n\nSCP-5452-E\n\n\nSCP-5452-R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Levin\n\n\nFile:\n L.anm\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n Levin is a half-demon boy and motorcyclist. Leader of Satan\u2019s Boys Motorcycle Club, he is secretly a cutie pie that is waiting for the right person to show his true colors.\n\n\nFavorite Location:\n The Alley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Orion\n\n\nFile:\n O.anm\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n Orion is a cyborg that came from the future. A lone wolf, the android boy doesn't show the need for a company but also hates to be alone. He just needs a little push to accept someone and become their significant one.\n\n\nFavorite Location:\n The Museum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Vivi\n\n\nFile:\n V.anm\n\n\nColor:\n Yellow\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n A silly cat girl that you discovered at the park. Playful and gentle, she acts more like a dog than like a cat. This compassionate cutie just wants a lair and someone to hug. Maybe you can be their significant other!\n\n\nFavorite Location:\n The Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Eva\n\n\nFile:\n E.anm\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n This shy and insecure girl is your classmate and your old childhood friend that mysteriously turned away from you. Now you know that she did that because she discovered that she is an esper. You\u2019re certain that a little bit of love will take her out of her box and turn her into the strong and powerful girl that she is.\n\n\nFavorite Location:\n The School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Ramiel\n\n\nFile:\n R.anm\n\n\nColor:\n Pink\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n A strange angel that fell from heaven, Ramiel is trying to recover their wings and their place in their world. The easiest and quickest way to do that is loving someone. Ramiel can be a difficult being to deal with, but their love is pure and eternal.\n\n\nFavorite Location:\n The Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game also presents a plot. The protagonist, who is always named after the player without any naming input, is a high school student that is returning from school with the SCP-5452-E. The entity claims that it is an esper and it received a vision that five entities are lost in this world and they need to be saved by the protagonist. As the game itself is very confused due to the metafictional interference of the five ANIMA entities, the story tends to change radically through different playthroughs.\n\n\nAddendum 5452.1:\n Discovery and first analysis\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5452 was discovered inside Unexplained Location, a South Korean LAN gaming center sponsored by \nArcadia\n. The place was designated UE-71135\n6\n after it was identified as a minor Nexus for electronic game anomalies, including copies of objects already known and contained by the Foundation. In January of 2023, the business was bought and closed by the Foundation.\n\n\nAfter initial testing, the flash drive was considered a secondary object, as the principal anomaly was the game itself. The flash drive has since been designated as anomalous as it is the only storage item capable of hosting SCP-5452.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Data\u00a0Log\u00a0#1\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Data\u00a0Log\u00a0#1\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATA LOG #1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452 was investigated by a group of six experienced researchers from the Division of Anomalous Programming, a subdivision of the IT Department. Unusually for \nArcadia\n, SCP-5452 uses the Pavon programming language instead of ICRDTA.\n7\n. Pavon is famous for its metafictional properties, allowing the creation of characters that are sentient and sapient. Another example of Pavon use is \nSCP-5094\n, a hybrid metafictional and technological entity used for childrens' education.\n\nThe key part of Pavon\u2019s Artificial Intelligence creation is the formulation of \".anm\" files. The AIs, designated ANIMA\n8\n entities, are capable of interacting with the user even if the computer has no microphone and/or camera. Their essence is more thaumaturgical than technological, thus being identified as something between an AI and a Homunculus.\n9\n\nMost of the actual game's code is protected under heavy technothaumic seals, internal firewalls full of thaumic energy that prevent us from accessing the code. However, even if the seals were opened, Pavon is new to the Foundation, despite being created in the 1990s, as the first time the Foundation could investigate a Pavon-based entity was in 2022, when the Foundation gained custody of the aforementioned SCP-5094. Little is known about its semantics, and Pavon keeps receiving regular updates that modify its syntax.\n\nIt was possible to identify five .anm files, which were collectively named SCP-5452-2. They present a thaumic and ontokinectic instability that, by the Metafiction Division of the Department of Film and Media, is common to this type of object.\n\nNo more relevant data was found.\n\n\nDr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTES:\n Diderot.aic, a new operative of the MTF Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") and only Artificially Intelligent Conscript capable of metafictional immersion, was appointed to be an assistant and guard of SCP-5452. He will be introduced to the team tomorrow.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5452.2:\n Gameplay Experiments\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Iteration\u00a05452/1,\u00a0/2,\u00a0/3,\u00a0/4\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Iteration\u00a05452/1,\u00a0/2,\u00a0/3,\u00a0/4\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 5452/1 Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountable:\n Dr. Ivanna Novakova.\n\nSubject:\n D-122122\n\n\nProcedure:\n The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.\n\n\nResults:\n D-122122 \"married\" SCP-5452-V after five hours and five minutes of gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n\nAt 5 minutes and 27 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-V praised D-122122's birthmark, a spot on the subject's right cheek. This was the first sign of metafictional attributes within SCP-5452.\n\n\nAt 1 hour, 25 minutes and 38 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-E said that D-122122 was making a mistake by ignoring SCP-5452-R. When questioned, the entity vanished.\n\n\nAt 3 hours and 53 minutes of gameplay\n, D-122122 went on a date with SCP-5452-V at the Park. During the date, SCP-5452-V said that it knew that D-122122 wanted to be a cat since she was a child. D-122122 confirmed the affirmation.\n\n\nAt 5 hours and 40 seconds of gameplay\n, D-122122 completed 100% amity with SCP-5452-V. It asked D-122122 if she really was wanting to end the game.\n\n\nAt 5 hours and 5 minutes\n, the marriage scene ended. The computer turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 5452/2 Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountable:\n Dr. Ivanna Novakova.\n\nSubject:\n D-135114\n\n\nProcedure:\n The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.\n\n\nResults:\n D-135114 \"married\" SCP-5452-R after five hours, twenty-five minutes, and three seconds of gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n\nAt 1 minute of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-R invaded a dialogue between SCP-5452-E and the player that was seen in the first iteration. SCP-5452-R claimed that the previous player had not given attention to \"her\".\n\n\nAt 3 hours, 30 minutes and 23 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-E refused to talk with the player. When D-135114 insisted, it forced him back to the initial menu screen. SCP-5452-E disappeared from the game after that. Its files are not damaged.\n\n\nAt 5 hours, 25 minutes, and 3 seconds of gameplay\n, D-135114 finally got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R. As the game ended, the screen flashed pink before the computer turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 5452/3 Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountable:\n Dr. Ivanna Novakova\n\nSubject:\n D-19260\n\n\nProcedure:\n The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.\n\n\nResults:\n D-19260 \"married\" SCP-5452-R after six hours and thirty-three seconds of gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n\nAt 20 minutes and 54 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-L complained about an odor. It was later discovered that the scent was from a Junior Researcher\u2019s perfume. The researcher was prohibited from using the perfume again during sessions of experimentation.\n\n\nAt 2 hours, 44 minutes, and 41 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-O refused a gift, saying that it was disgusted by D-192600\u2019s appearance.\n\n\nAt 4 hour, 33 minutes and 24 seconds of gameplay\n, D-135114 tried to take SCP-5452-V to a date. When the date started, SCP-5452-R was in the other entity\u2019s place. When questioned about this, SCP-5452-R said that SCP-5452-V \"had its chance\". SCP-5452-V was not seen again.\n\n\nAt 6 hours and 33 seconds of gameplay\n, D-192600 got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R, ending the game. The computer turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 5452/4 Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountable:\n Dr. Ivanna Novakova\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Ivanna Novakova\n\n\nProcedure:\n The subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.\n\n\nResults:\n The iteration was paused because of a factor within SCP-5452. A new approach is to be established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n\nAt 10 minutes and 44 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-L complained about Dr. Novakova\u2019s physical appearance and stated that the previous player had \"better looks\".\n\n\nAt 2 hours, 25 minutes, and 34 seconds of gameplay\n, the experiment was interrupted by a containment breach. When the experiment was resumed three days later, SCP-5452-R complained about the temporary disappearance of Dr. Novakova.\n\n\nAt 3 hours and 55 seconds of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-E was found. It said that SCP-5452-R always got irritated when it wasn't chosen and advised D-135114 to focus on SCP-5452-R, so the game would end fast.\n\n\nAt 4 hours and 21 minutes of gameplay\n, SCP-5452-E cried after perceiving that Dr. Novakova was trying to get its ending. SCP-5452-L and SCP-5452-O invaded the dialogue and the three argued. During the altercation, SCP-5452-O decided to turn off the computer to talk \"in private\". A log of the event is present in the Incident 5452.1 Log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n After the events, SCP-5452-E is complying neither with other SCP-5452-2 instances nor the research team.

Reclassification from Safe for Euclid is pending after the incidents. SCP-5452-R's outburst was completely unpredictable. Theories from the research team point out that Diderot\u2019s intermission within the object caused changes in the SCP-5452-2 entities.\n\nThis theory was confirmed after analyzing the corrupted files. E.anm\u2019s thaumic firewall was broken due to corruption and we could study the Pavon ANIMA code for the first time. It seems that the code was affected by the presence of the AIC entity, most precisely its Personality Drive, the unique model PATHOS/5. As Diderot is the only one capable of Metafictional Immersion, it is the only AIC to have this specific Personality Drive that permits an understanding of narratives, including emotional ones.\n\nSummarizing it, Diderot.aic infected SCP-5452 with a feeling surplus that caused their autocontrol to overflow. Every time the game is reset, this glitch grows as the Personality Drive is absorbed more. The AIC entity is still immersed in the game and no contact with it was possible.\n\n\nDr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTES:\n I hope we can recover Diderot.aic.

SCP-5452-R seemingly can control both entities.\n\n\nAmity percentages are not increasing with any character, except SCP-5452-R.\n Even so, the option \"Marry\" is not appearing after getting 100% amity with SCP-5452-R.

The current amity with SCP-5452-R is 126%.\n\n\nThe only gifts that can be bought are SCP-5452-R favorite presents.\n This includes the items Rose Quartz Ring, Fairy Flower, Delicate Perfume, Holy Water, and Glittering Champagne.\n\n\nNo signal of Diderot.aic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a05452.2\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Incident\u00a05452.2\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 5452.2 Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n The event happened after SCP-5452-R decided to delete the options \"Talk\" and \"Gift\" from the other SCP-5452-2.

I still feel that the object is full of potential to understand Pavon language and how its metafictional components react when constructing a society. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t see the danger in using Diderot.aic at SCP-5452 and now we are dealing with its autodestruction.\n\n\nI\u2019m sending you some proposals to be sent to higher administration. Those are ideas to save the object and try to recover it to its original state. I hope that you can at least choose one of these documents and try to get permission to initiate the procedures.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nDr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Researcher Ivanna Novakova\n\n\nFrom:\n Site Director Orlando Acosta\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:SCP-5452 Neutralization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Novakova,\n\n\nI hate bringing bad news, but you need to know what is happening. All your proposals were denied by the Overseers as they were seen as too dangerous or too expensive. The imminent termination of the SCP-5452 by itself was seen as necessary for its study.\n\n\nThe good news is that when SCP-5452 changes classification you\u2019ll be reassigned to be Head of Research for another object. Your work was seen as superb by most of your superiors, so you don\u2019t need to be afraid of retaliation due to what is happening to your current object.\n\n\nTalking to you as a friend, you should enjoy your two weeks break after SCP-5452 reclassification to clean your head. Your proposals proved to me that you are overworking with this object.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDoctor Orlando Acosta, Site Director, Site-15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Updates are pending.

A list of updates was created by Dr. Novakova and is disponible below.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452 is to be reclassified as Euclid and its Risk Class to be changed to Caution.\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures are to be changed as follows:\n\n\n\nSCP-5452 is to be contained in a designed computer in Room 5452 at Site-15. This computer is not to be connected to any communication device in any circumstance. SCP-5452 is to be revised weekly by authorized personnel for inspection of the psychological and social behavior of the SCP-5452-1 instances.\n\n\nThe research team was advised to watch for any behavior mirroring the acts of SCP-5452-R. Any presentation of emotion between SCP-5452-1 and any of the researchers is to be dealt with. The Metafiction Division is working with Site-15's psychologist to create a schedule to handle the entities\u2019 emotional side, but the procedures are yet to be approved by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nIn the case of any notable alteration, the Research Team shall contact Site-15\u2019s Psychologist. Other authorities are to be contacted only after the psychotechnic evaluation of the SCP-5452-1 entities. If this is necessary, the DIDEROT Protocol will be immediately initiated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription will suffer major modification:\n\n\n\nThe USB flash drive previously designated SCP-5452-1 was neutralized now that, without SCP-5452-R, it\u2019s no longer the only device that can contain SCP-5452 files. SCP-5452-2 specimens were redesignated SCP-5452-1 for consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new SCP-5452-1 object is to be added to the SCP-5452-1 descriptions. Its sheet can be seen in the attachments below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the neutralization of both the flash drive and SCP-5452-R, descriptions and explanations about the entities are to be added as an addendum and deleted from the main description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game name was changed to \u201cLOVED\u201d, so both the object designation and mentions to the previous name, \u201cLOVER\u201d, are to be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew description about the SCP-5452-1 entities may include:\n\n\n\nTheir lack of memory from their existence before the Reboot or about SCP-5452-R.\n\n\nThat their power over the game was shared equally between the specimens during the Reboot, so there is no leader figure anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached File #2 is to be added to a new addendum.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAttachments:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0SCP-5452-D\u00a0Character\u00a0Sheet\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0SCP-5452-D\u00a0Character\u00a0Sheet\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5452-D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Name:\n Daniel\n\n\nFile:\n D.anm\n\n\nColor:\n Orange\n\n\nIn-Game Description:\n A strange angel that fell from heaven, Daniel is the guardian angel of the protagonist, always trying to protect them.

I decided that I should undo what I\u2019ve created inside SCP-5452, so I hacked into the game and I am trying to fix it. The procedure is simple: I will become part of the game and will mix my files with SCP-5452-R\u2019s files to become a new entity. I\u2019ll temporarily maintain my conscience while doing so, but I'll lose all my memories and personality when the game reboots. I know you\u2019re smart enough to understand the minutiae of what I\u2019ll be doing, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m sending this to you.\n\n\nAs I studied SCP-5452 with you I felt the need to understand Love. You see, every SCP-5452-2 entity has their vision about Love: E\u2019s Love is needy, it needs company, needs attention, needs contact. R\u2019s Love is dominant, is all about control, about having the person for yourself and yourself only. V\u2019s Love is about sacrifice and confidence. O and L\u2019s Love is greedy and narcissistic, focused on themselves more than on the others. I was confused about that and I need to understand it.\n\n\nSo I decided to do this, become part of the game.

        "Welcome to our community! We call ourselves Lovers, the fandom of the LOVER game. As the game doesn\u2019t really have a tutorial, I managed to create this \"ReadMe\" text with all the mechanics. You can walk to different locations or stay in your room. There are five locations on the game map: the School, the Park, the Museum, the Church, and the Alley. Every location has three options: Work, Buy, or Interact. Work: makes the player earn money to buy gifts. Buy: spend money buying a gift. Every place has different gifts and every character likes or dislikes specific items, so beware! Interact: makes the player interact with a character nearby. Interaction options include Talk, Gift, Date, and Greet. Talk: a short conversation, sometimes letting you choose between lines. Gift: uses one of the items earned at a vending machine to offer to the character. Date: only available if the person has an amity level above 50%. Gives the option to take the character on a date. Dates are match-three puzzles, similar to Candy Crush. Some gifts can give bonuses here. Greet: gives a hug or a kiss. Depending on the character, each interaction can increase or decrease the amity level. The game will conclude when the amity level with a character gets to 100%. The Greet interaction will be changed to Marry and will end the game. I wish you luck with the game! Also: Eva\u2019s ending was prohibited by the PC Bang owner, so don\u2019t try to get it or you\u2019ll be banned! ~Lovefool",
        "SCP-5452 was investigated by a group of six experienced researchers from the Division of Anomalous Programming, a subdivision of the IT Department. Unusually for Arcadia , SCP-5452 uses the Pavon programming language instead of ICRDTA. 7 . Pavon is famous for its metafictional properties, allowing the creation of characters that are sentient and sapient. Another example of Pavon use is SCP-5094 , a hybrid metafictional and technological entity used for childrens' education. The key part of Pavon\u2019s Artificial Intelligence creation is the formulation of \".anm\" files. The AIs, designated ANIMA 8 entities, are capable of interacting with the user even if the computer has no microphone and/or camera. Their essence is more thaumaturgical than technological, thus being identified as something between an AI and a Homunculus. 9 Most of the actual game's code is protected under heavy technothaumic seals, internal firewalls full of thaumic energy that prevent us from accessing the code. However, even if the seals were opened, Pavon is new to the Foundation, despite being created in the 1990s, as the first time the Foundation could investigate a Pavon-based entity was in 2022, when the Foundation gained custody of the aforementioned SCP-5094. Little is known about its semantics, and Pavon keeps receiving regular updates that modify its syntax. It was possible to identify five .anm files, which were collectively named SCP-5452-2. They present a thaumic and ontokinectic instability that, by the Metafiction Division of the Department of Film and Media, is common to this type of object. No more relevant data was found. Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15",
        "Highlights: At 5 minutes and 27 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-V praised D-122122's birthmark, a spot on the subject's right cheek. This was the first sign of metafictional attributes within SCP-5452. At 1 hour, 25 minutes and 38 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-E said that D-122122 was making a mistake by ignoring SCP-5452-R. When questioned, the entity vanished. At 3 hours and 53 minutes of gameplay , D-122122 went on a date with SCP-5452-V at the Park. During the date, SCP-5452-V said that it knew that D-122122 wanted to be a cat since she was a child. D-122122 confirmed the affirmation. At 5 hours and 40 seconds of gameplay , D-122122 completed 100% amity with SCP-5452-V. It asked D-122122 if she really was wanting to end the game. At 5 hours and 5 minutes , the marriage scene ended. The computer turned off.",
        "Highlights: At 1 minute of gameplay , SCP-5452-R invaded a dialogue between SCP-5452-E and the player that was seen in the first iteration. SCP-5452-R claimed that the previous player had not given attention to \"her\". At 3 hours, 30 minutes and 23 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-E refused to talk with the player. When D-135114 insisted, it forced him back to the initial menu screen. SCP-5452-E disappeared from the game after that. Its files are not damaged. At 5 hours, 25 minutes, and 3 seconds of gameplay , D-135114 finally got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R. As the game ended, the screen flashed pink before the computer turned off.",
        "Highlights: At 20 minutes and 54 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-L complained about an odor. It was later discovered that the scent was from a Junior Researcher\u2019s perfume. The researcher was prohibited from using the perfume again during sessions of experimentation. At 2 hours, 44 minutes, and 41 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-O refused a gift, saying that it was disgusted by D-192600\u2019s appearance. At 4 hour, 33 minutes and 24 seconds of gameplay , D-135114 tried to take SCP-5452-V to a date. When the date started, SCP-5452-R was in the other entity\u2019s place. When questioned about this, SCP-5452-R said that SCP-5452-V \"had its chance\". SCP-5452-V was not seen again. At 6 hours and 33 seconds of gameplay , D-192600 got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R, ending the game. The computer turned off.",
        "Highlights: At 10 minutes and 44 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-L complained about Dr. Novakova\u2019s physical appearance and stated that the previous player had \"better looks\". At 2 hours, 25 minutes, and 34 seconds of gameplay , the experiment was interrupted by a containment breach. When the experiment was resumed three days later, SCP-5452-R complained about the temporary disappearance of Dr. Novakova. At 3 hours and 55 seconds of gameplay , SCP-5452-E was found. It said that SCP-5452-R always got irritated when it wasn't chosen and advised D-135114 to focus on SCP-5452-R, so the game would end fast. At 4 hours and 21 minutes of gameplay , SCP-5452-E cried after perceiving that Dr. Novakova was trying to get its ending. SCP-5452-L and SCP-5452-O invaded the dialogue and the three argued. During the altercation, SCP-5452-O decided to turn off the computer to talk \"in private\". A log of the event is present in the Incident 5452.1 Log.",
        "Diderot.aic just returned from SCP-5452. As he described, the environment within SCP-5452 is indeed metafictional and not a simulspace. The presence of SCP-5452-R is always felt. Its powers, however, are not just metafictional as we thought. Every SCP-5452-2 exists as both a metafictional and a virtual being. SCP-5452-R is using its dominance to force us to follow its demands. At least, after Diderot\u2019s visit, the games opened, but the \"Play\" option was changed to a \"Marry Vivi\" option. They are forcing us to end and reset the game. A meeting with the entire research team is scheduled to decide if we should adhere to SCP-5452-R\u2019s desires or if we should go against them. Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15",
        "SCP-5452-E and SCP-5452-V are to be considered neutralized after the event from Iteration 5452/5. Reclassification from Safe for Euclid is pending after the incidents. SCP-5452-R's outburst was completely unpredictable. Theories from the research team point out that Diderot\u2019s intermission within the object caused changes in the SCP-5452-2 entities. This theory was confirmed after analyzing the corrupted files. E.anm\u2019s thaumic firewall was broken due to corruption and we could study the Pavon ANIMA code for the first time. It seems that the code was affected by the presence of the AIC entity, most precisely its Personality Drive, the unique model PATHOS/5. As Diderot is the only one capable of Metafictional Immersion, it is the only AIC to have this specific Personality Drive that permits an understanding of narratives, including emotional ones. Summarizing it, Diderot.aic infected SCP-5452 with a feeling surplus that caused their autocontrol to overflow. Every time the game is reset, this glitch grows as the Personality Drive is absorbed more. The AIC entity is still immersed in the game and no contact with it was possible. Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15",
        "Notes: SCP-5452-L and SCP-5452-O are not corrupted but are acting in unusual ways. As SCP-5452-R are more strict now, both are trying to keep their fa\u00e7ade as long as possible. SCP-5452-R reconstructed the metafictional ambient within SCP-5452 to better control it. The church that was located at the northeast of the city is now in the middle of the map, as it became the center of everything. Even if corrupted, SCP-5452-V and SCP-5452-E are still in the game. Both are glitching and their speaking texts present bugs and illegible phrases. SCP-5452-R seemingly can control both entities. Amity percentages are not increasing with any character, except SCP-5452-R. Even so, the option \"Marry\" is not appearing after getting 100% amity with SCP-5452-R. The only thing that is left to do is increasing the amity more and more. The current amity with SCP-5452-R is 126%. The only gifts that can be bought are SCP-5452-R favorite presents. This includes the items Rose Quartz Ring, Fairy Flower, Delicate Perfume, Holy Water, and Glittering Champagne. No signal of Diderot.aic.",
