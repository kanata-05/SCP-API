On a bed at center stage sits our hero, \nSIR RICHARD GLOSTER\n, sitting forlornly and addressing the audience:\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n Here again I sit, here again you read.\n\nAs long as you read, I\u2019ll sit, but longer\n\nthan that I cannot stand, nor indeed can\n\nI sit. For you see, kind reader, that one\n\ncannot sit, or stand for that matter, if\n\none cannot be. And so one, this one, in\n\nparticular, cannot be if one is\n\nnot read. My life is bound to this page here,\n\nI am not so much blood and bone and flesh\n\nas I am ink, and paper, and story.\n\n\nHe turns, now speaking to himself more than the audience.\n\n\nIt was not always so. No, once I was\n\nmortal. A playwright, even! Though not a\n\nvery good one, I\u2019m afraid. \u201cSo clumsy!\n\nSo dreadfully long winded! So pompous!\u201d\n\nNone of my work was ever desired,\n\nnone of it lasted longer than a week!\n\nDozens of plays I published, and not one\n\nsingle word was remembered longer than\n\na single pitiful fleeting fortnight.\n\n\nOne night I could not take it any more.\n\nMy razor I from my dresser grabb\u00e8d,\n\nand opened my left wrist, with my closed right,\n\nthat writing right which now wrote \u201cFIN\u201d in great\n\nred letters, upon my walls and clothing.\n\n\nI prayed, to every god and spirit\n\nand being I knew. I prayed that I be\n\nforgotten, purg\u00e8d from the whole wide world.\n\nThat if ever again my name be heard,\n\nit be as the author of some great art,\n\nimmortalized by my work, found sadly\n\nafter my departure from this cruel coil.\n\nIn hindsight perhaps I should have chosen\n\nmy words more carefully, or perhaps not\n\nhave said any at all, said not a word.\n\nOr indeed, should not have written any.\n\n\nHe turns back to the crowd, speaking clearly to the audience.\n\n\nAnd so here I am. The cell you\u2019ve put me\n\nin sits empty, aside from this lone tome.\n\n\nHe gestures to a bookcase, containing a single volume.\n\n\nThis is my life and times, the tragedy\n\nof me. All that I am and ere shall be,\n\nall my self contained within these pages.\n\nI do not breathe, yet you convince yourselves\n\nI speak to you. I cannot move, save for\n\nas describ\u00e8d in stage direction, yet\n\nyou are determin\u00e8d to transport me\n\nand address me as if I stand in front\n\nof you. Even as you try to catalogue\n\nme as a specimen or experiment,\n\nyou cannot help but write poems\n\nand flowery prose where you mean to scribe\n\ncold, unfeeling fact. My words flow and change\n\nthrough each reader, but my existence holds\n\nstatic. Cold and cruel. All my world's a stage.\n\n\nFade to black.\n\n\nACT ONE, SCENE TWO, Interview\n\nLights come up on an interview room. On one side of the table sits \nGLOSTER\n, opposite him sits \nSENIOR RESEARCHER MARLOWE:\n\n\nMARLOWE:\n Good afternoon, Richard.\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n Good morrow, good Doctor. What brings you here?\n\n\nMARLOWE:\n I have a few more questions for you, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n But of course! Though I find minding is not\n\ndone by one whom in mind can only be.\n\n\nMARLOWE:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n Nothing, Doctor. Carry on, if you will.\n\n\nMARLOWE:\n Right. As you know, we\u2019re still puzzled as to where you\u2019ve come from. Or \nwhen\n. As far as we can tell, you just turned up in one of our libraries a few weeks ago. Even more puzzling is your demeanor. You act and dress like a 16th-century nobleman, but your vocabulary is decidedly modern, albeit with a faux-Elizabethan affectation, and your dental work can\u2019t possibly have been done earlier than 1970. Where are you from? A straight answer this time, please.\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n Well how can I answer such a question!\n\nWas I born at the time and place of Sir\n\nRichard Gloster? Or minutes ago at\n\nyour desk as you began transcribing this\n\nexchange? Or was I born here and now, at\n\nyour screen, as you now read this document?\n\n\nMARLOWE:\n What? Who are you taking to? I don\u2019t understand.\n\n\nGLOSTER:\n Nor will you ever, I\u2019m afraid. Art cannot\n\npossibly be apprehended by\n\nthose who are not artists. Close the book, good\n\nDoctor. Forget me for the time being.\n\n\nMARLOWE\n begins to ask further questions, and \nGLOSTER\n answers, but the pair cannot be heard by the audience. The two continue the interview as the lights begin slowly dimming. Just before the stage is totally dark, \nGLOSTER\n faces the audience and bows slightly\n\n\nEPILOGUE, O5 Soliloquy\n\n\nA new character, \nO5-8\n walks into spotlight and addresses the audience\n\n\nO5-8:\n If you are seeing this, then you may be beginning to grasp the nature of SCP-2763. At the moment, we're not sure how much control the entity has over what events are depicted in copies of \nA Play Written\n, but the text is clearly altered to reflect recent events, as evidenced by the fact that newer transcriptions are instead titled \nThe Tragedy of SCP-2763, A Modern Euclid Tale\n. At the moment, the O5 council has determined that all written record of SCP-2763 be sealed, and all copies of \nA Play Written\n in Foundation custody be stored in the Restricted Printed Memetics Library of Site-63.\n\nBut bear it to that chamber; there he'll lie\n\nin that far archive shall Sir Richard die.\n\n\nHe smirks to himself as the stage goes black. Curtain close.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2762\n | SCP-2763 | \nSCP-2764\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2763\n\" by Dr Solo, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
