Testing of SCP-5307 is permitted with approval from personnel Clearance Level 3 or higher.\n\n\nFoundation webcrawler Y8U7 is to monitor social media, police records, and hospital admittance files for any mention of hallucinogenic vape cartridges or \"Donk Juice\". Mobile Task Force Epsilon-17 (\"Bodega Busters\") are to respond to any reports of SCP-5307 to confiscate and conceal all evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5307 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5307 is an olfactohazard found within an oil designed for a personal vaporizer. The containers are labeled as \"Donk Juice, The Juice You Jam To\" and are found at convenience stores across the Southern United States. SCP-5307 is marketed as a flavored CBD musical mood enhancer distributed by Western Wilds, LLC.\n\n\nUpon olfaction of SCP-5307, a neurological event occurs causing altered audio and visual perception. Subjects exposed to SCP-5307 will internally visualize a music video featuring a humanoid donkey resembling \nSCP-4768\n; songs observed appear to be parodies of popular songs released between 1970 and 2010. The duration of the event varies based on the length of the parodied song, typically 2-6 minutes. The affected individual will only vaguely recall the exact contents of the SCP-5307 event, though will remember the basic themes and structure of the song. SCP-5307 has no known negative effects on exposed subjects.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0SCP-5307\u00a0Test\u00a0Summary\u00a0\u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0SCP-5307\u00a0Test\u00a0Summary\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavor\n\n\nSong Title\n\n\nEffects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCherokee Cherry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY.M.C.DONK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject reports the song to be uplifting and energizing. \"Something you could really workout to.\" D-05589\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi Mango\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight Outta Donkton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe song is claimed to be \"hard hitting\" and \"edgy\". \"I could really fuck someone to this, a real throwdown.\" D-04567.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiller Coconut\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Killer's Queen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSong is noted as \"sad\" and \"nostalgic\".

All instances of SCP-5307 were traced to convenience store franchise \"1-Stop\". At this time, MTF Epsilon-17 was dispatched to handle the situation, with MTF Kappa-12 providing auxiliary support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation\n\n\nThe \"1-Stop\" franchise cooperated fully during the SCP-5307 investigation, willingly providing their entire supply of SCP-5307 and all known information on its origin. The \"1-Stop\" franchise records indicate that they purchased its supply of SCP-5307 from a company known as Western Wilds, LLC, a limited liability company based in Delaware, USA. While the filing records indicate the owner of the license to be Harold Thompson, the address given for the agent of record does not exist.\n\n\nAs of the filing of this record, no known address exists for Mr. Thompson or Western Wilds, LLC. A nation-wide search for a known address yielded a divorce case filed in the state of Texas, indicating that Mr. Thompson is divorced and gave a legitimate address for his ex-wife, Carolyn McLean.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-5307/A\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-5307/A\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2016/07/18\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Eric Sonder\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Carolyn McLean\n\n\nForeword:\n Carolyn McLean is being interviewed regarding her knowledge of POI-5307W and Western Wilds, LLC.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n Okay Mrs. Th\u2013\n\n\nMcLean:\n Miss, it's Ms. McLean.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n Of course, \nMs. McLean\n, are you ready to begin?\n\n\nMcLean:\n Yes, but you need to make this quick. I need to pick my son up from practice and God knows I've wasted enough time on Harry.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n I'd like to discuss Mr. Thompson's business.\n\n\nMcLean:\n \n[Ms. McLean snorts.]\n Of course, 10 years wasn't enough\u2013 now I've gotta' listen to more of this bullshit.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n I'm sor\u2013\n\n\nMcLean:\n Listen, my ex-husband was pretty great when we met, he was an outgoing entrepreneur. But after his father passed, something changed. He became obsessed with those\u2013 those donkey men.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n You're referring to Ulysses B. Donkman?\n\n\nMcLean:\n Yeah sure, whatever you want to call it. Those \nthings\n ruined my marriage. Harry went on and on about how his family didn't understand the damn things, how there was \n\"a fortune to be made\"\n.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n You speak as if there is more than one?\n1\n\n\nMcLean:\n I don't know much\u2013 but I know there are two of them.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n Alright, and Mr. Thompson's family has a connection to these \"donkey-men\"?\n\n\nMcLean:\n Obsession is more like it. As Harry told it, his father, grandfather, and great grandfather \nall tried to kill one of the damned things\n. But not Harry, he thinks he can make money off of it.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n So he is working with the entities?\n\n\nMcLean:\n \n\"Entities\"\n, you make it sound like this isn't all fantasy bullshit. No, of course he's not working with the \n\"entities\"\n, him and his little club are trying to capture them or something. You should've seen his office, it had newspaper clippings and photos pinned to the wall with strings. Like some sort of serial killer collage.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n So he created Western Wilds in an attempt to capture and exploit the entities?\n\n\nMcLean:\n Listen, I get you have a job to do, but I really don't know much else. Once Harry started trying to get our son involved, I had to get out and away from all of it. I'm just trying to put the whole thing behind me, okay?\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n I understand, do you have any of your ex-husband's material here?\n\n\nMcLean:\n I have a box with a few of his things, I burned the rest. You're more than welcome to take it with you.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n Okay Ms. McLean, we're just about finished here. I have to ask again for the record, do you have any idea of your ex-husband's whereabouts, or anything else to do with his company?\n\n\nMcLean:\n No, like I told you\u2013 I haven't spoken to him in years.\n\n\nAgent Sonder:\n Thank you, Ms. McLean.
