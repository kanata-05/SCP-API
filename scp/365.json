SCP-365 must be kept away from any body of water except for testing purposes.\n SCP-365 is to be kept in its testing pool at all times. The door to the pool is to be locked and guarded by one security guard (see Addendum 365-02). Experiment requests must be approved by a Level-3 researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-365 is a green pool noodle made of polyethylene foam. By itself, it displays no unusual properties and is physically identical to a typical noodle of similar size. SCP-365's unusual properties manifest only when it is placed in a body of water. When a subject completely submerges in said body of water, they become unable to get out.\n\n\nSubjects report a sense of dread, and describe themselves in an infinite sea, swimming endlessly in a direction and finding only more water (see Audio Log 365-03). It is important to note that to outside observers, the subject simply seems to be flailing in place.\n\n\nThe only way to remove a submerged person from the water is to remove SCP-365, negating its effects. All other methods of rescue have failed; cables and ropes have exhibited an unnatural resistance and snapped, drainage systems have failed, and human intervention has led to [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nAddendum 365-01:\n SCP-365 was discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588. Retrieval personnel found it at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Public Pool along with the bodies of \u2588\u2588 civilians. Because SCP-365's properties were unknown at the time, \u2588 agents lost their lives. SCP-365 was eventually found and removed from the pool, and carbon monoxide from an improperly maintained water heater was used as a cover story.\n\n\nAddendum 365-02:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 discovered that Hallway 19 of Storage-Site 23 was flooded. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 noticed water leaking from SCP-365's storage locker at a rate of 5\u00a0L/min. She quickly notified Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who opened the locker to find SCP-365 producing water from its holes. SCP-365 was subsequently moved to its testing pool, whereupon the flow of water stopped. SCP-365's containment procedures have been changed accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-364\n | SCP-365 | \nSCP-366\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-365\n\" by CondorTalon, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
