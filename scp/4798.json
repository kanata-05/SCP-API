The border of this region will be regularly patrolled to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the restricted area. Border patrols are required to be outfitted in BCS Mk. V-class hazmat suits. Site AZ-121 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation satellites and long-range scanners in the event of any expansion of SCP-4798-C. In the event of breach of containment, all instances of SCP-4798-1 (including human individuals affected by the anomaly) are to be eliminated and sterilized before relocation to Site-\u2588\u2588 for processing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4798 is a population of anomalous organisms, primarily flora, which grow in a roughly 0.4km\n2\n region surrounding Shallow Moon Astronomical Observatory (henceforth referred to as Site AZ-121) atop Ginger Mountain in Apache County, Arizona. SCP-4798 entails the collective mutations and anomalous properties of the organisms in this population. Some instances of SCP-4798 appear to be mutations of various organisms native to Arizona, while others are unclassified in any known biological paradigm. Each instance of SCP-4798 demonstrates unique anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-4798 is believed to be a product of transgenic poetry, the anomalous process of using the written word to synthesize nucleotides in DNA. Each instance of SCP-4798 represents an expression of different meanings through anomalous molecular semantics. Based on insights gained from SCP-4798-1 (see Addendum II), a decoding mechanism referred to as DX-64 was employed at Site AZ-121 for the purpose of demonstrating the semantic expression present in the nucleotides of SCP-4798. The molecular coding of any given organism can be translated into coherent semantics, usually in the form of \u201cpoems.\u201d Addendum I contains examples of the semantics of various organisms observed at Site AZ-121.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-4798 have the ability to spread to other biological organisms, though while SCP-4798 is biological in nature, the spread thereof appears to be pseudo-memetic. This has resulted in the mutation of organisms not originally associated with the anomaly, henceforth SCP-4798-1. Human subjects develop biological mutations, often with anomalous properties. Instances of SCP-4798-1 verbally express molecular semantics of similar nature to SCP-4798 proper. Human instances of SCP-4798-1 often demonstrate a heightened understanding of the purported \u201cmeaning\u201d of SCP-4798, often accompanied by abnormal behavior and mental processes. Instances of SCP-4798-1 tend to revert to ordinary biological conditions with time; in humans, this is accompanied by the loss of the intuitive connection to SCP-4798 and its \u201cmeaning,\u201d often accompanied by feelings of absence, sadness, and/or melancholy.\n\n\nFurther research of SCP-4798 has been indefinitely suspended.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0**Addendum\u00a0I:**\u00a0Expressions\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-4798\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of instances of SCP-4798 are flora or pseudo-floral organisms, many of which resemble species native to the region of Site AZ-121. Many also appear to be of other clades. Each instance of SCP-4798 has been observed to be genetically unique, containing anomalous and often incoherent combinations of nucleotides on the molecular level. As a result of insights from SCP-4798-1, the DX-64 decoding algorithm was developed to unravel the complicated \u201cbiological language\u201d of SCP-4798. Each instance of SCP-4798 appears to expresses a different \u201cpoem\u201d of molecular semantics; these are believed to be related to the meanings of the anomaly overall, which in turn correlate with the anomalous properties of the instance of SCP-4798 in question. \nMany of these poems are considered incomplete.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-40196\n\n\nDescription:\n Monocot flowering plant resembling the species \nYucca angustissima\n.\n\n\nAnomalous Properties:\n SCP-4798-40197 manifests a weather anomaly within a 1m\n2\n radius of itself in the form of a 6m/s wind from the northwest. This results in the development of striped patterns in the sand caused by wind and erosion.\n\n\nExpression:\n \nIn this life of lines / I\u2019ve come to find / That I lie outside / And when I sleep / I sigh for you / And when I wake / I die for you / And they will say my cycle / Followed or deviated / In their design / But we both say / That I abandoned the trees / To set us both free\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-21195\n\n\nDescription:\n Unidentified gray-brown shrub.\n\n\nAnomalous Properties:\n The structure SCP-4798-21195 beneath its external cell layer is devoid of any matter whatsoever; the exterior of the organism reacts regularly to gravitational and environmental stimuli, but the interior is a vacuum space lacking gravity and seemingly existing outside of Einsteinian physics. Occasional bursts of microwave radiation have been measured from within SCP-4798-21195.\n\n\nExpression:\n \nWhat we call sacred / Is it what we call stolen? / They said what we know was fed / And what we saw was / Written by the songs of before / But we are not a sum of memories / Because nothing is nothing / And because nothing will tell us how / We don\u2019t obey nothing / No end to sentence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-04151\n\n\nDescription:\n Population of bees, possibly of the genus \nXylocopa\n.\n\n\nAnomalous Properties:\n Instances of SCP-4798-04151 have developed what appears to be a complex movement system seemingly with no benefit to survival or communication. This movement system responds to various seemingly unrelated stimuli. For example, movements become more erratic when SCP-4798-04151 is exposed to radioactive material, but slow significantly in the presence of any object of the color purple.\n\n\nExpression:\n \nShe said she didn\u2019t like sound / So we sang for her / She said she didn\u2019t like softness / So we stole the sun for her / She said she didn\u2019t like snakes / So we shook for her / She said she knew we wouldn\u2019t speak / So we were silent for her / And when she said she\u2019d hide / We exploded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-83865\n\n\nDescription:\n Unidentified lizard species, 4.20cm in length.\n\n\nAnomalous Properties:\n SCP-4798-83865 appears only capable of existing while standing on paper. First observed on the notebooks of on-site researchers, SCP-4798-83865 will manifest on any paper near Site AZ-121. 27 individual instances have been documented.\n\n\nExpression:\n \nHold onto your heart / Because I\u2019m not the sky / I inhabited the spaces they didn\u2019t see / My science of the particular / Songs and pictures you soften / Without anyone there but me / If we\u2019re better off alone / But better off together / Then we live in the little\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-06632\n\n\nDescription:\n Unidentified flowering plant, 20.1cm in length\n\n\nAnomalous Properties:\n SCP-4798-06632 emits radio signals on a wide scale, but which have only been received by a radio station located in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. These signals result in surreal imagery appearing on connected televisions, including abnormal combinations of clips from television programs from the past thirteen years. Investigation of these signals led to the initial discovery of SCP-4798 by Foundation personnel.\n\n\nExpression:\n \nLover you\u2019re not my sibling / Drifting cattle you\u2019re not my foe / All this world I rearranged it / It takes sixteen feet to start / Who will this belong to tomorrow? / Who does it become today? / I was here, that was why I ran away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0**Addendum\u00a0II:**\u00a0SCP-4798-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a series of interrogations of instances of SCP-4798-1 expressed in Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05\n\n\nDate:\n 12 October 2004\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, are you feeling alright?

It\u2019s actually not bad.\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cWhat\u2019s not bad?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cWell, I mean, this. I was scared, but it\u2019s actually somewhat interesting, being an anomaly myself. It kind of makes you wonder what we mean by that. \u2018Anomaly.\u2019 What exactly are we comparing to?\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cPlease try and stay focused, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I need you to tell me\u2026 are you experiencing anything you would consider out of the ordinary? Hallucinations, sensations\u2026 anything like that?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cOh yeah, definitely. It\u2019s very strange, actually \u2013 I can hear everything that\u2019s going on in just one place, in just one city. Istedgade, in Copenhagen. Oh hey! An American tourist! Funny, that makes the world seem so small.\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cSorry, I\u2019m getting distracted. Yeah, anomalous sensations. I would say that is a definite yes. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s that particular street, in that particular city, but at the same time, I kind of feel like\u2026 why not? I make a meaning of that. This whole place is about making meanings.\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cHow can I explain this\u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s a poetry to everything. But it\u2019s not like something scripted. Does that make sense? It\u2019s like everything in this place \u2013 every expression of SCP-4798 \u2013 is singing. The most interesting thing of all is that it\u2019s words becoming things. Poetry expressed through biology.\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cWhat, it\u2019s anart?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cI think you could call it that, yeah. But I couldn\u2019t tell you what it means. I think\u2026 well, I mean, it means something. But that\u2019s not something I can say.\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-05:\n \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think it knows what that meaning is.\u201d\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-12\n\n\nDate:\n 21 November 2004\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cTell me what you mean when you say \u2018expressions.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-12:\n \u201cSo, each of these things \u2013 every one of the organisms on this site \u2013 they\u2019re all a part of a big poem of sorts, though I don\u2019t know who the writer might have been, if there even was one. They pass on these words like offspring, which express themselves as genotypes and phenotypes in the given organisms. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\nResearcher Tannenbaum:\n \u201cSure. It\u2019s not the first anomaly like this that we\u2019ve seen. But what I want to know is the fundamentals of its nature - something of its order, something reproducible and scientific. What is the meaning of SCP-4798?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-4798-1-12:\n \u201cI wish I could say, but I don\u2019t know. Even now, I\u2026 it\u2019s so, so strange.

You won\u2019t be able to type in \u2018bloom\u2019 and get a flower\u2026 all the thoughts intermingle here, but they don\u2019t adhere to anything. It\u2019s not specific and ordered, it\u2019s just\u2026 a feeling in words. Growing, undefined, uncertain.

It\u2019s like I know this all from somewhere. The expression I was given is a reflection of me in this place.

This anomalous expression \nof unknown origin\n affects the nucleotides of given organisms and modifies them into \u201cpoems\u201d with unspecific meanings that nonetheless appear to affect the anomalous properties of the resultant organisms. These poems pass on to other organisms acausally and thus expand the dimensions of expression possessed by SCP-4798. \nThe origins and fundamental nature of SCP-4798 are unknown and possibly unclassifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4798-C\u00a0//\u00a0RESTRICTED\u00a0ACCESS\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-C is a memetic virus which occurs in SCP-4798 and spreads to instances of SCP-4798-1. SCP-4798-C alters the molecular semantics of instances of SCP-4798, resulting in new gene expressions and mutations with often hazardous or violent anomalous effects. Expressions of SCP-4798-C analyzed by DX-64 demonstrate themes of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 lethal impact on biological organisms exposed to SCP-4798-C. This virus has been referred to by instances of SCP-4798-C as \u201cthe Seemingly Endless.\u201d \nIt is believed that SCP-4798-C was somehow introduced to Site AZ-121 by Foundation personnel.\n\n\nHistory:\n The first recorded instance of SCP-4798-C occurred on August 15, 2005, when instances of SCP-4798 developed new anomalous properties with hazardous results. Numerous instances of SCP-4798 became hostile to other life, spreading minor biological viruses or generating lethal anomalous effects. Within weeks, expressions of SCP-4798-C were recognized in human personnel, and emergency containment procedures were implemented. Eventually, after recognizing the threat of SCP-4798-C, Foundation personnel evacuated Site AZ-121 and quarantine protocols were implemented by O5-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum X:\n Instances of SCP-4798-C\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4798-C-06\n\n\nDescription:\n Small desert shrub, previously demonstrated anomalous property 30614 per Site AZ-121 SOTA.

Anomalous Properties: The structure SCP-4798-21195 beneath its external cell layer is devoid of any matter whatsoever; the exterior of the organism reacts regularly to gravitational and environmental stimuli, but the interior is a vacuum space lacking gravity and seemingly existing outside of Einsteinian physics. Occasional bursts of microwave radiation have been measured from within SCP-4798-21195. Expression: What we call sacred / Is it what we call stolen? / They said what we know was fed / And what we saw was / Written by the songs of before / But we are not a sum of memories / Because nothing is nothing / And because nothing will tell us how / We don\u2019t obey nothing / No end to sentence",
        "SCP-4798-04151 Description: Population of bees, possibly of the genus Xylocopa . Anomalous Properties: Instances of SCP-4798-04151 have developed what appears to be a complex movement system seemingly with no benefit to survival or communication. This movement system responds to various seemingly unrelated stimuli. For example, movements become more erratic when SCP-4798-04151 is exposed to radioactive material, but slow significantly in the presence of any object of the color purple.

These signals result in surreal imagery appearing on connected televisions, including abnormal combinations of clips from television programs from the past thirteen years. Investigation of these signals led to the initial discovery of SCP-4798 by Foundation personnel. Expression: Lover you\u2019re not my sibling / Drifting cattle you\u2019re not my foe / All this world I rearranged it / It takes sixteen feet to start / Who will this belong to tomorrow? / Who does it become today? / I was here, that was why I ran away",

I was scared, but it\u2019s actually somewhat interesting, being an anomaly myself. It kind of makes you wonder what we mean by that. \u2018Anomaly.\u2019 What exactly are we comparing to?\u201d Researcher Tannenbaum: \u201cPlease try and stay focused, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I would say that is a definite yes. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s that particular street, in that particular city, but at the same time, I kind of feel like\u2026 why not? I make a meaning of that.

But it\u2019s not like something scripted. Does that make sense? It\u2019s like everything in this place \u2013 every expression of SCP-4798 \u2013 is singing.

What is the meaning of SCP-4798?\u201d SCP-4798-1-12: \u201cI wish I could say, but I don\u2019t know. Even now, I\u2026 it\u2019s so, so strange.
