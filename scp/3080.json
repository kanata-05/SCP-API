They are to be permitted to interact with each other under supervision for 90 minutes each day.\n\n\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-3080 should either be aromantic or in stable romantic relationships. These personnel are to undergo weekly counseling sessions, together with their romantic partners if applicable. If any person assigned to SCP-3080 begins displaying symptoms of its effects, they are to be reassigned elsewhere.\n\n\nUpdated Containment Procedures \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017:\n SCP-3080-1 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell other than the one in which it or SCP-3080-2 was previously contained. It is to be given weekly psychiatric therapy, and is currently on suicide watch. Requests for items such as media for entertainment may be approved at the discretion of its psychiatrist.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3080 was the designation for several anomalous phenomena surrounding the romantic relationship between Drs. Catherine and Simon \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, designated SCP-3080-1 and -2, respectively. They were formerly Foundation-employed researchers who declared a consensual romantic and sexual relationship with Site-\u2588\u2588 Human Resources on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2014, and later married on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015, shortly before the designation of SCP-3080.\n\n\nWhen separated for extended periods of time, SCP-3080-1 and -2 became increasingly desperate to interact with each other, and exhibited anomalous strength and endurance when attempting to reunite.\n\n\nAfter SCP-3080-1 and -2 declared their relationship, any person who spent a significant amount of time\n1\n interacting with SCP-3080-1 and/or -2 exhibited consistent changes in mood and personality. Among these were an intense romantic attraction to either SCP-3080-1 or -2, and disdain for and jealousy of the other, sometimes accompanied by violent urges.\n\n\nThe choice of one or the other was typically, but not always, consistent with the subject's prior romantic preferences; aromantic individuals apparently chose at random. While some subjects also expressed sexual attraction to SCP-3080-1 or -2, it was comparatively rare, and not believed to be correlated with the anomalous properties of SCP-3080.\n\n\nLikewise, SCP-3080-1 and -2 did not exhibit any anomalous strength or endurance when only prevented from engaging in sexual activity, given that they were permitted to speak with and see each other for at least 90 minutes per day.\n\n\nSCP-3080-1 and -2 were also the focal point of several events which, while not impossible, are generally considered very unlikely, especially given their unusual frequency. These are summarized in Document 3080-A.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a03080-A:\u00a0Notable\u00a0Events\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a03080-A:\u00a0Notable\u00a0Events\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of events believed to have been caused by the anomalous properties of SCP-3080. All of these events occurred before SCP-3080 was initially contained and cataloged.\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2014, shortly after SCP-3080-1 and -2 declared their relationship, a man named Peter \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 contacted SCP-3080-2, claiming to be its long-lost twin brother. Further investigation has proven that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was indeed who he claimed to be. After a relatively short time, he began making romantic and sexual advances on SCP-3080-1, whose refusals did not deter him. Eventually, SCP-3080-1 filed a restraining order on Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588; he later died in an automotive accident shortly after having explicitly written SCP-3080-1 and -2 out of his will. It was later discovered that Peter \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had a net worth in excess of $100 million USD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months after the above incident, one Taryn W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a college roommate of SCP-3080-1, began expressing romantic interest in SCP-3080-2 and quickly cut off all contact with SCP-3080-1. It was soon discovered that Ms. W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had begun stalking SCP-3080-2 with a camera, taking several hundreds of pictures of it without its knowledge or consent. She was arrested and later tried and found guilty of one count of felony stalking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015, SCP-3080-1 was kidnapped while shopping at a local grocery store. The kidnapper requested ten love letters from SCP-3080-2, delivered via dead drop on ten separate occasions, as ransom. SCP-3080-2 initially complied, but SCP-3080-1 managed to subdue the kidnapper, one Arnold H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and turn him over to local authorities. Mr. H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had previously been a coworker of SCP-3080-2 at Site-\u2588\u2588. Notably, he was believed to be heterosexual and heteroromantic, but still expressed interest in SCP-3080-2 over -1. He was amnesticized in accordance with protocol, then turned over to local authorities. SCP-3080-1 was unharmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015, SCP-3080-1 and -2 were married at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Lutheran Church in [REDACTED]. During the ceremony, Peter \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 entered the church with a shotgun and ordered the priest and wedding party to stop the ceremony. They complied, and he described how he had faked his own death, then went on to describe his romantic feelings for SCP-3080-1 in great detail. Due to SCP-3080-1 and -2's employment as researchers, several Foundation agents were in attendance; they subdued Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 with no harm to any civilians or Foundation personnel. The ceremony was then completed without further incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter SCP-3080-1 and -2's honeymoon, they recommended that their relationship be classified as an SCP object. This recommendation was accepted by the Site Director and O5 Council on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a03080-Alpha\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a03080-Alpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. O\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a researcher who had been assigned to SCP-3080 for several months\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-3080-1\n\n\nExtraneous material has been redacted.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG 11:45:31 \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017]\n\n\nDr. O\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We're working under the theory that it's some kind of memetic effect.
