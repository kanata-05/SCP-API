Any activity is to be recorded, scanned for cognitohazards, and archived. Foundation personnel are forbidden interaction with social media accounts associated with SCP-3532 unless given explicit orders otherwise. In accordance with Procedure 24-Lehonot, information damaging to the public image of SCP-3532 is to be produced wherever and whenever applicable. In the event that Procedure 24-Lehonot were to be rendered ineffective, all platforms hosting active SCP-3532 accounts are to be taken offline or otherwise rendered inaccessible until containment can be reestablished.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3532 is believed to be an entity previously worshipped as a deity at an indeterminate point in the past. Recovered documentation\n1\n suggests SCP-3532 currently resides in an extra-spatial plane and can interact with standard reality through forms of long distance communication. Currently, SCP-3532 is known to the public as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a popular social media advertiser and influencer. SCP-3532 currently prioritizes the growth of its cult-like following, known as \"The Miraculous Church Gang\"\n2\n, using its social media presence to do so. SCP-3532 has displayed a basic understanding of the creation of cognitohazardous imagery, and will often include cognitohazardous elements in its posts online. Testing has shown that the cognitohazards employed by SCP-3532 do not force the observer to perform an action, but instead act as a strong suggestion to do so. Further testing indicates that a negative perception of SCP-3532 can counteract the cognitohazardous effects.\n3\n\n\nSCP-3532 was discovered on 1/19/18, when several video files containing level 2 cognitohazardous patterns were detected by Foundation webcrawlers. The files were uploaded to the Instagram and Twitter social platforms by accounts belonging to SCP-3532, and featured the entity advertising products from [REDACTED], as well as GoI-3532-1 branded merchandise. The cognitohazards found in the files would compel viewers to both purchase the featured products and follow the several social media accounts of SCP-3532. At the time of discovery, there were no other viewable posts on either accounts.\n\n\nInvestigations into SCP-3532 owned accounts revealed a number of deleted posts made prior to 1/19/18, with the earliest being dated 11/28/17. Said posts differ from the more recent posts and indicate a lack of understanding on how social media operates. In these posts SCP-3532 appears to beg for followers on its accounts and ponders why other users have more followers on their accounts.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of SCP-3532 Posts Pre 1/19/18\n\n\n\n\nmy username\n\n\n@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nmy old follwers died get me new ones Twetty\n\n\n3:56 AM - 28 November 2017\n\n\n0\n Retweets \n0\n Likes\n\n\n\n\nmy username\n\n\n@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\ntWetty can yoou help me with instragram also what is retweet\n\n\n5:01 PM - 28 November 2017\n\n\n1\n Retweet \n0\n Likes\n\n\n\n\nmy username\n\n\n@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nhow Twitty why the gods katyperry and potus contain more follow please respond to me twetty\n\n\n8:09 AM - 29 November 2017\n\n\n0\n Retweets \n0\n Likes\n\n\n\n\nThe sudden shift in post coherency coincides with SCP-3532 acquiring representation from social media managing company \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Marketing\n4\n on 1/3/18. It is assumed SCP-3532 utilized cognitohazards similar to those found in its posts to acquire representation.

It does not appear that SCP-3532 used its cognitohazardous effects to secure these deals, rather it seems that these companies reached out to SCP-3532 on their own accord due to the entity's popularity.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0A:\u00a0MTF\u00a0Phi-1\u00a0Infiltration,\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Document\u00a03532\u00a024a\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0A:\u00a0MTF\u00a0Phi-1\u00a0Infiltration,\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Document\u00a03532\u00a024a\n\n\n\n\nOn 5/13/18, a detachment of MTF Phi-1 (\"Hostile Takeover\") infiltrated the main offices of GoI-3532-2 in order to acquire documentation concerning SCP-3532. A notable document acquired in the raid was a pdf file of GoI-3532-2's contract with SCP-3532.\n7\n Cross referencing Recovered Document 3532\u00a024a with other recovered contracts shows a number of deviations, such as the term \"client\" being replaced with \"Miraculous Being\" and \"manager\" with \"Miraculous High Priest\". Other notable aspects include a clause stating the contract can only be altered by SCP-3532 and no other persons, as well as a separate clause stating GoI-3532-2 reserves the right to retract representation for clients deemed unprofitable or harmful to the image of the company\n8\n. Due to the concern that SCP-3532 could easily influence other companies in a similar manner, Procedure 24-Lehonot was drafted in order to suppress the entity's influence. Procedure approved on 5/20/18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0B:\u00a024-Lehenot,\u00a0Containment\u00a0Established\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0B:\u00a024-Lehenot,\u00a0Containment\u00a0Established\n\n\n\n\nOn 5/21/18, Procedure 24-Lehonot was enacted. A detachment of MTF Phi-1 was tasked with replacing key members of GoI-3532-2 upper management with Foundation agents in order to gain control of the company. Once the company was successfully under Foundation influence, PoI-3532-1 was replaced by Agent Jeffery Burr. Agent Burr then attempted to alter the social media persona of SCP-3532 to one that would be seen as undesirable.\n\n\n\n\nLog Burr 3532\u00a001\n\n\n\n\nStaying \"Hip\"\n\nto: miracleismeok@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nfrom: jburr@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588marketing.\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nHello Lord \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\n\nI've noticed as of late that your posts aren't getting as much attention as they were before.

It was determined that SCP-3532 could only be influenced by someone it perceived as having a better understanding of social media. In order to successfully alter the online persona of SCP-3532, Site-72 authorized the use of social media accounts belonging to \nSCP-3331-Alpha\n to contact SCP-3532. Agent Burr was instructed to contact SCP-3532 posing as SCP-3331-Alpha and alter the entity's perceptions of current social trends.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nLog Burr 3532\u00a002\n\n\n\n\n@JohnCena: Hey, is this \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\n@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No, this is his manager.

Within two months, the number of visitors to SCP-3532 run accounts had dropped by 95%. At this point, GoI-3532-2 retracted its representation of SCP-3532 in accordance with the company's contract. SCP-3532 attempted to contact other social media managing companies seeking representation but to no avail.
