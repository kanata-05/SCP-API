Tests utilizing SCP-3679 must be carried out or approved by a level 3 researcher assigned to SCP-3679.\n\n\nInvestigation into the identity and location of PoI-3679 is currently underway. The online storefront maintained by PoI-3679 is to be monitored and any newly identified customers are to be located and amnesticized after their purchases are confiscated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3679 is an unbranded ballpoint pen purchased online as a part of a writing kit. Chemical analysis shows the contents of SCP-3679 to be natural non-anomalous red ink. Despite this, tests have indicated that any writing done with SCP-3679 results in a blend of ink and the writer's own blood being used; no test subjects have displayed any discomfort or injury that would otherwise explain this, and prolonged use of SCP-3679 has failed to result in any noticeable differences in blood pressure or other such factors.\n\n\nStatements written with SCP-3679 are contractually binding: violating a claim or promise written with SCP-3679 invariably results in the writer's injury or death occurring within the following 24 hours. Causes of death have included non-anomalous factors (e.g. heart failure or accidental death) as well as anomalous factors (e.g. spontaneous human combustion or unprovoked decapitation). Those bound by a contract written with SCP-3679 have an innate understanding of the penalties for violating said contract, and as such, show a notable unwillingness to violate their terms.\n\n\nSCP-3679 was purchased from seller \"shadow-queen\", designated PoI-3679, through the popular online marketplace Etsy.com after a routine scan indicated potential anomalous activity based on the reviews left on PoI-3679's store. SCP-3679 was originally a part of a kit marketed as a \"Do-it-Yourself Geas\n1\n Kit\", which contained SCP-3679, a pad of fifty non-anomalous sheets of paper, and a note from the seller.\n\n\n\n\nDocument-3679\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0close\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo-it-Yourself Geas Kit\n\n\nTired of broken promises? Rival hero stealing all your thunder?\n\nCreate your own geas today!\n\n\nForbid them from cutting their hair, prohibit them from refusing a gift!\n\nMake them do anything you can think of with this simple kit!\n\nAll you have to do is get them to sign!\n\n\nWARNING: Seller is not responsible for any injury or death caused as a result of this kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial attempts at making contact with PoI-3679 were rejected. After leaving a one-star review of the purchased kit, PoI-3679 initiated correspondence with Senior Researcher Maxwell, head researcher assigned to SCP-3679.\n\n\n\n\nChat\u00a0Log\u00a03679\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0close\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshadow-queen:\n hey asshole\n\n\nshadow-queen:\n wtf is with the one star rating\n\n\nrjmaxwell:\n Hello.

After locating an IP address, agents were dispatched with orders to capture PoI-3679 if possible. When agents arrived at the location derived from the traced IP address\n2\n, they found only a small copse of trees showing no signs of human habitation. Field agents have been assigned to observe this location until further notice.\n\n\nAny customers that had left reviews on SCP-3679 have been located and amnesticized, with duplicate kits being incinerated.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \ngeas\n (/geSH/) \nnoun:\n (in Irish folklore) an obligation or prohibition magically imposed on a person.\n\n\n2\n.
