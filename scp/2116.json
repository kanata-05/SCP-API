The individual designated as SCP-2116-1 is currently a female, aged 20. SCP-2116-1 will never willingly part with SCP-2116. When SCP-2116-1 expires for any reason, a replacement must be found within 12 hours. The age of the individual designated as SCP-2116-1 is irrelevant, testing has shown that when a suitable subject is found the anomalous nature will subside. SCP-2116-1 must be a female subject, as males seem to be unaffected by the anomalous nature of SCP-2116. Once a suitable candidate has been located, SCP-2116 is to be handed over to the subject by a male researcher. Selection criteria for SCP-2116-1 is listed below in Addendum 1.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Addendum\u00a01\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendum\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMust score mid to low on the overall Risk-Sophistication Treatment Inventory (RST-I).\n\n\nMust score low on the Sophistication-Maturity (S) cluster.\n\n\nMust score low on the Cognitive (S-Cog) cluster.\n\n\nMust score mid to low on the Emotional (S-Emo) cluster.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the subject must meet the following:\n\n\n\n\nModerate to low scores in Treatment Amenability\n\n\nLow scores on the Responsibility and Motivation cluster (T-Res)\n\n\nLow scores on the Consideration and Tolerance cluster (T-Cat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2116 is a child's doll manufactured sometime in the mid-19th Century. SCP-2116 is dressed in a simple red cotton dress with cloth shoes and garments consistent with 19th Century garb. The head is constructed of standard bisque porcelain and painted to resemble an adult female. SCP-2116 is otherwise unremarkable in appearance other than the accumulation of a substantial amount of dirt and grime on the surface.\n\n\nIf SCP-2116 is further than 10 meters from the current SCP-2116-1 for longer than 5 minutes, its anomalous property will manifest as an alteration to reality within a 1 meter radius centered on SCP-2116 itself. The environment, decor, ambient temperature, and furnishings become altered to be more attractive to a prepubescent human female. Tables will be set with a pink tea set with a teapot filled with a sweet red liquid, various sweet treats will manifest, and the table cover will become a lace tablecloth of a style popular during the mid-19th Century. For every hour that SCP-2116 is not in the possession of SCP-2116-1, the region of altered reality expands by 1 meter. Testing has shown that items removed from this region of altered reality retain their altered properties and food items created are non-toxic and will decay at the same rate as normal items of the same type.\n\n\nBackground:\n SCP-2116 was first discovered when Foundation agents embedded in the \u2588\u2588 State Patrol detected a call to investigate a house with a dead body. Foundation agents responded to the call and discovered the home of [REDACTED] changed entirely. The entire house, which had been a ranch style dwelling built in the early 1960's, had been changed to a Victorian style two story dwelling with a steeply pitched roof, wide front porch and a turret style gable on the front corner. All internal furnishings had been altered and featured sofas, paintings and other items consistent with mid-19th Century homes. In an upstairs bedroom, agents found the body of [REDACTED], an 80-year-old female. An autopsy revealed nothing unusual. The victim had apparently expired due to a sudden massive myocardial infarction. Interviews with neighbors revealed that the occupant of the house had been an 11-year-old child. Statements indicate that the neighbors did not find anything unusual about a child living alone in the house. Research into possible memetic effects from SCP-2116 are still pending. Neighbors state that for as long as they had known the victim, she would never allow SCP-2116 to be out of her grasp. Class B amnestics were administered to neighbors and city records were altered to show that the house had always been a two story Victorian.\n\n\nDuring recovery, Agents noted that surroundings were being altered as they were investigating and proceeded with due haste. Agent [REDACTED] became a casualty during the recovery process when she apparently removed SCP-2116 from the grip of the victim. Agents accompanying her state that they heard a scream from the upstairs bedroom and subsequently found an oil portrait of Agent [REDACTED] dressed in mid-19th Century clothing with SCP-2116 on the floor next to it. Male agents were able to handle SCP-2116 with no ill effects. It was after SCP-2116 was placed in containment that researchers noted that the rate of conversion was increasing. A D-Class female was brought in as a test to see how the anomalous nature of SCP-2116 would respond. The D-Class, now designated as SCP-2116-1, had been committed to life in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 State Mental Hospital after a psychiatric evaluation determined that she was mentally incompetent to stand trial. SCP-2116-1 has been in a persistent catatonic state since her arrest in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0log\u00a01\u00a0follows:\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0test\u00a0log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log:\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:32 AM - SCP-2116 is placed in SCP-2116-1's hands.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:33 AM - SCP-2116-1 stirs and looks down at SCP-2116.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:34 AM - SCP-2116-1 begins stroking the hair of SCP-2116.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:39:15 AM - SCP-2116-1 screams.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:39:20 AM - SCP-2116-1's hands lock around SCP-2116.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:40:02 AM - High speed footage shows SCP-2116-1 shrinking in size.\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:40:30 AM - SCP-2116-1 is transformed into a doll similar in size and clothing to SCP-2116.
