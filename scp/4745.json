SCP-4745 is not to be placed in its active state unless during testing, and SCP-4745 may not enter its active state again until at least four days have passed since its last use.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4745 is a 1m tall plastic snowman figurine with a top hat. The words \"Christmas Carl by Dr. Wondertainment\" are written on its base.\n\n\nWhenever the top hat is placed on the figurine, SCP-4745 enters its active phase. While it is in its active phase and placed within a human dwelling, SCP-4745 will alter the abode to make it Halloween-themed, either by generating Halloween-style objects and items or by altering existing decor to fit a Halloween motif\n1\n.\n\n\nAfter approximately seven days, SCP-4745's alterations will begin to transition from child-friendly horror elements, as is typical for most Halloween themes, to a more disturbing motif. Examples of alterations during this time have included the replacement of edible liquids with human blood, the generation of human corpses and body parts, and reports of frightening sounds and noises\n2\n.\n\n\nAfter thirteen days in its active state, SCP-4745 will change the theme of its alterations to outright horror, generating malevolent entities and becoming a threat to any humans in the altered dwelling. Testing has revealed the generation of booby traps, animated corpses, various entities from horror media, and duplications of hostile SCP objects. Some notable SCP-4745 alterations include:\n\n\n\n\nAnimation of statues and figures into hostile entities.\n\n\nTransformation of a room into a copy of \nSCP-002\n.\n\n\nRerouting of doorways into pocket dimensions resembling large graveyards or forests.\n\n\nGeneration of entities similar to SCP-083-D.\n\n\nManifestation of an entity resembling \"Jason Voorhees\" from the \nFriday the 13th\n film franchise.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the top hat is removed or SCP-4745 is removed from the dwelling, its alterations begin to revert at approximately twice the rate at which they initially appeared.\n\n\nAddendum 4745.1 (Discovery):\n SCP-4745 was found in the home of Angela Jupati with Document 4745-A, who had contacted local police regarding SCP-4745's anomalous properties. MTF Phi-13 (\"Spooky Scary Skeletons\")\n3\n was deployed, and were able to successfully amnesticize Ms. Jupati and retrieve SCP-4745.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a04745-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a04745-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for letting Christmas Carl stay with you this holiday season!
