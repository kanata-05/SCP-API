The surrounding area extending to ten kilometers from the facilities is to be evacuated. Any and all references to the incidents that have so far been caused by SCP-5493 must be expunged and their witnesses amnesticized.\n\n\nClose cooperation must be conducted with Global Occult Coalition operatives in order to prevent the veil of normalcy from breaking. Contact must also be maintained with the leaders of the affected nations. As such, personnel are expected to exercise caution when containing SCP-5493-A instances, due to concerns by world governments about the subjects' wellbeing. Lethal action is not authorized under any circumstances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5493 is a spontaneous global phenomenon that affects the members of 54 of the world\u2019s legislative assemblies. On 12/16/2019 at 1:23 PM, affected government officials (henceforth referred to as SCP-5493-A) have been reported to begin exhibiting erratic and extremely violent behavior, disrupting all legislative operations. No discernible cause has yet been found for the phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/16/2019\n\n\nThe day of release. Fuck that movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mood in the O5 council chamber was tense. Extremely so.\n\n\nOne had called the emergency meeting as soon as dire news came through from both their operatives and the GOC, going hand-in-hand with everything else that\u2019s happened in the last three hours.\n\n\nEverything was moving far too fast for their liking. Information lockdown efforts were holding, but they didn\u2019t know for how long. The same thing went for the leaders of all the affected countries. If just one decided to squeal\u2026\n\n\nAanya decided not to think about that. Her Public Outreach already had their hands full. She checked her watch. It displayed the time as 1:10 AM- nearly twelve hours since the last incident of 5493.\n\n\nShe looked around the council chamber. It was empty, emptier than usual- the recent incident had required the attention of many of their fellow overseers. Of the thirteen in the council, only five were present.\n\n\nOne was slowly preparing his papers, readying to give the briefing of the current situation to the other overseers. His hands shook with every movement, something that Aanya hadn\u2019t seen in years. She remembered the times when he stood strong, then pursed her lips- those times were long past.\n\n\nTwo, Mann, was crossing his arms. She could tell that he was tense. His usual allies on the Council, Gears and Clef, were absent. That fact alone contributed to much of his nervousness. He was already furiously tapping his feet on the floor, while his right hand worried the large mustache on his upper lip. Aanya could only smile. \nThe Mad Doctor,\n she thought. \nHow we watched your career with great interest.\n\n\nThree and Four \u2013 Gears and Clef - were both physically absent and attending remotely, having been assigned to the situations in Russia and Korea, respectively. The same went for Six, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve, though they had their cameras off. She hoped they were still listening.\n\n\nMaria Jones, O5-5, was biting her lip- Aanya could already see a bit of blood being drawn. Though she was often a stern and stony woman, the director of RAISA seemed to be letting her fear come to the fore, now. Even when Maria wasn\u2019t directly involved with the efforts to contain 5493, Aanya knew through the whispers in the grapevines that she had a relative in the Senate- though who, she didn\u2019t know.\n\n\nLast of all that were present in the council room was Seven, Jack Bright, and he was \ncranky.\n Personnel was just as busy as Public Outreach, and the recent 5493 incident had forced many of their operatives on the ground to relocate to other Sites and branches- relocations which Bright had to supervise himself. He wasn\u2019t particularly happy about working with the GOC, either.\n\n\nOne cleared his throat.\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d He said, tenuously, yet still retaining his signature twang of authority. The weakness in his voice was obvious, though Aanya could tell that his mind was whirring with solutions. He turned on the slideshow on the screen to his left. \u201cLet\u2019s get to business.\u201d\n\n\nImmediately, all those present stood up in their seats. One had always insisted that they made themselves presentable before every meeting, in days long past. The mannerism still stuck, even now.\n\n\nOne began. He had the poise of an old and experienced professor, lecturing his students with strictness and authority. \u201cI know all of you are familiar with today\u2019s events, but let\u2019s round this down.\u201d His voice quivered. \u201cOn the sixteenth of December, 2019, at exactly 1:23 PM Seoul time, we received reports of a session of the National Assembly in South Korea being interrupted by a sudden outbreak of violence. Politicians were getting beaten by other politicians, shouting matches were the norm, and circular debates were being made.\u201d\n\n\nHe coughed. \u201cUnder normal circumstances, we would have dismissed this as a particularly active Assembly session, but then we received reports of the same thing happening all over the world.\u201d\n\n\nHe switched to the next slide. \u201cOne hour later, at 1:23 PM, the legislative branch of China exhibited the same behavior for no apparent reason. At that, we began to suspect that \nsomething\n was going on. The fact that this was an anomalous occurrence was confirmed when the legislative branch of the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia all followed suit at the same time. Same violence, same goddamn nonsense. Prior to 1:23, all of the members would enter, regardless of their predetermined schedule. Once 1:23 strikes, violence erupts. Any attempts at stopping them end in failure, especially with their abilities and resistance to tranquilizers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAny questions so far?\u201d One said, looking from Overseer to Overseer with a piercing glare.\n\n\nAanya knew it was a strategy he used to keep their attention. No one dared ask One a question during a briefing. The first time anyone did was Mann, nearly ten years ago. She still smiled at the memory.\n\n\n\u201cSeven?\u201d One said, looking at Bright.\n\n\nBright shrugged irritatedly. \u201cNah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA surprise to be sure. A welcome one, in fact. Two?\u201d\n\n\nMann looked up from his boot, then shook his head.\n\n\nOne nodded to himself. Though he was but a shadow of what he was, he still maintained a formidable presence.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d He turned to face the screen again. \u201cLet\u2019s continue.\u201d\n\n\nHe switched to a slide showing the US Senate and Congress in utter pandemonium. \u201cAll in all, 54 countries in total had lost all control over their legislative branches, causing a great headache for us at the Foundation. We don\u2019t know what started it, but we\u2019ve made some measures to address it.\u201d He switched to the next slide, showing the GOC logo.\n\n\n\u201cAll of you know the deal we made with the GOC several hours ago, and the emergency vote that came with it. Twelve ayes, one nay.\u201d\n\n\nBright averted his gaze immediately.\n\n\nOne continued. \u201cWe all know that even with our far-reaching influence and so-called unlimited power, we aren\u2019t able to be everywhere at once. So, when we approved the proposal, we began to cooperate with the Global Occult Coalition on matters of containing and neutralizing the threat. With this, they requested twenty tons of our amnestic stock for information containment and two hundred of our personnel for assistance in containing the threat. Overall, not a large price.\u201d\n\n\nBright sighed nearly inaudibly to her left.\n\n\nHe flashed to a picture of the South Korean National Assembly building being entered by operatives from the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation. \u201cThis was our first operation: The National Assembly Building, in Seoul. Fifty operatives from our East Asian branch, sixty from the GOC.\u201d\n\n\nHe flashed to another picture depicting the operation within. Assembly members could be seen attacking multiple operatives. \u201cEach operative was armed with tranquilizer guns, in order to neutralize the instances of 5493-A in a nonlethal manner. We hoped that this would put an end to the hysteria. Instead, it worsened it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAssembly members attacked operatives, manifesting superhuman abilities the moment they were stopped from performing their\u2026 activities.\u201d He showed a blurred picture taken from an operatives\u2019 helmetcam, depicting another operative being beaten to death by a South Korean assemblyman. \u201cDue to the absence of an approved kill order from the South Korean government as well as Command for both forces, our operatives had to retreat with multiple casualties. Seventeen injured, three dead. Right after we left, the 5493-As resumed their activities.\u201d\n\n\nBright grunted with irritation. \"Like fighting up against higher ground.\" He muttered.\n\n\nAanya could only sigh in response. She herself agreed, though silently.\n\n\nOne\u2019s gaze turned to Bright in the space of half a moment. \u201cDo you have anything to contribute, Bright?\u201d He said, the strength of his personality showing through his wheezing voice.\n\n\nBright stared at him. He bit his lip, trying to contain his frustration.\n\n\nBright winced, then spoke. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we have just told our operatives to\u2026 fucking knock them out? Beat them with batons? Riot guards do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcellent question,\u201d One said, placing his hand on the table. \u201cBut ultimately a foolish one. Though we are a secret organization, we are still beholden to what we serve\u2026\u201d He paused to breathe. \u201c\nHumanity.\n\u201d\n\n\nOne stared Bright down. The old rivalry between teacher and student was heavily apparent in the room. One was a pragmatist, a man willing to compromise between staying true to his values and saving the things that gave birth to those values. Bright was loyal to the Foundation and its purpose, embodying its original vision until the bitter end.\n\n\nBright didn\u2019t respond, instead continuing to stare back at One.\n\n\n\u201cRight now, the governments of the humanity we serve do not wish to see their officials harmed.\u201d One spoke, finally. \u201cI do not agree with it, but it is the price we pay. These are still influential senators, congressmen, and assemblymen. Politicking is seen everywhere, and we must be wary of it, no matter our policy of staying out of international affairs. The GOC, being a part of the UN, is even more sensitive to it than us. I do hope that does not surprise you.\u201d\n\n\nA thick silence permeated through the room.\n\n\nAanya looked at Bright\u2019s face- changing from frustration to anger to rage- then back down to submission. Even now, One\u2019s personality dominated everything.\n\n\n\u201cI understand, Sir.\u201d Bright said, leaning back in defeat. He sighed, and muttered something under his breath.\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d One said, nodding. \u201cLet\u2019s resume.\u201d\n\n\nHe turned back to the screen. \u201cDue to the failure at the National Assembly in Seoul, we were forced to go back to the drawing board. Thirteen and her Public Outreach-\u201c he said, gesturing to Aanya, \u201cwere instrumental in our coordination with the Global Occult Coalition. Instead of containing them one-by-one, we opted to go for the information blackout, silencing witnesses and making sure not one of them squealed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOC and Foundation operatives under the guise of local law enforcement standing outside of the Capitol Building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe switched to a slide that showed both GOC and Foundation operatives standing outside of the Capitol building. \u201cCurrent story right now is that of a worldwide coordinated terrorist attack. The 54 governments who are affected by this have agreed to tell that story. Until such a time occurs that this blows over, we must stay vigilant. The Insurgency has been silent on this, and so has the Hand. It is only a matter of time before they make their move.\u201d He stood up straight. Pain crossed his face. \u201cEnd of briefing. You may now speak.\u201d\n\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening. Everyone knew the gravity of being the one to speak first.\n\n\nAanya looked around. Everyone else had their arms crossed, pursing their lips. After One\u2019s grave briefing, every single overseer was deep in thought.\n\n\nThen, her phone vibrated. She got a text.\n\n\nAanya immediately went to get it, combing through her messages.\n\n\nIt was from one of her contacts in Seoul.\n\n\nShe tapped the screen to read it. The message (written in Korean) was short.\n\n\n\n\nAssemblymen are exiting, they're attacking us. We need assistance as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nHer heart sank. She immediately looked up. \"One, what of the attack on the-\"\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, One,\u201d Clef interrupted, his voice booming across the speakers of the room. \u201cBut the Blue House in Seoul has just sent us an urgent dispatch. Their National Assembly members are coming out of the building, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\nOne turned around quickly. \u201cWhat?\u201d The way he said the word was edged with surprise- and dread.\n\n\nClef responded. \"Live feed from the ground is coming on now.\"\n\n\n\u201c\nDo it.\n\u201d One said, his voice going low.\n\n\nAt that, Clef changed the screen to display a live feed from the Federal Assembly building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOC and Foundation operatives armed with riot gear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video was blurry, but showed just enough to cause fear in every single one of the onlooking overseers. In it, what seemed to be some twenty churning balls of flesh and bone rolled across the surface of the concrete outside the building. Both GOC and Foundation operatives were already drawing up to counter them, raising riot shields in the air as they prepared to fight.\n\n\nAs the balls got closer, Aanya realized that they weren\u2019t just any normal skips- they were the assemblymen, still dressed in priceless suits, merged together as one large fleshy ball. She could hear them screeching and groaning in pain as they rolled across the concrete floor, their all-too human screams painful to hear. She could hear their bones cracking agonizingly as the ball moved, picking up speed as arms seemed to sprout from it to push it forward, breaking upon impact as they met the ground.\n\n\n\"\nJORJJJJJJJJ!\n\" They shouted in unison. \"\nJORRRRRRJJJJJJJJ!\n\"\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Aanya could hear Maria say, to her left. \u201cWhat the hell are those?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe don't know.\u201d Clef answered. \u201cAll we do know is that these are the assemblymen. All of them.\"\n\n\nOn the video feed, the balls picked up even more speed with each second, covering several meters in the span of a second. She could hear the operatives drawing their breaths as they closed the distance.\n\n\n\u201cAre we authorized to shoot them?!\u201d She could hear an operative say in Korean.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Their superior shouted back. \u201cWe aren\u2019t cleared to-\u201c\n\n\nSuddenly, the balls seemed to glow bright red with what seemed to be heat, the sheer temperature on their surface causing them to \nhum.\n They were extremely close now, and it would only take a few seconds until-\n\n\n\u201cHOLD FAST!\u201d The commander said in the back. \u201cHOLD DAMN FAST!\u201d\n\n\nThen, in that moment, the balls crashed into the operatives, burning through them like a hot knife through butter. Many died in an instant, being seared to a crisp under the balls\u2019 charge, and even more fell to the ground with vaporized legs and torsos, crying out in agony. Even from her position, thousands of miles away, Aanya had no doubt that the smell would have been of burnt flesh.\n\n\nThe feed cut out, and the entire chamber was left in silence.\n\n\nOne gulped. Aanya had no doubt that he was afraid now- everyone was. The specter of a Broken Masquerade hung in the balance.\n\n\n\u201cThirteen.\u201d He said, looking at Aanya. His eyes were bloodshot, the deep wrinkles in his face getting even deeper by the second. \u201cYou may be excused- you must coordinate with the GOC. I have no doubt that the same will happen everywhere else. Find a way to stop this.\u201d\n\n\nAanya nearly sprung from her seat at the command. She nodded. \u201cAffirmative, O5-1.\u201d\n\n\nAs she left, all she could hear was the Council collapsing into pandemonium- though unlike the assemblies that they were trying to contain, the noise and the arguments were all too \nnormal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/17/2019\n\n\nThe day after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n5493\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nesoteric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nuncontained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\namida\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Korean National Assembly Building\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the global nature of SCP-5493, all instances of SCP-5493-B are to be monitored at all times, \nbeing intercepted when possible\n (see Addendum 5493.01). \nAs the risk of the Veil collapsing at this time is extremely high, caution is to be exercised with regards to the interception of SCP-5493-B instances\n. Should a group of SCP-5493-B instances be predicted to cross one or multiple population centers, all personnel within these population centers must be evacuated as soon as possible. To reduce the risk of breaking the Veil, under no circumstances are operatives assigned to SCP-5493-B allowed to capture or damage any of the instances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5493 is a spontaneous global phenomenon that affects the members of 54 of the world\u2019s upper legislative assemblies. On 12/17/2019, at 1:23 AM, affected government officials (henceforth referred to as SCP-5493-A) began to amalgamate as instances of SCP-5493-B.\n\n\nSCP-5493-B is the designation for the combinatory amalgamations of multiple SCP-5493-A into roughly spherical blobs. The number of instances of SCP-5493-A in one instance of SCP-5493-B has been recorded to range from five to fifteen. SCP-5493-B instances achieve locomotion through the instances of SCP-5493-A within them using their limbs to push themselves across any given surface, allowing them to roll forward at speeds of up to 30 kilometers per hour. When faced with an aquatic obstruction, SCP-5493-B instances have been recorded to swim with a speed of up to 10 kilometers per hour.\n\n\nAll SCP-5493-B instances have been known to be nominally indestructible, capable of regenerating when damaged and reforming when split. When faced with an obstruction or threat, SCP-5493-B instances are capable of spontaneously elevating their temperature to a maximum of 4000 degrees Celsius through unknown means. This allows them the ability of being able to melt through all known materials, including steel, titanium, and tungsten. Despite their composition, such high temperatures do not produce any discernible effect on the SCP-5493-B instances.\n\n\nThough SCP-5493-B instances initially seemed to possess no form of sentient intelligence, recent operations have proven that to be false. Along with being able to move as a single entity, SCP-5493-B instances have also shown to have some semblance of a gestalt consciousness\n1\n between all other instances, allowing them to coordinate movements and efforts to \u201cfree\u201d other entities (See Addendum 5493.01).\n\n\nAs of 12/17/2019, 5477 instances of SCP-5493-B have been known to exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeogang Bridge immediately prior to the Seoul Operation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5493.01:\n Following the initial manifestations of SCP-5493-B and their breach of containment in Seoul, South Korea, a combination of Foundation and Global Occult Coalition forces amounting to two hundred operatives embarked on an operation to secure all instances before they exited the city limits of Seoul, chasing all instances across the recently locked-down Seogang Bridge. They were supplemented with three Apache attack helicopters and twenty Humvees. Due to the instances of SCP-5493-A within each SCP-5493-B instance being valuable to the Korean government, all operatives were told to only use lethal action when necessary, with the primary goal of the operation being containment.\n\n\nThe operation began with the deployment of Class A tranquilizers\n2\n by the operatives within the pursuing attack helicopters and Humvees. This proved to be ineffective. Following that, titanium mesh nets were deployed in order to apprehend each SCP-5493-B instance, which also proved to be ineffective when several SCP-5493-B instances moved in a coordinated manner to free each of the entrapped instances, melting through the titanium mesh. With the instances about to reach the end of the Seogang bridge, lethal action was authorized. Missiles and conventional weaponry were used on the instances to no avail, with damaged SCP-5493-B instances regenerating and reforming when possible.\n\n\nDue to the risk of the Veil being broken, the Seoul operation was aborted, with all SCP-5493-B instances continuing to move across Seoul. In preparation for the containment of information regarding SCP-5493, much of the Seoul area in the path of the SCP-5493-B instances was evacuated, with all other population centers in the aforementioned path being evacuated as well. These included cities such as Namyangju, Gapyeong, Chuncheon, Inje, and Sokcho. Following their arrival at Sokcho, the instances began to move into the Sea of Japan in a northeastern direction.\n\n\nWith the same events transpiring in other affected countries, operational priority was changed to information and damage control rather than containment. Currently, all SCP-5493-B instances are estimated to be moving towards the West Coast of the United States.\n\n\n\n\nThe calls began shortly after Seoul.\n\n\n\u201cSouth Korea is requesting assistance with information control.\u201d One called.\n\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s President is on the line!\u201d The other said.\n\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, the Philippine President is calling too.\u201d That happened an hour later.\n\n\n\u201cIndia is asking about the Bs running through New Delhi.\u201d This was major, and it hit close to home.\n\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am Delegate, several nations are speaking about cooperating with other Groups of Interest instead.\u201d That was vital.\n\n\nOn and on the calls went, going from one head of state to another as requests for assistance, or information, or prioritization came in.\n\n\nAanya loved Public Outreach, but God was it tiring. Especially with 54 countries suddenly waking up to their legislative officials turning into little more than indestructible balls of meat.\n\n\nThree nations had already sided with the Chaos Insurgency. Another five had begun talks with the Serpent's Hand. A few major ones were even talking about defunding the GOC and the Foundation altogether- something that Aanya was trying hard to prevent.\n\n\nThen the blame games happened. In Asia. In Europe. The Americas. Africa. Oceania. On every continent was another conflict to solve, another disagreement, another diplomatic incident.\n\n\nAll she could do from her position was smile and wave, deftly navigating the rigors of international diplomacy in order to prevent worldwide escalation.\n\n\nAt least the GOC was cooperating\u2014 her counterpart there, Delegate Bulsara, was known to be a very considerate diplomat. He was doing everything he could on his end to stop any conflicts from happening.\n\n\nThank the gods for small blessings,\n Aanya thought to herself.\n\n\nStill, the last two days had left her a hefty amount of work\u2014 she had to take back-to-back calls all day, making sure to smooth out this misunderstanding and that, soothe wounded egos, force heads of state to come to an understanding.\n\n\nShe hadn\u2019t slept in the last forty-eight hours. Nothing had stressed her out this much since\u2026 ever. Even the early 2000s were less stressful than this.\n\n\nThere\u2019s always a bigger fish,\n she thought. Her predecessor said that, having had to navigate through the bloodbath that was the Cold War. She was inclined to agree with him now.\n\n\nSighing with exhaustion, she put the telephone down. The American president was acquiring as to the anomalies on his country's soil. Bs were rampaging through DC at that very moment, and were ripe to go across the country to arrive at\u2026 whatever they wished to arrive at.\n\n\nCalifornia,\n she thought, remembering what One said during another one of their emergency meetings. \nThey\u2019re heading towards somewhere in California.\n\n\nThen, she heard a call come through- not on the telephone, but her personal smartphone.\n\n\nShe immediately scrambled to take it. There was only one person in the world that it could be.\n\n\nShe dragged the call sign to the center, and his majestic voice greeted her.\n\n\n\u201cHello, there.\u201d She said lovingly in Hindi. She hoped her exhaustion didn\u2019t show through her voice.\n\n\n\u201cAanya Laghari. Nice to hear your beautiful voice again.\u201d Rajesh said, on the opposite side of the world. \u201cIs your delegate work done yet? Padma is coming home from university. She wants to be able to see her grandmother for once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPadma is in university already? My goodness, she's grown!\u201d Aanya said, a wide smile on her face. \u201cBut work calls, sadly. The United Nations always needs peace kept.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s New York?\u201d He said. \u201cThey\u2019re treating you well at the UN?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She smiled. He never ceased to ask her that question.\n\n\n\u201cI hope so, otherwise they\u2019d have to face the mighty wrath of Professor Rajesh Laghari!\u201d His voice grew deeper with that last part, as if he was a superhero. She still adored it, forty years into their marriage.\n\n\nShe chuckled. Only her husband could make her laugh like that. \"You should have joined me in studying Political Science when we were in college.\"\n\n\n\"Oh,\" Rajesh said, chuckling back. \"I'm not brave enough for politics.\"\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new line.\u201d She responded. \u201cA fine addition to-\u201c\n\n\nHer secretary called from her office. \u201cMa\u2019am, there is something you need to see.\u201d\n\n\nShe froze. \nOf all the damn times-\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rajesh said. The note of disappointment in his voice caused Aanya\u2019s heart to sink. \u201cGo on. The world needs you. Especially now that tensions are rising.\"\n\n\n\u201cRajesh\u2026\u201d Aanya began. \u201cAfter this, I\u2019ll call you back, alright?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d She said.\n\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d He answered. \u201cGood night, my dear wife.\u201d\n\n\nThe phone let out the sound that she hated the most- the sound of goodbye when things still needed to be said. It was outrageous. It was unfair. How the hell could she be one of the most powerful people in the Foundation and not even have the time to-\n\n\nShe gritted her teeth\u2026 and sighed.\n\n\nShe put the phone down.\n\n\nAanya looked to her secretary. \u201cAlright,\u201d She said. \u201cWhat is it, Leonor?\u201d\n\n\nThis is where the fun begins,\n she sarcastically thought to herself.\n\n\nLeonor stayed silent for a few moments.\n\n\nAanya's chest started to go heavy. She didn't know why.\n\n\n\"What is it?\" She said impatiently, trying to take out the fear from her voice.\n\n\nHer hands began to shake. \nWhat the hell was taking her so long?\n\n\nHer secretary\u2019s response came seconds later.\n\n\n\u201cWe're getting news of war in Asia and Europe, ma'am.\u201d Leonor answered. Her voice was shaking. \"Casualty numbers are just coming in. Three hundred military\u2026\"\n\n\nLeonor took a breath. Aanya heard her suppress a sob.\n\n\n\"O-one thousand civilian. The news just came in when you were on the phone with the American president.\"\n\n\nAanya\u2019s heart immediately sank.\n\n\nShe needed to call Bulsara at the GOC immediately.\n\n\nHer fingers closed around the phone on her desk. \nI'm sorry, Rajesh.\n she thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5/4/2020\n\n\n5 months after release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council chamber was tense- somehow, even tenser than it was half a year ago.\n\n\nTo Aanya, those six months seemed like an eternity.\n\n\nNine hundred and fifty thousand dead in the past half-year. Millions displaced. Several nations on the brink of collapse, many more fighting wars that only a few wanted.\n\n\nShe sighed. \nTo think that all of this was caused by a single anomaly.\n\n\nShe bit her lip. No use dwelling on it now.\n\n\nOne, once again, was piling up papers at the head of the table, ready to give a briefing on everything that\u2019s transpired in the last six months.\n\n\nIt was just him, Aanya, Bright, and Clef in the room- four overseers in a council of thirteen.\n\n\nThe others were doing meetings elsewhere, trying to mitigate the political fallout of the recent conflicts. Bold, Ten, was off in the Middle East. Gears was coordinating with what was left of the GOC, helping with the last efforts of the organization at deescalation. Maria was indisposed, helping Disinformation with the most recent amnesticization efforts. Mann was in Korea. Kiryu, O5-12, was in Brazil.\n\n\nAanya rubbed her eyes. The bags under them grew deeper with every day, a consequence of not sleeping any more than three hours for five months. She was aware that she seemed to age 5 years in that time- it was just the hazard of being on the job.\n\n\nShe leaned back. Her bones felt wearier than ever. Her back seemed to crack with the pressure.\n\n\nBright, at least in his current body, seemed to be feeling it too- Personnel, like Public Outreach, did not have it good. The eternally pissed off look on his face was replaced with one of exhaustion, which Aanya took as a bad sign. Bright was never \nnot\n pissed.\n\n\nClef was closing his eyes. Aanya doubted that he was actually sleeping, but Clef had just flown in from dealing with the aftermath of a particularly bad B \u201cattack\u201d in LA- the last blobs rolling in from places like Southeast Asia. He needed the rest.\n\n\nOf all of them, though, the one who aged the most was One- already a venerable figure at seventy-nine, he seemed to have lost ten years just from the stress of pulling the Foundation together. The lines on his face were far deeper than when Aanya last saw him in person four months ago, and his hair seemed to be completely white. His arms were frail and bony as he ordered the papers.\n\n\nOne coughed. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d The presence in his voice was much diminished.\n\n\nEach of the overseers wearily sat up.\n\n\nOne picked up the remote at his side, turning on the screen to display a static Foundation logo.\n\n\n\u201cI know all of you have not enjoyed these past five months,\u201d One said, a ghost of a smile on his face. \u201cBut from here on out, we will go past everything that\u2019s happened in that\u2026 damned period.\u201d He looked at all of them. \u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d\n\n\nThe slide on the screen switched to a familiar picture- that of the blobs making their first move at Seoul.\n\n\n\"This all started with the blobs- 5493-Bs, rolling across national borders, wreaking havoc, and forcing governments to find someone to blame for the 'terror attacks.'\"\n\n\nHe pursed his lips. \"And blame someone they did.\"\n\n\nHe looked straight at Aanya. \u201cDespite our efforts to control the fallout, the governments who \ndidn't\n know of our involvement wanted someone to pay. For many\u2026\" He took a breath. \"\u2026it was their neighbors. Within two months, global tensions were at an all-time high. Wars were starting. Old conflicts were reignited.\u201d\n\n\nHe gave a sad chuckle. It came out strangled and weak. \"We couldn't stop any of it.\"\n\n\nBright let out a resigned sigh. Clef could only look on.\n\n\nOne shook his head in defeat. \u201cGod, to think that we thought we could contain this.\u201d His voice had lowered to nothing but a rasp. He coughed again. \u201cAfter that, the GOC began the process that would eventually lead to their decline. They\u2019d heavily antagonized the use of the destruction caused by the \nterrorists\n as causes for war. They were the first to take the brunt of the blame.\u201d\n\n\nHe could only smile tiredly. \u201cWe suffered too, losing thirty percent of our income within two months of the start of the event. It was a shitshow from start to finish, something that pushed our Foundation to its limits.\u201d\n\n\nThen, he shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 we won. The Veil held up, the anomalous remained closed to the public, and the last of the Bs have made their way to their destination this morning, just in time for May the 4th.\u201d His pale green eyes looked at them all. He smiled. It wasn't happy. \u201cAnd it was then that I realized the reason as to why this all happened.\u201d\n\n\nAanya crossed her arms. They weren\u2019t surprised at the very least- the realization had set in the moment they saw the video that morning.\n\n\nOne switched to a slide displaying the destination that all of the SCP-5493-Bs had been looking for- a large estate just outside of Nicasio, California, once the workplace to an esteemed filmmaker, now the home to a parody of everything they\u2019d struggled for the last five months. Thousands of blobs of all shapes and sizes were gathered all around the vicinity of the estate\u2019s main house, waiting for the last of their brethren to join them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkywalker Ranch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was here, at Skywalker Ranch, that we realized just what exactly all of this suffering meant. This picture was taken yesterday morning.\u201d\n\n\nHe switched to the next slide, showing a video of the last of the blobs coming to a stop outside of the main house. They were rolling abominations of flesh, using their arms and legs to push themselves forward- Aanya herself never got used to the sight of them. Over the months, they\u2019d lost their clothing and their individual forms, instead turning into nothing more than one single bloated ball. That fact alone added to the morbid absurdity of the entire thing.\n\n\nOne continued. \u201cThis video was taken just a few hours earlier. As you can see, it shows the last of the Bs coming to a stop outside of their destination. If you look closely\u2026\u201d\n\n\nBefore Aanya\u2019s eyes, the blobs began to change color and composition, turning from blobs of flesh into pieces of a cheek, of hair, of fat. Fifty turned into eyeballs. A hundred became parts of a tongue. When all of that was done, they began to build on top of each other, forming a neck as a base. The others climbed on top of them with limbs made out of hair, fat, bone, bare muscle, or skin, building more and more of the figure that they wished to create. All the while, Aanya could hear them screeching in agony, just like they first did all those months ago. She still wondered if those were the persons who were once part of them.\n\n\nSoon, a chin was formed, then the beginnings of a lower lip, then the rest of its upper lip. By then, the jaw was formed, followed by the cheeks, the nose, and the ears. Wrinkles began to form on the figure\u2019s skin, growing deeper and deeper as more blobs began to fill the gaps. The eyeballs were soon formed right after, which was followed by the rest of the forehead.\n\n\nBy the time twenty minutes had passed, the remainder of the figure\u2019s hair was being finished, the hands of the blobs that made it up holding on tenuously to the blobs below them. It was an absurd thing, one that made Aanya laugh with outrage the first time she watched it.\n\n\nBut now, all she felt was emptiness.\n\n\nTwenty-one minutes after the process began, the masterpiece that the blobs created was revealed to everyone watching- a perfect bust of Ian MacDiarmid during his role as Chancellor Palpatine, smiling with evil intent. As his face moved, the blobs that made it up moved in perfect concert, causing the figure\u2019s face to look as if it was made out of flowers in a windy meadow.\n\n\nAanya wanted to laugh.\n\n\nBut she couldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cI AM THE SENATE.\u201d\n The figure of Palpatine said, moving his mouth as all the blobs that he was made of spoke at once. \n\u201cI AM THE SENATE FROM 54 OF THE WORLD\u2019S COUNTRIES, AND I SAY THE SEQUEL TRILOGY IS BULLSHIT.\u201d\n\n\nAanya looked around, watching the reactions of her fellow O5s as they sat in their seats in silence. They had all seen the footage before.\n\n\nThe Palpatine figure continued booming. \n\u201cTHE RISE OF SKYWALKER IS HOT TRASH. LET US RETURN TO THE GLORY DAYS OF THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE, THE PREQUELS!\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled malevolently at that, as if what he said didn\u2019t come at the cost of thousands of lives.\n\n\n\u201cTODAY, GEORGE LUCAS, YOU WILL KNOW THE PAIN I FELT WHEN I WATCHED THAT GODDAMN MOVIE! EVEN ELDRITCH GODS CAN STILL BE DISAPPOINTED, YOU KNOW. I LOVE DEMOCRACY! I LOVE THE REPUBLIC! WHAT YOU ALLOWED TO BE DONE TO IT IS \nCRIMINAL.\n\u201d\n\n\nSuddenly, the sound of loud applause could be heard from the figure, which churned like an audience at a stadium as the blobs clapped their hands for the abomination that they created. As they did, the Palpatine figure smiled widely, his eyebrows drawn up in a parody of a human expression.\n\n\nThen, he spoke his final words.\n\n\n\u201cNICE ONE, GEORGE LUCAS, YOU FUCKING SELL-OUT. MAY THE FOURTH \nNOT\n BE WITH YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH.\u201d\n\n\nAt that, the blobs immediately collapsed to the ground, screeching as they did.\n\n\nA silence overcame the council chamber.\n\n\nIn that single moment, Aanya Laghari, O5-13, could only laugh. One followed. Then Bright. Then Clef.\n\n\nIt was an absurd thing, a hallmark of the cruelty of the universe, a mockery of everything they had worked for for the past five months.\n\n\nTheir laughter echoed across the room, highlighting every single one of their follies, every single one of their wasted labors, every single life taken in pursuit of a cruel joke.\n\n\nThat day, all the O5 council could do was \nlaugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nSo yeah, that's about it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nI was mad, alright? I apologize. I couldn't exactly \nnot\n do anything.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nBut still, fuck Lucas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Also known as a hive mind\n\n\n2\n.

        "Addendum 5493.01: Following the initial manifestations of SCP-5493-B and their breach of containment in Seoul, South Korea, a combination of Foundation and Global Occult Coalition forces amounting to two hundred operatives embarked on an operation to secure all instances before they exited the city limits of Seoul, chasing all instances across the recently locked-down Seogang Bridge. They were supplemented with three Apache attack helicopters and twenty Humvees. Due to the instances of SCP-5493-A within each SCP-5493-B instance being valuable to the Korean government, all operatives were told to only use lethal action when necessary, with the primary goal of the operation being containment.\nThe operation began with the deployment of Class A tranquilizers 2 by the operatives within the pursuing attack helicopters and Humvees. This proved to be ineffective. Following that, titanium mesh nets were deployed in order to apprehend each SCP-5493-B instance, which also proved to be ineffective when several SCP-5493-B instances moved in a coordinated manner to free each of the entrapped instances, melting through the titanium mesh. With the instances about to reach the end of the Seogang bridge, lethal action was authorized. Missiles and conventional weaponry were used on the instances to no avail, with damaged SCP-5493-B instances regenerating and reforming when possible.\nDue to the risk of the Veil being broken, the Seoul operation was aborted, with all SCP-5493-B instances continuing to move across Seoul. In preparation for the containment of information regarding SCP-5493, much of the Seoul area in the path of the SCP-5493-B instances was evacuated, with all other population centers in the aforementioned path being evacuated as well. These included cities such as Namyangju, Gapyeong, Chuncheon, Inje, and Sokcho. Following their arrival at Sokcho, the instances began to move into the Sea of Japan in a northeastern direction.\nWith the same events transpiring in other affected countries, operational priority was changed to information and damage control rather than containment. Currently, all SCP-5493-B instances are estimated to be moving towards the West Coast of the United States.\nThe calls began shortly after Seoul.\n\u201cSouth Korea is requesting assistance with information control.\u201d One called.\n\u201cChina\u2019s President is on the line!\u201d The other said.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, the Philippine President is calling too.\u201d That happened an hour later.\n\u201cIndia is asking about the Bs running through New Delhi.\u201d This was major, and it hit close to home.\n\u201cMa\u2019am Delegate, several nations are speaking about cooperating with other Groups of Interest instead.\u201d That was vital.\nOn and on the calls went, going from one head of state to another as requests for assistance, or information, or prioritization came in.\nAanya loved Public Outreach, but God was it tiring. Especially with 54 countries suddenly waking up to their legislative officials turning into little more than indestructible balls of meat.\nThree nations had already sided with the Chaos Insurgency. Another five had begun talks with the Serpent's Hand. A few major ones were even talking about defunding the GOC and the Foundation altogether- something that Aanya was trying hard to prevent.\nThen the blame games happened. In Asia. In Europe. The Americas. Africa. Oceania. On every continent was another conflict to solve, another disagreement, another diplomatic incident.\nAll she could do from her position was smile and wave, deftly navigating the rigors of international diplomacy in order to prevent worldwide escalation.\nAt least the GOC was cooperating\u2014 her counterpart there, Delegate Bulsara, was known to be a very considerate diplomat. He was doing everything he could on his end to stop any conflicts from happening.\nThank the gods for small blessings, Aanya thought to herself.\nStill, the last two days had left her a hefty amount of work\u2014 she had to take back-to-back calls all day, making sure to smooth out this misunderstanding and that, soothe wounded egos, force heads of state to come to an understanding.\nShe hadn\u2019t slept in the last forty-eight hours. Nothing had stressed her out this much since\u2026 ever. Even the early 2000s were less stressful than this.\nThere\u2019s always a bigger fish, she thought. Her predecessor said that, having had to navigate through the bloodbath that was the Cold War. She was inclined to agree with him now.\nSighing with exhaustion, she put the telephone down. The American president was acquiring as to the anomalies on his country's soil. Bs were rampaging through DC at that very moment, and were ripe to go across the country to arrive at\u2026 whatever they wished to arrive at.\nCalifornia, she thought, remembering what One said during another one of their emergency meetings. They\u2019re heading towards somewhere in California.\nThen, she heard a call come through- not on the telephone, but her personal smartphone.\nShe immediately scrambled to take it. There was only one person in the world that it could be.\nShe dragged the call sign to the center, and his majestic voice greeted her.\n\u201cHello, there.\u201d She said lovingly in Hindi. She hoped her exhaustion didn\u2019t show through her voice.\n\u201cAanya Laghari. Nice to hear your beautiful voice again.\u201d Rajesh said, on the opposite side of the world. \u201cIs your delegate work done yet? Padma is coming home from university. She wants to be able to see her grandmother for once.\u201d\n\u201cPadma is in university already? My goodness, she's grown!\u201d Aanya said, a wide smile on her face. \u201cBut work calls, sadly. The United Nations always needs peace kept.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s New York?\u201d He said. \u201cThey\u2019re treating you well at the UN?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She smiled. He never ceased to ask her that question.\n\u201cI hope so, otherwise they\u2019d have to face the mighty wrath of Professor Rajesh Laghari!\u201d His voice grew deeper with that last part, as if he was a superhero. She still adored it, forty years into their marriage.\nShe chuckled. Only her husband could make her laugh like that. \"You should have joined me in studying Political Science when we were in college.\"\n\"Oh,\" Rajesh said, chuckling back. \"I'm not brave enough for politics.\"\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new line.\u201d She responded. \u201cA fine addition to-\u201c\nHer secretary called from her office. \u201cMa\u2019am, there is something you need to see.\u201d\nShe froze. Of all the damn times-\n\u201cIt\u2019s work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rajesh said. The note of disappointment in his voice caused Aanya\u2019s heart to sink. \u201cGo on. The world needs you. Especially now that tensions are rising.\"\n\u201cRajesh\u2026\u201d Aanya began. \u201cAfter this, I\u2019ll call you back, alright?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cI love you.\u201d She said.\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d He answered. \u201cGood night, my dear wife.\u201d\nThe phone let out the sound that she hated the most- the sound of goodbye when things still needed to be said. It was outrageous. It was unfair. How the hell could she be one of the most powerful people in the Foundation and not even have the time to-\nShe gritted her teeth\u2026 and sighed.\nShe put the phone down.\nAanya looked to her secretary. \u201cAlright,\u201d She said. \u201cWhat is it, Leonor?\u201d\nThis is where the fun begins, she sarcastically thought to herself.\nLeonor stayed silent for a few moments.\nAanya's chest started to go heavy. She didn't know why.\n\"What is it?\" She said impatiently, trying to take out the fear from her voice.\nHer hands began to shake. What the hell was taking her so long?\nHer secretary\u2019s response came seconds later.\n\u201cWe're getting news of war in Asia and Europe, ma'am.\u201d Leonor answered. Her voice was shaking. \"Casualty numbers are just coming in. Three hundred military\u2026\"\nLeonor took a breath. Aanya heard her suppress a sob.\n\"O-one thousand civilian. The news just came in when you were on the phone with the American president.\"\nAanya\u2019s heart immediately sank.\nShe needed to call Bulsara at the GOC immediately.\nHer fingers closed around the phone on her desk. I'm sorry, Rajesh. she thought.\nThe council chamber was tense- somehow, even tenser than it was half a year ago.\nTo Aanya, those six months seemed like an eternity.\nNine hundred and fifty thousand dead in the past half-year. Millions displaced. Several nations on the brink of collapse, many more fighting wars that only a few wanted.\nShe sighed. To think that all of this was caused by a single anomaly.\nShe bit her lip. No use dwelling on it now.\nOne, once again, was piling up papers at the head of the table, ready to give a briefing on everything that\u2019s transpired in the last six months.\nIt was just him, Aanya, Bright, and Clef in the room- four overseers in a council of thirteen.\nThe others were doing meetings elsewhere, trying to mitigate the political fallout of the recent conflicts. Bold, Ten, was off in the Middle East. Gears was coordinating with what was left of the GOC, helping with the last efforts of the organization at deescalation. Maria was indisposed, helping Disinformation with the most recent amnesticization efforts. Mann was in Korea. Kiryu, O5-12, was in Brazil.\nAanya rubbed her eyes. The bags under them grew deeper with every day, a consequence of not sleeping any more than three hours for five months. She was aware that she seemed to age 5 years in that time- it was just the hazard of being on the job.\nShe leaned back. Her bones felt wearier than ever. Her back seemed to crack with the pressure.\nBright, at least in his current body, seemed to be feeling it too- Personnel, like Public Outreach, did not have it good. The eternally pissed off look on his face was replaced with one of exhaustion, which Aanya took as a bad sign. Bright was never not pissed.\nClef was closing his eyes. Aanya doubted that he was actually sleeping, but Clef had just flown in from dealing with the aftermath of a particularly bad B \u201cattack\u201d in LA- the last blobs rolling in from places like Southeast Asia. He needed the rest.\nOf all of them, though, the one who aged the most was One- already a venerable figure at seventy-nine, he seemed to have lost ten years just from the stress of pulling the Foundation together. The lines on his face were far deeper than when Aanya last saw him in person four months ago, and his hair seemed to be completely white. His arms were frail and bony as he ordered the papers.\nOne coughed. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d The presence in his voice was much diminished.\nEach of the overseers wearily sat up.\nOne picked up the remote at his side, turning on the screen to display a static Foundation logo.\n\u201cI know all of you have not enjoyed these past five months,\u201d One said, a ghost of a smile on his face. \u201cBut from here on out, we will go past everything that\u2019s happened in that\u2026 damned period.\u201d He looked at all of them. \u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d\nThe slide on the screen switched to a familiar picture- that of the blobs making their first move at Seoul.\n\"This all started with the blobs- 5493-Bs, rolling across national borders, wreaking havoc, and forcing governments to find someone to blame for the 'terror attacks.'\"\nHe pursed his lips. \"And blame someone they did.\"\nHe looked straight at Aanya. \u201cDespite our efforts to control the fallout, the governments who didn't know of our involvement wanted someone to pay. For many\u2026\" He took a breath. \"\u2026it was their neighbors. Within two months, global tensions were at an all-time high. Wars were starting. Old conflicts were reignited.\u201d\nHe gave a sad chuckle. It came out strangled and weak. \"We couldn't stop any of it.\"\nBright let out a resigned sigh. Clef could only look on.\nOne shook his head in defeat. \u201cGod, to think that we thought we could contain this.\u201d His voice had lowered to nothing but a rasp. He coughed again. \u201cAfter that, the GOC began the process that would eventually lead to their decline. They\u2019d heavily antagonized the use of the destruction caused by the terrorists as causes for war. They were the first to take the brunt of the blame.\u201d\nHe could only smile tiredly. \u201cWe suffered too, losing thirty percent of our income within two months of the start of the event. It was a shitshow from start to finish, something that pushed our Foundation to its limits.\u201d\nThen, he shrugged.\n\u201cBut\u2026 we won. The Veil held up, the anomalous remained closed to the public, and the last of the Bs have made their way to their destination this morning, just in time for May the 4th.\u201d His pale green eyes looked at them all. He smiled. It wasn't happy. \u201cAnd it was then that I realized the reason as to why this all happened.\u201d\nAanya crossed her arms. They weren\u2019t surprised at the very least- the realization had set in the moment they saw the video that morning.\nOne switched to a slide displaying the destination that all of the SCP-5493-Bs had been looking for- a large estate just outside of Nicasio, California, once the workplace to an esteemed filmmaker, now the home to a parody of everything they\u2019d struggled for the last five months. Thousands of blobs of all shapes and sizes were gathered all around the vicinity of the estate\u2019s main house, waiting for the last of their brethren to join them.\n\u201cIt was here, at Skywalker Ranch, that we realized just what exactly all of this suffering meant. This picture was taken yesterday morning.\u201d\nHe switched to the next slide, showing a video of the last of the blobs coming to a stop outside of the main house. They were rolling abominations of flesh, using their arms and legs to push themselves forward- Aanya herself never got used to the sight of them. Over the months, they\u2019d lost their clothing and their individual forms, instead turning into nothing more than one single bloated ball. That fact alone added to the morbid absurdity of the entire thing.\nOne continued. \u201cThis video was taken just a few hours earlier. As you can see, it shows the last of the Bs coming to a stop outside of their destination. If you look closely\u2026\u201d\nBefore Aanya\u2019s eyes, the blobs began to change color and composition, turning from blobs of flesh into pieces of a cheek, of hair, of fat. Fifty turned into eyeballs. A hundred became parts of a tongue. When all of that was done, they began to build on top of each other, forming a neck as a base. The others climbed on top of them with limbs made out of hair, fat, bone, bare muscle, or skin, building more and more of the figure that they wished to create. All the while, Aanya could hear them screeching in agony, just like they first did all those months ago. She still wondered if those were the persons who were once part of them.\nSoon, a chin was formed, then the beginnings of a lower lip, then the rest of its upper lip. By then, the jaw was formed, followed by the cheeks, the nose, and the ears. Wrinkles began to form on the figure\u2019s skin, growing deeper and deeper as more blobs began to fill the gaps. The eyeballs were soon formed right after, which was followed by the rest of the forehead.\nBy the time twenty minutes had passed, the remainder of the figure\u2019s hair was being finished, the hands of the blobs that made it up holding on tenuously to the blobs below them. It was an absurd thing, one that made Aanya laugh with outrage the first time she watched it.\nBut now, all she felt was emptiness.\nTwenty-one minutes after the process began, the masterpiece that the blobs created was revealed to everyone watching- a perfect bust of Ian MacDiarmid during his role as Chancellor Palpatine, smiling with evil intent. As his face moved, the blobs that made it up moved in perfect concert, causing the figure\u2019s face to look as if it was made out of flowers in a windy meadow.\nAanya wanted to laugh.\nBut she couldn\u2019t."
