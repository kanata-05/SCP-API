Personnel are cautioned to use discretion when discussing classified information while SCP-5489 is unaccounted for. When SCP-5489 is located, personnel are to pretend to be oblivious to the anomaly and use designated hand signal to notify site security. Security will determine on a case-by-case basis whether to move SCP-5489 from point of manifestation.\n\n\nEdit 10/12/1996:\n SCP-5489 has currently taken residence in the Site-48 pool supply closet. Personnel are forbidden from discussing classified topics in pool area. Researcher Ustinov is instructed to continue counter-espionage campaign at least once per work day. Custodial staff have been instructed to refuse to acknowledge presence of SCP-5489 behind the locker.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5489 is a covert listening device created by GoI-16 which has infiltrated Site-48. SCP-5489 is a passive cavity resonator\n1\n with no power supply; when 'illuminated' by correct radio frequency identification\n2\n, audio data can be transmitted through SCP-5489 to a radio demodulator. Although this demodulator has never been recovered, and although ultra-high frequencies operate via line-of-sight propagation, it is believed that SCP-5489 is transmitting this data to points outside of Site-48. SCP-5489 is sapient, capable of spontaneous translocation, and cannot be contained at a fixed location. Item has the superficial appearance of a framed photograph of former US President Richard Nixon, which changes with every relocation event.\n\n\nAddendum- Incidents:\n Item was discovered on 05/25/1989 by Officer Gomez. Object identified by CCTV to have manifested within right main elevator platform at 13:02. Unknown if object had infiltrated site prior to this.\n\n\n\n\n05/25/1989\n\n\nLocation:\n Main Elevator\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Officer Tillerson, Officer Gomez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin transcript>\n\n\n\n\n<Officers Gomez and Tillerson enter elevator.>\n\n\nOfficer Tillerson:\n \u2026 So don't bitch at me about not getting you anything, you can go down to the break room yourself.\n\n\nOfficer Gomez:\n Okay, it's nothing.\n\n\n<Officer Gomez makes visual contact with SCP-5489.>\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\nGomez:\n Hey, when did they put up a photo of Dick?\n\n\nTillerson:\n What?\n\n\n<SCP-5489 translocates, leaving no trace.>\n\n\nGomez:\n What?\n\n\n\n\n<End transcript>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Officers reported event as a containment breach or potential reality restructuring.\n\nItem was identified by search team multiple times with similar translocations as a result.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/25/1989\n\n\nLocation:\n Evacuation Route A\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Commanding Officer Ian, Officer Rogan, Technician Sweikart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin transcript>\n\n\n\n\n<Technician Sweikart and Officer Rogan are participating in the search for uncontained anomaly. Officer Rogan makes visual contact with anomaly.>\n\n\nRogan:\n Okay, clear.\n\n\n<Officer Rogan pages C.O. Ian and Tech Sweikart the following message: \"anom between portraits in evac\". Sweikart and Rogan vacate the vicinity and begin taking readings across the spectrum.>\n\n\nSweikart:\n \n[Whisper]\n No radiation from here. No heat.\n\n\nRogan:\n \n[Whisper]\n Do we get closer?\n\n\nSweikart:\n \n[Whisper]\n No, wait for C-O.\n\n\n<Pause.>\n\n\nRogan:\n \n[Whisper]\n I'm getting closer.\n\n\n<Officer Rogan nonchalantly enters room. Radiation instruments do not spike, and Technician Sweikart enters for further readings.>\n\n\nSweikart:\n So, uh\u2026 This hallway's really cozy, I think. Am I allowed to loiter here, normally, officer?\n\n\nRogan:\n Oh yes that is normal, with your normal radio.\n\n\n<Technician Sweikart cycles the dial on his demodulator. Eventually, he reaches a signal which broadcasts both the audio from within Evac Route A as well as an unknown female speaking Russian. Technician pages Officer Rogan, two feet away, \"should we get ustinov\".>\n\n\nIan:\n \n[Entering]\n Alright, which picture is the little shit?\n\n\n<SCP-5489 translocates, leaving no trace.>\n\n\nRogan:\n God dammit!\n\n\n\n\n<End transcript>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Data gathered-\n\n\n\n\nItem does not emit radiation or heat;\n\n\nItem has an internal cavity;\n\n\nItem only responds to tactile and acoustic stimulus\n\n\nItem continued to broadcast on same frequency after translocation\n\n\n\n\nObject relocated to Research Office C#6.

It's GRU alright. Straight said it.\n\n\n<Pause for more counter-espionage.>\n\n\nUstinov:\n \n[Whisper]\n Yelled it. One of them is named Searchlight. Pissed that we're looking for their mole.\n\n\nIan:\n What the hell do they want here?\n\n\n<Pause for more counter-espionage.>\n\n\nUstinov:\n \n[Whisper]\n Okay, the other guy is done yelling.

No little mice on that channel. Yet.\n\n\n<Radio silence.>\n\n\nUstinov:\n [RU] Searchlight, hurry, before they find your spot again.\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\n<Radio silence.>\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n [RU] \u2026 Who is speaking?\n\n\nUstinov:\n [RU] My designation cannot be disclosed.

A lot of socializing here. A lot of people with their guards down.\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n Alright, as you say. When will Makerelov be here?\n\n\nUstinov:\n Oh, we'll see. You have a much easier time infiltrating this place, agent. Sit still. And please don't talk to Yuliy. He's also in on it, I've learned.\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n \nYuliy\n too!? That's the entire comms team!\n\n\nUstinov:\n Don't you think I'm as devastated as you?\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n Why haven't you just gone to the higher ups? Just tell them our secure frequency.\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\nUstinov:\n I think it's better to lay low and keep our comms between you and me. I don't even have much confidence in Makerelov. If they find out that we found out, they could go to higher ups first. Let me find someone we can \nreally\n confide in.\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n I can wait.\n\n\nUstinov:\n Stay in touch. I only trust one person.

The project heads had an automated message. Telling me to look out for a triple agent who they know only as Dennis Ustinov. And I realized, it was you. You're not a combat engineer. You're an accountant.\n\n\nUstinov:\n No, Searchlight. Please don't tell me they've turned you. They're enemies of our Union!\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n I thought you were my \ntovarich\n.\n\n\n<SCP-5489 translocates, leaving no trace.

She's undercover. It's not like she's actually the president either.\n\n\nRogan:\n Well, okay.\n\n\nUstinov:\n She's supposed to be looking into a sleeper agent-supersoldier program we're supposedly developing.\n\n\nRogan:\n \nUs?\n\n\nUstinov:\n No, they're called the Reinforcers or something.

Yuliy was the last to go. They're all mercs, every single one. No dedication to a cause, not even this so-called \"insurgency\" they want me to defect to. \nNyet!\n\n\nUstinov:\n Well don't you feel late to the party.\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n Don't tell me you're jaded too.\n\n\nUstinov:\n I wouldn't tell you that.

As far as I know, Mr. A. Imalitovich isn't coming in today.\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n To think all these years, and I never noticed Sweikart was an insurgent.\n\n\nUstinov:\n Blindsided me too. Searchlight, can I ask?\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n What ask?\n\n\nUstinov:\n Just\u2026 Why Nixon?\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n Nixon was the proof of concept, you see. We were supposed to roll out the program in 1974. But he resigned, and we had to go back to the redesign stage. Wouldn't be covert if the picture on your coffee table was the wrong president. When Theremin did that, though, he couldn't get it to work on Ford, or Carter, or even that pig Reagan. Just Nixon. Cannot explain why. So, we're just kinda working with what we had.\n\n\nUstinov:\n I think it still worked well. They love Nixon.\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n \nDa.\n\n\nUstinov:\n Searchlight, I'm considering we enter deep cover. It's heating up between the Insurgents and the Foundation, right now we should be on the sidelines to that.\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5489:\n What do you consider deep cover?\n\n\n<Ustinov produces sleeves of vinyl records.>\n\n\nUstinov:\n You like rock and roll?\n\n\n\n\n<End transcript>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Technician Sweikart's personal record player relocated to Pool Supply Closet for ease of containment.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum- Reclassification:\n Object is reclassified to Integrated to formalize its function as a transmitter for the Site-48 Recreational Radio Channel.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
