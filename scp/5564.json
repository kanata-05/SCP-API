Discussion is not allowed in the close proximity of SCP-5564's containment chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5564 is the disembodied head of an unidentified male human. SCP-5564 does not decompose and despite its lack of vocal organs, it has the ability to speak.\n\n\nSCP-5564's anomalous properties will be triggered if all the following criteria are present:\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least two individuals (hereafter referred to as subjects) in SCP-5564's hearing distance.\n\n\nEach subject has a statement and these statements are opposing each other.\n\n\nBoth subjects believe that their statement is true.\n\n\n\n\nIf SCP-5564's anomalous properties are triggered it will say the following: \"The time for words is over. Let the deeds speak.\" When SCP-5564 finished the last sentence the environment around SCP-5564 and the subjects (regardless of the environment's size and composition) will transfigure into a 10 meters long and 5 meters wide football field, with all types of equipment that should be present on an average football field.\n\n\nSCP-5564 and the subjects will be in the middle of the field. Then they will start to play soccer while they use SCP-5564 instead of a ball. SCP-5564 will remain intact during the entire match. The match will end when one of the subjects scores ten goals. When the match is over the statement of the winner will be true, even if it was proven to be false before the match.\n\n\nThe subjects during the match unable to cheat and unable to let each other win. Only the two subjects and SCP-5564 remain on the football field during the match, other individuals won't be able to enter the field and intervene.\n\n\n\n\n\u25cfExperiment\u00a0log\u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject-A\n\n\nStatement-A\n\n\nSubject-B\n\n\nStatement-B\n\n\nWinner\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-8567 who suffers from Cotard delusion.\n1\n\n\nD-8567 is deceased.\n\n\nDr. Loom, on-site psychologist.\n\n\nD-8567 is alive.\n\n\nD-8567\n\n\nD-8567 has no vital signs, but he is still conscious and able to move his body parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kraf, Site-19 personnel who suffers from lung cancer.\n\n\nDr. Kraf has lung cancer.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Jum. Before the test, he was informed that Dr. Kraf has no lung cancer, he just believes he has it because of hypochondria.\n\n\nDr. Kraf doesn't have lung cancer, it's just hypochondria.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Jum\n\n\nThe malignant cell growths in Dr. Kraf's lungs are no longer present, but Dr. Kraf believes he still has lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bonjaro\n\n\nIt is unacceptable for D-Class personnel to call Foundation personnel \"doc\".\n\n\nD-1462\n\n\nIt is acceptable to call Foundation personal \"doc\".\n\n\nD-1462\n\n\nSeveral D-Class personnel has a tendency to refer to Foundation personnel as \u201cdoc\u201d since D-1462 won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-8567\n\n\nD-8567 is deceased.\n\n\nResearcher K\u0151me, member of Site-228's soccer team and he has no information about the previous test with D-8567.\n\n\nD-8567 is alive.\n\n\nResearcher K\u0151me\n\n\nD-8567 has vital signs again, but the Cotard delusion is still present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0Interview\u00a0log\u00a0\u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5564\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Cren\n\n\n\n\n[Begin log]\n\n\nDr. Cren:\n First of all, let's start with a simple question.
