In the case of a major infection, especially if documents or pamphlets encourage the worship of Mesoamerican deities, along with armed uprising, Protocol 1907 \"Rio Blanco\" is to be enacted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2155 is a memetic cognitohazard, which makes anyone infected believe in the existence of a \"Government of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in Exile\", designated SCP-2155-1.\n\n\nGiven that more than 450 years have passed since the fall of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, the actual existence of SCP-2155-1 is considered highly improbable.\n \nUnder Revision, see addendum E525 -Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDepending on the ethnicity and nationality of those infected, it is estimated that between 35% and 90% of those infected will become sympathetic to the cause espoused by the documents containing SCP-2155. Those that remain neutral or hostile to the cause become asymptomatic carriers\n1\n.\n\nNotably, the discussion of SCP-2155-1 by non carriers, does not cause infection.\n\n\nThe rest of the infected subjects, if left untreated, will actively attempt to spread SCP-2155 through word of mouth, pamphlets, impromptu public speeches, and more recently, websites and social media postings. Documents spreading SCP-2155 have been detected in N\u00e1huatl, Spanish, English, Mandarin and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nMost such documents claim that the heirs to the Mexican Empire, along with a sizable portion of the priesthood and warrior castes, went into hiding in 15\u2588\u2588 and have waged a guerrilla war against the Spanish Empire first, and then the governments of Mexico, the United States of America, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Two recorded instances claimed that Maximilian of Hapsburg had brokered a marriage alliance with SCP-2155-1 but that he was killed before it could be finalized.\n\n\nMost documents containing SCP-2155 in the last decade refer to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 III, as the current \nHu\u0113y Tlahto\u0101ni\n, or emperor. Others may refer to other supposed leaders of the resistance, so-called \ntlahtoqueh\n, meaning \"speakers\" including \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nInformation between instances of SCP-2155 infections may be conflicting, but almost all of them denounce the \"oppression of the people by the European invaders\" and call all indigenous peoples of the continent to \"actively resist and hinder the usurpers.\" Documents have advocated actions ranging from passive resistance and hunger strikes, up to terrorist attacks, suicide bombings and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nDocuments containing SCP-2155 identify as \"the invaders\" all kinds of establishment organizations, including the governments of the territories claimed by SCP-2155-1, the Catholic Church, the major drug cartels and, on one recorded case, the Foundation.\n\n\nSome SCP-2155 containing documents claim that SCP-2155-1 has garnered the recognition and support of \"brethren sovereignties in resistance\" of such nations as Nuwaubia, Yamato Damashi, Bobo Ashanti or the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Interviews with members of these separatist groups have yielded no results so far.\n\n\nIf an infection vector is left alone for more than \u2588\u2588 days, the documents and speeches by SCP-2155 carriers will progressively become more complex and no longer be solely political in nature. Such websites and documents will start calling for the return to the worship of Mesoamerican deities, in particular Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopoctli.\n\n\nStarting in 19\u2588\u2588, an increasing number of SCP-2155 cases have called for the destruction of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Cathedral and for the establishment of a \"Temple of the Fifth Sun\"\n2\n to these deities. This has increased in the last decades as the main vector of infection has changed to online documents, instead of pamphlets and speeches.\n\n\nAddendum E525:\n According to document SCP-2155-E525, retrieved on October \u2588\u2588, 20\u2588\u2588, the leaders of SCP-2155-1 went into hiding in Mictl\u00e1n\n3\n and called for the resumption of worship at the Temple of the Fifth Sun and the restoration of \"the flower wars\" to provide suitable sacrifices to restore SCP-2155-1's power.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt\u00a0from\u00a0document\u00a0SCP-2155-E525\u00a0-\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0access\u00a0required.\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People of the Sun, race of bronze!\n\nDiscard your chains and break your bonds!\n\nYou are called into greatness, into the five pointed star!\n\nReject the white man, his god, his greed!\n\nTake the form of the nahual, and join us in the other side!\n\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED - POSSIBLE COGNITOHAZARD]\n\n\n\n\nHuitzilopochtli the warrior hummingbird thirsts for your blood!\n\nTlaloc who nourishes the earth rains his blessings upon you!\n\nCoatlique the snake is both your mother's womb and the grave!\n\nQuetzalc\u00f3atl the feathered serpent calls for you to follow him!\n\nTezcaltipoca the smoking mirror has many things to teach you!\"\n\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED - POSSIBLE COGNITOHAZARD]\n\n\n\n\nTloque Nahuaque!
