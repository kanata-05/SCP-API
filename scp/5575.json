Demolition Retribution\n\n\nMore by me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5575-A, mid-sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5575\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5575-A is to be contained and monitored at its location of discovery, under the supervision of MTF Theta-9 (\"Blast Processors\"). Operatives are to enforce a guarded perimeter around SCP-5575-A and divert approaching civilians under the cover of an ongoing excavation rendering the location hazardous to approach. All SCP-5575-B activity is to be monitored and recorded from an observation outpost established at a safe distance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5575 is an ongoing phenomenon surrounding an abandoned building\n1\n in Ontario, Canada, designated SCP-5575-A. A series of controlled detonations with no visible source, designated SCP-5575-B, will manifest in close proximity to and inside SCP-5575-A on a regular basis. These detonations are located adjacent to key load-bearing components of SCP-5575-A's structure, and will continue to manifest until SCP-5575-A has been entirely demolished, usually via a progressive collapse leading to complete implosion.\n\n\nFollowing its complete destruction, SCP-5575-A will begin to self-repair. Smaller pieces of debris have been observed to recombine gradually into larger aggregates, with walls reconstructing themselves around load-bearing components. This process will continue until SCP-5575-A has regained sufficient structural integrity to become free-standing. Subsequently, the overall physical characteristics of SCP-5575-A will have changed significantly from its prior appearance. Separate iterations of SCP-5575-A have displayed a wide variety of external and internal\n2\n differences, including:\n\n\n\n\na public library, all books consisting of nonsensical, randomized character sequences\n\n\na hospital, all hollow containers filled with a mixture of human blood and crude oil\n\n\na gymnasium, equipment displaying signs of significant damage from an blunt instrument\n\n\na movie theater, all films composed entirely of sinusoidal wave patterns and flashing colors\n\n\n\n\nThe full SCP-5575 sequence takes place over approximately 30 minutes. SCP-5575-B detonations will immediately resume following the complete reconstruction of SCP-5575-A. To date, Foundation intervention has invariably failed to interrupt the sequence of SCP-5575-B detonations or prevent the self-repair of SCP-5575-A. Current containment efforts consist of monitoring and logging all activity.\n\n\nURGENT CONTAINMENT UPDATE 03-09-2020:\n During the commencement of standard MTF Theta-9 monitoring operations on 03-09-2020, a partially corporeal humanoid entity composed of superheated air and airborne carbon particulates, designated SCP-5575-C, manifested on-site. SCP-5575-C physically obstructed the entrance to the monitoring site and displayed signs of sapience, complex thought and the capability for speech, verbally ordering MTF Theta-9 members to retreat and discouraging their approach with physical aggression.\n\n\nFollowing authorization, a diplomatically trained member of MTF Theta-9 was deployed to negotiate with SCP-5575-C. A transcript of the resulting interview is attached below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Theta-9 Negotiation Specialist Ashleigh Holt\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-5575-C\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nHolt:\n Ashleigh Holt, beginning negotiations with hostile anomalous entity.

You people and your \nlogic.\n \n(Entity gestures dismissively and audibly scoffs.)\n Won't get you very far in the real world, that sort of thing. Trust me, with the unthinkable things that piece of concrete scum has done, it deserves every second of what we're doing to it, and it always will. This is what\u2019s right, what\u2019s just. Now will you lot get out of here?\n\n\nHolt:\n I'm still not certain I understand how you're inflicting pain on an inanimate building, but I'll choose to humor you.
