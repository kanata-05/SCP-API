SCP-4547 was formerly the home planet of the taronyu, a sapient humanoid alien species, prior to an FK-Class (\"Broken Foundation\") Scenario\n1\n that caused their extinction.\n\n\nWhile SCP-4547 itself is nonanomalous, it is host to a large number of anomalous phenomena, affording its designation as an SCP object. These phenomena have been divided into two categories, SCP-4547-B and SCP-4547-C, which are detailed below.\n\n\nRadio signals sent by the taronyu were recorded by Foundation assets on Earth beginning in 1942. Foundation intervention to conceal these transmissions was successful and kept public knowledge of SCP-4547 to a minimum. However, transmissions abruptly ended in 1991, with no further signals being received past this point.\n\n\nDuring the initial advances into interstellar travel by the Foundation, it was decided that SCP-4547 would be visited, in order to ascertain the reasons for the lack of continued transmission, and the potential for a life-bearing planet. SCP-4547 was one of the first exoplanets visited by the Foundation during this time.\n\n\nThe taronyu\n2\n are a sapient alien species with humanoid body structure. While not inherently anomalous, all taronyu currently on the surface of SCP-4547 have become anomalous, with the majority having been converted into SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6.\n\n\nAn organization referred to as the T\u00echawnum\n3\n existed on SCP-4547, with roughly analogous motives to the Foundation on Earth. The T\u00echawnum was dedicated to the general focus of protecting taronyu society and life, including against dangerous anomalies. However, the T\u00echawnum did not share in the same practices of Masquerade and concealment as the Foundation, leading to higher integration of anomalies into SCP-4547 culture.\n\n\nSCP-4547-B is a collection of anomalous phenomena located on SCP-4547 which resulted in the near-total extinction of the taronyu. Each SCP-4547-B phenomenon caused a distinct K-Class Scenario on SCP-4547. The majority of these K-Class Scenarios are either the cause or result of an FK-Class (Broken Foundation) Scenario and have been collectively grouped into the one designation. For the purpose of brevity, only the conclusively identified K-Class Scenarios and their causes have been listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nK-Class Scenario\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B1\n\n\n\n\nIK\n\n\nSocietal Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Dead Hand\" system of a major taronyu world superpower, designed to ensure mutually assured destruction. However, upon a transition between heads of state, SCP-4547-B1 malfunctioned and detected the end of the government and initiated nuclear war.\n\n\nThe resultant nuclear war lasted for approximately five hours. By the conclusion of the war, over ten thousand nuclear weapons had been detonated upon SCP-4547, destroying most bases of the T\u00echawnum and most major metropolitan areas, in addition to causing severe nuclear fallout.\n\n\nThe exact functioning mechanics of SCP-4547-B1 are unknown, but is believed to have functioned using a \ndemonic solid-state drive\n set to monitor for specific parameters. These parameters were set too specific, and a minor change in government triggered the dead hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B2\n\n\n\n\nRK\n\n\nOut-Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4547-B2 was a collection of organic nanites designed to improve taronyu anatomy. However, difficulties in implementing these improvements caused partial brain death, increased aggression, inhibition of social norms and cannibalistic impulses in the infected (termed SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6). Furthermore, SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6 were able to enter stasis indefinitely, negating the need to breathe or eat.\n\n\nThe T\u00echawnum had kept a small sample of SCP-4547-B2, which was released during the IK-Class Scenario and became airborne. In the days following the IK-Class Scenario, 49% of taronyu on SCP-4547 became infected with SCP-4547-B2. As a result, there are currently an estimated 1-2 billion SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6 instances remaining on SCP-4547 at present.\n\n\nSCP-4547-B2 is capable of infecting humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B3\n\n\n\n\nGK\n\n\nBroken Greenhouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4547-B3 was a large glass orrery of the SCP-4547 solar system. When not properly aligned, it would project a noncorporeal herbicidal field, destroying local xenoplant matter. This field would expand based upon the amount of time spent unaligned. SCP-4547-B3 was previously maintained by the T\u00echawnum, but this maintenance stopped when they were destroyed.\n\n\nAs a result, all xenoplant life on SCP-4547 was rapidly killed off within three weeks of the IK-Class Scenario. Attempts to realign SCP-4547-B3 by T\u00echawnum remnants appear to have been attempted, but were unsuccessful. It is currently not believed that SCP-4547-B3 can be repaired, and transport is forbidden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B4\n\n\n\n\nXK-\u03a9\n\n\nEschaton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B4 was a collection of seven humanoid entities standing 500 meters tall, bearing noted similarity to \nSCP-\u2588\u2588\n. All SCP-4547-B4 had been in a dormant state prior to the activation of SCP-4547-B1, and were targeted with nuclear missiles in a neutralization attempt during the IK-Class Scenario. These nuclear weapons did not kill any SCP-4547-B4 instances and only awakened them.\n\n\nThe SCP-4547-B4 identified themselves as the Kive'eveng Tun Koren,\n4\n and took control of the remnants of taronyu society. They granted an anomalous resistance to many of the anomalous phenomena on SCP-4547 to any taronyu that served them.\n\n\nAll SCP-4547-B4 instances appeared to have entered into a war with each other at some point following their reawakening. All except one perished in this conflict; one of the losers was infected with SCP-4547-B2 and is currently active in a diminished capacity. The sole victor (SCP-4547-B4-3) is one of the few remaining sapient lifeforms on SCP-4547.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B5\n\n\n\n\nAK\n\n\nMadness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intensely virulent memetic cult, centered around the number \nfive\n. The exact origin of SCP-4547-B5 is unknown, but similar organizations were observed by the T\u00echawnum prior to the end of the world. It is believed that these organizations heavily mutated following another K-Class Scenario, becoming SCP-4547-B5.\n\n\nSCP-4547-B4-5 became infected with SCP-4547-B5, altering the details of its cult in order to follow the principles of SCP-4547-B5.\n\n\nFurther research has indicated [\nLETHAL INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4547-B6\n\n\n\n\nWK\n\n\nMeteorological\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4547-B6 was an apex-tier pluripotent entity inimical to atmospheric conditions on SCP-4547. It is unclear how specifically, but SCP-4547-B6 was neutralized during the interchange of SCP-4547-B1.\n\n\nImmediately following this, weather conditions of SCP-4547 greatly changed, with violent and intense meteorological events being observed at a high frequency. This included abnormally large storms, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and spontaneously generated hurricanes. These phenomena have not abated in the time between the neutralization of SCP-4547-B6 and present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 70% of the society of SCP-4547 immediately died during the IK-Class Scenario initiated by SCP-4547-B1, and with another 20% dying shortly after as a result of the WK-Class Scenario caused by SCP-4547-B6. A large majority of these casualties were reanimated as SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6 instances.\n\n\nOne year after the FK-Class Scenario, the remaining population of SCP-4547 was in the service of an SCP-4547-B4 instance, practicing cannibalism as a result of the complete famine caused by SCP-4547-B3.\n\n\nApproximately five years after the FK-Class Scenario, the last taronyu on the surface of SCP-4547 died. At this point, almost all life on SCP-4547 was dead. The remaining life was predominately highly anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-4547-C are all anomalous phenomena on SCP-4547 that are not included in SCP-4547-B. The majority of these phenomena are neutralized or destroyed following the collective effects of SCP-4547-B, but a limited number have been recovered. The majority remain on SCP-4547 and are not expected to require containment in any capacity.\n\n\nThe most notable of these is SCP-4547-C1, a now extinct xenoplant species that formerly possessed sapience and psionic abilities. When consumed by a taronyu, SCP-4547-C1 enhanced the psionic capacity of the consumer. SCP-4547-C1 was widely recognized on SCP-4547 as another intelligent life-form and highly integrated into society. However, SCP-4547-C1 was completely killed off by the effects of SCP-4547-B3.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4547-1: Exploratory Mission Transcripts from SCP-4547\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Exploratory\u00a0Mission\u00a04547.1,\u00a0Codename:\u00a0Battlefield\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nFirst SCP-4547 Exploration\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n August 25th, 2032\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Interstellar Task Force Aleph-Four (\"Flectere Si Nequimus Superos\")\n\n\nMission Abstract:\n Initial exploration of SCP-4547. Orbital imaging had previously shown that SCP-4547 had experienced multiple K-Class scenarios, but exact details of surface conditions were unknown. ITF \u2135-4 was deployed from the SCPS \nTiberius\n from orbit to the surface of SCP-4547. \nFetch.aic\n, the onboard .aic, continued to operate the ship.\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Acheron\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Abaddon, Xibalba, Naraka, Pluto\n\n\nCommand:\n Fetch.aic\n\n\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n Beginning audio transcription of all radio content.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Thanks, Fetch. Radios on. Team roster consists of me, Acheron, as leader; Abaddon watching the front and biology; Xibalba for technical problems; Naraka to handle any potential first contact; and Pluto watching our six and performing geochemistry analysis.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n And I shall be reachable, if necessary.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n Opening landing pod bay doors in five. We should have eight hours of oxygen in our armor, assuming everything goes well. If something goes wrong, we can remotely call the pod for exit.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Let's hope it doesn't.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 assembles in the pod bay, preparing for exit. The pod bay doors open onto a heavily ruined city-scape.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Remember that the atmosphere is breathable, but contains some unknown pathogens, potentially anomalous.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n This is a rather advanced culture, just judging from the architecture. Near-total destruction, however. Looks like there were riots towards their end.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Remember to take photos, as many as possible.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Let's go down this main street? Doesn't seem to be any major features of note anywhere around here.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Agreed. Let's march.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 walks down the streets of the city. There is large-scale ruin, with most buildings in a state of serious disrepair. There appears to be no sign of any inhabitants.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n How long did they say it was since the end of the world?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n The signals we received on Earth ended in the early '90s. It's fifteen light-years out, and radio travels at light speed, so the world probably ended in 1975. About sixty years ago, it seems.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Looks like even if there were survivors from the initial fallout, then they wouldn't have made it to today. This is an angry planet.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n The weather looked violent. Storms the size of continents.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Let's keep going. The forecast Fetch made for us should be clear for the hours we're in the city.\n\n\nThe team advances through the city, before stopping before a large building.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Hold on. That sign is in Ortothan. I can read it.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Ortothan? Is that a Church of the Second Hytoth? We should check the building out.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Looks like it worships the Koru-teusa, but it's not the same religion exactly. Like different sects of Christianity, you know?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Of course, the difference between Greek and Roman religions. Pluto and Hades, Avernus and Acheron.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 enters the Ortothan building. Inside, there are several large murals depicting scenes from Ortothan mythology, such as the creation of the Second Hytoth, the death of several of the Koru-Teusa, and the Voruteut.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Pretty. Remarkable these have all survived with only a bit of weathering.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n It's indoors and the building's held up. Looks like the storms haven't been enough to break it. And what else would?\n\n\nNaraka enters a back room of the church and emerges with several bound books.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Found these in the back, they're in Ortothan. Pluto, do you have any material cases?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Yep. Let me unclip one, Fetch can deploy a drone to pick them up and bring them to the pod.\n\n\nNaraka and Pluto place the books into a material case, place it in the middle of the street outside of the church, and signal to Fetch.aic to send a retrieval drone.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Hopefully we'll be able to use those as a Rosetta stone. At the very least, some information we're capable of reading will be helpful.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Good catch. We are limited on time, so we should keep going.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Yes sir.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 continues on their exploration of the city, proceeding until they find a large mass of taronyu bodies, which are assembled in a large pile.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Oh dear.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Well, here are some of SCP-4547-A, it looks like. Not much to speak of.\n\n\nA headless corpse twitches a leg. The rest of the corpse pile begins to move and animate. However, the majority of the corpses have suffered severe bodily trauma, and few are able to stand. Those that cannot stand attempt to pull themselves towards ITF \u2135-4.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Fuck!\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n First bogeys, eyes up, keep sharp!\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Intelligence said there were zombies, didn't it?\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n My drones did find such. They weren't exactly \"zombies\", but highly similar. Reanimated corpses, no higher mental function, violent and cannibalistic tendencies.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Light 'em up! Go!\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon and \u2135-4 Pluto begin firing munitions into the mass of SCP-4547-B2-\u03b6, targeting the few that are able to stand. All instances that pose a significant threat to ITF \u2135-4 are dispatched in the first three seconds of combat.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n Kind of pathetic, isn't it?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Is this all that's left of SCP-4547-A?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon and \u2135-4 Pluto finish dispatching any animate corpses in the following five seconds. Abaddon then fires an explosive round into the mass of corpses.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n That should be enough.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Let's keep moving.\n\n\nUpon turning the corner, ITF \u2135-4 sees a large, vaguely-reptilian creature. It is four-legged, with a skeletal head not covered in the scales the rest of the creature is. Similarity is noted between this entity and \nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n. The entity sniffs the air, before rising from a seated position and walking towards ITF \u2135-4.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Shit. Go!\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 hurries into one of the abandoned skyscrapers, hurrying to an opened stairwell. They rapidly ascend the steps, occasionally looking behind them. Upon arriving on the fifth floor, they exit the stairwell.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n I'm going to take a look back outside.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Be careful.\n\n\nPluto crawls to the closest window and looks outside. The entity is on the street, walking. It does not appear to notice Pluto. After some time, it lays down in front of the building. Pluto returns to the main group.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n It's in front of the building right now, looks like it's laying down for the moment. We'll be in here for a while it seems, but it's non-aggressive at the moment.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n We only have three hours of oxygen left, and it seems like about an hour to get back to the lander.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n Would you like an extraction?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n That'd be great, Fetch.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n Please proceed to the roof of the building. The lander will be in place in twenty minutes.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n You heard them. Let's go up.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 continues to ascend the stairs of the main building. As they do so, they occasionally stop to look around the floors. They collect several documents and notes. None of these brief excursions yields notable results until the fourth.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Hey team, I think I see something on the horizon.\n\n\nThrough one of the windows, a distant figure is visible. The figure is vaguely humanoid, although with large, branching horns resembling tree branches. The horns on one side of the figure's head have been damaged and broken off. Given the apparent distance of the figure, it is estimated to be 500 meters tall. This figure has since been identified as SCP-4547-B4-3.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Shit, that thing has to be as tall as the skyscraper.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Looks like it's walking towards us.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Do we have anywhere near enough laser to fight that thing?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n No. We most certainly do not. We need to evac before it reaches the city, hopefully sooner. Let's go.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Even more reason to get out of here soon. Total apocalypse world, this place.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Nothing but cockroaches left. The zombie cockroaches, even, and not even strong ones.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 finishes their ascent and meets the landing pod on the roof of the building. Fetch.aic pilots the pod back to the SCPS\n Tiberius\n. ITF \u2135-4 debriefs and begins analysis of collected samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Exploratory\u00a0Mission\u00a04547.4,\u00a0Codename:\u00a0Sepulchre\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nFourth SCP-4547 Exploration\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n September 2nd, 2032\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Interstellar Task Force Aleph-Four (\"Flectere Si Nequimus Superos\")\n\n\nMission Abstract:\n Exploratory Mission 4547.3 had yielded information on the coordinates of a potential unbreached T\u00echawnum bunker. ITF \u2135-4 was deployed to breach the bunker and recover information from within.\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Acheron\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Abaddon, Xibalba, Naraka, Pluto\n\n\nMission Command:\n Fetch.aic\n\n\n\n\nThe members of ITF \u2135-4 are assembled inside of the entrance to a T\u00echawnum bunker. The surface landing pod is positioned next to the bunker doors, which are embedded into a mountain.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n When will we be ready to proceed?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n I've interfaced with the door, and Fetch has a connection.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n I should be able to open the bunker in fifteen minutes. The cryptography is not advanced.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n And we can wait in the pod until then?\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n Yes.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 waits in the bay of the landing pod. Wind speeds in the area rapidly begin to intensify, and precipitation increases. The precipitation is noted to measure at 3\u00a0pH.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n The door has been unlocked. I will open it when you approach.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 emerges from the landing pod, and rushes towards the door of the bunker, which open as soon as they approach. They quickly enter, and the doors shut behind them. They are standing in a large airlock.\n\n\nFetch.aic:\n I will cycle the airlock.\n\n\nFetch.aic activates the airlock, cycling air from the outside. A liquid of unknown utility (most likely a disinfectant) is sprayed onto ITF \u2135-4, and then washed off. A computerized voice begins playing in the airlock.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n There was a Church of the Second Hytoth outside, right?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Archeron:\n Yeah, there was. Why?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \n\u2135-4 Naraka begins to speak Ortothan. For clarity, Ortothan will use an alternative typeface and color.\n \nDo you speak Ortothan?\n\n\nUnknown AI:\n \nOrtothan recognized. Taronyu identity confirmed. Reality levels within acceptable bounds. No anomalies detected. Access granted, following Contingency 913.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n We're in. It's accepting us as SCP-4547-A of this planet, apparently. I guess whoever programmed it with Ortothan didn't realize it was extraterrestrial.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Perfect.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n And I didn't even need to hack it.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Just social engineering.\n\n\nThe airlock automated door cycles open, allowing ITF \u2135-4 to enter the main bunker. Lights begin to turn on in multiple directions, revealing a large central computer terminal. Several monitors activate, displaying hallways, presumably within the facility.\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nWelcome to Bunker-00003, primary T\u00echawnum installation, safeguarding the future of the taronyu. I am Srungsiyu, an artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Is the air in here breathable?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n Probably. I'll deploy a sensor to see if it is or not.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n What do you think this place is for?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Let's find out. \nWhat is the purpose of this installation?\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nBunker-00003 is a secondary defense against the end of the world. It is designed to allow taronyu society to continue following the reestablishment of global order, in coordination with a series of nine other bunkers.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Looks like it's a doomsday bunker of sorts. Let them restart society. Part of a set of nine.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Other bunkers? Any of those ones still active?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nHow many bunkers of this kind are still functional?\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nZero other bunkers are functional. Bunker-00003 is the only unbreached bunker.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n This is the only one that's left, of course. Everything else was breached and destroyed.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n What was this bunker's role in restarting the world? Did they have unique ones?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nWhat is the purpose of this bunker?\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nThis bunker is meant for the preservation of taronyu, so that when the other bunkers have successfully completed their roles, population levels can be restored.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Basic survival, it seems. Holds a population of SCP-4547-A for their eventual repopulation of the planet.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Doesn't look like there's anybody around. Nothing on any of the monitors, no trace of anything.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n I wonder what we could do from here. Fetch might be able to interface with the computers, but if this AI is here, then it might be dangerous to risk it.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Agreed. We're not risking Fetch against another AI, especially when they can't communicate with them.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n Well, let's see what we can do in here, then. Any systems remaining?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nList functioning systems.\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nFunctional systems: Power. Lights. Defenses. Suspended animation. Computer systems. Artificial intelligence. Surface diagnostics. Communications.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Hold on. \nSuspended animation? Can you display the system summary for the suspended animation on the monitors?\n\n\nThe computer monitors change to display footage of a suspended animation complex, consisting of several pods, each holding a single taronyu. Assorted information appears next to the footage, but little is intelligible to ITF \u2135-4.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n What are we looking at?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Xibalba:\n Are those stasis pods?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nHow many taronyu are in those pods?\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nOne hundred thousand taronyu are in suspended animation. Optimum capacity.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nFind one that speaks Ortothan, then give us a path to find them.\n\n\nLight strips on the floor light up with a green light, leading down into a hallway off the main computer bank.\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nFollow the green light strip.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Let's go. Srungsiyu is going to take us to a taronyu that can speak Ortothan, we need to get to them.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n A taronyu? Are those SCP-4547-A?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n That's what the AI is calling them.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n And the stasis pods are still functional, some of them?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n All of them!\n\n\n\u2135-4 Pluto:\n How many?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n A hundred thousand.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Xibalba, Pluto, go to the entrance, get in contact with Fetch. Give them an update: this isn't an exploratory mission anymore. It's a rescue now.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 splits into two groups. Pluto and Xibalba head back to the entrance, and reconvene with Fetch.aic, while Acheron, Naraka and Abaddon follow the green lights into the suspended animation chambers.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Abaddon:\n Holy fuck. There really are thousands. And not fucked up, like the zombies, or the mutants, or anything.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n I don't know what we're going to do. The ship doesn't have enough space for them, and we can't just leave them. I'm going to need to get in contact with ITF Command, and then probably escalate higher\u2026 This is Ethics Committee level.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Let's just focus on getting one out.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Yeah. One step at a time.\n\n\nThe green light path finishes in front of a taronyu in a suspended animation pod.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nWake them up.\n\n\nSrungsiyu:\n \nThey will wake up in one minute.\n\n\nThe chamber unseals, and the taronyu within steps outside. They are clutching their head as their eyes apparently adjust to the light. They have a short conversation with Srungsiyu in a native language, before turning to \u2135-4 Naraka.\n\n\nTaronyu:\n \nYou speak Ortothan?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nYes. The Koru-Teusa's message traveled far, and visited my world as well as your own. They taught us the holy tongue, which remains eternal.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nThen I must introduce myself. My name is Tayrangi Sas\u00eclpey, and I am the most senior personnel here who speaks Ortothan, apparently. Not highest overall, but\u2026\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nYes, I see. My name is Karishma Chadha. This is my commander, Jason Kriezis, and my teammate, Arthur Penton. We come from a world named Earth.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nYou stand on a world called Mo'ara. It is good to know that the gods have guided you to us. May they live eternal.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nGods\u2026 I am sorry. Yorun-leusan is dead. Only Rakmou-leusan remains.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nWhen did it happen?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nThirty-two years ago. It wasn't because of the loss of this world. They were swarmed by the Voruteut in the greatest invasion of the cosmos ever. Your planet wouldn't have saved them.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nI see. It's not well to dwell on the past. I must ask, however: Thirty-two years\u2026 How long have I been in stasis?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nBy our estimation, fifty-six years.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nThe T\u00echawnum has failed, then. You did not wake us up early. Is the world outside still ruined?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nUtterly. But we are going to do something about it. I don't know what yet, but we'll figure it out.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nDo you have any ideas?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka begins to speak, and then pauses. She turns to \u2135-4 Acheron and speaks after a few seconds of silence.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Jason, what are you planning?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n Bring them to Earth. Only sane thing to do.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n Can we do that? Will we be able to?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n If we need to show up on the Foundation's door with thousands of refugees, that's what we'll do. This world is dead, and I know of an entire solar system of thriving planets.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n What if we can't convince the higher-ups? What then?\n\n\n\u2135-4 Acheron:\n \nFlectere si nequeo superos, acheronta movebo.\n If I cannot bend the will of Heaven, then I will raise Hell. I don't care I have to bring the fucking Insurgency here. They're coming to Earth.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka looks back at Tayrangi Sas\u00eclpey.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nWe're going to take you back home. Our home. They're the only living worlds we know of.\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nRakmou-leusan guided you here, I know it. I have faith in vis plans. Do whatever you must.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka:\n \nWe might have to spend some time consulting our superiors, and I do not know if they-\n\n\nTayrangi Sas\u00eclpey:\n \nThen go, beseech them. I have siblings to rouse.\n\n\n\u2135-4 Naraka summarizes her conversation to the other members of ITF \u2135-4. They say goodbye to Tayrangi Sas\u00eclpey, and then leave. Tayrangi Sas\u00eclpey is observed in the background awakening more taronyu from suspended animation as they depart.\n\n\nITF \u2135-4 reconvenes on the SCPS\n Tiberius\n, and begins preparations to contact Interstellar Task Force Command, the Ethics Committee and the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4547-2: Deliberations on Findings of Exploratory Mission 4547.4\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Summation\u00a0of\u00a0Decision\u00a0E/O-71-T\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint Ethics Committee / O5-Council Decision #71 - Taronyu\n\n\nOn the recovery and integration of the taronyu into society\n\n\n\n\nResolved:\n September 9th, 2032\n\n\nPrimary Deliberators:\n EC-1, EC-4, EC-13, O5-3, O5-7, O5-10\n\n\nIssue:\n Action to take concerning the recently discovered \"taronyu\" endemic to SCP-4547. Individuals are a non-anomalous sapient species, but the only forms of transit between Earth and SCP-4547 are both anomalous and have been concealed by the Foundation.\n\n\nVerdict:\n Covertly aid taronyu in interstellar transit to Earth, with a cover story attributing their arrival as purely their own action. Following their arrival in the Sol System, publicly aid their integration efforts into baseline society, with help of agencies such as Manna Charitable Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nThe unanimous conclusion of the Ethics Committee (13-0) following the discovery of 100,000 living taronyu in a former T\u00echawnum bunker was that humanitarian aid was to be delivered to SCP-4547 and to assist the surviving taronyu.\n\n\nHowever, current secrecy protocols concerning interstellar travel complicated this decision. The public is not currently aware of Foundation involvement beyond the solar system, and thus, Foundation involvement with the recovery of the taronyu could not be made public. However, there was no way to feasibly and ethically keep them concealed from the public eye \u2014 allowing them to work covertly in the Foundation alone would be a clear case of indentured servitude.\n\n\nThe O5 Council was unwilling to publicly reveal Foundation interstellar and faster-than-light travel methods, citing the potential dangers of unexplored space. The Ethics Committee agreed with the decision, concluding that such action could only be considered in case of an absolute last resort with no other options available.\n\n\nAnalysis of taronyu technology revealed a single fruitful option: the usage of SCP-4547-C1, a xenoplant with anomalous psionic properties when consumed. Using SCP-4547-C1 would allow for taronyu pilots to psionically locate Earth and guide taronyu vessels through subspace,\n5\n arriving at Earth within one month. Taronyu pilots would be able to travel through subspace by tracking the largest source of human neural oscillation patterns: Earth. This was not possible before the exposure of human neural oscillations to a taronyu operator in real space.\n\n\nA cover story would be disseminated that collected radio broadcasts from Earth allowed for the simulation of human neural oscillations, allowing the taronyu to use the above method without the physical presence of a human. The majority of taronyu would be given this cover story as well.\n\n\nThe O5 Council readily accepted the usage of SCP-4547-C1, as it does not introduce a generally applicable method of FTL transit into baseline society. Without the large presence of familiar sapient life in a destination, SCP-4547-C1 cannot be used to travel faster than light \u2014 therefore, it has no practical usage for exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4547-3: Ramifications of Decision E/O-71-T\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Cleared\u00a0for\u00a0Public\u00a0Consumption.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2040 Solar System Census Report\n\n\nTaronyu Population Demographics\n\n\n\n\nSummary Of:\n Statistics Regarding the Taronyu\n\n\nPrepared By:\n Foundation Census Department\n\n\nClearance Level:\n Public / General Consumption\n\n\nFull Report Available:\n April, 2112\n\n\n\n\nOverview:\n The taronyu are the fourth major sapient species to inhabit the Sol System and the only species not native to the system, following humanity, the now absent Venusians, and the Martians. Of these, they have one of the smallest populations and most unique cultures.\n\n\nTaronyu society primarily defines itself around the diaspora caused by the destruction of their home planet Mo'ara, which is distantly located from the Sol System. Due to the numerous K-Class Scenarios which have occurred on Mo'ara, it is not expected that any taronyu will ever return to their home planet, nor will any humans ever step foot on the planet.\n\n\nThese unique feelings of total loss, on a broad species level, have led to a distinct but thriving culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n# of Taronyu\n\n\nPercent of Total\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallisto\n\n\n57,391\n\n\n51.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars\n\n\n26,381\n\n\n23.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunar Korea\n\n\n12,789\n\n\n11.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshburn Station\n\n\n8,991\n\n\n8.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n5,421\n\n\n4.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Following their exodus from their home planet Mo'ara, the taronyu began to settle in the Sol System. As their arrival came during a period of rapid interplanetary colonization, it was common for taronyu to settle in growing or newly founded locations, rather than directly integrate into pre-existing societies.\n\n\nThis was primarily evident in the terraforming of Callisto, which was designed to mimic Mo'ara. It now serves as the primary home of taronyu society in the Sol System, having the only population and government that is majority taronyu.\n\n\nOther taronyu can be found elsewhere in the Sol System, although primarily in large groups and communities. Few taronyu have established permanent residence in locations that are primarily human or Martian. A small number are itinerant, similar to other low-population species.\n\n\nCulture:\n Taronyu culture can be described in broad strokes as having two primary focuses: the celebration of destroyed elements of taronyu/Mo'ara culture (such as annihilated societies or the physical landscape of Mo'ara) and efforts to ensure the continued survival of the taronyu species into the future. These have become the primary focus of the T\u00echawnum in the Sol System. As the majority of extant taronyu were directly affiliated with the T\u00echawnum, these goals are common throughout the species.\n\n\nAs a result of the first drive, there have been multiple taronyu art movements to commemorate Mo'ara, in a variety of forms. The largest of these have been an attempt at terraforming Callisto to mimic Mo'ara, which today serves as the largest location of taronyu in the Sol System.\n\n\nThe second drive results in an increased focus on family among taronyu, and results in a general tendency towards marriage and child-rearing. It must be noted at this point (for the benefit of human readers) that taronyu reproduction is significantly different from human, and that the taronyu have six biological sexes, each capable of reproducing with any of the other five sexes.\n\n\nThe majority of taronyu languages have gone extinct with only Vi'na, a lingua franca used by the T\u00echawnum, remaining in common usage. All living taronyu speak Vi'na, and other languages have only survived through recorded media and bilingual taronyu. Ortothan also remains popular among taronyu, although it has been growing in popularity in general in the Sol System.\n\n\nTaronyu society currently designates three distinct divisions of taronyu: \nlemrey\n taronyu (survivors, directly rescued from T\u00echawnum bunkers), \nlomtu\n taronyu (taronyu that perished on Mo'ara), and \nprrnen\n taronyu (taronyu born in the Sol System). Of these, prrnen taronyu are commonly viewed with great hope: few lemrey taronyu believed that there would be a future beyond Mo'ara. Of these, one of the most important is the seven-year-old \nTayrangi Karishma\n (named for the human to make first contact with the taronyu), the first taronyu born in Sol.\n\n\nReligion:\n The majority of the taronyu immigrants to the Sol System tend to follow an anomalous religion, with the majority following either the Church of the Second Hytoth or the Church of the Broken God. A smaller majority follow sects similar to The Children of the Scarlet King or Fifthism. Almost all of the latter category follow unique traditions, rather than pre-existing human conditions.\n\n\nTaronyu integration into human/Martian society was aided in large part by the Church of the Second Hytoth, the scripture of which was already well-accepting of other alien cultures. The prior existence of worship of the Koru-Teusa among the taronyu further aided in this, as it gave legitimacy to the belief system. The Church of the Second Hytoth offered large amounts of aid to taronyu refugees shortly after their arrival in the Sol System.\n\n\nThe same occurred in a similar capacity with the Church of the Broken God. However, polarizing differences between taronyu worship of Mekhane and human worship prevented full integration, leading to the formation of a fourth major denomination, commonly referred to as the \nLefngap Syura\n. It is distinguished by embracing advanced technology while completely rejecting the practice of augmentation.\n\n\nThe \nReypay 'Eveng\n (Blood Children) and \nMrrve Fp\u00eclfya\n (Fifth Philosophy) are similar to the Children of the Scarlet King and Fifthism, respectively. These two religions were uncommon among the taronyu prior to the destruction of Mo'ara, but have gained prominence following it. Followers typically profess to have converted because of the actions of the Kive 'Itan Tun Koren and the Mrrve Fp\u00eclfya on Mo'ara, during the eschaton.\n\n\nOf note is that the Reypay 'Eveng are significantly more peaceful and less violent than the Children of the Scarlet King, and do not share in the same eschatological beliefs as the latter. The Reypay 'Eveng state that this is because \"the world has already ended once: the Ruler's Spawn came into their kingdom and died on their throne.\"\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n The destruction of Mo'ara and nearly sixty years of suspended animation have had great impacts on taronyu society, but the species is generally described as hopeful, and dedicated to the continued survival of their race.\n\n\nIn the words of Tayrangi Sas\u00eclpey, the taronyu have traveled through great hardship to the stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
