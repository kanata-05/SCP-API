Foundation personnel have been embedded in the administration and moderation teams of said social media platforms to further monitor and restrict the spread of SCP-5273. Counter-Meme FCM-5273 instances are currently being developed on a case-by-case basis to diminish SCP-5273's effects and transmission.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5273 are widespread instances of text and image based memetic hazards, coloquially known as \"copypasta\". Instances of SCP-5273 usually depict the author's intense and often hyperbolic distaste for a certain topic of discussion.\n\n\nViewing an instance of SCP-5273 has a chance\n1\n of causing viewers to share a similar opinion as depicted in the instance. Affected individuals, referred to as SCP-5273-A, will then spread the SCP-5273 instance they were exposed to, usually by posting it as a response to social media posts relating to the topic critiqued in said instance.\n\n\nSCP-5273 instances often present themselves as ironic and humorous in nature, and satirize the topic being discussed. The object of SCP-5273 instances often pertains to popular media at the time of creation; however, a small percentage have been found to relate to more diverse concepts, such as leaving online communities, faith, humor etc.\n\n\nA small percentage of SCP-5273-A individuals\n2\n will adapt the instance they were exposed to, changing its topic and effectively creating a new SCP-5273 instance. Upon questioning, SCP-5273-A individuals will claim the reason for posting to be \"I thought it'd be funny\", \"I was just trolling\", or other similar phrases.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5273 was discovered after an instance had been attempted to be posted onto the SCiP-Net Social Forums. Memetic hazard detection systems alerted RAISA to the anomaly, where the spread was promptly halted. A non-anomalous version of the chat log is included below.\n\n\n\n\nNON-ANOMALOUS CHAT LOGS, SCP-5273 DISCOVERY\n\n\n\n\nOyyJoyy:\n so were the flamingoes hurt?\n\n\nMCon44:\n i dunno, he said that they were totally fine\n\n\nEcro89:\n yknow its pretty sus that he was near the flamingoes in the first place\n\n\nDrSilver:\n sus \ud83d\ude33\n\n\nEcro89:\n amoegus\n\n\nMCon44:\n [MEMETIC HAZARD CENSORED]\n\n\nSecretary_Helenbot:\n User \nMCon44\n has been kicked from the chat.

By further tracing his patterns, it was discovered that Researcher Connors posted the instance of SCP-5273 he was initially exposed to in the Reddit community \n\"r/CuratedTumblr\"\n. Further tracing has discovered over 100 unique instances of SCP-5273, with some of them originating on mainstream social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nInstance #2, found in \"r/curatedtumblr\" Reddit board\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Instance was found as a reply to a text comment in the post's comment section. The comment read as follows: \n\"A man with a pink cat? Watch out for random explosions\u2026\"\n.\n\n\nTopic:\n Serialized Manga Series \n\"JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5273 Instance:\n I hate JoJo fans. All they do is go onto random subreddit and go \u201ciS THat A JOJo ReFErEncE??!!!1\u201d on every single part of the internet that even has a slight resemblance to JoJo. Screw you. Everything isn't JoJo you baboon. A link to a video looks suspicious? JOJO REFERENCE! That's right, they've tried to replace rickrolls. Just shit on a classic piece of internet tradition. SHUT THE FUCK UP. NO ONE CARES ABOUT JOJO. LITERALLY NO ONE CARES, ITS A SHITTY SHOW FOR SHITTY PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO DIE A SHITTY DEATH. I AM GOING TO SEND EVERY JOJO FAN INTO SPACE.Oh, can't do that cuz it's A \nFUCKING\n JOJO REFERENCE, ISNT IT? Please, [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]. Every JoJo fan deserves to be disowned and shunned by society. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Comments:\n Instance received 567 \"upvotes\" and several replies commenting on the apparent humor of the instance. Observed to have spread to other similar posts on the Reddit platform, across several \"subreddit\" boards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #10, found in Facebook group \"not in my good satanic cul de sac\"\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Instance followed a series of posts criticizing the other members' stance on established religion, with the original poster dismissing the other members as \"godless heathens\" and \"devil worshippers\".\n3\n\n\nTopic:\n Leaving an online community\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5273 Instance:\n This group is a fetus eater's paradise, FUCK y'all I'm leaving, don't mind me, [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED] go protest for normalizing public nudity or some other absurd shit you want to normalize, maybe casual murder next? The future is full of surprises in the hands of the shallow brain dead left.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Comments:\n See Addendum 5273.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5273.3 - FCM-5273 Development:\n Instance #10 was deemed a high-risk, high-priority threat due to the possibility of SCP-5273-A subjects enacting actions described in the instance. As such, \nTask Force Hexa-9\n (\"Meme Machine\") was mobilized to develop a countermeasure as soon as possible. The result of TF Hexa-9's activity was a targeted counter-meme prototype that inhibited the viewers' susceptibility to cognitive manipulation by this specific SCP-5273 instance, rendering the instance ineffective (see Addendum 5273.4).\n\n\nWhile this particular application has shown adequate success in mitigating the respective SCP-5273 instance's effects, the same method is not applicable to cases with text posts originally longer than 500 characters. This is hypothesised to be due to the readers considering long text fragments as visually unappealing, with no incentive to read them if no new information is being presented. As a result, members of TF Hexa-9 have been assigned to developing alternative countermeasures under \"Project TL;DR\".\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a05273.4\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0FCM-5273\u00a0Prototype\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0FCM-5273\u00a0Prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49This\ud83d\udc48 gro\u24c2p is a \ud83d\udc7cfetus\ud83d\udc76 \ud83c\udf74eater's \ud83c\udf7d paradise \ud83c\udf08, FUCK \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc66\u200d\ud83d\udc66y'all \ud83d\udc6d I'm \u270c\ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2640\ufe0fleaving\ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, don't \u26d4 mind \ud83e\udde0 me, [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED] go\ud83d\udea6 protest \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f for \u2714normalizing\u2705 \ud83c\udfd9 public\u26f2 nudity\u274c\u274c\u274cor some o\ud83c\udd71er \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2642\ufe0fabsurd\ud83e\uddde \ud83d\udca9shit\ud83d\udca9 y\u2b55u want\ud83e\udd33 to nor\u24c2alize, maybe\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0ecasual \ud83d\udd2bmurder\ud83d\udde1 ne\u2716t?
