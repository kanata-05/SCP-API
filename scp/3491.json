No subject may come within a meter of SCP-3491 for more than 30 seconds unless proper equipment is provided.\n\n\nAll entities that have come within 50 centimeters of SCP-3491 must undergo decontamination procedures.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-3491 is a paper origami bird within a steel bird cage. SCP-3491 is suspended in the center of the cage by unknown means. Notably, one of SCP-3491's wing tips is slightly ripped.\n\n\nBeginning at a distance of 10 meters from the entity, electrons can be detected, increasing in energy between SCP-3491 and a human subject. This charge increases exponentially as the subject moves closer, until becoming dangerous to the subject. Overexposure to the charge produced by SCP-3491 can result in a concentrated burn at the vertical center of the individual.\n\n\nAttempts to remove SCP-3491 have been unsuccessful. Within five centimeters, the charge generated between an approaching object and SCP-3491 becomes strong enough to result in the complete dissolution of matter. This renders any protective material worn by subjects useless.\n\n\nNo components of SCP-3491 have sustained any damage following the generation of these intense electric charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3490\n | SCP-3491 | \nSCP-3492\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3491\n\" by dalopon, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
