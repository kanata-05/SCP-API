Any access to SCP-4632 is to be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any subjects that come in contact with SCP-4632 and reads its contents are to be monitored for a period lasting no more than forty-eight (48) hours, after which subjects are to be administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4632 is a set of twenty-four (24) memetic posters found in the city of Sheffield, England. After increasing reports of severe derealization disorder\n1\n cases in local psychiatric facilities, the Foundation recovered all 24 instances. Cross-examination of affected areas revealed that the number of SCP-4632 instances correlated with the number of derealization cases.\n\n\nWhen a human subject reads the contents of an SCP-4632 instance, the implantation of the following concept into the subconscious mind occurs: the current reality in which the subject lives is a dream. This effect initially manifests as a passing thought over time confusing the subject as derealization progresses. The progress of the anomaly is gradual, the median time for complete derealization is 12 to 18 months. Subjects with diagnosed mental illnesses prior to contact see an increased rate of derealization.\n\n\nAffected subjects are careless and as such show little to no interest in real-life events; justifying their disinterest by their purported dreaming state. Previously normal subjects affected by SCP-4632 have been seen engaging in activities such as extreme sports, violent crimes, reckless behavior, public indecency, and Class-A felonies.\n\n\nAny digital copies of any SCP-4632 instance exhibit no anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\nTESTING LOGS - SCP-4632\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-14802\n\n\nDescription:\n Subject was exposed to an SCP-4632 instance.\n\n\nTime since initial contact:\n 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\nDr. Klein:\n Please state how you are feeling, D-14802.\n\n\nD-14802:\n Fine?

The subject was detained without resistance and brought to Site-64 for interrogation. POI-4632's medical records show that he has been diagnosed with chronic clinical depression, schizoaffective disorder, and depersonalization disorder. He has a record of twenty-seven (27) involuntary hospitalizations for mental health-related crises.\n\n\nSubject displays low-level reality-bending abilities; he claims this is because he has gained control over his \"dream.\" It is hypothesized that extended exposure to SCP-4632's effects may contribute to slowly increasing ontokinetic abilities; due to the fact this is the only affected subject to display these types of abilities, he is considered the originator of SCP-4632.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4632-1\n\n\nHOSPITAL RECORDS - POI-4632\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPEN\n\n\n\n\nHIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo doctor matching the signature present was found to be working for \nHealthCare Home\n.

For the record, do you know why you're here?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Hello subconscious, are we talking again?!\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n This is an interview, yes. Again, do you know why you're here?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Cause I let you take me, I find that dreams are more interesting if you go with the flow, you know what I mean?\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n I do not. You believe this is a dream?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Of course it is, what else? I mean look around! The armored guys that brought me in told me this was \n\"The Foundation\"\n and that they \n\"contain anomalies and monsters or something.\"\n That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!\n\n\n\n\n[POI-4632 laughs.]\n\n\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n I mean that's some top-notch dream logic, right?\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n I see\u2026 why do you believe that?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Because reality is fucking boring, man! There's nothing fantastical about it, at all. No monsters or superheroes or\u2026 I don't fucking know\u2026 Krampus or something. None of this shit exists, you don't exist.\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n I definitely exist. Well, moving on\u2026 you were spotted posting instan-\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Look subconscious, come on. I'm already lucid, I know this is a dream and all of that, stop trying to convince me otherwise.\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n What exactly do you mean by lucid?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n I did the poster thing, a reality check! I printed those things so I would remember how to do it. It is clear that I am dreaming.\n\n\n\n\n[POI-4632 is seen materializing a cheeseburger and breaking his restraints without effort.]\n\n\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n What the-?! Command, you didn't tell me this was a reality bender!\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Dude, fucking relax, okay? None of this matters. Who the hell is Command anyways?\n\n\n\n\n[Command communicates to Agent Herrera through an earpiece, orders to not anger the subject.]\n\n\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n Yes\u2026 of course, this is a dream. I apologize.\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n There you go.\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n Forgive my memory. You have power over your dream of course but, what have you been doing with these abilities?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n The usual, you know. Getting with women I wouldn't have a chance with in real life. Getting all the things I've ever wanted. What else would you do if you had no consequences?\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n I am curious though, how did you realize this was a dream? As your subconscious I'm supposed to avoid that, you see.\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n You did a terrible job of that.\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n How so?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Look around you man, this is a place where we're in a giant dirt ball riding through space with no direction, a gigantic fucking fireball warms us and we have all of these arbitrary stupid rules, and now you mean to tell me monsters are real! And all the people in the dream do is run around trying their best to make their worthless lives mean something; the fucking money, the status, the power, the endless struggle to find safety. I shouldn't have to search for meaning, I shouldn't have to warn the others! I shouldn't have to stay in the house! I shouldn't need the pills or the doctors or anyone that can turn the\u2026 wait\u2026 what\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\n\n\n[POI-4632 is visibly confused.]\n\n\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n What\u2026 did I do to Clara?\n\n\nAgent Herrera:\n Who?\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n I didn't do that to my sister\u2026 I didn't do anything to Clara.\n\n\n\n\n[POI-4632 clutches its head as if in pain for several seconds.]\n\n\n\n\nPOI-4632:\n Where else would a reality like this exist\u2026 but in a bad dream?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent further progress of his abilities, POI-4632 was administered Class-E amnestics. The subject has not displayed any reality-bending abilities since.\n\n\n\nPOI-4632's legal records indicate it to have no living or dead siblings.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
