MTF Phi-7 (\"The Laughingstock\") is to investigate these discussions and make a determination for appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2571 is a recurring childhood memory of a non-existent theme-park ('Cragglewood Park'). It is estimated that 0.05% of the world's population is affected by SCP-2571; however, recent evidence suggests this number may be growing. The primary vector for SCP-2571's spread is not yet known \u2014 notably, it appears to be most common among adults raised as an only child.\n\n\nAfflicted subjects are initially responsive to amnestics, but memories regarding Cragglewood will typically resurface once treatment ceases. Although descriptions of these memories vary, several details remain consistent:\n\n\n\n\nSubjects were between the age of 4 and 12 when they visited.\n\n\nThe park featured numerous characters, primarily centered around anthropomorphic variants of trees and plants.\n\n\nNo adult supervision was present.\n\n\nCalliope music played throughout the park.\n\n\nSubjects attended the park with numerous other children, none of whom they knew.\n\n\nThe park featured only one ride; a carousel (or 'merry-go-round'). Although children accompanying the subjects boarded this ride, the subjects themselves did not.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations regarding the precise nature of both SCP-2571 and Cragglewood Park are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 2571.1:\n Interview Logs\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/2571/interviews/218.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2002/11/16\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Reiner\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Rupert Duccasoux\n\n\n\n\n[\nBEGIN LOG.\n]\n\n\nREINER:\n What do you recall about 'Cragglewood Park'?\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Jesus.
