Prior to SCP-4512's appearance, the space was approximately a third the size and occupied by a swing-set and the occupant's dog.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Attempts at containing SCP-4512 have previously been unsuccessful. Current containment procedures include the following process:\n\n\n\n\nFormation of Mobile Task Force Iota-9 \"Pool Boys\" to track all appearances of SCP-4512 and follow its demands.\n\n\nCreation of HL-LVR aka Hukilau Lover, a world wide web crawler to find any forum posts, news articles, social media posts, etc. pertaining to the appearance of SCP-4512.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4512 is a 40 square meter sapient swimming pool capable of instantaneous translocation. SCP-4512 exclusively manifests in the rear exterior spaces of homes\n2\n in landlocked areas and appears to specifically target the U.S state of Minnesota. During an SCP-4512 manifestation event, the rear exterior space of the home will anomalously expand if necessary to accommodate SCP-4512, at which point SCP-4512 will appear fully depressed into the ground. In 100% of all SCP-4512 manifestations, it has appeared filled with garbage, refuse, plant life, and various objects of unknown origin, regardless of its state of cleanliness prior to its previous demanifestation.\n\n\nObjects consistent across all SCP-4512 manifestations include imitation Hawaiian leis, plastic coconut shells, cocktail glasses, bathing suits, and sun lotion bottles.\n\n\nOther objects of note found within SCP-4512 include:\n\n\n\n\n1 Apple II Computer\n\n\n5 shirts with \"Metal and Soul\" written on the front in marker\n\n\n1 tattered Polish flag\n\n\n2 Motorolla cell phones\n\n\n4 bottles of Kirkland brand white wine (empty)\n\n\n1 bag of milk\n\n\n5 lunar rocks\n\n\n3 left boots dated to the 18th century\n\n\n16 grams of bonobo fur\n\n\n2 deceased swans\n\n\n1 copy of the novel \"Fargo\"\n\n\n2 dishwashers\n\n\n1 Foundation ID card\n\n\n29 saltwater crabs (deceased)\n\n\n\n\nOnce SCP-4512 has fully manifested, it will begin vocalizing\n3\n to nearby individuals in an attempt to persuade them to approach. If an individual does approach, SCP-4512 will engage in conversation with them, attempting to strike a bargain. This bargain will usually involve SCP-4512 giving up one or more items found within its water in exchange for the individual cleaning out the entirety of SCP-4512's interior.\n\n\nIf the individual refuses the initial offer, SCP-4512 will offer sequentially more valuable objects while vocalizations increase in outrage about the perceived injustice against it. These vocalizations will grow louder with time to an indefinite maximum. The highest recorded volume from SCP-4512 surpassed the ability for current measuring tools to document. However, the intensity has been recorded to cause an earthquake measured 5 on the Richter scale.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4512 has been cleaned to its satisfaction, a demanifestation event will occur. The space once occupying SCP-4512 will return to its previous dimensions with no lasting evidence of SCP-4512's occupation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4512-1: Containment Attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following lists all proposed and attempted containment procedures as well as their outcomes. Additionally, the date of the proposal and number of recorded instances of SCP-4512 manifesting in a new location\n4\n are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Click\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0credentials\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment Procedure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2000/12/8\n\n\nKnown Manifestation Count:\n 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Researcher Chevrolet\n\n\nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContaining SCP-4512 in a soundproof enclosure made of an experimental substance known to dampen 100% of sound waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt lasted approximately nine days and fourteen hours when SCP-4512's vocalizations reached over 200 decibels before surpassing intensities allowing for proper measurement. The volume eventually caused the containment material to sublimate resulting in multiple injuries to researchers as well as one death due to air embolism in the lungs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment Procedure 56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2003/10/10\n\n\nKnown Manifestation Count:\n 153\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Dr. Edward Wolfe\n\n\nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unorthodox procedure of filling SCP-4512 with refuse. Dr. Wolfe posits that this may cause the anomaly to become frustrated, containing itself and/or result in the possible threat of increased trash as motivation against further outbursts. The suggestion is approved by Dr. Lark and proceeds as planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately two tons of trash are dumped into SCP-4512 before its vocalizations increased in intensity to the point of collapsing the nearby structure before SCP-4512 spontaneously disappeared. It was found two months later in Bloomington, MN fully cleaned by unknown means and appeared to recognize Foundation Individuals directly involved with this containment attempt. All personnel directly involved have been reassigned in order to avoid further incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment Procedure 193\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2008/01/03\n\n\nKnown Manifestation Count:\n 505\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Director House\n\n\nDENIED\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a night club around the pool in order to drown out its vocalizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment Procedure 642\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2014/11/05\n\n\nKnown Manifestation Count:\n 2,101\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Director House\n\n\nAPPROVED\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the pool's appearance in a well-populated area of Las Vegas, NV, Director House suggests creating a twenty-four hour fully enclosed club aimed primarily at overwhelming SCP-4512's vocalizations with the added benefit of keeping it relatively clean.\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hawaiian Pool Masquerade\n is built surrounding SCP-4512 and finds success relatively quickly due to the efforts of the research team and Dr. Lark.\n8\n The pool was kept maintained for one month, eight days, and three hours until an inebriated patron defecated within SCP-4512. The incident caused eight fatalities due to air embolism in the lungs and 29 injuries due to shattered eardrums and collapsed lungs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 4512-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a routine containment attempt, Researcher Kalama was prompted to engage SCP-4512 in conversation while MTF Iota-9 observed standard procedure. Selection of Kalama was due to their familiarity with the Hawaiian language, which SCP-4512 has been observed to use words and phrases in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Click\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0credentials\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4512\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Kalama\n\n\nNote: SCP-4512's water feature appears to flow with more velocity when it \"speaks.\" This has not been observed to coincide with the volume of SCP-4512's vocalizations.\n\n\n\u00abBegin Log\u00bb\n\n\nSCP-4512:\n Aloooooooooha, cousin!
