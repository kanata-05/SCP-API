No changes which further illustrate its potential causes are to be made to this document.\n\n\nAttempts to reach rational consensus regarding the nature and/or causes of SCP-5485 must be prevented by any means necessary. As such, SCP-5485's classification is to remain Pending indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-5485 interior converted by SCP-5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-5485 was a logical restructuring\n.\n[citation needed]\n event which occurred on 1999/02/29. For reasons yet to be fully understood, SCP-5485 resulted in the translocation of Site-5485 to the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 700km off the Hydran coast of Greece. Several of the Site's apparatus have been directly converted into equipment consistent with other Submerged Foundation Sites circa 1910-1930. This conversion affected the entirety of the facility's exterior, as well as several internal structures (see right).\n\n\nInformation regarding SCP-5485 carries a memetic\n.\n[citation needed]\n property inducing increased levels of suspicion and speculation, particularly regarding the nature of SCP-5485 and of Site-5485 itself. This appears to have afflicted Site-5485 staff in the wake of the event as suggested by various edits to their internal documents, taking the form of \"\n[citation needed]\n\" or similar.\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the Site-5485 Dossier, as retrieved from the Site-01 Secure Database:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLocated in the Pindus Mountains Region of Greece, Site-\u2588\u2588 is a communications hub for the Foundation's Western European branch, most notably specializing in the monitoring and study of various Groups of Interest and their respective regional presences. Both overt and covert interactions with \nGoI-004\n (\"Church of the Broken God\") are primarily coordinated from this location.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5485-A are files retrieved from Site-5485's database during its discovery. These files serve as vectors for SCP-5485's memetic effect, and document the decline of logical consensus among affected personnel regarding the nature and function of Site-5485.\n\n\nSite-5485's interior has demonstrated non-Euclidean topology and lack of continuity consistent with anartist stunts by members of \nGoI-2979\n (\"Are We Cool Yet?\") with a substantial focus on the \nbreakdown of logical superstructures\n and coherency. Effects documented include:\n\n\n\n\nthe aforementioned conversion of Site structures into submersible technology\n\n\nmemetic hazards painted on the insides of windows, causing both affected personnel and sea life to fold in half, perishing instantly\n\n\npersistent tapping sounds originating from the inside of any protective headwear\n\n\nblue walls\n.\n[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\nFurther effects were unable to be documented as MTF personnel's abilities to logically discern their surroundings degraded with time. When asked to apply standard cognitive resistance technologies, remaining personnel swam out of the Site's entrance and separated into several chunks of flesh, which remained animate and proceeded to join a school of fish.\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY:\n Prior to SCP-5485, RAISA\n.\nRecords and Information Security Administration\n Director Maria Jones received a call from Site-5485 regarding a database discrepancy. The call's transcript is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO TRANSCRIPT 5485-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFICER OF RECORD:\n RAISA Director Maria Jones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN LOG \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDir.

Jones examines the caller ID.]\n\n\n\n\nDir. Jones:\n Just to confirm, you're calling from Site-\u2588\u2588?\n\n\n\n\nUnknown:\n Yes, I can see it, it's right here. My eyes are straight.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Jones:\n And who am I speaking to, exactly?\n\n\n\n\nUnknown:\n Site Director, Han Sharpe. Though you haven't got me listed in your version of the Dossier, for some reason.\n\n\n\n\n[A pause punctuated by the sounds of a mechanical keyboard.]\n\n\n\n\nDir. Jones:\n You'd better not be joking, Director Sharpe, because I have no record of anyone by your name being employed at the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nUnknown:\n Sharpe with a 'Q'.\n\n\n\n\nDir.

Site-5485's distress beacon was later detected by another secure facility stationed on the island of Hydra.\n\n\nWithin twelve hours, MTF personnel were able to successfully locate and explore the now-submerged Site. Of note was the defacement of the facility's exterior with several crude drawings of machinery, fish, and seemingly-unrelated symbols (see right). Twelve mineral statues, composed primarily of calcium, were found seated at various tables in the Site's cafeteria displaying expressions of apparent anguish or laughter. In front of each was an identical meal tray possessing one ID Card, one carton of milk, and a goldfish. Said ID cards were found to belong to Site-5485 research personnel whose likeness' were depicted by the statues. No other personnel were found.\n.\n[citation needed]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5485-1: Event Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n The following SCP-5485 Event Log is compiled from various video and audio files recovered from Site-5485. The accuracy of these files, and the extent to which they were affected by SCP-5485, are unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN LOG \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:06\n\n\nIn the Director's office, a man seated at his desk initiates a call on his phone. This is the call transcribed above, during which the man stands up from his desk and paces aimlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:08\n\n\nIn the Site's cafeteria, a humanoid figure enters the room wearing deep-sea diving equipment. Personnel wave to the figure as if this is a common occurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:09\n\n\nDuring the Director's call, he takes off his shoes. He reaches into the left shoe and produces a bright blue letter Q. He ends his call soon after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:17\n\n\nThere appears to be a cut in the cafeteria's video footage, but the timestamp remains the same. Within an instant, personnel have spread to the outer walls of the cafeteria, pointing to the center of the room and apparently screaming (though no audio is present to verify this). The diver is gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:22\n\n\nThe Director is now seated in another chair in his office. With a packaging knife, he carefully slices his left shoe in two, shaking them as if attempting to empty their contents. After nothing comes out, he reaches into his right shoe, producing another letter Q.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:26\n\n\nThe cafeteria's footage again appears to cut, or splice with another set of footage. The room's lights are now off; through the windows, schools of fish are now visible. All tables in the cafeteria have been pushed against the walls. Personnel are seated in a circle in the center of the floor. The diver gradually walks around the outside of the circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:30\n\n\nThe Director's office footage is corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:35\n\n\nThe cafeteria's lights turn back on. \nThe walls are blue\n. The personnel and cafeteria tables are absent. On the floor, a set of deep-sea diving gear has been discarded. Adjacent to it, the letters \"LHOOQ\" are spelled out in an arrangement of dead salmon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:36\n\n\nThe cafeteria's footage ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15:00\n\n\nThe Director's office becomes visible again. Director Sharpe's dismembered remains are arranged in a neat pile on his chair. Atop them, a large, bright-blue letter Q is visible intersecting his skull. The words \"citation needed\" are painted on the wall in blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab END LOG \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The Director, \"Han (Q?) Sharpe\" has been identified as Site-5485 Director Joseph Rutherford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5485-2: Incident Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 1999/04/01\n\n\nOFFICER OF RECORD:\n O5-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n Dir. Jones was notified of an unauthorized edit to the Site-01 Secure Database; the Site-5485 Facility Dossier was edited to falsely suggest that it had always been a Submerged Research and Containment Facility, and various footnotes were appended to the SCP-5485 file questioning the authenticity of the document. This edit was traced to a local access terminal and MTF personnel were dispatched to handle the offender. However, upon arrival, there was no offender to be found; instead, the access terminal had been fused with a mass of wires and decomposing trout. Personnel who directly viewed the structure lost interest in relevant tasks and proceeded to sit in a circle on the floor surrounding it.\n\n\n\nFurther attempts to remove the structure resulted in more personnel succumbing to its influence; this was compounded by the breakdown of logical reality in its presence. Over the course of several hours, the affected personnel consumed the remaining trout carcasses, followed by the consumption of the mechanical parts of the structure, resulting in their gruesome deaths. After ample discussion amongst Overseer personnel, affected areas of the Site were sealed, condemned and stabilized via Reality-Anchoring technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1999/04/03:\n By consensus of O5 Council, the SCP-5485 file has been locked indefinitely. Personnel are not to be informed of the nature of the condemned sections of Site-01, nor why \nits walls are blue\n.\n.\n[no citation needed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
