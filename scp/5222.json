There are currently \n1326\n different SCP-5222-\u03b2 items catalogued, and \nnone\n contained.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5222 was provisionally created by AIC.COLOSSUS\n5\n on 2013-05-29 after Site-121 went offline with no \nSCUTTLE\n6\n heartbeat\n7\n, which correlated to a concurrent spike\n8\n in anomalous background entropy per AIC.WARHAMMER\n9\n.\n\n\nThe nature of the spike and rapid return to baseline did not match any known emissions signatures, and was determined with high confidence to be a Ruhiel-class Transitory Phenomenon\n10\n. MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\")\n11\n was scrambled to the area per SCUTTLE Dead Man's Switch Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a05222-1\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log,\u00a0MTF\u00a0\u039d-7\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a05222-1\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log,\u00a0MTF\u00a0\u039d-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscribable crew:\n Team \u039d-7-\u03b2 (132 Members), Team \u039d-7-\u0393 (132 Members)\n\n\n\n\n\u039d-7-\u03b2-1 (Maj.
