All Foundation personnel on-site are to maintain cover as a government-sanctioned cleanup staff and all unauthorized individuals attempting to gain access to the location are to be detained, questioned, and administered a Class B amnestic if deemed necessary by on-site security personnel.\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, no anomalous phenomena have been recorded on-site for a period of twelve (12) months and as such, SCP-1378 has been reclassified Neutralized. Local Observation Posts have been notified to monitor reports in case of resurgence; all on-site personnel have been reassigned and the property has been returned to local ownership until further notice.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1378 is the former site of the [REDACTED] Mall, a small shopping center located in [REDACTED] which was destroyed by a fire on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588. Officially, the cause of the fire was recorded as having been due to an electrical fault in the central HVAC system that quickly spread throughout the building; civilian casualties numbered 13 dead, 32 injured, and 18 missing and presumed dead.\n\n\nHuman subjects within the former perimeter of the building, particularly within the eastern wing, have reported numerous anomalous phenomena, most notably auditory hallucinations identified as heavily distorted human voices and periodic temperature spikes in various locations. Attempts to record this audio onto electronic media have failed, but corroboration between affected subjects has resulted in highly consistent transcripts of such phenomena, suggesting a common source for each such incident rather than a localized effect specific to each subject.\n\n\nA small number of individuals, particularly those with above-average extrasensory sensitivity, have reported being able to see intangible humanoid and saurian figures with varying levels of clarity, and an even smaller number of individuals have received unexplained injuries in the form of burns of varying severity in conjunction with periods of thermal fluctuation.\n\n\nSCP-1378 was contained and classified following numerous reports of hallucinations and other unexplained phenomena by emergency first responders and disaster response specialists. All such affected individuals were administered Class B amnestics and released following questioning, and current containment procedures were enacted shortly thereafter.\n\n\nAddendum 1378-01:\n Log of Auditory Phenomena\n\n\nWhile the majority of auditory phenomena experienced by affected individuals have consisted of incoherent or highly distorted voices, personnel have consistently reported decipherable speech from two different unidentified female voices, a young girl (SCP-1378-A) and an older woman (SCP-1378-B), possibly related. The repetition of such speech indicates that they may form some sort of hallucinatory echo of prior events, and the decipherable fragments from such events has been logged.\n\n\n\n\nRef #:\n 1378-031\n\n\nDuration:\n 28 seconds\n\n\nTranscript:\n\n\nSCP-1378-B:\n [indecipherable] and stay close to me, honey, okay?\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n Okay.\n\n\nSCP-1378-B:\n Alright, now hold my hand and don't let go.

The following transcript is a combination of transcripts taken from the team's audio recording equipment as well as corroboration from personnel on-site at the time of the incident.\n\n\n\n\nDr. R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Okay, I'm not getting anything from this area.

We'll have to take a look at the readout.\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n Mommy, is that you?\n\n\nDr. R. M.:\n Okay, see if you can get a bearing on this one. J\u2588\u2588, let's move five through eight and see if we can triangulate.\n\n\nDr. J\u2588\u2588 T\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Got it.\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n Mommy? Mommy, don't leave!\n\n\nDr. R.

Who's outside?\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n I\u2026 I don't know\u2026 they took everyone else and my mommy told me to stay here and hide but they're coming closer. (crying) I don't know what to do\u2026\n\n\nDr. R. M.:\n Listen, okay? We're going to do everything we can to help, but I need to know who you are and where you are right now. (aside) Call it in.

We went to the back and then through a weird door that had really weird colors and there was all this awesome stuff, but\u2026 then there was fire everywhere and people were screaming and my mommy told me to hide in here and I heard her yelling\u2026 and I don't know what happened and I'm scared\u2026\n\n\nDr. R. M.:\n Okay, [REDACTED], can you remember where this door was? Do you think you can get there?\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n I\u2026 I don't know, I can't remember. I\u2026 they're right outside the door, I can hear their claws, I'm scared\u2026\n\n\nDr. R. M.:\n [REDACTED], listen to me, you have to try to remember, okay?\n\n\nSCP-1378-A:\n They're trying to open the door! I can hear them!\n\n\nDr. R.

A request for a disciplinary hearing to address potential unprofessional conduct is under consideration but likely to be denied in light of mitigating circumstances.\n\n\nFollowing this incident, all anomalous phenomena related to SCP-1378 have completely dropped off; we're still not entirely sure what happened, but for the time being, we're out of leads.
