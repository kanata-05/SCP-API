This perimeter is maintained by MTF Kappa-9 (\"Paging Nurse Ratched\") under a cover story involving groundwater contamination.\n\n\nEfforts to develop a method of containing SCP-3054's effects outside of SCP-3054-A are ongoing. Meanwhile, all disappearances associated with SCP-3054 are to be reported to the Foundation's Disinformation Bureau for further action.\n\n\nNo personnel with a documented history of mental illness are permitted on-site.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3054 is an anomalous phenomenon which affects patients interned in mental health facilities throughout North America. Affected patients will disappear when left unobserved. Investigations into these disappearances have uncovered records at each facility indicating a scheduled transfer to SCP-3054-A. Neither a source nor an explanation for these records has been determined.\n\n\nThe Foundation became aware of this phenomenon in 1981; however, analysis indicates possible incidents dating back to 1890. Furthermore, while the earliest incidents occurred within one hundred kilometers of SCP-3054-A, this 'area of effect' appears to have expanded over time (with the most recent incident reported in Vancouver, Canada). As of now, there have been 912 disappearances associated with SCP-3054. More are expected to be uncovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior of SCP-3054-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3054-A is Cragstaff Sanitarium \u2014 an uninhabited psychiatric institute located in a forested region 50 kilometers west of Hudson, North Carolina. Other than the previously mentioned transfer records, no documentation of SCP-3054-A's construction or operation exists. Researchers are working to determine when SCP-3054-A was built and whether or not it was actually used.\n\n\nIt has recently been discovered that any person with a documented history of mental illness may experience SCP-3054 while inside of SCP-3054-A (see below).\n\n\nAddendum 3054.1:\n Text Logs\n\n\nThe following text logs were pulled from Foundation personnel's phones following the disappearance of Julia Owens, a Foundation researcher assigned to SCP-3054-A.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3054/files/text_09_05_2010.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia:\n Hello?\n\n\nJulia:\n Barry? Please reply.\n\n\nBarry:\n Julia? Where are you?\n\n\nJulia:\n I'm in the building.\n\n\nBarry:\n Where?\n\n\nJulia:\n In one of the rooms upstairs.\n\n\nJulia:\n They don't let us keep personal items, but I managed to hide my phone.\n\n\nJulia:\n I don't think they even know what the hell it is.\n\n\nBarry:\n Wait, what are you talking about? Who doesn't let you keep personal items?\n\n\nBarry:\n Let me call you.\n\n\nJulia:\n No\n\n\nJulia:\n Don't.\n\n\nJulia:\n If the phone rings, they might hear.\n\n\nBarry:\n Okay. Who might hear? I'm getting our supervisor.\n\n\nJulia:\n The staff.\n\n\nBarry:\n The staff?\n\n\nJulia:\n In the building. The medical staff.\n\n\nJulia:\n Give me a sec\n\n\nJulia:\n I'm still inside the building, but it's like I've traveled back in time. There are doctors and nurses everywhere, all wearing\u2026 like, old-timey clothes.\n\n\nJulia:\n They said I'm here to receive treatment.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Julia, this is Dr. Lindsey. You're telling me that you are currently inside Cragstaff, but it's open and running? With a medical staff?\n\n\nJulia:\n Yes.\n\n\nJulia:\n And it's not decayed, or broken down. It looks brand new.\n\n\nJulia:\n I saw others here, too. Other people taken by SCP-3054, I think?\n\n\nJulia:\n Lots of them. Confused. Scared. Most of them wouldn't even talk to me. Couple of teens, mostly adults.\n\n\nJulia:\n Some of them were just sitting in chairs, drooling. Looks like they might have been drugged.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Alright, Julia. Can you tell me precisely what room you're in? We're going to go there and see if there's any way to get you out.\n\n\nJulia:\n Room 203, I think.\n\n\nLindsey:\n We're on our way\n\n\nJulia:\n Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. Door's locked. Windows are barred.\n\n\nJulia:\n Looking out the window. Can't see much besides trees and fog.\n\n\nJulia:\n Can't even see the sky.\n\n\nLindsey:\n We're inside the room. Can you see anything unusual? Try to move some objects around.\n\n\nJulia:\n Everything's bolted down.\n\n\nJulia:\n Someone coming gtg\n\n\nLindsey:\n Stay safe. Text this number again when you can.

I'm here.\n\n\nLindsey:\n It's Lindsey.\n\n\nJulia:\n Hey.\n\n\nJulia:\n I've got all the settings on my phone running on minimum. Also, I'm keeping it turned off in-between uses. My battery should last a couple of days, at the very least.\n\n\nJulia:\n Presuming I don't blow all my juice on Flappy Bird.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Okay, good. What's going on? Can you tell me anything new that might help us get you out of there?\n\n\nJulia:\n Not much. All the windows are barred. Outside is overcast.\n\n\nJulia:\n All the patients downstairs are different, now. Most of them are still confused. Just different faces. Different people.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Have you talked to any of them?\n\n\nJulia:\n Yeah. A lot of them just got here. The ones who have been here longer, they don't talk much. Just stare and mumble to themselves.\n\n\nJulia:\n There's a woman here in her sixties. Someone told me she came here when she was a little girl.\n\n\nJulia:\n Apparently, she tried to escape once.\n\n\nJulia:\n So they did something to her.\n\n\nJulia:\n And now, now she doesn't try much of anything.\n\n\nJulia:\n Just stares out the window and drools.\n\n\nLindsey:\n All the more reason for you to be as careful as possible, right?\n\n\nJulia:\n Right. They told me I'll see a doctor, tomorrow.\n\n\nJulia:\n I should go. Need to sleep. Will text you later.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Alright. I'll be here, Julia.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Try to keep the flappy-bird to a minimum, okay? ;)\n\n\nJulia:\n <3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3054/files/text_11_05_2010.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia:\n Daily report. Gonna try to keep these brief. Want to conserve power.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Hey! I'm here.\n\n\nJulia:\n Same as before. Overcast outside. All different patients downstairs. Even that sixty-year-old lady is gone.\n\n\nJulia:\n Seen too many different faces. No way they all fit inside this place.\n\n\nJulia:\n Met doctor today. Talked for about twenty minutes.\n\n\nJulia:\n Asked him when I can leave. He said: After we've fixed you\n\n\nJulia:\n Asked him what the hell that even means. He said: That's for you to decide\n\n\nJulia:\n So, I said: Well, in that case, can't I just decide I'm fixed?\n\n\nJulia:\n He didn't think it was funny.\n\n\nJulia:\n I asked him about the different faces.\n\n\nJulia:\n He just said: Interesting.\n\n\nJulia:\n Asshole is acting like I'm crazy.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Be careful. Don't antagonize them. Tell them whatever they want to hear. We don't know what these people are. We don't even know if they're people.\n\n\nJulia:\n Yeah. The way he looked at me after that joke\u2026\n\n\nJulia:\n I'll play nice. Pretend to be a good little girl.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Good. We're still working on a plan to get you out of there.\n\n\nJulia:\n Is that even possible?\n\n\nLindsey:\n Well, we can communicate, which means something must get through\u2026 which means that \u2014 yeah, there is probably a way to get you back.\n\n\nJulia:\n I'd really appreciate it. The food here is pretty horrible.\n\n\nJulia:\n gtg, footsteps\n\n\nLindsey:\n Stay safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3054/files/text_14_05_2010.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia:\n Hey\n\n\nLindsey:\n Hey!\n\n\nLindsey:\n So, we might have some good news.\n\n\nLindsey:\n I think we figured out why it took you.\n\n\nLindsey:\n I know this is a gross violation of privacy \u2014 not to mention HIPAA regulations \u2014 but I thumbed through some personnel files, called in some favors. Found out that out of all the people assigned here, you're the only one who's ever been admitted to a mental health facility.\n\n\nLindsey:\n We think maybe that when someone is here, SCP-3054 'counts' it as you being interned in a psychiatric institute. But only if you've been interned in one before.\n\n\nLindsey:\n If we're right, it means we know how to send people over. And since you took your phone with you, that means we might be able to send someone to you with something even more useful. Maybe something that can bring you and everyone else back.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Anyway, it's not a solution, but it's a start.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Julia?\n\n\nJulia:\n Yeah\n\n\nJulia:\n Yeah that's good\n\n\nJulia:\n I would very much like to leave\n\n\nLindsey:\n Are you okay?\n\n\nJulia:\n Started meds few days ago\n\n\nJulia:\n Foggy, hard to remember shit\n\n\nJulia:\n Sorry. Hard to focus\n\n\nJulia:\n Is why I haven't messaged. Been sleeping a lot\n\n\nLindsey:\n No, it's fine, I understand.\n\n\nJulia:\n Been talking to other patients more\n\n\nJulia:\n Some of them don't even remember when they first came here. I think it's the meds, but I don't know. Maybe it's this place\n\n\nJulia:\n One of them told me you can petition to leave.\n\n\nJulia:\n A judge shows up, and you plead your case, the judge can decide to let you go.\n\n\nJulia:\n I asked if anyone ever got out that way. Nobody really seems to know or remember\n\n\nJulia:\n I asked if anyone got out PERIOD\n\n\nJulia:\n Same response\n\n\nJulia:\n I think most of them have given up. They just stare out the window and chew their pills\n\n\nJulia:\n But I'm not giving up\n\n\nJulia:\n I'm not dying in this place.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Don't worry. We'll get you out. I promise.\n\n\nJulia:\n I petitioned for a judge this morning. I'm seeing him tomorrow.\n\n\nLindsey:\n Are you sure that's wise?\n\n\nJulia:\n It's a shot. I'm taking it. I can't stand this place, it's\n\n\nJulia:\n It's not even hell. At least hell would be interesting\n\n\nJulia:\n It's just waiting to die\n\n\nLindsey:\n Okay. Please, be careful.

It's Julia.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Julia? What's going on? Why are you calling? Are you okay?\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n I escaped.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n You\u2026 where are you?\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n I'm outside of the facility. It's dark, but I'm out. I'm fucking out. I faked taking my meds for a couple of days, hid them under my tongue \u2014 managed to steal a nail-file. Used it to pry up one of the bars of my window.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Okay. Okay, Julia. I'm notifying personnel right now, give me a moment. We're going to do a search in the woods surrounding the facility. Give me a second.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(rustling sounds)\n I'm moving, but it's slow going. You know that people can't walk in straight lines? I learned that on TV. Mythbusters, I think? But if you take it slow, you can get kind of close. You just gotta use something as reference points. I'm using the trees. Line up the trees, walk between them\u2026\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n \n(muffled, distant)\n Kappa-7, this is Dr. Lindsey. Come back.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(laughing)\n Oh my God, can you imagine\u2026? If my life was saved by TV? TV and a nail-file.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n \n(muffled, distant)\n I need you to begin searching the interior of the perimeter. We think one of ours might be in the woods.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(laughing turns to strangled sobs)\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Julia\u2026?\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(sniffling)\n It's okay. I'm okay. Just, God, I'm so glad just to hear your voice. Anyone's voice. But yours, especially. I was starting to think you aren't even real. They were never going to let me out, Lindsey. It's\u2026 so horrible. Everything in there is so horrible. We have to get everyone else out of there. We can't leave them.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Keep talking to me, Julia. Keep moving in a straight line. Keep using the trees. There's a fence, about a kilometer out. We've got people patrolling it.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(laughing, again)\n I'm going to tackle the first person I see. Just, tackle them and start kissing them. Boy, girl, or other. I don't even care. Fuck it. I'll marry them.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Well, uh\u2026 \n(laughing)\n Just, um. Maybe give them a little warning, first? I mean, they're armed.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \n(rustling)\n The worst part\u2026 the worst part is how they keep acting like you can leave. If it was just hopeless, if they just told me I'm never leaving, I could deal with that. But they keep dangling hope in front of you. Torturing you with it.

        "Julia: Hello? Julia: Barry? Please reply. Barry: Julia? Where are you? Julia: I'm in the building. Barry: Where? Julia: In one of the rooms upstairs. Julia: They don't let us keep personal items, but I managed to hide my phone. Julia: I don't think they even know what the hell it is. Barry: Wait, what are you talking about? Who doesn't let you keep personal items? Barry: Let me call you. Julia: No Julia: Don't. Julia: If the phone rings, they might hear. Barry: Okay. Who might hear? I'm getting our supervisor. Julia: The staff. Barry: The staff? Julia: In the building. The medical staff. Julia: Give me a sec Julia: I'm still inside the building, but it's like I've traveled back in time. There are doctors and nurses everywhere, all wearing\u2026 like, old-timey clothes. Julia: They said I'm here to receive treatment. Lindsey: Julia, this is Dr. Lindsey. You're telling me that you are currently inside Cragstaff, but it's open and running? With a medical staff? Julia: Yes. Julia: And it's not decayed, or broken down. It looks brand new. Julia: I saw others here, too. Other people taken by SCP-3054, I think? Julia: Lots of them. Confused. Scared. Most of them wouldn't even talk to me. Couple of teens, mostly adults. Julia: Some of them were just sitting in chairs, drooling. Looks like they might have been drugged. Lindsey: Alright, Julia. Can you tell me precisely what room you're in? We're going to go there and see if there's any way to get you out. Julia: Room 203, I think. Lindsey: We're on our way Julia: Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. Door's locked. Windows are barred. Julia: Looking out the window. Can't see much besides trees and fog. Julia: Can't even see the sky. Lindsey: We're inside the room. Can you see anything unusual? Try to move some objects around. Julia: Everything's bolted down. Julia: Someone coming gtg Lindsey: Stay safe. Text this number again when you can. We'll keep someone monitoring it. And do whatever you can to conserve your phone battery.",
        "Julia: Yo. Julia: Anyone? Lindsey: Yes. I'm here. Lindsey: It's Lindsey. Julia: Hey. Julia: I've got all the settings on my phone running on minimum. Also, I'm keeping it turned off in-between uses. My battery should last a couple of days, at the very least. Julia: Presuming I don't blow all my juice on Flappy Bird. Lindsey: Okay, good. What's going on? Can you tell me anything new that might help us get you out of there? Julia: Not much. All the windows are barred. Outside is overcast. Julia: All the patients downstairs are different, now. Most of them are still confused. Just different faces. Different people. Lindsey: Have you talked to any of them? Julia: Yeah. A lot of them just got here. The ones who have been here longer, they don't talk much. Just stare and mumble to themselves. Julia: There's a woman here in her sixties. Someone told me she came here when she was a little girl. Julia: Apparently, she tried to escape once. Julia: So they did something to her. Julia: And now, now she doesn't try much of anything. Julia: Just stares out the window and drools. Lindsey: All the more reason for you to be as careful as possible, right? Julia: Right. They told me I'll see a doctor, tomorrow. Julia: I should go. Need to sleep. Will text you later. Lindsey: Alright. I'll be here, Julia. Lindsey: Try to keep the flappy-bird to a minimum, okay? ;) Julia: <3",
        "Julia: Daily report. Gonna try to keep these brief. Want to conserve power. Lindsey: Hey! I'm here. Julia: Same as before. Overcast outside. All different patients downstairs. Even that sixty-year-old lady is gone. Julia: Seen too many different faces. No way they all fit inside this place. Julia: Met doctor today. Talked for about twenty minutes. Julia: Asked him when I can leave. He said: After we've fixed you Julia: Asked him what the hell that even means. He said: That's for you to decide Julia: So, I said: Well, in that case, can't I just decide I'm fixed? Julia: He didn't think it was funny. Julia: I asked him about the different faces. Julia: He just said: Interesting. Julia: Asshole is acting like I'm crazy. Lindsey: Be careful. Don't antagonize them. Tell them whatever they want to hear. We don't know what these people are. We don't even know if they're people. Julia: Yeah. The way he looked at me after that joke\u2026 Julia: I'll play nice. Pretend to be a good little girl. Lindsey: Good. We're still working on a plan to get you out of there. Julia: Is that even possible? Lindsey: Well, we can communicate, which means something must get through\u2026 which means that \u2014 yeah, there is probably a way to get you back. Julia: I'd really appreciate it. The food here is pretty horrible. Julia: gtg, footsteps Lindsey: Stay safe.",
        "Julia: Hey Lindsey: Hey! Lindsey: So, we might have some good news. Lindsey: I think we figured out why it took you. Lindsey: I know this is a gross violation of privacy \u2014 not to mention HIPAA regulations \u2014 but I thumbed through some personnel files, called in some favors. Found out that out of all the people assigned here, you're the only one who's ever been admitted to a mental health facility. Lindsey: We think maybe that when someone is here, SCP-3054 'counts' it as you being interned in a psychiatric institute. But only if you've been interned in one before. Lindsey: If we're right, it means we know how to send people over. And since you took your phone with you, that means we might be able to send someone to you with something even more useful. Maybe something that can bring you and everyone else back. Lindsey: Anyway, it's not a solution, but it's a start. Lindsey: Julia? Julia: Yeah Julia: Yeah that's good Julia: I would very much like to leave Lindsey: Are you okay? Julia: Started meds few days ago Julia: Foggy, hard to remember shit Julia: Sorry. Hard to focus Julia: Is why I haven't messaged. Been sleeping a lot Lindsey: No, it's fine, I understand. Julia: Been talking to other patients more Julia: Some of them don't even remember when they first came here. I think it's the meds, but I don't know. Maybe it's this place Julia: One of them told me you can petition to leave. Julia: A judge shows up, and you plead your case, the judge can decide to let you go. Julia: I asked if anyone ever got out that way. Nobody really seems to know or remember Julia: I asked if anyone got out PERIOD Julia: Same response Julia: I think most of them have given up. They just stare out the window and chew their pills Julia: But I'm not giving up Julia: I'm not dying in this place. Lindsey: Don't worry. We'll get you out. I promise. Julia: I petitioned for a judge this morning. I'm seeing him tomorrow. Lindsey: Are you sure that's wise? Julia: It's a shot. I'm taking it. I can't stand this place, it's Julia: It's not even hell. At least hell would be interesting Julia: It's just waiting to die Lindsey: Okay. Please, be careful. We still don't know what we're dealing with, here. Julia: I will. Julia: Going to sleep. Good night. Lindsey: Okay. Good night. Stay safe.",
        "Julia: Fuck Lindsey: Julia? Julia: Fuck fuck fuck Julia: Fuck fuck Lindsey: What's wrong? Julia: Fuck Lindsey: Talk to me, Julia. Please. Julia: It didn't work Julia: They doubled my dose of meds before I saw the judge Julia: I'm slurring all over the place and he's just staring at me Julia: Then a bunch of doctors I never saw show up Julia: Start talking about how I don't engage with the other patients Julia: Or shower Julia: Or brush my hair Julia: Fucking Julia: Showers I don't even have any other clothes besides the set you gave me you fucking assholes Julia: I don't even have a hairbrush how the fuck am I supposed to brush my hair Julia: And no one told me I need to engage with the patients more Julia: They never told me anything Julia: Then they bring up the shit I said to the doctor Julia: Like how I said the faces keep changing Julia: Making it sound like I'm crazy Julia: I'M NOT FUCKING CRAZY Lindsey: I know. You aren't crazy, Julia. Julia: The judge said Julia: He'd give me a choice Julia: He could make a decision now, which meant Julia: Either he'd let me out or keep me for another 6 months Julia: Or I could 'agree' to stay for 3 months and petition again after Julia: And I Julia: I fucking couldn't Julia: I was so scared I just buckled Julia: I feel so sick Julia: I'm crying Julia: What is wrong with me Lindsey: Julia, calm down. Please. I don't think you're going to be able to get out of this place on your own. I think you need to focus on keeping your head together while we figure out how to get you out, okay? Julia: No you don't understand Julia: I'm stuck here for another 3 months I agreed to it Lindsey: Julia. Lindsey: I don't care what you told them. Lindsey: Once we figure out a way to bring you home, we are bringing you home. Lindsey: I don't care if we need to blow the whole goddamn place down. Lindsey: We are bringing you home. Lindsey: Okay? Lindsey: Julia? Julia: Okay Julia: I'm sorry I fucked this up Julia: I shouldn't have said anything Lindsey: Julia, you didn't do anything wrong. Relax. Whatever is happening to you isn't your fault. This place\u2026 it isn't right. Okay? Lindsey: Julia? Julia: Okay Julia: I'm going to sleep Julia: Please bring me home Julia: I just want to come home Lindsey: We will. I promise.",

Why are you calling? Are you okay? VOICE 2: I escaped. VOICE 1: You\u2026 where are you? VOICE 2: I'm outside of the facility. It's dark, but I'm out. I'm fucking out. I faked taking my meds for a couple of days, hid them under my tongue \u2014 managed to steal a nail-file. Used it to pry up one of the bars of my window. VOICE 1: Okay. Okay, Julia. I'm notifying personnel right now, give me a moment. We're going to do a search in the woods surrounding the facility. Give me a second. VOICE 2: (rustling sounds) I'm moving, but it's slow going. You know that people can't walk in straight lines? I learned that on TV. Mythbusters, I think? But if you take it slow, you can get kind of close. You just gotta use something as reference points. I'm using the trees. Line up the trees, walk between them\u2026 VOICE 1: (muffled, distant) Kappa-7, this is Dr. Lindsey. Come back. VOICE 2: (laughing) Oh my God, can you imagine\u2026? If my life was saved by TV? TV and a nail-file. VOICE 1: (muffled, distant) I need you to begin searching the interior of the perimeter. We think one of ours might be in the woods. VOICE 2: (laughing turns to strangled sobs) VOICE 1: Julia\u2026? VOICE 2: (sniffling) It's okay. I'm okay. Just, God, I'm so glad just to hear your voice. Anyone's voice. But yours, especially. I was starting to think you aren't even real. They were never going to let me out, Lindsey. It's\u2026 so horrible. Everything in there is so horrible. We have to get everyone else out of there. We can't leave them. VOICE 1: Keep talking to me, Julia. Keep moving in a straight line. Keep using the trees. There's a fence, about a kilometer out. We've got people patrolling it. VOICE 2: (laughing, again) I'm going to tackle the first person I see. Just, tackle them and start kissing them. Boy, girl, or other. I don't even care. Fuck it. I'll marry them. VOICE 1: Well, uh\u2026 (laughing) Just, um. Maybe give them a little warning, first? I mean, they're armed. VOICE 2: (rustling) The worst part\u2026 the worst part is how they keep acting like you can leave. If it was just hopeless, if they just told me I'm never leaving, I could deal with that. But they keep dangling hope in front of you. Torturing you with it. I\u2014 (silence) VOICE 1: Julia? VOICE 2: I see a light. Up ahead. Hey! Hey! Over here! VOICE 1: Be careful. Hold your hands up. Let them see you. VOICE 2: It's not moving. The light's not moving. Are there any\u2014 VOICE 1: Perimeter lights. Around the fence. Yes. Just reach it, and stay there.
