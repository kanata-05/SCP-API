If the President should be outside of these areas between 19:45 and 20:00 on any given night, an agent should be dispatched to fit the location with concealed cameras beforehand or visually confirm the event's occurrence. This is considered a Level 1/Dark Response Situation.\n.\nLowest priority, Foundation resources should be diverted to other tasks if necessary or convenient.\n\n\nEach hour, all recorded footage is stored automatically in terminal 12, Site-10. It will then be fed through an algorithm (A5092.amk) to check for any deviances from SCP-5092's standard behavior. The Algorithm should be checked for faults annually.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-5092 is a phenomenon affecting the President of the United States; every night, at exactly 19:53, the President will scratch their nose, regardless of any external factors. This is not due to a direct compulsion to do so but is simply the result of their nose becoming spontaneously itchy.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\nSCP-5092 was first discovered in 1982 by the second iteration of the Anomalous Signature Recognition Program\n.\nAlso known as A.S.R.P.2, this was one of the first times the Foundation used learning algorithms to find anomalies.\n after being given access to the Foundation's \nImportant Political Actors Video Archive\n, which contained enough footage of SCP-5092 events for A.S.R.P.2 to detect the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice: You are currently viewing an outdated iteration (2009/10/17) of this document.
