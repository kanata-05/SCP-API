Information contained herein has not been confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary:\n On 2020/04/14, the database at Site-72 reported a series of unauthorized file creations and modifications, specifically to documentation regarding SCP-5552. All past information on SCP-5552 has been lost, and possibly erased from the minds of personnel assigned to the project, as no individuals can confirm that the SCP-5552 slot had been previously assigned to an anomaly.\n\n\nThe documentation itself has not demonstrated anomalous properties, however all have been tagged with an upload timestamp of 13:43:28, which is the same time as when Dr. Naman Gupta began a talk at the 6th International Conference on Physics titled \"A Comprehensive Theory On Bi-Directional Temporal Travel\".\n\n\nWhat follows are the documents that manifested as a result of this event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5551\n | SCP-5552 | \nSCP-5553\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5552\n\" by Captain Kirby, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
