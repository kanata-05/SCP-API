Canine housing facilities are to be expanded as needed to accommodate any future instances. A circular in-ground swimming pool 10 meters in diameter \nis to be allowed access at all times\n will be made available under supervision only. Instances are to be fed on a diet of standard canine dog food and require no water. Appropriate toys and other materials are allowed. Cleaning of the run is to take place once per week. All instances are to be properly groomed as needed.\n\n\nDue to the docile nature of SCP-2751, personnel are allowed access for the purpose of socialization. Instances are not to be sprayed with or bathed in liquid at any time, as to avoid injury. Dry shampoos are to be used for washing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2751 refers to a pack of \n12\n 16 domestic dogs, 9 male and 7 female, who show distinctly hydrophobic properties by reacting to liquids as if they are solids. Instances are able to walk or sleep on bodies of liquids, and otherwise interact with liquids as if they were solids, but cannot force appendages beneath the surface even when compelled to do so. Instances consistently prefer to sleep on undisturbed bodies of water as opposed to ground. All bodily fluids expelled by SCP-2751 instances are powdery and lack liquid. Instances do not drink water and do not urinate, and are otherwise healthy, not suffering from dehydration or any other adverse health effects related to lack of liquid.\n\n\nInstances can reproduce with other instances, with anomalous properties being passed on with a 50/50 non-sex-linked ratio. See incident log 2751-a.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Partial\u00a0Instance\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Partial\u00a0Instance\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nNotable Instances\n\n\nSee document SCP-2751-t183 for full log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nRecovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2751-1 \u201cLady\u201d\n\n\n5-year-old female German Shepherd.

Chip archived in a radio-inhibiting container. GoI intervention expected; investigation underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of SCP-2751-5 and SCP-2751-6 upon recovery as strays. See Recovered Materials Log 2751-a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered Materials Log 2751-a:\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, owner of SCP-2751-5 and SCP-2751-6 until recovery, reported that her son, Mike, had brought them home as strays. The following illustration was drawn upon questioning of the child by an agent. Image reads, \"I gave them my snack and [they came] home\". When questioned about the figure in the water, Mike stated that it was \"who made the dogs sad\". Further investigation ongoing.\n\n\nIncident log 2751-a:\n On \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-2751-12 birthed a litter of six healthy Saint Bernard puppies, four male, two female, in a whelping box provided by Foundation veterinarians. Puppies were found to suck up a dry, powdery substance in place of normal mother\u2019s milk, produced by the mother via normal breastfeeding methods.\n\n\nOn the morning of \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, approximately one week following birth, all instances appear visibly distressed at the regular morning feeding time, refusing to move from the swimming pool and clawing repeatedly at the water. Further investigation reveals the drowned bodies of three of the puppies, one male and two female, at the bottom of said pool. Security footage shows SCP-2751-12 individually carrying pups from the whelping box to the pool for feeding on the water's surface, becoming distressed when half fall through. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, access to the swimming pool is allowed only under restricted conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2750\n | SCP-2751 | \nSCP-2752\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2751\n\" by thefriendlyvandal, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
