At all times, each specimen is to be carefully handled so as to minimize the likelihood of dislodging any nails from the specimen. Under no circumstances are nails to be removed from any specimen; if inspection of any specimen indicates a risk that a nail may become separated from a specimen, consult document 1036-3P.BR for restoration protocols.\n\n\nAt regular intervals (the timing of which is computed by Site-06's on-staff \nnganga\n (shaman) based on astronomical observations), the \nnganga\n is to affix to each specimen at least one additional iron nail having a mass in excess of eight grams.\n\n\nIf for any reason it becomes necessary for personnel other than the \nnganga\n to enter the presence of a specimen, it is recommended that the \nnganga\n first cover the eyes or other reflective components of the specimen with electrical tape or some other opaque coating.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1036 designates any of a collection of wooden figurines of a type consistent with fetish objects produced by the Kongo culture of western central Africa. The Foundation presently contains four specimens of SCP-1036, designated SCP-1036-1, SCP-1036-5, SCP-1036-6 and SCP-1036-7.\n\n\nEach figurine depicts a human form (or, in some cases, an animal form), typically depicted in a threatening posture. Each specimen is composed of African tropical hardwood and decorated with materials such as camwood powder, resins, and vegetable fiber such as raffia palm fronds. Each specimen includes a component (typically the eyes or abdomen) made of shiny or reflective metal such as polished silver, affixed to the specimen with tree gum. The specimens contain trace amounts of soil matched to certain funerary sites in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 region. A number of iron nails have been hammered into the wood of each specimen.\n\n\nEach specimen is slightly warm to the touch. Analysis indicates that the specimens normally have a surface temperature that exceeds the ambient temperature in the containment chamber by four to eight degrees centigrade; however Observation Log 1036-986-B.233 indicated that immediately prior to Event Kalazima-1, the surface temperature of SCP-1036-3 spiked by at least ninety degrees centigrade within less than four seconds before observation was interrupted.\n\n\nEach specimen is associated with a sentient incorporeal entity that had become bound to its respective specimen, prior to the Foundation's acquisition of the specimen in question, by means of a traditional Kongo shamanistic ritual practice. Each of the specimens in the Foundation's custody were constructed (inclusive of the performance of the binding protocol) no more recently than the mid-1870s.\n1\n So long as the integrity of its respective SCP-1036 specimen is maintained, the entity is incapable of free agency apart from communicating with a \nnganga\n or interacting with a living creature that makes eye contact with the specimen. Specimens of SCP-1036 were constructed by indigenous \nnganga\n in order to apply the powers of the bound entity for various useful purposes, but knowedge of the protocol for doing so has been lost; accordingly the Foundation's efforts regarding SCP-1036 have focused on containment.\n\n\nAddendum #1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1036-6 (detail).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log from Interview A; \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: This is Dr. Morrison. I am, uh, outside Chamber 06-SSD, together with Mr. Nzinga, looking into the chamber through the observation window. Mr. Nzinga, would you kindly explain for the record what we are doing in this test.\n\n\nNzinga\n: Certainly, Doctor. I am Fran\u00e7ois Nzinga, the \nnganga\n on staff here at Site-06. This morning, I will enter Chamber 06-SSD and interview the entity bound to SCP-1036-6, which is stored in that chamber.\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: Very good. Please explain what you are going to do now.\n\n\nNzinga\n: (\ninaudible\n)\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: I'm sorry, Fran\u00e7ois. Into the microphone.\n\n\nNzinga\n: Of course. I will first consume \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a substance\u2026 you would say \"liquor,\" in order to assist me in opening my mind. It is like a trance. I will accept the \niwa\n, or spirit, so that I can safely talk to it. I will then open the receptacle that contains SCP-1036-6.\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: This will be, uh, safe for you?\n\n\nNzinga\n: (\nlong pause\n) Yes.\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: You may proceed.\n\n(\napproximately eleven minutes pass\n)\n\n\nDr. Morrison\n: Mr. Nzinga, are you now ready?\n\n(\nindistinct vocalizations continue for approximately 2 minutes\n)\n\n\nNzinga\n: Yes, Doctor. I apologize for not being responsive while I prepared myself. I am now ready. (\nindistinct sounds\n) I am now removing SCP-1036-6 from the safe. I am about to look into the eyes of SCP-1036-6 in order to address the \nnkisi\n.

How long ago were you imprisoned\u2026 Three hundred twenty-six of your years, you (\nexpletive, translates to \"diseased penis\"\n) mortal\u2026 And for what purpose were you imprisoned? \u2026 The witch doctor who imprisoned me did so in order to tap into my power to make \nnlongo\n (\ntranslates approx. to \"medicine\"\n) and protect members of his clan from misfortune. Most of the time he and his successors used me thus. On occasion a different witch doctor would use me to curse, or to allow me to destroy men who would trespass onto his clan's territory. That was at least more amusing, but I was, I am, still a prisoner. What is this place? I cannot smell the forest\u2026 The object that is before me has been relocated to a secure facility. Can you tell me how to use your power to make \nnlongo\n? \u2026 Why would I do that, you (\nexpletive, translates to \"consumer of hippopotamus stool\"\n). You cannot compel me to teach you, (\nexpletive, translates to \"place a leech in your anus\"\n), you ignorant (\nuntranslatable expletive\n). Release me.

Mr. Nzinga recovers and leaves the observation chamber. Mr. Nzinga reports that the binding of SCP-1036-6's entity to SCP-1036-6 is intact, but recommends that Dr. Morrison be maintained in a sedated state.\n)\n\n\n\n\nAddendum #2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1036-2, -3 and -4 (Archival photograph, taken in 1902 prior to Foundation's collection.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-19\u2588\u2588\n (Event Kalazima-1)\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: Begin recording. Agent Lee, I'm here to take your debrief about the loss of SCP-1036-2, -3 and -4. We are designating the episode as Event Kalazima-1.\n\n\nLee\n: Loss of\u2026 god-damn clusterfuck. It looked to me like we lost everything in the southeast wing. How many people made it out?\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: Three, including you, but you're the only one that, ah, we can interview. I'm going to need you to be precise, for the record.\n\n\nLee\n: Okay. One of the D's was in there to change the monitors on SCP-1036-3's box.\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: This was D-4933?\n\n\nLee\n: That's right. The normal maintenance protocol is that the duty witch doctor \u2014 it was supposed to be Pierre Khonvoum, but his daughter was having a baby \u2014 the witch doctor goes in first, covers up the shiny bits, and then gives the all clear. But Pierre wasn't there, so Terry made a judgment call and just sent D-4933 in there with a blindfold on.\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: As a precaution against influence by the SCP-1036-3 entity?\n\n\nLee\n: Yeah. We had done that before, in the time period between when Jean Bumba\u2026 uh\u2026 when he left our service and when Pierre joined us.\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: And then what happened?\n\n\nLee\n: So, D-4933 was blindfolded. And when he was reaching around inside the box to find the thermometer, he must have bumped the statuette or something, and a nail fell out. And then D-4933 started to, you know, thrash around. He was yelling and waving his arms like he was on fire or something, and he knocked over the boxes for SCP-1036-2 and SCP-1036-4. So I immediately sealed the chamber door from the outside and I hit the button to close the blinds on the observation window.\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: Did anything come out of the chamber?\n\n\nLee\n: No, the door was sealed. But Agent Knorr, who was next to me, started smashing his head into the observation window, over and over, until the glass and blood was all over. And Dr. DiPiano, who was at the end of the hall, had what looked like a seizure, and then he started biting his own fingers off\u2026\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: Was that the point when you retreated to the control center?\n\n\nLee\n: I\u2026 I think so. I tried to make my way back down the south corridor to Checkpoint C to close the blast doors. Agent Majchrowski was there. He had, uh, stabbed himself in the eyes and the stomach with a pair of scissors, and he tried to attack me but he slipped on the blood. He was yelling something that sounded like \"kindoki\"\u2026 I tried to activate the sprinklers and the general anesthetic respirators to keep anybody else from hurting themselves. I guess it worked because I blacked out a minute later.\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: According to the log, the respirators went on-line at eighteen-thirty seven and twenty seconds.\n\n\nLee\n: Did\u2026 (\ngrunt of pain\n)\u2026 did Pete make it?\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: Pete\u2026 um\u2026 (\nshuffles papers\n)\u2026 I'm afraid not. Agent Foy's body was found in the garage. Cause of death\u2026 looks like he drank about two liters of gasoline. What did you do when you regained consciousness?\n\n\nLee\n: I, uh, I bound up the wound on my shoulder where somebody had bit me, and then I went back to the SCP-1036 containment chamber. The statues were smashed into about a million pieces and it looked like D-4933 had stuck a lot of the nails into himself. Look, Doctor, whatever was in those statues that made everybody\u2026 do stuff, is it still in here?\n\n\nDr. Torvaldsdottir\n: There's\u2026 um\u2026 there's no sign of that. We had MTF Mu-13 come through and give the all clear.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. It is not known whether any indigenous \nnganga\n, other than those employed by the Foundation, are still extant in central Africa and thus capable of performing the binding ceremony to create additional instances of SCP-1036. In order to reduce the likelihood of this, Foundation agents have encouraged the deforestation of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the removal of indigenous traditional societies from that area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1035\n | SCP-1036 | \nSCP-1037\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0by\u00a0this\u00a0author\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1322\n\n\nRating: 1216\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-089\n\n\nRating: 876\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspikebrennan's proposal\n\n\nRating: 516\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1844\n\n\nRating: 450\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1012\n\n\nRating: 417\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2553\n\n\nRating: 376\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1036\n\n\nRating: 362\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1512\n\n\nRating: 336\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1746\n\n\nRating: 301\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-908\n\n\nRating: 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-831\n\n\nRating: 283\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336\n\n\nRating: 273\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3236\n\n\nRating: 272\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-955\n\n\nRating: 246\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-926\n\n\nRating: 222\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2236\n\n\nRating: 203\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-920-EX\n\n\nRating: 180\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2914\n\n\nRating: 176\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2008-J\n\n\nRating: 164\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4436\n\n\nRating: 157\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4336\n\n\nRating: 155\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1060\n\n\nRating: 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSic Transit Gloria Mundi\n\n\nRating: 273\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring Cleaning\n\n\nRating: 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of meeting, June 2 1972\n\n\nRating: 129\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of telephone conversation, August 9, 1991\n\n\nRating: 96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorandum Dated 6 November 1944\n\n\nRating: 84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll fragment 13Q29\n\n\nRating: 44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStray Katz (part 1)\n\n\nRating: 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Majorem Bonum\n\n\nRating: 24",
