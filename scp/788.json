If SCP-788 becomes active or attempts to break containment, its containment chamber is to be cooled until SCP-788 ceases movement. SCP-788 is to be fed 500g pellets of iron and magnesium on a daily basis.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-788 is a creature resembling an African carp (\nLabeo coubie\n), approximately 3.2\u00a0m in length and composed entirely of ultramafic magma with a 'skin' of cracked picritic basalt. It is currently estimated to have a core temperature of approximately 1475 degrees Centigrade, though its skin temperature is typically much lower. Samples obtained from SCP-788 have shown no differentiation or internal structure.\n\n\nSCP-788 has been observed with simple behavior identical to that of a typical water-dwelling fish. It does not exhibit unusual strength for a creature of its size, though its sheer size and mass can result in damage to its containment cell if it becomes agitated. SCP-788 consumes several types of ore and minerals, with a preference for iron and magnesium, though it has not been observed excreting any material. Since its containment, SCP-788 has grown approximately 22\u00a0cm in length.\n\n\nSCP-788 was discovered following the 19\u2588\u2588 eruption of [REDACTED]. It is currently theorized that multiple instances of SCP-788 may exist in the mantle layer of the earth, and the eruption of [REDACTED] may have brought SCP-788 to the surface. Contingencies are currently in place if another instance of SCP-788 is discovered by Foundation or civilian assets.\n\n\nAddendum 788-01:\n Incident 788-01\n\n\nOn \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, SCP-788 became slow and apathetic for a period of approximately twenty four (24) days, during which its abdomen swelled considerably. At the end of this period, SCP-788 produced over \u2588\u2588\u2588 spherical objects, presumably eggs, with an average diameter of approximately 3\u00a0cm. Analysis shows that these are composed of the same type of magma as SCP-788, and all specimens have been separated into another containment cell and placed under observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-787\n | SCP-788 | \nSCP-789\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-788\n\" by Aelanna, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
