Members of MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Oil Slickers\") are to operate as first-responders in the event of a major oil spill, destroying all organisms produced via SCP-3057.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3057 is an anomalous phenomenon by which crude oil spontaneously transforms into instances of prehistoric species (SCP-3057-1 and onward).\n\n\nSCP-3057-1\n1\n was first observed in the aftermath of the \nDeepwater Horizon\n explosion\n2\n in 2010. PoI-8A052 (an ex-employee of the \nManna Charitable Foundation\n) deployed SCP-3057 in an attempt to reverse environmental damage caused by the disaster. It was only through extensive Foundation efforts that SCP-3057-1's spread was limited to a radius of 0.25 kilometers from the initial point of contamination. Since 2010, 4 more instances of SCP-3057 have been observed around the world. Whether this is a result of the initial contamination remains unknown.\n\n\nThe Manna Charitable Foundation has disavowed all knowledge of SCP-3057, and claims PoI-8A052's employment was terminated several weeks before the \nDeepwater Horizon\n incident. An ongoing investigation is underway to determine whether or not this is true.\n\n\nIt is suspected, but not confirmed, that \nSCP-2113\n is the result of SCP-3057.\n\n\nAddendum 3057.1:\n Attachments\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3057/files/incidents.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3057-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 08/11/2013\n\nLocation:\n Philippines; Estancia, Iloilo\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3057-2; \nAnomalocaris\n, a Cambrian era meter-long ancestral arthropod resembling predatory shrimp.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nPower Barge 103\n (owned by Napocor, or National Power Company) experienced several leaks as a result of Typhoon Haiyan. This resulted in the emergence of several hundred instances of SCP-3057-2.\n\n\nOver a dozen injuries along the coast have been linked to SCP-3057-2, which attacks its prey using barbs lining 2 appendages located near its mouth. These attacks have been blamed on a new species of invasive jellyfish. Foundation efforts to destroy all instances of SCP-3057-2 are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3057-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 09/12/2014\n\nLocation:\n Bangladesh; Sundarbans, Khulna Division\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3057-3; \nMeganeura\n, a Carboniferous era dragonfly with a maximum wingspan of 0.65 meters.\n3\n\n\nNotes:\n The \nOT Southern Star 7\n collided with a cargo vessel, leading to several hundred instances of SCP-3057-3.\n\n\nEvery instance of SCP-3057-3 expired shortly after manifesting; recent research suggests this is related to SCP-3057-3 having evolved in an oxygen-rich environment.\n4\n All SCP-3057-3 instances have been recovered and destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath of SCP-3057-4 emergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 03/05/2015\n\nLocation:\n United States of America; Pennsylvania, Philadelphia\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3057-4; \nVelociraptor\n, a Cretaceous era carnivorous theropod dinosaur approximately 2 meters in length and 0.5 meters high (at the hip).\n\n\nNotes:\n A unit upset in an oil refinery caused several vessels in a tank-farm to catastrophically rupture. This led to the emergence of several dozen instances of SCP-3057-4. All instances are believed to have fled into the surrounding wetlands.\n5\n\n\nTo date, 11 casualties (9 injuries and 2 fatalities) have been linked to SCP-3057-4. Foundation operatives have provided media outlets with a false cover story describing the escape of several cassowaries from captivity. All efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-4 are to be conducted by MTF Phi-2 (\"Clever Girls\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3057-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 28/01/2017\n\nLocation:\n India; Chennai, Ennore Port\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3057-5; \nMegalodon\n, a Cenozoic era shark with a maximum length of 18 meters.\n6\n\n\nNotes:\n The \nBW Maple\n collided with \nDawn Kanchipuram\n, another oil-tanker.
