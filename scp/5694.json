Director Paul Lague (Site-322) is engaged in dialogue with the Secretary of the Army to secure its release to Foundation custody.\n\n\nNo means of preventing SCP-5694 manifestation has yet been discovered. Containment efforts must be focused on amnesticization of witnesses and control of witness accounts.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5694 instances are identical humanoid entities resembling a balding white male with a chinstrap beard, approximately thirty years of age. While their ability to speak English suggests sapience, dialogues with SCP-5694 instances inevitably decline into nonsensicality in short order. Every encounter reported thus far has occurred at a place of business in the United States, with similar thematic undertones. Until 16/08/2019, these encounters were described to local law enforcement rather than caught on film. Examples have included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of SCP-5694 Sighting\n\n\nInteraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/01/2015\n\n\nEntity attempted to purchase a bow and arrow from a Cabela's Inc. store in Pennsylvania, expressing a desire to \"gain violence for money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29/08/2017\n\n\nEntity attempted to hire a bodyguard from Wright Security Solutions in Colorado, promising to \"pay well for assault.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16/03/2018\n\n\nEntity attempted to purchase munitions from the United States Air Force, for the stated purpose of \"having the explosions we all enjoy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18/06/2019\n\n\nEntity attempted to adopt a Pekingese toy dog from a shelter in Nashville, Tennessee, to acquire \"extra teeth, for harm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen successfully able to complete its desired transactions, each SCP-5694 instance pays with a functioning VISA credit card and leaves the premises on foot.\n1\n It collapses in mid-step shortly thereafter, dropping its purchases and immediately expiring.\n\n\nAutopsy of SCP-5694 instances reveals a physical structure superficially similar to that of a baseline human being, but composed primarily of elements from porcine biology. Trace elements not found naturally in the Earth's biosphere have been identified in each instance's bloodstream.\n\n\nSCP-5694 instances make overt attempts to avoid being photographed or filmed; these are invariably unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5694.1: First Recorded Sighting\n\n\n\n\nOn 16/08/2019, an instance of SCP-5694 entered Silvestri's Garden Supply in Olympia, Washington during a taped training exercise. It approached owner Mario Silvestri and trainee Tatiana Fonseca to open a dialogue. The resultant footage is transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n This is where I am, like they said.\n\n\nFonseca:\n Uh\u2026\n\n\n(Fonseca looks to Silvestri, who shrugs.)\n\n\nFonseca:\n Need any help?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I am here to do the buy!\n\n\n(Fonseca stares at SCP-5694 for a moment, then rallies.)\n\n\nFonseca:\n Well, that's\u2026 great, because we're here to\u2026 do the sell!\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Can I buy the kill?\n\n\nFonseca:\n \u2026what?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n We or I would like to purchase death.\n\n\n(Fonseca laughs nervously.)\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Ha ha ha ha.\n\n\nFonseca:\n What do you actually mean, though.\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Death spray! To melt the insides.\n\n\nFonseca:\n Are you from Canada, or something?\n\n\nSilvestri:\n Hey, do you mean pesticides? You want to buy a pesticide?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Pesticide.\n\n\nSilvestri:\n To kill bugs?\n\n\n(Silvestri indicates a small scurrying creature with his fingers.)\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Correct! I want to capitalize small murder.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nThe instance attempted to purchase the store's entire stock of pesticides. When informed that a commercial license is required to make such a large purchase, it settled on five cans of organophosphate spray. It then proceeded to conduct the same transaction at four other garden centers in the area.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5694.2: Second Recorded Sighting\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP-5694 instance was next recorded on 22/04/2020 at Bellissimo Bar and Grill in South Bend, Indiana. Security cameras captured the following interactions with hostess Wiola Balik:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I arrive for the consumption queue.\n\n\nBalik:\n That's the spirit.\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I wish to incorporate the smaller.\n\n\nBalik:\n Uh. Well, follow me.\n\n\n(Balik gestures at the tables, and moves towards them. SCP-5694 does not follow.)\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I am doing this correctly.\n\n\nBalik:\n Yeah, well done.\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Say loudly that I'm not doing this wrong.\n\n\nBalik:\n Did you come here to eat, or\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Eat?\n\n\nBalik:\n Yeah. Eat.\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Eat? Let me check \"eat.\"\n\n\n(SCP-5694 stares at Balik for approximately five seconds, eyes blank.)\n\n\nBalik:\n Uh\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Yeah, eat. Consume. I wanna diminish you.\n\n\nBalik:\n I don't\u2026 what?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Ha ha ha ha.\n\n\nBalik:\n Is this a bit? Or do you actually want to sit down?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I will reduce via mastication, and pay for the privilege.\n\n\nBalik:\n Buddy, this ain't that kind of bar.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5694.3: Final Recorded Sighting\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent civilian encounter with an instance of SCP-5694 was experienced by Boris Kovac, manager of human resources at Briscomb, Fowler and Cross LLC, who recorded the following abortive telephone interview on 15/07/2020:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Is this the people mill?\n\n\nKovac:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n The people mill.

Now, what are your long-term career goals?\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n I will decrease others to enlarge myself.\n\n\nKovac:\n Okay, that isn't\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n We want to resource the humans.\n\n\nKovac:\n Kid, if you're not gonna take this seriously I've got ten more applicants who will.\n\n\nSCP-5694:\n Work harder, work harder.
