The entity is required to attend therapy twice weekly alongside monthly psychiatric evaluations. SCP-5199-B is allowed to be in contact with SCP-5199-A for a maximum of six hours per day, though this limit may be moved at the discretion of the entity\u2019s psychological staff.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5199 is the designation of two connected anomalous entities referred to as SCP-5199-A and SCP-5199-B.\n\n\nSCP-5199-A is the designation of an animate statue composed of calcified tissue that resembles a human infant. This tissue is pliant enough to allow a full range of motion but displays no other anomalous properties. Beyond its material makeup, SCP-5199-A\u2019s behavior, needs, and medical vitals are consistent with that of a non-anomalous child, though it shows no signs of growth nor standard development milestones.\n\n\nSCP-5199-B is a 27-year-old British woman by the name of Leida Kuusik who is responsible for SCP-5199-A's creation. Though SCP-5199-B was formerly capable of local reality manipulation, this property has so far proven to have been transient, and the entity no longer shows independent anomalous capabilities.\n\n\nBoth components of SCP-5199 were brought into containment on May 5th, 2019, shortly after the surgical removal of SCP-5199-A. Medical records of the birth and interviews with SCP-5199-B indicate that the fetus had been deemed a miscarriage via abdominal pregnancy following rupture of the uterine wall, a condition that SCP-5199-B was predisposed to due to its N\u00e4lk\u00e4n\n1\n ethnicity. It is hypothesized that the biological manipulation practiced by the group is responsible for the deleterious germ-line mutations affecting SCP-5199-B as opposed to \nde novo\n mutations in the individual herself.\n\n\nAn MRI performed on April 29th revealed that the unborn fetus had developed into a lithopedion.\n2\n Sometime in the following week, SCP-5199-B underwent an involuntary stress-born Hume fluctuation, the result of which was the animation of SCP-5199-A.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Record: SCP-5199-A/1\n\n\n\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\n\n\nDate:\n 11 May 2019\n\n\nPresiding Physician:\n Elias Hawthorne\n\n\n\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\u2e3b\n\n\nProcedure:\n Exploratory MRI of SCP-5199-A\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-5199-A is structurally uniform, though there are numerous sections of higher density in the head and upper torso.
