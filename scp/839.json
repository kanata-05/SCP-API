The chamber is to be supplied with approximately half (1/2) of a kilogram of various plant matter daily. Mating of SCP-839 is to be regulated, and any extra instances of SCP-839 are to be kept in Foundation medical centers for treatment of ill individuals.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-839 appears to be a species of annelid composed of sugar, flavouring and colouring. A microscopic label stating \"CANDIED WORM\" is found near each instance's posterior, followed by a smaller label stating the instance's \"flavour\". Each \"flavour\" is currently designated as SCP-839-x.\n\n\nSCP-839 is generally found in temperate areas. SCP-839's diet mainly consists of decomposing organic matter, however when there is no decaying matter apparent SCP-839 may ingest live plant matter. SCP-839 sexually reproduces. Mating [REDACTED], followed by the egg hatching into a newborn instance of SCP-839.\n\n\nWhen SCP-839 is ingested by any mammal, it will burrow through the stomach lining and towards a specialized organ. The choice of organ appears to be dependent on SCP-839's \"flavour\". SCP-839 will then attach itself to the organ and slowly ingest it. While the organ disappears, SCP-839 will change in form and chemical composition in order to match the organ. SCP-839 does not act as a perfect replacement, and other effects may occur. This process may take \u2588 to \u2588\u2588 days to complete.\n1\n\n\nSCP-839 has an average lifespan of three years. Users of SCP-839 are recommended to replace their integrated instance with a new instance every two years.\n\n\nAddendum 839-1:\n Current \"flavours\" of SCP-839\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Flavour\"\n\n\nColouration\n\n\nOrgan Replaced\n\n\nOther Effects\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCherry\n\n\nRed\n\n\nHeart\n\n\nIncreased blood sugar, Type-2 Diabetes\n\n\nSCP-839-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Raspberry\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nKidney (One)\n\n\nBlue urine\n\n\nSCP-839-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Apple\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nEye (One)\n\n\nMild hallucinations, \"greenish\" tint\n\n\nSCP-839-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatermelon\n\n\nPink\n\n\nBrain\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nSCP-839-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemon\n\n\nYellow\n\n\nStomach\n\n\nLess Fibre content, diarrhea (Note: recommended for use with other instances of SCP-839, due to the ulcers created)\n\n\nSCP-839-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrape\n\n\nPurple\n\n\nLung (one)\n\n\n\"Fruity\" smell to breath\n\n\nSCP-839-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange\n\n\nOrange\n\n\nLiver\n\n\nIncreased acidity of bloodstream (Not recommended)\n\n\nSCP-839-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
