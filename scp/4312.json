Online communications are to be monitored for instances of SCP-4312, and any civilian demonstrating knowledge of SCP-4312 is to be administered a textual amnestic. Suppression and removal of civilian evidence of SCP-4312 is considered a Level 2 priority.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4312 is the inversion and reduction of gravitational force on an individual (designated SCP-4312-1.) During an SCP-4312 event, gravity exerts a margin\n1\n of its typical force in precisely the opposite direction as would be expected on the instance of SCP-4312-1. SCP-4312 manifests at random intervals, but is estimated to have approximately one instance every ten days. The only observed criteria for an individual becoming an instance of SCP-4312-1 is that the subject is not inside an enclosed structure at the time.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4312-A:\n\n\nOn 1/9/2018, Agent Abigail Kelana was affected by SCP-4312 while on vacation in Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovered\u00a0footage\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAgent Kelana was taking a video of a waterfall in Maui at the time of the SCP-4312 event.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Huh?\n\n\n[The camera shakes, falls, and dangles from Agent Kelana's neck. It is pointing up toward her face. She is holding on to something off-frame, feet dangling toward the sky.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n What the hell? Okay, okay. I'm safe for now. You're safe, Ab. Just some weird stuff, nothing too crazy, you've seen worse. My camera's dangling the correct down, not\u2026 holy shit.\n\n\n[The leaf supporting Agent Kelana tears loudly and detaches from the trunk of the tree.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Oh come ON!\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Not good not good not good no fucking bueno\u2026 Okay, deep breaths.\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n This has to undo itself sometime. I need a parachute or a glider or\u2026 something. Inventory: I've got my hiking stuff, a decent sized leaf, and a camera.\n\n\n[The camera twists away from Agent Kelana.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Not sure what a call for evac can do here, but if I ever needed one, it's now.\n\n\n[The cap from Agent Kelana's standard-issue distress beacon falls past the camera.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n I'm not going fast. I've got time. I've\u2026 I've got time. Fuck, a sleeping bag won't cut it if I go too high. It's like really shitty flying. Is this a skip? This has to be a skip\u2026 is this happening to everybody?\n\n\n[Agent Kelana can be heard searching her bag.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n God damn it. I set my fucking tablet down to film. Of course. Of fucking course. Could be a whatever-K and I don't get to know.\n\n\n[By this point, the palm tree Agent Kelana clung to is indistinguishable by the camera's current settings.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n How is filming a waterfall at night more dangerous than staffing a fucking jail for monsters?\n\n\n[Agent Kelana grabs the camera, ending the first video and immediately beginning another.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n You guys view these sequentially. This happened when I was viewing a waterfall. If I don't make it\u2026 The previous video had the waterfall in it. Make sure it's not memetic or some shit. I don't know\u2026 I'll get back down and tell you in person.\n\n\n[Agent Kelana lets the camera dangle against the strap again and can be heard searching her bag. After six minutes, she picks up the camera again, holding a makeshift parachute constructed from twine, the palm tree leaf, and her sleeping bag.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n I'm ok if this breaks my legs.\n\n\n[Agent Kelana goes quiet for six seconds.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n It's getting\u2026 kind of hard to breathe, and this thing isn't producing as much drag as I thought.

Shit.\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n I'm dying, aren't I?\n\n\n[Agent Kelana attaches her camera and distress beacon to the parachute.]\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Always thought it'd be more\u2026 violent?\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n Huh.\n\n\nAgent Kelana:\n I'm going to watch the stars.\n\n\n[Agent Kelana throws her parachute towards Earth.
