All fixtures within SCP-1136's containment room must be bolted down or otherwise secured against shifting during a localized directional event. Experimentation with SCP-1136 requires prior permission from at least two (2) Level 3 Senior Researchers, and personnel within SCP-1136's containment area must wear magnetized boots or otherwise be secured against possible shifting.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1136 appears to be a species of small lizard similar to \nHemidactylus frenatus\n (common house gecko) and is physically indistinguishable other than its anomalous property. When specimens of SCP-1136 are startled or frightened, they cause gravity within a radius of approximately 7 to 8\u00a0m to align itself with its orientation, without affecting the specimen itself. This occurs instantaneously and without any measurable change in the physiology of SCP-1136 other than that which is normal for a surprise response in normal \nHemidactylus\n specimens. This effect continues as long as SCP-1136 remains frightened, and the direction of the gravity shift will continuously change to match its current orientation.\n\n\nSCP-1136-01 was discovered on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/198\u2588 following anomalous reports at a local hospital in [REDACTED], wherein several children were admitted with minor injuries and limb fractures after reportedly chasing a gecko up the wall of their classroom. Class A amnestics were administered to all affected civilians, and several SCP-1136-01 specimens were located in and retrieved from the school.\n\n\nAddendum 1136-01:\n Incident Log 1136-012\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 accidentally dropped a clipboard while within SCP-1136-01's enclosure, startling it and causing it to run up the wall of its terrarium. During the subsequent gravity shift, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was thrown against a nearby wall, which further startled SCP-1136-01 and resulted in a cyclical gravity shift that continued for several minutes. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was finally removed and treated for multiple bone fractures and a severe concussion.\n\n\nAddendum 1136-02:\n Experiment Log 1136-021\n\n\nSCP-1136-01 was successfully bred with a normal male \nHemidactylus frenatus\n on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, and its offspring were determined to exhibit the same anomalous property as the original. These specimens have been designated SCP-1136-02 (male) and SCP-1136-03 through SCP-1136-06 (female).\n\n\nAddendum 1136-03:\n Incident Log 1136-019\n\n\nSCP-1136-01 was found dead in its containment area on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588, apparently of natural causes. Dissection of the dead specimen showed no abnormalities or unusual structures.\n\n\nAddendum 1136-04:\n Incident Log 1136-026\n\n\nPermission was granted by Site Command on \u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588 to perform a vivisection on SCP-1136-04. Upon incising into the specimen's abdomen, [DATA EXPUNGED] believed to be a short-lived gravitational singularity which caused catastrophic damage to the experiment site.\n\n\nAddendum 1136-05:\n Researcher Note\n\n\n\n\nFollowing an increasing number of anomalous incidents reported in the [REDACTED] region, it is currently believed that there is a standing wild population of SCP-1136 specimens. A Foundation containment team has been assigned to the area, but due to the small size of SCP-1136 and its similarity to mundane \nHemidactylus\n specimens, complete containment of all wild specimens is expected to be extremely difficult if at all possible.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nSenior Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1135\n | SCP-1136 | \nSCP-1137\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1136\n\" by Aelanna, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
