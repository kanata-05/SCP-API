Roads leading towards Provisional Site-4488 are to be shut down and redirected. Biohazard signs are to be placed within the vicinity so as to deter intruders. A perimeter fence must be erected within a 3km radius of Provisional Site-4488 and is to be monitored by on-site security personnel. A construction team is to be kept on-site to expand the perimeter of Provisional Site 4488 to accommodate further drilling efforts if the need arises. In the event of a containment breach, the perpetrator(s) are to be promptly apprehended, administered Class-A amnestics, and then released.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4488 is a small lake located in a heavily wooded forest near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Montana. At surface level, SCP-4488 appears to be an ordinary lake with no observable anomalous effects. However, at a depth of approximately 20m, a 3m heterogeneous mixture of small rocks, salt crystals and sand are present. Past this space is a seemingly infinite area of saltwater, hereafter referred to as SCP-4488-1. So far, no landforms have been observed within SCP-4488-1, and its exact dimensions are unknown. SCP-4488-1 is completely devoid of light and once inside, there are no currently known ways of exiting SCP-4488.\n\n\nThe only known method of entering SCP-4488-1 is by diving directly into SCP-4488, although further testing is still being conducted (\nSee Addendum 4488-1\n). SCP-4488 first came to the Foundation's attention after various records of unusual geological measurements of SCP-4488's depth were brought to the Foundation's attention. Once further measurements were recorded, SCP-4488's anomalous size was concretely discovered.\n\n\nAddendum 4488-1:\n Attempts are currently being made to drill into SCP-4488-1 through surrounding mountains, which have so far proven to be unsuccessful. All attempts to drill under SCP-4488 result in the discovery of basalt and various other mainly oceanic minerals directly under SCP-4488. Attempts to drill further down under SCP-4488 are currently underway.\n\n\nAddendum 4488-2:\n On 12/11/20\u2588\u2588, An exploration mission was performed into SCP-4488.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?)\u00a0Show\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nShowing\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12/11/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nOverseen by:\n Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nTeam Composition:\n Due to the inability to retrieve individuals who enter SCP-4488-1, the exploration team consists of four Class D personnel, hereafter labelled D-4488-1 through -4, each with past naval experience and/or training. Supplied with one Foundation submarine equipped with several external cameras, along with basic human necessities in order to last the team up to 10 days.\n\n\nMission Goal:\n Gather further information on SCP-4488-1, such as a finite size and possible inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Testing, can everyone hear me?\n\n\n(\nAll team members respond.\n)\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Ok, you may now proceed down SCP-4488.\n\n\nD-4488-3:\n 'Kay quick question, why the hell are we in a sub' on a lake? Don' you think this is a bit to shallow? We just gon' hit a bottom and blow up.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n It's probably a ghost lake.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Shut up you two.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Are you afraid of the ghost lake?\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n No, I'm \nafraid\n you won't shut up any time soon. Now knock it off! you're acting like kids.\n\n\n(\nD-4488-1 begins to rapidly piloting the vessel into SCP-4488, and reaches and enters SCP-4488-1, no events of notice occur for approximately two hours and 100\u00a0km traveled.\n)\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Does anyone else see the fish?\n\n\nD-4488-4:\n Yeah, there's a fish outside on the left. Rainbow trout from what I'm seeing.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n (\nSwitches through exterior cameras.\n) Where? There doesn't seem to be anything visible.\n\n\nD-4488-4:\n You kidding me? It's just right outside man, maybe your cameras don't have good lighting or something.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Position the exterior lights onto the fish.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Proceeding. (\nD-4488 points several exterior lights onto a specific spot outside. However, nothing is visible.\n)\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I still cannot see anything.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n That's odd, everyone here can see that fish right?\n\n\n(\nAll team members agree.\n)\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n It's a ghost fish!\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Shut up!

(\nSnickers.\n)\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Can it 2. What kind of light?\n\n\nD-4488-4:\n What do you mean \"what kind of light?\", it was certainly not a sub, I'll tell yah that much.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n That sound interesting, \nfinally\n something to do. Doc, would you mind if we investigated that?\n\n\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I did not see anything, but if you wish, you may detour.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Sounds great.\n\n\n(\nD-4488-1 pilots the vessel 1\u00a0km west, and then starts to decrease the vessel's speed.\n)\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Ok, now I just saw it, it was a bright blue light, in a curvy line of sorts.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Uh, guys? When that um, thing, showed up, the was a- uh, a head.\n\n\nD-4488-3:\n More specific boy.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Like a snake, beady eyes, scaly, uh, sharp teeth? I think you get what I mean. And what do you mean boy?\n\n\nD-4488-3:\n \nI mean\n you're ackin' like child.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Whatever floats your boat cowboy. Or should I say, whatever sinks your su-\n\n\nD-4488-4:\n There it is again!\n\n\nD-4488-3:\n Hey look, the kid was right. I don' think he knows what an eel is though.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n I know what an eel is old man, but when it glowed that time, did anyone see those, things? Like little things, fishes, whatevers around it reflecting the light?\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n Yeah, that doesn't seem very, uh, friendly, guys.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Team, I am noting that I still don't see anything. I've rewound the recordings, there is nothing on any of the exterior cameras. I'm under the belief that this is a mind affecting anomaly.\n\n\nD-4488-1:\n So we're safe?\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n (\nPause.\n) Yes.\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n That really didn't sound that sure.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You are safe team, all of the organisms you are describing are not real.

However, nothing is visible.\n)\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Team! What is the problem?\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n You didn't see that? There was this, huge blue eel thing attacking the sub! It screechin- roaring at us and as we went going down, there were othe- other things!\n\n\nD-4488-3:\n How in hell didya not see that?\n\n\nD-4488-2:\n Hey doc, maybe, \nyou're\n the one who's going crazy around here.\n\n\n(\nAssorted murmuring throughout the team.\n)\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Team, remain calm.
