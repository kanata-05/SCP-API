SCP-3854 requires no active maintenance, but a wood restoration specialist is to be kept on-site to perform monthly check-ups on the subject.\n\n\nPersonnel that interact with SCP-3854 are to be fluent in Hebrew.\n\n\nAs per Anomalous Sapient Entity protocol, SCP-3854 is to undergo a weekly psychiatric evaluation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3854 is a semi-animate, sapient wooden construct superficially resembling a whale. SCP-3854's external dimensions measure 1.1\u00a0m x 3.2\u00a0m x 1.2\u00a0m, while its internal dimensions (designated SCP-3854-A) measure an approximate 500 square meters. SCP-3854 is cognizant, being able to communicate in Biblical Hebrew, Old Aramaic, and \nHigh Enochian\n1\n. The subject purports to be the aquatic animal that once detained the biblical prophet Jonah, a claim consistent with Assyrian tomes (620-612 BC) from the Horizon Initiative's universal texts. SCP-3854 was recovered washed up on a beach near Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.\n\n\nThe phrase \"\nScrivener Associates\n\" is painted onto the side of SCP-3854 in plain English.\n\n\nSCP-3854-A functions as a self-contained thaumaturge confinement chamber comprised of contiguous layers of \nZiziphus spina-christi\n2\n. The teeth, fins, vertebrae frame, and eyes of SCP-3854 were manufactured by timber derived from a ~2620-year-old ziziphus tree located on the outskirts of Jerusalem.\n\n\nSCP-3854-A-1 is the gastrointestinal domicile that composes the main space of SCP-3854-A, accessible from SCP-3854's mouth. Its construction matches that of modern, Western European synagogues, with the following deviations:\n\n\n\n\nAn abundance of Persian rugs.\n\n\nWalls made of ziziphus bark.\n\n\nWhalebone archways in the place of doors.\n\n\nA ceiling made entirely of whale blubber.\n\n\nTwo portholes corresponding to SCP-3854's eyes, which emit sunlight regardless of time of day.\n\n\nA theater stage in the place of an altar.\n\n\nSeveral Eye of Providence images trained on said theater stage\n\n\nA series of clay tablets detailing several morality plays (see addenda)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3854-A-2 is a postchamber accessible from a doorway at the back of SCP-3854-A-1's theater stage. The room's construction is notably more organic than SCP-3854-A-1, with the walls and ceiling being formed of human epithelial tissue. The floor is made of petrified wood, with select, illuminated spots engraved with Biblical scenes of destruction. The only source of light in SCP-3854-A-2 is SCP-3854-B.\n\n\nSCP-3854-B is the collective designation for 40 enlarged uteri on the far wall of SCP-3854-A-2. The SCP-3854-B are semi-transparent, and backlit by an orange light of indeterminate source. Each instance, except SCP-3854-B-36, contains an apparent\n3\n human zygote.\n\n\nSCP-3854-B-36 is empty, with a visible tear indicating violent struggle from its former contents.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following is a translated\n4\n excerpt of stone tablets found within SCP-3854-A-1. The tablets were primarily written in High Enochian, with portions, such as Jonah's lines, written in Proto-Sinaitic\n5\n. Further transcripts can be found in Appendix-3854.\n\n\n\n\n3854\u00a0Translated\u00a0Script\n\n\n\n\n3854\u00a0Translated\u00a0Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npg-I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMercy!

Candlelight blows out too soon and JONAH must settle with an uneasy rest on the matted floor. He has just fled the only home he has ever known. Meanwhile, atop the deck, a storm occurs. Roaring waves bombard the ship. Scared, some SAILORS begin throwing cargo off board while others pray to their heretical Gods. The CAPTAIN hammers JONAH's door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\n\nCAPTAIN, SAILORs, The VOICE OF THE LORD, and JONAH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\n\nHow can you sleep? Get up! Get up!\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nHuh, what?\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\nYou can sleep later if there is one. Have you not heard the thunderstorms in the sky?\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nYes, I have heard of the thunderstorms in the sky. From you. Just now.\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\nDear Abzu, Lord of the primeval seas, save me from this fool.\n\n\n[Cue derelict wood prop falling beside Jonah]\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\nClose enough, Abzu. Now, hurry Jonah, to the deck. We need more hands to throw out the cargo.\n\n\n[Cue to Jonah feigning tiredness]\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nIf we're going to die anyway, I'd rather do it from the comfiness of a haystack. Come here haystack, yes, be my companion for tonight.\n\n\n[Cue to Jonah fawning over a vaguely feminine hay pillow. STAGHORN-WINGS pulls Jonah up the stairs and through the doorways.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npg-III\n\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\nHow goes it?\n\n\n[Cue to LANCED-MOUTHS shoveling cargo off the ship setpiece.]\n\n\nSAILOR #1:\n\nGrim, we just shoved off two sacks of gold, three barrels of rum, and five men named Steve\n6\n into the water. The ship won't budge.\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\n[It yells] Helmsman, how goes it?\n\n\n[LANCED-MOUTHS falls to the ground, crying and pleading, clutching the false idols hanging around its second neck]\n\n\nSAILOR #2:\n\nOh Anu, here my cry! Damnit. Oh Enki, I beseech thee, quell this storm! Damnit. Oh Marduk, please tell me you're not a fluke.\n\n\n[Cue cymbals banging, spotlight flash. LANCED-MOUTHS shrugs two shoulders and throws out its false idols.]\n\n\nSAILOR #2:\n\nOh well. That's all of them, Captain.\n\n\nCAPTAIN:\n\nDamned, Jonah, you better have a God for us, lest we confuse you for cargo like we did Steve.\n\n\n[Cue to STAGHORN-WINGS making a threatening gesture. Lightning bolt at the top of the mast deployed. Red streamers pop out of the mast, ropes, and sails.]\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nHey Jehovah, cut that out. No means no, and I'm not returning your calls just so I can take a \"paid\" vacation to some foreign country called Nineveh with all manner of molestation and sin. They can rot in a valley.\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nAlright, you know what? No more mister nice-and-benevolent. Convert to me, all of you, then throw Jonah into the big fish.\n\n\n[Cue to a big fish parking next to the ship. LANCED-MOUTHS and STAGHORN-WINGS haul Jonah from where he stands and flings him overboard. They begin praying and singing hymns to the Lord]\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nI hate you all!\n\n\n[Cue to the clouds, storms, and sea pieces receding, fog machine turned off. A sunshine setpiece overhead.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npg-IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n\n\n\nScene 2: Nautical Nightmare!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTING:\n\n\nPink-red walls pulsate around Jonah as he wakes up. His hand burns from accidentally touching acidic liquids that surround the small amount of land underneath him, made of small kidney stones and hardened barnacle. A bizarre emissary unto the Lord \u2014 fluttering countless wings, spinning screaming wheels \u2014 levitates above him. Dishes made of whale meat are prepared for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\n\nThe VOICE OF THE LORD and JONAH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nAhh, my head. Wait, where am I? What is this place?\n\n\n[Cue to voice emanating out of the emissary]\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nYou are inside of a servant of mine.\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nWell I'm staying here. I won't go to Nineveh, nothing you can do or say will make me change my mind on the matter.\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nNow Jonah, why do you think it always has to be about sodomites, thieves, and erroneous beliefs. Sometimes, God gets lonely.\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nYou kept burning all the bushes when I was awake commanding me to go to Nineveh. And when I was asleep, you kept yelling about it from a dream cloud.\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nLook we might've got off on the\u2014 Hey wait a minute, I'm the Lord your God, I don't have to take this from you. Do your job or I sink you in whale acid.\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nBut it's a big fish?\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nThat's not how your descendants will remember it if you live that long.\n\n\nJONAH:\n\nAlright, alright. O, Lord, slow to anger, fury and all manner of retribution. Your pity hath shaped me, the beast that serves you and humbles me in digestive fluids. Sinners and sodomites shall learn that you forgive iniquity and transgression and sin. I am cured!\n\n\nVOICE OF THE LORD:\n\nThe Lord, God will by no means absolve the guilty, but by gracious mercy and primordial seas, the Lord shall enter their hearth and wash them clean. You are dismissed, my child. Go to Nineveh unmolested.\n\n\n[The walls scrunch up and a sneeze is heard. Jonah is spat out of a blowhole.]\n\n\n{Continued in Appendix-3854}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n On 12/19/1986, shortly after the initial exploration of SCP-3854-A, SCP-3854 regained consciousness.
