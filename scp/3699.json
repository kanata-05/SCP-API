A dedicated taskforce is to track down any SCP-3699-1 instances in the possession of civilians and retrieve them, applying full amnestics to any civilians aware of SCP-3699's or SCP-3699-1's anomalous effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3699 refers to Cley Beach, Norfolk, England. SCP-3699 is a shingle beach, predominantly composed of small rocks and stones. SCP-3699's anomalous properties are not apparent unless a shingle stone is removed from SCP-3699. These stones are henceforth referred to as SCP-3699-1 instances.\n\n\nApproximately 10 days after being removed from SCP-3699 by a human, SCP-3699-1 instances will begin to vocalise English in a \"Received Pronounciation\" accent, despite possessing no mechanisms for speech. SCP-3699-1 instances have been described as highly intelligent and articulate, and have proven cooperative with Foundation questioning.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1 instances are sapient, and possess fully-realised personalities and memories. They ordinarily claim to possess names traditionally found in England. SCP-3699-1 instances are apparently capable of remembering their entire existence as a shingle-rock, while also remembering every larger object they were once part of.\n\n\nThe origin of SCP-3699 is unknown. It is also unknown how SCP-3699-1 instances are capable of vocalisation, given how in all physical aspects they resemble ordinary pieces of rock. SCP-3699-1 instances exhibit no other anomalous behaviour. Returning an SCP-3699-1 instance to SCP-3699 causes their anomalous properties to deactivate, until they are once more removed from SCP-3699.\n\n\nSee below for samples of interviews with SCP-3699-1 instances.\n\n\n\n\n+Interview\u00a03699-3\n\n\n\n\n-Interview\u00a03699-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3699-1-1, who goes by the name of \"Roderick\" and speaks with a male voice.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Maria F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, lead researcher on SCP-3699.\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted 22/06/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Could you tell us a little about yourself, please?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n By all means. My name is Roderick. I am a small shingle stone. There isn't really very much to say about me beyond that. I first became me several hundred years ago, when a rock hit my mother. It was mildly traumatic, to say the least.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \u2026Your mother?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Yes. Well, an approximation thereof. I mean the larger rock from which I was chipped off. I used to be her, and have memories of being her. It's a strange life, being a pebble of good breeding.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I\u2026see.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n This must sound very strange to you. I apologise. You have all been so hospitable here. I don't want to alarm you with what must seem to be deviant practices.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Er, no, no, not at all\u2026 tell me about your life since then. How did you end up at Cley?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Oh, I couldn't possibly tell you all about it. I've been tossed onto shores all across the oceans. I've been swallowed by whales, spat out into Pacific waters, lain untouched on the shores of Africa, Asia, Peru. I've been skimmed over the waves by peasant-boys in medieval France, wedged into miniature sand-pavilions in 17th-century Siam, tossed to and fro along the sea. Most of the time, it's pretty boring.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And have you always been able to, erm, think?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Oh, I believe so. I remember so many things. Being wedged into the side of a wooden boat- the \nMary-Rose\n, I think it was called. It sank, of course, and I along with it. Like a stone. Hah.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n When did you first arrive at Cley Beach?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Oh\u2026 several years ago now, I think. I can't remember the date precisely- you know how it is with these things. It's a nice place to live. We talk, debate, discuss good literature and where the best waters are. We count the stars, and remember when we\u2026 when we were them. Out in the void.\n\n\nI do apologise, Doctor- I'm feeling a little tired. Being a stone gets a little tiring after a while, you see.

But I suppose that your intentions are pure. I am a small rock.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I was, erm, more referring to the fact that you're different from the other rocks.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Am I? Well, a girl does like to be complimented, but perhaps save that for the second date.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \u2026Let's change the subject.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n A splendid idea, my dear. So, have you ever been in love?\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Wh- er, yes. I am married.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Ah, but your human coupling is so straightforward. It\u2019s different for a small rock. You see, we are inanimate objects, which means that our love-life is entirely dependent upon random chance and circumstance.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Sometimes I think ours is as well.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Hah! Perhaps you are right. Well, it is worse for us, I'm afraid, and mine is a sad tale.\n\n\nMany years ago, when I was younger and my surfaces less smooth, I found myself being tossed to and fro by fierce waves. It was somewhere off the coast of Spain, I think, and I ended up being tossed onto a beach in the Basque Country. Well, I wasn\u2019t overly happy about this predicament. I\u2019m not really one for sitting still. It\u2019s an inconvenient habit when you\u2019re a rock.\n\n\nBut then! Out of nowhere, the sea tosses over this limpet-shell, right on top of me. It was love at first sight. She was called Simone, and she was beautiful.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You mean- you can talk, even when you haven\u2019t come from Cley Beach?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Oh yes. Only to one another, though. You lot can\u2019t hear us normally. You can\u2019t hear sea-shells either, but I don\u2019t blame you. They have odd sounding voices. Very\u2026 curved, for want of a better word. Do you understand?\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I think so. What was special about this seashell, then?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Oh, what a gorgeous creature she was. The limpet had died ages ago, so she was free, and happy. She\u2019d fallen on top of me, and stayed there. Oh, the times we had! We discussed theology, history, the works of Sartre. She loved surrealist art, whereas I always preferred cubism. I\u2019ve never met a seashell who was as brilliant, well-educated and serene.\n\n\nShe always knew just how to keep me calm and sane, even when we were in danger of being washed away. We clung together in our little embrace for decades, laughing and talking and loving one another. It was perfect.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \u2026So what happened?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n What always happens to us and ours. She was washed away. I wept for a week, hoping she\u2019d return, but she never did. I was buried beneath the shingle for another year after that, before I was swept away too. I never saw her again- and if she\u2019s even still alive, I likely never will.\n\n\nMine is a sad song. But now I am here, in the company of a beautiful woman. It got lonely, on the beach, you know. Listening to the constant chatter of the land-dwellers and newcomers. I \nmuch\n prefer it here.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \u2026I think we'd better leave it there.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Interview\u00a03699-26\n\n\n\n\n-Interview\u00a03699-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3699-1-1, SCP-3699-1-2, SCP-3699-1-3 (who goes by the name of \"Christine\" and speaks with a female voice) and SCP-3699-1-4 (who goes by the name of \"Nigel\" and speaks with a male voice).\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted 29/11/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So, of all of the places you have visited, which do you prefer?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Cadiz was nice.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Ah, Cadiz! I remember the ships there. Coming in and out, towering over me. Things were different then.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Yes, they were. Waters were purer. People were more civilised.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n No they weren\u2019t! I remember what was on some of those ships.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Well, at least they were more civilised towards us.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Oh yes.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n Quite.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n They didn\u2019t pollute the beaches with their bags and litter.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n Urgh, yes. So vulgar. Metal cans clanking about the place.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n And the chips\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Oh God, yes, the chips! Makes the seagulls flock around in their squawking. So vulgar.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Disgraceful.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n It's a good thing we ended up at Cley, you know. Not as many people to bother us.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Well, there is the constant chatter of newcomers. You know what they're like. The humans can't hear them yet, of course, but some stones never listen to what their elders and betters tell them, so they witter on regardless.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Quite! The humans can't hear them unless they're \noff\n the beach. Dozy bunch of shale. They hear of Cley's reputation and they come here, pig-ignorant, and quite spoil the place for the rest of us with their inane babble!\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n Shocking. Simply shocking.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Mind you\u2026 there are some good things about the modern day.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n That\u2019s true. Fewer shipwrecks.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Yes, they were always nasty. The sight of the bodies, the stench of the water\u2026 the fear in their glassy eyes\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n The ones who lived were the worst.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n The way they\u2019d linger.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n And the rocks are different too. Not so craggy.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Less blood.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n More!\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n No, less. Maybe more gets in the water, but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not like the rivers that would flow in devotion to some pagan deity. The blood of sacrifice.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n Of faith and war.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Yes. Of faith and war.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-4:\n Skies are still the same, though.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Indeed. The same greyness in the clouds. The same slightness as the sun shines through it.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Same darkness in the shadow of the sun.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-3:\n Ah, we are old my dears, we are old.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-2:\n As old as the universe.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Older, maybe.

Well, that\u2019s a hard thing to work out. My earliest in my current form, do you mean?\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No, I meant the earliest memory of any form. Going back as far as possible.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Ah, well, that\u2019s tougher. Things get so\u2026 mixed-up when you go that far back. I was me, and before that a larger rock, and then a larger, a larger, and so on. All the way back to the greatest rock of all; the earth.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n The earth? You remember being the earth?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Oh yes. We all do. Most of us are from her originally, though there are plenty of space-rocks and moon-chips too. It was a good time. I-we-hurtled through space with the force of a thousand suns. I was on fire, burning through the heavens. Great startling lines and shapes of colour and fury went passed me. No life back then; just the roar, the endless roar as we plummeted through the cosmos. I was vast, limitless, glorious. And now I\u2019m a small pebble. Funny how things work out.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Do you remember being anything before the earth?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n Larger rocks. Parts of separate rocks, merged together in the fire. Little rocks in between. Mostly\u2026 mostly I just remember fire and darkness, endlessly cycling together. I was many rocks. I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. This is proving hard to remember.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Just take your time. What is the very earliest thing you can remember? Before all of this?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n I\u2026 there\u2026 there was one. Just one. Without knowledge or light or life. Compressed into a single instant. Forever, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t forever. And I remember\u2026\n\n\nI'm sorry, doctor. This is all hard to recall. A lot of our free time is spent gazing upwards, at the fires and lights in the sky, remembering when we were all together. We sometimes sit at twilight, just trying to make everything out in a time we barely recall\u2026\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n It's alright. Take your time.\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n I remember\u2026 before. The ghosts. The things before matter. I\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\nNo. I don\u2019t recollect anything. It\u2019s not even a memory, you see. It\u2019s just a- a feeling, you know? Like it\u2019s on the tip of your tongue, but you can\u2019t quite recall. Something different. Something strange. Something that was once, and will be again.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Will be again?\n\n\nSCP-3699-1-1:\n I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, doctor.

Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sometimes I think ours is as well. SCP-3699-1-2: Hah! Perhaps you are right. Well, it is worse for us, I'm afraid, and mine is a sad tale. Many years ago, when I was younger and my surfaces less smooth, I found myself being tossed to and fro by fierce waves. It was somewhere off the coast of Spain, I think, and I ended up being tossed onto a beach in the Basque Country. Well, I wasn\u2019t overly happy about this predicament. I\u2019m not really one for sitting still. It\u2019s an inconvenient habit when you\u2019re a rock. But then! Out of nowhere, the sea tosses over this limpet-shell, right on top of me. It was love at first sight. She was called Simone, and she was beautiful. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You mean- you can talk, even when you haven\u2019t come from Cley Beach? SCP-3699-1-2: Oh yes. Only to one another, though. You lot can\u2019t hear us normally. You can\u2019t hear sea-shells either, but I don\u2019t blame you. They have odd sounding voices. Very\u2026 curved, for want of a better word. Do you understand? Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I think so. What was special about this seashell, then? SCP-3699-1-2: Oh, what a gorgeous creature she was. The limpet had died ages ago, so she was free, and happy. She\u2019d fallen on top of me, and stayed there. Oh, the times we had! We discussed theology, history, the works of Sartre. She loved surrealist art, whereas I always preferred cubism. I\u2019ve never met a seashell who was as brilliant, well-educated and serene. She always knew just how to keep me calm and sane, even when we were in danger of being washed away. We clung together in our little embrace for decades, laughing and talking and loving one another. It was perfect. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u2026So what happened? SCP-3699-1-2: What always happens to us and ours. She was washed away. I wept for a week, hoping she\u2019d return, but she never did. I was buried beneath the shingle for another year after that, before I was swept away too. I never saw her again- and if she\u2019s even still alive, I likely never will. Mine is a sad song. But now I am here, in the company of a beautiful woman. It got lonely, on the beach, you know. Listening to the constant chatter of the land-dwellers and newcomers. I much prefer it here. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u2026I think we'd better leave it there. <End Log>",

SCP-3699-1-2: Cadiz was nice. SCP-3699-1-3: Ah, Cadiz! I remember the ships there. Coming in and out, towering over me. Things were different then. SCP-3699-1-2: Yes, they were. Waters were purer. People were more civilised. SCP-3699-1-4: No they weren\u2019t! I remember what was on some of those ships. SCP-3699-1-1: Well, at least they were more civilised towards us. SCP-3699-1-2: Oh yes. SCP-3699-1-4: Quite. SCP-3699-1-3: They didn\u2019t pollute the beaches with their bags and litter. SCP-3699-1-4: Urgh, yes. So vulgar. Metal cans clanking about the place. SCP-3699-1-2: And the chips\u2026 SCP-3699-1-3: Oh God, yes, the chips! Makes the seagulls flock around in their squawking. So vulgar. SCP-3699-1-2: Disgraceful. SCP-3699-1-3: It's a good thing we ended up at Cley, you know. Not as many people to bother us. SCP-3699-1-2: Well, there is the constant chatter of newcomers. You know what they're like. The humans can't hear them yet, of course, but some stones never listen to what their elders and betters tell them, so they witter on regardless. SCP-3699-1-3: Quite! The humans can't hear them unless they're off the beach. Dozy bunch of shale. They hear of Cley's reputation and they come here, pig-ignorant, and quite spoil the place for the rest of us with their inane babble! SCP-3699-1-4: Shocking. Simply shocking. SCP-3699-1-3: Mind you\u2026 there are some good things about the modern day. SCP-3699-1-2: That\u2019s true. Fewer shipwrecks. SCP-3699-1-1: Yes, they were always nasty. The sight of the bodies, the stench of the water\u2026 the fear in their glassy eyes\u2026 SCP-3699-1-3: The ones who lived were the worst. SCP-3699-1-1: The way they\u2019d linger. SCP-3699-1-4: And the rocks are different too. Not so craggy. SCP-3699-1-3: Less blood. SCP-3699-1-2: More! SCP-3699-1-3: No, less. Maybe more gets in the water, but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not like the rivers that would flow in devotion to some pagan deity. The blood of sacrifice. SCP-3699-1-2: Of faith and war. SCP-3699-1-1: Yes. Of faith and war. SCP-3699-1-4: Skies are still the same, though. SCP-3699-1-3: Indeed. The same greyness in the clouds. The same slightness as the sun shines through it. SCP-3699-1-1: Same darkness in the shadow of the sun. SCP-3699-1-3: Ah, we are old my dears, we are old. SCP-3699-1-2: As old as the universe. SCP-3699-1-1: Older, maybe. Memories get fuzzy around then. SCP-3699-1-4: Yes. The same memories. SCP-3699-1-1: Forever. <End Log>",

Interviewer: Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Foreword: This interview was conducted 31/12/20\u2588\u2588. <Begin Log> Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What is your earliest memory? SCP-3699-1-1: My earliest? Well, that\u2019s a hard thing to work out. My earliest in my current form, do you mean? Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No, I meant the earliest memory of any form. Going back as far as possible. SCP-3699-1-1: Ah, well, that\u2019s tougher. Things get so\u2026 mixed-up when you go that far back. I was me, and before that a larger rock, and then a larger, a larger, and so on. All the way back to the greatest rock of all; the earth. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The earth? You remember being the earth? SCP-3699-1-1: Oh yes. We all do. Most of us are from her originally, though there are plenty of space-rocks and moon-chips too. It was a good time. I-we-hurtled through space with the force of a thousand suns. I was on fire, burning through the heavens. Great startling lines and shapes of colour and fury went passed me. No life back then; just the roar, the endless roar as we plummeted through the cosmos. I was vast, limitless, glorious. And now I\u2019m a small pebble. Funny how things work out. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Do you remember being anything before the earth? SCP-3699-1-1: Larger rocks. Parts of separate rocks, merged together in the fire. Little rocks in between. Mostly\u2026 mostly I just remember fire and darkness, endlessly cycling together. I was many rocks. I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. This is proving hard to remember. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Just take your time. What is the very earliest thing you can remember? Before all of this? SCP-3699-1-1: I\u2026 there\u2026 there was one. Just one. Without knowledge or light or life. Compressed into a single instant. Forever, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t forever. And I remember\u2026 I'm sorry, doctor. This is all hard to recall. A lot of our free time is spent gazing upwards, at the fires and lights in the sky, remembering when we were all together. We sometimes sit at twilight, just trying to make everything out in a time we barely recall\u2026 Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It's alright. Take your time. SCP-3699-1-1: I remember\u2026 before. The ghosts. The things before matter. I\u2026 I\u2026 No. I don\u2019t recollect anything. It\u2019s not even a memory, you see. It\u2019s just a- a feeling, you know? Like it\u2019s on the tip of your tongue, but you can\u2019t quite recall. Something different. Something strange. Something that was once, and will be again. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Will be again? SCP-3699-1-1: I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, doctor. I think we\u2019ll have to end it here. <End Log>",
