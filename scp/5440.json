Two security personnel are to remain present in the pavilion at all times to prevent civilian exposure.\n\n\nAll public and personal records containing evidence regarding SCP-5440 are to be confiscated, destroyed, and/or discredited; all witnesses will be amnesticisized and released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-5440 was a phenomenon affecting a Scarlet Bush (\nHamelia patens\n) located in the University of Florida's botanical garden. SCP-5440 caused the bush to spontaneously combust and remain burning for approximately two and a half hours. This process did no damage to the affected bush, nor the surrounding vegetation. During the duration of SCP-5440, a disembodied voice (designated SCP-5440-1) could be heard near the bush. SCP-5440-1 spoke in fluent English and was able to engage in conversation. The process that created the SCP-5440 phenomenon is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nOn 2020/04/21 at 9:45 AM GMT, SCP-5440 began and all attempts by campus staff to extinguish the fire were met with failure. At 10:00 AM, SCP-5440-1 began vocalizing the \"Lord's prayer\" and continued to do so repeatedly for one and a half hours. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5440 through rumors of a \"talking bush\", spread through UoF student's social media accounts. It was at this time that a Foundation containment team was dispatched to conceal and recover SCP-5440.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report\n\n\nInitial containment procedures were established by Preliminary Containment Team Charlie-24 at 11:30 AM. At this time, personnel attempted to communicate with SCP-5440-1; the following is a transcript of the encounter.\n\n\n\n\n\u274f\u00a0Interview\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Interview\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0\u2750\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020/04/21\u00a011:45 AM GMT\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Containment Specialist Victor Redfield\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5440-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRedfield:\n H-hello, I'd like to speak with you, if you're done with the praying.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n God? I can't believe it worked! God, I must ask for your mercy, please lend my sister aid.\n\n\nRedfield:\n I'm not\u2013 My name is Victor, I'm definitely not anybody's \"god\".\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n V-Victor? I don't understand, Lord. Have you not heard my prayers?\n\n\nRedfield:\n What are you talking about?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Gran, she done tole us\u2026 She done said t'would work! I prayed at the firebush, just like she say, and you done answered\u2026 y-you must be the Lord.\n\n\nRedfield:\n Kid listen, I'm not God. I don't know what's happening here, but I know that for certain.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Please, I need help! My sister done gotten hurt, an' she ain't right. My pa, he ain't here, an' I don't rightly ken what needs doin'. Please\u2026 Victor.\n\n\nRedfield:\n I can't help if I don't know where you are.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n I'm right here! Right in front of your bush, uh, you.\n\n\nRedfield:\n Kid, I'm in fron\u2013, where is the bush?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Out back behind the house, of course.\n\n\nRedfield:\n And \nwhere\n is your home?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1\n We're stayin' in Hogtown, north side of the old Arredondo Grant. Least that's what pa's always sayin'. Please I ain't got ti\u2013\n\n\nRedfield:\n Arredondo? Is that Florida? What date is it, kid?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Why does that\u2013 Uh, fourth ah August, the year of our\u2026 uh, 1832.\n\n\nRedfield:\n Jesus.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Is he with you? He can surely save Annabelle!\n\n\nRedfield:\n No, I.. Um, listen, kid, I don't know if I can help you. You're\u2026 Uh, really far away.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Please, she's bleedin' real bad! I done tore one of ma's old sheets like I done see Doc Willems do, but I\u2013 I can't get it to stop!\n\n\nRedfield:\n What happened?\n\n\nSCP-5440:\n She fell\u2013 she fell on the garden stake. I done pull out of her leg but\u2026 the bleedin' won't stop, and pa done gone 'round to\u2013 he aint fixin' to be back for at least two nights!\n\n\nRedfield:\n Shit\u2026 Um, I can\u2013 \nmight\n, be able to help you. But you have to listen to me carefully.\n\n\n[\nRedacted for Brevity:\n Junior Specialist Redfield explains to SCP-5440, in detail, rudimentary wound care utilizing objects found within SCP-5440-1's residence. After 35 minutes, SCP-5440-1 successfully stitches and dresses the wound.]\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n I can't thank you enough, Victor, you done saved Annabelle!\n\n\nRedfield:\n I don't know about that, kid, you did all the work; I just helped you along.\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n Never you mind that, mister. I rightly ken I'm in your debt, now. How could I ever repay you?\n\n\nRedfield:\n Well, now that you mention it. Can you tell me how you contacted me?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n You don't know? I said the prayer, 'course. Jus' like Gran always said to.\n\n\nRedfield:\n Could you tell me this prayer?\n\n\nSCP-5440-1:\n I ain't seein' a reason not to, you done saved my sister. Gran done told it to me like this\u2013\n\n\n[SCP-5440-1 begins speaking an unknown language\n1\n for approximately two minutes, at which time SCP-5440 extinguishes and the anomalous phenomenon terminates.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this event, the bush affected by SCP-5440 was kept under surveillance for additional anomalous phenomena. After one week SCP-5440 was re-designated neutralized. Victor Redfield was reprimanded for improper interview protocol and placed on a one-week paid leave. Due to the nature of the incident, this disciplinary action will not be included on Victor Redfield's permanent record.\n\n\nAttempts to recreate SCP-5440 using the incantation provided by SCP-5440-1 have met with failure. The Thaumaturgy Division's analysis revealed no adherent thaumaturgical value to the incantation, indicating an unknown factor or prerequisite must be required. Testing has been abandoned indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
