A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-GATEWAY) has been put in place to extensively monitor online discussion boards and flag possible descriptions of SCP-4659-1 instances or SCP-4659-2. An MTF unit is to evaluate these claims and determine by a case-by-case basis whether the issuing of amnestics is necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4659 refers to a series of videos which periodically manifested on the hardwares of various computers over an approximate period of 05/15/2005 and 06/27/2005. These videos, individually designated SCP-4659-1-1 through -12, manifested on an estimated 15 computers per video, and all appear to be operated and produced by one individual, hereafter designated SCP-4659-2.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2 is a vaguely humanoid entity which appears to reside in an extradimensional location currently unknown to the Foundation. Though it appears not to possess any means for visual observation, SCP-4659-2 demonstrates an ability to see, and instead of individual digits, SCP-4659-2 possesses seven small tendrils. Notably, SCP-4659-2 completely lacks facial features, save for a large, black spheroid structure in the middle of its face, which it vibrates to mimic the sound of human speech\n1\n.\n\n\nThe structure of most SCP-4659-1 instances\n2\n follow the typical format of an online film review. At the beginning of each of these videos, SCP-4659-2 will shortly introduce the film\n3\n that it will be reviewing, usually in an exaggerated manner. For the middle portion of the video, footage of the film in question will be interspersed with various comments made by SCP-4659-2 about the film, typically for comedic effect. This middle portion continues for an average of 5-6 minutes, after which SCP-4659-2 will summarize its opinion of the film before ending the video with a plea to continue watching its content along with a link to its email for future video suggestions\n4\n, the only known means of communication with SCP-4659-2.\n\n\nAddendum 4659.1:\n Excerpt from SCP-4659-1-2\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0scpfn://4659/videos/1.2.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0CLOSE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG EXCERPT OF SCP-4659-1-2\n\n\n\n\nInstance Title:\n5\n \"Captain of Agvofala\" Review\n\n\nDuration:\n 08:31\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe video begins at a shot of SCP-4659-2 up to its waist.

Patterson\n\n\nSupporting Personnel*:\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher James P. Sullivan\n\n\nJunior Researcher Eliza S. Hernstein\n\n\nJunior Researcher Zachary L. Browne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal:\n At its current pace, SCP-4659 poses an imminent threat to the Foundation's veil of secrecy. The proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances appears to be growing exponentially, and while the Foundation has been able to suppress much of the information about SCP-4659 both on- and off-line, the current growth trends signify an increasing difficulty of containment efforts and a possible lifting of the veil.\n\n\nThe problems posed by SCP-4659 are twofold:\n\n\n\n\nUnlike other anomalies which proliferate on the Internet, SCP-4659 directly manifests onto hardware, which does not easily register to Foundation webcrawlers or bots. While numerous computer models are able to have their hardware monitored by the Foundation (including IBM, Dell, and Apple), the growing variety of computer models leaves SCP-4659 vulnerable to discovery, and in some cases, spreading. In fact, current models estimate that 2-3% of all SCP-4659-1 instances are discovered without Foundation intervention. Combined with the possibility that dissemination of SCP-4659 can extend beyond hardware (as evidenced by a radio station in Willoughby, OH being intercepted to play the audio of an SCP-4659-1 instance), containment of SCP-4659 will soon become near-impossible.\n\n\nUnlike other anomalies broadcasted from extradimensional locations, the amount of production value which would have to go into fabricating SCP-4659 is close to unbelievable. Even if it were simpler to explain the content of SCP-4659-1 instances away as parody or satire, the method by which SCP-4659-1 instances are disseminated is difficult to easily justify.\n\n\n\n\nAs attempting to contain SCP-4659 in the two approaches explained above is proving to be sharply decreasing in expediency, we are therefore proposing that SCP-4659 be considered for decommissioning.\n\n\nMethod(s):\n In order to discourage the further production of SCP-4659-1 instances, we are proposing to attempt direct contact with SCP-4659-2 via its provided business email (which has since been deactivated to non-Foundation personnel) in order to convince it to terminate the creation of SCP-4659. Along with the execution of current containment procedures, planned course of action is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nDemand the forced discontinuation of the production of SCP-4659-1 instances to SCP-4659-2 under the guise of:\n\n\n\nProfane and obscene content\n\n\nCopyright infringement\n\n\nHarassment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould SCP-4659-2 be unwilling to comply with these requests, manufacture negative reception of SCP-4659 in emails directed towards SCP-4659-2.\n\n\n\n\nOur hopes are that this protocol will dissuade SCP-4659-2 from making new SCP-4659-1 instances due to an overwhelmingly negative reception. Further methods are to be discussed should either of these methods fail in the discontinuation of SCP-4659 production.\n\n\n\u2014 Sen.

It appears to be holding the camera for themselves.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2:\n Hey, uh, so that was just a little \u2014 summary of what's been happening, of some of the hate I've been getting online as of recently. Probably not any of y'all, though, y'all are cool like that\u2026\n\n\nOh, and if you uh, like the video, be sure to send me an email saying that you liked it. I haven't been getting too much of those, and feedback always helps \u2014 I'm new to this whole video thing, so it always helps to hear what y'all think.\n\n\nUh, so some people have been pointing at my stuff that I do, and they're saying, you know, \"Oh, the Dissector's an, uh, they're nitpicky, they're unfunny, your show is bad, the movies are copyrighted, cancel it already, yadda yadda\u2026\" And, you know, those types who're saying all these things about me, this video goes out to them. Really, all I can say is, if you have to resort to name-calling like that, I'd just like to politely ask you to stay the \nfuck\n outta my business, okay?\n\n\nLook, if you've got nothing to say, don't say it. Unless you're coming to me for constructive criticism, don't be coming out here and saying I hate this and I hate that just 'cause I make jokes about me not liking 'em. They're jokes, alright? Don't take them too seriously. No, really, cut it out. Let me do what I want. Fuck y'all.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2 raises its left hand and sticks up its middle tendril, pushing the hand closer to the camera and making a brief hissing noise.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2:\n All right, now that that's over, here's a little sneak peek of my next video. Hope you like it.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4659.4:\n Decommissioning Proposal Revision, 06/10/2005\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0scpfn://4659/documents/decom2.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0CLOSE\u00a0DOCUMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED REVISIONS TO SCP-4659 DECOMMISSIONING\n\n\n\n\nSubmission Item #:\n SCP-4659\n\n\nSubmission Containment Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSubmission Project Head:\n Senior Researcher Diane J.

Josefiak\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal:\n While the current decommissioning efforts have managed to maintain contact with SCP-4659-2, the measures that have been taken have only led to an increase in the production and proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances. SCP-4659-2 has demonstrated hostility to the advances the Foundation made in order to convince it to cease SCP-4659 production, dismissing the initiated comments as being unfounded and useless, and in apparent spite towards the Foundation's efforts, SCP-4659-2 has apparently accelerated the production of new SCP-4659 instances. It is apparent that the current efforts put in place have significantly exacerbated efforts of containment; therefore, we are proposing several revisions to the decommissioning protocol.\n\n\nMethod(s):\n Given that SCP-4659-2 has been invariably hostile to any directly negative feedback, and given that SCP-4659-2 has at numerous times asked for constructive criticism of SCP-4659 from its followers, we therefore propose the following course of action:\n\n\n\n\nWhile posing as followers of SCP-4659, offer faulty advice to SCP-4659-2 about how it can improve future SCP-4659-1 instances. Current proposals for advice center around components which are more difficult to fulfill, such as:\n\n\n\nProducing longer videos\n\n\nIncluding more visual aids\n\n\nUtilizing more props and clothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile still under the guise of SCP-4659 followers, issue negative feedback about the newly produced SCP-4659-1 instances.\n\n\n\n\nOur hopes for this new protocol are that, in discovering the adverse appraisal from its supposed followers, SCP-4659-2 will become dissatisfied in making newer SCP-4659-1 instances due to its negative reception.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission Consensus (DD):\n RATIFIED \n\u25cf\n (3-2-2)\n\n\n \n\n\n* Must be of level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4659.5:\n Excerpt from SCP-4659-1-12\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0scpfn://4659/videos/1.12.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0CLOSE\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG EXCERPT OF SCP-4659-1-12\n\n\n\n\nInstance Title:\n DISSECTOR REVIEWS EPISODE 8: \"TIME AND TIME AGAIN\"\n\n\nDuration:\n 19:43\n\n\nForeword:\n At this point, a week prior to the release of this video, the Foundation had issued numerous emails to SCP-4659-2 per decommissioning protocol.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe video begins with SCP-4659-2 seated at a table, dressed in a crudely constructed outfit composing of green, blue, red, and black chunks of fabric.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2:\n \n(Shouting)\n Hi all, it's me, the Dissector. Now, before the video starts, and it's a long one, I just wanna give a huge shout-out to y'all for reaching out to me and helping me with all of this. You can probably see I've made a custom outfit right here, spent a couple nights workin' on it. Y'all also told me to work on the editing, on the visuals a bit more, and I think it came out really nice, so hope you like it. Also cut some of the swearing out, some of you were complaining about that. Hey, I'm telling you, it's a lot harder than it looks. And if you turn around the camera\u2026\n\n\nThe camera swivels around to reveal another entity similar to SCP-4659-2 holding it. Camera swivels back to SCP-4659-2.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2:\n \n(Shouting)\n Now hey, would you look at that, I got myself a cameraman! Would you go ahead and say hi for me, Qopianto?\n\n\nSounds of gargling behind the camera.\n\n\nSCP-4659-2:\n \n(Shouting)\n Ah, what the hell. Uh, anyway, I worked really, really hard on all this new stuff for you all, so it would help if you'd give some feedback on this video and tell me if you liked it. Even got some skits for you here, think y'all might like those.

Go away, you puddle of \u2014 Video abruptly cuts to a shot of SCP-4659-2 in its normal attire out of character. It appears to be holding the camera for themselves. SCP-4659-2: Hey, uh, so that was just a little \u2014 summary of what's been happening, of some of the hate I've been getting online as of recently. Probably not any of y'all, though, y'all are cool like that\u2026 Oh, and if you uh, like the video, be sure to send me an email saying that you liked it. I haven't been getting too much of those, and feedback always helps \u2014 I'm new to this whole video thing, so it always helps to hear what y'all think. Uh, so some people have been pointing at my stuff that I do, and they're saying, you know, \"Oh, the Dissector's an, uh, they're nitpicky, they're unfunny, your show is bad, the movies are copyrighted, cancel it already, yadda yadda\u2026\" And, you know, those types who're saying all these things about me, this video goes out to them. Really, all I can say is, if you have to resort to name-calling like that, I'd just like to politely ask you to stay the fuck outta my business, okay? Look, if you've got nothing to say, don't say it. Unless you're coming to me for constructive criticism, don't be coming out here and saying I hate this and I hate that just 'cause I make jokes about me not liking 'em. They're jokes, alright? Don't take them too seriously. No, really, cut it out. Let me do what I want. Fuck y'all. SCP-4659-2 raises its left hand and sticks up its middle tendril, pushing the hand closer to the camera and making a brief hissing noise. SCP-4659-2: All right, now that that's over, here's a little sneak peek of my next video. Hope you like it. [END LOG]",
        "VIDEO LOG EXCERPT OF SCP-4659-1-12 Instance Title: DISSECTOR REVIEWS EPISODE 8: \"TIME AND TIME AGAIN\" Duration: 19:43 Foreword: At this point, a week prior to the release of this video, the Foundation had issued numerous emails to SCP-4659-2 per decommissioning protocol. [BEGIN LOG] The video begins with SCP-4659-2 seated at a table, dressed in a crudely constructed outfit composing of green, blue, red, and black chunks of fabric. SCP-4659-2: (Shouting) Hi all, it's me, the Dissector. Now, before the video starts, and it's a long one, I just wanna give a huge shout-out to y'all for reaching out to me and helping me with all of this. You can probably see I've made a custom outfit right here, spent a couple nights workin' on it. Y'all also told me to work on the editing, on the visuals a bit more, and I think it came out really nice, so hope you like it. Also cut some of the swearing out, some of you were complaining about that. Hey, I'm telling you, it's a lot harder than it looks. And if you turn around the camera\u2026 The camera swivels around to reveal another entity similar to SCP-4659-2 holding it. Camera swivels back to SCP-4659-2. SCP-4659-2: (Shouting) Now hey, would you look at that, I got myself a cameraman! Would you go ahead and say hi for me, Qopianto? Sounds of gargling behind the camera. SCP-4659-2: (Shouting) Ah, what the hell. Uh, anyway, I worked really, really hard on all this new stuff for you all, so it would help if you'd give some feedback on this video and tell me if you liked it. Even got some skits for you here, think y'all might like those. Well, I've done enough talking for now, on with the video! [END LOG]",
