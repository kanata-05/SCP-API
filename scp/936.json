Approximately once a month, the plantation is to be screened for any SCP-936-1 by two (2) D-Class personnel of adequate physical ability and SCP-936-1 are to be harvested according to site plan.\n\n\nHarvested SCP-936-2 \nare to be incinerated\n if unused, can be fed to contained carnivores upon removal of seeds, which are to be incinerated.\n\n\nFollowing Incident 936-1, the D-class personnel performing the screening are to be screened thoroughly for infectious diseases, and are to use sterile gloves and facial filters to prevent contamination.\n\n\nUncontained SCP-936 instances are to be dug out and any SCP-936-1 and SCP-936-2 incinerated. For purposes of containment, the Foundation is to ensure SCP-936 is declared an invasive species by local governments; a censored description is to be made public for this purpose.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-936 is a species of deciduous, self-pollinating tree resembling \nFagus sylvatica\n, inhabiting the region of northern and eastern Europe, most notably clustering around \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ukraine. SCP-936 is capable of forming clonal colonies, the ol[DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nIt has been shown that the roots of SCP-936 are host to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, similarly to the legumes - as during most of its lifecycle, the plant doesn't display any anomalous properties, checking for unusual soil nitration levels shows promise as an identification method.\n\n\nSCP-936 is monoecious, and during flowering, specimens can be recognised by an unusually high male to female flower ratio - there are only several dozen female flowers, usually growing directly on older wood. Out of those, on average, less than six continue development, and it is rare for more than a single fruit to reach maturity.\n\n\nThe resulting fruit, classified SCP-936-1 is covered in a green cupule, and rapidly grows towards its ripe mass of app. 85\u00a0kg; SCP-936's foliage grows denser in order to cover for the energetic expenditure. Dissection has revealed the inside of SCP-936-1 contains a length of stem wrapping around a structure closely resembling a human body, designated SCP-936-2. Tissue samples obtained from SCP-936-1 physiologically resemble human tissue, possessing functionality in most aspects\n1\n, with the exception of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which contain a mass of brown-black seeds approximately 3cm in diameter.\n\n\nAs SCP-936-1 reaches maturity, the stem thickens considerably and the cupule wilts, eventually breaking, and causing SCP-936-2 to descend, hanging from the stem which in most cases wraps around its cervical region.\n\n\nThe appearance of SCP-936-2 produced by a single SCP-936 varies in size, visual appearance, and apparent gender with no discernible pattern.\n\n\nThe seeds within SCP-936-2 have a thick skin, and take approximately sixteen months to germinate. However if exposed to an acidic environment (pH < 2), germination occurs within \u2588\u2588 weeks.\n\n\nRecovery Log:\n SCP-936 was first discovered near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Finland, after reports of an unusually high reported suicide rate. Intelligence agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report has revealed this to be due to the statistics including a number of nude hanging victims being periodically discovered on trees in the nearby \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 forest, and the local cemetery, their identity being impossible to determine.\n\n\nSuspecting a cognitohazard, a perimeter was established around said yard under the premise of widespread bark beetle infection, and the site was placed under observation. During observation period, a new corpse was discovered despite security footage showing no violations of perimeter within assumed time of death. Autopsy revealed anomalies inconsistent with human anatomy; notably, seeds located in [REDACTED]. Agent F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 noted that all victims have been found hanging from a single species of tree, and a thorough examination has resulted in the procurement several samples of unripe SCP-936-1, leading to SCP-936 classification.\n\n\nMTF Xi-8 \"Spearhunters\" performed removal of all instances of SCP-936 within an surrounding area of 45\u00a0km sq.
