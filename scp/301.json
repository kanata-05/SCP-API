The bunker is to be staffed by no fewer than four level three security personnel at all times in order to secure the site and to maintain automated security measures. The perimeter of the bunker is to be lined with a chain-link fence with official warnings to deter intruders. Due to the remote location of SCP-301, additional security is not required.\n\n\nDuring experimentation, all research staff and equipment must maintain a minimum distance of at least three meters from the projected edge of SCP-301.\n\n\nIn the event of a containment breach, on-site personnel with the proper security clearance are authorized to implement emergency protocol C-301. All possible entrances to the bunker will automatically seal themselves and remain sealed indefinitely. Emergency protocol C-301 can only be countermanded by an O5 level command.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-301 is an anomalous region roughly three meters in diameter located in the middle of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 National Park. Whenever physical matter enters SCP-301, it temporarily disappears from existence. Following a delay of variable length, the matter that had entered SCP-301 will appear in another location. The duration of this time delay is variable, with a minimum length of \u2588\u2588 seconds and a maximum length of \u2588\u2588\u2588 minutes. The exact destination appears to be a random vertex point on a geodesic grid overlaying the Earth\u2019s surface. Each leg of this pattern is approximately 20\u00a0km long, resulting in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 possible destination points.\n\n\nThe prevailing model of SCP-301\u2019s workings is that teleportation occurs by accessing a coterminous interspatial region lying in a frame of reference attached to the center of the Earth. SCP-301 is invisible to the naked eye, but is detectable through other spectra. SCP-301 also passively emits electromagnetic energy. While not harmful to living organisms, it does interfere with improperly shielded electronics, and may explain why the native fauna does not venture near SCP-301.\n\n\nThrough experimentation, it has been discovered that SCP-301 can accommodate any kind of physical matter with certain size thresholds. The maximum size object that SCP-301 can accommodate can be no larger than SCP-301's three-meter diameter. There is also a minimum limit, though this is based on density rather than size. Currently, most gases and anything on a molecular level are not affected by SCP-301.\n\n\nFor further details, see the experiment logs.\n\n\nSCP-301 was discovered when there was a spike in disappearances of hikers and tourists in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 National Park, only for several of them to be rediscovered far from the site of their disappearance. The Foundation did not act until it received reports of one of the missing hikers being found in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, France, and another near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New South Wales, Australia.\n\n\nSubsequent interviews with these individuals produced inconsistent descriptions of the event, even after the use of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject 301-a-1 (retrieved in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, France) described the transfer as a floating sensation, with a mild forward impetus, accompanied by \u201cthe ringing of thousands of huge bells,\u201d and \u201csmell[ing] like wet dog and wood smoke,\u201d but having no other sensory components. However, Subject 301-a-2 (retrieved near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New South Wales, Australia) described it as a floating sensation with no sense of forward momentum, but including a \u201csalty taste,\u201d \u201cprickling feeling, like a foot going to sleep\u201d over the entire body, and being able to see \u201cstringy stuff\u201d surrounding the subject. Both subjects were administered a Class-A amnestic and released. See Document 301-0184678-a for full interview transcripts.\n\n\nWhile searching for the anomaly at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 National Park, Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 accidentally entered SCP-301. They disappeared for approximately \u2588\u2588 minutes until the signals from their locator beacons were reacquired \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 km and \u2588\u2588 km from their last recorded position respectively. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s body was recovered by a deep-water retrieval team 43\u00a0km SSW of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, India. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was recovered near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Angola, suffering from exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Foundation personnel were able to debrief Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 before he died. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 characterized the teleportation experience as being \u201cswept by a strong current\u201d that \u201cstank of shit.\u201d He also stated that he \u201csaw flames,\u201d and reported hearing \u201csand falling,\u201d and tasting \u201csugar, then dirt\u201d in a repeating cycle. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died two days later.\n\n\nBased on the agents\u2019 testimony, SCP-301 was found to be located on a regularly used hiking trail. The Foundation re-routed the hiking trail and built the current facility containing SCP-301.\n\n\nFrom information gathered from Subjects 301-a-1 and 301-a-2, and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it appears that the interspatial region accessed upon entering SCP-301 is experienced differently by each subject. This experience can manifest as a wide variety of sensory phenomena, including tactile, gustatory, olfactory, visual, aural, and kinetic sensations. Experimentation with Class D personnel to further study this aspect of SCP-301 is recommended. A selection of post-experiment analyses are collected in experiment log 301C.\n\n\nExperiment Log 301A\n\n\nUsing remote exploration in conjunction with on-going live experimentation, we have managed to map out much of the geodesic grid that SCP-301 teleportation follows. While this has resulted in the discovery of a large number of sites that require Foundation monitoring, many of these sites are in locations that make monitoring them a moot point (i.e. the dozens of egress points that open in the middle of the ocean).\n -Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nExperiment Log 301B\n\n\nAfter increasing the size of test materials, we've finally found that SCP-301 cannot accommodate items larger than itself. If a piece of matter that exceeds SCP-301's three-meter diameter is placed on SCP-301, there will be no effect. This has been noted for future containment protocols. There is also a minimum limit for what SCP-301 can accommodate. We've filled the containment room with easily detectable gases, as well as bombarding SCP-301 with radioactive particles. However, there is no evidence of any of these substances being successfully transported. The prevailing hypothesis is that SCP-301's minimum limit is based on density rather than size: solids and liquids are affected while gases and individual molecules are not.\n -Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nExperiment Log 301C\n\n\nEntries include subject identification number, egress point, and trip duration, followed by a listing of major sensory elements of the teleportation experience. Note that, for recovery purposes, all test subjects are equipped with a remote beacon harness that reports the subject's GPS co-ordinates to a Foundation satellite every 15 seconds from anywhere on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-05738\n\n\nEgress Point:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Iowa, United States\n\n\nDuration:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588 min\n\n\n\n\nKinetic:\n None\n\n\nVisual:\n None\n\n\nAuditory:\n None\n\n\nOlfactory:\n None\n\n\nTactile:\n Sensation of slimy tendrils moving over subject\u2019s body\n\n\nGustatory:\n None\n\n\nOther Notes:\n None\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-09983\n\n\nEgress Point:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, China\n\n\nDuration:\n \u2588\u2588 min\n\n\n\n\nKinetic:\n Floating sensation, as though suspended in liquid\n\n\nVisual:\n A red transparent liquid environment; subject reports seeing many red blood cell-like objects of approx. 3\u00a0cm to 50\u00a0cm in diameter.
