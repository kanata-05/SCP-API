For exact information regarding the Free Port, please access the \nattached external file\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5373 is FP-120, a \nFree Port-type Nexus\n currently existing within a pocket dimension parallel to the city of Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland, commonly referred to as \"Tysi\u0105clecie G\u00f3rne\" in Polish or \"Esterberg\" in Fae, acting as the hub of operations for GoI-120 (\"Triumvirat\u00e9\").\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the five entries into SCP-5373 as seen behind an abandoned factory building in Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this area is strictly separated from baseline reality, it is accessible through five main entries from baseline reality, one for each of its districts, connecting these two dimensions together leading into one of its districts. All of them are located throughout the entirety of Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland, only accessible to individuals knowing the passcodes necessary to pass through each door. Despite the location of these entries and / or said password having been noted to be changed about once a century by Esterberg's rulers, the Foundation had been successfully able to locate them following each shift through the usage of scanner technology and thaumaturgic rituals.\n\n\nDespite mostly acting as a free living space for numerous anomalous races, such as common Fae (\nHomo sapiens sidhe\n) or \nYeren\n (\nHomo sapiens noctis\n),\n3\n human society is neither a rarity nor an ostracized minority \u2014 in fact, the concept of racial discrimination within SCP-5373's boundaries is nearly nonexistent.\n\n\nSCP-5373's area covers around 59\u00a0km x 62\u00a0km of land (with 10% of that being taken by the actual city and 90% by the outside), with a centralized citizen-run council currently acting as the main ruling organ for the city. The entire city appears to run on a democratic-socialistic system, with the internal government being run by a body known as the \"Council of Three,\" a group comprised of one Fae, one human, and one Child of the Night, chosen from the city council once every four years in a democratic vote among the council, acting as a position similar to that of prime minister and president to the city.\n\n\nDue to SCP-5373's large area, it is inherently divided into five different districts, self-referred by its inhabitants as the Ruling District, the Living District, the Market District, the Sewer District, and the Port District.\n4\n Due to their complexity, refer to the Addenda for further information on each.\n\n\nDiscovery and Historical Context:\n SCP-5373 first came to the Foundation's attention even prior to \nSite-120's founding\n in 02/05/1916. During that time, intel from allied minor Groups of Interest revealed the existence of a Free Port within the boundaries of Cz\u0119stochowa. Following the founding of Provisional Site-120, SCP-5292's discovery (at the time known as PL-X0R38/0124) and the Fae attack that followed, Site-120 had been properly established to watch over the entirety of the Free Port for further action-planning.\n\n\nWith the passing of the 1923 \"Free Port Protection\" League of Nations Act, any plans of containment of SCP-5373 were immediately discontinued to not break the newly established international law. However, due to a loophole allowing for unarmed Foundation research exploration, further study conducted revealed that SCP-5373 is most likely more than 500 years old. Markings found within its oldest building \u2014 the Grand Temple located in the Ruling District \u2014 suggest that it was originally created as a refugee camp for anomalous during Medieval times during the attacks by the Catholic Church on the the Fae and Children of the Night populations during the Fourth Occult War, caused by an \nattempt at resurgence by the Fae Empire in the 13th century\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond one of the five entries into SCP-5373 as seen within an abandoned block of flats located within Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite SCP-5373's continued existence over the following eras, no major interactions with the human population in any capacity were noted \u2014 the only real exception of this rule was the hermetic sealing of the community during the Medieval-era Catholic Church-organized hunts for all that was anomalous, with a focus on individuals possessing thaumaturgic abilities and / or anomalous races. It's believed that this was mainly caused by the fact that almost no representatives of the hunting organizations possessed any knowledge regarding the usage of thaumaturgy; therefore a magical lock on portals leading to SCP-5373 were effectively permanent protection.\n\n\nDuring 1916, intel of its existence had been acquired by the Foundation \u2014 in the light of this information, further actions were almost immediately undertaken, in the end resulting in Site-120's establishment. For more information regarding these events, see file \u2014 \nSCP-5292\n.\n\n\nIn recent years, SCP-5373 has been acting as the main hub for all legal anomalous activity within a majority of central Europe. Being both a Foundation influence-free area as well as a society accepting of thaumaturgy, ontokinetic abilities, and other common anomalies, its population consists of more than 50\u00a0000 individuals both living within it on a daily basis as well as visiting. Noteworthy is the fact that despite being relatively up-to-date with modern technology, SCP-5373 has no infrastructure supporting cars,\n5\n and its architecture is heavily non-modern, with a currently untitled mixture of neoclassical, gothic, medieval, and modern architecture dominating within.\n\n\nDue to the relative ease of access to most individuals as well as the fact SCP-5373 is not forbidden to anyone, even Foundation personnel, FP-120 is seen as both a positive phenomenon and a wanted one due to its limitation of any non-controlled anomalous activity within the region \u2014 it's currently estimated that due to its existence, at least 100 anomalous events are prevented from being seen by the public on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f FILE UPDATE \u2014 01/05/1985 \u2014 Project Neverland Briefing \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the receival of intel suggesting that the next planned move of PoI-5936 is going to be an exploration mission into SCP-5373 for the purpose of a gathering of his military force consisting of anomalous races, \nSCP-5890-1 entities\n,\n6\n and \nSCP-5795-2 instances\n, which are able to remotely compromise Foundation databases. Due to this, as well as information suggesting this event will lead to a destruction of the second metaphysical thaumaturgic circle referred to by his followers as a \"\nSeal\n,\" in turn progressing his final, currently unknown, plan.\n\n\nTo counter this, a planned military operation focused only on the elimination of PoI-5936 and his followers has been launched on 17/05/1985 by the Foundation; logs and details of this operation are available below.\n\n\nOperation details in regards to specific SCP-5373 Districts are marked in the color of \nblue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5373-1: Specific SCP-5373 District Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entry point into the Sewer District as seen by MTF Theta-120 (portal-entry-enduced visual anomalies removed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sewer District:\n Being the smallest district within all of FP-120, the sewer district acts as the city's main garbage disposal system. Within its boundaries, numerous thaumaturgy-operated burners as well as other machinery to which all pipes and sewage lines are connected, are located. Despite this system however, a large portion of the underground sewer system is either heavily outdated due to its age and repurposed for usage by anomalous races finding the environment it creates to be beneficial. Such modifications range from mass grave / crypt areas,\n7\n tunnel underground black markets, and housing areas for the previously mentioned races to connections to local cave areas.\n\n\nEntry into the Sewer District is available directly through a loose portal located within Cz\u0119stochowa's sewers, through which the Foundation leads almost all exploration missions into SCP-5373 due to the relative secrecy that location offers. However, due to the loose dimensional boundary enforcement this way of dimensional separation creates, numerous minor anomalous behaviors have been noted to affect the non-SCP-5373 part of the gateway, with the most present one being the feeling of a \npowerful presence within the Cz\u0119stochowian sewers\n. However, as none of these effects is severe enough to affect anything else than the extremely small space that is the connection between Cz\u0119stochowa and SCP-5373, no action against them was declared necessary.\n\n\nThe Sewer District is to act as the starting point to the PoI-5936 Capture Mission, further referred to as \"Project Neverland.\" There, a total of five MTF units are to be dispatched as the beginning to this operation, with their main goal being heading towards the Ruling District, where a Foundation-contacted inside agent is planned to provide more intel information to the squads regarding Nowak's whereabouts; after this occurs, the main focus is on locating the area he resides in and eliminating him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-1\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-1\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 17/05/1985\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Mobile Task Force Theta-120 (\"Tyrfing Black\")\n8\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-5373, Sewer District\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Asheworth\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Dr. Rivera, Cptn.

With a total of five MTF units standing within the murk waters of the location, all of them silently nod to each other and start to walk forward to the end of the tunnel, from which a light is coming.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n To make sure \u2014 we're going with Alpha-2 to Ruling, right?\n\n\nOne of the men present within the room turns back to Asheworth, with the thaumaturge snapping his fingers, resulting in a dim light above everyone's head lighting up.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n Yes. We split up here and re-join near the stairs to the Grand Temple. Everyone else asserts the situation.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1 pauses for a second.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n If you see or hear anything weird, report through the radio.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Roger.\n\n\nThe four other teams quickly head for the exit, with the three remaining individuals stay for a moment.\n\n\nRivera:\n Stop.\n\n\nAsheworth turns back to look at Rivera.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Hm?\n\n\nRivera:\n We should go right.\n\n\nCornwell:\n The instructions we were given clearly state we should go left. There we'll meet up with Nine and\u2014\n\n\nRivera:\n Left will get us there quicker.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Wh\u2026 how do you know this?\n\n\nRivera:\n I don't know, I just\u2026\n\n\nRivera touches her forehead, starting to gently massage it.\n\n\nRivera:\n I just \nknow.\n\n\nShe pauses for a second.\n\n\nRivera:\n Look, ever since I've awoken reality-bending within me during our time in 5795, things have been\u2026 different, alright? I\u2026 I don't fully understand, but\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n It's okay.\n\n\nAll pause for a moment.\n\n\nCornwell:\n A mage and a reality bender leading a Site dealing with mages and reality benders. Heh.\n\n\nCornwell chuckles nervously.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<sigh>\n Not the time.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Sorry.\n\n\nRivera:\n Let's just go.\n\n\nAs Rivera starts to walk left, the team follows. Shortly after, the camera reveals a long corridor, populated with numerous market stands, lanterns hanging from the ceiling, and doors and windows leading into living spaces near them, all located within the sewer despite its everpresent wetness. At the end of the tunnel, there is light.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Ew.\n\n\nComing close to the local market stands, a widely smiling SCP-1000 instance appears from behind one of them. The entity approaches the team with a small bag filled with unidentified items in its hands.\n\n\nThe entity:\n \n<in a thick accent>:\n Hello there, fellow humans. \n<chuckle>\n Would you possibly like to\u2014\n\n\nCornwell:\n \n<Backing off a little>:\n Oh Jesus, I\u2014 \n<Cornwell points his gun at the entity>\n S-stay back!\n\n\nThe entity's expression changes to shock. Shortly, after it quickly runs away.\n\n\nRivera:\n What the fuck, Jeremy?\n\n\nCornwell:\n What?\n\n\nRivera:\n What \"what?\" You exactly know what. Why the fuck did you do that?\n\n\nCornwell:\n Do what?\n\n\nRivera:\n Do \nthat\n to that goddamned 1000. He didn't even\u2014\n\n\nCornwell:\n Not my fault I naturally feel afraid of th\u2014\n\n\nRivera scoffs.\n\n\nRivera:\n Are you even listening to what\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Shut up.\n\n\nBoth stop fighting, turning their heads towards Asheworth.\n\n\nCornwell:\n If this is your attempt at\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I said, shut up.\n\n\nRivera:\n What's going on?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n He is somewhere here.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Huh?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I can sense him.\n\n\nRivera:\n Are you sure you're fine? Last time you were like this you were obss\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Yes, I'm fine. I've \ngiven up on my past a long time ago\n.\n\n\nAsheworth pauses for a second.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n All I care about now is making sure this piece of shit doesn't hurt anyone else.\n\n\nThe feed is turned off as the team enters out of the sewers.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA section of one of the smaller temples located within the Ruling District.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ruling District:\n Despite its extreme size, the Ruling District doesn't house as many buildings as it would be expected to \u2014 in fact, most of its area is covered by large administrative buildings, the main parliament housing the city council and the Council of Three, houses of individuals bearing rule over the city, and its religious buildings \u2014 with the oldest and the largest of them being the Grand Temple, which acts as the main housing unit for SCP-5373's thaumaturgic and theological activities. Due to the buildings it houses, most of the Ruling District's area is severely renovated above any other area within the city.\n\n\nBeing the oldest part of the city as suggested by prior scans, the Ruling District possesses by far the highest rankings of Akiva radiation out of the entire city, with the focus point of this radiation being the Grand Temple, which is also the oldest building within the entire city. It's theorized that this is mainly caused by the sheer amount of religious activity it houses every day due to its size \u2014 however, this doesn't explain why \nenergy amounts similar to those excreted by dietic entities are mainly focused on underground parts of the facility\n.\n\n\nDue to the relatively rich population of the Ruling District, a relatively large portion of its buildings are directly owned by large \nGroups of Interest\n, with the main players within this area being \nMarshall, Carter & Darke\n, which possesses an official auctionhouse within the district and the \nGlobal Occult Coalition\n with its own office and a patrolling force. Additionally, numerous cults and smaller religious organizations such as the \nChurch of the Broken God\n, the \nSerpent's Hand\n, with a direct portal to the \nWanderers' Library\n in one of its buildings, singular believers of \nSarkicism\n, and a small but formidable cult of individuals worshiping an unknown deity known as \"Father\" have been found within the numerous minor chapels and religious buildings the Ruling District offers.\n\n\nFollowing their escape from the Sewer District, Project Neverland exploration teams are to head into the direction of the Grand Temple, where they are to meet the Foundation's inside agents, from whom they are to collect information regarding Nowak's whereabouts (this information wasn't forwarded prior due to the chance of compromisation this offer would hold for the agents). After this exchange is done, the team is to act accordingly to the information provided with the goal of capturing PoI-5936 in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-2\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-2\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe feed reconnects, revealing the prior exploration team walking up pearl-white stairs leading to a large temple building located atop it. On the cover of the large opened stone doors leading to the building's interiors, numerous highly detailed pictographs of humanoid entities being worshiped can be seen, covering almost all of the doors' area. Within the walls around them, tall pillars as well as detailed decorations can be seen, with a large, curvy-lettered sign sitting atop the entry.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \"Show repentance, mortals, for you are entering the house of gods.\" That's\u2026 one cheesy way to put it.\n\n\nCornwell:\n What?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<pointing towards the sign:>\n That's what it says. In Fae, I mean.\n\n\nAsheworth chuckles nervously, proceeding to walk up faster; Rivera and Cornwell quickly catch up, a moment later standing near the entry to the building. From within, a silent whistle can be heard, immediately alarming Rivera.\n\n\nRivera:\n That's our sign. Let's go.\n\n\nThe team enters into the building through the large doors, revealing a gigantic hall with a ceiling held up by numerous pillars scattered throughout the room. Along its walls, numerous large mosaics with Fae descriptions can be seen, all showing a large humanoid entity \u2014 however, the details of them remain mostly unknown due to the distance between the team and the pictures.\n\n\nIn the background, a large altar with an extremely large mosaic, covering almost all of the wall, can be seen. The painting showcases a large field among which numerous entities stand. Among them, a \nlarge stag\n, a \nlarge, pale humanoid\n, a man carrying a sword of pure light, a Child of the Night walking with a cane in his hand, \nlarge tree\n, and a mass of flesh with eyes can be seen located on its left, with the destroyed images of \ntwo Fae wearing crowns\n, crowned humanoid painted crimson, a mass of gears and metal, as well as a large serpent encompassing all of these entities on the right. In the center, a featureless humanoid entity is standing, visibly above all others; the material previously used to make it up seems to be destroyed, purposefully leaving only its silhouette visible. Above it, red tendril-like appendages coming from the top of the mosaic can be seen.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Woah.\n\n\nAs the entire team looks around in disbelief, two members of other dispatched MTFs approach them from their right, showing them to come closer. Doing so, Theta-120 slowly uncovers the area within which the wall mosaics are seen.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n You good?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Yes. All's fine. The rest?\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n Omega, Beta, and Gamma are guarding the outsides. We really don't want anyone to know we're here for the info.\n\n\nCornwell:\n But, uh, we didn't see them anywhere?\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n That just means they're doing their job.\n\n\nAll pause for a second.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n \n<pointing towards the rest of the team located near the altar:>\n Our correspondent said they'll only accept us to pass on the info, meaning you'll have to wait here. Won't take longer than a couple of minutes.\n\n\nThe man joins the rest of his team near the altar, near which a hooded entity can be seen. They start to engage in a silent conversation.\n\n\nAs neither of Theta-120 members have anything else to do, Asheworth and Rivera start to investigate the wall mosaics present near them \u2014 Cornwell appears to not be interested with them, as he sits down in one of the wall cavities and starts to clear his gun.\n\n\nRivera:\n And what on earth are those?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Well, they are murals, I suppose.\n\n\nRivera rolls her eyes and sighs.\n\n\nRivera:\n No shit.\n\n\nThe duo comes closer, revealing the entire wall is separated into 5 identically-sized panels, located within shallow cavities and with small descriptions in Fae located beneath them.\n\n\nAsheworth turns back, looking at the other side of the wall \u2014 there, an identical mirroring of the location can be seen.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \"I. The left-behind kingdom.\"\n\n\nHe looks up, showing a mural showcasing a large, blue, featureless humanoid entity located in the center of the image, sitting atop a throne. Around it, numerous smaller blue humanoids can be seen, kneeling near it. In the background, a large, luminous, red mass with tentacle-like appendages can be seen. It doesn't touch any of the other entities present in the painting.\n\n\nRivera:\n \n<pointing at the red mass:>\n Is that\u2026 Yaldabaoth?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n It's too transparent and\u2026 ghostly, I think? Never seen any representation of it before.\n\n\nThe two slowly move to the left, showing the next panel.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \"II. The deal.\"\n\n\nThe second panel showcases the tall blue humanoid, kneeling under the red mass. Within the humanoid's hands, numerous smaller blue humanoids can be seen, each being presented to the red entity. From one of the apendeges of the red entity, unidentified items can be seen; behind it, a number of small red humanoids equivalent to that of the offered blue ones are present.\n\n\nRivera:\n So someone\u2026 dealt with something, in exchange for people, getting what in return, exactly?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Technology, I imagine. Or at least some material wealth. No idea.\n\n\nShrugging, he proceeds to the next image, which showcases two visibly divided parts \u2014 the top one, within which the red mass with numerous parts of it covered in holes, numerous unidentified items from the last panel, as well as a number of red humanoids identical to the one of the blue ones from panel one can be seen. Separated from the bottom panel with a black line, within the down portion, the tall blue humanoid can be seen, in visible stress, with parts of its body missing.

Ended in the blue one running away from whatever its home was.\n\n\nRivera:\n Why though?\n\n\nAsheworth points at the red humanoids.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n The red one probably overpowered the blue one by sheer numbers. Too many deals to do anyone good, I guess.\n\n\nProceeding to the fourth panel, the team reveals an open plain, with the tall humanoid present in its center \u2014 from its hands, plants and two small entities looking similar to humans can be seen emerging. Within the blue entity's eyes, a slight red light can be seen.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \"IV. The creation of life.\" Eugh. Seen and heard too many world-creation stories. Sick of them.\n\n\nRivera:\n Agreed.\n\n\nThe fifth mural showcases five smaller circles located around the entity \u2014 the tall humanoid has parts of its body missing, with one of its eyes burning with a red light, sand its visibly connected to the five circles, with parts of its body present within them. One of these circles is slightly damaged.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \"V. Imprisonment..\"\n\n\nRivera:\n So it\u2026 put itself in a prison? Why?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n The red one somehow penetrated the barrier and got to it. Wanted to lock itself with red so it won't destroy everything again, I suppose.\n\n\nRivera:\n \n<proceeding after a short pause:>\n What does all of this mean?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<rolling his eyes and chuckling nervously:>\n Nothing. Weird religious bullshit, I guess. Wouldn't give my head to the imagination of a weird sculpturer from hundreds of years ago.\n\n\nRivera:\n I guess you're right.\n\n\nAs they both stop talking, suddenly, all three members of Alpha-2 can be seen rushing towards them, visibly stressed. The hooded entity is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n \n<sigh>\n It's becoming a goddamned catchphrase during this entire case, isn't it?\n\n\nRivera:\n What's going on?\n\n\nAlpha-2-1 speeds up his walk, quickly showing near the exist.\n\n\nAlpha-2-1:\n We're already too late.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lake directly visible from the Port District.

Due to boats becoming more of an obsolete movement method as well as the closing of all river-based entries into SCP-5373 within the couple last centuries, the actual port is now more of a decoration / tourist attraction rather than a functioning trade center; though boats still roam the waters of the foggy lake, Lake Arlande, connected to the harbor, trade through this method is almost nonexistent.\n\n\nDespite being mostly populated by large warehouses as well as markets from the Market District, numerous other buildings, including houses, still do exist within the Port District's area \u2014 the biggest landmark being the gigantic lighthouse located on the shores of Lake Arlande. The building, being powered by a thaumaturgic flame, permanently exhorts a large pillar of light, regularly patrolling the harbor. Despite no real need for this, a local legend attributing the flame's wealth to the wealth of the city exists; no correlation has ever been noted, but Esterbergians keep the flame permanently alive as a visible tradition.\n\n\nAfter the information exchange within the Ruling District will become successful, Project Neverland personnel are to head within the location within which PoI-5936 is planned to locate himself, in the process adhering to as many safety rules as possible \u2014 not being detected by the target prior to engagement is top priority. During the relocation process, all individuals involved are to keep an eye out for any irregularities within SCP-5373's terrain, with structures such as thaumaturgic glyphs, runes, totems or any other items possibly used for the completion of a ritual being items they are to look for the most. All such irregularities are to be immediately destroyed with specific instructions being given out by local mission thaumaturges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-3\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-3\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nEntering into the large opening from which the port can be seen, the entire team can be seen quickly moving up the road leading uphill towards the Living District. Despite the normal traffic, the location would offer, almost no one can be seen around them.

The priest told me something within everyone called them to the market. Whatever the fuck that means.\n\n\nAsheworth frowns, starting to run. Rivera quickly catches up, visibly panting and tired.\n\n\nRivera:\n D-do you\u2026 know anything\u2026 about what that\u2026 means?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I\u2026 yes, I do. There's a legend he used to tell us when new people joined.\n\n\nRivera:\n Joined what?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<rolling his eyes:>\n The cult, Rivera. It's not that hard to think out.\n\n\nAsheworth cracks his fingers, with the runes on his gloves starting to dimly lit themselves up.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n He used to tell us we are, on a fundamental level, the same \u2014 that there is \nsomething\n within us that made us the same.\n\n\nRivera:\n The fuck does that\u2026 m-mean?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I don't know. I'm just afraid he used whatever that is to call all of them there.\n\n\nThe team approaches a thin alleyway, blocked by numerous crates and chests, blocking entry. On them, a large red rune can be seen.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck, fuck!\n\n\nAsheworth backs off, snapping his fingers and whistling quietly. The crates suddenly engulf themselves in flame as the area around the thaumaturge's eyes starts to slightly wither.\n\n\nRivera:\n I\u2026 What\u2014?\n\n\nAsheworth:\n It meant sacrifice. He's ready to open another one of his seals. Here, now\u2026\n\n\nRivera:\n Oh Jesus.\n\n\nThe two run out of the alleyway, finding a way around it \u2014 this time, they're visibly closer to the hill housing the Market District than before.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \u2026and he's ready to sacrifice the entire city to do it.\n\n\nAsheworth suddenly stops. As he does so, Cornwell catches up to them, catching his breath.\n\n\nCornwell:\n And what the fuck are you doing?!\n\n\nAsheworth starts to kneel, closing his eyes, and touching the ground.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Run. Get his pets and mages before they can finish the ritual. I'll catch up.\n\n\nRivera:\n What?! Why?!\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<quietly;>\n I'll put a failsafe up for when you inevitably fail.\n\n\nCornwell:\n I\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I said \u2014 go!\n\n\nThe two start to run, heading up the hill. Doing so, they reveal a large opening near the buildings, from which the Great Market can be seen overlapping with the living district down below \u2014 there, an extreme amount of individuals, both anomalous race-wise and nonanomalous, can be seen. Due to the distance however, their details cannot be made out. From within the mass, a loud speech can be heard \u2014 similarly, no details can be heard.\n\n\nRivera:\n Shit, shit, shit!\n\n\nRivera picks up her communication device, quickly putting it to her ear.\n\n\nRivera:\n Command?\n\n\nNo response is given.\n\n\nRivera:\n Command?! Do you copy?\n\n\nShe gently slaps the device a couple times, to no result.\n\n\nRivera:\n Alpha-2?! Beta?! Where the fuck is any\u2014\n\n\nCornwell approaches her, touching her shoulder. He slowly points towards the sky above the Great Market.\n\n\nCornwell:\n L-look.\n\n\nSaid sky rapidly changes into a large circle, quickly expanding with each second \u2014 with this expansion, numerous other details, such as thaumaturgic details within it can be found.\n\n\nRivera:\n Oh no. No no no no no.\n\n\nRivera backs off a little, in result falling to her knees. Standing up, she looks backwards.\n\n\nRivera:\n Oh Jesus.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Wh\u2014 oh.\n\n\nCornwell looks backwards, from which a large wall made out of flame can be seen expanding around the entire Living and Market District from where Asheworth should be located. The barrier is around 4 meters tall and 2 meters thick, with no signs of spreading beyond its area being seen.\n\n\nCornwell:\n Has he lost his mind?!\n\n\nRivera:\n He\u2026 he didn't bluff. Jesus Christ.\n\n\nBoth pause for a second, catching their breath.\n\n\nRivera:\n So\u2026 what the hell do we do?\n\n\nCornwell:\n We can't go back, or that psycho will burn us to death with his insane barrier\u2026\n\n\nRivera:\n \u2026but if we go forward, another one will murder us, this time intentionally.\n\n\nRivera sighs.\n\n\nRivera:\n Let's end this here, once and for all.\n\n\nShe steps forward, reading her gun.\n\n\nRivera:\n For the better of everyone.\n\n\nAs they charge down into the crowd of people located in the market, the feed suddenly disconnects as the shouting from the area gets louder.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA part of the Living District as photographed by off-duty Site-120 personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Living District:\n Being the main center of the entire populace of SCP-5373, the Living District is the largest area within all of FP-120. Despite being mostly filled with houses and buildings built with similar purposes, the district possesses numerous buildings commonly found within urban areas, such as shops, restaurants, and small businesses. Due to this as well as the large clientele the area offers, numerous smaller Groups of Interest were noted to open their locals within, with the most active players being \nWilson's Wildlife Solutions\n with an active shelter for \nstray animals\n titled \"Wilson's Esterberg Center\" and \nAmbrose Restaurants\n, with numerous smaller sub-instances located within. \nSurprisingly, Ambrose does not possess any subinstances outside of the Living District \u2014 the reasons for this remain unknown\n.\n\n\nDespite being an active nexus for anomalous inhabitants, it's been noted that numerous portals appear to lead out of parts of the area, connecting areas inhabited by anomalous races spread across Poland to this area; examples of such include \nSCP-1000 habitats within the Podlasian Voivodeship\n, Fae habitats in the Wielkopolska areas, and Finfolk housings near the Baltic Sea.\n\n\nThough initially entirely separate, due to the ever-increasing amount of residents requiring vital products on a daily basis, the Living District and the Market District partially overlap, resulting in a large area of the Great Market existing partially within the latter.\n\n\nDuring the search for PoI-5936 following the inquiry of vital information regarding his whereabouts, Project Neverland personnel are to be especially worried about potential threats coming from within SCP-5373 inhabitants \u2014 as seen from prior interactions, Damien Nowak possesses an inherent ability to turn normally neutral parties against the Foundation; with FP-120 possessing numerous potentially dangerous races as well as the Living District's large amount of inhabitants, special caution is to be shown during the operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-4\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-4\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe feed reconnects, revealing Rivera and Cornwell standing in a large, densly-packed crowd standing around a large open area, filled to the brim with a mix of humans, Children of the Night, Fae, and other anomalous races. All of them are focused on a large platform located in the center of this market, upon which approximately 20 individuals can be seen. One of them, identifiable as PoI-5936, is visibly the center of the attention.\n\n\nRivera, holding a gun in her hand, looks around the entire area, scouting around its perimeter. Though initially not noticing anything, she quickly notices four Project Neverland MTF squads standing within entry alleyways into the market \u2014 they establish eye contact with her, nodding in the process. Just as she is about to turn her focus back at the man standing atop the platform, for a moment, she notices a man wearing a red tuxedo and a hat standing near the edge of her vision, quickly disappearing into the crowd around him. She disregards it as an illusion and focuses on Nowak.\n\n\nNowak:\n \u2014ever. For years, all they have done is cause suffering towards everyone they deem \"anomalous.\" Am I wrong?\n\n\nThe crowd cheers. Above them in the sky, a large, red, thaumaturgic circle can be seen growing, with dim, red light appearing near the eyes of individuals standing in the crowd. They do not notice it.\n\n\nNowak:\n And even after all of this, do you still really believe they \nwon't\n double down? They rooted your natural habitats out, they burned your forests, and they murdered your families \u2014 do you genuinely think they won't destroy this heaven you've built yourself here, after all they've done?\n\n\nNowak turns around, kneeling on the ground with one knee and starting to draw a circle around himself using chalk. Similarly, the men around him start to do the same.\n\n\nAs Rivera attempts to walk closer to Cornwell, her messaging device suddenly starts to buzz aggressively.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n \n<inaudible>\n \u2014let him finish.

Scream, my friends, for we will be free!\n\n\nThe crowd screams with applause, and Nowak bows at the scene. With each increase in the sound of the roar, the circle above the crowd grows, encompassing almost the entire sky around the Living District.\n\n\nUnknown voice:\n New orders. Engage with PoI-5936 under any circumstance, even through force. Do not let the ritual be finished, even if you have to murder these people in return.\n\n\nRivera:\n W-What?\n\n\nUnknown voice:\n Direct order from O5-9.\n\n\nRivera:\n What does that mean?\n\n\nNo response is given.\n\n\nRivera:\n What does that mean?!\n\n\nResponse Channel:\n I'm sorry, friends.\n\n\nThe response channel turns off, showing only static. As red, luminescent light starts glowing from each of the members of the crowd into the circle, all MTF units surrounding the market walk down into the crowd.\n\n\nThe circle abruptly explodes, releasing red mist everywhere in sight \u2014 due to this, Rivera's vision is visibly obstructed. From her left, screams begin to be heard as a fire starts to take over the buildings around her. She glances at the stage, only to see Nowak quickly running away into the block surrounding the location around the area.\n\n\nAs the crowd starts to run away from the direction from which the MTF units engaged, Cornwell gets pushed into the direction it's walking in. Suddenly, Asheworth runs into Rivera from the back, grabbing her by the shoulders.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n What\u2026 the.. fuck is going on?!\n\n\nRivera:\n I\u2026 I don't\u2026 I don't\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Grab a hold of yourself, for fuck's sake!

As the fog falls down upon the city, more and more screams can be heard.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n We end this, here and now.\n\n\nAsheworth grabs Rivera by her hand and takes her into the flaming building within which Nowak is located.

Despite the fact that almost the entire district is populated by this area, smaller agglomerations of housing units still exist, though noticeably smaller. Due to the overlap between both areas, with each year of their existence, both have been noted to lose their distinct borders more and more, with each year fusing into each other.\n\n\nShould any previously unaccounted for events disrupt Project Neverland, personnel are to be reminded that the Market District is an area within which they can take cover \u2014 due to the almost nonexistent authority patrols and the existence of an easy connection to the Sewer District, the possibility of seeking refuge within this area has been noted to be extremely easy. Paired with the fact that personnel trained with opening dimensional rifts will find such activity greatly easier due to the relative dimensional instability the region offers, the area can act as a perfect failsafe in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-5\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05373-5\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRivera is standing in the living room of a burning building, breathing quickly.

His right arm is bleeding, and he is breathing heavily. Rivera's eyes are burning with a bright, purple light, with the woman being visibly tired. Her right hand is holding a pistol, pointed at Nowak, who is holding his knee in an expression of pain. From within the pistol, smoke is coming out.\n\n\nRivera:\n Explain yourself.\n\n\nNowak:\n W-What?\n\n\nRivera:\n During that speech, I heard some reason within your voice.

You take everything from everyone. I will take it back for them, even if I had to do it through awakening gods. That's what Heaven is, at its core. I\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Liar!\n\n\nNowak:\n Oh, can you just shut up?

Just tell me what on earth happened between you, or I fucking swear to god I will end this here and now!\n\n\nShe gasps violently, hissing in an expression of pain.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Years ago, I was a part of his cult. I believed his cause, blinded by his words like an utter idiot\u2026\n\n\nAsheworth pauses.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n I rose through the ranks quickly and with relative ease, eventually ending up as one of the leaders of it, even finding love in one of my friends. Natalie. Her name was Natalie.\n\n\nAsheworth sighs, scratching his eye in the process.\n\n\nAsheworth:\n Then, one night, he discovered \nsomething\n. Something so big we needed to execute the ritual to do it immediately. Ignoring everything else.\n\n\nNowak:\n That night, I found Father. He spoke to me, telling me to contact him in any way possible. He told me he'll help us. And so I did. I initiated a portal through which we could speak normally. And then he and his little lover tried to murder me, betraying everything we\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n What?! You dare to tell me \nI\n attacked you?!

You and her wanted to kill everyone there, trying to end everything we worked so hard to accomplish, I\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth:\n No!\n\n\nWith two moves of his hands, Asheworth breaks from the bubble, materializing a flame within his hand. He rushed to Nowak, but is immediately stopped by another invisible wall. Rivera screams, trying to hold him back.\n\n\nRivera:\n No! Stop! I\u2014\n\n\nAsheworth screams, charging at the other man, snapping his fingers. The flame around his fingers moves quickly, attempting to locate Nowak, which violently dashes backward in an attempt to dodge the attack.\n\n\nDoing so, the floor beneath him collapses, revealing a large, orange circle, which entirely consumes Nowak. He grins angrily, and looks at Asheworth.\n\n\nNowak:\n Two seals down, three to go.\n\n\nAs the portal closes, Rivera falls to the ground, unable to sustain Asheworth's prison any longer.
