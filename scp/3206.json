Individuals confirmed to be affected by SCP-3206 must undergo the necessary surgical procedures under the auspices of both a physician and veterinary doctor, followed by amnesticization and release. A maximum of 50 affected individuals may be allowed to persist under SCP-3206 for no more than three months at a time for the purpose of behavioural study.\n\n\nAll telephone calls involving the number +254 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 must be documented and individuals involved in these calls detained for a minimum of five hours. Should SCP-3206 manifest, said persons must be subject to the aforementioned containment procedures.\n\n\nPersons of Interest-3206-1 through -8 must be under video and phone surveillance. Should anomalous activity be observed, PoIs are to be contained at Site-52.\n\n\nUPDATE (12.04.2013): PoI-3206-3 is currently uncontained (see Call Transcript BN0358). All other PoIs must be held in standard humanoid containment at Site-52 until further notice. Direct interaction with SCP-3206-A is tentatively forbidden.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3206 is a phenomenon whereby humans develop a fully functioning vomeronasal organ\n1\n (VNO) anatomically and genetically identical to that of \nEquus ferus caballus\n (horse). This is accompanied by associated behaviour typical of ungulates and felids possessing a VNO, particularly the flehmen response\n2\n.\n\n\nApproximately 76% of affected individuals seek medical attention or express concern regarding the effects of SCP-3206, reflecting a shrinking majority since the commencement of containment procedures. In a minority of cases, individuals compulsively or opportunistically utilise SCP-3206 in a variety of ways, commonly pursuing persons of interest and congregating in poorly sanitised public restrooms.\n\n\nThe vast majority of confirmed cases of SCP-3206 to date have occurred in rural areas in Turkana County, Kenya. SCP-3206 was first recorded in November 2005.\n\n\nAddendum 3206-01:\n The manifestation of SCP-3206 is associated with calling or accepting a call from the telephone number +254 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. In all cases, one of several entities (collectively designated SCP-3206-A) can be heard, although comprehension is hampered by the occasional interruption of equine vocalisations of uncertain origin. SCP-3206-A attempts to sell VNOs to the other party, making poor use of tactics commonly associated with fraudulent telemarketing. If the other party declines the offer, the call terminates without further incident.\n\n\nShould the offer be accepted, the entity ceases vocalisation and communication is no longer possible. Instead, a consistent rhythm of heavy thuds, accompanied irregularly by muffled groans, are heard. The frequency and intensity of these sounds increases gradually over time, terminating in a wet slapping noise and vocalisations described as reminiscent of a foal in distress. At this point, the call ends. SCP-3206 manifests in individuals exposed to the call between three and four hours after the connection is terminated.\n\n\nAttempts to trace the call are consistently met with failure.\n\n\nAddendum 3206-05:\n Through the use of voice recognition software, a significant match has been identified between SCP-3206-A and eight individuals (designated PoI-3206-1 through -8). All persons are currently alive and are pastoralists in the Turkana region, although no other relation between them has been identified. No evidence of involvement in SCP-3206 has been found.\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Document:\u00a0SCP-3206\u00a0Call\u00a0Transcript\u00a0BN0358\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3206 Transcript BN0358\n\n\nForeword:\n The call was initiated by Operative H. Ouma with the purpose of confronting an instance of SCP-3206-A regarding its identity.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nOuma:\n Hello? Please identify yourself.\n\n\n3206-A:\n Hi, there. It\u2019s good that you gave me a call \n(nickering is audible)\n. We\u2019ve been trying to contact you by mail, email \u2013 even knocked on your bedroom door. Are you ready to take up our limited, once-in-a-lifetime offer? We offer prime VNOs for just zero bob\n3\n.\n\n\nOuma:\n Is this Rachel Githuru\n4\n?\n\n\n3206-A is unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds, at which point a notably confused and somewhat distressed male voice begins vocalising.\n\n\n3206-A1:\n Hi\u2014hi, there. It\u2019s good that you gave me a call. We\u2019ve been trying to contact you by mail, email \u2013 even knocked on your bedroom door. Can\u2014are you ready to take up our limited, once-in-a-lifetime offer? We offer prime VNOs for just zero bob.\n\n\nOuma:\n Who are you? Where is Rachel Githuru?\n\n\n3206-A1:\n The offer. It\u2019s great \n(high-pitched whinnying is audible)\n. All the VNOs you could wish for \u2013 a lifetime\u2019s supply, free of charge. What do you say, ma\u2019am?\n\n\nOuma:\n Where is Rachel Githuru?\n\n\n3206-A1:\n Oh, my colleague? She\u2014she\u2019s gone. Didn\u2019t do her job right, it\u2019s a sh\u2014shame. Boss had to dismiss her. But I assure you, I\u2019m a more than adequate replacement. Please. How about that deal? How many VNOs should I put you down for? I\u2014I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\n\nOuma:\n Sorry, but I don\u2019t want any VNOs. Not unless you are willing to answer my questions.\n\n\nHigh-pitched whinnying is audible, after which the same, unidentified voice proceeds to whisper.\n\n\n3206-A1:\n Ok, ok. My n\u2014name is John Ochieng. I\u2014I don\u2019t know where I am. I just woke up sitting at this table with this phone. There\u2019s\u2014was a thing here, telling me to\u2014to talk to you. To say these things. B\u2014but it\u2019s\u2026 I think it\u2019s gone now.\n\n\nOuma:\n Ok, John. Describe your surroundings. Maybe there is something that could indicate where you are.\n\n\n3206-A1:\n It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s so dark. I don\u2019t know\u2014I think I\u2019m inside a big building. I\u2019m covered in something\u2026 it\u2019s so dry. I\u2014I think this is hay. There\u2019s just hay everywhere. Wait\u2014why is it so sticky?\n\n\nOuma:\n Can you remember how you got to this place, John?\n\n\n3206-A1:\n No. I remember\u2026 I think I fell asleep on my sofa and then I woke up\u2026 here. My wife and ch\u2014children, are they ok? Please, make sure they\u2019re ok.\n\n\nOuma:\n Yes, we\u2014where does your family live? We can bring them to a safe\u2014\n\n\n3206-A1:\n Listen. Please\u2026 accept the offer. The thing \u2013 it\u2019s back. Just please, t\u2014take it. I don\u2019t want it to\u2014please.\n\n\nOuma:\n Try and move away from the entity, stay as far away from it as you can.\n\n\n3206-A1:\n P\u2014please, ma\u2019am. Have a VNO on the house. H\u2014help this starving little company stay above water. My\u2026 my kids, they are so lovely. I don\u2019t want them to\u2026 lose their way. Just this once, on the house.\n\n\nOuma:\n I\u2014ok, John. I accept your offer.\n\n\n3206-A1:\n Oh, oh thank you \n(low-pitched whinnying is audible)\n. Thank you for your p-purchase, and be sure to pass our number on to your\u2026 to your friends and family.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Operative Ouma was subject to SCP-3206 four hours after termination of the call. No other incidents related to the call have been observed. No match has been found between the unidentified iteration of SCP-3206-A (sub-designated SCP-3206-A1) and living individuals. Missing persons reports in Turkana County are currently under investigation for correlation with SCP-3206-A1.\n\n\nSurveillance of PoI-3206-3 was spontaneously disrupted during the call. Recovery of PoI-3206-3 is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3206-11:\n Since the initial manifestation of SCP-3206-A1, its appearance has been recorded in a further 26 calls. A lack of consistency in the behaviour of SCP-3206-A1 in these cases casts some doubt on the authenticity of information garnered from the entity through Call BN0358.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
