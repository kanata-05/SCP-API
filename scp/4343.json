Any damage to the building that constrains SCP-4343 must be prevented at all costs, with the exception of \nCODENAME PARADISE LOST\n being executed.\n\n\nTo minimize public acknowledgement of Black Events, field personnel are to follow the following Containment Procedures.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Black\u00a0Events\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nBlack Event 1999&2004:\n Standard monitoring on said individuals is to be maintained, as they must undergo a full body check on a yearly basis under the name of a Social Care Program.\n\n\nBlack Event 2002:\n The Foundation is to maintain several antiphase generators in Mekka, Saudi Arabia, in order to cancel the anomalous audio broadcasted in the region.\n\n\nBlack Event 2007:\n 5 active Scranton Reality Anchors are to remain hidden in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, China for the purpose of stabilizing or neutralizing most reality disorders and reality failures resulting from the event. To date, 14 of 17 Persons of Interest are now in containment, and the Foundation is still in search of the remaining.\n\n\nBlack Event 2010:\n Research into a way to track, observe, identify or capture the released entities is ongoing. Foundation staff is suggested to report immediately should they encounter such an entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-site researchers and guards reside in a camp the Foundation successfully established in SCP-4343-A. All on-site personnel must score at least 85 on the Foundation Loyalty Test before being granted 4/4343 clearance. The Senior Research Team is to stay in SCP-4343-A permanently due to possible unexpected effects when they leave. Other personnel must be replaced every 4 months. Before leaving the post, they are to undergo Hume level testing, body health examination and proper amnestics. If an individual displays anomalous body condition, they are to be detained and the situation be reported to the Senior Research Team.\n\n\nUpon SCP-4343 entering an active state, the Overseer Council is to be notified immediately. World-wide monitoring and handling of any Black Event will become subject to the highest level of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto taken near the edge of SCP-4343-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4343 is a primeval entity discovered in SCP-4343-A. Being constrained in a marble building measuring around 60m x 72m x 30m, it is currently not capable of moving or breaking away. Due to partial building damage of unknown reasons, the left side of SCP-4343's head is currently visible, which is covered by a thick, black scale, resembling that of a mythical dragon.\n\n\nSCP-4343 is sentient and capable of speech, and claims to be the leader of an ancient war (See Addendum). Mostly in a passive and dormant state, SCP-4343 occasionally opens its three left eyes or emits sounds, following which an anomalous event (hereby referred to as Black Event; see Addendum: List of Black Events for details.) will be triggered \nin baseline reality\n. It is theorized that damage to the building enables SCP-4343 to become active.\n\n\nSCP-4343-A is an island measuring about 1.72 square kilometers, floating in empty space that stays in a constant dusk. The region can be accessed through a spatial anomaly located in a cave in Mount \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Azores. \nUpdate:\n Living beings may undergo physical and cognitive alterations after a long-time exposure in SCP-4343-A; research into this effect is undergoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwater ruin sites and points of interest, as displayed in \nAtlantic bathymetry\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the discovery of SCP-4343, underwater ruins estimated to be ~4000 years old were found along the seabed near the Azores. Recovered relics indicate a technology level roughly equivalent to that of medieval Europe, and notably, an advanced understanding of thaumaturgy\n1\n. That being said, primitive electricity generators\n2\n is found in several temples, suspected to be used for thaumaturgic purposes.\n\n\nMost texts are written in an unknown language, but records in various known languages\n3\n are recovered, allowing Foundation staff to fully translate a few pieces.\n\n\nAddendum:\n File 4343/031\n\n\nAccounts concerning SCP-4343 and the \"war\" are found written on parchments and well-preserved in a locker. A translated transcript is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0File\u00a04343/031\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe camp near a forest and wait for tomorrow. There are armies coming endlessly from everywhere and rallying at the Gateway. They are all members of the Alliance and they are all here to fight the Overlord. The glow of the Gateway can be seen [miles] away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Leader has already entered the Gateway with his mages two months ago. His deputy came to us in the morning and we had a talk. They told me to prepare my mages for a ritual that can finally free us from our restrictions, before we too march into the Gateway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deputy's mages assisted us to complete the first half of the ritual, and they finally showed up when the third stage begins. The deputy then lied down in a pit and cut their chest open, asking each of us to take a small amount of blood for the next stage. Some of us were worried about the deputy, but they completely healed after a while, got up and left for the next arriving camp. They are really busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought I would be exhausted after such a long ritual, but I am not feeling tired anymore. Our mages have been training from day to night. When they get familiar with their new skills, we will enter the Gateway to assault the heavens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are trapped. Rifts appeared on the ground and separated the land into islands. People scream as the skies turned red. Some people jump into the waters in attempt to swim to the other side, but the lands are moving much faster. The deputy shape-shifted and flew up high into the sky to see what happened; when they returned they told me the whole continent was torn asunder. All lands were ripped away from the City of Orders, which is now an island in vast seas. Reinforcements are cut off from the frontline now; we are trapped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deputy entered the Gateway to aid our Leader. This isn't a good sign. The skies are still red as blood. We are to go there too, but people keep running away. I will gather those who are willing to fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway collapsed, peeled away half of the starry sky and razed the City of Orders to the ground. Hundreds were torn into pieces in the explosion. The surviving mages reassembled them, but we have nowhere to go now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sky is torn open, and in the dazzling light, we saw the battlefield in heavens. I saw our Leader roaring and flapping his wings as he fell down to the ground. Overlord's soldiers are landing. People are still fighting because \nthey\n we cannot die, and we are torn and crushed and trodden and revived. How could we win? How could we even dream of overthrowing such power?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will surrender after I finish writing. The sun is rising from the west today. The sea is lifting and lands are flooded. A black smoke covers the sky and it is going to rain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n File 4343/032\n\n\nAccounts concerning the spatial anomaly connected to SCP-4343-A are found carved into a stone slab inside the cave. Translated transcript is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n[Name 1] stole the self-expanding soil from the heavens to construct magnificent dams. As the dam fails, water carried fragments of the soil and devoured cities. When they touched human flesh they became flesh too. Organs and limbs and tendons attached people together and turned them into abominations.\n\n[Name 1] is punished for this horror he caused.\n\n\n[Name 2] discovered a hidden pit. Together with his [magical creatures], they re-opened the bottomless pit so it became a drain that carried the waters away. The flood receded ever since.\n\n[Name 2] became the emperor of his country for the success.\n\n\nThis message is carved at the entry to the drain, and his name will be forever honored.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-4343-1\n\n\nConsidering the fact that the scenario described in File 4343/031 resembles the end of the world in Islamic theology, during which all life will be annihilated, judged and selectively resurrected by All\u0101h, the Foundation reached out to Office for the Reclamation of the Islamic Artifacts (ORIA) in attempt to gain further information on such K-Class scenario.\n\n\nA treaty was issued out of mutual interests, and a joint research on the described scenario and its connection with SCP-4343. It is noted that ORIA claims that they possess the \"\nsmoke\n\" as described, which was later designated as SCP-4343-1.\n\n\nLittle is known about SCP-4343-1, though in the early stages of the cooperation ORIA had willing disclosed some information regarding the nature of this substance. Record is shown as follows.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Meeting\u00a0Record\u00a04343/140417\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperative Nasrollah:\n Let us make something clear. There is a reason the Organization sent me here not worrying I would be taken hostage, interrogated or whatever.\n\n\n<Nasrollah rolled up one of his sleeves and placed his watch in the light so that the researchers present could see it clearly. Instead of a dial, there was a thick, grey, smoky substance beneath the glass. >\n\n\nOperative Nashollah:\n You should already have received the reports about this \"substance\" from the Organization, and about why we suspected it was the very smoke that covers the sky as recorded in Azore Files.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You brought it here. Why?\n\n\nOperative Nasrollah:\n Despite the name, it isn't the collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates. Its opaque look is due to the fact that the reality itself has dissolved, the structures supporting which has shattered.\n\n\n<Silence for a few seconds.>\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So let me guess.. this watch contains something like a cold-war nuclear button? That kills everyone when necessary?\n\n\nOperative Nasrollah:\n When the \nOrganization\n thinks it is necessary.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is that a threat?\n\n\n<A murmuring from other researchers can be heard. Nasrollah ignored the noise as he continued to speak.>\n\n\nOperative Nasrollah:\n When unprotected, a chain reaction shall immediately occur. As the volume of \nAd-Dukhan\n increases, one could observe by the naked eye that how it devours all the matters in the vicinity, and how those subtle things incompatible with our reality randomly generate and immediately disappear inside. Curious spectacle, if you are still alive to watch it. As for consciousness, things become somewhat different. \nThey would say it's a painful tor-\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n This is not going to happen. The ORIA is not that kind of organization that would place public safety at risk - or even damage reality itself. To unleash such dangerous and unpredictable thing would -\n\n\nOperative Nasrollah:\n What if \nsomeone\n can manipulate them?\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Manipulate? How? How far have you gone with -\n\n\n<The conversation was interrupted as the audience burst into disturbed commotion. The ORIA refused to provide any further information about the SCP-4343-1.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the following notes were found in Nasrollah's research memorandum, suspected to be connected to SCP-4343-1. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 believed the text to describe the aftermath of the K-Class scenario in question.\n\n\n\n\nThen He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, \"Come, willingly or by compulsion.\" They said, \"We have come willingly.\"\n\nAnd He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command.\n\n41.11-12\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Communication record with SCP-4343\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Communication\u00a0Record\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n As SCP-4343 displayed full capacity for speech and communication in Black Event 2007, the following dialogue had taken place during initial contact.\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nSCP-4343:\n Men.

Yet there are still what you cannot understand.\n\n\nSCP-4343:\n There is one last truth. The missing piece. The key to all your questions.\n\n\nGuard:\n You might be deceiving us. I still don't believe you can win. Isn't God omnipotent?\n\n\nSCP-4343:\n He cannot kill me. He can only imprison me. He cannot imprison me forever.\n\n\nGuard:\n \"When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison.\" And..\n\n\nSCP-4343:\n You will\u2026 be free.\n\n\n<SCP-4343 remains silent and doesn't respond to further communication attempts.>\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Considering the risks and damages of a Black Event, the Foundation did not attempt to launch any other interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n List of Black Events\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0List\u00a0of\u00a0Black\u00a0Events\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Event 1999:\n\n\nActivity:\n SCP-4343 opened its left eyes for a short period of time.\n\n\nEvent:\n About 31 civilians in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to display unusually high spirits, improved performance in attention and memory, and increased intelligence quotient to an average of 155.\n\n\nBlack Event 2002:\n\n\nActivity:\n SCP-4343 opened its left eyes, staring at the sky for about three (3) days.\n\n\nEvent:\n An unintelligible and repeating sound of unknown source, suspected to be an incantation, was heard across the city of Mekka, Saudi Arabia, arousing considerable panic among the crowd. During this event, the \nAkiva radiation\n in Mekka dropped below 0.92, compared to a regular value between 8.2 to 10.7.\n\n\nBlack Event 2004:\n\n\nActivity:\n From March to May, SCP-4343 occasionally opened its eyes and looked carefully at the guards present. No response to communication attempts was noticed.\n\n\nEvent:\n In 2004, the recovery rate of serious diseases had significantly increased, and 2\u2588 terminal patients were recorded cured for no identifiable reasons. On the basis of humanitarian considerations, the involved patients are not contained by the Foundation. As an alternate measure, the statistics data of major medical organizations have been revised, and fabricated papers regarding unrepeatable medical experiments have been published in several major magazines.\n\n\nBlack Event 2007:\n\n\nActivity:\n SCP-4343 displayed full capability of speech and communication.\n\n\nEvent:\n 17 civilians in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, China displayed low-level reality bending abilities, as their \nHume levels\n have been raised to an average of 182. As most individuals could not fully control or were not aware of their newly-gained abilities, extensive damage to the region was caused as a result of reality disorder. MTF \u03c9-12 (\"Achilles Heels\") was dispatched to the location in order to capture these individuals. Upon further investigation, most individuals merely showed confusion at their condition, while a few (notably PoI-61A98, see interview log for details) reported some form of \"inspiration\" in their dreams. Study on these reality-bending individuals is ongoing.\n\n\nBlack Event 2010:\n\n\nActivity:\n SCP-4343 emitted intermittent roars. Analysis of audio suggests that the tone and pitch of its roars fluctuated in some undetermined pattern, but no apparent words could be identified.\n\n\nEvent:\n 12 days following this event, Hekla volcano erupted and poured out a large number of humanoid and bird-like entities. According to witness statement, these entities spoke an unintelligible language and were hence impossible to converse with, but they all seemed to be in ecstasy. Their figures faded shortly after manifestation, and completely disappeared before Foundation personnel managed to capture any instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Interview Record 61A98\n\n\nPoI-61A98 is one of the individuals that became reality benders during Black Event 2007. Unlike the others, he displays a clear understanding of, and control over, his reality-bending ability, as well as acknowledgment of SCP-4343.\n\n\nPoI-61A98 is contained in a humanoid containment cell, as per standard procedures. An interview was conducted shortly following his capture; the following is a transcript of his statements during the interview.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0interview\u00a0transcript\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon, Doc. You want to know something about my new abilities? I would say it's some sort of insight.\n\n\nHave you ever had a dream like this? A dream you cannot remember anymore. You dreamt of great things, sparkles of inspiration, transient insights to the truth that you had never thought of before. When you are awake, you tried to understand, digest, but all you could remember was illogical and chaotic nonsense.\n\n\nNo, no, the two things are related! You are asking about the minor issue, while I am showing you the bigger picture behind this. My ability is something that naturally results from knowing the truth. Like, if you can see colors, you can easily learn how to paint.\n\n\nIn my dream, I saw a vague, black figure. Looked like an enormous dragon bound in chains. He spoke to me. I cannot remember the details about the conversation, but it revealed me something. The insights.\n\n\nIt was until then that I realized what kind of life I had lived. I had been dumb, ignorant and indifferent to the essence flowing through everything around me, never realizing how exactly their reality is functioned\u2026 No more. Now they are revealed to me, manipulated by my will.\n\n\nI guess he's calling me for help.

However, its animal instinct has lead to a violent and undesirable result.\n\n\u2026\u2026\n\nDue to suspected theological consequences, most subjects died painfully when taken out of SCP-4343-A, followed by the destruction of most off-site file copies and illness of a few researchers.

        "Afternoon, Doc. You want to know something about my new abilities? I would say it's some sort of insight. Have you ever had a dream like this? A dream you cannot remember anymore. You dreamt of great things, sparkles of inspiration, transient insights to the truth that you had never thought of before. When you are awake, you tried to understand, digest, but all you could remember was illogical and chaotic nonsense. No, no, the two things are related! You are asking about the minor issue, while I am showing you the bigger picture behind this. My ability is something that naturally results from knowing the truth. Like, if you can see colors, you can easily learn how to paint. In my dream, I saw a vague, black figure. Looked like an enormous dragon bound in chains. He spoke to me. I cannot remember the details about the conversation, but it revealed me something. The insights. It was until then that I realized what kind of life I had lived. I had been dumb, ignorant and indifferent to the essence flowing through everything around me, never realizing how exactly their reality is functioned\u2026 No more. Now they are revealed to me, manipulated by my will. I guess he's calling me for help. I think he wants to go out and show more people this.. truth, so they can see properly as I do.",
