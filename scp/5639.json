Non-Foundation researchers requesting access to SCP-5639 are to be turned away using cover story Kappa-14 (\"Holy Hell\").\n\n\nNo living creature is to be allowed entry to SCP-5639, though exploration through the use of wireless relay and disposable drones is possible. Researchers wishing to explore the interior of SCP-5639 must provide a disposable drone \nwith vocalization capabilities\n for Miranda.aic to pilot and a signature of approval from their Site Director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5639 is a compound of abandoned buildings surrounded by a seven-meter-high wall located on the outskirts of Rome, Italy. The buildings within SCP-5639 have the appearance of a monastery, but there are no markers to indicate if SCP-5639 is a true monastery. Vatican archives have no record of a monastic establishment at SCP-5639's location.\n\n\nSCP-5639-\u03b4 is a virus that saturates SCP-5639. SCP-5639-\u03b4 infection has a 100% fatality rate in Kingdom Animalia members, and entry into SCP-5639 guarantees saturation and/or infection. Infection is contingent upon inhalation of the virus. However, SCP-5639-\u03b4 has an anomalous ability to permeate any membrane brought into SCP-5639, regardless of material thickness or chemical makeup. As such, hazmat suits and other protective measures have proven unreliable as protection against SCP-5639-\u03b4.\n\n\nSymptoms of SCP-5639-\u03b4 infection are uniform. Subjects that inhale SCP-5639-\u03b4 are immediately subject to haemoptysis. The infected subject will cough up blood continuously before succumbing to exsanguination. For humans, this process takes approximately 30 minutes. Animal death times vary based on size and lung capacity. Additionally, anything infected or saturated with SCP-5639-\u03b4 is prevented from exiting SCP-5639 due to what witnesses have described as \"an invisible wall.\"\n\n\nSCP-5639-1 is a red-cloaked entity that inhabits SCP-5639, and the apparent source of SCP-5639-\u03b4. Miranda.aic has reported an increase in SCP-5639-\u03b4 density wherever SCP-5639-1 is present, and new SCP-5639-\u03b4 particles manifest in its presence. SCP-5639-1 has an anomalous ability to de-materialize, but is unable to leave SCP-5639. Miranda.aic has attempted interviews and excavations to determine the origin of SCP-5639-\u03b4 and SCP-5639-1, with varying degrees of success.\n\n\nSCP-5639-2 is a leather-bound journal entitled \nThe Gospel According to Sebastian\n, penned in Italian. SCP-5639-2 claims to be the autobiography of the historical \nSt. Sebastian\n, transcribed at the request of his wife. It was discovered following an interview of SCP-5639-1 by Miranda.aic. The veracity of SCP-5639-2 is contested, but the existence of SCP-5639-1 suggests that at least some of SCP-5639-2's claims are true. See \nAddendum 2\n for contents.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Miranda.aic has attempted to interview SCP-5639-1 on multiple occasions, with only two successful attempts. See transcript for the first.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5639-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Miranda.aic\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview took place in the apparent chapel of SCP-5639. Although SCP-5639-1 had largely avoided Miranda.aic, it confronted her upon entry to the chapel. SCP-5639-1 spoke predominantly in Italian or Latin, but some words in its vocabulary were determined to be a portmanteau that left some ambiguity in interpretation. See footnotes for untranslated terms.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-5639-1:\n You do not [belong/live]\n1\n here. This is a [cursed/holy] [prison/chapel]\n2\n.\n\n\nMiranda.aic:\n Please state your name so that I may properly identify you.\n\n\nSCP-5639-1:\n You are not [sick/alive]\n3\n. How is this so?\n\n\nMiranda.aic:\n I am an artificial intelligence and therefore not susceptible to biological diseases. The question of life is deeply philosophical in nature and above my clearance level. I repeat, please state your name so that I may properly identify you.\n\n\nSCP-5639-1:\n You must leave, or die.\n\n\nMiranda.aic:\n I have backed up my data to a cloud. I am not in danger. I can see that you are forming new bacteria particles. Do you control the disease that permeates this complex?\n\n\nSCP-5639-1:\n I am the disease. I control him. You can leave?\n\n\nMiranda.aic:\n I can leave, yes. Why are you unable to leave?\n\n\nSCP-5639-1:\n (visibly agitated, minor static in video feed) Trapped! [Cursed/blessed]\n4\n was the day! Is\u2026 (clamps right hand over mouth, but left hand pulls it away) Isotta! Is she aaaaaaaaaaaaaa (SCP-5639-1 shakes violently. Miranda.aic perceives a spike in Akiva levels. SCP-5639-1 points its left finger at the altar of the chapel.) Un\u2026 (SCP-5639-1 de-materializes).\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Following the interview, SCP-5639-1 did not physically manifest for seven hours. Miranda.aic examined underneath the altar where SCP-5639-1 was pointing, and uncovered what was designated SCP-5639-2. See \nAddendum 2.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n Although unable to remove SCP-5639-2 from SCP-5639, Miranda.aic was able to send translations to Foundation personnel. Relevant excerpts are attached.\n\n\n\n\nSebastian\u00a01:1-17,\u00a0On\u00a0Sebastian's\u00a0Survival\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe gospel according to Sebastian, whom the savior protected from death twice. \n2\nFirst, they shot him with arrows, but the savior did not find fit to bring him unto heaven. \n3\nFilled with fire, he confronted the Emperor Diocletian, preaching in the name of Jesus Christ. \n4\nAnd Diocletian, filled with rage, had him beaten with cudgels until there were no signs of life left in him, and they dumped his body in the sewer.\n\n\n5\nBut the savior still did not find fit to bring him unto heaven. And so, he awoke. \n6\nSebastian was a noble man, and beloved follower of Christ. \n7\nBut the Roman arrows and cudgels had pierced his heart with doubt, and so he said,\n\n\n8\n\"Even my savior did not suffer three executions. Christ asks a surrendered life; I have given mine twice. Surely that is enough.\"\n\n\n9\nAnd so he appeared before Lucina, telling her he had died and where to find his body. \n10\nBut it was not his body, and so Sebastian knowingly sinned. \n11\nAnd, like Jonah, the savior found a fit punishment for him.\n\n\n12\nHe fled to Sardinia, pursuing quiet and peace. He lived a meager life, worshiping his savior and praying forgiveness for his cowardice. \n13\nBut the savior did not find fit to bring him unto heaven. Years passed, and he did not age. \n14\nSickness came to Sardinia and he did not fall ill. For one hundred years, he lived on the island. \n15\nAnd they persecuted him, not in the name of his savior, but for his demonic youth and health. They pummeled him, but he healed. Finally, Sebastian said,\n\n\n16\n\"It has been decades since Constantine permitted the following of my savior in the empire of Rome. Babies born at the time of my recorded death are wizened. \n17\nThe remains believed to be mine had been given their own holy basilica. It is safe to return to Rome.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian\u00a06:8-12,\u00a0On\u00a0the\u00a0Call\u00a0to\u00a0Healing\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n8\nAnd a plague came from Constantinople. \n9\nSebastian looked upon the wounds of the afflicted, and saw himself in them, for their sores looked like arrow wounds. \n10\nAnd the savior whispered unto Sebastian, \n11\n\"For this purpose I have preserved you. Be my hands and feet to the sick. \n12\nYou will not fall ill.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian\u00a013:1-17,\u00a0On\u00a0the\u00a0Esoteric\u00a0Order\u00a0of\u00a0St.\u00a0Sebastian\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe Black Death ravaged Rome, and Sebastian found himself helpless. \n2\nThe cries of the sick invaded his nightmares. There were too many patients, and the savior had not found fit to bless Sebastian with miraculous healing abilities like his own. \n3\nSebastian stood at the deathbed of wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, and children, and consoled the grieving. \n4\nThe wounds of the afflicted mocked him, saying \n5\n\"Why Sebastian and no one else?\"\n\n\n6\nAnd in their desperation, the people turned to paganism. \n7\nThose who Sebastian could not treat prayed to Morbus, the Red-Cloaked One, for healing. \n8\nHoping to glean some medical practice from their rituals, Sebastian attended one. The atrocities witnessed in the ritual would haunt his nightmares for decades to come. \n9\nAnd yet, Sebastian prayed forgiveness for the participants, that the savior might absolve them of abominations committed in desperation.\n\n\n10\nThe people cried out to St. Sebastian, protector against plagues, for salvation. \n11\nSebastian heard their cry and interceded for them, \n12\nbut he could not walk the halls of heaven and ask the savior for healing in person as they desired.\n\n\n13\nThen Christ whispered once more unto Sebastian, \n14\n\"Go into the city and find the men I have sent for you.\" \n15\nSo Sebastian did as He commanded, and found six healers awaiting him. \n16\nThey were men of faith, all, and so Sebastian was inspired by the savior to form an order. \n17\nAnd thus, the Esoteric Order of St. Sebastian was created, \n18\nand the Red-Cloaked One was starved of his worship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian\u00a021:10-17,\u00a024-26;\u00a024:5-8,\u00a0On\u00a0Sebastian's\u00a0Family\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n10\nNow, Sebastian had forsaken the embrace of women since his youth. It did not seem fitting for one such as he to take a wife, \n11\nand the savior had warned him against adultery. \n12\nIn time, though, he came to love a woman.\n\n\n13\nIsotta Borroni had come from the north, from Venice, seeking aid for her dying brother. \n14\nThe Esoteric Order took her in, and it was decided that Sebastian would treat the man. \n15\nAnd as he worked to heal her brother, the savior blessed him with feelings he had not known. \n16\nWhen he beheld Isotta, he understood. \n17\nAnd so he proposed marriage to her, saying\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]\n\n\n24\nAnd Isotta accepted his proposal, and the marriage day was set. And on the 5th of August, the year of our Lord 1874, Sebastian became Sebastian Borroni, husband of Isotta Borroni. \n25\nFor a wedding gift, he presented her with this gospel, \n26\nwith the promise to add more pages as their lives went on.\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]\n\n\n5\nAfter six years of marriage, the savior blessed them with a son, who they named Dante. \n6\nAnd the boy became sick after birth, to his father's relief, \n7\nfor he did not wish to pass on his Christ-given longevity. \n8\nThe boy recovered, with his father's healing, and all was well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian\u00a030:1-38,\u00a0On\u00a0Morbus\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n1\nIt was at this time Sebastian realized he had been a fool. He had heard of a German proposing that sickness was transmitted through tiny organisms that clung to clothes, but thought nothing of it. \n2\nDante Borroni died of consumption on the 2nd of December, the year of our Lord 1889. \n3\nHis parents cried out in grief to their savior for healing, \n4\nbut He did not answer.\n\n\n5\nThe consumption which took Dante was a virulent strain. Sebastian had taken a patient with similar symptoms before the boy became sick. \n6\nThe patient had died via exsanguination. In the patient's death throes, Sebastian sensed something directly at work against his savior.\n\n\n7\nDante was not the last to suffer the strain. \n8\nEvery day, Sebastian took more and more patients with the same symptoms. He could not cure a single one. \n9\nThe savior did not answer his prayers.\n\n\n10\nAnd so, for the first time in a millennium, Sebastian sought out the old cults again. \n11\nAfter months of searching, he found an acolyte of the Red-Cloaked One. And he said unto the acolyte,\n\n\n12\n\"Why does a new form of consumption ravage the city?\"\n\n\n13\nAnd the acolyte responded, \"Our lord has grown tired of his formlessness. He seeks a human body, \n14\nso that he might walk among mortals again. \n15\nBut no corpse is fit to contain him, \n16\nall who have tried have died.\"\n\n\n17\nAnd Sebastian did not hear the whisper of the savior, \n18\nbut he knew in his heart what he must do. So he gathered his Order and his wife unto him, saying\n\n\n19\n\"My savior was sent as a lamb to free us from the disease of the soul. I have been sent as a lamb to free us from the disease of the body. \n20\nThe demon Morbus demands a body, and intends to kill the whole of Rome to obtain it. \n21\nI cannot let that happen. I will offer my own body to the scoundrel.\"\n\n\n22\nThe Order and his wife disagreed with him, saying,\n\n\n23\n\"Surely you cannot give this abomination a way to walk among the living. Who knows how many souls he will take then?\"\n\n\n24\nAnd Sebastian calmed them, saying \"I do not intend to let this Morbus run free. \n25\nMy brothers, our savior is the lord and master of all lesser spirits. \n26\nWhat our God has bound, no power can unbind. You must bless the walls of the monastery, \n27\npraying that He will not let the monster escape.\" \n28\nAnd the brothers were at peace.\n\n\n29\nThen Sebastian said unto his wife, \n30\n\"My darling, I hope that you will find our son in heaven. \n31\nI pray that once the demon has entered my body, my soul will be freed to join you. But I cannot say for sure. \n32\nAs always, I trust my savior for mercy. \n33\nMay you live long and prosper.\" \n34\nAnd his wife was at peace.\n\n\n35\nSo the brothers blessed the walls of their monastery, leaving the gates open for the entity to enter. \n36\nThat morning, Sebastian entered, gospel in hand, prepared to pen his last thoughts for his beloved Isotta. \n37\nThe acolyte of Morbus entered the trap, and agreed to deliver the journal as a last request. \n38\nAnd the acolyte performed the ritual, [END OF SCP-5639-2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3:\n Following the translation of SCP-5639-2, Foundation researchers tracked public records on Sebastian, Isotta, and Dante Borroni. All dates recorded in SCP-5639-2 are consistent with public records. However, Sebastian Borroni is recorded as having died in 1890 CE of consumption. After assembling a file on the Borroni family, Miranda.aic attempted contact with SCP-5639-1 again, resulting in the second successful interview.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5639-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Miranda.aic\n\n\nForeword:\n Miranda.aic located SCP-5639-1 in the apparent chapel of SCP-5639 and confronted it.
