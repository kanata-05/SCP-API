Foundation Webcrawler 402-OVERFISHING has been tasked with monitoring all archival media networks to detect and excise instances of SCP-7751-A, which are then stored at Site-59's media wing.\n\n\nBy order of the Ethics Committee, a moratorium has been placed on further procurement of SCP-7751-B for any reason. The mailroom of the Chicago Sun-Times has been placed under Foundation control. All incoming mail is to be scanned unopened through specialized equipment. If a request for SCP-7751-B has been detected, that piece of mail is to remain unopened and incinerated.\n\n\nAll extant SCP-7751-B instances are to be placed in cryogenic stasis at Site-7751, pending further research to decrease their suffering.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7751 is a political concept with an unclear meaning. There is no evidence that SCP-7751 is a discussed topic in today's\n1\n political climate.\n\n\nSCP-7751 is capable of altering political media to include its presence. However, this can only be done with media that has been archived for a minimum of five years. Additionaly, only media from primarily English-speaking countries is affected.\n\n\nSCP-7751-A denotes a piece of media that has been affected in this manner. Approximately 98% of discovered SCP-7751-A are single-panel political cartoons. In cartoons, SCP-7751 is most commonly symbolized as a gigantic green moray eel labeled \"the Clurmbix Question,\" \"CBQ,\" or \"CB?\"\n\n\nWhen questioned, living creators of content altered by SCP-7751-A have displayed no knowledge of its existence.\n\n\nPartial Log of Collected SCP-7751-A Instances\n\n\nNumber:\n SCP-7751-17\n\n\nDate:\n December 12, 1805\n\n\nType:\n Single-panel cartoon\n\n\nOriginal Creator(s):\n James Gilray\n\n\nTitle:\n \"Libert-OH!

Before Obamacare, before our sultan-in-chief weaseled his way into the Oval Office, before the whole damn country collectively lost its mind \u2014 we gotta remember how deep this \nreally\n runs, people.\n\n\nTake a long, blood-red string, trace it all-l-l the way back to the source of all the corruption in Washington \u2014 and when you get there, you gotta ask yourself: What about Clurmbix? Who's gonna account for Clurmbix?\n\n\n(Sound of shuffling papers)\n\n\nNo, listen, lemme tell you something about Clurmbix\u2026\n\n\n(24 seconds of silence.)\n\n\nGood ol' Clurmbix.\n\n\n(3 minutes and 38 seconds of Limbaugh breathing heavily.)\n\n\n\u2026sweet momma mo-lasses.\n\n\n(Sound of a fist slamming against a table three times, followed by the table cracking.)\n\n\n(Limbaugh laughs, sleepily.)\n\n\nYeah\u2026\n\n\n(He clicks his tongue 27 times.)\n\n\n(6 minutes of dead silence.)\n\n\n\u2026I'm just gonna throw something at the wall and see if it sticks.

The surface world is where all the Food Lions are, and where else at the bottom of the ocean are you gonna get two-for-one on Kellogg's?\n\n\n(He cries deeply.)\n\n\nSo what if he were to suddenly resurface? The decompression would balloon him to the size of cities! Continents! Nations! And should he survive this second defilement of physics, would he not deserve all the happy little rewards in the Universe?

Moving on! Let's talk about something more lighthearted, like police brutality\u2026\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7751-B refers to a biologically immortal lifeform 10 centimeters in height. All damage received heals within a maximum of ten seconds. Tissue samples taken from subjects have revealed both human and green moray eel DNA. SCP-7751-B has a vaguely humanoid frame. The only visible sensory organs are a miniature human mouth, a single nostril, and a single ear canal. Other than randomly scattered bodily hair and a skin tag on the torso in the shape of a necktie. Its limbs have no fingers or toes.\n\n\nSCP-7751-B is produced when the Chicago Sun-Times is sent a piece of physical mail requesting information regarding SCP-7751. This cannot be replicated by sending requests to other newspapers. Even through advanced interrogation techniques, no Chicago Sun-Times personnel have expressed knowledge of SCP-7751-B.\n\n\nHowever, seven days after the request is opened at the Sun-Times headquarters, an instance of SCP-7751-B appears in a cardboard box at the place where the requestor would receive incoming packages. The box's return address is listed as the Sun-Times Building in Chicago. Within the box is a mason jar filled with an instance of SCP-7751-B packed in horse dung.\n\n\nA handwritten label on the mason jar lists the following instructions:\n\n\n\n\n1. BREAK WITH HAMMER \n(DO NOT OPEN)\n\n2. \nGET AWAY\n\n3. SPRINKLE WITH IODIZED SALT\n\n4. YOU'RE WELCOME, \nBITCH\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/30/2023, seven days after sending the appropriate request, Foundation Site-59's receiving department obtained an instance of SCP-7751-B, hereafter SCP-7751-B-1.\n\n\n\n\nInterview log - SCP-7751-B-1\n\n\nDate:\n 10/30/2023\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-59 Testing Room C1\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n(The jar containing SCP-7751-B-1 sits on a table in the center of the testing chamber. Researcher Daniels approaches with a claw hammer. Dr. Nichols accompanies him.)\n\n\nDaniels:\n Goggles on. Ready when you are.\n\n\n(Nichols nods.)\n\n\n(Daniels taps the jar's lid with the hammer. The sides crack.)\n\n\nNichols:\n Your orders are to break it open.\n\n\nDaniels:\n Well, I don't want to damage it! Just seems kinda counterintuitive.\n\n\nNichols:\n Thank you for your insight. \nBreak it open.\n\n\n(Daniels winds up a stronger swing.)\n\n\n(There's a sudden, muffled screech from within the jar.)\n\n\n(Daniels hesitates.)\n\n\nNichols:\n \n(Sigh)\n It's biologically immortal! Just whack the goddamn \u2014\n\n\n(The jar explodes.)\n\n\n(Both Nichols and Daniels fall onto the floor with several shards of glass embedded in their torsos.)\n\n\nDaniels:\n Gaah, fuck!\n\n\nNichols:\n And \nthis\n is why we wear our goggles.\n\n\n(SCP-7751-B-1 flails blindly in what's left of the packing material, shrieking.)\n\n\nUgh. Get the salt and let's get this over with.\n\n\nDaniels:\n I think there's horse shit in my blood.\n\n\nNichols:\n One thing at a time! \nSalt!\n\n\n(They both get back up. Daniels pours a small vial of iodized salt over SCP-7751-B-1.)\n\n\n(SCP-7751-B-1 immediately stops shrieking. It speaks with an adult human baritone.)\n\n\nSCP-7751-B-1:\n Oh, right, we're doing \nthis\n.\n\n\n(It stands up straight, adjusting its skin tag like a tie.)\n\n\nSCP-7751-B-1:\n Sorry about the mess.\n\n\nNichols:\n You can talk? \u2026Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nSCP-7751-B-1:\n Okay, let's keep this relevant to the Clurmbix Question - I'm kind of on borrowed time here and you \ndo not\n want to have to clean this up again with the next thrall-canvasser, right? Right.\n\n\nNichols:\n Thrall-canvasser?\n\n\nSCP-7751-B-1:\n Oh, for fuck's sake \u2014 \nSURE!\n Great! Let's talk about ME!
