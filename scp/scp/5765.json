Should SCP-5765 be empirically proven to contain bees, containment procedures should be updated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5765 is a standard Foundation containment unit, previously designated \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-A. It is believed to contain a large number of bees, although no empirical evidence of this has yet been obtained. Tests are ongoing to definitively confirm the presence of bees in SCP-5765.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached Addenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5765.1: Abridged Test Logs\n\n\n\n\nAll tests were conducted by Researcher J. Edmunson. For full records, please contact Head Researcher Dr. Johannes Ashby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 1: REMOTE VISUAL SEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDr. Edmunson searches the interior of SCP-5765 using standard observational cameras present within the containment unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nWhy do we even have these cameras if they can't see the subject being contained? Do we really think someone is going to break in to steal bees? Requesting a higher resolution video feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 2: VISUAL SEARCH FROM ROOM PERIMETER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nResearcher Ayim searches SCP-5765 from secure doorway and attempts to visually ascertain presence of bees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nTest result compromised: my research assistant apparently forgot to mention that he wears 1.25 diopter reading glasses. Redoing test after Researcher Ayim corrects his vision deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 3: VISUAL SEARCH FROM ROOM PERIMETER, WITH CORRECTIVE LENSES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nResearcher Ayim searches SCP-5765 from secure doorway and attempts to visually ascertain presence of bees while wearing his corrective lenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nWhile I wait for our optics people to verify that the reading glasses are of an appropriate strength for Researcher Ayim, I think it's apt to get some face time with these bugs. I'll put in an order with human resources and see who we can get for future testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 9: SEARCH BY D-CLASS PERSONNEL (D-72771)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nD-72771 enters SCP-5765 and commences search directed by Dr. Edmunson via intercom. Search was discontinued when D-72771 voluntarily ceased responding to direction, but his observation and debrief is considered thorough for the purpose of this test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nWell, it appears these bees are indeed anomalous in some way that makes them difficult to detect. That's more data than we had, at least. Perhaps we need to encourage them to interact with D-72771.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST LOG AVAILABLE\n\n\n\n\n**OPEN\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG**\n\n\n\n\n**CLOSE\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI85765-T3 Test Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 01/02/2020, 0940 hours\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Joseph Edmunson\n\n\nTeam Member:\n Dr. Mwanahamisi Ayim\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Are we online, Ayim?\n\n\nAyim:\n We are.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n D-72771, please enter the containment chamber.\n\n\nD-72771:\n Haven't I already tested this chamber?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Sorry? No, not according to my records. Please enter the containment chamber.\n\n\nD-72771:\n Yeah, going in now.\n\n\n(D-72771 slowly enters SCP-5765 and stands in the middle of the containment chamber.)\n\n\nD-72771:\n So where are the bees you were talking about?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Please repeat, Seventy-One.\n\n\nD-72771:\n I thought there were supposed to be bees in here?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n That's what we're trying to find out. Please examine your surroundings and locate any evidence of bees.\n\n\nD-72771:\n Nah, just an empty room. I don't see any [SCP]s or bees or anything.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Please look closer. Walk the perimeter of the room, check the corners.\n\n\n(D-71771 patrols the room, leaning down several times to examine the floor.)\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Have you found them yet?\n\n\nD-72771:\n No. Are you going to, uh, pour bees in here or something?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Of course not. We can't just introduce one population of bees to another like that. It would make a holy mess of SCP-5765.\n\n\nD-72771:\n So there \nare\n bees in here?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n We haven't confirmed that yet, Seventy-One. That's why you're standing in the middle of SCP-5765.\n\n\nD-72771:\n Wait, what? The \nchamber\n is 567-whatever? I thought we were talking about the bees.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n So you are seeing bees, then?\n\n\nD-72771:\n Look, is there something that's going to sting me? Just tell me.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Stung by \nwhat\n, Seventy-One?\n\n\nD-72771:\n \nBees?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n What bees are you seeing, Seventy-One?\n\n\n(D-72771 refuses to answer further questions, and is withdrawn from SCP-5765. No evidence was collected confirming the presence of bees within the containment chamber.)\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 12: SEARCH BY D-CLASS PERSONNEL, MODIFIED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSearch of containment unit by D-72771, who is heavily pollinated. D-72771 searches interior of containment cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nI have put in an order for an impressive variety of pollen.

Dr. Ewing searches SCP-5765 and makes numerous suggestions for locating and identifying bee population. Changes were implemented and reevaluated after one week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\nIt was worth ruling out the possibility of a non-anomalous infestation. Since Dr. Ewing's strategies should have driven out any normal bee species, we'll consider this a tentative confirmation that these creatures are indeed anomalous. Let's tear these plants up and continue testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST LOG AVAILABLE\n\n\n\n\n**OPEN\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG**\n\n\n\n\n**CLOSE\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI8576-27 Test Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 01/08/2020, 1158 hours\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Joseph Edmunson\n\n\nConsulting Member:\n Dr. Allison Ewing\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Alright, Doctor, you may begin whenever you're ready.\n\n\nEwing:\n Sure. I apologize, uh, this is a little awkward. I've been researching bees for twelve years, and haven't done anything like this. It's like I'm conducting an autopsy. Not used to having people watching.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n I understand. Our research facility is admittedly a bit unorthodox. Just say what you're thinking, and give us an idea of what we're dealing with. It'll feel more natural as you go.\n\n\nEwing:\n Okay, it's your show. Let's see them.\n\n\n(Ewing secures her beekeeping helmet and enters SCP-5765. She searches the room for sixty seconds.)\n\n\nEwing:\n Uh, I don't see any bees.\n\n\nEdumunson:\n Understood. Please continue.\n\n\nEwing:\n Continue?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Yes, please.\n\n\nEwing:\n Well, I don't see any bees. There's nothing in here.\n\n\n(Dr. Ewing begins to pace the outer perimeter of the containment chamber.)\n\n\nEwing:\n What's the temperature of this room?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Uh, let me check. One moment.\n\n\nEwing:\n It feels a bit chilly.\n\n\nEdmunson\n About 13 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nEwing:\n So yeah, that's a bit cold for bees. You could be dealing with some sort of cold-resistant species or subspecies, like we find with Carniolans or Russian honey bees, but either way, they're likely bundled up in the hive somewhere trying to keep warm. Can you adjust the temperature?\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Sure, bringing it up now. 18 or 19 good for you?\n\n\nEwing:\n Sure. Continuing. The room is barren of natural resources, or indeed any resources at all. If we turn this place into a garden, we might draw them out and get a better look. Most bees aren't very specific about the plants they'll mine for pollen, but a few are. In addition to lavender, holly, uh, clover and maybe echinacea, you'll want to also have dogwood and mustard for the pickier eaters. Makes sense they'd be hard to find if there's nothing here for them to eat.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n Understood, we'll make it happen. Ayim? Write that down?\n\n\nEwing:\n I'm not seeing any physical signs of bees. No damage from carpenters, no scouts. You mentioned nobody's been stung, so your bees either aren't aggressive or they simply don't feel threatened. Or, as I mentioned, they could be lethargic from the cold. We'll want to try pheromones for a couple of different species, at least.\n\n\nEdmunson:\n I'm actually a step ahead of you on that. I have someone ready to test that soon. Please, continue, your input is invaluable.\n\n\n(Transcript abridged, available in full as 57655-UA. Dr. Ewing makes numerous suggestions over nine hours for exposing bee populations. All suggestions are approved and implemented by Dr. Edmunson. One week after the environment of SCP-5765 has been converted to be friendlier to various bee species, no empirical evidence of bees is found. Dr. Ewing is administered Class B amnestic treatment and released.)\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 31: INTERIOR SEARCH OF SURROUNDING WALLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nFoundation maintenance staff conduct search of containment unit walls in accordance with pest-removal protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNo evidence of bees recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher notes\n\n\n[NONE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST 32: SEARCH BY HEAVILY BAITED D-CLASS PERSONNEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSearch of containment unit by D-72771, who is heavily pollinated, dressed in bright blue, purple, and yellow attire, and doused in sugar water and pheromones of three different bee species.

When individuals are told the contents of SCP-5765, they will invariably believe this information to be true. Notably, proximity to SCP-5765 seems to have no bearing on the anomalous effect; individuals who are aware of SCP-5765's physical existence are vulnerable to suggestion regarding its contents. While cognitoaffective, this effect lacks compulsive behavior or directly destructive psychological effects, and thus is not considered significantly cognitohazardous.\n\n\nThe nature of SCP-5765 makes it difficult to directly study its effects (\nsee Iteration 0, logged below\n). Research performed on SCP-5765 is to be conducted by individuals unaware of its cognitoaffective anomaly, and is to be directed by the Head Researcher, Dr. Johannes Ashby.\n\n\nSCP-5765 was previously used to contain SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which is currently undergoing reevaluation and classification. Due to the similarities in their effects, it is currently theorized that SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 experienced \"anomalous bleeding\" into SCP-5765, resulting in its current anomalous state. Research is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5765.3: Summaries of Previous Test Iterations\n\n\n\n\nPlease contact the Head Researcher for full records of previous test iterations.\n\n\nData is to be collected regarding how researchers proceed in testing and compiling information about SCP-5765. Approved research methodology prescribes informing researcher subjects that SCP-5765 contains some object of study and providing reasonable accommodations for locating those contents.\n\n\nUnreasonable accommodations may be approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 0\n\n\nSubject:\n None\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n None\n\n\nResults:\n Shortly after SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was transferred to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for reevaluation, the Head Researcher noticed members of the transportation team returning numerous times to the containment chamber and searching inside. When questioned, each member reported that they had returned to see if there was anything left to move, despite SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 being a single solid piece which was transported without incident.\n\n\nAfter several weeks of continued visits to the empty containment chamber by research and logistics personnel, the former Head Researcher requested the chamber be tentatively classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-A and evaluated for anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 1\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Machado\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n One banana.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Machado conducted several physical examinations of SCP-5765 looking for the banana before redirecting his research into the potential merelogical explanations for the undetected molecules that may have once made up the banana.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nIt's a shame Dr. Machado has absolutely no background whatsoever in metaphysics, or his research paper would have been significantly more readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 2\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Monaghan\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n One Maersk Triple E-class container ship.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Monaghan immediately deduced that SCP-5765 was too small to contain the suggested contents and expressed distress over the psychological dissonance that resulted. He presented a 532-page report dismissing the possibility that the suggested contents could fit inside of SCP-5765, which he followed up with a 254-page thesis proposing alternative mathematical schemas for calculating physical dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 3\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. O'Kane\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n A standard mixture of breathable air.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. O'Kane appeared confused and suspicious of her research direction and conducted several remote tests on the air quality within SCP-5765 before utilizing D-72771 to confirm. Her conclusion was that SCP-5765 contains breathable air and expressed annoyance toward the Head Researcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 4\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Horsfall\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n Enlightenment.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Horsfall's research methodology was erratic, ranging from taking numerous measurements of the room and its qualities, philosophical and religious interpretations of the room, meditation exercises within SCP-5765, and literary analysis of poetry and free-association written while inside. Dr. Horsfall required Class C amnestic treatment to successfully disengage her interest in locating suggested contents.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nWe can consider this confirmation that SCP-5765's effects are almost certainly related to its previous exposure to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 5\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Salinas\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n A sense of safety.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Salinas conducted numerous studies and, unable to definitively locate a sense of safety in the room, showed signs of paranoia and phobia regarding the contents of SCP-5765.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nOur researcher is now terrified of his research subject and little data could be acquired. This is unhelpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 6\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Trask\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n A sense of safety.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Trask conducted few remote examinations of SCP-5765 before entering it personally. She quickly responded that the room did indeed carry an \"intense\" feeling of safety. Dr. Trask then showed signs of paranoia and phobia regarding the world outside of SCP-5765 and refused to leave for 38 hours, when dehydration allowed her to be extracted by the Head Researcher.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nWhile it is useful to know that different subjects seem to produce different results when tested under largely identical circumstances, I'm convinced that SCP-5765 is likely one of those problems that is only a problem because we're messing with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 7\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Madison\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n A barely-audible mechanical whining sound.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Madison personally confirmed the presence of the sound within SCP-5765, but was unable to measure it using standard audiometric equipment. Initial conclusion that SCP-5765 causes selective vibrations within living matter that makes the sound impossible to detect outside of the human body.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nThis is an interesting conclusion, even though it's wrong. Perhaps SCP-5765 could be a viable means of incentivizing \"out of the box\" thinking in other research avenues. Recommending future studies in this direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration: 8\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Edmunson\n\n\nSuggested contents:\n Bees.\n\n\nResults:\n Dr. Edmunson has conducted numerous tests attempting to confirm the presence of bees in SCP-5765. This research has progressed at an increasing pace, and is currently in its second consecutive year of testing, with Dr. Edmunson showing no signs of dissonant distress.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nWhile I recognize that Edmunson was likely transferred to me due to \nthat whole fiasco with his previous project\n, he's provided a remarkable wealth of information regarding the limits of SCP-5765's cognitoaffective capabilities.
