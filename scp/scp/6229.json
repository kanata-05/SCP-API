Every month, SCP-6229 is to have a recorded therapy session by \nDr. Elijah Whitaker\n Angela Richards for a period of \none hour\n \nthree hours\n at minimum three hours, up to a maximum of forty-eight hours.\n\n\nA video feed of the unit is to be constantly monitored for any unauthorized departures. \nOne Scranton Reality Anchor is to be embedded into each wall, ceiling, and floor of the cell and activated in the event a demanifestation incident were to occur.\n\n\nWeylin and Rebecca Agapov are to be monitored by three Foundation agents at all times. Should SCP-6229 attempt to breach containment, Weylin Agapov is to be detained for a period of thirty minutes and, should SCP-6229 not return to containment, terminated.\n\n\nResearcher Evelyn Agapov is not to be assigned to SCP objects above Danger Level: Caution.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6229 is an incorporeal 24-year-old male humanoid formerly known as Bennet Hao Zhu. SCP-6229 consistently repels reality away from itself, resulting in a negative reality space where it should physically exist.\n\n\nAs a result of this state of non-existence, SCP-6229 does not possess a need, or the capability, to engage in standard bodily functions such as eating or sleeping, nor does it appear to age. It also appears to lack mundane senses including hearing and sight, instead relying on observing and measuring Humetic signatures\n1\n with assistance from SCP-6229-1.\n\n\nSCP-6229-1 is a full-body Andetheus-alloy\n2\n suit with adaptive Humetic properties, allowing SCP-6229 limited physicality. It is equipped with a camera and voice synthesizer, the former being a detachable component connected to the chestplate while the latter appears to be directly connected with the neck. SCP-6229-1 possesses an external hume concentration of 99.9, theoretically rendering it immune to reality-based alterations.\n\n\nPhysically, SCP-6229-1 is capable of exerting forces up to 2\u00a0kN with its arms and 8\u00a0kN with its legs and shows a high tolerance against damage, able to withstand temperatures up to 5000\u00b0C and impact forces from bullets smaller than .50 caliber. SCP-6229-1 is capable of becoming incorporeal, allowing both it and SCP-6229 to phase through physical objects at will.\n\n\nAs of cross-testing conducted on May 19th, 2018, SCP-6229 is confirmed able to ignore external anomalous behaviors and triggers. Cross-testing revealed that anomalous objects and concepts, such as antimemes, infohazards, thaumaturgy, etc.\n3\n had no effect on SCP-6229.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nFiles regarding SCP-6229 were seized by Foundation Agents from Prometheus Labs on August 26, 2008 following containment of SCP-6229. Those too damaged to read were sent to the Restoration Department.\n\n\nAudio transcribed by Foundation AICs. Given the volume of files, they have been ordered chronologically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrometheus\u00a0Labs:\u00a0Bennet\u00a0Hao\u00a0Zhu\u00a0Interview:\u00a0Access\u00a0Restricted\n\n\n\n\nPrometheus\u00a0Labs:\u00a0Bennet\u00a0Hao\u00a0Zhu\u00a0Interview:\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of an audio recording regarding SCP-6229's recruitment by Prometheus Labs.\n\n\nDate: 8/18/1995\n\n\nIndividuals: Agent Francis Morrison, Junior Researcher Bennet Hao Zhu (SCP-6229)\n\n\n\n\nMorrison:\n So, Mr. Hao, you're currently working under Dr. Goldstein, correct?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n That's right. I've been his assistant for four years now.\n\n\nMorrison:\n And during this time, your particular condition was discovered and subsequently cured by Prometheus Labs, correct?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n I wouldn't say 'cured'. More so-\n\n\nMorrison:\n Mr. Hao, are you currently able to experience a quality of life that you would not be able to without the assistance and care of Prometheus Labs?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n In the strictest sense, yes. But I'd hardl-\n\n\nMorrison:\n Are you aware that Prometheus Labs invested no less than eight hundred \nmillion\n dollars into your cure?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n No, I wasn't, and frankly that sounds rather expens-\n\n\nMorrison:\n Did you know that at your current salary, it'd take you over fifteen \nthousand\n years to pay off this debt?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n Are you putting the entire cost of resea-\n\n\nMorrison:\n Mr. Hao, please. Prometheus Labs has put a lot, and I mean \na lot\n, of money and time into you. Are you trying to say that you're not going to pay this off?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n I- I'm not going to pay off the entire cost of researching this thing. And didn't Prometheus develop some kind of reality stabilizer based off that research anyways?\n\n\nMorrison:\n Yes, and that's exactly why we're giving you an opportunity.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n \u2026what?\n\n\nMorrison:\n Prometheus Labs is giving you a chance to pay off this debt at a relatively low cost to you. I can't exactly tell you the details before you accept, but just between you and me, if you accept, Prometheus will waive the entire cost of your treatment\u2026 and your father's.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n I'm supposed to agree to something without even knowing what it is? Really?\n\n\nMorrison:\n Well\u2026 it's not like you really have a choice here, do you?\n\n\n\n\n[Transcript Ends.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions Proposal: Bennet Hao Zhu\n\n\nPrometheus Labs, Inc.\n\n\n8/22/1995\n\n\nApproved.\n\n\n- Director Pratsky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\u00a0Acquisitions\u00a0Post-Mission\u00a0Interview\u00a01:\u00a0Access\u00a0Restricted\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\u00a0Acquisitions\u00a0Post-Mission\u00a0Interview\u00a01:\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrometheus Labs: Acquisitions\n\n\nPost-Mission Interview 1\n\n\nDate: 8/28/1995\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Ethan Wei Hao\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Bennet Hao Zhu (SCP-6229)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n Are you fucking with me?

I cannot stand by while my brothers are targeted and shackled.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n Don't do it, Seth. There's a standing order to grab you. Lethal force authorized if necessary.\n\n\nSeth:\n We are \nsaving\n people. Can't you understand that? People who have been used, abused, and then thrown away. I have a duty to them; to save them. And to fulfill that duty I would do anything for my brothers and sisters. Even die.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n I have my own 'duties'. You can surrender yourself Seth, or we can take Karim.

Nothing?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n I've never heard of those people, no.\n\n\nRichards:\n Really? Huh. Well, let me tell you about them then. Eveyln Agapov, 22 years old, graduated from Dartmouth summa cum laude with a degree in biochemistry. A rather intelligent woman by all accounts and hired by the Foundation pretty much out the gate. Parents are Rebecca Agapov and Weylin Agapov.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n Are you trying to bore me? I don't know who these people are or why I should care-\n\n\nRichards:\n Hold on now. Weylin Agapov, 46 years old, unemployed. Formerly known as Ethan Wei Hao, ex-employee of Prometheus Labs. Currently lives at 633 Hedgewood Drive with his wife and two dogs. Sound familiar now?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n If you touch him, I'll kill every last one of you.\n\n\nRichards:\n Big words coming from a man who didn't even kill the one who sent Seth Clover to kill him the first time. Tell me, why \ndid\n you let him live? Was it his family? Did you feel bad?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n Tell me what you want.\n\n\nRichards:\n (\nSighing\n) Alright, fine. I want you to work for us.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n \u2026You want \nme\n to work for the Foundation? You are aware of what happened to the last company I worked for that tried to blackmail me, right?\n\n\nRichards:\n Not the Foundation as a whole, no, the Ethics Committee. I'm going to be honest with you here, Ben. Overwatch has probably already put your brother on the containment procedures. Probably your niece too. It's much cheaper to keep a bullet chambered than it is to have six full-sized Scrantons for one skip and we both know that they wouldn't stop you from breaching if you really tried.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n You're really giving me a lot of reasons to try right now.\n\n\nRichards:\n Which is why I'm offering a deal. Work with us and I guarantee the safety of not just your brother, but your niece too. I mean, you've been here for a while now, you know what happens in our sites no matter how hard we try. Don't you think your brother deserves to have his family this time?\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n You're sick, you know that?\n\n\nRichards:\n How many others do you think are being put through the same thing you were? The world is filled with Pratskys taking advantage of people just like you. I want you to help us help them. Frankly, Overwatch is entirely content with just holding your brother hostage and they really didn't want to let me talk with you. I'm giving you the opportunity to make this less one-sided for you. Please.\n\n\nSCP-6229:\n \u2026it's not like I really have a choice, do I?\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
