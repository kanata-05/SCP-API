Some information may seem unrelated, while some important information may not be included.\n\nComposing of this document by a being of class-B or above intelligence has been declared a low priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n ACO-7798\n\n\nLocation: U-1242, A-5, SC-7, Sys-18, P-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Meteor Belt\n\n\nClosed Knowledge - Moderate Importance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 individuals of Species ACO-7798-1 wearing clothing, image recovered from ACO-7798-RELIC12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n ACO-7798 is a meteor belt. ACO-7798 is believed to have formerly been a planet class object, which disintegrated into its current state through natural means\n1\n.\n\n\nTraversal to/through ACO-7798 is not advised due to high meteor belt density, abundance of alternative routes, and low importance. Extraction of natural resources have been set as a low priority due to the value of present resources and isolation from existing Galactic infrastructure.\n\n\nArtificial resources should be studied, not salvaged. Archeological study of ACO-7798 is deemed low priority, due to its low importance in Galactic history and low chance for new technological insight.\n\n\nArtifact composition:\n\n\n\n\nStructural ruins (Dwellings, workplaces, gathering places, etc.)- 98.2%\n\n\nOther relics (Tools, furniture, etc.) - 1.6%\n\n\nInformation cache relics (Written records, storage servers, story-telling monuments, etc.) - 0.2%\n\n\n\n\nMicroscopic, cellular life is present. Proof of macroscopic and intelligent life has also been found. Presumed extinct.\n\n\nAdvanced Information:\n ACO-7798 relics consists mainly of structural ruins made up of an artificial stone like material. Day-to-day use relics are mostly made up of processed metals and plastics. Informational caches on ACO-7798 are unusually rare. Initial investigation has shown that all surviving information caches were constructed by a single organization.\n\n\nACO-7798 was host to a wide variety of species and biospheres. The dominant intelligent species, classified Species ACO-7798-1, was present on all land environments. They called themselves Homo Sapiens, or Humans. They called their planet Earth. The disintegration of the planet into an asteroid belt is believed to driven the biosphere into its current form. Of note, biological remains of Humans are unusually rare.\n\n\nACO-7798 Unorganized Information:\n The following are files have been identified by AI as pertaining to ACO-7798, but have been flagged (by AI) for intelligent organization due to potential for deeper insight into ACO-7798 if organized by Intelligent beings.\n\n\nRecovered Relics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelic Designation\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC1\n\n\nRefined metal shaped in a long, flat, curved fashion. One end of the item is shaped into a concave oval. Theorized to be a tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC2\n\n\nPrimitive, but intelligently designed, machine. Constructed of curved metals, fabrics, and electronics. Digital reconstruction shows that if restored, the item is capable of locomotion at speeds of up to approximately 50 SQC\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC3\n\n\nLong, rectangular object that is constructed from a former flora species. Markings divide the object 1000 equal times, with larger markings each 100th mark. The object measures 1/10,000,000 of the length between the northern most point and the equator of ACO-7798 when it was a planet class object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC4\n\n\nFlat object constructed from heavily processed plant matter. Traces of pigment present. When digitally restored, it displays what is theorized to be an artistic representation of a region of ACO-7798 landmass when it was a planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC5\n\n\nMechanical machine constructed from refined metals. Digital reconstruction shows that, when activated, a spark of SiO2 is ignited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC6\n\n\nA compact collection of flat, heavily processed plant matter similar to that of ACO-7798-RELIC4. Chemical analysis shows that it was once bound together on one side with adhesive. Traces of pigment are found on each flat surface which indicate that this item stored information of the anatomy and biology of various species on ACO-7798 when it was a planet. Notably, a large section has no traces of pigment at all. This suggests a large deletion of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC7\n\n\nA primitive, digital storage device. Digital reconstruction reveals the information to be of primarily the natural processes of ACO-7798 such as geology, actions of various flora and fauna, volcanic activity, etc. Notably, the device has the capacity to store much more than is currently holding. This suggests a large deletion of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC8\n\n\nAn object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC6, but containing different information. Contains artistic representations of various flora and fauna of ACO-7798 when it was a planet. Representations are present only on a few of the available surfaces, the vast majority of surfaces are blank. This suggests a large deletion of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC9\n\n\nA large, fortified, enclosed structure. A large amount of data relics were found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC10\n\n\nNot a single object; but the system of cloaking technologies throughout the structure of ACO-7798-RELIC9. ACO-7798-RELIC10 was able to keep ACO-7798-RELIC9 hidden from visual, chemical, and psychological\n3\n detection for a period of 19 cycles\n4\n only recently deactivating in the past 0.2 cycles due to deterioration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC11\n\n\nAn object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC6, but containing different information. Contains artistic representations of various flora and fauna of ACO-7798 when it was a planet.

Research is to be directed towards neutralizing the effects of SCP-7798-2.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7798-2 is a celestial object approximately 1.6x larger than the sun, located 328 light years away from Earth. Noospheric imaging indicates that the information lost from SCP-7798-1 instances go towards SCP-7798-2 at a faster-than-noospheric-light speed.\n\n\nInformation lost as a result of SCP-7798 is always related to humanity in some fashion, whether it describes a man-made object or describes people/personified objects in a narrative. SCP-7798 also never affects information pertaining to natural phenomena. Due to these facts, SCP-7798 is theorized to be hostile to specifically human information and/or life.\n\n\nSCP-7798-2 seems to travel faster than light. SCP-7798-2 will enter the solar system in 2140s.\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC12-DATA5 \"Timeline of Events\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2040/6/5\n\n\nSCP-7798 article updated to unredact items and lower clearance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2042/3/8\n\n\nFoundation reveals the existence of SCP-7798 to all cooperative GOIs and proposes joint research and development projects to combat it. All GOIs agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2043/1/1\n\n\nLarge network of sub-veil forces sign the \"Arkhive\" Treaty, combining and integrating all affiliated GOIs\n5\n to better combat the threat of SCP-7798 and potential IT \"End of Information\" Scenario. The Foundation itself signed the treaty as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2050/2/3\n\n\nDEEPWELL efficiency reaches satisfactory levels to fully store all Foundation documents.

SCP-7798 is reclassified as Apollyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2051/8/4\n\n\nDue to SCP-7798-2's proximity to Earth, exponential increase of data losses, and exponential increase of memory loss, information suppression becomes financially debilitating. Proposals to drop the veil are heavily debated in Arkhive meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2053/2/4\n\n\nFinal anomalous warning systems warn of SCP-7798's coming peak and SCP-7798-2 arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2053/8/19\n\n\nDespite numerous precautions both anomalous and mundane, SCP-7798 affects O5-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2054/1/2\n\n\nFirst recorded instance of SCP-7798 affecting memory to such a degree that an individual enters a coma-like state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2054/11/12\n\n\nIt is found that near-constant recitation, particularly in synchronization in large groups, helps mitigate the effects of SCP-7798. Hume levels confirm this as anomalous. Recitation is near-immediately adopted across all Arkhive GoIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2057/11/12\n\n\nIt is estimated that all non-veil involved humans have been affected in some degree by SCP-7798\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2058/3/1\n\n\nSCP-7798-2 increases speed. New estimated entrance into the solar system: 2081/5/9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2058/6/2\n\n\nAfter 3 months of intense debate, an insubordinate faction within the Global Occult Coalition attempts to coup GOC leadership. Though unsuccessful, tensions within Arkhive grows to unprecedented levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2060/8/16\n\n\nThe Global Occult Coalition falls into civil war due to an even larger insubordinate faction. Hostilities erupt between Arkhive members over which faction to support. O5-3 assassinated. Veil protecting operations slow down as major resources are directed towards defense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2060/8/20\n\n\nArkhive dissolves, most GOIs return to independent operation. A new alliance called the Holy Occult (Consisting of the Sarkic Cults, the Church of the Broken God, and the Horizon Initiative) is formed. Sporadic skirmishes between GOIs erupts. Foundation maintains isolation at this time, prioritizing self defense and anti SCP-7798 development. Veil maintenance fully halts at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2061/3/2\n\n\nDue to prolonged hostilities and lack of veil maintenance across all major GOIs, public awareness of the anomalous reaches all time high.

Noospheric imaging indicates that the information lost from SCP-7798-1 instances go towards SCP-7798-2 at a faster-than-noospheric-light speed.\n\n\nInformation lost as a result of SCP-7798 is always related to humanity in some fashion, whether it describes a man-made object or describes people/personified objects in a narrative. SCP-7798 also never affects information pertaining to natural phenomena. Due to these facts, SCP-7798 is theorized to be hostile to specifically human information and/or life.\n\n\nSCP-7798-2 \ntravels\n faster than light. SCP-7798-2 will enter the solar system \non 2081/5/9, and reach its nearest approach to earth on 2081/9/2\n\n\n\n\nACO-7798-RELIC12-DATA7 \"Continued Timeline\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2061/8/30\n\n\nO5 Council approves use of anomalous means to attempt termination of SCP-7798-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2063/8/30\n\n\nAll humans, including the O5 Council, have been effected in some degree by SCP-7798. The majority of humanity is in moderate stages of being affected by SCP-7798.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2065/8/30\n\n\nGovernments begin to collapse. Groups whose leadership utilize anomalous means to preserve mental faculties become the dominant political organization. The Foundation is one such organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2066/1/23\n\n\nA new treaty is signed between GOIs, ending hostilities and reviving the Arkhive alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2068/6/3\n\n\nEarth begins to feel the gravitational pull of SCP-7798-2. No minor cases of SCP-7798 exist, all cases are either moderate or severe. SCP-7798-2 speeds up. New estimated entrance into the solar system: 2078/2/9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2072/6/3\n\n\nFaction consisting mainly of thaumatugic humanoids begins evacuation to the Foundation's off-world facilities on the Moon and Mars with the help of O5-1 and O5-13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2072/7/3\n\n\nDue to gross misappropriation of Foundation resources, O5-1 and O5-13 are declared enemies of the Foundation, along with all affiliated thaumaturges. O5-13 successfully apprehended and terminated publicly. O5-1 manages to escape to the Moon. Foundation control over off-world sites are lost. The Moon and Mars are declared enemies of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2073/5/3\n\n\nMCD Ltd. ceases all activity, the first major GOI believed to do so. Leaders are presumed dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2075/8/3\n\n\nMajority of Sarkic cults commit mass suicide on this date. Global Occult Coalition, Church of the Broken God, and Chaos Insurgency have ceased all activity by this point. Leaders presumed dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2077/3/16\n\n\nO5-4, the last conscious O5 not an an enemy of the Foundation, pronounced brain dead. Ethics committee officially dissolves the O5 council, taking full control of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/1/12\n\n\nFinal termination attempts on SCP-7798 and SCP-7798-2 occur. Failures. Final entries by humans into Foundation DEEPWELL servers occur, mainly information about culture and history. All information after this point is gathered by foundation robotic AIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/2/2\n\n\nVital signs return negative for the final Ethics committee member. council.aic activates in standard server and is immediately subject to SCP-7798. council.aic reactivates within DEEPWELL servers, specifically DEEPWELL1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/2/9\n\n\nSCP-7798 enters the solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/2/18\n\n\nMars and the Moon simultaneously disappear from robotic sensors. Remaining sensors are then subject to SCP-7798 and deactivate 30 minutes later. DEEPWELL facilities hold the sum total of all human knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/3/12\n\n\nDEEPWELL sensors indicate that SCP-7798-2's gravitational pull begins to tear Earth apart. Each and every DEEPWELL facility is not expected to survive closest approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/4/30\n\n\nDEEPWELL facility 043 coordinate sensors indicate that it has split off from the rest of earth. Such fidnings become commonplace in the following weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\n\n\nSCP-7798-2 enters closest approach this day.

All information from here on is exclusive to DEEPWELL1 internal sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\u00a017:40:43\n\n\nDEEPWELL1 internal temperature reaches 220 degrees C, just below acceptable range for DEEPWELL facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\u00a018:10:43\n\n\nDEEPWELL1 external heat shield fails in one region. Hole burns into internals and exposes internals to the effects of SCP-7798.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\u00a018:13:20\n\n\nEntire hole is burned through server which covered compromised area. Visual contact is made outside. There are no stars, only SCP-7798-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\u00a018:13:25\n\n\nHole is patched. Temperature stabilizes. 30 Petabytes of information was lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2078/5/13\u00a018:40:30\n\n\nExtreme gravity shifts.

DEEPWELL1 now orbits the sun at 0.8034 orbits per year. Timeline shall zoom out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2108/5/13\n\n\nExactly 30 years since stabilization of condition. DEEPWELL1 initiates CRACK sequence. Sensors investigate surrounding area and evaluate condition of SCP-7798 and related items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2108/6/13\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7798 no longer present. SCP-7798-2 is 50 light years away, and is now siphoning information from planet Kepler-452b. Earth is reduced to asteroid belt. DEEPWELL1 was the only DEEPWELL facility to survive closest approach with SCP-7798-2.\n\n\ncouncil.aic declares SCP-7798 neutralized. Celebration sequence is initiated; all capable drones play music. Afterwards, DEEPWELL network and council.aic awaits orders from the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2156/8/19\n\n\nArchives are accessed. Over the course of 4 months, copies are made of every file. 12 Terabytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2247/2/15\n\n\nSystems begin to shut down due to deterioration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2258/6/15\n\n\nPower generation systems shut down due to deterioration.

The creature traveled beyond light speed, making its appearance rapid and disruptive if not tracked. In addition, it derived its nutrition through siphoning intelligent information. Evacuation efforts, as well as leaving enough junk information to satisfy it, was very costly.\n\n\nOn Cycle 4118, Orbit 678, Division 76\n6\n ACO-77B8-PF was found dead after a period of stagnancy raised suspicion. Cause of death was found to be complete cessation of KGT Process, rendering ACO-77B8-PF to reveal its true form as a rocky planet.
