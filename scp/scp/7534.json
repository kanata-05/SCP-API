SCP-7534 is to be given a regular meal every day\n1\n. SCP-7534's interactions with Foundation Staff remain limited.\n\n\nSCP-7534 is authorized to accept SCP-7534-2 and activate SCP-7534-3 instances; however, subject is to report the contents of the topic being told on each SCP-7534-3 instance.\n\n\nSCP-7534 was isolated from 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W\n2\n. Site-68e could have left SCP-7534 uncontained; however, Site-68e decided to captivate SCP-7534 due to mundane reasons\n3\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7534 is Adrian Belcher, a 22-year-old Caucasian male of American descent. SCP-7534 possesses dark hair and green eyes. SCP-7534 was captivated by Site-68e on February 21, 2017.\n\n\nSCP-7534 claims to have been isolated from his family ever since his birth. SCP-7534 claims to have traveled 200 miles in search of its family. SCP-7534 suggests that its family is within, adjacent, or residing in 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W.\n\n\nSCP-7534-2 instances generate throughout areas SCP-7534 is adjacent to. SCP-7534-2 resembles a package containing a note stating that it is intentionally for SCP-7534\n4\n. SCP-7534-2 instances contain Sony Cassette Tapes, designated SCP-7534-3.\n\n\nAddendum 7534-a1:\n SCP-7534 possesses the capability of activating SCP-7534-3 instances, while other individuals remain incapable of activating such instances. SCP-7534 reports that SCP-7534-3 instances depict four voices of elderly and young individuals when activated, which it suggests that it is its family.\n\n\nDue to the beliefs of SCP-7534, it left its adoptive parents and roamed a colossal region of New York City in aid of the recovery of its family. SCP-7534 has been receiving SCP-7534-2 instances prior to captivation.\n\n\nAddendum 7534-a2:\n SCP-7534 was sent to an orphanage after two Belgian explorers discovered the subject inside a cabin in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Forest, New York City. SCP-7534 was adopted by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Belcher and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Belcher on March 17, 2004, and given the name \"Adrian Belcher\".\n\n\nOn May 3, 2007, SCP-7534 abandoned its adoptive parents and explored a colossal region of New York City due to DNA test results and the presence of SCP-7534-3 instances. Despite the efforts of SCP-7534, SCP-7534 has never relocated its family. SCP-7534 believes that its family is roaming adjacent to 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W.\n\n\nAddendum 7534-a3:\n The SCP-7534-3 instances observed by Dr. Olin\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a07534-3-5\u00a0Audio\u00a0Dialog\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTape Number:\n 7534-3-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7534-3-5\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-7534 authorized Dr. Olin to observe it while observing a one minute SCP-7534-3-5 cassette tape.

Anyway, I will make sure that you get out of that place so you can come to us again.\"\n\n\nSCP-7534 seemed curious and confused\n\n\n\"Okay listen.

Dr. Fifi Delina was granted 20 minutes to interview SCP-7534.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Good afternoon, uh\u2026 What do you want me to identify you as?\n\n\nSCP-7534 looks up at her\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Uh yeah, whatever.\n\n\nSCP-7534 looks down again and plays its Nintendo Switch\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Adrian Belcher, I want you to take this seriously, otherwise, I will be forced to confiscate that item.\n\n\nSCP-7534 screams\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Yeah, give me a sec!\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n \nADRIAN.\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n My bad. Why am I here?\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n I conducted a 20 minute conversation with you, and I would like to use this time at its fullest potential. How shall we begin?\n\n\nSCP-7534 widens its eyes\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n I don't know. You are the Einstein here, not me.\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n We'll start an introduction, then. Greetings, Adrian Belcher, I am Fifi Delina, but you may call me \"Lina\" for short because I am used to it. Please tell me some necessary information so I will know how to communicate with you.\n\n\nSCP-7534 sighs\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Hello, Lina, I am Adrian. I am 22 years old and I usually like to talk to chill people. I like playing games, especially Chess and RPG genre.\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n I see. Note that I may be \nstrict\n with the actions of my interviewees. Alright, Belcher. My first question is how are you feeling here? Are there any requests or suggestions I need to know?\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Okay, first of all, I am \nNOT\n a Belcher. They horrible pigs!\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Okay. How are you feeling here, Adrian?\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Eh, it's chill. I don't really care about how the place looks, tho. Just keep a Nintendo Switch glued to my hand and I'm fine.\n\n\nDr. Lina smiles\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Okay. I was expecting you to\u2026 Complain a lot but, I guess you're not that type of guy. Anyway. Why did you leave your parents in the first place?\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Didn't the staff here look into my files and history before you captivated me?\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n MTF-Units did; however, if I'm not wrong, our agents stated that the record relevant to your escape was missing. So, here I am asking this.\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Ah, I see. Well, the simplest explanation for why I abandoned those bitches was because we took a DNA test in school and my DNA did not match with my former parents'. Because of that, I made the hardest decision to abandon them and start a search for my family. By myself.\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Did those cassette tapes also force you to leave?\n\n\nSCP-7534 pauses\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Yeah. Speaking of those tapes, I noticed something very\u2026 odd\u2026\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n You may continue. I'm listening.\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Remember that road? That road where I suggested my family was in?\n\n\nDr. Lina leans in her chair, she nods\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n I was so tired and shit, so I decided to rest on that road. When I woke up, there was another mysterious package right next to me.\n\n\nDr. Lina nods\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n And as usual, there is a cassette tape, which you identify as S-C-P seven-five-three-four. I played the cassette tape with the player I brought, and I heard those voices again. Those voices said stuff like \"You're Close To Us\", \"Don't Give Up, You'll Get To Us\", \"We're Excited To Meet You\", and the like.\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n You mean to say that in 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W, your \nparents\n sent you an audio tape in which they say they're there?\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n Exactly! But, there was one problem. After I listened to that tape, I got too excited and decided to search that whole area. There were no signs of them. I don't even know if they exist\u2026\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Our agents actually searched that whole region. There were no signs of your family. In fact, that area is too warm to sustain life. So, if your parents are really there, they would or already have passed away because of heat.\n\n\nSCP-7534:\n It makes sense, I guess. I just really want to see them again. I have never met them ever since I was born. I don't know why they had to let me go like that.\n\n\nDr. Fifi Delina:\n Alright, Adrian. I think the time is up. We can-\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7534 seemed confident while communicating with Dr. Fifi Delina, although it lost focus on some questions. MTF Gamma-5 (\u201cRed Herrings\u201d) was re-deployed to 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W to search SCP-7534's family; however, agents concluded that its family is absent or non-existent.

Dr. Fifi Delina: I conducted a 20 minute conversation with you, and I would like to use this time at its fullest potential. How shall we begin? SCP-7534 widens its eyes SCP-7534: I don't know. You are the Einstein here, not me. Dr. Fifi Delina: We'll start an introduction, then. Greetings, Adrian Belcher, I am Fifi Delina, but you may call me \"Lina\" for short because I am used to it. Please tell me some necessary information so I will know how to communicate with you. SCP-7534 sighs SCP-7534: Hello, Lina, I am Adrian. I am 22 years old and I usually like to talk to chill people. I like playing games, especially Chess and RPG genre. Dr. Fifi Delina: I see. Note that I may be strict with the actions of my interviewees. Alright, Belcher. My first question is how are you feeling here? Are there any requests or suggestions I need to know? SCP-7534: Okay, first of all, I am NOT a Belcher. They horrible pigs! Dr. Fifi Delina: Okay. How are you feeling here, Adrian? SCP-7534: Eh, it's chill. I don't really care about how the place looks, tho. Just keep a Nintendo Switch glued to my hand and I'm fine. Dr. Lina smiles Dr. Fifi Delina: Okay. I was expecting you to\u2026 Complain a lot but, I guess you're not that type of guy. Anyway. Why did you leave your parents in the first place? SCP-7534: Didn't the staff here look into my files and history before you captivated me? Dr. Fifi Delina: MTF-Units did; however, if I'm not wrong, our agents stated that the record relevant to your escape was missing. So, here I am asking this. SCP-7534: Ah, I see. Well, the simplest explanation for why I abandoned those bitches was because we took a DNA test in school and my DNA did not match with my former parents'. Because of that, I made the hardest decision to abandon them and start a search for my family. By myself. Dr. Fifi Delina: Did those cassette tapes also force you to leave? SCP-7534 pauses SCP-7534: Yeah. Speaking of those tapes, I noticed something very\u2026 odd\u2026 Dr. Fifi Delina: You may continue. I'm listening. SCP-7534: Remember that road? That road where I suggested my family was in? Dr. Lina leans in her chair, she nods SCP-7534: I was so tired and shit, so I decided to rest on that road. When I woke up, there was another mysterious package right next to me. Dr. Lina nods SCP-7534: And as usual, there is a cassette tape, which you identify as S-C-P seven-five-three-four. I played the cassette tape with the player I brought, and I heard those voices again. Those voices said stuff like \"You're Close To Us\", \"Don't Give Up, You'll Get To Us\", \"We're Excited To Meet You\", and the like. Dr. Fifi Delina: You mean to say that in 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W, your parents sent you an audio tape in which they say they're there? SCP-7534: Exactly! But, there was one problem. After I listened to that tape, I got too excited and decided to search that whole area. There were no signs of them. I don't even know if they exist\u2026 Dr. Fifi Delina: Our agents actually searched that whole region. There were no signs of your family. In fact, that area is too warm to sustain life. So, if your parents are really there, they would or already have passed away because of heat. SCP-7534: It makes sense, I guess. I just really want to see them again. I have never met them ever since I was born. I don't know why they had to let me go like that. Dr. Fifi Delina: Alright, Adrian. I think the time is up. We can- <END LOG> SCP-7534 seemed confident while communicating with Dr. Fifi Delina, although it lost focus on some questions. MTF Gamma-5 (\u201cRed Herrings\u201d) was re-deployed to 39.272838\u00b0N 96.580745\u00b0W to search SCP-7534's family; however, agents concluded that its family is absent or non-existent. Foundation Researchers established multiple theories.",
