No audio recording or measuring device has been found in the circuitry of SCP-3967. SCP-3967 does not contain internal sensors, nor does it appear to have any means of collecting external data for analysis. The origins of these capabilities are unclear.\n\n\nSCP-3967 provides responses in the form of answers printed on 15\u00a0cm x 20\u00a0cm card stock, deposited in a receptacle located on the outside of the unit casing. Response cards provided by SCP-3967 have not been observed to have any compulsive or memetic effect. All responses received since containment have been in the form of impersonal commands, and have not included either first or second person pronouns.\n\n\nSCP-3967 was discovered in a dedicated room in the main building of the New Sunshine Commune, a community of 157 persons established in Pollensbee, CA, in 1968. During containment, it was determined that SCP-3967 was powered by a generator that had been modified to run on flax seed oil.\n\n\nAccording to log sheets, between 1968 and 1971, SCP-3967 was operated by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Addison and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Moonbeam (n\u00e9e Burnley), two members of the New Sunshine Commune.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3967\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Window\n\n\n\n\nOn 27/01/1971 Pollensbee police officers \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 responded to complaints of foul smells and large numbers of feral dogs coming from the New Sunshine Commune. The compound of the group consisted of 5 communal living buildings (including 2 geodesic domes), 4 barns; 1 common area, including a kitchen, dining room, and stage; and assorted smaller buildings. Upon arrival, officers found the front door of the common room building open.\n\n\nOfficers reported that several feral dogs were present in the landing, all moving to or from the building's common room. Upon entering the common room, officers found the bodies of 48 members of the Commune. All bodies bore signs of extreme hand-to-hand violence, with trauma exacerbated by feral dogs feeding on the remains. 10 bodies were killed in what appeared to have been a ritualistic fashion. According to post-mortem analysis, individuals had been deceased less than one week.\n\n\nUpon discovery of the 48 unburied bodies, Foundation agents were dispatched to oversee the investigation, with Officers \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 being administered a class-H amnestic.\n\n\nOver the next four weeks, the bodies of all members of the Commune were located on or around the primary building. The most common causes of death were starvation or malnutrition (87 instances) and violence (56 instances), with remaining causes of death unverifiable, due to cremation of remains.\n\n\nMost of the bodies on the property of the Commune had been buried, with 13 being cremated and identified through dental records. Exactly two hundred feet south of the altar, the bodies of 38 members of the Commune were found in a mass grave. Analysis indicated that all died or were in the process of dying of malnutrition when buried.\n\n\nIn the center of the southernmost geosdisic dome on the compound, officers found a large altar constructed from wood, wire, flax, and bone of human and animal origin. The altarpiece was covered in a thick layer of ash, later determined to be burnt books from the compound's library.\n\n\nThe library itself contained only four books: \nSiddhartha\n by Herman Hesse, \nOn The Road\n by Jack Kerouac, \nThe Bloodstream Sermon\n (attrib. Bodhidharma), and \nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\n by Ken Kesey. The text of all four books had been significantly revised by unknown means to include first person interludes.\n\n\nAll beds in the living quarters of the Commune were discovered to have been torn apart, with springs and cotton being repurposed for the creation of small images of SCP-3967. Foundation agents found over 18,000 such images of varying size during the search of the compound.\n\n\nAt the time of discovery, all agricultural activity on the Commune was directed towards the production of flax. All food storage areas contained over 900\u00a0kg of flax seed, but no other foodstuffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a03967-O-893-L:\u00a0Collected\u00a0letters\u00a0of\u00a0Thomas\u00a0\"Woody\"\u00a0de\u00a0Boer\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0window\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the New Sunlight Commune frequently sent letters to Mother Earth Journal, a counterculture hybrid magazine and catalog popular which frequently printed letters and correspondence between subscribers. However, by the end of 1968, the majority of communards had ceased correspondence, both with the Mother Earth Journal and the outside world at large. The sole member of the commune who continued to write was Thomas de Boer, who joined in late summer 1968.\n\n\nde Boer's correspondence with the Journal appeared in an estimated 75,000 printed issues of the Mother Earth Journal prior to his disappearance, during which time the Foundation was not aware of any anomalous activity associated with SCP-3967 or the New Sunshine Commune. Upon discovery of SCP-3967, and its connection with de Boer's letters, it was determined that seizure of all existing copies of the Mother Earth Journal mentioning SCP-3967 would be both logistically and financially impossible. Instead, Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was assigned the task of maintaining correspondence under the guise as de Boer to allay any suspicions regarding the New Sunshine Commune and the fate of its members. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 maintained correspondence as de Boer for nine months, ceasing with the closure of the Mother Earth Journal in January, 1972.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19/08/1968\n\n\nRecipient:\n Mother Earth Journal\n\n\nText:\n Greetings, friends, colleagues and fellow wanderers,\n\n\nFor those of you who still make the choice to live in the city, in systems that binds and destroy you, I bring good news from the other side!
