Personnel stationed on the outside of this zone are to monitor SCP-1362-1's daily movements and any changes to the smoke they produce. Security personnel are to turn back any trespassers, and signs warning of land mines have been placed in a 3 kilometer radius around SCP-1362.\n\n\nFoundation personnel are to suppress any reports of SCP-1362's smoke signals, and disseminate rumors of amateur survivalists creating the signals to local populations. Any subjects viewing SCP-1362 phenomenon are to be detained, interviewed, issued Class-C amnestics, and released to their homes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1362 designates a 500 square meter area within Greenland. A cube composed of graphite, measuring 12cm x 12cm x 12cm, is located at the center of SCP-1362. A small circle is engraved into the top of this cube.\n\n\nSCP-1362-1 designates 6 humanoid figures which manifest within SCP-1362. Instances of SCP-1362-1 are 1.6 meters tall and weigh 72 kilograms. They are each dressed in a black shirt, pants, and sandals, with no visible branding or other identifying marks. The upper body of all SCP-1362-1 instances constantly produce a thick, black smoke, which obscures their faces and upper torsos.\n\n\nWhen active, instances of SCP-1362-1 will attempt to signal any transportation it can view, waving to any incoming Foundation vehicles or personnel stationed around its containment area. In addition to waving, instances of SCP-1362-1 will stick thumbs out, whistle, and attempt to block the vehicle from exiting by surrounding it. SCP-1362-1 instances will not exit their containment area to pursue these vehicles.\n\n\nWhen no vehicles are present outside of the containment zone, instances of SCP-1362-1 will slowly walk along the perimeter or interior of SCP-1362, making notes of the surrounding area. Each instance categorizes different information about the surrounding topography. Once every 24 hours, all instances will gather at the granite rock within SCP-1362, and send a string of smoke signals shaped like English characters into the air, forming messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-A\n\n\nSCP-1362-A will slowly walk along the perimeter of SCP-1362, transmitting smoke signals that transcribe to observations in English about its surroundings and producing a significantly smaller amount of non-communicative smoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-B\n\n\nRolls along the ground within SCP-1362, reporting the composition of the topsoil, the rate of decomposition from any organic matter beneath the soil, and the rate of continental drift experienced by Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-C\n\n\nWill comment on the quality and makeup of the atmosphere within SCP-1362, and any notable changes to its makeup. SCP-1362-C will note any unusual gases it encounters, and give personalized names to unusual pockets of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-D\n\n\nSCP-1362-D is completely silent, but reacts to any persistent or unusual sound which is produced within or outside SCP-1362. Appears to be attracted to loud, sudden noises more than persistent wildlife, and has become less reactive to expected noises as SCP-1362 has been in containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-E\n\n\nConsumes the soil, plant life, and any edible non-organics which enter SCP-1362, commenting on their texture and nutritional value, and speculating on how it could be used if cooked or baked. If consuming hazardous material, SCP-1362-E will comment on its symptoms and any unusual feelings it experiences. If consuming a fatally hazardous material, SCP-1362-E will suddenly excrete all hazardous material from an orifice instead of dying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1362-F\n\n\nSpeculates on possibilities of sudden weather conditions, prehistoric life suddenly emerging from the woods surrounding SCP-1362, getting a ride to a new location, the earth beneath it being torn open causing SCP-1362 to fall into the earth's core, and other fantastic situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Log of smoke signals originating from within SCP-1362.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSignal:\n Initial: Cold barren trees.
