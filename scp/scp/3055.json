This cell is to be stocked with food and water rations, maintained by containment staff. Staff should monitor SCP-3055 to ensure that it is properly fed and hydrated.\n\n\nIf SCP-3055 becomes hostile, SCP-3055-1 through \n-7\n -8 are to be tranquilized. At least two of SCP-3055-1 through \n-7\n -8 will be unaffected by this action; this is to be expected, and the remaining members of SCP-3055 are to be placated as appropriate, with food, water, medicine, etc.\n\n\nUpdated Containment Procedures \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017:\n In order to prevent future Suggestion Events (see Incident Log 3055-a) a list of scene suggestions is to be frequently updated and kept on-site so that it can be accessed on short notice. At least two guards are to be stationed inside the containment chamber to provide suggestions whenever one is requested.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3055 is the collective designation for eight humans, dubbed SCP-3055-1 through -8. Of the eight, seven were formerly the members of Dan's Institute of Improvised Thespianry, an acting troupe specializing in improvisational comedy (improv), based out of the now-defunct \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Theater in New York City. SCP-3055-8 became a part of SCP-3055 after initial containment (see Incident Log 3055-a).\n\n\nStarting at some time in early 2016, it has been impossible for any member of SCP-3055 to enter or exit a building without being accompanied by the other seven individuals. Attempts to cause this to happen, both by SCP-3055 and others, have resulted in an unseen force blocking the door of the building in question.\n\n\nSCP-3055 is also unable to stop its ongoing set of scenes. Even when the group is moving, the scene continues while it is walking; dialogue has not been observed to cease for longer than two seconds. Efforts to force SCP-3055 to stop its scene have so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\nAll of SCP-3055-1 through -8 are either unable or unwilling to speak or communicate in any way besides the dialogue in the scene. This has largely impeded Foundation efforts to determine the origin of their condition, or potential treatments for it.\n\n\nDespite being in a constant state of improvisation, SCP-3055-1 through -8 still have the same basic physical needs as non-anomalous humans, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, and excreting waste. While in containment, they have developed a system of shifts, in which two or three of the actors carry on the scene while the others fulfill these needs. Those on the 'inactive' shift are still unable to independently enter or leave buildings, and generally do not divert their attention from the scene while they are awake.\n\n\nPeriodically, SCP-3055 asks for scene suggestions. It will typically accept the first word or phrase spoken after these requests, regardless of its semantic content. If no suggestion is given, other anomalous properties manifest; for an account of these, see Incident Log 3055-a.\n\n\nIt has been observed that members of SCP-3055 can expire and be anomalously reanimated shortly afterwards. It is believed that the members of SCP-3055 are still driven by human instinct to some degree, and take care of their physical needs in order to avoid discomfort, rather than needing to fulfill these needs to survive. Prior to containment, the original seven members of SCP-3055 resorted to increasingly desperate means to fulfill these physical needs, gaining significant notoriety in New York City as violent thieves.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a03055-1:\u00a0Surveillance\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a03055-1:\u00a0Surveillance\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of surveillance footage involving SCP-3055 at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a popular upscale restaurant.\n\n\n[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016\u00a019:15:04]\n\n\nSCP-3055 is seen walking through the door of the restaurant.\n\n\nMA\u00ceTRE D':\n Hello, do you have a reservation?\n\n\nSCP-3055-5:\n So, Mom, there's this boy I like\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3055-1:\n Oh?

Did you have a reservation?\n\n\nSCP-3055 continues to ignore the ma\u00eetre d' and proceeds through the dining area and toward the kitchen. All members of SCP-3055 except those active in the scene steal and eat food from the plates of customers.\n\n\nSCP-3055-5:\n He's totally dreamy.

I'm so totally psyched that we're dating now!\n\n\nMA\u00ceTRE D':\n I'm calling the police if you don't stop this right now! Are you insane?\n\n\nSCP-3055 enters the kitchen. At this point, ambient dialogue in the restaurant has ceased due to SCP-3055's odd behavior.\n\n\nSCP-3055-5:\n Hey, Steve, won't you sing me a song?\n\n\nSCP-3055-2:\n You know it, babe. \n[shouting]\n I need a suggestion!\n\n\nSOUS CHEF:\n Get out of my kitchen!\n\n\nSCP-3055-2 begins singing to SCP-3055-5, unaccompanied. The lyrics of its song are based on the sentence \"get out of my kitchen.\"\n\n\nThe ma\u00eetre d' begins using his cell phone to call the police. He exits the kitchen. All inactive members of SCP-3055 continue to steal and consume food and water from the kitchen.\n\n\nSCP-3055-2:\n \n[singing]\n That's what I want, that's what I need, get out of my kitchen, it's where I feed!\n\n\nThe sous chef and several other members of the kitchen staff begin to force SCP-3055 out of the kitchen. It initially attempts to fight, and SCP-3055-5 throws the sous chef backward with considerable force, concussing him. SCP-3055 then begins to flee the establishment.\n\n\nSCP-3055-5:\n Oh, Steve, you're so dreamy!\n\n\nSCP-3055-2:\n I know, babe, and you are, too.\n\n\nSCP-3055 exits the restaurant. At least two squad cars from the New York Police Department are visible outside.\n\n\n[END TRANSCRIPT \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016\u00a019:19:51]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a03055-2:\u00a0NYPD\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a03055-2:\u00a0NYPD\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a report filed by one of the police officers responding to the call placed by the ma\u00eetre d' of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n[BEGIN EXCERPT]\n\n\n\u2026at which point the seven suspects exited the restaurant through the front door.

After repeated orders to remain still and submit to arrest, these two suspects continued to act out the scene. Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I proceeded to their location with the intent of handcuffing them.\n\n\nThe five remained compliant, but the aforementioned two suspects resisted arrest.

She was crying.\n\n\nAt the police station, all of the other six suspects were standing outside, and officers were apparently unable to get them into the building.
