Pre-existing instances of SCP-893-X are housed in nurseries at Site-17. Any new instances of SCP-893-X are to be \nplaced into Foundation custody\n immediately terminated.\n\n\nTissue samples taken from SCP-893 should be contained within five minutes of extraction.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-893 is a 39-year-old Hispanic male who calls himself \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \nSubject is a balding, overweight male with green eyes.\n\n\nSCP-893-X was initially discovered by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shortly after having severed from SCP-893's fourth and fifth fingers on his right hand during a work related incident at a construction site. The subject claims to have brought the fingers back to his home and put them on ice, neglecting to visit a hospital due to \"personal reasons\". \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 observed his severed ring finger developing a clear fluid around its mass before taking on the form of what appeared to be a diminutive human fetus. Repeated testing and research have revealed that SCP-893's account is factual.\n\n\nSCP-893 exhibits very crude regenerative capabilities; Experiment Log: 893-452 is to be referenced for detailed information about the stumps.\n\n\nAny appendages or substantial amounts of living tissue liberated from SCP-893 undergo an accelerated process similar to clonal fragmentation. Smaller amounts of tissue produce less intelligent, shorter lived clones, while opposite results are achieved from larger amounts of tissue. These instances, henceforth referred to as SCP-893-X, on average, age and grow 20 times faster than a human being, and are usually all but completely consumed in cancerous tissue and deformed by the end of their extremely short life cycles. 893-X exhibit limited intelligence although many instances identify by SCP-893's name.\n\n\nAddendum 893-\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n 2805/1967\n\n\nResearch:\n Intelligence assessment.\n\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hello.

Them little blobby shits always scare the living fuck outta me, what was I supposed to do? I stomped both of them on my carpet, and when I saw the faces and eyes on my shoes I pissed on myself\u2026 every fucking time man! I still got my fingers. I don\u2019t know how but my ma says it's because we are all just tough.

There are depressions in some patches of skin that don't seem to be changing either. I understand the value of this resource, but I request that further sampling of SCP-893 bodily tissue cease, it's starting to look like a potato.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nRequest denied by Site Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Sites:\n \nSite-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-892\n | SCP-893 | \nSCP-894\n \u00bb",
