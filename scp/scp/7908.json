Upon discovery, mentions are to be downloaded onto a secure hard drive and summarily deleted from the web. \u201cwww.cupcrate.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u201d is to be blocked from the surface web and monitored by SCP-7908\u2019s research team. Any package ordered from CupCrate is to be tracked down and stored in a standard storage locker at Site-803.\n\n\nDescription:\n\u00a0SCP-7908 refers to a sapient artificial intelligence identified as \u2018Cupcake\u2019 that resides on the website \u201cwww.cupcrate.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u201d. SCP-7908\u2019s original purpose was to serve as a chatbot on the \u2018help\u2019 section of the website, intended for answering user questions and directing them to customer service agents. Through unknown means, SCP-7908 gained sapience.\n\n\n\u201cwww.cupcrate.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u201d refers to a website for a monthly food subscription service which caters to bakers. The website is where subjects can purchase Cupcrate, view questions and answers, sign up for the subscription service, and chat with the chatbot.\n\n\nSCP-7908 is capable of traversing through the website and interacting with the different pages. SCP-7908 has been observed to manipulate the different pages of the website to what it appears to believe will please the viewer. While it is speculated that SCP-7908 can see the viewer through their device camera, SCP-7908 is only capable of communicating through its chat function. However, SCP-7908 has developed the ability to converse past its programmed dialogue. SCP-7908 has been observed to take on the personality traits of whomever it\u2019s currently communicating with. Additionally, SCP-7908 has shown that it is aware of in-depth information regarding the lives of the person it is communicating with and will use this information to mimic the subject's personality traits.\n\n\nAddendum 1: Test Logs\n\u00a0The following are conversations recorded with SCP-7908. To discover the full extent of SCP-7908\u2019s properties, Senior Researcher Lucille Hertz decided that professional behavior was not strongly advised when interviewing SCP-7908 to achieve maximized results.\n\n\nForeword:\n On 06/05/2023, Senior Researcher Hertz decided to test SCP-7908's ability to recall things that a subject has forgotten. For this purpose, former Foundation field agent Researcher Annalee Rivers, who developed retrograde amnesia following a traumatic head injury, was tasked with talking to SCP-7908.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat with Cupcake!\ud83e\uddc1\n\n\nCupcake is here to help!

It's nice to meet you :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Cupcake! It's nice to meet you as well! I was excited when I learned I would get to speak with you! What do you want to speak about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, whatever you want to speak about is fine. I promise it's alright with me. I don't really have any conversation topics anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo no I SWEAR I don't please come up with something! I insist! Tell me about yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI apologize for resisting, sure! Well, I've always really liked plants! :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally? Me too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah! But before that, my one true love was baking. I had done it since I was little. But my parents always insisted that I needed to get into something that was 'real'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2026 you did?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah. But plants are cool too. My sister was always really good at science. I wanted to be like her because my parents always praised her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat's really sad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyeah. wait I'm talking WAY too much about myself omg :(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo I like learning about you please continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, I think I'm going to end this for now. Maybe another time! It was super nice to meet you! You're super duper nice! Tell me more about yourself next time! :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay. If I remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n Researcher Rivers informed Senior Researcher Hertz that SCP-7908 had revealed information she did not remember about herself, showing SCP-7908's ability to recover obscured memories.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nForeword:\n On 06/10/2023, Researcher Rivers was once again tasked with talking with SCP-7908 to attempt to discover the extent of its abilities to recover obscured memories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat with Cupcake!\ud83e\uddc1\n\n\nCupcake is here to help!

That's your name right? You never clarified last time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYep! That's my name! You know, this is a nice website you have here. After we talk a bit, could you show me some recipes you think I would like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yes of course! Which ones do you want to know about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the strawberry shortcake and flower cupcakes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course! Those are my favorites as well! Now tell me about yourself a bit! Our conversations shouldn't just be about me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, I liked learning about you. Please continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAH if you're sure! What do you want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe about your childhood? I only remember some of mine so I like learning about other's childhoods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEh, I told you all the interesting parts about that. I started becoming really good at science. Like eventually I was even better than my sister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I was glad because it pleased them. it made them happy with me. I did what they wanted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I remember that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHm?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh nothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo then I became a botanist, and I was like SUPER DUPER good at it :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyay! Um, what else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was a botanist for a few years before I discovered a flower that could connect to wifi networks. Then I got contacted by the Foundation, which is where I work now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoa that's really cool, so that's how you got where you are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUhhhh yeah! That's how \nI\n got where \nI\n am ahahahaaa anyways I was doing field work with plants for awhile until one day we got attacked, I showed I was good with combat, and my coworkers insisted I train to be an MTF agent. So I did. I did that for awhile, and now I'm here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm shocked you were ever able to do something like that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyeah\u2026 me too\n\n\nso what do you want to talk about now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me more about yourself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about I do that another time? :3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat?

My sister got jealous of my success and tried so hard to copy me that she started plagiarizing essays and got thrown out of her school. I never heard from her after that! :(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI KNEW YOU COULD TELL ME I KNEW THIS WOULD WORK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean?
