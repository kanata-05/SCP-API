Due to the fragile nature of the film material that makes up SCP-7246, standard nitrate-based film storage procedures are to be followed at all times. Likewise, SCP-7246 is only to be played once every 1-5 years in order to avoid unnecessary damage of its contents. Access and playback of SCP-7246 can only be performed at the discretion of the head researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7246 was a nitrate-based film dating back circa 1920 titled \u201cThe Hanging of the Emperor and the Death of His Prince\u201d. Its main plot concerns the death of \u201cThe Emperor of Alegannen\u201d and his \u201cCrown Prince\u201d, as well as the subsequent accession of \u201cThe Chancellor of Alegannen\u201d to the regency of the Empire (see Addendum 7246.1 for a full description of the film\u2019s plot).\n\n\nUpon discovery in 1965, similarities were found between the film and other material pertaining to the City of Alagadda. This prompted Foundation researchers to classify the anomaly as related material and mark it for transfer to Site-57. Unlike other materials of this type, however, SCP-7246 produces no harmful anomalous effects on its viewer. SCP-7246 also initially showed no anomalous effects upon its discovery. Its only extraordinary property was found 5 years later in 1970, when Head Researcher Cornwall discovered upon reviewing the footage that the events depicted within the film had inexplicably changed, with minor revisions being made to the film\u2019s plot (see Addendum 7246.2). This continued until a major change transpired in 1986 (see Addendum 7246.3), after which the anomaly was reclassified as neutralized.\n\n\nAddendum 7246.1:\n The following document details a written transcription of SCP-7246, as documented upon its first playback in 1965.\n\n\n\n\nBackground:\n SCP-7246, titled \u201cThe Hanging of the Emperor and the Death of His Prince\u201d, is a silent black-and-white film dating to approximately 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War. The film is in German, and is set in a German-adjacent fictional state called \u201cThe Empire of Alegannen\u201d. Costumes and props are consistent with motifs and styles popular in Germany during the early 20th century. The music used in the film dates to around the early 20th century, except for some classical pieces that date back as early as the 16th century. As of the time of writing, the origin of SCP-7246, as well as the identities of the actors seen within the film, are unknown.\n\n\nDue to the film\u2019s similarity to other material pertaining to Alagadda, the Foundation currently believes that the film\u2019s creation was at least partially inspired by the city or entities related to it. This can be seen in characters from the film having direct parallels to entities from Alagadda. Without any known reason, however, entities paralleling SCP-7246's \"The Prince of Alegannen\" or \"The Crucified Prince\" have never been mentioned so far in Alagadda-linked materials.\n\n\nAll of the film\u2019s text is in German, and has been translated for posterity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEmerging from a war with Adytum, the Empire of Alegannen is suffering.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film opens with a shot of a devastated land. Smoke billows in the distance. Several houses have been burnt down. People in a state of misery work the fields.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Emperor, long ruling over his subjects, is benevolent and kind. The state of his Empire disturbs him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[An aged Emperor sits upon his throne. His eyebrows are furrowed in guilt. He holds his head in his hand. In front of the throne\u2019s dais is an ornate table upon which sit six well-dressed men.]\n\n\n[Four of the men wear the same military uniform, with one wearing a deep black cape and a \npickelhaube\n1\n to distinguish him from the rest. Beside the four men is a tall Prince dressed in white. Next to the prince is a hunched and old Chancellor wearing a dark waistcoat. All of the nobles look to the Emperor with concern.]\n\n\n[The Emperor shakes his head, and looks to the nobles. He puts out his hand and opens his mouth to speak.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDearest nobles of the land\u2026 My Empire is in decline, and my subjects suffer. What may I do in order to help their miserable state?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The first to speak is the Chancellor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Majesty, there is none that we can do in the present that could completely remedy the loss that our subjects have suffered; Instead, what we could do for them is to remain patient, rule well, and in time they will prosper.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The noble wearing the \npickelhaube\n stands up. He begins to speak as well.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Grace, I respect the Chancellor\u2019s patience and his capacity for good counsel, but I and my fellow Dukes say that this is no time for dallying. What we must do is open the treasury, so that our subjects may freely benefit from our good graces.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The three other Dukes nod in agreement. The Emperor listens, and nods. He looks to the Prince and addresses him.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat of you, my son? What may you suggest to lift our subjects\u2019 spirits?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Prince looks deep in thought, but looks up as his father speaks to him. He stands up from his seat as he begins to address the Emperor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFather, while the Chancellor is wise to counsel patience, and the Duke of Black kind to counsel generosity, I say we take a middle ground. Before we open our treasury to our subjects, let us first take the time to hear out their concerns by speaking to them as a common man. Only then may we understand their struggles, and only then may we address the root of their difficulties.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor is seen slightly smiling as he hears this. The Duke of Black raises his eyebrows, then grins with delight. The Emperor looks at his son as he considers his words, then rises to his feet.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is decided then! I shall disguise myself and walk among my subjects as a common man. I shall hear out their complaints and understand their struggles. By the time I return to this palace, we shall reconvene to determine how best to address them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black rises from his seat. He wears an expression of concern.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Grace, what of your guards? The city is dark and dangerous, and many thieves could waylay your passage and bring harm to your person.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor shakes his head.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGuards would mark me out as a noble, to be feared rather than to be spoken to freely. I will eschew protection. My subjects are desperate, but they will not be so wretched as to kill a defenseless old man.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black bows his head. The Prince speaks next.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat of me, father? You know of my skill with pistol and blade. I will don a disguise with you, and defend you when you are at risk of harm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor shakes his head again.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are a good and brave Prince, and a dutiful son to his father. Alas, I cannot take you with me. Your status as a Prince marks you out as proud and of noble countenance, while I am old and tired. My subjects will not believe our disguises should you come with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Prince opens his mouth to speak again, but a raised hand from the Emperor silences him. The Emperor turns to his Chancellor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy dearest friend, send word to my servants. Tell them to bring me a wretched shirt and tattered trousers, so that I may wear it and walk among my subjects.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor nods.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour will be done, your Majesty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor nods to the Chancellor and turns to leave the room. All six nobles watch him as he leaves. The camera turns to follow him as he exits the council chamber.]\n\n\n[Then, a slow transition follows as the Emperor exits the Palace from a hidden door. He is wearing beggar\u2019s clothing, wrapping a simple, long, and dirty cloth to wrap around him.]\n\n\n[What follows is a short montage of the Emperor navigating the bowels of the capital city. He is seen talking to beggars, street children, and common laborers. Several passersby are seen pushing him out of the way as he walks through the streets.]\n\n\n[Eventually, he comes to a small nondescript public house and flags the barkeep for a cup of water. The barkeep looks at him and asks for one mark, but the Emperor is shocked to find that he does not have any. Angry, the barkeep tells him to leave.]\n\n\n[As the Emperor does so, he finds a private corner of the street and sits on the ground. People passing by step into a puddle on the street, which splatters dirty water on the disguised Emperor. The Emperor lays his head back on the wall, and sheds a tear.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh how wretched a life my subjects live! I have only spent a day among them, yet already I feel the volume of their suffering. Now I know of their struggles with bread and grain, and their incapability to find warm food and good lodging. When I return to the palace, I shall take great measures to address this in earnest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[As the Emperor sits in the corner, two men come to a stop in front of him. The Emperor looks up at them.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh take no pity on me, Sirs. I am simply taking a rest here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The two men look at each other, and smile maliciously at the Emperor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter, your Majesty. We have been told what you are, and we shall not hesitate to make the rest permanent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor\u2019s eyes widen in fear as the men seize him by his clothing and drag him off screen. The film fades to black.]\n\n\n[After a few seconds, the film opens on the Prince, who emerges from his bed with fear. He runs through the Palace halls to find the Chancellor, who is busy writing a letter in his room.]\n\n\n[The Prince expresses his worry for his father, and the Chancellor agrees. With two guards, they make their way out of the palace disguised as minor nobles. They both ride through the streets of the city, looking for the Emperor.]\n\n\n[Several shots follow of the Prince and the Chancellor wandering through the city, before they come upon a small congregation of people near the public house that the Emperor previously went to.]\n\n\n[As they approach, the Prince gets off his horse and pushes past the people in the crowd. His eyes widen in shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hanged Emperor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor\u2019s limp body is seen hanging from a pole high above the city. The film lingers on this shot for three minutes and 24 seconds. The film fades to black.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Prince and the Palace descended into grief for the death of the Emperor. The Prince was inconsolable, for it was by his suggestion that the Emperor went to his death.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEventually, the Prince received information of the culprit\u2019s hiding place. He resolved to avenge his father himself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film returns to the Palace to focus on the Prince. Bags are present underneath his eyes. He wears a military officer's uniform with a raised cap and is armed with a rifle. Several soldiers who are similarly armed follow him as he marches down the hallway.]\n\n\n[Eventually, the Prince stops as the silhouette of the Chancellor in front of him comes into view. The Chancellor bows his head. The Prince angrily speaks.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo not block my way. I have come to avenge my father on the assassins who murdered him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film pans to the Chancellor. He looks up with a concerned and fearful expression.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe information that you have received, Your Highness, may be false. For the assassins to hide in the sewers underneath the city after killing your father is suspicious and unnatural. Let me first investigate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Prince shakes his head.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. I trust the Dukes and their spies. They grieve my father as much as anyone else. Step aside, Chancellor. Prepare my father\u2019s funeral. When I return, I will have made sure that his death is avenged.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor stays frozen in place.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Prince, please. I plead for you to reconsider. This is foolish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Prince shakes his head again.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, it is not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Prince pushes the Chancellor aside. The soldiers behind him follow as he walks forward.]\n\n\n[In a similar shot to the Emperor exiting the Palace in disguise, the Prince and his soldiers leave by a side door and begin marching through the streets. Coming to a stairway, they descend into the lower parts of the capital, before arriving at a gated sewer entrance.]\n\n\n[Carefully, one of the Prince\u2019s soldiers uses a key to open the lock and open the sewer gates. The Prince goes inside, and his soldiers follow behind him.]\n\n\n[For a few minutes, the Prince and his soldiers are seen quickly moving through the sewers and wading through ankle-high sewer water. Eventually, they come to a stop outside the metal door of a large pumping room. The Prince and his soldiers quietly line themselves up along the wall surrounding the door. Looking to the soldier beside the door, the Prince nods to him to open it.]\n\n\n[The soldier nods back, and kicks in the door as he brandishes his rifle in front of him. The film focuses on the Prince as the soldier moves in, and then continues to follow him as he aims his rifle into the room.]\n\n\n[The pumping room is empty. The Prince looks on in horror as most of his soldiers move in to scan the room, overturning tables of equipment and tools in order to find signs of life. He opens his mouth to speak.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut our information\u2026 it was correct. Where are they?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Several flashes of light then emanate into the room as one of the two soldiers who were left outside quickly falls to the ground, dead. The other soldier looks at the Prince and shouts.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a trap, your Highness, a trap!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The soldier then looks to the ones still in the room and shouts to them.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProtect the Prince!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The soldiers in the room quickly run outside to fire back at the attackers, and the Prince runs out to see two more of them get shot and fall to the ground. The soldier who had been posted outside earlier quickly puts out a hand to shelter him, but the Prince instead freezes in place and looks back in horror at the soldiers who stayed behind.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I must stay behind!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[There are more gunshots as the soldiers fire back. The soldier close to the Prince looks to him and speaks.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou carry our hopes with you, Majesty! You are our Emperor now, and we are but your subjects!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The soldiers continue to fight back. The ensuing flashes from the gunshots light up the Prince\u2019s face.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was foolish- I was foolish!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Slinging his rifle around his shoulder, the Prince begins to flee. His steps are punctuated by more flashes of light as more of the soldiers die in the sewer. As he runs back to the sewer gate, he sees the silhouette of a lone hunched military officer with a \npickelhaube\n standing at the entrance. The Prince runs to the gate, and waves his arms in the air as he shouts.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOfficer, save my men! They are engaged in a fight with the Emperor\u2019s assassins!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[As the Prince closes the distance, he begins to slow down. The camera pans behind him to look at the officer at the gate.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou shall have to forgive me, my Prince. You were too quick to rush in.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The silhouette of the officer is seen raising his gun. He fires it several times, and the Prince falls.]\n\n\n[The film is black for several seconds.]\n\n\n[The camera then opens on the Chancellor, now riding through the streets in the same way that he had with the Prince. Unlike the last time, however, the Prince is conspicuously no longer beside him.]\n\n\n[The camera comes to a stop at the same time as the Chancellor. He moves down from his horse, and slowly walks forward. Tears are in his eyes as he shakes his head in defeat.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Prince, what did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[A shot is shown of the Prince\u2019s bloody feet, which have been nailed together on a single plank of wood. Drops of blood slowly drip down the Prince\u2019s ankle. As the camera slowly pans down, a puddle of blood is seen collecting at the bottom of the Prince\u2019s foot.]\n\n\n[The film fades to black once again. A title card is shown.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThus the line of the Emperor was extinguished, as the young Prince was murdered in the same way as his father. As the Empire suffered more and more, the Chancellor reluctantly took the reins.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, instead of declaring himself Emperor, he lamented the death of his sovereigns. Realizing that he could hold no candle to the majesty that had been extinguished from this world, he instead followed the law and took up the mantle of regent\u2013 until such a time as the Emperor or his Prince would return to them once again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the Dukes would not listen to him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The camera opens on the Chancellor in the council chamber, sitting on a smaller chair beside the empty throne. He presides over the table of the four Dukes, who each possess an expression of discontent. One of the Dukes rises from his seat.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Emperor and his heir are dead under your watch. Why must we follow you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Another of the Dukes, who is wearing a pure white military uniform, also rises from his seat.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree days have passed, and there is no clue as to who killed both the Emperor and the Prince. Their bodies have been disrespected with no show of deference, and yet we stand here with no resolution on what is next!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[A third Duke rises.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou may be regent now, as is the law of the land, but our Empire is meant to be ruled by an Emperor. Declare a council to decide the succession, or we shall put one of our own on the throne for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor puts his hand out to calm the Dukes.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, my lords! The Emperor and the Prince are not yet cold in their coffins, and yet we stand in discord and disunity! Let us at least first accord the sovereigns with honors befitting their station before we descend into chaos. The funeral is already tomorrow!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke in white raises a hand in protest.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems you are delaying the inevitable, lord Regent. Your age seems to be hobbling you from carrying out your given task.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The first Duke shouts.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou always were too patient, lord Regent! Instead of following the advice of the Duke of Black, our Emperor was led astray by you and his Prince. If I were a betting man, I would say that you led them to their deaths on purpose.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The third Duke speaks again to regard the other Dukes.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI say we wait until after the funeral, lords. After then, we shall decide who will replace our fatuous Regent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor\u2019s face shifts to an expression of shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy lord Dukes, that would be against the rules of the land!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke in white scoffs.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo is treason, correct? You were the one who led the Prince astray, I know it. You were the one who bade him to go to the sewers to his death.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor coughs, then looks at them all.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the Prince said the information of the assassins\u2019 location came from all of you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Dukes fall silent. They furrow their eyebrows in suspicion. The first Duke speaks.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was no information that came from us. The Prince went of his own accord.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor shakes his head urgently.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, that is not true! The Prince said that\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The camera quickly shows a shot of a fist banging on the table. The Chancellor and the three Dukes look at the source of the noise.]\n\n\n[The Duke of Black, who had previously been silent, shakes his head in disgust.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou lie\u2026 Chancellor. You lie to save your own skin. The Duke of Red is right. It was only you who counseled the Emperor to patience, and thereby influenced the Prince to suggest he walk among his subjects. It was only you who was close to the Prince when the Emperor died. None of us were in Alegannen when our sovereigns were murdered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black looks to the third Duke.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI agree with the Duke of Yellow. We wait until after we give deference at the funeral, when the clock ticks at nine in the evening. Then, we shall decide if you truly are guilty. Then, we shall decide who shall be our new Emperor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black scoffs.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUnless, of course, the old Emperor rises from his grave. Or the Prince.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Pushing off the table, the Duke of Black rises to his feet and leaves the room. The other Dukes follow suit and leave the room as well.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor falls to the ground. He holds his head in his hands.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my Emperor\u2026 what shall I do now?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film fades to black. A title card is shown on screen.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so the night passed, and gave way to day, then night again. Not a soul saw head or tail of the Chancellor since the day of the council meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the fourth hour of the afternoon, the servants set out to prepare the funeral.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the eighth hour, the Chancellor sends the command to begin admitting the noble visitors into the throne room for the funeral. He does not emerge from his chambers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree of the Dukes arrive piecemeal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Duke of Black is absent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film opens to a busy scene, as many well-dressed funeral goers populate the entire length of the throne room. Raised on the dais are the plinths upon which the coffins of the Emperor and the Prince sit. Behind them is the empty throne of the Emperor.]\n\n\n[Funeral goers are seen whispering amongst themselves. Servants distribute food and drinks on plates.]\n\n\n[The three Dukes gather at one corner of the gathering. The Duke of Yellow is the first to speak.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the eighth hour, and yet the Chancellor- and regent- is absent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Red crosses his arms.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe the traitor has ran for his life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of White smirks.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf he has, then he has shown his true character. He has dishonored the Emperor he claimed he loved so dearly, and has left the throne vacant as a result.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Red laughs.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWas I not right when I claimed he was a traitor? Once I set my men on him, he will have nowhere to hide.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Yellow purses his lips.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet my lords\u2026 am I not the only one who notices the absence of the Duke of Black?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Red regards the Duke of Yellow. He chuckles again.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKnowing that man\u2019s dour bearing, he is likely to still be brooding in his keep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of White visibly laughs, then turns around in the direction of the dais. As the camera pans to his face, an expression of shock can be seen.]\n\n\n[The two other Dukes turn in the direction that he is looking in. As they do so, their expressions also turn to shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chancellor of Alegannen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The camera pans to the Chancellor, now wearing a Baroque Venetian-style mask with a happy expression. Blood drips from the surroundings of the mask, staining the Chancellor\u2019s clothes. Two bloodshot eyes look from behind the mask.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo all those who see my appearance now\u2026 be not afraid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The camera pans to the blood dripping from the mask and onto puddles on the floor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the expression that I have always wished to wear for our Emperor. For our Prince. Instead of joy, however, I have realized that I have brought nothing but shame and weakness. My old face is no more. I have carved it away. This mask is my face now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor attempts to smile behind his mask. Blood flows even more freely from behind it.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor this day\u2026 we honor the life of our Emperor. And we must not wear expressions that are dour- no! Instead, we must smile. We must rejoice. We must celebrate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor walks to the Emperor\u2019s coffin and embraces it. Blood from his hands stains the white ivory surface of the coffin.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we lay a thousand year dynasty to rest. A dynasty that sacked Adytum and massacred the Daeva. A dynasty that built an empire of art and science. A dynasty that deserves to be remembered in the most spectacular way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor brings his face down to the surface of the Emperor\u2019s coffin in order to kiss it. Blood is seen trickling from the eye holes as well as the surroundings of the mask and onto the glass surface of the coffin.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd an Emperor who cared for all of us, but was killed\u2026 because I failed to stop it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor kisses the surface of the Emperor\u2019s coffin through the mask. More blood smears the glass.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cForgive me, my Emperor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[As the Chancellor continues to kiss the Emperor\u2019s coffin, the film changes to show a wide shot of the stairway leading up to the throne room. The Duke of Black walks up the stairs, followed by dozens of soldiers. As he reaches the top of the stairs, he pushes the doors to the throne room open with a grand gesture.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStop this insolence at once!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor immediately raises his head from the Emperor\u2019s coffin. He looks in the direction of the door, his eyes behind the mask wide with shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is\u2026 what is the meaning of this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black is wearing full military uniform and holds a pistol in his hand. He smirks, slightly.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting an end to your treason.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The shot pans to the other three Dukes, who are shocked as well. The Duke of Yellow speaks up.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Duke of Black\u2026 you commit treason yourself! You are bringing an army to the Emperor\u2019s throne room! And on the eve of the funeral held to honor him!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black turns a gun to the Duke of Yellow. The Duke\u2019s eyes widen with fear.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe old Emperor was a weak-willed sovereign, barely deserving of the name. It is only fitting that he died in the time that he did, before Adytum invaded again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Yellow cries out.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut this\u2026 this is still treason! Follow what we planned, my dear lord. Reserve your fire for when the time is truly at hand!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor goes down a step from the dais. His expression betrays fear.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor\u2019s eyes open in realization.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has been planning this from the start. He is the one who knew that the Emperor would be unguarded. He is the one among the Dukes who lured the Prince to his death!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Yellow takes a step back in shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is right!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black furrows his eyebrows in slight puzzlement, then grits his teeth.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt does not matter now!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[A flash lights up the throne room as the Duke of Black fires his gun at the Duke of Yellow. The Duke of Yellow falls to the ground, and blood splatters the faces of the two Dukes near him. Everyone around the Duke of Black cries out in surprise.]\n\n\n[The Duke of Black turns his gun from the Duke of Yellow to the Chancellor on the dais. Blood splatter is present on his face and moustache. He quickly moves through the crowd as if to charge the dais. The people part for him as he does so.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor shakes his head and puts both of his hands out in a gesture to stop the Duke of Black.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDesist, my Duke of Black. This is not the way!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black opens his mouth to shout loudly.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes it is! I am seizing my right, as the killer of the Emperor, to become ruler of his Empire!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Two more flashes light up the throne room as the Duke of Black fires two shots into the Chancellor\u2019s belly. The Chancellor falls to the ground. The Duke of Black steps onto the dais.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI invoke the Tradition of Alagadda! I proclaim the words that the Sword King said to the Emperor of the Daevites, on the day Adytum was razed to the ground. \u2018By the right of blood, I conquer. By the right of murder, I take! By right of defacement, I destroy!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor, cradling his wounded belly, lies on the floor. Upon hearing the words, he shouts.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo! My Emperor, no!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The camera shifts to a wide shot as the Duke of Black throws his gun down and starts to determinedly walk to the Emperor\u2019s coffin. Throwing both of his arms outwards, he grips both sides of the Emperor\u2019s coffin.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor, with tears in his eyes, cries out again. Blood flows freely from both the wound on his belly and the sides of his mask.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWake, my Emperor! Defend your body!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black throws the coffin lid aside and onto the dais. The glass shatters on the ground. Before him, he sees the Emperor\u2019s corpse, carefully arranged to look as if he was still sleeping. A faint red line is seen around the Emperor\u2019s neck. Laughing maniacally, the Duke of Black begins to seize the Emperor\u2019s corpse by the sides of his body.]\n\n\n[And then the coffin lurches, throwing the Duke to the ground. The Duke looks at the coffin in shock.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. What happened?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The shot pans to the Chancellor on the ground, crawling forward painfully across the floor of the dais. A long blood trail is shown originating from the place where he was wounded. His eyes are bloodshot.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Emperor, please\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black gets to his feet, then cries out again as he starts to charge at the coffin.]\n\n\n[Then, in a staggered manner similar to a stop-motion animation, the Emperor\u2019s body is pulled above the coffin. A noose and rope manifest around his neck, stretching high above the view of the shot. He hangs limply from the ceiling.]\n\n\n[The Duke of Black freezes.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Grace\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[In a similarly staggered manner, the Emperor\u2019s body is slowly pulled across the stage and towards his throne. He is slowly lowered onto it by the rope. Still suspended, he is made to lifelessly sit on top of the throne.]\n\n\n[Slowly, the Emperor opens his eyes. They are glassy.]\n\n\n[The Duke of Black screams, falling back. He starts to scramble backward on his hands in fear.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Emperor, he\u2026 he is alive! He is alive once again!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor\u2019s mouth lolls out. His tongue is seen being covered in a black substance.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Emperor is not dead yet\u2026 my Duke of Black\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor\u2019s mouth speaks unnaturally, his mouth slowly opening and closing in a manner incompatible with speech.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have committed treason\u2026 of the highest\u2026 order\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The right side of the Emperor\u2019s face spasms. He puts his arm out in a stiff manner, as if fighting rigor mortis. He points at the Duke in an accusatory manner. His fingernails are very long.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are hereby exiled\u2026 from my Empire. No more\u2026 shall you step foot in my throne room. No more\u2026 shall you walk as yourself. You shall be reduced to a shadow of life\u2026 a manner not dissimilar to\u2026 a corpse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Duke of Black\u2019s expression is that of horrified shock. He shakes his head in disbelief.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 no, no, no!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Then the throne room is lit up by a flash once again as the Duke\u2019s head is blasted back by a gunshot. He falls to the floor, dead.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor is seen holding the gun that the Duke discarded. He is shaking with effort on the ground as he continues to bleed.]\n\n\n[Having killed the Duke, the Chancellor\u2019s head falls to the ground limply. The Emperor faces in his direction.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, Chancellor\u2026 that is not a fate I would reserve\u2026 for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Gently, ropes from the ceiling descend, wrap around the Chancellor\u2019s body, and haul him to his feet. Two ropes are fastened around his wrists, which he holds onto tightly. Slowly, his wounds begin to close. His flesh also begins to knot around the mask tied to his face.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor smiles with pure joy, revatilized.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much, my Emperor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Turning from the Chancellor to the crowd, the Emperor slowly draws his hands up in a grand gesture. The rope pulls him up from the ground and allows him to float slightly above the dais.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, to my subjects\u2013 you have all served me\u2026 faithfully. I have heard your struggles and your pain, and know now what to do in order to alleviate it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom this day, and henceforth\u2026 the Empire of Alegannen will open its treasury to its subjects. We shall celebrate every day until the end of time\u2026 for your Emperor has returned to you. Each night shall be filled with dance, laughter and feasting. No more shall a subject of mine starve or suffer. Now don masks of mirth\u2026 and celebrate my return.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[At once, the funeral goers in the throne room don masks and begin to dance with glee and abandon. The Duke of Yellow quickly comes to his feet and jumps in happiness as ropes cover the wound on his chest and revitalize him. The two other Dukes mingle with the crowd, shouting in celebration.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Emperor has returned! The Emperor has returned! The Emperor has returned!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[As the music being played over the silent film swells, the Emperor is seen turning to his Chancellor, who is standing by his side. The Chancellor still clings tightly to the ropes that pull him upwards. The Emperor gestures stiffly to him.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour loyalty\u2026 must be rewarded\u2026 Chancellor. You have waited day and night for my return, and have guarded this Empire from those who would take it\u2026 even at the expense of your own life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor shakes his head modestly.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI desire no reward, your Majesty. Only that I serve you forever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor smiles.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you indeed shall serve me\u2026 for I must rest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Ropes begin to creep along the Emperor\u2019s body, slowly wrapping him from head to toe.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor turns to the Emperor.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRest, my Emperor? But you have only just returned.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[More ropes appear around the noose of the Emperor\u2019s neck and slowly begin wrapping his chin.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed\u2026 I have. But my return has cost me much. From this moment until the end of time\u2026 I name you my Ambassador. You will make my will known to the Empire. You will be my voice when my voice is absent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Slowly, the ropes wrap around the Emperor\u2019s face, covering it entirely. He gently leans back on the throne.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow go\u2026 and make merry with my subjects.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Emperor\u2019s head goes limp, held up only by the noose still tying him from the ceiling.]\n\n\n[With a deep breath, the Chancellor steps onto the dais, and puts his arms out in a receiving gesture. He glorifies in his power.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo all of Alegannen, heed our Emperor\u2019s words! Make merry all, and celebrate! For today our Empire is revitalized, now and forever more!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[At his words, the crowd begins to dance in an erratic and maddened manner. The hall doors open, and more of the Emperor\u2019s dancing subjects begin to enter the throne room from the Palace. Servants are seen dancing from one noble to another as they deliver food and drink. All in the hall are wearing Venetian masks displaying expressions of happiness and mirth.]\n\n\n[Smiling to himself, the Chancellor steps back from the edge of the dais, and then turns to the Prince\u2019s coffin, which has inexplicably shifted from the front of the throne to a dark corner beside the dais.]\n\n\n[The Chancellor\u2019s expression shifts from joy to mocking scorn. He steps down from the dais and slowly walks to the Prince\u2019s coffin.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday the entire Empire celebrates\u2026 but not you, dearest Prince. Your foolishness has cost you much\u2026 not least your life. Now, you are robbed of even seeing your beloved father return to us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor embraces the head of the coffin and whispers to it. Unlike the Emperor\u2019s coffin, the lid of the Prince\u2019s coffin is closed.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNot for you the glory of paradise. Not for you the boons of the Emperor. Not for you the rule of Alegannen. \u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The Chancellor mockingly kisses the surface of the Prince\u2019s coffin. Saliva coats the surface of the coffin from the mouth hole of the Chancellor\u2019s mask.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNot for you the mirth of life. Only for you the cold comforts of the ground.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the foolish deserve their death, my Prince. And unlike the Emperor, in death you stay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Laughing to himself, the Chancellor returns to the dais.]\n\n\n[The camera, however, lingers on the Prince\u2019s closed coffin. The music of celebration continues.]\n\n\n[Then, the film ends.]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Due to the lack of anomalous properties, SCP-7246 was marked as a low-priority research object. It was taken to the Anomalous Film Archives at Site-57 following its first playback, along with other Hanged King-related material. It would be retrieved again on January 15, 1970.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7246.2:\n The following log details the changes made to SCP-7246 beginning from its second playback in 1970 until its second to final playback in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 1970\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA minor change is noted where the character of the Prince is noted as being more hunched over than in the initial playback. Large eyebags are also present under his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chancellor is noted as wearing a golden pin on his clothing that was not present in the initial version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 22, 1972\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the scene of the Prince\u2019s escape from the trap, the character is noted to be crying profusely. Mucus is also noted to be issuing from his nose as he starts to run towards the lone soldier in the sewers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional shot is added to the film after the Prince\u2019s death. This shot focuses on the Prince\u2019s dead body in the sewers, which is seen to be floating unceremoniously in the dirty water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo additional scenes are added to the film involving the Chancellor, who is seen crying nobly after the Emperor\u2019s and Prince\u2019s bodies are found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2, 1975\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prince is portrayed as a hunchback, with an unkempt appearance and a bald spot on the left side of his head. All scenes showing him speaking have been changed to show him delivering his lines in an idiotic manner. He is also shown to have a stagger when he walks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chancellor\u2019s clothing has been changed to more regal and princely clothing, with a long cape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Emperor is shown to be more sickly and fragile as he presides over his council in the opening scene of the film. The Chancellor assists him as he stands from his seat. The Prince is shown to be busy fiddling with the buttons on his clothing as this transpires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 5, 1978\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chancellor\u2019s age has been changed to that of a middle-aged man with a proud demeanor. Instead of being at the council table during the opening scene, he is instead shown as being present at the Emperor\u2019s side all throughout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prince\u2019s seat has been moved to where the Chancellor used to be during the initial playback of the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the Prince\u2019s dialog has been edited to possess an evident stutter.\n\n\nThe Prince has been changed to possess an evident tic that causes his eye to twitch as he speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the final funeral scene, the Duke of Black is shown to crash into the Prince\u2019s coffin on his way to the dais. The Prince\u2019s mutilated body is seen falling from it at the edge of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 22, 1982\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scene where the Chancellor discovers the Prince\u2019s body has been changed to show the Chancellor shaking his head in defeat before lamenting the foolishness of the Prince.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 1983\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the scene where the Prince\u2019s body is discovered, the Chancellor is seen crying nobly as he shakes his head. He then follows this with a smirk, before turning around and declaring \u201cNow this kingdom has no sovereign. I, reluctantly, must take the reins.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prince\u2019s coffin is absent at the funeral. Neither the Chancellor nor the Dukes discuss the funeral of the Prince, instead only discussing that of the Emperor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scene where the Chancellor laments the Prince\u2019s foolishness after the resurrection of the Emperor is changed to the Chancellor speaking the words to himself in the throne room while looking to his right, presumed to be in the direction of the Prince\u2019s body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film ends with a scene depicting the Prince\u2019s body being covered in ants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the scenes and dialog of the Prince is cut from the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the scene where the Emperor names the Chancellor his regent, the wording of his dialog is changed to \u201cI name you my Ambassador and Heir. You will be the son I never had\u2013 you, fair and noble Chancellor, will be the ruler of Alegannen in my stead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film ends with a scene depicting a bloody yet empty cross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7246.3:\n The following transcript summarizes SCP-7246 upon its final playback on June 30th, 1986.\n\n\n\n\n[Classical music plays over the opening title card.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Hanging of the Emperor and the Death of His Prince\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[After several seconds, the title card changes.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Tragedy of the Crucified Prince and the Folly of His Chancellor\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The film fades to black.]\n\n\n[The scene opens back in the middle of the initial council meeting, where the Emperor asks his nobles for counsel. The entire film is suffused with a red tinge. As before, the Chancellor answers first, then the Duke of Black, and then the Prince. As the Prince sits down and the Emperor accepts his answer, the camera pans to the Duke of Black. He is seen smirking to himself as he looks at the Emperor and then back.]\n\n\n[An entirely new scene replaces the one where the Emperor comes out of the Palace and talks to his subjects. Instead, it focuses on the Duke of Black as he speaks to the two men who would later kill the Emperor. Both men nod, and leave.]\n\n\n[The scene with the Emperor resting and then being taken away is retained. An additional scene is shown of the men knocking the Emperor out and then hanging him on top of the post. The Emperor seizes three times while unconscious, but does not wake.]\n\n\n[The scene with the Chancellor and the Prince searching for the Emperor resumes. The scene is extended with the Chancellor falling to his knees and begging for forgiveness. The Prince is frozen in place as he stares up. Several teardrops fall from the edges of his eyes.]\n\n\n[A title card appears. Like before, it is tinged with a red atmosphere.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Emperor dies. Traitors make their move.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[A new scene follows. The Duke of Black is seen writing a letter to an unknown recipient. After a few seconds, he nods in satisfaction and hands it to the servant. He gets up from his seat and wraps a cloak around himself, his dour face being replaced by a self-satisfied smirk.]\n\n\n[A shot follows of the servant holding the letter. It passes several hands, before being delivered to the Palace. Instead of being given to the Prince, however, it is instead given to the commander of the Palace garrison. As the commander opens it, the letter is revealed as being an order to muster for the funeral of the late Emperor.]\n\n\n[The film skips forward to the Duke\u2019s dead body as seen later on during the funeral scene. It holds the shot for several minutes as the Emperor orders his subjects to celebrate his return. The Chancellor is seen stepping on the body on the way to visit the Prince\u2019s coffin.]\n\n\n[A title card appears again.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd one of those traitors has received his punishment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film goes into a timelapse of the Duke\u2019s dead body. He is left on the dais of the throne room, and the shot shows the body go through the stages of decay as funeral goers continue to dance beside it.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut what of the other, the traitor who killed the Prince?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Then, the shot lifts to capture the neglected coffin of the Prince, which has since been knocked over and is routinely ignored by dancing nobles. A rotten hand with a hole punctured through it is seen sticking out from the overturned coffin. Flies are seen flying above it. Maggots burrow through the flesh.]\n\n\n[The shot returns to linger on the Prince\u2019s coffin. The previously rotting hand has now been replaced by bone, except for the flesh surrounding the hole. It is blackened with decay.]\n\n\n[Then, the film shifts to show a shot of a crucified man.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA crucified man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The film lingers on the shot for several minutes.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe truth will out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Then, the film changes to show a man in Baroque Italian attire nailing the man to the cross. As the shot is further illuminated by a light, it shows that the man in Baroque attire has the appearance of the Chancellor.]\n\n\n[The film quickly flashes to show the two men in their previous German-style attire, and reveals the Chancellor as wearing the same uniform as the officer that the Prince had met at the sewer gate. The man on the cross, meanwhile, has been mutilated beyond recognition. Only the remains of the officer\u2019s cap shows his identity as the Prince.]\n\n\n[A title card is shown.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat of the man who has sunk Alegannen into endless dance and celebration?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Then the film focuses on the Chancellor, now freshly appointed as Ambassador by the Emperor, presiding over the throng of dancing nobles. As the shot widens to show more of the throne room, it is quickly intercut with shots of broken ankles, twisted legs, and bloody feet.]\n\n\n[The shot then freezes to show a worm\u2019s eye view of some of the dancing nobles. As it pans up, it shows them still shouting with glee with no regard for their injuries. As one of them continues to dance, her femur bone breaks, showing exposed muscle. She resumes dancing nonetheless, further worsening the injury.]\n\n\n[Afterwards, a shot is shown of the Chancellor placing a grand throne beside that of the Emperor\u2019s, and sitting on it. As seen by the advanced state of decay in the body of the Duke of Black, this takes place at a much later time than the Emperor\u2019s return. He wields a scepter and shouts with glee in tandem to the dancing nobles in the throne room. At once, the nobles dance in a far more frenzied manner. Many of them are seen to be severely malnourished, with many having leg bones snap as they make contact with the ground. Many more injuries are seen being suffered by the dancers as they do so.]\n\n\n[A title card appears once again.]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Prince\u2019s murderer rules Alagadda.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut someday, his comeuppance shall arrive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[The film then flashes to the Chancellor\u2019s dead body on the ground, rotting on the dais beside the body of the Duke of Black. The ropes which he clung onto have disappeared. His mouth lolls open. A plank of wood is seen impaling his body.]\n\n\n[The shot shifts to a view of the Chancellor\u2019s body from the floor. It shows that the plank of wood impaling his body is a large cross. The body of the Prince as seen earlier is still nailed upon it.

        "\u201cEmerging from a war with Adytum, the Empire of Alegannen is suffering.\u201d",
        "\u201cThe Emperor, long ruling over his subjects, is benevolent and kind. The state of his Empire disturbs him.\u201d",
        "\u201cDearest nobles of the land\u2026 My Empire is in decline, and my subjects suffer. What may I do in order to help their miserable state?\u201d",
        "\u201cYour Majesty, there is none that we can do in the present that could completely remedy the loss that our subjects have suffered; Instead, what we could do for them is to remain patient, rule well, and in time they will prosper.\u201d",
        "\u201cYour Grace, I respect the Chancellor\u2019s patience and his capacity for good counsel, but I and my fellow Dukes say that this is no time for dallying. What we must do is open the treasury, so that our subjects may freely benefit from our good graces.\u201d",
        "\u201cWhat of you, my son? What may you suggest to lift our subjects\u2019 spirits?\u201d",
        "\u201cFather, while the Chancellor is wise to counsel patience, and the Duke of Black kind to counsel generosity, I say we take a middle ground. Before we open our treasury to our subjects, let us first take the time to hear out their concerns by speaking to them as a common man. Only then may we understand their struggles, and only then may we address the root of their difficulties.\u201d",
        "\u201cIt is decided then! I shall disguise myself and walk among my subjects as a common man. I shall hear out their complaints and understand their struggles. By the time I return to this palace, we shall reconvene to determine how best to address them.\u201d",
        "\u201cYour Grace, what of your guards? The city is dark and dangerous, and many thieves could waylay your passage and bring harm to your person.\u201d",
        "\u201cGuards would mark me out as a noble, to be feared rather than to be spoken to freely. I will eschew protection. My subjects are desperate, but they will not be so wretched as to kill a defenseless old man.\u201d",
        "\u201cWhat of me, father? You know of my skill with pistol and blade. I will don a disguise with you, and defend you when you are at risk of harm.\u201d",
        "\u201cYou are a good and brave Prince, and a dutiful son to his father. Alas, I cannot take you with me. Your status as a Prince marks you out as proud and of noble countenance, while I am old and tired. My subjects will not believe our disguises should you come with me.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy dearest friend, send word to my servants. Tell them to bring me a wretched shirt and tattered trousers, so that I may wear it and walk among my subjects.\u201d",
        "\u201cYour will be done, your Majesty.\u201d",
        "\u201cOh how wretched a life my subjects live! I have only spent a day among them, yet already I feel the volume of their suffering. Now I know of their struggles with bread and grain, and their incapability to find warm food and good lodging. When I return to the palace, I shall take great measures to address this in earnest.\u201d",
        "\u201cOh take no pity on me, Sirs. I am simply taking a rest here.\u201d",
        "\u201cNo matter, your Majesty. We have been told what you are, and we shall not hesitate to make the rest permanent.\u201d",
        "\u201cThe Prince and the Palace descended into grief for the death of the Emperor. The Prince was inconsolable, for it was by his suggestion that the Emperor went to his death.\u201d",
        "\u201cEventually, the Prince received information of the culprit\u2019s hiding place. He resolved to avenge his father himself.\u201d",
        "\u201cDo not block my way. I have come to avenge my father on the assassins who murdered him.\u201d",
        "\u201cThe information that you have received, Your Highness, may be false. For the assassins to hide in the sewers underneath the city after killing your father is suspicious and unnatural. Let me first investigate.\u201d",
        "\u201cNo. I trust the Dukes and their spies. They grieve my father as much as anyone else. Step aside, Chancellor. Prepare my father\u2019s funeral. When I return, I will have made sure that his death is avenged.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy Prince, please. I plead for you to reconsider. This is foolish.\u201d",
        "\u201cNo, it is not.\u201d",
        "\u201cBut our information\u2026 it was correct. Where are they?!\u201d",
        "\u201cIt was a trap, your Highness, a trap!\u201d",
        "\u201cProtect the Prince!\u201d",
        "\u201cNo, I must stay behind!\u201d",
        "\u201cYou carry our hopes with you, Majesty! You are our Emperor now, and we are but your subjects!\u201d",
        "\u201cI was foolish- I was foolish!\u201d",
        "\u201cOfficer, save my men! They are engaged in a fight with the Emperor\u2019s assassins!\u201d",
        "\u201cYou shall have to forgive me, my Prince. You were too quick to rush in.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy Prince, what did they do to you?\u201d",
        "\u201cThus the line of the Emperor was extinguished, as the young Prince was murdered in the same way as his father. As the Empire suffered more and more, the Chancellor reluctantly took the reins.\u201d",
        "\u201cYet, instead of declaring himself Emperor, he lamented the death of his sovereigns. Realizing that he could hold no candle to the majesty that had been extinguished from this world, he instead followed the law and took up the mantle of regent\u2013 until such a time as the Emperor or his Prince would return to them once again.\u201d",
        "\u201cBut the Dukes would not listen to him.\u201d",
        "\u201cThe Emperor and his heir are dead under your watch. Why must we follow you?\u201d",
        "\u201cThree days have passed, and there is no clue as to who killed both the Emperor and the Prince. Their bodies have been disrespected with no show of deference, and yet we stand here with no resolution on what is next!\u201d",
        "\u201cYou may be regent now, as is the law of the land, but our Empire is meant to be ruled by an Emperor. Declare a council to decide the succession, or we shall put one of our own on the throne for you.\u201d",
        "\u201cPlease, my lords! The Emperor and the Prince are not yet cold in their coffins, and yet we stand in discord and disunity! Let us at least first accord the sovereigns with honors befitting their station before we descend into chaos. The funeral is already tomorrow!\u201d",
        "\u201cIt seems you are delaying the inevitable, lord Regent. Your age seems to be hobbling you from carrying out your given task.\u201d",
        "\u201cYou always were too patient, lord Regent! Instead of following the advice of the Duke of Black, our Emperor was led astray by you and his Prince. If I were a betting man, I would say that you led them to their deaths on purpose.\u201d",
        "\u201cI say we wait until after the funeral, lords. After then, we shall decide who will replace our fatuous Regent.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy lord Dukes, that would be against the rules of the land!\u201d",
        "\u201cSo is treason, correct? You were the one who led the Prince astray, I know it. You were the one who bade him to go to the sewers to his death.\u201d",
        "\u201cBut the Prince said the information of the assassins\u2019 location came from all of you!\u201d",
        "\u201cThere was no information that came from us. The Prince went of his own accord.\u201d",
        "\u201cNo, that is not true! The Prince said that\u2026\u201d",
        "\u201cYou lie\u2026 Chancellor. You lie to save your own skin. The Duke of Red is right. It was only you who counseled the Emperor to patience, and thereby influenced the Prince to suggest he walk among his subjects. It was only you who was close to the Prince when the Emperor died. None of us were in Alegannen when our sovereigns were murdered.\u201d",
        "\u201cI agree with the Duke of Yellow. We wait until after we give deference at the funeral, when the clock ticks at nine in the evening. Then, we shall decide if you truly are guilty. Then, we shall decide who shall be our new Emperor.\u201d",
        "\u201cUnless, of course, the old Emperor rises from his grave. Or the Prince.\u201d",
        "\u201cOh my Emperor\u2026 what shall I do now?\u201d",
        "\u201cAnd so the night passed, and gave way to day, then night again. Not a soul saw head or tail of the Chancellor since the day of the council meeting.\u201d",
        "\u201cAt the fourth hour of the afternoon, the servants set out to prepare the funeral.\u201d",
        "\u201cAt the eighth hour, the Chancellor sends the command to begin admitting the noble visitors into the throne room for the funeral. He does not emerge from his chambers.\u201d",
        "\u201cThree of the Dukes arrive piecemeal.\u201d",
        "\u201cThe Duke of Black is absent.\u201d",
        "\u201cIt is the eighth hour, and yet the Chancellor- and regent- is absent.\u201d",
        "\u201cI believe the traitor has ran for his life.\u201d",
        "\u201cIf he has, then he has shown his true character. He has dishonored the Emperor he claimed he loved so dearly, and has left the throne vacant as a result.\u201d",
        "\u201cWas I not right when I claimed he was a traitor? Once I set my men on him, he will have nowhere to hide.\u201d",
        "\u201cAnd yet my lords\u2026 am I not the only one who notices the absence of the Duke of Black?\u201d",
        "\u201cKnowing that man\u2019s dour bearing, he is likely to still be brooding in his keep.\u201d",
        "\u201cTo all those who see my appearance now\u2026 be not afraid.\u201d",
        "\u201cThis is the expression that I have always wished to wear for our Emperor. For our Prince. Instead of joy, however, I have realized that I have brought nothing but shame and weakness. My old face is no more. I have carved it away. This mask is my face now.\u201d",
        "\u201cFor this day\u2026 we honor the life of our Emperor. And we must not wear expressions that are dour- no! Instead, we must smile. We must rejoice. We must celebrate.\u201d",
        "\u201cToday, we lay a thousand year dynasty to rest. A dynasty that sacked Adytum and massacred the Daeva. A dynasty that built an empire of art and science. A dynasty that deserves to be remembered in the most spectacular way.\u201d",
        "\u201cAnd an Emperor who cared for all of us, but was killed\u2026 because I failed to stop it.\u201d",
        "\u201cForgive me, my Emperor.\u201d",
        "\u201cStop this insolence at once!\u201d",
        "\u201cWhat is\u2026 what is the meaning of this?\u201d",
        "\u201cPutting an end to your treason.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy Duke of Black\u2026 you commit treason yourself! You are bringing an army to the Emperor\u2019s throne room! And on the eve of the funeral held to honor him!\u201d",
        "\u201cThe old Emperor was a weak-willed sovereign, barely deserving of the name. It is only fitting that he died in the time that he did, before Adytum invaded again.\u201d",
        "\u201cBut this\u2026 this is still treason! Follow what we planned, my dear lord. Reserve your fire for when the time is truly at hand!\u201d",
        "\u201cNo\u2026\u201d",
        "\u201cHe has been planning this from the start. He is the one who knew that the Emperor would be unguarded. He is the one among the Dukes who lured the Prince to his death!\u201d",
        "\u201cHe is right!\u201d",
        "\u201cIt does not matter now!\u201d",
        "\u201cDesist, my Duke of Black. This is not the way!\u201d",
        "\u201cYes it is! I am seizing my right, as the killer of the Emperor, to become ruler of his Empire!\u201d",
        "\u201cI invoke the Tradition of Alagadda! I proclaim the words that the Sword King said to the Emperor of the Daevites, on the day Adytum was razed to the ground. \u2018By the right of blood, I conquer. By the right of murder, I take! By right of defacement, I destroy!\u2019\u201d",
