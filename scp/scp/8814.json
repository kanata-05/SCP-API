The holder of SCP-8814 will be assigned to active duty as part of Site-400's combat MTF Sigma-20 (\"The Ex-Men\"). Should the user of SCP-8814 become a casualty of deployment, SCP-8814 is to be reassigned to a suitable candidate as soon as viable.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8814 is a modern claw hammer of standard industrial make.\n\n\nIf an individual holding SCP-8814 (denoted SCP-8814-A) says the words \"white power\" in any tone of voice or volume, two lightning bolts will strike the individual regardless of ongoing weather conditions. These lightning bolts will not cause any significant physical harm, but rather will temporarily bleach the individual's hair and tint the individual's eyes a light blue, believed to be from the photoelectric effect. Notably, this transformation occurs regardless of the ancestry, self-perceived racial identity, bigotry, or political beliefs of the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial /x/ post depicting the operation of SCP-8814.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder this transformation, SCP-8814-A will have increased strength, increased agility, aerial self-propulsion, and increased physical durability. Upper limits of strength and agility have not been formally tested. SCP-8814-A are durable against most small-arms fire, a high degree of blunt trauma, and lacerations but have proven to be vulnerable to standard Foundation issue depleted uranium rounds.\n\n\nThe SCP-8814 transformation can be dispelled if SCP-8814-A expresses a sentiment in line with an appreciation of the belief of the equality of all human beings. Notable functional statements include:\n\n\n\n\nActually, I voted for Obama.\n\n\nAll lives matter.\n\n\nI have a black friend.\n\n\n\u767d\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u7684\u3002\n\n\nI don't really pay attention to politics.\n\n\nThis is fucking disgusting. Who made this crap. I don't want anything to do with it, I don't care if it lets me fly.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8814 was recovered from a self-described neo-Nazi and \"Odinist enchanter\" named Sigrid Vril (birth name: Eduardo Cohen-Chang) after a potential mass casualty incident in a Walmart in Coralville, Iowa. Upon determining that Cohen-Chang was not committing non-anomalous gun violence, a Foundation sniper successfully terminated him with a depleted uranium bullet and retrieved the artifact. Activation requirements were determined through digital archaeology of Cohen-Chang's internet activities.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a05/GIMP-clearance\u00a0individuals\u00a0only\n\n\n\n\nWelcome,\u00a0Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGifted Individual Management Program (GIMP)\n\n\nSCP-8814\n\n\n\n\nCarlos \"Squiggles\" de Jager, PhD, ACMA, Aifs, MCIOB, ACIS, CMIOSH, CITP, FCILEx\n\n\nGIMP Director, Site-400 Shadow Administrator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective:\n The Site-400 Gifted Individual Management Program controls individuals possessing or likely to be endowed with anomalous capabilities who also possess asocial tendencies or otherwise cannot handle the overall stresses of Foundation employment. These individuals cannot be remanded to the general population but are also unsuitable for high-priority high-capability installations such as Sites -43, -120, or -19, so they are transferred to a Site with like-minded individuals where they ultimately can do little harm. For most individuals under management, GIMP has been highly successful and provided them with the illusion of autonomy despite their gross incompetence. However, GIMP is ill-suited for managing violent and bigoted individuals given the general incompetence of its members and the racial diversity prevalent in Site-400. SCP-8814 changes that.\n\n\nBackground:\n MTF Sigma-20 \"The Ex-Men\" are a group of anomalous contained personnel from Site-400 who have been told that their abilities have made them well-suited for an elite task force in the vein of Alpha-9. In truth, they are liabilities who have proven a drain on our containment resources because they believe themselves to be outside of the chain of command and the reasonable authority of Foundation discipline. They are deployed to highly dangerous situations where their failures will cause minimal collateral damage.\n\n\nParameters:\n When an openly white supremacist or white nationalist subject is transferred to Site-400, they will be assigned to the GIMP, given SCP-8814, and encouraged to pick a codename. Past codenames have included:\n\n\n\n\nAlbia Eternal\n\n\nThe Hyperborean\n\n\nPurugenation\n\n\nFinality\n\n\nThor Vader\n\n\nCaptain Aryan\n\n\n\n\nThis step is generally adequate to confirm the subject's suitability for usual SCP-8814 procedures. While the Foundation tolerates bigotry in essential and high-performing personnel, individuals transferred to Site-400 for said bigotry produce poor work product and lack other redeeming qualities.\n\n\nAfter confirmation, the newly-christened SCP-8814-A will be encouraged to discover a limited set of their abilities, up to and including their durability against small-arms fire. No harm is to come to SCP-8814-A at this phase, though such harm is unlikely given the general workplace conditions of Site-400 and, if lethal, within acceptable operating parameters.\n\n\nI or my successors will deploy the Ex-Men to assist MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") at the soonest available opportunity. SCP-8814-A almost always violate the chain of command, disregard security, containment, and protection principles, and become a serious threat to mission success and risk of loss of life. Nu-7 is invariably forced to terminate SCP-8814 and has been informed that standard Foundation issue depleted uranium rounds are adequate. Sigma-20 have been instructed to recover SCP-8814.\n\n\nThis approach has prevented the formation of a significant white supremacist movement within the staff body of Site-400.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8814\n\" by LORDXVNV, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
