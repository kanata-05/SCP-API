As direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is prohibited, only D-Class personnel are authorized to move the item. Research involving SCP-2291 is prohibited without the express permission of Dr. Mbeke or Site-19\u2019s senior administrative staff. Individuals that touch SCP-2291 directly are to be designated SCP-2291-A, administered a Class B amnestic, and placed into confinement for 3 months or until cleared by a supermajority of Site-19's psychiatric panel. Individuals that still show symptoms after this period are to be terminated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2291 is a corrugated cardboard box with a edge length of 15cm. The word \u201cFUN\u201d is printed in large, black capital letters on each side. There are no gaps or joints on SCP-2291's surface, suggesting that it was formed whole rather than being folded from a flat sheet. D-Class personnel report a rattling noise issuing from SCP-2291 when moved, suggesting that it contains one or more smaller objects. All attempts to access SCP-2291's interior via destructive means have failed, as have imaging studies intended to probe the interior. Level-3 personnel and above may request Test Logs 2291 -1 though -4 for more details.\n\n\nSCP-2291 was recovered from the offices of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ohio. Foundation assets were alerted after the entire staff of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions was reported missing within a period of 2 days. Mobile Task Force Rho-9 (\"The Dundies\") was assigned to investigate, and recovered SCP-2291 along with 18 instances of SCP-2291-A, identified as the former employees of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions. These individuals were found at their workstations, suffering from sleep deprivation and mild dehydration.\n\n\nDirect physical contact with SCP-2291 is to be considered a Delta-class cognitohazard. Those who do so are to be designated SCP-2291-A and experience the following symptoms:\n\n\n\n\nAll communication by SCP-2291-A instances is altered. SCP-2291-A instances involuntarily replace some adjectives, especially those involving emotion, with the word \u201cfun\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-2291-A instances smile constantly, even while sleeping.\n\n\nSCP-2291 significantly alters how SCP-2291-A instances express and experience emotion. Immediately after initial exposure, subjects report increased feelings of happiness and significantly reduced resistance to authority. As the time of exposure to SCP-2291 increases, however, symptoms change; subjects repeatedly exposed to SCP-2291 for a period greater than 2 weeks become reliant on SCP-2291's effects to experience pleasure. When isolated from SCP-2291, these subjects temporarily lose their ability to normally process endorphins. In addition to a suppressed ability to experience pleasure, these individuals experience symptoms analogous to extreme doses of Naloxone in opiate abusers; restlessness, sweating, and headache are common.\n\n\n\n\nWhen isolated from SCP-2291, SCP-2291-A instances typically recover within 3 months. Recovery is negatively correlated with exposure time; the less time a subject spends near SCP-2291, the greater their chance of recovery.\n\n\nInterview Log 2291-17-3:\n The first 18 known SCP-2291-A subjects were the employees of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions, all of whom were detained during the recovery of SCP-2291. The following interview has been deemed notable due to its content.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02291-17-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02291-17-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2291-17\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Researcher Evans\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-2291-17 was interviewed 2 weeks after containment. SCP-2291-17, formerly known as Ahmed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was an accountant at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nEvans:\n Hello, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I'd like ask you a few questions about SCP-2291.\n\n\nSCP-2291-17:\n What?\n\n\nEvans:\n The object in this picture.\n\n\nEvans hands SCP-2291-17 a photo of SCP-2291\n\n\nSCP-2291-17:\n That? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n1\n brought that in during our holiday party a month ago. Everyone had been kinda fun after the layoffs last quarter, and she said it was a gift to cheer us all up.\n\n\nEvans:\n Who is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nSCP-2291-17:\n She's the head of HR. No one really knew her well, she was just\u2026 fun, you know? Her whole department just weirded all of us out.\n\n\nEvans:\n How have you been feeling since \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brought in SCP-2291?\n\n\nSCP-2291-17:\n My face has been feeling kinda fun lately. Other than that, I just can't stop working. I used to want to go home and see my family, but fun box made me realize something important. I love my job. My job is my life. Why would I go home when I feel so empty there? My job is fun.\n\n\nSCP-2291-17 is silent for 12 seconds\n\n\nSCP-2291-17:\n Can I borrow your pen?\n\n\n\n\nEvans:\n No.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-2291-17 ceased exhibiting anomalous traits 28 days after the interview. He was administered a Class-B amnestic and released, and his SCP designation was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log D-14783-7:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0D-14783-7\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0D-14783-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n D-14783\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Mbeke\n\n\nForeword:\n D-14683, a former paralegal, was chosen for testing with SCP-2291. To test the long-term effects of SCP-2291 on subjects similar to the employees of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions. D-14683 was asked to complete a small amount of legal paperwork after each hour of exposure. The following interview was performed 3 months into SCP-2291 exposure.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Mbeke:\n Hello, D-14783. How are you today?\n\n\nD-14783's tone suggests unhappiness. He remains smiling.\n\n\nD-14783:\n Fun.\n\n\nDr. Mbeke:\n What do you mean by that? You sound sad.\n\n\nD-14783:\n I don't have enough to do. I have to keep working. Can you guys give me more to do?\n\n\nDr. Mbeke:\n I'll see what we can find for you. Tell me, why do you feel like you need to work so much?\n\n\nD-14783:\n I have to be fun. When I'm not writing, when I'm not getting things done, I just get this sense of emptiness. Don't get me wrong, whenever I'm near that little box thing, I feel great. But even then, I feel almost guilty about not working. When I'm not around it, the feeling just gets worse. The only way I can feel like myself is to work.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n D-14783 did not show any progress in recovering from the effects of SCP-2291. He reported consistent worsening of psychological symptoms as time of exposure increased. He was found dead in his cell 4 months and 12 days after the above interview. Cause of death was ruled to be blood loss resulting from suicide, as D-14783 had repeatedly carved the word \"fun\" into his chest and left forearm with a screw taken from his cot. Due to this incident, further long-term studies with SCP-2291 are prohibited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 2291-A:\n The following is a transcript of Video 2291-A, recovered from a camcorder found in the offices of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporate Solutions.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a02291-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a02291-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00:00\n - Video begins.
