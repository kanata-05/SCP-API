Due to the environment SCP-6255 events happen in, SCP-6255 is currently self-contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Abbett's office prior to an SCP-6255 event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6255 is the designation given to a phenomenon that occurs within the boundaries of Site-94. SCP-6255 is believed to happen at least two times a week, although the estimated amount of weekly SCP-6255 events is currently unknown. SCP-6255's anomalous properties consist in the manifestation of an SCP-6255-1 instance in a random location within Site-94.\n\n\nSCP-6255-1 instances take the form of porcelain coffee cups containing different liquids\n1\n and a pair of legs underneath them. Following the execution of an SCP-6255 event, SCP-6255-1 instances will attempt to reach the closest personnel, incline, and pour their liquids onto their clothes or any object said personnel is carrying\n2\n before displaying a crudely painted message on itself. This message may vary depending on the context of the event.\n\n\nOnce an SCP-6255-1 instance has completed its task, it will demanifest as soon as possible. As of the time of writing, 143 SCP-6255 events have been reported via surveillance since its appearance on 07/29/2021.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The next addendum is a non-comprehensive log including several SCP-6255 events recorded during the month of September, 2021. All recordings were stored in Site-94's surveillance room.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Log?\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance Log 6255.1\n: Infirmary\n\n\n\n\nEvent:\n During an analysis of \nDr. Maya Warren's\n vitals following her death, an SCP-6255-1 instance spawned in Site-94's sickbay and poured its liquids (Fresh Water) on Dr. Albert White's phone, who was at the moment browsing images and Internet memes.\n\n\nResult:\n The SCP-6255-1 instance displayed the message \"\nRESPECT FOR THE DEAD.\n\" before jumping inside Dr. White's lab coat and demanifesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance Log 6255.2\n: Cafeteria\n\n\n\n\nEvent:\n Janitor Savannah Santos entered Site-94's cafeteria and ordered a cold coffee at the caf\u00e9's machine, but before she could grab a plastic cup, an SCP-6255-1 instance manifested, filled itself with hot coffee, and jumped onto Janitor Santos's suit.\n\n\nResult:\n The SCP-6255-1 instance fell to the floor, and instead of shattering, it displayed the following message before demanifesting: \"\nDISGUSTING\n\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance Log 6255.3\n: Workbench\n\n\n\n\nEvent:\n Junior Researcher Michaels was using a typewriter to work on the official classification of an anomaly that recently arrived at Site-94.
