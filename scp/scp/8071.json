SCP-8071 appears as increasingly severe lacerations upon the subjects\u2019 bodies, starting on the arms and working its way to the torso before moving down to the legs. The anomaly typically manifests in early adulthood and is, assuming medical aid is provided, fatal within the next 5-10 years. Typical causes of death include blood loss, opportunistic infection, sustained trauma causing damage to the immune system, and organ failure. Efforts by the Department of Thaumaturgy to prevent or slow this process have failed.\n\n\nSCP-8071 is believed to trace its origins to the Daevite city of \nKazenrud,\n when Onvi-hur, a minor noble, sent a letter to his personal Ma\u0161aide\u00e1\u1e6d\n2\n requesting that a curse be levied upon Hezhum-bet, a rival nobleman, so that \u201chim and all his disgusting brood would suffer the slow death of a thousand cuts, in perpetuity\u201d. The Ma\u0161aide\u00e1\u1e6d agreed to the request and performed the ritual sometime in the next week. The specifics are unknown, as most \nrecords\n of that period of Daevite history have been lost, but it is known that the following materials were requested:\n\n\n\n\nThree athames, of which one was to be shattered;\n\n\nFive slaves below the age of 9, in good health;\n3\n\n\nThe pickled fetus of an East Siberian brown bear;\n4\n\n\n\u201cFive septs [Daevite unit of measurement] of the usual herbs\u201d;\n\n\nA jar of Hezhum-bet\u2019s bodily fluids;\n5\n\n\nHuman bones, to create a ritual circle;\n\n\n\n\nThe ritual was successful and spread through Hezhum-bet\u2019s line quickly, causing the death of approximately three-quarters of his family. Onvi-hur wrote to his Ma\u0161aide\u00e1\u1e6d, congratulating him on the triumph.\n\n\nThe majority of Hezhum-bet\u2019s and Onvi-hur\u2019s families are believed to have perished in the sacking of Kazenrud. What little descendants survived integrated into the Siberian population and lost their Daevite customs. With the fall of the Empire, the rituals sustaining SCP-8071 decayed and ceased to show any anomalous activity.\n\n\nHowever, the rise of neo-Daevite movements\n6\n has complicated this. Centered almost exclusively in the USA, where GoI-140-C is most prevalent, SCP-8071 has been reactivated. SCP-8071 now manifests seemingly randomly among a small percentage of the individuals genetically descended from Hezhum-bet.\n\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED NOTICE\n\n\nThe remainder of this file is restricted to personnel with 4/8071 Clearance.

Attached is an excerpt of their presentation.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase ID:\n SCP-8071\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nPriority Level:\n Keneq\n\n\nFlagged Departments:\n Containment, Analytics, Memetics, Misinformation, Thaumaturgy, Information Technology, Finance\n\n\nProposal:\n SCP-8071 has been one of the most vexing phenomena ever encountered by the Department of Containment. Despite almost exclusively affecting citizens of the United States, in which the Foundation exerts maximal capacity, containment is unsustainable and extremely expensive. More final solutions, such as the mass detainment and/or termination of those affected, would constitute an unacceptable risk to the Veil and the Foundation\u2019s positive relations with the US Government. Moreover, as is typical for Daevite rituals, attempts to decommission the anomaly have failed utterly.\n\n\nHowever, although they were incapable of neutralizing SCP-8071, the Department of Thaumaturgy has managed to discern a number of important details related to the anomaly\u2019s behavior. Most importantly, they were able to classify SCP-8071 as a Moirai-class ritual. To clarify, Moirai-class rituals function via high-level probabilistic manipulation. In the case of SCP-8071, the anomaly does not directly cut its victim\u2019s body. Rather, it alters fate to ensure that such an outcome occurs. It is merely that the simplest way that this manifests is the \u201cphantom slashes\u201d on the subject\u2019s person, of seemingly no origin.\n\n\nThis implies that as long as the subject\u2019s body is repeatedly cut via other means, the anomaly will remain dormant. The alterations to SCP-8071\u2019s containment procedures hinge on this detail.\n\n\nThe SCP-8071 Research Team proposes the following:\n\n\n\n\nSubjects at risk of SCP-8071 are to be tracked by the Department of Analytics;\n\n\nAccess to genetic databases gained by the Foundation\u2019s contracts with 23andMe, Ancestry.com, and the Central Intelligence Agency are to be used to facilitate this;\n\n\nAny subjects found to be affected by the anomaly are to immediately have their personal devices infected by .AICs designed by the Department of Misinformation;\n7\n\n\nThese devices are to be used as vectors to covertly expose the subject to SILKWORM-class memetic agents;\n\n\nThese memetic agents are to be derived from the emotional profiles of D-Class subjects on high-risk detail as well as personnel assigned to \nSite-17\n;\n\n\nThe purpose of these memetic agents is to induce in the subject an uncontrollable compulsion towards self-mutilation, increasingly driving the subject to lacerate their body with any available sharp objects;\n\n\nIf necessary, to decrease suspicion, a personal crisis is to be manufactured;\n\n\nAt the same time, the subject is to be repeatedly exposed to advertisements for Sabatzky-Coleman Psychiatrics;\n8\n\n\nThese advertisements are to emphasize Sabatzky-Coleman\u2019s extreme effectiveness in curing DSH;\n9\n\n\nShould the subject be of lesser means, they are to be informed that the first session for a potential patient of Sabatzky-Coleman is free;\n\n\nDuring this session, they are to be put under the effect of counter-memetic agents intended to temporarily cure their DSH;\n\n\nThis will result in the brief lessening of their self-harming tendencies, the only treatment that will prove effective;\n\n\nSabatzky-Coleman psychiatrists are to nurture a dependence on their services, emphasizing their reliability and efficacy;\n\n\nThey are then to charge premium rates for said services, citing a number of cover stories developed by the Department of Finance;\n\n\nIf the subject is of lesser means, they are to be encouraged to take out loans from Foundation-run firms or borrow money from relatives;\n\n\nAt the same time, to ensure that the conditions of the SCP-8071 ritual are satisfied, their DSH is to be nurtured by the SILKWORM-class memetic agents, steadily increasing in effectiveness;\n\n\nThe only respite from their compulsive self-harm will be Sabatzky-Coleman sessions, which are to slowly decrease their effectiveness;\n\n\nAs the subject\u2019s mental and physical state deteriorates, they will cease to be considered a reputable source of information and their threat to the Veil will plummet;\n\n\nEventually the subject will be institutionalized by their family or commit suicide;\n\n\nAs the former involves a minor risk to the Veil, the latter is preferable;\n\n\n\n\nThe above protocols are believed to result in the total containment of SCP-8071 as well as lucrative profits for the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nAbove proposal originally denied by the Ethics Committee under Resolution EC #2918, which dissuades the use of memetic agents to harm civilians. Proposal approved upon appeal under #2918 \u00a72, which permits the harmful use of memetic agents upon civilians \"(a) already impacted by an anomalous phenomenon (b) for purposes directly related to containment of said phenomenon.\"\n\n\nSCP-8071 revised protocols placed into effect.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \n[RESTRICTED TO 4/HOLLOW CHALICE CLEARANCE]\n\n\n2\n.
