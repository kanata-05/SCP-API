The specific equation for this relationship has not yet been deduced, but is understood to be proportional; the larger the yield of the explosion, the faster and smoother the subway will function for the day. Following its discovery in June of 2016, several tests with SCP-5983 were authorized to confirm its effects.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 5983.1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nExplosion Yield (kt TNT)\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016.6.27\n\n\n0.05\n\n\nNo significant statistical rise in efficiency. However, researchers noted an unusually low number of complaints filed on the MTA's website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016.7.2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nA delay on one line caused by damaged equipment was cleared much quicker than expected, allowing transit to resume faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016.7.13\n\n\n1\n\n\nTrains operated exactly to estimated times, with no delays or earliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016.7.23\n\n\n2\n\n\nTrains were ahead of schedule by several minutes. MTA staff took active action to maintain this; an employee once pulled a suicidal individual away from the tracks. It is unclear whether SCP-5983 affected this decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016.8.1\n\n\n3.5\n\n\nTrains seemed to regularly defy reality and physics to reach destinations quickly. In one instance, a train began to simply teleport between stations. Kant counters failed to return an accurate measure of the area's Hume level, though this could be due to the ambient effects of the subway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[292 lines omitted]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5983.2:\n In 2018, it was found that an O5 Directive had led to SCP-5983 being tested 297 times since its discovery, occasionally multiple times a day. An official O5 vote was scheduled to decommission testing for SCP-5983.\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\nNAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments:\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\nIn my defense, if you've ever been on the 8:30 to Broadway, you'd want to nuke something too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRounderhouse's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5762\n \n(+256)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTDOC-5495\n \n(+271)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4852\n \n(+323)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7545\n \n(+246)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5690\n \n(+352)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8916\n \n(+289)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1162\n \n(+193)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4049\n \n(+117)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5376\n \n(+254)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4355\n \n(+241)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROUNDERHOUSE's Jade Proposal\n \n(+381)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4513\n \n(+236)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6423-ARC\n \n(+72)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2304\n \n(+366)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5549\n \n(+417)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nLAMB OF GOD\n \n(+96)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHare 023: The Cheshire Cat\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROUNDERHOUSE's Boner Proposal\n \n(+157)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERREGNUM: THE BLACKSTAR AT EVEREST\n \n(+135)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone Prelude: FISHSKIN\n \n(+92)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELTA WAVE\n \n(+97)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Unmasked: Lesser Known Foundation Divisions\n \n(+141)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas At Kiryu Labs\n \n(+64)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles intercepted from Anderson Systems personnel\n \n(+97)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-7: WARPAINT\n \n(+153)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner's Meeting\n \n(+35)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Calendar's Hot Date: Divine Intervention\n \n(+97)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-7: TEMPEST\n \n(+136)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody, Nobody, Nobody, and Nobody's Encounters with The Man in the White Suit\n \n(+124)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF Sigma-5 \"Pumpkin Punchers\"\n \n(+259)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nROUNDERPAGE V2\n \n(+581)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5982\n | SCP-5983 | \nSCP-5984\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5983\n\" by Rounderhouse, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
