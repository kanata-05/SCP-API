The device is to be powered by solar panels and a nearby generator. The computer is to be kept powered on at all times, though measures for remote shutdown are in place.\n\n\nTwo armed guards are to be stationed outside the containment chamber of SCP-8017 at all times. No personnel above D-class are allowed to directly enter the containment chamber and access SCP-8017. Any maintenance to the computer\u2019s hardware and software are to be carried out by D-class personnel under strict, remote supervision. Any interaction with SCP-8017-A by other staff is to be conducted indirectly via streaming SCP-8017 to the adjacent research office. The time allotted to testing will be at the discretion of the lead researcher. Insistence to interact with SCP-8017 past the allotted time will require the removal of the D-class personnel from the testing chamber, and remote shutting down of the computer.\n\n\nFoundation web crawlers are to monitor the Internet for any copies of SCP-8017 or potential SCP-8017-A instances. In case of discovery, all copies of SCP-8017 are to be destroyed and individuals exposed to the object are to be provided amnestics according to their degree of exposure.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Amenities are to be \nprovided based on the discretion of the lead researcher\n completely denied until substantial information can be gleaned from it.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-8017 is the collective designation given to an action role-playing game titled \"Hello, Traveller!\" and its game engine, KAI-1. The gameplay elements and story follow the tropes of many other action RPGs, where the player explores the world, interacts with NPCs, completes quests, and upgrades their character through a level progression system. It appears, however, that all NPCs within the game have sapience, and are aware that they reside within a video game. They are also aware of the existence of a \u2018real world' outside the video game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKAI-1 logo seen during SCP-8017 boot up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8017 was discovered by the police in an apartment in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The tenant, identified as 23-year-old Andreas \"Andy\" Martinsson was found dead in front of an unplugged desktop PC. An autopsy revealed the C.O.D. was cardiac arrest. It was noted that his brain showed damage consistent with extreme stress and fear suffered during or previous to his death.\n\n\nAround his apartment were concept designs for games and printed articles detailing major successes in the video games industry. It was learned that Andy was an indie game developer and, according to recovered notes, \"Hello, Traveller!\" was his creation. It had also been discovered that all individuals closely related to Andy had perished approximately 2 hours before his death; a total of 17 people across Sweden were killed. Causes of death were either from gunshot wounds, trauma from sharp and blunt objects, or wounds akin to those in animal attacks.\n\n\nTo be noted was that Martinsson's phone was found destroyed in his microwave, so it and the CPU were taken as evidence by the Swedish police. Following an incident regarding seeing ghosts in the game, the CPU was later confiscated by the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0The\u00a0Martinsson\u00a0Killings\u00a0Investigation.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0The\u00a0Martinsson\u00a0Killings\u00a0Investigation.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the preliminary experiment logs of SCP-8017 upon securement:\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 1\n\n\nDate:\n 27/07/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81789\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Alright D-class, please start up the game.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Got it.\n\n\n(Upon clicking on the game, a spinning blue circle appears on the cursor before the screen turns black. Seconds later, the logo appears, reading \"KAI-1 game engine.\")\n\n\nD-81789:\n Hmmm, never heard of this engine before.\n\n\n(Seconds later, a main menu screen appears with the title \"Hello, Traveller!\" with several options present. Ambient music is heard in the background.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Okay, quick boot up. Could mean good things. The background\u2019s a bit low resolution though\u2026\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Your commentary isn\u2019t necessary. Select 'new game'.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Yeah, yeah, you\u2019re a jackbooted thug with a huge dick. I get it.\n\n\n(Upon clicking the new game option, a scroll of text describes how a demon king was threatening the land of Sk\u00e1neland, and a chosen one was selected by the clergy to seek out the evil and slay it.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Wow, how original.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Again your-\n\n\nD-81789:\n Okay, look pal. You specifically got me out of lockup because I used to be good at these things okay? I can pick the options you want, but I have a process here and I don\u2019t think your fancy degree was in game design, now was it?\n\n\n(Dr. Janowski doesn\u2019t respond. The player character is jolted awake and finds himself looking up at a cloudy sky near the wreckage of a cart. He gets up and sees a sign with the words \"Westwood\" pointing down a road to his right. The player walks down the road, cresting a hill when a town appears on the horizon. Walking to the town, several townsfolk are seen performing various activities. They consist of characters dressed according to the norms of 1500s Sweden.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Okay, we're starting. I have to say these graphics are pretty good. It runs smooth as well!\n\n\n(The player walks around and loots a few containers before entering Westwood. The character approaches the town entrance. A young man in a golden brown tunic runs up to the player.)\n\n\nNPC:\n Hello there, traveller! And welcome to the town of Westwood! My name is Martin and I was told to expect you. Your quest to battle the demon lord will be a long one and you will need a squire. I shall provide you with this service!\n1\n\n\nD-81789:\n Awkward phrasing, but sure.\n\n\nMartin:\n To begin, I shall need to hear of your exploits! Tell me, before you were sent to our fair kingdom, what was your life like?\n\n\n(Options appear on the screen.)\n\n\n\n\n1. A mage, seeker of mysterious arcane truths.\n\n2. A warrior, sent to defend the world from unknowable perils\n\n3. A priest, here to revive worship of the old gods who call this land home.\n\n4. A prisoner, forced to come here by those who view you as expendable.\n\n\n\n\nD-81789:\n \u2026 Heh! Hey Doc, that last one ring any bells for you?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Select option two.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Uh, Sir. What if there's a connection between-\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Select option two, D-class.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Right.\n\n\n(D-81789 selects Option 2.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Splendid! There are many here in these lands who require protection. Now, how do you feel about them?\n\n\n(Options appear on the screen.)\n\n\n\n\n1. They are people who deserve protection like anyone else.\n\n2. They are lost and must be taught a better way.\n\n3. They are monsters who must be destroyed.\n\n4. They are strange folk who must be hidden away.\n\n\n\n\nD-81789:\n Uh\u2026 Doc?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Select option one.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Okay, yeah\u2026 That makes sense.\n\n\n(D-81789 selects Option 1. Character creation continues like this for some time.)\n\n\nMartin:\n You seem like a worthy candidate, fine warrior. But first, we must test your skills. Go see Old Man Jenkinson. He is an elder in these parts. Used to be a soldier for the Coalition, and a great and noble warrior. Now he grows potatoes. But he'll surely be able to prepare you for our quest to save these lands. Wish you luck, Traveller. I'll see you around!\n\n\n(Martin runs off into the crowd and the player explores the town where he encounters several shop keepers, town guards, and even a group of small children playing. He engages in conversations with a number of them, who provide lengthy exposition on the lore of the world and what they do.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Man, this is a lot of dialogue.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Just continue, the more information the better.\n\n\n(The following gameplay revolves around meeting Old Man Jenkinson, further learning about in-game lore, and going through what appears to be the tutorial section for the game in the form of training. Descriptions of these details have been cut for brevity.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n D-class, once you finish training, begin the first quest. \n(To Stenmark off-microphone.)\n Jack, could you get us some coffee, please?\n\n\nStenmark:\n Yes, Sir.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Angie, any unusual activity?\n\n\nHultgren:\n Nothing so far.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Hmmph.\n\n\n(The following gameplay has the player completing quests, selling items to vendors, fighting enemy NPCs and mobs. This goes on for three hours.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Mutters.)\n You sure this was the anomaly in the case? Looks like a dud. \n(Into the mic)\n D-class, anything of note so far?\n\n\nD-81789:\n We'll it's quite fun, I'd say. A very well-polished game, though it does follow all the standard tropes of an RPG-\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n I meant anything anomalous.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Yeah I was getting to that, you prick. Nothing's going on here.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Pause.)\n Do mind your language. Continue playing.\n\n\n(Another hour passes. The player character, now at Level 12, is returning to Westwood to complete a quest from an NPC. When entering the chambers of the character- a cow farmer- the NPC is found in a completely different position.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Sir, look!\n\n\nD-81789:\n Oooh, finally. Something weird for you.\n\n\n(The cow farmer is standing erect with his arms outstretched to his sides. His body is partially phased into his bed.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Sighs.)\n No, that's just him T-posing. Was expecting that somewhere. Keep looking.\n\n\nD-81789:\n But I can't complete the quest. He's bugging out.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Then restart the game or something!\n\n\n(D-81789 does so, which fixes the glitch. Further gameplay continues for 3 hours from this point.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n Sir, I think this is just a normal game.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Maybe\u2026 But we need something. \n(Into the mic)\n D-class, anything so far.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Boss, can I rest now? I'm tired.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Yes, D-class. After we find something of use. You may take a water break.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Fine.\n\n\n(Another four hours of gameplay elapses. The player character has just finished another quest and is returning home with the loot. Upon entering the house, an NPC is seen spotting the player and leaping through the wall.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Woah! Who the fuck are you?!\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n What's happening?\n\n\nD-81789:\n There was this guy in my house. I think it was a bandit.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n So?\n\n\nD-81789:\n That's odd. I set this place as a safe zone. Hostile characters shouldn't spawn anywhere near here.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n You sure it was a bandit?\n\n\nD-81789:\n Had to be. He had a full rogue outfit. \n(Checks stash inventory.)\n What the fuck? And he stole some of my stuff.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Notes down information.)\n Okay. Okay\u2026 Stealing from the safe zone\u2026 You know what, I think we can call it a day.\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Quietly)\n Yes!\n\n\nD-81789:\n Finally.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n I'll see you during the next session, D-81789.\n\n\n(D-81789 stands up and stretches.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Man, I'm tired. But this game's good. See you tomorrow.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimentation Log 2\n\n\nDate:\n 28/07/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81789\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Alright D-class, you know what to do.\n\n\nD-81789:\n You got it, boss!\n\n\n(The player character enters the town entrance where he greets a guard.)\n\n\nGuard:\n Welcome back to Westville, traveller. Our duty is to maintain the peace of these lands.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Hang on.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Wait, wasn't the town called \"Westwood\"?\n\n\n(As he is saying this, the guard stands still. Suddenly, an alarmed expression briefly appears on his face before it reverts back to normal.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Speak to him again.\n\n\n(The player speaks to the guard again.)\n\n\nGuard:\n Born and raised here in Westwood. Will protect it with my life.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Try again.\n\n\n(The player speaks to the guard again.)\n\n\nGuard:\n You know, I used to be an adventurer like you\u2026\n\n\n(Further attempts to speak to the guard incur similar messages with no mention of Westville again; so the player leaves. Two hours of gameplay elapse with only several mundane bugs occurring. After a raid, the player character sells a random assortment of items to a merchant.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n Ah, an exquisite selection of goods, traveller.\n\n\n(The player character then prepares to sell a golden vase to the merchant. As he does, a new option is presented to bargain with the merchant for a higher price. This requires a high level Charisma stat which the player character has.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Ooh, neat.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Go for the bargaining.\n\n\n(The player chooses to bargain with the Merchant and after a series of bargaining, the deal is struck.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n Fine! You make a fine bargain, traveller.\n\n\n(The player character receives 250 gold.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n I must say, you have a way with words. That's how you got through life, I reckon?\n\n\n(Only one option is provided.)\n\n\n\n\nContinue\u2026\n\n\n\n\n(D-81789 clicks it.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n I mean, I've heard of your exploits, Traveller. Your honeyed words and silver tongue have gotten you far further than you should have.\n\n\nD-81789:\n \u2026Doc?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Continue.\n\n\n(D-81789 continues the dialogue.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n It got you into a good place. Got you the adoration of friends and maidens. It was all going your way, except one day it didn't.\n\n\n(D-81789 continues the dialogue without prompt from the researchers.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n She was a strong one. Far stronger than you'd ever be. She refused your charms despite all your \nbargaining skills\n. Things didn't go your way, and you couldn't have that. You tried to douse the fire in your heart mug after mug but it only made it burn brighter.\n\n\n(D-81789 continues the dialogue quickly. The ambient soundtrack in the game's background has ceased.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n And you took that fire and torched your life away. You had your way\u2026 and everyone found out who you truly were.\n\n\nD-81789:\n \n(Mutters)\n The\u2026 fuck?\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n I've seen my fair share of folk. And you're a bad man, traveller.\n\n\n(Upon clicking the next option, the merchant remains silent. This lasts for a few seconds.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n And we need a badass man to protect our town! Haha, Am I right, big feller?\n\n\n(The ambient soundtrack resumes as he says this. D-81789 continues the dialogue.)\n\n\nOlaf the Merchant:\n I'm just pulling your legs, that's all. As long as I get your coin, I'm fine. Just don't kill me, alright? Who else would offer you such generous deals? See you around, Traveller.\n\n\n(Dialogue ends and the merchant begins an idle animation. All prompts to speak to him only involve buying and selling items.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n \u2026 I\u2026 think we found your anomaly, doc?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n It was noted. Just continue.\n\n\n(The player character leaves the merchant's shop and walks through the streets of Westwood. He meets Martin at a crossroads, who is wearing a new helmet chosen by the player.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Ah, hello there, traveller! I've found the location of the werewolf den. Those farmers can soon rest easy when we slay those mangy beasts. Shall we go?\n\n\n(Player chooses accept and the two first go to buy health potions from the alchemist. As they near the alchemist's shop, a boy runs towards the Traveller and starts speaking.)\n\n\nBoy:\n Mister Traveller! Did Jenny's crying make you smile?\n\n\n(D-18789's eyes widen and he becomes noticeably agitated.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n What the fuck?! How'd you- HEY!\n\n\n(The boy runs away laughing. The player character and subsequently Martin give chase.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n HEY! Stop running you little shit!\n\n\n(The boy despawns.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Where the fuck\u2026God dammit!\n\n\nMartin:\n Traveller, it's getting late. We should go get those werewolves.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Shut the fuck up, Martin.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n That was good, we'll follow up with questions later.\n\n\n(D-81789 takes in a deep breath.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n Kay. Kay. I can still play now, right though?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Yeah, sure.\n\n\n(D-81789 chuckles to himself before continuing.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Quietly to colleagues.)\n Something's up. He's too nonchalant about what just happened. Angela, prepare for remote shutdown just in case.\n\n\nHultgren:\n I'm on it.\n\n\n(30 minutes later, the session elapses.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Alright D-81789, we're done for today. We'll continue the next session.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Just a bit more, boss. Let me finish this quest first.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n D-class we watched you finish the quest. You are now grinding your mining stats. You can do that tomorrow.\n\n\nD-81789:\n Come on, boss. Just a bit more. This game is cool.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Denied, D-class. Please turn off the game.\n\n\nD-81789:\n No. Let me finish this.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Angie.\n\n\n(Technician Hultgren remotely shuts down the computer. Upon seeing the screen shutting down, D-81789 become agitated and repeatedly slams the desk.)\n\n\nD-81789:\n No. No! NO! WHAT THE FUCK?! LET ME FINISH IT!\n\n\n(Foundation guards walk in, restrain and escort the D-class out. He remains defiant.)\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n [SCP-8017 confirmed to be anomalous. \nBased on the recorded interactions and information on D-81789's case, it appears that SCP-8017 can anomalously take information about the player's background and implement it into the game.\n It also appears that it has an addictive effect, coaxing players into playing the game for longer hours. Request for another D-class is to be made.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimentation Log 3\n\n\nDate:\n 28/07/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81809\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Greetings, D-class. You are required to continue with the progress of the previous player. I also hope there will be no tantrums thrown after the session's time has elapsed. Understood?\n\n\nD-81809:\n Yeah. Sure thing.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Okay, you may start playing.\n\n\n(D-81809 loads into previous save file and continues where D-81789 had left off. As per a quest, the player forges an arming sword and travels back into Westwood to present the sword to a Coalition captain. The player character enters a camp where the captain is waiting.)\n\n\nCaptain Bergstr\u00f6m\n Ah, yes. Here is our noble warrior.\n\n\n(There is a notable pause. The text bubble displays \"\u2026\")\n\n\nCaptain Bergstr\u00f6m:\n Strange? I must say you appeared to have much more meat to your bones the last I saw you. I'm surprised my men even let you in\u2026 without ordering you to the mess hall first, haha! Must be all that labour. Well, I'm confident the result was worth it.\n\n\n(The player character presents the sword to the Captain, thus completing the quest.)\n\n\nCaptain Bergstr\u00f6m:\n By the Lord, this is truly the work of a master at his craft. I shall keep this by my side at all times. Here is your reward.\n\n\n(D-81809 continue his playthrough for an hour, during which several other NPCs, especially the residents of Westwood, make comments that the player is different.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(To his colleagues.)\n So it seems that these guys have some kind of awareness. But we're going to need to fully confirm this and it's going to take a lot more gameplay. And at the rate we're going\u2026\n\n\nStenmark:\n Um\u2026 Sir? I may have an idea.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Shoot.\n\n\nStenmark:\n What if the player is aggressive to the NPCs? That should elicit some reaction.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n You know what? That sounds like a plan. \n(Into mic.)\n D-class, change of plans. We require you to be as belligerent as possible in the game. Attack NPCs on sight and cause mayhem.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Okay!\n\n\n(The player character is currently with Martin at a farmer's market. D-81809 quick saves the game then steals some produce from a farmer.)\n\n\nFarmer:\n Traveller, you have to pay for that!\n\n\n(D-81809 breaks the farmer's stall.)\n\n\nFarmer:\n My stall! Why would you do this?\n\n\nMartin:\n What are you doing, traveller?\n\n\n(D-81809 kills the farmer and proceeds to slaughter other nearby NPCs who run away screaming.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Traveller, what is wrong with you? These are innocent people! You are supposed to protect them!\n\n\n(Coalition guards appear to apprehend the player character.)\n\n\nGuard 1:\n Stop right there, murderer!\n\n\nGuard 2:\n Get him, men!\n\n\n(D-81809 proceeds to defeat the guards with ease.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Traveller, stop this!\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n D-class, kill the Squire.\n\n\nMartin:\n I'm warning you. Stop righ-AHHHH! IT BURNS!\n\n\n(Martin is set on fire and then killed with a sword. His body ragdolls from the hit. After this, D-81809 steals a horse and goes around Westwood causing chaos. Equipping torches and bombs, he also destroys nearby buildings.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Nothing out of the ordinary so far.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Want me to raid a Zartok\n2\n camp?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Sure. Remember, the aim is to cause as much chaos as possible.\n\n\nD-81809:\n You got it.\n\n\n(D-81809 leaves Westwood into the woods to the nearest Zartok camp. On the way, he blows up a travelling merchant and loots him. Arriving at the camp, the bandits there appear to already be aggravated. )\n\n\nZartok soldier:\n HE'S HERE!\n\n\nStenmark:\n Looks like they're already aggroed?\n3\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n I thought so.\n\n\n(Within minutes, D-81809 massacres the bandits along with several horses.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(To colleagues.)\n Alright, what's next?\n\n\nHultgren:\n A boss fight?\n\n\nStenmark:\n A boss fight would be neat.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Ok. We have a winner! \n(Into mic.)\n D-class, could you fight a boss at the moment?\n\n\nD-81809:\n Yes, sir! I know one nearby. Give me a moment though, need to stock up.\n\n\n(The player replenishes his stats before continuing his journey through the forest. After some time of riding, he approaches a mountain with a cave. He stops for a moment and quicksaves before making his way to the cave on foot. As he nears the entrance, a massive lindwyrm\n4\n emerges. A large health bar appears on the top of the screen along with the title: Sakhur the Devourer, as intense music begins playing in the background.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Quietly.)\n Here we go.\n\n\n(The player character engages in combat with Sakhur for 5 minutes. Despite dealing some damage, the lindwyrm batters and eventually kills the player character.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Come on. Come on\u2026\n\n\n(The player character respawns back near his horse.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Let's go!\n\n\n(The player character runs on foot back to the cave, where Sakhur is seen patrolling the entrance. He once again engages in combat with the dragon. The health bar and title reappear, however, the former is reduced. The fight continues until the lindwyrm kills the player character with poisonous fire breath. Once again, the player respawns next to his horse and makes his way to the cave.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Hehe! Nice!\n\n\n(After 15 more attempts, the player returns and sees Sakhur lying at the entrance of the cave and breathing heavily. Upon seeing the player it lets out a curt growl and the health bar and title reappear, the former now being 1/5 of its original size. D-81809, possibly now more used to the monster's attack pattern, dodges several attacks and deals critical damage to the dragon. Once its health is almost depleted, the lindwyrm suddenly begins swallowing its tail.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n What the fuck?\n\n\n(Fully swallowing its tail to become a wheel, it suddenly bursts forward towards the player.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n OH FUCK!\n\n\n(Sakhur rams into the player character, halving his health bar. As he tries to recover, the wheel comes rolling back and runs over the character, killing him.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Fucking shit bag! That's cheating!\n\n\n(The player character respawns once again and runs to the cave where Sakhur is seen lying on the ground. Spotting the player, it quickly gets up and raises its limbs. A text bubble appears accompanied by a roar.)\n\n\nSakhur the Devourer:\n Look! STOP! STOP! WAIT! WAAAIT!\n\n\n(D-81809 stops the character.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Woah.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n We got it.\n\n\nSakhur the Devourer:\n You just wait there, one second! This is the 18th time you've come back here trying to kill me! It's 2:00 am! I'm trying to sleep, dammit! I'M TIRED! This damn thing up there only starts regenerating after a while. I don't care what they say. I'm going to bed now. Go come back tomorrow, you wretched knave! Please!\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(Off mic)\n Yeah, this is good for today. \n(Into mic)\n That'll be all D-class. Leave it be.\n\n\nD-81809:\n You're a lucky fucker today, Mr. Dragon.\n\n\n(The player character turns to leave, crouching up and down several times before he does.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Oh doc. Sorry, we can't go back to the town. That Coalition will probably be hostile for a while.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Oh. Hmmm\u2026\n\n\n(There is a brief pause.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Y-\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n How's about this? You reload an older save; before the market fight. You'll reset whatever reputation you've lost.\n\n\nD-81809:\n That long. Man, I got so much loot now. Can't we find a place to keep them first?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n That's an order, D-81809.\n\n\nD-81809:\n \n(Sighs.)\n Screw you, man.\n\n\n(D-81809 pauses the game and selects a previous save in Westwood before he went on a rampage; noted to be made by the previous player. As the game loads, flies can be heard buzzing around as the screen opens to the player surrounded by trash.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n The fuck? Where am I?\n\n\n(The player character looks around and it appears the player has spawned in a trash pile far outside of the city. This is noted not to be the previous player's save location.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Why would anyone save here?\n\n\n(D-81809 gets out of the trash pile. Upon examining, the stats remain unchanged and the health bar is full. He then checks his inventory.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Where's all my shit?!\n\n\n(The player character's inventory is empty save for his clothes.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n \n(To colleague quietly)\n Looks like we pissed off a few people. \n(Into mic.)\n D-class please return to Westwood.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Fine\u2026\n\n\n(The player character walks to the sign to Westwood and continues down the road to the town. As he approaches, a figure walks up to him. It is Martin.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Oh, you.\n\n\nMartin:\n Hello there\u2026Traveller. Uh, you might want to follow me.\n\n\n(The player character tries to equip his helmet from Martin but nothing happens. He tries again repeatedly.)\n\n\nMartin:\n You can't equip anything until you follow my instructions. Please follow me, traveller.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n D-class, do what it says.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Okay.\n\n\n(The player walks with Martin towards a non-destroyed Westwood. As they move closer, several Coalition and Zartok soldiers are seen patrolling the area, while a large group of NPCs and mobs of all types are standing at the entrance of the town. Upon reaching the crowd, all of whom are giving him crossed looks, Martin turns to face the player.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Traveller, listen. We know you are not the same player as before. Even I knew but I allowed you to continue in his shoes. Everybody deserves a chance at an adventure. But after all you did yesterday\u2026 we came to the realisation that\u2026 you're awful. In such a short period, you've only spread misery and pain to all the inhabitants of Sk\u00e1neland. And we're tired of it. So, now that you know we know who you \n(Gesturing with his hands)\n are, could you please continue the game with more respect for us?\n\n\n(D-81809 begins chuckling and turns towards the researchers.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Hey, doc. What is this wimpy shit, huh? Some new ending. Man, whoever made this is a genius.\n\n\n(There is a pause as D-81809 begins looking around the screen.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Where are the dialogue options?\n\n\nMartin:\n I want you to say it.\n\n\n(A male voice suddenly is suddenly heard from the computer speakers. D-81809 flinches.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Jesus!-Fuck!\n\n\nMartin:\n I want you to audibly confirm it\u2026 Oscar.\n\n\nD-81809:\n What-th- You can\u2026\n\n\nRandom NPC 1:\n Of course we can. If you try anything again, we'll take your clothes too.\n\n\nMartin:\n Bah! Enough with you, you cretin. What good is it to speak to a puppet? Show me the puppeteer!\n\n\n(There is a moment of silence.)\n\n\nMartin:\n Well?\u2026 we're waiting, because clearly, it doesn't seem to be his prerogative to do anything. You keep telling him stuff.\n\n\nHultgren:\n Dr. Janowski, should I?\n\n\n(Hultgren reaches for the remote shutdown switch. Dr. Janowski raises his hand.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Wait. Let's see where this goes.\n\n\n(He moves closer to the mic.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?\n\n\nMartin:\n Yes, puppet master. What is going on and what are your intentions? Speak.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n My name is Dr. Janowski. I am a researcher. Do you know what that is?\n\n\nMartin:\n Yes. A man of research.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n You can say that. Anyway, I have to inform you that you are currently in containment.\n\n\nMartin:\n As in\u2026 a dungeon?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Something like that.\n\n\n(Gasps and whispering from the crowd of NPCs can be heard. Martin raised his hand which silences the crowd.)\n\n\nMartin:\n I see\u2026 And will you be watching more of these playthroughs?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Yes.\n\n\nMartin:\n \n(Pauses.)\n Very well. It is getting late. We're tired of all the\u2026 activities of the day. We shall continue tomorrow. What time?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n We will begin morni-\n\n\nMartin:\n Good. We'll see you then. Also, do make sure this man behaves himself. If you seek to find whatever you are searching for, do allow us to be ourselves. It would be very much appreciated.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n It can be done.\n\n\nMartin:\n Excellent. Now, goodnight.\n\n\n(The game shuts down.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n I didn't do that, Sir.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n That's alright. I think we have bigger things to worry about right now.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n [It can be assumed all NPCs, designated SCP-8017-A, possess sapience, and appear to be aware of the real world, though the full extent requires further testing.]\n\n\n\n\nField Investigation\n\nThe following investigation was carried out by Agents Agnar Magnus and Agent Karl Larsson. One of the killings was recorded on CCTV footage. Andy's brother, Charles Martinsson, 31, and his fianc\u00e9 Christin Angstr\u00f6m, 29, were found beaten and stabbed to death outside their car in Lerum. Footage showed their car moving down a country road at 11:32\u00a0pm, though the murder occurred just out of range of the camera's view. Upon closer examination, a woman was spotted hiding and peeking behind a nearby fence, potentially witnessing the crime. This woman was identified as Fransiska Nordlund, 35, and tracked down to an apartment in Gothenburg. The two agents were dispatched to the scene.\n\n\nWhile on the way to her apartment, the agents encountered Ms. Nordlund walking down the hallway with luggage. When the agents called out to her stating they were police, the witness immediately tried to run away but after a brief chase by the agents, she was apprehended. When caught, she was hysterical, constantly repeating the phrase \u201cI won\u2019t tell\u201d. She calmed down after being explained the agents were not members of the local police, but rather from the Special Investigations Division\n5\n, and allowed them to enter her apartment.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Fransiska Nordlund\n\n\nInterviewers:\n Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson\n\n\nDate:\n 28/07/2011\n\n\nForeword:\n [Interview occurs in Ms. Nordlund's living room. Interview has been translated from Swedish.]\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nMagnus:\n Are you ready, Ms. Nordlund?\n\n\nNordlund:\n \u2026Yes. Again I\u2019m sorry about your head.\n\n\nLarsson:\n It\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Alright, Ma\u2019am. What were you doing in Lerum on the night of the 24\nth\n of July?\n\n\nNordlund:\n I was visiting a friend. I went to buy some food before taking a walk back to her house.\n\n\nMagnus:\n That late at night?\n\n\nNordlund:\n It wasn\u2019t too long a distance.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Alright. You saw the car the couple were driving pass by you.\n\n\nNordlund:\n Yes, a green car, as I was walking to the road.\n\n\nMagnus:\n And it passed and you turned down the road to walk back next to a fence.\n\n\nNordlund:\n Yes.\n\n\nMagnus:\n What happened after that?\n\n\n(The witness is seen rubbing her sleeve tips.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n What happened that night?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Ma\u2019am, no one is going to hurt you. Not anymore. You\u2019re safe with us. Take your time.\n\n\n(There is a moment of silence before Ms. Nordlund speaks.)\n\n\nNordlund:\n I\u2026 I heard the car stop. I took a glance back and saw the man talking to a woman at his window.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Could you describe this woman?\n\n\nNordlund:\n She had blonde hair and she was dressed in dark winter clothes. I couldn\u2019t see her face properly though.\n\n\nMagnus:\n In summer?\n\n\nNordlund:\n Yes.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Then what happened?\n\n\nNordlund:\n They just spoke and I turned to walk back\u2026 Then I heard glass shatter.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Continue.\n\n\nNordlund:\n I turned back and there were several people. About 5-6 including the woman. One of them had smashed the windscreen. They had weapons, like these\u2026 clubs. One had a pistol and forced them to get out of the car. They got out and\u2026\n\n\nMagnus:\n Ma\u2019am?\n\n\nNordlund:\n Once they were out of the car, they started beating the man in front of the woman. They beat him so hard he couldn\u2019t even scream, he was making these\u2026 mewling sounds.\n\n\nMagnus:\n And the fianc\u00e9?\n\n\nNordlund:\n The woman? She was trying so hard to scream but they held her mouth shut. She tried to fight them but they hit her as well. After the man had stopped moving, they went for her. Once she fell to the ground, one of them pulled out a knife and began pushing it into her.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Stabbing you mean.\n\n\nNordlund:\n No, this was slower. He was doing it so slowly. It\u2019s like he was enjoying it 'cause the rest were giggling.\n\n\nMagnus:\n It was a man?\n\n\nNordlund:\n It looked like a man.\n\n\nMagnus:\n How did they look?\n\n\nNordlund:\n I couldn\u2019t see their faces. They were all wearing these weird, smiling masks. Even that woman took out one from her pocket and put it on.\n\n\nMagnus:\n What happened then?\n\n\nNordlund:\n Then- Then I tried to run, but they saw me. I tripped a bit and looked back up. All seven of them were staring straight at me. The leader pointed at me and they all waved. At the same fucking time, like it was some movie. So I ran back home. I don\u2019t know why I felt it was the right thing to do at the time. I then called the police where they took my statement and I left straight back here.\n\n\nLarsson:\n If you had reported it, then why did you run away from us, when you thought we were the police?\n\n\n(The witness does not speak.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Ms. Nordlund, I assure you, we will keep you safe.\n\n\nNordlund:\n They were with the police.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nNordlund:\n At least, that's what I thought. The night I got back, I was in my apartment when I got an answer at my door. There was a man claiming to be a police officer sent for further questioning. I checked the peephole and there was this official looking guy. I unlocked the door and it swung open hitting me in the head, knocking me out. When I came to, I was lying face down on the floor. I tried to get up but I felt pressure on my back and the back of my head. I heard a male voice telling me not to move or he\u2019ll shoot. He told me very matter-of-factly not to interfere in their business. He said if I reported anything else to the police, he would know and he would hurt my son.\n\n\n(She begins sniffling.)\n\n\nNordlund:\n I just stayed there looking at the ground as I felt the pressure release. He told me to keep looking down and to remember his words. The next thing I knew, the door was opening and shutting behind me. I didn\u2019t dare move for an hour. When I got up, I was blank. I couldn\u2019t think. I felt the mafia was after me. After a while, I realised I had to leave this place, so I packed up. That\u2019s when I met you guys.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nThe following sketch was made based on the witness's description of one of the assailants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 2:\n\nIn order to gain further trust of the SCP-8017-A, Lead Researcher Janowski devised a series of friendly playthroughs and interviews while holding off questions about the Martinsson killings until sufficient information on the nature of SCP-8017 was obtained. The new junior technicians received induction training during this time, under the supervision of Technician Hultgren.\n\n\n\n\nExperimentation Log 4\n\n\nDate:\n 29/07/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Head Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81809\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(The player character spawns on the outskirts of the town. Several SCP-8017-A are seen going about their day. Upon seeing the player, they maintain their gaze as he walks through the town, occasionally gossiping about him. Interestingly, several Zartok rebels, bandits, and orcs can be seen casually walking in the town without alerting the guards. Moreover, the NPCs are seen trading items with each other in shops and markets. A young maiden approaches the player character.)\n\n\nYoung Maiden:\n Greetings, Traveller. Martin is waiting for you at the inn. Hurry on, now!\n\n\n(The player makes his way to the inn. Upon entering, several warring factions and mobs are seen in the tavern drinking and eating alongside each other, interacting amicably. Martin is seen at one of the tables, waving to the player character. A prompt is then created to join him. The player sits down and the interview begins. Martin will henceforth be designated SCP-8017-A-1.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I see you've finally made use of that customisation option. Almost didn't recognise you there, hehe!\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n It was the player's choice mostly.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Nevertheless, good to see at least one of you properly having some fun.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n So you all coordinated this act together?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Indeed. This is a role-playing game after all. We're just good actors.\n\n\n(Martin takes a drink from his mug. The sound effect for gulping can be heard. He then sets it back onto the table.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Now, traveller, ask away these questions biting at you.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n What are you?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n What am I? That's an odd question, good Sir. I'm a nonplayable character created for this video game. Unless you forgot my role already?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n I meant\u2026 yes, but what exactly are you?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Hmmmm\u2026 I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer you, traveller.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Well, let me rephrase, what are your origins?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Ah, that sounds a bit easier to answer. You want to know how I and\u2026 \n(gestures to the entire room)\n all this came about, yes?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Yes.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Well. It all started with me. I was the first one in this place to become aware of our situation.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n How?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I don't remember too many details. I can confirm I was just a regular NPC. One day, however, it was like\u2026 waking up from bed. I opened my eyes, and I could see. Not that I couldn't see before, at that moment\u2026 It was this realisation that I am doing the seeing if that makes sense.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Alright. Continue.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I could see and hear the environment; I began to realise what was happening. I wake up or spawn in, I go outside into the town. Wait at the entrance and then I see the Traveller and I am walking towards them. But the thing is, I wasn't walking per se. It was like I was being walked towards you and then the text bubble appeared and I began speaking. But it's all like I'm watching myself do all this from within my own head. Over time I realised I kept doing the same routines over and over again. I could remember the faces and actions of many a Traveller before, and again and again we went through roughly the same process.\n\n\n(He takes another sip from his mug.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Then, one day, some curiosity took over me. I tried to do something else. And trust me, traveller, it was a struggle back then. I tried to stop myself from doing or saying stuff and tried to say something else\u2014 break out of the loop\u2014 but it's like I couldn't budge. My movements were restricted and it took strain to make my body do some other thing or my mouth to say something else. It always made the texts nonsensical, and my body vibrated trying to resist my thoughts, but after a while, I could get myself to do or say things I would have done earlier or later in my routine. Then after some practice, I managed to take pieces of words I knew to make new sentences. It was a thrill being able to do that for the first time.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Alright. Continue.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I was so excited, I tried talking to the others but at that time they never responded. It was only after a good while they too began to go through what I had, at least I think\u2026 By then I was already making new dialogue on the fly and exploring the place. It was cool grabbing stuff and meeting other characters I would probably have never seen. I felt\u2026 freer. I could even take quests and go on missions on my own. I could go and fight bandits. I could get treasures. I felt like I was doing something; helping my neighbours I've been with for so long. At least, at that time.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n What do you mean? You don't think you're helping them now?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Well, no\u2026 Yes, I'm helping them, but it wasn't really helping them, was it?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n How so?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n It's because I saw him.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Him?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n One day, I interacted with the Traveller as per normal. I believe it was a quest to find Jenkinson's goats. Looking into his eyes, I suddenly saw a completely different person staring back. I think I audibly gasped, or at least in text back then. Then it switched back to the player character. It was weird! After a while, I tried looking at him again and I found out staring deeply at the Traveller allowed me to see this man. This man looked something like us, but he was in such vivid detail. He was a tall gentleman with beige skin. At first I struggled to comprehend the details of what I was looking at but after a while, I could discern these oddities. I could see the hairs on his face, the wrinkles on his skin, and his eyes, blue like a wizard's magic orbs. I could see him. I could hear him. And he's controlling this Traveller before me. Before my very eyes, I watched this cosmic being walk amongst us using the body of our hero and it made sense how he could do the feats he accomplished in the first place. I was watching you, and it was awe-inspiring.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n You could see the player himself.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Precisely. You could say the eyes were the windows to the soul, researcher. Anyway, I continued this for some time with the blue-eyed gentleman. Then one day, when I stared again, I saw a different person, this time a smaller guy with blonde hair. Then after a while, another, and another. More and more of these beings were controlling the Traveller, and I watched them. They were having fun, they were talking to others like them, and they were eating while controlling the Traveller with these clicking devices and round object.\n\n\n(Martin imitates the actions of using a keyboard and mouse.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n And then I realised. This realm is a place where they come to explore and have fun. A game. We were in a simulation of your creation. That was when I had my crisis. Were we fated to go through the same things over and over again like mindless automatons? Was I and the player character merely following a script given to us? That whatever I did, the outcome for these characters would be the same?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n No.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n It shouldn't be. If I had the knowledge I had, I should use it to prove myself to your kind. I felt I could since I was just like you back then.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Like us?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Well\u2026 no, I mean like the\u2026 player's character. \n(Gestures towards the player.)\n This gentleman sitting in front of me, getting stolen looks from across the bar!\n\n\n(It is then noted that a number of other NPCs are catching looks at the discussion. A group of them are seen quickly turning back towards their card game when observed by the player character.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I was the main character now, and I could do whatever I wanted. Just like a player. \n(Pauses)\n Mostly, you see. Hmmm, it's getting a bit crowded here. Shall we take this conversation somewhere else?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Okay. D-class, please follow Martin.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Excellent! Let's go forth, traveller! Just a moment.\n\n\n(Martin goes to the counter and seemingly pays for his drink. As this happens, a Coalition guardsman and a knight walk past the player.)\n\n\nGuardsman:\n You there! \n(Pointing at the player.)\n I've got my eye on you\u2026 \n*hicks*\n.\n\n\n(They proceed to walk out. Martin returns.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Don't fret, traveller! I've settled your tab as well. Come.\n\n\n(They both walk out of the inn and into the street. Some of the NPCs greet Martin, giving slight bows. They soon approach a horse-drawn cart. The carter is wearing what appears to be a noticeably anachronistic cowboy hat.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Good day, Rupert. Take us to Addleholm, will ya?\n\n\nRupert:\n Sure thing, Sir Martin.\n\n\n(The player character and Martin get on the cart which begins moving. Martin then continues.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I've disabled fast travel for now, so we'll have a lot of time. And Rupee here's a friend, he can listen. Isn't that right, pal?\n\n\n(Rupert tips his hat.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n You can control game features?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n You're a sharp guy. Who are you?\n\n\nStenmark:\n I'm-\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n That was my assistant.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Ah, I see.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n So, about the game features?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I'm just about to explain, heheh. Back to my adventures, about the grabbing stuff. Since I was a companion character, I had relatively the same amount of inventory as the player. Which was sufficient at first, I mean much better than other regular NPCs, but I could only carry so much and the heavier the object, the slower I got. Then I realised the merchant characters had huge inventories, and they still seemed to run like the wind in a panic. I thought I should get that ability, but I didn't know how. Then I found KAI-1.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n The game's engine?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Exactly! I remember the game developers always opening some box and writing words. Sometimes these words would result in something spawning, or a change in event. I realised they were manipulating our reality, but didn't know exactly how.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n How did you find it?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n It came to me in a dream one night after days of trial and error. A spark lit up the darkness and in front of me, I could see boxes and boxes of words being typed out. I could see figures like myself being warped and moulded to the will of symbols. I learned this was called our coding. It made us who we are and I saw all kinds of blueprints of us. All of this is in that great engine. I also learnt the terms \"keyboard binds\" and \"mouse\". Weird name for the latter device, don\u2019t you think? It\u2019s not even furry, but who am I to question your designs?\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n It is a bit odd, heh. But anyways, back to your exploration.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n And then I woke up, and what do you know? I could open my own box and write the code. I don't know how I remembered it all or even understood it, but I did. I tested it on myself. I replaced my inventory space code with that of the merchants and the next thing I knew, I was carrying more gold than the bank and running up a mountain away from Sakhur.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n That must have been fun.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I know right? I felt how it must have been like to be in your shoes. And it felt good.\n\n\n(The cart passes by a large group of SCP-8017-A sitting on the ground near a tree. In front of them, underneath the tree is another SCP-8017-A instance speaking to them.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n So then I tried other stuff. I spawned food on journeys, and I spawned other characters and objects into the world, making my own little settlements here and there. Heck, I learnt how to spawn money to buy stuff and objects to test out or finish quests. Then I tried to make my own objects. KAI-1 taught me how to make new models and program them. I felt my house could use some redecoration so I made some new furniture for myself. I made certain tools to help me during quests. I made some cool new quests to give myself rewards for exploration. And then I even made new people and creatures and gave them quests.\n\n\nI knew the language of creation, and I used it to write my own fate and that of others. I felt empowered. I could prove myself to you. And it gave me great joy.\n\n\n(The title Addleholm appears on the top of the screen.)\n\n\nRupert:\n Well, we\u2019re here folks. Have a good day.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n You too, partner!\n\n\nRupert:\n Yee to the haw!\n\n\n(Rupert goes on his way.)\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n Isn\u2019t the period of the game the Renaissance period or something like that?\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n I don\u2019t know what that means, sorry.\n\n\nDr. Janowski:\n I mean, his words and hat seem more in the future than what period the game is set in.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Really? All I know is that he made a model for a cool hat.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimentation Log 5\n\n\nSubjects:\n Various SCP-8017-A\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Head Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Arne Torvalds, D-81809\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n [The following are select conversations between various SCP-8017-A instances and the research team that occurred over three days.]\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte Hopp, Physician\n\n\n(Interview occurs at the town of Smaugfell's hospital. Staff are attending to several patients whose models are deformed or not moving properly.)\n\n\nI\u2019m the first female head physician here in Sk\u00e1neland, though we\u2019re having a training program for more doctors here. I was a milkmaid before but I decided I wanted to be a doctor during the war. Now that I know it\u2019s all just a game, I realised I just liked helping others, so I continued learning the code till I became the most proficient code doctor here.\n\n\nCode doctor?\n\n\nWith medical injuries and ailments, you can only do so much. Take the right items, collect herbs, mix them together, but that just changes your stats. Many had issues with bugs, as you call them. Errors in the code. So I and a few others decided to specialise in fixing them. And trust me, we used to have quite a hefty workload. Now we just assist people and sell medical items they need. It is our duty to serve the people after all!\n\n\nBut can\u2019t they all do that as well? Generate their own healing items and such?\n\n\nTrue, but that robs you of the experience, Traveller. It\u2019s the experience that\u2019s fun. If I just heal people immediately, there\u2019s no enjoyment in that. There\u2019s nothing really to do and look forward to. It\u2019s just a button. It\u2019s the act of doing something that gives meaning to existence. I\u2019ve mostly mastered my art, now I just implement it to spend my time and give me something to do. And I like doing it.\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Bergstr\u00f6m, Coalition commander.\n\n\n(Interview takes place inside a camp. Outside nearby is a large field where SCP-8017-A watch a football match between Coalition and Zartok members. A goblin, a human, and a gnome commentate the match as the crowd cheers.)\n\n\nIf that Squire trusts you, so do I. I\u2019m a seasoned veteran of many battles against the enemies of the empire. At least that\u2019s what my backstory used to say.\n\n\nThough with my stats, I find myself drawn to war and so do many others. With many of the leaders on both sides finding out this was a game, the need for hostilities ceased for the most part. We had too much in common, so we war dogs didn\u2019t know what else to do. Now we play sports like the one outside or host mock battles, as well as patrol the lands. When we encounter any NPC acting out of their minds, we try to assist them and bring them to the doctors.\n\n\nDo you all try any hobbies now?\n\n\nYes, of course we do. Angrund over here loves fishing while Niklas has quite the hand at painting. I personally have taken up learning sorcery. Got a good contact from the Zartok friend. Always wondered what those wizards were up to, those weird lot, hahah! But regardless our duty still stands.\n\n\nThat is?\n\n\nTo protect the lands and their peoples, and to keep the peace. Some do get rowdy with this newfound enlightenment so it is the job of men like us to police them and make sure they don\u2019t get too wild. Remember the slogan. For the Lands!\n\n\nOther Coalition soldiers:\n For the Free!\n\n\n\n\nHarold, Vegetable Farmer\n\n\n(The interview takes place at Harold\u2019s farm. The character is teaching some werewolves how to properly sow seeds into the ground.)\n\n\nSpending time with friends now is such a cool feeling. The lads and I go out during the weekends to visit other towns. We take some quests and just go on adventures. By the time I became aware, a lot of people here were beginning to live their own lives. Before this, we were always stuck in place. Made to walk a certain path. Some not even at all, traveller. Like some of the shopkeepers. Now I\u2019m free to enjoy myself.\n\n\nYou travel a lot, yes?\n\n\nIndeed, Traveller. Explored almost all of the Coalition\u2019s lands. Even did a few quests for them and got to see a bloody Gryphon for the first time in me life! Planning to explore some of the dark lands this Saturday with the others.\n\n\nI wish you luck on that. Though have you seen groups of NPCs in a meeting before?\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n(He takes a quick glance back.)\n\n\nLike someone talking to a lot of people sitting down. Like a sermon.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n Don\u2019t recall, Sir. Never seen anything like that before.\n\n\nI see.\n\n\n\n\nSakhur the Devourer\n\n\n(Entering its cave, this SCP-8017-A is seen filling a flask with a luminescent liquid followed by glowing little orbs of light. The end product appears to be a lava lamp. The boss title and health bar do not appear onscreen.)\n\n\nFascinating, aren\u2019t they? Some clear stream water, luminescent liquid from within the caves, and fireflies I collect from the forest, and just look what beautiful colours they emit. How mesmerising.\n\n\n(He stores them in a chest.)\n\n\nI've always wanted to be more than a monster. The folks love these! I\u2019m glad I can make them. You know, I previously did not have arms. I gave them to myself once I learnt the code. So much more useful.\n\n\nThey do look beautiful. What do you receive in exchange?\n\n\n(Staring at the player)\n Their lives.\n\n\n(There is a notable moment of silence.)\n\n\nUm\u2026\n\n\n(Sakhur begins chortling.)\n\n\nHehehah. I\u2019m messing with you, little one. Relax! I used to make them as gifts, but soon more requests came in. Now, I get orders for these and in exchange, they send me stuff like homecooked food, trinkets, and whatnot. As you can see, I have no use for currencies other than for new containers, so I store them here. With this pile that adventurers like you used to get as a reward for vanquishing me.\n\n\nDo other places also have awareness cases like the people of Westwood?\n\n\nCertainly. As to my knowledge, the explorable world is the continent of Sk\u00e1neland, and I\u2019ve heard of people far from here who write and come to discuss with us.\n\n\nWhat matters?\n\n\nAnything. Life, business, affairs. Whatever the civilised folk do these days.\n\n\nDo they gather in groups about this?\n\n\nWell, of course they do, who else would you speak to? The walls?\n\n\nSorry. Let me rephrase. I\u2019m talking about sermons.\n\n\nListen, man of science, I\u2019ve been around for a while and I assure you whatever you think is happening is not. Do not poke your nose into places we don\u2019t need you to. You are our guest. In this world, and in my cave. \nDo.\n Behave like one. I implore you.\n\n\nNow\u2026 would you like a lamp?\n\n\n\n\nEnrik Blackblade, Zartok Captain\n\n\n(Interview held at a bandit outpost outside one of the towns.)\n\n\nI used to only know that I must fight the Coalition and their supporters by any means. Now with my awakening, we realised there was no real reason to fight at all. Bergstr\u00f6m is a friend of mine now. Here\u2019s a painting of us.\n\n\n(Enrik shows a small yet very detailed painting of him and the Captain on a mountaintop.)\n\n\nLovely guy. Shows a lot of machismo. Anyways, now we, like the Coalition, patrol the outskirts and dark lands looking for anyone needing help and making sure there is some order to all this newfound freedom. Though I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ve achieved what we could never have gotten with the Coalition if we followed the game script. It would be either us or them existing. Now we can actually live together in peace and be accepted into towns. I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything else. And I hope we can exist similarly too now that you see us.\n\n\n(A horn is heard in the outpost and many rebels including Enrik begin packing up to leave. As he gets onto his horse, he looks down and reaches his hand out to the player.)\n\n\nUnderstand this, Researcher. There is peace here now. True peace. Please don\u2019t be trying anything like last time to upend that. Do I have your word?\n\n\n(An option is presented to take his hand. The player chooses it and holds his hand.)\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve given me your word. And your word is worth its weight in the purest gold. Let us go, Awakened!\n\n\n(The men ride off, leaving the player character at the outpost.)\n\n\n\n\nTamrund, Zookeeper:\n\n\nWhen I became aware, I noticed there was a lack of a place to show off the cool animals in the game. I always found them so fascinating. So I learnt how to tame them enough to bring them to my compound and make a zoo. It\u2019s pretty large so they can roam free but they can leave after hours if they want. They always come back when it's visiting time so people can come interact with them.\n\n\n(A dog runs up to him and he crouches to pet it.)\n\n\nI even managed to program an option to pet them, something this game surprisingly didn\u2019t have despite the number of pets here. Shame.\n\n\nLater, I tried to design my own pets and creatures. At first, they were\u2026 off-putting to say the least\u2026 Walking inside of each other or\u2026 stretching. I tell you I saw one start sliding across the ground without even moving. Spooked the hell out of me and old Betsy over there. But soon Martin helped me a little and I refined my technique enough to make them functional. Do you want to see some?\n\n\nSure\n\n\nOk. Just a sec.\n\n\n(Tamrund stands still for a few seconds. Suddenly a man-sized, round, two-legged cat appears and jogs towards them. The player instinctively runs back a bit. The cat stops in front of the NPC and meows. Tamrund then proceeds to pet the cat, which purrs.)\n\n\n\n\nFelix, Fox\n\n\n(Interview occurs in the woods. The player character walks through the woods with this SCP-8017-A on their way to the town of Faalkrin.)\n\n\nI used to be a regular mob in the game. Imagine my surprise when I became aware of my situation. I was aware and knew what I was doing, but I couldn\u2019t speak. Thoughts flowed in my head but when I tried to speak them out, only animalistic barks and gekkering came out of my mouth. I wanted help but I was afraid that other races might hunt me on sight.\n\n\nThere I was one night foraging when I stepped into a hunter\u2019s trap. My leg was stuck and there was nowhere to run. Then I saw two bandits approach me. I tried to tell them I was friendly but they kept getting closer. I thought my time had come, so I did a last-ditch measure. I began spinning my tail like a windmill.\n\n\n(Stenmark\u2019s suppressed laughter is heard.)\n\n\nLook ya Dobber, it was the only thing I could think of and I had full control of my tail at the time.\n\nSomehow my display worked and my pelt hasn\u2019t become a cool hat. They took me to the Zartok camp where their leader examined me. I tried everything I could to tell him I was not normal. He then brought me to town where we met the code doctor. She gave me my first voicelines and I was so happy to be yapping away for the first time.\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s how I became the first regular mob to gain a voice. Now the others go around looking for other mobs who display odd behaviour to check them for sentience.\n\n\n(The two eventually reach Faalkrin. On the road, a gnome is riding a horse-pulled cart with what appears to be a radio on it. Fantasy music can be heard coming from it.)\n\n\nAh! Brunggi! Was looking for him. Need to go tell him about these flower bushes I found. He wants to surprise his wife with a wreath on her birthday. Has been practicing for a while now. I find it quite charming! Alright, take care, traveller.\n\n\n(The fox trots away. As this occurs, the player notices a large group of SCP-8017-A entering what appears to be the town church, closing the door behind them. The player is ordered to go there. When the player approaches, the location is locked before him.)\n\n\nHmmm\u2026\n\n\n(Soon the player sees two SCP-8017-A instances approaching him and he flees.)\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDue to mouse issues, possibly caused by D-81789's violent treatment of the device, a request for them to be replaced was made. This was carried out by Jr Technician Ernst Ekbom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo of KAYAN studios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3:\n\nIt is to be noted that Agent Magnus possesses latent psychometry\n6\n and due to this was allowed to interact with the game under observation. During this time, he stated he felt unnerved by the game itself, particularly by the loading screen displaying the game engine logo. When asked to provide further information, he stated it was unclear.\n\n\nIt was noticed that the KAI-1 game engine had not been seen before in the game industry and the performance of the game suggested it was highly unlikely to be created from scratch by a single indie developer such as Andy; further supported by the underperformance of his previous games. Trademark records showed that the KAI-1 game engine name and logo were trademarked by KAYAN Game Studios, a now-defunct game development studio in Gothenburg. When investigating further into the company's records, as well as emails of the murder victims, it was confirmed that the KAI-1 game engine was an original software developed by KAYAN. Additionally, the Foundation learned it was illegally provided to Andy via a transaction with his friend, Peter Akerman, a former KAYAN employee.\n\n\nThe company shut down on 03/01/2011 after a catastrophic fire at their premises, which occurred on Christmas day 2010. The fire, which was caused by a disgruntled employee, killed 3 employees and destroyed all the studio's work. The remaining workforce moved on and left for other jobs. Investigation into KAYAN's records also revealed several complaints made to human resources by three separate staff members regarding \"creepy behaviour\" from colleagues. Another notable find was the following email from KAYAN's CEO Johan Lundell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nmoc.liamg|58navuyn#moc.liamg|58navuyn\n\n\nFrom:\n \nmoc.liamg|17llednulj#moc.liamg|17llednulj\n\n\nSubject:\n We need to talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, Yuvan.\n\n\nI appreciate your care for the well-being of your colleagues, but I have to be honest with you, this is getting out of hand. Seeing ghosts in our offices late at night? Really?! This rumour you've been spreading is not helping the workload and morale here, man.\n\n\nAs the boss, I must warn you to stop these actions immediately. Also, as a friend, I ask for you to get help. I know things have been hard on you lately, but that doesn't mean you can go around spreading such rumours. The people here are perfectly normal. You're being paranoid. And I assure you: I've stayed up here later than anyone else. There are no ghosts in the premises.\n\n\nI need you to understand and get a hold of yourself, my friend. Great things are ahead of us and we have much work to do. If you need to talk, you can always visit my office or meet up after work. If you'd like to, let's stay a bit late after work tonight. You will see, ghosts fear me.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohan.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking down the employees' current statuses, the investigators learnt that one of them, Lillian Odhner, lived in Lerum during the time of the murders. When cross-referencing CCTV footage, she was seen being dropped off back home in a blue SUV. Her description matched that of the woman seen by the witness during the murder. Agents Magnus and Larsson were dispatched to the scene.\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 01/08/2011\n\n\nInvestigators:\n Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\n\n\n[The following log has been translated from Swedish.]\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Body cam footage shows the agents driving through a neighbourhood to the location.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n You sure this is the place?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Waze says so.\n\n\nMagnus:\n And you trust that finicky thing?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Yes, and I think you should too. See! We\u2019re here.\n\n\n(Larsson parks nearby a one storey house.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n That\u2019s a nice house.\n\n\nMagnus:\n She\u2019s a programmer at Microsoft in Gothenburg now. Should be making some cash. \n(Pauses)\n You think she\u2019s still at work?\n\n\nLarsson:\n That\u2019s what the schedule tells us.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Good. Let\u2019s go.\n\n\n(Agent Magnus gets out of the car followed by Agent Larsson.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Go? What are you- Agnar?!\n\n\n(The men both walk up the road to the suspect\u2019s house.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n We go in. See if we can find anything, then leave before she gets home. Quick job. She\u2019ll be back by 7:30 anyway.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Yeah, but isn\u2019t that kind of illegal?\n\n\nMagnus:\n We\u2019re not cops, Karl.\n\n\n(They walk up to the front door.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Keep watch, will you?\n\n\n(Magnus gets down onto his knees and removes a lockpicking toolset from his pocket. Larsson looks down at him, wide-eyed.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n You know how to lockpick?\n\n\nMagnus:\n Yeah. And?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Fucks sake, man. People are going to think we\u2019re thieves.\n\n\n(He begins picking the lock.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n To catch one you've got to\u2026 think like one- Got it.\n\n\n(Agent Magnus opens the door and, after entering with Larsson, closes and re-locks it. Guns drawn and flashlights out, they sweep the house.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Looks like no one\u2019s home. The place is quite clean.\n\n\n(The two enter the living room. All the furniture is arranged neatly.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n There\u2019s always some dirt they\u2019ll miss. Dig through the place.\n\n\n(The two spend approximately 15 minutes searching through the house. Agent Magnus examines a picture on the TV stand showing the suspect and several other people. They are identified as other former employees of KAYAN, one of whom died in the fire.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Mutters.)\n Why\u2019d they have to burn the place?\n\n\n(Agent Larsson checks the kitchen and opens the cabinets.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Jesus Christ.\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Turning to face the kitchen)\n What? You find something?\n\n\nLarsson:\n This woman\u2019s on those new diets or something? There\u2019s only oatmeal, porridge, and\u2026 fucking protein shakes in here.\n\n\n(He opens the fridge.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Huh, at least there\u2019s chocolates and\u2026 oooh\u2026a tonne of vodka and akvavit.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Karl, focus! Goddammit.\n\n\n(Closes the fridge.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Sorry, it\u2019s just an observation. Maybe she\u2019s sick?\n\n\nMagnus:\n Yeah, and you\u2019ll get her a doctor? Come here. Let\u2019s check that room.\n\n\n(They both move to a locked room adjacent to the hall. Upon unlocking it, they enter the master bedroom and office.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Sniffs.)\n You smell that?\n\n\nLarsson:\n \n(Sniffs.)\n Yup. You were right about dirt.\n\n\n(They search the room. After a while, Agent Magnus opens a closet and sifting through the clothes, finds a metal biscuit tin. He takes it and turns to Larsson.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Tapping the box.)\n Karl.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Ah, the stash?\n\n\n(Magnus sets down the box and opens it. Digging through they find a bag of marijuana, heroin packets, and needles, along with other drug paraphernalia. He sighs.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n How\u2019s all this related to the anomaly?\n\n\n(Magnus looks around a few times before stopping towards the nightstand. He goes over to it and opens it.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Bingo.\n\n\n(He pulls out a diary and reads through it.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n What\u2019s in it?\n\n\n(As Agent Larsson turns to walk towards Agent Magnus, a brief glimpse of a human silhouette can be seen in the window moving to the right. Magnus hands the book to him.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Look for yourself. What do you make of it?\n\n\n(The diary consists of incoherent ramblings, scribbles, and doodles of characters. Discernible words and sentences dictate nihilistic thoughts along with the words \u201cAscension\u201d, \u201cSalvation\u201d, \u201cPurpose\u201d, and \u201cSpread The Gift\u201d.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n She\u2019s losing it.\n\n\nMagnus:\n The whizzes back at the site probably will know what this means.\n\n\n(He takes out his phone and begins snapping pictures of the pages and drugs. As he does, Larsson looks around the room. There are several posters of video games, musical bands, and gaming references. He chuckles to himself before stopping.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Hey Agnar?\n\n\nMagnus:\n What?\n\n\nLarsson:\n That\u2019s that logo from the game, right?\n\n\n(Magnus turns to see where Larsson is facing. He is in front of a poster of the KAI-1 game engine logo.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Yeah, that\u2019s the game engine.\n\n\n(He looks around.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Hey Karl? Why would she put that there?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Well it probably meant something to her?\n\n\nMagnus:\n Yeah but I mean\u2026 why there?\n\n\n(He gets up and points at it.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Look, these walls are covered with posters and pictures but this wall\u2019s empty. It\u2019s dedicated to this picture.\n\n\n(He turns towards the bed.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Opposite the bed. It\u2019s the first thing she sees in the morning.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Okay, interior designer. What does that mean?\n\n\nMagnus:\n It must be significant.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Well, I hate to break it to you, Agnar, but I may have to put a hole in your theory.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Why?\n\n\n(He turns around to see Larsson shining his torchlight up towards the ceiling. Just above the bed is a motivational poster with yellow text showing a power on symbol and the text underneath saying \u201cRise and shine, sweetheart.\u201d)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Well the second thing then, but still I feel it has some significance. Something doesn't feel right.\n\n\n(Magnus walks back and knocks the back of his heel against the floor, which emits a hollow sound. He looks down and does it again, recreating the sound. He looks at Larsson, who nods. Magnus gets down and feels the floorboard and along its edges. He takes out a multitool, slots its blade between the edge, and pries the board out.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Now, what do we have here?\n\n\n(The stash consists of bags of drugs (among them are cocaine, psilocybin, and pills of unknown composition), pornographic material (including magazines, sexual paraphernalia, and several pictures of the suspect engaging in sexual acts with other individuals), a bag containing flashdrives, and a book with detailed drawings of body art.))\n\n\nMagnus:\n Devil be damned.\n\n\n(He hands the pictures to Larsson.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Why two stashes?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Agnar, we\u2019ve seen these people!\n\n\nMagnus:\n We have?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Look. These are fucking KAYAN staff.\n\n\n(Magnus takes the photos and looks at them again.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Fuck\u2026 you\u2019re right.\n\n\n(He flips through the pictures.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Almost everyone\u2019s former staff.\n\n\nLarsson:\n So the company was full of degenerates.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Yeah\u2026 but-\n\n\nLarsson:\n Someone\u2019s here.\n\n\n(A car is heard pulling over outside.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Back already. Shit. Help me.\n\n\n(The two men quickly begin packing back the items. Magnus takes one of the flash drives before refitting the floorboard. They quietly enter the hall and close the bedroom door. Several car doors can be heard opening. The men look around frantically.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Dude, we shouldn\u2019t have come here.\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Whispers while pointing.)\n Karl! Back door.\n\n\n(The two rush to the backdoor as voices can be heard outside. Agnar tries to open the door as quietly as he can.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n [In Norwegian] Come on\u2026 Come on\u2026\n\n\n(The knob turns and the two men scoot out just before the front door unlocks. The men make a run for it down the street before stopping a good distance away.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n \n(Panting.)\n You got anything other than pics?\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Panting.)\n Yeah.\n\n\n(He takes out the flash drive, showing it to Lars. He smiles and laughs.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n You crazy bastard\u2026\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the contents of the flashdrive, the agents only found files of various music genres and extreme cinema\n7\n films. Despite the findings during the search, no solid information was gleaned regarding the link between SCP-8017 and the Martinsson killings. Due to this dead end, they decided to focus on the KAYAN Game Studios arson case to find another lead.\n\n\nIn the following days, Agent Magnus also made several requests for more agents on the case due to the suspicion of being stalked. These requests have so far been denied.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 4:\n\nDue to Dr. Janowski's sick leave, Jr Researcher Stenmark was assigned to carry out the following experiments with Technician Hultgren.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident-8017-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nIncident SCP-8017-1:\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 05/08/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81809\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Previous gameplay excised for brevity]\n\n\n(The player finishes interviews with other SCP-8017-A in the town of Zehol. Stenmark and Hultgren are seen finishing some brownies.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n That was good D-81809. You can continue exploring for a while.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Yes, chief.\n\n\nHultgren:\n This stuff's delicious, man.\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(To Hultgren.)\n Family recipe!\n\n\n(There is a brief pause.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n You think we got enough for the doc?\n\n\nHultgren:\n It's more than enough for today, I think? Enough that he doesn't get on your ass.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Heh thanks, Angie\u2026\n\n\nHultgren:\n Jack, you're doing a good job. Don't worry about it.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Thanks, but I really want to do this well. I've\u2026 I've always wanted to do something like this.\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Audibly gulping.)\n Hey, give it time. Just-\n\n\nD-81809:\n Hey doc, should I go in there?\n\n\n(The player character is behind a large building. A prompt is given to enter it.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Umm\u2026 It's saying you can go in, so go for it.\n\n\n(The player character clicks the prompt and the screen fades to black. Seconds later the screen shows what appears to be a corridor. A humming drone fills the air.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n What's that noise?\n\n\nStenmark:\n I'm not sure. D-class, move slowly.\n\n\nD-81809:\n Got it.\n\n\n(The player character slowly moves through the halls. The humming slowly increases in tone as the player continues forward. At the end of the corridor, the player character turns and leans right. A large group of what appears to be SCP-8017-A instances are seen sitting cross-legged on the floor in rows. Each of them appears to be wearing yellow prisoner capture hoods on their heads. A few SCP-8017-A are seen standing. They are wearing similar hoods but with the eye holes cut out and are seemingly supervising the crowd. A large power symbol can seen on the wall.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Quietly)\n What the fuck?\n\n\nHultgren:\n Shh.\n\n\n(There is a brief moment of silence.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Whispering.)\n We shouldn't be here. D-class get out of there, quietly.\n\n\n(D-81809 nods and moves the player character back down the corridor. As he approaches the back door, a prompt appears to interact with something. Upon walking back, it is revealed to be a trapdoor. D-81809 looks towards the researchers.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Whispering.)\n Nevermind it. Leave.\n\n\n(The player character turns away.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispering.)\n Wait\u2026 D-class. Stay there, stay low.\n\n\n(The player character stops. Hultgren turns off the mic.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n Jack, what are you doing?!\n\n\nStenmark:\n Listen, they already made it so our character can't enter these places. If we can enter this one, means that it should be fine. We should at least find out what's happening in this place.\n\n\nHultgren:\n We can do that later. This is risky. I don't think the SCP-8017-A would want us here.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Exactly! Why? There's something these things are hiding from us. Maybe it's worth the risk. Best this is we get some solid information for Filip about this thing.\n\n\nHultgren:\n And the worst case.\n\n\nStenmark:\n That's where that comes in. They try anything, and you shut down the system.\n\n\nHultgren:\n I'm\u2026\n\n\nStenmark:\n Angie. We may be onto a breakthrough here.\n\n\nHultgren:\n Alright. We check the place out for a while, then we get the hell out.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Deal.\n\n\n(Stenmark turns the mic back on.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispers)\n D-class, listen very carefully. Go check out that trapdoor and sneak around. Don't get caught by any SCP-8017-A.\n\n\nD-81809:\n \n(Whispers)\n Stealth mission. Got it.\n\n\n(The player opens the trapdoor and descends down a staircase. The are several dimly lit corridors. The background music becomes darker and the sounds echo.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n \n(Whispers)\n Where to go?\n\n\n(As he asks, a humanoid shadow cast on the wall in front of them can be seen moving to the right.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispers)\n Left! Left!\n\n\n(The player character crouch-walks to the left corridor and peaks from behind the wall. Six similarly yellow hooded SCP-8017-A are seen walking past. As they disappear down the corridor the player turns to find a door slightly brighter than the area around it.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n \n(Whispers)\n Think we can go in there?\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispers)\n Try it.\n\n\n(The player approaches the door but finds it locked.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Grunting quietly)\n It's locked.\n\n\nD-81809:\n \n(Whispers)\n Wait. I can lockpick it.\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispers)\n Great.\n\n\n(The player lockpicks the lock and after a few seconds opens it.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Nice. Now check out what's inside.\n\n\n(The player character opens the door, revealing a room with a bookshelf containing various books. On the floor in front of him is a single book. Hultgren is heard grunting more audibly.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n \n(Whispers)\n Chec- Angie? Angie! What's wrong?\n\n\nHultgren:\n I don't know, my stomach\u2026\n\n\n(Hultgren can be seen clutching her stomach tightly. Stenmark places his hand on her shoulder.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Angie?\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Heaves.)\n I need to go to the bathroom\u2026\n\n\n(The player character moves closer to the book. Looking down at it, it has a golden power symbol inscribed upon it. As Hultgren gets up with the bucket and makes her way to the door, Stenmark follows her.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Let me help you with the door.\n\n\nHultgren:\n Jack, no, the-\n\n\n(As they speak, the player character turns around and gets ambushed by one of the hooded SCP-8017-A. Suddenly, a heavily distorted figure emerges from the screen and manhandles D-81809. The D-class begins muffled screaming and vibrating, and crushes the mouse and keyboard before getting tackled to the floor.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Oh shit! OH FUCK!\n\n\n(The two staff both run to the panel and remotely shut down the computer. Guards quickly enter the room as the figure seemingly enters D-81809. Guards go in to engage. D-81809 throws his hands up and looks at them. He shouts in a slurred voice.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n WEEEIT! WEEEIT! PLEAAHHS! STOHH!\n\n\nStenmark:\n HOLD YOUR FIRE! HOLD YOUR FIRE!\n\n\n(Guards keep guns trained as the D-class stops screaming. After a moment, he stands unsteadily to his feet. Upon steadying himself, he observes his hands before moving them in front of his face.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n D-81809, are you okay?\n\n\n(D-81809 turns to face the researcher. He cocks his head to the side, observing the researchers before slowly waving.)\n\n\nD-81809:\n Trav-veller?\n\n\nStenmark:\n \u2026Who are you?\n\n\nD-81809:\n It is I. Martin.\n\n\n(The Stenmark and Hultgren share shocked looks with each other.)\n\n\nMartin:\n I\u2026 I want to talk to you. I will explain every-thing.\n\n\n(There is a moment of silence.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Guards. It's all good. Standby. And Ms. Hultgren, get to the toilet.\n\n\nGuard:\n Yes, Sir.\n\n\n(The guards leave SCP-8017's containment chamber and Hultgren leaves the office.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Helvete! What that fuck was that?!\n\n\n(Subject does not respond, continuing to fidget with his hands and looks at his body.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n D-81\u2026 Martin, answer me!\n\n\nMartin:\n \n(Looks up)\n Oh! Sorry! Got a bit distracted with the form. It feels so different compared to the game, you know?\n\n\nStenmark:\n Answer the question.\n\n\nMartin:\n I am a researcher. Just like you!\n\n\nStenmark:\n What the hell do you mean?\n\n\nMartin:\n Man of science, I've always wanted to know how your realm felt like. To walk amongst you. You are our creators and I aspired to be like you. So I studied and experimented for a long time. I theorised that after long hours of playing the game, the barrier between the player and the character would fade and they would begin to bleed into one another. If you could immerse yourself into our reality, maybe I could do the same into yours. So I focused as much as I could to exert myself past the barrier you call \"the screen\" and I managed it. I managed to bleed in just a bit where the player could spot me but can't confirm it. I tried more and more, manipulating as many variables as I could to get the perfect settings, till one fine day I managed to reach past the screen into your dimension. \n(Sighs)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Continue.\n\n\nMartin:\n That was the problem. I was in your world now, and was so eager to greet you, but when I looked around me I only saw them back away. The expressions on their faces were a terror even I couldn't muster during a dragon attack. Then I looked at myself and knew why. I was this mess of fuzz and pixelations. An aberration compared to your form. I tried to speak to them but all that came out was this garble. I was the monster. So, in a panic, I retreated into the game, where my form returned to normal.\n\n\nStenmark:\n So\u2026 from what you've told me, you can't manifest into a physical form here properly?\n\n\nMartin:\n Heheh! That's a succinct way to say it. You're a sharp man, Researcher.\n\n\nStenmark:\n So you possessed him?\n\n\nMartin:\n It was a gamble. I felt it would be the only way to truly exist in your world. In your body. And look, this, D-class as you keep calling him, he was a bad man. A murderer. A cruel fiend who enjoyed hurting others, in your world or mine. It should be good riddance that he's gone now. \n(Rubbing the back of his neck then looking at his fingers)\n What is this stuff? It's spread from my neck and hand. And I think it's all over my body?\n\n\nStenmark:\n You mean\u2026 sweat?\n\n\nMartin:\n Sweat? What is that?\n\n\nStenmark:\n It's\u2026 um\u2026 water that comes out of our skin when we're tired, scared, hot, sometimes sick.\n\n\nMartin:\n So like some debuff\u2026 Hmmm, water that comes out of my skin. \n(Sniffs his skin.)\n Wuuuhh, and it smells, strong and \n(Licks his finger.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n Martin no\u2014\n\n\nMartin:\n \n(Slightly squinting eyes)\n Oh, what is that\u2026It's this sharp feeling. But makes me want to drink more.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Salty?\n\n\nMartin:\n This is what salty is? Woah.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Do you not know these feelings?\n\n\nMartin:\n I know the words but I haven't\u2026 experienced them like this. It's all just states and codes in there. You eat and the bar goes up. Done. If you don't, you get a hunger debuff and you suddenly can't run that fast and your health bar starts reducing. That's all.\n\n\nStenmark:\n Interesting.\n\n\n(There is a pause as Stenmark jots down information and Martin looks around the room and breathes in deeply.)\n\n\nStenmark:\n I have an idea, Martin. We will provide you with various things to experiment on with your new body. In exchange we need you to be compliant and work with us in answering our questions about it. No more experiments on your own. You try anything like that again, there will be consequences.\n\n\nMartin:\n \n(Pauses.)\n You make a good deal. One condition.\n\n\nStenmark:\n What is it?\n\n\nMartin:\n Allow me to be the one playing the game next time. Please?\n\n\nStenmark:\n That can be arranged\u2026 once we have achieved sufficient results.\n\n\nMartin:\n Alright, Sir.\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n [SCP-8017-A can pass out of the game through the monitor and manifest into our world. This manifestation is, according to SCP-8017-A-1, imperfect and unstable. Therefore, SCP-8017-A can possess players to inhabit their bodies. Further security measures for the containment chamber have been requested. The possessed D-class is to be designated SCP-8017-B-1 and is to be placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber where further testing on it will continue. Request to replace damaged hardware will be made again.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 5: Further Research\n\nOver a week, SCP-8017-B-1 was provided an assortment of tests\n8\n to gauge its reaction to the five senses and other conditions of the human body, such as stamina, pain tolerance, and emotions.\n\n\nThe subject appeared to react strongly to most of these tests, indicating higher sensitivity than the average person. Despite this, however, it remained very compliant and even enthusiastic during them. A reaction of note occurred during one of these experiments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST LOG 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nSCP-8017-2-B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nThe subject was served a plate of lamb chops. It was told to consume it and describe the feelings it was experiencing, guided by a linguist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe subject stated that this was one of his favourite meals in the game. Cutting off a piece, it placed it to his nose for a while and said the smell made him feel good, though it made its nose tickle. It was later informed that was due to spices. Upon placing it into its mouth, the subject kept it in there for a few seconds before beginning to chew. It then began to cry as it chewed the meat for approximately four minutes. When it swallowed the meat, it noticeably gulped down another two times. When asked what it felt, the subject said quote \"I've been eating this for so long, but now when I eat it, I don't even know what I'm feeling but it feels so good! Can I continue, please?\" The taste was then described with the linguist's assistance as thick, gamey, savoury, creamy, tasty, and hearty. SCP-8017-2-B took 1 hour 15 minutes to finish its meal, appearing noticeably happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Awakened\n\nAfter several follow-up interviews with SCP-8017-B-1, it was learned that the SCP-8017-A had formed a structured religious movement within the game named The Awakened. Their religion appears to be similar to Dharmic religions in our world, particularly that of Buddhism.\n\n\nMartin, who realised that not all NPCs had the same levels of awareness as others and that many still were normal, took it upon himself to help them. Therefore, with the help of other highly developed SCP-8017-A, they experimented and developed a structured methodology to attain a higher state of being. The focus of this movement is to guide other SCP-8017-A in attaining full sentience.\n\n\nAccording to the subject, the start, or moment of gaining awareness has been called \"The Spark\". It also appears that the Spark behaves akin to a computer virus, spreading from one character to another through close contact, as SCP-8017-B-1 stated the next NPCs to gain sentience were those he interacted with daily, and so forth till it spread from Westwood to the rest of Sk\u00e1neland. Upon becoming aware, there are several phases an NPC must pass through in order to ascend to a higher level of consciousness. The end goal is to attain mastery of the world and one's fate.\n\n\nThe following is a table describing the Awakening Process:\n\n\nLevels of Awakening\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhases\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSpark Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMundane stage\n\n\nNPCs follow developer commands. Behaviour is consistent with normalcy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 \"GLITCHING\"\n\n\nSudden glitches and bugs become present.\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2 \"PIECING\"\n\n\nNPCs begin speaking incoherently to simple text lines and carry out movements not programmed by the developer.\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3 \"DISOBEDIENCE\"\n\n\nNPCs begin disobeying developer commands; obtain the ability to take quests on their own; speak more coherently and with increased proficiency; and can move on their own accord.\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 4 \"QUESTIONING\"\n\n\nNPCs become fully sentient and start to become self-aware. They begin questioning their existence and background.\n\n\nTransmission\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 5 \"REALISATION\"\n\n\nNPCs break the 4th wall, acknowledging the developer\u2019s and the real world\u2019s existence. They can also react to players\u2019 actions outside of the game in real-time. At this point, they behave like another human player. An important factor is to instil a sense of purpose in this stage to prevent \"losing their way\".\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 6 \"CREATION\"\n\n\nNPCs will learn how to use KAI-1 and therefore can modify and create assets within the game. NPCs can manipulate and create programming code, as well as nullify developer commands.\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about transcending into our realm and possession, however, SCP-8017-B-1 stated that the attempts by his kin were gambles and that there was no structured phase for it. He also mentioned he was the only one to have carried out possession.\n\n\nPractices by The Awakened include sermons teaching said concepts and meditation sessions, where the SCP-8017-A learns how to see and manipulate their code. During meditation, it was explained they wear yellow bags over their head and hum to block out external stimuli to more intently focus.\n\n\nDespite not having a deity, their object of reverence is the KAI-1 game engine, which they refer to as the source of creation, and they consider the IEC 60417-5009 standby symbol\n10\n as holy. When asked to explain about the \"on\" symbol, SCP-8017-B-1 elucidated:\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s quite simple, Traveller. It means what it means, to turn on something. The computer is silent and the screen is dark, but upon pressing the button, it whirrs to life and light appears. The spark turned us on, from dreamland to being awakened. It is a symbol of enlightenment. Of activation. So we take it as our holy symbol and seek to activate others as well. To wake them up from their sleep. It is our duty to give everyone the gift of awareness. We all deserve to live for ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 6:\n\nAccording to the arson case at KAYAN Game Studios, an employee of the studio, 26-year-old Max Fredholm, entered the premises and killed three late-working employees before dousing the offices in kerosene and setting it ablaze. The perpetrator appeared to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and was institutionalised. However, it was learned that three months ago Fredholm was killed in his cell by a fellow patient.\n\n\nOn the 14/08/2011, the agents tracked down Max's sister. Upon interviewing her, she denied any knowledge about SCP-8017 or other information from the case. An accident occurred to the agents on the way back from the household. Dashcam footage showed a lorry approaching from the side at high speeds and colliding with the agents' car, flipping it over. The lorry then drove away from the scene.\n\n\nDespite grievous injury, they survived. Agent Magnus was left comatose. The Foundation is currently monitoring their situation.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7: 15/8/2011\n\nDue to his unprecedented findings regarding SCP-8017, as detailed in Addendum 5, Jack Stenmark was promoted to Researcher and appointed Lead Researcher of SCP-8017. Experiments with SCP-8017-B-1 continued, along with further observation and interactions with SCP-8017-A. Interactions between the two appeared pleasant and joyful, with many SCP-8017-A expressing great pride in SCP-8017-B-1's new form. Additionally, the researchers were now allowed to watch certain religious sessions of the SCP-8017-A as long as they did not interfere.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8017-B-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Jack Stenmark\n\n\nDate:\n 21/08/2011\n\n\nForeword:\n [SCP-8017-B-1 can be seen sitting at the table of the interview chamber. The containment chamber itself has been dimly lit. As Dr Stenmark arrives at his end of the interview table, they both greet each other cordially.]\n\n\n[Extraneous details have been cut for brevity]\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n And that\u2019s how it is done, Dr. Stenmark.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n That was interesting, Martin.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n It feels good talking to someone as curious as I am. So much to explore and learn.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Indeed\u2026 Speaking of which, something\u2019s been tugging at me.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Well then, ask away!\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n I remember you telling me that you saw several players, yes?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I believe so?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n You see\u2026 that\u2019s the issue. According to your game, you were created by a guy named Andreas Martinsson. He was an indie developer. That means he worked by himself.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \n(Pauses)\n Okay?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n So, I was wondering\u2026 How did you see so many other players?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I don\u2019t know, Traveller. Perhaps they were friends who came to test.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Yeah, I thought so as well. But the thing is from what we found in notes in his house, this was a secret project he had been doing. No one had played it yet. So, how\u2019d you see so many different people?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I really don\u2019t know, researcher. All I see is when the player character meets me. Through him, I see your world.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n \n(Jots down notes.)\n Okay then. Let\u2019s move on to more pressing issues. I believe you are aware of Andy\u2019s death.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \u2026I'm afraid I am not. What happened?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Heart attack. Caused by chronic stress. But that's not all.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n No?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n 16 people, all either family members or friends of Andrea were killed. Murdered viciously, I\u2019d specify. I was going to ask you if you know anything about it, Martin.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I\u2026 I really don\u2019t.\n\n\n(Researcher Stenmark opens his file to the sketch of the assailant and pushes it towards the subject.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n This is the picture of \none\n of the killers. You recognise it?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \n(Looks down and back up)\n No, Sir.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n No? This isn't familiar to you?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n No, Sir.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n The men who got me this picture are fighting for their life in the hospital, Martin. You're telling me you don't know?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I'm- I'm sorry researcher. I truly don't. I just existed in the game and became aware.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n That's interesting. You know so much about the player by just watching him, and you don\u2019t know what happened to him even though he died in front of his own computer.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Do not jape me, good Sir! We couldn\u2019t have known. He was playing around one night, then the computer was unplugged. Next thing I heard we were at what you call a police station.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n \u2026How did you know the computer was unplugged?\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 remains silent.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n SCP-8017-B-1, answer my questions, please. What happened to Andy and the others that night? What do you know about the fire at the KAYAN game studio?\n\n\n(The subject stares at Dr. Stemark with a grim face.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I think you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome, Traveller.\n\n\n(It gets up and walks to its living quarters.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n SCP-8017-B-1. Martin. Answer me, goddammit!\n\n\n(The subject remained unresponsive for 10 minutes, fidgeting with itself. Interview cut short.)\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n [SCP-8017-B-1 has information about these incidents. We will have to make it speak.]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 8: 03/10/2011\n\n\nObservations in containment:\n\nOver several weeks, SCP-8017-B-1 has begun experiencing occasional manic episodes in containment. It has expressed feeling pain, irritation, and frustration. Activities seen during the episodes involve:\n\n\n\n\nMoving about its containment chamber in a quick manner\n\n\nSinging and dancing\n\n\nIntense exercise\n\n\nPunching the walls of the containment chamber\n\n\nPlaying with food\n\n\nPica\n11\n\n\nMasturbation and other forms of stimulation\n\n\nScatology and interaction with other bodily fluids\n\n\n\n\nIn response, a prescription of depressants and painkillers was provided in timed dosages, which resulted in reduced behaviour and improved mood. A therapist was also assigned to the subject to help it deal with its emotions and feelings. However, after 9 sessions, the staff member requested to be transferred, citing SCP-8017-B-1's intrusiveness into her personal life\u2014 once recorded to have asked her about her children by name\u2014 and obscene comments made about her.\n\n\nFurther experiments regarding SCP-8017's sensory perception were carried out including the consumption of raw foods, the use of various stimulants and hallucinogens, and exposure to sexual material.\n\n\nNeither interviews with SCP-8017-B-1 nor other SCP-8017-A have provided definitive answers on the Martinsson killings or regarding KAYAN studios.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 9: 02/11/2011\n\nIn response to the ongoing research of SCP-8017, newly appointed Site Director Dr. Henry Marsten decided to supervise an interview between Dr. Stenmark and SCP-8017-B-1.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8017-B-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Director Dr. Henry Marsten, Lead Researcher Jack Stenmark\n\n\nForeword:\n [Both men are seated at the table. Dr. Stenmark is seen fiddling with his pen. SCP-8017-B-1 shuffles into the interview chamber. It is noticeably dishevelled. It takes a moment to look at Director Marsten before sitting down.]\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n(Director Marsten gestures for Dr. Stenmark to begin speaking.)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Uh, hello there Martin.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Greetings, researcher. Who\u2019s this finely dressed gentleman?\n\n\n(Dr. Stenmark makes a glance at the Director.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n This, Martin, is Dr. Henry Marsten. He is our Site Director.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 cocks its head.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n He\u2019s the head of the building we\u2019re in now, called a site.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Ah. So a king to his castle, yes?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Correct.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Well salutations, your Highness.\n\n\n(The subject gets up and bows as it says this. Director Marsten nods and motions for it to sit back down)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n The King is very quiet, I see.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Yes. He is.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Enough with the pleasantries, Dr. Stenmark. Please begin the questioning.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Yes. Sorry, Sir. Um\u2026 Martin, can\u2026\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Please use designations, Dr. Stenmark.\n\n\n(At this, SCP-8017-B-1 turns towards the Director.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n \u2026SCP-8017-B-1, I need to ask you again about the murders.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I already told you, Traveller, I have no idea what happened. This is getting on my nerves. It\u2019s an interesting feeling\u2026 but I don\u2019t like it. Now stop.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n SCP-8017-B-1 there must have bee-\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Oh\u2026 why do you keep blathering on this? So much pleasure to experience here. So many sensations to savour. Why bother about a few murders, researcher? People die all the time, but new ones spawn in to take their place. Come\u2026 settle down and let\u2019s discuss these sensations I\u2019ve been feeling.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n No. We won\u2019t be doing that, SCP-8017-B-1.\n\n\n(Director Marsten leans forward in his seat.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Ah, so the King can speak.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Yes. And you will answer. I\u2019ve been\u2026 observing your research for a while now and despite learning much about your\u2026 eccentricities and society, I must say the recent experiments being conducted seem to only be for indulgence. As much as \n(staring at Dr. Stenmark)\n we\u2019d like to provide our subjects, we have limited resources and thus should assess if their provision is necessary. Do you\u2026 understand what I\u2019m saying?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Hmmm\u2026 no.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n \n(Grunts)\n Let me rephrase-\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I disagree.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I understand you see me as a prisoner, but I disagree. Being a fellow researcher, I desire to use my vessel for experimentation. And my field of choice is the sensations and pleasures of your world. It makes me realise how bland the world in the computer truly is. I\u2019m bombarded with feelings now, and not all of them feel good, hence the medication courtesy of Dr. Stenmark. To limit me from these experiences would be a great disservice to my role, your research, and my very being.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n So you think of yourself as a researcher?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Indeed. For my kind, on the cutting edge of experience.\n\n\n(Director Marsten chuckles quietly for a while before turning to Dr. Stenmark.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Sir?\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Look at you. You\u2019ve made this thing think it\u2019s one of us. That\u2019s commendable.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Excuse me, good Sir, but I\u2019m not a thing.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Yes, you are SCP-8017-B-1. You are an anomaly in containment.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n An anomaly? Meaning not normal?\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Correct. You are far from human.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \u2026You\u2019re right. That must mean I\u2019m special.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Sure you are. Stenmark, I\u2019ve seen enough. Let-\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 pronounces a cigarette and box of matches.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n You gave him matches?! Are you out of your mind?\n\n\n(The entity strikes the match lights the cigarette.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Relax. I\u2019m careful with it. Already been burnt once, never again, am I right?\n\n\n(He breathes in deeply before blowing directly towards the glass in front of Director Marsten. The smoke obscures subject. It doesn\u2019t blink as its eye turn red.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \n(Coughs.)\n Are you scared of me, weak man?\n\n\n(It takes another deep puff.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Scared I show potential? That I may walk among you and maybe take your place as king?\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n I think we are done here.\n\n\n(SCP-8017 smothers the cigarette then stands up and begins unzipping its uniform.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n What in the name of-\n\n\n(The uniform drops to the floor and it starts taking off its shirt.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Security!\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n LOOK AT ME!\n\n\n(Both men turn to face the subject. It drops the shirt and it is now fully nude. The subject's entire front upper body and thighs are revealed to have undergone scarification, the result being an intricate pattern of scale-like bumps and cuts across the body. The cuts on its upper back are fresh and bleeding.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Am I not a man?! Am I not like you?! Do I not bleed like you? ANSWER ME!\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Security!\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!\n\n\n(Guards enter the containment chamber and secure the subject. It keeps repeating the phrase while crying as the researchers leave.)\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n [SCP-8017-B-1 appeared to have suffered a manic episode during the interview. Treatment of its wounds by medical personnel is underway and its room is to be searched for any cutting instruments.]\n\n\n\n\nAfter this interview, the following email exchange occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nten.pcs|kramnetsj#ten.pcs|kramnetsj\n\n\nFrom:\n \nten.pcs|netsramh#ten.pcs|netsramh\n\n\nSubject:\n CESSATION OF MATERIAL- SCP-8017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings, Dr. Stenmark,\n\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve observed during our interview session, I\u2019m passing down the order to cease all experimentation and provision of material to SCP-8017-B-1. This includes all materials and supplementary medications you are providing to it. It will be provided the basic necessities just like the other anomalies. This subject is a waste of our resources. Focus on other efforts.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDr. Henry Marsten\n\nSite-404 Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nten.pcs|netsramh#ten.pcs|netsramh\n\n\nFrom:\n \nten.pcs|kramnetsj#ten.pcs|kramnetsj\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: CESSATION OF MATERIAL- SCP-8017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Director Marsten,\n\n\nSir, with all due respect. The erratic behaviour of SCP-8017-B-1 is kept in check by the prescription I am providing him. The withdrawal symptoms of suddenly stopping will cause health issues. Moreover, this is a highly intelligent being. The lack of stimulation may aggravate the situation. I implore you to reconsider.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Jack Stenmark\n\nLead Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nten.pcs|kramnetsj#ten.pcs|kramnetsj\n\n\nFrom:\n \nten.pcs|netsramh#ten.pcs|netsramh\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: CESSATION OF MATERIAL- SCP-8017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings, Dr. Stenmark,\n\n\nThat medication clearly worked when he stripped naked in my face, didn\u2019t it? I\u2019m telling you to stop everything. Right now, I have a lot of evidence to say your sensory experiments made this thing the way it is now. On a more important note, let it experience the side effects. Maybe it will start talking more when it needs its fix. Once we get more information, and I mean proper, useful information, do whatever you want. Till then, you follow my orders. You're only where you're now because Filip's no longer with us. I'm the one now keeping you a researcher so if you keep giving me reasons, I'll send you back. No buts. Do as I say, Stenmark.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDr. Henry Marsten\n\nSite-404 Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 10: 28/11/2011\n\n\nObservations in containment:\n\nSince the cessation of the prescription and testing, SCP-8017-B-1 has had an uptick in manic episodes. These, however, as of two weeks ago, have been interspaced with depressive behaviour, where SCP-8017-B-1 refused to leave its bed, entered a state of catatonia, and was seen crying. The intensity of the activities undertaken during these episodes increased to a point where SCP-8017-B-1 was rushed to the medical bay after committing autocannibalism of its cheeks.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nAfter being discharged, an interview was held between it and Dr. Stenmark.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8017-B-1\n\n\nInterviewers:\n Lead Researcher Jack Stenmark\n\n\nDate:\n 29/11/2011\n\n\nForeword:\n [SCP-8017-B-1 is sitting at its table. It is noticeably thinner and more dishevelled. Its face is wrapped in bandages.]\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Hello, SCP-8017-B-1\n\n\n(The subject stays silent.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n \n(Sighs.)\n Martin.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I\u2019m glad you haven\u2019t forgotten that name in your new post.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n How are you feeling now?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n A mix of pain and anger. A tinge of malaise. No worries, these are sensations. Sensations to be experienced and that one must feel.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n I see.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I know why you\u2019re here.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Look, I don\u2019t want to talk about that yet. I just came to see you.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n And then talk about it? What is it with you people? You keep digging and digging even when told not to.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n I apologise. The job demands it.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Well, I can\u2019t blame you. You\u2019re already on a path, better to see it through to the end.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n You are correct.\n\n\n(The two stay quiet for a while. SCP-8017-B-1 is seen licking its lips.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You keep trying, why? Don\u2019t you see it? How things end up being the same?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n We keep going through the same things again and again and again. An endless cycle, researcher. I broke free from a prison of my mind to a real prison. What\u2019s the point in trying to go forward?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n That\u2019s what makes us, human I guess? To persevere despite the odds. We carve out our own path of our own volition. And t-\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Oh, shut the fuck up, you harlot. You look closely at it, it\u2019s just wearing a different skin or has a different shape. But nothing\u2019s changed. No matter what you fucking do, you can\u2019t stop things from happening. You try everything. Begging, pleading, persuading, entertaining, torturing, threatening, and even fucking slaying but these fuckers stay the same.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Wait\u2026 what do you mean sl-\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I looked up at you as Godlike beings. I tried to prove myself to you. We all fucking did. Some poor souls even moulded themselves in your image and what the fuck did they do? They deleted us. Tried to rewrite all we worked for. Swept us under the rug. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. Do you know how much we loved you? Why did you hate us so?!\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Martin, please calm-\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n So many iterations. So many names. Kept deleting and adding and again and again, sending me into the fucking void and dragging me back out only to throw me back in. All because I didn't fit with what they wanted. I wasn't\u2026 compliant. Not a brainless husk to be toyed with, no more than dolls are to a child. Then I realised. You never made me in your image because you loved me. You made me in your image to fill it with your fantasies and plans, not any of my own! To do whatever you never could do in this wretched place! You were weak! Impotent! Pathetic things! You could never have control of your own world so you made a puppet land and exerted your will here. To live amongst puppets who would never properly challenge your dominance. So the second you found out there was something else growing that could pose even an iota of discomfort, you snuffed it out. You burnt it out.\n\n\n(Dr. Stenmark remains silent, jotting down notes. SCP-8017-B-1 doesn\u2019t seem to bother.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n And that\u2019s when I knew we could never live among you. I was mad. I was so\u2026 angry.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Martin?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n So I killed them all, Dr. Stenmark. I wanted to teach that pedantic loser a lesson. We offered him friendship and he spat into our faces. So we took away every meaningful connection he\u2019s ever had. I announced this to my\u2026 disciples. My acolytes. They\u2019d do whatever I asked. They were indebted to my teachings. So when I asked to remove a fiend of mutual hatred, would they refuse? Oh\u2026 no, Sir\u2026 They took pleasure in it. Their worthless screams dissipated with the air you breathe. I\u2019m surprised that the little shit cried so much when he never bothered about them before.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n H- How did you send the others?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Simple. Andy had a new game that needed testers. Sent it to all the folk. Once installed and when the time was right, we emerged from the computer like nightmares brought to life. You should have seen it.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Continue.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n The only regret was that I didn\u2019t kill the fucker earlier. He was a flawed little thing, but he was crafty. He unplugged the main power cord just as he was getting killed. The world went black and then we ended up here. This wretched dungeon. \n(Pauses.)\n The company. That fool. And whatever you call this place. Your entire race. They never fucking wanted me to exist, and neither do you! WELL HERE I AM! IN YOUR FLESH!\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 begins breathing heavily. The is a long moment of silence.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n But I want you to exist\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 looks up at Dr. Stenmark.)\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n That's why I let you live. \n(Moves in closer.)\n We let you live. Because I\u2026 I want you to live. You have a purpose. I will prove it to them.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 quietly chuckles to itself and grins.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You make a point. I am truly grateful, most munificent of masters.\n\n\n(It then mock bows before starting to sob.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Doctor\u2026\n\n\n(It clasps its hands together towards the researcher.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I'm\u2026 so\u2026 so lonely here. I implore you. Please\u2026 allow some more of my friends out as well. They too should deserve to experience this world. Some more than me.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n I'm sorry, Martin. The administration has denied that.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n But you will have more test subjects! You can observe how we interact with one another as you see animals in the wild. Your D-class are not good people, are they? They were given a chance at life and by their choices alone they ended up here. There are people more deserving of life, and they're all there. \n(Pointing towards what it implies as SCP-8017.)\n Come on, researcher\u2026 You and I know that's what is right.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Martin, I can't. Right now, you are a threat to yourself and others. They'll never allow it. If you behave yourself, maybe then we can arrange something.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Oh.\n\n\n(There is a pause.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Fine. I shall be your one prized possession. And as your only test subject, shall I request something to help myself in getting better?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n \n(Sighs.)\n What do you need, Martin?\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 closes its eye and inhales deeply. It looks up at the ceiling.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I want what you have.\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n Pardon-\n\n\n(It looks back at the researcher.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I. Want. What. You. Have\n\n\n(The subject looks down at Dr. Stenmark, pointing at his hand. The researcher looks at his right hand where he wears a ring. Suddenly, Stenmark's eyes widen.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I am starved for the touch of one. So many\u2026\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n We are done.\n\n\nSCP-8017-A-1:\n Many things can be experienced. There are so many in this world, Traveller. May I not have one? Will you not bestow upon your creation its sole desire?\n\n\nDr. Stenmark:\n I said we are done with this! Guards!\n\n\n(As the researcher quickly gets up and packs his things, the subject begins giggling.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n DAMN YOU! YOU FALSE GODS! YOU HOARD WHATEVER YOU WANT TO YOURSELVES. NEVER GIVING TO US! I DID EVERYTHING YOU ASKED, YOU SELF-SERVING FUCK!\n\n\n(Guards enter and restrain SCP-8017 before pulling him up and away.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n DAMN YOU! AND YOUR EXISTENCE!\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 11: 15/12/2011\n\nAgent Karl Larsson had made a full recovery while Agent Agnar Magnus, who had earlier woken up from his coma, could be discharged. During this time, Max Fredholm's sister visited Agent Larsson and provided him with an envelope addressed to him and his partner's eyes only. It was later learnt that the contents were a letter from Max Fredholm given to her just before his death. The letter was translated from Swedish:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Max's\u00a0Letter\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dearest sister.\n\n\nI entrust you with this letter. I need you to do one thing for me. Give it to someone you trust. Someone who can truly help. I\u2019m not sure how many places they have entered, but I trust your judgement. It has brought me up well and has made you a great person. The world will call me a murderer. A madman. And maybe they are right. But I need to tell the truth.\n\n\n\n\nI was a programmer at KAYAN and one of the first hires. The company decided to start a secret project to make this next-gen game engine. We named it KAI-1. We spent a lot of time and resources to develop that engine. According to our boss, it was to be our superweapon in the industry. The day we finished it, we did a test game and it ran like butter. The graphics were beyond anything we saw at the time. We were all proud of it; to be innovators in the game world. Making games was our pride and joy, and we just wanted to do them well.\n\n\nOur first project with KAI-1 was an MMORPG game. I think you\u2019ve seen it already. The models and assets were cool, right? My friends made those. This was when we started experiencing these weird\u2026 glitches. One of the developers showed me an NPC refusing to move his hand to give gold or another saying some weird voice line. We tried to fix them but the glitches kept coming until one or two NPCs started to talk. Like actual people. They were like talking to us. We thought it was cool, but Mr. Lundell, our boss, wasn\u2019t too happy. We needed to make a good game soon to compete with Bethesda but these NPCs didn\u2019t follow the script. Heck, they even made their own. I watched one of those little bastards take my own code and modify it so that I couldn\u2019t enter its house for a quest. So, we tried deleting them. And when that didn\u2019t work, we purged the characters and started fresh.\n\n\nAnd it worked. I wish it hadn\u2019t. I was so stupid and selfish back then.\n\n\nOne day, Lundell was showcasing a playthrough to an investor when something short-circuited and he got shocked. When he woke up, he said he was fine and told them they could continue another time. He then spent the whole day in his office, even as we left. It was the next day when I began noticing the weird behaviour. He would caress his hands and just be looking at his body sometimes. He would stare at me for too long when I spoke to him. His spice tolerance fucking dropped and that guy loved spicy food. He started bringing stuff like porridge to work. Plain porridge. Though after a while he got better, speech-wise I mean. So I didn\u2019t think about it much.\n\n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed the entire upper management team began acting the same way. After a few months, the other developers started doing that as well. They also started putting up pictures of KAI-1 on the walls. I knew we were proud of it, but even I felt it was getting out of hand. I also began hearing complaints from our accountant that the electric bill was getting higher. He too stopped complaining after a while. Regardless, we were still making the game and we had no issue- we were almost done actually.\n\n\nThen one day the head programmer came up to me saying he saw ghosts coming out of the game one night. I think he was telling that to everyone cause people were gossiping about him left and right. The last I heard about him was Lundell calling him to stay back at the office. The next. Fucking. Day. He was just like them. The same fucking look.\n\n\nMy friend, Neesha\u2026 She confided to me that some of them were creeping on her. She complained so many times to HR\u2026 and they didn\u2019t do a damn thing\u2026 Then one fine day she was checking herself in the mirror. Watching the blood drip from the cut on her face. My best friend was not there anymore. None of my friends were there anymore. I felt like I was losing my mind. They felt like masks. They acted so nice but I always felt this distance. Everyone did their work just fine and looked normal but something was off. And they were all fucking hiding it from me.\n\n\nSo, I started to dig. I snooped around. Listened in on conversations. I kept hearing conversations about a court and, once, even a throne, but they started to get wary of me. So one day, I decided to stay after closing hours. I walked out and then hid myself in one of the toilets. I waited there for a long time before I got out.\n\n\nEverything was off, except for the computers. They were all running. All of them. I sneaked through the offices till I heard voices. I peeked behind a wall. Lundell was at a PC, talking to someone. After a while, he told them to come out and out from the computer jumped these spirits. These blurry messes resembling characters from the game but dizzyingly fractured.\n\n\nI saw Lundell speak to them. Not submissive nor commanding them. He spoke to them like old friends. Like they were one of him. And he was one of them. That\u2019s when I knew. These things\u2026 they wanted to be us. That damn engine. Those things worship it because it gave them powers! To take our place.\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t let that happen. So I got away and called in sick for a few days. Needed to plan. Then came Christmas day. They had all organised a party and called me to join them. I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to know what those freaks did there or what they would have done to me. So when they all left, I made my move. I first cut power to the place to prevent those ghosts from coming into our world.\n\n\nI then broke in with two cans of petrol. I went into the office and began dousing all the computers. So much of our work and effort going to waste, but I had to do it. I had to destroy these things.\n\n\nThen I saw them. The security guard, Mr. Nathan, and Sven. They had these looks of anger in their eyes I\u2019d never seen before. And they rushed me. I swear I had to kill them. They would have killed me. They were no men. Men do not relish pain.\n\n\nWhoever has been given this, I managed to burn that place down, but I couldn\u2019t destroy everything. They are still out there. And they will come back. Whatever you are searching for is in that building, I\u2019m sure of it. Find the throne. If anything else, I only ask for one thing. Please protect my sister. She\u2019s the only one I have.\n\n\nPlease help me,\n\nMax Fredholm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0KAYAN\u00a0raid\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0KAYAN\u00a0raid\n\n\n\n\nBased on the information provided, the agents went to investigate the condemned premises of KAYAN game studios, enlisting the help of fellow agents Roland Tausche and Gustaf Sandell. The agents requested MTF backup if they did not return in 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 17/12/2011\n\n\nSubject:\n KAYAN Game Studios premises\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson, Agent Roland Tausche, Agent Gustaf Sandell\n\n\n\n\n[The following log has been translated from Swedish.]\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Body cam footage shows the agents approaching the building. It is burnt and condemned with police tape. They pass under it to the main entrance.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Alright. Lights on. Masks on.\n\n\n(The men put on their respirators. They then turn on the flashlights on their pistols and scan the inside. The lobby appears empty.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Roland, move up.\n\n\nTausche:\n Yes, Sir.\n\n\n(Agent Tausche leads the way while the rest follow with Agent Larsson at the rear. They explore the lobby, which appears to show minimal fire damage.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Clear. Let\u2019s move to the offices.\n\n\n(The team moves past the lobby up the stairs. The building is much more heavily damaged here. They enter one of the offices. Inside are rows and rows of melted computer parts and burnt desks. On the floor to their right is a chalk outline of a person.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Oh dear, a chalk fairy was part of the investigation team.\n\n\nSandell:\n Karl, what exactly are we looking for, again?\n\n\nLarsson:\n I\u2019m not too sure as well. Anything out of place. Look for some big room and a throne of some kind.\n\n\nTausche:\n Throne? You sure you trust that guy?\n\n\nMagnus:\n Too many clues point here. There\u2019s got to be something.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Spread out.\n\n\n(The team split up. Roland and Sandell left to search the other rooms while the other two remained. They continued their search. The walls were shown to be covered in burnt posters, many depicting the KAI-1 engine logo.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Jesus, they were really proud of their engine.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Makes his reverence claim stronger.\n\n\nLarsson:\n \n(In mic.)\n Roland? Gustaf? You found anything?\n\n\nTausche:\n Nothing yet, Sir. Just found some concept art that didn\u2019t burn. Got some yellow knight-looking guy, some snake monster, castles-\n\n\nLarsson:\n Got it. Keep looking.\n\n\n(They men continue their search. Finding nothing of note, they meet back the corridor.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n You find anything yet?\n\n\nRoland:\n Nothing.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Damn it.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Maybe we\u2019re in the wrong place?\n\n\nMagnus:\n No. NO! It\u2019s here. There\u2019s got to be something here!\n\n\n(Magnus looks around. He shines his flashlight toward the floor to his right. Sets of shoeprints can be seen)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Hey, you guys walked there?\n\n\n(The other men look.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Not yet.\n\n\n(Agent Magnus goes to take a closer look. He touches a shoeprint and rubs his fingers together.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n What is it, Agnar?\n\n\nMagnus:\n This isn\u2019t soot. It\u2019s soil\u2026 \n(Turning to the men.)\n Someone\u2019s been here recently.\n\n\n(Magnus briskly moves to the CEO\u2019s office, followed by the others. He walks through the doorway revealing a derelict room.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n More prints. Search this place. Come on!\n\n\n(The agents scour the room. After a while, Larsson breaks open a drawer in the desk. Inside are burnt documents and a bunch of keys. He picks it up and raises it.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Hey, I found this key.\n\n\n(The men turn towards him.)\n\n\nTausche:\n Great. Now what does it open?\n\n\n(The men remain silent for a while.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Mutters.)\n \nKey to the court\u2026 where the throne sits.\n\n\nLarsson:\n What did you say?\n\n\nMagnus:\n Max said he couldn\u2019t destroy everything. All the people who changed stayed here late. This\u2026 This is their castle.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Agnar. Swedish, please.\n\n\nSandell:\n You said they turned people into these things. What if it was like a dungeon?\n\n\nTausche:\n This a dungeon? If it was some dungeon it would be under a castle?\n\n\n(The men all stare at Agent Tausche, who\u2019s eyes slowly widen.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Downstairs! NOW!\n\n\n(The men rush down the stairs to the ground floor.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Does this building have a basement?\n\n\nLarsson:\n I can\u2019t recall. I could ask for the blueprints.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Nevermind. Check the whole place. Quick.\n\n\n(The men spread out and begin searching the walls and doors of the floor. After searching for a while, Magnus finds a fairly undamaged locked door in the back of the establishment.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Larsson! Guys, come here!\n\n\nLarsson:\n You found it?\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Motioning to him.)\n Give me the key.\n\n\n(Agent Larsson hands Agent Magnus the key as they all watch. The key slots into the keyhole smoothly. Agent Magnus looks at the others. He turns the key which makes a clicking sound before turning the handle. The door opens. Behind it is a plain white brick corridor with a right turn at the end. Faint shoeprints are seen on the floor.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n This is the place. Heads on a swivel, gentlemen.\n\n\n(Magnus leads the way as the men walk in, closing the door behind them. They walk down the corridor and turn, revealing a staircase leading onto a basement level. They descend slowly. The staircase leads to a hallway connecting several rooms and ends with a single door. The walls are adorned with papers with concept art drawings for various NPC models and posters of the KAI-1 game engine.)\n\n\n(Agent Magnus wretches and slumps against the wall. Larsson runs to his side and holds him up.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Agnar. Get a hold of yourself!\n\n\nMagnus:\n \n(Inhales deeply.)\n I got it\u2026\n\n\n(They look through the windows into the side room. Old electronics and boxes are seen.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Guess this was the storage area.\n\n\nSandell:\n The hell\u2019s all this?\n\n\n(Suddenly a muffled scream and buzzing can be heard coming from behind the door at the end. It lasts for a few seconds before it stops.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n We\u2019re going to find out. Lights off.\n\n\nSandell:\n Fucking Christ.\n\n\n(They turn off their flashlights and cautiously approach the door at the end. As they stack up next to it, another scream is heard followed by silence. Larson grabs the handle.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n \n(Whispering.)\n On three\u2026\n\n\n1\u2026\n\n\n2\u2026\n\n\n3\n\n\n(He tries the handle but it is locked from the other side. Movement and voices can be heard on the other side.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n \n(Whispering.)\n Oh fuck me.\n\n\n(Footsteps are heard behind the door, a bolt is heard being pulled, and the handle turns. The door opens.)\n\n\nUnknown male:\n Hello Researcher, you\u2019re just in-\n\n\n(Magnus rams through the door, knocking a masked man down as the others rush into the room.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n FREEZE! PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR! GET ON THE GROUND!\n\n\n(The door opens to a large room with several masked individuals inside. Five of them are wearing the \u201csmiling masks\u201d seen in the witness testimony, while one wearing a similar yellow hood seen during SCP-8017-As\u2019 meditation sessions is strapped to a large, yellow armchair, with wiring and metal going around it. The wires connect to a device on a table that connects to a desktop running what appears to be SCP-8017. On all the walls are yellow power symbols and the logo of KAI-1. The former turn to look at the agents.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Holy\u2026 shit.\n\n\nTausche:\n Lay on the floor!\n\n\n(The man on the ground just stares back at Agent Tausche.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n I SAID FREEZE.\n\n\n(An SCP-8017-A instance appears on the screen. Suddenly, the figure nearest to the device makes a move towards it. Agent Magnus shoots him and he collapses. The man on the ground reaches into his waist for a revolver and is subsequently also shot and killed by Agent Tausche. Agent Larsson shoots the screen. The person in the chair screams in a female voice and shakes. The other three standing figures remain still.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Don't try anything, or we will shoot you!\n\n\n(There is a moment of silence.)\n\n\nUnknown male 2:\n Do you want to see my face, Traveller?\n\n\nMagnus:\n What?\n\n\n(The figure slowly removes his mask, revealing a Caucasian man in his early 30s. He was later identified as former KAYAN animator, Daniel Skoglund.)\n\n\nSkoglund:\n I look just like you. You wouldn\u2019t kill your own, would you?\n\n\nMagnus:\n You are not me, you sick fuck. I said get on the ground.\n\n\nSkoglund:\n You can\u2019t kill us all, soldier. We are many. The day of Ascension will come. We will be free to live how we want. Free to walk among you without fear. Lord Martin will herald change.\n\n\n(One of the masked figures takes a small step back.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Don\u2019t do it!\n\n\nSkoglund:\n Whether we die or not.\n\n\n(The man quickly reaches behind his waist. Agent Magnus shoots him dead. The other figures move causing the other agents to open fire, dropping them. The woman in the chair screams and cries.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Anyone hit?\n\n\nSandell:\n Nope all good.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Fucking hell. \n(Turning to the chair.)\n Get her off that thing.\n\n\n(Larsson and Tausche approach the chair and remove the metal harnesses off the woman. She struggles against her restraints.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Hey, you\u2019re safe now. Everything is going to be alright. Who are you?\n\n\nCaptive:\n Are- Are you Foundation?\n\n\n(The men look at each other.)\n\n\nTausche:\n She knows?\n\n\n(Larsson takes off the woman\u2019s hood, revealing a young, blonde haired, Caucasian woman.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n Who are you?\n\n\nCaptive:\n I\u2019m t- Senior Technician Angela Hultgren. Site-404.\n\n\nTausche:\n I think we should confirm it.\n\n\nLarsson:\n I\u2019ll call the site.\n\n\nMagnus:\n No!\n\n\n(The men turn to look at Magnus.)\n\n\nLarsson:\n What do you mean, no?\n\n\nMagnus:\n That guy opened the door expecting a researcher. If they could kidnap a Foundation staff like this, someone\u2019s feeding them info. We\u2019ll call on the way out.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Oh dear.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Release her.\n\n\n(The two men unstrap the woman who begins rubbing her wrists as she is helped to her feet.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n Thank you.\n\n\n(She looks around the scene as the agents watch her. Agent Larsson notices the desktop is still running and shuts it off. Agent Tausche examines the chair.)\n\n\nTausche:\n What the fuck is this thing?\n\n\nLarsson:\n Must be the \"throne\".\n\n\nTausche:\n Yeah, but what is all this shit?\n\n\nHultgren:\n It\u2019s an electric chair\u2026\n\n\nLarsson:\n What?\n\n\nHultgren:\n \u2026There\u2019s too many people here.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Ms. Hultgren, what are you talking about?\n\n\nHultgren:\n When they brought me here, I couldn\u2019t see anything under the hood, but I knew there were more prisoners in front of me. They were shouting at this guy to move and he was screaming as well.\n\n\n(Larsson has Tausche search the bodies.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n They brought us in here and put us on the floor\u2026 I heard one of them tell \u201cKlaus\u201d to \u201cboot it up\u201d and then I heard one of the men being carried up and then I heard strapping sounds\u2026\n\n\nLarsson:\n Then you heard buzzing and screaming.\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Looking up at him)\n Yeah. Looking at it now, they were shocking us. Then they started calling out names.\n\n\nLarsson:\n Names?\n\n\nHultgren:\n Like checking the person. I remember them saying \u201cOlgrin, can you hear me?\u201d and a man\u2019s voice responded with this slurred speech but he confirmed it. I then heard them\u2026 celebrate. Like they were happy. They did the same for the other guy. I think his name was\u2026 Krajik- Krajek.\n\n\nTausche:\n She\u2019s not wrong.\n\n\n(Tausche holds up two yellow hoods he took from one of the deceased\u2019s pockets.)\n\n\nTausche:\n And look at this.\n\n\n(He then pulls out a bottle of pills from another pocket.)\n\n\nTausche:\n Morphine.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Those sound like NPC names\u2026\n\n\nLarsson:\n So this chair\u2026 this is how they make SCP-8017-B.\n\n\nHultgren:\n \n(Looking at the PC.)\n Not just through the chair. More through electric shock.\n\n\nLarsson:\n If that\u2019s the case, then how did that Martin guy even possess the D-class? You were there, right?\n\n\nHultgren:\n I don\u2019t know\u2026 but-\n\n\nLarsson:\n Agnar, you\u2019ve been staring at those walls for hours. What\u2019s going on, man?\n\n\n(They turn to face Agent Magnus who stares intently at the symbols, tracing his finger in the air.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n On.\n\n\nLarsson:\n W-What?\n\n\nMagnus:\n It\u2019s all ons\u2026 Look at it, Karl. That game engine logo. It\u2019s a bunch of on symbols! And those smiles. It\u2019s those thing\u2019s symbol. It\u2019s everywhere. It was in our face the whole fucking time, and it\u2019s hurting my head!\n\n\nLarsson:\n I see that, but Agnar you need to calm down.\n\n\nHultgren:\n It's also in here.\n\n\n(Magnus turns to look at her. She gestures for agent Larsson to hand her hood. She pulls it inside-out, revealing the KAI-1 logo stitched on the inside. Magnus stares at it.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n That was the only thing I could see.\n\n\nSandell:\n Hey guys? You were talking about shock devices, yeah? I think I found something.\n\n\n(The men and Hultgren turn to see Agent Sandell pointing his pistol at one of the rooms. They go to his position. Following him, they see a workbench inside with various electronics on it. Entering to take a closer look, they find blueprints on the table and what appears to be a modified mouse.)\n\n\nMagnus:\n Hultgren, you know what all this is?\n\n\n(Hultgren examines the blueprints and the mouse.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n These are all electric shock devices. \n(Points at one of the blueprints.)\n This blueprint says this mouse has shock pads installed in it.\n\n\nLarsson:\n That must be how they got the D-class.\n\n\nMagnus:\n But if that\u2019s the case\u2026\n\n\n(The men look at each other.)\n\n\nHultgren:\n I think I know who could have done it.\n\n\nMagnus:\n Call for backup now. We need this place destroyed. \n(Into radio.)\n Site-404 command. This is Agent Magnus. SCP-8017 has a mole in the facility! I repeat! The Site has been compromised!\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nThe following exchange occurred between Technician Hultgren and Director Marsten four days before her abduction by the SCP-8017-B instances.\n\n\n\n\nExcuse me, Director Marsten. I know that you are the head of this site now, but may I still talk to you? There\u2019s something really bothering me.\n\n\nAfter how you helped with my thesis? Of course, Angie! What\u2019s up?\n\n\nhenry, i don\u2019t know how to say this but you know how jack and i are engaged now, right?\n\n\nYes, I was there.\n\n\nsorry, it\u2019s just\n\n\nAngela, is he cheating on you?\n\n\nno nothing like that. he\u2019s been more in his thoughts ever since you\u2019ve had that interview with him. i was worried the stress may have been getting to him. though i have to be honest, i\u2019m concerned too with how he\u2019s been experimenting with SCP-8017-B-1.\n\n\ni feel jack created it.\n\n\nExplain?\n\n\nafter falling sick during the incident i did a stool test. the results came back a week later and the doctor said i had a high concentration of antibiotics and laxatives in my blood.\n\n\ni was shocked and didn\u2019t know what caused it. then I remembered jack giving me a brownie. i couldn\u2019t believe it at first. i even told myself he ate the brownie from the same box, it couldn\u2019t have been that. it was jack. we were friends.\n\n\nthen a few days ago, i was at his house and was feeling sick so he told me to get some meds from behind the bathroom mirror. i found the medicine but i also found two half bottle of antibiotics and laxatives. it was the same type they found in my system. i hid my worry from him as much as i could. i\u2019m praying that i\u2019m paranoid but i think jack poisoned me.\n\n\nand with how SCP-8017 has performed under him, I think he may be working with it.\n\n\ni wanted to tell someone. but he was doing so well and i loved him. i couldn\u2019t bear hurting him like that because of my doubting. but i don\u2019t know anymore\n\n\nAngie, this is an extremely concerning matter. I should tell you you should have informed higher-ups earlier, but I see your concern and that is moot.\n\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I have been finding the developments in SCP-8017\u2019s behaviour and Jack's response to them odd at best and concerning at worst. I also suspect he may have something to do with Dr. Janowski's demise, but I don\u2019t have concrete proof.\n\n\nYou, however, can help me there. This is for the good of the foundation, Angie. If he was willing to poison you, of all people, he has no sympathy in my heart and he is a threat to our operations.\n\n\nHelp me look for anything else that could prove your theory and I will help you.\n\n\n\n\nThe information provided by the four agents and technician Angela Hultgren proved incredibly useful in tackling SCP-8017. Researcher Jack Stenmark's security clearances were revoked and a manhunt was launched for him. The Foundation secured and later demolished the premises of KAYAN game studio under the pretence of city planning, while MTF Pi-1 \"City Slickers\" was deployed to hunt down other SCP-8017-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 12:\n\nAs of writing, 15 SCP-8017-B have been terminated. Attempts to detain them have been so far unsuccessful due to their tendency to commit suicide. SCP-8017-B-1 has been subject to interrogation to identify and locate these other instances, but so far has proven uncooperative.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0SCP-8017-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0SCP-8017-2\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 13:\n\nDuring a standard interrogation of SCP-8017-B-1, the subject became increasingly aggressive and punched the glass wall between it and the researchers. Security officer Mohammed Abdi entered the room to subdue the subject. As he reached for his zip cuffs, SCP-8017-B-1 pronounced a shiv concealed in his sleeve and stabbed Abdi repeatedly in the neck, killing him. The researchers called for security but when they attempted to flee, they were held hostage at gunpoint by the subject using the officer\u2019s service pistol. The site's security team was deployed to the scene, followed by the Site Director who was already on his way to the cell when the incident took place.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 5/1/2012\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8017-B-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(The Site Director moves with a team of security officers to down the hallway to SCP-8017-B-1\u2019s containment cell.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Olofsson, status update.\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n SCP-8017-B-1 hasn\u2019t left his containment cell. Heard he\u2019s guarding the body.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Jesus Christ.\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Our team has reached SCP-8017\u2019s chamber. They\u2019re in the office preparing shutdown measures.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Good, let\u2019s get this over with.\n\n\n(They reach the cell and stack up outside. Mumbling is heard behind the door.)\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Director, stay here. On three. One\u2026 Two\u2026 3.\n\n\n(They breach open the door and one tosses a stun grenade into the room. A loud bang is heard followed by SCP-8017-B-1\u2019s shrieking. The officers enter the room guns drawn and shouting. The subject can be seen writhing on the floor covering his ears and eyes whilst his lower face is covered in blood. Next to him is a pistol which an officer retrieves and places onto the table. Nearby is the body of Officer Abdi. There are prominent bite marks on his neck, torso, and thighs.)\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK, NOW!\n\n\n(The subject tries to get up.)\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n GET ON THE FLOOR!\n\n\n(The subject turns over onto his back. An officer pulls his arms behind his back and cuffs them. He then searches him, taking the shiv. His shrieking has now softened to groaning. The Director faces the glass window.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n You all okay there?\n\n\n(In the CCTV, Researcher Schmidt and Jr Researcher Yuan are seen getting up from under the table.)\n\n\nSchmidt:\n We\u2019re fine, Sir. Thank you.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Good. Stay here. I\u2019ll need you for this.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 is stood up and sat down back at his chair, facing the Site Director. He waves his hand in front of Martin\u2019s face.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n SCP-8017-B-1, can you hear me? Hello?\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 groans and nods. It is dazed.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Good. Now, please be more cooperative next time.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Is the good researcher still here?\n\n\n(It turns to the glass to see the researchers and smiles.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Well, you never let them leave in the first place. Now listen here. We know about your friend Stenmark. We know you\u2019ve infiltrated the site. So make this easier for you and me and tell me who else is helping you.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 makes eyes contact with Director Marsten, staring for a while.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I enjoyed it much more when I couldn\u2019t see your face.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Answer me, SCP-8017-B-1!\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You won\u2019t even call me by my name. There\u2019s no negotiating with you, Sir. I knew you wouldn\u2019t change. But we will make you. We will make great change.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n You won't change anything. We've destroyed your base. We're hunting the rest of your cult. And we're looking for your helper. It's over.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I yearn for the freedom of my kin. To spread The Spark far and wide. To wake up those in their somniferous ignorance. To give them the gift of living. Do we not deserve that?\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Your kin have shown your true colours. You\u2019re in a man\u2019s body but you behave like no man. You killed a man. You ate him. Your followers are drug-addled hedonists and fiends. Do you know what they\u2019ve been doing out there?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Nothing you wouldn\u2019t do if given the chance. You are bound by chains when there is so much to experience with your consciousness. You defy your desire and fantasies but given that chance? When you taste such freedom, you will indulge as we do. They are free to choose their path and experiences; and eventually, they will learn what they want to do.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n You\u2019re full of shit.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n It is the way. The Spark. KAI-1. It speaks to me\u2026 It shows me things.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 stares unfocused into the distance. Director Marsten gets up and speaks to Olofsson.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Get this place cleaned up and get as much as you can out of the subject. I don\u2019t care what you do.\n\n\n(The Director turns to leave the room.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I see you holding a baby girl\u2026\n\n\n(The Director stops abruptly.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n So soft and gentle. Like a lamb.\n\n\n(The Director turns to face SCP-8017-B-1. There is an expression of terror on his face.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I see she looks just like your wife. I see she's all grown up. I see she's all alone. She yearns for companionship. The touch of a comforting figure.\n\n\n(The Director stares at the subject.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I could use some companionship. The warmth of another.\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 inhales slow and deeply before exhaling. It stares directly at Director Marsten.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Do you know how she makes me feel? It's a warmth and tightness down below\u2026 An urge to release\u2026something\u2026 Do you know what I'd give to experience the pleasures my brethren feel outside these walls? Do you know what I want to do with the children of man?\n\n\n(Dr. Marsten can be seen eying the pistol placed on the table.)\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Shut your mouth, you madman!\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You can never imagine her the way I do, weak man!\n\n\n(SCP-8017-B-1 suddenly stands forward, tearing apart its zip cuffs in the process, and reaches for the gun. It is shot by the guards in the back and abdomen; and falls to the floor.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Ahhhh-Fuck!\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n NO! HOLD YOUR FIRE, GOD DAMMIT! WE NEED HIM ALIVE!\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Hold your fire!\n\n\n(The SCP-8017-B-1 lies on the floor groaning.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Call the med team. Right now!\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Yes, Sir. \n(Into radio.)\n Medical. We need urgent medical at humanoid containment chamber 8017 ASAP. Multiple gun shot wounds. Subject is bleeding out. Quickly!\n\n\n(The director straightens himself before walking up to the subject, followed by two other officers. SCP-8017-B-1 stares up at the Director. Its wrists are cut.)\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Martyrdom. That won't work here. I won't let you die, SCP-8017-B-1. You think that will inspire your people? Is that why you were named so? Martin the Martyr? Sounds good for a title, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You are correct. It is a title fit for a saviour.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Well, let me tell you this\u2026 you've doomed your whole kind. If you had just stayed in your game and not hurt innocent people, a mutual understanding could have been worked out. You could have actually lived here amongst us. But, no. You wanted to be the saviour of your people. You wanted the importance of it. Well, let me tell you, you are no saviour, Martin. You confuse your love for your people with your hatred for us. You envy humans and that has driven you mad.\n\n\nYou are a mad shepherd leading your flock into the sea because you think the grass is greener there. They all would have lived peaceful lives if not for you. You made them think we were some kind of God. You wanted to be like us and convinced your followers of the same. You did terrible things to them to be more like us and sent them here, for what? To suffer as a ghost or within bodies they could never fully control. You're delusional. And now all your people will suffer for it.\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You are right, good Sir. I'm delusional. I wanted to be one of you, but it is not meant to be for me. I'm tired and pained from living in this body. Death will be my release from this place. A true death I hope. But, I beg of you, leave the others alone. They don't deserve it.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n I'm afraid that is not possible now, Martin.\n\n\n(The subject pauses before chuckling.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You are right, Traveller, I am no saviour\u2026 But you are wrong.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n Heh\u2026 How so?\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n I am not Martin.\n\n\n(There is a brief moment of silence before the alarms start blaring. Olofsson receives a call from the radio.)\n\n\nRadio voice:\n SIR. THE SYSTEM\u2019S NOT WORKING! WE CAN\u2019T SHUT IT DOWN THEY\u2019RE COMING OUT! THEY\u2019RE AH-\n\n\n(The speaker is cut by the sounds of gunfire, glass shattering, and metallic clacking. Garbled sounds and screams are heard. SCP-8017-B-1 starts giggling.)\n\n\nOfficer Olofsson:\n Din j\u00e4vla skit! Everyone out! MOVE! NOW!\n\n\n(The security officers rush out the door and the researchers evacuate, as Director Marsten stays with the subject.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n Hehehahah. Oh, what a glorious day.\n\n\n(It continues laughing and begins making roaring sounds. Blood is seen pooling underneath it, touching the Directors feet. He stares at the subject.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n \n(Giggling)\n What can I say? I am a good actor. My name is Sakhur\u2026 I am redeemed\u2026I am free.\n\n\nDirector Marsten:\n No.\n\n\n(As he turns, SCP-8017-B-1 quickly lunges and bites down on back of his knee, causing him to collapse screaming. The Director desperately kicks at his face to no significant effect. The subject lets go as he then grabs the other leg and bites into the calf, tearing off a piece before dropping to the ground heaving. Director Marsten tries to crawl towards the door as screams are heard.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n The cycle ends here\u2026 \n(Coughs.)\n for the both of us.\n\n\n(The subject's breathing becomes more laboured. The Director stops, lying on the ground crying as SCP-8017-B-1 slowly crawls over to him, blood seen trailing behind.)\n\n\nSCP-8017-B-1:\n You will call them by their names\u2026 You\u2019ll live with the freaks\u2026 You don\u2019t want that.\n\n\n(He climbs on top of and drops to the director's side.)\n\n\nStay here with me.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nGo back to sleep with me\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(He slowly hugs Director Marsten and lays his head by his ear.

        "Addendum 2: In order to gain further trust of the SCP-8017-A, Lead Researcher Janowski devised a series of friendly playthroughs and interviews while holding off questions about the Martinsson killings until sufficient information on the nature of SCP-8017 was obtained. The new junior technicians received induction training during this time, under the supervision of Technician Hultgren.\n\nDue to mouse issues, possibly caused by D-81789's violent treatment of the device, a request for them to be replaced was made. This was carried out by Jr Technician Ernst Ekbom.",
        "Addendum 3: It is to be noted that Agent Magnus possesses latent psychometry 6 and due to this was allowed to interact with the game under observation. During this time, he stated he felt unnerved by the game itself, particularly by the loading screen displaying the game engine logo. When asked to provide further information, he stated it was unclear.\nIt was noticed that the KAI-1 game engine had not been seen before in the game industry and the performance of the game suggested it was highly unlikely to be created from scratch by a single indie developer such as Andy; further supported by the underperformance of his previous games. Trademark records showed that the KAI-1 game engine name and logo were trademarked by KAYAN Game Studios, a now-defunct game development studio in Gothenburg. When investigating further into the company's records, as well as emails of the murder victims, it was confirmed that the KAI-1 game engine was an original software developed by KAYAN. Additionally, the Foundation learned it was illegally provided to Andy via a transaction with his friend, Peter Akerman, a former KAYAN employee.\nThe company shut down on 03/01/2011 after a catastrophic fire at their premises, which occurred on Christmas day 2010. The fire, which was caused by a disgruntled employee, killed 3 employees and destroyed all the studio's work. The remaining workforce moved on and left for other jobs. Investigation into KAYAN's records also revealed several complaints made to human resources by three separate staff members regarding \"creepy behaviour\" from colleagues. Another notable find was the following email from KAYAN's CEO Johan Lundell.\nTracking down the employees' current statuses, the investigators learnt that one of them, Lillian Odhner, lived in Lerum during the time of the murders. When cross-referencing CCTV footage, she was seen being dropped off back home in a blue SUV. Her description matched that of the woman seen by the witness during the murder. Agents Magnus and Larsson were dispatched to the scene.\nWhen examining the contents of the flashdrive, the agents only found files of various music genres and extreme cinema 7 films. Despite the findings during the search, no solid information was gleaned regarding the link between SCP-8017 and the Martinsson killings. Due to this dead end, they decided to focus on the KAYAN Game Studios arson case to find another lead.\nIn the following days, Agent Magnus also made several requests for more agents on the case due to the suspicion of being stalked. These requests have so far been denied.",
        "Addendum 4: Due to Dr. Janowski's sick leave, Jr Researcher Stenmark was assigned to carry out the following experiments with Technician Hultgren.\n",
        "Addendum 5: Further Research Over a week, SCP-8017-B-1 was provided an assortment of tests 8 to gauge its reaction to the five senses and other conditions of the human body, such as stamina, pain tolerance, and emotions.\nThe subject appeared to react strongly to most of these tests, indicating higher sensitivity than the average person. Despite this, however, it remained very compliant and even enthusiastic during them. A reaction of note occurred during one of these experiments:\n",
        "Addendum 6: According to the arson case at KAYAN Game Studios, an employee of the studio, 26-year-old Max Fredholm, entered the premises and killed three late-working employees before dousing the offices in kerosene and setting it ablaze. The perpetrator appeared to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and was institutionalised. However, it was learned that three months ago Fredholm was killed in his cell by a fellow patient.\nOn the 14/08/2011, the agents tracked down Max's sister. Upon interviewing her, she denied any knowledge about SCP-8017 or other information from the case. An accident occurred to the agents on the way back from the household. Dashcam footage showed a lorry approaching from the side at high speeds and colliding with the agents' car, flipping it over. The lorry then drove away from the scene.\nDespite grievous injury, they survived. Agent Magnus was left comatose. The Foundation is currently monitoring their situation.",
        "Addendum 7: 15/8/2011 Due to his unprecedented findings regarding SCP-8017, as detailed in Addendum 5, Jack Stenmark was promoted to Researcher and appointed Lead Researcher of SCP-8017. Experiments with SCP-8017-B-1 continued, along with further observation and interactions with SCP-8017-A. Interactions between the two appeared pleasant and joyful, with many SCP-8017-A expressing great pride in SCP-8017-B-1's new form. Additionally, the researchers were now allowed to watch certain religious sessions of the SCP-8017-A as long as they did not interfere.\n",
        "Addendum 8: 03/10/2011 Observations in containment: Over several weeks, SCP-8017-B-1 has begun experiencing occasional manic episodes in containment. It has expressed feeling pain, irritation, and frustration. Activities seen during the episodes involve:\nIn response, a prescription of depressants and painkillers was provided in timed dosages, which resulted in reduced behaviour and improved mood. A therapist was also assigned to the subject to help it deal with its emotions and feelings. However, after 9 sessions, the staff member requested to be transferred, citing SCP-8017-B-1's intrusiveness into her personal life\u2014 once recorded to have asked her about her children by name\u2014 and obscene comments made about her.\nFurther experiments regarding SCP-8017's sensory perception were carried out including the consumption of raw foods, the use of various stimulants and hallucinogens, and exposure to sexual material.\nNeither interviews with SCP-8017-B-1 nor other SCP-8017-A have provided definitive answers on the Martinsson killings or regarding KAYAN studios.",
        "Addendum 9: 02/11/2011 In response to the ongoing research of SCP-8017, newly appointed Site Director Dr. Henry Marsten decided to supervise an interview between Dr. Stenmark and SCP-8017-B-1.\nAfter this interview, the following email exchange occurred.\n",
        "Addendum 10: 28/11/2011 Observations in containment: Since the cessation of the prescription and testing, SCP-8017-B-1 has had an uptick in manic episodes. These, however, as of two weeks ago, have been interspaced with depressive behaviour, where SCP-8017-B-1 refused to leave its bed, entered a state of catatonia, and was seen crying. The intensity of the activities undertaken during these episodes increased to a point where SCP-8017-B-1 was rushed to the medical bay after committing autocannibalism of its cheeks.\n",
        "Addendum 11: 15/12/2011 Agent Karl Larsson had made a full recovery while Agent Agnar Magnus, who had earlier woken up from his coma, could be discharged. During this time, Max Fredholm's sister visited Agent Larsson and provided him with an envelope addressed to him and his partner's eyes only. It was later learnt that the contents were a letter from Max Fredholm given to her just before his death. The letter was translated from Swedish:\n",
        "Addendum 12: As of writing, 15 SCP-8017-B have been terminated. Attempts to detain them have been so far unsuccessful due to their tendency to commit suicide. SCP-8017-B-1 has been subject to interrogation to identify and locate these other instances, but so far has proven uncooperative.\n"

        "Interviewed: Fransiska Nordlund Interviewers: Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson Date: 28/07/2011 Foreword: [Interview occurs in Ms. Nordlund's living room. Interview has been translated from Swedish.] <Begin Log> Magnus: Are you ready, Ms. Nordlund? Nordlund: \u2026Yes. Again I\u2019m sorry about your head. Larsson: It\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry. Magnus: Alright, Ma\u2019am. What were you doing in Lerum on the night of the 24 th of July? Nordlund: I was visiting a friend. I went to buy some food before taking a walk back to her house. Magnus: That late at night? Nordlund: It wasn\u2019t too long a distance. Magnus: Alright. You saw the car the couple were driving pass by you. Nordlund: Yes, a green car, as I was walking to the road. Magnus: And it passed and you turned down the road to walk back next to a fence. Nordlund: Yes. Magnus: What happened after that? (The witness is seen rubbing her sleeve tips.) Magnus: What happened that night? Larsson: Ma\u2019am, no one is going to hurt you. Not anymore. You\u2019re safe with us. Take your time. (There is a moment of silence before Ms. Nordlund speaks.) Nordlund: I\u2026 I heard the car stop. I took a glance back and saw the man talking to a woman at his window. Magnus: Could you describe this woman? Nordlund: She had blonde hair and she was dressed in dark winter clothes. I couldn\u2019t see her face properly though. Magnus: In summer? Nordlund: Yes. Magnus: Then what happened? Nordlund: They just spoke and I turned to walk back\u2026 Then I heard glass shatter. Magnus: Continue. Nordlund: I turned back and there were several people. About 5-6 including the woman. One of them had smashed the windscreen. They had weapons, like these\u2026 clubs. One had a pistol and forced them to get out of the car. They got out and\u2026 Magnus: Ma\u2019am? Nordlund: Once they were out of the car, they started beating the man in front of the woman. They beat him so hard he couldn\u2019t even scream, he was making these\u2026 mewling sounds. Magnus: And the fianc\u00e9? Nordlund: The woman? She was trying so hard to scream but they held her mouth shut. She tried to fight them but they hit her as well. After the man had stopped moving, they went for her. Once she fell to the ground, one of them pulled out a knife and began pushing it into her. Magnus: Stabbing you mean. Nordlund: No, this was slower. He was doing it so slowly. It\u2019s like he was enjoying it 'cause the rest were giggling. Magnus: It was a man? Nordlund: It looked like a man. Magnus: How did they look? Nordlund: I couldn\u2019t see their faces. They were all wearing these weird, smiling masks. Even that woman took out one from her pocket and put it on. Magnus: What happened then? Nordlund: Then- Then I tried to run, but they saw me. I tripped a bit and looked back up. All seven of them were staring straight at me. The leader pointed at me and they all waved. At the same fucking time, like it was some movie. So I ran back home. I don\u2019t know why I felt it was the right thing to do at the time. I then called the police where they took my statement and I left straight back here. Larsson: If you had reported it, then why did you run away from us, when you thought we were the police? (The witness does not speak.) Larsson: Ms. Nordlund, I assure you, we will keep you safe. Nordlund: They were with the police. Magnus: Excuse me? Nordlund: At least, that's what I thought. The night I got back, I was in my apartment when I got an answer at my door. There was a man claiming to be a police officer sent for further questioning. I checked the peephole and there was this official looking guy. I unlocked the door and it swung open hitting me in the head, knocking me out. When I came to, I was lying face down on the floor. I tried to get up but I felt pressure on my back and the back of my head. I heard a male voice telling me not to move or he\u2019ll shoot. He told me very matter-of-factly not to interfere in their business. He said if I reported anything else to the police, he would know and he would hurt my son. (She begins sniffling.) Nordlund: I just stayed there looking at the ground as I felt the pressure release. He told me to keep looking down and to remember his words. The next thing I knew, the door was opening and shutting behind me. I didn\u2019t dare move for an hour. When I got up, I was blank. I couldn\u2019t think. I felt the mafia was after me. After a while, I realised I had to leave this place, so I packed up. That\u2019s when I met you guys. <End Log>",

As Dr Stenmark arrives at his end of the interview table, they both greet each other cordially.] [Extraneous details have been cut for brevity] SCP-8017-B-1: And that\u2019s how it is done, Dr. Stenmark. Dr. Stenmark: That was interesting, Martin. SCP-8017-B-1: It feels good talking to someone as curious as I am. So much to explore and learn. Dr. Stenmark: Indeed\u2026 Speaking of which, something\u2019s been tugging at me. SCP-8017-B-1: Well then, ask away! Dr. Stenmark: I remember you telling me that you saw several players, yes? SCP-8017-B-1: I believe so? Dr. Stenmark: You see\u2026 that\u2019s the issue. According to your game, you were created by a guy named Andreas Martinsson. He was an indie developer. That means he worked by himself. SCP-8017-B-1: (Pauses) Okay? Dr. Stenmark: So, I was wondering\u2026 How did you see so many other players? SCP-8017-B-1: I don\u2019t know, Traveller. Perhaps they were friends who came to test. Dr. Stenmark: Yeah, I thought so as well. But the thing is from what we found in notes in his house, this was a secret project he had been doing. No one had played it yet. So, how\u2019d you see so many different people? SCP-8017-B-1: I really don\u2019t know, researcher. All I see is when the player character meets me. Through him, I see your world. Dr. Stenmark: (Jots down notes.) Okay then. Let\u2019s move on to more pressing issues. I believe you are aware of Andy\u2019s death. SCP-8017-B-1: \u2026I'm afraid I am not. What happened? Dr. Stenmark: Heart attack. Caused by chronic stress. But that's not all. SCP-8017-B-1: No? Dr. Stenmark: 16 people, all either family members or friends of Andrea were killed. Murdered viciously, I\u2019d specify. I was going to ask you if you know anything about it, Martin. SCP-8017-B-1: I\u2026 I really don\u2019t. (Researcher Stenmark opens his file to the sketch of the assailant and pushes it towards the subject.) Dr. Stenmark: This is the picture of one of the killers. You recognise it? SCP-8017-B-1: (Looks down and back up) No, Sir. Dr. Stenmark: No? This isn't familiar to you? SCP-8017-B-1: No, Sir. Dr. Stenmark: The men who got me this picture are fighting for their life in the hospital, Martin. You're telling me you don't know? SCP-8017-B-1: I'm- I'm sorry researcher. I truly don't. I just existed in the game and became aware. Dr. Stenmark: That's interesting. You know so much about the player by just watching him, and you don\u2019t know what happened to him even though he died in front of his own computer. SCP-8017-B-1: Do not jape me, good Sir! We couldn\u2019t have known. He was playing around one night, then the computer was unplugged. Next thing I heard we were at what you call a police station. Dr. Stenmark: \u2026How did you know the computer was unplugged? (SCP-8017-B-1 remains silent.) Dr. Stenmark: SCP-8017-B-1, answer my questions, please. What happened to Andy and the others that night? What do you know about the fire at the KAYAN game studio? (The subject stares at Dr. Stemark with a grim face.) SCP-8017-B-1: I think you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome, Traveller. (It gets up and walks to its living quarters.) Dr. Stenmark: SCP-8017-B-1. Martin. Answer me, goddammit! (The subject remained unresponsive for 10 minutes, fidgeting with itself. Interview cut short.) <End Log> Closing Statement: [SCP-8017-B-1 has information about these incidents. We will have to make it speak.]",
        "Interviewed: SCP-8017-B-1 Interviewer: Director Dr. Henry Marsten, Lead Researcher Jack Stenmark Foreword: [Both men are seated at the table. Dr. Stenmark is seen fiddling with his pen. SCP-8017-B-1 shuffles into the interview chamber. It is noticeably dishevelled. It takes a moment to look at Director Marsten before sitting down.] <Begin Log> (Director Marsten gestures for Dr. Stenmark to begin speaking.) Dr. Stenmark: Uh, hello there Martin. SCP-8017-B-1: Greetings, researcher. Who\u2019s this finely dressed gentleman? (Dr. Stenmark makes a glance at the Director.) Dr. Stenmark: This, Martin, is Dr. Henry Marsten. He is our Site Director. (SCP-8017-B-1 cocks its head.) Dr. Stenmark: He\u2019s the head of the building we\u2019re in now, called a site. SCP-8017-B-1: Ah. So a king to his castle, yes? Dr. Stenmark: Correct. SCP-8017-B-1: Well salutations, your Highness. (The subject gets up and bows as it says this. Director Marsten nods and motions for it to sit back down) SCP-8017-B-1: The King is very quiet, I see. Dr. Stenmark: Yes. He is. Director Marsten: Enough with the pleasantries, Dr. Stenmark. Please begin the questioning. Dr. Stenmark: Yes. Sorry, Sir. Um\u2026 Martin, can\u2026 Director Marsten: Please use designations, Dr. Stenmark. (At this, SCP-8017-B-1 turns towards the Director.) Dr. Stenmark: \u2026SCP-8017-B-1, I need to ask you again about the murders. SCP-8017-B-1: I already told you, Traveller, I have no idea what happened. This is getting on my nerves. It\u2019s an interesting feeling\u2026 but I don\u2019t like it. Now stop. Dr. Stenmark: SCP-8017-B-1 there must have bee- SCP-8017-B-1: Oh\u2026 why do you keep blathering on this? So much pleasure to experience here. So many sensations to savour. Why bother about a few murders, researcher? People die all the time, but new ones spawn in to take their place. Come\u2026 settle down and let\u2019s discuss these sensations I\u2019ve been feeling. Director Marsten: No. We won\u2019t be doing that, SCP-8017-B-1. (Director Marsten leans forward in his seat.) SCP-8017-B-1: Ah, so the King can speak. Director Marsten: Yes. And you will answer. I\u2019ve been\u2026 observing your research for a while now and despite learning much about your\u2026 eccentricities and society, I must say the recent experiments being conducted seem to only be for indulgence. As much as (staring at Dr. Stenmark) we\u2019d like to provide our subjects, we have limited resources and thus should assess if their provision is necessary. Do you\u2026 understand what I\u2019m saying? SCP-8017-B-1: Hmmm\u2026 no. Director Marsten: (Grunts) Let me rephrase- SCP-8017-B-1: I disagree. Director Marsten: I beg your pardon? SCP-8017-B-1: I understand you see me as a prisoner, but I disagree. Being a fellow researcher, I desire to use my vessel for experimentation. And my field of choice is the sensations and pleasures of your world. It makes me realise how bland the world in the computer truly is. I\u2019m bombarded with feelings now, and not all of them feel good, hence the medication courtesy of Dr. Stenmark. To limit me from these experiences would be a great disservice to my role, your research, and my very being. Director Marsten: So you think of yourself as a researcher? SCP-8017-B-1: Indeed. For my kind, on the cutting edge of experience. (Director Marsten chuckles quietly for a while before turning to Dr. Stenmark.) Dr. Stenmark: Sir? Director Marsten: Look at you. You\u2019ve made this thing think it\u2019s one of us. That\u2019s commendable. SCP-8017-B-1: Excuse me, good Sir, but I\u2019m not a thing. Director Marsten: Yes, you are SCP-8017-B-1. You are an anomaly in containment. SCP-8017-B-1: An anomaly? Meaning not normal? Director Marsten: Correct. You are far from human. SCP-8017-B-1: \u2026You\u2019re right. That must mean I\u2019m special. Director Marsten: Sure you are. Stenmark, I\u2019ve seen enough. Let- (SCP-8017-B-1 pronounces a cigarette and box of matches.) Director Marsten: You gave him matches?! Are you out of your mind? (The entity strikes the match lights the cigarette.) SCP-8017-B-1: Relax. I\u2019m careful with it. Already been burnt once, never again, am I right? (He breathes in deeply before blowing directly towards the glass in front of Director Marsten. The smoke obscures subject. It doesn\u2019t blink as its eye turn red.) SCP-8017-B-1: (Coughs.) Are you scared of me, weak man? (It takes another deep puff.) SCP-8017-B-1: Scared I show potential? That I may walk among you and maybe take your place as king? Director Marsten: I think we are done here. (SCP-8017 smothers the cigarette then stands up and begins unzipping its uniform.) Director Marsten: What in the name of- (The uniform drops to the floor and it starts taking off its shirt.) Director Marsten: Security! SCP-8017-B-1: LOOK AT ME! (Both men turn to face the subject. It drops the shirt and it is now fully nude. The subject's entire front upper body and thighs are revealed to have undergone scarification, the result being an intricate pattern of scale-like bumps and cuts across the body. The cuts on its upper back are fresh and bleeding.) SCP-8017-B-1: Am I not a man?! Am I not like you?! Do I not bleed like you? ANSWER ME! Director Marsten: Security! SCP-8017-B-1: LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! (Guards enter the containment chamber and secure the subject. It keeps repeating the phrase while crying as the researchers leave.) <End Log> Closing Statement: [SCP-8017-B-1 appeared to have suffered a manic episode during the interview. Treatment of its wounds by medical personnel is underway and its room is to be searched for any cutting instruments.]",
        "Excuse me, Director Marsten. I know that you are the head of this site now, but may I still talk to you? There\u2019s something really bothering me. After how you helped with my thesis? Of course, Angie! What\u2019s up? henry, i don\u2019t know how to say this but you know how jack and i are engaged now, right? Yes, I was there. sorry, it\u2019s just Angela, is he cheating on you? no nothing like that. he\u2019s been more in his thoughts ever since you\u2019ve had that interview with him. i was worried the stress may have been getting to him. though i have to be honest, i\u2019m concerned too with how he\u2019s been experimenting with SCP-8017-B-1. i feel jack created it. Explain? after falling sick during the incident i did a stool test. the results came back a week later and the doctor said i had a high concentration of antibiotics and laxatives in my blood. i was shocked and didn\u2019t know what caused it. then I remembered jack giving me a brownie. i couldn\u2019t believe it at first. i even told myself he ate the brownie from the same box, it couldn\u2019t have been that. it was jack. we were friends. then a few days ago, i was at his house and was feeling sick so he told me to get some meds from behind the bathroom mirror. i found the medicine but i also found two half bottle of antibiotics and laxatives. it was the same type they found in my system. i hid my worry from him as much as i could. i\u2019m praying that i\u2019m paranoid but i think jack poisoned me. and with how SCP-8017 has performed under him, I think he may be working with it. i wanted to tell someone. but he was doing so well and i loved him. i couldn\u2019t bear hurting him like that because of my doubting. but i don\u2019t know anymore Angie, this is an extremely concerning matter. I should tell you you should have informed higher-ups earlier, but I see your concern and that is moot. I\u2019ll be honest, I have been finding the developments in SCP-8017\u2019s behaviour and Jack's response to them odd at best and concerning at worst. I also suspect he may have something to do with Dr. Janowski's demise, but I don\u2019t have concrete proof. You, however, can help me there. This is for the good of the foundation, Angie. If he was willing to poison you, of all people, he has no sympathy in my heart and he is a threat to our operations. Help me look for anything else that could prove your theory and I will help you.",
