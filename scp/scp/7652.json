Personnel who are capable of producing viable sperm, or who have within the previous 96 hours had sexual contact with such an individual, are not to approach within 150m of the shores of Sullivan Island.\n\n\nSCP-7652 is to be given one live adult male rat (\nRattus norvegicus domesticus\n) of proven fertility\n1\n every three days. This is a starvation diet, at SCP-7652\u2019s own request. If SCP-7652 needs to heal from a serious injury, including but not limited to burns and broken bones, she is to be given one live adult male rabbit (\nOryctolagus cuniculus\n) of proven fertility.\n\n\nSCP-7652 is to be considered as having strong chemical sensitivities; personnel visiting Sullivan Island are not to wear perfumed or scented products, and bedding and clothing for SCP-7652 must not contain synthetic polymers.\n\n\nSCP-7652 is permitted to grow her own medical-grade marijuana (\nCannabis indica\n) in containment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7652 is an entity resembling a female human in approximately her late 80s to early 90s, who sustains herself on the \u201csexual energy\u201d of male mammals. SCP-7652 self-describes as a \u201csuccubus\u201d, but specifies that she is \u201cretired\u201d, and has taken orders as a celibate Buddhist nun.\n\n\nSCP-7652 does not require food, but obtains nourishment by making skin contact with a fertile male mammal, at which point the male experiences an extended sexual climax which continues until its death 120 to 180 seconds later. SCP-7652 has stated that although humans are her optimal prey species, she can feed on any male mammal, with the amount of nourishment provided being directly proportional to their physical size, to the amount of her skin that makes contact with theirs, and to the duration of that contact. She reports that her cravings for sustenance intensify with the proximity of male mammals, and has an anomalous awareness of all male mammals within a radius of approximately 100m, such that she can not only locate them, but identify their number, species, and approximate age and level of sexual activity; this awareness is lessened by the regular consumption of marijuana, as are her cravings.\n\n\nSCP-7652 claims to have been active since at least the mid-18th century; while this is unverifiable, it is supported by her ability to reverse injuries and signs of aging upon consumption of sufficient sexual energy. As well, she experiences anomalously rapid hair growth, but shaves her head daily.\n\n\nSCP-7652 claims to have further anomalous abilities linked to her succubus nature, including but not limited to \u201clow-level shapeshifting\u201d and \u201csort of flight\u201d, which she claims to lack the energy to demonstrate, and \u201ctargeted irresistibility\u201d and \u201cpretty much mind control\u201d over any male human within approximately 70m, which she refuses to demonstrate on moral and ethical grounds.\n\n\nSCP-7652 spends her time in containment praying and meditating, gardening, painting, and doing historical research so as to more precisely identify the men she killed prior to her \"retirement\", which she states is a necessary component of her penance.\n\n\n\n\nInterview log 7652-3\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n Sometimes I get sick of being so old, you know? My joints ache, and my bones are weak, and I think about being young again. It\u2019d be so easy. All I\u2019d have to do would be grab a few men and drain them dry. But\u2026 <sighs>\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n But\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n But demons go to hell.\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n Do Buddhists believe in hell?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n I\u2019m not sure you noticed, but I\u2019m not a very good Buddhist. <laughs> But even if there isn\u2019t really a hell, and even if I\u2019m not really a \ndemon\n\u2026 it\u2019d be killing people. Do you know how many men I\u2019ve killed?\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n Honestly, no.\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n \nNeither do I.\n I\u2019ve thought about it, and I can remember at least sixty distinct incidents, over the centuries. But I know there were more. A lot more. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t keep track, it didn\u2019t seem important. But I\u2019ve \u2026 I\u2019ve read about what happened to their families, afterward. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n How old \nare\n you?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n Don\u2019t know that either. I\u2019m pretty sure I was in Paris during the Reign of Terror, at least. Maybe 80% sure. But I already knew what I was at that point. You\u2019ve read Loftus on false memories?\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n I have, yes.\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n I know I was in France, I know I saw Napoleon. I know I\u2019m not \nfrom\n France. I remember crossing the border from\u2026 was it Switzerland? There was this gorgeous young customs officer \u2013 oh. Fuck. <buries face in hands> Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n What? What is it? Are you okay?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n Sixty-\none\n distinct incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview log 7652-4\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n So what led you to, well\u2026 quit?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n I was at a rock festival. This was\u2026 oh shit, let\u2019s see, it wasn\u2019t Woodstock, it definitely wasn\u2019t Altamont\u2026 don\u2019t think it was Lollapalooza\u2026 maybe Burning Man? You\u2019d think I\u2019d remember that better. It was a place with a lot of people getting high, I can tell you that. Which I guess doesn\u2019t narrow things down all that much <laughs>. Anyway, I\u2019d gone there to\u2026 well, to hunt. To\u2026 I\u2019d gone there with the intention of picking a random man out of the crowd, and dragging him off into a secluded spot and killing him. Ending his life. Committing murder.\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n Do you need a moment?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n No. Thank you, no, I\u2019m okay. Anyway, one thing I\u2019d learned about rock festivals was that all the pot really cut down on my cravings, and I was starting to actually watch people as \npeople\n, not just as prey. Plus\u2026 okay, to be honest, it wasn\u2019t just the pot, I was trying basically everything. Ketamine, shrooms, acid, ecstasy\u2026 the ecstasy really, really helped. I\u2026 don\u2019t suppose the Foundation could get me some?\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n I don\u2019t think so, no.\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n <laughs> Worth asking. Anyway, that\u2019s when I met [REDACTED]. And I tried to turn on the charm and\u2026 it didn\u2019t work. I mean, he went with me, but he just wanted to talk. And he wasn\u2019t gay \u2013 I\u2019ve met gay men, they\u2019re absolutely not immune to me. But [REDACTED], he just\u2026 I dunno. We talked about the universe and about souls and the nature of evil and the shitty, shitty music that was playing, all night long. And I kept expecting that he\u2019d reach for me and then I\u2019d be on him and drain him \u2013 and \nkill\n him \u2013 and that\u2019d be it\u2026 but he didn\u2019t. We just talked, and in the morning he said he\u2019d had a wonderful time and maybe we\u2019d see each other again.\n\n\nAnd after the festival, I\u2026 okay, after the festival I was starving so I\u2026 killed a truck driver. But after \nthat\n, I tracked [REDACTED] down and surprised him at his house. And we talked more, and we smoked a \nlot\n of pot and did a \nlot\n of ecstasy, and eventually I told him what I really was, and he\u2026 he forgave me. It was his idea that maybe I could live off animals instead of killing people. I felt so stupid when he pointed that out. He was my friend. He made me want to be\u2026 better. I moved in with him, and I learned to be a\u2026 well, to be a person, I guess. A person who cared about other people, instead of a predator who just imitated their behavior. And after he died, I thought about going back to the hunt, which is a terrible euphemism for \u2018I thought about murdering people again\u2019, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I thought about killing myself, but I knew that would\u2019ve made [REDACTED] sad. He\u2019d had some friends who were Buddhists, so I got them to put me in touch with a temple, help me keep away from the general public.\n\n\nDr. Langstrom:\n Did you ever find out why he was immune to you?\n\n\nSCP-7652:\n Stage-four testicular cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. defined as having fathered at least one litter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7652\n\" by Voct, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
