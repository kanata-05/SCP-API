Any individuals who wish to perform testing upon SCP-4342 are free to do so.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4342 is a folded paper cube with a mild glow emanating from its interior. Incredibly, when exposed to external stimuli, SCP-4342 is capable of changing the colour of this glowing light as well as doing something on occasion. Due to the miraculous nature of these anomalous properties, SCP-4342 is currently under intensive testing.\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4342-1:\n\n\nFor experimental purposes, SCP-4342 was exposed to a variety of stimuli, with any responses being recorded.\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being touched by Dr. Marsleigh.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being left in a dark room.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being locked in a small box.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n\n\nFascinating\u2026\n - Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being thrown against a wall.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 does something. As a result, the wall becomes lost\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n A dead body.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Marsleigh\n\n\nStimuli:\n A medium-rare sirloin steak.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 does something. As a result, Dr. Marsleigh becomes lost\n2\n.\n\n\nWhile the loss of Dr. Marsleigh is unfortunate, the advances SCP-4342 could bring us mean we simply cannot abandon our research. Testing shall continue.\n - Dr. Shaw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Shaw\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being set alight.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Shaw\n\n\nStimuli:\n Being spat on.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes blue, then becomes red.\n\n\nThis is a milestone in our understanding of SCP-4342.\n - Dr. Shaw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Dr. Shaw\n\n\nStimuli:\n SCP-682\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 becomes blue.

Site-22 becomes lost, along with all on-site personnel and anomalies\n3\n.\n\n\nThe risks of testing SCP-4342 are far outweighed by the benefits. More test.\n - Site Director Bir (Site-44)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Personnel:\n Site Director Bir\n\n\nStimuli:\n Shot at by security personnel.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4342 does something.
