In the case of an SCP-4580-1 event, MTF Theta-8 are to be relocated to whichever Foundation site is nearest to the new location of SCP-4580.\n\n\nCivilians are to be kept away from SCP-4580 at all times. If a civilian does manage to interact with SCP-4580, they are to be apprehended, questioned, and then administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n\nAny Foundation personnel 03 or below must receive permission from the site manager of whichever site MTF Theta-8 are currently stationed at if they wish to communicate with SCP-4580. All questions for SCP-4580 must approved in advance by the acting site manager.\n\n\nD-Class personnel are to under no circumstance be allowed to communicate with SCP-4580.\n\n\nUnder no circumstance are personnel to attack SCP-4580.\n\n\nAny location that SCP-4580 chooses is to be immediatly closed off to the public. If questioned, personnel are to state one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nThe tree which the ravens have chosen has been discovered to be an endangered species.\n\n\nThe tree is infected with a dangerous parasite capable of traveling on humans, so the area is closed off the prevent further contamination.\n\n\nThe ravens on the tree are extremely hostile, and <insert number here> civilians have already been attacked.\n\n\n\n\nAny further excuses are to be approved by the acting MTF Theta-8 commander.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4580 is a flock of \nCorvus corax\n (common raven), currently consisting of 37 ravens of three variations (designated SCP-4580-1, SCP-4580-2, and SCP-4580-3). SCP-4580 instances have not been observed eating, sleeping, or defecating. The flock migrates approximately once every one to five years; the longest recorded time between migrations was ten years, four months, and twenty-seven days. If any instance of SCP-4580-1 is killed, it will disappear, leaving its feathers behind.\n\n\nSCP-4580-1 appears to be physically identical to a normal specimen of \nCorvus corax\n, at least externally. Due to the fact that SCP-4580-1 disappears in exception to its feathers upon death, no successful autopsy of SCP-4580-1 has ever been achieved. All instances of SCP-4580-1 will generally leave SCP-4580-4 at some point during the day, generally returning five to ten hours afterword. It is believed that they are listening in on people's conversations and collecting secrets during this time. Once they return, each instance of SCP-4580-1 will whisper something to SCP-4580-2, before perching on a branch of SCP-4580-4 (the tree that SCP-4580 are currently located on). They will then generally wait three to seven hours before leaving again.\n\n\nSCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 take the form of significantly larger than normal ravens (84 centimeters tall). SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 are very similar in appearance in exception to coloration, as SCP-4580-2 is primarily black with the runes \n\u16d7\u16d6\u16d7\u16df\u16b1\u16a4\n in white on its right wing, while SCP-4580-3 is primarily white, with the runes \n\u16cf\u16ba\u16df\u16a2\u16b7\u16ba\u16cf\n in black on its right wing. SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will always sit at the highest point of SCP-4580-4. For more information on SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3, see document 4580-A.\n\n\nWhen the runes engraved on the side of SCP-4580-4 are spoken aloud within ten meters of SCP-4580-4, both SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will go to whoever said the words, who will from here on out be refered to as the subject. They will then transform into humanoid figures. When they transform, a large cloud of black or white feathers will form around both SCPs, which will disipate in approximately ten seconds, to reveal both the SCPs newly transformed; both entities are entirely covered in feathers wearing clay masks. SCP-4580-2 will have black feathers with a white mask, while SCP-4580-3 will be the opposite. Both of these have the runes usually written on the SCP's right wing written on the mask. Both figures stand approximately three and quarter meters tall. SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will both be able to fluently speak whatever language the words that summoned them were spoken in.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 have transformed, they will ask the subject if they have come for secrets. If the subject says no, SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will transform back into ravens and fly away. If the subject says yes, SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will ask what they are willing to give in return. SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will accept several different forms of payment. These include lustrous metals such as gold or silver, gem stones, or other secrets. Once the subject has made their payment to SCP-4580-2 (all payments must be made to SCP-4580-2 as SCP-4580-3 will not accept payment), SCP-4580-3 will tell the subject the requested secret, before turning back into ravens and returning to their perch on SCP-4580-4, unless the subject requests another secret. SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 may only be summoned three times a day, and any attempt to summon them beyond that will result in no response.\n\n\nIf an individual attempts to attack any instance of SCP-4580, either physically or verbally, both SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will make a very loud cawing sound, and all instances of SCP-4580-1 will begin to fly in circles around the person who attempted to attack them until the person is no longer visible. The instances of SCP-4580-1 will continue to encircle the person for approximately ten more seconds, before dissipating and revealing what is believed to be the attacker transformed into an instance of SCP-4580-1. That instance of SCP-4580-1 will then join SCP-4580.\n\n\nSCP-4580-4 takes the form of any tree that SCP-4580 has chosen during an SCP-4580-1 event. SCP-4580 most commonly chooses \nFraxinus\n (ash tree), however, if \nFraxinus\n are not present in the region, they will choose any tree they find suitable. SCP-4580 will generally choose a tree in or near a highly populated area. This tree must also be large enough to support the entire flock. Once SCP-4580 chooses a tree, they will land on it, and the runes \n\u16cb\u16d6\u16b2\u16b1\u16d6\u16cf \u16b4\u16d6\u16d6\u16c8\u16d6\u16b1\u16cb \u16cb\u16d6\u16b2\u16b1\u16d6\u16cf \u16b4\u16d6\u16d6\u16c8\u16d6\u16b1\u16cb \u16cb\u16ba\u16df\u16b9 \u16a4\u16df\u16a2\u16b1\u16cb\u16d6\u16da\u16a1\u16d6\u16cb \u16cf\u16df \u16d7\u16d6\n will manifest carved into the side of the tree. For an unknown reason, the tree will be incapable of healing over the runes. The process by which these runes appear is currently unknown. When translated, these runes say, \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588.\" If these words are spoken in any language within ten meters of SCP-4580-4, then SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 will descend and transform, and the previousely discussed process will occur.\n\n\nAn SCP-4580-1 event occurs when all instances of SCP-4580-1 through SCP-4580-3 leave the current instance of SCP-4580-4. From that point on, they will fly to somewhere else in the world and choose a new instance of SCP-4580-4. Instances of SCP-4580-4 that SCP-4580 leaves behind will retain the runes carved into their side, however, speaking them aloud within ten meters of the tree will no longer have an effect.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-4580 was originally discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Norway after reports by the local police of people being turned into ravens. Supposedly, SCP-4580 had chosen a tree in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's backyard as SCP-4580-4. Having the ravens there supposedly, \"Creeped her out\", so she contacted local exterminators to remove the SCP-4580. However, when the exterminators attempted to place an instance of SCP-4580-1 in a bag, they were both transformed into instances of SCP-4580-1.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 then contacted her local police, who then contacted the Foundation. The Foundation proceeded to evict \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from her home, which was designated Site-\u2588\u2588. Approximately two years and three weeks after Site-\u2588\u2588 was established, SCP-4580 attempted to go through an SCP-4580-1 event. MTF Theta-8 were called in to re-contain SCP-4580, however, during the attempt, two of its members were transformed into instances of SCP-4580-1. Due to this, MTF Theta-8 was instead instructed to enact the current containment procedures.\n\n\nAdditional Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Document\u00a04580-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a04580-A:\u00a0An\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-4580-2\u00a0and\u00a0SCP-4580-3\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Hardacker\n\n\nForeword:\n A fake construction zone, manned by MTF Theta-8 acting as construction workers, has been set up around the current location of SCP-4580 so that they may be interviewed without interference.\n\n\n<Begin Log, January 14, 20\u2588\u2588>\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Hello there.\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Hello, Dr. Hardacker.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n So you already know my name?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n You study us so intently, we thought you would expect it by now.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n I did, I did. So, do you mind if I ask you some questions?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n That's what we do.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Very good. So, SCP-45-\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Don't call us that.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Why not?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n It is degrading.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Uhg, fine. What would you prefer I call you?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n You may call me Muninn.\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n And you may call me Huginn.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Ok then, so, how long have you existed?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Doctor, you should know by now that secrets are not free.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Oh yes, of course.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker motions for a guard to approach the table, who places a twenty-four karat gold ingot weighing 26.3 ounces, which SCP-4580-2 then takes\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Very good, very good.\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n What was it that you wanted to know again?\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n How long have you existed, exactly?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n We have existed since the dawn and fall of the Aesir.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n The what?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n The war gods, the ones who came before man, but after the Vanir, gods of nature and fertility.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n You're stating this like it's common knowledge, but I have no idea what you are talking about.\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Why do you ask questions that you will not understand the answer to, doctor?\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Well, if I never ask, how will I even have a chance of understanding?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Fair point.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n So, Huginn, who originally created you two?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Ah, yes.\n\n\nThe guard places another gold ingot on the table, which SCP-4580-2 once again takes\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Yes, this is quite nice\u2026\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Well doctor, we were created by the one with many names. He is known as Foldardr\u00f3ttinn, Fa\u00f0mbyggvir Friggjar, Fundinn, or as you most likely know him, Odin.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n You mean like, the norse god Odin? The \"All Father\"?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n That is correct.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Ok then\u2026 do you know why Odin supposedly created you? Wait, first\u2026\n\n\nThe guard places $1,500 in cash on the table\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n This is worthless to us.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Fine.\n\n\nAnother gold ingot is placed on the table which SCP-4580-2 takes\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Well, Odin created us to fly across the nine realms and gather all sorts of secrets and information, and then to return, and whisper the secrets of the world into his ears, for as All Father, Odin must know what is to occur in his domain.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Ok, then why aren't you with Odin now?\n\n\nBoth SCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 appear to bow their heads in mourning\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Are you two ok?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Give us a moment. We must honor the All Father.\n\n\nSCP-4580-2 and SCP-4580-3 continue bowing their heads for another minute before returning to conversation\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Are you ready to talk now?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n Yes.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Ok, one moment please\u2026\n\n\nThe guard places two silver ingots, both weighing 13 ounces, which SCP-4580-2 takes\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n You see? This far more usefull than your pieces of green paper.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n So why aren't you with Odin?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n You see, when the mighty All Father died in the jaws of Fenrir, the great wolf, son of Loki, we were left alone to wander the world without a purpose. That is, until we came to a realisation. We realised that the All Father would have wanted us to spread knowledge to Midgard, for that is the kingdom of his favorite creations, in exception to his direct children.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Sure, sure\u2026 so, almost done, why do you go through SCP-4580-1 events?\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n We don't know what you are refering to.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n I'm sorry, I'm talking about when you leave your current tree and choose a new one.\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Doctor, you're missing something.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Oh, right.\n\n\nThe guard places an eighteen karat daimond weighing 12.9 ounces on the table, which SCP-4580-2 inspects before taking\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Very well then.\n\n\nSCP-4580-3:\n The reason we choose a new tree is quite simple, you see, when we have learned of all the good and interesting secrets in an area, we leave, and choose a new place with new secrets.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Is that why you are always located near things like cities and towns?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Exactly.\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n Last question. Why do you require people to trade for secrets? Why not give them away for free?\n\n\nSCP-4580-2:\n Ah, for this, we do not require a trade. You see doctor, it's simple, if anyone could have any secret for free, then it wouldn't be a secret any more, would it?\n\n\nDr. Hardacker:\n I suppose not. Well, it has been nice talking to you.
