I'm really, really scared.\n\n\nBRADSON:\n Tell me what he's saying, Eddy, and I'll let you see your mother.\n\n\nSCP-8055-26:\n He says you drilled holes in my arm until it fell apart. He says you keep cutting me into pieces and making me forget. He says you're not going to stop. Please, please, let me see my mom. My head hurts so bad. I don't want to be here anymore.\n\n\nBRADSON:\n Hey. It's okay, Eddy. You're going to see her real soon, I promise.\n\n\n[ 48 second pause ]\n\n\nSCP-8055-26:\n Jesus wants to tell you something.\n\n\nBRADSON:\n What's that, Eddy?\n\n\nSCP-8055-26:\n He says people are going to know someday.\n\n\nBRADSON:\n I doubt that very much, Eddy.
