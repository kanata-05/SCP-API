Until then, SCP-8922 is kept in Site-59's ROB\n1\n and monitored constantly.\n\n\nNo further attempts are to be made to extract SCP-8922-B from SCP-8922's left arm.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8922 is a steel and plastic android, 2m in height and 205.102\u00a0kg in mass\n2\n. It is feminine and humanoid in shape, and its internal workings follow a human-analogous design philosophy\n3\n.\n\n\nUpon discovery, SCP-8922 was clothed in a charred Chicago Bulls jersey with Michael Jordan's name and number. There was also a baseball cap, fitted backwards, with a picture of the comic strip character Garfield surfing.\n\n\nDue to heavy damage sustained from an unknown incident, SCP-8922's legs have ceased functioning. Its primary means of locomotion involves using SCP-8922-A to pull itself forward.\n\n\nBehavior:\n While not actively hostile, SCP-8922 is fiercely protective of SCP-8922-B, and violently resists any attempts to touch it or take it away - most often by pointing and activating SCP-8922-A. Other than this, SCP-8922 is generally unresponsive with Foundation personnel, save for a shortlist of 7 staff members that it trusts.\n\n\nIt answers to the name \"Konse,\" gleaned from a corrupted vocalization.\n\n\nWhen alone, SCP-8922 generally remains motionless, making garbled, sad purring noises to SCP-8922-B.\n\n\nSCP-8922-A:\n SCP-8922's right forearm has been permanently fused with SCP-8922-A, a large, spear-shaped firearm that accounts for 23% of its total mass.\n\n\nBased on current labels, SCP-8922-A was, at one point, called \"BELUGA-58 KOLOKO WAVE PROJECTOR\", but was renamed \"SUNFUKKUR 9000\" sometime thereafter.\n\n\nThe capabilities of SCP-8922-A are not understood, as there is no record of it ever being fired.\n\n\nSCP-8922-B:\n SCP-8922-B refers to a jagged, spherical mass of electronics that SCP-8922 holds in its left arm, approximately 0.5\u00a0m in width. SCP-8922's behavior has consistently hindered further analysis of SCP-8922-B.\n\n\nWhile SCP-8922 had been capable of speech at one point, its vocal processor has been heavily damaged. The majority of vocalizations are too distorted by static to decipher. It only speaks clearly when expressing an intense emotion.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 8922-14\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Researcher Jacob Field\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8922\n\n\nDate:\n 12/20/2024\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n[Field enters SCP-8922's ROB Chamber.]\n\n\nField:\n Good afternoon, Konse, how are we doing to\u2014\n\n\n[SCP-8922-A starts humming and emitting smoke. Its tip starts spinning. SCP-8922 points the weapon at Field. He points his hands up.]\n\n\nSCP-8922:\n \nNOT YOURS!\n\n\nField:\n Easy there! No need for the fireworks, buddy.
