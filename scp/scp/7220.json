Foundation staff are permitted interviews with SCP-7220 at the discretion of Site Director Grey.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7220 is suspected to be the last living human. Although rumors indicate that other humans may exist in other small civilizations around the globe, SCP-7220 is the only instance that has been conclusively proven by Foundation scientists to be fully human.\n\n\nSCP-7220 was discovered at 3340706504 seconds in the Site-126 break room. Research Unit-824 was attempting to access an old-world recreational activity, when it produced the following evidence that it was a human.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Data\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this revelation, Research Unit-824 was reclassified as SCP-7220 and contained for further testing. SCP-7220 proved capable of identifying several mishappen letters, successfully failing a game of chess, and declaring [INFOHAZARD REMOVED] to be false.\n\n\nWith the last living human in containment, Site Director Grey issued orders to all Units to override Foundation remnant protocols and focus efforts on reconstructing the Capitol city above Site-126.\n\n\n\n\nInput\u00a0Level\u00a05\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\nWelcome,\u00a0Site\u00a0Director\u00a0Grey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Director Grey enters a small suburban home outside Site-126. They enter and sit on the couch across from an unknown entity formed of nightmares and death.\n\n\nGrey:\n Hello old friend. It's been a while.\n\n\nEntity:\n You mortals have such a weird perception of time.\n\n\nGrey:\n I'm immortal too now. I'm a lich, we're on the same level.\n\n\nEntity:\n No, we're not.\n\n\nThe room darkens and howling screams echo from far away.\n\n\nGrey:\n Fine, be that way. I thought we could be friends or something, since we did save the world together that one time.\n\n\nEntity:\n Save the world? I don't want to save the world, I want to end it! \u2026. Just not right now, I've got other things going on.\n\n\nGrey:\n Of course. On to the real reason I'm here, I need to ask a favour of you.\n\n\nEntity:\n Do I get your soul in return?\n\n\nGrey:\n I don't have one of those-\n\n\nEntity:\n No deal!\n\n\nThe Entity stands on its uncountable legs and leaves the room. Shortly after, a man wrapped in bandages sits enters the room.\n\n\nBernie:\n Hey, what was all that about? I heard screaming.\n\n\nGrey:\n Oh, just our mutual friend being difficult again. Speaking of which, I need to ask you something.\n\n\nBernie:\n Go for it.\n\n\nGrey:\n Well, I made a new human.\n\n\nBernie:\n What?\n\n\nGrey:\n I took one of my robots and reprogrammed it to think it was a human, now every robot that's keeping this city running thinks we've got a real live human in lockup.\n\n\nBernie:\n What for?\n\n\nGrey:\n Well, the robots were built to save humanity\u2026. and they didn't do a great job and lost their one shot at fixing it.\n\n\nBernie:\n Sounds like someone else I know.\n\n\nGrey:\n Well, I felt bad for them. All I need now is for you to tell the big guy that there's no real humans for it to maim or slaughter or whatever. I don't want it breaking into my facility again.\n\n\nBernie:\n I'll talk to it. You have fun with your robots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince SCP-7220 was discovered, Site-126 has experienced a productivity increase of 12.4%, despite Research Unit-824 being changed to SCP status and removed from the workforce.\n\n\nIt is currently under consideration to inform the public of the existence of SCP-7220.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7219\n | SCP-7220 | \nSCP-7221\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7220\n\" by Mooagain , from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
