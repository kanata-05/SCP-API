Agents are to enter the anomaly unarmed and in civilian clothing to avoid alerting its occupying force. Zeta-9 is to remain in the anomaly for 12 hours each day during its period of activation. No other Foundation personnel are permitted to enter the anomaly under any circumstances. Any Foundation personnel found to be in attendance will face severe repercussions.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6616 is an anomalous convention center that appears annually in major metropolitan areas around the world from October 18th until the 24th. Its annual locations seem to be random, with the only consistent factor being the week long period that it is active. During its period of activation, SCP-6616 acts as grounds for an event called \u201cAnomalyCon\u201d. This annual convention serves as a place where individuals and groups involved with the anomalous can meet and discuss said anomalies freely without fear of backlash or violence from other individuals or groups.\n\n\nThe convention center is occupied by an unidentified group of extremely potent reality benders known as \u201cThe STAFF\u201d (SCP-6616-1). The main objective of the SCP-6616-1 entities seems to be keeping the peace during the conventions period of activation.\n\n\nSCP-6616 itself is weakly antimemetic and cannot be found unless it is being purposely searched for. It is unknown whether this is a property of the building or brought on by the SCP-6616-1 entities. Because of this secondary property, there appears to be no risk of a Broken Masquerade scenario, though keeping civilians away from the center should still be a primary objective.\n\n\nBelow is a log detailing the discovery of SCP-6616, as well as Zeta-9's first encounter with the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 9 / 5 / 2020\n\n\nNOTE:\n SCP-6616 was discovered during a meeting between Dr. Mayhew and a GOC representative concerning a joint project between the Foundation and the GOC. The recording starts directly before the discovery, for convenience.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n Alright, that should be it for today. I\u2019ll have the guys at the lab run the numbers and by next week, we should be ready to get started.\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n Thank God. This thing\u2019s been a major pain in the ass.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n Tell me about it\u2026 damn thing always gets difficult once autumn hits.\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n Yeah. Once they gets those reports ready, make sure you get them to me ASAP. Higher ups are getting a bit antsy. They're ready to get this over with and buried.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n Sure.\n\n\nFootsteps and shuffling paper can be heard.\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n So\u2026 it\u2019s almost that time of year.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n It \nis\n that time of year. Earlier than last, too.\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n No, not that. It\u2019s almost October.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s getting colder already. Pitch black out at like 5\u00a0o\u2019clock-\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n Are you serious?\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n What? I know this isn\u2019t an ideal arrangement, but we can be professional-\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n AnomalyCon, man! It\u2019s almost time for AnomalyCon! How could you forget?\n\n\nThe footsteps and shuffling stop.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n \u2026what?\n\n\nGOC Rep:\n Are you going? I hear it\u2019s in D.C. this year. It\u2019s a bit of a drive, but nothing too bad.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n I don\u2019t\u2026 what?\n\n\nGOC:\n I wanted to go because I didn\u2019t get to last year, but I promised the kids I\u2019d take them camping. So instead of going to the convention, I\u2019m going to be freezing my ass off in Colorado with two 9 year olds. I heard Marshall, Carter and Dark had something pretty big planned this year, too. There are even rumors that one of the Big Three is making an appearance! So you\u2019re going to have to record it for me.\n\n\nDr. Mayhew:\n \u2026what the fuck are you talking about?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst\u00a0Encounter\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log Transcript: First Encounter\n\n\nCommand:\n Researcher Cassidy Moon\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d)\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-6616\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Zeta9-1 (Theta)\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Theta / Rho / Kappa\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nTheta:\n -damn thing! Alright Command, do you have a visual?\n\n\nCommand:\n Affirmative, Theta.\n\n\nTheta:\n About time. Sound off, guys. Sync.\n\n\nRho:\n Sync.\n\n\nKappa:\n Sync!\n\n\nTheta:\n Are we good to go Command?\n\n\nCommand:\n Affirmative. You can start your approach, Theta.\n\n\nTheta:\n Okay. We\u2019re heading out now.\n\n\nZeta-9 begins walking towards SCP-6616.\n\n\nTheta:\n So, what should we expect?\n\n\nCommand:\n We\u2026 really don't know. This is all new for us too.\n\n\nRho:\n Can you tell us anything?\n\n\nCommand:\n We already told you all we know: you are entering an anomalous complex that is supposedly filled with anomalous and non-anomalous persons. Your objective is to stay hidden and retrieve any and all information about the gathering that you can. Is that understood?\n\n\nRho:\n Yeah, yeah, I got that part. But how can we plan on staying hidden if we don't even know what's in there?\n\n\nCommand:\n There are additional personnel on standby that can extract you if need be.\n\n\nRho:\n And who's gonna rescue them if they can't rescue us?\n\n\nThere is no response.\n\n\nRho:\n Great\u2026\n\n\nTheta:\n Command, you said we learned about the anomaly from a member of the GOC, right?\n\n\nCommand:\n Yes. Is there an issue?\n\n\nTheta:\n No. Just a bit confused. The GOC usually aren\u2019t big fans of the anomalous. I can\u2019t see why they\u2019d be going \nin\n an anomaly instead of trying to blow the whole damn thing to kingdom come.\n\n\nCommand:\n That\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re here, Theta. We have some evidence that suggests that this anomaly has proven somewhat\u2026 difficult for the coalition to destroy. Our guess on why the GOC is still here is the same reason we\u2019re sending your team in: to gather information.\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026why do I feel like we\u2019re the last people on earth to find out about this thing?\n\n\nCommand:\n Because we very well might be. We\u2019re still trying to figure out how the anomaly managed to hide from us for so long. We don\u2019t know if they know about the Foundation or not, or if it\u2019s just coincidence. That\u2019s why you are to remain in your disguises, understood?\n\n\nTheta:\n Yes, Command.\n\n\nKappa:\n \u2026wait, who\u2019s they? You said \nthey\n might not know about us.\n\n\nThe response through the radio is inaudible and laced with static.\n\n\nTheta:\n Command, could you repeat that?\n\n\nThere is no response.\n\n\nTheta:\n We're coming up on the building now, do you read me? Command, are you there?\n\n\nThe building comes into view. There is a humanoid figure in front of the building. Theta signals for Rho and Kappa to stop.\n\n\nTheta:\n Hold it, hold it.\n\n\nKappa:\n What? What is it?\n\n\nTheta:\n There\u2019s\u2026 something in front of the anomaly. Goddamnit, they didn\u2019t tell us anything about a fucking guard dog.\n\n\nZeta-9 slows their approach. The humanoid is around 1.8 meters in height and is hovering in place 0.3 meters off of the ground. It is wearing a purple, collared shirt under a black overcoat with black pants and black boots. Purple gloves cover its hands. Its head is out of frame. It has yet to notice Zeta-9.\n\n\nTheta:\n Command, are you seeing this? What is that?\n\n\nThere is no response.\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026what the hell?\n\n\nRho:\n What\u2019s the problem?\n\n\nTheta:\n Command\u2019s not answering\u2026\n\n\nTheta takes the small device out of his ear, looks it over and puts it back.\n\n\nTheta:\n This place must be messing with the radio. Looks like we\u2019re going in dark.\n\n\nRho:\n You\u2019re kidding.\n\n\nTheta:\n I\u2019m not. They were pretty clear that as long as we stay in disguise, we should be fine.\n\n\nRho:\n My disguise is a new shirt and a fake pair of glasses!\n\n\nTheta:\n So stay in them and you\u2019ll be fine!\n\n\nKappa:\n Uhhh, guys?\n\n\nThe humanoid in front of SCP-6616 begins to hover towards them.\n\n\nRho:\n Shit, we're found out!\n\n\nTheta:\n No we\u2019re not! Just act natural. Like a goddamn professional.\n\n\nAs the humanoid gets closer, more details can be discerned. On the right breast of the overcoat is the word \u201cSTAFF\u201d, in white. Pinned to the left breast is a name tag reading \u201cDerek\u201d. The humanoid now hovers directly in front of Zeta-9.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Excuse me.\n\n\nTheta coughs and looks up. Where the humanoids face should be is instead a rectangular, black censor bar that covers its entire head. On the censor bar is the word \u201cSTAFF\u201d. This bar was not added in post, and if any member of Zeta-9 notices it, they do not make it known.\n\n\nTheta:\n Hello\u2026 Derek.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Yeah, hi. Is there something wrong with your ear?\n\n\nTheta:\n Huh? No.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Are you sure? You keep messing with it.\n\n\nTheta:\n Yes, I'm sure. I just\u2026 had to scratch an itch.\n\n\n6616-1:\n \u2026right. Cause, you know, I can\u2019t let you in if you have a bug or something.\n\n\nTheta:\n Well, no need to worry. I\u2019m perfectly healthy. So\u2026 what can we do for you?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Group or individual.\n\n\nTheta:\n What?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Group or individual?\n\n\nTheta:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n6616-1:\n Aren\u2019t you guys supposed to know this stuff before you get here?\n\n\nRho:\n \u2026we\u2019re sorry?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Whatever. Are you here representing a group, or by yourselves?\n\n\nRho:\n Alone! We're all alone.\n\n\n6616-1:\n You want to say it a bit louder? I don\u2019t think everyone in D.C. heard you.\n\n\nRho:\n S-Sorry.\n\n\n6616-1 shrugs.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Alright. Hold out your hands for me. Palm down.\n\n\nRho:\n What\u2019re you gonna do?\n\n\n6616-1:\n I have to stamp you before you can go in. Just a formality. Don\u2019t worry, it only hurts a little.\n\n\nRho takes a step back.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Calm down, man. I was only joking.\n\n\nRho:\n \u2026oh.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Seriously, though. Hands out.\n\n\nTheta, Rho and Kappa all extend their hands. 6616-1 takes a rubber stamp out of its pocket. The symbol on the bottom of the stamp changes instantly from a blue pentagram in front of a globe to the letters INDV. 6616-1 presses the stamp down on the backs of each agent\u2019s hand.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Alright. You should be good to go.\n\n\nTheta:\n Perfect. We\u2019ll be heading inside then.\n\n\nZeta-9 starts towards the entrance to SCP-6616.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hey, wait a second.\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026yeah?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Uhm\u2026\n\n\nKappa:\n What is it?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Look, just\u2026 if you see my supervisor in there, would you mind putting in a good word for me? I\u2019d really appreciate it. We don\u2019t get many individuals around here anymore, so it\u2019d mean a lot if it came from you.\n\n\nRho:\n Uhhh-\n\n\n6616-1:\n You know, just\u2026 mention that the person at the front was nice, or really helpful. Or something.\n\n\nTheta starts inching towards the entrance to the anomaly.\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026sure. If we get the chance, we\u2019ll do it.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Really?\n\n\nTheta:\n Why not.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Thanks. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people just say no. Someone actually complained about me. Me! I know, I didn\u2019t believe it either! I\u2019m telling you, those Broken God assholes need to get those sticks out of their asses or I\u2019m gonna lose my fucking mind.\n\n\nRho:\n We\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re going to go inside now.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hm? Oh, right. Enjoy the convention. Don\u2019t forget, we close at 6. No later.\n\n\nTheta:\n Right.\n\n\nKappa:\n Bye Derek!\n\n\nZeta-9 proceeds into the anomaly.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUEST TO EDIT: SCP-6616\n\n\nThis is a formal request to edit the SCP-6616 document, including new information on the SCP-6616-1 entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n All SCP-6616-1 entities should be considered Keter class sub-anomalous humanoids.\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n To avoid detection, all personnel inside of SCP-6616 should remain in disguise at all times and keep interactions with other patrons to an absolute minimum, unless said interaction would aid in remaining undetected.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6616-1 is the collective designation given to the group of reality benders that patrol SCP-6616. The foundation does not currently know how capable these type greens are, however, according to rumors gathered from patrons of SCP-6616 by Zeta-9, each one is extremely potent. As a group, they are known as \"The STAFF\".\n\n\nEach SCP-6616-1 entity is dressed exactly the same. A purple collared shirt under a black overcoat. Black pants, black boots, and purple gloves. Always on the right breast of the overcoat is the word \u201cSTAFF\u201d in white, while pinned to the left breast is a name tag with the entity\u2019s name on it.\n\n\nCoinciding with their reality bending properties, each SCP-6616-1 entity seems to have a secondary anomalous effect that activates when on recording of any kind. When filmed or photographed, the faces of all SCP-6616-1 entities become covered with black censor bars that read \u201cSTAFF\u201d. According to Zeta-9, all SCP-6616-1 entities encountered within SCP-6616 did have different features (hair color, eye color, body type, ethnicity, etc\u2026). But when asked to recall them, Zeta-9 could not, suggesting that each SCP-6616-1 entity has a similar antimemetic effect to SCP-6616 itself.\n\n\nThe purpose of these entities is enforcing SCP-6616\u2019s only rule: no fighting. The consequences of breaking this rule are unknown, however, it is likely that they are quite severe.*\n\n\nLeading the SCP-6616-1 entities is a being known as The Supervisor. No information on it has been gathered.\n\n\n*As I\u2019m sure you will all recall, we lost contact with our Serpent\u2019s Hand plant on October 20th of last year. This does not seem like a coincidence to me. Poor kid.\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. Thomas Mayhew\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is are logs continuing Zeta-9\u2019s exploration of SCP-6616.\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a0(2)\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log Transcript: Exploration\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d)\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-6616\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Zeta9-1 (Theta)\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Theta / Rho / Kappa\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRho:\n Holy shit\u2026\n\n\nZeta-9 enters the anomaly. Hundreds of people walk around the convention center. Several SCP-6616-1 entities are seen hovering around the center, faces all censored.\n\n\nRho:\n So\u2026 what\u2019s the plan?\n\n\nTheta:\n Command? Hello, can you read me?\n\n\nThere is no response.\n\n\nTheta:\n Damn\u2026 they\u2019re still not answering.\n\n\nKappa:\n Okay, so if Command isn\u2019t picking up, that makes you the boss.\n\n\nTheta:\n Well, we were sent here to gather information. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\n\n\nRho:\n And how do we do that without getting caught?\n\n\nTheta:\n We got past Derek, didn\u2019t we? We just need to act like we belong here, and not like we\u2019re trying to take this entire place and shove it in a box.\n\n\nKappa:\n Maybe we should go back and ask them? Asking someone who works here could be a good idea.\n\n\nTheta:\n No, too public. I doubt they'd be interested in helping, anyway. What about that supervisor they were talking about? Think we could get some information out of them?\n\n\nRho:\n I don\u2019t have any better ideas.\n\n\nKappa:\n How\u2019re we going to find them?\n\n\nTheta:\n Let's see\u2026 ah! Excuse me?\n\n\nAn SCP-6616-1 entity hovers towards Zeta-9. Pinned on the left breast of its overcoat is a name tag reading \u201cAbigail\u201d. Covering its face is a censor bar with the word \u201cSTAFF\u201d displayed on it.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hello there! Is there anything I can do for you?\n\n\nTheta:\n Yes. Do you know where your Supervisor is?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hmmm\u2026 can I see your hands for a moment?\n\n\nKappa:\n Why? We\u2019re not in trouble are we? We didn\u2019t do anything!\n\n\nA low hum riddled with static can be heard as the entity gently shakes its head.\n\n\n6616-1:\n No no no, you misunderstand! I just want to see what group you're here with!\n\n\nTheta extends his hand.\n\n\nTheta:\n We\u2019re all individuals.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hm. We don\u2019t get a lot of your people in attendance anymore. Though, I guess if it's a group of individuals, it's alright. I would just be careful if I were you.\n\n\nThe entity shakes its head, the censor bar moving back and forth.\n\n\n6616-1:\n The world can be a dangerous place for you unaligned\u2026\n\n\nRho:\n Yeah\u2026 so about the Supervisor?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Of course. I\u2019m sorry, but I haven\u2019t seen her in quite a while. She is always terribly busy during the convention. I\u2019m sure you understand. If you have a problem, however, I\u2019d be happy to help! Do you need me to clear something up for you? You three seem new to all of this.\n\n\nTheta laughs.\n\n\nTheta:\n Yeah, it's our first year. Everything's a bit\u2026 overwhelming.\n\n\n6616-1:\n I understand completely! It can be a bit much at times, can't it?\n\n\nTheta:\n Definitely. If you don't mind me asking, when did you start working here?\n\n\nAnother hum can be heard.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Hmmm\u2026 this is my 7th year working at the convention.\n\n\nTheta:\n Interesting\u2026\n\n\n6616-1:\n Why are you asking? Are you interested in applying for a position? I do have to warn you, the application process is quite rigorous-\n\n\nTheta:\n No no, that\u2019s alright. I was just curious.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Oh. Alright!\n\n\nKappa steps in front of Theta, facing the entity.\n\n\nKappa:\n If you see your Supervisor, can you send her our way?\n\n\nThe entity nods.\n\n\n6616-1:\n I\u2019ll try. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you with whatever your problem is.\n\n\nKappa:\n Oh, uhhh\u2026 that's alright. You were plenty helpful. Thanks!\n\n\nThe entity hovers slightly closer.\n\n\n6616-1:\n It's no problem at all! I'll look around for her, but can\u2019t promise anything!\n\n\nTheta:\n Of course. Thank you.\n\n\nThe entity begins to hover away, but stops when Kappa calls out to it.\n\n\nKappa:\n Oh, wait! If you do see her, could you tell her that Derek was very nice and helpful?\n\n\nThe entity turns and hovers back.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Derek? The Derek at the front?\n\n\nKappa:\n I think so\u2026 are there any other Dereks?\n\n\n6616-1:\n No, there aren\u2019t\u2026 and they didn\u2019t pay you to say that?\n\n\nKappa:\n Nope!\n\n\n6616-1:\n Interesting\u2026 alright, if I see Madam Supervisor, I\u2019ll make sure to tell her.\n\n\nKappa:\n Thanks!\n\n\n6616-1:\n And before you go, take this.\n\n\nThe entity hands Kappa a brochure.\n\n\n6616-1:\n The panel starts at 4:45, so don\u2019t be late! It'll be in Panel Room \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n1\n\n\nThe entity hovers away.

The stage is 15 meters long and backed against the north wall of the room. Behind the stage is a large, gray curtain with the letters M, C and D inscribed on it in gold lettering. The team walks down the center aisle of the room, seeing three open seats.\n\n\nTheta:\n Excuse me\u2026 sorry.\n\n\nThe team moves past three individuals while getting to their seats. Two men and one woman, all wearing dark green robes. Each individual has a small snake coiled around a closed fist stamped on the back on their hands. The team sits down in their seats.\n\n\n???:\n So, are you three excited for the presentation?\n\n\nSitting to the right of the team is a man wearing a dark grey, wool sweater. His face appears blurred on the video feed.\n\n\nTheta:\n Yeah, we are. Have you been to many of these before?\n\n\n???:\n Not many, but enough to know how they work. They have a big panel every year. MC&D won the lotto this time\u2026\n\n\nRho:\n What do you mean \u201clotto\u201d?\n\n\n???:\n Well, speaking in front of this many people is great publicity. Especially for them. Anomaly sales are going to skyrocket after this, if they can pull it off.\n\n\nTheta:\n What other panels has there been in the past?\n\n\n???:\n Wondertainment, Anderson, you name it. Even Nobody, one year. Though, that one was pretty boring. Nobody was there.\n\n\nTheta:\n Hm.\n\n\nTheta turns back towards the SCP-6616-1 entities near the door.\n\n\nTheta:\n And what about these things that are floating around everywhere? What\u2019s up with them?\n\n\nThe man tilts his head.\n\n\n???:\n You\u2019re very curious, aren\u2019t you?\n\n\nTheta:\n Sorry, it\u2019s our first year. We\u2019re just trying to learn as much as possible.\n\n\n???:\n And what group are you with? The more organized ones should have filled you in before coming. They wouldn\u2019t want you to misrepresent them, after all.\n\n\nTheta extends his hand, displaying the INDV.\n\n\nTheta:\n We\u2019re individual. My two friends and I.\n\n\nRho and Kappa both wave.\n\n\nKappa:\n It\u2019s nice to meet you!\n\n\nThe man sighs.\n\n\n???:\n I\u2019d cherish your individuality while it lasts. It won\u2019t be long before someone comes along and scoops you up into their organization, or cult, or insurgency or foundation. Things are so political nowadays. You know, when I was younger, we could do magic all we wanted without having to worry about being shoved in a box and tested on! I mean, imagine trying to get a job in this landscape when the only thing that comes up when someone searches your name online is SCP- blah blah blah! It\u2019s incredibly difficult!\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026right. What group did you say you were here with?\n\n\nThe man laughs.\n\n\n???:\n I didn\u2019t. But, since you asked, I-\n\n\nA voice comes over a loud speaker in the panel room. The man stops talking.\n\n\nLoud Speaker:\n Ladies and gentlemen, dead and undead, anomalous and non-anomalous, type green, type blue and every type under the goddamn sun!\n\n\nThe lights in the room dim as two spotlights are aimed towards the stage. The audience starts to applaud.\n\n\nLoud Speaker:\n We\u2019ve kept you waiting long enough. AnomalyCon 2020 is proud to present\u2026 Marshall, Carter and Dark!\n\n\nThe gray curtain on stage rises. The audience starts to shout and applause. A single man\n2\n in a black suit is standing on stage, a microphone in his hand. Behind the man is a projection of a slide presentation, though no projector can be located. The projection reads \u201cProfiting Off of the Anomalous\u201d, with a clipart stack of dollar bills under it.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n HELLO ANOMALYCON! How are you all doing tonight?!\n\n\nThe applause slowly dies down.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n I, for one, am doing fantastic and looking forward to teaching you how to turn monsters\u2026\n\n\nThe image on the projection becomes a stock photo of SCP-173.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n \u2026into money!\n\n\nA red \u2018X\u2019 appears over 173. A black arrow leads away from the image and towards a clipart dollar sign. The audience is silent.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n Now, I bet I know what you\u2019re all thinking\u2026\n\n\nOne of the three robed individuals sitting next to Zeta-9 turns to the other two.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n Who the fuck is this?! Ophidian\n3\n said one of the Big Three would be here!\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI 2:\n Shhh! We stick the plan! This could still be a massive blow to their operations! And a blow is a blow, no matter how small.\n\n\nKappa mumbles something about talking about your blows in a more private setting. The man on stage continues.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n \u2026wait a minute, he\u2019s not one of the Big Three! And you\u2019re right, I\u2019m not. Unfortunately, they were just too busy to make it this year.\n\n\nA collective sigh sweeps through the audience as many people start getting up and walking towards the exit.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n But wait, there\u2019s more! I can provide all the essential information about starting your own anomalous startup that they could, if not more!\n\n\nThe three robed figures turn towards each other.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n Shit\u2026 they\u2019re leaving! Ophidian said-\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI 2:\n I know what Ophidian said! Alright, if we want the greatest amount of people to see this, we have to go now!\n\n\nKappa:\n Can you be quiet? We\u2019re trying to listen!\n\n\nAll at once, the three robed figures stand and walk into the center of the aisle.\n\n\nRho:\n Theta\u2026\n\n\nTheta:\n Just be ready.\n\n\nThe man laughs.\n\n\n???:\n Oh, this should be good.\n\n\nFrom the center aisle, one robed figure steps forward while the other two fall back behind her. She points to the man on stage.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n YOU! YOU CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE WICKED MERCHANTS, MARSHALL, CARTER AND DARK?!\n\n\nThe room falls silent as all eyes are drawn to the figures and the man on stage.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n Uhhh\u2026 yeah?\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n You slimy, despicable fuck! Selling anomalies like slaves to the highest bidder! You make me sick!\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n Wha- you guys are with the Serpent's Hand, right? I thought we were cool with the Serpent\u2019s Hand?!\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n The Serpent\u2019s \nHand\n maybe. But the Serpent\u2019s Will knows better\u2026 the ones you treat like livestock could erase you from the minds of every person on earth with a single blink, ripping any memory of you from their heads like the filthy parasite you are! You cannot even comprehend the power they posses, and yet when you behold them in all of their glory, all you see are numbers\u2026 the veil can only be dropped and we can all only be free once people like you are purged from this reality! NOW!\n\n\nA figure behind the woman pulls a book out of his robe and starts reading in an unfamiliar language. The woman rolls up the sleeve on her right arm, revealing an intricate snake tattoo winding from her shoulder to her wrist, where the snake\u2019s mouth sits agape in the center of the woman\u2019s palm. As the man reads, the tattoo begins to peel itself off of the woman\u2019s arm, the ink beginning to twist and writhe in the air. Once fully animated, the snake bares its dripping, black fangs and winds back, ready to strike at the man on stage. It shoots forwards, towards the man, who cowers, covering his eyes with his hands.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n STRIKE THAT HERETIC DOWN WHERE HE STANDS!\n\n\nInstantly, an SCP-6616-1 entity appears in front of the animated snake, grabbing it by its neck. The entity squeezes and the snake vanishes into a cloud of dark smoke.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI:\n What-\n\n\nThe entity appears behind the woman, grabbing her by the back of her head. The entity sighs, sounding like white noise through the video feed.\n\n\n6616-1:\n I wish you would\u2019ve kept your weird, magic snake tattoo for \nafter\n the convention, ma\u2019am.\n\n\nThe entity slams the woman\u2019s head into the ground, causing ripples to spread out from the site of the impact. The woman begins to sink into the floor, as if it was mud. She opens her mouth to scream, but floor just fills any space it has access to, cutting off her scream with a chocked sob. Then, the woman is gone, only a bright smear of red remaining where her face hit the floor. Two other SCP-6616-1 entities appear behind the two other robed figures. One entity grabs the man with the book by the hood of his robe, and flings him up towards the ceiling. Like an origami fortune teller, a pitch black square unfolds onto the ceiling above him. No light passes through the square and nothing can be seen beyond it. The man flies into the contained void, as it folds itself in half continually until it too is gone. The entity picks up the book and it ignites in its hand, the ashes slipping through its fingertips. The man sitting next to Zeta-9 chuckles.\n\n\n???:\n That never gets old\u2026\n\n\nThe last entity grabs the remaining robed figure by his wrist and starts dragging him towards the stage.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI 3:\n W-wait, it was her idea! I swear, I didn\u2019t want to do it, I didn\u2019t! It was all her!\n\n\nThe entity makes its way onto the stage and turns to the MC&D Representative, still covering his eyes.\n\n\n6616-1:\n On behalf of the entire STAFF, I apologize for the disturbance. You may continue with your presentation shortly.\n\n\nThe entity drags the robed figure off stage, behind the drawn curtain. Muffled crying can be heard.\n\n\nSerpent\u2019s Hand POI 3:\n I swear, it wasn\u2019t me! I can tell you where they are! I can give you names, locations, anything, please! I SWEAR IT WASN\u2019T-\n\n\nThe crying stops. The entity emerges from the behind he stage, hands dripping. It nods to the MC&D Representative and floats away.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n \u2026h-holy shit\u2026\n\n\nThe MC&D Representative clears his throat.\n\n\nMC&D Rep:\n W-well folks, sorry about that little interruption! We should b-b-be good to go!\n\n\nTheta stand and turns towards Rho and Kappa.\n\n\nTheta:\n We need to leave. \nNow.\n\n\nTheta walks into the aisle and towards the door. Rho and Kappa follow. The man calls out after them.\n\n\n???:\n Hey, where are you guys going? What, never seen someone get killed before?\n\n\nAs the team exits the panel room, an SCP-6616-1 entity turns towards them.\n\n\n6616-1:\n I\u2019m really sorry about that, sirs and ma\u2019am! I hope that didn\u2019t ruin your convention experience this year!\n\n\nThe team runs past the entity and out the door. Once in the main convention center, Theta spots a familiar SCP-6616-1 entity in the distance, who waves them down.\n\n\nTheta:\n Derek!\n\n\nTheta turns and gestures for his team to follow.\n\n\nTheta:\n Come on!\n\n\nThe team runs towards the entity.\n\n\nRho:\n Holy shit! Holy fuckin\u2019 shit! What the hell was that-\n\n\n6616-1:\n Who was it?\n\n\nRho:\n \u2026what?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Who was it, who started the fight?!\n\n\nTheta:\n It was the Serpent\u2019s Hand. Called themselves the, uh\u2026 the Serpent\u2019s Will. They called themselves the Serpent\u2019s Will.\n\n\n6616-1:\n HAHA, YES!\n\n\nRho:\n What?\n\n\n6616-1:\n And who did they start the fight with?\n\n\nTheta:\n This guy representing Marshall, Carter and Dark during the panel.\n\n\n6616-1:\n TWO FOR TWO, FUCK YEAH! That\u2019s 50 bucks, baby!\n\n\nRho:\n Excuse me, what the fuck are you talking about?!\n\n\n6616-1:\n There\u2019s been talk of a Serpent\u2019s Hand splinter cell that started to form a few months back. Super radical. Anyone who isn\u2019t with them is against them.\n\n\nTheta:\n So why\u2019d they go after MC&D of all people?\n\n\n6616-1:\n Apparently, they hate them the most. Something about anomalies not being property, and \u201cyou can\u2019t sell people!\u201d blah, blah, blah. They\u2019re \nsuper\n touchy about people like me, too. As if we need them fighting for our rights.\n\n\nRho:\n And you\u2026 BET ON THEM!\n\n\n6616-1:\n Yeah. We all do.\n\n\nRho:\n How many fights are there?! I thought you were supposed to be security!\n\n\n6616-1:\n Did anyone besides the Serpent\u2019s Will douchebags get hurt?\n\n\nRho:\n I\u2026 well, I guess not\u2026\n\n\n6616-1:\n Exactly. People come here every year thinking it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to get revenge on someone, or turn the tides of whatever imaginary war they\u2019re fighting. They hear the rumors, but they think that\u2019s just what they are: rumors. They don\u2019t take the STAFF seriously. But make no mistake. We take our jobs\u2026 \nvery seriously\n.\n\n\nRho:\n \u2026right. Understood.\n\n\nThe entity nods.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Good. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I want to go see the damage! Did June do the thing with the floor? Oh, I bet she did! That always scares the shit out of them! I saw one guy \nliterally\n shit his pants as he sank into the floor! We had to get a new carpet, cause the shit merged with it as he sank\u2026\n\n\nThe entity starts to float away towards the panel room. As it does, the doors open and people start flooding out.\n\n\n6616-1:\n Get out of the way! Move it, just- fuck it.\n\n\nThe entity vanishes. Theta turns toward his team.\n\n\nTheta:\n Come on. I think we have enough for an initial report.\n\n\nRho:\n Initial?! Man, I just saw someone drown in the floor like it was fucking silly putty!\n\n\nKappa:\n Yeah, we all saw! Besides the whole killing thing, it wasn\u2019t really that bad.\n\n\nRho:\n Christ Almighty, I do \nnot\n want to see whatever you consider bad!\n\n\nTheta starts walking towards the entrance to the anomaly. His team follows. As the team approaches, a booth can be seen standing next to the entrance.\n\n\nRho:\n Hey Theta?\n\n\nTheta:\n Yeah, what is it?\n\n\nRho:\n Why does that booth have the Foundation\u2019s logo on it?\n\n\nIn front of the team stands an all black booth with the Foundation\u2019s insignia drawn on the front.\n\n\nTheta:\n I\u2026 uh\u2026\n\n\nKappa approaches the booth, picking up a pin of the Foundation\u2019s insignia that lays on the counter.\n\n\nKappa:\n \u2026what the hell? They have pins? Wait a minute\u2026 five dollars?! For a shitty pin?!\n\n\nA man wearing a dark grey, wool sweater walks out from the back of the booth.\n\n\n???:\n That\u2019s right, five dollars. Or gears, or paints, or 7th dimension ingots or whatever currency you use. Five of them\u2026 hey, it\u2019s you guys! Where did you run off to in such a hurry?\n\n\nTheta:\n Wha- but we just saw you in the panel room. How did you get out here so fast?\n\n\n???:\n Oh, I always like to get my stand up and running as people start to leave for the day. They make great customers on the way out!\n\n\nTheta:\n I asked \nhow\n you got out here so fast. Not why.\n\n\n???:\n \u2026anyways, see anything you like?\n\n\nKappa:\n I would say the pins, but five dollars is highway robbery! How much does it cost to make these?\n\n\n???:\n Pretty much nothing. I got a deal going with The Factory, so I get hundreds of these things.\n\n\nKappa:\n \u2026cheap.\n\n\n???:\n It\u2019s called business. I guess you would know what I\u2019m talking about if MC&D didn\u2019t drop the ball so hard, am I right?\n\n\nThe team is silent.\n\n\n???:\n Heh. Well, I have other things if you don\u2019t want the pins. How about a picture? Or an autograph? I\u2019m actually pretty high up in Foundation ranks, so my autograph is pretty valuable!\n\n\nKappa:\n Yeah, cause you can always trust someone who says their own autograph is valuable.\n\n\nThe man shrugs.\n\n\n???:\n Whatever.\n\n\nTheta:\n \u2026high up in Foundation ranks\u2026\n\n\nTheta gets closer to the booth.\n\n\nTheta:\n Wait\u2026 dash twelve? Is that you?\n\n\n05-12:\n \u2026who\u2019s asking?\n\n\nTheta:\n MTF Zeta-9.\n\n\n05-12:\n Uhhh-\n\n\nRho:\n And why does your booth say \u201cHappy 5th anniversary\u201d?\n\n\n05-12:\n \u2026oh shit.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproduced below is a note that was taped to the door of Zeta-9\u2019s room, upon their return to Site-78.\n\n\n\n\nMole Rats.\n\n\n \n\nUnder circumstances any more dire than the predicament we currently find ourselves in, you would all have your memories of the past few days erased. Your team would be disbanded and you would all be sent to the farthest corners of this Foundation. Lucky for you, your team still manages to have some shred of usefulness. Right now, you three serve as the \u201cleading experts\u201d on SCP-6616. Had it not been for The Outsider\u2019s\n4\n foolish sense of rebellion, he could have taken your place, and much more competently, I suppose. But that\u2019s besides the point. How he managed to attend this convention for years without our knowledge is something we\u2019re still trying to figure out. He has proven to be quite adept at keeping his mouth shut. If we knew that all it took to shut him up was sending him somewhere he could flaunt his fake power for a week, we would have done it years ago. Your team is now tasked with investigating the anomaly each year, during its period of activation. You will gather notes, rumors, pictures, videos, products and anything else you can. DO NOT MAKE YOUR INTENTIONS KNOWN. And do not worry about The Supervisor. We will deal with her when the time comes. You are not to reveal that you saw The Outsider in attendance. We will know if you did. You should receive an email from The Outsider any minute now with his own apology. Read it, then delete it. Any more questions, you can aim at your site director. Goodbye. For now.\n\n\n \n\n- 05-2, The Final Stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nRe:\u00a0Subject\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Zeta-9 / Dr. Mayhew\n\n\nFrom:\n 05-12, The Outsider\n\n\nSubject:\n AnomalyCon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeta-9, Dr. Mayhew,\n\n\nThe reason I\u2019m contacting \nyou\n all is concerning SCP-6616. It has come to my attention that the \nF\no\nu\nndation was unaware of the existen\nc\ne of such an anomaly. If I had realized this sooner, I can guarantee you all that my actions would not have been \nk\nept from the others. You see, \nI\n was u\nn\nder the impression that the Foundation would have known about an anomaly of this ma\ng\nnitude with \ns\nuch a large pote\nn\nt\ni\nal for a veil break. Res\nt\n assured, I will not be attending the remaining two days of the \nc\nonvention, or any ot\nh\ne\nr day\ns\n in the future. Please except my apologies. If you need any help documenting this anomaly, I would happy to provide any information I can.\n\n\nBest wishes\u2026\n\n05-12, The Outsider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter Action Report\n\n\nOn October 24th at 6:00\u00a0pm, SCP-6616 vanished from Washington, D.C. All attempts to locate the convention center or any SCP-6616-1 entities have failed. Approximately one hour after its disappearance, a card addressed to 05-12 was left at Site-78. The contents of the card have been reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\nAnomalyCon 2020!\n\n\n\n\nWe hope everyone had an amazing AnomalyCon this year! You all know The STAFF and I strive for a better experience every year, and this year was no different! Despite the very minor interruption, our friends over at Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd had an amazing and thought-provoking panel, and with amazing products from both The Factory and Dr. Wondertainment, I think it\u2019s safe to say that this year is one to remember! And we'd all like to wish a very happy 5th anniversary to the SCP Foundation! AnomalyCon wouldn\u2019t be the same without you! We can\u2019t wait to see what you bring to the panel floor next year! And on that note, we hope everyone has an amazing rest of their year, and we look forward to seeing you all next year in \nEagle Point, Oregon\n Portland, Maine!\n\n\n- The Supervisor\n\n\n\n\n(P.S. - Next year, make sure you know how to get in \nbefore\n you arrive.
