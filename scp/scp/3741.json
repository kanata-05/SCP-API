The number of SCP-3741 instances in containment should not exceed fifty at any time. As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated.\n\n\nShould any wild instances be discovered, MTF Sigma-13 (\"Food Fighters\") will be deployed to recover them and return to Site-77. As such, MTF Sigma-13 agents embedded in various national food safety regulatory bodies\n1\n will routinely visit oyster farms under their jurisdiction that are known to raise eastern oysters (\nCrassostrea virginica\n) and are to confiscate any instances of SCP-3741 that they find.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested. Should an instance be consumed, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and amnesticized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters. Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality\n2\n, dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells. Despite demonstrating the inability to age, SCP-3741 instances are capable of sexual reproduction, and are hermaphroditic like non-anomalous eastern oysters, but can only reproduce with other instances of SCP-3741.\n\n\nIn addition to biological deviations from non-anomalous eastern oysters, instances of SCP-3741 are known to induce a memetic effect when consumed by a subject, hereafter designated as SCP-3741-A. Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for more information.\n\n\nAddendum 3741-A:\n Discovery\n\nSCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at The Spat Shuckster's Oyster Farm in Kennebunkport, Maine. In response, the agents visited the farm and confiscated the oysters, logging them as an Anomalous Object under the designation AO-697837. During routine testing, the secondary anomalous properties were discovered, thus warranting an upgrade to SCP-3741.\n\n\nAddendum 3741-B:\n Test Log\n\nThe following is an abridged list of tests involving SCP-3741.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3741-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nD-2452, one instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nD-2452 instructed to open and consume the instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nD-2452 opened and consumed the instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741, despite initial resistance due to the pink color of the flesh. D-2452 reported no abnormal taste, smell, or texture. Following the test, D-2452 reported an interest in music and requested an instrument.

Immediately following the conclusion of this test, D-2452 attempted to flee from Foundation custody by assaulting the security officer who was escorting them back to their cell. D-2452 was soon apprehended and terminated by on-site security and AO-697837 was subsequently upgraded to SCP-3741. Further testing has been suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[PLEASE\u00a0INPUT\u00a0LEVEL\u00a04/3741\u00a0CREDENTIALS]\n\n\n\n\n[ACCESSING\u00a0CONTENT.\u00a0PLEASE\u00a0STAND\u00a0BY.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nThe following file is Level 4/3741 classified.

Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality, dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells. Despite demonstrating the inability to age, SCP-3741 instances are capable of sexual reproduction, and are hermaphroditic like non-anomalous eastern oysters, but can only reproduce with other instances of SCP-3741.\n\n\nIn addition to biological deviations from non-anomalous eastern oysters, instances of SCP-3741 are known to induce a memetic effect \nwhen consumed by a subject, hereafter designated as SCP-3741-A. Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for details.\n \nupon two subjects when one of them ingests an instance. The person who ingested the SCP-3741 instance shall hereafter be referred to as SCP-3741-A, and the subsequent linked individual shall be referred to as SCP-3741-B.\n\n\nThrough a poorly understood mechanism, a metaphysical link between the consciousness of SCP-3741-A and SCP-3741-B is established upon consumption of an SCP-3741 instance. This cognitive link allows for the transfer of memories and experiences from SCP-3741-B to SCP-3741-A. The information that is transferred and the given instance of SCP-3741-B directly relate to the thoughts, desires and curiosities of SCP-3741-A at the time of ingestion, and as such, SCP-3741-A can exert a degree of control over the effects of the anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum 3741-A:\n Discovery \nand Uncontained Effects\n\nSCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at The Spat Shuckster's Oyster Farm in Kennebunkport, Maine. In response, the agents visited the farm and confiscated the oysters, logging them as an Anomalous Object under the designation AO-697837. During routine testing, the secondary anomalous properties were discovered, thus warranting an upgrade to SCP-3741 \nas a Thaumiel-class object\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nUpon discovery of the secondary anomalous properties of SCP-3741, multiple cases of SCP-3741-B instances were identified. The following is an abridged list detailing confirmed cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 3741-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3741-A\n\n\nD-2452\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3741-B\n\n\nMalcolm Young\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nMr. Young stepped down from his role as rhythm guitarist of Australian rock band \"AC/DC\" in 2014, citing dementia. It was later revealed that Young had forgotten how to play the guitar. The sudden onset of the disease coincides with Test 3741-1\n3\n. As such, it is currently believed that D-2452 is responsible for Mr. Young's dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 3741-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3741-A\n\n\nD-2452\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3741-B\n\n\nMichael McBrody, Site-77 Security Personnel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nUpon the conclusion of Test 3741-2\n4\n, Officer McBrody was instructed to return D-2452 to their cell. While in transport to the Site-77 D-class containment block, D-2452 assaulted Officer McBrody with their restraints. This resulted in severe trauma to Officer McBrody's trachea, which was crushed in the altercation. Officer McBrody remained in the Site-77 intensive care unit for 6 weeks\n\nbefore being discharged in good health. It is believed that D-2452 had acquired Officer McBrody's hand-to-hand combat training in Test 3741-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3741-B:\n Test Log\n\nThe following is an abridged list of tests involving SCP-3741. \nPlease note that Tests 3741-1 and 3741-2 remain relatively unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3741-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nD-2452, one instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nD-2452 instructed to open and consume the instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nD-2452 opened and consumed the instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741, despite initial resistance due to the pink color of the flesh. D-2452 reported no abnormal taste, smell, or texture. Following the test, D-2452 reported an interest in music and requested an instrument. The request was denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3741-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nD-2452, one instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nD-2452 instructed to steam and ingest one instance of \nAO-697837\n SCP-3741.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nD-2452 did as instructed and reported no abnormal taste, smell, or texture. Immediately following the conclusion of this test, D-2452 attempted to flee from Foundation custody by assaulting the security officer who was escorting them back to their cell. D-2452 was soon apprehended and terminated by on-site security and AO-697837 was subsequently upgraded to SCP-3741.
