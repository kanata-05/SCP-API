People want to eat them because they're absolutely scrumptious. Disregard all unsubstantiated rumors regarding Snacko\u2122 Products below. The Foundation does not know what deliciousness is.\n\nSnacko\u2122 Fudgey Chocolate Globbernauts are decadent and rich.\n\nSnacko\u2122 Cherry-Flavored Candy Fizzlebombs are bursting with flavor.\n\nSnacko\u2122 Crunchy Sea-Salt Caramel Wunderbars are sophisticated yet simply amazing.\n\nSnacko\u2122 Zesty Haba\u00f1ero Potato Crisps are an excellent companion to any game day.\n\nAvailable now in your local grocery stores.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5081 is a brand of snack foods - primarily candies - distributed within the continental United States. Information on the packaging indicates SCP-5081 is produced by \"Snacko\u2122 Foods LLC\"[sic] and distributed from Pneuma, Illinois, \nthough no records of this LLC, trademark, or municipality exist. The web domain name listed on all SCP-5081 packaging is unregistered, and the toll-free telephone number is operated by a laundromat in Saskatchewan.\n Snacko\u2122 is proud to be owned and operated entirely in the town of Pneuma, Illinois, where our founder Gerald Snacko\u2122 first opened his little confectionary on Dunwich Avenue. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to carry out his vision of making the world a little sweeter, one edible at a time!\n\n\nThe design of SCP-5081's packaging contains cognitohazards that serve to attract a viewer's attention when viewed through peripheral vision.\n Four varieties of SCP-5081 have been documented as of 2019/12/16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nBRANDING\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5081-A\n\n\nFudgey Chocolate Globbernauts\n\n\nBalls of chocolate fudge with almonds\n\n\nThaumaturgical icons found imprinted onto the surface of some samples. Function of these symbols currently unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5081-B\n\n\nCherry-Flavored Candy Fizzlebombs\n\n\nSoft cherry-flavored candy with a liquid interior\n\n\n1.6% of samples tested contained traces of gunpowder. Contaminated instances described as tasting \"slightly burnt\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5081-C\n\n\nCrunchy Sea-Salt Caramel Wunderbars\n\n\nCaramel and crushed pretzel bar with a chocolate shell\n\n\nInstances retain a constant temperature of 20.1\u00b0C, even when exposed to extreme heat and cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5081-D\n\n\nZesty Haba\u00f1ero Potato Crisps\n\n\nHaba\u00f1ero-flavored potato chips\n\n\nFalsely marketed as containing \"no artificial flavors\". The haba\u00f1ero flavoring is produced by\n [TRADE SECRETS EXPUNGED BY COURT ORDER]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who ingest greater than 50 grams of SCP-5081 become an instance of SCP-5081-1. SCP-5081-1 instances attempt to pursue a diet consisting entirely of SCP-5081, resorting to other forms of nourishment only when necessary, and becoming highly distressed if denied access to SCP-5081 for extended periods. While instances do not appear to suffer from the expected debilitating effects of this diet, it appears to significantly affect subjects' body chemistry; one instance's skeletal structure was composed entirely of crystallized sugar when discovered, and another instance's skin was a structure resembling potato chips. Questioning SCP-5081-1 regarding this behavior rarely provokes a coherent response.\n Some Snacko\u2122 customers love our products so much that they have chosen to make them a part of their daily lives.
