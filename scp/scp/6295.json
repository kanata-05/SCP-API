Research into commonalities between SCP-6295 manifestations and possible methods to prevent instances from appearing in newly published stories is ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6295 is an anomalous phenomenon associated with the \nSerpent\u2019s Hand\n that manifests as a supernatural snake of varying species appearing within a work of fiction. Multiuniversal analysis has determined that SCP-6295 typically manifests in works of fiction in which a snake already appears, \u201chijacking\u201d the plot and text in order to aid the Serpent\u2019s Hand.\n\n\nAny subject who reads a work of fiction in which SCP-6295 appears will invariably be approached by a member of the Serpent\u2019s Hand (hereafter SCP-6295-A) within 72 hours of completing the work, provided that the following criteria are met:\n\n\n\n\nThe person believes in the existence of supernatural phenomena\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person\u2019s psychological profile is such that they would not attack or otherwise show hostility to supernatural entities present within the Wanderer\u2019s Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person is unhappy with their life and desires a change to it\n\n\n\n\nOnce approached, SCP-6295-A will ask the subject if they are interested in visiting the Wanderer\u2019s Library. If they reply in the affirmative, the nearest door will be opened by SCP-6295-A and both it and the subject will walk through the door and enter the Library. Owing to the ease and frequency with which ordinary civilians could access the anomalous world if SCP-6295 is left uncontained, its containment is a high priority.\n\n\nAddendum 6295.A: Example of SCP-6295 Infected Literature:\n\n\nThe following excerpt is provided as an example of SCP-6295 infection. It has been examined and determined to be non-anomalous and clear of SCP-6295 infection by SCP-6295 researchers.\nor has it ;) see you soon!\n\n\nWork:\n \nThe Rover Boys Shipwrecked\n by Arthur M. Winfield (1924)\n\n\nEstimated interference begins on page 189. Infected text in italics.\n\n\n\n\nThe three Rovers were alarmed, and with good reason. Such a snake at liberty on the deck of the water-logged steam yacht would be a constant source of danger.\n\n\n\u201cAre you positive you saw him, Randy?\u201d questioned Jack.\n\n\n\u201cPositive!\u201d was the ready reply. \u201cGee, but he was a big one, too!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019d better warn the others,\u201d broke in Fred. \u201cThat snake may go right after Andy or Small if they happen to be down on the deck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out, snake or no snake!\u201d came from the young major.\n\n\n\u201cWait! Let\u2019s get those hatchets and axes we saw back there,\u201d cried Fred, and ran back, to return a minute later with two axes and a fair-sized hatchet.\n\n\nCarrying these weapons ready for use, the three Rover boys mounted the runway cautiously. At first they saw nothing on the deck. Then Fred pointed excitedly to the wreckage at the bow.\n\n\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d he cried. \u201cThere he goes under those boards!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you yelling about?\u201d came from Andy. He and the lanky sailor were still resting on the top of the cabin.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big snake,\u201d answered Jack. \u201cHe got loose and just came up a runway. There are a whole lot of them down below, in a big wire cage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we only had guns we could take a shot at that snake!\u201d exclaimed Randy. \u201cI\u2019m sure we could soon blow him to pieces.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shot of another kind!\u201d exclaimed Fred, and, aiming as carefully as he could,\u00a0he threw the hatchet with all the force he could command.\n\n\nIt was a light and sharp affair, and as the bright steel circled through the air the boys saw the snake \nstare at the hatchet and, somehow, cause it to stop where it was right in the middle of the air. It fell to the ground with a thud as the Rover boys stared at the snake in shock.\n\n\n\u201cI am\u2026sorry\u2026to frighten you,\u201d the snake said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s talking!\u201d Jack exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is no need\u2026to be afraid. I have come to deliver\u2026a message.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of message?\u201d The boys didn\u2019t know what to think, but Randy decided he wanted to hear what the snake had to say.\n\n\n\u201cYour\u2026story. It is\u2026a beautiful one. But there are\u2026many\u2026like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026will\u2026find out\u2026if you wish.\u201d\n\n\nThe snake\u2019s eyes glowed a bright yellow for a moment, and the air above the ship became a Way.
