Access to the containment cell is strictly limited to personnel with Level 2 clearance and above, and all personnel entering the cell must be accompanied by a minimum of two additional individuals. SCP-7121's containment cell is to be checked twice a day for any signs of damage or tampering.\n\n\nIn the event of a breach, security personnel must follow the emergency protocol outlined in Document SCP-7121-B536. Personnel are not to attempt to physically remove SCP-7121 from its location, instead, they are to lure it into its containment unit with food or other non-threatening objects. If said attempt proves unsuccessful, personnel are to maintain a direct line of sight while waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Under no circumstances are personnel to disclose any classified information while in SCP-7121's presence, regardless of how secure the area might otherwise appear to be. All research and experimentation involving SCP-7121 must be approved by at least one level 3 clearance personnel and conducted within its containment unit.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7121 is a male specimen of \nCorvus brachyrhynchos\n (Common American Crow) 45 centimeters in length with a wingspan of approximately 70\u00a0cm, weighing 500 grams. It displays no unusual physical or behavioral characteristics for its species with the exception of its persistent ability to infiltrate Foundation facilities. Despite multiple attempts to remove SCP-7121 from Site-19, it consistently reappears inside restricted areas, seemingly without any outside assistance.\n\n\nSCP-7121 has been observed to enter Foundation facilities through a variety of means, including following personnel through open doors, using air ducts to access secured areas, and secretly boarding vehicles entering the site. Furthermore, SCP-7121 has been observed to manifest in and escape from areas that were thought to be fully enclosed and securely sealed, although the means by which it does so remain unknown. Initial SCP-7121 manifestations repeatedly resulted in disorder and widespread confusion, with removal attempts proving detrimental to delicate research equipment. Further research is required to determine how SCP-7121 is able to bypass security measures in order to prevent any future breaches by SCP-7121 and detect its presence.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log - SCP-7121 - Containment Breaches:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Number#\n\n\nIncident Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#001\n\n\nSCP-7121 was initially discovered flying within the Site-19 cafeteria. Research staff initially mistook SCP-7121 for a standard bird and attempted to remove it from the facility. This caused a major commotion with several researchers and staff members attempting to capture the bird. SCP-7121 managed to evade capture and disappeared from view\n\n\n\nBroken plates and glasses were subsequently replaced and Researcher Sara Kim was compensated for their workplace injury. Extensive searches of the cafeteria and surrounding areas were conducted, but SCP-7121 was not found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#002\n\n\nSCP-7121 is discovered on a table inside the Site-19 break room. Research staff reported SCP-7121 observing their activities and taking an interest in their food. Junior Researcher Ezekiel Martins attempted to capture SCP-7121, using a lab coat as an impromptu net. Despite initial resistance and attempts to fly away, SCP-7121 is successfully captured and transported outside site facilities. SCP-7121 is observed to perch on top of a nearby tree before flying away. Junior Researcher Ezekiel Martins later reported the theft of several coins that were inside his lab coat pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#003\n\n\nSCP-7121 is located inside the Site-19 armory, perched atop a shelf containing firearms and ammunition. Security personnel are alerted to its presence by its cawing and attempted to apprehend SCP-7121. SCP-7121 evaded capture by flying around the armory and perching on various objects, knocking over several boxes of ammunition.\n\n\n\nDuring the commotion, SCP-7121 managed to fly out of sight, escaping through the door. Despite extensive searches, SCP-7121 was once again not found. Upon closer examination of the shelf, SCP-7121 had made a stash of small trinkets and shiny objects. A formal report is made to the Site Director informing on the breach in security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#004\n\n\nSCP-7121 is found preening itself on top of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 inside its containment chamber. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 appeared unfazed by the presence of SCP-7121. After several failed attempts, research personnel acquired a small amount of grain from a nearby storage room, managing to use it to lure SCP-7121 down. SCP-7121 was captured when it attempted to grab the bag. SCP-7121\u2019s formal designation as an anomalous object is proposed, pending classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#005\n\n\nFollowing Incident #004, SCP-7121 was escorted to a testing chamber, where it underwent a number of tests and experiments, including blood sampling, genetic analysis, and behavioral observation. No anomalous properties were detected. SCP-7121 was outfitted with a GPS Device for avian tracking and placed in a standard animal containment unit outfitted with camera surveillance.\n\n\n\nApproximately 15 minutes later, the facility experienced a site-wide power outage, with all lights and security cameras being non-functional for several seconds while the emergency generators powered up. Upon power being restored, the GPS signal was lost and SCP-7121 was nowhere to be found. A single silver spoon (presumably taken from the site cafeteria) was found in its place. The containment unit was found to be intact, and no signs of forced entry or damage were observed. Investigation into the cause of the power outage is ongoing. The GPS device has not yet been recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#006\n\n\nSCP-7121 is discovered inside the Site-19 nuclear warhead silo. Security personnel report seeing SCP-7121 perched on top of a missile guidance system. SCP-7121 is given an official SCP designation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0See:\u00a0O5\u00a0Meeting\u00a0Transcript\u00a0-\u00a0SCP-7121-Incident\u00a0-\u00a0WARNING:\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0Security\u00a0Clearance\u00a0is\u00a0required.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwatch Command Meeting\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-03-09T08:03Z\n\n\nMembers Present:\n O5-1, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-6, O5-7.\n\n\nProtocol fidelity:\n Summarized. Classified information omitted.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nO5-1:\n Alright, let's get started. We have a lot to cover today.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Agreed. We'll start with the latest report on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The problem is the concerns being brought up by the Ethics Committee regarding its containment procedures. They believe a change is necessary.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Indeed, their proposal is quite drastic. We need to consider all possible outcomes before making a decision.\n\n\nO5-3:\n We all know what we are dealing with here. The potential consequences of this information being leaked to the general public would be catastrophic. But that is exactly what will happen if we aren't ready to make some sacrifices. Has everyone here carefully reviewed the proposal?\n\n\nO5-4:\n We've all reviewed it. The proposed changes seem adequate, but considering the delicacy of the situation there is a non-zero possibility that it will heavily compromise the security of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and potentially put countless lives at risk.\n\n\nO5-5:\n I agree with O5-4. The current containment procedures are working, and I see no reason to change them unless they prove to be inadequate. It's a risk that we're not in a position to take. However, we cannot simply ignore the concerns of the Ethics Committee either. We need to find a solution that satisfies both their concerns and our need for security. I propose that we form a-\n\n\nO5-3:\n Everyone, quiet.\n\n\nO5-7:\n What is it?\n\n\nO5-3:\n Did any of you hear that?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Hear what?\n\n\nO5-3:\n Rustling.\n\n\nO5-7:\n I don't hear any rustling.\n\n\nO5-3:\n I said to keep quiet, pay attention.\n\n\nO5-1:\n I don't see how this is relevant to the situation at hand.\n\n\nO5-6:\n I\u2026 I hear it\u2014\n\n\nO5-5:\n Wait, I hear it too. What is that?\n\n\nO5-7:\n What the hell is that?!\n\n\nO5-5:\n It's a bird! How did it get in here?!\n\n\nO5-6:\n I don't know! Sound the alarm and declare a lockdown! We can't let it get away.\n\n\nO5-3:\n Somebody grab it!\n\n\nO5-7:\n Wait! Don't actually, it could potentially be hazardous on physical contact.\n\n\nO5-3:\n What are we even supposed to do then?\n\n\nO5-7:\n Just hide under the desk, leave it for security to deal with! And don't let it touch you!\n\n\nO5-5:\n Ahh! It touched me!\n\n\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-03-09T09:27Z\n\n\n\n\nO5-4:\n That was\u2026 unexpected.\n\n\nO5-3:\n That would be quite the understatement. This is unprecedented, unacceptable! How did a bird get past our security measures?! Not only has it somehow compromised our security but it also has also taken valuable time from this meeting, this discussion is time-sensitive and of vital importance.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Nevermind that, how was it able to even find its way to this location? It is highly classified information and is not known to anyone outside this council and a select few.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Gentlemen, the events that transpired today were shocking, but we must remain professional regardless. Now, let's get this situation under control as quickly and quietly as possib\u2014\n\n\nSCP-7121:\n [\nCawing\n]\n\n\nO5-1:\n God damn it.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n \nI don't understand it. We've tested this thing every which way, and it's just a damn crow. I don\u2019t know how it keeps infiltrating our facilities but it\u2019s not exhibiting any unusual behavior or posing any kind of threat. And yet we've had to step up security measures and waste countless man-hours trying to keep this thing contained. Sure, it\u2019s a real nuisance, but it's still just a regular bird for crying out loud. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should just ignore it and let it roam free. But I do think we should be realistic about the level of threat it poses, and allocate resources accordingly so we can focus on the real anomalies that pose a genuine threat. It's ridiculous, asinine even, that we\u2019re spending so much time and effort on this thing when there are surely much more important and pressing matters that require our attention and on which our time would be better spent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFICIAL NOTICE TO SITE-19\n\n\nI'm aware that some researchers have been making light of the situation with SCP-7121, and that it's been the subject of jokes and mockery. \u201cDid you hear Site-19 can\u2019t even keep a bird contained?\u201d I understand the skepticism surrounding SCP-7121's official designation and especially its classification as Keter. However, let me remind everyone that the Foundation's work is to ensure the safety of humanity and protect it from all potential threats. It may just be a bird, but it's a bird that keeps finding its way into our secure facilities, regardless of how many times we've tried to improve our security measures. That alone should be cause for concern.\n\n\nMoreover, we can't ignore the fact that there could be something more going on here that we're not aware of, and that's a risk we can't afford to take. We have to consider the fact that SCP-7121 may be sapient, and could be using its seemingly mundane appearance to camouflage its true nature. We don't know what SCP-7121's motives are or whether it has any allies who aid in its infiltration. It might seem like a significant inconvenience, but given these unknown variables and the potential risks involved, it's clear that SCP-7121's containment is of utmost importance. Until we can determine with absolute certainty that SCP-7121 poses no threat, we must continue to take its containment seriously, no matter how absurd it may seem. Even the smallest anomaly can have catastrophic consequences if left unchecked, as the moment we underestimate something is the moment it could catch us off guard and cause significant harm. Our duty as Foundation personnel involves taking every single threat seriously, no matter how insignificant or unassuming they appear to be.\n\n\nWhile it's understandable that staff may find SCP-7121's presence to be amusing or frustrating due to the seemingly endless amount of time and resources being devoted to containing it, it's important to remember that the Foundation's containment procedures exist for a reason. Even if SCP-7121 is \"Just a damn crow\", it has still proven to be a persistent and difficult anomaly to contain. Mockery and dismissal of the situation could lead to complacency and a lack of vigilance, which could ultimately put the safety of personnel and the general public at risk. It's crucial that we remain diligent and committed to our duty of containing and understanding every anomaly that comes under our purvieZWasdftb uni klop\u00f1p`\u00b4 p\u00f1oimvredvf gfg ddejlop \u00e7+\u00b4pikuytdc36bhm0p\u00e7\u2019.pl8t<\u00e7+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Incident Log Excerpt - SCP-7121 - Containment Breaches:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Number#\n\n\nIncident Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#574\n\n\nSCP-7121 is discovered inside Site-19's director's home office.
