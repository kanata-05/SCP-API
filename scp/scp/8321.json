Its mass was measured at roughly 250 kilograms, and it stands 2 meters tall. The object has six bionic limbs and a disproportionately large thorax, in which an explosive device (potential yield unknown) is embedded. \nRemoval of the explosive has been deemed impossible without detonating the object.\n\n\nThe anomaly is capable of understanding and reciprocating human language. \nHowever, researchers are unsure if it is sentient or if it relays answers in accordance with its programming.\n Additionally, SCP-8321 can digest virtually any solid or liquid matter, but has shown a preference for rusted metal and computer equipment.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\nUNOFFICIAL MEMO | SITE-909A,SITE-909B: Regarding SCP-8321\n\n\nMr. Landry,\n\n\nI need the anomaly designated as SCP-8321 transferred to Site-909A immediately.

It's not my call.\n\n\nPeterson:\n It's taking advantage of us while essentially holding us at gunpoint. At this rate, it'll keep making demands until it's consumed everything in this facility.\n\n\nLewandowski:\n On the contrary, the anomaly's requests are quite reasonable; you're being hysterical. It's also helping us clean out those decaying storage units. And it's far from dangerous, let's be honest here; it just has a considerable appetite.\n\n\nPeterson:\n Far from dangerous?\n\n\nLewandowski:\n Theoretically, if we stopped fulfilling its requests, and it followed through with its threat, the damages would total roughly $253,000. In other words, a negligible amount.\n\n\nPeterson:\n I wouldn't be so sure about that. We barely understand how the subject's most rudimentary systems function. Do you have any clue how powerful that bomb is?\n\n\nLewandowski:\n I'll take your statement as a confession of ignorance. Evidently, you don't understand how it functions, but my team is on the verge of solving that puzzle. Seeing is believing. But don't worry, it won't come down to that.\n\n\nPeterson:\n What if you're wrong? And if you're wrong, what about the lives of our staff? Would their deaths be \u201cnegligible?\u201d\n\n\nLewandowski:\n If you want absolute certainty, you're in the wrong place.\n\n\nLewandowski:\n I'll repeat what I've always said: all of our staff are valuable assets.\n\n\nPeterson:\n Then why put them at such risk?\n\n\nLewandowski:\n So long as we uphold our end of the bargain, there is no serious threat. Of course, everything entails risk. But out of the [REDACTED] anomalies contained in this site, SCP-8321 is one of the least dangerous objects.\n\n\nPeterson:\n Have you lost your damn mind? You're staking the lives of countless people on an anomaly that we barely understand. We don't know its motivations, its thought process, or even the technology behind it. What if it starts demanding the impossible? What if, like [REDACTED], it just decides to change its mind and start killing people?\n\n\nLandry:\n That's enough. Not another word.\n\n\nLandry:\n I expected specific, targeted proposals out of you, not an emotional diatribe nor speculations. This meeting is over.\n\n\nPeterson:\n My apologies, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8321-2:\n\n\n\n\nPHONE CALL RECORDING\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n N/A\n\n\nLOCATION:\n N/A\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nPeterson:\n Are you absolutely sure?\n\n\nHoward:\n Nothing can be certain with this specimen. It threatens to destroy itself if we attempt any physical examination. However, based on the scans we conducted, my research team has ascertained that its destructive potential is at least 0.5 kilotons of TNT. That figure seems to rise as it consumes more volatile material, which causes its internal temperature to fluctuate in a way that should not be possible.\n\n\nPeterson:\n I knew it. I don't know why everyone insists on downplaying how dangerous it is.\n\n\nHoward:\n I don't know either. Several other researchers have corroborated my team's findings, but they told me in private that they would refuse to officially endorse any such published report.\n\n\nPeterson:\n What, why? That's preposterous.\n\n\nHoward:\n I ask myself the same question.\n\n\nPeterson:\n 0.5 kilotons\u2026 Have you estimated the sort of damage that would cause?\n\n\nHoward:\n I must reiterate: 0.5 kilotons, at least. Levels 5 through 15 would be effectively vaporized, and Building C would suffer critical structural damage. The consensus among the engineers I consulted is that it would have to be demolished.\n\n\nPeterson:\n I'd advise you to not share your findings with anyone for the time being. Wait for the right moment. Nothing is as it seems with \u201cthe object.\u201d\n\n\nHoward:\n I concur. Although I find it difficult to conceal the truth, it's probably for the best.\n\n\nPeterson:\n Remember, during Monday's meeting, you must act as if we never spoke. Do not acknowledge any conversation between us took place. Not directly, indirectly, or through any implications.\n\n\nHoward:\n Understood. Goodbye.\n\n\nPeterson:\n Bye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNOFFICIAL MEMO | SITE-909A: RE: Regarding SCP-8321 (114)\n\n\nMr. Landry,\n\n\nMy advisors have deemed Dr. Lewandowski's report unequivocally and entirety accurate. The object, in the event of self-destruction, would cause negligible damage to Site-909A. Estimated damages would not exceed $15,000, and only the interior of the containment cell would be affected.\n\n\nAnyone who attempts to contradict these facts, in an official capacity, will be subpoenaed immediately, and may be subject to further penalties.\n\n\nThe current containment procedures are to remain in place until SCP-8321 has exhausted its utility. Continue research efforts as usual.\n\n\nPlease destroy this message after acknowledging your understanding.\n\n\n- Regional Director Greyford\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNOFFICIAL MEMO | SITE-909A: RE: Financial, Maintenance (82,940)\n\n\nMs. Waterson,\n\n\nAnother $50,000,000 in equipment has \u201cvanished\u201d (is no longer accounted for).
