Experimentation on and access to SCP-2061 is currently suspended indefinitely. Future experimentation with SCP-2061 is to be led by Foundation personnel employed as contractors by the Sharp Corporation.\n\n\nThe three living 2061-Positive individuals are currently housed in Foundation-affiliated offsite inpatient psychiatric facilities, listed in Document 2061-C. Professional care at these facilities has been directed at avoiding visual contact between 2061-Positive individuals and objects capable of performing user-facing electronic mathematical calculations.\n1\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2061 is a late-1970s Sharp ElsiMate EL-1185 electronic printing pocket calculator. SCP-2061 produces a compulsive effect in >99% of humans viewing it\n2\n in person, within a range of approximately 20 meters. This effect is nullified if there is any solid physical object between SCP-2061 and the viewer, even if the object is transparent. Windows, plastic bags and other clear objects have proven sufficient to prevent the manifestation of SCP-2061\u2019s effect.\n\n\nThe compulsive urge manifests as an irresistible desire to insert any object capable of performing user-facing electronic mathematical calculations into one\u2019s own oral cavity, as deeply as possible. This urge manifests regardless of the harm caused by its being acted upon, and a number of fatalities and severe tracheal injuries were caused by SCP-2061 prior to the object\u2019s transfer to SCP Foundation containment.\n\n\nSCP-2061\u2019s cognitohazardous effect does not appear to manifest on any individuals who meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\nCriterion A:\n Individuals who have received payment from the Sharp Corporation or any of its subsidiaries at any point in their lives\n\n\nCriterion B:\n Individuals who have had unprotected sexual intercourse\n3\n with those meeting Criterion A.\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals having sexual intercourse with those meeting Criterion B but not Criterion A do not have immunity from SCP-2061\u2019s effects, in four known instances.\n\n\nInterviews with Sharp Corporation executives and investigation into corporate records has thus far unearthed no purposeful connection between Sharp and SCP-2061.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-2061 was initially contained by the Trenton Police Department, after a family of five died of asphyxiation from inserting SCP-2061 into their oral cavities in turn. Initial responding officer R. Allen was able to insert SCP-2061 into a sealed evidence bag, as she met Criteria B for SCP-2061 immunity. This prevented discovery of SCP-2061\u2019s anomalous effect until two investigators from the department died and one was hospitalized from its effects after removing SCP-2061 from its evidence bag, at which point the Foundation was notified.\n\n\nInitial press reports from the Trenton area were censored by Local Task Force 609-Semkath (\u201cSuper Bowl Three\u201d). An excerpt of a \nTrenton Times\n article from 1976 regarding the first known 2061 event is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Since SCP-2061\u2019s initial containment in 1979, this category of objects has dramatically expanded, including phones, PDAs and other objects listed in External Containment Guidelines.\n\n\n2\n. Those able to be impacted by this compulsive urge are known as 2061-Susceptible individuals.\n\n\n3\n. The requirements of \u201cunprotected sexual intercourse\u201d for the spread of SCP-2061 immunity are currently not fully understood, beyond direct bodily fluid contact. Further study on these requirements is currently proposed by Foundation demographic researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2060\n | SCP-2061 | \nSCP-2062\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2061\n\" by Kate McTiriss, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
