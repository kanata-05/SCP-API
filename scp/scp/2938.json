Personnel are to have no direct exposure to SCP-2938 outside of testing protocols.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2938 is 1.7\u00a0kg of a clear, colorless substance. Its shape, density and composition are variable and reactive to ambient environmental conditions. When exposed to different testing conditions, SCP-2938 transforms into a variety of other substances by unknown means. There is no distinguishable pattern to the transformations.\n\n\nPartial Test Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest parameters\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample placed in 250\u00a0mL beaker\n\n\nSCP-2938 initially separated in 2 distinct masses, which then operated according to an unknown force to rejoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample injected with 0.5\u00a0mL radioactive dye.\n\n\nDye rapidly diffused into sample and was unretrievable, although radiation was still detectable. Sample acquired faint coloration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample consumed by laboratory mouse.\n\n\nSubsequent vivisection revealed that all bodily fluids were primarily composed of SCP-2938 with contaminants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample consumed by laboratory mouse.\n\n\nLong-term monitoring revealed that most biochemical processes and organ functioning were dependent on the presence of SCP-2938. No adverse health effects were noted prior to disposal of mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample subjected to increasing pressure at stable temperature of 25\u00baC.\n\n\nConverted into unidentified liquid substance with maximum density of 997\u00a0kg/m\u00b3. Reverted to SCP-2938 once pressure was decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample heated to 75\u00baC.\n\n\nAt 50\u00baC, converted into a liquid suspension containing large amounts of oxidane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample cooled to -25 \u00baC.\n\n\nAt 0\u00baC, converted into a crystalline solid composed of hydroxylic acid. No further changes noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0g sample dissolved in 10\u00a0mL water.\n\n\nAdmixture converted to liquid DHMO\n1\n upon stirring. When allowed to come to rest, entire mass reverted to 15\u00a0g of SCP-2938.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that SCP-2938 appears able to convert other substances into more of itself, combined with its inherently corrosive nature and the unpredictable nature of its transformations, it is estimated that the introduction of any quantity of SCP-2938 to an uncontrolled ecosystem would potentially result in an HK-class environmental conversion scenario.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Supervisory review revealed test data irregularities consistent with active cognitohazardous effect. Testing was independently replicated under CH-corrective protocols and returned the same results. Upon further review, SCP-2938 has been marked as free of cognitohazards by the Department of Memetics & Cognitohazards.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
