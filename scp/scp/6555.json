Exploration within SCP-6555's interior have provided the following results:\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration and layout of SCP-6555 suggests that the structure was, at one point, semi-modular. The presence of warped steel and broken synthetic compounds near the northwestern and eastern sectors was also noted during exploration, indicating significant surface impact.\n2\n\n\nInside Room 15A, located near SCP-6555's southern region, a series of rectangular objects made of cotton and wool cushioning, adhesives, and steel coil springs have been sporadically laid throughout.\n\n\nOther unidentified items, such as round containers of plastic filled with water in Room 06, have also been discovered within SCP-6555.\n\n\nVentilation, air conditioning, and other primitive systems present within SCP-6555 show that the interior of the building was once adequately maintained and supplied with oxygen.\n\n\nMiscellaneous calcium fragments and ligaments, almost identical in DNA composition as that of ancient mammalian organisms, were discovered nearby SCP-6555's central transmitter. Fragments have been dated to be at least several thousand years old, indicating unnaturally quick and potentially anomalous decomposition.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6555-1:\n Months after SCP-6555's discovery, Foundation personnel were able to translate its broadcast, resulting in the following message:\n\n\n\n\nWE ARE CLOSER TO FINDING WHAT ONCE WAS LOST. WHAT TURNED THE TIDES AND SHOOK THE WORLD WILL NOW LEAD US BACK. DO NOT LOSE FAITH. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSER TO \nFINDING OUR WAY HOME\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, inscriptions of several Foundation insignia inside SCP-6555 were observed during exploration, all of which still pending further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0available\u00a0satellite\u00a0images\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0available\u00a0satellite\u00a0images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage taken of SCP-6555 from above XEO 8537-A's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
