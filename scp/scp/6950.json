If such an event occurs, they are to follow standard protocol for interacting with incorporeal humanoid entities. Personnel must dress plainly and appropriately for nighttime weather, as\u00a0not to arouse suspicion.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6950 is an incorporeal humanoid resembling a young woman with shoulder length blonde hair, dressed in a white sweater and skirt (See additional documentation describing spectral entities of a similar nature\n1\n for further information).\n\n\nSCP-6950 will manifest bi-weekly at exactly 12:00AM on an indiscriminate night, walking along an uninhabited section of roadside, dubbed by locals as \u201cWendy\u2019s Road\u201d, outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England. SCP-6950 will de-manifest if no vehicles pass by before 12:01AM. If a vehicle does arrive, SCP-6950 will display a hand signal as if attempting to flag its driver for a lift. As of writing, no reported persons have stopped to pick up SCP-6950 either out of fear or disinterest.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n Local legends predating SCP-6950\u2019s discovery describe a young woman (Wendy Williams) of similar age having committed suicide twenty-five years ago, nearby the location. The road was given the title \"Wendy\u2019s Road\" by locals after several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted a \"spectre\" resembling a young woman on multiple occasions. Additional sightings became less frequent overtime, causing the local legend to eventually fade into near obscurity.\n\n\nSCP-6950 was reported following a sudden number of additional sightings twenty-five years later.\n\n\nLittle is currently known about the extent of SCP-6950\u2019s anomalous properties or the reason for its sudden resurfacing. Excavation of Wendy William\u2019s remains for further study is under consideration.\n\n\nAddendum:\n During bi-weekly monitoring of Wendy\u2019s Road, personnel witnessed a car drive by, containing SCP-6950 in the passenger seat. The vehicle was tracked the following day to Craig Spritner, a local civilian who claimed to be unfamiliar with the local legend.\n\n\nCraig Spritner explained that he had picked up SCP-6950 and dropped it off near a local cemetery two miles away. Upon arriving back home, Mr. Spritner found a tattered white sweater on his front seat, containing strands of blonde hair.\n\n\nSCP-6950 did not manifest at Wendy\u2019s Road the following midnight. It was instead reported two miles away at a rest area Burger King. Agent Simmons was sent to investigate.\n\n\nInterview Log:\n\n\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n Excuse me. May I speak to you?\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n Oh hey, it\u2019s you guys. The creepy stalkers.\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n No! We- I was just confused about why you\u2019re here.\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n \u2026I\u2019m hungry?\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n But you\u2019re incorporeal. A ghost, aren\u2019t you?\n\n\nSCP-6950 visibly takes a bite out of its double cheeseburger\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n They do it in \"Ghostbusters\". It\u2019s easy.\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n Ok then\u2026 But you moved from your original placement. What made you leave?\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n I told you. I was hungry.\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n No! I mean, why did you stop haunting \"Wendy\u2019s Road\"?\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n Haunting? I wasn\u2019t haunting it. I was walking to a friend\u2019s place and tried to get a lift. No luck though, everyone shits their pants whenever they get a glimpse of me. Normally I wear all white to stand out more in the dark, so much for that.\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n Then who were you trying to visit?\n\n\nSCP-6950 stares blankly for several seconds\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n \u2026Wendy.\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n \u2026Are you telling me that you\u2019re not the spirit of Wendy Williams, the girl who died while hitchhiking twenty-five years ago?\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n No. I died last year. Fucking Covid\u2026\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n So she haunts the cemetery instead?\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n No, she lives there. She\u2019s a fucking ghost.\n\n\nAgent Simmons pulls out the sweater recovered from Craig Spritner\u2019s car\n\n\nAgent Simmons:\n This sweater then. Does it hold any sort of significance, or symbolic meaning relating to your death?\n\n\nSCP-6950 stares at the sweater\n\n\nSCP-6950:\n Oh shit, my sweater! Forgot about that.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6950 left the Burger King with the sweater shortly after, before de-manifesting. As Agent Simmons did not ask SCP-6950 for a name, its former identity has yet to be determined. The cashier who had witnessed the event was later amnesticized.\n\n\nRevision of SCP-6950\u2019s containment procedures is underway.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nSCP-1337\n, \nSCP-1401\n, and \nSCP-2539",
