No further actions are necessary unless experiments are being conducted.\n\n\nSCP-1581-1 is to be contained in a standard human containment unit. \nBecause of continued cooperation with the Foundation, SCP-1581-1 is allowed to tour the site if accompanied by security personnel, and any appropriate requests may be reviewed and granted. No contact is permitted with any personnel actively involved with any other SCP object. Otherwise, anyone with Level 1 Clearance or higher is allowed to engage SCP-1581-1 in casual conversation, or arrange visits in the containment unit.\n Following Incident 1581-001, SCP-1581-1 is to be confined to the containment unit at all times, and no personnel is allowed to enter the unit without Level 4 authorization and supervision. This restriction can be ignored by security personnel for interventions in case of an emergency.\n\n\nThe toilet that SCP-1581-1 uses must be designed and fitted with a device that automatically seals the matter SCP-1581-1 defecates into plastic containers before disposal.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1581 is a cohesive lump of semi-digested carrot pulp and mashed carrots, approximately 2.4m in diameter. It is roughly spherical, and contains traces of other food components, as well as digestive enzymes, gut flora and feces. When separating matter from SCP-1581 through any means, the largest remaining part regains its original mass and size, while any separated material becomes non-anomalous. However, SCP-1581 can be relocated if moved as a whole.\n\n\nSCP-1581 is a spatial anomaly. Objects inserted from any direction enter an extradimensional space filled with more of the same substance SCP-1581 is composed of, apparently found within an anomalously large gastrointestinal tract. Objects may also exit this extradimensional space the same way, by moving or being moved in a straight line through the position occupied by SCP-1581 inside the tract. GPS devices placed within SCP-1581 always indicate their location as SCP-1581-1.\n\n\nSCP-1581-1 is a human male, aged 44, believed to somehow contain SCP-1581, as well as the extradimensional space it leads to. SCP-1581-1\u2019s intestines are completely filled with carrot pulp, and defecating results in the same substance. Despite this, SCP-1581-1 experiences no adverse health effects that this condition would normally create, and needs to consume food just like a regular human. Consumed food does not appear to enter SCP-1581-1\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, and any object inserted into SCP-1581 does not actually appear inside SCP-1581-1.\n\n\nExploration of the space within SCP-1581 is difficult, due to the mashed carrot substance that appears to fill it completely. Human exploration is possible, but difficult and impractical. Endoscopic examination with modified length endoscopes has proved the most versatile. This way, the area in the vicinity of SCP-1581 can be mapped by inserting an endoscope until an intestinal wall is hit, and then continuing along the wall. Through this method, it has been found that the carrot pulp immediately around SCP-1581 is contained within an intestine approximately 5m in diameter, and moving \u201cdownstream\u201d at a rate of about 12mm per day. Of note is the fact that about 15 meters \u201cdownstream\u201d, a junction has been discovered in the gastrointestinal tract, where the intestine cavern splits into two smaller ones. The significance of this is unknown, and SCP-1581-1\u2019s intestinal tract itself does not present any such anomalous anatomical features.\n\n\nEndoscopic examination of SCP-1581-1 has shown that his duodenum and anus both lead to a similar extradimensional space as SCP-1581.\n\n\nRecovery Notes:\n SCP-1581-1 was brought to the Foundation\u2019s attention on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, through a phone call placed by his son, from their home in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to a local doctor, describing SCP-1581-1\u2019s condition, that the son reported has been going on for two days prior to the call. At the time of containment, SCP-1581-1 was cataloged as Anomalous Item \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, in lack of apparent need for containment procedures. SCP-1581-1 is unable to recall the exact moment of onset of his condition, or any anomalous events that would\u2019ve caused it, and has stated that he strongly dislikes the consumption of carrot-based foods.\n\n\nSCP-1581 was discovered after the material extracted from SCP-1581-1 was gradually collected into a large waste container following testing. When attempting to dispose of the contents, the anomalous nature of SCP-1581 was immediately noted. It is believed that material from SCP-1581-1 reached a critical mass that somehow resulted in the creation of SCP-1581. Experiments to attempt to create additional instances are not permitted at this time.\n\n\nMedical Intervention Report 319-1581:\n On 5/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588 at \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 hours, bowel obstruction surgery was performed on SCP-1581-1, in an attempt to remove the matter filling his gastrointestinal tract. Surgery performed as usual, intestinal wall breached, and a total of 11.7\u00a0kg of carrot pulp was removed. No anatomical abnormalities noted. SCP-1581-1 recovered in the next \u2588 hours. Post-surgery examination revealed the absence of carrot pulp in SCP-1581-1's intestines, and endoscopic examination revealed no further anomalous properties. Surgery declared success. SCP-1581-1 placed in containment for observation following medical recovery.\n\n\nOf note that, at this time, GPS devices inserted into SCP-1581 still showed their location as SCP-1581-1.\n\n\nIncident 1581-001:\n On 7/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, 44 hours after Medical Intervention 319-1581, Research Assistant Peters performed a casual visit of SCP-1581-1's unit. This was not considered unusual, and therefore their discussion was not recorded. The surveillance video logs of SCP-1581-1's unit during this event can be accessed at [REDACTED]. Analysis of video logs shows no anomalous behavior beyond casual conversation.\n\n\nTwelve (12) minutes and twenty-one (21) seconds after the conclusion of the visit, Research Assistant Peters gained access to SCP-1581's containment cell and immediately proceeded to consume material from it. Due to the low security priority of SCP-1581's cell, Research Assistant Peters was able to continue this activity for two (2) minutes and ten (10) seconds before being forcefully removed by security personnel. Following the incident, Research Assistant Peters was unable to account for or explain his previous actions.\n\n\nImmediate medical examination revealed that no carrot pulp was present in Research Assistant Peters' gastrointestinal tract. Subsequent examination of SCP-1581-1 showed that his intestines once again contained carrot pulp, and that the previous anomalous conditions have returned. SCP-1581-1 placed in isolation.\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a01581-8/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\n\nInterview between SCP-1581-1 and Dr. Steel, concerning the events of Incident 1581-001. The interview was performed on 8/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, 12 hours following the incident.\n\n\n\n\n<begin recording>\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n SCP-1581-1, I would like to ask you some questions regarding yesterday. Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Go on, doctor.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n Do you recall your last conversation with Research Assistant Peters?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n Yes, I believe I do.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n What exactly did you talk about?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n You know, just the usual. News from the outside world, sports, the such. It\u2019s good to break the isolation from time to time. Oh, and we talked about me a bit, too. He never really mentioned it before, but it\u2019s no surprise that he eventually did. I do have this terrible condition, and among friends, it comes up sooner or later.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n Are you aware that your condition was cured following the surgery?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n Cured? Gosh no. You removed the substance, but the essence, that was still there. And now it\u2019s back, as you can see.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n So it seems. But why did you convince Research Assistant Peters to restore you to your current condition?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n Restore? Don\u2019t be silly, doctor. How on Earth would he even do such a thing?\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n Are you not aware of Research Assistant Peters\u2019 actions following your discussion with him?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n No, I\u2019m not. I assume he\u2019s a very busy man, labcoat and all. I don\u2019t ask him about his work, I know he can\u2019t tell me.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n Ten minutes after leaving your containment unit, Research Assistant Peters gained access to SCP-1581 and ate from it.\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n Ew. Oh, wow. I mean, it\u2019s carrots\u2026 Is he fine?\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n He\u2019s alright for the time being. So, are you saying you had nothing to do with what he did?\n\n\nSCP-1581-1:\n What, you\u2019re thinking I hypnotized him or something? No, sir. It's not like I'd even know how to do that. We just talked, is all. Hey, if he\u2019s feeling better, could I see him later? I really want to be sure that he\u2019s fine.\n\n\nDr. Steel:\n Interview concluded.\n\n\n<end of recording>\n\n\n\n\nFifteen (15) minutes after the interview, Dr. Steel was apprehended by security, trying to gain access to the containment chamber of SCP-1581.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1580\n | SCP-1581 | \nSCP-1582\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1581\n\" by zolikk, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
