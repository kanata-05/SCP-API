Manifestations have been marked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3349\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Individuals affected by SCP-3349 are to be admitted indefinitely as inpatients under routine care in Foundation Long-Term Acute Care facilities so as to not re-expose SCP-3349 to civilian physicians and the medical community at large. Reports of instances are to be intercepted by field agents, who are to use experiential discretion regarding the use of Class A amnestics.\n\n\nThe cardiac activity of patients admitted with SCP-3349 is to be monitored at all times by a centralized telemetry unit, continuously staffed with two 12-hour shift clerical personnel. Instances of SCP-3349 are to be reported by the clerical staff to the nursing staff promptly via an exclusive telephone line. Electrical manifestations of SCP-3349 are to be captured when possible, the printouts catalogued both in the patient's analog and electronic record.\n\n\nBeginning in 1941, SCP-3349 has been actively expunged from the civilian medical community and literature, initially per endeavors of \nMobile Task Force Gamma 5 (\u201cRed Herrings\u201d)\n and since continued by the ongoing global acquisition and obscuration of case studies by the D.E.A.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3349 is a nonfatal cardiac arrhythmia that has a 42.8% incidence following a specific sequence of intravenous drug administrations:\n\n\n\n\n150\u00a0mg IV drip of amiodarone (infused over 15 minutes)\n\n\n1\u00a0g IV infusion of magnesium (infused over 1 hour)\n\n\n1 ampule of sodium bicarbonate (infused over 3-4 minutes)\n\n\n0.1 mcg IV of epinephrine (immediate push)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3349 is not constant and appears periodically in the affected individual with an average of nine occurrences per day, lasting for an average of three minutes per occurrence. Subjectively, patients report feeling comforted, elated, and euphoric. Objectively, SCP-3349 produces a \u201cfluttering\u201d central and peripheral pulse upon palpation, often described as tactilely similar to a purr of \nFelis catus\n (the common house cat), and can be auscultated with a stethoscope, the clinical descriptions also citing the purr of \nFelis catus\n.\n2\n\n\nOn electrocardiogram, SCP-3349's manifestations display commonalities with the waveforms of human vocalizations. Spectrographically-reconstructed audio signals\n3\n based on SCP-3349's electrical signatures produce various intonations of human-like laughter, wailing, and speech (See \"Audio Data\" below). Auditory outputs resembling the purr of \nFelis catus\n have also been reported.\n\n\nSCP-3349 is non-curable and is refractory to defibrillation at 200, 300, and 360 Joules. There are no known precipitating or alleviating factors regarding SCP-3349, other than the aforementioned induction. Despite the erratic electrical activity, patients remain stable, though few may experience some reduction in exercise tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Data\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb\u00a0Input\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Credentials\u00a0\u00ab\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Credentials\u00a0Accepted\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA classic presentation of SCP-3349.\n4\n\n\nFile\n \u2014 AAR.3349.A10302 \u2014 Auscultation with digital stethoscope, post amplification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00.0-11.1 seconds \u2014 Normal sinus rhythm with increasing tachycardia\n\n11.1-24.2 seconds \u2014 SCP-3349\n\n24.2-30.0 seconds \u2014 Spontaneous return to normal sinus rhythm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n \u2014 AARwDC.3349.D1323 \u2014 Spectrographic resynthesis from Leads I, V5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:\n An example of a reverse-engineered waveform from spectrographic data \n(top)\n taken from an SCP-3349 electrical signature \n(bottom)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Medical Record Number \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nObtained August 25, 1955\u00a003:14\n\nSome interpreters detect a vocalization resembling human laughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n \u2014 AARwDC.3349.F163 \u2014 Spectrographic resynthesis from Leads II, III, V1, V2, aVF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Medical Record Number \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nObtained June 12, 1947\u00a023:32\n\nSome interpreters detect multi-layered human and/or canine-like wailing.

This is Macy \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 32 year old white female, past medical history of hysteria and celiac disease, no known drug allergies or surgical history. The medications indicated in the procedure notes are prepared and we are accessing by a left external jugular central catheter. Medical number is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Can we\u2026pull the machine over closer I can\u2019t see it.\n\n\nC:\n Is that it?\u2026there?\n\n\nDr.W:\n I don\u2019t know Cathy I need to see. Alright keep the blood pressure cuff cycling.\n\n\n08:37 - Dr. Whote and his staff initiate messages (\u201cHello\u201d, \u201cGreetings\u201d, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d) coded in Morse and delivered by (1) playing the auditory sequence near the ear of the patient, (2) manual percussion at the sternum, and (3) electrical impulses via transvenous pacing. The Dr. places his stethoscope on the patients chest.\n\n\nDr.W:\n Can you hear me?\n\n\nDr. moves his stethoscope to various points.

No response from the patient or the team.\n\n\nDr.W:\n I say, this is a Doctor; I am attempting to speak with you. If you can hear me then let us know somehow.\n\n\nNo indication of a reply. The Dr. takes his stethoscope off after several minutes of searching and listening.\n\n\nDr.W:\n This is as ridiculous as a seance. Turn all that \n****\n off.\n\n\nRNs comply and the test is aborted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3349.02:\n Over sixty years after the above session, Junior Researcher Mark Regimere (since promoted) recovered the actual EKG printouts (previously presumed lost) and submitted them to novel methods to approximate the captured signatures as spectrograms. Below are the outputs when set to logarithmic scales:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram 3349.DW.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram 3349.DW.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-reference with Foundation data suggests with a 95% confidence interval that the youth depicted in the above spectrograms to be the deceased daughter of Dr. Whote, who was lost to a pedestrian-versus-automobile collision at the untimely age of six.\n\n\nAdditional attempts at communication with SCP-3349 are currently being authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
