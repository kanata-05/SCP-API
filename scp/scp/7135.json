The chamber is fully filled snow and SCP-7135 is located benath the snow layer. Sensors have been placed above various body parts of the anomaly to ensure its presence. It is the responsibility of the assigned personnel to ensure that the temperature of -45\u00b0C is maintained from the control center using the devices placed inside the chamber.\n\n\nIf the desired temperature rises, Protocol-7135-01 must be activated by the Site Director.\n\n\n\n\nProtocol-7135-01\n\n\nInstruction 1:\n SCP-7135 is to be removed from its containment chamber.\n\n\nInstruction 2:\n SCP-7135 will be transported to the wild area, which is 2.3 miles away from the Site.\n\n\nNote:\n \nThe transportation operation cannot be initiated without the proper permission and signing of the Site Director. Any personnel who prefer to avoid this action will be strictly punished.\n\n\nInstruction 3:\n Upon arriving in the wild area, SCP-7135 will be deployed there and will be watched by the Foundation Personnel. All required measures will be taken in case of any snowstorm. Meanwhile, the containment chamber of the SCP-7135 will be opened and every single device will be replaced. Replacement of the snow is optional.\n\n\nInstruction 4:\n After all repair is done, SCP-7135 will be re-contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7135 is a biologically dead, decomposed, and emaciated humanoid entity that stands at 193\u00a0cm and weighs 72 kilograms. The entity's somber and shadowy appearance is owing to an anomalous phase of livor mortis which imparts it with a black hue and gray cracks and ruptures that expose the underlying bones. Notably, the skin on the left hand is entirely absent, leaving the hand bones entirely exposed. SCP-7135 lacks any discernible body hair and is devoid of a mouth. Its eyes are characterized by a black sclera and fully white pupil that can emit a luminosity so bright that it can be seen from 3-4 miles away at night.\n\n\nThe integumentary tissue of the chest region appears to have undergone a severe tearing, similar in size to that of a soccer ball, which has exposed the rib cage underneath. Nevertheless, two bones of the rib cage join diagonally and act as a fulcrum for SCP-7135-01, a standard looking cassette tape. SCP-7135 does not have any blood or circulation in its body, with the lack of veins and nervous systems. According to multiple X-ray tests, it has been established that SCP-7135 lacks internal organs and possesses a normal skeleton. Although SCP-7135 does not possess any anomalous strength properties, it appears to be immune to knives and firearms. SCP-7135 is observed to be in a sitting or lying position at all times, but it is capable of movement. However, these movements are not visible to the human eye or cameras, and the means by which SCP-7135 moves remain unknown. \nExperiments specifically including this issue will be conducted in the future.\n Mentioned experiments have been successfully consummated. Please head to Addendum-7135-02 for further information.\n\n\nSCP-7135-01 is a cassette tape that enables SCP-7135 to send basic messages to individuals. Sometimes, without a clear reason, SCP-7135 points its hand towards SCP-7135-01. After that, it is possible for one to extract the tape and listen to it using a cassette player. However, the messages conveyed by SCP-7135 through SCP-7135-01 are heavily distorted, with high degrees of static and a slightly thick tone. The messages lack coherent grammar and are limited to no more than two sentences, but the primary point can usually be discerned. Content of the voice messages are mostly chatter about winter, cold and snow. Upon conclusion of the message, SCP-7135-01 is drawn back into SCP-7135's chest, akin to a magnetic pull. SCP-7135-01 cannot be removed from SCP-7135's ribcage unless SCP-7135 is pointing directly at it.\n\n\nSCP-7135 will not pose any possible danger and move as long as the following conditions are provided:\n\n\n\n\n- If the temperature is -45\u00b0C or lower.\n\n\n- If SCP-7135 is covered under a thick snow layer.\n\n\n- If SCP-7135 does not sense people near it.\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that one or more conditions are not met, SCP-7135 will cause a snowstorm that affects an area within a 2-kilometer radius or greater. These snowstorms typically occur at midnight and SCP-7135 has the potential to either shorten days or cause nights to occur earlier. This matter remains unresolved and requires further attention.\n\n\nThe underlying reason of which is believed to be SCP-7135's sole objective to be engulfed under a thick layer of snow, specifically in frigid environmental conditions. In the absence of such conditions, SCP-7135 resorts to creating severe snowstorms in order to attain its desired temperature and snow cover. While the snowstorms are generally observed to occur on a daily basis, there can be intermittent intervals where the occurrence is not observed. Each snowstorm is to be more severe than the last one.\n\n\nIt is not ascertained when snowstorms will end and they may take place for 7-14-21 days until they reach sufficient cold and snow length for SCP-7135. Once there, the snow length may pass 20 meters with -55\u00b0C weather. SCP-7135 actually does not need this amount of snow and low temperature to acquire its passive state; 1 meter of snow and -45\u00b0C temperature will be sufficient for the anomaly to become passive. SCP-7135 is not directly hostile, but if one removes it from its \" resting location \", SCP-7135 will attempt to follow the mentioned person as long as its movement properties meet the conditions. ( Check Addendum-7135-02. ) This will cause the mentioned person to bring snowstorms wherever they go.\n\n\nTo learn if snowstorms are anomalous events or not, and for further information about the snowstorms please head to Addendum-7135-03.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Show\u00a0Addendum-7135-01\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0-Close\u00a0file\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Containment:\n SCP-7135 was contained back in the 19\u2588\u2588. However, it was removed from the containment by The Chaos Insurgency for unknown reasons. Because of several unknown events, it somehow ended up in Turkiye, Erzurum. In 2023, it was explored by Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on Erzurum Paland\u00f6ken Mountain Range.\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing documents provide the information of Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's discovery.\u00a0\n\n\nNote-01:\n \nBerat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 documented the events using a GoPro\u2122 HERO12 Black v1.20 camera device, which provided point-of-view (POV) footage of his actions. In instances where the camera was not recording, he resorted to taking notes in his notebook. Any notes that were recovered were inserted in the sections where there was no camera recording. All the resources have been translated from Turkish to English, but it is possible that some errors may have occurred due to the fact that Turkish is not a perfect match for English in terms of linguistic nuances.\n\n\nNote-02:\n \nAlong with Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, his 3 friends helped him to transport the 7135.

Rolling snowy mountains can be seen along the miles. There seems to be nothing around but snow. Berat turns around and speaks to man who stand behind him.\n\n\nBerat:\n Alright, I'm recording.\n\n\nBerat:\n Well, it looks like you don't have balls to go first right, Kaan?\n\n\nKaan:\n I need my balls later in my life.\n\n\nKaan appears as wearing ski clothes and equipments. So, it's hard to describe his physical properties.\n\n\nBerat:\n So, you aren't coming?\n\n\nKaan:\n I will, but after you. I don't want to die first.\n\n\nBerat:\n What if you still die?\n\n\nKaan:\n If such a moron like you manages to survive, I myself can invent immortality.\n\n\nBerat:\n What a funny guy you are.\n\n\nKaan:\n I hope we can find the way back.\n\n\nBerat:\n Ski resort is straight south of us. All we have to do is follow the path we came.\n\n\nKaan:\n If you say so.\n\n\nBerat:\n Anyways. No watch me go, loser.\n\n\nBerat starts to slide down. He begins slowy but gets faster every second. Chunks of snow start splattering on the camera. Berat accelerates even more by zigzagging.\n\n\nBut when looks behind him, he sees he caused a small avalanche. Snow masses are sliding downwards.\n\n\nBerat tries to progress even faster to reach the the plain area below. But when he When he reaches the junction of the slope, Berat trips and experiences a sharp fall that causes him to drift for 2-3 meters. Berat screams and the camera pops out of the helmet it's attached to.\n\n\nAfter 4-5 minutes, Berat comes to pick up the camera. Kaan also had came there.\n\n\nKaan:\n Are you really sure you are not injured?\n\n\nBerat:\n I'm fine I said. I just tripped and that's all.\n\n\nKaan:\n From above, you were looking like a baby bird trying to fly.\n\n\nBerat:\n No, your eyes cannot see enough because you masturbate every single day- Hey, what's that?\n\n\nOn the slope where Berat fell, the snow has completely disappeared and a black object is visible. They get closer.\n\n\nThe object is SCP-7135.\n\n\nBerat:\n Holy fucking shit. What the fuck is that thing?!\n\n\nKaan:\n I\u2026 I don't know..\n\n\nBerat gets closer and kneels next to the object and starts touching it.\n\n\nKaan:\n \n( With a quite panicked voice, )\n Berat don't touch ,that thing. Come here.\n\n\nBerat:\n Our new friend is not alive. Come and see.\n\n\nKaan also kneels next to Berat.\n\n\nKaan:\n Are you sure? Its eyes are still open and it's dangerously fucking cold. Colder than the snow. I think- Oh my god. Berat, it's watching us.\n\n\nBerat:\n How do you find a way to fuck with me in every situation- What? How?!\n\n\nBerat stands up and walks back and forth. SCP-7135's\n\npupils follow him as he does that.\n\n\nKaan:\n You know what? Let's just leave this creature in here and go back to the hotel. Don't forget that the girls will arrive this evening. They can help us to forget this.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( With a thoughtful voice, )\n Girls won't make a fortune to us..\n\n\nKaan:\n What? What do you mean by that?\n\n\nBerat:\n I will explain it at the hotel. Now, help me to bury it again.\n\n\nKaan:\n Look, if you are trying to steal my girls-\n\n\nBerat:\n Can you shut up at least for a while? I've said I will explain it in the hotel. We also need others' ideas.\n\n\nKaan:\n G\u00fcnsal, definitely, will want to-\n\n\nBerat:\n The faster we bury it, the faster we will learn the G\u00fcnsal's opinion.\n\n\nKaan:\n What if it is gone when we came back here?\n\n\nBerat:\n I don't think it will move. Otherwise, he would have stood up to kill us already.\n\n\nKaan:\n We didn't do anything to provoke it.\n\n\nBerat sighs and kicks SCP-7135.\n\n\nKaan:\n WHAT THE FUCK? STOP!\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Gets confused and laughs. )\n I didn't think you would react this much.\n\n\nKaan:\n How the fuck should I react when you attack a clearly non fucking human object when we're at middle of fucking nowhere?\n\n\nBerat:\n Take it easy grandma, it still didn't stand up despite I kicked it guts. So he won't. Now, shut the fuck up and help me.\n\n\nKaan:\n If it kills us, I'm coming after you in hell.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah for sure. Now I gotta turn off the camera. You know it consumes a lot of power.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-02\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nVideo recording starts at night time. Where Berat and Kaan found SCP-7135, there are two more people that have not been seen before. One is taller and bigger than all of them, while other one is the shortest. They all stand over SCP-7135 and shortest one shines light on the object with a flashlight.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, I forgot to turn on the camera. Go on, Kaan.\n\n\nKaan:\n Look, even I now accept with Berat, we just can't hide this guy with us.\n\n\nBerat:\n I didn't say we will hide it-\n\n\nBig Man:\n At least until the governorship, we must hide it. Lots of questions will appear if we get caught.\n\n\nShort Guy:\n I agree with G\u00fcnsal. I actually don't because I say we don't get involved with this job at all but G\u00fcnsal is more logical.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I'm logical all the time. Unfortunately, I can't say same compliments about you.\n\n\nShort Guy:\n Leaving this thing here is alone more logical than your whole existence.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Shut up Ak\u00e7elik. We're taking it to the city.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Do you really think that government is going to pay us?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n They have to. Even if they don't, we will get at least several awards and will be remembered as people who found the first alien.\n\n\nBerat:\n And, Turkiye will emerge regarding space and science.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I honestly don't give a shit about that but yeah, it will be good.\n\n\nKaan:\n So, how are we going to remove it from this place?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n We can't carry it to the hotel without taking attention. I say, we park the truck to the road 100-150 meters below, come here, get the guy and place the guy inside the truck and drive off.\n\n\nBerat:\n Seems like pretty good plan for me.\n\n\nKaan:\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n \n( Sighs )\n Well, if you guys say so.\n\n\nThe flashlight goes off.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Oh come on. It's not a good time to joke; I can't see shit.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, Ak\u00e7elik it's not funny. Turn it on.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Guys, I didn't turn off. The light was gone in an instant.\n\n\nKaan:\n Wait a second. Look at its eyes.\n\n\nCamera gets panned to SCP-7135. Maybe because of the camera, object is almost invisible. But, its eyes are glowing like 2 large bulbs.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Were they always that shiny?\n\n\nBerat:\n I don't know but it wasn't that much shiny when we came here for the first time.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n This just makes it more valuable. Nothing to worry about. Now, turn on the fucking light Ak\u00e7elik or I'm gonna bury you here.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n I told you I did not-\n\n\nFlashlight starts to re-function.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n You are the worst at making jokes.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-03\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe recording starts at dawn time. Berat, Kaan and Ak\u00e7elik are in charge of SCP-7135. G\u00fcnsal is not there.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Do you really need to record everything we do?\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah. We are making history here. Have some respect.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Well, then let me send a message for the people who are going to watch this.\n\n\nBerat:\n We're all ears.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n If we end up dying, it's not my fault. My friends are total idiots for doing this.\n\n\nBerat:\n Don't listen to him guys. He's such an asshole.\n\n\nKaan:\n Both of you, shut up now. The time has come; G\u00fcnsal should be close.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n I like how G\u00fcnsal does the little amount of job every single time.\n\n\nBerat:\n I mean this will be the fastest way.\n\n\nKaan:\n Alright, let's go.\n\n\nBerat lifts SCP-7135 from head while other lift it from the legs. They start to walk in this position.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n It's actually not that heavy.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah especially when compared with my grandfather.\n\n\nKaan:\n Your grandfather was in a wooden coffin.\n\n\nBerat:\n Speaking of funerals, why don't we just drag it?\n\n\nKaan:\n This way is faster.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Nah, Kaan just likes to carry funerals since they remind him his gradnma's funeral. Remember how happy he was when he find out she was dead?\n\n\nKaan:\n If it was your grandma who died leaving a legacy like that, you would celebrate it by exploding fireworks up in your ass.\n\n\nAll of them laughs. And after a while, they stop due to flat area ending and a steep descent starting. It's in the length of 20-30 meters. They leave the SCP in floor.\n\n\nBerat:\n What do we do now?\n\n\nKaan:\n I say we just roll the guy.\n\n\nBerat:\n That's a perfect idea but unfortunately, it has a possibility to get heavily damaged.\n\n\nKaan:\n Since when you are talking like a fucking philosopher? Anyways, what I'm saying is this guy looks like it's been here like for 1000 years. I don't think some rolling will hurt him.\n\n\nBerat:\n That can work, actually.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n How will we go down?\n\n\nKaan:\n It's a shame that ski equipments are in the car. We have to go down by walking.\n\n\nThey put SCP-7135 in a horizontal position and roll it.\n\n\nBerat:\n There he goes.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n I hope he doesn't explode.\n\n\nSCP-7135 stops at the start of the hill.\n\n\nKaan:\n Alright, now it's our turn.\n\n\nAfter a 15 minutes of landing, they finally get to there. They see G\u00fcnsal also arrived with the car.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \nGets out of the car\n Where is the guy?\n\n\nBerat:\n What? We rolled him from the top and he was lying on right there.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Well, I don't see a dark half-living corpse here.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Maybe it sank into the snow?\n\n\nKaan:\n You know this is a stupid statement.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n I'm trying to help, okay?\n\n\nWhile no one is looking, the sound of a car door opening and closing is heard.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n What was that?\n\n\nBerat:\n It came from the car.\n\n\nThere is a certain tension in the air; It's like no one wants to move.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Lord help us.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \n( Trying to talk with a cheerful voice, )\n Come on guys. We're 4 strong man. No one can hurt us. Let's check the car.\n\n\nKaan:\n Be quiet.\n\n\nThey approach the car slowly. It's a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, black in color. The windows are covered with black film.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal opens the driver door.\n\n\nNo one can speak for a brief because of what they see.\n\n\nCamera shows SCP-7135 sitting on the front seat.\n\n\nBerat:\n What the actual fuck?\n\n\nKaan:\n How is this can be possible?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n It seems like our friend isn't dead that much.\n\n\nKaan:\n How did he come here?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Okay, listen to me. I know it might sound weird but this is a good thing.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n What? How something like this moving or teleporting could be a good thing?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n No one would believe in our fully dead corpse being an allien.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n A moving corpse is not any better.\n\n\nKaan:\n G\u00fcnsal, I don't know why but I've got a bad feeling.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, maybe we shouldn't do this.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Finally, some people that understand me.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \n( Turns to Berat )\n Look, you found it and this was your idea. You cannot give up.\n\n\nBerat:\n I didn't know it could teleport.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n What's the matter? He would kill us right now if he wanted. All we need to do is keeping our eye on him. Now, you all shut up and help me.\n\n\nThey take SCP-7135 from the seat and place it in the luggage, under the clothing and ski equipment.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I've said they would all fit inside.\n\n\nKaan:\n I hope our man doesn't kill us at our sleep.\n\n\nBerat:\n I think our biggest problem is The Police.

We all deserved a good holiday.\n\n\nKaan:\n Yeah but unfortunately, we need to be back in 4 days. Can you give me one cigarette G\u00fcnsal?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n And we will arrive with such a great surpize: A fucking alive corpse with teleportion abilities\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I have no intention to show our discovery to others. The first one to see will be the officals.\n\n\nBerat:\n Can we stop talking about him? It kinda disturbs me at the moment.\n\n\nKaan:\n Yeah, \n( Takes a long drag from the cigarette )\n why don't we talk about Erzurum?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \n( Laughs )\n I actually can't believe that I missed Erzurum.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n You are a true Dada\u015f\n1\n, then.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Yeah, I'm so Dada\u015f that I come here every 5 years.\n\n\nEveryone laughs.\n\n\nBerat:\n I don't know about you guys but I still love this city. We all were born here.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I was just kidding. I also like Erzurum and I still remember our high school years.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Speaking of high school, do you remember the time when Cemil accidentally cursed at the girl who was known attacking to people who curse?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n And he defended himself by saying: \" It was a reflex, okay. \"\n\n\nEveryone laughs.\n\n\nBerat:\n I wonder how he is doing.\n\n\nKaan:\n He was at Berlin when we spoke for the last time, like 1-2 years.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n He did dirty to us but I loved him.\n\n\nKaan:\n Forget Cemil, okay. He is not worth of speaking. Erzurum is better to speak of. The villages we passed by\u2026 How people still live like this?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Just like us. They have no idea what luxury is, so they are okay with it.\n\n\nKaan:\n Yeah, but I don't know\u2026 It must be hard. I'm so lucky that I'm not a villager.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n When I was still little I was, working with my father at our village. I only worked for maybe 5 days and I was fucked. It's that hard and harder in Erzurum, where the winter happens for 6 months just like now.\n\n\nBerat:\n Speaking of villages, I have an offer for you guys. We can go to the village I was born.\n\n\nKaan:\n Your village? I just said how I feel about villages and you want to take us to the your village?!\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, it sounds weird I know. But, we still have 4 days before returning to \u0130stanbul and we did everything we can. Why don't we do such a fantasy?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Look, I'm actually up for this but we can't go there since we have a corpse with us.\n\n\nBerat:\n Since the dawn, he didn't attempt to escape. He will stay at luggage and my grandfather's house is pretty away from the main square of village. We can hide it in there.\n\n\nBerat:\n My father was the former headman of the village. They will be polite against us, don't worry.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Well, what could it be? We can learn to live as poor.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I can teach you that, Ak\u00e7elik.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n I'm sure about that.\n\n\nKaan:\n Well, I actually think this is a bad idea but fuck it.\n\n\nBerat:\n I promise it will be fun. And there are some really hot chicks in our village.\n\n\nKaan:\n Oh really?\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, sure. But I may have fucked a few of them.\n\n\nKaan:\n You-\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/11/2023/\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-05\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nVideo recording starts in a quite old village house, stairs going down.

It can be seen that the leaves of the trees ahead are shaking.\n\n\nSuddenly it starts to snow. First slowyly, but but it gets faster and faster.

It's day time and all group members are in a middle sized room. Room is pretty dirty and does not look welcoming at all. There is one big couch, two little chairs and nothing else. Cobwebs can be seen everywhere. Doorknocks are heard.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Damn, Berat's villager friends are so polite that they want to break in.\n\n\nBerat:\n Look, I have no idea why they do that.\n\n\nKaan:\n It must be because of the that child. Probably whole village is thinking we are all pedophile.\n\n\n3 of them turns their heads to G\u00fcnsal.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n There was no other option I had, okay? Should I have allowed her to tell everything she saw?\n\n\nBerat:\n She still told everything, you fucking idiot, and with the detail of a large man scaring her.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Guys, stop fighting. It's all okay. I have a plan.\n\n\nKaan:\n What's that?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n We will face with them and tell them that the thing girl saw is just a robot we're working on.\n\n\nBerat:\n Oh great idea. I wonder what will we do if they want to see it?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n We will show it to them. We will say that we equipped this robot with the latest technology available. They won't understand a shit, trust me.\n\n\nDoor is knocked again impatiently.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I don' see any other option. Let's open the door.\n\n\nThey all go to the doorway together. Kaan opens the door and they go outside.\n\n\nAlmost 200 villagers surround the house. They are all in knee deep in snow. Amount of the snow has increased since the night.\n\n\nKaan:\n Damn, it's so fucking cold.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal comes forward and starts speaking with a loud house.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n What do you wan-\n\n\nA deep male voice:\n Shut up kid.\n\n\nThe owner of the voice comes forward, other villagers give way.\n\n\nHe appears to be a big old man with long white hair and beard and a face full of wounds.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Who the hell are you grandpa?\n\n\nOld man:\n My name is Akif and I'm the headman of this village.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Nice to meet you. I'm G\u00fcnsal, owner of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Car Gallery. Berat, can you explain to Mr. Akif why we're here?\n\n\nBerat:\n Me?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Yeah. Your father was the recent headman, right? They must know you.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah he was. Alright.\n\n\nBerat comes forward.\n\n\nBerat:\n I'm sure most of you still remember the Muhtar\n2\n Bilal. I'm his son, Berat.\n\n\nAkif:\n I remember your father, he was my best friend. I also remember you, Berat.\n\n\nBerat:\n I was still so little when I went to city with my mother so I can't remember most of you guys. Anyways, this house is a legacy to me by my grandfather and I came here with my friends to chill out-\n\n\nAkif:\n We have important things to talk. \nTurns to villagers\n You can go to your houses. I will talk with the young men.\n\n\nPeople start to disperse. Akif walks inside the house without saying anything. G\u00fcnsal looks after him as confused.\n\n\nBerat makes a hand sign, and they walk inside the house.\n\n\nAkif sits on the big couch while Berat and G\u00fcnsal sit on the chairs. Ak\u00e7elik and Kaan sits on the floor.\n\n\nAkif:\n \n( Points to Berat )\n Did I allow you to record me?\n\n\nBerat:\n I\u2026 uhh..\n\n\nAkif:\n You can record but ask for people's permission next time.\n\n\nAkif:\n I'll get straight to the point. I was not sure at the first, but the storm made it certain. I don't where you guys found it, but the thing you are carrying with you is a curse\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n What kind of curse?\n\n\nAkif:\n Like 30 years ago, when I was at your age, a group of foreign armed people came here with helicopters. I have 0 idea how they were able the cross the Turkiye's lines. Anyways, when I asked them who they are, they didn't tell me anything about it. They were not carrying any logo or emblem but I was able to see a logo inside of the one of their helicopters. I don't remember it so much but it had English words like \" Should, Intermittent and Plague.\"\n\n\nKaan:\n I never heard about an armed group with this kind of logo.\n\n\nAkif:\n \n( After giving Kaan a wrong look )\n I say they were somehow able to enter Turkiye without government knowing and you say you never heard about them.\n\n\nAkif:\n Anyways, those men stayed here only for 5 hours. They took a fully black corpse out of their helicoper. Sound familiar?\n\n\nGroup members look at each other.\n\n\nAkif:\n They told us it was the heart of winter. It would help us to live prosperously in winter. We are ignorant people and at that time there was a harsh winter. We had no option but accept it. After the strangers gave us the heart of winter, they left without wasting any time.\n\n\nAkif:\n But at that night, a snowstorm occured. It was a kind I've never seen before. There was no cloud but completely dark. Only in one night, snow length was at above our knees. And the coldness\u2026 It was worse than a knife. Second night, another was here, snow was above 1.7 meters and it was the time when we understood we were deceived.\n\n\nAkif\n Government often forget we exist. So, no one came to help us. We had to take care of ourselves and we knew the solution.\n\n\nAkif:\n We set the heart of winter on fire. The bastard started struggling like crazy. It kept burning for hours and in the end, it sank into snow and we thought it perished and started celebrating. But when I went to my bed, it was there , pointing its hand to the cassette. I picked up and listened it. It only said:\n\n\n'' You can't kill cold.''\n\n\nAnd after that, I picked it up and went to my car with it. The fire we made was pretty huge so roads were opened enough for a car passing. I drove my car for kilometers and stopped at middle of nowhere. I left it there and came back and I almost died because of the icy way. After that, snowstorms were over. And about 2-3 days after, we saw helicopters above the village. We thought government was here but it was the armed group. They didn't land this time and moved away.\n\n\nAkif:\n So, I have only one word for you: Go. Put it back where you found it. You didn't know what was it but now, you know. It is not heart of winter. It is the soul of cold and night. It's a fallen god, maybe. Take it back to its rest, away from my village and my people. //( Stands up.) //\n\n\nOtherwise, I will [REDACTED].\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-07\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nThe recording starts at a different village, which is smaller than the last one, in a car. Half of the window is covered with snow and it is still snowing rapidly.\n\n\nBerat is on the backseat, along with Kaan. G\u00fcnsal is on the driver seat while Ak\u00e7elik is on front seat.

AK\u00c7EL\u0130K, G\u00dcNSAL WAKE UP!\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal quickly wakes up and tries to open the door but snow layer has reached to the car's door. Snow starts to fall inside the car. G\u00fcnsal closes the door.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n What time is it?\n\n\nBerat:\n 9 P.M.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Old man told us that snowstorms only happen during 3\u00a0A.M, liar bastard.\n\n\nKaan:\n Can you start the car?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Even I do, we can't go anywhere. \n( Turns to Ak\u00e7elik. )\n How does this bastard still sleep? \n( Hits him. )\n Wake up you sleepy fuck, maybe you have one of your genius ideas.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n \n( Dizzy )\n What? \n( Looks out the window. )\n Oh god. I've seen this in my dream.\n\n\nKaan:\n What will we do?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n We will go to the village and ask for their help as poor stranded guys. Car and cold dude will stay here.\n\n\nEveryone opens their door hardly and when they are outside, it is seen that the length of snow is above belly level. Sky is complete darkness and there is a fog.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \n( Holding a flashlight )\n \n( Yells )\n FOLLOW ME. THIS WAY.\n\n\nAfter a long walk, they arrive in a medium house. Ak\u00e7elik knocks the door. An elderly woman, wearing a hijab opens the door.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Good evening, teyze\n3\n. Our car has stopped working. Can we stay at here for one night?\n\n\nElder woman:\n Of course, my child. Quick, get in. I have hot soup for you.\n\n\nGroup thanks her, they shake off their snow and enter the house.\n/\n\n\nThe house is a typical Turkish village house. Woman takes them to living room, which has a fireplace. Group sits on the big couch while woman sits on the armchair.\n\n\nWoman:\n \n( Asking to G\u00fcnsal )\n What are your names, my child?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n My name is Gunsal, teyze. And these are Berat, Kaan and Ak\u00e7elik. What's your name?\n\n\nWoman:\n Fatma. You sit here and warm up. I will bring you soup. Then we can talk. \n( Stands up and goes. )\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Stands up and he sits in front of the fireplace. )\n Damn, my hands are still numb. How we are going to leave?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n \n( Looks out from window. )\n It is still snowing. I can't even see the car. I think we will-\n\n\n( A tall young beautiful woman with black hair and blue eyes enters the room. She is not wearing a headscarf. )\n\n\nYoung woman:\n Welcome to our home. Snowstorm outside is really harsh, we've never seen like this befoe. \n( She looks at Berat sitting on the ground. )\n Looks like you're very cold.\n\n\nBerat:\n I\u2026 uhh\u2026 yeah\u2026 I-it's c-cold outside-\n\n\nFatma comes in with steaming 4 bowls of soup.\n\n\nFatma:\n Oh, Defne did you meet with our guests? Come help me.\n\n\nDefne goes to another room and comes with a table. Fatma puts soups on the table.\n\n\nFatma:\n Come lads and drink some.\n\n\nGroup sits on the chair again starts drinking the soup. Defne sits in the seat of Berat's left.\n\n\nDefne:\n Where are you from and what are you doing here?\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n We are just regular people. We were returning from ski but we were all exhausted because we set off in the evening and didn't sleep at all the night before. So we parked our car 2-3 kilometers away from here and started sleeping inside. And when we woke up, we couldn't even start the engine so we left the car and came here.\n\n\nFatma:\n For my 70 years of life, I've never seen such snowstorm. May god help us.\n\n\nFatma:\n Directly opposite this house is my other flat. You can sleep there. You won't fit in here.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n God bless you, teyze.\n\n\nFatma:\n You too, my child.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Points to Berat )\n You.. uhh. what is your name?\n\n\nBerat:\n Me? B-Berat.\n\n\nDefne:\n What's the thing on your head?\n\n\nBerat:\n This? Oh, it's just my camera but it's not recording right now.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Looks confused )\n Ohh, I get it.\n\n\nGroup finishes their soups and Fatma gives them the key of the house. While they are wearing their boots Defne gives a pot of soup and 5 breads in a bag to Berat.\n\n\nDefne:\n I hope these will be enough for the night.\n\n\nBerat:\n It is more than sufficient. Thank you so much.\n\n\nDefne:\n There are enough wood and coal for fireplace at house. You can find them in the closet at basement. I can come with you if you think you can't find it.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n No, no. We can find it. Thank you again.\n\n\nFatma:\n In the morning, we will have breakfast together. If you need anything else, you can come here.\n\n\nThey all express their thanks and go outside. Snowfall has slowed down and the snow height is approximately 1.6 meters.\n\n\nThe other house is right across from them. They get there after a 3-minute walk. G\u00fcnsal opens the door.\n\n\nThis house is much smaller than the last one with 1 living room, 1 room, 1 kitchen, 1 bathroom and a stairs going down.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Guys, I have an idea.\n\n\nKaan:\n What is it, genius?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n The storm is almost over. I say we open the road, drop the guy here and just escape. Muhtar was wrong about storm times so if we carry him with us, we can get caught in a snowstorm at middle of nowhere.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n I\u2026 I don't know. These people help us and you offer us to kill them cruelly.\n\n\nKaan:\n G\u00fcnsal, I'm sorry but it seems we have no other choice. Tomorrow there will be another snowstorm and we may get stuck here forever.\n\n\nBerat:\n What will happen to Defne and Fatma teyze? They helped us with their heart and now we will leave them behind for dying?\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n We have nothing to do.\n\n\nNo action for 5 minutes.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Sorry, Berat. They are right. I thought we would warn the villagers but if they find out about the man, everything will be fucked up. I know you fell in love with Defne, I'm sorry.\n\n\nBerat:\n What? No. I.. j-just.. she- she\n\n\nKaan:\n Holy shit you blush like a tomato.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n Berat, I can ask for Defne to come here while we clean the roads. You can fuck her before we go.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik, Kaan and G\u00fcnsal laughs. Berat doesn't.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n Let's rest a little bit and then we will set off\n\n\nBerat and Kaan goes down to stairs. Basement is a small but tall room. Mentioned closet is in front of the stairs.\n\n\nBerat:\n There should be another way. This is not fair.\n\n\nKaan:\n There is no another way.

There is a back door here. We can leave without Defne and teyze seeing us.\n\n\nThe leave the lights on and go outside from the back door.\n\n\nSnowfall is completely stopped but the sky is same with addition to several ravens.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n This way.\n\n\n[LOW BATTERY POWER]\n\n\nWhen they arrive in the car's location, they see it is completely covered with snow.

Then, we can move.\n\n\nThey spend almost 1 hour for removing the snow.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n \n( Leans on the shovel. )\n We are not dying today, boys.\n\n\nKaan:\n I knew we were going to make it.\n\n\nAk\u00e7elik:\n \n( To G\u00fcnsal )\n Come on, start the engine and let's fucking go from here .\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal opens the driver door.\n\n\nSCP-7135 is sitting inside, pointing its hand to SCP-7135-01 once again.\n\n\nG\u00fcnsal:\n FUCKING HELL. \n( Kicks the SCP-7135 )\n YOU PIECE OF SHIT.\n\n\nKaan:\n Wait.

I hope you guys slept good- \nShe pauses.\n Seems like you didn't, huh? \n( Laugh )\n\n\nBerat:\n Uhh, yeah. I didn't sleep well. Listen, Ms. Defne. I need to tell you something very important. Please shut the door and come inside.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Looks behind her )\n Uhh okay. \n( Enters the house. )\n Where are the others?\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Closes the door. )\n They are gone.\n\n\nDefne:\n What? How? The snow was in the length of a child. Muhtar started shoveling operations just 2 hours ago.\n\n\nBerat:\n This storm was not a random thing. I'm cursed.\n\n\nDefne:\n What do you mean? I'm so confused.\n\n\nBerat:\n When we were sleeping, I woke up because of a nightmare. I went to get some water but then, I saw a thing in the kitchen. It was looking like a human but it had no mouth but white glowing eyes and it was as dark as a starless night-\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Angry )\n Look these are all bullshit. Tell me the truth.\n\n\nBerat:\n Follow me and I will show you.\n\n\nThey go to basemet.\n\n\nDefne:\n God help me. \n( Reads Islamic prayers. )\n Is this a demon?\n\n\nBerat:\n Kinda. It damned us with snowstorms which will happen every night and told me if I leave from here, it will kill the whole village. My friends went to Erzurum for bringing help but they might not return. We must be prepared for the upcoming snowstroms.\n\n\nDefne:\n There is a telephone in our house. It's pretty old stuff, but it works.\n\n\nBerat:\n Phones do not work, even my smart phone because of the last night. We must storage wood and coal as much as possible. Next storm will be much severe than the last one.\n\n\nBerat:\n You need to warn them, Ms. Defne. They will trust you.\n\n\nDefne:\n What will I say to them?\n\n\nBerat:\n Tell them everything I told you. If they see it, they will be much ready for the survival.\n\n\nDefne:\n Okay, I will do it. I'm going to Muhtar, wait here.\n\n\n[FAST FORWARD THE RECORDING FOR 20 MINUTES]\n\n\nDoorknocks are heard.\n\n\nBerat opens the door. Defne appears with a short, bald, fully bearded man in his 40s.\n\n\nDefne:\n Berat, this is Muhtar Ayhan. I told him everything and he will see your thing.\n\n\nBerat:\n Nice to meet you, I'm Berat.\n\n\nAyhan:\n Where is it? If I sense you are wasting my time, I will make you regret.\n\n\nBerat:\n Here, follow me.\n\n\nThey arrive in the basement once again.\n\n\nAyhan:\n \n( Confused visibly )\n Bismilahirrahmanirrahim\n4\n. This is a demon. We must ask for the Imam \u0130brahim's help.\n\n\nBerat:\n It won't be useful. This thing knows no god.\n\n\nAyhan:\n Why don't you and him leave from here, if he is going to follow you?\n\n\nBerat:\n* I-uh can't do that. He will return here if I carry him outside. Anyways, this should not be our concern. Talk to your people and command them in order to prepare for the storm.\n\n\nAyhan:\n I will first bring the Imam here. He should know some prays.\n\n\nBerat:\n Do what you want. But, please, warn the people.\n\n\nAyhan:\n I will. \nGoes up the stairs, leaving Berat and Defne alone in the basement.\n\n\nDefne is a tall woman but shorter than Berat, approximately 5\u00a0cm.\n\n\nDefne:\n I should leave too-\n\n\nBerat:\n Wait, we never had chance of talking.\n\n\nDefne:\n About what?\n\n\nBerat:\n Like your age. I could not guess it but you look like you are 23.\n\n\nDefne:\n You are pretty close. I'm 25. What about you?\n\n\nBerat:\n I'm so old. 32.\n\n\nDefne:\n You look way younger than that.\n\n\nBerat:\n Would it surprise you if I told you that I was born in village?\n\n\nDefne:\n Why should it surprise me?

My name is Berat. I'm just a passenger who was passing from here with my friends. But we get caught in the storm last night so we had to take a rest here. And, we learnt thet these storm was not a random event.\n\n\nImam \u0130brahim and Muhtar Ayhan knows the truth but only thing you should know is that there will be more snowstorms like yesterday, even tougher. My friends went to Erzurum to bring help.\n\n\nAyhan:\n Mr. Berat is right. There was never a storm like the one that happened yesterday, so-\n\n\nA woman:\n Why doesn't Imam \u0130brahim pray for us? Allah will save us.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n We should take precautions first and then pray to Allah. He won't help those who lazy.\n\n\nAyhan:\n That's right. So, we have a plan. Including the Imam's and mine, we have 5 cars in total. Car owners will take as much as old women and children they can with them to get them to Erzurum and ask for help. Me and Imam will give our cars to others and stay here. You will them that how the storm yesterday was destructive. Our limited phones are not functioning.\n\n\nA child:\n How do you know there will be other storms?\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Look up, Taha. This is a warning by Allah. Blizzard yesterday was also a warning. Allah chooses his most loyal servants to test.\n\n\nA man:\n Oh that's right. Allah will finally punish us for our sins.\n\n\nA girl:\n Mom, I don't want to get punished. \n( Starts crying. )\n\n\nAyhan:\n Don't cry, my child. This is just a warning. If Allah would have wanted to punish us, he would do it already.\n\n\nPeople start to talk different things in unison.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n After cars leave, \n( The noise stops ))\n we will go into forest and collect wood. Everyone will work. Our food is sufficent for now but we need to use it carefully.

It looks like evening. There are woods in a bag on the floor. Berat takes a wood and throws at the fireplace. Defne and Fatma wear winter coats.\n\n\nDefne:\n Phone is still not working.\n\n\nBerat:\n I told you it won't. My smart phone is not functioning at all.\n\n\nBerat:\n My friends have not returned.\n\n\nFatma:\n Give them some time. Driving in this weather is risky.

I went to Erzurum 3 times and its size fascinated me.\n\n\nDefne:\n Mom, when will I go to city?\n\n\nFatma:\n When you are married and if your husband wants to. Allah knows when you will marry, though.\n\n\nDefne:\n I won't marry with someone I don't love. I-\n\n\nFatma:\n Shh, shut up kid. Our guest had enough of your bulshit. Yes Berat, city life.\n\n\nBerat:\n Well, what do you want to learn?\n\n\nFatma:\n Like, are they hot and warm?\n\n\nBerat:\n It depends on the city you go. Erzurum is not that hot but \u0130stanbul and Ankara are. But- \n( Pauses )\n\nDid you hear that?\n\n\nWinds sounds are heard clearly.\n\n\nBerat:\n It begins.\n\n\nDefne:\n Can we throw more wood into fire? It's so cold.\n\n\nFatma:\n This wood is the only one we will have this night.\n\n\nBerat:\n You sleep and rest. I will watch the fire.\n\n\nDefne and Fatma get into beds on the floor opposite the fireplace.\n\n\nBerat throws two more woods at fire. Events continue like this for an hour or two.\n\n\nBerat stands up and starts watching Defne. He, then, leaves from the room and goes outside.\n\n\nSnow is falling at a very high rate. The sky is dark and filled with ravens. Fog makes it difficult to see 100 meters ahead. The winds shake the leaves of the trees harshly.\n\n\nBerat starts walking towards the other house across the street. Since the snow from the last storm has been shoveled, the current snow length is not higher than 1 meter.\n\n\nBerat unlocks the lock with the key and enters the house that Fatma has allocated for him and his friends. After, Berat goes down the stairs.\n\n\nIn the basement, there is a long wooden coffin there that was not there before. There are prayers written in Arabic on it. Berat opens its lid.\n\n\nSCP-7135 is inside of the coffin. Its eyes are much brighter than before.\n\n\nBerat closes the lid again.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Sighs )\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-11\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Crying )\n She was all okay just yesterday.\n\n\nThe recording starts in the house of Fatma.

Defne weakly tries to resist.\n\n\nDefne:\n Ah.. no.. don't do it\u2026 this is haram- ahhhhh\u2026\n\n\nBerat:\n \nHe turns back Defne, bends her over and pulls down the girl's pants and underwear.\n Are you virgin?\n\n\nDefne:\n Yes.. Berat please-\n\n\nBerat:\n Even better.\n\n\n[FAST FORWARD THE RECORDING BY 30 MINUTES]\n\n\nDefne appears to be sleeping next to her mother's body. She is wearing her winter clothes and coat again. Berat stands up from the chair he's been sitting and goes to main doorway. Shovels Defne brought are stii here. Berat picks one of them and opens the door. He inserts the shovel into the snow wall.\n\n\nA small way is opened but the top of the layer remains.\n\n\nBerat keeps digging for a while and top section collapses. Berat sees the length of the undigged snow walls are at almost 3 meters.\n\n\nBerat looks up and sees the cloudless sky with ravens flying. Other than that, there is only snow.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Yelling )\n CAN ANYONE HEAR MY VOICE? HELLO?

It was so loud that I geniunely concerned.\n\n\nBerat:\n Uhhh.. Fatma Teyze. She's gone.\n\n\nAyhan:\n Oh my god. May she rest in paradise. She was a kind soul.\n\n\nBerat:\n Amen. So, where is the tractor.\n\n\nAyhan:\n \n( Points to his right )\n This way.\n\n\nThey start to dig the wall through. As they progress, snow walls collapse.\n\n\nThey arrive to the location of tractor after 25 minutes.\n\n\nAyhan:\n I have the keys. I hope I can stat the engine.\n\n\nThey remove the snow layer surrounding the tractor.\n\n\nAyhan gets inside of the tractor.\n\n\nTractor does not work at first.\n\n\nAyhan:\n Come on.\n\n\nTractor does not work.\n\n\nAyhan:\n God help me.\n\n\nTractor does not work.\n\n\nBerat:\n I guess it won't start-\n\n\nTractor works.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Laughs slightly )\n Nice.

I will pray Allah to forgive him.\n\n\nBerat:\n Amen.\n\n\nBerat He turns around and opens the door. A tunnel made through snow layer appears.\n\n\nBerat:\n So, how much people left?\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Ayhan was the 22nd of those who died today. This means there are only 61 alive people remaining. I don't understand. Most of these people still have food and most of them were pretty healthy.\n\n\nBerat:\n It's the cold killing them, not hunger. \n( Pauses )\n Wait. What about the farm animals you guys have?\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n They all perished probably. The farm is away 200 meters from here.\n\n\nBerat:\n Let's check the meeting point.\n\n\nThey take a left and walk straight. They arrive in a a wide point where 4 different tunnels meet.\n\n\nThere is no one there except a few corpses.\n\n\nBerat:\n Come on Defne, help me.\n\n\nBerat and Defne start carrying a corpse of a large man. \u0130brahim stays behind. They go through houses and finally arrive in the house of Fatma. They enter inside and drop the body in front of the fire place. Human bones are seperated everywhere.\n\n\nEven though they are inside the house, smoke is rising from their mouths.\n\n\nDefne:\n His name was Mahmut. He was a good mand a farmer. He was so strong that he could lift me only with his one hand. It's strange that the cold took him.\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah. Let's get into work.\n\n\nBerat gets two knives from the kitchen and gives one to Defne. He firstly, removes the clothes of Mahmut. Then, he starts peeling the skin of Mahmut's right arm. Defne does same to the left arm. After this is done, they remove the arms from body.\n\n\nDefne takes arm pieces and goes to kitchen. Berat removes the chest part from legs and begins to remove his internal organs such as heart and liver. After he's done, He takes a handful of coal from the bag next to him and places it in the fireplace. Then he lights the fireplace with the newspaper and some of the remaining wood. A loud fire begins to burn. Defne comes with a big pot filled with arm parts. She puts the pot above the fire.\n\n\nDefne:\n A lot of food was stored before winter. The amount for my mother and me was very small.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Nods )\n No one wants to share their food. I don't blame them. At least they give their dead to us.\n\n\nDefne:\n We have no wood in the attic anymore.\n\n\nDefne:\n Are we the only people eating bodies in the village?\n\n\nBerat:\n Probably. \u0130brahim had said other people who ran out of food ate mice, but they vehemently refused to eat the dead.\n\n\nDefne:\n I would also say the same thing 2 days ago.\n\n\nBerat::\n Actually we can survive without food for like 15-20 days I guess. But, this cold makes us weak. After every night, I feel stiff everywhere and I literally feel like I've been through a war and I feel so hungry.\n\n\nDefne:\n Yeah, me too. Every night it gets colder than the last one. I wonder how long the snow is?\n\n\nBerat:\n It should be over 6 meters. We are completely burried under. Last night \u0130brahim said it was because of us. He said we have incurred the wrath of Allah. I told him to shut the fuck and asked why Allah doesn't help him. He was silent.\n\n\nDefne:\n I wonder how Imam \u0130brahim still thinks there is a god.\n\n\nBerat:\n Some people's belief is just that strong.\n\n\nDefne:\n They are just stupid. What kind of god throw his people into a cold hell and make them to their own dead?\n\n\nBerat:\n You are right. Allah is a lie. Ibrahim actually is aware of this but does not want to see the truth since this is one of the basics of his life.\n\n\nDefne stands up and takes the Kaaba picture and the painting with Islamic prayers on the wall and throws it into the fireplace. Then, she goes to another room and returns with bunch of Qurans. She throws all of them intor fire. Firepcae starts to burn stronger.\n\n\nDefne:\n This will warm us.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Laughs )\n\n\nDefne:\n You know we have no chance of surviving,\n\nright? Everyone outside forgot about us.\n\n\nBerat:\n I know.\n\n\nDefne:\n I don't know about you but I want to live the limited days of my life in pleasure. We are god forgetten and cursed people. So let's fuck everything and make love in our living room surrounded by human bones while corpses burn in our fireplace.\n\n\nBerat:\n Actually, yes, you are the right one. I was thinking that there is still hope for us but boy, I was wrong.\n\n\nDefne:\n Uhh so.. uhh \n( Blushes )\n Can you do the thing.. you didd last time?

Ahhh!\n\n\nSuddenly door opens loudly and Imam \u0130brahim enters the house. Berat and Defne stand up quickly.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n \n( Comes running inside the living room)\n Berat, Defne! There is a man- \n(Suddenly stops )\n Oh God help me. What are you doing? \n( He turns his gaze elsewhere. )\n\n\nDefne runs to the kitchen. \u0130brahim secretly looks at Defne's breasts. Berat turns around and buttons his trousers.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n As if all this is not enough, are you also committing adultery now? \n( He looks around and grimaces.\n ) This place smells horrible.\n\n\n( \u0130brahim is a short but large man. He has a long gray beard that reaches down to his chest.\n\n\nBerat:\n This is our private. It's none of your business what we do. Entering a house without permission is probably not something Allah likes.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Yeah, yeah whatever. Something really important happened. Voices of cars and people come from outside the village.\n\n\nBerat:\n What? Really?\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Yeah. There was only one male voice. I got as close as I could and told him we were stranded here. He said there was two tractor at a nearby oil depot and went there. The snow height was more than 5 meters, but it could still be cleared.\n\n\nBerat:\n This is so good. I think we will really be saved.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Yes. I told you Allah didn't forget us. The tractor may arrive at any time, so stay at home and don't go out.\n\n\nBerat:\n Okay.\n\n\n\u0130brahim leaves and after 2 minutes Defne comes inside. She covered herself now.\n\n\nDefne:\n What happened?\n\n\nBerat:\n A man was coming here with 2 tractors. I think we survived.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( He eyes widen )\n Oh really? I had prepared myself so much for death that\u2026\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( He holds Defne on her cheeks and kisses her for a long time. )\n If we get out of here, will you marry me? I will make you live like a queen.\n\n\nDefne:\n Let's get out of here and the rest is easy.\n\n\n[FAST FORWARD THE RECORDING THREE HOURS]\n\n\nDoor is knocked.\n\n\nDefne is sleeping in bed in front of the fire. Berat is sitting in the chair. Berat gets up and goes to open the door.\n\n\nBerat:\n Wow. I can't believe you knocked this time.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Things are bad. The guy I mentioned haven not returned yet.\n\n\nBerat:\n Give him time until nightfall.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Yeah yeah but what will we do if he does not return? Another storm would very likely destroy the village.\n\n\nBerat:\n Pray.\n\n\n[LOW BATTERY POWER]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nVideo-Recording-13\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nThe recording starts at the village square. The snow extending from the entrance road of the village to the center seems to have been cleared. It's post noon time. The sky is clear blue and the ravens are there again.\n\n\nThere are around 70-80 villagers in the square. Berat is standing on the high dais with \u0130brahim and two foreign men who are apparently not from the village.\n\n\nThe men are both in their 30s and wearing full winter clothing. One is taller than the other.\n\n\nTall Man:\n Are we ready?\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, I'm recording. Please contiune.\n\n\nTall Man:\n Alright. My name is Yi\u011fit [REDACTED]. I actually live and work in [REDACTED] Village but, my mother and sister live in here.\n\n\nA couple days ago A Tofa\u015f \u015eahin brand car came to village. He almost crashed into a building. He was alone and his car was damaged badly. He told us that a giant snowstorm happened in the G\u00f6k\u00e7edere. Snow length had reached about 30 meters, he said.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n We actually sent him along with 4 cars before the second snowstorm. Snow length at that time was not even 1.5 meters.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n \n( Nods )\n No one believed the guy but I wanted to check it myself since my mother and sister was living there. So I hopped into my car alone and set off. When I approached the village, 200 meters from the center was covered with at least 5 meters of snow. I couldn't proceed further because it was surrounded by mountainous terrain and the road to the village was closed.\n\n\nWhile I was on my way, I saw two tractors in an oil field not far from Bue. When I went back and asked the owner for him, the dishonorable man did not accept.\n\n\nThen I tried to reach AFAD\n5\n on my phone. But it did not work strangely. So I returned to [REDACTED] and told the things I saw. We set off from there with 3 minibuses, 2 tractors, 2 snow plows and 1 car carrying food but on the way, one of the minibuses got stuck on the road so were late. And when we have arrived in midnight, snow length was still same, even decreased.\n\n\nBerat:\n That's because for the last 2 days, there wasn't any blizzards.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n It took our whole night to reach here but we, in the end, finally here. And now we will take pictures and take the surviving ones with us to Erzurum.\n\n\nBerat:\n Can you tell us about the cold?\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n I've never seen like that before. It's not that freezing but it falls on you. Since I came here, I feel hunger and tiredness.\n\n\nBerat:\n Okay thank you.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Is is done?\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Oh good. This is be a good interview that will be published.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n So, how many alive villagers we have right now?\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n 78. This was a huge disaster.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n I want to see my mother's resting place before we place.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n \n( Nervous )\n Yeah. I will show you.\n\n\nShort Man:\n \n( To villagers )\n Are there anyone who is not ready?\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Okay, then. Please proceed into minibuses.\n\n\nVillagers slowly start to get into minibuses.\n\n\nBerat:\n Mr. Yi\u011fit, can I request something from you?\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n\nBerat:\n I need your car for something really important. I need to stop by a village opposite the center. It's super personal. Please, do not withhold this favor from me.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n \n( Confused )\n Uhh, yeah. Okay. \n( Gives the keys )\n\n\nBerat:\n Thank you very much.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Please take me to my mother, Imam.\n\n\n\u0130brahim:\n Yeah. Follow me, please.\n\n\nAs they leave and villagers get into the minibusses, Berat goes to Fatma's house. He knocks the door.\n\n\nDefne opens the door.\n\n\nBerat:\n Are you ready?\n\n\nDefne:\n Yeah I am. I only took my important things.\n\n\nBerat:\n Do you have a place to stay in the city?\n\n\nDefne:\n Yeah. I will stay with my other brother.\n\n\nBerat:\n You had told me that all of your brothers were living in the city.\n\n\nDefne:\n Yi\u011fit lives both in Erzurum and villages. He visits a village every year and stays there for a while, because of his work.\n\n\nBerat:\n Oh, I understand.\n\n\nDefne:\n Berat, I was thinking\u2026 The things we did\u2026 I'm in so much regret\u2026 I was sad and angry because I thought Allah had forgotten us. Looks like he didn't.\n\n\nBerat:\n Look, \n( olds her by the shoulders )\n we were mad. All things we did\u2026 were horrible, yes. We did because it was a terrible disaster. But now you are saved and you are going to Erzurum in safety.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Confused )\n Me? You are not coming?\n\n\nBerat:\n Not for now. I have to do something.\n\n\nDefne:\n Do what?\n\n\nBerat:\n I must take him to where he belongs.\n\n\nDefne:\n I'm coming with you.\n\n\nBerat:\n No.\n\n\nDefne:\n Yes.\n\n\nBerat:\n Your brother won't allow it, however.\n\n\nDefne:\n Ahh leave him to me.\n\n\n[FAST FORWARD THE RECORDING BY ONE HOUR]\n\n\nIt's afternoon and two minibusses had left. \u0130brahim and They are standing in front of the last remaining minibus. Berat and Defne are also in front of them.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Defne, are you sure?\n\n\nDefne:\n Yes, brother.\n\n\nYi\u011fit:\n Well, be careful.\n\n\nGets in the minibus. Ibrahim lingers.\n\n\nIbrahim:\n Your secrets will be safe with me. Goodbye.\n\n\nBerat\n Thank you.\n\n\nAs the minibus moves towards the lowering sun, Berat and Defne watch it go.\n\n\nDefne:\n We are all alone.\n\n\nBerat:\n Do you want to make out in mosque?\n\n\nDefne:\n Nah, I'm again a Muslim.\n\n\nBerat:\n Ahh.\n\n\nBerat:\n How did you persuade your brother?\n\n\nDefne:\n I told him I'm going to marry you. He vehemently opposed at first but then I told your real identity and he suddenly became okay with it.\n\n\nBerat:\nThis seems to be the reason for the sudden change in his behavior.\n\n\nDefne:\n Anyway, this village is seems so spooky right now. Let's go.\n\n\nThey get into the car of Yi\u011fit. It's a Hundai Accent Era.\n\n\nBerat parks the car in front of Fatma's other house. They get out of the car and enter the house. After they go down to the basement, Berat removes the lib of the coffin.\n\n\nSCP-7135 is inside, with its hand pointed to the SCP-7135-01. Eyes are glowing.\n\n\nBerat:\n Oh, he has something to say.\n\n\nDefne:\n Can he talk?\n\n\nBerat:\n Yeah, via that cassette. \n( Berat takes the SCP-7135-01.\n ) Can you give the tape-player that is inside the closet?\n\n\nDefne:\n Here. \n( Passes the player )\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Puts the SCP-7135-01 inside ans starts playing it. )\n\n\nSCP-7135-01:\n ( \nAgain the same sounds, but this time there are also human screams. )\n Well\u2026 done\u2026 Berat\u2026 You\u2026\u2026 liar\u2026 You\u2026 belong\u2026to\u2026 cold\u2026\n\n\nRecording stops. SCP-7135-01 gets drawn to SCP-7135's chest.\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Clearly scared. )\n\n\nBerat:\n Don't be scared. These are just bullshit.\n\n\nDefne:\n Yeah, but I don't know.\n\n\nBerat:\n Come on let's go.\n\n\nThey remove SCP-7135 from the coffin and they start to carry it through stairs.\n\n\nDefne:\n He's so cold.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( Humming )\n This was how everything begun..\n\n\nDefne:\n What?\n\n\nBerat:\n Nothing.\n\n\nWhen they climb the stairs they see the sunlight entering is gone and the house is dark.\n\n\nBerat:\n Oh, god no, no.\n\n\nBerat releases SCP-7135 and quickly opens the main door.\n\n\nIt is snowing outside, harder than rain. The sky is pitch black and the ravens are there again. The length of the snow had reached the knee.\n\n\nDefne:\n BERAT WE CAN STILL LEAVE- Berat?\n\n\nBerat falls to his knees at the entrance of the house and starts laughing psychopathically.\n\n\nBerat:\n Don't you see, Defne? The car is gone. \n( Laughs )\n\n\nDefne:\n \n( Doesn't says anything and goes to the main room slowly.\n)\n\n\nThe recording ends as Berat continues to laugh like maniacly and the snow continues to accelerate.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/11/2023\n\n\n\n\nDAMAGED RECORDING\n\n\nWARNING:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nThe recording starts.\n\n\nDefne is lying on the floor, dead and naked.\n\n\nThere are bite marks on her breasts and vagina.\n\n\nHer skin looks pale, almost gray.\n\n\nThe fireplace is not burning, the house is gray and dark. Completely silent.\n\n\nBerat:\n \n( His voice is thick from disuse and he stutters constantly. )\n I-I-I no-no, My-my na-name is Be-berat. I-I'm s-stuck here. O-only s-snow.

Warm.\n\n\nA knife appears in Berat's right hand. He firstly caresses Defne's breasts. After that, [REDACTED]. After he's done, he inserts the knife into Defne's right breast and some blood gushes out from that spot. Some of the blood comes to the camera and covers the top of the image. Later, Berat proceedes to cut Defne's chest with the knife. He reaches the heart at the end and takes it out and comes out to his mouth in one bite. As bloody morsels pour out of Berat's mouth, he bursts into hysterical laughter.\n\n\nBerat:\n Her last words were \" I love you.\"\n\n\nBerat brings the knife to Defne's vagina and inserts it from there. The image quality drops significantly and plain static appears again.\n\n\nThe door opening sound is heard.\n\n\nBerat raises his head and looks at the door. SCP-7135 stands in the doorway with a raven perched on its shoulder. Its eyes are so bright that most of its face is floating in a chamber of light and house is pretty illuminated.\n\n\nThe raven on its shoulder has no eyes and its head twitches strangely.\n\n\nBerat:\n Are you here to finish me off?\n\n\nSCP-7135 does not respond and move.\n\n\nBerat:\n Y-\n\n\nThe raven on SCP-7135's shoulder crows loudly and lunges towards Berat's face. Berat raises his hands to protect himself, but the bird knocks him to the ground. As Berat falls, the knife stays in Defne's vagina. The raven pecks Berat's face for a while, but then flies away and disappears into one of the side rooms.\n\n\nBerat gets up from the ground and SCP-7135 is seen to be gone. The door is also closed.\n\n\nBerat pulls the knife out of Defne's vagina. Then he tries to stand up. On the first try, he stumbles and falls on Defne's corpse. On the second try he gets up and goes to kitchen while staggering. No one is in the kitchen. While he is facing away, the room suddenly lights up. Berat quickly turns around, but no one is there. Meanwhile, the raven comes from behind again and hits the back of his neck. As soon as Berat falls to the ground, it takes off again. This time, Berat does not manage to stand up. After lying there on his back for a while, he crawls to the room where Defne's body is.Finally, he stands next to Defne, lying down with his head towards Defne's vagina.\n\n\nThe knife is still in his hand. He lifts it and brings it to his neck. His hands are shaking violently. Finally, he raises the knife and begins to cry loudly.\n\n\nAn hour passes like this.\n\n\nBerat gets into a sitting position again and turns Defne over. [REDACTED]\n\n\nBerat rolls to the side and the camera is again attacked by a stronger static effect. Berat turns his head to the door again and sees at least 20 ravens gathered there. Berat turns his head towards Defne's corpse lying next to him.\n\n\nDefne's body is not here, and SCP-7135 lies where she used to be. The camera stops functioning after a sound assumed to be Berat's scream heard.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Defne \u2588\u2588\u2588 was reported as missing, Erzurum Government arrived in G\u00fczeldurak and they had encountered with snow in the length of 20 meters covering the entire village. This incident attracted the attention of local media and it did not take long for it to spread to global media. The Turkish Government failed to enter the village. Through global media, the SCP Foundation became aware of the events. With the help of snow heights and ravens flying in clear skies in news footage and since its previous containment data was still in the foundation database, SCP-7135's location has been determined as G\u00fczeldurak. A secret meeting was held with the Turkish President after the necessary agreements were signed and the necessary protocols were complied with, an MTF Delta-14 unit was deployed in G\u00fczeldurak after the area was completely evacuated by the Turkish Government.\n\n\nOn December 17, 2023, 16 days after the MTF unit's deployment, SCP-7135 was found beneath the lifted snowpack. Body of the Defne \u2588\u2588\u2588 was found with the camera device that Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 used to record the events. Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's complete body was not found, only the skeleton. He was under the snow layer with SCP-7135. The MTF unit transported SCP-7135 to Site-88 as ordered, where the object was once again contained with enhanced security clearances and precautions in case of another theft attempt. SCP-7135's containment has continued ever since.\n\n\nIncluding the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT model car with the license plate \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and his friends were traveling with in the video recordings, 5 of the 6 cars sent from G\u00fczeldurak to Erzurum are missing. An investigation into whether these disappearances are related to SCP-7135 is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Show\u00a0Addendum-7135-02\n\n\n\n\n-Close\u00a0file\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the movement properties of SCP-7135, several experiments have been conducted, led by Dr. John with the assigned task force MTF Delta 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment.1.7135\n\n\nStep 1:\n SCP-7135 was transported to a hot region outside the borders of California. Object was deployed there with the sensors that determine its location.\n\n\nStep 2:\n MTF units retreated from the vision SCP-7135, leaving the object alone.\n\n\nStep 3:\n For the next five hours, sensors showed no signs of movement.\n\n\nStep 4:\n MTF units re-arrived in the location and observed SCP-7135 did not move.\n\n\nConclusion:\n \nIt looks like SCP-7135 does not tend to move when it is in a warmer location. Next experiment will be conducted in a cold place.\n\n\n- Dr. John\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment.2.7135\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\n SCP-7135 was transported to the cold and snowy region near the borders of Alaska.\n\n\nStep 2:\n MTF units retreated from the vision SCP-7135, leaving the object alone.\n\n\nStep 3:\n Within one hour, the sensors have indicated that SCP-7135's location changed in a sudden moment. While the object continued to move inconsistently, MTF units were directed to the location indicated by the sensors. However, SCP-7135 was not on the surface. The object eventually stopped moving and it turned out it was actually located under the snow.\n\n\nThe same experiment was also conducted in a different Alaska region but this time, several cameras were placed in the release location of SCP-7135. However, SCP-7135 did not move at all.\n\n\nConclusion:\n \nSCP-7135 is able to move whenever it is in a snowy cold location and while not being observed. The sensors show sudden movements of the object instead of continuous motion. This could mean that SCP-7135 has the ability to teleport under snow. We know SCP-7135 tries to follow the person who removes it from its snow layer but, since there was not a certain person took action in this, object was confused and moved inconsistent and indecisive because of it.\n\n\n-Dr. John\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment.3.7135\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\n The temperature of SCP-7135's containment chamber has been deliberately lowered.\n\n\nStep 2:\n Sensors showed that SCP-7135 attempted to move, but it failed.\n\n\nStep 3:\n After several attemptions made by SCP-7135, the anomaly gave up.\n\n\nConclusion:\n \nSCP-7135 cannot move if it is surrounded by materials it cannot penetrate.\n\n\n-Dr. John\n\n\n\n\nThere are no experiments about this issue but it is a high possibility that SCP-7135 is more in power, if the region it is in gets colder and reaches longer snow lengths. Similar examples can be observed in the video recordings taken by Berat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Show\u00a0Addendum-7135-03\n\n\n\n\n-Close\u00a0file\n\n\n\n\nWhen the snowstorms of SCP-7135 occur, the only factor that can be considered as an anomalous event is the lack of clouds. From the emergence of the first storm, the sky will maintain its cloudless state. Before the first storm, after the condition(s) of keeping SCP-7135 passive broken, firstly temperature drops considerably. In the next step, winds always blowing from the north at the speed of 14.3\u00a0m/s begin. This phase may continue for 10-15 minutes. After that, It starts to snow. Snowfall is divided into three stages: Beginning, Acceleration, and Ending.\n\n\nFollowing list indicates a whole SCP-7135 snowstorm event.\n\n\n\u2022 \nTemperature Drop:\n Temperature drops to below -25\u00b0C in the span of 45 minutes, no matter of the what current temperature is.\n\n\n\u2022 \nWinds Blow:\n \nThe above information about winds is sufficient. There is no need to elaborate it.\n\n\n\u2022 \nStage Beginning :\n Snow falls normally at this stage, but the snowflakes are visibly much larger compared to those during normal snowfall.\n\n\n\u2022 \nStage Acceleration:\n Snowfall increases 3 times the rate of the other stage with the increase of the wind speed and a fog. Stage Acceleration may take place for at least 5 hours even more.\n\n\n\u2022 \nStage Ending:\n Winds and snowfall begin the decrease their destructive properties and perish completely after 30-45 minutes. Temperature may not drop.\n\n\nEach snowstorm will be more severe and longer when compared to the last one. But, areas that storms affect will not expand. Upon ending the last storm, the length of snow may pass 20 meters. Until SCP-7135 obtains the passive state, storms will not stop from happening.\n\n\nUpon the completion of the first blizzard, a compulsive phenomenon classified as SCP-7135-A1 will emerge in the area. SCP-7135-A1 refers to a set of negative anomalous physical and mental changes that occur in the people who enter the area of storms. These effects are listed as:\n\n\n\u2022 Feeling constantly hungry,\n\n\n\u2022 Being tired, as if had done an intense physical activity,\n\n\n\u2022 Feeling of constriction. It can be associated with claustrophobia.\n\n\nSCP-7135-A1 will contiune to exist until SCP-7135 acquires the passive state.\n\n\nAfter the second snowstorm, entities classified as SCP-7135-02s will emerge above the storm area. It is unknown where they appear from. SCP-7135-02 is no different from a raven in terms of physical characteristics. However, SCP-7135-02 samples will roam around the snowstorm area all the time, without landing at all, until SCP-7135 acquires its passive stage again. An SCP-7135-02 sample does not need food or water. When captured, SCP-7135-02 will start to act like a non-anomalous raven. SCP-7135 does not seem to acknowledge the presence of SCP-7135-02s. SCP-7135-02 subjects will disappear after SCP-7135 gets into the passive stage.\n\n\nConclusion:\n Snowstorms are not considered anomalous events. The lack of clouds is an anomalous event, caused by SCP-7135. Exaggerated snow length is not an event that can be observed in nature but, it still does not have sufficient properties that can be classified as anomalous. Other than these, snowstorms having the same properties with the snowstorms of SCP-7135 can occur naturally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7135\n\" by MRKyrie, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

The entity's somber and shadowy appearance is owing to an anomalous phase of livor mortis which imparts it with a black hue and gray cracks and ruptures that expose the underlying bones. Notably, the skin on the left hand is entirely absent, leaving the hand bones entirely exposed. SCP-7135 lacks any discernible body hair and is devoid of a mouth. Its eyes are characterized by a black sclera and fully white pupil that can emit a luminosity so bright that it can be seen from 3-4 miles away at night.",
