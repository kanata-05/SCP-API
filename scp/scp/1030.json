SCP-1030-1 may request materials for self-repair by typing on this terminal. Staff are to place materials in the airlock between the observation booth and the holding cell, then vacate the airlock before SCP-1030-1 is given access to it.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances should SCP-1030-1 be given any sharp objects or potential writing utensils. Any attempt by SCP-1030-1 to draw or carve SCP-1030-2 shall result in revoking of word processor privileges until later review. Any resulting instances of SCP-1030-3 should be reverted by removal of SCP-1030-2, or, if more convenient, destroyed by fire.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1030-1 is a humanoid figure approximately 1.65m tall, constructed of various objects. As of \u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 it is composed of a pair of shoes, a computer mouse, a garbage can, 4m of rubber hose, crushed remains of a push-cart, a personal digital organizer, a labcoat, a pair of glasses, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nObjects integrated into SCP-1030-1 corrode, rot, or otherwise decompose at an accelerated rate. Heavily damaged objects are expelled and replaced by an unknown force using other nearby objects capable of roughly filling the vacated space. Objects may contort or break if necessary, but preference is given to objects requiring a minimum of effort.\n\n\nRuined items are not expelled until a replacement is found. SCP-1030-1 has expressed that keeping damaged items integrated is \"painful.\"\n\n\nThe only constant feature on SCP-1030-1 is the presence of a complex symbol (hereafter SCP-1030-2) that becomes engraved on the \u201cback\u201d of whatever analog SCP-1030-1 is using for a head. Part of the symbol includes the Hebrew word \"\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd.\"\n\n\nSCP-1030-1 expresses periodic desire to copy this symbol onto other objects. Any objects marked in this way (known as SCP-1030-3) become animate with some control by SCP-1030-1 as long as they are within \u2588m of SCP-1030-1. Beyond that range, SCP-1030-3 invariably become hostile, seeking out and attempting to harm any humans in any way possible. Removal or destruction of any portion of SCP-1030-2 reverts such items to their original, inanimate state.\n\n\nRecovery notes\n\nSCP-1030-1 was initially contained following stories of a \"monster\" near a garbage dump in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Czechoslovakia. Agents captured SCP-1030-1 on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588 using powerful magnets, as much of its body was composed of scrap metal at the time. SCP-1030-1 offered no violent resistance, attempting only to flee at first contact, and ceased its attempts after several minutes.\n\n\nAddendum 1030-01: Deviant behavior/New containment procedures\n\nSCP-1030-1 has begun attempting to place SCP-1030-2 on any object it can access, with mixed success. New containment procedures forbidding the presence of non-repair objects implemented due to extra security measures needed for animated furniture. Walls and floor are now padded fabric due to severe structural damage caused by animation of walls and floor. Computer terminal resolution and size have been reduced following input of ASCII version of SCP-1030-2 that resulted in violent animation of computer terminal.\n\n\nFollowing implementation of new containment procedures, SCP-1030-1 has ceased regular movement and refused to type on terminal except for the word \"Alone,\" once a day.\n\n\nAddendum 1030-02: Incident report\n\nFollowing initial testing on replication of SCP-1030-2, SCP-1030-1 was denied access to any objects for self-repair purposes with the aim of coercing SCP-1030-1 into explaining why the symbol wasn\u2019t effective when copied by Foundation personnel. The word processor was also removed. SCP-1030-1 was told to respond by signing letters in the air.\n\n\nAfter 22 days with no useful response, SCP-1030-1\u2019s components appeared to be in severe disrepair. After subject was observed to sit for several hours without motion, then-head researcher Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 entered the cell with a sealed metal box of debris on a push-cart (current containment procedures were not in place), stating intention to \u201ctempt\u201d SCP-1030-1.\n\n\nThe resulting video record has been preserved for study.\n\n\n\n\n<0754:13> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enters containment cell, pauses while door is sealed behind him, and shakes cart.\n\n<0754:16> SCP-1030-1 rises to \u201cfeet,\u201d immediately makes defensive or warding gestures with \u201carms.\u201d\n\n<0754:20> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 takes two steps toward SCP-1030-1 with cart, at which time Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s glasses appear to fly off his face and replace a disintegrating cardboard tube as SCP-1030-1\u2019s thumb. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 feels face, then lets go of cart and turns to door.\n\n<0754:22> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, facing door, appears to leave ground, flying backwards toward SCP-1030-1.\n\n<0754:25> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's entire body [DATA EXPUNGED] violently by an unidentified force, with no apparent regard for previous anatomical functions.\n\n<0754:30> SCP-1030-1 drops to \u201cknees\u201d and repeatedly slams own head (at the time a wastepaper bin) against back wall of containment cell for approximately 30 seconds.\n\n<0755:01> SCP-1030-1 rises, rocking its body, and begins stroking Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's head and back, currently located [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n<0858:15> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ceases movement.\n\n<0858:22> Push-cart accelerates toward SCP-1030-1, discarding box of debris. Cart is crushed and re-shaped by unknown means, replacing portions of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which are expelled onto the floor.\n\n<0858:40> Box accelerates toward SCP-1030-1. Box is crushed, exposing items inside. Box and all items integrated into SCP-1030-1. All previous components of SCP-1030-1 have now been replaced.\n\n<0858:54> SCP-1030-1 sits in corner of cell.\n\n<0920:10> Security and clean-up crews enter. No reaction from SCP-1030-1.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1030-03: Unprompted writing\n\nSCP-1030-1 does not typically initiate communication except to request new materials, and only offers minimal response to questions. However, on one occasion, approximately 1 hour after fruitless questioning had ended regarding SCP-1030-1's origins, SCP-1030-1 entered the following on the terminal in its cell.\n\n\n\n\nWas man.\n\nMan lived.
