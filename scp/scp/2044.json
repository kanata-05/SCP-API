Personnel are to discipline SCP-2044-1 if any of the above listed activities are performed. For a full list of prohibited actions, see Addendum-2044-D.\n\n\nFollowing Incident-2044-B, SCP-2044-1 is to be kept in Site-34\u2019s ICU to be provided with medical care in its comatose state. Subject's head is to be kept upright at all times, by means of a padded brace locked around the neck. A high-definition c-mount microscope camera has been installed directly above the scalp of SCP-2044-1, providing a live video feed of SCP-2044-2 for research staff.\n\n\nAs is standard protocol when dealing with parasitic SCPs, a hazmat suit of Level 2 or higher is to be worn when handling SCP-2044 to prevent potential spread of SCP-2044-2 to a separate host.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2044-1 is a 28-year-old human male of Estonian descent. SCP-2044-1\u2019s scalp is host to a large colony of head lice \n(Pediculus humanus capitis)\n estimated to be composed of two hundred individual specimens, henceforth referred to as SCP-2044-2. SCP-2044-2 instances possess a level of intelligence estimated to be equal to that of the average human, and are capable of building simple structures, operating machinery, and communicating in the Polish language. SCP-2044-2's small size makes communication impossible without the use of specialized acoustic equipment.\n\n\nSCP-2044-2 has established a small community on SCP-2044-1\u2019s scalp. This community is composed of 130 houses, two churches, a pub, six stores, and a town hall. These buildings are constructed by SCP-2044-2 using SCP-2044-1\u2019s hair and dandruff. The only constructs not composed of materials native to the human scalp are a large factory complex on the outskirts of the community, and three track loaders. The purpose of these non-organic elements seems to be the gathering and refinement of SCP-2044-1\u2019s dandruff into small bricks.\n\n\nThese bricks are taken at the end of every month by a house fly (\nMusca domestica\n) which arrives on SCP-2044-1\u2019s scalp, where SCP-2044-2 then loads the refined dandruff onto a metal harness installed in its exoskeleton. These house flies also deliver manufactured goods to SCP-2044-2, all of which are scaled down for their use. These supplies include spare parts meant to repair equipment within the dandruff refinery, small tin cans filled with keratinous materials and fragments of potatoes, and gear which is sold by SCP-2044-2 in its several stores. The house fly will then depart to an unknown location. Attempts to locate the origin of these house flies have been unsuccessful, as have attempts to track outgoing instances.\n\n\nWhen questioned on the origin of the house fly, the supplies it brings, the destination of the dandruff bricks, and how the miniature factory complex came to be on SCP-2044-1's scalp, the majority of SCP-2044-2 instances state that \u201cit\u2019s handled by the 'big wigs'.\u201d SCP-2044-2 refuse to elaborate further on this topic, stating that it would violate \u201ccompany policy.\u201d A transcript of an interview with an instance of SCP-2044-2 is available below.\n\n\nSCP-2044-1 claims no knowledge of SCP-2044-2\u2019s existence, and currently believes he is being held in Foundation custody for the crime of grand theft auto.\n Please refer to Incident-2044-B for SCP-2044-1's current condition.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Interview\u00a02044-A\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0-Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Interview\u00a02044-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed\n: SCP-2044-2-104 \"Bogus\u0142aw Jasi\u0144ski\"\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Dr. Stangar\n\n\nForeword\n: SCP-2044-2-104 claims to be the \"foreman\" of the factory present on SCP-2044-1's scalp. This interview was conducted using an experimental two-way communication system developed by Foundation scientist for communication with nanoscopic entities. This was the sixth exchange between Dr. Stagnar and SCP-2044-2-104. Exchange translated from Polish.\n\n\n<Log Begin>\n\n\nDr. Stangar\n : \"Hello, Bogus\u0142aw? Can you hear me?\"\n\n\nSCP-2044-2-104\n : \"Ah! Hello big mammal!\n1\n I didn't think we would speak again this soon!\"\n\n\nDr. Stangar\n : \"Yes, now may we return to our previous topic of your refinery?\"\n\n\nSCP-2044-2-104\n : \"You're breaking my nits with these incessant questions, you b\u0119kart! If the big wigs hear that I've been engaging in corporate espionage-\"\n\n\nDr. Stangar\n : \"Bogus\u0142aw, I'm trying to help you. This conversation will stay between the two of us. I swear.\"\n\n\nSCP-2044-2-104\n : \"Fine, but you had better not use my name.\"\n\n\nDr. Stangar\n : \"Of course. Now, can you tell me who exactly are these 'big wigs'?\"\n\n\nSCP-2044-2-104\n : They're the top of the food chain.

Last thing I need is to be caught talking to a fucking big mammal!\"\n\n\nSCP-2044-2-104 rapidly retreats into the refinery, shutting the entrance behind it.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nThis interview has revealed some startling implications. Not only does it suggest the existence of individuals similar to SCP-2044-1, it also makes reference to insects with a level of intelligence similar to SCP-2044-2. I recommend that we locate and contain these \"urban centers\" mentioned by SCP-2044-2-104 as soon as possible or at least investigate who these 'big wigs' are and why they built this factory. - Dr. Stangar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+Incident-2044-B\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0-Incident-2044-B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript detailing the events which occurred on 9/16/\u2588\u2588 which led to SCP-2044-1's current condition.\n\n\n<9:39>\n SCP-2044-1 sits upright on its bed, resting its head on its hand.
