According to metadata from the subject's copy of Adobe Illustrator, the creation of this image took 13.7 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-7922\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n While SCP-7922 cannot be physically contained, the prerequisites to generate an SCP-7922 event are extremely specific and improbable due to the following environmental factors:\n\n\n\n\nModern medical practices, i.e. widespread usage of the rabies vaccine and antiserum treatment.\n\n\nThe fact that a human subject vulnerable to SCP-7922 would not reasonably be given the tools to initiate an event.\n\n\nThe likelihood of death before a human subject enters the paralytic phase of rabies.\n\n\n\n\nUnintentional execution of an SCP-7922 event, while hypothetically possible, is improbable. Even so, the Foundation is to discreetly monitor every human case of rabies that advances past the prodromal phase.\n\n\nFoundation webcrawlers are to monitor the Internet for any online discussions that could lead to the intentional execution of SCP-7922, and suppress them accordingly. Should another SCP-7922 event occur, all works generated by the human subject are to be confiscated for analysis.\n\n\nEMERGENCY EDIT:\n Following Experiment-7922-Alpha, experimentation involving the initiation of SCP-7922 by Foundation personnel are forbidden.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7922 is a phenomenon that only occurs when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n\nA human subject contracts rabies.\n\n\nThe subject's illness progresses to the paralytic phase.\n\n\nDuring the paralytic phase, the subject is given a means to create visual art or poetry (such as a computer, a typewriter, paper and writing utensils, or a canvas and paint).\n\n\n\n\nOnce the medium is given, an SCP-7922 event will begin. The subject will abruptly regain consciousness, use the medium to create as much artwork and/or poetry as possible for one hour, then die of cardiac arrest. The creation of these works is done at a superhuman pace. One notable case, PoI-49399, was able to write a total of 2,504,393 words in one hour.\n\n\nAll works share a single subject: praises to a deity named N\u00c5ZHDAK.\n\n\nThere have been a total of 47 recorded SCP-7922 events since its discovery.\n\n\nAddendum 1 - Initial Occurrences:\n The first recorded SCP-7922 event took place on August 27th, 1978. Marcin Wozniak, an Alberta-based performance artist, left the following log of his experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 18th\n\n\nApril 19th\n\n\nMay 20th\n\n\nMay 26th\n\n\nJune 1st\n\n\nAugust 27th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrothers and sisters of the International Hell Yeah, hear my cry\u2026\n\n\nIf you can read this, Papa Marcy's got some pretty bad news for ya. Some of you may recall that when I was doing my stupid little lecture at the University of Montreal, I brought up that I was having a \"real stubborn toothache\". Would you believe it, the toothache was an everything-ache. It's an oral tumor! Cancer! I'm gettin' murdered by a zodiac sign, and not even one of the sexy ones!\n\n\nThe little bastard's dug himself in too deep in my gums to yank him out. The doctors said the only way to keep me over the clover would be chemotherapy.\n\n\n\"Oh yeah, that sounds like a GREAT idea! Lemme just chug atom bomb juice until this Mane of Peace I've been growing since 1963 packs its bags and moves to the dumpster.\"\n\n\nNow, I ask you: does that sound like a thing I would say? NAY, MY BROTHERS! MARCY IS UNDAUNTED!\n\n\nBut I'm not about to let Mr. Tumor have his way, neither. I'm gonna take my death sentence into my own hands, like Socrates.\n\n\nMourn me not, for this will be my magnum opus. I call this piece: \"DEFTLY SPELUNKING THRU THE CURTAIN OF FUCK.\"\n\n\nI will delve into the most forbidden place in the human psyche. I'll go somewhere that not even acid can take me. A place of madness from which I can never return. Once I dive in, I can only peek my head above the water for just a moment, to tell everyone else what I've seen, only to drown immediately thereafter.\n\n\nIn layman's terms, I've just gone and teased a couple hundred bats at my grandma's old farm.\n\n\nAs I type this, I've been chained to my king-size bed in Medicine Hat. Some of my colleagues from the museum are taking care of my daily needs. There's a typewriter on my lap. From this moment on, I'm gonna do nothin' but eat, sleep, piss, shit, write poetry, and die of rabies.\n\n\nBut that second-to-last one takes the first priority. That's right, for the first time in human history, you're gonna see the swan song of a rabies patient.\n\n\nWho knows where my mind is gonna be in that state? Will it be nonsense? Or will it be forbidden truth?\n\n\nThere's only one way to find out.\n\n\nSo with that, adieu. Don't nobody try to stop me \u2014 even if I start to doubt myself, this journey to the center of the mind is too stupid to quit now.\n\n\nIf this is bullshit, then I am a gladiator of bullshit.\n\n\nMe who is about to die salutes y'all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noh my fucking god this was a mistake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\"KILL ME\" repeated 598 times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns ssss s s s ssssdlkjbgs sssss ss s s ssss s s s ss s hfJjhlgjl;;kFBDbjfslajfdsbjafs COCKS gjskaal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe hunt will welcome me with open fist\n\ninsert my heart into your mouth and bite\n\nand hear it snap and let us consummate\n\nyou are my iron mandate given flesh\n\nto rend what's in the path of barebacked will\n\nperseverance of severance of all\n\ni prostrate for your delectation lord\n\ni mount the milk white steed into the storm\n\na concubine a cow a cavalier\n\nall three and more i am for you o prince\n\nthe burden i accept with trembling hands\n\nfrom you who sounds the sevenfluted horn\n\nand leads the masses clad in breathing mail\n\nagainst the weaver's treason still i weep\n\nfor when the weaver's banner first i saw\n\nin dreams that i had yet to comprehend\n\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\n\nEIGHT BECOME ONE\n\nEIGHT BECOME ONE\n\nEIGHT BECOME ONE\n\n\ngive me the iron snake right the fuck now\n\ngive me the iron snake right the fuck now\n\ngive me the iron snake right the fuck now\n\n\npickpocket these eyes from me\n\npickpocket these eyes from me\n\npickpocket these eyes from me\n\n\nyou promised\n\nyou promised\n\nyou promised\n\n\ni love you\n\ni love you\n\ni love you\n\n\nfold my face into an origami handmaiden\n\nfold my face into an origami handmaiden\n\nfold my face into an origami handmaiden\n\n\ni will pick the finest sausages for you\n\ni will pick the finest sausages for you\n\ni will pick the finest sausages for you\n\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\nN\u00c5ZHDAK NAI VORO DAHAX\n\n\n(It was at this point that Wozniak had run out of paper that he hadn't already destroyed.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing his funeral that September, Canadian police arrested Wozniak's friends who helped him with the experiment. (Assisted suicide was illegal at the time.) Among them was his wife, Audrey Wozniak, who took the sole copy of the last entry with her to prison. Mrs. Wozniak mailed the poem to her former colleagues at the Toronto University of Art with an explanation of what had transpired.\n\n\nIn 1982, one of Mrs. Wozniak's former students, hereafter PoI-49933, attempted to recreate the experiment. PoI-49933 left the following record of her attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface\n\n\nSCP-7922-affected Entry (excerpt)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Mrs. Wozniak,\n\n\nAs much as you warned me \u2014 I'm sorry, but I'm too curious. And considering how my life is going, there's nothing left to lose anyway.\n\n\nI've got my ex-boyfriend Keith on deck for keeping me in the same place. My parents think we eloped.\n\n\nFor the love of God, destroy this letter after you've seen it. I know it didn't work out between Keith and I, but since he's willing to go this far to help me out, he doesn't deserve to go to jail about it.\n\n\nIf anything came of the plan, it'll be on the enclosed document. For legitimacy, Keith's gonna try to catch the part where I write the poem on film.\n\n\nYour husband was a great artist. He would have wanted me to find out more about this \"Nasdaq\" thing. (Maybe the stock market's fucking with our minds.)\n\n\nAt any rate, I know you're angry with me and probably hate my guts about this. But we're gonna have to agree to disagree, because I'll never forget you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026N\u00c5ZHDAK HAS THREADED HIS IRON SNAKE THROUGH MY EARS AND MY BRAIN IS PLAYING DOUBLE DUTCH AND have you ever noticed how there are so many things with legs and lungs and teeth and nails that go around without being shot in their bitch face i can't even begin to \nSLEEP IN THE SUBWAY, DARLING / DON'T STAND IN THE POURING RAIN / DON'T SLEEP IN THE SUBWAY, DARLING / THE HUNT IS YOUNG / FORGET YOUR FOOLISH FLESH / NOTHING'S WRONG / N\u00c5ZHDAK HOWLS FOR YOUR STRENGTH\n firststarprinceKHUUM secondhuntprinceN\u00c5ZHDAK thirdverminprinceABBAD fourthfireprinceMUZD fifthloveprinceROUM sixthseaprinceHAJHETI seventhorderprinceJALAK\u00c5RA eighthforgottenprinceVUUOU \none of these things is not, like, the oth-errr\n and now o my brothers you will viddy the malenky horrorshow story of the time I went \nOFF TO SEE THE WIZAAARD, THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF\n \nthe variety of ways in which the Spanish Insquisition applied torture to those who they perceived to be heretics. For example, there was an item called the \"breast ripper\" that did exactly what you'd expect it\n's not unusual to be loved by anyone / it's not unusual to have fun with anyone / but when I see you\nr c o n t i n u e d r e f u s a l t o a c c e p t t h e b e a r e r o f t h e h o r n a t t h e f r o n t o f t h e a d v a n c i n g c h a o s a c r o s s t h e p l a i n s o f t h e w e a v e r ' s b l a s p e m\nE / C IS FOR COOKIE, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME / OH, COOKIE, COOKIE STARTS WITH C / HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

For example, one of the few accidental SCP-7922 events took place in Johannesburg, South Africa in May of 1985. The incident began when a ballpoint pen fell in the bed of a comatose rabies patient, PoI-59592. The subject broke free of his restraints and drew a mural on the wall of his hospital room. The mural depicted a three-headed godlike figure with the features of both a human and a weasel. The figure blew into a large spiral hunting horn with seven holes on the side.\n\n\nAddendum 2 - Experiment-7922-Alpha:\n In January of 2021, researcher Edwin Wallace of Site-59 reported that he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness.\n1\n Having expressed great interest in SCP-7922 in the past, Wallace volunteered to end his life in an experimental emulation of the procedure.\n\n\nOn June 4th, 2021, Researcher Wallace initiated an SCP-7922 event, and proceeded to write the following:\n\n\n\n\nI AM ANOINTED BY THE DISEASE AND SUMMONED UNTO THE BATTLEFIELD N\u00c5ZHDAK YOU HAVE UNPEELED THE FORESKIN OF MY VIRGIN EYEBALLS UNTO THE TRUTH MY LIFE IS YOURS I LOVE YOU I NEED YOU I\n\n\nWAIT WHAT\n\n\nTHAT'S IT??\n\n\nARE YOU SURE?\n\n\nBECAUSE I CAN DO MORE, IF YOU'D LIKE.\n\n\nUHH\n\n\nI MEAN, I'M NOT COMPLAINING, LESS WORK FOR ME.
