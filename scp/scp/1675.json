SCP-1675 is to be given 1 liter of 10W-30 motor oil every 90 days but otherwise does not require fuel or maintenance of any kind.\n\n\nExperimentation with SCP-1675 may only be performed with prior written permission from at least two Level 3 Senior Researchers. Experimentation involving use of live ammunition requires additional permission from one Level 4 Site Director and prior notification of Site-15 security staff; such experimentation must also be performed in a separate armored testing chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1675 is a digitigrade bipedal automaton of unknown manufacture that is apparently capable of indefinite operation with no detectable external power source or need for fuel. SCP-1675 stands approximately 1\u00a0m in height and appears to have been built for law enforcement or military application as it is equipped with high-strength manipulator arms, armor plating capable of withstanding small arms fire, and two shoulder-mounted machine guns fed from a hopper located on its back.\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, SCP-1675 is docile and harmless; left to its own devices, it will wander its containment area listlessly and does not pose a danger to any personnel. SCP-1675 will non-violently resist attempts to deactivate or disassemble it but will otherwise not resist any attempts to inspect or observe it. Attempts to discern more about its internal configuration have not been successful to date.\n\n\nWhenever SCP-1675 is exposed to a specimen of genus \nAnser\n, \nBranta\n, or \nChen\n, it will become highly aggressive and attempt to kill the specimen by any means possible. SCP-1675 is single-minded, efficient, and exhibits possible intelligence in its ability to operate tactically when need arises.\n\n\nPeriodically and while attacking such specimens, SCP-1675 will emit audible speech from a speaker located near its head, generally consisting of anti-avian propaganda in French. SCP-1675 has not responded to any attempts to communicate thus far.\n\n\nSCP-1675 was discovered by rangers in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 National Forest on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588. At time of discovery, SCP-1675 had killed over \u2588\u2588\u2588 specimens over a 27-hectare area. SCP-1675 was recovered without incident by the responding Foundation containment team and all witnesses were administered a Class A amnestic.\n\n\nAddendum 1675-01:\n Log of Notable Experiments\n\n\nDate\n: \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject\n: One (1) \nAnser anser domesticus\n (domestic goose)\n\n\nProvided Tools\n: None\n\n\nResult\n: SCP-1675 quickly chased down and strangled subject using its manipulator arms.\n\n\nEmitted Speech\n: \"The only good goose is a dead goose.\"\n\n\nDate\n: \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject\n: One (1) \nA. anser domesticus\n\n\nProvided Tools\n: Single-edged combat knife\n\n\nResult\n: SCP-1675 used provided knife as a thrown weapon to wound Subject, retrieved knife, then killed Subject with a single lateral cut to its neck. SCP-1675 retained knife, but surrendered it without resistance to research personnel.\n\n\nEmitted Speech\n: \"There will be no peace until all geese are dead.\"\n\n\nDate\n: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject\n: One (1) \nA. anser domesticus\n\n\nProvided Tools\n: Ten (10) rounds of 5.56mm ammunition\n\n\nResult\n: SCP-1675 loaded provided ammunition into its hopper, then killed Subject with a single accurate burst of three (3) rounds at close range. Research staff were unable to remove the loaded ammunition.\n\n\nEmitted Speech\n: \"Geese are a blight that must be purged.\"\n\n\nDate\n: \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject\n: Three (3) \nBranta canadensis\n (Canada goose)\n\n\nProvided Tools\n: None\n\n\nResult\n: SCP-1675 stood still until Subjects approached, then ambushed and strangled one Subject using its manipulator arms while firing its remaining ammunition at the other fleeing Subjects.\n\n\nEmitted Speech\n: \"All geese shall roast in the flames of righteous justice.\"\n\n\nDate\n: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject\n: One (1) \nCygnus olor\n (Mute swan)\n\n\nProvided Tools\n: None\n\n\nResult\n: SCP-1675 did not immediately react to Subject. When Subject approached within 1\u00a0m of SCP-1675 to investigate, Subject was gently pushed away.\n\n\nEmitted Speech\n: \"Nothing to see here, move along.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1674\n | SCP-1675 | \nSCP-1676\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1675\n\" by Aelanna, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
