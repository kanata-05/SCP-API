Experimentation on SCP-7491 must be approved by at least one member of the No\u00f6spherics Division.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7491 is the former security card of Dr. Arielle Leverre, senior researcher of the No\u00f6spherics Division. SCP-7491 lacks any physical anomalous properties, and is marked anomalous by the properties of its no\u00f6spheric ideosignature.\n.\nIdeosignature:\n (\nn.\n) The collection of ideas that make up any object. (i.e., an object's no\u00f6spheric footprint)\n\n\nSCP-7491's ideosignature is active. An active ideosignature indicates one which has the ability to interact with elements of other ideosignatures by expelling mentergy\n.\nMentergy:\n (\nn.\n) The no\u00f6spheric equivalent to energy, measured in Duvalls (\u03b4). What allows for ideosignatures to interact amongst each other. Believed to be generated by brain activity.\n \n \nand transferring it between both elements. To simplify, SCP-7491 is capable of thought. Tests meant to determine SCP-7491's intelligence level are ongoing.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7491/I:\n Discovery - Incident \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/7491-01\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2034/01/31\n\n\nPERSONNEL PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Arielle Leverre\n\n\nDr. Idi Omondi\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n SCP-7491 was first discovered during standard preparation of the prototype NMED\n.\nThe \nNo\u00f6spheric Measuring and Experimentation Device\n, informally called \"Ned\" by no\u00f6spheric personnel, is a first-of-its-kind device allowing for the evaluating of ideosignatures, their components, and the mentergy transfers that take place between them, all at the same time. Further information is classified Level 4/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Clearance.\n. SCP-7491 accidentally kept the machine open without any staff noticing during an active test. This resulted in mentergy leaking into the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Omondi stands behind the NMED, watching the controls. Dr. Leverre stands beside the device's opening with a sheet of paper in hand.>\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Alright, put the thing in, and lets get rolling.\n\n\n<Dr. Leverre places the sheet of paper inside the opening of the NMED, and shuts it. As she closes the opening, her security card falls out of her lab coat pocket and into the machine, propping the opening ajar. She fails to notice this, and begins to walk towards Dr. Omondi.>\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n Ready.\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Ready.\n\n\n<The NMED activates, pulsing blue light outwards as its main turbine activates. A reading on the machine shows a negative mentergy output, and an error in the main processing compartment. A large column of blue light shoots out from the device and shines onto Dr. Leverre. She does not react. Dr. Omondi rushes to turn the NMED off.>\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Well\u2026 that's not great.\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n \n<sarcastically.>\n Oh, really?\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen.\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n Just turn the damn thing off, I'll go take a look.\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n \n<jokingly saluting.>\n Yes, Ma'am.\n\n\n<Dr. Omondi powers down the NMED as Dr. Leverre walks back to the main access area. She opens the hatch, revealing her security card.>\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n \n<under her breath>\n How in the\u2014 \n<louder>\n My security card got in the machine.\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n I don't think Ned needs level 4 clearance.\n\n\n<A pause as Dr. Leverre stares at Dr. Omondi.>\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Tough crowd.\n\n\n<Dr. Leverre retrieves her security card and closes the NMED.>\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n It should be good now. Ready.\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Read- Wait, huh?\n\n\n<Dr. Omondi inspects the NMED's record of the previous activation.>\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n According to Ned, there was something actively thinking, \nin the hatch\n, during the last run.\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n That is\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Leverre opens the NMED again and removes the sheet of paper, placing her security card inside.>\n\n\nDr. Leverre:\n Ready.\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n \u2026Ready.\n\n\n<Dr. Omondi activates the NMED, which records positive mentergy levels, and an Active Ideosignature within.>\n\n\nDr. Omondi:\n Seems we've got ourselves a new study tool, huh?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7491/III:\n Relevant Experimentation Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-143\n\n\nDATE:\n 2034/01/31\n\n\nSUPERVISOR:\n Dr. I.

Its caused us to question one of our main theories, and it could allow for even further refining of no\u00f6spherics. It's not just some thing with a consciousness in it. Hell, we don't even know whether it \nfeels\n things, because emotions aren't really the same as thinking, and thinking is all we know it can do. We can't \"let it go\" off of just a few days of testing and a few concerning thoughts.\n\n\nThere are so many things to still test for. How much do memories impact mentergy? How do memories allow for mentergy to be used? \nHow did the damn thing get its thoughts in the first place?\n Was it the light that hit Arielle? Something else with the machine?

Our division has clawed its way to stability, from our very first intrusion into the no\u00f6sphere, to a fully-fledged division with its own dedicated history and personnel. This being said, all of our actions thus far have been within ethical parameters.\n\n\nThis is where I, and a few others, draw the line. We cannot let what may be the largest no\u00f6spheric breakthrough in a while be tainted with the knowledge of what we have done to achieve it. We cannot allow for someone to suffer for eternity, without stimulus nor growth, for us to sit back and selfishly grow ourselves. SCP-7491 does not deserve the fate it has been given, and should not deserve it any longer.\n\n\nPlease, consider its decommissioning with this in mind.\n\n\n-Dr. A.
