No manufacturer information, serial number, or other identifying features are present on SCP-696.\n\n\nSCP-696 is sapient, and is able to move its keys independently. However, it has expressed a reluctance to communicate unless loaded with paper and a ribbon of red ink. SCP-696 is also capable of understanding messages typed into it, allowing two-way communication. It is unknown how, as SCP-696 only appears to experience tactile sensations, but SCP-696 is able to distinguish between individuals it has communicated with. A majority of SCP-696 messages are typed in all capital letters in a verbose styling, and often include themes and imagery commonly featured in dark fantasy media.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Display\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-696\u00a001\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview is the result of initial testing of SCP-696 using D-Class personnel.

Permission was temporarily granted to test whether non-communicative products of SCP-696 possessed anomalous properties. D-69601 has been briefed on appropriate \nSnow Protocols\n, which are to remain active throughout the duration of testing.\n\n\nSCP-696 produced fifty pages within the twenty-four hours, and continued at an increasing rate over the course of the test. Over the course of eight days, SCP-696 produced 666 pages of content, titling the novel \"The Dark Gods of The Abyss.\" Testing with D-Class personnel confirmed that excerpts of the novel (tentatively designated SCP-696-1) held no anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-696-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night, a car speeding down an all too narrow road.
