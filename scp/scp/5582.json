Every containment facility is to have at least one untested containment plan for SCP-5582 prepared at all times. Until permanent containment is deemed successful, the continued recapture of SCP-5582 under new conditions is intended to serve as a substitute for real containment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5582 is a three-year-old common octopus\n1\n, capable of surviving an indefinite amount of time without water. SCP-5582 is sapient and has advanced problem-solving skills. SCP-5582 could not be subjected to any test in this regard, due to its constant containment breaches, but to date, SCP-5582 was able to solve any logical problem encountered.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation became aware of SCP-5582 through multiple reports of a bank heist involving an octopus. Agents were dispatched to the scene and found SCP-5582 lurking in the immediate vicinity. SCP-5582 was apprehended and brought to Site-17 but was able to crawl out of the containment vehicle before its arrival due to the lack of octopus-specific restraints.\n\n\nSCP-5582 was again found a few weeks later observing Site-17. When Agents were again dispatched to apprehend SCP-5582, they were unable to find it. It is estimated that SCP-5582 infiltrated Site-17 prior to being noticed.\n\n\nInterview-Log:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5582\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Researcher Mellow\n\n\nForeword:\n \nThis interview was conducted after SCP-5582 showed up at the front entrance of Site-23. SCP-5582 used the stones of its provisional containment aquarium to write its answers.\n\n\n<Begin Log, skip to 05:34>\n\n\nUp to this point SCP-5582 had only been placing its stones at random.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n I don't see why you even requested an interview if you refuse to answer.\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nTook you long enough to notice. Don't worry, I was listening.\n \n(SCP-5582 looks directly at Junior Researcher Mellow)\n \nYeah, you\u2019ll do it.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n Me?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nWhat? No. You young people are always so self-centred. I mean all of you, obviously.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n And what exactly is it you want from us?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nYou'll get it eventually.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n Then will you answer why you took part in the heist?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nWhy does anyone rob a bank? For myself, obviously.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n Then why did you willingly let yourself be contained?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nAlso for me.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n You're not making any sense.\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nYou\u2019ll understand it when you\u2019re a little older.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n I really don't think so? What do you get from letting yourself be contained?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \nNo\n\n\nJunior Researcher Mellow:\n No?\n\n\nSCP-5582:\n \n(it tips its head with one of its arms)\n \nNo stagnation.\n\n\nSCP-5582 refused to communicate any further.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n \nSCP-5582 breached containment shortly after the interview concluded. It was discovered that stones were disrupting the function of its cell door locking mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n3 days after this breach, Junior Researcher Mellow received an anonymous message titled \"Before you do it\" containing a picture of SCP-5582.\n\n\nFurther notable incidents:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5582 was contained in Site-11 in a standard containment cell with a more complex locking mechanism. SCP-5582 was able to escape through the ventilation system with the help of a previously half-swallowed screwdriver.\n\n\nSite-66 constructed a special cell for SCP-5582, that made an escape through life-supporting systems like ventilation and drainage impossible. SCP-5582 escaped through bribing a now-former junior researcher with its stolen money to aid in its containment breach.\n\n\nSCP-5582 was captured by Site-06-3 from a local aquarium. Containment was planned to include several logic puzzles, but the octopus was found to be non-anomalous. On the same day, Site-06-3 Staff received an anonymous message titled \"Already solved\" containing the solutions to all logic puzzles.\n\n\nDuring its stay at Site-19, SCP-5582 was informed of the existence of other sapient cephalopods in containment. SCP-5582 agreed to a meeting but fled during \nthe siege of Site-19\n. The following message was received afterwards:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat, you want me to socialize at this age? Weird thing to ask a three-year-old. Still tempting, but I wished you\u2019d have asked me when I wasn\u2019t crawling on my last arm.\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, SCP-5582 was spotted in front of the containment tank of \nSCP-2967\n2\n by surveillance cameras. They both communicated through an unknown sign language for about an hour after which SCP-5582 escaped before the footage was noticed. The following message was received afterwards:\n\n\n\n\nNah, I\u2019m good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll further encounters with SCP-5582 are documented in the \nSCP-5582 Containment Log\n.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nOctopus Vulgaris\n\n\n2\n. One of the cephalopods alluded to during the previous containment attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5581\n | SCP-5582 | \nSCP-5583\n \u00bb",
