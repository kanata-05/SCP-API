Continuation of limited testing is currently being considered.\n\n\nUpdate:\n Following recent discoveries (See testing report), further testing of SCP-6197 has been approved.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6197 refers to forty-eight gummy candies, stored inside a plastic pill jar. SCP-6197 are coloured purple and each engraved with the digits \u201c001\u201d on one side, and a capitalised \u201cW\u201d on the other. On the jar\u2019s label is printed the following text:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wondertainment\u2019s Dream Gummies!\n\n\nExplore and adventure new places! Discover inspiration in the comfort of your own head!\n\nSleep tight, and don\u2019t forget to get at least eight minutes of sleep!\n\n\nWARNING:\n Only one gummy is to be taken at a time. Overdosage may result in permanent loss of brain functionality, or splintering of the neural consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom of the jar \u201cIHAPW\u201d is written in blue marker.\n\n\nWhen SCP-6197 is ingested, subjects fall asleep shortly afterwards. Subjects will awaken after exactly eight minutes, or if disturbed by external forces. If allowed to sleep for the full eight minutes, subjects will awaken physically and mentally well-rested as if they had slept for approximately eight hours.\n\n\nSCP-6197-2 is a lucid dream experienced after taking SCP-6197. SCP-6197-2 will always be set in a location near-identical to the real world, including locations and living entities indistinguishable to their actual counterparts. Subjects will appear as a different person each time experiencing SCP-6197-2; appearing in the present location of the person\u2019s real-world counterpart. Subjects within SCP-6197-2 are capable of interacting with dreamt persons and constructs, as well as experiencing physical stimuli as if they were real.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-6197-2 has been confirmed as near indistinguishable in most aspects, several locations and phenomena have been reported during testing to be inconsistent with reality. Primarily, these differences appear as the lack or inclusion of various anomalous phenomena both contained and outside of Foundation possession. Dreamt Foundation personnel express no concern towards these differences, accepting their inclusion or lack-thereof as normal within SCP-6197-2.\n\n\nFoundation personnel that have scored high in IMINT (Imagery Intelligence) often report significantly more anomalies contained within SCP-6197-2 Foundation instances.\n\n\nThe passage of time experienced in SCP-6197-2 is approximately one hour for every minute a subject spends asleep. No matter what events take place or time subjects spend in SCP-6197-2, the dream will always end with the subject consuming SCP-6197-1A.\n\n\nSCP-6197-1A is an instance of SCP-6197 that appears within SCP-6197-2. SCP-6197-1A is identical to the original anomaly, save for an engraved number \u201c002\u201d in-place of \u201c001\u201d.\n\n\nSeveral reports from test subjects have confirmed that when consumed by someone within SCP-6197-2 other than themselves, SCP-6197-1A will cause the dreamt individual to also fall asleep. The dreamed subject will awaken within eight minutes from the actual dreamer's perspective, and claim to have experienced the same effects as SCP-6197 would induce, with the exception that the \u201c002\u201d engraved on the SCP-6197-1A instance they ingested in their own dream to instead be \u201c003\u201d. The exact limit of this phenomena has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-6197 was recovered from an abandoned warehouse in \n[REDACTED]\n1\n. The warehouse had no apparent purpose and contained no records or other items, despite including multiple storage spaces and workstations. Investigation into the alias \u201cDr. Wondertainment\u201d for further details is to be carried out.\n\n\nAddendum - Testing Report:\n Brain waves of test subjects appear to be projected elsewhere when dreaming, while neural receptors experience stimuli as if triggered by actual physical phenomena. This contrasted with subjects' proclaimed experiences in SCP-6197-2, and the additional experiences reported by dreamt persons' own \"dreams\" suggests the consciousness may actually be projected into a tangible reality, rather than simply entering a lucid dream.\n\n\nFurther testing has been approved for a restricted number of D-Class personnel.\n\n\nAddendum - Continued Testing Log:\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-981935\n\n\nResults:\n D-981935 ingests an instance of SCP-6197.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world wavered for a brief moment before popping into darkness and coating D-981935\u2019s face with generous amounts of slobber.\n\n\nIsabelle Wondertainment jolted upright, creaking her office chair. She looked down at the tiny starring corgi in her lap, demanding affection. She checked the inky-blue watch drawn on her wrist, it\u2019s squiggly second-hand methodically ticked.\n\n\n\u201cOh for\u2026 Jeremy, I told you not to wake me up when working!\u201d The dog tilted its little head to the side.\n\n\n\u201cIt \nis\n work. No matter what you think!\u201d She kicked the ground, sending her swivel chair spinning into her office desk with a slight bump, shaking the plastic jar and it\u2019s spilled contents on-top. She picked up the jar and scooped several purple gummies into it, all of which were marked \u201c000\u201d. She tilted her head way back and tossed a gummy into the air, opening her mouth wide for a moment before suddenly snapping it shut. The additional dosage bounced off her nose and fell onto the floor. No use relying on these things \ntoo\n much\u2026\n\n\nThere was just so much to think about, yet it all eventually faded away whenever she\u2019d wake back up. A flaming swordsman? That would be a pretty cool action figure\u2026 a bit dangerous, though. How about a whole set? Two armies: One whimsical and the other, a repulsively manufactured pain in the butt? No. That wouldn\u2019t bother The Factory too much\u2026 And that one winding path would pop out too many ideas even one dosage could handle!\n\n\nBut in all the dreams she\u2019d had, one recurring idea stood tall. And despite it\u2019s initial flaws, it\u2019s grey-white walls, and sombrely clinical nature\u2026 it was always something unique, something \nmissing\n. And being unique counted more than anything.\n\n\nShe scooted over behind the desk, shuffled a few pages of empty lined paper, and picked up a purple pen.\n\n\n\u201cNot the most colourful place\u2026 But mind you Jeremy, it always has the most interesting ideas\u2026\u201d\n\nIsabelle Wondertainment sighed and looked back down at the papers, before pausing for a brief moment.\n\n\n\u201cFoundation\u2026 \nThere's a fun idea!\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nAvailable only to registered Wondertainment employees.
