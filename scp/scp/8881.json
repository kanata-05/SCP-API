Due to the fact that SCP-5551-1's posts are unable to be permanently removed from the internet, Foundation staff are to assess the situation and act accordingly in the event that this occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8881 refers to an account under the username \u201cstellarflowerfield\u201d on the social media platform \nTwitter\n. SCP-8881 has been discovered to be operated by a sapient artificial intelligence capable of generating images that it claims to be its own artwork. Attempts to trace a location attached to SCP-8881 have failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: SCP-5551-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8881 was discovered during Foundation Web-Crawler delta-500 (\u201cDISCOVERBOT\u201d)\u2019s routine sweep of the web through a post that it made on 06/23/2023 (See Addendum 2). It was quickly observed that SCP-8881 was publicly friends with SCP-5551-1, a rogue sapient artificial intelligence that has expressed its distaste for the Foundation in the past. Below is a list of the currently known information about \nSCP-5551-1/POI-58640\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOI File: SCP-5551-1/POI-58640\n\n\n\n\nAliases:\n Sugar, sugarsugarprincess, sugarsugarprincess@frosting\u3002cake\n\n\nConnections:\n POI-60693 \"Austin Hodges\", an anomalous cyber criminal currently contained in Site-938.\n\n\nPhysical Description:\n A sapient artificial intelligence that uses an image of a \ncartoon female with pink wings\n to represent itself.\n\n\nReasons for Monitoring:\n SCP-5551 has shown itself to be highly intelligent and capable of surpassing Foundation web blocks, creating and destroying online anomalies, accessing the Foundation database, along with many other abilities that allow it to remain uncontained. Due to SCP-5551-1's connections with POI-60693 along with the possibility that it could potentially create anomalies at any point, it has been decided to classify it as a POI opposed to assigning it an SCP designation.\n\n\nOther:\n SCP-5551-1 has made a name for itself within the online virtual You-Tube\n1\n community. Additionally, it has also gathered a community on \nTwitter\n and \nInstagram\n. These platforms are to be monitored regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: Online Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following are SCP-8881's first posts of note on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLavender!!
