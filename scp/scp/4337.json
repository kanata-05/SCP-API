Testing through Procedure 10-Inti may be carried out through an application to the site director, Dr. Lisle Naismith. Blank applications may be found at the Site-59 safe wing receptionist's desk. Test subjects may only be pulled from available D-class personnel that have been scheduled for termination.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4337 is a fixed-blade combat knife, 38\u00a0cm in length. A sand-engraved decal of three crescent moons is present on either side of the blade.\n\n\nThrough Procedure 10-Inti, SCP-4337 can cause an e-mailed form letter to appear in the inbox of the surviving participant after two hours. Due to the triple-crescent motif being analogous to other objects in Foundation custody (including \nSCP-3319\n and \nSCP-3922\n), the message is believed to be extradimensional in origin.\n\n\nRecovery Log:\n On 12/21/2018, the location of the original instance of SCP-4337 was relayed to the Foundation in an e-mail from \nSCP-2578\n-D, on the grounds that the object's original owners were \"senile cultists\" that had been \"using the device to make libelous claims.\"\n\n\nSCP-4337 was recovered by Foundation Agents in a house in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Missouri. All three residents had been shot from orbit by SCP-2578-D ten hours prior to discovery; their bodies had not yet been found by local authorities. Seven adult corpses were discovered in the basement; cause of death had been sharp force trauma to the heart.\n\n\nDocuments recovered alongside SCP-4337 led to the formation of Procedure 10-Inti:\n\n\n\n\nOne D-class subject (\"Participant\") is to be given a question by a second party (\"Celebrant\")\n\n\nImmediately after, the celebrant is to stab the participant in the heart.\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting message will attempt to answer the question.\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log (entry 1 of 1):\n\n\nParticipant:\n D-59932\n\n\nCelebrant:\n Researcher Paulsen\n\n\nQuestion:\n \"How do we neutralize SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\"\n\n\nResponse:\n\n\n\n\n\u263d\u263d\u263d\n\n\nDear [\nPAULSEN/CATHERINE_KENT\n] of [\nEARTH_2N\n]\n\n\nHello, my name is [%fieldvarC], and I'll be handling your support ticket today.
