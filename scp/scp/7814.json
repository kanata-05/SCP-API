We think you\u2019ll be a great asset to our mission and want to make sure you get settled in as smoothly as possible.\n\n\nAs discussed, your first day will be September 3rd. Please arrive at Site-02 by 10:00 AM and wear whatever\u2019s comfortable, as we\u2019re business casual [or whatever your dress code is].\n\n\nWhen you arrive, please check in with our receptionist to receive your new employee badge. Our new member liaison will show you to your workstation and get you settled in.\n\n\nPlease take some time to start the process before your first day by logging into SCiPnet with your new credentials. Other members can help you finish this process when you arrive.\n\n\nFeel free to contact ethistician.aic if you have any questions before you start. We\u2019re thrilled to have you join us!\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nChairman Odongo Tejani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Odongo Tejani (\npcs.eettimmocscihte|ylperon#pcs.eettimmocscihte|ylperon\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Jack Robinson (\npcs.rehcraeser|tsebehtjrj#pcs.rehcraeser|tsebehtjrj\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Welcome to the Ethics Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you SO MUCH Mr. Tejani, you have NO IDEA what this means to me. I joined the Foundation to further the cause of scientific research and knowledge, but I soon realized just how much this place was in dire need of ethicists. A check and a balance on wayward administrators to keep our noble researchers safe from the hazards of the job. I\u2019m so, so lucky to be here and so, so grateful to you for giving me this warm welcome. I mean, think of that! The legendary Odongo Tejani, deigning me worth his time!\n\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to get everything set up before my first day. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll do you one better. I logged into SCiPnet yesterday and noticed we had a vote coming up on that telekill alloy stuff, SCP-148 if I recall? I remember being assigned to a project before it was canceled over that stuff. Couldn't get the authorization. So between my personal stake and the investigative skills you\u2019ve recognized by honoring me with this position, I\u2019ll have a full dossier ready for you within the week! And, since you don't have any evidence of that yet, I'll remind you that it's already been voted on several times, so there's probably nothing, and if there is something, I'll probably end up catching it! Not to brag, but I probably won\u2019t even need ethistician\u2019s help, although I do appreciate it.\n\n\nBut seriously, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.

Applicants must submit Form 7814-A to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, who will survey the site if needed and arrange for telekill installation. Form 7814-A must include:\n\n\n\n\nA full description of the intended use.\n\n\nFull, unredacted SCP files and test logs for all SCPs involved, with cognito- and infohazards flagged appropriately.\n1\n\n\nA clean record of D-Class breaches.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7814 (known by materials engineers as \u201cTelekill Alloy\u201d) is an alloy of mundane metals and [REDACTED].\n2\n It has a gray-green color with a bluish tinge and oxidizes readily in the presence of water, and has a variable density no less than 6.10\u00a0g/cm\n3\n.\n\n\nSCP-7814's primary anomalous property is that it produces a negative psionic field.\n3\n This blocks or otherwise hinders extrasensory mind-affecting properties, following an inverse-square law similar to electromagnetism. Its use has expedited many Foundation operations:\n\n\n\n\nMind-affecting anomalies cannot breach telekill walls or meshes, allowing smaller containment chambers and safer transport of psionic anomalies. Furthermore, their effects are weaker in such chambers, allowing for safer testing.\n\n\nTelekill-lined meeting rooms and bunkers cannot be penetrated by psychic influence, scrying, or mind-reading, increasing information security.\n\n\nTelekill-coated fiber-optic cables are similarly impervious to psionic divination. As a result, all Sites have been outfitted with such cables, and all digital communications or transfers of files classified Level 5 or higher (such as requests for files classified Level 5 or above) are carried out over these cables.\n\n\nTelekill-lined D-Class bunkers prevent confounding factors of previous psionic influence from interfering with tests.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n\n\n\nThaumaturgic runes inscribed on SCP-7814 can selectively prevent thaumaturgical workings. Site-17 was experimentally outfitted with 7814-Evening cages tuned to prevent the opening of Ways after the Serpent\u2019s Incursion of Site-17, and it was soon discovered that this also weakened the effects of several thaumaturgical SCPs on-Site. This allowed for smaller containment chambers, less extensive containment procedures, and fewer containment breaches.\n\n\nWhen an electric current is driven through SCP-7814, it can dispel spectral entities on contact. This discovery improved the efficiency of the Department of Spectral Entities by 300%.\n\n\nSCP-7814 was recently discovered to be a more effective Hume sink than beryllium bronze, the previous material of choice for ontokinesis-resistant architecture and equipment. Trial runs of SCP-7814-based COLOURLESS RED units with MTF Lambda-5 \u201cWhite Rabbits\u201d have shown an improvement in dealing with dangerous ontokinetic entities and low-Hume environments, and wider rollout is expected to prevent future casualties among field agents\n\n\nNew processes have made SCP-7814 cheaper than steel, which is why in 2021, Experimental Site-78 began construction with SCP-7814 rebar.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7814 was first discovered in 1982 during a raid on Prometheus Labs, and first utilized in 1988 to enable the safe transport of \nSCP-035\n to Site-19. SCP-7814 would see increasingly frequent use in transportation of dangerous mind-affecting anomalies, and in 1994, the first 7814-Evening containment chamber was approved. From 2005 onwards it became standard for half of all Keter-class containment chambers to be lined with SCP-7814, and in 2009 Site-19 completed its \u201ctelekill wing,\" a wing made exclusively of SCP-7814-lined cells. This set the standard, and today almost every Site has a substantial number of cells utilizing SCP-7814.\n\n\nUse of SCP-7814 has saved the Foundation millions of dollars in containment costs and prevented hundreds of thousands of casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal #335\n\n\n \n\n\n------\n\nWelcome, ec-user-33308affc0e\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n> file scp-7814 -l 5\n\n\nReenter Level 5 credentials.\n\n> jackrobinson-ec-uu88ylo18314d\n\n> Pierce^H^H^H^HY^ the HEAVENs.

I'm a member of the Ethics Committee, as you can tell from the email. Fancy new domain name! Anyway, I noticed you had a lot of complaints about SCP-7814, which I'm actually doing an inquest into now. Would you mind scheduling an interview of some kind?\n\n\nSalutations,\n\nJack Robinson\n\nProud member of the Ethics Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Hello! Thanks for agreeing to this.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Hey.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Everything going okay?\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Nope.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Sorry to hear that.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n But we have a job to do, so\u2026 tell me about telekill.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Don't like it.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Don't like being around it.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Don't like how it's in every Site built after 2008.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n You're a psionic. How does it feel to be around it?\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Shitty. Like my head's in a five-by-five-by-five cube of solid metal.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n So, there's always some psychic ambience, right? Billions of humans thinking, feeling, doing\u2026 everyone makes a little psionic force, and you can usually feel it.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n But around that stuff, it's all quiet.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n It's quiet when I take \npsybuprofen\n, too. Except the telekill quiet isn't empty, blissful quiet. It's full of little migraines, or maybe one big migraine with a lot of limbs. I can barely think around that stuff.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Weirdly, the psybuprofen helps. If they'd stop building telekill cells for skips that don't need it, that would help a lot more.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n So, stop mixing telekill and telepaths. Why is that not already a standard?\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Search me. We don't have a LOT of telekill cells at our Site, but some of our Keter cells use it, \"just in case.\" We don't have a lot of cases. One of them's being used for a Safe doll that randomly makes one person in a kilometer radius fantasize about strangling it every time someone leaves its area of effect. Now the cell makes me fantasize about strangling whoever invented telekill every time I walk by. Oh, and did I mention the cell is situated \nright\n between me and one of the skips I'm in charge of?\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n If it were up to me, those cells would be in cells.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Made of lead.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Five feet thick.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Five thousand leagues under the sea.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n I see. I'll see what I can do. Neglect of anomalous employees is fairly unethical.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Please do. If I have to see that shade of blue again I'll defect to the Serpent's Hand.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Well, that concludes this interview. If you have any other information or know someone who does, shoot me an email. Thank you for your time!\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n No problem! It's nice that you took the time to ask a random psionics specialist about this instead of some department chair.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n No problem! The input of everyday Foundation employees is just as valuable as any Chair, Couch, or Table!\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Oh yeah one more thing.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Go ahead!\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n There's no such thing as a negative psionic field.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Psionic fields are made of thoughts. You can't have an anti-thought, just like you can't have negative mass.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Well, maybe that's just the anomaly!\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Pretty sure there's more to it.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n This \"negative psionic field\" shows up as zero or a positive one depending on the measuring tool we use.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Also depending on the measuring tool, when a normal psionic field's around, sometimes the fields cancel out, sometimes they don't.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n I asked around, and guess what I got?\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Access denied?\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n Pretty much.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n I should be able to access those files.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Should, but can't.\n\n\n<MACLEAR>\n \u2026pretty sure I'm not cleared to know that.\n\n\n<ec-user-33308affc0e>\n Oh!

But no, the usage increases significantly after 2009, which is when the telekill wing was completed.\n\n\nETHISTICIAN:\n This discrepancy can't be accounted for by increased contaiment subjects or testing rates, either. Would you like to download the full statistical report?\n\n\n[ec-user-33308affc0e]:\n Yes, and can you compile some other statistics on D-Class at 19 while you're at it? And D-Class at other sites with telekill stuff.

She taps her hands on the surface of this table, occasionally looking up at the security camera taking this footage. Someone opens the one door into this room from the outside: It\u2019s Jack Robinson, clutching a clipboard and blank sheets of paper.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Hello.\n\n\nDarcy looks at him like she wasn\u2019t expecting anyone, let alone this fresh-faced man in a labcoat.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Who?\n\n\nRobinson looks back at Darcy with equal confusion.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n It\u2019s me. Jack Robinson? You know, the Ethics Committee guy?\n\n\nDARCY:\n Oh.\n\n\nDarcy nods.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Yeah, yeah, I remember something like that.\n\n\nAfter a moment of gazing off into space, Darcy raises a pockmarked hand, the record of a lifetime of burn scars.\n\n\nDARCY:\n \u2018Lo.\n\n\nRobinson sits down in the empty seat closest to the door, clipboard in hand.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Well, let\u2019s get to the point then. Tell me about telekill.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Wonderful stuff, innit? Ain\u2019t nothing\u2026\n\n\nDarcy looks at the security camera in the corner.\n\n\nDARCY:\n \u2026ain\u2019t nothing it can\u2019t do.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n You worked in the manufacturing of this stuff for twenty years. Got promoted to forewoman, too. Anything you can tell me about the procedure?\n\n\nDARCY:\n Oh, you know, uh\u2026 pretty simple really. Take a sample of classified, throw in a little redacted, heat to the temperature of the sun, then hammer it blackbox times with, uh, what was the other one, uh, data-expunged.\n\n\nDarcy rubs her temple.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Shit, \nanything\n brings on the headaches nowadays\u2026\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I do have Ethics Committee clearance. You can tell me anything.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Then, shit, why not read the docs yourself? No, no, there\u2019s\u2026\n\n\nDarcy stares at a corner of the room.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Ms. Darcy?\n\n\nDARCY:\n Lost my train of thought.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n That\u2019s fine. Just tell me about your experience.\n\n\nDARCY:\n It starts out like any other job. Just shut your brain off and follow the instructions. Well, I could never get the first part down. Hammer, hammer, hammer\u2026 hiss. Mixers and melters and psio-things I forgot the name, but it\u2019s \nquiet.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Quiet?\n\n\nDARCY:\n Quiet. Yes.\n\n\nDarcy stares at Robinson, muttering \u201cQuiet, quiet, quiet\u2026\u201d to herself like she\u2019s trying to remember what comes next.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Quiet. You can\u2019t really feel it at first. One, two years you\u2019re still wearing earplugs \u2018cause without \u2018em you can\u2019t hear yourself think. Hammer, hammer, mix. Hammer, hammer, mix. Nice. Calms the nerves. Ain\u2019t jumping at every thought that might be a threat. Ain\u2019t wondering, \ndid I go wrong? Am I going wrong? Will I go wrong?\n Nicer. Happier. Calm, at last, and even realizing that can\u2019t take it away from ya. Hammer, hammer, mix. Hammer, hammer, mix. You stand in front of a shelf of ingots and you swear you\u2019ve found your happy place.\n\n\nDARCY:\n \u2026then you do some more thinking. And you try to remember when\u2019s the last time you\u2026 time you\u2026 time you could hear yourself think. And you realize that\u2019s where all the garbage in your head went. Behind a fog. And that\u2019s where the rest of you is now, too.\n\n\nRobinson\u2019s eyes are wide.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n So, just to be clear, you\u2019re saying the telekill\u2026 eroded you?\n\n\nDarcy tilts her head, momentarily confused.\n\n\nDARCY:\n No! No, no, it wasn\u2019t like that. I\u2019m still me. Just slower. Farther. A week\u2019s journey between thoughts where once was a day.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n And this \u201cquiet\u201d you mentioned? Did you feel the industrial noise get quieter, or?\n\n\nDarcy taps her head.\n\n\nDARCY:\n Nope. All up in here. After a lifetime of being yelled at by your own mind, even an air horn factory feels like a farm out in the boonies.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I see\u2026 that\u2019s very helpful.

Applicants must submit Form 7814-A to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, who will survey the site if needed to determine if the D-Class barracks are suitable for an SCP-7814 installation. SCP-7814 installation is not to be approved for sites lacking a suitable D-Class population. As of 23/06/2013, all sites with SCP-7814 installations are to maintain at least one ongoing \"experiment\" classified Level 5/7814 that terminates at least one D-Class personnel per month.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7814 (known by materials engineers as \u201cTelekill Alloy\u201d) is an alloy of mundane metals and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n4\n\n\nSCP-7814's primary anomalous property is that [DATA EXPUNGED \u2014 see Document 7814-A] produces a 'negative psionic field.' A 'negative psionic field' is a mind-affecting anomaly that responds to and cancels other mind-affecting anomalies. For example, \nSCP-035\n compels nearby humans to put it on, and necessarily calls attention to this as part of the compulsion; thus, nearby SCP-7814 will compel those humans \nnot\n to put it on, and not to notice the original compulsions. This produces the appearance of inhibiting extrasensory mind-affecting properties, but processing these conflicting signals causes unconscious stress to nearby personnel. Over time, this results in decreased coherence of memories, increased risk of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders, and heightened anxiety. Furthermore, all humans naturally produce and interact with their own and others' psionic fields as a natural part of consciousness; telekill disrupts this process, and prolonged exposure can lead to reduced motivation, increased risk of depression, lowered libido\u2026\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\nDespite these drawbacks, use of SCP-7814 has saved the Foundation millions of dollars in containment costs and prevented more casualties than it has caused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 03/09/2023\n\n\nNote:\n The following footage was recovered from the security camera within Ethics Committee Chairman Odongo Tejani's office in Site-02 and transcribed by a developer build of ethistician.aic with experimental updates to emotion-recognition.\n\n\n\n\nChairman Tejani returns from a routine trip to the lavatory to continue organizing the Ethics Committee\u2019s itinerary for the next \nand past\n few months. He pauses midway through the door.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026did I save?\n\n\nWith increased urgency, Chairman Tejani closes the door behind him and-\n\n\n???:\n MISTER TEJANI!\n\n\nA man bludgeons the door back open with a novel-thick manila folder just before the standard locks can engage. ethistician.aic identifies him as new recruit Jack Robinson, and his sudden entrance causes the Chairman to jump back in shock.\n5\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Holy-\n\n\nPA: \nINTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. SITE-02 HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.\n\n\nTejani and Robinson reflexively look at the ceiling as built-in alarms bathe the office in red light..\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Wh-where\u2019s the intruder?!\n\n\nPA: \nINTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. SITE-02 HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.\n\n\nTejani and Robinson make eye contact, and realization dawns on Tejani\u2019s face.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026ooooooh-\n\n\nPA: \nSAVE AND CLOSE YOUR WORK IMMEDIATELY. ALL TERMINALS WILL BE DISABLED IN: ZERO MINUTES.\n6\n\n\nThe chairman\u2019s expression transmutes to irritation, mirroring the groans coming from outside. He rolls his eyes and walks to the far wall to initiate a conversation. Robinson\u2019s demeanor indicates confusion: The lack of mirrors in the office means he cannot see the intruder.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n The Red Sun rises tonight.\n\n\nWALL:\n And the world is bathed in light.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n We make the sacrifice.\n\n\nWALL:\n So the world falls not to vice.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n May I proceed?\n\n\nWALL:\n Yes, Chairman.\n\n\nTejani begins entering a code into the wall.\n\n\nPA: \nFOUNDATION PERSONNEL: IF YOU ARE IN THE HALLS, PLEASE BARRICADE YOURSELVES IN THE SAFEST ROOM WITHIN VISIBLE RANGE. IF YOU ARE IN A ROOM, STAY THERE. LAW\u2019S LEFT HAND HAS BEEN DEPLOYED AND WILL SOON REACH WHERE THE INTRUDER WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED AT: CHAIRMAN TEJANI\u2019S OFFICE-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \nHere?!\n\n\nPA: \nFLOOR 5B-\n FALSE ALARM. PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR STATIONS.\n\n\nTejani turns around, crosses his arms, and stares at Robinson from behind his desk.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u2026oh.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Now, \nwhat\n was so urgent you had to trash the last \nthree hours\n of \npainful\n scheduling work \njust\n to inform me?\n\n\nRobinson shrinks away. His tone is identified as 14.5% confident, 23.4% harried, and 59.8% insecure. ethistician.aic analyses this as a false attempt to project confidence.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n It\u2019s telekill! Sir.\n\n\nRobinson hesitantly walks up to Tejani\u2019s desk, clutching his folder in both hands. He shuts his eyes, takes a deep breath, and with renewed confidence slams the folder onto the center. The duct tape holding the stack together tears and the papers spill, coating the whole right half of the desk \u2014 Robinson\u2019s right, and Chairman Tejani\u2019s left. Chairman Tejani, being left handed, happens to store his coffee on the left side of his desk.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u2026I\u2019ll get you another one.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Make it decaf.\n\n\nThe chairman picks up and peruses the papers as Robinson begins to speak.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Telekill alloy sucks the life out of everyone around it. \nEveryone\n who works at a Site that splashes the stuff around like paint will find themselves at increased risk for debilitating mental conditions. That\u2019s the clinical version. The \nreal\n version is that this stuff cancels out \nyour own psyche\n the same way it cancels any Keter brain-waves. We should\u2019ve known from the moment we figured out everyone made some kind of psi-field. It\u2019s dangerous \u2013 \nradiation\n dangerous.\n\n\nTejani nods idly.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n These things have been known for \nyears\n to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, hidden behind layers of blackboxing and redaction and clearance from \nthe very personnel who work with the stuff!\n Work \nnear\n the stuff! Build \nwith\n the stuff! This is years\u2019 worth of shameful negligence, and we have a responsibility to fix it. Luckily, I\u2019ve got a Five-Year Plan ready to go to get rid of \nall\n unnecessary telekill \u2013 it\u2019s all in the reports. It\u2019s gonna be expensive, but if we pull out a couple of our better-understood SCPs and factor in the improvements to employee quality of life, the numbers \njust\n about work out. First we declare Experimental Site-78 a lost cause and tear down the building, then we use one of the many safe, ethical options I\u2019ve laid out to go back into all the wires and-\n\n\nTEJANI:\n -tear out our most secure communications network.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Only the unnecessary parts! I wrote that up in the plan. I\u2019ll need an engineer to look at it, but it should preserve the security benefits and minimize contact!\n\n\nTejani puts the paper down, crossed his arms, and stares at Robinson.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n And you propose doing this to every\u2026 single\u2026\n\n\nThe chairman makes air quotes.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026\u201cunnecessary\u201d installation-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \nYes!\n Yes, that\u2019s \nexactly\n what I\u2019m proposing! Did you not hear-\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Your dramatic reveal of the known information in the SCP-7814 file? Yes, I heard it very well.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n The known information that \nthey don\u2019t let Ethics Committee members access!\n\n\nThe chairman types something on his computer.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Huh. I can see it just fine.\n\n\nRobinson stops dead in his tracks\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \nWhat?!\n\n\nThe chairman types some more on his computer.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Well, there\u2019s your problem. Someone in IT messed up and gave you Level 5 \nGeneral\n clearance. Don\u2019t blame \u2018em.\n\n\nRobinson does not visibly react to this information.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026Robinson? Hello?\n\n\nethistician.aic 74.5% confidence guess: Robinson is busy processing the previous information.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026look, it\u2019s fine. This \nis\n good work! \nReally\n good. You\u2026\n\n\nTejani shuffles some of the papers around.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026you really got everything. Except a concise summary. So maybe write one up before the vote, okay?\n\n\nTejani attempts to gather the papers. Some spill over, floating in the light breeze of the vents and coming to rest at Robinson\u2019s feet. He delicately, almost absentmindedly picks one up.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026and maybe send a digital file next-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u201cThe Human Cost of Telekill. Mavis Melanie et. al.\u201d\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Come again?\n\n\nRobinson continues to read off the report.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u201cAbstract: Sometimes I feel that telekill must have seemed like a godsend to the ones who first discovered it. Finally, the cruel, chaotic universe sends us our Excalibur to fight the gorgons and gargoyles it coughs up at us. As the years went by and the uses multiplied, it must have seemed more and more like the Foundation\u2019s holy grail. But I know better. The Foundation regarded it with apprehension at first, as we do all anomalies \u2013 and we should have held onto that.\n\n\n\u201cTelekill shields our minds from others\u2019 by dulling them all. Memories break down without amnestics, joy becomes comfort becomes hollowness, the shadows of our weaker selves grow long enough to eat the sun. Those who work it are crushed by it, and dying in the dark. And the metal hungers for more: one D-Class, every facility, every thirty days must lie bleeding on the altar, screaming as their mind is flipped inside out and stretched through every wire and beam of 148. In most use cases, it could be replaced by safer, more creative containment procedures \u2013 but that requires effort. So my colleagues and superiors insist it is impossible, citing logistics issues we\u2019ve thoroughly addressed, secrecy on details people \ndeserve to know\n, and \u2013 most insultingly of all \u2013 \nfinancial reasons.\n\u201d\n\n\nRobinson\u2019s voice becomes clearer and firmer as he goes on.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u201cWe are people of the greater good, but not every sacrifice is worth it. As much as our mission to the wider world, we have to consider the people carrying it out, too. Which is why I\u2019m breaking from professionalism and speaking to you directly, whoever you are: Most anomalies contained with telekill can be contained more safely, and sometimes more effectively, with creative containment strategies tailored to the anomaly itself \u2013 \nspecial containment procedures,\n if you will. And for the rest? One or two telekill facilities in every country will suffice, staffed by a rotating crew with additional benefits to mitigate the harm. The longer we wait to rectify our mistake, the harder it will be, the more expensive it will be, and the more harm will be done.\n\n\nRobinson finally looks up, fixing Chairman Tejani with a glare of determination.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u201cIn this paper, we will demonstrate the above beyond a shadow of a doubt. Mavis Melanie, dissenter of the Telekill Alloy Applications Team.\u201d\n\n\nRobinson lets his hand fall to his side. He is still clutching the paper: his grip has etched wrinkles into it. When he speaks, there is 12.3% grief, 23.6% anger, and 63.9% determination.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Eleven years ago, this paper was published to the \nFoundation Online Journal.\n It was deleted, and the authors were amesticized and reassigned. Eleven years, and every word became more and more true, and still we did nothing. We\u2019re the Ethics Committee. We keep our \nown\n people in line, and \nthis\n is way over-\n\n\n???:\n Oh, \nhi,\n Odongo!\n\n\nA third individual has burst into the room, bypassing the locks without triggering the alarm. Robinson swivels his head to look at them, and Tejani is immediately more alert.\n\n\n???:\n I\u2019ve got the \nfunniest\n work story that I just \nhave\n to tell you!\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Uh, we\u2019re kind of in the middle of some-\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Oh! Gene. Didn\u2019t\u2026 know you were coming here today!\n\n\nTejani smiles. He appears 17.6% confused, 24.6% relieved, and 50.1% apprehensive.\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d: Neither did I, but I knew since the story started \u2013 I mean \nreally\n started \u2013 two weeks ago, I \nhad\n to share this with someone. But it\u2019s classified ten different ways from Monday, so I got to asking: Who on Earth has the clearance for all this? And you know who I thought of?\n\n\nThe intruder closes the door as they speak. They jangle the locks in a particular way, to activate the Vacuum Seal mode, soundproofing the door, then pirouette on the ball of their foot to stare innocently at Tejani.\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d: You!\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Me?\n7\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026well, let\u2019s hear it! Just let me dismiss this-\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d: \nNonsense!\n He\u2019s one of you now, right? Surely he\u2019s cleared to know about us now, right?\n\n\nThe newcomer briefly wraps an arm around Robinson\u2019s shoulder and turns him to face Tejani, shaking him slightly for dramatic effect. Robinson opens his mouth to-\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d: So the story *really* started two weeks ago, but that\u2019s more like the climax. You see, about five years ago there was this enby down in Decommissioning who\u2026\n\n\n39:43 minutes of irrelevant conversation purged.\n\n\nGene:\n \u2026and we haven\u2019t heard a \u2018beep\u2019 from xem since!\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d lets out a hysterical laugh, slapping their hand against their knee and their calf against the desk they sit on. They are the only one. Tejani presumably exhausted his ability to feign laughter after Robinson\u2019s fifth attempt to interject on a violation of the Foundation Code of Human and Nonhuman Rights. He flits between giving Gene their expected eye contact and keeping a nervous eye on Robinson, who has produced an amount of sweat consistent with a hundred-mile marathon.\n\n\nAfter 54 seconds, Gene makes a face matching \u201ctasting a new food\u201d with 99.9% confidence. They acknowledge neither Robinson nor Tejani\u2019s response to him.\n\n\nGene:\n Huh. Tough crowd today.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n N-no, it \nwas\n a funny story, it\u2019s just that-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \nYou deployed a ghost. To give Ms. Darcy\u2019s father an anomalous disease. So she\u2019d stay on for the insurance.\n\n\nGene looks directly at Robinson for the first time.\n\n\nGene:\n I spin you a whooooole yarn, and you go for the leftover thread on the needle?\n\n\nROBINSON:\n It\u2019s the only human rights violation in the last half an hour I can summarize in less than half an hour.\n\n\nRobinson\u2019s tone is: 18.4% anger, 17.6% masking, 14.5% shock, 9.4% defiance, 5.1% hunger\u2026\n\n\nRobinson turns to the Chairman. ethistician.aic determines his intended tone as casual. Tone breakdown: 7.6% casual, 18.7% \u201cMTF commander giving orders,\u201d 65.6% \u201cscared child dangling from a ledge over SCP-682\u2019s pit screaming for rescue.\u201d\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Chairman! How long until your sandwich arrives?\n8\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026wha- oh, yeah. I said I would. The sandwich is\u2026\n\n\nTejani looks at his feet.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n \u2026[inaudible]\n\n\nROBINSON:\n What do you \nmean\n you forgot to order it.\n\n\nGene:\n Huh. If I didn\u2019t know better-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n You \nDON\u2019T!\n\n\nRobinson\u2019s shout echoes slightly against the sealed walls of the office.\n\n\nGene tilts their head curiously, examining Robinson as they would an SCP object. Then they turn their face to Tejani, giving an expression of 13.4% helplessness, 0.9% mirth, and no other identifiable emotions.\n\n\nGene:\n \u2026well. Guess I\u2019m busted. Any minute now, those left hands of yours\u2019ll \nburst\n down the door and put an end to our \nbeautiful\n friendship. Oh, if only I had just let all those employees scatter to the Serpent\u2019s Anus or the Glock Ock Coalition, or maybe the Four Winds Hunting Lodges\u2026 oh, Tejani, \nwhy\n did you approve all our playbooks and procedures\u2026\n\n\nNo changes in tone are discerned during this time.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n The Ethics Committee would never approve any of the words you just said.\n\n\nRobinson looks at Tejani. The latter avoids eye contact.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u2026Mr. Tejani?\n\n\nTEJANI:\n [inaudible]\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I can\u2019t hear-\n\n\nTEJANI:\n All of their Department\u2019s tactics, playbooks, and methods have been reviewed and approved by consensus of the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nSilence. Robinson\u2019s eyes widen.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n What?\n\n\nGene:\n It\u2019s true! Check the records. Oh! Yeah, I almost forgot:\n\n\nGene commandeers Tejani\u2019s monitor and makes an addition to the SCP-7814 file, narrating as they add.\n\n\nGene:\n \u201cSpecial Containment Procedures: As of\u2026 Incident 7814-Melanie-B\u2026 secrecy\u2026 of information\u2026 on SCP-7814\u2026 is under the jurisdiction of the \nFire Suppression Department.\n\u201d\n\n\nRobinson looks between Gene and Tejani, mouth gaping. Then he sits on the floor, clutching his head in a manner consistent with a migraine. Gene gestures toward him, turning to Tejani.\n\n\nGene:\n Is he gonna be okay?\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Gene.\n\n\nTejani smiles. Tejani shakes his head\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Gene. Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene\u2026\n\n\nTejani buries his head in his hands.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Gene\u2026\n\n\nROBINSON:\n What possible greater good could be served by that?\n\n\nHis words are slow, quivering. The emotion in Robinson\u2019s voice cannot be identified.\n\n\nTejani sighs, wipes his brow, and begins to speak.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n The Foundation\u2026 you know\u2026 it\u2019s very hard to find new hires. We need brilliant, brilliant people-\n\n\nGene:\n And all that \nexperience!\n You can\u2019t get that anywhere else! Literally. We-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Training programs.\n\n\nGene:\n Too expensive!\n\n\nRobinson shoots up into standing position.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I CAN THINK OF FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN GET THE-\n\n\nGene:\n And we rarely get defectors except from the GOC. And speaking of the GOC, how disastrous would it be if a high-level researcher went and spilled all our secrets? I\u2019m asking. Rate it from Notice to Critical, or one to five if you can\u2019t remember.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Yes, it\u2019d be quite the disaster if our number-one rival found out we have a gaslighting department\u2026\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Our work is too important. We have over five thousand anomalies in containment, Robinson. We need all hands on deck, and we need all hands to \nstay\n on deck. As\u2026 \ndisturbing\n as they can be, the Fire Suppression Department\u2019s methods work.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I can think of five different ways that work better-\n\n\nGene:\n All more expensive!\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Cheaper. Not so gratuitous. Not so cruel. Not so cheapest. Not so save-money. Not so not so not so\u2026\n\n\nRobinson becomes unresponsive for ten minutes. Tejani returns to working on his scheduling in the meantime.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n So you were the ones who messed with my clearance.\n\n\nGene:\n No, that was our good friend the typo!\n\n\nRobinson\u2019s expression is identified as: 14.3% confusion, 30.6% disbelief, 63.2% suspicion.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n So you got Melanie transferred out, right?\n\n\nGene looks up from their phone.\n\n\nGene:\n What?\n\n\nROBINSON:\n After the paper. \u201cIncident 7814-Melanie-B.\u201d\n\n\nGene:\n Oh- oh, no no no nononono. That was O5. We only got put on the case after the second little stunt. Incident 7814-Melanie-\nB\n. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t catch that!\n\n\nROBINSON:\n And the Ethics Committee\u2026 they approved that, too?\n\n\nTejani looks away.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n It was\u2026 within their jurisdiction. Employees were starting fires.\n\n\nGene:\n \u201cTransferred out\u201d is a bit of a strong word. You see-\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I don\u2019t want to know.\n\n\nRobinson clutches his forehead.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I \ndo\n want to know, but not right now.\n\n\nGene:\n Is there anything you \ndo\n want to know about right now?\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Why not just\u2026 let us take out the telekill? We\u2019ve already proven it\u2019s the better way.\n\n\nGene:\n I don\u2019t think your calculations are quite sound.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n They are sound. I\u2019ve got hundreds of pages detailing them.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Mr. Robinson, with all due respect, we can\u2019t afford the short-term costs.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n But you \ncan,\n I wrote a whole-ass dissertation on-\n\n\nGene:\n And are you sure you did you math right?\n\n\nROBINSON:\n You just explained the change-their-own-files-on-them tactic to me- it doesn\u2019t matter! What matters is the \nreal human lives-\n\n\nGene:\n -that we can secure, contain, and protect with every dollar we \naren\u2019t\n spending on unnecessary renovations.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Aren\u2019t you the keeper of the retirement gate? If you want to keep your assets, why not keep them healthy?\n\n\nGene:\n The effects of telekill aren\u2019t debilitating enough to justify the costs.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, OH! That is IT!\n\n\nRobinson stands and quickly moves toward the door.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n You\u2019re resigning?\n\n\nJust as Robinson\u2019s hand grasps the handle, he pauses.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n \u2026no. No, like hell I am.\n\n\nRobinson glares at the other inhabitants of the room.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n I mean, I should. But someone has to be the conscience of the Foundation, and since the Ethics Committee isn\u2019t \nethical\n anymore, I guess I\u2019ll have to do.\n\n\nRobinson leaves the handle alone and approaches Gene, whose smile remains unchanged.\n\n\nROBINSON:\n You\u2019re going \ndown.\n\n\nRobinson returns to the door and attempts to turn the handle.

Unauthorized access is strictly forbidden.\n\n\nIf you have accessed this section without authorization, close your session now and remain where you are.\n\n\nWe know how to find you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-880379017499EC\n\n\nISSUE:\n\n\n \nFor the last twenty years, Ethics Committee member Jack Robinson has vocally opposed FSD operations and tactics and mobilized a minority faction of the Committee to improve workplace safety, earning minor but significant restrictions on SCP-7814 (\u201cTelekill Alloy\u201d).\n\n\nKNOWLEDGE:\n\n\n \nWhile Robinson remains passionate about the leisure of Foundation assets beyond the provisions of the Foundation\u2019s core mission, he is ultimately loyal and does not pose a defection or retirement risk. Ethics Committee culture and bureaucracy have prevented most attempts to significantly restrict FSD operations or telekill use, and standard bureaucratic tactics such as compromise and subconscious suggestion have been sufficient to neuter the rest. Furthermore, Robinson\u2019s faction has proven a powerful outlet for disgruntled Committee members, with morally-motivated defections dropping by 28% and retirements by 33%.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED PROCEDURE:\n\n\n \nNone. Robinson is not a threat.\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n \nThis case is considered \nRESOLVED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The TAAT has Level 5/7814 clearance, allowing them access to all SCP files pertaining to applications of SCP-7814.\n\n\n2\n. Technical information classified Level 4/7814. To request Level 4/7814 information, contact the Telekill Alloy Task Force.\n\n\n3\n. Further information classified Level 4/7814. To request Level 4/7814 information, contact the Telekill Alloy Task Force.\n\n\n4\n. Technical information moved to Document 7814-A \"Telekill and You\" to expedite TAAT onboarding and investigations.\n\n\n5\n. This is not a figure of speech: Tejani maintained 0.9 seconds of airtime with a maximum height of 7.4\u00a0cm.\n\n\n6\n. The timer was supposed to be set to five minutes.\n\n\n7\n. From the intruder\u2019s position, Robinson should have blocked \u201cGene\u201d\u2019s view of Tejani. They did not appear to adjust for this.\n\n\n8\n. Earlier, Robinson had asked Tejani to \u2018order a sandwich,\u2019 adding \u2018make it the, uh, the LLH special from Omega One \u2018Oodstuffs, maybe some extra knuckles?\u2019 This is a bastardized version of the example codeword given in the Ethics Committee Emergent Situations Priming Pamphlet, and more easily cracked by any Foundation personnel with sufficient knowledge of Omega-01\u2019s designation, such as Gene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7813\n | SCP-7814 | \nSCP-7815\n \u00bb",

Among other things, I recordkeep, bookkeep, display available data in concise formats, display unavailable data in concise formats, and can even summarize!

Show me a graph of the number of D-Class on-site v.s. the year. ETHISTICIAN: On it! ETHISTICIAN: Created d-class-by-year-site-19.png. [ec-user-33308affc0e]: I'm eyeballing a sharper increase after the telekill wing. Am I seeing things? ETHISTICIAN: You are always seeing things, assuming your sight is intact. But no, the usage increases significantly after 2009, which is when the telekill wing was completed. ETHISTICIAN: This discrepancy can't be accounted for by increased contaiment subjects or testing rates, either. Would you like to download the full statistical report? [ec-user-33308affc0e]: Yes, and can you compile some other statistics on D-Class at 19 while you're at it? And D-Class at other sites with telekill stuff. Look for any significant correlations and report to me. ETHISTICIAN: Got it! [ec-user-33308affc0e]: Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some D-Class to interview\u2026 [ec-user-33308affc0e]: \u2026actually wait. If baseline humans produce psionic fields, how does telekill affect them? ETHISTICIAN: Presumably not at all. While baseline humans can produce psionic fields, only psychics are able to sense psionic energy, so baseline humans would not be affected",
