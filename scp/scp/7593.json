Investigations are underway throughout the hierarchy of Site-666 to uncover the actor(s) behind SCP-7593 and enforce containment procedures where necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7593 was a random, anomalous event culminating in the death of Site-666 director Randall House. House\u2019s corpse was discovered on December 22, 2005, in his office, under a pile of smoking rubble that fell from the ceiling. The corpse was mangled to a point of it being near unrecognizable. On a tattered part of House short was a partial, artificial burn, reading \u201cProverbs 29:20.\u201d\n1\n\n\nWhile there were no witnesses to the event, it is hypothesized that an unknown, divine entity smote House. The Department of Tactical Theology is working in conjunction with Site-666 to uncover if a deity or deities were at fault.\n\n\nInterviews with Tartarean entities have yielded no conclusive information, as the entities either were averse to discussions on the subject, or stated their pleasure in the fact House was deceased. While initial suspicion pointed towards Tartarean entities being at fault for SCP-7593, further discussions found that entities were content with the agreement between the Foundation and Undervegas; dissent was rare past mild dissatisfaction.\n\n\nThe investigation is ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 7593.1:\n Site Wide Meeting\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nSterling:\n Alright, I\u2019ll just cut to it. House is dead. The ceiling collapsed and he was crushed.\n\n\nThorner:\n The fuck?\n\n\nSterling:\n The ceiling \ncollapsed\n and he was \ncrushed\n. I know this comes as a shock, however, we\u2019re starting an immediate investigation because there\u2019s no way this was just random bad luck. Someone branded a bible verse on him post-mortem.\n\n\nAdams:\n What did it say?\n\n\nSterling:\n Something about how people who talk a lot are fools. As far as I know, Randall didn\u2019t talk to God, and even then, He should be able to tolerate the ramblings of House for an eternity longer than we can. We\u2019re going to need all hands on deck for the next few days.\n\n\nThorner:\n Is he\u2026? You know.\n\n\nSterling:\n What?\n\n\nThorner:\n Is he in Hell?\n\n\nAdams:\n Christ, Tess. Some tact maybe?\n\n\nSterling:\n We don\u2019t know yet.\n\n\n(A large plume of smoke erupts in front of Thorner. As it clears, a stubby humanoid reveals itself, holding a tattered cotton bag. It\u2019s nude, save for a damp, leather loincloth wrapped around its waist. Site staff recognizes the entity as Charon, the psychopomp.)\n\n\nSterling:\n What the fuck, Charon! How many times do I have to tell you to use the fucking door?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharon, as depicted by Michaelangelo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharon:\n Okay, whatever dude. I got my yearly lunch break and I\u2019m here to mangia.\n\n\n(Charon looks around the room.)\n\n\nCharon:\n What\u2019s going on? You guys look like someone just died.\n\n\nSterling:\n Randall did.\n\n\nCharon:\n Oh. \nOh.\n Oh Shit. My bad.\n\n\nSterling:\n What? What did you do?\n\n\nCharon:\n Yeah, the other day some dude kept yelling at me to look at him. Kept saying that \u2018I know him\u2019 and to \u2018bring him back now.\u2019 I recognized his face but I couldn\u2019t place it. Well, now I know. Funny how things work out like that.\n\n\nSterling:\n He\u2019s\u2014\n\n\n(Charon lifts a writhing fish out of its bag and gingerly places it in his mouth, immediately swallowing it whole.)\n\n\nSterling:\n He\u2019s in Hell?\n\n\nCharon:\n Yeah.\n\n\n(Charon reaches for another fish, eating it the same way as before.)\n\n\nCharon:\n I\u2019ll get more info and give you the deets. I have my money down on the sixth circle, maybe the seventh.\n\n\n(Charon reaches into his bag once more.)\n\n\nSterling:\n If I see another goddamn fish I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. I\u2019m sorry; I can\u2019t watch it anymore.\n\n\nCharon:\n Okay, xenophobe. Learn to respect other cultures.\n\n\nSterling:\n You know what? Leave. You\u2019re not allowed to take your lunch breaks here anymore. Blacklisted. If I see you again it\u2019s a containment chamber.\n\n\nCharon:\n No, no, no, no, wait. Come on, man. We\u2019re friends. We\u2019re Alice and Charon. Best buddies! Look, you know I head security down there. I\u2019ll hook you up with a monitor to watch House and we\u2019ll call it square. Deal?\n\n\nAdams:\n Hell has surveillance. Doesn\u2019t, like, God do that?\n\n\nCharon:\n That lazy bastard is more of a delegator than anything. \nI\n have to make sure no one escapes on top of my ferryman duties. It\u2019s tiring as\u2026 as Hell. Let me just go get the stuff.\n\n\n(Charon disappears with another plume of smoke.)\n\n\nSterling:\n I\u2019m very sorry about that. If you need to speak with someone about this incident, Dr. Mooney from 322 is visiting and is open for walk-ins. In the meantime, I\u2019m acting as interim director. You\u2019ll be assigned\u2014\n\n\n(Suddenly, a plume of smoke appears. As it clears, Charon reveals itself holding a mass of fire in the shape of a computer monitor.)\n\n\nCharon:\n I heard he was crushed by rocks. Sometimes in Hell, we get movies delivered down there. I heard it was like that scene in \nMidsommar\n with the guy and the cliff and the hammer. Like one of those hydraulic press videos. Like a watermelon crushed between the supple thighs of a large woman.\n\n\n(A few members of Site staff begin to cry.)\n\n\nCharon:\n Tough crowd.\n\n\nSterling:\n \n(Sigh.)\n Is that the surveillance system?\n\n\nCharon:\n Top of the line. 4k video, 440\u00a0Hz, 32 gigs of RAM. There are a lot of dead LAN gaming people in hell and they gave me the best specs for performance. This thing\u2019s a beast.\n\n\nSterling:\n Thank you. Here\u2019s the problem, though. I know demons can get carried away and put people in flaming pits for like seventy years. If that happens to House, are we just supposed to watch that?\n\n\nCharon:\n Yeah, for punishments like that it\u2019s not \nactually\n fifty years, much less time when you\u2019re watching it, the sinner just perceives it as however many years the demon decides. I can\u2019t remember the bullshit conversion right now but I\u2019m pretty sure one year is like half a minute. House is still passed out right now and as far as I know, he\u2019s in limbo for whatever reason. He should get his buddy soon.\n\n\nSterling:\n Alright. Is that all?\n\n\nCharon:\n I brought you guys these as another show of remorse. I have to go. Thanks! See you next year!\n\n\n(Charon drops its bag on the ground and vanishes in a puff of smoke. The bag contained thirty squirming fish of an unknown species.)\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nThe monitor Charon provided did not emit extreme heat nor did it require electricity to operate. After powering it on, the monitor opened to a directory of over 117,000,000,000 names. House\u2019s name was located utilizing the search function and the surveillance video of him was played.\n\n\nAddendum 7593.2:\n Day One Transcript\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n(The feed has a night vision filter on. House is lying on a ragged cavern floor. It\u2019s extremely dark in the cave, save for small beams of light peaking through small cracks in the cave wall. The sound of moaning and water dripping is heard.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Huh.\n\n\n(House takes a deep breath. And coughs)\n\n\nHouse:\n Wuh. Oh. Oh, come on!\n\n\n(House stands and glances around.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Satan! Lucifer! The Devil! Whatever the fuck you want to be called today, you already trapped me in Hell last month! The joke was funny the first eight times. It\u2019s enough now!\n\n\n(No response.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Hey! Dickhead! Don\u2019t bitch out on me now. I know what you\u2019re doing. Limbo this time? Really? At least make me suffer pain instead of boredom. You know I\u2019m unmedicated!\n\n\n(House paces through a small section of the cave, mumbling obscenities about Satan to himself.)\n\n\n(A large wall of fire suddenly appears, loudly roaring. House recoils from the heat and light. The flame expells and a small, red, bat-like humanoid appears in front of House.)\n\n\nDemon:\n Hello Mr. House, and welcome to Hell! The Worst Place Ever\u2122! I am the right dishonorable creature of malice and hate, Clydesdale!\n\n\nHouse:\n [\u2026] Clydesdale?\n\n\n(House begins to laugh. He immediately explodes, slowly reforming back into himself for thirty years. Clydesdale observes the entire time.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Is it funny now?\n\n\nHouse:\n I was conscious that whole time!\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Was that funny?\n\n\nHouse:\n Enough! It\u2019s enough. Tell your daddy that the joke is over and I need to make sure the degenerate partiers of his army are good boys and girls.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Joke? I don\u2019t see a joke here, Mr. House. You are \ndead\n. Dead like a corpse or a cadaver. Dead like a lobster dropped in a pot of boiling water. Dead like a dead guy. You died! We know all the sins and dastardly little deeds you committed throughout your meager life. Sinner sin sin sinner sin sin. EVIL BOY! RAT!\n\n\n(Clydesdale stabs House in the thigh with its horn.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Ow! What the fuck, man?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Sinner!\n\n\nHouse:\n How did I even die?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Big rock fall on little head.\n\n\n(Clydesdale makes a wet, squelching sound with its mouth.)\n\n\nHouse:\n I was crushed by rocks?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Yeah, was that not clear by the sound effect?\n\n\nHouse:\n No, it was. Just wanted to clarify. I had so much more to do though! I wanted to become an Overseer, I wanted to get married, I never saw X-Men three, I never got to go to the red light district! I got rid of the D-Class program. First site! They were bad guys! I did good things.\n\n\n(House appears to be suffering from a panic attack)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n I\u2019ll just let you have this one.\n\n\nHouse:\n Let me out, man. Come on! I shouldn\u2019t be in Hell! I was good. I did what I needed to do. You guys are literally the pinnacle of evil and I did everything to make sure you stayed where you are. That makes me good right? Working in opposition to evil. I\u2019m a hero! I didn\u2019t kill anyone either!\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Don\u2019t care. I\u2019m so happy I get to be your Hell Buddy\u2122! You can tell me the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n\nHouse:\n \u2014 I never finished that file on the Daeva. I got two 001 proposals out. \nTwo\n! Today that\u2019s like having none! Some jackass has four and is working on a fifth! I have so much I needed to do \u2014 What? Why would I ever tell you that?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Because we\u2019re going to be buddies for literally ever! Might as well tell me\u2026 now! Ooooooooh\u2026 now! Now!\n\n\nHouse:\n Just send me to my circle and let me suffer. I\u2019m not doing this.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Don\u2019t you love Christmas?\n\n\nHouse:\n Not particularly. Do you?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n No, I\u2019m a hell demon, why would I love Christmas? A lot of you humans just seemed to really enjoy it.\n\n\nHouse:\n It never really did anything for me. I grew up Muslim.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Oh.\n\n\n(House is immediately transported into what appears to be a flaming tomb, congruent to what is depicted in the Sixth Circle of Hell of Dante\u2019s Inferno.)\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7593.3:\n Site-666 Research\n\n\nAfter the above transcript was documented, a full investigation into House and SCP-7593 began. Personnel was split into four teams:\n\n\n\n\nThe Apostles; the aforementioned group working with the Department of Tactical Theology;\n\n\nThe Watch Party, focused on watching, transcribing, and analyzing the tapes from Charon;\n\n\nThe Virgins,\n2\n focused on a method of entering Hell and extracting House;\n\n\nThe Carolers, which focused on creating an artificial model that would produce the most likely answer to the question 'What is the true meaning of Christmas?'\n\n\n\n\nSterling, with the assistance of Maria Jones, ran a full download of House\u2019s personal and professional devices, eventually locating encrypted information regarding the true meaning of Christmas on his cell phone. During the weeks prior to his death, Director House had a running, apparently inside joke with himself, where he would ask people what they believed the true meaning of Christmas to be. Site personnel were unable to solve the question, which only increased House\u2019s enjoyment of the \u201cjoke.\u201d House would continue to mention that no one would \u201cget the answer\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s absolutely baffling that it works out.\u201d\n\n\nThe current hypotheses were that House had either made up that he knew the answer or was using a form of inductive reasoning to connect an element of his personality to the yuletide holiday. With Site-7's personnel database providing an expansive report on Randall House's personality, FIGGY-PUDDING.aic was created and fed House\u2019s data. Below is a truncated list of its findings utilizing House's likes and dislikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nAssociation Variable to the Potential Meaning of Christmas\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\n\n\n56.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMafia dramas\n\n\n34.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing a beard\n\n\n20.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn honest day's work\n\n\n1.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the New Republic\n\n\n49.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking in conjunction with Site-43's Dr. Harry R.

Five years pass until Clydesdale scurries toward House\u2019s coffin. It leans towards the lid, a smile growing on its face as it listens to House\u2019s screams.)\n\n\n(Suddenly, House is laying in the fetal position on a black sandbank. His skin is charred and smoking. In front of him, a large river of blood boils. House continues to whimper.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Hello again Mr. House! You smell scrumptious.\n\n\n(House does not respond, only whimpering and crying.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Okay. I see you may have been driven insane. That happens! I forget how weak and feeble and meager your little human soul-brain is. I\u2019ll make you a deal, if I fix you you\u2019ll tell me the true meaning of Christmas. Lay there and cry if you agree.\n\n\n(House continues crying.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Yay! I love quid pro quos.\n\n\n(Clydesdale snaps, and House is immediately healed and ceases his crying.)\n\n\nHouse:\n You\u2014 you can just cure someone being driven insane?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Yeah.\n\n\nHouse:\n Why would you have that power? What reason in the universe does that need to be a thing you can do?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n So I can do this!\n\n\n(House is transported back into the coffin for another five years.)\n\n\n\n\n(House is once again returned to the black sand embankment. Clydesdale snaps once more, and House returns to his normal state, albeit with slight behavioral differences.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Mr. House, can you tell me the true meaning of Christmas, now? Pretty please. Pretty please with a cherry on top.\n\n\n(Clydesdale glares at House. Its eyes glow red.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Pretty please\u2026 with a \u2014 what the fuck \u2014 woman with a robotic arm on top? What the fuck, Randy? Amputees?\n\n\nHouse:\n Shut up!\n\n\nClydesdale:\n I thought that would work. You weirdo.\n\n\nHouse:\n I\u2019m not telling you the true meaning of Christmas. It took me way too much time to find it and I\u2019m not giving it up. Stop asking me!\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Okay, bitch. Damn.\n\n\n(Clydesdale goes quiet.)\n\n\nHouse:\n What? Are you upset now?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Can you at least give me a hint?\n\n\nHouse:\n No.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Maybe you need some persuading. You see Mr. House, this is the sixth circle of Hell: Violence. Ooooooooh, scary! Your little organization commits atrocities and you reap the rewards, you naughty boy. \nThis\n is where all you and your coworkers go, no matter how good or how bad. Except for that one guy with some tacky necklace. He got sent to the lust circle real fast. But other than him! This is where you will stay for eternity.\n\n\nHouse:\n Okay?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n I\u2019m willing to make another deal. I will not throw you into that boiling pool of blood and grossness if you tell \nhim\n the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n\nHouse:\n Who?\n\n\n(From the river of blood, a human form rises and crawls onto the sand. Clydesdale blows on the form, removing all of the blood and revealing it to be House\u2019s grandfather, Rustin House.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Oh God, that\u2019s fucked up.\n\n\nHouse:\n It\u2019s too cold\u2026 put me back. I want to go back in.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Mr. House.\n\n\nHouse:\n What?\n\n\nHouse:\n What?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n No, newer House. Tell your grandfather the true meaning of Christmas or I will poach you like an egg in that blood.\n\n\nHouse:\n I\u2019m not telling you or him shit. I was a pacifist as much as I could be; you can\u2019t put me in here. I prayed like twice in my life. I never killed anyone directly.\n\n\nHouse:\n I killed so many people. I once put one of those D-Men in a big machine and turned it on then he died. I knew he would too! One time we went into a city and killed everyone with harpoon guns because they saw a big fish in the sky and we didn\u2019t want anyone knowing about the big fish. It was a cod. I set people on fire!\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Mr. House\u2014\n\n\nHouse:\n Yeah?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Fuck. The other one.\n\n\nHouse:\n Once there was this statue and we put those D-Guys in there they shined a big bright light at them so they would close their eyes. They all died. It was fast, I promise. Oh. Did you say something, ma\u2019am?\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Mr. Older House, do you have any idea about the true meaning of Christmas?\n\n\nHouse:\n Oh Christmas. One time, it was Christmas Day I\u2019ll never forget, we gave the D-People some turkey and mashed potatoes and peas and\u2026 uh\u2026 turkey but we laced it with a chemical we were testing out to make people forget stuff and they all died too. It wasn\u2019t fast that time.\n\n\nHouse:\n I haven\u2019t done nearly the amount of awful things he\u2019s done.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n Whatever, fuck this! Your bloodline always sucked. How did anyone listen to your orders? You're pissing me off.\n\n\nHouse:\n Tell that to literally everyone who ever spoke to me. Especially the Alchemy Department.

Doesn't seem too fair to me. How about this? You\u2019re a man who's always open to deals, right?\n\n\n(Satan doesn\u2019t respond.)\n\n\nHouse:\n I know you are. Not getting tortured isn\u2019t enough, Lucy, I need something better. Come on. Come on, Lucy. Be a pal.\n\n\nSatan:\n Like what?\n\n\nHouse:\n Seems like your entire army, including you, wants to know this little secret I have. I\u2019m not giving it up unless you give me a do-over on life. That dingus over there set me on fire and exploded me for sixty years, and still not a peep. My lips are sealed.\n\n\nClydesdale:\n He\u2019s a sick fuck.\n\n\nJudas:\n Real hardass this one.\n\n\nBrutus:\n I know right?\n\n\nSatan:\n Fine. I\u2019ll take your deal.\n\n\n(Satan grips House and rips him and his chains out of the wall, holding him close to its eyes.)\n\n\nSatan:\n But listen here, boy.\n\n\nHouse:\n Hah! He said it. You really do sound just like him.\n\n\nSatan:\n If you trick me, you\u2019re coming to the ice. And you won\u2019t get the luxury of being thawed out. Ever.\n\n\n(House is placed down. His injuries are instantly healed and he stands up.)\n\n\nHouse:\n The true meaning of Christmas. Don\u2019t ask me how I figured this out, but, you know when you [DATA EXPUNGED], more specifically when you [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSatan:\n [\u2026] Yeah?\n\n\nHouse:\n That feeling right before. If you look at the brain on Christmas day and [DATA EXPUNGED], the parts that flare up are exactly the same. That\u2019s the true meaning of Christmas, the feeling right before [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSatan:\n Eeeeeeew. \nEeeeeeew,\n that's so yucky. No way. \nNo way\n that's real. Why \nthat\n of all things. Augh. You're fucking with me. \n(It laughs.)\n You have to be.\n\n\nHouse:\n I have literally no reason to be fucking with you.\n\n\nJudas:\n That's disgraceful.\n\n\nSatan:\n I know right? It's so good. Only if it was real.\n\n\nHouse:\n I\u2019m not joking.\n\n\nSatan:\n Nah, no way. I don't believe you. You're a little trickster sprite.\n\n\nHouse:\n I swear to you and God. That\u2019s the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n\n(Clydesdale floats over to House. It stares at him, eyes glowing red.)\n\n\nClydesdale:\n It's real! He's telling the truth! That's the true meaning of Christmas!\n\n\n(The crowd of demons uproariously laugh and cheer. Many of them high five and hug.)\n\n\nSatan:\n Alright! Yeah! Woo hoo! That\u2019s another point on the board for us. Go Hell!\n\n\n(Satan turns to the cheering crowd.)\n\n\nSatan:\n Can I get a hell yes!?\n\n\n(The crowd chant \u201cHell Yes\u201d back at Satan.)\n\n\nHouse:\n Can I go now?\n\n\nSatan:\n Yes. Thank you, boy. That made my millennia.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, the surveillance system showed a 404: Not Found error. There was a sudden explosion in House\u2019s office. A security team raced to the office, finding it entirely engulfed in flames. Utilizing extinguishers, the fire was snuffed. House was then heard screaming under a pile of rubble in his office, demanding that he be removed from the pile so that he could see a doctor, a therapist, and a priest as soon as possible.\n\n\nHouse was sedated and placed in Site-666\u2019s infirmary for observation. All apparent physical, mental, and emotional injuries had healed upon House's return to the mortal world.\n\n\nAddendum 7593.6:\n Final Incident\n\n\nOn December 25, 2005, a box wrapped in red and white wrapping paper manifested in House's office. The box had a thin layer of frost along the top of it. House opened the gift, finding three kilograms of solid gold, a six-pack of beer, an all-expenses paid trip to Amsterdam for four, and a photograph of him and his grandfather. Taped to the bottom of the box was a letter written to House. It read as follows:\n\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Randall House,\n\n\n \nI am very sorry for the trouble you dealt with over the past few days. I hope these gifts are worth a smidgen of the pain and suffering that you went through. Please know that Satan is at the top of my naughty list again and will remain there. I don't know why I thought he changed. I am so sorry Mr. House. I humbly ask you not to tell anyone else about the thing. I'm gross and I know.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n- Santa\n\n\n\n\nHouse refuses to decrypt the file on his findings regarding the true meaning of Christmas. By joint agreement of the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, House has been allowed to keep the true meaning of Christmas a secret.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \"Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.\"\n\n\n2\n.

Personnel was split into four teams:\nSterling, with the assistance of Maria Jones, ran a full download of House\u2019s personal and professional devices, eventually locating encrypted information regarding the true meaning of Christmas on his cell phone. During the weeks prior to his death, Director House had a running, apparently inside joke with himself, where he would ask people what they believed the true meaning of Christmas to be. Site personnel were unable to solve the question, which only increased House\u2019s enjoyment of the \u201cjoke.\u201d House would continue to mention that no one would \u201cget the answer\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s absolutely baffling that it works out.\u201d\nThe current hypotheses were that House had either made up that he knew the answer or was using a form of inductive reasoning to connect an element of his personality to the yuletide holiday. With Site-7's personnel database providing an expansive report on Randall House's personality, FIGGY-PUDDING.aic was created and fed House\u2019s data.
