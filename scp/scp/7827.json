SCP-7827 is composed of circular sapphires, set inside of copper lining.\n\n\nWhen a human female applies SCP-7827 to their earlobes, SCP-7827 will forcefully adhere itself to them and is unable to be removed through traditional means. Shortly after, the individual will enter a delirium where they are effectively paralyzed.\n\n\nAfter 3 minutes of contact with the earlobe, copper wiring will begin stemming from the object\u2019s base. It will then navigate towards the subjects brain via ear canal at a speed of 12cm/min. If successful, SCP-7827 will began lacerating the occipital lobe, which leads to the victim's death. Once expired, SCP-7827 will swiftly return its wiring before ejecting itself towards the ground, where it will remain inactive.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-7827 was initially recovered inside a residential apartment belonging to Beverly Rodriguez in Phoenix, Arizona. Beverly\u2019s remains were discovered contorted on her living room floor, where a field agent discovered SCP-7827 laying nearby.\n\n\nFollowing SCP-7827 containment, Beverly\u2019s phone revealed a series of text messages exchanged with Mason Dewitt, Beverly\u2019s ex boyfriend. The following are the excerpts most relevant.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0CHAT\u00a0LOGS\u00a0-\u00a004/12\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmassey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey mason\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaddup bee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen.
