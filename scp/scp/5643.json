Any personnel who wish to interact with SCP-5643-A must receive permission from the Site Director. Personnel handling the object are to wear heavy duty gloves. Any personnel that come into direct skin contact with SCP-5643-A should be subject to immediate psychological evaluation and will not be permitted to access the object again.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B is housed in a standard humanoid containment cell. It is to be provided with pain medication every 8 hours. If SCP-5643-B complains of a worsening headache, it is to be sedated. Guards outside the cell must be equipped with headphones containing cognitohazard filters. At no time should it be allowed to access SCP-5643-A.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5643-A is a shard of obsidian measuring roughly 2x2x0.5\u00a0cm. Regardless of its environment, SCP-5643-A is conspicuous to human subjects.\n\n\nWhen SCP-5643-A is in contact with a subject's skin, the subject will experience a feeling of euphoria. Upon separation from the object, the subject will experience symptoms including irritability, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, and increased anxiety. Psychological changes similar to those upon secondary exposure may occur in certain individuals. These symptoms will subside after approximately two weeks if the object is not touched again.\n\n\nUpon secondary exposure, subjects will undergo various permanent psychological alterations, which can include lessened empathy and changes in personality. After this stage of exposure, subjects will experience an addiction to the object's effects.\n\n\nAdditional exposure to SCP-5643-A will result in severe psychological alterations, paranoia, deterioration of motor functions, migraines, and blue to black skin discoloration.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B is a caucasian female formerly known as Dr. Mara Hyde. Prior to its containment, it worked as a Foundation researcher. Due to extended exposure to SCP-5643-A, its arms are significantly discolored. In addition, it suffers from chronic migraines.\n\n\nWhen its pain reaches a certain threshold, vocalizations it produces will create a mildly euphoric effect for human subjects nearby, followed by headaches, dizziness, and confusion.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5643-01:\n Texts between SCP-5643-B and Dr. Matthew Hyde recovered after containment. All other text messages on its phone had been deleted prior to retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n05/04/20\u00a012:04 PM\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Fuck.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Matt, pick up.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Matt.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Let's talk.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n What do you want?\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n I'm in the middle of something\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Can it wait?\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Fine.\n\n\n\n\n05/04/20\u00a06:13 PM\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Still doing something?\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Yes\n\n\n\n\n05/05/20\u00a09:00 AM\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n I can talk now\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n What is it?\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n I'm tired of this.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n All of this.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Is this about her?\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n What do you think?\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n You've gotta get over her\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Move on\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Easy for you to say.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Only way to feel better is to move on\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Yeah, fuck you, too.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n It's the truth\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n I just want you to feel better\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Focus on work more in the meantime\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n That's difficult.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Yes, but this isn't healthy\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n I guess.\n\n\n[Reports indicate that SCP-5643-B first came in contact with SCP-5643-A on 05/06/20.]\n\n\n\n\n05/06/20\u00a05:18 PM\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n You were right.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n She would want me to move on.\n\n\n05/07/20\u00a06:02 PM\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n You doing okay?\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n I feel better.\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Already?\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n That was quick\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n I don't want to talk.\n\n\n\n\n05/07/20\u00a07:00 PM\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n You're not okay, are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5643-02:\n A transcription of a phone call between Dr. Hyde and SCP-5643-B on 05/09/20.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Hey, Mara.\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Hey\u2026\n\n\nDr. Hyde:\n Everything alright?\n\n\nSCP-5643-B:\n Yeah, just a headache.
