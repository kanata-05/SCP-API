View is of the entrance of the shopping mall. Two figures surround Officer Millian; officers Florim Henderson and Sivan Groeten.>\n\n\n<Another figure, identified as Julius Neng, enters the frame. They are accompanied by a dog.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Everything in order, guys?\n\n\nHENDERSON:\n Yes.\n\n\nGROETEN:\n All clear here.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Camera pans to Neng.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n How\u2019s Christel?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Neng pats the dog.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNENG:\n Better than ever.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Camera pans back to the entrance.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n All right.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<They enter the structure. All of them turn their flashlights on.>\n\n\n<The air is thick, with dust being riled up with every step they take, illuminated by their beams of light.>\n\n\n<Groeten is heard to cough for an extended period of time. Their flashlight beam remains static, not advancing any further into the darkness.>\n\n\n<The others turn back to look.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Everything fine, Groeten?\n\n\nGROETEN:\n Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s jus\u2014 \n(coughs)\n Fucking dust\u2026\n\n\nHENDERSON:\n This is an old place after all.\n\n\nGROETEN:\n Yeah\u2026 kinda figured.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<They advance further into the structure. They pass run-down shops, trash and dried-up leaves littering the floor.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHENDERSON:\n How many squatters you think lived here?\n\n\nGROETEN:\n You mean still live here?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Groeten\u2019s flashlight beam rests on a sleeping bag and a few cans.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Focus.

It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been here, I almost forgot how big it was\u2026\n\n\nGROETEN:\n That\u2019s how old you are?\n\n\nHENDERSON:\n Shut u\u2014\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Neng, is your dog smelling anything?\n\n\nNENG:\n Sadly, Christel hasn\u2019t yet. We\u2019ll be on the lookout, though.\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n \n(sighs, mutters) Christ almighty\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<There is the loud clammering of a metal can falling to the floor. The noise comes from afar, echoing down the halls. The team immediately turns to look.>\n\n\n<There is silence amongst the team for a few seconds.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Hello?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<No response.>\n\n\n<After a while, Millian ventures deeper into the darkness. The other team members follow suit.>\n\n\n<They pass broken-in shop windows and more trash littered on the floor.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n You seen anything?\n\n\nGROETEN:\n Nope.\n\n\nHENDERSON:\n Nothing.\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Neng?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Neng tries to calm his dog, which is visibly uncomfortable.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNENG:\n Christel\u2019s reacting to something, but I don\u2019t know what.\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n That must mean we\u2019re close to something. \n(turns)\n Henderson, Groeten, you two take the left\u2014\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<There is a clattering noise coming from the distance, slowly nearing toward the team.>\n\n\n<The shallow light that reaches into the edges of the hallways reveal the noise to be a rolling metal can.>\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n<Noises of a struggle and muffled screams begin to be audible in the distance. Neng\u2019s dog whimpers. Millian rushes down the hallway, followed by Groeten. Henderson does not move.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Get your fucking ass over here, Henderson! Let\u2019s go!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Henderson finally moves toward the others.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGROETEN:\n \n(to Millian)\n Who do you think it is?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<No response. Millian continues running.>\n\n\n<They arrive at a dilapitated clothes store. Ragged clothes and dusty shelves line the walls and floor. The ceiling tiles are entirely missing in some areas, with thick black cables hanging loosely above.>\n\n\n<Millian aims his flashlight around everywhere. Groeten and Henderson catch up to him.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGROETEN:\n \n(out of breath)\n Found\u2026 anything\u2026?\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Help me search.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The members search around the area.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Groeten, found something?\n\n\nGROETEN:\n Nothing.

Maybe we should\u2014\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n Don\u2019t you dare start this with me.\n\n\nGROETEN:\n \u2014resume this tomorrow!\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n \n(shouts)\n You heard what I heard! We can\u2019t just leave!\n\n\nGROETEN:\n Markus, listen to me. We can\u2019t continue the search in total dark. We come back tomorrow with more people. We could cover the whole area\u2014\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n \n(approaches)\n You shut your mouth right now! We continue this search, no matter how late in the night it gets. And we\u2019ll do it\u2014\n\n\nHENDERSON:\n Oh, my God\u2026\n\n\nMILLIAN:\n \u2014until we\u2019ve found these missing people-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<There is suddenly a loud scream. Millian turns around; the noise comes from Henderson.>\n\n\n<Henderson quickly runs off without another word. Millian and Groeten look up; the black cables begin to twitch and slither around on the ceiling, like tendrils. A single large human-like eye stares down upon them.>\n\n\n<Everything is completely silent, except for the heavy breathing of the men.>\n\n\n<The eye closes, vanishing in the darkness.>\n\n\n<The black tendrils suddenly shoot out at the two. They run away, but one of the tendrils is able to grab Groeten by the ankle. He subsequently hits the floor.>\n\n\n<He screams.>\n\n\n<Millian, at the exit of the store, returns, and holds onto Groeten\u2019s arms. He attempts to pull him out of the mass of tendrils slowly enveloping him.>\n\n\n<An enlarged upper jaw of a human, containing human teeth and bleeding gums, emerges from the shadows. It positions itself above Groeten, before clasping down on him.>\n\n\n<Millian stumbles back; when he turns to look again, he is holding onto the bisected upper half of Officer Groeten. A trail of blood leads into the shadows, where the lower section of Groeten and the jaw have presumably gone to.>\n\n\n<The face of a young boy emerges from the darkness, completely pale.\n4\n>\n\n\n<Millian\u2019s breathing becomes more exaggerated, shallow.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8939:\n \n(in young boy\u2019s voice)\n Daddy?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Millian immediately stands up and sprints away.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8939:\n Daddy! Come back! \nDaddy!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<He continues running. He looks back; black arm-like appendages move toward him, elongating indefinitely. He sprints quicker now.>\n\n\n<Millian treads familiar ground. Just as he is about to outrun the appendages, Millian trips and falls to the dusty floor. He looks back, the carcass of a dog visible on the edge of view.>\n\n\n<Millian haphazardly pulls out his firearm and discharges a few rounds at the appendages; they retreat back into the darkness.>\n\n\n<All of a sudden, footage becomes more and more distorted.>\n\n\n<Thin, tall standing, jet-black, roughly humanoid figure enters view.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8939:\n \n(echoes) Pretty soon you\u2019ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don\u2019t shine!\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The entity remains standing motionlessly and staring at Millian. His breathing intensifies.>\n\n\n<Millian aims his firearm at the figure; the firearm jams inexplicably.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8939:\n \nPretty soon you\u2019ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don\u2019t shine\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Unidentifiable black mass, roughly humanoid, lunges at Officer Millian.>\n\n\n<Footage cuts out.>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[END RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX [8939-004] - INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW 8939.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 01/20/2025\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Site-67\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Adam Krug\n\n\nINTERVIEWED:\n Officer Florim Henderson\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n After the above footage was recovered, the only survivor of the incident was identified, and an interview was promptly conducted.\n\n\nDr. Adam Krug posed as a true crime podcaster for the purposes of this interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<Extraneous footage removed.
