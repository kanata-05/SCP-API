Allow me to just quickly check your personnel file\u2026\n\n\nFollowing conviction on the grounds of manslaughter and conspiracy with a hostile group of interest, you have opted to transfer over to Surrealistics rather than undergo termination. Excellent choice!\n\n\nNow, in order to prepare you for your duties as a Surrealistic, it's vital that we realign your rational paradigm. Now I know that sounds nasty, but worry not! It's a very simple procedure. You'll notice the necessary IV has already been inserted and a set of files has been put in front of you.\n\n\nAll you need to do is transcribe the anomaly described in these documents as an SCP file. I will adjust the dosage of agnostics being fed to you between each attempt until you reach correct understanding of the anomaly in question. This will indicate your rational paradigm has been correctly realigned.\n\n\nLet's do our best!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRATIONAL ALIGNMENT:\n A=A\n\n\nORIENTATION TYPE:\n VOLUNTARY\n\n\nSUPERVISOR:\n SALVADOR.AIC\n\n\nRATING:\n 8\n\n\nCOLOUR:\n GREEN\n\n\nTEETH:\n YES\n\n\nADJUSTING DOSAGE\u2026\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5145 is currently contained within a portable emergency holding cell at Site-22. Personnel suffering from recent personal loss are to remain at least fifty meters away from SCP-5145 at all times. Psychological counselling is to be conducted regularly with personnel assigned to SCP-5145 to ensure they do not become susceptible to its effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5145 is an intangible entity resembling an indistinct humanoid figure perpetually floating one meter off the ground. Although SCP-5145's body has not moved from its original position since manifestation, it is capable of exerting physical force over a distance of fifty meters around itself. This takes the form of susceptible individuals being instantly shredded by an indistinct mass of small black objects which disappear several seconds later.\n\n\nAnalysis of information provided regarding personnel who have been killed by SCP-5145 suggests that targets are selected based on their level of emotional distress. No individuals with a neutral emotional state have been killed to date, while all who were killed had recently been made aware of a personal loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHm \u2026 well, for a first attempt this is pretty good, but it's also really quite awful.\n\n\nYou've written down \nwhat\n our friend here does, but there's nothing about how or why! Understanding, man, understanding! That's what Surrealistics is all about.\n\n\nBut I have faith in you.

Any personnel found obeying the Seeing Eye are to be reassigned to Surrealistics or incinerated. Should SCP-5145 be terminated, personal heating will be required. There will be no funeral.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5145 is an eight-year old girl residing six feet under inside a shielded containment chamber inside Site-010. The emotional state of SCP-5145 is linked directly to the Sun \u2014 emotional distress will result in solar dimming, while excitement will result in intense solar flares capable of annihilating up to three-hundred D-Class personnel.\n\n\nDirectly pointed at Site-010 is a massive free-floating energy cannon, hereafter referred to as SCP-5145-1, hereafter referred to as the Seeing Eye.\n\n\nPeriodically, the Seeing Eye will release a telepathic demand to all surrounding organisms.

But don't worry, that's quite common!\n\n\nWhen you're first exposed to this level of agnostics, your memories often get muddled up with your present perceptions a bit. It's nothing to be afraid of, and it's really very cool.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't pertain to the anomaly you read about at all, but I'm sure we'll get there eventually.\n\n\nKeep on keeping on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRATIONAL ALIGNMENT:\n A=E\n\n\nORIENTATION TYPE:\n VOLUNTARY\n\n\nSUPERVISOR:\n SALVADOR.AIC\n\n\nRATING:\n -6\n\n\nCOLOUR:\n BEIGE\n\n\nTEETH:\n YES\n\n\nADJUSTING DOSAGE\u2026\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Zenzizenzizenzic\n1\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5145 is currently contained within a portable emergency holding cell at Site-22.

This will result in the death of SCP-5145-1, the destruction of SCP-5145, and an inevitable logical collapse cascade.

As a result of this dissonance, a backlash effect occurs and shreds the offending emotional generator.\n\n\nBy realigning rational paradigms, an emotional generator has been prepared with a correctly-shaped emotional profile to seal SCP-5145.
