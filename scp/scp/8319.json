All mentions are to be archived and removed.\n\nAll known SCP-8319-1 instances are to be housed within Site-987. Only Foundation employees with XY sex chromosomes are allowed within this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8319 refers to a collection of circular tablet pills. SCP-8319's packaging consists of a white circular bottle with a twistable lid, and a printed-on label that reads the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSu-Girl Pills\n\n\nYour life will be sugar spice, and everything nice!\n\n\nProduced by Just Girly Things\n\n\nVisit our website at www.justgirlythings.\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny individual who has XX sex chromosomes who ingests one individual instance of SCP-8319 will begin to experience a series of vivid hallucinations. Individuals who ingest SCP-8319 have been designated SCP-8319-1. SCP-8319-1 have displayed an inability to differentiate the effects of SCP-8319 from reality. This fact has made it difficult to determine exactly what these hallucinations entail. When SCP-8319-1 instances were asked to describe their experience on SCP-8319, the majority used one or more of the following phrases: \nCute, pink, dream like, happier, perfect, glittery, better\n. All instances of SCP-8319-1 have all displayed symptoms of a perpetual dissociative state. SCP-8319 has been noticed to change the behavior of those who ingest it, causing them to be less emotional and more compliant. Most SCP-8319-1 appear to be fond of \nGOI-4319 \u201cJust Girly Things\u201d\n and the ideals it promotes, although it is unknown how many are actually members. It has been determined that the more of SCP-8319 that an individual digests, the worse this state becomes. As time passed, SCP-8319-1 individuals develop trouble recalling their lives prior to ingesting SCP-8319. It is currently been deemed impossible to nullify the effects of SCP-8319. It is unknown how many SCP-8319-1 instances there are as of current.\n\n\nSCP-8319-1 instances will continuously attempt to advertise SCP-8319 to any individual with XX sex chromosomes until they agree to try SCP-8319. It has been observed that SCP-8319-1 are successful approximately 98% of the time. It is not known what causes this effect, or what causes an individual to be immune to it. SCP-8319-1 instances are capable of producing bottles of SCP-8319 to give to the individuals they advertise to through unknown means. SCP-8319-1 have not been observed to manifest SCP-8319 any other time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: SCP-8319 Origins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Foundation Web-Crawler Delta 532's search of the web, it discovered multiple notable cases of SCP-8319 being discussed online. The first discussion of SCP-8319 was traced back to a forum titled Wandering Souls, a forum dedicated for individuals to discuss their mental health.\n\n\nUser \u201cElla Romero\u201d has been determined to be POI-1943 from GOI-4319.\n\nUser \"laceyribbon\" was unable to be traced. This is concluded to be due to GOI-4319's ability to obscure the personal information of its members.\n\n\nThe following documents the recorded information.\n\n\n\n\nInformation\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/u\n \nlaceyribbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cry for help IG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi. I'm new here. And I'm probably not gonna post again but I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm at a fucking loss here. I'm a 19 year old girl who still lives with her parents because a minimum wage job doesn't pay for housing, and I almost killed myself when I was still in college. My parents never shut up about the fact that I dropped out of college. Like sorry but I was so fucking close to just downing my fucking Risperdal one night because I had SO MUCH homework and I couldnt fucking understand some of it AND I had to work part time. I now work full time cause I have to help pay off my college fees and I'm going crazy. My medication has just made my anxiety worse but my mom fuckin makes me take my meds in front of her cause last time she found out I stopped taking them and says that the doctor said I need it and my meds make me like less \"difficult\" to deal with. But they just make my memory worse and make me tired. I'm fucking terrified of what my parents will do next because my mom is making me apply for college again and I'm just afraid I'm not ready. I'm terrified because they basically insinuated that I'm not gonna have a place to stay if I don't. This just feels like a nightmare. I don't know what I'm going to do. My parents are really scary people and I can't even get into all of it. I don't have any irl friends, so moving in with a friend isn't an option. I don't even have many online friends because I'm so busy and don't usually have time to find places to belong. I wish I could just move out but it's so expensive to live on my own, and I just don't fucking have the money for it. I'm considering if it's even worth living anymore. I'm not even sure what I'm writing this for. I guess I just want people to know about me if I decide I can't do this. Um, thanks for reading.\n\n\n7 comments\n\n\n\n\nElla Romero\n\n\nOmg, you seem to be going through so much! Like, you're totally lost.
