Upper atrium windows of SCP-7898\u2019s containment are to be uncovered for a minimum of 5 hours per day, adjusted on overcast days to provide SCP-7898 sufficient sunlight. Atrium windows are to be covered and the containment area filled with aerosol sedative during Blood Sun cycles. Any new instances of SCP-7898 and SCP-7898-1 are to be incinerated. The town of Fields Spring has been demolished and its existence expunged from public record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7898-1 instance while dormant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7898 is an arachnoid parasitic creature that inhabits human bodies for locomotive and reproductive purposes. SCP-7898 nest in dark, dry, enclosed spaces, most commonly inside the walls and crawlspaces of houses, and subsist on sunlight\n1\n in a process similar to photosynthesis.\n\n\nSCP-7898-1 instances are the full human bodies used by SCP-7898 for locomotion. SCP-7898-1 instances retain the ability to move and speak similarly to non-anomalous humans, but lack many bodily functions including eating, drinking, and waste expulsion. SCP-7898-1 instances also seem incapable of experiencing or expressing negative emotions, even in response to physical pain or megadental events.\n\n\nSCP-7898 themselves measure between 15-25cm in length and typically weigh between 4-6kg\n2\n, depending on the age of the host, with six legs visually similar to a spider\n3\n. While any of SCP-7898\u2019s original sensory organs are not visible outside the carapace, observation suggests that SCP-7898 navigates using smell and hearing when not attached to an SCP-7898-1 instance.\n\n\nSCP-7898 was originally discovered in the town of Fields Spring\n4\n. There were no survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1 - Life Cycle of SCP-7898\n\n\nBased on discoveries from both Field Springs and Foundation experimentation, the observed life cycle of SCP-7898 is as follows.\n\n\nPhase 1:\n A mature instance of SCP-7898 will hide within the hollow walls of a building, most frequently a house, where it waits for a suitable host.\n\n\nPhase 2:\n The instance will break through the drywall from within, grab the head of the host, and use a sharp appendage to implant an egg in the host's ear.\n\n\nPhase 3:\n The host experiences mental fog, manic episodes, head/neck pain, and neck muscle weakness.\n\n\nPhase 4:\n The host feels compelled to keep their head inside small, dark places, such as under blankets or in containers.\n\n\nPhase 5:\n The host will force their own head through a wall, life signs cease.\n\n\nPhase 6:\n The host's head rips off at the neck and arachnoid appendages of a fully mature SCP-7898 instance emerge from the mouth, ears, and throat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7898 instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting SCP-7898 egg from host after implantation\n\n\nFailure, host subject experienced immediate brain death\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenial of a suitable nesting space to a growing SCP-7898 instance\n\n\nSubject attempts to break head through concrete wall, dies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumption of SCP-7898-1 instance\n\n\nSubject becomes severely ill and expires, SCP-7898 reclassified to Class W74 Inedible Corpse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7898-1 instance taken outside during a Rending event\n\n\nSCP-7898-1 instance increases dramatically in physical strength, infects 2 accompanying personnel before being terminated. Instance remains incinerated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure to unfiltered fresh water\n5\n\n\nNo notable effect beyond ordinary chemical burns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure to untreated seawater from the Panarctic Ocean\n6\n\n\nIntegrates with the water, becomes transmissible through any physical contact with the water as evident by multiple cases among attending staff. Water sample destroyed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This anomaly has been marked as a primary candidate for the developing Salvation Initiative, a program to temporarily reassign recently traumatized researchers to safer, less stressful anomalies, due to its low staff death rate and similarity to mundane and ordinary phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
