As soon as sequence is commenced, SCP-5566-A instances are to complete it without being interrupted. If sequence takes over five minutes to complete and instance of SCP-5566-A is in a public area, instances are to be escorted back to its containment without interruption. SCP-5566-A instances are allowed access to recreational facilities in their containment cells as well.\n\n\nUpdate 03-03-2019:\n SCP-5566-A instances cannot infect each other, and are thus allowed a common shared space even during the sequence.\n\n\nUpdate 07-03-2019:\n Recreational facilities that can be used as a means of communication are no longer allowed. Doors are to be locked as soon as sequence begins.\n\n\nUpdate 09-03-2019:\n Instances of SCP-5566-A are no longer allowed a shared space between them, nor can they keep pets. They must be locked up securely at all times. A separate containment area to provide food is attached to SCP-5566 containment cells. It is accessible to personnel from outside of the containment unit and to instances of SCP-5566-A. Doors to this area are to be locked whenever in use, and surveillance must be shut down for as long as any SCP-5566-A instance is in this feeding area.\n\n\nUpdate 01-04-2019:\n Personnel no longer allowed to disrupt SCP-5566-A containment areas. Supplying food without otherwise changing anything in the room is still allowed. At moments of lucidity, SCP-5566-A instances are instructed to dispose of its own physical disruptions created during the sequence.\n\n\nUpdate 14-04-2019:\n Researchers working on SCP-5566 in the future will have to go through an emotional screening. Highly empathetic researchers are unfit to observe SCP-5566-A instances.\n\n\nUpdate 14-07-2019:\n Instances of SCP-5566-B are to be kept in cells which can be locked from the outside. Surveillance will commence during specific times confirmed by Fibonacci sequence research to be safe time slots, or by trained/screened personnel who will refrain from turning off any surveillance apparatus.\n\n\nUpdate 28-08-2019:\n Time slots no longer accurate. Surveillance not to be turned off anymore.\n\n\nUpdate 30-08-2019:\n Surveillance apparatus should be plugged into a back-up generator at all times.\n\n\nUpdate 04-09-2019:\n Wounds inflicted by instances of SCP-5566 on itself while sequence is in action are to be left to heal on its own and ignored by medical personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Update 28-10-2019:\n All instances of individuals infected by SCP-5566 are to be locked up in an outside container without any access to food or human contact. Room is to be encased in cement and buried deep underground in an undisclosed location. Explicit warnings and contact information are to be included on or near the containment unit. Afterwards SCP-5566 is to remain neutralized - no attempt at research or containment is to be made.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5566 was a highly infectious anomalous verbal tic affecting a multitude of Foundation researchers. To this date, it is unclear what caused it and under what rules it operated. After an unusually high amount of failed research operations on the phenomenon, a - so far successful - attempt at total neutralization was made. It is theorized that, with the current procedures in place, SCP-5566 will unable to affect anyone anymore. Previous descriptions as well as research performed into the SCP-5566 phenomenon can be found in the addenda.\n\n\nAddendum 5566-1:\n Previous iterations of item description.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(1/3)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(1/3)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5566 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting humans, who are then dubbed an instance of SCP-5566-A. The first person observed to be infected by SCP-5566 is Elaine Fontaine (henceforth SCP-5566-A-1), a 26 year-old research assistant who was last active during a Foundation expedition to Europe and has been infected ever since. SCP-5566 presents as a strangely contagious verbal tic. SCP-5566-A-1 murmurs the phrase \"sank\" repeatedly in uncharacteristic tone of voice, until interrupted or a certain time has passed. The amount of times the phrase is said differs per sequence, but it generally increases in frequency over time.\n\nSCP-5566-A-1 stopped displaying its sequence after researcher Dr. Gill attempted to obstruct its mouth, after which it regained consciousness immediately. After this incident, SCP-5566-A-1 went back to displaying shorter sequences, and instances of sequences became considerably less frequent. An investigation to find similar methods of halting the phenomenon will be started by the research teams. This will hopefully result in finding a way to cure SCP-5566-A-1 of SCP-5566. SCP-5566-A-1 is considered safe as its sequences render it immobile, it has no history of violent tendencies and has a cooperative nature. Containment is purely meant to prevent the creation of other instances of SCP-5566-A.\n\n\nFollowing is a list of behaviors considered to be interruptions. Personnel are to frequently read up on these and make themselves familiar with them. This list is most likely incomplete and may be added to in the future.\n\n\n\n\nTalking with the intention of talking over or to SCP-5566-A, or using any other noise with the purpose of disrupting the sequence while it is being displayed.\n\n\nTurning off a surveillance camera and/or microphone while it is observing a sequence.\n\n\nObstructing the mouth of SCP-5566-A and other means of physically prohibiting the sequence to continue.\n\n\nExecuting SCP-5566-A; this will result in the killer becoming an instance of SCP-5566-A. However: if executed by a fellow SCP-5566-A instance, this does not happen.\n\n\nRemoving, hiding or altering images or writings made while in trance.\n\n\nTreating wounds inflicted during SCP-5566 trance.\n\n\nTouching remains of SCP-5566-A instances after its death during trance.\n\n\nOpening the door in response to knocking.\n\n\nWorking on infected instances with feeding tubes and other such equipment.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 03-03-2019:\n Medical teams have stopped their attempt at curing SCP-5566-A-1 after Dr. Gill started displaying a similar tic and is now assigned SCP-5566-A-4. Obstructing its mouth is henceforth seen as a interruption rather than a preventive measure. It has been noted that SCP-5566 sequences occur simultaneously between all the affected. Instances of SCP-5566-A cannot be interrupted by one another, and as such it has been decided to allow the infected a shared space between them.\n\n\nUpdate 07-03-2019:\n SCP-5566-A-2 displayed uncharacteristic behavior not previously observed in SCP-5566-A instances during a sequence. It moved to the area of the feeding room that the surveillance camera was currently focused on, and was able to write on the wall with paints that were previously allowed as recreational facility. SCP-5566-A-2 wrote a sequence of the number 5 on the wall. Reading these writings did not affect any of the personnel. Due to the nature of the phenomenon these numbers will stay put and no attempt to remove them from the wall will be made. Recreational facilities which can be used as a means of communicating are now prohibited. Due to its not previously observed unpredictable nature, SCP-5566-A has been re-assigned Euclid class.\n\n\nUpdate 09-03-2019:\n At the start of a sequence, SCP-5566-A-2 suddenly struck SCP-5566-A-4 in the neck with a pen, after which it attempted to use its blood as a means of communication by writing with it. It was unable to finish doing so before the sequence stopped. SCP-5566-A-4 calmly kept up the trance for the full duration of the sequence (6 seconds), after which it collapsed. Medical personal confirmed its death at 19.04 PM. All instances of SCP-5566-A are to be kept separately from now on. Recreational facilities that can be weaponized, as well as pets, are no longer allowed in the containment area.\n\n\nUpdate 12-03-2019:\n Two days have passed since SCP-5566-A-4 passed away. The sequence has not fully reset, and as such, the murder of SCP-5566-A by itself is not considered an interruption. However, an intern has suggested that the time between sequences might have been affected. The previous two in-between periods have both been roughly 61 hours as opposed to a steadily decreasing trend. Intern has been assigned the task to analyse the time it takes to complete a sequence as well as the time between two sequences.\n\n\nUpdate 16-03-2019; 10.50 AM:\n Ten instances of the phenomenon have been observed over the past 4 days. Only 30 minutes have passed between the previous two sequences, the latter of which was a sequence taking up 18 minutes to complete. Instances of SCP-5566-A are showing different signs of exhaustion and health starts to deteriorate. Intern has suggested the phrase's frequency to follow the Fibonacci sequence. Interpretation of this remains unknown, but has proven useful to tend to the needs of SCP-5566-A safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5566-2:\n Research report on Italy.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(Italy)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(Italy)\n\n\n\n\nAfter the suggestion that the phenomenon follows the Fibonacci sequence, a research team was sent to retrace previous expedition steps in Pisa, Italy, first. Research in Pisa unearthed two recurring stories; one featuring a murdered woman whose spirit is said to linger around, and the other providing a story about demonic presences in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta. It involves holes left in marble assumed to be made by the devil out of jealousy. It was said these holes are uncountable by mortals. This is believed to be relevant to the time and counting observation.\n\nSeveral locals reacted to questions about strange occurrences in Milan specifically. One local in Milan whose story seemed relevant to previous stories in Pisa agreed to a quick interview, as translated and transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Marco Manco, 45 years old, lives and works in Milan as a janitor, agreed to answer some questions during his lunch break.\n\n\nResearcher Hafkova: \"Are you aware of any strange occurrences in this area?\"\n\n\nMr. Manco: \"\u2026Strange occurrences?\"\n\n\nHafkova: \"Inexplicable, strange things, folklore.\"\n\n\nMr. Manco: \"Hm\u2026You can find such stories about anywhere, young man\u2026\"\n\n\nHafkova: \"Right, I ask because people have started showing strange behaviors right after our work trip here. It's almost like they aren't themselves anymore.\"\n\n\nMr. Manco: \"Ahh, well it could be that she was spooked at the things she has seen here\u2026 Did you go to the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio? It's very close, too.\"\n\n\nHafkova: \"Amongst others\"\n\n\nMr. Manco: \"Legend says you can see demons rise from the column right beside the church. It was said that Satan's horns got stuck there centuries ago, which left a portal into the netherworlds behind\u2026 now, I'm not one for such ghost stories, but maybe after seeing the column her mind played tricks on her. Maybe knowing of this tale, she just got very scared, yes?\"\n\n\nHafkova: \"Satan's horns?\"\n\n\nMr. Manco: \"I don't really know many details\u2026 Others say you can see him drag souls into the column, and people say you can smell sulfur from that place\u2026 I think it's really just a story, however.\"\n\n\nEnd of transcription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5566-3:\n Previous iterations of item description.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(2/3)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(2/3)\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 16-03-2019; 14.02 PM:\n Previous sequence continued for about 80 minutes after 7 minutes of consciousness. Current team failed to convince SCP-5566-A-3 to be strapped down with a feeding tube in the future. Ethics team consulted on the issue.\n\n\nUpdate 17-03-2019; 17.00:\n Sequence has continued for a full day as the break in between is considered insufficient for basic activities such as feeding oneself. SCP-5566-A instances have been residing in their rooms for the duration of this with no attempt to escape or relocate, still displaying extreme fatigue.\n\n\nUpdate 18-03-2019:\n The sequences have been reset with seemingly no provocation. Perhaps the phenomenon is tied to the bodily needs of SCP-5566-A instances.\n\n\nUpdate 25-03-2019:\n Sequences have resumed with minimal frequency as if completely reset. However no other instance of SCP-5566-A has been observed. It has been exactly one week, the sequence being only one \"sank\" long at this moment.\n\n\nUpdate 29-03-2019:\n Sequences currently 2 sanks long. Contact with instances of SCP-5566-A considered manageable. Next sequence expected in 61 hours and is to be 3 sanks long.\n\n\nUpdate 01-04-2019:\n Instance of SCP-5566-A-4 located. Due to the nature of the phenomenon, it was unaware of infection before. SCP-5566-A-4 has been tasked with cleaning the floor of the feeding room. In the process, it leaned against markings on the wall and crumbled some paint off it, which was considered an interruption, even if it was from a previous iteration. Intern suggested \"sync\" is a more accurate descriptor of the vocalization produced during the phenomenon, as all SCP-5566-A instances display the behavior in unison. Intern also proposed a \"kamikaze mission\" ending in an approved suicide to prevent infecting any others. Intern has been relocated to follow additional ethics course.\n\n\nUpdate 05-04-2019:\n Sequences are approaching lethal lengths steadily. Ethics team approved strapping down SCP-5566-A instances with feeding tubes, providing them no further aid beyond this, regardless of consequences. Food and liquid source will last them 7 days. Beyond this, it is yet to be observed if depletion of energy will cause a sequence reset.\n\n\nUpdate 14-04-2019:\n SCP-5566-A instances in various stages of desperation. Only motion sensors and infrared images available to researchers. Limbs of SCP-5566-A-1 appear to have shriveled down, leaving the head completely intact. SCP-5566-A-2 is completely intact, but malnourished and dehydrated. SCP-5566-A-3 has escaped its straps, and is steadily walking figures in the room. Microphones measuring sound in this room detect no sank mutterings from this instance. Infrared images suggest upper body is diminished. SCP-5566-A-4 has started crying during its sequences.\n\n\nUpdate 15-04-2019:\n Empathetic researcher turned off infrared surveillance monitoring SCP-5566-A-3 and instantly burned to ash. SCP-5566-A instances all disappeared without a trace. Research team dispatched to clear every cell and collect samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5566-4:\n Research report on Romania and France.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(Romania)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(Romania)\n\n\n\n\nAfter the instances of SCP-5566-A disappearing, research on the phenomenon was entirely dependent on collected samples of its remains and further retracing of steps in Europe.\n\nSamples proved to be cremated and pulverized remains of the cadavers without any unnatural properties.\n\nResearch in Romania has alerted Foundation operatives to frequent mentions of extraterrestrial species who will use humans as vessels to test out acceptable behavior. As mentioned by witnesses, the \"infected\" will exhibit a range of strange behaviors, including odd vocalizations. It is believed that these extraterrestrials might be doing anything from testing on subjects to merely playing with them out of boredom. SCP-5566 might be a form of extraterrestrial tampering. Contact with other teams researching these extraterrestrials with the purpose of retrieving information has not yet been established and might not exist at all. A check up on Foundation files on the subject is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(France)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0research\u00a0report\u00a0(France)\n\n\n\n\nA final interview was conducted in France, near the underground catacombs of Paris. Information deemed irrelevant was left out by translators, leaving the following transcript.\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Travere, 78 years old, retired, has lived in Paris all her life\n\n\nResearcher Abbott: \"What about these Catacombs? They are generally spooky, sure, good for tourists too.\u201d\n\n\nMrs. Travere: \"It wasn\u2019t made for tourists\u2026I heard that long ago there used to be some sort of infestation, not in this area, in a smaller village\u2026 it was like a plague, the villagers went down in larger and larger groups. Even when burnt down to the ground this disease kept popping up.\"\n\n\nAbbott: \"It kept popping up?\"\n\n\nMrs. Travere: \"I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have many details about the mysterious disease. However, it is said that even when this village was burnt down, people who went to take a look got infected all over again and would bring their diseases with them to other villages. It was then that the royal family decided they should isolate the problem. They took all the sick people, and a few uninfected as a sacrifice to appease God, and locked them deep, deep down in the catacombs.\"\n\n\nAbbott: \"Quarantine? Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\nMrs. Travere: \"Certainly! These catacombs aren\u2019t meant to be open to anyone, ever.\"\n\n\nAbbott: \"Don\u2019t you think a Disease would have died by now after so long?\"\n\n\nMrs. Travere: \"All I know is that God must have been really angry to have made such a precaution at all\u2026 we must not temper with such things\u2026\"\n\n\nEnd of transcription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5566-5:\n Previous iterations of item description.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(3/3)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0previous\u00a0description\u00a0iterations\u00a0part\u00a0(3/3)\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 14-07-2019:\n Researcher Thom Hafkova, who had collected samples from cell SCP-5566-A-1 three months prior, was found murmuring \"cease\" in uncharacteristically low voice resembling SCP-5566-A vocalizations. He did this in a strategic position, making it easy to make eye contact as he spoke, and was interrupted by uninformed colleague Dr. Abbott from another department. Thom Hafkova and Dr. Abbott have been assigned SCP-5566-B-1 and SCP-5566-B-2 respectively and contained according to containment procedures. SCP-5566 re-assigned Keter class.\n\n\nUpdate 28-08-2019:\n After six weeks, the tic commenced, seemingly featuring an extra instance of 'cease'. This is hypothesized to indicate accelerating frequencies of the ritual. Historians on the team are referring to literature on repetition of words featuring inane commands of such a caliber.\n\n\nUpdate 29-08-2019:\n Instance of sequence observed 27 days prematurely. Previous intern asked to re-analyse phenomenon.\n\n\nUpdate 30-08-2019:\n Accidental temporary power outage caused phenomenon to reset. All personnel present in the surveillance room to be under supervision, researchers are teamed up of groups of at least two.\n\n\nUpdate 02-09-2019:\n A sequence over five hours long has been observed uncharacteristically early. Intern responded intermediate times and sequence lengths do correspond to the original sequence, but no longer in the expected order. Electrician who caused power outage previously contained as SCP-5566-B-3.\n\n\nUpdate 03-09-2019:\n Sequence uninterrupted for 32 hours. All empathy-screened personnel is granted access to research as risk for infection is lowest.\n\n\nUpdate 04-09-2019:\n SCP-5566-B-2 observed to scratch open skin in shape of number six. The sequence was halted and consciousness regained. SCP-5566-B-2 is in the process of being treated by personnel, resumed sequence shortly, and was instantly halted again. Medical personnel is to abstain from healing wounds inflicted during sequence. Medic is assigned SCP-5566-B-4 until cleared.\n\n\nUpdate 13-09-2019:\n Personnel has observed ongoing sequence for over two days. Access to SCP-5566 prohibited and provision missions halted. Researchers are to passively observe phenomenon. Risk for infection too high.\n\n\nUpdate 15-09-2019:\n All instances of SCP-5566-B burned to ash simultaneously. Researchers are to tread carefully. Previous protocol to collect ash by scooping into container prohibited. Ash is to be collected using a small, sterile vacuum and not to be directly touched by human hands.\n\nPile of SCP-5566-B-1 hid a number \"2\" in an oily substance underneath its ash. Oily substance is not to be touched, and will be moved to the lab including the cement floor it is imprinted upon.\n\n\nUpdate 16-09-2019:\n Permission to remove chunk of floor denied by superiors, risk to interrupt SCP-5566 deemed too big. Portable lab shall be established in containment area instead.\n\n\nUpdate 17-09-2019:\n Researcher C. Peterson swabbed around the oily substance without disturbing its integrity. He is placed under supervision by colleagues but allowed to analyse specimen.\n\n\nUpdate 19-09-2019\n: Oily substance confirmed to be an extremely condensed human liquid by prof. Peterson. When asked to elaborate on which human liquids he was able to isolate from the sample, he simply specified it is a liquid made of human. When taking another, less careful swab from the substance it disappeared and professor was observed murmuring a single \"duh\" uncharacteristically low which he cannot recall. C. Peterson assigned SCP-5566-C-1 and contained according to containment protocol.\n\n\nUpdate 30-09-2019:\n A quiet SCP-5566-C-1 started ramming on containment door. It was thought isolation had gotten to it and its knocks were answered by a fellow researcher opening the door, after which both spontaneously combusted, leaving an oily 3 under the ashes of SCP-5566-C-2 in the middle of the hallway. Hallway is off limits for any personnel save for researchers assigned to SCP-5566, or personnel that has acquainted itself with regulations concerning SCP-5566.\n\n\nUpdate 01-10-2019:\n Clumsy researcher dropped equipment on oily substance before research could officially commence. A single instance of a new sequence was said but other researchers are unable to reach consensus other than that it sounded like a low growly hissing noise. Researcher has been assigned SCP-5566-D-1.\n\n\nUpdate 04-10-2019:\n Research on phenomenon dispatched after series of deaths. SCP-5566-D-1 is contained in solitary confinement in a straitjacket, movement prohibited. A feeding tube which can be controlled, refilled and cleaned from another room is attached to SCP-5566-D-1, and facilities for expelling waste have been similarly provided.\n\n\nUpdate 08-10-2019:\n Not a single sequence has commenced in days. SCP-5566-D-1 is pleading for euthanasia, but such an act is impossible without creating another instance of SCP-5566-D.\n\n\nUpdate 09-10-2019:\n SCP-5566-D-1 is mute and behaving strangely, similarly to SCP-5566-C-1, and moving rhythmically akin to SCP-5566-A-3. Surveillance cameras focused on SCP-5566-D-1 are for now unable to zoom as the effect this might have on the phenomenon is unknown.\n\n\nUpdate 11-10-2019:\n Researcher tasked with replenishing liquid container and emptying waste container assigned SCP-5566-D-2. It is currently unknown what the interruption was, but the rhythmic movements SCP-5566-D-1 was making stopped immediately.\n\n\nUpdate 12-10-2019:\n SCP-5566-D-2 fled before containment was possible and is hiding somewhere in the Foundation building. An announcement to not interact in any way with SCP-5566-D-2 was released immediately.\n\nSCP-5566-D-1 turned to ash, no oily liquid remains underneath. It is assumed an oily \"4\" will be found under the ashes of SCP-5566-D-2.\n\n\nUpdate 16-10-2019:\n Several people found to partake in sequence have been located and contained after a long instance of the sequence was started. All have been led to a containment area without disrupting their way of expressing the sequence. They have been assigned SCP-5566-E-1 and SCP-5566-E-2. We hypothesize it is one two more interruptions away from turning to ash again, and one more SCP-5566-E-3 may be present in the building or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 22-10-2019:\n There have been no instances of the phenomenon in six days. The research party has been thinning since day one, with only myself and the intern remaining. Truthfully, I am not quite sure why I started up this file again444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 22-10-2019; 16.04:\n Supervisor Mennings assigned SCP-5566-E-3 and contained. After a keyboard jam, SCP-5566-E-3 started ramming its head into the table and scratching even more fours onto it. Researchers are not allowed to remove these scribbles themselves, nor is SCP-5566-E-3 allowed outside of its containment to erase its marks, as time between sequences is still uncertain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5566-6:\n Personal anecdotes by intern Z. Bellerose.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 25-10-2019:\n Man, their screams are seriously getting to me\u2026 I'm just an intern, who am I even supposed to contact\u2026 I don't even know if this goes in the addendum or in the description or whatever, if I'm being honest. This was supposed to be a simple \"safe\" containment to get me integrated into the program. Was this in the training somewhere?? Oh, I should add what the thing has been up to, right?\n\nSo\u2026 my old supervisor, now 5-3, is constantly ramming his head back and forth and honestly I think his neck might even be broken at this point. Yet his weird \"Quatre\" thing is still going on\u2026 5-1 has been rubbing his hands against the wall until the skin on them was so broken the hands could be used as a marker, and 5-2 has been wriggling on the ground crying. I can't have them relocated as of now because their movements are obviously part of the sequence somehow\u2026 What a drag\u2026\n\n\nUpdate 28-10-2019:\n They stopped\u2026 I have seen my future colleagues dwindle down to a bunch of tics, movements and noises\u2026 maybe it is a little drastic, but I don't think this place is right for me\u2026 this kind of phenomenon should not be contained at any cost. This should be destroyed somehow, or hidden from researchers. Indeed, my old supervisor has perished due to the injuries to his neck, but 5-1 and 5-2 were able to help themselves. They are in bad condition. I gave them access to water and a medical kit and strapped them to a hospital bed on wheels before the sequence was started and I think I can now roll them around without it being an interruption.\n\nI told them I would bring them to a hospital, but that would be incredibly irresponsible. This thing can, or\u2026 no, it WANTS to kill as many people as possible. The rules are petty, like in a kids game, too. I don't know how to make this document all fancy-like, but I DO now how to use 5-3's login information to request or update a maybe more extreme containment procedure\u2026an emergency protocol.\n\nThis is basically the last that will ever be heard from me, as I fear for the fate of humanity if I don't even take the small precaution that I might already be infected into consideration. This SCP will be considered neutralized, as long as its not dug up, I'd say. And with that, I say adieu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5565\n | SCP-5566 | \nSCP-5567\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5566\n\" by Quinnen and Scented_Shadow, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Mr. Marco Manco, 45 years old, lives and works in Milan as a janitor, agreed to answer some questions during his lunch break. Researcher Hafkova: \"Are you aware of any strange occurrences in this area?\" Mr. Manco: \"\u2026Strange occurrences?\" Hafkova: \"Inexplicable, strange things, folklore.\" Mr. Manco: \"Hm\u2026You can find such stories about anywhere, young man\u2026\" Hafkova: \"Right, I ask because people have started showing strange behaviors right after our work trip here. It's almost like they aren't themselves anymore.\" Mr. Manco: \"Ahh, well it could be that she was spooked at the things she has seen here\u2026 Did you go to the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio? It's very close, too.\" Hafkova: \"Amongst others\" Mr. Manco: \"Legend says you can see demons rise from the column right beside the church. It was said that Satan's horns got stuck there centuries ago, which left a portal into the netherworlds behind\u2026 now, I'm not one for such ghost stories, but maybe after seeing the column her mind played tricks on her. Maybe knowing of this tale, she just got very scared, yes?\" Hafkova: \"Satan's horns?\" Mr. Manco: \"I don't really know many details\u2026 Others say you can see him drag souls into the column, and people say you can smell sulfur from that place\u2026 I think it's really just a story, however.\" End of transcription",
        "Mrs. Travere, 78 years old, retired, has lived in Paris all her life Researcher Abbott: \"What about these Catacombs? They are generally spooky, sure, good for tourists too.\u201d Mrs. Travere: \"It wasn\u2019t made for tourists\u2026I heard that long ago there used to be some sort of infestation, not in this area, in a smaller village\u2026 it was like a plague, the villagers went down in larger and larger groups. Even when burnt down to the ground this disease kept popping up.\" Abbott: \"It kept popping up?\" Mrs. Travere: \"I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have many details about the mysterious disease. However, it is said that even when this village was burnt down, people who went to take a look got infected all over again and would bring their diseases with them to other villages. It was then that the royal family decided they should isolate the problem. They took all the sick people, and a few uninfected as a sacrifice to appease God, and locked them deep, deep down in the catacombs.\" Abbott: \"Quarantine? Is that what you mean?\" Mrs. Travere: \"Certainly! These catacombs aren\u2019t meant to be open to anyone, ever.\" Abbott: \"Don\u2019t you think a Disease would have died by now after so long?\" Mrs. Travere: \"All I know is that God must have been really angry to have made such a precaution at all\u2026 we must not temper with such things\u2026\" End of transcription",

    "description": "SCP-5566 was a highly infectious anomalous verbal tic affecting a multitude of Foundation researchers. To this date, it is unclear what caused it and under what rules it operated. After an unusually high amount of failed research operations on the phenomenon, a - so far successful - attempt at total neutralization was made. It is theorized that, with the current procedures in place, SCP-5566 will unable to affect anyone anymore.
