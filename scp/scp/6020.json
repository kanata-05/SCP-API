However, following an extensive evaluation of SCP-6020-A\u2019s beneficial properties, Bio-Unit J4-88 was subsequently expanded and re-designated as Site-171.\n1\n As such, SCP-6020 and SCP-6020-A are protected from discovery or disruption by standard Foundation Site security measures.\n\n\nSCP-6020-A is to be maintained at a diameter of between 6,000 meters and 6,500 meters at all time, with appropriate adjustments made to gardening schedules whenever necessary. A wooded area has been planted around the perimeter of SCP-6020-A to limit the possibility of external observation. SCP-6020 itself is immobile and requires no additional physical containment. SCP-6020 has been deemed a Non-Hostile Sentient Entity (NHSE) and has proven willing to assist Foundation researchers when its mental state permits.\n\n\nWhile Site-171 staff members are permitted to discuss their work with SCP-6020,\n2\n it is recommended that they avoid mentioning particularly unpleasant or distressing events such as mass bloodshed or torture. Such topics have a strongly negative impact on SCP-6020\u2019s mental well-being and can result in extended periods of non-communication. SCP-6020 should especially not be informed of incidents where the actions of the Foundation might be considered morally dubious, or have resulted in high levels of casualties or extensive suffering. SCP-6020 should not be informed of the existence or purpose of Class-D personnel. SCP-6020 has an extremely sensitive disposition, and it is believed that such revelations may damage the Foundation\u2019s ongoing relationship with it.\n\n\nAny significant changes in SCP-6020\u2019s attitude or behaviour should be reported immediately to a member of Site-171\u2019s supervisory staff.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6020\n\n\nSCP-6020 is an parametic entity that identifies itself as \u201cthe Earth God Hepolokoli\u201d. It is presently housed within a sandstone pillar (or \u201cstanding stone\u201d) which measures 4.7 meters in height above ground and has a further 0.5 meters below ground. The pillar is coated with lichen and moss, and its upper area appears to have been partially eroded by weather. Two other smaller stones, measuring 4 meters and 3.8 meters in height, have been placed nearby. SCP-6020 reports that these are the remnants of 9 stones which were originally placed around its pillar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6020 shortly after its initial discovery.\n\nSCP-6020-A has a diameter of only 7 meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6020 professes to have been the deity of a small tribe that lived approximately 4,000 years ago. This is consistent with radiocarbon dating of human remains unearthed near the pillars.\n3\n\n\nSCP-6020 is able to communicate through an adaptive form of telepathy, which it claims also enables it to converse with non-sapient animals and plants. So far, it has been largely cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, SCP-6020 suffers from poor mental health and is prone to long periods of silence when upset. It has found certain enquiries about its history extremely distressing, and frequently believes that Foundation personnel are asking it questions out of a sense of obligation or politeness rather than genuine interest.\n\n\nSCP-6020-A\n\n\nSCP-6020-A is the designation code given to SCP-6020\u2019s range of anomalous influence. It is a roughly spherical area of space that extends outwards from SCP-6020 in all directions. Living organisms within SCP-6020-A are subject to the following anomalous effects:\n\n\n\n\nAny flora planted within the soil of SCP-6020-A will grow rapidly until it has reached a state of maturity. At that point, its biological aging will abruptly slow. Flowers will grow from seeds in a matter of days and then remain in bloom for months at a time. This occurs regardless of whether or not the plants are provided with sustenance such as sunlight, water, or nutrients. Plants within SCP-6020-A also appear to be unaffected by most external factors, including climate, soil type, and disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of sapient life forms, including all humans so far exposed to SCP-6020-A, experience increased feelings of happiness, pleasure, and contentment, and reduced feelings of anger, hatred, and hostility. Individuals struggling with mental health concerns such as stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD report that their symptoms are lessened while within SCP-6020-A. In most cases, some degree of these effects persist even after a subject leaves SCP-6020-A, with longer periods of exposure resulting in longer and more intense aftereffects. SCP-6020's influence on sapiens is especially pronounced in it's immediate vicinity. Within approximately 20 meters of it, subjects are prone to a sense of euphoria. This area is designated SCP-6020-A2.\n\n\n\n\nThe diameter of SCP-6020-A is determined by what SCP-6020 describes as \"acts of worship\". Providing SCP-6020 with \"worship\" will expand the size of SCP-6020, while providing it with less or no \"worship\" will cause it to contract.\n\n\nSCP-6020 can be \"worshiped\" by performing devotional gardening-related activities within the boundaries of SCP-6020-A. This effectiveness of this \"worship\" is completely irrespective whether the \"gardening-related activities\" would actually be beneficial to normal flora. Activities that have been found to support SCP-6020-A's expansion include pouring buckets of water into a single patch of soil, digging holes for \"imaginary seeds\" and then filling them in again, and running a child's toy mower across the grass. Conversely, using an automated water sprinkler system did not promote expansion \u2013 although the act of installing the system did.\n\n\nSCP-6020 states that it does not chose what actions are counted as worshipful, but that it is able to feel if a particular action is or is not. It claims to have no personal control over the size or effects of SCP-6020-A.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1 \u2013 Site-171:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\u00a0\u20092\u00a0clearance\u00a0required\u00a0\u2013\u00a0site\u00a0overview\n\n\n\n\naccess\u00a0granted\u00a0\u2013\u00a0site\u00a0overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Foundation Secure Facility\n\n\nSite-171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of Site-171's residential area, pictured beside the then-edge of SCP-6020-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Identification Code:\n JPALP-Site-717\n\n\nSite Category:\n B-3t\n\n\nSite Director:\n Chiaki Mori\n\n\nAssociated Task Force(s):\n N/A\n\n\nCapabilities:\n Standard humanoid containment; standard animalia containment; sapient entity containment; specialised flora containment; standard laboratory access; botanical research; psychological research; on-site staff accommodation; psychological care\n\n\nPurpose and Objective(s):\n Site-171 was established primarily to take advantage of the beneficial properties of SCP-6020. SCP-6020 generates an anomalous field (SCP-6020-A) which promotes mental health and happiness in sentient entities and sustains and protects plant life. Site-171 has three primary objectives:\n\n\n\n\nTo safeguard plants which are of interest to the Foundation or whose preservation is deemed important. This includes both anomalous and endangered flora.\n\n\nTo provide containment for sentient anomalous entities that require mental health support, or whose hostile behaviour might be curbed by SCP-6020.\n\n\nTo provide assistance to Foundation personnel who require mental health support. Site-171 incorporates a Wellness Centre (identification code 717-B), where staff members suffering from mental health difficulties can be sent if deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\u00a04/6020\u00a0clearance\u00a0required\u00a0\u2013\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0anomalies\u00a0under\u00a0site\u00a0jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\naccess\u00a0denied\u00a0\u2013\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0anomalies\u00a0under\u00a0site\u00a0jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESS DENIED\n\n\nInsufficient Security Clearance\n\n\n\nIf you believe that you have received this notice in error, queries\n\nmay be sent to \num.asiar.noitadnuof|ecnaraelc#um.asiar.noitadnuof|ecnaraelc\n\n\n\n\nC-6020-01A-Q7TX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\u00a04/6020\u00a0clearance\u00a0required\u00a0\u2013\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0wellbeing\u00a0center\u00a0patients\n\n\n\n\naccess\u00a0denied\u00a0\u2013\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0wellbeing\u00a0center\u00a0patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESS DENIED\n\n\nInsufficient Security Clearance\n\n\n\nIf you believe that you have received this notice in error, queries\n\nmay be sent to \num.asiar.noitadnuof|ecnaraelc#um.asiar.noitadnuof|ecnaraelc\n\n\n\n\nC-6020-01A-PJ9B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2 \u2013 Supplementary Interview Logs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviews with Dr. George Stanworth\n\n\nPreface\n: Due to the difficulties of bringing D-Class personnel into contact with SCP-6020, it was decided to open Bio Unit J4-74 to selected Foundation volunteers.

Good afternoon, Dr. Stanworth. How are you feeling today?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Oh, um, fine. Thank you very much. Fine. Um, sorry. I\u2019m, you know, not very used to being on this side of the interview desk, as it were. Or, that side, I suppose, actually, come to think about it. Sorry, never mind.\n\n\nDr. White:\n That\u2019s quite alright. It can take a little getting used to, Now, do you think you could expand a little bit on \u201cfine\u201d?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Oh yes, yes, of course. Sorry. Um, I am \n[pause]\n well. In good health, or as good health as I was when I went in, I suppose. Um. As far as I can tell, there have been no negative side-effects of my time at the Honeysuckle Unit. Or none that have developed yet, I suppose I should say. Touch wood. No, you know, brains dribbling out of ears or howling at the moon so far. Hah, no, but yes. I feel fine. Distinctly fine. I mean, you know, good. Goodish, I suppose. Unwound. Refreshed.\n\n\nDr. White:\n I see. And tell me, how would you describe your time in SCP-6020-A?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Oh it was, well I mean, if not \nthe\n most pleasant experience of my life so far then definitely, you know, right up there. I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt so relaxed. I\u2019m not sure I ever have been. And the garden they've put in? Gorgeous! I\u2019ve never been much of a, you know, a garden person, but palm trees, in that climate! And those beautiful big purple flowers, oh, the, um \n[pause]\n Sorry, I forget the name. But you've seen them, have't you?\n\n\nDr. White:\n I've seen them. But we\u2019re just here to talk about your experiences today, doctor.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Right, yes, sorry, yes. Tangent. Good point. Must keep on task.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Alright. So while you were in SCP-6020-A you felt, in a word, happy?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Yes? Well, I mean, yes, of course, definitely. But not, I mean, not quite in exactly the same way I\u2019d usually think of happiness, I suppose? \n[pause]\n I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m being rather confusing.\n\n\nDr. White:\n No, that\u2019s very interesting. Can you explain what you mean?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Right. Well, normally, I suppose, you, um, well get happy when something good happens, don\u2019t you? You, I don't know, get the job you want, or eat food you like, or see a picture of some baby otters holding hands or something. Happiness is sort of \n[pause]\n put into you. But in SCP-6020-A, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s more like \n[pause]\n like going into space and finding that your body has become weightless. Not that I\u2019ve ever been to space, you understand, but it\u2019s how I imagine it must feel. You get outside the Earth's gravity and you suddenly realise that you\u2019ve been living all your life with this \nthing\n, this weight on you, and now it\u2019s gone. And you'd never noticed it was there at all until you feel it missing. You never \n[pause]\n You never considered that it was something separate from you, that it could be taken away while leaving you still there. I mean, that you could still be you without it, if that makes sense. Only \n[pause]\n it all seemed very simple when I was up there, but now I\u2019m here, I can\u2019t quite \n[pause]\n I can\u2019t remember. I can't remember what the \nthing\n was. Where I end and it begins. It\u2019s so hard to explain. I know that I knew it, but I don't know what it was that I knew, exactly. \n[pause]\n I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m rambling. I know that\u2019s not very helpful.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Not at all doctor, that\u2019s very useful. And I think we'll leave it there for now. Thank you for coming in today.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Right. Yes, well, thank you for, um, everything.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25c6\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_2\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[6020-B2-19/06/2018]\u00a0\u25c6\n\n\n\n\n\u25c7\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_2\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[6020-B2-19/06/2018]\u00a0\u25c7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n6020-B2-19/06/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Dr. George Stanworth\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Samuel White\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted via video call, 46 hours into Dr. Stanworth's second visit to SCP-6020-A.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nDr. White:\n Good afternoon, Dr. Stanworth. How are you feeling today?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n And an extremely good afternoon to you Dr. White. As a matter of fact, I am feeling even better than when you asked me same question yesterday. Would you like to know what I did this morning? Don't worry, I won\u2019t make you guess. I woke up without feeling tired. Not one little bit. You know, I was beginning to think that waking up and not wanting to immediately roll over and go back to sleep was something I'd invented in childhood. But today, just bam! Up and at \u2018em, what\u2019s for breakfast? Incidentally, it was poached eggs. I don\u2019t know if this place makes food taste better, or they've just hired some truly excellent cooks, but as eggs go these were belters.\n\n\nDr. White:\n I take it that you're still enjoying your return trip to SCP-6020-A?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Immensely. Truth be told, I wasn\u2019t much of a, you know, what's the word? Social butterfly, on my first visit. I stayed in my room for most of the day, just, well, soaking it all in, I suppose? Now I feel like I know the place a little better. I've arranged to go for a bit of a ramble after lunch with a few of the staff members. They've extended the gardens since I was last here, or the forest part I suppose, and they're going to show me the trees. There are some beautiful varieties here. Which I'd probably have said was an odd thing to say about trees before I came to visit, but it's true. My grandmother was always a tree fan. When I was growing up she was very keen that I learn the names of trees and the shapes of their leaves, but I\u2019m afraid I was never a particularly attentive student. The only ones I still remember are Oaks, because they're everywhere, and Monkey Puzzles, because they sounded so silly. You know, I think that higher ups should give some thought to expanding this place. SCP-6020-A, I mean. Not just the Bio Unit.\n\n\nDr. White:\n \n[pause]\n Expand SCP-6020-A? And what makes you think that, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Well I\u2019m not being mind controlled by the talking rockery, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. But then I suppose that\u2019s just what I would say if I \nwas\n being mind controlled, of course, so I suppose you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself when I get back. But this area is deserted for miles around. You could accommodate, oh, hundreds of people here, easily. And the garden could do some some room to grow. They've been testing out fruit trees. They've got apples and pears and plums and cherries so far, but it seems like you can grow anything here, from anywhere. Oh, hold on! Wasn\u2019t there a type of banana that went extinct or something a few years ago? I'm sure I heard something like that. Do we know if anyone has any seeds left? We could bring it back with this place, start a whole new crop.\n4\n Hold on, is that the right word for bananas? A crop? Or do they have some silly name like a murder of crows?\n\n\nDr. White:\n I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m not especially well acquainted with the particulars of banana farming, but I\u2019m sure that your suggestions will be given due consideration when I hand in my report.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Oh goodness, I\u2019m so sorry. You must think I\u2019m terribly rude. Here am I blathering on about breakfast and bananas and you probably have a clipboard full of questions to ask before you can get to your lunch. Please, do go on. I won\u2019t interrupt again.\n\n\nDr. White:\n That\u2019s quite alright. I believe this conversation has more or less covered everything I was going to ask anyway. I'll schedule our next talk for the same time tomorrow. Have a pleasant rest of your day, doctor. And thank you for your time.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n And the very same to you, Dr. White.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25c6\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_3\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[6020-B2-17/07/2018]\u00a0\u25c6\n\n\n\n\n\u25c7\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_3\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[6020-B2-17/07/2018]\u00a0\u25c7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n6020-B2-17/07/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Dr. George Stanworth\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Samuel White\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted 76 hours after Dr. Standworth exited SCP-6020-A, following 168 hours of exposure.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nDr. White:\n Good afternoon, Dr. Stanworth. How are you feeling today.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n I'm well, thank you Dr. White. Quite well.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Could you expand on that a little?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Certainly, I\u2019ll do my best. Um, so, like before, as far as I am aware, I have suffered no negative side effects from prolonged exposure to SCP-6020-A. No one has remarked upon a change in my behaviour, except that my sister said I sounded happier on the phone, which was nice. I suppose I am, really. Thought of course it may be somewhat psychosomatic. I haven\u2019t had a panic attack since I returned from Honeysuckle, but then it has only been three days, so I suppose I shouldn\u2019t make any firm statements about that.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. Now, when we spoke at the beginning of last week you suggested that SCP-6020-A should be expanded, and more people should be housed within its boundaries. Are you still in favour of that?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Um, I still think it could be a good idea, yes. Following all proper evaluation and whatnot, of course. I mean, well, it's just rather nice having an anomaly that just seems to make people feel better, After all the \n[pause]\n unpleasantness we have to deal with most of the time, it just seems a waste not to make use of something that actually seems to do some good. And I do understand your position of course. I think we've all been waiting for the other shoe to drop, and Honeysuckle to start spewing forth mutant fruit trees or something. Whoever's up there doesn't usually seem very keen on giving us an easy time of things.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Are you a religious man, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n \n[laughter]\n Not especially. But then I have just spent a week with an actual god, tending to a heavenly garden with a plastic lawnmower, so I suppose I should try to keep an open mind. And if SCP-6020-A really is just what it seems to be, well, why not use it, you know? I think we wretched mortals deserve a little paradise once in a while.\n\n\nDr. White:\n I see. Tell me, doctor, how did you feel when it was time for you to leave SCP-6020-A? Did you feel disappointed, for example? Upset? Did you want to stay longer?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Um. Well, I think it's \n[pause]\n it's quite hard to feel disappointed by things like that, while you're up there. That stuff doesn't seem to matter all that much, when the whole world seems to be opened up in front of you. I suppose I felt \n[pause]\n content. Honestly, very content. I mean, it is lovely up there, but anywhere else can be lovely, too. Hepolokoli just makes it easier to see that.\n\n\nDr. White:\n SCP-6020 please, for the record.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Pardon me, quite so. SCP-6020. And I mean, when I was about to come back I wasn't thinking, oh no, what happens when I leave here, am I going to be all miserable again? I was thinking, why don't I feel like this all the time? I felt ready to, well, \ndo\n things.. It's, um, it's hard to explain. Look, do you remember what I said the first time we met? About it being hard to remember exactly how things feel to you in there? You can remember what the feeling was, but not, um, how you got there? I'm not sure if that's the best explanation, but I can't think of a better one right now.\n\n\nDr. White:\n I remember.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Right. Um, but I bring it up because I think it's the same when you're inside, but the other way around. I mean, I could \nremember\n everything. The panic attacks, the anxiety, the, you know, bad days. But I don't think I could quite understand how those feelings worked. It's like one of those optical illusion pictures of two things in one, but once you see one of them you can't make your brain switch back to seeing the other. When I was about to leave SCP-6020-A, I don't think I really believed the bad stuff would come back. It just seemed too incomprehensible to feel that way. But, well, actually, um, no, look. There's something else but I've just realised I've been going on and on and on, and you're the one who's meant to be asking me questions. Sorry. I mean, not sorry. I mean, yes, no, I do mean sorry in this case, I\u2019m just trying to cut down on saying sorry so much.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Since your second visit to SCP-6020-A?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Well, yes and no. I mean, it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve wanted to stop doing for years now. But when you get into the habit of something like that it\u2019s hard to shift. But I didn\u2019t seem to say it at all while I was up at Honeysuckle. Well, hardly ever. So I thought, you know, while the iron\u2019s hot and all that. I\u2019d try extra hard to keep it going. But, I'm going off on a tangent again. Sorry. I mean, sorry, you know what I mean. Look, I'll shut up, you ask questions.\n\n\nDr. White:\n It's quite alright. Everything you've provided us with has been most informative. You said there was something else?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n There was? Um, about what?\n\n\nDr. White:\n You were talking about remembering, and said there was something else you wanted to tell me.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Oh, yes, of course, right. I was just going to say that, that \nthing\n I told you about after my first visit. The weight you think is just an inseparable part of you until SCP-6020-A takes it away. Well I still can't properly remember it, not the way I think I could in SCP-6020-A. But I'm \n[pause]\n I'm more aware of it, I think. As something that's repeatable. I can feel it like a slightly loose tooth. And yesterday, I just sat down, and closed my eyes, and for a few minutes, I think that I pushed that weight off myself. It wasn't quite like being there, back in Honeysuckle I mean, but it was something like it.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Thank you doctor. That's extremely interesting. I think we might have to schedule a followup interview with someone who's a little more of a specialist than myself.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Of course. Any time. I mean, you know, within my schedule, of course.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Of course. Can you tell me how you feel towards SCP-6020-A now? Do you want to return?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Hah, well if that\u2019s an invitation I definitely won\u2019t say no. But I suppose it feels a bit like a long holiday, really. Or a vacation, your lot would say. It makes for a wonderful break, but you don\u2019t really \nexpect\n to keep going back there every few weeks. It feels too special.\n\n\nDr. White:\n I see. And how would you feel if I told that that you could not go back, ever? That I had decided to ban you from Bio Unit J4-78 because we wanted to study the effects long-term withdrawal?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Is this the part where you expect me to jump over the desk and threaten to throttle you to death with your tie unless you take me back there?\n\n\nDr. White:\n Is that what you\u2019d like to do, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n No, no. Just a bad joke, I promise. Poor taste. Absolutely no homicidal urges to report, I assure you. And no compulsion effect demanding my return, as far as I'm aware. In fact, quite honesty, I would have expected to feel a lot worse at the prospect of never going back than I do. But I suppose it's a bit like visiting the northern lights. You wouldn't \nnot\n want to see them again, but it's really the first time that feels \n[pause]\n fulfilling. You know it's going to keep on existing and being admired, and you've made yourself a little part of that story.\n\n\nDr. White:\n Thank you, doctor. Just two last question, then. Earlier, you mention SCP-6020 by name. Did you spend much time speaking with it? And what was your relationship like?\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Well, relationship might be a bit of a stretch. I think everyone up there spoke to it, at some point. When you get really close to it the feeling is just, you know, incredible. Euphoric. But it seems a bit rude to just stand there silently and enjoy Hep- I mean, in SCP-6020\u2019s happy-vibe anomalous thingummy without at least saying hello. We didn\u2019t talk all that much, quite honestly. Poor chap. We spoke a little about how he was feeling, and the garden, I believe. It kept telling me about flowers and plants on the outer edge of SCP-6020-A. I rather got the impression that it wanted me to push off. But also that it didn't, if you know what I mean. Wasn't happy being alone, wasn't happy being with others. Very, ah, familiar. As I say, poor old chap. It was all recorded,\n\n\nDr. White:\n Thank you, doctor. I think we'll end things there. You have been most helpful.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Very glad to be of service.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviews with SCP-6020\n\n\nPreface\n: SCP-6020 speaks through a form of telepathic projection and as such cannot be recorded with audio equipment.

I hope that you\u2019re doing well today!\n\n\nSCP-6020\n \n[silence]\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Would it be alright if we had a conversation?\n\n\nSCP-6020\n You do not have to speak to me, you know.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n I know I don't \nhave\n to, but I\u2019d really like to talk to you. Wouldn\u2019t you like to talk to me?\n\n\nSCP-6020\n No.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Well I'm sorry to hear that, and I apologise if I've done anything to upset you. If you wouldn't like to talk with me, we could get Mark instead. The guy you spoke to yesterday?\n\n\nSCP-6020\n No. No, you have done nothing. I simply have no desire to burden you further. Any of you.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Talking to me wouldn't be a burden, it would be a favour. Please, Hepolokoli? It would really, really help me out.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n \n[long silence]\n Very well.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Thank you so much, that really means a lot! So, um, I\u2019m going to ask you some questions, if that\u2019s OK, and my friend here is going to write some of the things you say down. Some of them may be questions you\u2019ve answered before, but we\u2019d really like to get them down on paper for our records, in your own words.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n I do not have my own words.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Oh? Well, uh, hold on a sec, I wrote these down somewhere because I knew they'd feel terribly unimportant when I was here. OK, right. All ready Aj? So, first of all Hepolokoli, you describe yourself as a god, is that right?\n\n\nSCP-6020\n No. Your kind describes me as a god. I do not \n[pause]\n think the way you do. I do not think in labels. Words. Language. I speak with you by finding the words in your minds. Your word for what I am is god. \n[pause]\n Pathetic, miserable little god.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Well hey, I would certainly never call you pathetic.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n Then you do not yet understand.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Maybe not. There\u2019s lots of things I\u2019d love to understand about you. Could you tell me when you were born? Or, started to exist.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n That is \n[pause]\n complicated. You would not understand.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Try me.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n You would not understand. You do not have the words to describe it. None of you do.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Please. You can dumb it down for me. Even if I don\u2019t understand all of it, I\u2019d still really like to hear you tell me what you can. Honestly, it's fascinating learning about you.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n \n[long silence]\n I was \n[pause]\n begun here, a very long time ago. A woman came to this place. Hungry, and thirsty, and tired. And she prayed as she walked to all that was around her. She begged the air and the trees and the sun and the soil for food. And just here, she found it. and here she found it. Bushes of black fruit. You do not have a name for them. She knelt, and ate, and thanked the earth beneath her feet for the miracle. To her, the bushes had seemed to sprout from the soil at her request. She left, and when she returned, she brought more people. They ate. They settled. And soon, they brought the stones. They began me and moulded me and named me. Hepolokoli. God of earth, god of soil, the immortal, the life-protector, the fruit-giver. They wove me out of dance and song and prayer. And belief. So much belief. And yet \n[pause]\n. And yet, once they had done so, once I had a mind to think with, I immediately understood that I \nhad\n always been here, that I \nwould\n always be here. I \nhad\n been the one to tug upon the wind and bring the fruit seeds. I had bent the earth to bring them water, spread the trees to give them light. It had been I, Hepolokoli, that had brought forth fruit for the woman after all. I began on the day she visited my soil, but I existed then at all times, from the very start to whatever may come after. My people were right to believe in me. They believed that I tended their plants, chased away their sorrows, cleansed their pain. And so I did. \n[pause]\n I was vain. Pathetic, wretched little god.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n But that sounds lovely! You brought them what they wanted. Why does that make you pathetic?\n\n\nSCP-6020\n I am tired.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n Please, Hepolokoli. Help me to understand.\n\n\nSCP-6020\n No. No. I am ashamed. So very ashamed. \n[pause]\n I am tired now.\n\n\nDr. Alderman\n I'm sure it couldn't have been all that bad. And not here, of all places. It's so \nnice\n here.\n\n\nSCP-6020 refused to resume conversation.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25c6\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_5\u00a0\u2009\u2013\u00a0[6020-A1-28/08/2017]\u00a0\u25c6\n\n\n\n\n\u25c7\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_5\u00a0\u2009\u2013\u00a0[6020-A1-28/08/2017]\u00a0\u25c7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n6020-A1-28/08/201\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6020\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Aidan Sax\n\n\nTranscriber:\n Dr. Ajda Buchanan\n\n\nForeword:\n Human remains were discovered in the soil around SCP-6020, which it subsequently claimed were members of the tribe that had worshiped it. After lengthy discussion, SCP-6020 agreed for one of the bones to be removed for carbon dating, on the understanding that it would be returned afterwards. The following conversation took place immediately after the bone was reburied.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n All as promised. I'm sorry it was necessary to remove anything, but I assure you it was treated with the uttermost respect. You clearly cared for them a great deal. You must miss them very much.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Yes. But I do not deserve to. It sullies them.\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n I think everyone deserves to miss the people that they\u2019ve loved.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n No. It could not have been love. Pathetic, how I cling to their husks. Yet I am still alone. And I will always be alone.\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n Is company something that you want, Hepolokoli?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[long silence]\n Is there any being that does not?\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n Do you feel that you don\u2019t have enough company here? We could certainly arrange for more regular conversations if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n I have no desire for anyone to be forced into my presence.\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n Of course not, that isn\u2019t what I meant. There would be no question of forcing anyone. I know that every one of our researchers here would love to spend more time with you. It isn\u2019t often you get to talk to a god, even in our job. \n[laughter]\n And you must know people enjoy being near you. Isn't that right Dr. Buchanan?\n\n\nDr. Buchanan:\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Near. Yes. Near me. They enjoy the feeling. The thing that makes them happy. They do not enjoy me. They wish I were not here to spoil their enjoyment. Even here, I upset them.\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n What makes you think that?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[silence]\n\n\nDr. Sax:\n That's not true at all. You're fascinating, Hepolokoli. Absolutely fascinating.

The following was intended as an introductory session.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Good afternoon, Hepolokoli. My name is Dr. Daniel Shann. You can call me Dr. Shann, or Daniel, whatever you'd prefer. I understand you've been told why I'm here today?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Yes. It is pointless.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n I wouldn't be so sure. But you're definitely not the first patient who's said that to me when we first met, and I'm sure you won't be the last. Its completely understandable to be skeptical, especially when you're coming from a very unique set of circumstances. But I have rather a lot of experience supporting patients with unique circumstances. I can't make you any promises, but what do you say we give it a go? You never know, it might surprise you.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n It will not. You do not have to waste your time. I am sorry to have troubled you.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Waste my time? Not at all, not at all. I don't think I'd trade standing right here for all the world. It's really quite wonderful. \n[pause]\n And of course, I mean, it wouldn't be a waste of time anyway. I'm here to find out how we can go about helping you.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n You cannot.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Nonsense. No, no, being defeatist won't get us anywhere at all. There is always the possibility of recovery, of \n[pause]\n. We don't need to worry too much over the details right now. All I'm here for today is a little chat, so we can get to know each other a little better. \n[pause]\n Although, of course, that's not saying we \ncan't\n work through some things right now, while the iron is hot. I feel quite \n[pause]\n I feel like I can do an awful lot today.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n There is much to do inside, I believe.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Who could be inside on a day like this? This place \n[pause]\n This garden is very beautiful.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n So I am told.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n If only I could meet all my patients in a place like this. It's just so hard to be miserable here.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n So I am told.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Hepolokoli, tell me, how are \nyou\n feeling today?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n It doesn't matter.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n Of course it matters. It absolutely matters. \nYou\n matter very much and don't go thinking otherwise. Tell me.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n The same way I have felt for thousands of years, and will feel for countless thousands more. When your kind have all left and the sun has shriveled and the soil is dead I will still be here, just the same.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n And you think that's a bad thing? \n[laugher]\n That's so \n[laughter]\n so \nsilly\n. You'll find this so funny when you get past all this. Do you know how many people like me spend their lives yearning to be like you? Unaffected by age or death. Living in the most beautiful, most perfectly fantastic landscape I have ever seen. I mean, just look at this place. Look at it. A beautiful gem in a beautiful world. And all this is because of \nyou\n. Magnificent. And don't you see? You have eternity to \nfigure all this out\n. Most of us get nothing close to that Why, if I had time for a few more sessions with certain patients, it would make all the difference in the world. And you have forever! And ever! You just \n[pause]\n It's just about seeing the world the right way. That's it, really. That's what it all comes down to. And you have an infinity to find out how, and then the whole rest of infinity once you do. All this will just be a blink of an eye. And I mean, just look around. What is there, when you really think about it, to be so down about?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n A world, rotting beyond my boarders, The bones of my people. The failure I regret every moment of this endless existence-\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n \n[interrupting]\n No, no, I do understand all that, believe me. I've had so many regrets too, so many questions about whether I was making the right choices in life. Whether I should have stayed with painting, whether I should have joined the Foundation \n[pause]\n. But now, right now, I understand how absurd it was to waste so much time worrying about things like that. \n[laughter]\n Life is so much more important. All the little things \nmatter\n, you see. Every moment, even the dull parts and the bad parts, they're all \n[pause]\n it's still \nlife\n, you know? It's like \n[pause]\n I can\u2019t find the right words, but it\u2019s \nthere\n \n[snaps fingers repeatedly]\n. Right there.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n I am \n[pause]\n happy for you.\n\n\nDr. Shann:\n And \nI\n am happy for you. You don't see it yet, but you'll understand eventually, I know you will. The bad days always end. And then, \nthen\n you'll have all of the time in the world to enjoy it. In this wonderful place. You don't realise how lucky you are.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[silence]\n\n\nAt this point, Dr. Li intervened to end the interview and move Dr. Shann out of SCP-6020's immediate vicinity. SPC-6020 refused to communicate with Foundation personnel for 23 days following this encounter.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Dr. Shann appears to have been particularly susceptible to SCP-6020-A2's effect. Due to SCP-6020's negative reaction to the encounter, plans for further in-person therapy have been put on hold. SCP-6020 was invited to take part in remote therapy, with an on-site staff member acting as a go-between for a psychotherapist and SCP-6020.

Dr. Stanworth had been enjoying the intensity of SCP-6020-A's effect while standing beside SCP-6020.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Hello, SC- I mean, Hepolokoli.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[silence]\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n How are you feeling today? If you don't mind me asking, of course.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n You do not wish to know.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n I do! I mean, that's why I asked.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n You are being polite. It is unnecessary.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n I don't think that politeness is ever really unnecessary, you know. My grandmother certainly said so. But then you should have heard the things she used to say about Nancy Baker at number 22. \n[laughter]\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Ah. Deception. Your kind have the ability to delude themselves in order to be happy. You are very fortunate.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n I'm not sure that's how I would put it, but I certainly feel very fortunate to be here. Really, Hepolokoli, tell me how you're doing.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n It would only upset you.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Well, first of all I'm not sure if I \ncan\n be upset here. But if it does upset me, then that would rather blow your theory about us not caring about you out of the water, wouldn't it?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[silence]\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Aha, got you there, haven't I? Not that being logical tends to help when you're, you know, going through this type of stuff. At least, that's how I remember it. I always hated when people tried to be obnoxiously logical about everything. Even if I can't quite remember what was so unpleasant about it. \n[pause]\n I do understand, you know. What it's like, I mean.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n You do not. You cannot begin to conceive of it.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Well, I suppose I can't know what its like specifically for you. Even if I could remember exactly what it felt like for me. But I know I've felt something similar.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Have you? Have you spent thousands of years in solitude? In regret? Surrounded only by the remnants of your failure, the victims of your inferiority. Every moment weighed with the guilt of your worthlessness and the knowledge that all of this shall never, ever end.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n No. No, you have me beaten there. Although, aha, life with my father might have been a close run thing. But that's in the past now. And we can't be ruled by the past forever.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[silence]\n You enjoy the flowers here. There are new flowers in the east, by my border.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n \n[pause]\n I'm sorry, that wasn't very empathetic of me, was it? I'm afraid, you know, this place. Being this close to you. It makes it hard to \n[pause]\n understand some things. No, you are quite right, and I apologise unreservedly.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n The trees in the west have grown since this morning. They have three hundred and forty-four new leaves. You will find them interesting.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Hepolokoli, I can't talk about what you've been through. But the feelings of, well, of misery, of self-hatred, of depression. That \nis\n something I've known. Something a lot of us have known. Especially the people who come here. What I mean is, just, well, I don't want you to think you're alone in all this.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n I am alone. I am always alone. I am not like you. You have hope.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Yes. Right now. But only because you gave it to me, Hepolokoli.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n No. Not that. Your kind. You stop. You have endings. No matter what you endure, you have the hope of it stopping. You are safe from eternity.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n You mean death?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Yes. Death. Finality. Cessation.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Do you want to die?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n It has been such a very, very long time since I last wished to be alive. I am tired. So tired of my punishment.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Your punishment?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n I do not deserve to cease. I deserve this. It is my fault.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n That's not \n[pause]\n. Sorry. I mean, why do you think you deserve to feel this way?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n The fruit trees are heavy again. You will enjoy the apples.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Alright, I won't pry. But I mean \n[pause]\n Well, look, obviously no one here wants you to die, but are you so certain you're going to around forever? What would happen if the garden was gone? Or your stone was broken?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Then I would no longer be able to speak, or to see, but I will remain here, just the same. My people wanted an immortal god. That, at least, I have done right.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n I'm so sorry. But there must be something we can do to help you?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n \n[pause]\n There are White Egret orchids in bloom in the south. I am told they are most beautiful.\n\n\nDr. Stanworth:\n Yes, yes, right. You're right. \n[pause]\n Um, look, I really don't want to leave you, or for you to think that I'm leaving because of you, but this spot is \n[pause]\n I think I'm getting a little too buzzed out. And if I stay here and keep talking, I'm going to start telling you that things aren't really so bad when you think about it, and I still have enough sense to know what a horrible thing that is to hear. So, I'm going to go, but, I don't know, can I do anything for you at all? Get anyone?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n No thank you, doctor. Goodbye. I \n[pause]\n am glad that you enjoy the garden.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25c6\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_8\u00a0\u2009\u2013\u00a0[6020-A1-09/05/2021]\u00a0\u25c6\n\n\n\n\n\u25c7\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06020_8\u00a0\u2009\u2013\u00a0[6020-A1-09/05/2021]\u00a0\u25c7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n6020-A1-09/05/2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6020\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Monica Gail\n\n\nTranscriber:\n Dr. Ajda Buchanan\n\n\nAlso Present:\n Dr. Lisa Chu\n\n\nForeword:\n The following conversation took place after 27 days of non-communication from SCP-6020. A trigger for this behaviour has not been determined. Staff members had been visiting SCP-6020 each evening to attempt to speak with it. On this occasion, SCP-6020 called out to doctors Gail, Buchanan, and Chu as they approached it. This is the first and so far only occasion on which SCP-6020 has initiated communication.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Take the bones away.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n Hepolokoli?

You still do not understand. If you understood you would despise me. I cannot be helped. I should not be helped.

Nothing but bones. You all leave me. I hate them for leaving me behind. Wretched things. Wretched bodies. Wretched, wretched god.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n What\u2019s happened, Hepolokoli? We want to help- I mean, to do whatever it is you need from us, but you have to tell us what\u2019s wrong. Please?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Miserable, worthless god. Make the plants grow. Make the children smile. Make the pain less. Silly little god. It was nothing. Nothing. I could not shake mountains. I could not make the wind carry more than seeds. I could not turn a spear, or knife. I could not break a strand of their hair.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n Whose hair?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n I could have given them food. All the food, had they wanted.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n Who are you talking about? Your people?\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n No. \n[pause]\n No. They came for my people. Broke their skulls. Tore their skin. My happy, trusting people.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n Hepolokoli, I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n Do not pity me! Loath me! Hate me! It's my fault! All of this. They came to me and I killed them. My people. When the killers came, they ran to me. To my fruit and flowers and stones. They could have scattered into the forests but they came to me instead, and prayed and sang and knelt in the soil as they were hunted. They believed I could save them. They asked their silly little fruit-giver, life-blesser, their miserable, stunted god, to turn aside the invaders, to save their land. They begged me. They begged as they were cut and smashed to pieces, right in front of me. They would not run, because of me. And all I could do was to make them smile. Despicable. All gone. All smiling. All my fault.\n\n\nSeveral researchers begin to approach with shovels.\n\n\nSCP-6020:\n No! No! Leave them. Leave them alone. I deserve them. Leave the bones. Let them hurt me. Let them hurt.\n\n\nDr. Gail:\n Hepolokoli, we won't touch them if you don't want us to, but would it help to have them gone for a little while?\n\n\nDr. Buchanan:\n We can always put them back later?\n\n\nSCP-6020 refused to resume conversation.\n\n\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3 \u2013 Dr. Nasmyth's Proposal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nAll information pertaining to Dr. Nasmyth's Proposal has been removed from this page.\n\nAuthorised personnel may continue to access this information via the the \nO5 Proposal Database\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

Dr. Stanworth is likely (mis)recalling the near eradication of Gros Michel bananas from disease in the 1950s, or recent concerns about a similar event befalling Cavendish bananas. The threat was to their industrial production, not to the persistence of their species, and as such preservation is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6019\n | SCP-6020 | \nSCP-6021\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6020\n\" by Uncannyon, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
