Despite this, the bag is in remarkably good condition with little notable wear.\n\n\nWhen any person opens SCP-4412, a single object will manifest inside.\n1\n When the bag is closed, the object will demanifest unless removed. No consistent pattern has been identified between these objects; however, subjects frequently believe the object retrieved suggests an alternate, more ideal outcome, to a scenario specific to their personal history.\n\n\nAddendum 4412-1: Test Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nObject Manifested\n\n\nPerceived Significance\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Stanley Diamond\n\n\nA 2-inch binder containing an incomplete list of incidents during 2015.\n\n\nDr. Diamond believed that the object was from an alternate series of events in which he had prevented a containment breach of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that had left him with multiple facial wounds.\n\n\nDr. Diamond later spent several days examining records of the SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 breach. Analysis at the time of the incident suggested that the probability Dr. Diamond could have prevented the breach was negligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Cedric Fourier\n\n\nA gold-banded diamond ring.\n\n\nAgent Fourier's fianc\u00e9 had broken off their engagement shortly before his employment by the Foundation. While he had never seen the ring before, he remarked that it was \"one he would have liked\".\n\n\nSo far, these connections have been very circumstantial. We need more research to determine if manifestations are actually from some sort of alternate history, or if there's a cognitohazard at play here.\n - Dr. Hart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Kevin Gates\n\n\nA Samsung-brand smartphone.\n\n\nResearcher Gates quickly placed the object back inside SCP-4412 and closed it, causing it to demanifest. He declined to elaborate on its significance, but was notably distressed.\n\n\nSee Addendum 4412-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4412-2:\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n For several days after his experience with SCP-4412, Researcher Gates was notably distressed. This interview was conducted as a follow-up.\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/5/5\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Kenneth Hart\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Researcher Kevin Gates\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Good afternoon, Researcher Gates, I will be asking you some questions regarding your exposure to SCP-4412.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n C'mon, Kenny. Don't be so formal, we're still friends.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Just humor me. I know you hate interviews, but we have to do this. Can you tell me what happened during the test with 4412?\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n It just\u2026brought back some bad memories, that's all.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n What kind of memories?\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I already did the follow-up, why are we doing this again?\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n This isn't just about 4412, Kevin. Ever since the test\u2014 you've been acting different. You're distant. Some people have even been wondering if you're still fit for duty.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I'm being let go?\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Hold on Kevin, I didn't say that.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Agent Parker set you up to this, didn't he? He was nagging me about this the other day.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Calm down, this has nothing to do with Parker. I need to know what happened with 4412 so we can help you get back on track.\n\n\nResearcher Gates sighs deeply and looks back down at the table.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Okay. Let's get this over with.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Let's start from the top. When were these memories from?\n\n\nResearcher Gates shrugs.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Kevin, please answer the question. It\u2019s okay.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n About\u2026 sixteen years, I think.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n That's about how long you've been here, right? Is this about your entrance into the Foundation?\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Not\u2026 exactly. Kind of.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nResearcher Gates closes his eyes.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n It\u2026 it was about my sister.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Sister? You\u2026 never told me you had a sister.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I don't talk about her very much anymore.\n\n\nResearcher Gates squints his eyes shut. He begins to slowly rock back and forth in his seat.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Kevin, you can tell me what happened. I\u2019m not going to judge you.\n\n\nResearcher Gates softly sighs as he opens his eyes.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Yeah. I can see why Parker put you up to this.\n\n\nHe chuckles.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n So, Laura. Sweet girl. She was planning to go to college and study to be an anesthesiologist. We were very close. She was the only person in my family that cared enough to look past my flaws. But then I\u2026 uh\u2026 I made some poor choices.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n What did you do?\n\n\n12 seconds pass.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Go on. It\u2019s alright.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Me and my boyfriend at the time, we\u2026 we uh\u2026 we broke up. I won't go into the details, but the important part is that I didn't take it very well.\n\n\nResearcher Gates sighs.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I hit the closest bar. My sister needed a ride home from her friends\u2019 and, like an idiot, I told her I'd do it. Left out that I was drunk. You can probably put together what happened.\n\n\n\n\nA moment passes.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n She's dead?\n\n\nResearcher Gates nods softly.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I\u2026 I'm sorry. That's rough.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n The Foundation already had their eye on me, and apparently DUI and manslaughter charges weren't enough to make them retract their offer. That made it a choice between prison or Foundation employment. I think you know the rest.\n\n\nResearcher Gates takes a deep breath and looks up at Dr. Hart.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I'm not \u2014 I think we've learned enough for today, haven't we?\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n You still haven't told me how 4412 factors into this.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Kenny, please. I know you\u2019re trying to help me, but I\u2019d be better off left alone.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I won't ask you about this ever again, I promise. Just tell me.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n On the lock screen, there was a missed call from her old number.\n\n\nResearcher Gates begins to cry softly.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n It was from that morning.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I'm sorry, Kevin. I know this is hard for you.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n Not a day has gone by that I haven't wondered if it could have gone differently. If only I hadn\u2019t been such a coward. If I hadn\u2019t been, Alex wouldn\u2019t have cut me loose. If only I hadn't walked into that bar. If only I had told her \nno\n. If only I hadn't been going so \nfast\n. Now I know. I\u2026 I can't bear it. That bag is taunting me. It's taunting me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Don't be too hard on yourself. We don't dwell on what could have been different.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n You don\u2019t get it, Ken. Some version of myself apparently knows how to handle his emotions properly. Not this one! This one had to get wasted and drive with his sister in the back seat. This one\u2026\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I'm sorry, Kevin. I don't know what else to say.\n\n\nResearcher Gates:\n I just wish I could go back\u2026 do it over again\u2026 if only just to let her know I loved her one more time.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
