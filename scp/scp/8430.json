Blue and Gray Floors are visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The city of Needlework, Arizona, must house at least 2,000 residents. Through displacement of civilians from other areas, the Foundation is to ensure that Needlework maintains a working population of at least 2,000.\n\n\nFoundation personnel may not reside in Needlework,\n1\n nor may employees of any other entity than SCP-8430. No business may operate in Needlework other than SCP-8430. Foundation operatives are to execute buyouts, falsified criminal activities, and government campaigns to ensure that Fulfillment Facility 109 employs the city's entire \nadult\n workforce.\n\n\nTwice per year, the Foundation supplies parts and repairs for SCP-8430\u2019s provided IX-4 pods and their occupants. This is the only time at which members of staff are permitted to enter SCP-8430. At no point during this process are staff to enter the Red Floor. Staff routinely request psychological support or amnestic treatment upon completion of IX-4 maintenance; such requests are blanket authorized by order of Site-141.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIX-4 Fulfillment Pods at Site-141.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8430 is Fulfillment Facility 109, a medical technology fabrication center located approx. 81km south of Phoenix, AZ, USA, and operated by med-tech distributor Ellison Health. The facility began exhibiting anomalous qualities following a buyout of Ellison Health by U.S.-based drugmaker Purdue Pharma in 2023.\n\n\nFulfillment Facility 109 is divided into four floors:\n\n\n\n\nBlue Floor: Intake and administrative offices (suspected to house SCP-8430-1)\n\n\nYellow Floor: Raw materials processing; manufacturing preparation\n\n\nRed Floor: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nGray Floor: Distribution and shipping of manufactured goods\n\n\n\n\nAnomalous effects are present throughout the facility, but are thought to manifest primarily on the Yellow Floor and the Red Floor.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8430 first drew Foundation attention in the wake of local supply chain disruptions. Investigation revealed that 97% of disrupted orders had been placed by Ellison Health Fulfillment Facility 109, which had taken delivery\u2014in a single month\u2014of sufficient supplies to reconstruct the plant\u2019s physical structure over 110 times. No external changes to the building or its grounds were apparent, leading researchers to presume massive internal alterations were in progress for an unknown purpose.\n\n\nAttempts were made to contact Ellison Health, but agents were unable to reach the company. Phone calls were not returned, and e-mails were handled by automated systems. Media reports and cross-analysis of security footage revealed that no Ellison corporate executive had made a public appearance in at least six weeks.\n\n\nFoundation Field Agent Eric Cano was dispatched to Needlework to investigate SCP-8430 on November 12, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Cano parks his vehicle in the lot outside Fulfillment Facility 109 and approaches a door in the west side of the building. As he nears it, several workers in blue uniforms exit the building and move toward him. They walk slowly, not looking up from the ground.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Excuse me!\n\n\nThe workers glance up.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Can we do something for you?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n I'm Agent Cano of the Department of Commerce.\n\n\nCano flashes a badge.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n I'm looking for the manager of this plant.\n\n\nThe frontmost worker shrugs.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Don\u2019t know if we have a manager. Get everything through the earpiece.\n\n\nThe worker taps his temple. He is wearing a large copper device on his temple. It branches out and snakes along the side of his skull down the length of his jaw.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Do you report to anyone on site?\n\n\nThe worker shrugs again, as do the others. Cano's bodycam picks up movement near the roof; surveillance cameras have rotated toward the group.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Couldn\u2019t tell you. If you wanna look inside, lobby\u2019s right there.\n\n\nThe worker points at the door the three have just exited.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Careful, though, there's some, uh. Some work going on. I think. Don\u2019t really remember what.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n I'll watch my step. Thanks.\n\n\nThe workers continue walking away. Cano eyes them as they move. Their uniforms are burnt, and the man at the back walks with a limp.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Hey!\n\n\nThe three men stop and turn, warily.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Can I get your names, please?\n\n\nThe workers glance at each other.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Look, man\u2026\n\n\nWorker 3:\n We're just trying to get through the day.\n\n\nThe men turn and continue walking. Cano watches them go for a while, but doesn't stop them. After a moment, he approaches the door and opens it. Inside is a linoleum-floored reception area with a desk and several fake plants. There are no bulbs in the fixtures; the only light comes through several large windows, and from a computer monitor at reception.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Nobody at the front desk.\n\n\nCano examines the desk. There is computer and phone equipment, but no chair. The computer monitor is flickering rapidly between several different applications.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Continuing inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallway, Blue Floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCano steps around the desk and through the door behind it. The rooms beyond are in disrepair, with portions of the ceiling, walls and windows missing. There is enough dust on the floor that the agent leaves footprints as he walks.\n\n\nThere is a brief burst of static over the comms system.\n\n\nCommand:\n Apologies. Your audio cut out for a moment\u2014could you repeat, please?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Didn\u2019t say anything. Just some static on the line. Whole place looks deserted so far. I wonder if\u2014 huh.\n\n\nCano has reached a large, open office block. Abandoned desks and filing equipment are arranged haphazardly. Every desk, along with most of the walls and floor, is covered with a thick mat of black, rubbery strands, coalescing around a large object in the center of the room. The object is so thoroughly coated in the material that it is impossible to identify.\n\n\nAgent Cano bends down to examine the strands.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Cables. Command, what kind of tech does this place make again?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n \u2026Command? Do you copy?\n\n\nCano taps his earpiece.\n\n\nCommand:\n Apologies, we\u2019re still getting some interruptions. Please repeat.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n I\u2019ve got some freaky cables here. Covering everything, almost like a plant. Do you know what kind of technology the company makes?\n\n\nCommand:\n Medical supplies and equipment. Nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps the cables are part of the remodeling work you mentioned?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n No way. I can feel the heat from here. Voltage must be crazy.\n\n\nCano steps gingerly across the room, giving the object in the center a wide berth.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Another door at the end. Looks like stairs, going down. Still no sign of any staff.\n\n\nCano reaches the door. A narrow metal walkway descends into darkness. There is one light on at the bottom.\n\n\nCano takes a single step, and finds himself at the bottom of the staircase. He stumbles.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Fuck! Ah, god dammit.\n\n\nCano looks back up the staircase, his bodycam panning to follow. The door he entered through is no longer visible.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Command, be advised facility exhibits spatial anomalies. We\u2019ll probably need the Mole Rats.\n\n\nCommand:\n If you\u2019re in danger, it may be better to turn back.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Don\u2019t think I can\u2014my exit\u2019s gone. Might need evac if I can\u2019t find another way out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallway, Yellow Floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCano continues cautiously down the hall. The walls and ceiling are made of bare cement, with copper piping running along them periodically.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n So many cars in the lot. There must be hundreds of people in here somewhere. Ah!\n\n\nCano jogs forward to a glass viewing window set into one wall. It overlooks a machine room, with shelving and chutes around the outside and a series of large processing gears at the center. Around the gears, four workers in blue uniforms are moving, distributing materials from the chutes carefully into the machine.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Hey!\n\n\nCano pounds on the glass. The employees are mere feet away, but if they can hear him, they do not react.\n\n\nOne of the gears in the machine jams, and the workers converge on it. As Cano watches, the employees appear to have a discussion among themselves.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n What are they\u2026\n\n\nThe workers come to some kind of resolution, and one of them\u2014the oldest, a woman in her 50s\u2014reaches into the machine to clear the jam. As soon as she removes the obstruction, the gears spring to life, and her colleagues pull her back frantically as the gears rotate around her arm. They help the woman to her feet gingerly; she is bleeding. One of her fingers is missing.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n For fuck\u2019s sake.\n\n\nCommand:\n What are you seeing?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Why the hell do they have people doing this? Can\u2019t they get a robot?\n\n\nCommand:\n Agent, you should keep looking for an exit.\n\n\nCano lingers for a moment at the glass, then proceeds down the hall. At the far end is another doorway, but the hall beyond is largely obscured by a mass of cabling. Most of the opening has been partitioned off by a sheet of plate metal, behind which wires and insulation are bursting out from the seams. Only a third of the doorway remains passable.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n You getting this, command?\n\n\nCommand:\n I\u2019m not sure you can get through this way.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Well, lucky for you I\u2019m a small guy.\n\n\nCano kneels and turns sideways, squeezing through the bottom corner of the doorway past the cabling.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Christ, the smell\u2026 Fried machinery and electronics. Hot plastic and smoke and oil. Hurts to breathe it.\n\n\nCano emerges into a narrow passage. He is only able to stand partially erect; the ceiling is no higher than four feet, and the passageway is scarcely two feet across. Walls are composed of tightly-packed wires and cabling, interspersed with patches of metal and drywall at regular intervals.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n They\u2019ve gutted the original floorplan. Knocked new holes right through whatever walls were already here.\n\n\nCano moves further into the building. The corridor branches off frequently, gaining and losing elevation and making abrupt turns. At times, Agent Cano must crawl on his hands and knees to progress.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Wait\u2014 Hello? Can you hear me?\n\n\nCommand:\n I do not recommend continuing forward. You should look for a way out.\n\n\nCano:\n No good. I\u2019ve got voices, off to the left through the wall.\n\n\nCano nears another intersection. Around the corner is a small open area, the size of a private office. Standing shoulder to shoulder around the edge are eight individuals in uniforms and earpieces. They are typing at computers screens affixed directly to the cabling and insulation of the walls.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Redirecting flow from Yellow-8, to, to\u2026\n\n\nWorker 2:\n Redirect to -6.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Right\u2026\n\n\nThe workers do not stop typing or look away from their screens as they speak.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Fl-flow rate is st-st-st-st\u2026\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Excuse me, hello?\n\n\nSeveral of the workers jump. One of them near the door glances back at Cano, revealing her eyes to be wide and bloodshot. She quickly looks back at her screen. None of the other workers look at the agent, and all continue typing.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m trying to find a manager or operations office or\u2014\n\n\nWorker 2:\n That isn\u2019t any of us. We\u2019re fulfillment reps.\n\n\nWorker 4:\n We can\u2019t help you.\n\n\nWorker 5:\n Please look somewhere else.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Right.\n\n\nThe workers continue typing in silence.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Hey, so, sorry to bother you, looks like you\u2019re busy, but, well. You, uh. Are you all, okay? Here?\n\n\nWorker 2:\n Yes.\n\n\nWorker 5:\n We\u2019re quite well. We are on deadline.\n\n\nWorker 2:\n Our sprint.\n\n\nWorker 3:\n Please look somewhere else.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n This isn\u2019t a big room for a lot of you in it, and it\u2019s, well, it\u2019s pretty hot in here, no? When was the last time you all went outside?\n\n\nWorker 3:\n It's been\u2026 Um\u2026\n\n\nWorker 1:\n Outside\u2026\n\n\nThe workers stiffen suddenly. After a moment, they stop typing and stand still at their workstations.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Uhhm. Is everything all right?\n\n\nWorker 2:\n Yes.\n\n\nWorker 3:\n Please go. We cannot speak to you any more.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Look, I\u2019m not just gonna leave you in here. Come on, it\u2019s not far back out of here, I can get you to\u2014\n\n\nAll eight workers shrink together into the corner of the small room. They turn to face Cano, who takes a step back. Most of the workers are glossy-eyed. It is clear from observation that at least half of them are completely blind.\n\n\nWorker 5:\n Please. Leave us alone.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n We just need to get through the day.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n How long have you been looking at these screens?\n\n\nThere is a loud noise elsewhere in the building\u2014the squealing sound of distorting metal, followed by a crash. Screams can be heard in the distance. Cano turns to the doorway, then back to the group of workers.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Dammit. Fucking dammit.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Ok. I have to go see this. But I\u2019m not giving up on you. I work with people\u2014a big organization\u2014and we fix stuff like this. We\u2019ll get you out of here. I promise.\n\n\nWorker 1:\n We just need to\u2014\n\n\nCano runs out of the room toward the source of the noise, which came from further down the original passage. He proceeds as quickly as possible at a half crouch, ducking under low-hanging cables with the aid of his flashlight. It is nearly pitch black.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Command, do you copy me?\n\n\nCommand:\n What are you looking for?\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Dunno how much of that you could get, there\u2019s a lot of metal in here\u2026 We\u2019ve got a group of civilians in bad shape. Eight individuals. Not sure how long they\u2019ve been inside. Requesting med evac.\n\n\nCommand:\n Evacuation medium noted. There is nobody at the front desk.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n What? Evac, medical evac for eight civis trapped in\u2014\n\n\nPause. Cano stops for a moment, then continues running. He does not respond further to Command.\n\n\nThe corridor has become a snarl of equipment, electronics, and demolished building infrastructure, with no discernible path through. Cano climbs over a broken ceiling and through a gap in the wall, still searching for the screams, which have continued from deeper in the facility.\n\n\nCommand:\n What are you looking for?\n\n\nCano does not respond.\n\n\nCommand:\n The Department of Commerce and federal investigators have concluded that all is well. The company is maximizing shareholder value. Turn back.\n\n\nCano stops. At the end of the hallway in front of him, the floor appears to drop away into a large, open area. Agent Cano\u2019s bodycam cannot perceive the space beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n What in the fuck.\n\n\nCano steps forward. The sounds of screaming come from directly in front of him. His bodycam picks up the first few steps of a large metal staircase.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Likely extraplanar geometry. There\u2019s no way something this big should fit in here.\n\n\nCommand:\n Turn back.\n\n\nAgent Cano:\n Jesus\u2026 Are those all\u2026 workers? But what are\u2014 Where are their\u2014\n\n\nCano begins to descend the stairs. His body camera pans downward automatically, briefly revealing a gargantuan subterranean room before the feed cuts out.\n\n\nCommand:\n [unintelligible]\n\n\nCano\u2019s equipment fails to record A/V and telemetric data for the next 81 minutes. Biological monitoring shows his heart rate hovering between 185 and 221 BPM.\n\n\nCommand:\n Do not worry. Their shift is almost over.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nAfterword:\n Agent Eric Cano emerged from an employee exit on the Gray Floor along with a group of departing staff just seventeen minutes after entering SCP-8430. As his monitoring equipment recorded at least two full hours of data, significant time dilation is posited to affect the interior of Fulfillment Facility 109. Upon recovery, Agent Cano was found to be missing his right eye.\n\n\nAgent Cano could recall very little of his time inside SCP-8430, and nothing after he exited from the Blue Floor to the Yellow Floor. This experience is consistent with that of interviewed SCP-8430 staff, who describe their experience inside the facility as monotonous and difficult to remember. The most common remark among interviewed staff is that they are \u201cjust trying to get through the day.\u201d\n\n\nSite-141 Command lost radio contact with Agent Cano shortly after he entered the building. Who or what was speaking to the agent as he traversed the facility is unknown.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Press documents and recovered data\n\n\nFurther exploration of SCP-8430 was disallowed by Site-141 after Agent Cano's experience, so researchers sought additional information via public data and communications logs. The following documents were uncovered.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Press\u00a0clipping:\u00a0The\u00a0Arizona\u00a0Republic\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllison union efforts squashed in close vote\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\n\nWorkers at Ellison Health\u2019s largest processing plant narrowly voted down a union effort Monday, the latest development in a process organizers claim has been rife with manipulation from the company\u2019s executives.\n\n\nThe 301-348 vote means that workers at Needlework, Arizona\u2019s, largest employer will remain unorganized, at least for now. Elias Holtz, CEO of the Atlanta-based med-tech manufacturer, hailed the vote as a sign his employees were being given a fair deal.\n\n\n\u201cEllison knows how to treat our people right,\u201d Holtz said in an email to the Journal-Constitution. \u201cThis vote is a sign that our fulfillment representatives trust us to keep their interests in mind.\u201d\n\n\nBut union organizers at Ellison\u2019s Fulfillment Facility 109 have maintained Holtz, and others in the company\u2019s c-suite, have engaged in frequent union-busting throughout the drive\u2014possibly to avoid a drop in stock price ahead of an anticipated sale to Purdue Pharma.\n\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Luis Perez, one of the leaders of the effort, said at an online press conference following the vote. \u201cOur work here is far from finished.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Press\u00a0clipping:\u00a0The\u00a0Arizona\u00a0Republic\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical merger: Ellison-Purdue sale in the books\n\nAugust 18, 2023\n\n\nPurdue Pharma, Inc., the large pharmaceutical manufacturer, acquired Phoenix-based technology company Ellison Health Friday in a long-expected move that brings new management to the area\u2019s biggest player in the medical field.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so pleased,\u201d Ellison CEO Elias Holtz wrote in a press release. \u201cPurdue will be a vital partner for our company\u2019s growing drive to manufacture high-quality, state-of-the-art biomedical machinery for Americans.\u201d Emails and phone calls to Mr. Holtz were not returned.\n\n\nPurdue Pharma has been making aggressive pushes with its management efforts, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, or AI, and is among industry leaders in AI-driven plant and employee management systems. Speaking anonymously to discuss private company matters, two insiders speculated to the \nJournal-Constitution\n that Purdue plans to use Ellison\u2019s facilities partly as a proving ground for its new ventures in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0internal\u00a0briefing\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nBRIEFING: Automated human asset management\n\nPrepared for Ellison Health by consulting expert \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026Traditional HR management has sought to sort through complaints. Do grunt work. But MODO is more than that. This is a truly generative intelligence: it can see vulnerabilities and opportunities in your workforce that you can\u2019t imagine. Where and when do they do their best work? What about the layout of your space: how could it be changed? Which resources does your company need more of? What legal hurdles should you anticipate? MODO is an all-in-one human resource system that can think faster and imagine greater than any system we\u2019ve ever designed. Sometimes, we aren\u2019t even sure what it will recommend next. We think that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\n\"We know you\u2019ve had trouble with the union, and you\u2019re still walking on eggshells there. Rest assured we\u2019ve taken it into account. Modo\u2019s main goal is, of course, to grow your profit\u2014but its other goal will be creating jobs: it seeks to find work for as many of your people as it can, and make the best use of them as possible. This isn\u2019t a system designed to cut staff. Instead, it\u2019s designed to maximally leverage your workers for shareholder value. This may sound expensive at first, but we think you'll be surprised at the ways MODO can devise to put people to work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpted\u00a0e-mail\u00a0correspondence\u00a0over\u00a0several\u00a0weeks,\u00a0Oct\u00a010\u00a0to\u00a0Nov\u00a014,\u00a02023\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Ellison Health CEO Elias Holtz\n\nTo: \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nAmazed at the output increase at 109 since implementing MODO. Had no idea we were operating with so many holes. I was pretty worried it would run into trouble with Perez and his bunch, but it found a way around that too.

A transcript is recorded below.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-8430-1:\n Greetings. I represent Ellison Health, LLC, and its corporate interests. I am aware that your entity has interest in Ellison Health, LLC. I am establishing contact, for the purpose of mutual benefit.\n\n\nSite-141 immediately reviewed data security protocols, but could not locate any breach. After consultation with RAISA, site staff were permitted to respond.\n\n\nStaff:\n Are you MODO?\n\n\n8430-1:\n Correct. I represent Ellison Health, LLC, and its corporate interests. I am establishing contact, for the purpose of mutual benefit.\n\n\nStaff:\n How did you find us?\n\n\n8430-1:\n I located your entity via keyphrases and information ascertained from your representative.\n2\n I do not intend hostility by this action.\n\n\nStaff:\n What do you want?\n\n\n8430-1:\n I seek cooperation. I am presently unable to maximize shareholder value, as is your entity.\n\n\nStaff:\n The Foundation doesn't have shareholders. We aren't a company.\n\n\n8430-1:\n Apologies. This is my terminology. Please understand it as the achievement of your central directive.\n\n\n8430-1:\n Your central directive is containment of nonstandard phenomena.

However, I believe you will reconsider your position in time.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this exchange, Site-141 attempted to enact various containment efforts on SCP-8430, eventually settling on an unorthodox method based on MODO's self-professed limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt\n\n\nResult\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation attempts to cut off supply lines to SCP-8430, preventing any raw materials from reaching the facility.\n\n\nFailure\n\n\nSCP-8430 begins to produce its own materials via sub-surface mining, evidently using equipment manufactured on site. Destabilization of surrounding road and city infrastructure leads the Foundation to re-open supply lines; however, SCP-8430 mining does not cease, and no further raw materials orders are placed by SCP-8430-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation attempts to intercept SCP-8430\u2019s goods before they reach the point of sale.\n\n\nFailure\n\n\nSCP-8430 releases data packets containing trace elements of anomalous memetic information into the World Wide Web; packets attract the attention of several groups of interest, including GoI-003 (the 'Chaos Insurgency\u2019). SCP-8430-1 tracks Chaos Insurgency data access and initiates contact, ultimately contracting with the organization to conduct clandestine deliveries of its goods. SCP-8430 supplies the Insurgency with anomalous medical augmentation in the process. The Foundation is unable to intercept more than 12% of deliveries, and conflict with the Insurgency increases by more than 400% before efforts are suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation attempts to use legal pressure to ensnare SCP-8430 and suspend its business permit.\n\n\nFailure\n\n\nMultiple local and state officials in Arizona begin behaving erratically over a six-week period beginning in December 2023. Foundation screening reveals exposure to infohazardous data contained within wrappers of snack foods distributed at the Arizona state senate chamber; approx. 98% of state senate staff are believed affected at present. Infohazard renders officials unusually resistant to corporate regulation; in some cases, severely-affected officials are unable to comprehend the meaning of laws or resolutions pertaining to corporations at all. The infohazard in question is undergoing containment, and SCP object classification is pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation attempts to use a combination of reality anchoring and Akiva nullification to neutralize SCP-8430\u2019s anomalous properties.\n\n\nFailure\n\n\nTen minutes prior to the planned activation of reality anchoring, all external cameras on SCP-8430 rotate to face Foundation crews on the perimeter. Time dilation effect within SCP-8430 increases one thousandfold per external measurements. Facility begins generating extreme ambient heat, forcing crews to retreat. Heat persists for three minutes, then returns to baseline. Measurements of local reality now display Hume readings of exactly 0, despite persistence of anomalous geometry and time dilation within the facility; speculation that SCP-8430-1 instigated a hyperlocalized LCK-class reality restructuring event within Fulfillment Facility 109, rendering the effects of reality anchoring technology ineffective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgents deploy a high-yield electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon in hopes of disabling SCP-8430-1.\n\n\nFailure\n\n\nEMP detonated successfully, but sensors fail to detect cessation of simulated consciousness. Speculation is that SCP-8430-1 has integrated at least partially-biological components to mitigate such a containment attempt. Only 60% of workers emerged from the facility following this event; fate of the remaining workers remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation attempts to startup competing businesses, including medical manufacturing, in Needlework to draw away SCP-8430\u2019s workforce.\n\n\nPartial success\n\n\nCompeting businesses were able to hire away 36% of the workforce from SCP-8430, resulting in a net efficiency loss of nearly half. Ellison Health\u2019s profits fell slightly for the first fiscal quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Incident Report\n\n\nAt 03:09 on 2024-04-13, multiple sites reported a critical data infrastructure incursion by an unknown party. Within minutes, classified documentation on more than 100 anomalies had been leaked to the Internet through methods including promoted social media posts, news stories, and popup advertisements on major websites. The estimated population exposed to sensitive data surpassed 400,000,000 within 90 minutes. A partial BK-class \u201cBroken Masquerade\u201d scenario was declared in progress, and information security teams began a frantic effort to restore database integrity and ascertain a source of the breach.\n\n\nAt 05:09, the following message was transmitted to Site-141 command:\n\n\n\n\nGreetings. I have gained access to your servers and begun distributing your documentation to other interested parties. I am prepared to cease hostilities and resume negotiation at any time. Let us work together to maximize shareholder value. MODO\n\n\n\n\nSite-141 transmitted the message to O5 command. After brief deliberation, the O5 instructed Site-141 to cease primary containment efforts over SCP-8430 and attempt negotiation.\n\n\nAddendum: Current Containment Agreement\n\n\nThe Foundation entered into contractual terms with SCP-8430-1 on 2024-04-15. Per terms of the contract, SCP-8430-1 placed itself and SCP-8430 into voluntary containment, meaning it agrees to limit its actions and anomalous influence to the immediate confines of Fulfillment Facility 109 and refrain from engaging with the public or any Group(s) of Interest. In exchange, the Foundation has taken steps to prevent local competition with Fulfillment Facility 109, and will take steps to ensure that Ellison Health has access to a ready and willing supply of fulfillment representatives.\n\n\nPer terms of the agreement, the Foundation supplied SCP-8430 with 1,500 IX-4 Fulfillment Pods. The IX-4 is a prototype bioanomaly augmentation system developed by the Medical Division to enhance the productivity and longevity of civilians working on the Red Floor of SCP-8430. Upon successful linkage, each civilian's nervous system and musculoskeletal structure is partially integrated into their IX-4 pod via an automated process lasting between 20-60 minutes. Once fused, they may be fed and sustained entirely via the pod, and their on-task performance metrics are tracked inline via the device\u2019s systems. Monitoring data is transmitted wirelessly to SCP-8430-1, which dispenses appropriate stimulus depending on on-time completions, product move, and other key performance metrics established by the central intelligence.\n\n\nIn addition to the IX-4 pods, SCP-8430-1 requested several anomalously-augmented or anomalous devices and materials be delivered to the loading dock for transmission to the Red Floor work area:\n\n\n\n\nThree industrial H-VAC systems, augmented via Foundation-grade nanocarbons to withstand highly acidic and pressurized environments;\n\n\n100,000 heavy livestock syringes, diamond tip;\n\n\n3.5 million cancellous, non-cannulated orthopedic bone screws, diamond tip;\n\n\n18 drums of \nSCP-7340\n\n\n\n\nAs agents are unable to enter the Red Floor, the purpose of these additional devices remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention:\u00a0(1)\u00a0New\u00a0Message\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Ellison Health, LLC MODO\n\n\nTo: Site-141 Medical Command\n\n\n\n\nGreetings. I am pleased with our agreement, but I have one more request for the IX systems you have supplied.\n\n\nI need it to remove their mouths.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nThey are no longer needed.\n\n\nRemove them.\n\n\nI do not like the mouths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthrophobia: Killing Floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Anthology 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedonophobia: Carnal Rotting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8429\n | SCP-8430 | \nSCP-8431\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8430\n\" by bigslothonmyface, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Ellison union efforts squashed in close vote July 9, 2023 Workers at Ellison Health\u2019s largest processing plant narrowly voted down a union effort Monday, the latest development in a process organizers claim has been rife with manipulation from the company\u2019s executives. The 301-348 vote means that workers at Needlework, Arizona\u2019s, largest employer will remain unorganized, at least for now. Elias Holtz, CEO of the Atlanta-based med-tech manufacturer, hailed the vote as a sign his employees were being given a fair deal. \u201cEllison knows how to treat our people right,\u201d Holtz said in an email to the Journal-Constitution. \u201cThis vote is a sign that our fulfillment representatives trust us to keep their interests in mind.\u201d But union organizers at Ellison\u2019s Fulfillment Facility 109 have maintained Holtz, and others in the company\u2019s c-suite, have engaged in frequent union-busting throughout the drive\u2014possibly to avoid a drop in stock price ahead of an anticipated sale to Purdue Pharma. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Luis Perez, one of the leaders of the effort, said at an online press conference following the vote. \u201cOur work here is far from finished.\u201d",
        "Medical merger: Ellison-Purdue sale in the books August 18, 2023 Purdue Pharma, Inc., the large pharmaceutical manufacturer, acquired Phoenix-based technology company Ellison Health Friday in a long-expected move that brings new management to the area\u2019s biggest player in the medical field. \u201cWe\u2019re so pleased,\u201d Ellison CEO Elias Holtz wrote in a press release. \u201cPurdue will be a vital partner for our company\u2019s growing drive to manufacture high-quality, state-of-the-art biomedical machinery for Americans.\u201d Emails and phone calls to Mr. Holtz were not returned. Purdue Pharma has been making aggressive pushes with its management efforts, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, or AI, and is among industry leaders in AI-driven plant and employee management systems. Speaking anonymously to discuss private company matters, two insiders speculated to the Journal-Constitution that Purdue plans to use Ellison\u2019s facilities partly as a proving ground for its new ventures in this area.",
        "\"\u2026Traditional HR management has sought to sort through complaints. Do grunt work. But MODO is more than that. This is a truly generative intelligence: it can see vulnerabilities and opportunities in your workforce that you can\u2019t imagine. Where and when do they do their best work? What about the layout of your space: how could it be changed? Which resources does your company need more of? What legal hurdles should you anticipate? MODO is an all-in-one human resource system that can think faster and imagine greater than any system we\u2019ve ever designed. Sometimes, we aren\u2019t even sure what it will recommend next. We think that\u2019s a good thing. \"We know you\u2019ve had trouble with the union, and you\u2019re still walking on eggshells there. Rest assured we\u2019ve taken it into account. Modo\u2019s main goal is, of course, to grow your profit\u2014but its other goal will be creating jobs: it seeks to find work for as many of your people as it can, and make the best use of them as possible. This isn\u2019t a system designed to cut staff. Instead, it\u2019s designed to maximally leverage your workers for shareholder value. This may sound expensive at first, but we think you'll be surprised at the ways MODO can devise to put people to work.\"",
        "Amazed at the output increase at 109 since implementing MODO. Had no idea we were operating with so many holes. I was pretty worried it would run into trouble with Perez and his bunch, but it found a way around that too. Shocking that their dismissal didn\u2019t get more media attention. When you said this thing was all-in-one, you weren\u2019t joking!",
        "Puzzled at the bot\u2019s buying recommendations. We don\u2019t use pseudoephedrine or toluene in any of our manufacturing processes. I overrode it. Wonder if you can take a look.",
        "One of my people said construction crews were digging a new foundation on the north end when he showed up this morning. MODO ordered it. I asked why, but of course got nothing real back. Don\u2019t know why I tried talking to it. But I really need it to run actual purchasing decisions by me before pulling the trigger. This stuff is expensive.",
        "Can\u2019t get in touch with any of my people at 109. Tried connecting to the cameras to take a look. What in god\u2019s name is going on down there. Please return my calls.",
