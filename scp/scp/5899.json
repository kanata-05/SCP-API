SCP-5899 is to be supplied with 1\u00a0kg of plastic once a day. Bovines are not to enter within 500 meters of SCP-5899's containment chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5899 is a Laotian-American male, 183\u00a0cm in height, who is capable of transmuting matter into organic matter and creatures superficially similar to members of the subfamily \nBovinae\n, often with extreme physiological changes (hereafter referred to as SCP-5899-1 instances). To date, SCP-5899 has not created any nonanomalous member of \nBovinae\n without significant changes to its physiology.\n\n\nSCP-5899 was discovered within the town of Dance With Death, California, attempting to transform an individual's house into \"a giant cow.\" Subject managed to transform the walls, roof, and several items within the house into creatures resembling different species of bovine. SCP-5899 stated it was doing this to settle a dispute. SCP-5899 and all SCP-5899-1 instances were transported to Site-551 for study.\n\n\nSCP-5899 is passive and compliant with Foundation staff, and has agreed to not damage its containment chamber in exchange for a small amount of material to \"experiment with\" every day. Site Administration has chosen plastic for this exchange.\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n Abridged Testing Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #\n\n\nResults\n\n\nStatements by 5899\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nSCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling a dairy cow with extremely large horns. Each horn is 3 meters in height and is black in color. Additionally, the instance did not possess a heart and instead had a third kidney in place of a heart. The instance was unable to carry the weight of these horns and died shortly after conception.\n\n\n\"Bah, too heavy. Forgot the heart too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nSCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling a water buffalo with enlarged eyes and hooves and a smaller mouth. The SCP-5899-1 instance immediately vomited a mixture of stomach acid and blood while falling to the ground. The instance died shortly after.\n\n\n\"Horns are fine but now everything's all fucked up. Ugh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nSCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling an African buffalo. Subject had no eyes or mouth, and was incredibly small for a member of its species. Despite this, the subject managed to live for several hours after conception, ultimately dying due to dehydration.\n\n\n\"Much better, much better, I think I got it this time!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nSCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling an unknown species of bovine. The instance had seven eyes, three mouths, fifteen ears and eighty-seven anuses. Instance died immediately after conception.\n\n\n\"Nope, still fucked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2:\n Interview Log\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWED:\n SCP-5899\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Agent Jean\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n Excuse me, SCP-5899, do you have a moment?\n\n\n(SCP-5899 is holding several handfuls of beef, which are purple in color.)\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n Good timing actually, just got done with my fifteenth batch. I'm skipping creating animals and instead creating meat to see if I can get some beef.\n\n\n(Silence)\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n I don't think beef would be purple.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n Would be?\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n Yes, what about it?\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n I'm confused by what you mean. Uh\u2026 we have some beef you can use as reference if you-\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n No, no you don't.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n I'm saying you don't have beef. I highly doubt you have any, considering it hasn't been made yet.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n I don't think I follow.\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n I can tell you that no beef exists in this world right now.

They just don't. There's no proof. They don't exist\u2026\n\n\n(Silence)\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n But they \nshould\n.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n What do you mean by, \"they don't exist?\"\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n They just don't! But they're valued by Americans all around the world, for their milk and meat, and if I'm gonna die, I wanna die knowing I did humanity a favor.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n We have footage and pictures of cows and\u2026 well, it wouldn't take much to just bring one to you.\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n Faked. Faked cows. Simple as that. Not real cows, because real cows don't exist.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n B-\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n Listen, kid, I want cows to exist as much as the next simpleton, and I don't like saying they don't exist because I wish they did, but I'm doing my best here, and by giving me the stuff needed to transmute, I can refine the perfect specimen, breed it, and give humanity something to thank me for.\n\n\nAgent Jean:\n A-alright\u2026 excuse me for one moment, I need to get something.\n\n\nSCP-5899:\n Take your time.\n\n\n(Agent Jean exits the room. Silence for several minutes.
