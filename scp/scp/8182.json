SCP-8182 has demonstrated minor physical capabilities, being able to displace objects weighing up to 5kg. With the exception of D-8182, SCP-8182 can not be perceived without the aid of specialized ectological equipment. D-8182 is a 23 year old human female. Prior attempts at isolating SCP-8182 have resulted in severe psychological distress in both entities. Due to ease of containment and low priority no further attempts are to be made at this time.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8182 was initially discovered and contained on October 21st, 2024.

D-8182\u2019s personal electronic devices were subsequently implanted with standard foundation monitoring programs.
