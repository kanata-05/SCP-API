Additionally, Omicron-88's responsibilities include:\n\n\n\n\nadministering regional air traffic controllers under the guise of local military authorities in order to maintain a 5\u00a0km no-flight zone around SCP-4294.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoordination with local emergency and disaster relief services in order to minimize civilian casualties during and following an Inquiry Event. (Defined as SCP-4294 descending to a height of below 1km.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninvestigation into the identity of POI-4294-01 \"Maxine\".\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4294 is a roughly 3\u00a0km long tendril of flesh, visually identified as an enormous ovary with free-hanging fallopian tube. SCP-4294 is capable of flight at speeds observed up to 75\u00a0km/h, typically remaining at a height of roughly 10\u00a0km.\n\n\nSCP-4294 is perpetually surrounded by a severe snowstorm with wind speeds in excess of 130km/h. Visibility and maneuverability impact due to extreme blizzard conditions render attempts to intercept or engage with conventional aircraft and munitions currently impractical.\n\n\nAddendum 4294.1:\n Discovery / Initial Inquiry Event\n\n\n\n\nDarvaza gas crater.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4294 was first sighted emerging from the Darvaza gas crater\n1\n in Derweze, Turkmenistan on 2/20/2000. Foundation assets arrived on-site 2 hours following reports of initial manifestation. Extensive wind and ice damage were found present within a ~4\u00a0km radius of the crater.\n\n\nAshgabat local Gulshat Abdulov was recovered sheltered within an overturned truck near the initial manifestation point.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Gulshat Abdulov\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Alexander Grant\n\n\nForeword:\n Dialogue has been translated from Turkmen to English for the purpose of this log. Interview was conducted following Mrs. Abdulov's extraction to Site-75 and treatment for acute hypothermia.\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n Good afternoon, Mrs. Abdulov. How are you feeling?\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n I'm feeling much better today. My leg doesn't feel like pins and needles are in it anymore. And look!\n\n\n[Mrs. Abdulov withdraws the sheet from her lower body to reveal her legs.]\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n The blue tinge has gone away! Thank you all so much for helping me.\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n You're very welcome, ma'am. Perhaps, if you're feeling up to it, I could ask you a few questions about the blizzard that caused this.\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n I\u2026 Yes, of course. Well, it wasn't an ordinary blizzard.\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n In the middle of the summer, certainly not. But we have reason to believe there's more to it than just unseasonably cold weather. Did you see anything else out of the ordinary?\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n Hmm, I don't know. I think, maybe? It is hard to know what was real. I thought I was dying of the cold. Seeing things.\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n What kind of things?\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n \n[Subject begins exhibiting signs of mild distress.]\n\n\nCrazy things. After the wind knocked my truck over, and the heater\u2026 well, the heater didn't work well on a good day. The cold got so painful, so fast.\n\n\n[Subject clears her throat and pauses for several seconds.]\n\n\nI was still so close to the Door to Hell. I tried getting out and trying to run to it. I thought it would be better to jump in to the fire than die in that hellish cold. But the ice on the door was already too thick. I wasn't strong enough.\n\n\nI don't know how long I was trying to open the door. Handful of minutes, probably. Felt like hours. The whole time, I'm maybe\u2026 20 meters from the crater. Even with the snow, I can still see it pretty clearly, you know, the fires.\n\n\n[Subject trails off and falls silent, appearing contemplative.]\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n Mrs. Abdulov?\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n Sorry, I'm just not sure how to describe it\u2026 From the flames rose up a great bulb of flesh, trailing a long tendril. I didn't know what it was at first, and it just kept going, more and more of it. It must have reached up past the clouds. Hm.\n\n\n[Subject pauses briefly before continuing.]\n\n\nWhen it was all the way out of the pit, just\u2026 floating above the fire, that's when I realized what it is: a colossal ovary at top, and the long tendril the flesh linking it to the uterus. But, there is no uterus. Where the tendril ends, it looks\u2026 ragged. Like it had been hacked, or maybe ripped.\n\n\n[Subject abruptly begins laughing.]\n\n\nThis is not yet even the strangest part. At this point, I am not even trying to open my door anymore, and I am just watching this happen through the truck's windshield. The tendril comes towards me, the ragged end, stretching over towards me like it was being pulled.\n\n\nThe tendril, it is maybe\u2026 shoulder-width on the inside. And the inside comes to face me, like it is looking right into my truck, and I can just see in the darkness inside of it, a wicked old woman's face. A witch. She asks me, \"Where is my daughter? Where is Maxine?\"\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n Are you familiar with anyone by that name?\n\n\nGulshat Abdulov:\n Ha, no chance. I tell her\u2014 well, no, I don't tell her. Inside of the truck is cold, it hurt to breathe by then, but I shake my head 'no'. It seems this is enough for her, the tendril turns away, and lifts up, higher and higher into the sky. As she leaves, I hear her calling \"Come to me, my furtive daughter. I am not cross with you.\"\n\n\nAfter that, I don't know how long before I black out, but when I woke up, I was here.\n\n\nResearcher Grant:\n Thank you very much, Mrs. Abdulov. You've been very helpful.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Subject administered Class-A amnestic and released from Foundation custody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath of Inquiry Event 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4294.2:\n Log of Inquiry Events\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0Inquiry\u00a0Event\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry Event 1\n\n\n\n\nDate of Event:\n 2/20/2000\n\n\nLocation of Event:\n Derweze, Turkmenistan\n\n\nFurther Details:\n Anomaly initiated and concluded questioning of Gulshat Abdulov without incident.\n\n\nSurviving witnesses amnesticised and released from Foundation custody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry Event 2\n\n\n\n\nDate of Event:\n 3/17/2000\n\n\nLocation of Event:\n Hertsa, Ukraine\n\n\nFurther Details:\n Anomaly initiated questioning with two members of \nGoI-0432 (The Hunter's Black Lodge)\n. Altercation concludes with the transformation of both members of GoI-0432 into specimens of \nTriturus carnifex\n.\n\n\nSurviving witnesses amnesticised and released from Foundation custody.

Flight patterns during this period formed a wide, undulating wave, consistent with searching tactics.\n\n\nDespite slowing to an average speed of 20\u00a0km/h, at no point did the anomaly lower to ground level, or engage in questioning with any individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry Event 4\n\n\n\n\nDate of Event:\n 4/3/2001\n\n\nLocation of Event:\n Kangbashi District, Mongolia\n\n\nFurther Details:\n Anomaly abruptly redirected course on 4/1/2001 and moved directly towards a privately owned building in the western Kangbashi district, subsequently discovered to be a defunct and abandoned safehouse utilized by \nGoI-\u03b1-019 (Serpent's Hand)\n.\n\n\nAnomaly subsequently concluded inquiry event. Despite conducting no further Inquiry Events, SCP-4294 will occasionally demanifest and remanifest over periods ranging up to 2 hours. As the anomaly's absence does not diminish the accompanying blizzard, tracking of SCP-4294 during these periods can continue without further modification to containment procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoI 4294-0432-1 following Inquiry Event 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4294.3:\n Inquiry Event 2 log of recovered materials\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\nEyewitness Report Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Aleksander Oliynyk\n\n\nInterviewer:\n \u039f-88 Bathsheba, \u039f-88 Sabrina\n\n\nForeword:\n Mr. Oliynyk was found pinned completely below the abdomen under an overturned stone structure, displaying symptoms of severe frostbite and acute shock.

More Black Lodge gangsters?\n\n\n\u039f-88 Bathsheba:\n No, we're with the military. Can you tell us what happened here?\n\n\nAleksander Oliynyk:\n Witchcraft. The blizzard came so suddenly, the snow first, then the icy wind. Then from the sky came down a thick rope, twitching and fleshy. It thrashed around and screeched with a woman's voice.\n\n\n[Subject's breathing becomes more rapid, and renews attempts to dislodge the pinning structure.]\n\n\nPlease, can't you get this off me? It\u2026 it doesn't really hurt, but I can't feel my legs.\n\n\n\u039f-88 Sabrina:\n More soldiers and equipment are on the way. Please, while it is fresh on your mind, tell us everything you can.\n\n\nAleksander Oliynyk:\n Tell them to hurry. Can't catch my breath. I\u2026 right, the woman's voice. I wasn't sure what she was saying at first, the wind was howling very loud\u2014 I thought that's what it was for a while.\n\n\nThen I saw two of the Black Lodge mobsters were standing in the middle of the street. They were looking up at the flesh, enraptured by it. But they seemed worried, and finally I understood what the woman's voice was saying.\n\n\n[Subject begins hyperventilating.]\n\n\n'I know you're hiding her from me, I see her aura on you. Tell me where my daughter is! Give me back my Maxine!'\n\n\nThey said they don't know her, and oh, how mad she got. 'Liars!' She called them. 'Bastards', and 'bitches' sons', and worse. I never heard such vulgar cursing.\n\n\n'Low-bellied deceitful villains!', 'The grave is too merciful for such slime!', I saw her words wring their bodies into little squiggles. I think they are dead.

A supremely powerful magician, one I believe could rival even the High Karcists of old.\n\n\n \n\nBefore my very eyes I watched as he knelt by the shore of a frozen lake, and with a touch of his hand set the lake's surface to melt in an instant.\n\n\n \n\nI was well hidden, and remained still as he left, and soon returned with a meager band of companions to fish. When I finally revealed my presence to them, he rounded on me with a circumspect glare. Despite his might, he seemed fearful and timid, but I dared not be seen by him as a threat.\n\n\n \n\nI told him my brethren and I could shelter him. He was unwilling, wouldn't say much. Didn't need to. Even from several meters away, I could feel his presence, his aura pressing against me, like heavy air.\n\n\n\nHe was running from someone, but he wouldn't tell me who. All he would tell me was his name. Vladimir. He was adamant about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4294.4:\n Inquiry Event 4 log of recovered materials\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\nLetter discovered discarded by SCP-4294:\n\n\n\n\nMom,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nI love you.\n\n\n \n\nI don't know how to say this. I thought that coming to this backwater dimension, taking on this form would be message enough. Fool that I am.\n\n\n \n\nMom, I'm not your daughter any more. I haven't been for\u2026 well, for a very long time now. I know you still won't understand, but this is who I am.\n\n\n \n\nYou always told me how sacred womanhood was to our witchcraft, but I've come to see that for the lie it is. I've met many wonderful people, women and men, and others I don't yet understand. They're kind-hearted, they don't hurt people.\n\n\n \n\nI'm not your daughter anymore. Truly, I don't know that I ever was. And while I'll always love you, I'm nothing like you. I just want to make people's lives better.\n\n\n \n\nI've gone to a \nhidden library\n with my new friends. You won't find me, so please, just stop looking. Go home. Pretend I died if you must, but stop looking for me.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nVlad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
