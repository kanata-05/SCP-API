All personnel with a Level 2 clearance and above are allowed access to the entity. At least one personnel trained in Morse code is to be present during all tests involving SCP-3538. Use of SCP-3538 for climbing purposes is prohibited, following Incident-3538-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3538 is an Asymmetric D Climbing Carabiner. SCP-3538 possesses a faded logo and the brand name 'Elliot Climbing Co.' on the left interior. SCP-3538 is capable of understanding human speech, despite not possessing any means of listening, and communicates via Morse Code, with an opening of the entity's hinge representing a dot or dash depending on the length of time the hinge is open.\n\n\nWhen communicating, SCP-3538 will often express a desire to return to 'the glory days' and will request to be used for climbing purposes. Should an individual interacting with SCP-3538 inform it that they have previously engaged in climbing, the entity will recount tales and claims involving its prior owner. (See Interview Log-3538-A).\n\n\nA brief list of claims made by SCP-3538 is included below:\n\n\n\n\nClimbing Mt. Everest alone while blindfolded 3 times.\n\n\nClimbing Mt. Roraima with only chalk\n1\n.\n\n\nSaving an orphan, all by themselves, who was stranded in a one-kilometer deep ravine.\n\n\nClimbing a one-hundred-meter Redwood to put a baby bird back in its nest.\n\n\nScaling a courthouse to save a stranded firefighter with a broken leg.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-3538-1:\n\nSCP-3538 was found in Quinn, South Dakota after reports of a clicking noise in Badlands National Park was investigated by police. Foundation personnel planted within local police forces later found and identified the source of the clicking to be SCP-3538 sending out a Morse code SOS signal. Upon recovery, SCP-3538 told personnel its account of how it arrived at its location. (See Recovery Log below.)\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovery\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery Log-3538\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n What the hell is that noise?\n\n\n\n\nControl:\n Could you describe the noise for us, please?\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n Like a clicking sound.\n\n\n[Four minutes recorded is silent except for footsteps and clicking]\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n What the hell?

One second.\n\n\n[Shuffling followed by typing is heard from Agent Rees]\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n Aha! I got it okay so it's, dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot\u2026 SOS? Alright, okay, one minute, it changed up its pattern.\n\n\nControl:\n Please translate and tell us what it\u2019s communicated.\n\n\n[Two and a half minutes pass by as Rees translates SCP-3538]\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n 'Yes, now put me down you filthy animal'. Huh, not a very nice carabiner.\n\n\nControl:\n Can you ask it how it got there?\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n So how did you get down here exactly?\n\n\n[Clicking is heard for five minutes followed by three minutes of silence before Agent Rees is heard talking again.]\n\n\nAgent Rees:\n Okay, so let me get this straight. You were owned by the 'greatest climber alive' and that he was climbing to the top of this mountain to get a stranded princess. Then his rope got cut by an evil bandit to which your owner grabbed his arm, pulled him down with him but both of them fell and died. After all of this, a flood swept you over here and somehow managed to not bury you in the mud? During this entire time, you were sending an SOS signal?\n\n\n[Clicking is again heard followed by silence.]\n\n\n\n\nAgent Rees\n 'Yes, exactly,' Alright, let's get moving out then.\n\n\n<End log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-3538-2:\n\n\nSCP-3538 was interviewed shortly after being contained to determine the entity's origins and legitimacy of previous claims.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-3538-A\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3538\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Baker\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Baker was chosen for the interview with SCP-3538 due to her past with both recreational and competitive rock wall climbing.
