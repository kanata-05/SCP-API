The room is to be monitored by one guard at all times.\n\n\nIn the event of a containment breach, security personnel are required to detain SCP-1268 alive if at all possible; however, if personnel deem SCP-1268 an imminent risk, they are permitted to dispose of it by any means necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1268 is a human male of indeterminate race with brown eyes and black hair. While SCP-1268 is capable of basic motor functions and self-maintenance, it does not appear to be capable of communication, nor does it show signs of \nemotion or\n higher intelligence. It is currently believed to be nonsapient; however, it has demonstrated the ability to use stairs, door handles, and elevators.\n\n\nWhen left to its own devices, SCP-1268 will wander aimlessly until it is in proximity to a large group of people\n1\n; in these situations, SCP-1268 will go into the crowd and slowly move through it. During this process, the behavior of those in the group will be altered in a predictable manner:\n\n\n\n\n0 min to 2 min: No effects are visible.\n\n\n2 min to 7 min: Persons in the crowd are visibly nervous, turning their heads frequently and moving more quickly than before SCP-1268 entered the crowd.\n\n\n7 min to 14 min: Persons other than SCP-1268 begin to experience disorientation and confusion. Some will actively attempt to exit the crowd, although most will continue with whatever activities they were participating in.\n\n\n14 min forward: Almost all persons in the crowd panic and attempt to leave the area by any means necessary. Subjects affected this way show a distinct lack of concern for the safety of themselves and others. Anomalous effects will cease after SCP-1268 is no longer in the crowd.\n\n\n\n\nThe danger of SCP-1268 varies with group size, group density, accessibility of exits, and size of exits. On average, 30% of all persons in a group that has been affected by SCP-1268 will be killed from being trampled or from interpersonal violence. A further 35% will suffer injuries of various severity. SCP-1268 will remain unharmed \nand show no apparent reaction to the event.\n\n\nAddendum:\n A review of available footage has found that, when in a crowd for fourteen minutes or more, SCP-1268 will exhibit a behavior that may or may not be \nlaughter\n.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Due to the inherent expense of testing SCP-1268\u2019s capabilities, the exact group size and conditions necessary to trigger SCP-1268\u2019s anomalous effects is unknown. The phenomenon has been observed to occur in groups as small as 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1267\n | SCP-1268 | \nSCP-1269\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1268\n\" by Communism will win, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
