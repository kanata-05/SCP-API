Do you have a name?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n No, not really. Most of the things people call me are insults.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Oh, uh, alright. Mind if I call you 6642?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n As good a name as any. With that out of the way, why have I already been arrested? I haven't done anything yet.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Yet? Okay, it doesn't matter. Where did you come from?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Some planet called\u2026\n\n\n[SCP-6642 makes strangled noises.]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Uh, okay, I'm not gonna be able to pronounce it with these vocal cords. Big volcanic planet; not really suitable for your species, given your fragility.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n So why'd you come here?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Same reason I go to every planet; I needed to leave the last one.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Turns out I'm wanted by some interplanetary police or something? Anyway, doesn't matter right now. No one ever comes here, so I'm probably safe.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Right\u2026 How do you travel between planets?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I usually steal a ship. They don't\u2026 usually crash so easily.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n And how many planets have you been to?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Lost count a while ago.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Look, it was believable up until the interplanetary police part. Why did you really come here? How do you know any human language, anyway?\n\n\n[SCP-6642 shrugs.]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I really am seeking safety here. You don't need to believe me. As for the language bit, I dunno. I just learn languages as I take forms.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Oh, right, your abilities. Can you show me?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I mean, not right now.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n I'd assume the restraints wouldn't stop you from-\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n No, I'm injured, dumbfuck. I don't really wanna make that worse.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Didn't you take the form of a human after you crashed?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Yeah, and now it hurts to move.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6642-05/21/21:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6642\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Sabrina Kaye\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Oh, it's you again.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Hi, I have some more questions for you.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Eh. I don't really feel like talking today.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n I'll make this quick. What'd your original form look like?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I don't know.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Can you elaborate on that?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n It's pretty simple. I've been taking other forms for as long as I can remember. I don't know what I was.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n That doesn't bother you?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I mean, it does a little bit, but there's no use in worrying about it.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Alright, then. What-\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Hey, I have a question for you. Why am I here? You didn't answer me last time.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Well, uh, the short answer is that you're not normal.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Kind of a shitty reason to imprison someone.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n It's more complicated than that.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I'm sure it is. Look, all you have to say is that my kind isn't welcome here.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n For what it's worth, I'm sorry.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n [sarcastically] Great, thanks. I feel so much better now.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6642-05/22/21:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6642\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Sabrina Kaye\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Hey, how're you doing?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Everything hurts.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Sorry to hear that. You up for more questions?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Sure, I guess. Not like I have anything else to do.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Great. First, did you have any family? Are there more of your kind out there?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I was\u2026 abandoned as a child. So, uh, I don't really know.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Do you know why?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n People tend to dislike me. It is what it is; I can't change it now.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Why did you start traveling?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n As I said, people don't like me. Travel to a new planet, new people; they hate me, too, cycle repeats.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6642-05/23/21:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6642\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Sabrina Kaye\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Feeling any better today?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Not really. It's boring here.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Are you the only person that can talk to me?\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n I mean, if you really hate me, we could probably find a replacement.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n It's not that. No one else has actually said anything to me beyond a \"hello.\"\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Sorry about that. Did you like any of the books I brought you?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Oh. I could bring you some others if you want.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I don't want books. I just want to leave.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nIncident 6642-01:\n On 05/23/21, SCP-6642 escaped containment.

SCP-6642 took a modified humanoid form.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n So, you ran away.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Can you really blame me? It sucks here.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n You could've said something. I'm sure we could've made your life easier.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Nobody listened.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Oh. They\u2026 didn't?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n They all hate me, anyway.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Where is this coming from?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n You didn't realize? Everyone hates me. Everyone has always hated me.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Why do you think that?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Have you seen the way they look at me? Why do you think no one talks to me?\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n This kind of sounds like anxiety.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6642-06/04/21\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6642\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Sabrina Kaye\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n So, someone else is gonna start talking to you.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n What do you mean, no?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n You're the only one that doesn't hate me.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n I really don't think that's true.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Well, no one's gonna admit it, but that doesn't mean it's not true.\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n You'll still see me around; just \ntry\n to be nice.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nSocial Visit 6642-06/15/21:\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Torres:\n So\u2026 Okay, I can't do this.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Torres:\n I can't do this. You're driving me insane.\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n I didn't do anything.\n\n\nDr. Torres:\n Oh my god! Can you just shut up?\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Why do you people hate me so much?\n\n\nDr. Torres:\n You're just really fucking annoying, clearly.

Every time, you think that maybe this one will be different, and it never is.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nSCP-6642:\n Why don't you hate me yet?\n\n\nDr. Kaye:\n Your guess is as good as mine.

Upon subsequent exposures, annoyance will progress towards a general disdain for SCP-6642.\n\n\nKnown forms taken by SCP-6642 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAn extraterrestrial species possessing six legs and a thin abdominal region.
