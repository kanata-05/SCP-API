Mobile Task Force Theta-45 (\u201cKeymasters\u201d) are responsible for on-site monitoring and containment.\n\n\nAs SCP-8945\u2019s public nature and use as a place of worship renders full concealment impossible, containment efforts are instead focused on preventing the location\u2019s effects from manifesting in full as well as ensuring suppression of its anomalous properties from the general public. Foundation assets embedded within the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy are to continue the ongoing restoration project to enable and strengthen containment.\n\n\nArtefacts and building materials removed from SCP-8945 are to be tracked down and returned to SCP-8945 as part of the restoration project.\n\n\nThe population of red junglefowl (\nGallus gallus\n) and domestic chicken (\nGallus gallus domesticus\n) within a 5km\n2\n of SCP-8945 are to be maintained and protected from predation and poaching. If surveys indicate the population has declined below minimum level (determined to be approx. 2,500), additional junglefowl are to be introduced to maintain the population at a safe level.\n\n\nDesignated lighting fixtures of at least 2200 lumens minimum around SCP-8945 are to be kept active and maintained year-round. In the event of sudden power failure, emergency generators must be activated immediately. Failing that, Theta-45 personnel are to set fire to torches surrounding SCP-8945.\n\n\nSCP-8945-1 instances located outside of Provisional Site-71 are to be neutralised with a rooster\u2019s crow, burning rice, and waving orange fabric. Once secured, SCP-8945-1 instances are to be relocated to SCP-8945 for re-containment. Instances of SCP-8945-1 encountered and captured by civilians are to be retrieved from their custody, with appropriate cover story disseminated and any witness accounts discredited. Usage of amnestics are restricted to widespread infestations and are to be approved by Provisional Site-71 command first.\n\n\nDiscovered instances of SCP-8945-2 are to be cordoned off and dismantled in their original locations under the guise of archaeological excavations.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3 is to be contacted only after the closing hours of the temple\u2019s operations (1700 hours local time). Interactions with SCP-8945-3 by civilians and unauthorised personnel are strictly forbidden.\n\n\nPossible manifestations of SCP-8945-4 are being tracked through Foundation webcrawlers and covert investigations teams. In the event a manifestation event is confirmed, Theta-45 is to secure 8945-4 and contain SCP-8945-4 within a standard humanoid containment cell prepared at Site-71. As the full capabilities of SCP-8945-4 are presently unknown, caution is greatly advised.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8945 is the designation for the Prambanan temple compound, a 9th-century Hindu temple located in Bokoharjo, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, approximately 17km from the city of Yogyakarta. SCP-8945\u2019s effects manifest when artefacts and stone blocks compromising the temple are removed. Effects manifest slowly in individuals exposed to the artefacts over approximately 10 to 20 years after their removal, with symptoms resembling a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The known and documented effects of SCP-8945 in affected individuals are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCompulsion to build new infrastructure.\n\n\nA push for centralised development.\n\n\nA dedicated interest in Javanese culture, including a desire to visit SCP-8945\u2019s location and participate in its construction.\n\n\nIncreased fluency in Javanese.\n\n\nIn particularly severe cases, transient memory loss up to and including chronic retrograde amnesia. Individuals with these symptoms are vulnerable to SCP-8945-1 abduction.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8945\u2019s anomalous properties are responsible for various disappearances in its area since the 19th century, although local folklore and archaeological findings dating back to the 9th century recorded events similar to the activation of SCP-8945\u2019s effects.\n\n\nSCP-8945\u2019s full area of effect is unknown at present, though it is believed to be restricted to the island of Java. However, current research indicates that SCP-8945\u2019s influence manifests in areas designated as the capital city or administrative centre of the region. Effects noted in these locations include haphazard transport infrastructure and the creation of widespread urban sprawls. Known locations to have been affected by SCP-8945 are:\n\n\n\n\nJakarta Special Capital Region\n\n\nBandung, West Java\n\n\nYogyakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8945-1 refers to various anomalous entities contained within SCP-8945, the precise number of which is unknown yet believed to number over 5,000. SCP-8945-1 instances are incorporeal until SCP-8945 is activated. When manifested, instances resemble animate stone statues of diminutive human beings of varying height, with the tallest recorded instance measuring approximately 1m in height. Documentation indicates SCP-8945-1 instances are nocturnal, displaying a high sensitivity towards light and possessing acute hearing acuity.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-8945-1 are known to abduct humans \u2013 information gleaned from temple carvings show that abducted individuals are transformed into additional instances of SCP-8945-1.\n\n\nDuring SCP-8945\u2019s active state, instances of SCP-8945-1 venture out of SCP-8945 \u2013 the range of their activities beyond SCP-8945 have thus far been determined to remain within the boundaries of Java. No known instances of SCP-8945-1 have been encountered beyond Java.\n\n\nSCP-8945-2 refers to structures built by SCP-8945-1 outside of SCP-8945. Structures generally follow the architectural style of SCP-8945 \u2013 a central temple in a concentric \nmandala\n. Construction of SCP-8945-2 instances invariably lead to hostile contact with nearby local-communities, as materials for SCP-8945-2 are forcibly requisitioned from the nearest stone structures.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3 is a female humanoid entity visually resembling a stone sculpture measuring 1.5m in height, presently located in the Shiva temple of the SCP-8945 complex. SCP-8945-3 remains cognizant and communicates in Javanese through telepathic means within a radius of 5m, and has provided information vital to the continued containment of SCP-8945.\n\n\nSCP-8945-4 is believed to be a male humanoid entity and the original architect of SCP-8945. Current efforts are ongoing to track down and contain SCP-8945-4 at Site-71. Accounts from SCP-8945-3 indicate SCP-8945-4 possesses attributes above that of a baseline human being, and is responsible for the current state of SCP-8945-3.\n\n\nDiscovery and Early History:\n SCP-8945 was first discovered in 1733 by Cornelie Antonie Lons, a merchant affiliated with the Dutch East India Company (\nVerenigde Oostindische Compagnie\n, or VOC in Dutch), who mentioned \u2018Brahmin temples\u2019 in his travels throughout Java. Further exploration of SCP-8945 was not undertaken until administration of the Dutch East Indies was handed over to the Dutch government in 1799.\n\n\nIn 1806, Dutch archaeologist Hermann Cornelius began the first efforts to restore the temple compound, clearing the area of vegetation and unearthing the main temple building. In his documentation, Cornelius noted the significant population of roosters in the area and the locals\u2019 aversion to the temple grounds.\n\n\n\n\n+Selected\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Journal\u00a0of\u00a0Hermann\u00a0Cornelius,\u00a0translated\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0original\u00a0Dutch+\n\n\n\n\n-CLOSE-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th of June 1806\n\n\nToday we have finally uncovered the main temple structure. Our efforts continue in restoring this magnificent structure, a great temple of Hindu craftsmanship, and it shall continue for however long it needs to be.\n\n\nI must admit, the volcanic ash has been particularly bothersome to clear, but the most curious has been the chicken feed, scattered in the temple grounds. The villagers must have left them there for their chickens, yes, but even in their absence no other animal, not even an ant, would take them.\n\n\nPerhaps the locals could stand to be more appreciative of their legacy, however. None of them seem particularly enthralled with our questions related to this lost temple. What stubbornness! It is of no concern of ours, however. If they would rather deny the honour of this discovery, then so be it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16th of September, 1806\n\n\nAn elder and his son came by our camp today. I will have to reprimand Willem for letting him slip by our perimeter. But he looked harmless enough, so we entertained them for a time at least.\n\n\nThe old man did not speak a word of Dutch, and his son\u2019s command of the language is poor, I must say, but thankfully he knew enough to be understood. The old man claimed to be the village keymaster, here to warn us to leave the old temple undisturbed, and insisted on leaving the chicken feed untouched, as it was his responsibility, and his alone. Not even a patient explanation of our scientific endeavour persuaded him otherwise.\n\n\nThankfully, the old man and his son left without further incident. I instructed Willem to fortify the perimeter. I am not certain, indeed, that this will be the last we see of him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21st of November, 1806\n\n\nOur work continues, and yet I find myself with questions whose answers lie beyond my grasp. I cannot fathom how such a magnificent work could be lost here, for so long, and in such a pitiful state. I found this reflected in its stones, of a finely carved make seen nowhere else in the Indies. The stones do not appear to have come from any of our known quarries in Java. Perhaps there is another source lost to the jungle, but that is a question for another time.\n\n\nIt was today, however, that the villagers made their intent known. A group of youngsters broke into our camp with torches, demanding that we cease our efforts, lest they burn away our work. Our answer came at the barrel of a musket, by Willem\u2019s command. He insisted they could no longer be reasoned with, yet even then, I could hear the hesitation in his voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th of January, 1807\n\n\nI could not rest tonight. Another attempt has been made to break the wooden stockade by the villagers. We repelled them after what must have been hours, their bodies piled high against our walls, at no small cost of our own \u2013 they took Karel and Gunther. But the stockade held, and that is as good as it can be, for now.\n\n\nIt is as I feared. The aura of mysticism and superstition in these pagan lands remain strong and firmly held. In the morning, I will send word to Batavia\n1\n requesting further reinforcements. My resolve has been strengthened. I gave the order to take their livestock, these confounded roosters whose crows plague our mornings. With time, the people will leave us alone with our work.\n\n\nThese sculptures deserve a better home, far and away from these ignorant people. They will find their place in Batavia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis initial effort continued until mid-1807, but lack of funding led to a halt in the project, as the Dutch colonial government under Herman Willem Daendels sought to repel British forces from Java, leading to the construction of extensive fortifications and roads throughout the island.\n\n\nSpread of awareness for SCP-8945\u2019s existence led to looting and theft of various items by Dutch residents and Javanese locals, as souvenirs or building materials. These led to the propagation of SCP-8945\u2019s effects and heightened SCP-8945-1 activity throughout Java, though accounts of these encounters were often dismissed as local superstition by the colonial government.\n\n\nSCP-8945\u2019s anomalous properties became known to the Foundation in 1918, after analysis of historical records, infrastructure development, and anecdotal testimonies from the Java War of 1825-1830 and throughout the 19th century confirmed the presence of an anomaly in the Prambanan temple compound. Funding issues hampered containment efforts, and Provisional Site-71 was only formally established in 1930, with initial containment procedures put into effect. Initial procedures were based on gathered notes from the Special Investigations Board\n2\n regarding numerous anomalous events now known to have been SCP-8945-1 events, and similar anomalies then-known to the Foundation.\n\n\nRecovery Log-8945-1931-5:\n On 07/01/1931, an excavation team from the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences uncovered stone slabs inscribed with Old Javanese text from Ratu Boko Palace, an archaeological site 3km south of SCP-8945. Initial translations and notes from the team indicate a possible connection to SCP-8945. Foundation informants embedded in the team notified Provisional Site-71, and Theta-45 operatives were dispatched to retrieve the inscriptions. Retrieval was successful, and the inscription was then translated and described by Dr. Karl Janssen.\n\n\nAddendum-8945-1: Selected inscriptions from the Ratu Boko Palace slabs, translated from Old Javanese.\n\n\nSee File-8945-1931-5 for full records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory, victory reached at last\n\nBoko and his armies, vanquished\n\nThe kingdom saved and the prince victorious\n\nOf noble heart and deeds\n\nMay the kingdom rejoice and celebrate forevermore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prince called out,\n\nBeautiful Roro, lovely as the morning dawn\n\nCome, dance and cherish this (unintelligible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalamity, fire and (unintelligible)\n\nA terrible fate upon the land\n\nA heart cast in stone, protector and noble lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy heart is yours, Princess\n\nForgive me, and I will give this world unto you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8945-2: Recovery Notes from Dr. Karl Janssen\n\n\n\n\nThe recovery has proven exceptionally fruitful, though I regret that our colleagues at the Society of Arts and Sciences will be disappointed to learn of their missing artefacts. Nevertheless, our current understanding of SCP-8945 has been greatly enriched by the discovery, and they shall be compensated fairly.\n\n\nI\u2019ll note that the items \u2013 the ones that were saved, that is, as most were destroyed by age and what appears to be damage from a volcanic eruption \u2013 were remarkably well-preserved for their time. Certainly weathered, yet this hardly impeded our efforts. Date estimated to be 9th century AD, Mataram era. On the surface, it was consistent thus far with our current understanding of Javanese history, but a closer examination shows that this is not the case.\n\n\nThe slabs spoke of a figure, Prince Bondowoso, a great craftsman and warrior who defeated the demon king Prabu Boko and seized his throne. But this victory, it seems, did not satisfy him. His bride to be was cursed, and the prince sought to undo this. We are not yet certain if he succeeded. Conventional historiography noted the transfer of the Javanese court from Yogyakarta, after the eruption of Mount Merapi.\n\n\nI\u2019ve directed the team to search for further information on Bondowoso. Quite unfortunate, indeed, that the area around Prambanan has been uninhabited for many years.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-1933-2:\n On 15/02/1933, approximately 300 SCP-8945-1 instances breached containment, the largest to date. Instances overwhelmed stationed Foundation personnel and made their way towards the Ratu Boko Palace, an archaeological site 3km south of SCP-8945. Retrieval teams dispatched to site found no traces of SCP-8945-1 instances, but noted damage done to the palace crematorium.\n\n\nFive hours after initial containment breach, during an inspection of SCP-8945, junior researcher Martinus Herianto discovered SCP-8945-3 at the site of the breach \u2013 now known to be the Shiva temple. SCP-8945-3\u2019s anomalous properties manifested as it was moved into its intended pedestal.\n\n\nInterview Log-8945-3 \u2013 15/02/1933:\n\n\n\n\n+Access\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log-8945-3\u00a0\u2013\u00a015/02/1933+\n\n\n\n\n-CLOSE-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8945-3\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Karl Janssen\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview conducted by Head Researcher Dr. Karl Janssen in order to ascertain SCP-8945\u2019s nature as well as that of its constituent anomalies. Translated from the original Javanese.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Right, I suppose we should begin\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n You released him, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n I\u2026 beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n The Prince. I no longer feel his presence here. But his reach is far and wide. I can feel it.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Ah, you speak of Bondowoso, yes?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Do not speak his name. It has been a great many ages, yet I remember his deeds as clearly as I see you now.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n My apologies. But this Prince, could you elaborate further, Madam? How you came to be? The inscriptions spoke of a fate that befell you and your people.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n A fate that befell me? The Prince blasphemed, and cast me as a statue of Durga, our lady protector. He told me that I will guard this temple I asked of him. Perhaps it was atonement, yet I do not accept it.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Asked of him?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Yes. My condition for marriage had been for him to finish a well to provide for the needy, as well as one thousand temples in a single night, no more or less. With the command of his legions, he completed the well. My faithful Patih Gupolo attempted to bury him in earth and fire. But the Prince broke free, and so he set out to fulfil my second condition.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Did he succeed?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Nine hundred and ninety nine had been completed. But the Sun rose before the thousandth, and I denied him.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Noted. As for these legions you speak of, we\u2019ve encountered them, I believe. You need not worry, they have been safely taken care of.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I feel that they are restless. Agitated. The roosters\u2019 crows has gone silent\n3\n. What have you done?\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n As procedure dictated, I assure you. Madam, with due respect, is his request within your powers to fulfil?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I will not.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n People have died.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n As people do, before and after the Prince decided that I was to be his bride. But my answer remains, as it has before. Neither will he change.\n\n\nSilence. Dr. Janssen can be heard shifting in his seat.\n\n\nDr. Janssen:\n Will that be all?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I have nothing left to say to you.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n \nEntity described by SCP-8945-3 has been designated SCP-8945-4. Further investigation is advised to ascertain the nature and present identity of SCP-8945-4. Current containment procedures are to be upheld. \u2013 Dr. Janssen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-1936-8:\n On 30/06/1936, SCP-8945-3 entered an active state as Dr. Martinus Herianto conducted a routine inspection and cleaning of 8945-3\u2019s chamber with Level-1 personnel.

Crude, like this stony prison of mine.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n That doesn\u2019t answer my question\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n You, and those that accompanied you aren\u2019t like the others.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Others?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Yes. I hear whispers in the night. The others come from distant lands, speaking in jest of sleeping beauties and noble princes in daring quests. But this is your land, is it not? Our land.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n I don\u2019t believe that is relevant, Lady Roro.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Is it? I hear your people\u2019s stories, your songs. You know of the story. You speak of my name with such familiarity.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n The story of this temple is well-known, even today. If it\u2019s remembrance that you ask for, then you\u2019ll have found it today.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n And yet you remained silent.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n \n(Laughs)\n I hardly think the Foundation would have much appreciation for fairytales. And you? You haven\u2019t been talkative, either.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3 does not respond\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Lady Roro?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n The stories did not mention it, did it?\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Mention what?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n The fires. His rage. How the land was burnt, and all because I\u2026\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Lady Roro?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I rejected him. My father\u2019s blood was still fresh on his blade when he reached for me, pledged himself to me, and demanded that I do the same.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n You were afraid.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I feared his blade then, as I fear your hammers and chisel now. So I gave him an impossible task, and at the verge of his success\u2026 I could not bear to see it. I commanded the roosters to crow, my servants raised scarves in the air and set paddies ablaze. His legions feared the light and fled the false dawn. But I could not have foreseen his next actions. The thousandth temple was unfinished, and in his anger he blasphemed and cast me into stone.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n And\u2026 the fires you speak of?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n His regret, his anger\u2026 he dropped to his knees and begged forgiveness, which I never gave. The land trembled and shook, and when it was over, the kingdom he\u2019d fought to gain had been buried in ash. My people suffered, because I did not yield.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n For what? It is a burden I carry now and always. You\u2019ve lost your men, too, because I remained silent. I remained silent when the people suffered, when the jungle reclaimed my home, when villages were burnt and torn down, all to keep his will from taking hold. And yet I do not wish to yield. Perhaps this punishment is just.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAfterword:\n \nDr. Martinus reprimanded for improper conduct. Containment procedures based on SCP-8945-3\u2019s testimony tested and implemented. Efficacy in containing SCP-8945-1 increased. \u2013 Dr. Janssen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-1942-ALPHA: Temporary Occupation of SCP-8945\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, Provisional Site-71 was seized by Imperial Japanese authorities in 1942, forcibly transferring custody of SCP-8945 into the Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency (IJAMEA). Although records of SCP-8945 were successfully secured by retreating Foundation personnel, SCP-8945\u2019s anomalous properties were independently discovered by IJAMEA agents. Under IJAMEA direction, Japanese authorities utilised SCP-8945 to condition Javanese civilians for forced labour, known as romusha in contemporary historiography. It is estimated that 10-15 percent of the Imperial Japanese labour force was under SCP-8945\u2019s influence.\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-1949-1:\n Provisional Site-71 and SCP-8945 retaken by a joint Foundation-Indonesian military task force per confidential arrangements made in the 1947 Renville Agreement. As a condition in the agreement, SCP-8945 is to be kept accessible as a public location, under supervision of the Foundation, in exchange for increased funding and aid managed by the newly established \nInstitute for Anomalous Affairs (IAA)\n, a non-ministerial, independent government agency.\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-1954-2:\n After restoration work was declared completed on the Shiva temple in 1953, SCP-8945-3 entered an active state.

My temple as well.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n The President has been quite generous, indeed. Very enthusiastic. It\u2019s all, I must admit, very exciting.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I see. And the Prince?\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Ah. The Prince\u2013 well, despite our best efforts, we have yet to see a single trace of him. But we\u2019ll keep an eye out.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I feel his presence still, yet I cannot find him for certain. The prince is a simple man, good Doctor. My approval is all he seeks. And he will seek to fulfil his goals as best as he can.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n And you believe he will only be satisfied with the completion of this thousandth temple?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I am certain of it. He is a man guided by principles and the letter of the law. If I consider it finished, then it will be so.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n I hope so, then, Lady Roro. If that will be all\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Doctor?\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Yes?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n How do the people fare? It has been a great many years, and now I feel it to be joyous, lonesome as it is.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Well I\u2026 suppose you can say that they are euphoric, certainly. And you need not worry of loneliness. The President ordered the site to be kept open to the public.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Then I shall look forward to it. Thank you.\n\n\nDr. Martinus:\n Likewise, Lady Roro.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAfterword:\n \nInformation was forwarded to IAA. After discussion with Provisional Site-71 staff, we\u2019ve theorised that SCP-8945-4 may be drawn out of concealment with completion of a location designated as a temple, utilising materials from SCP-8945. Approval pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8945-3:\n Under the direction of President Sukarno, the city of Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan, was established in 1957, intended to be the new capital city of Indonesia. Upon its completion, objects and items from SCP-8945 were to be transferred to its location in an attempt to draw SCP-8945-4 and prompt its manifestation, allowing for subsequent containment. However, a dispute with the IAA and President Sukarno led to cancellation of the transfer operation.\n\n\nAddendum-8945-4: Establishment of Site-71\n\n\nAs part of further Foundation outreach in Southeast Asia, Site-71 has been established in East Kalimantan, in order to catalogue other anomalous objects within the Southeast Asian and Indo-Pacific region. In addition, Site-71 succeeds Provisional Site-71 in its mission to monitor possible manifestations of SCP-8945-4 within Indonesia\u2019s borders. Professor Bambang Susantono has been appointed as head of Site-71, and the Foundation maintains a direct line of communication with the Indonesian government through the IAA in order to secure funding.\n\n\nIn accordance to Site-71\u2019s mission, soil from SCP-8945 was taken to Site-71\u2019s ground zero and planted. Dialogue is ongoing with SCP-8945-3 in order to obtain her blessing for Site-71 as a temple.\n\n\nIncident Report-8945-2022-2:\n On 20/12/2022, President Joko Widodo ended a private meeting with SCP-8945-3 as previously arranged. Under request from the IAA, Provisional Site-71 conducted a follow-up interview with SCP-8945-3.\n\n\nInterview Log-8945-3 - 20/12/2022:\n\n\n\n\n+Access\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log-8945-3\u00a0-\u00a020/12/2022+\n\n\n\n\n-CLOSE-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8945-3\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Fatma Dewisari\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-8945-3 was notably agitated during the duration of the interview.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n Good evening, Lady Roro, I trust the evening finds you well?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Dispel with the pleasantries, Doctor. I know what you are here for. And my answer is no.\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n You haven\u2019t heard my question..\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I need not. Your leader has made his intent clear. He seeks my blessing for his pet project.\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n Our project, Lady Roro. The Foundation has given its authorisation for Site-71\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n If you believe it is all that is meant to be, then you are a greater fool than I could ever believe.\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n It was necessary for the funds we needed! The Foundation\u2019s outreach needs collaboration with local governments, Lady Roro, surely you must understand this.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3\n: I understand it all too well. Promises with each passing year. None of them fulfilled.\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Time and again, I feel his presence everywhere. The land is tainted by his presence, which you cannot see. Do you realise this? The people live and flourish beneath his servitude. All so he can find the approval he will never receive.\n\n\nDr. Fatma:\n And what would you do, then, Lady Roro?\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n I look upon the land, doctor. The land which we call home. And it is sick, and ill with his taint. I would love nothing more than to see him, and all he has built, torn asunder.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8945-3 falls silent for a moment.\n\n\nSCP-8945-3:\n Durga was the name they gave me. The name I was given. Who I am known as. It is what they know me as now. Protector and strength, destruction and war. I think I\u2019d like that.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "5th of June 1806 Today we have finally uncovered the main temple structure. Our efforts continue in restoring this magnificent structure, a great temple of Hindu craftsmanship, and it shall continue for however long it needs to be. I must admit, the volcanic ash has been particularly bothersome to clear, but the most curious has been the chicken feed, scattered in the temple grounds. The villagers must have left them there for their chickens, yes, but even in their absence no other animal, not even an ant, would take them. Perhaps the locals could stand to be more appreciative of their legacy, however. None of them seem particularly enthralled with our questions related to this lost temple. What stubbornness! It is of no concern of ours, however. If they would rather deny the honour of this discovery, then so be it.",
        "16th of September, 1806 An elder and his son came by our camp today. I will have to reprimand Willem for letting him slip by our perimeter. But he looked harmless enough, so we entertained them for a time at least. The old man did not speak a word of Dutch, and his son\u2019s command of the language is poor, I must say, but thankfully he knew enough to be understood. The old man claimed to be the village keymaster, here to warn us to leave the old temple undisturbed, and insisted on leaving the chicken feed untouched, as it was his responsibility, and his alone. Not even a patient explanation of our scientific endeavour persuaded him otherwise. Thankfully, the old man and his son left without further incident. I instructed Willem to fortify the perimeter. I am not certain, indeed, that this will be the last we see of him.",
        "21st of November, 1806 Our work continues, and yet I find myself with questions whose answers lie beyond my grasp. I cannot fathom how such a magnificent work could be lost here, for so long, and in such a pitiful state. I found this reflected in its stones, of a finely carved make seen nowhere else in the Indies. The stones do not appear to have come from any of our known quarries in Java. Perhaps there is another source lost to the jungle, but that is a question for another time. It was today, however, that the villagers made their intent known. A group of youngsters broke into our camp with torches, demanding that we cease our efforts, lest they burn away our work. Our answer came at the barrel of a musket, by Willem\u2019s command. He insisted they could no longer be reasoned with, yet even then, I could hear the hesitation in his voice.",
        "5th of January, 1807 I could not rest tonight. Another attempt has been made to break the wooden stockade by the villagers. We repelled them after what must have been hours, their bodies piled high against our walls, at no small cost of our own \u2013 they took Karel and Gunther. But the stockade held, and that is as good as it can be, for now. It is as I feared. The aura of mysticism and superstition in these pagan lands remain strong and firmly held. In the morning, I will send word to Batavia 1 requesting further reinforcements. My resolve has been strengthened. I gave the order to take their livestock, these confounded roosters whose crows plague our mornings. With time, the people will leave us alone with our work. These sculptures deserve a better home, far and away from these ignorant people. They will find their place in Batavia.",
        "Victory, victory reached at last Boko and his armies, vanquished The kingdom saved and the prince victorious Of noble heart and deeds May the kingdom rejoice and celebrate forevermore",
        "The Prince called out, Beautiful Roro, lovely as the morning dawn Come, dance and cherish this (unintelligible)",
        "Calamity, fire and (unintelligible) A terrible fate upon the land A heart cast in stone, protector and noble lady",
        "My heart is yours, Princess Forgive me, and I will give this world unto you",
        "The recovery has proven exceptionally fruitful, though I regret that our colleagues at the Society of Arts and Sciences will be disappointed to learn of their missing artefacts. Nevertheless, our current understanding of SCP-8945 has been greatly enriched by the discovery, and they shall be compensated fairly. I\u2019ll note that the items \u2013 the ones that were saved, that is, as most were destroyed by age and what appears to be damage from a volcanic eruption \u2013 were remarkably well-preserved for their time. Certainly weathered, yet this hardly impeded our efforts. Date estimated to be 9th century AD, Mataram era. On the surface, it was consistent thus far with our current understanding of Javanese history, but a closer examination shows that this is not the case. The slabs spoke of a figure, Prince Bondowoso, a great craftsman and warrior who defeated the demon king Prabu Boko and seized his throne. But this victory, it seems, did not satisfy him. His bride to be was cursed, and the prince sought to undo this. We are not yet certain if he succeeded. Conventional historiography noted the transfer of the Javanese court from Yogyakarta, after the eruption of Mount Merapi. I\u2019ve directed the team to search for further information on Bondowoso. Quite unfortunate, indeed, that the area around Prambanan has been uninhabited for many years.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-8945-3 Interviewer: Dr. Karl Janssen Foreword: Interview conducted by Head Researcher Dr. Karl Janssen in order to ascertain SCP-8945\u2019s nature as well as that of its constituent anomalies. Translated from the original Javanese. <Begin Log> Dr. Janssen: Right, I suppose we should begin\u2013 SCP-8945-3: You released him, didn\u2019t you? Dr. Janssen: I\u2026 beg your pardon? SCP-8945-3: The Prince. I no longer feel his presence here. But his reach is far and wide. I can feel it. Dr. Janssen: Ah, you speak of Bondowoso, yes? SCP-8945-3: Do not speak his name. It has been a great many ages, yet I remember his deeds as clearly as I see you now. Dr. Janssen: My apologies. But this Prince, could you elaborate further, Madam? How you came to be? The inscriptions spoke of a fate that befell you and your people. SCP-8945-3: A fate that befell me? The Prince blasphemed, and cast me as a statue of Durga, our lady protector. He told me that I will guard this temple I asked of him. Perhaps it was atonement, yet I do not accept it. Dr. Janssen: Asked of him? SCP-8945-3: Yes. My condition for marriage had been for him to finish a well to provide for the needy, as well as one thousand temples in a single night, no more or less. With the command of his legions, he completed the well. My faithful Patih Gupolo attempted to bury him in earth and fire. But the Prince broke free, and so he set out to fulfil my second condition. Dr. Janssen: Did he succeed? SCP-8945-3: Nine hundred and ninety nine had been completed. But the Sun rose before the thousandth, and I denied him. Dr. Janssen: Noted. As for these legions you speak of, we\u2019ve encountered them, I believe. You need not worry, they have been safely taken care of. SCP-8945-3: I feel that they are restless. Agitated. The roosters\u2019 crows has gone silent 3 . What have you done? Dr. Janssen: As procedure dictated, I assure you. Madam, with due respect, is his request within your powers to fulfil? SCP-8945-3: I will not. Dr. Janssen: People have died. SCP-8945-3: As people do, before and after the Prince decided that I was to be his bride. But my answer remains, as it has before. Neither will he change. Silence. Dr. Janssen can be heard shifting in his seat. Dr. Janssen: Will that be all? SCP-8945-3: I have nothing left to say to you. <End Log> Afterword: Entity described by SCP-8945-3 has been designated SCP-8945-4. Further investigation is advised to ascertain the nature and present identity of SCP-8945-4. Current containment procedures are to be upheld. \u2013 Dr. Janssen.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-8945-3 Interviewer: Dr. Martinus Herianto Foreword: Interview translated into English from the original Javanese. <Begin Log> Dr. Martinus: With due respect, Lady Roro, may I ask to what do I owe the honour? SCP-8945-3: The Prince continues to stir, I see. Crude, like this stony prison of mine. Dr. Martinus: That doesn\u2019t answer my question\u2013 SCP-8945-3: You, and those that accompanied you aren\u2019t like the others. Dr. Martinus: Others? SCP-8945-3: Yes. I hear whispers in the night. The others come from distant lands, speaking in jest of sleeping beauties and noble princes in daring quests. But this is your land, is it not? Our land. Dr. Martinus: I don\u2019t believe that is relevant, Lady Roro. SCP-8945-3: Is it? I hear your people\u2019s stories, your songs. You know of the story. You speak of my name with such familiarity. Dr. Martinus: The story of this temple is well-known, even today. If it\u2019s remembrance that you ask for, then you\u2019ll have found it today. SCP-8945-3: And yet you remained silent. Dr. Martinus: (Laughs) I hardly think the Foundation would have much appreciation for fairytales. And you? You haven\u2019t been talkative, either. SCP-8945-3 does not respond Dr. Martinus: Lady Roro? SCP-8945-3: The stories did not mention it, did it? Dr. Martinus: Mention what? SCP-8945-3: The fires. His rage. How the land was burnt, and all because I\u2026 Dr. Martinus: Lady Roro? SCP-8945-3: I rejected him. My father\u2019s blood was still fresh on his blade when he reached for me, pledged himself to me, and demanded that I do the same. Dr. Martinus: You were afraid. SCP-8945-3: I feared his blade then, as I fear your hammers and chisel now. So I gave him an impossible task, and at the verge of his success\u2026 I could not bear to see it. I commanded the roosters to crow, my servants raised scarves in the air and set paddies ablaze. His legions feared the light and fled the false dawn. But I could not have foreseen his next actions. The thousandth temple was unfinished, and in his anger he blasphemed and cast me into stone. Dr. Martinus: And\u2026 the fires you speak of? SCP-8945-3: His regret, his anger\u2026 he dropped to his knees and begged forgiveness, which I never gave. The land trembled and shook, and when it was over, the kingdom he\u2019d fought to gain had been buried in ash. My people suffered, because I did not yield. Dr. Martinus: I\u2019m sorry. SCP-8945-3: For what? It is a burden I carry now and always. You\u2019ve lost your men, too, because I remained silent. I remained silent when the people suffered, when the jungle reclaimed my home, when villages were burnt and torn down, all to keep his will from taking hold. And yet I do not wish to yield. Perhaps this punishment is just. <End Log> Afterword: Dr. Martinus reprimanded for improper conduct. Containment procedures based on SCP-8945-3\u2019s testimony tested and implemented. Efficacy in containing SCP-8945-1 increased. \u2013 Dr. Janssen.",
