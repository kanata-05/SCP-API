All four siblings were born to Droman Avakian and Anita Martel of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Prior to Incident 2610 UIU Tango-Tango, SCP-2610-A was a well known medical doctor and self-proclaimed \"telepath\", SCP-2610-B was a deckhand employed at the Boston Harbor, and SCP-2610-C and -D were unemployed.\n\n\nThrough the use of currently poorly understood medical techniques developed by SCP-2610-A, the siblings conspired and succeeded in altering their genetic makeup in a way that anomalously affected their incestuously conceived offspring. These offspring (and the offspring of those offspring) were classified as SCP-2610-E collectively, and together with their parents (self-described as \"The Firstborn\") were classified as \"The Colony\" by the initial United States Federal Bureau of Investigation \nUnusual Incidents Unit (UIU)\n investigators who discovered and led to the neutralization of SCP-2610.\n\n\nSCP-2610-E instances were anomalously bred to have a significantly shorter than natural gestation period, and a rapid rate of growth. As a result of these changes, and the limited diversity of genetic material between SCP-2610-E instances due to severe inbreeding, SCP-2610-E instances were genetically human but carried a high number of physical malformations and abnormalities, along with sharply stunted mental faculties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDroman Avakian, Anita Martel, and SCP-2610-A, -C, and -D. The other woman is unidentified. On the back of the image was written \"Whore of His Deliverance\" in black ink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entirety of SCP-2610 is believed to have been neutralized by United States Navy fighters at the order of the UIU on November 16th, 1971. More information regarding this incident can be found in \nAddendum 2610.8: Incident UIU Tango-Tango\n.\n\n\nDue to lack of direct involvement in the case of SCP-2610, all information regarding SCP-2610 has been collected through cooperation between Foundation personnel and UIU agents. Please see the addenda below for official UIU reports pertaining to SCP-2610.\n\n\nAddendum 2610-1:\n Background and Discovery\n\n\nSCP-2610-A, -B, -C, and -D were all born near Boston, Massachusetts. Their father, Droman Avakian, was a laborer in the area. Much of their extended family lived either in Iran (paternal) or France (maternal). Little information about the family is available prior to the birth of SCP-2610-A, though immigration forms do confirm that a \"D. Avakian\" traveled to New York from Morocco in 1911.\n\n\nSCP-2610-A was born on January 16th, 1922 at the West Boston Military Medical Center (now defunct). From a young age, SCP-2610-A expressed a variety of anomalous traits, specifically a self-described \"telepathy\". SCP-2610-A wrote extensively about this in several journals recovered after Incident UIU Tango Tango. Below is an excerpt from one of those journals:\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026it is not so much that I feel the feelings of those around me, like the common empath, but more that I can see the images and hear the impulses of every person, man and wo-man, who I can reach out to with my mind. The cacophony that was once the nightmare of my youth has, in experience, turned into a most curious and invaluable tool\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\nYears later, SCP-2610-A described an event that is referenced several times elsewhere in the text, and was seen as being of great importance to the subject:\n\n\n\n\n\u2026and it was then that I reached out with my own mind to the person on the table and, sensing the emptiness in theirs, put myself within it. Like a shade had been pulled from over my face, suddenly I could see with other eyes, hear with other ears, indeed, I saw and heard myself staring down at myself, mouth agape with wonder.\n\n\nBut the lobotomy is not so simple or without risk that it could be administered to the number that my thoughts imagine without notice. As to what would happen were I to find myself together with another conscious, should the patient recover, I cannot say. Better it would be, I think, should the subject be birthed with no consciousness at all; a completely virgin mind\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2610-B on left. Image date unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf SCP-2610-B, little is noted in any records aside from a birth record (also from the West Boston Military Medical Center) and an employment file with the Kervier Shipping Company in 1945 (which included a fingerprint and vehicle registration). Of note, SCP-2610-B is mentioned only once in SCP-2610-A's journals, where it is referenced that SCP-2610-B sexually assaulted an unnamed immigrant woman near the shipyards, which necessitated the lobotomy performed by SCP-2610-A in the previous passage as a cover.\n\n\nSCP-2610-C and -D are not mentioned in any birth records or citizenship records. Aside from references in SCP-2610-A's journals (including a handful of photographs) and UIU records indicating their involvement, there is no outside evidence of their existence whatsoever.\n\n\nIn March of 1959, SCP-2610-A was arrested on charges of illegal medical practices on minors. Though SCP-2610-A was able to settle with the victims for an undisclosed amount, SCP-2610-A withdrew from the medical field. No further mention of SCP-2610-A or its siblings is noted until Incident UIU Tango-15.\n\n\nAddendum 2610.2:\n Incident UIU Tango-11\n\n\nThe following information was gathered from UIU incident logs.\n\n\n\n\nUIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-1\n\nAgent Designation: Cyprus\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice report filed November 12th, 1965:\n\n\nBREAK-IN AT \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 W 15th ST. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\n\n\nFOUR INDIVIDUALS AT LARGE\n\nINDETERMINATE SEX\n\nTHREE PERSONS KILLED\n\nHEAVILY RESISTANT TO WEAPON FIRE\n\nCAPABLE OF MOVING AT HIGH SPEED\n\nINHUMANLY STRONG\n\nESCAPED WITH FOUR LARGE TRUCKS OF CATTLE FEED\n\nDESCRIBED AS \"GROTESQUE\"\n\nBE ADVISED HIGHLY DANGEROUS\n\n\n\n\nUnit investigators became involved after Bureau was contacted. Subjects were described as \"roughly six-feet tall\" and \"vaguely human\", with a number of obvious and grotesque physical malformations, such as missing or additional limbs, eyes, ears, etc., collapsed ribcages or extruded stomachs, large growths across the body. Did not succumb to weapon fire and moved quickly but jarringly on stilted or broken limbs. Did not attempt to communicate. Three people within the storehouse, identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, were found dead at the scene. All individuals showed signs of violent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, including \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and other severe trauma. Fingerprints gathered from the scene, but did not match any known suspects.\n\n\nInvestigation is ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 2610.3:\n Excerpt from Recovered Journal\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nThe following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU.\n\n\n\n\nLast night I was visited by an \nAngel\n.\n\n\nAs she slipped into my room I felt the warmth of her around me, and opened my eyes to take in her beauty. Her flesh rippled and tore, and light shined through the cracks like the sun. She reached out to me, held me in her many arms and slid herself inside of me. As she entered my body, I heard her whisper to me words sent from the LORD. My pen does not do justice to her voice, but I wrote it nonetheless;\n\n\n\"Soft and silent, Child of God,\n\nfor you have been chosen to lead His people\n\nand create for Him and New Eden.\n\nThrough your seed will his nation be built,\n\nand the seed of your brothers will fertilize its fields.\n\nHe has provided for you the Whore of His Deliverance,\n\nin your own blood she is born.\n\nHer womb will open for your seed and the seed of your offspring,\n\nand their seed upon their seed,\n\nuntil the Earth is made anew in His Image.\"\n\n\nThen she produced from within me a vial of liquid, both glorious and putrid, and told me how to use it to create the Seed of His New Eden. As she removed herself from within me I climaxed, and she said to me \"Truly this is the last of your seed that shall be spilled without purpose, for now it is given new purpose.\" Then she was gone, and I was filled with His voice. The voice that will guide my hand on this page and write the New Testament of Creation.\n\n\nEven now, I can feel his words inside me, washing away the sin that once cluttered my mind.\n\n\nMy whole life's work has been for this, it must be. The LORD gave me this sight so that I might lead His people to His New Eden. All of the struggle will finally be worth the suffering.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2610.4:\n Incident UIU Tango-15\n\n\n\n\nUIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-5\n\nAgent Designation: Ulysses\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nAnother theft of a large quantity of livestock feed. A shipment of cattle feed bound for S. Carolina was ransacked last night. Five dockhands are dead, same type of wounds as the ones at the storehouse. Officers responding to the scene did manage to disable one of the fleeing vehicles. The subjects within fled the scene, but the vehicle was recovered and identified as belonging to A. Avakian, a dockhand from Boston whose fingerprints were recognized as also being from the previous scene. Records on file show he has not been employed with the Kervier group for several months.\n\n\nDuring a chase with one of the vehicles, one of the human-like creatures described in the previous incident report leaped from within the trailer onto a pursuing squad car and assaulted the officers within. One officer was killed, the other (the driver) managed to crash the vehicle into a nearby embankment, totaling it. The officer managed to escape, while the creature (which was pinned below the vehicle) perished.\n\n\nAddendum 2610.5:\n Excerpt from Recovered Journal\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nThe following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU.\n\n\n\n\nThe seeding has begun in earnest. Our sister was hesitant, but she too was visited by the Angel of the LORD but a week past, and her eyes were opened and her womb was made ready for the Colony of New Eden. She now awaits us every night, prepared to receive the Seed.\n\n\nThe tears of my sin that the Angel drew from within me are miraculous. When served with holy wine to a male host, the seed of that host plants itself within the womb with such tenacity. Then, the offspring grows within the host with a great speed, while the mother is nourished only by the power of God and his agents here on Earth. And what virile children are born from this union! Ready themselves to give and receive the Seed, in their own station. The tears follow through the generations, and each gestation is as swift and fruitious as the last.\n\n\nMy sister, the Whore of His Deliverance, has already produced for me a son. I have named him Ezekial, and he will be the champion of our New World.\n\n\nEven now, I can hear my Brother delivering upon her as well. The Colony grows stronger every day. Soon the Daughters will be strong enough to take Seed of their own, and produce more Children.\n\n\nThe LORD has spoken to me, and has said \"be fruitful and multiply, for the Earth is mine through you.\" The LORD has prepared my sight to lead our Children, and I will prepare my mind for HIM when he arrives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2610.6:\n Incident UIU Tango-18\n\n\n\n\nUIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-8\n\nAgent Designation: Grenada\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1970\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1970, after a tip from agents embedded within local utilities companies, Unit Agents moved on the abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Packaging Corp. warehouse. Despite the structure being empty for more than thirty years, it had recently began to draw power from nearby lines. Additionally, an automobile registered to one H. Rutherford, which was confirmed as being sold to one Simeon Avakian five years prior, was seen at the site.\n\n\nAgents initially found the warehouse empty, but sounds from below led the group to an operational lift located in the northwest corner of the main level. The agents descended to a third basement level via the lift, and then to another basement level by stairs, before encountering [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED].\n\n\nOf the thirteen agents who entered the warehouse, only four escaped to a local FBI stronghouse. The details of the incident are described below.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n Alright, we're recording now. Try it again, speak here\u2014\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n Fuck the fucking recorder, Marc. Are you calling Central?\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n They're getting them on the line right now, Cooper. We've gotta record this though, so help me here.\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n I already told you, I\u2014 \n(aside)\n are they on the fucking phone?\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n Cooper!\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n Fine. We got down to the second, third? -whatever, one of the basements at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 place. You could smell it before you heard it, and hear it from a floor or two up. We come around the corner and there are\u2026 I don't know, Marc, two hundred? Four? More than I could count quickly.\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n What were they?\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n They weren't fucking people. They\u2014 I don't know, they looked like people, but\u2026 more like just flesh. Everywhere, just flesh. It was some kind of orgy, they were all fucking each other, and there were eyes and arms and hair and teeth everywhere, places where it shouldn't fucking be, and\u2014\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n Calm down, Cooper, ca\u2014\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n Calm down? They fucking \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Riley and pulled Yates into a dozen pieces, his arms and\u2026 fuck, man. I don't know how I got out of there. Oh god, Nate was screaming the whole time, and they just tore into him and\u2014\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n Did you see any humans in there?\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n Just one guy, but he was doing the same fucking thing.\n\n\nAgent Rico:\n Could you identify this man? \n(Produces image of SCP-2610-B)\n\n\nAgent Carter:\n That's the\u2014 Christ, Rico, that's the fuckin' guy.\n\n\nAgent Baxter:\n Alright, we just got word from Central. We're torching the place.\n\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of this interview, UIU forces proceeded to launch an attack on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 warehouse. While the structure was completely demolished, no remains were recovered from the debris. Signs of habitation\n2\n confirmed the presence of some kind of activity, but no additional information was recovered from the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2610.7:\n Excerpt from Recovered Journal\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nThe following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU.\n\n\n\n\nThe Colony grows.\n\n\nMy sister, the Whore, has given birth to so many of our holy children. Even now, she lays in ecstasy at the thought of serving the LORD. Her daughters have become the vessels for the Seed of her sons, and their daughters and their sons. The work continues.\n\n\nHowever, my youngest brother has resisted the call of our LORD, and even now attempts to conspire against us. I am so disappointed. I had hoped he would move on past his initial reluctance, as he seemed \nso eager to serve\n when he first delivered his Seed. He is the closest blood with the Whore of His Deliverance, and their bond should be the strongest, and yet now he speaks of morality and sin. What sin is there in the service of the LORD?\n\n\nIt is of no consequence. I was visited by the Angel again last night, and as she took me once more she spoke to me the desires of our GOD. For our Colony to spread across the world and bring GOD closer to us, the LORD desires the sacrifice of one of us \nFirstborn\n. The Angel spoke and forbade the desecration of myself the Godhead, my brother the Sower, and my sister the Whore. All that remains is the younger. His blood will fertilize the fields of our covenant. His meat shall satisfy the children.\n\n\nI will enter the mind of Ezekial tonight and take my brother one last time, in service to our LORD. Then I will feed him to our Children.\n\n\nThe Colony grows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2610.8:\n Incident UIU Tango-Tango\n\n\n\n\nUIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-TANGO\n\nAgent Designation: Killroy\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1971\n\n\n\n\nOn November 14th, 1971, Bureau agents received word that a cross-country locomotive carrying animal feed had been attacked and overwhelmed, and that the assailants had boarded the train and were en route to the west coast. Agents across the country were mobilized to stop the train's progress.\n\n\nEarly attempts on the east coast did little to slow the advance, as any organized group drawing within 100 yards of the locomotive were quickly overtaken by hordes of SCP-2610-E instances emerging from the cars. Attempts were made to halt the vehicle using explosives, but were similarly fruitless, as SCP-2610-E instances would quickly throw their bodies on top of any incendiary placed on the track.\n\n\nWhile additional attempts were being made to slow the first train, Central confirmed reports of two more trains, similarly bound for the west coast, both of which had also been hijacked. One of these trains was only reported after it had come to a stop to take on additional fuel near the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Pennsylvania. Reportedly, \"over one-thousand\" of the humanoid creatures descended on a local high school football game to [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED]. Casualties reached \u2588\u2588\u2588 within the hour.\n\n\nWhen it became clear that the situation was getting out of hand, UIU Central contacted agents at the SCP Foundation in an attempt to reinforce the already hamstrung UIU forces. Local military units were likewise activated and dispatched towards the paths of the oncoming Colony trains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath of Foundation involvement in UIU Tango-Tango\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation personnel moved quickly to the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Kentucky, where a fourth train would be passing through. Utilizing technology gathered from [REDACTED] disabling the entities ability to communicate with Simeon Avakian. The ensuing panic resulted in the entities losing control of the locomotive and crashing near a train yard. Unable to fight back or defend themselves, the entities were dispatched by Foundation incendiary teams.\n\n\nOver the next day, UIU and SCP teams continued to try and halt the advance of the remaining locomotives with minimum civilian casualties, all with little success. On November 16th, all remaining trains (six in total) reached the naval port at Long Beach, CA, and quickly overwhelmed the assembled UIU and Foundation personnel waiting there. The entities\n3\n then boarded three waiting oil tanker ships. Against an oncoming storm, the three vessels turned west and set sail.\n\n\nThe vessels were pursued by US Coast Guard ships until the storm was deemed too dangerous to pursue in. As part of a last-ditch effort to stop the advance of the Colony westward, UIU Central requested US Navy F-14 jets to be scrambled and eliminate the ships. At 2028 hours PST, USN pilots confirmed hits on all three vessels.\n\n\nAftermath and Final Report:\n In the aftermath of Incident Tango-Tango, the bodies of no fewer than 1200 humanoid entities were pulled from the sea and incinerated.

        "Addendum 2610-1: Background and Discovery\nSCP-2610-A, -B, -C, and -D were all born near Boston, Massachusetts. Their father, Droman Avakian, was a laborer in the area. Much of their extended family lived either in Iran (paternal) or France (maternal). Little information about the family is available prior to the birth of SCP-2610-A, though immigration forms do confirm that a \"D. Avakian\" traveled to New York from Morocco in 1911.\nSCP-2610-A was born on January 16th, 1922 at the West Boston Military Medical Center (now defunct). From a young age, SCP-2610-A expressed a variety of anomalous traits, specifically a self-described \"telepathy\". SCP-2610-A wrote extensively about this in several journals recovered after Incident UIU Tango Tango. Below is an excerpt from one of those journals:\nYears later, SCP-2610-A described an event that is referenced several times elsewhere in the text, and was seen as being of great importance to the subject:\nOf SCP-2610-B, little is noted in any records aside from a birth record (also from the West Boston Military Medical Center) and an employment file with the Kervier Shipping Company in 1945 (which included a fingerprint and vehicle registration). Of note, SCP-2610-B is mentioned only once in SCP-2610-A's journals, where it is referenced that SCP-2610-B sexually assaulted an unnamed immigrant woman near the shipyards, which necessitated the lobotomy performed by SCP-2610-A in the previous passage as a cover.\nSCP-2610-C and -D are not mentioned in any birth records or citizenship records. Aside from references in SCP-2610-A's journals (including a handful of photographs) and UIU records indicating their involvement, there is no outside evidence of their existence whatsoever.\nIn March of 1959, SCP-2610-A was arrested on charges of illegal medical practices on minors. Though SCP-2610-A was able to settle with the victims for an undisclosed amount, SCP-2610-A withdrew from the medical field. No further mention of SCP-2610-A or its siblings is noted until Incident UIU Tango-15.",
        "Addendum 2610.2: Incident UIU Tango-11\nThe following information was gathered from UIU incident logs.\nUnit investigators became involved after Bureau was contacted. Subjects were described as \"roughly six-feet tall\" and \"vaguely human\", with a number of obvious and grotesque physical malformations, such as missing or additional limbs, eyes, ears, etc., collapsed ribcages or extruded stomachs, large growths across the body. Did not succumb to weapon fire and moved quickly but jarringly on stilted or broken limbs. Did not attempt to communicate. Three people within the storehouse, identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, were found dead at the scene. All individuals showed signs of violent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, including \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and other severe trauma.

        "Addendum 2610.4: Incident UIU Tango-15\nAnother theft of a large quantity of livestock feed. A shipment of cattle feed bound for S. Carolina was ransacked last night. Five dockhands are dead, same type of wounds as the ones at the storehouse. Officers responding to the scene did manage to disable one of the fleeing vehicles. The subjects within fled the scene, but the vehicle was recovered and identified as belonging to A. Avakian, a dockhand from Boston whose fingerprints were recognized as also being from the previous scene. Records on file show he has not been employed with the Kervier group for several months.\nDuring a chase with one of the vehicles, one of the human-like creatures described in the previous incident report leaped from within the trailer onto a pursuing squad car and assaulted the officers within. One officer was killed, the other (the driver) managed to crash the vehicle into a nearby embankment, totaling it. The officer managed to escape, while the creature (which was pinned below the vehicle) perished.",

        "Addendum 2610.6: Incident UIU Tango-18\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1970, after a tip from agents embedded within local utilities companies, Unit Agents moved on the abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Packaging Corp. warehouse. Despite the structure being empty for more than thirty years, it had recently began to draw power from nearby lines. Additionally, an automobile registered to one H. Rutherford, which was confirmed as being sold to one Simeon Avakian five years prior, was seen at the site.\nAgents initially found the warehouse empty, but sounds from below led the group to an operational lift located in the northwest corner of the main level. The agents descended to a third basement level via the lift, and then to another basement level by stairs, before encountering [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED].\nOf the thirteen agents who entered the warehouse, only four escaped to a local FBI stronghouse. The details of the incident are described below.",
        "Addendum 2610.7: Excerpt from Recovered Journal",
        "Addendum 2610.8: Incident UIU Tango-Tango\nOn November 14th, 1971, Bureau agents received word that a cross-country locomotive carrying animal feed had been attacked and overwhelmed, and that the assailants had boarded the train and were en route to the west coast. Agents across the country were mobilized to stop the train's progress.\nEarly attempts on the east coast did little to slow the advance, as any organized group drawing within 100 yards of the locomotive were quickly overtaken by hordes of SCP-2610-E instances emerging from the cars. Attempts were made to halt the vehicle using explosives, but were similarly fruitless, as SCP-2610-E instances would quickly throw their bodies on top of any incendiary placed on the track.\nWhile additional attempts were being made to slow the first train, Central confirmed reports of two more trains, similarly bound for the west coast, both of which had also been hijacked. One of these trains was only reported after it had come to a stop to take on additional fuel near the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Pennsylvania. Reportedly, \"over one-thousand\" of the humanoid creatures descended on a local high school football game to [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED]. Casualties reached \u2588\u2588\u2588 within the hour.\nWhen it became clear that the situation was getting out of hand, UIU Central contacted agents at the SCP Foundation in an attempt to reinforce the already hamstrung UIU forces. Local military units were likewise activated and dispatched towards the paths of the oncoming Colony trains.\nFoundation personnel moved quickly to the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Kentucky, where a fourth train would be passing through. Utilizing technology gathered from [REDACTED] disabling the entities ability to communicate with Simeon Avakian. The ensuing panic resulted in the entities losing control of the locomotive and crashing near a train yard. Unable to fight back or defend themselves, the entities were dispatched by Foundation incendiary teams.\nOver the next day, UIU and SCP teams continued to try and halt the advance of the remaining locomotives with minimum civilian casualties, all with little success. On November 16th, all remaining trains (six in total) reached the naval port at Long Beach, CA, and quickly overwhelmed the assembled UIU and Foundation personnel waiting there. The entities 3 then boarded three waiting oil tanker ships. Against an oncoming storm, the three vessels turned west and set sail.\nThe vessels were pursued by US Coast Guard ships until the storm was deemed too dangerous to pursue in. As part of a last-ditch effort to stop the advance of the Colony westward, UIU Central requested US Navy F-14 jets to be scrambled and eliminate the ships. At 2028 hours PST, USN pilots confirmed hits on all three vessels.",

        "Last night I was visited by an Angel . As she slipped into my room I felt the warmth of her around me, and opened my eyes to take in her beauty. Her flesh rippled and tore, and light shined through the cracks like the sun. She reached out to me, held me in her many arms and slid herself inside of me. As she entered my body, I heard her whisper to me words sent from the LORD. My pen does not do justice to her voice, but I wrote it nonetheless; \"Soft and silent, Child of God, for you have been chosen to lead His people and create for Him and New Eden. Through your seed will his nation be built, and the seed of your brothers will fertilize its fields. He has provided for you the Whore of His Deliverance, in your own blood she is born. Her womb will open for your seed and the seed of your offspring, and their seed upon their seed, until the Earth is made anew in His Image.\" Then she produced from within me a vial of liquid, both glorious and putrid, and told me how to use it to create the Seed of His New Eden. As she removed herself from within me I climaxed, and she said to me \"Truly this is the last of your seed that shall be spilled without purpose, for now it is given new purpose.\" Then she was gone, and I was filled with His voice. The voice that will guide my hand on this page and write the New Testament of Creation. Even now, I can feel his words inside me, washing away the sin that once cluttered my mind. My whole life's work has been for this, it must be. The LORD gave me this sight so that I might lead His people to His New Eden. All of the struggle will finally be worth the suffering.\"",

Our sister was hesitant, but she too was visited by the Angel of the LORD but a week past, and her eyes were opened and her womb was made ready for the Colony of New Eden. She now awaits us every night, prepared to receive the Seed. The tears of my sin that the Angel drew from within me are miraculous. When served with holy wine to a male host, the seed of that host plants itself within the womb with such tenacity. Then, the offspring grows within the host with a great speed, while the mother is nourished only by the power of God and his agents here on Earth. And what virile children are born from this union! Ready themselves to give and receive the Seed, in their own station. The tears follow through the generations, and each gestation is as swift and fruitious as the last. My sister, the Whore of His Deliverance, has already produced for me a son. I have named him Ezekial, and he will be the champion of our New World. Even now, I can hear my Brother delivering upon her as well. The Colony grows stronger every day. Soon the Daughters will be strong enough to take Seed of their own, and produce more Children. The LORD has spoken to me, and has said \"be fruitful and multiply, for the Earth is mine through you.\" The LORD has prepared my sight to lead our Children, and I will prepare my mind for HIM when he arrives.",

Her daughters have become the vessels for the Seed of her sons, and their daughters and their sons. The work continues. However, my youngest brother has resisted the call of our LORD, and even now attempts to conspire against us. I am so disappointed. I had hoped he would move on past his initial reluctance, as he seemed so eager to serve when he first delivered his Seed. He is the closest blood with the Whore of His Deliverance, and their bond should be the strongest, and yet now he speaks of morality and sin. What sin is there in the service of the LORD? It is of no consequence. I was visited by the Angel again last night, and as she took me once more she spoke to me the desires of our GOD. For our Colony to spread across the world and bring GOD closer to us, the LORD desires the sacrifice of one of us Firstborn . The Angel spoke and forbade the desecration of myself the Godhead, my brother the Sower, and my sister the Whore. All that remains is the younger. His blood will fertilize the fields of our covenant.
