Upon arrival, SCP-8012 began repeatedly requesting the presence of \"the chosen one\", insisting that it wouldn't leave the kitchen until they were found.\n\n\nNotably, SCP-8012 has provided no elaboration on whom the \"chosen one\" is or what will occur once they are found.

A number of voices can be heard from people attempting to enter the door from the other side.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n I'm not sure you understand, Sire. You are the chosen one! That's why it's imperative that you go through the Portal of Whimsy and Wonder!\n\n\nSCP-8012 is ineffectually jumping against Pablo's shins. Pablo is entirely unfazed, as he is significantly heavier than SCP-8012.\n\n\nPablo turns and crouches down.\n\n\nPablo:\n Hey little man. Your funky portal seems fun and all, but I really need this job and whatever that portal is seems like a great way to lose it.\n\n\nSCP-8012 stops hopping.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n But Sire, you do have an opportunity! For whimsy! For wonder!\n\n\nPablo:\n I really don't need any more \"whimsy\" and \"wonder\" in my life, little man, I'm sure you can understand that.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n What if I told you there were vast treasures behind the portal, Sire? Untold treasures beyond your imagination?\n\n\nPablo:\n Buddy\u2026 I don't need untold riches; I need told riches.

Pablo Smith then entered this rift,\n2\n causing a Site-wide total loss of power lasting 10 minutes.\n\n\nThe following footage of the 23rd floor bathroom was recovered, starting immediately from the point at which power returned to the facility.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nPablo falls from the ceiling and lands loudly in the third stall.

A small cut on his head has begun to bleed.\n\n\nPablo:\n Hello? Dr. Clemmens?\n\n\nHe looks around. The room is empty, but in a state of disarray.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n How mysterious, Sire!\n\n\nPablo walks around, picking up assorted papers from and pencils from the ground, and notices that the computer is running.\n\n\nPablo:\n Huh\u2026\n\n\nHe walks over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Clemmens's Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo stares at the computer.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Sire?\n\n\nPablo:\n Yeah, uh\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Wigglebert, Sire.\n\n\nPablo:\n Sure\u2026 bud\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8012 appears sad, despite there being no change in its facial expression.\n\n\nPablo:\n What- is this?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Oh- The Lord's scrying machine, Sire!\n\n\nPablo looks at the desktop for a few more moments.\n\n\nPablo:\n Yeah\u2026\n\n\nHe grabs the mouse and tries to click on various \"applications\". Nothing happens. He then clicks on an application called \"Security_Footage.Important\".\n\n\nPablo:\n This does nothing, bud.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Just a moment, Sire!\n\n\nA nearby printer activates and beings printing. Instead of the sounds typically emitted from a printer, the sounds of a flute can be heard.\n\n\nPablo notices the noise and walks slowly to the printer.\n\n\nPablo:\n Ok?\n\n\nHe picks up the one on top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Printout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Gods, sire!

A dragon has kidnapped all your friends, and now you have to save them!\n\n\nPablo looks down once more at the \"security footage\", then turns a blank expression towards SCP-8012.\n\n\nThey stand in silence for approximately 30 seconds.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Isn't it exciting, Sire?

How do you say I do that, then?\n\n\nSCP-8012 gasps. A tiny lute manifests within its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n I have just the perfect way to tell you!\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Ahem\u2026\n\n\nIt begins to strum the lute.

Let's get this over with.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the events of the previous log, Pablo equipped a body camera and left the Site-327 building. 10 minutes later, he was spotted entering a nearby retail store.\n\n\nThe following log was compiled with a combination of the store's internal security cameras and Pablo's body-camera audio and footage.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nThe pair walks into a retail store. Pablo is rolling a shopping cart with SCP-8012 sitting in the child's seat.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n I see, Sire, there is a great abundance of artifacts in this \"Super Store\".\n\n\nPablo:\n Mhm.\n\n\nHe rolls into the cookware aisle.\n\n\nPablo:\n Tons of\u2026 \"equipment\" here to look at. Right?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n A most abundant supply, Sire!\n\n\nThey peruse for a few minutes in silence. Pablo puts various medical and camping supplies into the cart. As they enter a new aisle, SCP-8012 suddenly hops out.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Gods, Sire! Look at that!\n\n\nPablo looks over at the wall of office supplies.\n\n\nPablo:\n What is it, bud?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ancient Blades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8012 hops onto a pile of safety scissors.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Ancient blades!

I think we've got all the \"equipment\" we need.\n\n\nHe rolls the cart to a manned cash register and nods at the cashier.\n\n\nCashier:\n Did you find everything all right?\n\n\nPablo:\n Yep- I think this is everything.\n\n\nCashier:\n Great!\n\n\nThe cashier gets to work scanning each of the items and loading them back into the cart.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep\u2026\n\n\nA minute of \"Beep\"s pass before Pablo pays.\n\n\nCashier:\n We hope you come back soon!\n\n\nThe cashier hands him a coupon. He looks down at it.\n\n\nCashier:\n Have a good day!\n\n\nPablo:\n You too.\n\n\nHe wheels the cart away. As they near the doors, SCP-8012 hops onto Pablo's arm.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n What is that little card, Sire?\n\n\nPablo looks back at the coupon, still in his hand.\n\n\nPablo:\n Oh, nothing much. Just a coupon for\u2026\n\n\nHe squints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Coupon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo:\n It says I can get a \"Helmet of Helmeting\" if I retrieve\u2026 \"three wild ducks\"?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n I see, Sire. A Side-Quest!\n\n\nPablo:\n I'm not really sure what an \"Helmet of Helmeting\" is meant to be\u2026 but\u2026 It sounds magical? Useful?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n It could indeed be, Sire, but I'm not sure getting distracted-\n\n\nPablo:\n And you haven't really given me any proper leads on what to do. Right?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Well yes, Sire, but that would ruin the fun of the adventure, so-\n\n\nPablo:\n Well I think that's that then. Time for some Side-Quests!\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n If you say so Sire\u2026\n\n\nThey exit the store.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the retail store, Pablo went to a nearby public park and utilized a net he purchased to capture three wild ducks. After returning to the store, he retrieved the \"Helmet of Helmeting\" from the cashier along with an additional coupon, allowing him to exchange an empty packet of chips for \"Gauntlets of Crispness\". He fulfilled this in addition to receiving each of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuest\n\n\nReward\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve cheaper gasoline from across state borders.\n\n\nThe Chestplate of Cheapskates\n\n\nComplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteal 10 random people's mail.\n\n\nThe Leggings of The Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area\n\n\nComplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefeat a fly in mortal combat and retrieve its corpse.\n\n\nThe Boots That Are Really Cool\n\n\nComplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Orb\n\n\nComplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather 500 leaves, each from different trees.\n\n\nThe Giant Blade of George Bigman\n\n\nComplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollect every Funko Pop.\n\n\nThe Staff of Unbelievable Magical Power\n\n\nIncomplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the retail parking lot, shortly after receiving the previous coupon, the following log was captured.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nPablo stands in the center of a parking lot covered head to toe in shining armor and wielding a massive silver blade.

Wait- wait.\n\n\nSCP-8012 turns its head to the side slightly.\n\n\nPablo:\n I think I'm just about ready to face the dragon actually.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n You are, Sire?\n\n\nSCP-8012 turns to the shopping cart and back to Pablo.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n You don't seem nearly well enough equipped to be facing a dragon.\n\n\nPablo:\n Wh- You see what I have, right?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Of course, Sire.\n\n\nPablo:\n The magic swords?

What sort of compromise?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Well\u2026 I think I'd be willing to give you the location of \nthe fetid cavern\n if you took at least \none\n artifact with you. At the very least.\n\n\nPablo:\n Artifact?\n\n\nSCP-8012 turns to the retail store.\n\n\nPablo:\n Oh! Yeah those\u2026 safety scissors, right?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Ancient blades, Sire.\n\n\nPablo:\n Yeah, yeah. I can do that. Easy.\n\n\nSCP-8012 lets out a sigh.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Gods, oh gods, thank you, Sire.

The following log was compiled by combining body camera footage with internal and external security camera footage from the destination building.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nThe pair can be seen walking down a road in a suburban neighborhood. Pablo remains full clad in his armor and brandishing his blade.\n\n\nPablo:\n It should be right\u2026 about\u2026 here.\n\n\nPablo leans over, catching his breath and looking around.

Decisions were certainly made while building it, but I wouldn't call it \"Fetid\" exactly.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n It seems the eye of a hero is much kinder than that of a wizard, Sire.\n\n\nPablo:\n Yeah, sure. Let's get to it then.\n\n\nHe walks up to the front door and knocks the door.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n A bold approach, Sire.\n\n\nThey wait a few moments.\n\n\nPablo rings the doorbell, then moves to peek through a window.\n\n\nPablo:\n Don't think anyone's home\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Well yes sire, the Dragon will certainly be buried deep in the depths of this horrible place, guarding its ill gotten gains in a meandering stupor.\n\n\nPablo tries the door, confirming that it's locked.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Alas, Sire.

I- I've\u2026 I've got this.\n\n\nPablo centers himself in front of the door and raises his left arm to the handle. It squeaks as he grabs it and begins to turn.\n\n\nCLACK\n\n\nA sharp noise resonates as the latch opens. Pablo pulls.\n\n\nCrrreeeeak\u2026\n\n\nPablo:\n Ok-\n\n\nAs soon as the door opens he charges in, finding the center of the room and entering a guarded stance.\n\n\nHe looks around.\n\n\nPablo:\n Where is the\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n G-g-g-gods, S-s-sire! Right there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dragon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo lowers his sword and drops his guard, shuffling over to the Dragon.\n\n\nPablo:\n It's just a-\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU TO SLAY THE DRAGON, SIRE! TAKE UP YOUR ARMS AND SLAY IT, WITH HASTE! QUICKLY!\n\n\nPablo:\n Bud- Bud. Calm down-\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n IT IS THE GOAL OF YOUR QUEST, SIRE! YOU MUST DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE! PLEASE!\n\n\nPablo reaches out his hand to pet the dragon. It attempts to bite him, but just ends up gnawing on the his gauntlet finger.\n\n\nPablo:\n You're just a little grumpy fella aren't you- aw, aren't you!\n\n\nThe Dragon hisses and goes for another bite.\n\n\nPablo:\n Probably just hungry\u2026\n\n\nPablo looks around.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n What in the world are you doing, Sire?\n\n\nPablo:\n Just one sec, bud\u2026 Ah-\n\n\nHe spots a potted plant sitting on the windowsill and walks over. A number of bright red strawberries can be seen in-between the lush leaves.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Sire?\n\n\nPablo pulls on one of the berries.\n\n\nPablo:\n Just gonna\u2026\n\n\nThe vine goes taut as he pulls, but doesn't break. Pablo pauses for a moment, then pulls again, but neither the pot, dirt, nor plant shift or snap.\n\n\nPablo:\n What in the- maybe- uh\u2026\n\n\nPablo attempts to take his blade to the stem, but finds it is much too large to fit in the windowsill properly. He tries various angles of approach before lowering his blade with a huff.\n\n\nPablo:\n Ha- hahaha\u2026 Great.\n\n\nHe drops the sword. It lands with an echoing clatter.\n\n\nThey stand in silence for a few seconds.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Um\u2026 No-no\u2026 Never\u2026\n\n\nPablo:\n What is it, Bud?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n No- nothing, Sire. Carry on\u2026 You know better\u2026\n\n\nPablo sighs.\n\n\nPablo:\n Wigglebert. What is it?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Oh! Sire! It's- It's just\u2026\n\n\nIt hops out from its nook in the armor.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n What if you tried the Ancient Blades?\n\n\nPablo pauses, contemplating.\n\n\nPablo:\n How wou-\n\n\nPablo sighs.\n\n\nPablo:\n Y'know what. Sure. Let's give your idea a shot Wigglebert.\n\n\nSCP-8012 appears incredibly proud, despite there being no change in its facial expression.\n\n\nPablo reaches his hand into a pouch by his side, procuring the Ancient Blades.\n\n\nPablo:\n Here goes nothing\u2026\n\n\nHe raises the Ancient Blades, daintily leaning over and positioning them around one of the berries' stems.\n\n\nSnip\n\n\nIt cuts cleanly, dropping the berry into Pablo's waiting other hand. He brings the strawberry up to his face and smiles.\n\n\nPablo:\n Wonderful.\n\n\nHe turns and walks carefully over to the dragon, brandishing the luscious fruit.\n\n\nAs he approaches, the dragon opens its mouth.\n\n\nSnap\n\n\nGulp\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Sire, it accepted it!\n\n\nThe dragon stomps in a tight circle then tips onto its back, tapping its belly with its feet for a few seconds before falling immediately asleep.\n\n\nPablo:\n Aww\u2026\n\n\nHe pats it on its belly.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n The beast does seem much more manageable while asleep\u2026\n\n\nPablo:\n So\u2026 Quest complete?\n\n\nSCP-8012 pauses, and looks between Pablo and the Dragon a few times.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n I don't actually- Ah! Over there.\n\n\nSCP-8012 turns off to the side. Pablo follows the direction it points and finds a precarious object covered by a sheet.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n How mysterious, Sire!\n\n\nHe pulls off the sheet, revealing a bird cage.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Gods, the Soul Prison! But where are your friends?\n\n\nPablo:\n Wait. There's something inside\u2026\n\n\nPablo opens the cage and reaches in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincess Paycheck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo:\n What's this?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Oooooohh\u2026 Of course, Sire! No quest is complete without rescuing a Princess! Congratulations!\n\n\nApplause can be heard.\n\n\nPablo:\n Huh?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n You completed your quest!\n\n\nPablo:\n Oh, I-\n\n\nThe lights suddenly shut off.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nImmediately after the conclusion of the prior log, all houses within a 1-mile radius of \"The Fetid Cavern\" experienced total loss of power lasting 10 minutes. Following this, all of Site-327 staff manifested randomly in safe locations within the radius.\n\n\nNotably, Site-327 Director Doug Clemmens, owner of the estate dubbed \"The Fetid Cavern\", manifested within the property. The log was captured shortly after the power outage ceased.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nPablo stands in front of the bird cage, still in full armor, and holding the Princess Paycheck and SCP-8012 in his hands. Director Clemmens can be seen sitting, somewhat blank-faced, in a chair off to the side.\n\n\nClemmens:\n So what you're saying is\u2026\n\n\nClemmens puts his hand to his forehead.\n\n\nClemmens:\n You went on a fantasy adventure from the Site building, across the city, and into the suburbs where you aimed to slay a dragon but instead completed by feeding my little Lizzy a strawberry?\n\n\nPablo:\n Yes, sir.\n\n\nClemmens:\n And 8012-\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Wigglebert. Wigglebert the Bard, sir.\n\n\nClemmens:\n Yes\u2026 And 8012, you are now satisfied with staying in our care with no issues?\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n As long as I can continue to tell the epic of Sir Pablo Smith, sir, yes.\n\n\nClemmens looks looks left and right while making various outward motions with his hands.\n\n\nClemmens:\n Well, great! Congratulations!\n\n\nPablo:\n Huh?\n\n\nClemmens:\n Welcome to the Foundation, son.\n\n\nPablo fails to find words.\n\n\nClemmens:\n Now get out of my house.\n\n\nPablo:\n Oh, yes, of course. Sorry sir. Thank you, sir. Sorry sir.\n\n\nPablo begins to walk out of the room.\n\n\nClemmens:\n Leave the frog.\n\n\nPablo:\n Oh- yes. Go on, Wigglebert.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Of course, Sire. How could I refuse the first audience member of the newly retired, Wigglebert, the Bard!\n\n\nClemmens looks over at Pablo with a forced smile and raised eyebrows.\n\n\nClemmens:\n We'll be in touch.\n\n\nPablo:\n Of course, sir. Thank you again, sir.\n\n\nPablo leaves the room.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n So shall we begin?\n\n\nSCP-8012 hops onto Clemmens's shoulder.\n\n\nSCP-8012:\n Ahe-\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nIn keeping with the resolutions made in the log above, Pablo Smith has been hired and assigned head researcher on SCP-8012.\n\n\nSCP-8012 has been reclassified as Euclid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n As a requirement for remaining within containment, to \"tell the story properly\", SCP-8012 has been allowed to add various images to this document.
