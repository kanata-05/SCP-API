Information in this document is not to be discerned as truth. A revised document has been made available to personnel with clearance. It is advised to those assigned to this SCP item to read this document in order to acquire a better understanding of its cognihazardous components.\n\n\n\n\nKnight #\n: SIR-2476 the Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIR-2476. Dressed in its original robes and armour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Chamber Requirements:\n SIR-2476 is kept in a humanoid containment tower at Site-17 castle. Questioning in interviews with SIR-2476 are to kept to a minimum, in order to prevent the activation of its primary enchantment. SIR-2476 is to be fed on a diet consisting of ham, canned pork and any type of jam as a condiment. SIR-2476 has been allowed to keep a potted shrubbery in its chamber of its own request.\n\n\nDescription:\n SIR-2476 is a human male in its early thirties, biologically identical to the late film actor Graham Arthur Chapman. SIR-2476 is prone to occasional episodes of hostility, where it will insult personnel in a French accent and insist they leave its presence, under the threat of further taunting. Apart from these episodes, SIR-2476 is generally cooperative with Foundation staff. The words \"Mr. Monty Python And The Holy Grail, by Gamers Against Weed\u201d are tattooed across SIR-2476\u2019s left thigh.\n\n\nSIR-2476 displays a number of enchantments relating to the 1975 film 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' by the British comedy group, Monty Python. SIR-2476 is only capable of verbal communication through the use of words used in the manuscript of the film. SIR-2476 is able to recite the script of the film in its entirety, including dialogue, descriptions, actions and both beginning and ending credits. SIR-2476 is unable to speak any words outside of the script, despite multiple attempts.\n\n\nWhen speaking for extended periods of time, SIR-2476 will begin dictating lines from the films script in-order, and proceed to recite the remainder in its entirety. SIR-2476 will begin reciting from a point in the script where the last word(s) it spoke was used. Anyone speaking with SIR-2476, or anyone else involved in the conversation at the time of the effects activation will join in with the recital. SIR-2476 and those affected will speak the dialogue of a varying set of characters through the entire recital. Subjects will take turns to speak the script's descriptions and actions. The beginning and ending credits will always be recited by SIR-2476. Those affected are unable to recall the events which took place while under SIR-2476\u2019s effects.\n\n\nInitial interview log\n\nThe following is a partial interview performed by Brother Belle shortly after the recovery of SIR-2476.\n\n\n\n\n+Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02476-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n Alright. Sir 2476, do tell me, what are your earliest memories? And what did you do to those peasants in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n I remember walking around and knocking into someone. I said sorry. They were nice to me. We started to talk about funny things.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n What did you discuss?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Monty Python. We both like it.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n How did you know about the film beforehand?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n I knew it when I appeared.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n Alright. How did you make them do what they did?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n It started after a little while. He brought up the spanking scene and I remembered it being fantastic. So we started saying it!\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n That was the trigger?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Yes, it was rather fun. Did I do something wrong?\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n No, no. You have nothing to worry about.\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Oh ok, thank you. I was afraid I\u2019d done something bad.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n Do you enjoy comedy films?\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Yes! I haven\u2019t seen them but I know they are good! Could I watch some?\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n We\u2019ll see. If you can help us out some more. I'm sure it can be arranged.\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Thank you! I get to watch it properly! With all the dancing and singing. (SIR-2476 pauses for a few seconds)\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n And cheery music would be required to make it seem homey. Luckily, that is just what we get. Knights. Singing.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n We\u2019re Knights of the Round Table. We dance whene\u2019er we\u2019re able.\n\n\nSIR-2476:\n Knights leap on table.\n\n\nBrother Belle:\n We do routines and chorus scenes with footwork-\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the interview was immediately terminated and SIR-2476 was returned to its holding chamber. Both SIR-2476 and Brother Belle continued to recite the script of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in its entirety, despite being held in separate locations. They got better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 2476-8745\n\n\nThe following document was recovered from the village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 upon locating SIR-2476. It is reproduced below in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\nJesus Christ!\n You've just found yourself your very own \nSir Monty Python And The Holy Grail\n by the Holy order of Knights Against Weed!

Sir Not Appearing In This Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #\n: SCP-2476\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2476 in its original outfit, prior to containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment procedures:\n All information regarding SCP-2476 may only be made available to Level 3 personnel who are currently studying SCP-2476. Personnel studying SCP-2476 are to first be directly shown SCP-2476's anomalous properties directly in-order to prevent the spread of its SCP-2476-1.\n\n\nSCP-2476 is kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-17. SCP-2476 has no special medical or dietary requirements.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2476 is a human male in its mid-twenties. SCP-2476 is prone to occasional episodes of extreme hostility, where it will demand personnel to conform to its desires, under the threat of extreme violence. Apart from these episodes, SCP-2476 is generally cooperative with Foundation staff. The words \"Mr. Spanish Inquisition, by Gamers Against Weed\u201d are tattooed across SCP-2476\u2019s left thigh.\n\n\nSCP-2476-1 is a cognitohazard affecting those who have not learned of SCP-2476's alias by reading its tattoo, or have not yet perceived its anomalous properties occur directly. Under these circumstances, information subjects learn will be falsified to fit the theme of the 1975 film \nMonty Python And The Holy Grail\n. Fabrications caused by SCP-2476-1 vary depending on the type of information learned and will persist with each subject. Subjects will continue to experience SCP-2476-1 as they learn more information regarding SCP-2476, and will only cease once they have perceived SCP-2476's actual anomalous properties in action.\n\n\nSCP-2476 suffers from extreme delusions regarding instruments and objects capabilities to inflict harm on others, believing items of a safe and benign nature to instead be the most effective. All instruments utilized by SCP-2476 which under regular circumstances would be effective in inflicting physical harm and injuries to others will become completely ineffective. SCP-2476 will utilize whatever instrument it uses in a highly ineffective manner, preventing the target from receiving any physical pain whatsoever. Notable delusions include perceiving a bat to be a baguette and a pair of knives to be a pair of sofa cushions.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-2476 was originally detained on the 11th of January 2017, when Foundation web crawlers located the use of the phrases \nGamers Against Weed\n and \nMr. Monty Python And The Holy Grail\n on numerous social networking accounts mentioning an unknown individual in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, North Carolina, United States who had caused several public disturbances. SCP-2476 was located in a nearby bookstore when retrieved, dressed in an outfit resembling that of the \nSpanish Inquisition\n costumes used in the Monty Python sketches of the same name, attempting to attack a cashier ineffectively with a desk lamp, for selling \u2018unorthodox\u2019 reading material. Foundation agents were able to detain it without incident. Amnestics were dispatched to all witnesses effectively.\n\n\nSCP-2476-1 became apparent after multiple Foundation personnel were informed of SCP-2476s recovery by agents. Temporary containment was prepared for SCP-2476 based upon falsified information given to Foundation personnel. Personnel were met with surprise upon SCP-2476's arrival due to its unexpected effects. All personnel involved were given amnestic treatment.\n\n\nInterview Log\n\nThe following is a partial interview performed by Dr. Belle several days after the recovery of SCP-2476.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02476-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Ello! We\u2019re gonna start another interview?\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Yes, if that\u2019s alright with you.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Good! Good! What did ya wanna talk about?\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n We were hoping to discuss the creation of your anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Really? Well\u2026. God. I honestly have no clue what to tell you (\nsniggers\n). I wouldn\u2019t really know what was going on in those guys heads at the time when they made me. They probablies just poured a whole bag of cocaine on a table and just started shoving their heads into it like: (\nSCP-2476 raises its head into the air and widens its eyes\n) \u201cAaaaaagghhhhh\u2019!\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n You seem quite energetic today.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Haha! (\nin a higher pitch\n) I know!\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n \u2026Can I have my outfit back?\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Sorry, but I told you before, that's not possible.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Oh, poooh!\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n But in all seriousness, what do you believe was the point of your creation? All other Misters so far have been made with at least some meaningful idea in mind. Not to say you yourself are somehow less\u2026 We are just finding it difficult to understand why you were made like this.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n I don\u2019t know really. I think it was less off \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make something meaningful to make people think. Yeah, we\u2019re edgy and deep!\u201d and more like \u201cGuys. We need to do this, it\u2019ll be fucking incredible.\u201d. Or maybe like a reverse thing? Like it\u2019s a clever idea presented in a really stupid way?\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n That would make sense\u2026 Speaking of, how do you feel during your, well, episodes?\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n It\u2019s really weird! It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t remember doing it. It\u2019s more like when you're really hyper, you know? When you\u2019re in that zone of crazy? it\u2019s like that but times one-hundred. I just go around acting all mental like \u2018Ha ha!\u2019\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n And how do you feel after the experience?\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n try not to really think about it. But honestly, sometimes I look back on it and am like \u201cOh God\u2026 What the hell were you doing!? You fool!\u201d. Those surveillance tapes you showed me were pretty funny though. The peoples' reactions alone were enough to cheer me up, so thanks for that.\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Glad it helped. Another question, how were you able to know about Gamers Against Weed? When we asked about your earliest memories, you said you'd woken up in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n I remember some things from what I guess you'd call 'before'. They're not really clear memories, more like information I woke up with. I think whatever process they used to create me involved making me but only partly, and then editing aspects of me\u2026 to see how I behaved or\u2026 something\u2026 Um\u2026\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Do you have a problem remembering? We can continue this at a later date.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Nah nah it's good. It\u2019s just a bit difficult to talk about certain parts.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Let\u2019s see\u2026 Agh! Fuck, this is complicated! The information I know was from what they mentioned when they were making me, kind of like how when you're a baby you take in things you hear people say. Except you know, I\u2019m a fully grown guy with an almost fully developed brain (\nlaughs\n) I do remember watching the Holy Grail like a thousand times though\u2026\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Well thank you, You've managed to give us a lot of helpful information.\n\n\nSCP-2476:\n Hehe, didn't expect it?\n\n\nDr. Belle:\n Okay, you need to settle down.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 2476-8745\n\n\nThe following document was found on SCP-2476's person when recovered.
