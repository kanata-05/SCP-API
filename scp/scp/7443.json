Clearance above Level-3 is required to access samples of SCP-7443. Technology developed with SCP-7443, upon being approved, is to be used primarily by MTF Alpha-1, as dictated by an O5-Council vote following Incident-7443-1.\n\n\nPublic information regarding Incident-7443-1 is to be monitored by Foundation webcrawlers and agents. Deliberate information is to be spread to manufacture artificial uncertainty regarding the validity of information spread pertaining to Incident-7443-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7443 is a metallic material with an unknown atomic composition that maintains perfect energy retention, which when touching the uncovered body of a subject, will result in a drastic rise in subject's stamina, strength, endurance, resistance, intelligence, and physical healing for an indefinite period of time.\n\n\nSCP-7443 has a tensile strength of 964\u00a0MPa, with a density of 10.24\u00a0g/cm\u00b3. SCP-7443's effects amplify when a high amount of kinetic energy is rapidly applied to the material. Excess kinetic energy exerted on SCP-7443 material will be rapidly expelled in the direction in which the force was applied. Approximately 154.891 kG of SCP-7443 is currently in Foundation possession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\nOn June 14th, 1995, MTF Iota-10, \"Damn Feds\", intercepted reports from the Los Angeles Police Department concerning an armed assault on an S&C-P\n1\n armored car, resulting in the expiration of one civilian and the serious injury of another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered Witness Log-7443\n\n\n\n\nCivilian Witness:\n Daniela Wreden\n\n\nInterrogator:\n Johnathan Joaquim\n\n\n\n\nJoaquim:\n Clearly state what you witnessed to the recording device.\n\n\nA small tap is heard as Joaquim sets the device in front of Wreden.\n\n\nWreden:\n God, it was all so fast. I was just pulling into the gas station to fill my car, and I heard gunshots behind me.\n\n\nJoaquim:\n Did you get a good glimpse of the assailants?\n\n\nWreden:\n No. No, I didn't. They were wearing armor and I was trying to run into the store. They moved like a blur whenever I looked at them.\n\n\nJoaquim:\n They were wearing armor and fast?\n\n\nWreden:\n Yeah, while one was aiming at us and telling us to get inside the other ripping apart the truck. Then when the other started firing they pretty quickly got in.\n\n\nJoaquim:\n And you can attest that the suspects in question shot both guards present?\n\n\nWreden:\n Yeah. One of the guards got behind him and shot into his helmet from a few feet away. I didn't even see them turn around to shoot him by the time he was on the ground. I tried to look away but-\n\n\nSilence is heard for 7 seconds.\n\n\nJoaquim:\n What about the second guard?\n\n\nWreden:\n I think they fired at him after. I don't know, a cashier dragged me into the store to get away. All I remember is whatever armor they were wearing being marked \"DGS\".\n\n\nJoaquim:\n All right. Thank you for your time. Medical personnel from the Survivor Comfort Program will administer some medicine soon to help alleviate the memories of what occurred.\n\n\nThe device is turned off.\n\n\n\n\nSeized security footage was altered to exclude potential anomalous visual information being leaked. Due to the number of civilian witnesses, a cover story was devised that the incident was a standard armed robbery.\n\n\n\n\nTwo further incidents were recorded including both PoI's involving the robbery of two separate S&C-P locations within Los Angeles. Both incidents were suspected to be committed by the same individuals by the identical armor worn, and the style of a robbery conducted within the span of a few minutes. Despite initial detainment efforts, both PoI's were able to escape Foundation efforts due to the speed in which their robberies occurred. Search efforts were relaxed in November 1995, and containment teams were relocated from the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident-7443-1\n\n\n\n\nOn Febuary 28th, 1996, a Foundation agent withdrawing personal finances from a S&C-P location in Northern Hollywood, California, United States, witnessed both PoI's entering said S&C-P location whilst wearing SCP-7443.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcription of a radio call sent to Area-09 by Agent Felix Kampstra.\n\n\n\n\nKampstra:\n Two PoI's have been spotted entering a S&C-P facility at the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Archwood Street! Believed to be 7443-A and -B! They are heavily armed and gunfire has been heard from within the location. Requesting the immediate deployment of any personnel in the area to aid in the containment of both PoI's and the securing of a perimeter close to the location.\n\n\nArea-09 Command:\n Nearby assets have been liquidated to assist in containment. Further forces are being placed on stand-by.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The majority of S&C-P employees are unaware of the existence of the Foundation and consist of civilians. As such, no armed personnel were present at the location at the time.\n\n\n\n\nPost the conclusion of Incident-7443-1, any and all security/media footage containing the incident was seized and analyzed prior to being altered and re-released to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Footage | 09:16\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-A grabs a civilian and throws them to the floor before shooting into the ceiling.\n\n\nPoI-7443-A:\n This is a holdup! Get down!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B runs to the teller door and shoots the lock off before grabbing the assistant manager, Brady Bachmann.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Show me where the vault is!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B walks towards the vault. The vault is opened and lockboxes are shown. Bachman and PoI-7443-B empty $750,000 into various bags.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Where's the rest of the money?\n\n\nBachmann:\n What?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n No funny shit. We know there was a shipment of money earlier.\n\n\nBachmann:\n There isn't- there isn't none- I mean is no money here- here right now.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Shut the fuck up and give me the money!\n\n\nAs PoI-7443-B attempts to extort further money from Bachmann, PoI-7443-A secures hostages within the lobby. PoI-7443-A approaches a security guard. PoI-7443-A places a gun on the back of the guard's head.\n\n\nPoI-7443-A:\n Whenever I tell you to, you are going to lead everyone in here to the vault and stay there.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B walks into the room.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Shipment didn't arrive today.\n\n\nPoI-7443-A:\n Try the ATM's. We just need to hurry up. Hey, you!\n\n\nPoI-7443-A aims his gun at the security guard.\n\n\nPoI-7443-A:\n Do what I told you.\n\n\nThe security guard escorts the hostages to the vault while both PoI's exit the bank.\n\n\n\n\nAt 09:24, Foundation agents assumed defensive positions around the bank and prepared for an altercation with both PoI's.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B attempts to destroy ATMs located on the exterior of the bank to recover further funding. PoI-7443-A witnesses armed Foundation agents and opens fire. All agents take cover and do not expose their positions to open fire at the PoI's. Five agents and twelve civilians are struck in the initial fire by PoI-7443-A. After four minutes of continuous fire, both PoI-7443-A and PoI-7443-B begin firing at Foundation agents and proceed to the car over the next three minutes. Both PoI's take turns providing covering fire to allow the other to proceed to the parking lot. Dye packets placed within the bags detonate, covering the majority of the money in a red dye.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n God dammit!\n\n\nPoI-7443-A:\n What?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n The money has dye packets in them. Just went off.\n\n\nBoth PoI's drop the moneybags and turn around the corner to the parking lot, where coverage of the conversations and actions of both PoI's is not recorded by the bank security cameras.\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 14 Foundation agents were initially dispatched in the primary detainment efforts. Due to the lack of prior awareness of the incident, and the lack of armed personnel present, agents were armed mostly with standard handguns and wearing LAPD uniforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround-level bodycam footage and audio | 09:28\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\n\n\nAll personnel on-location were designated TTFA-1\n2\n through TTFA-14 at the time. As more agents arrived at the scene, they were accordingly designated \"TTFA-X\".\n\n\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Stay down! Stay down! Shots fired!\n\n\nTTFA-8 fires at PoI-7443-A. PoI-7443-B fires at the car that TTFA-8 is taking cover with.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Can't do shit to them with these.\n\n\nTTFA-4:\n There is a gun store 'round here somewhere that we can take weapons from!\n\n\nTTFA-14:\n Is it worth using civie weapons?\n\n\nTTFA-10:\n Look at what they are using. We need firepower!\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n 4, 5, get some weapons from there.\n\n\nAs TTFA-4 and TTFA-5 exit, the exchange of gunfire between them and the PoI's continues. Gunfire hits TTFA-9 and TTFA-6. Both enter a civilian dentist's office to receive emergency treatment.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Shit. We're losing men!\n\n\nTTFA-1 reaches for his radio.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Area-09, agents are down! We need help! PoI's are opening heavy fire! I repeat, PoI's are opening heavy fire! Dispatch reinforcements!\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Should we switch to the shotguns?\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Not worth the risk retrieving them. Difference would be minimal.\n\n\nTTFA-12 is injured in the leg, and retreats to the dentist's office with TTFA-9 and TTFA-6. TTFA-1 fires a shot at PoI-7443-B, striking a direct-hit on his head. PoI-7443-B is seen clutching his head and leaning against a car, leaving bloody hand-prints against the car, confirming the direct hit on his head. PoI-7443-B ceases firing at agents and enters the car both PoI's were using. PoI-7443-A opens the car trunk and restocks his ammo, while maintaining fire at Agents.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Why isn't the car running?\n\n\nTTFA-14:\n Engine damage?\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n Soon as they go it's practically a free shot outa here. Sure as shit don't have enough firepower.\n\n\nTTFA-4:\n Time to fix that.\n\n\nTTFA-4 and TTFA-5 approach two clusters of Foundation agents and hand them rifles and semi-automatic weaponry.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Hand those out to as many personnel as you safely can.\n\n\nPoI-7443-A reaches into the car for an unknown reason, however, upon several agents opening fire PoI-7443-A is struck in the arm, and is prevented from utilizing it to aim at TTFA agents. PoI-7443-A uses his arm for the remainder of the fight to lay the gun against and raise it.\n\n\n\n\nGunfire continued between the PoI's and agents for 20 minutes as agents continued to fire at PoI-7443-A while approximately 24 reinforcements arrived. Foundation paramedics entered the zone to provide first-aid to injured agents, despite orders to remain back due to the risk of injury from either PoI.\n3\n\n\nTTFA-14 would enter close in proximity to PoI-7443-A and take cover behind a cement wall that separates the bank from a nearby neighborhood. PoI-7443-A began to fire rapidly at TTFA-14, securing two shots on TTFA-14's person while TTFA-14 hit PoI-7443-A's armor three times, including one shot in an unprotected gap in his armor along his waist, prior to a successful retreat. PoI-7443-A would continue to ignore the direct hits.\n\n\nAfter 14 minutes, the O5-2 and O5-4 approved the temporary emergency deployment of some members of MTF-Alpha-1, \"The Red Right Hand\", in order to assist in the detainment/neutralization of the PoI's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround-level bodycam footage and audio | 09:39\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B leans over to the car window and begins giving covering fire as PoI-7443-A restocks their ammo.\n\n\nTTFA-8:\n Second hostile is alive and opening fire! Take cover!\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Any of you got an idea when Alpha arrives?\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n 'Round 10 minutes. Just keep fire constant!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B opens a door on the side of the car that PoI-7443-A is standing beside. PoI-7443-A closes the door without entering. TTFA-2 fires a shot directly into PoI-7443-A's gun, forcing him to switch to a Type 56 Assault Rifle, which suffers numerous jams through the remainder of the incident.\n4\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Keep firing! He's probably down to his last bullets.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B begins driving the vehicle out of the parking lot, while PoI-7443-A utilizes it as moving cover while providing covering fire. At the time the car had two flat tires, at was moving at low speeds.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n PoI's are on the move! Keep a safe distance.\n\n\nAll TTFA members pursue the PoI's while maintaining safe firing distance. PoI-7443-A runs ahead to take cover behind a tractor-trailer, while PoI-7443-B drives in front of the trailer to wait for PoI-7443-A. PoI-7443-A appears to lose track of PoI-7443-B, and stays behind the trailer without knowing where PoI-7443-B is.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n The two are separated, keep them isolated!\n\n\nTTFA agents split in two to attack both PoI's. TTFA-13 proceeds towards PoI-7443-B, before opening fire at the vehicle, causing PoI-7443-B to rapidly exit the location without PoI-7443-A. Agents proceed with fire at PoI-7443-A, and strike him twice in the back. One of the shots struck PoI-7443-A's subclavian artery, causing mass bleeding.\n\n\nTTFA-5:\n First hostile's almost down. Legs are uncovered, aim for-\n\n\nTTFA-5 is struck by PoI-7443-A in the stomach, although shortly after PoI-7443-A's Type 56 jams, at which point PoI-7443-A racks the gun repeatedly, rendering it unusable at the moment.\n5\n PoI-7443-A drops the Type 56 and grabs a handgun while crawling under the trailer.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n I have eyes on hostile. Gonna draw him out from there.\n\n\nTTFA-13 strikes PoI-7443-A a further two times, at which point he exits from under the trailer and starts slowly walking into the road while occasionally firing with the handguns.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n All units move in! Hostile is poorly-armed and appears to be dazed.\n\n\nGunfire continues until one shot strikes PoI-7443-A's hand, causing him to temporarily drop the handgun. After 14 seconds, PoI-7443-A crouches down, grabs the gun, and shoots himself in the head. Neutralizing himself.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Hostile is crouching.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Just reloading! Continue fire!\n\n\nGunfire into PoI-7443-A's corpse for 43 seconds, until personnel approach PoI-7443-A's expired body and deem him dead.\n\n\n\n\n6 members of MTF Alpha-1 arrived shortly following the neutralization of PoI-7443-A. All Alpha-1 members were dispatched to deal with reports in the nearby area of a third, previously unknown shooter hiding in a nearby civilian house.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround-level bodycam footage and audio | 09:46\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B re-enters in proximity to PoI-7443-A's expired body. PoI-7443-B exits the vehicle and salutes PoI-7443-A's corpse prior to opening fire at nearby officers and moving back into the vehicle.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Second hostile spotted near first hostile's corpse!\n\n\nTTFA-2 and TTFA-1 open fire at PoI-7443-B. PoI-7443-B approaches a civilian truck and opens fire through the windscreen, causing numerous small cuts across the civilians person. The civilian exits the truck after activating a kill switch on the truck. PoI-7443-B does not notice, and begins to load ammunition and weapons into the truck as TTFA members approach.\n\n\nTTFA-8:\n I have a visual on hostile! Opening fire!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B exits the truck and seeks cover behind his original vehicle. Firing continues for 2 minutes and 30 seconds until PoI-7443-B grabs an AR-15, and continues fire. TTFA-7 is struck three times by PoI-7443-B.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Does anyone have a clear shot?\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n I do.\n\n\nAfter 28 seconds, TTFA-1 moves to the other side of PoI-7443-B's vehicle and hits him 3 times in the chest until PoI-7443-B returns fire. TTFA-1 takes cover under the vehicle.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n You okay 1?\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Affirmative. I have a visual on hostile's legs! Maintain rapid fire!\n\n\nTTFA agents maintain rapid fire on PoI-7443-B for 8 seconds until TTFA-1 begins fire at PoI-7443-B. PoI-7443-B notices and aims the gun down to return fire, striking TTFA-1\u00a08 times. TTFA-1 makes several effective hits against PoI-7443-B's legs, until successfully striking his hand and forcing PoI-7443-B to drop the AR-15. PoI-7443-B raises his arms and goes on his knees in surrender, however, TTFA-1 maintains fire at PoI-7443-B for 14 seconds striking him 6 additional times in the buttocks and leg.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n -B has surrendered! Cease fire! Cease fire!\n\n\nTTFA members close in on PoI-7443-B while paramedics and TTFA-2 approach TTFA-1.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n -B's detained?\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Yeah. How much have you been hit?\n\n\nTTFA-1 coughs.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Hell if I know.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Stay focused, okay? Stay awake.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Few hit my chest.\n\n\nTTFA-1 coughs blood.\n\n\nTTFA-1:\n Think they might've gone in my lungs.\n\n\nParamedics escort TTFA-1 to an ambulance while driving to an emergency Foundation-medical-outpost in close proximity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround-level bodycam footage and audio | 10:01\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\n\n\nTTFA agents approach PoI-7443-B. TTFA-13 places their gun against PoI-7443-B's head.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n Stay the fuck down!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Kill me ya fuckin' sonsabitches!\n\n\nPoI-7443-B is handcuffed, and has weapons on his body removed.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Why don't you put a bullet through my head?\n\n\nTTFA-2 approaches PoI-7443-B.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Is there a third gunman?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Lean me over and-\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Stop resisting. What is your name?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Pete.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Pete what?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Pete go fuck your mother. You'll all regret it when they come to bail us out.\n\n\nTTFA-2 reaches for a radio.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Hostile is detained and uncooperative. There may be a third PoI nearby, so remain on the lookout.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Coming here and invading our nation! We will make you pay for this!\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n -13, stay with me to secure the hostile. The rest of you, secure a perimeter and get civilians away.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the retrieval of TTFA-1, all paramedics and non-TTFA members were isolated from the area as it was believed there may have been the risk of a third PoI. Paramedics only began to enter the scene at 10:12\u00a0A.M. P.D.T.\n\n\nFoundation paramedics on scene were given an according designation of \"PM-X\".\n\n\n\n\nPM-4:\n Area safe yet?\n\n\nPM-1:\n Probably not. But we need to help the injured civs!\n\n\nPM-4:\n And if there's still shooters present? What happens if they shoot at us?\n\n\nPM-1:\n There most likely aren't any.\n\n\nPM-1 through PM-4 enter the area.\n\n\nPM-3:\n B even alive anymore?\n\n\nPM-2:\n He's just\u2026 Lying there.\n\n\nPM-1:\n Considering how much he was shot probably not. We'll keep an eye on him, but 3, 2, go to the houses to see if any civilians need help.\n\n\nPM-4:\n Then you and me?\n\n\nPM-1:\n Help anyone around here.\n\n\nPM-2 and PM-4 depart to nearby houses as PM-1 and PM-4 head to assist a bleeding civilian.\n\n\nPM-1:\n What's your name?\n\n\nKoike:\n James Koike.\n\n\nPM-1:\n Alright James, do you have any injuries other than the cuts on your face?\n\n\nKoike:\n Nah.\n\n\nKoike winces as the blood is cleaned from his face.\n\n\nKoike:\n Hurts like a bitch though.\n\n\nPM-4:\n What happened?\n\n\nKoike points to PoI-7443-B.\n\n\nKoike:\n That asshole.\n\n\nKoike points to PoI-7443-B. PoI-7443-B remains still.\n\n\nKoike:\n Was trying to steal my car then made some glass break over my face.\n\n\nPM-1:\n No other injuries?\n\n\nKoike shakes his head. The PM's treat Koike for his wounds over the next 254 seconds before noticing PoI-7443-B slightly moving.\n\n\nPM-4:\n B's still alive.\n\n\nPM-1:\n What?\n\n\nPM-4:\n He's moving.\n\n\nPM-1:\n Shit! Okay. James, will you be okay?\n\n\nKoike:\n Yeah.\n\n\nBoth PM's move towards PoI-7443-B. As they approach, TTFA-2 and TTFA-13 draw their guns from their holsters.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n What're you doing?\n\n\nPM-1:\n Moving to help B.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n It's not safe around here. There is a high likelihood of a third PoI coming back to try to free -B.\n\n\nPM-4:\n If we don't treat B he might expire.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n We will not risk losing manpower to save him. Especially not after they killed 1.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n The civilian also seems to have life-threatening injuries. You should probably focus on saving him first, even after everything you already did. That's what the \"P\" stands for. \"Protect\".\n\n\nPM-1:\n And what if B bleeds out?\n\n\nPM-4:\n Is it worth it?\n\n\nPM-1 turns to PM-4.\n\n\nPM-1:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nPM-4:\n If we treat B and a third PoI comes out to attack us, not only do our own lives get risked but if they kill us we won't be able to treat any more civilians.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n Look at the hostile. Do you really think you can save his life?\n\n\nPM-4:\n Is it worth potentially saving one life if we risk several more?\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Just take the civilian and move him away from the zone.\n\n\nPM-1 and PM-4 take Koike and leave the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:48\u00a0A.M. P.D.T\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B coughs.\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Fuck you all.\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n Keeping up the pleasantries?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n The DGS'll just send more people after you.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n What does the \"DGS\" even stand for?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Do-Good.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n This is you doing good?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Anything against your group is good. We are protecting our values against your infiltration. We are fighting for our countries freedom!\n\n\nTTFA-2:\n And you're happy about all of this?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Will be for a million years.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n What about the \"S\"?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Shit yourself.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n The Do-Good, shit yourself?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Yeah.\n\n\nTTFA-13:\n C'mon, what's it actually stand for?\n\n\nPoI-7443-B:\n Society.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-7443-B expired at 10:51 P.M. P.D.T. from bloodloss sustained via gunshot wounds. Due to the perceived danger in the area at the time, and the corresponding testimony of all TTFA and PM personnel on-scene, it was deemed unavoidable to comply with procedure and prevent PoI-7443-B's expiration. TTFA-1's medical condition stabilized approximately 14 hours and 11 minutes later, at which point a process of recovery began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the only thing we could do.\n\nWe all know it turned out to be false, but the risk was why we did not intervene. It was simply too high, all for a murdering gunnut who injured 41 people, Foundation or civilian. Keep in mind that prior to this event, the two PoI's had brutally murdered a civilian all for a bit of money. The world is better off without these two threatening those whom we try our hardest to serve.\n\n\n-Johnathan Joaquim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoaquim testifying to the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDespite immediate search efforts conducted by Alpha-1 to find a potential third PoI, involving the commendable rapid dismantling of potential barricades established in nearby civilian homes, no third PoI was located. All properties owned by either PoI were seized and searched for SCP-7443 and possible exterior anomalous connections. Numerous illegal-weapon-manufacturing laboratories were discovered, although no anomalous material was located.\n\n\nThe following note was discovered at PoI-7443-B's personal residence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings, new allies.\n\n\n\n\nAfter concerning your application, we have decided to \naccept\n both of\n\n\n\n\nyou into our ranks. In the box, are two suits of armor that are the best\n\n\n\n\ninvention conceived since the creation of Lightning in a Bottle!\n\n\n\n\nYou already are aware of what task you have been assigned to, that you have\n\n\n\n\nalready been \ntrained\n for. You will have a few days to take some time to get\n\n\n\n\nused to the armor given. Until then, get ready for your deed to the society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Mary Johansson, External Affairs Division, D.G.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the hours prior to the seizure of further personal properties of both PoI's, civilian witnesses attested that unidentified persons were seen entering the each premises and remaining for an unspecified period of time prior to exiting while carrying cardboard boxes. Further investigation into the researchers, and the, \"Do-Good Society\", is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Armament\u00a0Policy\u00a0Log.04|11|1996\u00a0[LEVEL\u00a04+\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0REQUIRED]\n\n\n\n\n-close\u00a0logs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5 Increased Field-Unit Arms Vote\n\n\n\n\nO5-1:\n Let's keep this short.

We are not here to debate, we are here to cast our votes.\n\n\nO5-11:\n And ignore that they let a valuable asset bleed to death for nearly an hour?\n\n\nO5-1:\n We are not here to discuss that either, 11.\n\n\nO5-11:\n And so I suppose that you soon shall reward the boy whom burnt down the house with enough fire to let the village alight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nNAY\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-1\n\n\nO5-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-2\n\n\nO5-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-5\n\n\nO5-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-6\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-8\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
