Generally, SCP-6707 species bear multiple appendages, attached to a central stalk supporting the organism's weight. Specimens exercise phototropism, growing to receive maximum light (generally from Earth's sun). Additional green appendages convert this light into sustenance for the primary organism, while additional appendages on the organism's bottom ground it and collect further sustenance.\n\n\nSCP-6707 forms a fundamental aspect of Earth's climate and numerous human cultures.\n\n\nAs far as extrasolar exploration can ascertain, no SCP-6707 instances or equivalent organisms exist beyond Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrev\n\n\nby\n\n\ndate\n\n\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nO5-4\n\n\n21 Jul 2094\n\n\nPreliminary documentation.
