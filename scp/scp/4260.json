The containment chamber housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to coalesce and bind its disparate elements.\n\n\nMaintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists\n1\n. MTF Gamma-8 (\"Baphomites\") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during Procedure 8917\n2\n.\n\n\nProcedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nMTF Gamma-8 (\"Baphomites\"):\n Assembled from technicians proficient in the operation of Strayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF Iota-39 (\"Gods and Monsters\") who will assist in their direction.\n\n\nMTF Xi-2 (\"Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly\"):\n An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917.\n\n\nMTF Tau-900 (\"Deliverance\"):\n An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the procedure's efficacy.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4260 has been successfully terminated.\n\n\nThe Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational.\n\n\nAll affected civilians have been located and terminated.\n\n\nAll evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed.\n\n\nSCP-4260 has been resurrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.\n\n\nAddendum.4260.1:\n Activations of Procedure 8917\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTermination Method\n\n\nProcedure Causation\n\n\nDuration of Effect\n\n\nAffected\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 1999\n\n\nFatal puncture wounds and blood loss, administered by MTF Xi-2.\n\n\nA massive containment failure at \nSite-62C\n.\n\n\n110 seconds\n\n\n3 civilians\n\n\nRecontained\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 2003\n\n\nBlunt force trauma by a member of MTF Xi-2.\n\n\nThe nuclear bombardment of Site-001.\n\n\n25 seconds\n\n\n1 civilian\n\n\nRecontained\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 2008\n\n\nDestruction of SCP-4260's hard drive, completed by MTF Xi-2.\n\n\nAn imminent \nCK-Class (\"Reality-Restructuring\") Scenario\n.\n\n\nIndeterminate\n\n\n7,213,426,000 individuals, termination unnecessary.\n\n\nRecontained\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 2015\n\n\nDetonation of an electromagnetic pulse grenade, performed by MTF Xi-2.\n\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of O5-6.\n\n\n180 seconds\n\n\n30 civilians\n\n\nRecontained\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 2016\n\n\nIncineration, committed by MTF Xi-2 during Experimental Operation \u201cMany-Crowned Serpent\u201d.\n\n\nThe insufficiency of SCP-4260's containment procedures.\n\n\n415 seconds\n\n\n10 civilians\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings, O5-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are viewing SCP-4260's low-clearance iteration (\nCurrent Access:\n \nL6-GENERAL\n).\n\n\nWould you like to view \nIteration \u03b2.4260\n?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
