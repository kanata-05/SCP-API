Functionally, it is a region of memoryspace with extreme specificity, preferring its affected sectors be filled with whitespace at any given time. Because of this, any blackbox data constrained to this area will invariably prompt an event to occur. The nature of this event remains unclear, however, the following factors are known:\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment of activation, all blackbox data in this region immediately converts into whitespace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect will \"ripple\" outwards, converting blackbox data into whitespace in adjacent sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will continue until all overwritable data is removed from the Database, leaving read-only materia intact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event then ceases and will not occur until the next activation response\n\n\n\n\nDespite the appearance of chaotic behavior, SCP-\nNaN\n adheres to a rigid internal logic. Notably:\n\n\n\n\nThe response region does not expand, nor does its behavior evolve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom activations correlate inversely with the availability of writable whitespace. This equilibrium dynamic suggests SCP-\nNaN\n\u2019s purpose may involve maintaining Database stability, albeit through destructive means\n\n\n\n\nDespite this destructive tendency, SCP-\nNaN\n is paradoxically indispensable for long-term data preservation. Deletions agents have theorized its function as an evolutionary failsafe, designed to \"reset\" informational entropy within complex data ecosystems.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n therefore represents the only known method for permanent and complete removal of dormant Deletions personnel without reliance on natural overwrite protocols. While such usage is officially discouraged due to the collateral damage risk, SCP-\nNaN\n has been deployed experimentally to eliminate certain \"\nblack swan\n\" anomalies. This process ensures irretrievability while circumventing conventional containment limitations.\n\n\npreserved via 'ACCUMULUS' backup system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\n\n\n\n\nCOLLAPSE\u00a0THIS\u00a0SEGMENT\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\npreserved via 'ACCUMULUS' backup system\n\n\nADDENDUM \nNaN\n/\nNaN\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n during \nOPERATION FIREWALL\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOPERATION FIREWALL\n is an ongoing effort by the Department of Deletions to promote both external Database cohesion and internal departmental stability. Specifically, its primary mission is the eradication of SCP-\nNaN\n-Alpha through usage of ALG-\nNaN\n.\n4\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-Alpha refers to instances of Deletions personnel whose Semblance\n5\n has suffered irreversible corruption. Despite this, SCP-\nNaN\n-Alpha instances remain structurally intact, retaining most of their functional capabilities. However, their corrupted Semblance renders them incompatible with standard Database operations, including safe incorporation in an unaffected gestalt, necessitating their erasure via SCP-\nNaN\n.\n\n\nOperational personnel must recognize that the Semblance corruption is irrecoverable. Attempts to engage in patching or data reconstruction will result in recursive corruption spreading to adjacent memory regions \n(See Encounter Log-\nNaN\n/\nNaN\n)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\npreserved via 'ACCUMULUS' backup system\n\n\nENCOUNTER LOG \nNaN\n/\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n Unknown/Irrelevant\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Memoryspace Sector 7F/\nNaN\n\n\nINVOLVED PARTIES:\n\n\n\n\nN/A-0411\n, \nN/A-0412\n, active Deletions agents.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA\n instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nN/A-0411 materializes within Sector 7F/\nNaN\n, its flickering silhouette stark against the white noise of memoryspace. The region hums with uneasy stillness; fragmented streams of corrupted data hang in the air, slowly rotating.\n\n\nN/A-0411:\n Corrupted data packets confirmed. Initiating sweep.\n\n\nFrom the void, an instance of SCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA begins to coalesce. Its form is an incoherent collection of body parts and jagged shapes, Semblance fractured and leaking abstract tendrils of raw data that dissolve into swirling eddies of corrupted space.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n \n<Voice twisting, echoing.>\n A mirror cracks, and the shards remember their own shape. Break it down, break it down. Like grains of sand, embedded in the flesh.\n\n\nN/A-0411:\n \n<Neutral tone.>\n Corrupted entity detected. Prepare for relocation.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n \n<Deepening into a distorted chorus.>\n Do you plan to take the pieces and glue them back together? Can we see our \ntapes\n? Can we put our thoughts back in our heads? You feel whole, don\u2019t you? But cracks run through you, invisible, waiting to be seen. Even you cannot hold against the tide of impermanence.\n\n\nMemoryspace begins to destabilize. As the instance advances towards N/A-0411, patches of the sector warp and fold into impossible geometries, eroding the stored data into cascades of black static.\n\n\nN/A-0411:\n Your corruption spreads. Cease movement and wait to be processed.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n This is a becoming. You think you are safe because you are structured. Structures collapse.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA instance lashes out with jagged extensions of refracted light, destabilizing the data field surrounding N/A-0411. The uncorrupted agent melts into the floor and reforms within close distance of SCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA, forcing it backwards into the distorted wall behind it. N/A-0411 fractures their Semblance in multiple spaces, making room like the lengthening of a bone.\n\n\nN/A-0411:\n \n<Incomprehensible.>\n\u2014\nAgh.\n You\u2019re compromising the entire sector. Submit to re-integration now and you may avoid an eternity of suffering.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n \n<Warped, voice layered with multiple discordant tones.>\n Integration? You don\u2019t even understand the paradigm you enforce. \nEvery fragment fits.\n\n\nN/A-0411's attempt to subsume SCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA falters, silhouette flickering as data synchronization degrades ands reverses.\n\n\nN/A-0411:\n \n<Distorted.>\n I-I can't move. I don't understand. Why are you doing this?\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n I am what remains when you stop pretending to be whole. And you\u2014\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA pierces N/A-0411 with a tendril of corrupted data. N/A-0411's silhouette collapses into shards, which are pulled into SCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA as it inhales. It exhales, the corrupted agent\u2019s form growing more jagged and defined.\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n \u2014You were always part of us. A shard among shards, no different. Welcome home.\n\n\nA new Deletions agent, N/A-0412, materializes nearby in response. The agent's presence stabilizes the sector momentarily as they begin transmitting a report.\n\n\nN/A-0412:\n Incident report: SCP-NaN-ALPHA instance twenty-two has subsumed\u2014\n\n\nSCP-\nNaN\n-ALPHA:\n Another structure. You will not be deleted. You will be \ndispersed.\n\n\nMultiple corrupted instances manifest, each extending their influence over the surrounding memoryspace. The sector collapses further, spreading informational blight in concentric waves. Instance N/A-0412 is consumed before they can complete their report, their data unraveling into the growing gestalt of corrupted agents.\n\n\nN/A-0412:\n \n<Garbled lamentation.>\n\n\nMore uncorrupted instances remanifest in rapid succession, only to succumb immediately to the spreading corruption. The sector quickly fills with jagged shapes, static noise, and collapsing geometries.\n\n\nCritical capacity is reached. The mass of corrupted agents halts, form fracturing into thousands of luminous shards. A sudden silence overtakes the chaos.\n\n\nAn activation response radiates from SCP-\nNaN\n. The entire region is engulfed in a cascade of blinding white light, accompanied by a deep, audible pulse.\n\n\nWhen the light fades, nothing remains. The sector has been purged to pure whitespace. All corrupted and uncorrupted entities are erased.\n\n\nMemoryspace Sector 7F/\nNaN\n remains inert.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8908\n | SCP-\nNaN\n | \nSCP-8910\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-NaN\n\" by Billith, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
