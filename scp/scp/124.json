The pit is to be 1.5 metres deep. A plastic tarp is to be placed over SCP-124 when not in use. Absolutely no biological matter is allowed within one metre of SCP-124 when not being studied. An armed guard is to be stationed outside SCP-124's cell at all times.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-124 is a plot of soil approximately 9\u00a0m\n2\n in area and 14\u00a0m\n3\n in size. It was recovered from a Detroit basement when authorities were notified of two teenagers growing large amounts of marijuana.\n\n\nSCP-124 has the ability to grow any biological organism to its full potential in a relatively short amount of time (the length varies according to the complexity of the organism). Nothing growing in SCP-124 requires external nutrients or other resources (for example, a tomato plant would not require water or light). Pesticides, too, aren't needed, as SCP-124 has a repellent effect on any insect or other invertebrates not growing in it. Any food grown in SCP-124 is reported to be of very high quality, taste, and nutrition, no matter what state the food was in before being planted in SCP-124.\n\n\nDocument 124-1: List of items grown in SCP-124\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a selective list of objects grown in SCP-124 during experiments.\n\n\nInput - Product of SCP-124\n\n\nTomato Seed - Fully grown tomato plant. All tomatoes (12 on each plant) were ripe and juicy. Reported to be \"very tasty\".\n\n\nSmall Watermelon (0.8\u00a0kg) - 11.1\u00a0kg (24.5\u00a0lb) watermelon. Reported to be \"very sweet and tasty\".\n\n\nGrass Seed (1) - SCP-124 quickly sprouted into a lush, green lawn within a matter of seconds. Slight dew on the grass.\n\n\nSmall, overgrown hedge - A hedge, trimmed and shaped like a dolphin.\n\n\nSmall, overgrown hedge - A hedge, trimmed and shaped like a skull.\n\n\nSmall Labrador Retriever puppy (sandy brown) - A fully grown, bronze-colored Labrador Retriever in peak condition. Currently living with Dr. Church.\n\n\nSmall Caucasian fetus (male) - \n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n After killing 6 personnel, the subject was terminated by SCP Containment Team.\n\n\nA piece of hard candy - A humanoid construct composed of hard candy. \nThe significance of this is unknown\n.\n\n\nFly larvae - [DATA EXPUNGED] Level 5 lockdown was initiated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-123\n | SCP-124 | \nSCP-125\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-124\n\" by Unknown Author, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
