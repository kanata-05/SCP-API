This cell is to be fitted with a food supply capable of sustaining SCP-2598 indefinitely, as well as a hanging light source\n1\n. Personnel who wish to interview SCP-2598 must first complete 20 hours of training in American Morse Code.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2598 is a Large Yellow Underwing moth (\nNoctua pronuba\n) wearing a small helmet. Apart from this, and its behavior, no other anomalous characteristics are discernible.\n\n\nSCP-2598 is able to communicate with humans by colliding with their heads in a pattern consistent with American Morse Code. While SCP-2598 is apparently able to hear and understand English, it is only able to communicate a return message in this manner. Despite having been offered specially-designed automatic translation pads with which it could collide, SCP-2598 has thus far seemed either unable or unwilling to use any such device.\n\n\nDuring conversation, SCP-2598 will invariably attempt to redirect the conversation towards a sales pitch for, specifically, a helmet designed for moths.\n\n\nInterview 2598-1:\n \nThe following interview was conducted by Dr. Richard Eads, who initially discovered SCP-2598 while on-location in [REDACTED]. Dr. Eads was chosen as the Research Team Leader because of his efforts in containing SCP-2598\n2\n, and his fluency with Morse code. During this interview, Dr. Eads remained seated in SCP-2598's containment cell, while SCP-2598 communicated to him via its preferred method. All replies were transcribed by Dr. Eads.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Eads:\n Can you hear and understand me alright, SCP-2598?\n\n\nSCP-2598:\n YES HELLO DOCTOR I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE THANKS TO THE SOUND AMPLIFYING TECHNOLOGY OF MOTH HELM\n\n\nDr. Eads:\n Excellent. Now, SCP-2598, could you tell me anything about where you originated from?\n\n\nSCP-2598:\n I WAS ONCE LIKE YOU DOCTOR AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE WITH NO PURPOSE IN MY LIFE UNTIL I DISCOVERED THE BEAUTY OF MOTH HELM ALSO SAFE FOR CHILDREN NO CHANCE OF GETTING STUCK IN THROATS\n\n\nDr. Eads:\n I see. So you're saying that you were unable to comprehend spoken language, or communicate as you can now, before you came into possession of the helmet?\n\n\nSCP-2598:\n IT WAS LIKE A DOOR BEING OPENED BEFORE ME DOCTOR AND I COULD SEE THE LIGHT IT WAS ALL POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF MOTH HELM WHICH YOU YOURSELF CAN OWN TODAY FOR AS LITTLE AS THREE EASY PAYMENTS OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE\n\n\nDr. Eads:\n You're aware, of course, that I could not possibly wear such a helmet? It's far too small.\n\n\nSCP-2598 pauses for twenty seconds, is observed spinning counterclockwise around its containment cell light.\n\n\nSCP-2598:\n YES BUT PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOME MOTH FRIENDS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE TRANSCENDANT POWER OF MOTH HELM ALSO IS A GREAT STOCKING STUFFER\n\n\nEnd transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Placed at the request of SCP-2598.\n\n\n2\n. According to Dr. Eads' Discovery Report, he first discovered SCP-2598 by noticing its irregular flight patterns, then its helmet, and then later discovering its communicative abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2597\n | SCP-2598 | \nSCP-2599\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2598\n\" by djkaktus, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
