Personnel assigned to Outpost-3418 are required to rotate out every two consecutive weeks, with staggered terms. Personnel must be observed by at least one other staff member while sleeping, without exception.\n\n\nPersonnel are to maintain constant surveillance of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River, and must retrieve instances of SCP-3418-1 on sight, unless SCP-3418-2 is present. Personnel are to remain at least 20m from SCP-3418-2 at all times, and must not attempt interaction with the entity at any time, for any reason.\n\n\nUpon identifying instances of SCP-3418-1, the individual's family (or present living company) will be located and administered Class-A amnestics, misdirecting them to believe that the person in question was killed in a mundane manner. Five instances of SCP-3418-1 will be held for research purposes; the remainder are to be incinerated.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Verify\u00a03/3418\u00a0Clearance\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a03/3418\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Verified\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation is in contact with the Chinese government, with a joint effort to prevent civilian movement into and out of the area. To prevent suspicion regarding mass disappearances, the 40km area surrounding SCP-3418 must be saturated with a Class-B amnestic aerosol on a monthly basis. The local populace is to be monitored for adverse effects from the frequency of amnestic treatment.\n\n\nFor each instance of SCP-3418-1 discovered, one D-Class personnel shall be apportioned for Outpost-3418 to ensure that the human presence within SCP-3418's area of influence remains at 200 persons or greater.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3418 is a phenomenon occurring in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River in [REDACTED], China.\n\n\nSCP-3418-1 are complete, recently deceased human remains which spontaneously manifest within a 700m section of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River. In all cases where SCP-3418-1 have been identified, they have corresponded to reports of missing persons within a 40km area surrounding SCP-3418. These reports share a commonality in that the victim was abducted while asleep, with no witnesses.\n\n\nThe cause of death for SCP-3418-1 is unknown. SCP-3418-1 exhibit abnormal decomposition and are not consumed by microbial, insect or animal life, enabling them to remain well-preserved without external assistance.\n\n\nIn contrast to the comprehensive cell death in all other tissues, the central nervous system of SCP-3418-1 remain alive and fully functional despite lack of oxygen and vital nutrients, and is capable of surviving indefinitely. Due to the complete lack of activity in the peripheral nervous system, sensory organs and other systems, all attempts to communicate with or determine the level of consciousness (if any) in SCP-3418-1 have failed. Electroencephalogram and functional neurological imaging demonstrate high levels of activity.\n\n\nSCP-3418-2 is a massive aquatic entity which sporadically manifests within the area of SCP-3418. The entity resembles \nBagarius yarrelli\n (Goonch or Giant Devil Catfish), and is selectively intangible, rendering it immune to physical damage or capture. SCP-3418-2 possesses intricate, faintly luminescent markings over its entire body. Additionally, its eyes are absent, the orifices instead filled with pale green, opaque gemstones which emit faint light.\n\n\nUndisturbed, SCP-3418-2 preys exclusively upon SCP-3418-1, swallowing the latter rapidly and whole. If interrupted, SCP-3418-2 will attack and consume the responsible party, if possible. SCP-3418-2 produces small amounts of neutron radiation, and generates substantial Cherenkov radiation when manifesting or vanishing.\n\n\nAddendum [3418-001]:\n Timeline of SCP-3418 Discovery & Containment\n\n\n\n\n28/04/20\u2588\u2588:\n Reports initially surface regarding human remains in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River, in [REDACTED] China. Situation is minimally monitored by local Foundation assets, due to lack of evidence for anomalous involvement.\n\n\n02/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Coroner's report detailing abnormalities in the four recovered human remains is intercepted by Foundation personnel. Recovered items are appropriated by the Foundation, as are several newly discovered remains in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River. Identity of the deceased successfully traced to missing persons in the [REDACTED] area.\n\n\n07/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Initial sighting of massive aquatic organism in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River. Initial reports are unsubstantiated, but monitored closely by Foundation personnel due to proximity to another suspected anomaly.\n\n\n11/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Seven further human remains are discovered in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 River. Anomaly upgraded from Extranormal Event classification and designated SCP-3418. Exploration initiative authorized.\n\n\n15/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Aquatic entity (now designated SCP-3418-2) encountered by Foundation exploration team.

Two personnel lost during breach.\n\n\n25/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Attempt made to destroy SCP-3418-2. Attempt failed.\n\n\n28/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Attempt made to destroy SCP-3418-2. Attempt failed.\n\n\n31/05/20\u2588\u2588:\n Attempt made to destroy SCP-3418-2. Attempt failed.\n\n\n01/06/20\u2588\u2588:\n Containment analysis of SCP-3418. Fourteen sets of human remains (now designated SCP-3418-1) are secured by Foundation personnel. Projections do not indicate viable long-term covert containment.

Observation of the entity only persisted for approximately fifteen minutes until contact was lost, however, the crew reported seeing luminescent markings and massive, pale green \"eyes.\" Approximate longitudinal size of the entity based on eyewitness accounts and recovered instrument data is over 200m. The crew was administered Class-A amnestics following interrogation and appropriation of instrument data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph appropriated from Event-3418-Sh\u0113nyu\u0101n.
