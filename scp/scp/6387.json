Subject was hairless, with tapered ears and cloven, hoof-like feet; no reproductive organs were present. SCP-6387's hands, disproportionately large, each possessed four digits with protruding claws measuring 6\u00a0cm in length. Whether or not SCP-6387 was sapient remains unknown.\n\n\nSCP-6387 was first sighted in Oakland Cemetery on October 15, 1923. Shortly after midnight, 50-year-old groundskeeper Joseph Rutledge awoke to the sound of an intruder. Initially suspecting grave robbers, Rutledge set out to investigate, whereupon he discovered SCP-6387 digging furiously at the site of a fresh burial plot.\n\n\nStartled, Rutledge shot SCP-6387 twice in the chest with a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver. Subject expired instantly, with Rutledge later informing the civilian authorities. Agents embedded in the local police force subsequently alerted the Foundation to suspected extranormal activity. SCP-6387's remains were transported to \nSite-44\n for research, with amnestics administered to all witnesses.\n\n\nThe grave targeted by SCP-6387 was exhumed, and found to contain the remains of 24-year-old milkmaid Charlotte Abernathy, who was reported to have died following an epileptic seizure the previous morning. The casket's interior exhibited numerous prominent scratch marks; cause of death was deemed suffocation. Ms. Abernathy was reburied without further incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6386\n | SCP-6387 | \nSCP-6388\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6387\n\" by Dr Leonerd, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
