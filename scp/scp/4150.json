Affected individuals should be contained and made to listen in full to the song \u201cPenny Lane\u201d by the Beatles. Low-level amnestics are to be administered to all present.\n\n\nSCP-4150-1 is \nto be contained in a soundproof standard holding cell\n neutralised and buried at Site-19. SCP-4150-2 through 4 are to be kept in individual standard lockboxes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4150 is an auditory cognitohazard affecting all intelligent life possessing both functioning ears and functioning eyes. Beings considered clinically deaf or blind are unaffected.\n\n\nSCP-4150 resembles the 1967 Beatles song \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, but features several lyrical corruptions (see Document 4150-Alpha). Testing has determined that these corruptions are a feature rather than the source of SCP-4150\u2019s anomalous properties.\n\n\nIndividuals who hear SCP-4150 in full feel a powerful urge to reproduce SCP-4150 (vocally or otherwise) and pass its effect to as many other individuals as possible. Spread is typically slow, taking at least three minutes and three seconds (3:03) to fully transfer from one individual to another.\n\n\nSCP-4150-1 through 4 are objects determined to be the source of SCP-4150 outbreaks. SCP-4150-1, retrieved 11/30/2016 (deceased 05/02/2018) was Mr. Simon \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the singer for a Beatles tribute band. SCP-4150-2 and SCP-4150-3, retrieved 02/27/2018, are a pair of freestanding stereo speakers. SCP-4150-4 is the mobile phone of Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-4150-4\u2019s internet browser was opened to a radio website (designated SCP-4150-4.1) apparently created by avant-garde movement Are We Cool Yet? The internet domain was seized by the Foundation on 04/12/2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 4150-4\n\n\nInterview 4150-1.1\n\n\nInterview 4150-1.2\n\n\nDocument 4150-Alpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 4150-4\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 04/10/2018\n\n\nIncident Details:\n At approximately 14:37, Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 accessed SCP-4150-4.1, using SCP-4150-4, through unknown methods. Security footage shows Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appearing increasingly agitated over the next five to ten minutes. It is suspected that Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was aware that he had been compromised but was unable to resist the compulsion.\n\n\nAt 14:52, Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 accessed a security station at Site-19 and subdued a guard using a small Taser unit before broadcasting SCP-4150 through the site tannoy system.\n\n\nThe system was shut down externally at 14:54, before SCP-4150 could be broadcast in full.\n\n\nAt 14:57, Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was shot and killed by guards.\n\n\nThirteen (13) staff members were later compromised via a group email D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had sent from the security station with SCP-4150 attached as an audio file. All these incidents were contained.\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n A total of thirty-three (33) personnel were fully compromised, and a further two hundred and twelve (212) required treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 4150-1.1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4150-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Roth\n\n\n<Begin Log, [10:50]>\n\n\nResearcher:\n SCP-4150-1? My name is Roth. I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions.\n\n\n4150-1:\n How long are you gonna be keepin\u2019 me in here? I\u2019ve done nothin\u2019 wrong!\n\n\nResearcher:\n All we\u2019re trying to determine is how you caused this phenomenon.\n\n\n4150-1:\n I didn\u2019t cause nothin\u2019! It came to me. Whispered its way into the back of my head, peeled the muscle and bone apart and burrowed its way into my ear.\n\n\nResearcher:\n The phenomenon was physical?\n\n\n4150-1:\n Yeah. No. Maybe. There weren\u2019t any scar. Any mark. Just the itch like there shoulda been one. Ya know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\n\n\nResearcher:\n Would you say there was an intelligence behind this? Something malevolent?\n\n\n4150-1:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It. It sure had a, uh, purpose. A meaning.\n\n\nResearcher:\n Like a message?\n\n\n4150-1:\n Yeah! A message! Like it was trying to tell me somethin\u2019, tryna let the whole world know what was comin\u2019. Because, like, I had an audience. Because I was \nattuned\n. So it, like, took my form, took my aspect and angle and like. Bent itself through me like I was a lens and my music, Lennon\u2019s music and McCartney\u2019s music, that was a mould for it to press itself into, refracted through a billion billion lil\u2019\u2026 holes\u2026\n\n\nResearcher:\n Are you okay?\n\n\n4150-1:\n It wears on me nowadays. The way it forced isself into me, it like, frayed me at the edges. And now I\u2019m so tired all the time\u2026\n\n\nResearcher:\n How about the concert? What can you tell me about the event?\n\n\n4150-1:\n I\u2019m so tired. Can\u2019t ya help me, doc?\n\n\nResearcher:\n I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m just -\n\n\n4150-1:\n It\u2019s in me. Spiraled in deep down in the bones. It\u2019s all I see and hear.\n\n\nResearcher:\n I think we should continue this conversation later -\n\n\n4150-1:\n Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.\n\n\nResearcher:\n [Into microphone] Requesting extraction immediately.\n\n\n4150-1:\n Deep beneath the blue suburban skies.\n\n\n[Personnel enter the room and sedate SCP-4150-1.]\n\n\n<End Log, [10:57]>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Researcher Roth reported an \u201cearworm\u201d. Upon listening to \u201cPenny Lane\u201d in full, this ceased. SCP-4150-1 was strongly suspected to be holding back information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 4150-1.2\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4150-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Roth\n\n\nNote:\n This interview was scheduled after the discovery of SCP-4150-4 and 4.1.\n\n\n<Begin Log, [09:32]>\n\n\nResearcher:\n Good morning, SCP-4150-1. I hope you\u2019re well rested.\n\n\n4150-1:\n My name's Simon.\n\n\nResearcher:\n Let\u2019s keep this quick. What does the phrase \u201cAre We Cool Yet?\u201d mean to you?\n\n\n[SCP-4150-1 becomes noticeably agitated.]\n\n\nResearcher:\n Sir?\n\n\n4150-1:\n Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes!\n\n\nResearcher:\n That isn\u2019t going to work this time, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m wearing specialised earplugs.\n\n\n[SCP-4150-1 displays sudden frustration and anger.]\n\n\nResearcher:\n Any chance you could answer my question?\n\n\n4150-1:\n You\u2019re all fascist pricks. Stiflin\u2019 art. Try\u2019na take music you don\u2019t like and fuck it. Hide it away where, like, no-one can hear it \u2018cept the worms.\n\n\nResearcher:\n So the phenomenon was man-made.\n\n\n4150-1:\n No! What kinda hack would \u2013 never mind. Music comes from the soul, ya stupid fucks. We just channelled somethin' that was already there. Gave it a way out. That music needs to be heard!\n\n\nResearcher:\n And you are affiliated with the group known as Are We Cool Yet?, is that correct?\n\n\n4150-1:\n We're just one collective. We\u2019re dedicated to bringin' down the institutions, like you, by returnin\u2019 power and awareness to the people. Art is freedom and you fuckers are oppressin' it.\n\n\nResearcher:\n But an anomaly like this poses a substantial threat to \"the people\", wouldn't you say?\n\n\n4150-1:\n Penny Lane issn'a threat. It\u2019s a warning. I told ya. There\u2019s things out there you won't never be prepared for. And they\u2019re comin\u2019.

Subject died a week later on 05/02/2018. The phrase \u201cPENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES\u201d was scrawled on the wall of his cell in blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe album cover depicted on SCP-4150-4.1 while SCP-4150 was playing appeared to be based on the artwork for \n1\n, a collection of the Beatles' number one chart hits.
