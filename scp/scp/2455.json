Should an instance of SCP-2455-1 be detected, Site Security is to be notified immediately, and the following procedures enacted as necessary:\n\n\n\n\nIf the SCP-2455-1 instance is identified as a member of Foundation personnel and classified information is discussed in the presence of SCP-2455, SCP-2455 is to be administered a low-grade amnestic after the manifestation ceases. Internal Affairs is to be notified.\n\n\nIf the SCP-2455-1 instance exhibits behavior analogous to being under the effects of another SCP object, a containment team is to be dispatched to 2455's cell, and the corresponding object secured to preemptively prevent contact from occurring.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2455 is a Caucasian woman of 21 years of age, capable of generating anomalous projections, designated SCP-2455-1. SCP-2455 possesses no anomalous properties outside of a SCP-2455-1 manifestation event, and is noted by staff as indecisive to the point of apathy towards its own containment.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2455-1 will manifest in the nearest space available. These entities appear identical to SCP-2455, with one visible factor altered, most commonly clothing. Generally SCP-2455-1 instances will be observed wearing a uniform corresponding to an organization SCP-2455 is not currently affiliated with. SCP-2455-1 instances have been confirmed to possess knowledge comparable, if not an exact match, to that of SCP-2455's, in addition to expected information regarding their apparent affiliation.\n1\n\n\nSCP-2455 claims that SCP-2455-1 manifests when it is faced with a 'major decision'. See test logs attached below for analysis on this claim. SCP-2455-1 instances appear with the sole intention of insuring SCP-2455 'picks their future'. SCP-2455 claims the first appearance of SCP-2455-1 occurred shortly before its graduation from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 University, as SCP-2455 was attempting to choose which business to apply for employment with. Two instances of SCP-2455-1 manifested, one 'representing' the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Corporation, and the other the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 store, a local business. Both instances possessed knowledge of the working conditions of both positions,\n2\n and attempted to convince SCP-2455 to 'pick them'.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a0log\u00a02455\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a0log\u00a02455\n\n\n\n\nTest 001 - 04/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject is offered a different colored uniform.\n\n\nResults:\n No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Trivial decisions do not appear to trigger SCP-2455's effects.\n\n\n\n\nTest 002 - 04/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject is asked if it wished to be moved to a different site.\n\n\nResults:\n No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n From SCP-2455's point of view, the two situations were identical.\n\n\n\n\nTest 003 - 04/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject is offered employment with the Foundation.\n\n\nResults:\n No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Subject was visibly conflicted by this decision, however no manifestation event occurred.\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if SCP-2455's effects could tell that we were not genuine with our offer?\n - Dr Vauge.\n\n\nTest 034 - 06/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Unplanned test. As no test conducted so far had resulted in a manifestation event, the research staff were considering doing final tests and declaring SCP-2455 non-anomalous.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing casual street clothes. Upon manifestation, SCP-2455-1 attempted to hide from research staff. When discovered, SCP-2455-1 vanished immediately.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n In the time period between SCP-2455-1 manifesting and its discovery, there was a real chance that SCP-2455 would be administered amnestics and released back into society. This indicates three things: first, that it does not have to be SCP-2455's decision that affects its future, that there has to be a real chance of that future occurring, and that SCP-2455-1 manifestations are not necessarily conductive to that future.\n\n\n\n\nTest 036 - 07/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (currently under watch from Internal Affairs for known sympathies to humanoid anomalies) was asked to interview SCP-2455.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the uniform of a junior researcher, and attempts to convince Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to employ SCP-2455, citing the precedents of [REDACTED]. SCP-2455-1 ignored SCP-2455.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n This manifestation was aware of classified information, notably the anomalous natures of [REDACTED]. Further questioning revealed that SCP-2455-1 was in possession of knowledge which would be expected of a Foundation employee with level 2 clearance.\n\n\n\n\nTest 041 - 31/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Unplanned test. SCP-2455 was being moved to another facility.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the same clothing as SCP-2455, however was infected with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nAnalysis:\n The infected manifestation attempted to attack SCP-2455 to infect it with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. The escorting guards were able to neutralize the instance as they would a normal SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 victim. Shortly afterwards, a containment breach occurred at Site-\u2588\u2588, during which samples of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 were released. Possibility of using SCP-2455 as an 'early warning' system is deemed worthy of further research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02455-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02455-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n An SCP-2455-1 instance identical to the one produced by test 036.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Necessary to cause this instance of SCP-2455-1 to manifest)\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-2455-1 had been taken to another room so that SCP-2455 would not be involved.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 14/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588>\n\n\nDr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n May I have your name?\n\n\nSCP-2455-1:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And the girl you were found with, what is her name?\n\n\nSCP-2455-1:\n She's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as well.\n\n\nDr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And the other 2455-1 instances are\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-2455-1:\n Idiots.\n\n\nDr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-2455-1:\n The way I am now my future is either with the Foundation or locked up by the Foundation.
