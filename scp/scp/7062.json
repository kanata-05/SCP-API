SCP-7062-A was an ink jar full of dried blood belonging to Dr. Becker. SCP-7062-B was Dr. Becker\u2019s heart, functioning with no irregularities despite being completely disconnected from her body.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7062 was discovered post-neutralization on 08/09/1998 when Dr. Becker was found expired on her desk. After a standard sweep of her apartment, SCP-7062-A and SCP-7062-B were discovered on a personal desk, alongside several poems written in blood. A coroner's report found that the heart had suffered rapid takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n1\n, resulting in the expiration of the researcher. Along with Dr. Becker\u2019s corpse, a note in standard ink was found on the desk. A direct transcription can be found below.\n\n\n\n\nHere I sit alone\n\nEverything is cold and dark\n\nStill waiting for you to phone\n\nYou were my spark\n\nNow tears stream down my face\n\nYour beauty reminded me of a dove\n\nI see shadows in your place\n\nNow I know the pain that comes with \nlove\n\n\n\n\nCharacters became increasingly illegible near the end of the note. Additionally, the final letters of the note were obscured due to the presence of lacrimal fluid.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
