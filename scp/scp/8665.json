As for the entities summoned by the anomaly, they are to be locked in a replica of the White House. (Read information below for more context). To pick up the object, tweezers are needed.\n\n\nCurrent Site of the Object:\n Site-76\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-8665 is a paranormal shield protecting US Standard coins. If a coin is touched, it will summon the US president that it has drawn in it. They cannot be destroyed yet they can be locked, as their shield is extremely strong.\n\n\nIf the coins are touched by any other objects or anomalies that possess the ability to destroy instantly by just touching objects, the shield will cause an energy explosion and afterwards remain intact.\n\n\nAny president summoned by SCP-8665 has a bad memory and needs to be talked through things so they can fully understand any kind of situations.\n\n\nThe coins are the following:\n\n\n==1 Penny==\n\n\n==1 Nickel==\n\n\n==1 Dime==\n\n\n==1 Quarter==\n\n\n==1 Half-Dollar==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of SCP-8665 before containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery Location and Time:\n SCP-8665 was found in a hotel room in the Pearl Hotel, South Walton, Florida in June 19, 2024 by a 27-year-old male called Ethan Grant Jackson. He discovered the coins in the room he had been staying for the past 10 hours. (Room 8). Jackson tried to take the coins from the ground, thinking they are just normal coins, but he grabbed the Quarter and observed how George Washington just appeared in front of him, which scared him. But instead of calling 911, he touched the coin again and he saw how George Washington ceased to exist. From that moment, he spent 2 hours trying to destroy the coins with no success at all, until the loud noise made the other guests in the hotel report him. After he explained everything to the hotel personnel and showed evidence of what he was saying, the hotel personnel called 911. Once the authorities arrived, Jackson explained what just happened to him and they contacted the US Government. The US Government informed the SCP Foundation and the Foundation arrived to the place 44 minutes after. The personnel of the hotel was asked to check the cameras past recordings and the hotel guest lists from the past few days to see who was there before Ethan. They did this while the Foundation figured out what the coins could do. The hotel personnel was also asked to check in the guest lists who was in that room before Jackson. And in the guest lists, the only person to be in that room before Jackson, was Rebecca Aldridge Winslow, a 42-year-old female. She was found at her home and the Mobile Task Force took her to Site-76, the same thing was done with Jackson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl Hotel, South Walton, Florida, US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity of the Object and Experiments Done:\n\n\n\n\nInterrogation Log:\n SCP-8665 #1\n\n\nDate:\n 06/19/24\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. James Holloway Carter\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Ethan Grant Jackson\n\n\nInterrogation Note:\n Jackson was told he'd get $5,000 USD if he shared what he knew with the Foundation, but he was told that just so he could talk without complications. The Foundation spared the trouble of giving him the money.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nHolloway:\n Hello, Mr. Jackson, my name is James Holloway but you can call me Dr. Holloway. I would like to ask you a few questions about the coins you found in the hotel. If you give us all the information you can, we'll give you another five thousand dollars. First of all, what do you know about the coins?\n\n\nJackson:\n All I saw was George Washington appearing. He disappeared when I touched the coin again.\n\n\nHolloway:\n What about the other coins?\n\n\nJackson:\n Same thing happened. I never thought I would get to see John F. Kennedy with my own eyes.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Why were you trying to destroy the coins?\n\n\nJackson:\n Well those coins scared the shit out of me and I did what I thought was the smart thing to do. But get this; 2 hours of trying to destroy those coins and nothing worked. Hell, I even tried to use a saw and the saw ended up more damaged than the coins.\n\n\nHolloway:\n What else do you know about these coins?\n\n\nJackson:\n At first, I tried to scrape them with a needle and a blue sparkle came out.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Is that everything you can tell us?\n\n\nJackson:\n \n[FIVE SECONDS LONG SILENCE]\n Y-yeah.\n\n\nHolloway:\n \u2026In that case, I think we're done for today. Agent Crawford, please give Mr. Jackson some amnesia pills and escort him out of the facility.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nWe later figured out that if a president is summoned, then unsummoned, and lastly summoned again. The president will appear with no memories of his last reincarnation.\n\n\n\n\nInterrogation Log:\n SCP-8665 #2\n\n\nDate:\n 06/19/24\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. James Holloway Carter\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Rebecca Aldridge Winslow\n\n\nInterrogation Note:\n Aldridge talked without having to be offered anything.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nHolloway:\n Hello Ms. Aldridge.

I would like to know why i'm here if you don't mind answering.\n\n\nHolloway:\n It's all about a group of coins you left on the Pearl Hotel. You were staying there three days ago. Do you remember?\n\n\nAldridge:\n I do. I remember dropping a bunch of coins under the bed accidentally. But I didn't pick them back up because at this age it's almost impossible. And I didn't bother the hotel personnel because it was less than a dollar. I still don't understand what that has to do with me being in this government facility.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Did you notice anything weird about those coins?\n\n\nAldridge:\n Not at all. I mean, they're just coins.\n\n\nHolloway:\n If you don't mind, we'll spare the trouble of sharing the information of why you're here.\n\n\nAldridge:\n \n[SIGH]\n It's OK.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Perfect.

Then I fell unconscious and woke up in this place.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Did you see something when you fell unconscious?\n\n\nSCP-8665-1:\n Well\u2026 I saw a blue light, and then I had a dream about some kind of place with copper everywhere.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Okay\u2026 so you say you fell unconscious in the Ford theatre, who is the last person you saw?\n\n\nSCP-8665-1:\n One of the actresses of the play that night; \"Our American Cousin\".\n\n\nHolloway:\n Which actress?\n\n\nSCP-8665-1:\n Mary Meredith.\n\n\nHolloway:\n Did you see any other famous actor anywhere around?\n\n\nSCP-8665-1:\n Well, yes. It was a theatre after all.\n\n\nHolloway:\n I'll just ask you more directly. Did you see John Wilkes Booth anywhere?\n\n\nSCP-8665-1:\n No\u2026 I mean\u2026 yes.

He was told that he was suffering from hallucinations after falling unconscious. (It was that assumed he fell unconscious at some point after the past interviews). He was told that everything would be explained if he cooperated even tho it was not true. But he already had some idea after he saw the symbol that was everywhere in the Facility. He had worked with SCP as a president before.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRose:\n Hello Mr. Roosevelt, my name is Emily Rose but you can call me Dr. Rose. I will be asking you a few questions and after you cooperate with us, we'll explain everything you've seen so far.\n\n\nSCP-8665-3:\n Y-yeah well, how are both George Washington and Abraham Lincoln alive? Was that someone in a costume?\n\n\nRose:\n As I told you, cooperate and everything will be explained\u2026 what is the last thing you remember?\n\n\nSCP-8665-3:\n I-\u2026 I was in the Little White House Historic Site, in Georgia. And then I collapsed and woke up in this site.\n\n\nRose:\n When you fell unconscious what did you see?\n\n\nSCP-8665-3:\n Nothi-\u2026 wait\u2026 I remember now. First, a clear blue light.

We are done with him for now.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nBy this point, it was known what was happening. The presidents fell unconscious at the time they were supposed to be dead and had a dream about the material their respective coins are made of. By the fact that Thomas Jefferson looked so young despite him dying of old age, it was assumed that the presidents reincarnate looking the way they do in the coins yet remembering everything they pre supposedly lived.\n\n\nEver since Ethan Grant Jackson said that he tried to destroy SCP-8665 with no success at all due to a shield protecting the coins, the Foundation has tried to break the shield using different types of acids, lava and other corrosive liquids, but that didn't work. Hammers, knives and all kinds of weapons were used to try to break the shield as well, with no success. In Site-19 a scientist asked for \nSCP-294\n to generate \"A cup of SCP-8665 destroyer\" but the machine refused to generate it. It showed a text saying \"\nSCP-682\n was enough\". The coins were transported back to Site-76 afterwards. Once there, the Foundation also tried to make other animals touch the coins to see if the US Presidents were summoned. They were not. Not even objects could touch the coins and summon the presidents. Only humans. This was useful information because now it was known that any form and/or kind of material could be extracted from the coins by just using animal paws/feet or objects like tweezers.\n\n\nThe shield protecting the coins is invisible most of the time, it stops being invisible when it is touched by a human or something trying to destroy it. If any other type of object that's not trying to destroy the coins or any other living creature that isn't a human, touches the coins, the shield doesn't appear. This demonstrated that the shield is what makes the unnatural events occur and not the coins themselves.\n\n\nDetailed Pictures of the Anomaly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny\n\n\nNickel\n\n\nDime\n\n\nQuarter\n\n\nHalf-Dollar\n\n\nShield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of the shield that protects the coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8665-A:\n\n\n\n\nInterrogation Log:\n SCP-8665 #6\n\n\nDate:\n 06/24/24\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Emily Rose Kessler\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8665-4: \"George Washington\"\n\n\nInterrogation Note:\n SCP-8665-4 was very agressive and confused at first, so he had to be put under the influence of drugs so he could talk without a problem.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRose:\n Hello Mr. Washington, my name is Emily Rose but you can call me Dr. Rose.

(The coins surface, to be more specific). It was managed to be extracted without activating the shield, using animal paws/feet and tweezers. The material found was put under a microscope and \ndark matter\n was found. (The material that molds the universe). This proves that the shield is somehow connected to the power source of the universe.\n\n\nEvidence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroscopic view of SCP-8665\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8665-C:\n\n\nSCP-8665 was moved to Site-02 for research purposes. While the anomaly was there, \nSCP-106\n moved. This made the facility activate the emergency protocol. Someone took advantage of the situation and made \nSCP-106\n touch the Half-Dollar coin to see if anything happened. The shield's light turned into a extremely shiny red clear light while the coin was floating in the air. It illuminated the whole place, and when the light disappeared, the facility had a blackout and multiple SCP's were released by consequence. After this disaster was controlled, Site-76 took back SCP-8665.\n\n\nAddendum 8665-D:\n The US presidents have been moved to identical replicas of the White House to contain them there.\n\n\nAddendum 8665-E:\n In June 30 of 2024 Rebecca Aldridge Winslow was found dead in the outdoors of Pearl Hotel in South Walton, Florida.

The Foundation has tried to summon the entity described as \"Death\", but there is no apparent success.\n\n\n2\n. The red-shield effect that ocurred in Site-19 was attempted to be re-created yet there hasn't been any success either. A hypothesis on why it happened was still made. It is believed to have happened due to an object that can corrode every type of matter, having contact with an object that is made of an entirely different type of matter. Dark matter. Just like when two opposite magnets have contact, except for the fact that the reaction in this case was a lot more agressive.\n\n\n3\n. \"Death\" is theorized to be a being that can somehow warp reality. This considering the fact that the coins contain the very type of matter that shapes the universe.\n\n\n4\n. It is not only believed that dark matter is what makes the shield unbreakable, but also that dark matter is what causes the anomaly in general. The dark matter found in the coins is believed to be sediments of the shield.\n\n\n5\n. The note found next to Aldridge's body contained dark matter as well.\n\n\n6\n. \"Death\" might be a cosmic being rather than a mystic one. The dark matter found in the coins and in the note is what fundaments this theory.\n\n\n7\n. It is unsure if this \"Death\" has any correlation with the \"Death\" that \nSCP-1440\n has described whatsoever. \nSCP-1440\n was asked how \"Death\" looked and he described three different persons that tricked him. But SCP-8665-5 described a horrifying creature that appears to be every evil mythological character merged into one being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7",

The Foundation spared the trouble of giving him the money. [BEGIN LOG] Holloway: Hello, Mr. Jackson, my name is James Holloway but you can call me Dr. Holloway. I would like to ask you a few questions about the coins you found in the hotel. If you give us all the information you can, we'll give you another five thousand dollars. First of all, what do you know about the coins? Jackson: All I saw was George Washington appearing. He disappeared when I touched the coin again. Holloway: What about the other coins? Jackson: Same thing happened. I never thought I would get to see John F. Kennedy with my own eyes. Holloway: Why were you trying to destroy the coins? Jackson: Well those coins scared the shit out of me and I did what I thought was the smart thing to do. But get this; 2 hours of trying to destroy those coins and nothing worked. Hell, I even tried to use a saw and the saw ended up more damaged than the coins. Holloway: What else do you know about these coins? Jackson: At first, I tried to scrape them with a needle and a blue sparkle came out. Holloway: Is that everything you can tell us? Jackson: [FIVE SECONDS LONG SILENCE] Y-yeah. Holloway: \u2026In that case, I think we're done for today. Agent Crawford, please give Mr. Jackson some amnesia pills and escort him out of the facility. [END LOG]",

[BEGIN LOG] Holloway: Hello Ms. Aldridge. My name is James Holloway but you can call me Dr. Holloway. I would like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. Aldridge: Not at all. I would like to know why i'm here if you don't mind answering. Holloway: It's all about a group of coins you left on the Pearl Hotel. You were staying there three days ago. Do you remember? Aldridge: I do. I remember dropping a bunch of coins under the bed accidentally. But I didn't pick them back up because at this age it's almost impossible. And I didn't bother the hotel personnel because it was less than a dollar. I still don't understand what that has to do with me being in this government facility. Holloway: Did you notice anything weird about those coins? Aldridge: Not at all. I mean, they're just coins. Holloway: If you don't mind, we'll spare the trouble of sharing the information of why you're here. Aldridge: [SIGH] It's OK. Holloway: Perfect.

He was told that he was suffering from hallucinations after falling unconscious. (It was that assumed he fell unconscious at some point after the past interviews).

SCP-8665-5: [HIGHLY AGRESSIVE TONE] I know! [THREE SECONDS LONG SILENCE] I- I know, i'm sorry. But I know. I asked Death for success in life and he told me that he'd give it to me only if when I reach success not only my soul is his, but also the souls of those who managed the same success as me. Rose: So is it like the Devil? SCP-8665-5: It's like every demonic or evil being in every mythology merged into one being.
