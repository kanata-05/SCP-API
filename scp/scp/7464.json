A chain link fence is to be erected on the edges of this perimeter, with inspections being subsequently on a bi-yearly basis to ensure the condition of the aforementioned fence. Maintenance of the fence will be done at the discretion of the head researcher.\n\n\nDue to the abundance of corpses within the graveyard that SCP-7464 grows in, it is not expected to exhaust its current food source for several decades. Should the subject be determined to have run out of its supply of its current food source, additional corpses or carcasses are to be procured.\n\n\nAdditional Special Containment Procedures (Jan 27, 1965):\n Due to the slowness of SCP-7464\u2019s means of communication, audio recording devices are to be placed at the \u201cmouths\u201d at the ends of SCP-7464\u2019s arms in order to determine the current word the anomaly is communicating. As the subject\u2019s occasional state of pain precludes it from communicating for weeks to months at a time, special schedules are to be created regarding when and how authorized personnel can communicate with the anomaly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7464 is an immobile humanoid entity currently growing within an abandoned graveyard, made to assume the shape and functions of a tree. In order to fulfill its role, SCP-7464 has been found to have several unique characteristics:\n\n\n\n\nA rounded and cylindrical body mimicking the structure of a tree trunk, with its rib cage being expanded far beyond its normal shape in order to support the subject\u2019s weight.\n\n\nA bark-like outer covering made entirely of hardened human calluses, allowing the subject the ability to resist both blunt and sharp forces.\n\n\nAbnormally elongated legs that dig into the soil in the same way as roots, with specialized bone-eating humanlike mouths within the soles of its feet that allow it to consume corpses below.\n\n\nTwo separate esophagi within both legs located between the fibula and tibia bones as well as within an abnormally enlarged femur bone, leading up to the subject\u2019s stomach.\n\n\nAn extremely slow metabolism and growth rate which allows SCP-7464 to survive on little food for months at a time\n\n\nTwo vertically outstretched arms covered in long, thick, black hair that mimic the structure (but not the function) of leaves or vines. Beginning from December 17, 1964, these arms, unlike their legs, branch at the elbow or the fingers. This allows more arms to grow in their place.\n\n\nHands with humanlike mouths located on the surfaces of their palms. Unlike the mouths located on the anomaly\u2019s legs, these mouths only seem to possess the ability to allow the anomaly to breathe.\n\n\nTwo separate tracheae within both arms that connect the mouths on the surfaces of their palms to the anomaly\u2019s extremely large lungs. Both tracheae lack vocal cords, rendering SCP-7464 incapable of normal speech.\n\n\nTwo extremely small ears on either side of the anomaly\u2019s \u201cface\u201d.\n\n\nTwo large, bloodshot eyes on the anterior surface of the anomaly\u2019s trunk.\n\n\nA large \u201cfacial\u201d mouth, sewn shut with a thin vine-like thread\n1\n\n\n\n\nAside from its unique tree-like characteristics, it has been determined that SCP-7464 possesses much the same physiology and anatomy as a normal human. As demonstrated within Addendum 7464.1, SCP-7464 is capable of feeling pain, often quivering, tearing up, or crying in response to branching limbs, burrowing termites, or other conditions. SCP-7464\u2019s eyes are also capable of slowly following researchers who lapse into its field of vision, implying basic animalistic sentience. However, its sapience \nis yet to be proven.\n (see Addendum 7464.1)\n\n\nAddendum 7464.1:\n The following log contains a summary of events and discoveries related to SCP-7464 beginning from its discovery to the present day. For ease of use, communication-related events are highlighted in \nblue\n and damage-related events are highlighted in \nred\n.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 1964:\n SCP-7464 is discovered growing at a remote cemetery within a remote graveyard near the abandoned village of Sao Antonio in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. A 2km fence perimeter is erected around the subject by the Brazilian branch of the Foundation.\n\n\nNovember 4, 1964:\n \nSCP-7464\u2019s breathing is heard getting louder, but no special note is made of it.\n\n\nDecember 17, 1964:\n SCP-7464\u2019s right upper arm begins to branch at the elbow. A smaller, infant-like hand is seen emerging at the wrist. SCP-7464\u2019s eyes are first seen tearing up.\n\n\nDecember 24, 1964:\n The mouth of the new emerging arm opens for the first time. \nAll mouths begin to exhale at 30 decibels\n2\n, well above the normal exhalation decibel level of 10.\n\n\nDecember 31, 1964:\n SCP-7464 begins to occasionally quiver.\n\n\nJanuary 3, 1965:\n The new arm continues to grow. However, unlike its counterparts, it grows downwards opposite the direction of the subject\u2019s arm.\n\n\nJanuary 18, 1965:\n \nA researcher sees a small but growing termite nest on the subject\u2019s right underarm, eating away at the wood-like calluses of SCP-7464\u2019s skin.\n SCP-7464 continues to exhale at 30 decibels.\n\n\nJanuary 20, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 is heard continuously making an \u201ch\u201d sound as it exhales in a manner similar to whispering.\n\n\nJanuary 27, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds from an \u201ch\u201d to an \u201ce\u201d. Special note is made of this, with audio recording devices being set up beside SCP-7464\u2019s mouth to best observe any other changes.\n\n\nJanuary 30, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cl\u201d sound.\n\n\nFebruary 1, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cp\u201d sound.\n\n\nFebruary 3, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cm\u201d sound.\n\n\nFebruary 4, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cee\u201d sound.\n The words \u201cHELP ME.\" are discerned.\n\n\nFebruary 10, 1965:\n SCP-7464 is redefined as sapient, but unable to communicate effectively. After formulating a response with his team, Head Researcher Campos asks SCP-7464 what it is.\n\n\nFebruary 11, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 begins to form an \u201ca\u201d sound.\n\n\nFebruary 19, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cm\u201d sound.\n\n\nFebruary 24, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201ca\" sound.\n\n\nMarch 2, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cn\u201d sound.\n The words \u201cA MAN.\u201d are discerned.\n\n\nMarch 3, 1965:\n \nThe termite nest within SCP-7464\u2019s right underarm continues to eat away at SCP-7464\u2019s skin.\n\n\nMarch 4, 1965:\n Head Researcher Campos asks SCP-7464 what happened to it.\n\n\nMarch 5, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 begins to form an \u201ca\u201d sound.\n\n\nMarch 7, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201cc\u201d sound.\n\n\nMarch 8, 1965:\n \nThe termites eat past SCP-7464\u2019s epidermis and begin to chew on its dermis. Blood is seen flowing from the wound.\n\n\nMarch 9, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts sounds to an \u201ca\u201d sound.\n\n\nMarch 12, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 continues to emit an \u201ca\u201d sound.\n\n\nMarch 15, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 continues to emit an \u201ca\u201d sound. It seemingly refuses to shift sounds any further. Campos\u2019 team attempts to find a reason as to why.\n\n\nMarch 16, 1965:\n Junior researcher Almeida suggests that \n\u201cIt\u2019s trying to scream.\u201d\n\n\nMarch 17, 1965:\n A plan is made to remove the termites from SCP-7464\u2019s skin. A boric acid solution was considered, but ultimately discounted due to the perceived risk to SCP-7464\u2019s health\n3\n. A Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) solution was applied instead.\n\n\nMarch 19, 1965:\n SCP-7464 continues to scream.\n\n\nMarch 20, 1965:\n \nFirst application deemed insufficiently effective. Termites are hypothesized to have burrowed under SCP-7464\u2019s skin. More blood is seen flowing from the wound.\n\n\nMarch 22, 1965:\n Second application of DDT solution made.\n\n\nMarch 25, 1965:\n \nSolution deemed insufficiently effective. Small parts of SCP-7464\u2019s skin near the original underarm area is seen bulging. SCP-7464\u2019s wound is deemed to be at risk for infection.\n\n\nMarch 27, 1965:\n \nDeeming that there was no other choice, a boric acid solution was sprayed onto the termite infestation within SCP-7464\u2019s skin.\n\n\nMarch 28, 1965:\n \nBlisters develop on the sprayed area. SCP-7464\u2019s \u201cscreaming\u201d begins to move down to 10 decibels.\n\n\nMarch 29, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 is unresponsive. Its body temperature is elevated from 36 degrees Celsius to 38 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nMarch 30, 1965:\n Termite corpses begin to slowly fall out of SCP-7464\u2019s wound.\n\n\nApril 1, 1965:\n SCP-7464 remains unresponsive. Its body temperature slowly begins to fall to 36 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nApril 7, 1965:\n SCP-7464 continues to remain unresponsive. Its eyes remain open.\n\n\nApril 9, 1965:\n The falling of termite corpses from SCP-7464\u2019s wound ceases.\n\n\nApril 12, 1965:\n \nSCP-7464 is deemed to be catatonic.\n\n\nApril 29, 1965:\n Another hand is seen growing from SCP-7464\u2019s left elbow.\n\n\nJune 17, 1965:\n The arm beneath the newly grown hand begins to fully emerge. Another hand is seen sprouting from the wrist of the first.\n\n\nJanuary 2, 1966:\n SCP-7464 continues to grow. More branches are seen emerging from its wrists and elbows.\n\n\nApril 7, 1966:\n \nOne of SCP-7464\u2019s fingers from its original right hand begins to slowly wither in a manner similar to gangrene.\n\n\nSeptember 26, 1966:\n \nThe withering has spread to almost all of SCP-7464\u2019s fingers. Its left hand begins to show the same withering.\n\n\nMay 3, 1968:\n \nBoth of SCP-7464\u2019s original hands become dried husks, with the shape of the fingerbones underneath becoming wrapped by blackened skin.\n Meanwhile, more of SCP-7464\u2019s newly-grown hands continue to branch.\n\n\nJanuary 3, 1972:\n SCP-7464 continues to grow and branch out. However, it begins to bend anteriorly as it does so. \nMore of its older hands and arms begin to wither.\n\n\nSeptember 4, 1975:\n SCP-7464\u2019s anterior bend corrects itself, giving its trunk a crooked shape as it grows upwards.\n\n\nMay 28, 1983:\n SCP-7464\u2019s withered branches begin to fall off.\n\n\nOctober 6, 1987:\n \nA bird lands on one of SCP-7464\u2019s withered hands. It begins to build a nest from its withered fingers.\n\n\nOctober 9, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 begins to cry.\n\n\nOctober 30, 1987:\n On a routine visit by Head Researcher Almeida, SCP-7464\u2019s eyes move for the first time in decades.\n\n\nNovember 4, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 is heard making an \u201ck\u201d sound.\n\n\nNovember 6, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201cu\u201d sound.\n\n\nNovember 9, 1987:\n At the direction of Site Director Campos, Head Researcher Almeida begins to note the shifts in the sounds that the subject makes.\n\n\nNovember 14, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201cr\u201d sound.\n\n\nDecember 2, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201css\u201d sound.\n The words \"CURSE.\u201d are discerned. Head Researcher Almeida concludes that this is SCP-7464\u2019s answer to the last question asked of it.\n\n\nDecember 3, 1987:\n Head Researcher Almeida asks SCP-7464 what cursed it.\n\n\nDecember 4, 1987:\n SCP-7464 is seen pulling the edges of its mouth in a slight smile. It begins to tear up.\n\n\nDecember 7, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 is heard making a \u201cth\u201d sound.\n\n\nDecember 8, 1987:\n \nA woodpecker lands on one of SCP-7464\u2019s branches. It begins to burrow into SCP-7464\u2019s trunk.\n SCP-7464 is seen slightly quivering, but continues to speak.\n\n\nDecember 18, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201ce\u201d sound.\n\n\nDecember 19, 1987:\n \nRoot rot begins to manifest on SCP-7464\u2019s left leg. It rapidly withers the leg. SCP-7464 continues to speak.\n\n\nDecember 25, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 continues making an \"e\" sound.\n\n\nDecember 26, 1987:\n \nThe hair on SCP-7464\u2019s arms begin to fall out, leaving behind bald spots. The subject continues to speak.\n\n\nDecember 31, 1987:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201ct\u201d sound.\n\n\nJanuary 1, 1988:\n \nThe woodpecker penetrates SCP-7464\u2019s hardened skin and begins burrowing into its flesh. SCP-7464\u2019s eyes become bloodshot, but it continues to speak.\n\n\nJanuary 5, 1988:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201cr\u201d sound.\n\n\nJanuary 6, 1988:\n \nTree fungi begins to manifest on SCP-7464\u2019s right eyeball. The subject continues to speak.\n\n\nJanuary 10, 1988:\n \nSCP-7464 shifts to making an \u201cee\u201d sound.\n\n\nJanuary 11, 1988:\n \nA large flock of birds begin to land on SCP-7464\u2019s branches, breaking off both withered and healthy fingers and arms.\n SCP-7464 quivers violently, but continues to speak.\n\n\nJanuary 17, 1988:\n \nSCP-7464 continues to make an \u201cee\u201d sound.\n\n\nJanuary 18, 1988:\n \nThe vines sewing SCP-7464\u2019s facial mouth shut begin to shorten, ripping parts of its lips and causing blood to flow down from its face.\n SCP-7464 continues to speak.\n\n\nJanuary 22, 1988:\n \nSCP-7464 finishes by making an \u201cs\u201d sound.\n The words (\u201cTHE TREES.\u201d) are discerned.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate (Jan 23, 1988):\n Using the new technology of DNA testing, Foundation researchers extracted a sample from SCP-7464 in order to discern its identity within the organization\u2019s database.\n\n\nA definitive match was made with Mr. John Pereira, a Brazilian-American lumber mogul last seen on October 1, 1964. He disappeared while surveying a part of the Amazon rainforest for land clearing.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. This remains the only instance of SCP-7464 possessing any normal plant-based characteristics.\n\n\n2\n. The decibel equivalent of a human whisper\n\n\n3\n. Boric acid is a caustic solution, with symptoms of boric acid poisoning including seizures, fevers, and a lack of responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article was written by\n \nEcronak\n.\n\n\nImages created by AnAnomalousWriter.\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7463\n | SCP-7464 | \nSCP-7465\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7464\n\" by Ecronak, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
