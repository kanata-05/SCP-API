This cell must not exceed an area of 8m x 8m. SCP-5282-1 is not to exit the containment cell except during testing. SCP-5282-1 is to be provided with the following:\n\n\n\n\nOne plush doll. Subject is permitted to request a change.\n\n\nOne \"LEGO Bricks & More - Creative Bucket,\" for recreational purposes.\n\n\nFive coloring books of any brand. Books may be swapped at the request of subject.\n\n\nOne box of crayons, any brand.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5282-2 is to be kept in a standard anomalous item storage locker directly adjacent to SCP-5282-1's cell. SCP-5282-2's recall radius must encompass SCP-5282-1's cell at all times to prevent any unintended containment breaches.\n\n\nBoth SCP-5282-1 and -2 are currently housed at Site-17.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5282-1 is a female of Western European descent, 105\u00a0cm tall, weighing 15.3\u00a0kg (~33.7 lbs). SCP-5282-1's apparent age is estimated to be four or five years, however, SCP-5282-1 has been in Foundation custody for several years without any notable change in appearance. SCP-5282-1 refers to itself as \"Ava,\" and states that it does not know its last name.\n\n\nLittle Ava and her beautiful toys,\n\nSCP-5282-2 is the collective designation given to a set of 50 wooden alphabet blocks of varying size. Material analysis of SCP-5282-2 reveals no anomalous materials or structures.\n\n\nWanted by all of the girls and the boys\n\nSCP-5282-2's primary anomalous effect manifests when SCP-5282-1 arranges a selection of SCP-5282-2 instances to spell out the name of a noun in the English language. When this takes place, the object described will appear within the general vicinity of SCP-5282-1 within approx. 5 seconds. SCP-5282-2 does not produce these objects, rather, the object is taken from where it was previously located and deposited near SCP-5282-1. The method of transportation is unknown, and is theorized to be anomalous in nature as well.\n\n\nThe colorful letters\n\nSCP-5282-2's secondary anomalous effect occurs when SCP-5282-1 travels a certain distance away from a given SCP-5282-2 instance, which has been designated the \"recall radius.\" This field is spherical in shape, and extends approx. 15m from each SCP-5282-2 instance. When SCP-5282-1 exits this radius, the given SCP-5282-2 instance will immediately appear within 1m of SCP-5282-1.\n\n\nMake everything better,\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\n\nSCP-5282-1 and -2 were recovered on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Prior to recovery, several news stations published articles regarding the sudden appearance of a fossilized \nTyrannosaurus rex\n skeleton at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Daycare Center, in [DATA REDACTED], USA. Elsewhere, reports were made about the sudden disappearance of the same \nTyrannosaurus rex\n skeleton at the [DATA REDACTED] Museum of Natural Sciences. Upon investigation, SCP-5282-1 and -2 were found at the site of the appearance, bearing several other objects of unknown origin. The \nTyrannosaurus rex\n skeleton was returned, and amnestics properly distributed. SCP-5282-1's parents have not been identified, however, there is a possibility that [DATA REDACTED].\n\n\nAlways spreading feelings of joy!\n\n\n\n\n-Dr. W\n\n\nTest Logs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 5282-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpelled Word\n\n\n\n\n\"ROCK\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimes Performed\n\n\n\n\nOne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\nOne small stone, weighing about 1.5\u00a0kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 5282-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpelled Word\n\n\n\n\n\"FRUIT\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimes Performed\n\n\n\n\nFive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\nFive ripe apples, Red Delicious variety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5282-1 described this type of apple to be their \"favorite.\"\n - Researcher Weaver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 5282-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpelled Word\n\n\n\n\n\"TREE\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimes Performed\n\n\n\n\nOne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\nOne adult English oak tree, with roots still intact.
