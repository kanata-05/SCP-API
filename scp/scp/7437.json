Under no circumstances are any personnel to be authorized to directly interact with or consume any amount of SCP-7437. Routine maintenance checks of SCP-7437's containment tank are to occur on a daily basis. Any entities or personnel attempting to consume any amount of SCP-7437 are to be detained on sight. If detainment is not a viable option, immediate termination is authorized.\n\n\nSCP-7437-A instances are to be contained within standard Euclid-level humanoid containment cells. Due to the biological requirements of SCP-7437-A instances, no food or water is to be provided. Pain suppressants are to be administered to SCP-7437-A instances every four hours. If the behavior expressed by instances of SCP-7437-A becomes violent or otherwise unpredictable, they are to be restrained and sedated until re-exhibiting typical behavior. Personnel are permitted to interact with SCP-7437-A instances if explicit authorization has been granted by personnel with Level 5/7437 Security Clearance. All instances of SCP-7437-A are to be subject to regular Tartarean Resonance Energy monitoring. Under direct command of the Ethics Committee, research into the termination of SCP-7437-A-1 is currently ongoing.\n\n\nAll further testing regarding SCP-7437 has been indefinitely suspended.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7437 is approximately 13.5 liters of ectoentropic liquid that is chemically identical to human blood. SCP-7437 remains at a constant temperature of 103 celsius, and all attempts to alter the temperature of SCP-7437 have proven unsuccessful. Despite exceeding the boiling point of non-anomalous human blood, SCP-7437 does not appear to be boiling, and is visually indistinguishable from blood at room temperature.\n\n\nUpon the consumption, injection, or general intake of any amount of SCP-7437, the entity in question is to be designated as an instance of SCP-7437-A. SCP-7437 causes several changes in instances of SCP-7437-A. The most notable changes include:\n\n\n\n\nThe biological aging process ceases to occur, and the instance of SCP-7437-A cannot expire. Attempts to anomalously alter the age of SCP-7437-A instances have resulted in no noticeable changes.\n\n\nSCP-7437-A no longer needs to consume food or liquid to sustain itself, and it no longer requires sleep or oxygen to biologically function. However, SCP-7437-A instances still suffer physical pain as a result of being unable to breathe.\n\n\nAll diseases, viruses, and infections present in SCP-7437-A at the time of consumption will subsequently and instantaneously terminate. SCP-7437-A instances are not affected by any diseases, viruses, or infections, both anomalous and non-anomalous in nature, upon the consumption of SCP-7437.\n\n\nSCP-7437-A gains physical regenerative abilities that prevent it from being terminated by SCP-7437, or by any other known means. Any physical trauma sustained will typically regenerate within several seconds, however exact recovery time varies depending on the extent of the trauma suffered. As a result, no methods to terminate any instances of SCP-7437-A are currently known to exist.\n\n\n\n\nEntities that are not biological in nature or do not possess blood are unable to become an instance of SCP-7437-A, and are subsequently unaffected by SCP-7437. Upon consuming SCP-7437, the instance of SCP-7437-A that consumed it will have the amount of SCP-7437 present in their system begin circulating through their blood vessels, converting any non-anomalous blood it comes in contact with into further instances of SCP-7437. Exsanguinated instances of SCP-7437 do not possess any anomalous properties, and all attempts to completely purge SCP-7437 from an instance of SCP-7437-A have proven ineffective.\n\n\nSCP-7437 radiates a consistent and excessive amount of Tartarean Resonance Energy, equivalent to approximately 780% of the typical amount produced by Tartarean entities. Despite this, the Tartarean Resonance Energy emitted by SCP-7437 has not shown to have any significant effect on its surroundings. Instances of SCP-7437-A have proven to emit negligible amounts of Tartarean Resonance Energy, equivalent to 40% of the typical amount produced by Tartarean entities. Attempts to terminate or interfere with the effects of SCP-7437 on instances of SCP-7437-A using methods specifically meant to affect Tartarean entities have proven ineffective.\n\n\nSCP-7437-A-1 is the only known instance of SCP-7437-A, and is L\u00e9on Levasseur, a French explorer born in 1460, and one of the three parties responsible for the creation of SCP-7437. All attempts to communicate consistently with SCP-7437-A-1 have resulted in failure, with the events transcribed in Addendum-7437-B being the only exception.\n\n\nAddendum-7437-A:\n Translated\n1\n travel logs of Cyril Levasseur, written during 1483.\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0FIRST\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0FIRST\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, 16th of April\n\n\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Our majesty, King Louis, has tasked me and my elder brother to travel to the beyond lands of Greece, and seek out water from the mythical river Phlegethon. L\u00e9on, bless his heart, did not have previous knowledge of the river Phlegethon, nor its mystical ability to cure all unholy ailments, and prolong the existence of both body and spirit. Nevertheless, he was exceptionally emphatic about the task, as is befitting of him. This, precisely, is why our Majesty seeks it for himself. He has informed me and my brother that his maladies had only progressed further into ruin, and all he has attempted thus far has been for naught. Thus, due to our supposed \"greatness\", we have been tasked with obtaining water from the river Phlegethon, and delivering it upon him, so that his reign may continue for as long as our Lord intends.\n\n\nAs is proper, L\u00e9on is particularly excited about this, and he is yet to truly stop his ramblings about his desire for both of us to become immortal alongside our highness. He hopes that we become nothing but the most renowned explorers across all of Europe. I, for one, know such a fate is not meant to befall us. Or rather me, at least. I only accompany my brother because being a famed explorer is but his deepest fantasy, and I dread to imagine discouraging him from pursuing it. Even so, I do not understand the point of obtaining immortality. Life in itself already harbors so little meaning, why would anybody choose to prolong it?\n\n\nBut no matter, as long as L\u00e9on is content, and as long as I can reap some benefit from whatever spoils our majesty will grant us, I will journey nevertheless. Half an hour after dawn, we shall set our sights on Greece, and leave Dijon to wait for our return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0SECOND\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0SECOND\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, 17th of April\n\n\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. As I had planned, we left half an hour after the sun rose beyond the crest of the horizon. We traveled on foot, as we had prior arrangements to receive mobile carriages upon arriving at Pontailler-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. For our own safety, L\u00e9on wielded his axe, and I wielded my blade and matchlock. Fortunately, praise be to the lord, we did not encounter any quarrels during our travels today.\n\n\nWhen the sun had reached its zenith in the sky, we settled down for a moment to eat lunch. As we were doing so, a traveler approached us from the beaten path. I approximate the man being in his early forties. His hair was greying and shortly cropped, however his spirit was young, and his eyes carried great wisdom within them. He approached us, and greeted us with a warm smile. He asked if we were \"explorers such as himself\", or simply strangers passing through. I informed him that we were indeed strangers, however L\u00e9on would proceed to enthusiastically inform him that we were on a quest for King Louis to find the river Phlegethon in order to prolong his life, even going to the length of presenting the written document from our majesty himself. The stranger chuckled, and sat down next to us. He presented his own document from the king, saying that he was indeed on the same quest as us. For the next few moments, we engaged in delightfully intellectual banter about the mythos of the Greek people. It was evident he was a scholar of their esoteric beliefs. However, he informed us that he had no intention to travel to Greece, as that was simply far too costly for him. Rather, he said he knew of a ritual used by the Greeks to convert ordinary river water into that of the rivers of Hades. His intention was to travel to the Erdre and collect the water from it in order to use it in the ritual.\n\n\nI asked if we could accompany him to the Erdre river, to which he declared it would most certainly be unwise to do so, as our majesty must have separated us for a reason. However, he said we were more than welcome to assist him with his quest, and to rendezvous with him should the opportunity arise, assuming the Lord willed it such. He also advised us that we collect any asphodel flowers we may come across on our journey, as it will be a key ingredient in the ritual. L\u00e9on was initially resistant, believing that it was our god-given objective from King Louis to travel to Greece, however I reminded him that this could guarantee his desired status much faster than the alternative. Before we went our own separate ways, I asked for his name. \"Peor\", he said. Just as quickly as he arrived, he was gone.\n\n\nIn other news, the weather was quite pleasant, and we could hear grouse and doves throughout the day. Our fire is dwindling and L\u00e9on has already begun his rest, so I suppose I shall stop here for the night. I am elated that we no longer have to travel all the way to Greece, though. I find solace in that, and I hope L\u00e9on does too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0THIRD\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0THIRD\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday, 18th of April\n\n\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Early in the morning we spotted some wild fowl, and the overcast clouds that must have formed while we were resting seem to have parted. Today has been particularly troublesome. Towards the middle of the day, we approached a nearby patch of woodland to the west of Dijon. After several minutes of traversing these woods, we came upon a clearing. In the center of this otherwise inconspicuous clearing was a freshly trimmed and tended-to chrysanthemum bush. Standing before the bush was a figure clad in the garb of a knight, wielding a bident which he had plunged into the ground, and donning a horned helmet reminiscent of a wild goat. Behind his visor radiated what could only be described as an intense and unholy energy. He stood before us and spoke in a dolorous, booming voice. \"Cease. There is nothing for you here, nor is there anything for you beyond my forest. I know what you seek. You seek an affront to nature itself. I cannot permit your quest to continue\". I must admit, I can only take somebody who dulls their weapon by placing it in the soil but so seriously, nevertheless I still wanted no quarrel with this man. I spoke to him, saying that there must be another way to go about this. I asked him for his name in an attempt to make friendly conversation with him. \"Baal\", he responded.\n\n\nHe told both L\u00e9on and I to not bother telling him our names, as he had no intention for any further words to be shared. He raised his weapons, and we drew ours. As we prepared to defend ourselves from this interloper, the head of his polearm caught aflame, only further proving my theory that this is the work of some occult magicks. We battled fiercely, but he possessed much greater finesse than myself, and even L\u00e9on himself. He parried or dodged every slash of my blade and every swing of my brothers axe. L\u00e9on and I managed to avoid any grievous injuries, thank the Lord, but after several seconds, Baal bludgeoned me with the pommel of his bident, making direct contact with my face. I stumbled back, falling disorientated, leaving my brother to fend against him alone. He swiftly knocked L\u00e9on off of his feet and raised his weapon above his chest. I tried to grab ahold of the branches of the chrysanthemum bush, snapping it off, mysteriously causing Baal to reel back in pain, temporarily sparing my brother from harm. I snapped another, intentionally this time. Baal cringed in pain once more, loudly vocalizing as he did so. He looked back and fixed his gaze on me. As he approached me, I began to saw at the base of the bush, to which he reacted by falling to his knees in pain, roaring in agony. In some pitiful effort to thwart my efforts, he rose his bident; and prepared to throw it at me. However, before he could release it, I had fully severed the bush from its stem, causing him to completely collapse on the ground, lifeless. I had slain the daemon.\n\n\nI helped L\u00e9on off the ground and recollect himself. We studied the idle corpse for a few moments, before quickly fleeing. I did not think much of it at the time, but I do ponder how he knew of our quest. Who could have informed him? Could Peor have told him? Perhaps an enemy plotting against our majesty? I was uncertain, and truly, it was not my place to say. Nevertheless I couldn't help but speculate. Surely this was not a matter of happenstance.\n\n\nThe remainder of the day was largely insignificant, although towards dusk L\u00e9on and I were able to forage for a handful of asphodelus, albeit not many. Once the sun had set and the moon had risen, we decided to set up camp and rest for what remained of this temperate night. The two of us were very anxious. Baal had made us question whether or not this quest was worth it. However, my brother believes it was merely a god-given trial, and a test of our will. While that is perhaps true, it is not my place to speak for our Lord. Regardless, whatever fate would await us back at Dijon if we were to abandon our quest from the king would be far worse than any fate that could befall us here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0FOURTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0FOURTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, 19th of April\n\n\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Our skirmish yesterday resulted in a restless night; and thus a lethargic morning. Despite this, we pressed forward, eager to complete our objective. The sky was overcast when the sun had risen and remained as such until late-evening. An hour or so after we set out once more, L\u00e9on asked me what I would do if I were to become immortal. In truth, I am unsure. I don't know if I would do anything. Of course I will be obligated to become immortal alongside my brother if he does so, but I do not know what I would do. I can only adventure with L\u00e9on for but so long. Am I perhaps cursing myself by completing this quest? Dooming myself to an extension of my already hollow, directionless life?\n\n\nAnything for my brother, I suppose.\n\n\nRegardless of my inner dialogue, I told him I would likely remain a scholar once my days exploring had concluded. He was elated to hear that I was willing to continue exploring with him. He told me that he sees many qualities of myself in him, even if they manifest in very different manners. Apparently, it would seem, he sees me as his \"better half\". I can't believe I would even consider denying an immortal life with him, to break his heart in such a manner. But I can't live forever. I cannot imagine such an existence. I just want him to be happy.\n\n\nWe encountered Peor again mid-day, just as we had the first time we met. I debated confronting him about whether or not he had sicced Baal on us in an attempt to thwart our efforts, but I remained steadfast. My brother, however, was not as inhibited. He asked him if he had told anybody about our quest. Peor said he would have no reason to, as we were working cooperatively, and that he wouldn't have ever had the opportunity to do so since he hasn't come across anybody he could've told. He asked why we would confront him so suddenly. I proceeded to inform him that we were attacked by a knight wielding occult magicks and a flaming bident who went under the alias of Baal. He sympathized with our plight, saying it was very brave to continue forward even after such an encounter. He informed us that he was yet to have such a occurrence happen to him, but that he would make sure he was prepared for anything in the future. He also inquired about the status of our asphodel foraging, to which we informed him that while we had managed to collect a few, we did not know if it would be enough. After we presented him with our bounty, he assured us that our amount would be adequate. With a lively smile and a wave, he departed once more.\n\n\nWhat happened for the rest of today was generally insignificant. We encountered several wild fowl and beasts, but we did not bother them and they did not bother us. Only one event of interest had occurred towards sunset.\n\n\n\"Fall.\"\n\n\nWe turned our heads to see none other than Baal approaching us, prepared to throw his bident at me. I was reflexive enough to dodge his weapon, however before it could hit the ground, he pulled it back into his hands via unseen means. There was no mistaking it, Baal had returned to life. Needless to say, L\u00e9on and I were dramatically unprepared for sudden combat, and were still in shock that a figure we had just slain had returned to life. But we had felled him once before, nothing was stopping us from doing it once more. For a time, he held the upper-hand, blocking ostensibly every assault we attempted to lay upon him. L\u00e9on moved behind him while I stood before him, attempting to perform a backstabbing maneuver while I distracted him. It was for naught though, as Baal swiftly turned around and plunged his weapon into my brothers right shoulder, causing him to fall back. In a moment of concentrated, bitter vengeance, I targeted an exposed spot in Baal's armor, piercing the side of his neck with my blade. He dropped his weapon in shock, and I furiously shoved him onto the dirt. Before he could collect himself, I grabbed L\u00e9ons axe and repeatedly slammed it upon his chest, swiftly breaking through the breastplate and chopping through his torso. In mere moments, we had slain him for the second time. I did not stop though. I kept slashing and chopping. Again and again. I was not to risk him returning to life for a third time.\n\n\nOnce I had finished, I quickly helped my brother off the ground and inspected the wound. It did not seem too deep, although it was evident he had suffered internal and external burns as a result. In a guilty panic, I rushed to tend to his wounds. Before I could, the realization dawned upon me that I had meaninglessly dulled my brothers blade by aimlessly attacking the corpse of Baal. I profusely apologized for my misdeeds, saying that I did not intend to dull his weapon and that it was my fault he got hurt, but he reassured me that I had done no wrong. He said he could very easily sharpen the blade later, and that his \"minor flesh wound\" was not my fault. I chose to respond with a shallow acknowledgement of what he said, as I did not want to hurt him by still claiming that it was my fault. After further inspection of the wound, it was clear it needed to be bandaged and cleaned. He was still able to move his arm to a degree, albeit painfully. Fortunately, I had the proper equipment to treat his wound in my pack, and spent the next few minutes tending to his injury. He thanked me for saving his life, saying that it was a very brave thing to do, and that he \"always knew I had the spirit of an adventurer inside of me\".\n\n\nWe decided to set up camp early tonight due to having to spar with Baal whilst we were already lethargic. L\u00e9on spent several minutes sharpening his blade before eventually falling asleep. I know I will have a restless sleep tonight. I can only help but fear our next encounter with Baal. I dread each day of this journey the more I think about it. L\u00e9on assures me we can handle it, but I doubt it. He could have perished because of me. I do not trust I will be able to save him if this happens for a third time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0FIFTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0FIFTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, 20th of April\n\n\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Just as I had expected, I slept utterly restlessly during the night. I could hardly remain idle while plagued with the fear of that daemon. L\u00e9on rested much better than myself, enthused by the idea that after today, we would be on our final day of the journey. The weather was horribly inclement throughout the day, raining until noon, in which it began storming. An hour or two after we continued west, we heard a voice exclaim from behind us.\n\n\n\"Cyril! L\u00e9on!\"\n\n\nAs embarrassing as it is, I was exceptionally startled by hearing somebody shout our names. I expected it to be Baal or some other individual with ill-intent. Fortunately, it was none other than Peor. He asked how our journey had gone since the last time we had met, commenting on how exhausted I appeared. We informed him of our second encounter with Baal and how he had returned to life. He seemed greatly concerned to learn of this. He said that if he had returned to life, he must be a daemon of some variety, just as I had hypothesized. Peor informed us that, if he is a daemon, that he can only be slain by his own weapon. This spurred discussion between me and L\u00e9on. We began strategizing ways to finally defeat Baal and lay him to rest. By the end of our discussion, we had planned to have L\u00e9on serve as a distraction while I fired at him with my firearm from a distance, which would provide L\u00e9on with an opportunity to steal his weapon and impale him. Once we had finished planning, Peor asked a simple request of us. He informed us that he had managed to collect every ingredient for the ritual, aside from the beak of a crow. He asked us to obtain it for him, assuming it was not too arduous of a task. We told him we would see what we could do. With that, he left us once more, wishing us safe travels.\n\n\nFor the next three and a half hours, we timidly grew closer and closer to our destination. I had not said it to my brother, but I had begun believing this quest was not worth it. If Baal is an inevitable foe no matter what we do, why must we do anything? Why not flee now? Regardless, I knew my brother would not accept such a fate, and I found solace in the guidance Peor had offered us. Thus, we continued on. Once three and a half hours had passed, we found ourselves located amidst an empty patch of field. As the rain poured from the clouds and thunder roared above, Baal manifested before us in a burst of flames. At that moment, I lost all cowardice and fear. Standing before him alongside my brother, I knew there was no stopping us. We had defeated him twice. Thrice should not be an issue.\n\n\nL\u00e9on began to attack Baal from all sides as I ran to a distance, preparing my matchlock. He launched constant assaults and ripostes against Baal. It was clear he had learned his tactics and adjusted well. He managed to hold him off long enough for me to take aim from a distance. As I raised my firearm in the direction of Baal, he swung his bident through the air, releasing a mote of flame that landed before my feet, causing me to misfire. The fire did not spread and had extinguished itself at a modest pace due to the weather conditions. Thankfully, L\u00e9on was able to land a blow with his axe directly upon the side of his head. Before Baal was allowed to retaliate, I dropped my matchlock and began sprinting towards him, blade drawn. L\u00e9on and I landed blow after blow on him, slicing and chopping through his armor over and over. He stood not a chance. Once he had been unable to stand, and his weapon lay by his side, I picked it up, and plunged it deep into his chest. Once he had been impaled with his own bident, he only remained long enough to leave us with his final words, before perishing.\n\n\n\"There is no escape\".\n\n\nAs Baal drew his last breath, L\u00e9on and I embraced in celebration. For a moment, I felt proud. Proud that L\u00e9on and I had defeated our sole opposition once and for all. We were destined for success. However this lone moment of joy was quick to fade as I became aware of what it meant to be destined for success. We were destined for immortality. I was destined for something I could never prepare for. Destined for what I can only see as a curse. I could never fathom breaking my brothers heart by denying it, though.\n\n\nInto oblivion I ride, I suppose.\n\n\nAfter we took a moment to celebrate our victory, L\u00e9on thought it to be a good idea to see the face of our foe. Thus, he doffed his helmet to see a wretched sight. Baal was no man. He was a daemon after all. His head was that of a goat with fur as dark as night, and pale horns as hollow as his gaze. L\u00e9on thought we should sever one of his horns to take a trophy; and to serve as a representation of our first daemon slain of what he hoped would be many. I took my blade to the base of his horn and severed it from his scalp, handing it to L\u00e9on.\n\n\nThe remainder of the day was generally unremarkable. The skies cleared up some time after dusk, and we spent half an hour hunting for crows, to which L\u00e9on was able to target one and collect its beak. At the time of writing, the sun set over the horizon approximately an hour ago, and L\u00e9on is far too excited to rest as of now. I, however, will be going to sleep the minute I have finished retelling the events of today. Our quest ends tomorrow.\n\n\nInto oblivion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[+\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0SIXTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n[-\u00a0HIDE\u00a0SIXTH\u00a0ENTRY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday, 21st of April\n\n\nIt has come.\n\n\nIt would appear as if L\u00e9on had taken it upon himself to personally read the entries I have written thus far concerning our quest while I was asleep. This, in turn, means he has ascertained my true feelings on immortality, and our mission at large. Initially, I expected rage at worst, and disappointment at best. However, he assured me he was not mad. He told me that if I do not want to become immortal alongside him, he's okay with that. He does not want to doom me to a life I do not want, even if it means he will eventually outlive me. He told me he wants nothing more than for me to be content with the path I have chosen.\n\n\nI told him that I appreciated his words, and that I would try and figure something out. Maybe I will choose to be granted immortality, or maybe our highness would not allow either of us to become immortal. Regardless, I would figure something out. He asked me what I meant by that. In truth, not even I know. All I know is that I will not allow my brother to be heartbroken by my own actions. I could never.\n\n\nThe day was largely uneventful. The weather was much less inclement than it had been the previous day, but it only took a few hours before we arrived at the river. We came upon Peor, donning a grey hooded cloak standing before some kind of improvised cauldron filled with water from the Erdre. He beckoned us and we approached him, L\u00e9on moving much faster than I. We informed him that we had collected a crows beak, just as he had asked, and informed him of the destruction of Baal. He seemed very pleased to hear of our recent success, and asked for us to place the asphodels in the water. I did as I was instructed, and L\u00e9on placed the beak in as well. Peor began to initiate the final steps, placing several items within the water that appeared utterly foreign and alien to me. In truth, they did not appear to be of this world by any means. Once he had placed everything within the cauldron, he looked back at us.\n\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, there is only one ingredient left. We need an offering of sacrificial blood.\"\n\n\nWe looked at him, startled for a moment. Then, we looked at each other. For a second, the thought of sacrificing my own brother flitted through my head, but I would never do such abhorrent acts. I could never. I would never. We looked back at him. We knew what he was attempting to do. But we are anything but common fools. We shouted, telling him he would not trick us into sacrificing the other. He stared back at us, absent-mindedly, eyes filled with more malice than should be possible. He chuckled to himself. He said it was a shame that he would have to take this matter into his own hands. L\u00e9on, as swiftly as ever, tackled Peor, bringing him to the ground. In so doing, he caused Peor's hood to slip off of his head, revealing a large scar on the side of his temple. A scar located precisely where I had severed the horn of Baal. L\u00e9ons efforts would only last for so long, however. With foul strength, Peor threw him several paces back, causing him to land on his back. Before I had the opportunity to react, he manifested his bident via unseen means, and threw it directly into my brother's stomach.\n\n\nI would not let this stand. Not at all. In a moment of bitter vengeance and hate, I grabbed Peor by his head, and began bashing it upon the side of the cauldron. I repeated this brutal motion over and over, until his crown had split open, allowing his blood to flow into the cauldron. I tossed his lifeless corpse aside as the blood diluted the water. At first, it began to smoke and steam. Then, it began to boil and bubble. After a few moments, it returned to a more ordinary state, remaining idle in the cauldron. I looked over at my brother, barely clinging to this mortal realm, begging to consume the potion of immortality. Without a second thought, I removed the polearm from his stomach, and moved him next to the cauldron. He lowered his head towards the blood, and began to consume it. The heat of the blood left burns on his mouth and throat as it went down, causing him great distress. But it was all to be worth it, as within mere seconds, the gash in his stomach had been completely healed.\n\n\nHowever his screaming did not cease.\n\n\nHe fell to the ground, writhing in pain, exclaiming that the boiling blood was pulsing through his body. He begged me to put him out of his misery. My own brother begged me to kill him. I looked upon a disaster of my own creation, a fate that befell my brother by my own hands. I knew I was only going to hurt him. Alas, in a moment of shock and despair, I raised my blade, and plunged it through his chest. Other than causing him pain, it seemed to do nothing, as seconds after I removed the blade, the wound had healed. I repeated my attempts at euthanasia, using my blade, his axe, and even the daemons bident. But it was for naught. It was all for not. I could not fix my own mistakes. Even after severing his head from his body, he simply healed from anything I could possibly inflict upon him. What hell had I wrought upon him?\n\n\nThe error of my ways. The consequences of my actions. My sins. They are manifest, and L\u00e9on must bear the torment. Why? Why him? Why not me? What could he ever have done to deserve this anguish? To be cursed with immortality? How could I do this to my own brother? After everything he's done for me, this is how I repay him. He cannot even bring himself to speak anymore he's in so much pain. Some hero I am.\n\n\nBut I can fix this. I know I can. I will find a cure. I will find a way to purge him of this curse. I will dedicate what remains of my life to doing so, if I must. It's the least I can do. The minute I am done writing this, I will head out once more to find a cure to my own wrought hell.\n\n\nIn the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, I pray I will have safe travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7437-B:\n Interview log with SCP-7437-A-1 upon recovery.

        "\"Infernal Gods, who rule the Shades below, Chaos and Phlegethon, ye Realms of Woe, Grant what I've heard I may to light expose, Secrets which Earth, and Night, and Hell inclose.\" \u2015 Aeneid, Book VI, lines 328\u2013331",
        "Wednesday, 16th of April In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Our majesty, King Louis, has tasked me and my elder brother to travel to the beyond lands of Greece, and seek out water from the mythical river Phlegethon. L\u00e9on, bless his heart, did not have previous knowledge of the river Phlegethon, nor its mystical ability to cure all unholy ailments, and prolong the existence of both body and spirit. Nevertheless, he was exceptionally emphatic about the task, as is befitting of him. This, precisely, is why our Majesty seeks it for himself. He has informed me and my brother that his maladies had only progressed further into ruin, and all he has attempted thus far has been for naught. Thus, due to our supposed \"greatness\", we have been tasked with obtaining water from the river Phlegethon, and delivering it upon him, so that his reign may continue for as long as our Lord intends. As is proper, L\u00e9on is particularly excited about this, and he is yet to truly stop his ramblings about his desire for both of us to become immortal alongside our highness. He hopes that we become nothing but the most renowned explorers across all of Europe. I, for one, know such a fate is not meant to befall us. Or rather me, at least. I only accompany my brother because being a famed explorer is but his deepest fantasy, and I dread to imagine discouraging him from pursuing it. Even so, I do not understand the point of obtaining immortality. Life in itself already harbors so little meaning, why would anybody choose to prolong it? But no matter, as long as L\u00e9on is content, and as long as I can reap some benefit from whatever spoils our majesty will grant us, I will journey nevertheless. Half an hour after dawn, we shall set our sights on Greece, and leave Dijon to wait for our return.",
        "Thursday, 17th of April In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. As I had planned, we left half an hour after the sun rose beyond the crest of the horizon. We traveled on foot, as we had prior arrangements to receive mobile carriages upon arriving at Pontailler-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. For our own safety, L\u00e9on wielded his axe, and I wielded my blade and matchlock. Fortunately, praise be to the lord, we did not encounter any quarrels during our travels today. When the sun had reached its zenith in the sky, we settled down for a moment to eat lunch. As we were doing so, a traveler approached us from the beaten path. I approximate the man being in his early forties. His hair was greying and shortly cropped, however his spirit was young, and his eyes carried great wisdom within them. He approached us, and greeted us with a warm smile. He asked if we were \"explorers such as himself\", or simply strangers passing through. I informed him that we were indeed strangers, however L\u00e9on would proceed to enthusiastically inform him that we were on a quest for King Louis to find the river Phlegethon in order to prolong his life, even going to the length of presenting the written document from our majesty himself. The stranger chuckled, and sat down next to us. He presented his own document from the king, saying that he was indeed on the same quest as us. For the next few moments, we engaged in delightfully intellectual banter about the mythos of the Greek people. It was evident he was a scholar of their esoteric beliefs. However, he informed us that he had no intention to travel to Greece, as that was simply far too costly for him. Rather, he said he knew of a ritual used by the Greeks to convert ordinary river water into that of the rivers of Hades. His intention was to travel to the Erdre and collect the water from it in order to use it in the ritual. I asked if we could accompany him to the Erdre river, to which he declared it would most certainly be unwise to do so, as our majesty must have separated us for a reason. However, he said we were more than welcome to assist him with his quest, and to rendezvous with him should the opportunity arise, assuming the Lord willed it such. He also advised us that we collect any asphodel flowers we may come across on our journey, as it will be a key ingredient in the ritual. L\u00e9on was initially resistant, believing that it was our god-given objective from King Louis to travel to Greece, however I reminded him that this could guarantee his desired status much faster than the alternative. Before we went our own separate ways, I asked for his name. \"Peor\", he said. Just as quickly as he arrived, he was gone. In other news, the weather was quite pleasant, and we could hear grouse and doves throughout the day. Our fire is dwindling and L\u00e9on has already begun his rest, so I suppose I shall stop here for the night. I am elated that we no longer have to travel all the way to Greece, though. I find solace in that, and I hope L\u00e9on does too.",
        "Friday, 18th of April In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Early in the morning we spotted some wild fowl, and the overcast clouds that must have formed while we were resting seem to have parted. Today has been particularly troublesome. Towards the middle of the day, we approached a nearby patch of woodland to the west of Dijon. After several minutes of traversing these woods, we came upon a clearing. In the center of this otherwise inconspicuous clearing was a freshly trimmed and tended-to chrysanthemum bush. Standing before the bush was a figure clad in the garb of a knight, wielding a bident which he had plunged into the ground, and donning a horned helmet reminiscent of a wild goat. Behind his visor radiated what could only be described as an intense and unholy energy. He stood before us and spoke in a dolorous, booming voice. \"Cease. There is nothing for you here, nor is there anything for you beyond my forest. I know what you seek. You seek an affront to nature itself. I cannot permit your quest to continue\". I must admit, I can only take somebody who dulls their weapon by placing it in the soil but so seriously, nevertheless I still wanted no quarrel with this man. I spoke to him, saying that there must be another way to go about this. I asked him for his name in an attempt to make friendly conversation with him. \"Baal\", he responded. He told both L\u00e9on and I to not bother telling him our names, as he had no intention for any further words to be shared. He raised his weapons, and we drew ours. As we prepared to defend ourselves from this interloper, the head of his polearm caught aflame, only further proving my theory that this is the work of some occult magicks. We battled fiercely, but he possessed much greater finesse than myself, and even L\u00e9on himself. He parried or dodged every slash of my blade and every swing of my brothers axe. L\u00e9on and I managed to avoid any grievous injuries, thank the Lord, but after several seconds, Baal bludgeoned me with the pommel of his bident, making direct contact with my face. I stumbled back, falling disorientated, leaving my brother to fend against him alone. He swiftly knocked L\u00e9on off of his feet and raised his weapon above his chest. I tried to grab ahold of the branches of the chrysanthemum bush, snapping it off, mysteriously causing Baal to reel back in pain, temporarily sparing my brother from harm. I snapped another, intentionally this time. Baal cringed in pain once more, loudly vocalizing as he did so. He looked back and fixed his gaze on me. As he approached me, I began to saw at the base of the bush, to which he reacted by falling to his knees in pain, roaring in agony. In some pitiful effort to thwart my efforts, he rose his bident; and prepared to throw it at me. However, before he could release it, I had fully severed the bush from its stem, causing him to completely collapse on the ground, lifeless. I had slain the daemon. I helped L\u00e9on off the ground and recollect himself. We studied the idle corpse for a few moments, before quickly fleeing. I did not think much of it at the time, but I do ponder how he knew of our quest. Who could have informed him? Could Peor have told him? Perhaps an enemy plotting against our majesty? I was uncertain, and truly, it was not my place to say. Nevertheless I couldn't help but speculate. Surely this was not a matter of happenstance. The remainder of the day was largely insignificant, although towards dusk L\u00e9on and I were able to forage for a handful of asphodelus, albeit not many. Once the sun had set and the moon had risen, we decided to set up camp and rest for what remained of this temperate night. The two of us were very anxious. Baal had made us question whether or not this quest was worth it. However, my brother believes it was merely a god-given trial, and a test of our will. While that is perhaps true, it is not my place to speak for our Lord. Regardless, whatever fate would await us back at Dijon if we were to abandon our quest from the king would be far worse than any fate that could befall us here.",
        "Saturday, 19th of April In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Our skirmish yesterday resulted in a restless night; and thus a lethargic morning. Despite this, we pressed forward, eager to complete our objective. The sky was overcast when the sun had risen and remained as such until late-evening. An hour or so after we set out once more, L\u00e9on asked me what I would do if I were to become immortal. In truth, I am unsure. I don't know if I would do anything. Of course I will be obligated to become immortal alongside my brother if he does so, but I do not know what I would do. I can only adventure with L\u00e9on for but so long. Am I perhaps cursing myself by completing this quest? Dooming myself to an extension of my already hollow, directionless life? Anything for my brother, I suppose. Regardless of my inner dialogue, I told him I would likely remain a scholar once my days exploring had concluded. He was elated to hear that I was willing to continue exploring with him. He told me that he sees many qualities of myself in him, even if they manifest in very different manners. Apparently, it would seem, he sees me as his \"better half\". I can't believe I would even consider denying an immortal life with him, to break his heart in such a manner. But I can't live forever. I cannot imagine such an existence. I just want him to be happy. We encountered Peor again mid-day, just as we had the first time we met. I debated confronting him about whether or not he had sicced Baal on us in an attempt to thwart our efforts, but I remained steadfast. My brother, however, was not as inhibited. He asked him if he had told anybody about our quest. Peor said he would have no reason to, as we were working cooperatively, and that he wouldn't have ever had the opportunity to do so since he hasn't come across anybody he could've told. He asked why we would confront him so suddenly. I proceeded to inform him that we were attacked by a knight wielding occult magicks and a flaming bident who went under the alias of Baal. He sympathized with our plight, saying it was very brave to continue forward even after such an encounter. He informed us that he was yet to have such a occurrence happen to him, but that he would make sure he was prepared for anything in the future. He also inquired about the status of our asphodel foraging, to which we informed him that while we had managed to collect a few, we did not know if it would be enough. After we presented him with our bounty, he assured us that our amount would be adequate. With a lively smile and a wave, he departed once more. What happened for the rest of today was generally insignificant. We encountered several wild fowl and beasts, but we did not bother them and they did not bother us. Only one event of interest had occurred towards sunset. \"Fall.\" We turned our heads to see none other than Baal approaching us, prepared to throw his bident at me. I was reflexive enough to dodge his weapon, however before it could hit the ground, he pulled it back into his hands via unseen means. There was no mistaking it, Baal had returned to life. Needless to say, L\u00e9on and I were dramatically unprepared for sudden combat, and were still in shock that a figure we had just slain had returned to life. But we had felled him once before, nothing was stopping us from doing it once more. For a time, he held the upper-hand, blocking ostensibly every assault we attempted to lay upon him. L\u00e9on moved behind him while I stood before him, attempting to perform a backstabbing maneuver while I distracted him. It was for naught though, as Baal swiftly turned around and plunged his weapon into my brothers right shoulder, causing him to fall back. In a moment of concentrated, bitter vengeance, I targeted an exposed spot in Baal's armor, piercing the side of his neck with my blade. He dropped his weapon in shock, and I furiously shoved him onto the dirt. Before he could collect himself, I grabbed L\u00e9ons axe and repeatedly slammed it upon his chest, swiftly breaking through the breastplate and chopping through his torso. In mere moments, we had slain him for the second time. I did not stop though. I kept slashing and chopping. Again and again. I was not to risk him returning to life for a third time. Once I had finished, I quickly helped my brother off the ground and inspected the wound. It did not seem too deep, although it was evident he had suffered internal and external burns as a result. In a guilty panic, I rushed to tend to his wounds. Before I could, the realization dawned upon me that I had meaninglessly dulled my brothers blade by aimlessly attacking the corpse of Baal. I profusely apologized for my misdeeds, saying that I did not intend to dull his weapon and that it was my fault he got hurt, but he reassured me that I had done no wrong. He said he could very easily sharpen the blade later, and that his \"minor flesh wound\" was not my fault. I chose to respond with a shallow acknowledgement of what he said, as I did not want to hurt him by still claiming that it was my fault. After further inspection of the wound, it was clear it needed to be bandaged and cleaned. He was still able to move his arm to a degree, albeit painfully. Fortunately, I had the proper equipment to treat his wound in my pack, and spent the next few minutes tending to his injury. He thanked me for saving his life, saying that it was a very brave thing to do, and that he \"always knew I had the spirit of an adventurer inside of me\". We decided to set up camp early tonight due to having to spar with Baal whilst we were already lethargic. L\u00e9on spent several minutes sharpening his blade before eventually falling asleep. I know I will have a restless sleep tonight. I can only help but fear our next encounter with Baal. I dread each day of this journey the more I think about it. L\u00e9on assures me we can handle it, but I doubt it. He could have perished because of me. I do not trust I will be able to save him if this happens for a third time.",
        "Sunday, 20th of April In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray we will have safe travels. Just as I had expected, I slept utterly restlessly during the night. I could hardly remain idle while plagued with the fear of that daemon. L\u00e9on rested much better than myself, enthused by the idea that after today, we would be on our final day of the journey. The weather was horribly inclement throughout the day, raining until noon, in which it began storming. An hour or two after we continued west, we heard a voice exclaim from behind us. \"Cyril! L\u00e9on!\" As embarrassing as it is, I was exceptionally startled by hearing somebody shout our names. I expected it to be Baal or some other individual with ill-intent. Fortunately, it was none other than Peor. He asked how our journey had gone since the last time we had met, commenting on how exhausted I appeared. We informed him of our second encounter with Baal and how he had returned to life. He seemed greatly concerned to learn of this. He said that if he had returned to life, he must be a daemon of some variety, just as I had hypothesized. Peor informed us that, if he is a daemon, that he can only be slain by his own weapon. This spurred discussion between me and L\u00e9on. We began strategizing ways to finally defeat Baal and lay him to rest. By the end of our discussion, we had planned to have L\u00e9on serve as a distraction while I fired at him with my firearm from a distance, which would provide L\u00e9on with an opportunity to steal his weapon and impale him. Once we had finished planning, Peor asked a simple request of us. He informed us that he had managed to collect every ingredient for the ritual, aside from the beak of a crow. He asked us to obtain it for him, assuming it was not too arduous of a task. We told him we would see what we could do. With that, he left us once more, wishing us safe travels. For the next three and a half hours, we timidly grew closer and closer to our destination. I had not said it to my brother, but I had begun believing this quest was not worth it. If Baal is an inevitable foe no matter what we do, why must we do anything? Why not flee now? Regardless, I knew my brother would not accept such a fate, and I found solace in the guidance Peor had offered us. Thus, we continued on. Once three and a half hours had passed, we found ourselves located amidst an empty patch of field. As the rain poured from the clouds and thunder roared above, Baal manifested before us in a burst of flames. At that moment, I lost all cowardice and fear. Standing before him alongside my brother, I knew there was no stopping us. We had defeated him twice. Thrice should not be an issue. L\u00e9on began to attack Baal from all sides as I ran to a distance, preparing my matchlock. He launched constant assaults and ripostes against Baal. It was clear he had learned his tactics and adjusted well. He managed to hold him off long enough for me to take aim from a distance. As I raised my firearm in the direction of Baal, he swung his bident through the air, releasing a mote of flame that landed before my feet, causing me to misfire. The fire did not spread and had extinguished itself at a modest pace due to the weather conditions. Thankfully, L\u00e9on was able to land a blow with his axe directly upon the side of his head. Before Baal was allowed to retaliate, I dropped my matchlock and began sprinting towards him, blade drawn. L\u00e9on and I landed blow after blow on him, slicing and chopping through his armor over and over. He stood not a chance. Once he had been unable to stand, and his weapon lay by his side, I picked it up, and plunged it deep into his chest. Once he had been impaled with his own bident, he only remained long enough to leave us with his final words, before perishing. \"There is no escape\". As Baal drew his last breath, L\u00e9on and I embraced in celebration. For a moment, I felt proud. Proud that L\u00e9on and I had defeated our sole opposition once and for all. We were destined for success. However this lone moment of joy was quick to fade as I became aware of what it meant to be destined for success. We were destined for immortality. I was destined for something I could never prepare for. Destined for what I can only see as a curse. I could never fathom breaking my brothers heart by denying it, though. Into oblivion I ride, I suppose. After we took a moment to celebrate our victory, L\u00e9on thought it to be a good idea to see the face of our foe. Thus, he doffed his helmet to see a wretched sight. Baal was no man. He was a daemon after all. His head was that of a goat with fur as dark as night, and pale horns as hollow as his gaze. L\u00e9on thought we should sever one of his horns to take a trophy; and to serve as a representation of our first daemon slain of what he hoped would be many. I took my blade to the base of his horn and severed it from his scalp, handing it to L\u00e9on. The remainder of the day was generally unremarkable. The skies cleared up some time after dusk, and we spent half an hour hunting for crows, to which L\u00e9on was able to target one and collect its beak. At the time of writing, the sun set over the horizon approximately an hour ago, and L\u00e9on is far too excited to rest as of now. I, however, will be going to sleep the minute I have finished retelling the events of today. Our quest ends tomorrow. Into oblivion.",
        "Monday, 21st of April It has come. It would appear as if L\u00e9on had taken it upon himself to personally read the entries I have written thus far concerning our quest while I was asleep. This, in turn, means he has ascertained my true feelings on immortality, and our mission at large. Initially, I expected rage at worst, and disappointment at best. However, he assured me he was not mad. He told me that if I do not want to become immortal alongside him, he's okay with that. He does not want to doom me to a life I do not want, even if it means he will eventually outlive me. He told me he wants nothing more than for me to be content with the path I have chosen. I told him that I appreciated his words, and that I would try and figure something out. Maybe I will choose to be granted immortality, or maybe our highness would not allow either of us to become immortal. Regardless, I would figure something out. He asked me what I meant by that. In truth, not even I know. All I know is that I will not allow my brother to be heartbroken by my own actions. I could never. The day was largely uneventful. The weather was much less inclement than it had been the previous day, but it only took a few hours before we arrived at the river. We came upon Peor, donning a grey hooded cloak standing before some kind of improvised cauldron filled with water from the Erdre. He beckoned us and we approached him, L\u00e9on moving much faster than I. We informed him that we had collected a crows beak, just as he had asked, and informed him of the destruction of Baal. He seemed very pleased to hear of our recent success, and asked for us to place the asphodels in the water. I did as I was instructed, and L\u00e9on placed the beak in as well. Peor began to initiate the final steps, placing several items within the water that appeared utterly foreign and alien to me. In truth, they did not appear to be of this world by any means. Once he had placed everything within the cauldron, he looked back at us. \"Now, gentlemen, there is only one ingredient left. We need an offering of sacrificial blood.\" We looked at him, startled for a moment. Then, we looked at each other. For a second, the thought of sacrificing my own brother flitted through my head, but I would never do such abhorrent acts. I could never. I would never. We looked back at him. We knew what he was attempting to do. But we are anything but common fools. We shouted, telling him he would not trick us into sacrificing the other. He stared back at us, absent-mindedly, eyes filled with more malice than should be possible. He chuckled to himself. He said it was a shame that he would have to take this matter into his own hands. L\u00e9on, as swiftly as ever, tackled Peor, bringing him to the ground. In so doing, he caused Peor's hood to slip off of his head, revealing a large scar on the side of his temple. A scar located precisely where I had severed the horn of Baal. L\u00e9ons efforts would only last for so long, however. With foul strength, Peor threw him several paces back, causing him to land on his back. Before I had the opportunity to react, he manifested his bident via unseen means, and threw it directly into my brother's stomach. I would not let this stand. Not at all. In a moment of bitter vengeance and hate, I grabbed Peor by his head, and began bashing it upon the side of the cauldron. I repeated this brutal motion over and over, until his crown had split open, allowing his blood to flow into the cauldron. I tossed his lifeless corpse aside as the blood diluted the water. At first, it began to smoke and steam. Then, it began to boil and bubble. After a few moments, it returned to a more ordinary state, remaining idle in the cauldron. I looked over at my brother, barely clinging to this mortal realm, begging to consume the potion of immortality. Without a second thought, I removed the polearm from his stomach, and moved him next to the cauldron. He lowered his head towards the blood, and began to consume it. The heat of the blood left burns on his mouth and throat as it went down, causing him great distress. But it was all to be worth it, as within mere seconds, the gash in his stomach had been completely healed. However his screaming did not cease. He fell to the ground, writhing in pain, exclaiming that the boiling blood was pulsing through his body. He begged me to put him out of his misery. My own brother begged me to kill him. I looked upon a disaster of my own creation, a fate that befell my brother by my own hands. I knew I was only going to hurt him. Alas, in a moment of shock and despair, I raised my blade, and plunged it through his chest. Other than causing him pain, it seemed to do nothing, as seconds after I removed the blade, the wound had healed. I repeated my attempts at euthanasia, using my blade, his axe, and even the daemons bident. But it was for naught. It was all for not. I could not fix my own mistakes. Even after severing his head from his body, he simply healed from anything I could possibly inflict upon him. What hell had I wrought upon him? The error of my ways. The consequences of my actions. My sins. They are manifest, and L\u00e9on must bear the torment. Why? Why him? Why not me? What could he ever have done to deserve this anguish? To be cursed with immortality? How could I do this to my own brother? After everything he's done for me, this is how I repay him. He cannot even bring himself to speak anymore he's in so much pain. Some hero I am. But I can fix this. I know I can. I will find a cure. I will find a way to purge him of this curse. I will dedicate what remains of my life to doing so, if I must. It's the least I can do. The minute I am done writing this, I will head out once more to find a cure to my own wrought hell. In the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, I pray I will have safe travels.",
