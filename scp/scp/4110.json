Standard product retrieval protocols, including Cover Story C (Carcinogenic Materials) are to be used. All SCP-4110-1 instances are to be contained in the low-priority lockers of Site-23. Usage of SCP-4110-1 are only allowed with permission of project head.\n\n\nMTF Kappa-15 (\u201cFun Police\u201d) is tasked with recalls of many toy-based anomalous products, including SCP-4110-1 instances. For more information, consult standard Romagnoli-Bitler Wondertainment Suppression Protocol\n1\n. Kappa-7 agents should be embedded in all regional offices of the affected store chains and monitor products in all stores in their region during the month of October. The Foundation legal department is to prevent affected retail chains from closure or bankruptcy, as those scenarios aggravate the anomaly (see Addendum 4110-1).\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4110 is a phenomenon affecting party costume retail chains Party City, \nToys 'R Us\n, and Spirit Halloween, on the last two weeks of October annually. Costumes (referred to as instances of SCP-4110-1) designed for children, aged 3-18, will anomalously appear in random stores of the affected retail chains in North America. The anomaly appears more frequently in cities that have a fan convention of any kind, during the time that SCP-4110 is active. All costumes are of average commercial quality, and made out of nonanomalous products. At least six variants of SCP-4110 have been confirmed, as of writing.\n\n\nAll SCP-4110-1 instances affect the perception of humans observing SCP-4110-1 users (SCP-4110-2) in different ways, depending on the variant of SCP-4110-1. Costumes like \u201cThe Inconspicuous Investigator\u201d or \u201cLizar the Terrible\u201d affect visual perception of observers of SCP-4110-2, while costumes like \u201cWilford the Werewolf\u201d and \"The Automaton\" affect perception of sounds created by SCP-4110-2. The anomaly will only activate when wearing the entire \"set\" that comprises a SCP-4110-1 instance. Wearing different components from different variants does not produce an anomalous effect, nor do different components from different instances of the same variant. Despite age restrictions labeled on the packaging, anyone can wear a SCP-4110-1 instance as long as they can fit into the costume. All SCP-4110-1 instances bear manufacturing tags and packaging stickers from Wondertainment, along with another company called \"Societ\u00e9 du Costume Paranormal\n2\n.\"\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0List\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-4110-1\u00a0variants\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCostume Name and Classification\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Surgical Stork\" SCP-4110-1a\n\n\nThe costume is comprised of a black hooded cloak, a traditional plague doctor's mask, and a doctor\u2019s bag. The doctor's bag contains an assortment of toy medical equipment, such as a stethoscope, rubber hammer, and plastic syringes. The plague doctor mask is made from plastic, with mesh eyeholes. During testing, subjects reported that nearby personnel looked sick, with cartoonish thermometers in their mouths, and hot water bottles on their heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lizar the Terrible\" SCP-4110-1b\n\n\nThe costume is an inflatable \nTyrannosaurus rex\n costume made from polyester, with a square translucent plastic square in its throat for wearers to see out of. A speaker is lodged in the \u201cthroat\u201d of the costume and can be activated via a button on the inside of the left hand of the costume. When the button is pressed, a noise highly similar to that produced by \nCarnotaurus sastrei\n is emitted\n3\n. The sound is of much higher quality than the type of speaker should allow. When the costume is worn, observers will perceive that SCP-4110-2 is a Carnotaurus. This effect occurs even when in spaces where a Carnotaurus could not logically fit, with the space appearing to expand to accommodate the size of the Carnotaurus. Double-blind test subjects unaware of SCP-4110-2 also see the spatial distortion. The cognitohazard only affects vision, so if the subject speaks, a human voice will appear to originate from the Carnotaurus's mouth. The anomaly does not affect photographs or videos. The costume is highly resistant to puncture or slicing, despite being made from plastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Inconspicuous Investigator\" SCP-4110-1c\n\n\nThe costume is a package consisting a brown trenchcoat, gloves, a magnifying glass, and a fedora. When all of the items are worn, the subject is imperceptible to the observer, essentially making the subject's body invisible. The effect extends to photographs, security footage, and heat sensors. The costume itself is still visible while being worn, so use for espionage is extremely limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wilford the Werewolf\" SCP-4110-1d\n\n\nThe costume is comprised of a plastic werewolf mask, ripped flannel jacket, and distressed jeans. When worn, all vocalizations made by SCP-4110-2 will sound like vocalizations made by \nCanis lupus\n to observers, and change depending on the tone and inflection of the subject (barking while talking without inflection, howling when talking loudly, growling when using a threatening tone).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Automaton\" and \"The Automatonette\" SCP-4110-1e\n\n\nThe costume is comprised of a cubical aluminum head with an antenna protruding out of the top of the head, what appears to be modified dryer ducting, and an aluminum chestplate with LEDs that randomly turn on and off without a power source. The costume is available in two genders, with the female costume adding a conical \"skirt\" around its waist. When worn, observers report the subject's footsteps always sound like \"heavy metal slammed onto concrete.\" Subjects have also been reported to emit sounds of servos and gears when joints are moved. When subjects speak, their voices are modulated to sound metallic and robotic, with observers drawing comparisons to the Daleks from the British television show \"Doctor Who.\" Scales measuring the subject report a weight approximately \u2588 times as heavy as the subject's actual weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pharaoh De-Kamposin\" SCP-4110-1f\n\n\nThe costume is comprised of a 4 meter long roll of linen bandages. Instructions that come with the costume instruct the buyer how to wrap the bandages around themselves, suggesting to use a partner to help. When the bandages are completely wrapped around the body, the cognitohazardous effect manifests. Observers will perceive the subject as a mobile decomposing body wrapped in bandages, which looks and smells identical to a rotting corpse. The details of the rotting body are different for each subject, but constants include: maggots or other insects in the body, sections of missing skin or muscle, exposed bones or organs, and patches of hair fallen out. If an observer inserts an object into a wound they perceive to be real, the subject will perceive the object to \"phase\" through their body, and not injuring them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that is found with each purchase of a SCP-4110-1 instance:\n\n\n\n\nHOLY MACKEREL!

They were quickly apprehended by Kappa-7 to be interviewed and administered amnestics.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDoctor Dower:\n State your names and ages for the record please.\n\n\nDavid:\n Uh\u2026 my name is David \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I'm 17 years old.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer:\n \n<speaking quietly>\n My name is Jennifer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and I'm 17 years old, too. Are we in trouble?\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Dower:\n No, you're not. I'm with the World Health Organization, and you bought costumes known for containing carcinogenic material. We just want to apprehend the people who thought it would be a good idea to put that stuff in children's costumes. Can please tell me where and why you two bought the costumes?\n\n\n\n\nDavid:\n \n<glances at Jennifer>\n Well, uh\u2026 me and Jennifer were going to go to a party at my friend Matt's house, alright?\n\n\n\n\nDD:\n Right\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDavid:\n But since it's near Halloween, everyone was supposed to bring costumes and shi\u2014 stuff, so me and Jen went down to that Party City place, y'know the one down near the intersection of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\n\n\nDD:\n I know of it, yes.\n\n\n\n\nDavid:\n \n<starts talking faster and with more enthusiasm>\n And we found these really cool robot costumes, they look all old-fashioned and square and stuff, and it came in both girl and boy, so we were like \"sweet!\" and we bought them, we were so pumped for the party and how great they were, but man they were really heavy. So we buy them, go to my house, put them on, and the weirdest thing happened. Every time we moved, we sounded like a car with a bad transmission, and when Jen talked, she sounded like a fuckin' Dalek from Doctor Who. \n<David pauses to take a deep breath>\n\n\n\n\nDD:\n Do you need a drink of water or anything?\n\n\nDavid:\n Nah I'm fine. Anyhow, we just figured the voice and sounds were being made with a voice-modifier-thingy, whatever they're called. So we take those pictures, post them, and get ready to get in the car. But when we went out on the porch, the damn thing collapsed on us! So we figured we should just stay home, since the costumes were all dented up after that, and Jen felt like she had a headache, didn't you Jen? \n<Jennifer nods in agreement>\n\n\nDD:\n \n<looking at Jennifer>\n Does he always talk like this?\n\n\nJennifer:\n \n<smiling>\n All the time.\n\n\nDD:\n Anyways, what happened after that?\n\n\nDavid:\n Well Jen stayed over at my house for the night for homework, because y'know we have school on Monday, but then in the morning, fuckin' SWAT breaks down our door, and here we are.\n\n\nDD:\n Is this all true Jennifer?\n\n\nJennifer:\n \n<speaking quietly>\n Yes.\n\n\nDD:\n Well, thank you for your cooperation, both of you. It will help immensely with the investigation.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n The SCP-4110-1 instances were seized, and Class A amnestics were administered to David and Jennifer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4110 was originally reported in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Minnesota on October 28, 199\u2588, after several dozen civilians called the police department, panicked about \"a goddamn dinosaur rampaging around my neighborhood.\" MTF Epsilon-6 \"Village Idiots\" were deployed, but shortly discovered that the dinosaur was a 8-year old boy in an inflatable dinosaur costume.\n\n\nAddendum 4110-1:\n After Toys 'R Us declared bankruptcy, additional instances of SCP-4110-1 have been observed in other stores belonging to the Party City retail chain, and other previously unaffected retail chains, primarily in Australia. The Foundation purchased the Toys 'R Us franchise for $1.2 billion USD, reopening many of its stores. SCP-4110 has since ceased to appear in previously unaffected store fronts, and remains contained.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Romagnoli-Bitler Wondertainment Suppression Protocol:\n\n\u2022 Foundation webcrawler program \nparty_crasher\n is to regularly scan the internet for Wondertainment-related phrases.\n\n\u2022 If keywords are found, the website where the word is discovered is to be scanned for any suspicious anomalous activity or People-of-Interest. Information is to be given to the nearest available Department of Analytics analyst for vetting.\n\n\u2022 If anomalous activity or People-of-Interest are discovered and vetted, keywords are to be scrubbed from the website, and location of activity or POI is to be pinpointed. Nature of anomalous activity is to be discovered at this time (If anomaly is not registered in the SCP database, information is to be given to the Head of Department of Analytics for further instruction).\n\n\u2022 When activity is pinpointed and a location is triangulated, MTF Kappa-7 \u201cFun Police\u201d is to be deployed to confiscate and/or capture anomalous objects/POI for study/interrogation.\n\n\u2022 If POI is a nonanomalous bystander, interview and administer Class-A Amnestics and release. If found to be an accomplice to known POIs, the person is to be kept for further interrogation.\n\n\n2\n. \u201cSociet\u00e9 du Costume Paranormal,\u201d has a listed headquarters in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Normandy, France on each package. No specific address is listed. No company named Societ\u00e9 du Costume Paranormal exists, and no factory or offices associated with that name has been found. It is presumably a front company for the Wondertainment brand. The name is most likely a parody of the Foundation's use of the abbreviation \"SCP\" on the majority of its front companies\n\n\n3\n.

David: <starts talking faster and with more enthusiasm> And we found these really cool robot costumes, they look all old-fashioned and square and stuff, and it came in both girl and boy, so we were like \"sweet!\" and we bought them, we were so pumped for the party and how great they were, but man they were really heavy. So we buy them, go to my house, put them on, and the weirdest thing happened. Every time we moved, we sounded like a car with a bad transmission, and when Jen talked, she sounded like a fuckin' Dalek from Doctor Who. <David pauses to take a deep breath> DD: Do you need a drink of water or anything? David: Nah I'm fine. Anyhow, we just figured the voice and sounds were being made with a voice-modifier-thingy, whatever they're called. So we take those pictures, post them, and get ready to get in the car. But when we went out on the porch, the damn thing collapsed on us! So we figured we should just stay home, since the costumes were all dented up after that, and Jen felt like she had a headache, didn't you Jen? <Jennifer nods in agreement> DD: <looking at Jennifer> Does he always talk like this? Jennifer: <smiling> All the time. DD: Anyways, what happened after that? David: Well Jen stayed over at my house for the night for homework, because y'know we have school on Monday, but then in the morning, fuckin' SWAT breaks down our door, and here we are. DD: Is this all true Jennifer? Jennifer: <speaking quietly> Yes. DD: Well, thank you for your cooperation, both of you. It will help immensely with the investigation. <End Log> Closing Statement: The SCP-4110-1 instances were seized, and Class A amnestics were administered to David and Jennifer."

    "description": "SCP-4110 is a phenomenon affecting party costume retail chains Party City, Toys 'R Us, and Spirit Halloween, on the last two weeks of October annually. Costumes (referred to as instances of SCP-4110-1) designed for children, aged 3-18, will anomalously appear in random stores of the affected retail chains in North America. The anomaly appears more frequently in cities that have a fan convention of any kind, during the time that SCP-4110 is active. All costumes are of average commercial quality, and made out of nonanomalous products. At least six variants of SCP-4110 have been confirmed, as of writing.",
