During the ongoing containment crisis, operatives are not to confront SCP-7606 but instead should suppress information outflow, and limit damages to the city of origin which is to be considered lost. Should SCP-7606 breach city limits, Veil Protocols are to be dissolved and preparations for a HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario are to be enacted immediately after.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7606 is a hostile Deific entity with the following known abilities\n1\n:\n\n\n\n\nExtensive knowledge of thaumaturgic rituals beyond human limitations.\n\n\nUnmatched physical combat prowess with knowledge of several ancient martial arts, along with the ability to manifest any weapon of its choosing.\n\n\nThe conceptual linking, and therefore complete control over the concepts of fire, darkness, and death.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7606 manifested in baseline reality on 27/07/2022 at 09:44 CDT and the following speech was broadcasted telepathically to all sentient beings within 5km of the initial manifestation:\n\n\n\n\nHARK\n INSECTS, HEED MY WORDS;\n\n\nMY NAME IS CONQUEST,\n\n\nMY NAME IS DESOLATION,\n\n\nMY NAME IS DAV\u2019VAHID MAEKALAH STRYGWYR.\n\n\nTHOU HAST FESTERED WITHIN MY DOMAIN LONG ENOUGH.\n\n\nFOR TIME UNBEKNOWNST TO MAN I HAVE LAID IN SLUMBER;\n\n\nI AWAKEN ONCE AGAIN TO FIND \nPARASITES\n SULLYING THE LAND ONCE CALLED MINE.\n\n\nLAY DOWN THINE ARMS AND THOU DEATHS SHALL BE SWIFT.\n\n\nSUBMIT YE SERVICE AND THOU LIVES SHALL BE FILLED WITH PURPOSE ANEW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, no measure at the Foundation's current disposal is deemed effective in counteracting SCP-7606. Researchers from every relevant department have been activated to continue to find a possible weakness of SCP-7606 or methods to return it to its plane of origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURGENT\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0SCP-7606\u00a0caa\u00a027/07/2022\u00a011:55\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0close-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne hour following the urgent activation of all Foundation resources, Foundation agents had a brief encounter with SCP-7606.

The guys there dipped when they saw 7606 and I don't know what happened to the rest.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Yeah?\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Yeah.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n So it's coming here next?\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Yup.\n\n\nSilence on the recording.\n\n\nAgent Davis sighs.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Penny for your thoughts?\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Fuck me, man\u2026\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Yup.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n I mean, at least the civilians are out.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n \n(Nods)\n Just us over here.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Just us suckers out here.

Why'd it have to be here of all fucking places FUCK!\n\n\nGARRISON:\n I mean, of all places why not Florida?\n\n\nDAVIS:\n \ntch\n Fair enough. What's up with you? Why are you so calm?\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Called my girlfriend earlier. Massive breach in security but who cares. Got some closure and felt like a badass.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Huh. That does sound nice.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Besides, you wanna spend the last hour of your life stressing?\n\n\nDAVIS:\n That\u2026 is very true.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Speaking of breaches in protocol\u2026\n\n\nAgent Garrison opens his ammo pouch and reveals two miniature bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Hah! Jesus Christ Trev, you are the smartest man on planet earth!\n\n\nAgent Garrison hands one bottle to Agent Davis.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n To the end of the world?\n\n\nDAVIS:\n To the motherfucker that's making it worth my while.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n \n(scoffs)\n Cheers Ray.\n\n\nThe two agents finish their drinks before looking down the street.\n\n\nSCP-7606 is seen in the distance.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n Holy Jesus Christ what the fuck.\n\n\nAlarms are sounded and all combatants scramble to their position and take aim at SCP-7606. SCP-7606 continues to advance for several seconds and begins to close the distance between it and the blockade.\n\n\nPanicked screams can be heard off camera and several soldiers flee from the blockade. The rest, including Agent Garrison drop their rifles and begin to hyperventilate.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n Oh fuck we're gonna die.\n\n\nDAVIS:\n At least we're not dying sober.\n\n\nGARRISON:\n I guess so\u2026 Good thing the civilians are out and we-\n\n\nAn elderly Caucasian man later identified as Gary Stevenson wearing only undergarments exits from a nearby apartment building.\n\n\nSTEVENSON:\n WHAT FUCKING GAY-ASS MONKEY-FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT IS GOING ON OUTSIDE MY GODDAMN WINDOW?!\n\n\nThe civilian is incredibly intoxicated.\n\n\nSTEVENSON:\n I'M TRYING TO GET SOME GODDAMN SHUTEYE!\n\n\nThe civilian notices SCP-7606 for the first time\n\n\nSTEVENSON:\n WHAT IN SAM HELL?!\n\n\nHe retrieves a Ruger LCR Revolver from within his underwear and shoots SCP-7606 three times, killing it instantly.\n\n\nSilence on recording.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURGENT\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0SCP-7606\u00a0caa\u00a027/07/2022\u00a012:42\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0close-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7606 shot dead in the streets of Miami, Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nSCP-7606 is David Micheal Smith, a 22-year-old Thaumaturgist. Smith had enacted a ritual that places a memetic effect on anyone viewing or referring to the caster. This effect causes anyone to believe that the caster is an extremely powerful deific entity of demonic origin that is unable to be defeated unless the viewer has taken advanced medication or counter-measures for memetic influences.\n\n\nEvidently, this effect was not strong enough to overcome the instant human fight-or-flight reaction while under the heavy influence of hallucinogenic drugs.\n\n\nSCP-7606's change of designation to neutralised is pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
