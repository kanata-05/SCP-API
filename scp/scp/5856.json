This has always been your name.\n\n\nYou will now read the following document in its entirety. Press any key to continue.\n\n\n~$: \na\n\n\nLoading file\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5856\n\n\nAnomaly Class:\n \nRobertson-Jackal\n\n\nThreat Level:\n \nSaddlebrown \n\u25cf\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5856 is currently contained by the combined efforts of Containment Team CT-5856 (\"\nUnfettered Mares\n\"), of which you are the newest member. You find this normal. It is contained within Containment Complex 5856, which consists of the following main components:\n\n\n\n\nR5856/1: \nThe boardroom\n. This is the room within which SCP-5856 is contained. It is outfitted with decor and furniture in a style which is considered by some to be socially normal. You find the style to be \na tad gaudy\n. For \nreligious reasons\n, it is located at the centre of the complex, with barred windows to all other rooms and a balcony overlooking \nwashroom #4\n.\n\n\nR5856/2: \nThe scullery\n. The purpose of this room is \nknown to every person except yourself\n.\n\n\nR5856/3: \nDesmond's bedroom\n. This is the room within which \nDesmond sleeps\n. You must never enter this room unless \nDesmond contacts you via telegram\n. The room houses a variety of \nOriental mannequins\n and \nscented candles\n. The former of these is considered normal to you. You have never witnessed the latter before, and find the concept scary and bewildering. The possession of one or more of the latter objects is \npunishable by death in your homeland\n. You will never meet the occupant of this room, as they are currently \non an expedition to Peru\n \u2014 an event to which you were initially invited, but rejected from at the last moment.\n\n\nR5856/4: \nBulwark Street Station\n. This is a shared common area, where you may mingle with the other members of CT-5856. It is outfitted with a \ncoal scuttle\n and \ntanning salon\n. There are complimentary supplies of \npowdered milk\n, your favourite food. You dislike others eating your favourite food, and \noften make this known\n.\n\n\nR5856/5: \nThe parlour\n. This is your private residence, and decorated in a way you find entirely normal and appealing. \nOne\n of the other members of CT-5856 find(s) your decor to be \nin poor taste\n, while \ntwo\n others feel it is mildly \nblasphemous\n. You care about the opinions of at least two of these people.\n\n\n\n\nR5856/6 through 12 are the private residences of the other members of CT-5856, whom you are \neager to meet\n. There are also numerous supplementary rooms and installations throughout the complex, the functions of which will likely become clear. The exception to this is \nthe menagerie\n, which has been locked. You wish very much to gain entry, and know that another member of the containment team has the key.\n\n\nAt the end of your week-long stay in \nthe parlour\n, you will be amnesticised. This is morally and ethically acceptable to you. You may then be administered another course of hypnotic suggestives, re-educated regarding social norms, and reintroduced to an altered version of the complex, alongside multiple people who you may or may not have met before. This is also morally and ethically acceptable to you.\n\n\nCurrently, the only members of CT-5856 who you have pre-formed opinions of are:\n\n\n\n\nLangley deBaucher\n, whom you \ndespise\n due to \nyour differences in opinion regarding dogs\n.\n\n\nViscount Charles\n, whom you \nregard ambivalently\n due to \nunspoken sexual tension\n.\n\n\nZachary F. Callahan\n, whom you \nwish to marry\n due to \nher fabulous antique eggs\n.\n\n\n\n\nOf those you haven't yet formed opinions of, \nexactly three\n have already formed opinions of you.\n\n\nIn order to contain SCP-5856, you must attempt to \nbefriend Dr. Leopold Franc-Polio\n and \nset Langley deBaucher up with a romantic partner\n. Do not let \nLi Richter\n reveal that you are secretly \nracist\n. Avoid all contact with \nthe complex's several-hundred gargoyles\n and deduce the \nblood type\n of every person more popular than yourself.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5856 is a sociokinetic and tele-empathic humanoid entity, kept in a state of permanent disorientation within \nthe boardroom\n. It is capable of manipulating any and all coherent social bonds with entities who know of its existence in any form, which renders it incredibly dangerous and nigh-uncontainable in normal situations. In casual conversation, SCP-5856 may be referred to by you as \nthe secret George\n. You find this normal. It will remain a non-threat so long as the Special Containment Procedures above are upheld.\n\n\nThe SCP Foundation thanks you for your part in these procedures. Please now return to your quarters. The remainder of CT-5856 will join you for dinner at \n1800 hours\n. Your \nceremonial sceptre\n and \nAuckland 2004 Yellow Pages telephone directory\n will arrive shortly. They are familiar items to you, and your first instinct regarding their use is entirely correct.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of file.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5855\n | SCP-5856 | \nSCP-5857\n \u00bb",
