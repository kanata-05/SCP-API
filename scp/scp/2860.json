In addition to standard furnishings, the contents of SCP-2860\u2019s former office have been moved into its cell. Medical assistance is to be provided upon request and psychological health screenings are to be performed every two weeks. Prior to any interaction with living organic material, SCP-2860 is to be required to wear specially treated leather gloves so as to limit risk of accidental exposure of personnel to SCP-2860\u2019s effect.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Update\u00a006/10/2015\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Update\u00a006/10/2015\n\n\n\n\nUpdate (06/10/2015):\n Due to increased sensitivity of SCP-2860\u2019s effect to include the entirety of the object\u2019s body, SCP-2860 and the contents of its cell have been moved to a sealed humanoid containment cell with an independent filtration system. Prior to any interaction or transport, SCP-2860 is to be required to wear a modified isolation suit so as to prevent any further exposure of personnel to SCP-2860\u2019s effect. This isolation suit is to be replaced after each individual use. Due to the increased risk of performing psychological health screenings, such screenings have been reduced to once per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Update\u00a007/11/2016\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Update\u00a007/11/2016\n\n\n\n\nUpdate (07/11/2016):\n Due to increased sensitivity of SCP-2860\u2019s effect to include any hair shed by the object, SCP-2860\u2019s cell is to be cleaned of any particulates shed by SCP-2860 every two weeks by personnel equipped with Class-B hazmat suits. Hair collected in this matter is to be incinerated on-site. On a daily basis, SCP-2860 is to be moved to a specialized decontamination chamber for removal of any transformed skin cells. Psychological health screenings are to be performed via teleconference on a weekly basis to monitor SCP-2860\u2019s declining mental state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Update\u00a015/11/2017\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Update\u00a015/11/2017\n\n\n\n\nUpdate (15/11/2017):\n Due to SCP-2860\u2019s declining mental state and increasingly frequent attempts at suicide, the subject has been placed in a medically induced coma \naccording to the guidelines set by the Palmer Protocol\n. Personnel equipped with Class-B hazmat suits are to remove all transformed skin cells from the subject on a daily basis. Hair samples are to be collected from SCP-2860 for continued testing of the object\u2019s effect on an as needed basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2860 is the former Dr. Harold Thompson, a 46-year-old, Caucasian male. Prior to containment, SCP-2860 served a total of ten years as a Level 2 Researcher of Site-19\u2019s Experimental SCP Object Cataloging Lab. During this initial time period, SCP-2860 did not display any anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-2860\u2019s effect manifests when any living organic material comes into direct physical contact with its hands. Any such contact results in the near\u2013instantaneous transformation of the organic material into solid marble. Analysis of material transformed in this fashion shows that materials covering the tested material, or inorganic components of the material (osseous tissue, etc.) are not affected by SCP-2860\u2019s effect. Use of high-speed photography has indicated that each transformation event doesn\u2019t occur completely at once, but rather radiates from the point of contact. Testing to determine exactly how this transformation process begins, or is maintained is currently ongoing.\n\n\nThe degree of sensitivity of this ability seems to extend down to a microscopic level, as individual microscopic organisms present on SCP-2860\u2019s skin undergo transformation upon exposure. This results in a very fine marble powder forming on SCP-2860\u2019s ungloved hands after a few seconds of exposure.\n\n\nTesting of SCP-2860\u2019s effect has shown that the marble produced matches the composition of marbles found in a variety of geographic regions including:\n\n\n\u2022 Yule (US)\n\n\u2022 Purbeck (UK)\n\n\u2022 Makrana (India)\n\n\u2022 Carrara (Italy)\n\n\u2022 Pentelic (Greece)\n\n\nAs of the time of writing, no two subsequent uses of SCP-2860\u2019s effect have produced the same composition of marble.\n\n\nSCP-2860\u2019s effect first manifested on 17-10-2004, following accidental exposure of SCP-2860 to a particulate released from an experimental anomalous object acquired from a raid on an anart studio near Portland, OR. This object was a hollow steel rod with a brass tip that had the same effect as SCP-2860. The rod was engraved with \u201c# 5\u201d on its side. Exactly how SCP-2860 effected the release of the particulate from the rod, or what its exact composition was, is currently unknown due to its immediate disappearance after release. The rod lost its anomalous effects upon release of the particulate. Investigation as to whether more instances of this object are currently at large is ongoing. Dr. Thompson has since been considered KIA and his family has been provided the standard bereavement package in addition to Cover-Story #31 (Lab Accident). Updated photographs of SCP-2860\u2019s former wife and son have been provided on a yearly basis to help deter any mental decline.\n\n\nAddendum: 2860-1: Interview Log 2860-1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following interview was conducted following SCP-2860\u2019s initial containment.\n\n\nInterviewed: SCP-2860\n\n\nInterviewer: Dr. Freemont\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was done following an initial screening of SCP-2860\u2019s anomalous properties.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n Good afternoon, Harold.\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n Afternoon Melissa.

I don\u2019t think I have any control of it. It just\u2026 happens.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n Do you feel anything?\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n I do. It\u2019s kind of like the feeling of a small static discharge. Each time the effect happens, it goes off. It's\u2026 rather uncomfortable.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n Interesting, and you say this happens every time?\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n Yeah. Every time\u2026\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: 2860-2: Interview Log 2860-2\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following interview was conducted as part of a standard mental health screening on 10/11/2006.\n\n\nInterviewed: SCP-2860\n\n\nInterviewer: Dr. Freemont\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was done at the end of a standard mental health screening. During the testing sessions prior to this screening, SCP-2860 requested to keep several of the items transformed for its own personal use.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n One more thing before we are finished for the evening, Harold.\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n Go for it.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n During the last few testing sessions, you requested to keep a few of the items you transformed into marble. Now, a few of the higher ups have considered granting this request, but first you need to tell us why you would like them.\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n [\nChuckles\n] Well, yeah\u2026 Its kind of funny. You\u2019d think I\u2019d want to keep them as far away from me as possible. I mean, here I am, having done something incredibly terrible, turning some poor bird or butterfly to stone, and yet, when I look at some of these things, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 get lost in them. Some of them are so beautiful, like a moment that I trapped in time. I guess this is what some artists must feel after they finish a painting.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n So what are you going to do with them?\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n Probably just keep them on my desk or something. Look at them every now and then. Especially the sparrow. That one really gets to me\u2026 Maybe they will help me feel a little less lonely sometimes.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n Pardon?\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n You\u2019ve worked for the Foundation as long as I have, Melissa, so I bet you\u2019ve probably had this thought every now and then. You know, \"What if that was me?\" You think about it when you hear about some new humanoid they contained at \nSite-64\n, or some new reality bender they have at \nSite-81\n, or when you bump into Bright, or that time guy out at Site-17. You think \u201cWhat if I had that ability?\u201d or \u201cWhat if that happened to me?\u201d or \u201cWhat would I do if I could turn bullets into sand?\u201d You always think about \u201cWhat would I do if I had that kind of power?\u201d But I bet you never stopped to think about how isolating it is, especially with how we run things at the Foundation. We just put these people in these boxes and hope to learn as much as we can about them before they break down. It\u2019s really quite something to see it from the other side. I guess I want those items, because it would be nice to have something in here that is just as trapped as I am.\n\n\nDr. Freemont:\n I see\u2026\n\n\nSCP-2860:\n [\nChuckles\n] As I said before, it\u2019s kind of funny.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: 2860-3: Update\n As of 06/10/2015, SCP-2860\u2019s effect has increased in sensitivity from direct physical contact with its hands to direct physical contact anywhere on its body. As a result, the subject is almost constantly covered with a fine marble powder on all exposed areas when outside of a sterile environment. SCP-2860 claims this constant use of its effect causes it continuous discomfort, and as a result has made SCP-2860 increasingly irritable. Special Containment Procedures have been updated to reflect this change. Object class has been upgraded to Euclid.\n\n\nAddendum: 2860-4: Update\n As of 07/11/2016, SCP-2860\u2019s effect has increased in sensitivity to not only include direct physical contact with any hair shed by the object, but also transforms all organic matter, living or dead, including the stratum corneum layer of SCP-2860\u2019s own epidermis resulting in a near constant coat of marble dust on SCP-2860\u2019s body. Shed hair seems to maintain SCP-2860\u2019s effect indefinitely. As a result of the transformation of SCP-2860\u2019s skin, the subject claims to be in a near constant state of discomfort. At the time of writing, SCP-2860 is unable to sleep without sedation, and must be fed intravenously due to food undergoing transformation during all attempts of SCP-2860 to feed itself. At the current time, SCP-2860\u2019s internal tissue does not appear to present with the same anomalous properties.\n\n\nRepeated inhalation of the marble dust generated by SCP-2860\u2019s effect has resulted in dust deposits forming within SCP-2860\u2019s lungs. These deposits have resulted in accelerated silicosis and progressive massive fibrosis. The nearly constant buildup of marble dust along SCP-2860\u2019s eyes has resulted in severe abrasions to the object\u2019s corneas, resulting in SCP-2860 becoming largely blind in both eyes. Medical treatment to alleviate these conditions is currently ongoing. Special Containment Procedures have been updated to reflect this change.\n\n\nAddendum: 2860-5: Interview Log 2860-3\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00a02860-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following interview was conducted following a standard mental health screening on 17/12/2016.\n\n\nInterviewed: SCP-2860\n\n\nInterviewer: Dr. Cassidy\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was done by SCP-2860\u2019s request following a standard mental health screening conducted via telecast.
