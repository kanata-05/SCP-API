Personnel entering the containment area should wear Level 1 biohazard suits to avoid being bitten by SCP-456, and the suits must be treated with insecticide upon leaving the enclosure. When not being used in experiments, SCP-456 must be fed 70 ml of human or animal blood per 100 insects, weekly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-456 is a variety of the common bedbug (\nCimex lectularius\n). In addition to an anticoagulant, SCP-456 injects [DATA EXPUNGED] when biting its host, causing the brain to produce adenosine, endorphins, and a narcotic identified as an analogue of fentanyl. As a result, victims of SCP-456 infestations experience increasing euphoria and somnolence as the number of insects increases, eventually sleeping 24 hours/day.\n\n\nSCP-456 was identified after a number of individuals were found dead in their homes, suffering from varying degrees of malnutrition, blood loss, and narcotics toxicity. SCP-456 continues to be a problem in the wild. To reduce the number of infestations, the CDC has issued a false report that bedbugs carry malaria and must be exterminated when found.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Four D-Class were requisitioned for exposure to SCP-456, to determine long-term effects.\n\n\nExperiment 456-1:\n D-17514 exposed to SCP-456 and fed standard rations, but given no other special treatment. After 17 days of exposure, D-17514 slept constantly and was unable to care for himself. Subject expired from malnutrition \u2588 days later.\n\n\nExperiment 456-2:\n D-17515 exposed to SCP-456 and fed intravenously when unable to care for herself. Subject expired from blood loss after \u2588\u2588 days.\n\n\nExperiment 456-3:\n D-17516 exposed to SCP-456, fed intravenously, and given periodic blood transfusions as needed. Subject expired from narcotic overdose after \u2588\u2588 days.\n\n\nExperiment 456-4:\n D-17517 exposed to SCP-456, fed intravenously, and given periodic blood transfusions in addition to small doses of a narcotic antagonist. Subject survived for \u2588\u2588\u2588 days, and was supporting a colony of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 insects at conclusion of experiment. D-17517 remanded for amnestic treatment and reassignment on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum:\n \nMobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\")\n is investigating a report that a drug cartel located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Mexico, is kidnapping members of the public, breeding SCP-456, and extracting the narcotics produced by the victims under the cover of DEA operatives. Anyone found to be using SCP-456 in this manner is to be terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-455\n | SCP-456 | \nSCP-457\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-456\n\" by eric_h, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
