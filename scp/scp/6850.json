Retrieval of SCP-6850 for any reason such as testing or interviews should be conducted through a specialized transferable containment module. A grid of individually controllable sprinklers on the chamber's ceiling may be strategically used to counter any non-cooperative behavior by SCP-6850; at the same time, SCP-6850 is permitted a variable array of amenities which may be temporarily revoked or adjusted as needed, contingent on SCP-6850's behavior. SCP-6850 staff should be solely manned by personnel who have demonstrated consistent resistance capability in regard to SCP-6850's perception-altering skills.\n\n\nSCP-6850-A is to be kept in a basic Anomalous Object Storage Locker, unless utilized for research or testing purposes. Any proposed tests must first be cleared with Head Researcher Carson Weigl.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6850 is a sentient, sapient spheroid object of about 0.25 meters in diameter composed of an as-yet indeterminate material. Its central 'body' maintains a perpetual layer of external flame just above its surface of extreme heat and anomalously high durability.\n1\n SCP-6850 displays an apparent maturity level somewhat analogous to an adolescent or preteen human being and a general level of intelligence somewhat higher. In either case however, any such comparison is imperfect as the degree to which any particular specific traits or attributes can be accurately described by human comparison inevitably varies widely.\n\n\nSCP-6850 will alternate between three major activity levels or \u201cstates\u201d. These depend foremost on its volatile mood, along with secondary factors that have been noted to include access to fuel, presence of other individuals, and any immediate availability for SCP-6850 to engage in its desired behaviors.\n2\n\n\nThese states can be generally described as follows:\n\n\n\n\nInert:\n Low energy state, characterized by the relatively small and cool blue flame surrounding its main body, compared to other states, and its lack of any communication or movement while in this state.\n\n\n\n\nAlert:\n Intermediate energy state, characterized by a brighter and hotter blue flame with violet or magenta streaks, the ability to move and communicate, and relative lucidity.\n\n\n\n\nAgitated:\n High energy state, characterized by intense emotions, hyperactive and unpredictable behavior, flames which shift to a highly varied array of colors and temperatures high enough to melt even most metals and alloys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6850 in its Alert State.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-6850 possesses the ability to influence nearby individuals in such a way that, upon anything more than momentary exposure, induce them to perceive SCP-6850 as a normal human person in appearance as well as speech, as SCP-6850 is able to verbally communicate in slightly-to-moderately broken English through unknown means; its \u201cvoice\u201d has been consistently described as or along the lines of \u201chigh-pitched\u201d and \u201chissing\u201d by personnel not under the effect of its perception-altering influence. These perception altering capabilities have also been noted to lead influenced subjects to interpret any claims made by SCP-6850 as factual unless directly contrary to contemporaneously observable evidence. Affected subjects also attempt to rationalize and logical discrepancies or issues that may result, as well as try to prevent any perceived harm to SCP-6850 or complications to its stated objectives at a given time. Most human persons are vulnerable to these perception-altering effects, though a select minority who possess sufficient Cognitive Resistance Index levels, whether naturally or through appropriate training, will not be.\n3\n\n\nSCP-6850-A is a smooth, hemispherical tungsten bowl with a diameter just over that of SCP-6850. Prior to containment, SCP-6850 usually elected to adorn the item on its upper half while mobile,\n4\n and rest with its lower half inside while inert. No anomalous properties have been noted as of yet, though the possibility of such properties hasn't been ruled out either, especially in light of the apparent significance SCP-6850 itself attaches to the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6850-1:\n Initial Recovery and Interview Records\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery Summary:\n SCP-6850 was recovered following a Foundation investigation of an odd, recent pattern of forest and brush fires in eastern Washington, United States that deviated from non-anomalous, naturally-occurring conflagrations which periodically occur in the region. The field team sent to the scene quickly followed a surprisingly long and narrow corridor of burnt or burning woodland until SCP-6850 was spotted among the detritus and, adopting the illusion of a hiker, convinced the field agents to assist it in finding its \"special headwear\", which it had misplaced somewhere in the area after falling down a hill after losing its balance.\n\n\nThe aforementioned item was eventually discovered, though only as Agent Vince Matthews encountered the group and successfully identified SCP-6850's true form due to his superior cognitive resistance levels. Upon alerting his team members to engage their cognitohazard-resistance goggles, SCP-6850 and the newfound item (since designated SCP-6850-A) were taken into Foundation custody. Initial Interview transcripts are available below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Intake Interview, Attempt #1\n\n\nInitial Intake Interview, Attempt #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Given the nature of SCP-6850's abilities, an appropriately trained senior researcher, Carson Weigl, was assigned to oversee initial interview and containment procedures for SCP-6850. SCP-6850, seemingly having interpreted its surroundings as a scientific research institution, initially attempted to appropriate the appearance of a passing researcher .\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Oh good, you are here to clear things up? There has been terrible mistake somehow! These ruffians senselessly detained me, and are calling ME, Senior Head Doctor of the Various Sciences Blaze Orbison, an \u201cAnimal E\u201d that must be prisoned!\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Nice try, but I\u2019m specially trained against weak cognitohazards like yours. Those \u201cruffians\u201d, are too, but we\u2019re all wearing special filtered headsets just to be extra safe. We all can see you for what you actually are. Also, the word is \nanomaly\n.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 does not noticeably react or respond for six seconds.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Must have confusion. Maybe Cockney Two Lizards [sic]\n5\n is what makes you see false form of not-sciencer-doctor.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n It\u2019s cog\u2013 you know what, never mind. Point is, everyone here can see that you\u2019re some kind of blue flaming spheroid.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850\u2019s flame immediately begins to grow and take on a brighter shade of blue.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n AM ORB! NOT MERE SPHERE, HOW DARE! RESPECT ORB!\n\n\n(\nAfter three seconds, SCP-6850\u2019s flame reverts back to almost its original color and size\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Oops\u2026 am mean\u2026 Ok, you win.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I appreciate your honesty, and hope it continues. I know you might be confused, but I\u2019m happy to try to clear things up for you, as long as you're willing to do the same for me.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmm\u2026 Why should trust?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019m open to suggestions. Is there anything we could do to prove our good faith?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmm\u2026 Free from cage? Am not liking, it no burn.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that at the moment, not yet.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850\u2019s flame again begins to grow and take on a brighter hue.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n BOO! Lame, much lame. No trust!\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 begins to roll back and forth at the walls of its container in apparent attempts to break through, without success.\n)\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019m sorry, SCP-6850, we can get you more\u2026 satisfactory accommodations once this interview is complete.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 temporarily halts its bombardment of the enclosure.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmmm\u2026. NO TRUST!\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 resumes hitting the wall for ten more seconds while ignoring all attempts of communication from S.R. Weigl, before suddenly stopping and entering its lowest energy state, since designated its Inert state, and becoming wholly unresponsive.\n)\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n SCP-6850? Excuse me, SCP-6850\u2026 (\nsighing\n) Dammit.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-6850 remained in its Inert state until approximately three hours after its transfer to its new containment chamber. During this time, it briefly entered its Alert state, rolling around the unit for 27 seconds, before returning to its Inert state for the next 14 hours. During this time, it remained either unable or unwilling to respond to staff attempts to communicate with it once its renewed activity was noticed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n After 28 hours, SCP-6850 resumed an Alert state once a small pile of dead leaves was placed nearby at the suggestion of S.R. Weigl. The next interview was conducted at SCP-6850's chamber to decrease the chances of non-cooperation via SCP-6850\u2019s demonstrated distaste for the smaller mobile containment unit.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Hello SCP-6850, how are you feeling today?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Hmmph. No like jail\u2026 Thank for food though. Can me get more? Am still hungry.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019ll see what I can do, as long as you cooperate through another short interview.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850\u2019s flame wavers a little before it rolls closer the heat-resistant glass without immediately answering, waiting until it stops approximately two meters away.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmm, Ok. You look like not lying now, unlike last time. Will try\u2026 no laughy company though.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Uh, sorry; did you say \u2018Laughy\u2019\u2026 Oh, you mean funny business?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n (\nSCP-6850\u2019s flames begin to quickly grow and flicker in color.\n) WILL FUNNY TO GET UP IN YOUR BUSINESS!\n\n\n(\nAfter two seconds, as S.R. Weigl is about to respond, SCP-6850 recedes to its prior state..\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Sorry, just grumpy cause trapped and hungry. Also, no speak Human perfect yet.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n It\u2019s\u2026 quite alright. Technically what we\u2019re speaking is English, by the way; humans have a bunch of languages, but I suppose that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Why, where is then? You put it in cage too?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n It was just an expression.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Human is a confusing language. Not care anymore though. Just ask next question.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Again it\u2013 never mind. When did you start learning English? Or, uh, \u201cHuman\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmmm\u2026 Don't know, long as can remember. Seemed useful, there are lots of you.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Understandable, but please think back; is there any\u2013\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Next question.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Um, sorry SCP-6850, but I\u2013\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Next question, mean science man!\n\n\n(\nS.R. Weigl briefly discusses with other staff as SCP-6850\u2019s flames once again begin to grow and brighten in agitation.\n)\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Ok SCP-6850, we can come back to that later. What about where you come from? Did someone or something create you?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Dumb question, like last. You remember your baby-times?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Well, no, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really compara-\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n How are flames?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n You suck at questions; am taking turn now. How are the flames?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I genuinely have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, SCP-6850, you\u2019d have to be more specific.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Ugh, dumb science man. Flames! Fires, blazes, infernos? How are flames and flamekind of the world doing right now? You captured all of them or just me?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Um, no\u2026 nor do we have any desire to \u201ccapture\u201d all of the world\u2019s fire.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Hmmph. Better not, fire fight back!\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019ll make sure to keep that in mind. The world's flames are doing just fine.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 appears to calm slightly, per its receding flame.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Good to hear! Now, how are Orbs?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Now SCP-6850, remember who is interviewing whom here. Although if you cooperate, maybe I can look into the, uh, \"orbs\" later on.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Oh fine, your turn anyway, me guess. What ask?\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n Ok well, how can you see and hear us?

You is one with the science stuff.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n That\u2019s \u2019s exactly what I\u2019m trying to find out, but you\u2019re not exactly the easiest-to-examine specimen to develop in-depth observation procedures for, what with the 1,500\u00b0 Celsius aura of fire and all.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Hey! You stay out of my depths, Doctor Pervert!\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n That's also just an expression, SCP-6850.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n You just mad that me hot, you not.\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n (\nsighing\n) Let\u2019s just move on again\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n How bout \u2018move on again\u2019 some fuel into my dungeon. This talk taking hours, am hungry!\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n It\u2019s only been seven minutes SCP-6850, and the room is your containment chamber, not a \u201cdungeon\u201d\u2026 Ok, you know what fine. Jenkins, toss some sticks in there or something.\n\n\n(\nJunior Researcher Jenkins puts some wood into the item transfer slot, after which SCP-6850 quickly rolls over. H.R. Weigl allows a couple minutes for SCP-6850 to \u2018consume\u2019 the sticks by setting itself among the pile and appearing to absorb the ash as it forms, before resuming questioning.\n)\n\n\nS.R. Weigl:\n This is actually a good segue into another important question. You seem to be \u201ceating\u201d all that wood as such, but visually, you don\u2019t actually seem to have increased in size.

Weigl:\n You've got to be kidding me.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-6850 remained inert for approximately the next 41 hours. Given it\u2019s non-compliance, future interviews will take place in separate interview rooms with SCP-6850 in its miniature mobile containment unit as with it\u2019s initial intake interview, rather than SCP-6850\u2019s own containment chamber for the time being going forward. Perhaps a return to it\u2019s larger chamber used as an incentive for more consistent cooperation from SCP-6850. - S.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6850-2:\n Further Interviews\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Weigl was appointed Head Researcher for SCP-6850, and has since conducted subsequent interview attempts that have largely continued to follow largely similar patterns as seen from the first two interviews. This includes SCP-6850\u2019s easily triggered hostility and weak attention span leading to a consistent lack of ability to main focus on any single task or topic it is uninterested in. As a result, only a sample of particularly relevant or representative excerpts have been compiled for review, in the place of full logs.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0View\u00a0Further\u00a0Interview\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview #05\n\n\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n \u2026For the last time SCP-6850, we already granted your requests for CERTAIN amenities like the soccer and basketballs, the slide, and the obstacle course.\n7\n We're not going to let have every single thing you ask for.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n C'mon\u2026. Sport orbs, slides, all that fun, but not forever! Am get bored!\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n I\u2019m sorry, truly I am, but I just absolutely cannot sign off on granting you a pet! Even if I could, you\u2019d almost certainly kill it.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Would not, am nice! SCP-6850 is angel. Would never even hurt fly, or try to use for escape.\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n SCP-6850, you have already instigated multiple containment breach attempts and have threatened to both \"send me to a fiery grave\" and to \"Be the practice round that sends me to the burning Hell that already awaits\" me, all just within the last week!\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmm\u2026 Was kidding? Besides, am responsible!\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n Even if that weren\u2019t demonstrably untrue, it's not the primary issue. SCP-6850, you severely burn any living thing you touch or even get too close to touching. It's a lot harder to fire-proof a cat or hamster than, say, a soccer ball.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Am still more preferable to touch or be close to than you! How that for severe burn.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n Request for a pet continues to be refused, but can we look into setting up a remotely viewable tv or something? Anything to get it to stop complaining quite so much\u2026 - H.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview #09\n\n\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n No SCP-6850, I haven\u2019t seen the show \u201cAvatar: Last of Airbenders, people who totally had coming,\u201d and so I can\u2019t tell you why \u201cEveryone so mean to Fire Nation\u201d as I believe you so elegantly put it.\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Just is baffling to me.\n\n\nH.R. Weigl:\n What I CAN tell you is that you won\u2019t get to find out either if you don\u2019t focus, because I gave you your TV privileges but can just as easily take them away.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 briefly appears to begin entering its Agitated state, but quickly reverts back to normal Alert state.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Fine, sorry. Am concentrate now, much focus!\n\n\nH.R. Weigl\n Thank you, SCP-6850. I\u2019ll repeat my original question then; do you have any notion of why exactly your flames show so many different colors when you\u2019re in your Agitated State?\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 is silent for several moments before answering.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Is just\u2026 Why don\u2019t other element peoples just accept their superiors as rightful leaders and be grateful for opportunity?\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n SCP-6850\u2019s television privileges were taken away for two days as punishment for continued non-cooperation. I\u2019m also going to be formally requesting some sort of more qualified specialist to take over interview sessions. Dealing with anomalies with this kind of demeanor has never been my forte, and perhaps a different individual to whom SCP-6850 isn\u2019t so antagonistic towards may have better luck getting any remotely worthwhile information from it. - H.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview #17\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n \nDr. Lena Primaru\n, a specialist in psychology of anomalous juveniles and comparable entities, was brought on to handle both biweekly therapy sessions and more formal information gathering interviews with SCP-6850 following administrative approval of H.R. Weigl\u2019s request.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Me like you, you are nicer than Wiggle Doctor. Hey by way, never got answer back from him. How are the orbs?\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Orbs\u2026 as in, entities such as yourself?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Enties, not enties [sic], no matter. How are?\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Well, ok so to clarify; are you referring to other orbs that like you, can think and speak and move on their own?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Ugh; maybe some, is not like me know every orb in world personally. Lot orbs don\u2019t speak, like the floor orbs on your chair, its feet. Me know, am already have tried to\u2026 never mind.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Ok, so a couple of things. First off, what are these \"chair feet\" you're referring to?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n The orbs at bottom of chair you has, silly! The ones chair moves with.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Wha\u2026 Oh, the spherical wheels of my chair, I see!\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n \u201cChair feet\u201d and \u201cfloor orbs\u201d are shorter. Humans always overcomplexicate things.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Your terms are fine to use, I suppose, I just didn\u2019t want to\u2013\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n FLOORBS!\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n I\u2019m sorry?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Floorbs. 'Floor' plus 'orbs' equal \u2018floorbs\u2019. Even simpler, even better name. Best name. FLOORBS. Am truly becoming master of Human language!\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Uh, yeah sure, \"floorbs\" works, but I need you to focus SCP-6850. My next concern was, exactly what were you referring to when you said you had \u2018already tried to\u2013\u2019\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n ME TIRED! Suddenly much tired. Time for nap now.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Not yet, SCP-6850, now we\u2019re not done here\u2026\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 shifts into its Inert state.\n)\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n SCP-6850 refused to awaken until two hours after being returned to its main chamber. Any attempts at bringing up the previous line of questioning were met with claims that it didn\u2019t remember what it had been referring to. - Dr. Primaru\n\n\nIf it were anyone else, I wouldn't even consider believing that claim for a second, but with SCP-6850 it might actually be true. I honestly don't know which would be more infuriating. - H.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview #24\n\n\n\n\nDr. Primaru\n SCP-6850, I know you\u2019ve expressed that you don\u2019t remember much about your origins, but I want you to really try and think back. What is your earliest memory?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Ok, Doc! For you, will try real hard.\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850 is silent for approximately 11 seconds before resuming speech.\n)\n\n\nMmmmm\u2026 Methinks that was in dark place; probably was nighttime, but there were other fires around, so was ok. Me know am was very young, cause couldn\u2019t even tell clothes of the nearby humans apart, let lone faces and stuff. Anyway, we were in empty circle in woods; am was placed in big bowl as the humans stood in circle around me chanting. Then one reached in and pulled me out.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n With what?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Hands. He no seem to like though. He keep trying to hold on to me, then he start singing louder until he scream then he drop me. That make other humans gathered mad for some reason, and they all start walking towards us. They pulled out sharp things and start stabbing him, was very rude. Me no learn human yet, but could already tell he not liking what his friends were doing, so me thought to self \u2018No sir\u2019 and didn\u2019t wait for my turn. Am just rolled out of the big bowl mw was in, grabbed a smaller fire bowl nearby for protection, and rolled away into woods.\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n Ok, now we might be on to something, this could be a real breakthrough. Do you remember anything else about those people, or the forest clearing, or hell, even the big bowl you were in?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Mmmmm, no. But do remember that safety bowl became my trusty Bedhat, which you peoples still won\u2019t give back! Where Bedhat?\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n I\u2019m sorry SCP-6850, but I can\u2019t give that to you at the moment. Why are you so anxious to have it back? Does it let you do certain other things, or give you some ability?\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Makes me safe! Always have been safe while had! Then one day, am go and lose it for just few minutes and boom! Kidnapped by you peoples. Am know you still have though, cause saw it carried in this big building with me, so where is now?!\n\n\n(\nThroughout this outburst SCP-6850 becomes increasingly active, and has almost fully shifted into its Agitated state by the time it finishes. It begins rocking back and forth, alternating between the front and back panels of its mobile containment unit.\n)\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n SCP-6850, please calm down\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n NO! WANT BEDHAT! WANT BEDHAT! GIVE BACK BEDHAT!\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850\u2019s fully reaches its Agitated state, and the mobile containment unit begins sounding warning alerts for extremely high temperature and threat to structural integrity.\n)\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n SCP-6850-\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n WANT BEDHAT! GIVE IT BACK!\n\n\nDr. Primaru:\n OK! I can\u2019t promise anything beyond this, but I do promise I will see what I can do, please trust me!\n\n\n(\nSCP-6850\u2019s rapid bouncing between the walls of its containment unit slows as the billowing rainbow flames begin shifting back to more uniform shades of blue. The alarms cease as the containment unit cools, and SCP-6850 stops entirely after around 11 seconds.\n)\n\n\nSCP-6850:\n Th\u2026 Thank\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6850-3:\n Escape Attempts\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6850 has used its cognitohazardous and pyrokinetic properties to attempt breach of its containment 11 times, one of which so far has been initially successful.\n8\n Such breaches are often effectively foiled in part or whole as a result of SCP-6850\u2019s easily triggered distractibility, although increasing focus and complexity in tactical consideration has been noted to develop over time with each attempt, with improving containment protocols and breach containment strategies on the part of the Foundation developing continuously in response.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Unsuccessful\u00a0Escape\u00a0Attempts\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Attempt: June 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n SCP-6850 repeatedly asks to be let go non-stop for over five and a half hours, alternating between nice/polite requests and aggressive demands.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n Requests consistently denied or ignored. Internal security team provided earplugs.\n\n\n\n\nPost-Incident Response:\n SCP-6850 eventually gives up and returns to its Inert state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd Attempt: June 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n SCP-6850 begins rolling back and forth and speaking softly but angrily to itself in a manner reminiscent of pacing. Most dialogue is unable to be concretely made out, though individual words and phrases such as \"no right to trap me\", \"this place suck\", \"Dr. Wiggle very mean\", and \"won't even tell about orbs\" are occasionally able to be made out. After an inquiry by the attendant security agent to SCP-6850 as to whether anything was wrong went ignored, the agent elected not to intervene further. However, after about 8 minutes, SCP-6850 begins to accelerate and enter an Agitated state, initially unnoticed by the then-distracted Agent.\n\n\nAfter increasing by a significant level of speed and temperature, a now wholly-Agitated SCP-6850 rolls at an unprecedentedly high speed up its slide and directly into the first security camera, damaging and disabling it as SCP-6850 ricochet off onto the floor hallway back across the chamber. SCP-6850 somehow successfully aims the resulting bounce as to put it in line with the chamber's second camera in the opposite corner. It rushed out of its chamber once the entrance was opened for a manual search, rolling around or between the legs of the entering security personnel.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-6850 was \ncaptured\n with the help of \nSCP-5595\n and returned its chamber.\n\n\n\n\nPost-Incident Response:\n Two extra security cameras installed, and modified with impact and heat resistant protections.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Though SCP-6850 has a mixed-at-best record of cooperating with attempted intelligence-measuring tests, it has never shown any particularly elevated aptitude in mathematics or spatial reasoning; certainly not to the level of advancement that would be required to properly calculate and implement the level of precision in speed, angle, slide placement, and bounce trajectory necessary to pull off this kind of stunt. Unless SCP-6850 has some hitherto unobserved probabilistic abilities that it waited to use until now, it obviously was not performing to its true potential on those tests.\n\n\nWe can't let its general behavioral immaturity lull us into underestimating its cognitive potential like this again, though perhaps we can use the former to help us interpret the latter. I'll start working with Dr. Primaru to formulate some kind of disguised intelligence tests that can be credibly presented as games, puzzles, or some other kind of enrichment activities for future testing. - H.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6th Attempt: July 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n During an unrelated breach event from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-6850 hid in seemingly intentionally generated blind spot obscured by strategic placement of objects within the chamber. While undergoing checks for additional breaches upon re-containment of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the lack of any visible presence of SCP-6850 once again necessitated manual search. SCP-6850 once again barreled through the incoming internal security agents and out into the site.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-6850 was recaptured upon getting distracted by passing a passing researcher who sarcastically responded to a colleague \"Is the Earth round?\" to express confidence in some preceding statement.\n\n\nSCP-6850 stopped and, while maintaining the perceived appearance of a regular researcher, loudly asked \"Wait, is it?!\" before pushing the incredulous personnel to elaborate on her declaration until finally being caught up to and apprehended by security.\n\n\n\n\nPost-Incident Response:\n SCP-6850 was taken back to containment and, following H.R. Weigl's direction upon his arrival to the scene, given the harshest punishment available under the current Ethics-Committee-Approved disciplinary protocols: 90 seconds locked within a running shower.\n\n\nAfter this recapture and subsequent punishment, SCP-6850 maintained an even-longer-than usual belligerent state, laced with novel insults and epithets towards all involved Foundation staff (especially H.R. Weigl), their actions, their families, and the Site as a whole. This persisted until SCP-6850 was successfully distracted by a confirmation from Dr. Primaru that the Earth is in fact round, consisting of a \"giant orb\" in space that only \"seems flat because of just how big and grand an orb it is\".\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Just a hunch, but glad it worked so well! SCP-6850 is a volatile, but there are constructive ways to calm its mercurial temper in tough situations. - Dr. Primaru\n\n\nAt the suggestion of my psychologist, I've requested an additional week off from my already-planned time off next Monday to attend my Mother's funeral. I admit I overreacted with the shower; hopefully a bit of temporary distance from the Site and this assignment will do me good. I leave SCP-6850 in the capable hands of Dr. Primaru in the meantime. - H.R. Weigl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10th Attempt: August 31, 2022\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n Initially successful, but SCP-6850 ultimately recontained.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n See Document 6850.EA15.IR for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Document\u00a06850.EA15.IR:\u00a0Successful\u00a0Containment\u00a0Breach\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Breach Incident log\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following incident occurred on September 6, 2022 and was precipitated by a junior researcher ignoring all posted warnings and attempting to take a shortcut through the restricted area near SCP-6850's containment chamber in order to arrive on-time to an orientation session for their new project. In doing so, the researcher ventured close enough for SCP-6850 to utilize its perception-altering capabilities to instigate a containment breach.\n\n\nNotably, SCP-6850 demonstrated a previously unseen ability to seemingly alter vulnerable personnel's perception in such a way that they heard and interpreted SCP-6850 speaking to them when no such sound is actually audible upon recording equipment. While it is hypothesized that this could be a new, novel tactic on the part of SCP-6850 to avoid alerting any nearby members of its own research and containment staff,\n9\n SCP-6850 has proven characteristically uncooperative on elucidating the exact purpose of the behaviors in question.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n[Junior Researcher Alex Harden walks by SCP-6850's containment chamber and calmly begins to speak with it.]\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n Hey Dr. Fiore, you called for me?\n\n\n(\nNo audible response.\n)\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n Um, yeah I suppose\u2026 Wait, why are you in a containment chamber?\n\n\n(\nNo audible response.\n)\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n Oh inspection, of course. Well yeah anyway, I was on my way to orientation for my new Keter assignment, but this seems more important; I\u2019ll be right back!\n\n\n(\nJ.R. Harden can be seen swiftly exiting the chamber and making their way to Anomalous Item Storage Locker #32-C17. J.R. Harden has apparent trouble opening the desired ocker due to inadequate credentials, and displays increasing frustration as they continue attempting to access the locker using their existing clearance information, or to bypass it entirely.\n)\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n Dammit! Come on\u2026\n\n\n(\nJ.R. Harden\u2019s outburst is noticed by nearby security agent Nancy Cooper. Agent Cooper moves to confront and forcefully question J.R. Harden on their current activity.\n)\n\n\n[IRRELEVANT DIALOGUE REMOVED FOR BREVITY]\n\n\n(\nAfter a short but seemingly spirited argument, Agent Cooper pulls out her terminal.\n10\n)\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Wait here, I'll just go ask directly.\n\n\n(\nAgent Cooper heads towards the SCP-6850 containment chamber after asking where \"Dr. Fiore\" was located, and soon arrives.\n) Yo Doc, some scrub is trying to break into the AO lockers, said its off of your direction. Is this Harden as full of shit as they sound?\n\n\n(\nNo audible response.\n)\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Well I\u2019ll be damned. (\nchuckling\n) I guess I owe the kid an apology\u2026\n\n\n(\nAgent Cooper pulls out their terminal and calls Sector Security Supervisor Thomas Warren.\n)\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Hey chief, need a quick favor; Dr. Fiore needs to access SCP-6850-1 for testing\u2026 He said his\u2026\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Yeah,\n\n\n(\nAgent Cooper briefly turns to look questioningly at SCP-6850 before nodding and returning to her call.\n)\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n \u2026Ah, arthritis. His arthritis is acting up, so he sent a JR to retrieve it, but the system apparently isn\u2019t letting him use the doc\u2019s personal passcode for some reason\u2026 What do you mean \u2018What pass code?\u2019\n11\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Alright, if you're nearby, come talk to him yourself, Jeez.\n\n\n(\nSecurity Chief Warren soon enters camera view as he approaches Agent Cooper and SCP-6850 in its chamber.\n)\n\n\nS.C. Warren:\n OK, Professor Security-Risk, just who do you think-\n\n\n(\nS.C. Warren stops suddenly as if interrupted as SCP-6850 begins to oscillate in place as its flames grow and begin to show flashes of various other colors. Agent Cooper can be seen smirking in the background. After eleven seconds, S.C. Cooper begins nodding solemnly to SCP-6850.\n)\n\n\nS.C. Warren:\n My apologies Doctor, I didn\u2019t realize how important this was. I\u2019ll send the override now.\n\n\n(\nS.C. Warren pulls out his terminal and initiates the mobile override sequence. Contemporaneously, Agent Cooper contacts and instructs J.R. Harden attempt accessing SCP-6850-A\u2019s containment locker, which they do.\n)\n\n\n(\nAfter grabbing SCP-6850-A, J.R. Harden heads to SCP-6850\u2019s containment chamber. Upon reaching it 45 seconds later, J.R. Harden sets it down in front of SCP-6850, who soon rolls it onto its upper half.\n)\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n There ya go, Dr. Fiore. Anything else we can do to help further?\n\n\n(\nNo audible response.\n)\n\n\nJ.R. Harden:\n Wow, I guess you\u2019re right. Ingenious idea Dr. Fiore! The forest just outside the Site \nwould\n be a great place to run these tests.\n\n\n(\nNo audible response.\n)\n\n\nAgent Cooper:\n Sure, Doc, I'll show you the way.\n\n\n(\nAt this point, Agent Cooper, SCP-6850 and SCP-6850-A begin heading towards the Site\u2019s main entrance. Other video feeds catch at least seven separate staff members that Agent Cooper and SCP-6850 encounter on the way, almost all of whom offer friendly greetings to them as they pass by. The two exit the site with minimal difficulty, and Agent Cooper opens the outer security gate for SCP-6850 once reached.\n)\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Shortly following the events described above, a rapidly-spreading forest fire rapidly spread near the southwest perimeter of Site-322. The cause of the inferno was quickly posited to be directly related to SCP-6850\u2019s containment breach once H.R. Weigl returned from his lunch break 12 minutes after the breach occurred and noted SCP-6850\u2019s absence. SCP-6850 was successfully recovered by Site field agents about 1.4 kilometers away after just over four hours, once the forest fire had been sufficiently diminished to permit aerial reconnaissance drones to identify and follow the trail of relatively smaller, newer flames left by SCP-6850 as it rolled through the forest, and returned to containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by Dr. Primaru, throughout the entire breach event, SCP-6850-A was not seen to display any additional anomalous attributes once reunited with SCP-6850, even in situations where any number of hypothetical abilities could have been helpful towards escape. Dr. Primaru has thus submitted a formal request to Site Administration to allow granting limited access to SCP-6850 in the future, contingent on behavior. H.R Weigl voiced his own support after reviewing available footage. A final verdict on granting or denying the request is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. All observed materials or actions that would weaken or extinguish most non-anomalous flames of a similar size and/or intensity have had little to no visible effect on SCP-6850's flame, though SCP-6850 itself will often express irritation when subjected to such action.\n\n\n2\n. Such behaviors often center on setting nearby material on fire, communicating with other sapient beings, engaging in humanoid-geared physical recreation activities (despite SCP-6850's standard frustration with relatively difficult skills or concepts like 'throwing', 'catching', and 'swimming')\n\n\n3\n. Unlike its physical properties, the strength of SCP-6850's perception-based effects appears to be the same across different energy states.\n\n\n4\n. believed to be accomplished through a non-anomalous physical process involving a heated layer of air to prevent direct contact with SCP-6850\u2019s main body and any resulting friction have not been ruled out either.\n\n\n5\n. At least, thats my best guess based on what its estimation sounded like. - \nS.R. Weigl\n\n\n6\n. Complete logs may be provided from the SCP-6850 research team or the RAISA upon request to individuals with appropriate clearance.\n\n\n7\n. Technically a specially treated pet toy of the kind commonly referred to as a \u2018cat tree\u2019, but referred to as obstacle course to SCP-6850 itself to avoid any potential offense and agitation.\n\n\n8\n. Though SCP-6850 was soon recovered; an incident summary is available in Addendum 6850-2.\n\n\n9\n. Who through training and/or equipment would be able to see and hear through SCP-6850's illusions,\n\n\n10\n. Agent Cooper later clarified that she initially tried to call \u201cDr. Fiore\u201d directly, but decided to discuss the matter in person after failing to find that name or associated contact information.\n\n\n11\n. As A.O. storage units are secured in part by biometric authentication, barring a Level 4 Security Lead Emergency Override, it is unclear what a singular \u201cpersonal passcode\u201d would even refer to to in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6849\n | SCP-6850 | \nSCP-6851\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6850\n\" by RealSurrealSir, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Inert: Low energy state, characterized by the relatively small and cool blue flame surrounding its main body, compared to other states, and its lack of any communication or movement while in this state. Alert: Intermediate energy state, characterized by a brighter and hotter blue flame with violet or magenta streaks, the ability to move and communicate, and relative lucidity. Agitated: High energy state, characterized by intense emotions, hyperactive and unpredictable behavior, flames which shift to a highly varied array of colors and temperatures high enough to melt even most metals and alloys.",

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-6850 is to be kept in a heat-resistant containment chamber at Site-322. Retrieval of SCP-6850 for any reason such as testing or interviews should be conducted through a specialized transferable containment module. A grid of individually controllable sprinklers on the chamber's ceiling may be strategically used to counter any non-cooperative behavior by SCP-6850; at the same time, SCP-6850 is permitted a variable array of amenities which may be temporarily revoked or adjusted as needed, contingent on SCP-6850's behavior. SCP-6850 staff should be solely manned by personnel who have demonstrated consistent resistance capability in regard to SCP-6850's perception-altering skills.",
    "description": "SCP-6850 is a sentient, sapient spheroid object of about 0.25 meters in diameter composed of an as-yet indeterminate material. Its central 'body' maintains a perpetual layer of external flame just above its surface of extreme heat and anomalously high durability.1 SCP-6850 displays an apparent maturity level somewhat analogous to an adolescent or preteen human being and a general level of intelligence somewhat higher. In either case however, any such comparison is imperfect as the degree to which any particular specific traits or attributes can be accurately described by human comparison inevitably varies widely.",
