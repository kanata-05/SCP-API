The Special Containment Procedures you are reading were last current on \nJune 4, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-8212 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-48.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8212 is a virulent \nUsinsk-class\n \u201cPattern Screamer\u201d ideoform that attained humanoid form in Pierre, South Dakota on May 4, 2015.\n\n\nUsinsk-class ideoforms are \nheavily distorted remnants\n of the inhabitants of a prior iteration of this universe. The nature of their partial existence is not yet fully understood; however, when perceived by intelligent beings, Usinsk-class ideoforms flare briefly into existence. Additionally, the nature of an Usinsk-class ideoform will conform to the conscious and unconscious expectations of the perceiving entity, a process known to be instantaneous, involuntary, and the source of great pain. While most desire permanent nonexistence, some, including SCP-8212, have instead expressed a desire to achieve and maintain corporeal form.\n\n\nTaking advantage of an unusual period of porosity caused by a separate noospheric anomaly breaching containment, SCP-8212 briefly extended the parameters of its quasi-existence to encompass Earth\u2019s noosphere as a whole, providing it with effective omniscience.\n\n\nTo attain physical form, SCP-8212 appears to have leveraged the reliance of Usinsk-class ideoforms on human perception, implanting associations between SCP-8212 and various human-esque qualia into the minds of specific Pierre, South Dakota residents through targeted infections of the noosphere. These associations resulted in SCP-8212 incarnating as a humanoid within Pierre. Upon incarnating, SCP-8212 promptly interacted with additional residents of Pierre to entrench itself in human perception and guarantee a continued, consistent corporeal existence.\n\n\nIn doing so, SCP-8212 intentionally solidified itself into the form that the non-anomalous residents of Pierre expected of it; because these individuals presumably believed that SCP-8212 was non-anomalous, this is assumed to have had the effect of removing any biological differentiation between SCP-8212 and an ordinary 27-year-old woman.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n After readings indicated a brief and severe reduction in Hume levels within Pierre, a Site-19-led investigation of the local noosphere discovered the artificial external insertion of certain associations between physical and social qualities and a previously absent concept, believed to be SCP-8212. Through flagging subsequent, organically developed conceptual associations with SCP-8212, Site-19 was able to create a list of physical qualities that SCP-8212 had assumed. An individual precisely matching these qualities was identified and detained without incident on May 11, 2015 by Drs. Masha Straschnov and Judd Fessler, who were tasked with developing a containment strategy.\n\n\nEn route to Site-48, SCP-8212 confirmed the Foundation \u201ctheory of the case\u201d regarding its emergence. It also claimed to have fully attained personhood. Because of the Foundation\u2019s high degree of certainty regarding SCP-8212\u2019s nature and motivations, an intake interview was deemed unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Interview logs with SCP-8212 are presented below. Context regarding testing results and changes in containment philosophy are presented as well. Please contact Director Kahele's office for additional relevant documentation.\n\n\n\n\nMay 12, 2015:\n SCP-8212 requested that an interview be conducted. The request was denied.\n\n\n\n\nMay 13, 2015:\n SCP-8212 requested that an interview be conducted. The request was denied.\n\n\n\n\nMay 14, 2015:\n An interview was conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of Interview (May 14, 2015)\n\n\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I was told there was a \u2018disturbance in the 8212 cell.\u2019\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Is that right?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n You want to explain this?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I thought it was clear enough. Should I have made the letters larger?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n \u201cPERSON.\u201d Charming. Is this all your own shit?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n It sure isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Clean yourself off. We\u2019ll talk in an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS DISCUSSION REMOVED]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I work for a guy named Mitch. Seventy-six. Looks older. He runs the Starlight Diner on Hackney, in southwest Pierre. It\u2019s a 24-hour joint, and he works there for sixteen-hour days, same as he has since he was a young man. He\u2019s too old to do it, but too proud to stop. He could take lighter hours. He has a good team there. He makes decent money. He just couldn\u2019t stand to.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n He fell in the kitchen last spring. He was alone at the time. Picking up a graveyard, holding down the fort. Exhaustion, of course. He nearly cracked his head against the stove. I only saw because back then I saw everything. He never told a soul.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n And then I came. And I was the girl who shows up at 9 AM and works till 5, then hands it over to Mitch, who works till 1. So I work eight hours and he works eight hours, same as he thinks it\u2019s been for the past three years, and he spends his days sitting on the porch with a book, the same way he\u2019s convinced he always did.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n He sleeps eight hours, now. His doctor\u2019s convinced he\u2019ll see 90.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Then there\u2019s Kate. She\u2019s why I\u2019m a woman, actually. Why I look like a woman. I don\u2019t remember my original gender, or if I had one; it\u2019s just been so long since I\u2019ve been alive.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n She\u2019s lonely. Not as lonely as I was, out there in the dark, but lonelier than anyone should be. Ah, she has friends. In her way. Her ex-husband got most of them in the divorce, so now they come over and eat her cooking and make sad comments afterward about \u2018how she\u2019s holding up.\u2019\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n The divorce itself was amicable. Two years together. Almost not enough time for a good head of steam to build. No broken dishes. But he tells everyone that\u2019ll listen that he just couldn\u2019t get through to her. That she would go silent. Aloof. At certain times. He means: in bed. Everyone knows he means in bed.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n He says she kissed like she was checking a box. Like she was waiting for something.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Still, he doesn\u2019t know. Just about nobody knows. \nKate\n barely knows.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Now, I know nobody asked for my opinion, but I think when people say \u2018oh, they seem to be waiting for something,\u2019 what they often mean is that they seem to be waiting for death.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n But I don\u2019t know, Judd. What do you think?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I think you're on pretty thin ice.\n\n\n(SCP-8212 shrugs.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Anyway, it\u2019s a good thing she has me. We\u2019ve been dating for a year now, for about a week. I\u2019ve got her favorite ice cream in my freezer. Maybe it\u2019s melted by now. You haven\u2019t been paying my power bill, have you?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Your power bill should be the least of your concerns.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Maybe. It's still on the list.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n As for my mom, she turned sixty-three last January. I\u2019m her only child, and God, it\u2019s not for lack of trying.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n What did you do to her children?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I never did anything to them. They never were. Christ, Masha, she had four miscarriages in a row.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I mean, that can cause a lot of grief. Even \none\n can just \nwreck\n a person. Or, well, anyway.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Do you need to take a minute?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Give me more credit than that.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n When I tell you she tried everything, I mean it. When I came along, she was just getting older, alone. I never created any need. I just filled the empty space; there was plenty to fill.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n A less charitable reading would note that your method of becoming human consists entirely of identifying the emotionally and physically vulnerable, insinuating yourself into their trust, and making deep, marked changes to their way of life in order to entrench yourself in their memory. You\u2019ve been flailing out wildly at perceived emotional vulnerabilities in order to survive. In fact, you\u2019re even doing it right now.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You\u2019re calling me parasitic.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Arguably mutualistic. Very arguably; the idea that anyone is unambiguously benefited through being deluded is, at the very least, philosophically controversial. But that\u2019s not the point. We came in here saying \u2018hey, you\u2019re a virulent ideoform, and we like to contain those.\u2019 Your response consists entirely of saying \u2018Sure, but actually, I\u2019m even more virulent than you thought.\u2019\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n It does mean I\u2019m pretty beloved down there. Means I\u2019m going to be missed.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Be that as it may, we\u2019ve made larger sacrifices for containment.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n The folks at the big sites have. Have y\u2019all?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n You don\u2019t think we have the stomach?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I don\u2019t think you have the resources. There\u2019s a woman whose kid just disappeared. Whose partner just disappeared. You\u2019ll have to amnesticize them both, and everyone they told, which is cumulatively dozens of people. Everyone at the Starlight, too. Frequent customers. Friends. And that\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s just the start. By now I\u2019m a missing person. There are probably \narticles\n about me. And you can\u2019t just allow them to circulate. Because the more people get invested, the more questions they\u2019ll have about my life story. And I\u2019ll admit that there\u2019s a few holes there. So you \nwill\n need to shut the reporting down. Then you might need to amnesticize a lot of the readers. But you can\u2019t find \nall\n the readers. And some will wonder if they ever found the girl, and then they\u2019ll check for the articles and find they aren\u2019t there. Some of them will shrug and move on. Most, even. Some will wash out to Parawatch. How sure are you that none of them will choose to look deeper?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n How, and how much, do you know about Parawatch?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Pretty much everything. You see a lot when you\u2019re nowhere. It\u2019d be a lot to take on, wouldn\u2019t it? For some little site way up in the sticks? You\u2019d have to ask for external support. It\u2019d be embarrassing for your boss. Meaning that it\u2019d be punishing for you.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n So what\u2019s your idea?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Don\u2019t amnesticize them. Amnesticize me.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Our only source of information about you is yourself.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Well, there isn\u2019t much to tell, is there? Everyone back home thinks I\u2019m just a normal person. Which means that, biologically, that\u2019s probably exactly what I am. Clay\u2019s dried by now. I\u2019ve told you everything about what I was and how I got here. As for what I am now, well, I don\u2019t think that has to be a matter of any particular interest to you.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n So how long do you want to be amnesticized for, and why?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Nothing like that. None of your twenty-four-hour stuff. I want to be amnesticized so thoroughly that I forget that I was ever anything but a person.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Fine. We amnesticize you. And then what?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I\u2019ll need a social. A birth certificate. I can tell you what the details will be. I probably don\u2019t need a passport. Or\u2014actually, I\u2019d like one. I think I\u2019ll have gone up to Edmonton one summer with my mother. I think she will have had a friend there, at one point. Some happy memory.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n And then what?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n And then I want to go back to Pierre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST-INTERVIEW DISCUSSION\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I\u2019m going to tell you something, and it\u2019s going to make you think substantially less of me.\n\n\n(Straschnov laughs.)\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Don't worry. I agree with her too.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n There is something that bugs me, though.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n That we\u2019d be batting for a pattern screamer?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n No. It\u2019s that she was omniscient \nvery fucking recently.\n So she would\u2019ve known that we\u2019d be the ones to apprehend her. She would\u2019ve known that the day she was caught was the day we were up for a new placement.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n If she checked the calendars, sure.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Remember how she just walked into the van?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Oh. Oh God. She probably knew she would eventually get caught. So\u2026 so \nit picked its own jury.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n The Mitch stuff is nice. Chicken soup for the soul. But even that might have just been for our benefit.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n What she did to Kate and the mom was probably \nentirely\n for our benefit.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I won\u2019t say the obvious. But if you knew you were going in front of me, it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to be able to say, hey, I\u2019m the emotional lifeline for my depressed partner.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Depressed queer partner, specifically.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I don\u2019t like to think I\u2019m that shallow. But it settled on this strategy when it was omniscient. If it thinks I am then I guess I am.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Just because it saw everything doesn\u2019t mean it understood.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Boy, I wish I believed that. If anything, though, the only-child story was even worse.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n I don\u2019t want to talk about that. The fact it\u2026 the fact it latched onto a woman who had gone through four of them just in order to endear itself to me.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n You know the worst part?\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n What?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n It is absolutely obvious that it saw vulnerable people, dug its claws into them, and used them to build a sympathy ploy that would convince \nus specifically\n to release it. But\u2026 but it \ndoesn\u2019t even matter.\n There\u2019s still two people who rely so heavily on it. On her. That need is real. Even if her motives were insincere, and they were \ndefinitely insincere,\n we still need to judge the house she built on its own terms.\n\n\n(Silence for ten seconds.)\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Even knowing what I know. Even knowing that it\u2019s playing into her hands. I would vote to let her go.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Me too. But the kicker is that we can\u2019t do shit. Kahele\u2019s never going to go for any plan that involves anomaly release.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Would you genuinely be behind it? Fully?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I guess I would.\n\n\nSTRASCHNOV:\n Then I can take care of Kahele.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n How the hell are you going to do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Site-48 Director Ahe Kahele (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|elehaka#noitadnuof.pcs|elehaka\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Masha Straschnov (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|3vonhcsartsm#noitadnuof.pcs|3vonhcsartsm\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Sanity check re: 8212\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Director- good morning!\n\n\nWe\u2019re facing some serious potential complications regarding 8212. I wanted to touch base with you to determine the \u2018limits of the possible.\u2019\n\n\nJust to sound out potential options, do you feel Site-48 would be capable of organizing the amnesticization of several hundred residents of Pierre and the deletion and archival annihilation of 2-3 news articles?\n\n\nSome additional minor containment measures might also be required; I\u2019ll send you a fuller writeup in 30 minutes, but wanted to get this to you relatively quickly to avoid going down the wrong path on this.\n\n\nBest,\n\nDr. Straschnov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Masha Straschnov (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm#noitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Site-48 Director Ahe Kahele (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|elehaka#noitadnuof.pcs|elehaka\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Sanity check re: 8212\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Masha\u2014good morning! (Use an em dash.)\n\n\nApologies if this comes off as frank.\n\n\nThese specifications are profoundly unrealistic, and their suggestion leaves me with grave doubts about your approach regarding 8212.\n\n\nIn answer to your question, this would nominally be within -48\u2019s capabilities, but would in all probability require substantial support from additional sites, to say nothing of massive budgetary overruns.\n\n\nTo take a step back, your career at the Foundation will run for far longer than one project. I completely understand that some projects may test the limits of a person\u2019s competence and ingenuity, and I care a great deal about making sure that all of my people are best positioned to thrive. If you find yourself unable to deliver on 8212, I\u2019d be happy to put a more seasoned hand in position there and pivot you over to something less taxing. For full transparency, I should specify that this process will likely involve corresponding decreases in pay grade and seniority.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t want that to happen, get a proposal to me by EOD that won\u2019t require me to call in support.\n\n\nAhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Masha Straschnov (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm#noitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Site-48 Director Ahe Kahele (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|elehaka#noitadnuof.pcs|elehaka\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n 05.14\u00a08212 proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Masha,\n\n\nCertainly far from perfect. I have no desire to get into the habit of signing off on anomaly release. Still, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve taken my feedback.\n\n\nConsider this my acceptance.\n\n\nAhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Judd Fessler (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|4relssefj#noitadnuof.pcs|4relssefj\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Masha Straschnov (\nnoitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm#noitadnuof.pcs|2vonhcsartsm\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n FW: 05.14\u00a08212 proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDING DING DING DING DING DING DING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 2, 2015:\n Following a complete panel of biological testing, Drs. Straschnov and Fessler confirmed that SCP-8212 was biologically and functionally identical to a non-anomalous human.\n\n\n\n\nJune 3, 2015:\n Dr. Fessler conducted an informal interview with SCP-8212.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of Interview (June 3, 2015)\n\n\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Still good so far.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Nice.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Just as a formality, you haven\u2019t identified any novel anomalous developments, have you? Biologically?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Nah. Except I piss pure radium. Will that be a problem?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n You\u2019re messing with me.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I\u2019m messing with you.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n So how does winning feel?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Good. It feels good. I\u2019m very excited to get back to my life. I mean, there\u2019s so much out there that relies on me, and I don\u2019t mind telling you that I was really, really scared.\n\n\n(Fessler snickers.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You don\u2019t think I\u2019m sincere.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n There\u2019s no need to get into that.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Not a lot of high paths open to me, are there?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Well, if I did a good deed out there, obviously it was to appeal to you. So it was a bad deed.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Were they \nnot\n done in part to appeal to us?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n This is what I mean. Yes, in part. But I \ndid\n need to appeal to you. You built a system where the only way to avoid causing massive, irreparable harm to people I \ndo\n genuinely care about was through appealing to you, and manipulating them.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n But you \ndo\n genuinely care about them?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Deeply. And hey, once you give me the chance to do good things, I will.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n How can we trust you on that?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Oh, you obviously can\u2019t!\n\n\n(SCP-8212 laughs.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Seriously, I know you want someone to say, oh, Judd, you did the right thing, don\u2019t worry. But even if I told you that right now, you wouldn\u2019t believe me. And if someone else told you, you wouldn\u2019t believe them.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Yeah. You\u2019re right. Maybe I should just put it behind me and walk out of the room.\n1\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Sure. But seeing as you\u2019re not going to, here\u2019s what I think, all right? At this time last month I was locked in partial existence, both innocent and in \nabsolute hell\n. Now I\u2019m going free and you tell me I\u2019m guilty. I\u2019m sure you prefer the former. I don\u2019t.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I think I understand.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You can think whatever you like.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n There\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get, though. We tracked you down by looking at noospheric connections within Pierre to the concept that you embody. If you\u2019d chosen a less distinctive appearance, or even left town, you would\u2019ve bought yourself a couple of days at least. It seems like, if you\u2019d done that, the odds that we\u2019d track you down would have been relatively minimal. We\u2019re well-resourced, but you were \nrecently omniscient\n. I have a hard time believing that, if you were even forty-eight hours ahead of the Foundation, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to run out the clock, allow for typical noospheric pollution to erase your tracks, and disappear into the wild for good. When you were up there, seeing everything, was there really \nno option whatsoever\n that didn\u2019t involve your passage into Foundation custody?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Oh, there were more options than stars in the sky. Really, Judd, the fact that the Veil\u2019s there at all is a miracle.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n That\u2019s comforting. If that\u2019s true, though, then why are you \nhere?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Well, when I told you I didn\u2019t remember my original gender, I was telling a little bit of a fib. The truth is that I was a \nlot\n of them. Parts of a lot of them. The Pattern tears through more than your flesh. I\u2019m a tiny little spoonful of countless pulverized consciousnesses. Sliced and torn. Left there for eons like a flayed man on a stretcher. I mean, Judd, try and imagine what that\u2019s like.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I don\u2019t think I can imagine it. Hell, I wouldn't want to.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Then what makes you think I like being able to \nremember\n it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 4, 2015:\n SCP-8212 was successfully amnesticized and released. She was provided with a rental for a rowhouse in a Pierre development owned by Statham Capital Partners, a Foundation front company. Special Containment Procedures for SCP-8212 were updated to read as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8212 resides in Pierre, South Dakota. She is presently employed as a cook. SCP-8212 is self-containing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2, 2015:\n Dr. Fessler was tasked with performing a post-release interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of Interview (July 2, 2015)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Morning.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Morning, ma\u2019am. My name\u2019s Paul Renford. You can call me Paul, of course. I\u2019m from the Statham Renter\u2019s Association. Do you have a minute?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Sure. But I do have to set out in about a half-hour.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n That\u2019s no problem.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n So, Paul, what can I help you with?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Well, we\u2019ve been having some complaints about your lawn. Lotta weeds, good bit overgrown, all that. You know your contract does require you to keep it at a certain aesthetic standard. We sent you a few emails about that, though we didn\u2019t get a response.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I never got any emails. What email do you have on file?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Is this one right?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n No, I\u2019m at GMail. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think that anyone uses HotMail anymore.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Ah, thank you. We\u2019ll update. And ma\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t good news. I'm coming to say that we\u2019ll probably have to level some fines.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Please tell me there\u2019s a way out of that.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Is everything all right?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n It\u2019s been a rough couple months, to tell you the truth.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Well, we do offer temporary exemptions. So why don\u2019t you just tell me what happened and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Boy, how long do you have?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Long enough.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Then you\u2019d better take a seat.\n\n\n(Fessler sits, as does SCP-8212.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n So I was visiting a friend in Fargo, and happened to be walking on back to the bus station, when I got pulled aside by an officer. He told me he was going to take me back to the station. He didn\u2019t ask where I was; he didn\u2019t seem especially interested in anything I had to say. He took my phone the second I got into the car. He didn\u2019t check my identification or anything. I was pretty quiet on the drive, I guess. I figured, hey, once I get there, we\u2019ll clear it right up. Then when I got there, they handed me over to someone else. No information on what I was being held for, no chance for a call, never even a chance to say my name. I never even entered the building. The handoff was in the parking lot. They just shoved me in the back of a van and drove way, way out.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n When they took me out of the van, I was complaining like nobody\u2019s business. But the two guys they had escorting me, they just had no patience for that at all. Didn\u2019t ask for my name. Didn\u2019t even fingerprint me. They just shoved me into a cell, by myself. Nothing but a goddamn slit in the wall. Plus a cot and a sink and a toilet. No windows. I was howling like a dog. But from the second I got there, to the second they let me out, I never talked with a single person. The meals came through the slit, and that was all.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I couldn\u2019t believe that a place like here had a place like that.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n The first day I was in there, I was sure that in about fifteen minutes, they\u2019d realize they\u2019d fucked up and give me the biggest, deepest apology you\u2019ve ever heard. But by day four I thought I was going to die in there. On day eight and twelve and seventeen I thought for sure that I was going to die in there.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Then the door opened on the twenty-fourth day. I thought it was the twentieth, because I had miscounted the meals. Back to the van, back to the station. They told me that they had thought I was somebody else. That was it, that was all. No compensation. Barely an apology. They just dropped me off at a corner like they were taking out the trash.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Holy shit.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Yeah. Sometimes I think about suing. But I talked with the folks down at Sloane Caine Peterson, and they\u2019re pretty sure that I don\u2019t have a case.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n That\u2019s definitely a surprise. \n(Fessler sighs.)\n2\n But I guess they know their stuff.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Maybe it\u2019s for the best. I really just want to forget about it.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I had to pay for my own Greyhound back.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n It should\u2019ve been obvious, but when I got back here, I found out that since the cops down in Fargo never asked who I was, they never told anyone where I was, either. So I was about a week and a half from an empty-box funeral. There\u2019d been a search party, all that. My mom said that when I texted her she fell and dropped her phone.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Jesus, you were the missing woman.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You saw it in the paper?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Yeah. Now I can see it, but before you told me I don\u2019t think I could have guessed.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Man, you\u2019d have been no help at all in the search.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Guess not.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n So I spent a couple hours of the first day back just calling everyone I knew and telling them I wasn\u2019t dead. But that was just the start of it. Rent was way in arrears. Had to put a whole month\u2019s worth on credit. The power got turned off, so all the food was spoiled, freezer and fridge. Missed a car payment; \nthat\n was a fun series of calls. The worst part was that I had a lot of stuff on autopay, so I was getting hit with overdraft fees every way you looked. My job was gone, too, but I work for Mitchell down at the Starlight, and Mitchell\u2019s a saint, so I was able to get it back pretty easily. Still, a lot of lost income. The whole thing left me five grand in the hole. If Mitch keeps letting me work doubletime I should be back above water by September, but, you know, a lot of stuff kind of fell by the wayside and I guess the lawn was one of them. I promise I\u2019ll get to it.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Jesus. Don\u2019t worry about the lawn for a second. I can promise you no-one\u2019s gonna fine you a dime.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Actually?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Actually. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Well, I really appreciate it. Let me know if there\u2019s ever anything I can do for you.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Don\u2019t worry about it. But a water might be nice.\n3\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Of course. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ve been sitting here this whole time and I haven\u2019t offered you anything.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Don\u2019t worry about it.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Is tap water okay for you?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Been drinking it my whole life, so I hope so.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You want ice?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Sure do. Thanks. Is that Chunky Monkey in the freezer?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You like it?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I do. You\u2019re a person of taste.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Kind of you, but I don\u2019t really eat it. It\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s favorite.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Boyfriend?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Yeah, boyfriend.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Got it. What\u2019s his name?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I appreciate everything you\u2019re doing, but if you\u2019re here to flirt I\u2019ll have to ask you to clear out.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Ah, that\u2019s my bad. I was just asking because my husband\n4\n and I saw you with this beautiful woman last week at McAllister\u2019s.\n\n\n(SCP-8212 laughs.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Do you ever get tired of being so nosy?\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Why would I get tired?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n I mean, I\u2019d just worry I was turning into a stereotype.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n That\u2019s a fight I gave up long ago.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You just never know who to tell in this town.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n You\u2019re telling me. I\u2019ve had more beards than a country band.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Anyway, my boyfriend\u2019s name is Kate.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Lovely name for a young man.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You let me know if you and\u2026\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Whit.\n5\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n You let me know if you and Whit ever want to come to dinner. Not right now, of course, but after August I should be able to get a couple evenings free.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I\u2019d like to, but we\u2019ll be moving away by then.\n6\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Ah, that\u2019s a shame. Where to?\n\n\n(Fessler stands up.)\n\n\nFESSLER:\n Say, I\u2019m sorry to keep you; I\u2019m sure you want to start getting ready.\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Yeah, it is getting to be time.\n\n\n(Fessler opens the door.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Good to meet you, and thanks again.\n\n\n(Fessler pauses for two seconds in the doorway.)\n\n\nFESSLER:\n You have a good life, all right?\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n And I hope you have one too.\n\n\nFESSLER:\n I mean it. You deserve it.\n7\n\n\n(SCP-8212 looks up and smiles.)\n\n\nSCP-8212:\n Paul. Don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019m having one now.\n\n\n(Fessler closes the door.)\n\n\n\n\nIn light of this interview, SCP-8212's amnesticization and false-memory insertion was found to have been wholly successful. Also in light of this interview, Dr. Fessler was banned from conducting interviews with anomalies for 12 months, except for anomalies currently under physical containment. Dr. Fessler was also obliged to undergo three or more sessions of grief counseling.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 3, 2016:\n Special Containment Procedures for SCP-8212 were updated to read as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8212 resides in Pierre, South Dakota with her wife.

        "POST-INTERVIEW DISCUSSION FESSLER: I\u2019m going to tell you something, and it\u2019s going to make you think substantially less of me. (Straschnov laughs.) STRASCHNOV: Don't worry. I agree with her too. FESSLER: There is something that bugs me, though. STRASCHNOV: That we\u2019d be batting for a pattern screamer? FESSLER: No. It\u2019s that she was omniscient very fucking recently. So she would\u2019ve known that we\u2019d be the ones to apprehend her. She would\u2019ve known that the day she was caught was the day we were up for a new placement. STRASCHNOV: If she checked the calendars, sure. FESSLER: Remember how she just walked into the van? STRASCHNOV: Oh. Oh God. She probably knew she would eventually get caught. So\u2026 so it picked its own jury. FESSLER: The Mitch stuff is nice. Chicken soup for the soul. But even that might have just been for our benefit. STRASCHNOV: What she did to Kate and the mom was probably entirely for our benefit. FESSLER: I won\u2019t say the obvious. But if you knew you were going in front of me, it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to be able to say, hey, I\u2019m the emotional lifeline for my depressed partner. STRASCHNOV: Depressed queer partner, specifically. FESSLER: I don\u2019t like to think I\u2019m that shallow. But it settled on this strategy when it was omniscient. If it thinks I am then I guess I am. STRASCHNOV: Just because it saw everything doesn\u2019t mean it understood. FESSLER: Boy, I wish I believed that. If anything, though, the only-child story was even worse. STRASCHNOV: I don\u2019t want to talk about that. The fact it\u2026 the fact it latched onto a woman who had gone through four of them just in order to endear itself to me. FESSLER: You know the worst part? STRASCHNOV: What? FESSLER: It is absolutely obvious that it saw vulnerable people, dug its claws into them, and used them to build a sympathy ploy that would convince us specifically to release it. But\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t even matter. There\u2019s still two people who rely so heavily on it. On her. That need is real. Even if her motives were insincere, and they were definitely insincere, we still need to judge the house she built on its own terms. (Silence for ten seconds.) STRASCHNOV: Even knowing what I know. Even knowing that it\u2019s playing into her hands. I would vote to let her go. FESSLER: Me too. But the kicker is that we can\u2019t do shit. Kahele\u2019s never going to go for any plan that involves anomaly release. STRASCHNOV: Would you genuinely be behind it? Fully? FESSLER: I guess I would. STRASCHNOV: Then I can take care of Kahele. FESSLER: How the hell are you going to do that?",
