My body is mine and mine only.\"\n\n\nAll personnel failing to do so are to leave the entry point under the threat of immediate termination.\n\n\n\n\nThe area in which SCP-5936 manifests has been acquired by the Foundation with a one-kilometer exclusion zone established around it. A disinformation campaign attributing the quarantine to a radiation leak has been devised and is to be disseminated to media and news outlets in nearby communities. All individuals extremal to the Foundation that attempt to enter the area must be denied access and directed to one of the surrounding towns.\n\n\nFollowing Event 5936-1, all action-planning regarding SCP-5936 has been moved to Site-120.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approximate location of SCP-5936\u2019s manifestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5936 is a spatial disruption occurring approximately 2 kilometers north of the town of Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland; the anomaly's interior is approximately 100\u00a0km\u00b2 \u2014 78% larger than the area of 56\u00a0km\u00b2 expected. Additionally, SCP-5936 can only be observed and entered by individuals that:\n\n\n\n\nAre non-religious,\n\n\nHave lost a close relative or friend\n,\n\n\nHave worked with or been a witness of occult phenomena.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever an individual is brought near the anomaly that does not meet the above criteria, they neglect its existence, claiming to only see a barren field\n1\n and expressing a desire to leave the area.\n\n\nAlthough scans and surveys of SCP-5936 have found no lifeforms inhabiting the area naturally, subjects who enter the anomaly have reported:\n\n\n\n\nSensations of being watched,\n\n\nParanoia of the presence of someone nearby,\n\n\nFeelings of immense, irrational hatred and sorrow.\n\n\n\n\nThe inside of SCP-5936 consists primarily of an urban topological district incorporating elements such as parking lots, playgrounds, shops, and a singular park. The weather within SCP-5936 will contain dense fog and clouds, despite the weather surrounding the anomaly. Additionally, once an individual has crossed the threshold into SCP-5936, they will find that the sun sits at a consistent 6\u00b0 altitude; indicative of ~ 17:00 (5:00 PM) in the area.\n\n\nSCP-5936-1 is a designation given to a currently unknown number of violent entities manifesting within the borders of SCP-5936. The anomalous humanoids bear the resemblance to distorted \nhomo sapiens\n and are heavily disconnected from local reality. For further information regarding SCP-5936-1 instances, see Addendum 5936-3.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park present within SCP-5936.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5936 was discovered on 21/02/1984 during Site-120's routine check of surrounding towns for potential anomalous phenomena. After five patients in local clinics were reported to have experienced hallucinations of a nonexistent district of the town, the Foundation was notified and an investigation regarding said reports was initiated. Multiple interviews with individuals supposedly affected by said hallucinations were made, and as a result, SCP-5936 was discovered shortly after.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5936-1 \u2014 Exploration Logs\n\n\nThe first exploration log of SCP-5936 was recorded shortly after the anomaly was detected. Due to the personnel requirements being discovered not long following initial contact, a special Mobile Task Force, Omega-5 (\"The Good Boys\") meeting them was created for the purpose of SCP-5936 research. In order to gather all information regarding SCP-5936, provisional Outpost-120-1 was created near the entrance of the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05936-1\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05936-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 16/03/1984\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Mobile Task Force Omega-5\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-5936\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Om-5-1\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Om-5-2, Om-5-3, Om-5-4, Om-5-5\n\n\nForeword:\n The exact properties of SCP-5936 were, as of then, unknown.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Recording's on.

I can see them from the corner of my eye.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n I can make a scan of the region to see who or what that is.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Then do.\n\n\nTwo minutes pass as Dr. Asheworth performs a scan of local terrain.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n No, no one's there. Are you absolutely sure you saw something?\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Yes, I am. W-wait, now they're gone. It-it doesn't make any\u2014\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Forget it. Spatial anomalies can fuck with perception, trust me.\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n That's weird. I think I saw it too.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n I would suggest you enter the building it was in, then.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Well\u2026 alright. Four and Three, we enter that building. Five, Two, you stay here. Try to see if anyone's around the block.\n\n\nOm-5-5:\n Alright.\n\n\nOmega-5 split up \u2014 Om-1, Om-3, and Om-4 enter one of the blocks of flats SCP-5936 consists of. The rest of the team stays near the entrance to the building.\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n Damn, this place is pretty run down.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n As are most blocks in this region. Nothing special, really.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Let's maybe save the talking for later.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n Fair enough.\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n While we're here, let's maybe see what's inside those apartments.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Good idea. \nVery quietly: Don't turn your head. There is someone watching us from that corridor on Four's right. Doc, are you absolutely sure there was no one here?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n My scans show nothing. I think it might be the influence of the anomal-\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n \nThis isn't stress, Asheworth. I know there is someone there, I can see it with my goddamn eyes, y\u2014\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n \nChill, man.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n \nNo, you fu\u2014 wait a goddamn minute, what's happening here? It's\u2014 Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, doc, I have no idea what got into me, I-\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Don't worry. This could be just anomalous influence. Does anyone else see that presence?\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n \nIt\u2026 it seems like it disappeared, again, I\u2026 I have no idea what\u2014\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Forget it. How about you enter one of those apartments instead?\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n Good idea.\n\n\nOmega-5 climb up the stairs of the building. They stop near the door to one of the apartments.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n Oi, doc, you seeing this? There's some sort of a, a\u2026 uhh\u2026 magic-ish symbol here.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Give me a moment\u2026 yeah, I see it.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n What does it mean?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Well, that's not how thaumaturgic symbols work\u2026 I'm not familiar with this one, hold on a second. Give me like three minutes, okay?\n\n\nTwo minutes pass.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n \u2026you absolutely sure? Alright. Well, let's begin with the fact that this should not be here. It's beyond old. I've only seen it used twice, at best. It's an amalgamation of two signs that, when combined, literally mean \"to open a gateway with a sacrifice\". Without the context of the full spell, I can't tell you what that truly means. Look around for more sigils like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill frame from Omega-5-1\u2019s camera feed depicting the unidentified symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Understood.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n Wait, it's here, too.\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n And here.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n Yeah, it's near every door.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Wait, isn't this a cross near them?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n That\u2026 that's weird. I've never really seen anything like that.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n I suppose that means we're gonna need to get into one of those apartments, am I right?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n You indeed are.\n\n\nOmega-5 enter one of the apartments. A TV can be heard in the background.\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n Doc, you \nabsolutely sure\n there is no one in the building?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n What? Yes, why?\n\n\nOm-5-3:\n There is an unfinished meal, still hot, just\u2026 just sitting there on the table.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n And the oven is still on.\n\n\nOm-5-4:\n So is the TV. It's\u2026 it's stuck it seems though. On one frame. It has a calendar for the year of 1952 above it, with uh, 27th of march being the final marked day.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n As I said, the previous scans have shown nothing. But if you insist, I'll do a full-spectrum one of the area including all of the anomalous sensors, but that will take a moment.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Understood.\n\n\nFive minutes pass. Nothing in the environment of the apartment changes, with the TV still showing the same frame and the meals not changing their temprerature.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Nothing. Again. There is literally not a single lifeform here. Not even bugs.\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n There's some weird shit going on here, doc. Normal places aren't just stuck in time.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Well, to be honest\u2014\n\n\nOm-5-1:\n Doc, it seems there \nis\n someone behind us.\n\n\nOm-5-2:\n I can see that, t\u2014\n\n\nOm-5-2 is interrupted by an unidentified scream.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Omega five?\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Omega five, do you copy?!\n\n\nRecording cuts.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to locate the potentially compromised Omega-5, a temporary replacement hereby referred to as Omega-5A for said group was created, and shortly after dispatched into SCP-5936.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05936-2\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a05936-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 18/03/1984\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Mobile Task Force Omega-5A\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-5936\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Om-5A-1\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Om-5A-2, Om-5A-3, Om-5A-4\n\n\nForeword:\n As standard lifeform scans prior to the exploration have shown an existence of such within the cellars of the block of flats where the original exploration log was abruptly cut, Omega-5-1 was ordered to research said place within the spatial anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Alright, check your equipment.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n All's fine.\n\n\nOm-5A-3:\n All well here.\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n And here.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Great. Asheworth, do you copy?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Loud and clear, a-one.\n\n\nOmega-5A leave provisional Outpost 120-1 and enter SCP-5936. They head for the building explored within the previous log as before and descent into the basement.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n Command?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Yes?\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n It feels, uhh, how to put it, well, much 'calmer' here. The feeling of being watched is just gone.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Which might mean we're onto something. Try to look around and much as you can.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n From what I can see, that's just your normal basement. Some food, this time absolutely rotting may I add, and some containers. Though\u2014\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Here's something.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Yes?\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Well, it's some wet journal pages from what I can see\u2026 most of it is some non-sensical gibberish\u2026 you seeing this, doc?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Yup. Well, those \nare\n thaumaturgic-ish runes, or at least runes stylized after the thaumaturgic ones, but it's too soaked for me to actually study it. At least from here. Also, may I add, it seems that there are some more signs here\u2026 I will say that I have never seen anything like this. When you get back, take it with you.\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Roger.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n Something here. Red candles and a candlestick.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Noted. Anything else?\n\n\nOm-5A-3:\n Hmm\u2026\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Nothing more here it seems. Though three out of five entrances to the other rooms are bricked off.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Go into the closer one then, and let's see what's there.\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Roger.\n\n\nOmega-5A come near the entrance to one of the non-blocked rooms.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Another rune. A bit different from the last one from what it looks like.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Give me a second then, let me get my notes on those ones\u2026 Got it. Alright, this one's supposed to be 'protection', as simple as that is. It's still written in a very old language, though. What about the inside of the room?\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n It seems that there's nothing more here than some sort of a cork board connecting different photos of the town. And a bunch of chairs around it.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n Some more notes here. Looks pretty similar to the ones from before, though.\n\n\nOm-5A-3:\n Other than that, it's just your regular basement stuff from what it seems. You know, potato sacks and stuff like that.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Alright, that only leaves the second room, then.\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Looks like today's your lucky day, doc. Another rune. Looks like the one from before, though. And another cross around it. This time, with a, uh, a message, I guess? \"The hand of the Lord shall protect you\".\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Hmmm\u2026 it's not the same. It looks almost identical, but the bottom part of the right side is missing, see? It's another one of those weird amalgamations of signs. Hmm\u2026\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n \nCoughs\n Oh my Jesus fucking Christ. \nCoughs\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n Eugh\u2026\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n It looks like we found the lifeforms you detected. Or, rather, their bodies.\n\n\nOm-5A-1's camera equipment zooms into a small pit dug in the room's floor. Inside of it, approximately twelve bodies lay.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Are they of Omega-5's?\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n I highly doubt it. They look nothing like them.\n\n\nOm-5A-2:\n It's mostly people with robes from what I see.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Do they have anything unusual on them?\n\n\nOm-5A-3:\n Yeah, got something. Another journal or pamphlet or something. Almost identical to the rest.\n\n\nOm-5A-4:\n Yep, this one has one, too.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Hmm\u2026 it seems it was a dead-end. Goddamnit. Alright, head back to 120-1, we'll think of something more.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Roger that.\n\n\nOmega-5A leave the basements and head out to provisional Outpost-120.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Uh\u2026 doc..?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Yes?\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n It seems that, uh, Omega-5 is here.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n What?!\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n They are just standing approximately ten meters from us. Not moving. It's\u2026 a-three, what the hell are you doing?! We have no idea what might be-\n\n\nOm-5A-3 attempts to walk towards Omega-5. At this point, an SCP-5936 entity manifests near Om-5A-3.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n A-three, leave the vicinity of Omega-5 and the entity, do you under-\n\n\nSCP-5936-1 starts to scream with a feminine voice, shaking violently.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Doc, we have a sit\u2014\n\n\nOm-5A-3 falls on her knees. She joins the screaming and shaking, which quickly stops. SCP-5936-1-1 does not stop to scream, with the tone of the voice hanging to a feminine one. It disappears. Om-5A-1 gets up from his knees and starts to walk towards the rest of the Mobile Task Force.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n a-three?\n\n\nSilence\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n A-three, do you copy?\n\n\nOm-5A-3's walking speed begins to quicken.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n A-three, if you do not answer right now, I will have to open fire, do you understand?!\n\n\nOm-5A-3 begins to run towards the group. Omega-5A open fire. Om-5A-3 laughs in a masculine voice.\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Doc, y-you saw that?\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n I did.\n\n\nFive more entities similar to SCP-5936-1-1 manifest near the group. They start to walk towards them. Omega-5 members de-manifest.\n\n\nDr. Asheworth:\n Boys, get the hell out of there!\n\n\nOm-5A-1:\n Let's go!\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the second exploration, all of the written logs found within the cellar were submitted to Dr. Asheworth's translation team.

The exploration was focused on the previously unexplored outskirts of the anomaly, but was cut short due to an increasing amount of SCP-5936-1 entities manifesting in the area. Though no casualties were recorded, a total of 27 previously unregistered anomalous humanoids were reported. No traces of Omega-5 were detected during the exploration. Though no notable discoveries were made, the team found deteriorated segments of a thaumaturgic circle around the borders of SCP-5936.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Translation\u00a0Addendum\u00a05936-2\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Translation\u00a0Addendum\u00a05936-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter extensive research into the nature of ancient thaumaturgic languages, my team and I were able to translate two-thirds of the article, leaving only the last part left. However, it appears that we have hit a roadblock as the language used in the final line is the oldest we have thus far encountered.

Dr. Asheworth, the project lead of SCP-5936 was, at that time, away in order to report to Central Europe Regional Director on his team's progress on the project.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. MacCarthy:\n \u2026and I believe that concludes my rant. I think that covers everything I wanted to say.\n\n\nJr. Res. Quinn:\n Of course. Thank you for your time, director. We will make sure to notify Doctor Asheworth about the translation once he gets back from the report mission.\n\n\nDr. MacCarthy:\n No need to thank, ha\u2014 M-Miss Quinn, should\u2026 should those entities be here\u2026?\n\n\nAt this point, a total of approximately 102 SCP-5936-1 instances manifest near the entrance to SCP-5936.\n\n\nJr. Res. Quinn:\n Uh\u2026 No, I don't think so\u2026 I will call the project lead to ask, if that's okay-\n\n\nJr. Res. Quinn pulls a phone from her pocket. She attempts to call Dr. Asheworth, only to get no response. She tries to do so three more times, with each of the attempts being denied.\n\n\nJr. Res.

Until the research on SCP-5936 and its nature is properly concluded, no exceptions to this rule are currently allowed.\n\n\n\u2014 Daniel Asheworth, Head of SCP-5936 Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 5936-3 \u2014 Further Research Material\n\n\nTo further understand the nature and properties of both SCP-5936 and SCP-5936-1 entities, multiple tests and interrogation missions were undertaken. The following are their reported results.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Additonal\u00a0Files\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SCP-5936\u00a0\u2014\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Additonal\u00a0Files\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SCP-5936\u00a0\u2014\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground interrogation for the location of SCP-5936\n\n\n\n\nIn order to ascertain the nature and location of SCP-5936 prior to the presumed ritual being carried out near it, a background check has been requested by its research team.\n\n\nInitially, no recordings of any inhabitants or even the existence of any sub-town area located within the area occupied by SCP-5936 existing in the past were found upon coming into contact with local archival offices and authorities. A detailed search revealed that no place had ever existed \u2014 plans of creating a sub-area almost identical to the landscape of SCP-5936 were in fact created in 1945 following the end of World War II, but were canceled due to a lack of budget reported within the yearly spending plan of the new communistic rule established upon Poland following the end of said event.\n\n\nHowever, when the local population census and the documents surrounding such for the years of 1952 \u2014 1984 was in-dethply studied by Site-120's RAISA employees, exactly one mention of a wanted individual know as Damien Nowak, originating from a nonexisting district of Cz\u0119stochowa referred to as \"Tysi\u0105clecie Dolne\", which would, as referred by in documents, be located in the exact location SCP-5936 manifests in.\n\n\nFurther background search on Nowak undertaken by Dr. Rivera, a member of the research team of SCP-5936 trained in memetic resistance, revealed that a district identical to the inside of SCP-5936 did indeed exist; backchecking on previously analyzed documents by Dr. Rivera yielded surprising results \u2014 every single one of them did discuss the existence of such a district; the information was, however, locked behind an antimeme.\n\n\nThe recovered data holds that Tysi\u0105clecie Dolne was an actual, existing place, holding the population for approximately 1200 residents, distributed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n200 men\n\n\n400 women\n\n\n600 children\n\n\n\n\nDue to the recentness of the building project when in the context of the recent ending of World War II ending prior to the even taking place, most of the population of Tysi\u0105clecie Dolne consisted of women and children. The population and the buildings were in great disrepair due to the military actions undertaken by opposing forces during the conflict. It is of note that the population had requested more capital for the purpose of building renovation from local authorities on multiple occasions \u2014 all of such were denied.\n\n\nThe current hypothesis constructed by the currently available material regarding SCP-5936, such as the ritual translation provided by Dr. Asheworth and external papers discussing the place, holds that the line in the poetic ritual instructions describing \"deleting a region\" should be interpreted literally; in result, the thaumaturgic action not only presumably killed the people located within the region, but literally deleted it and alongside all of the mentions of it from history.\n\n\nFurther research is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Additonal\u00a0Files\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SCP-5936\u00a0\u2014\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Additonal\u00a0Files\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SCP-5936\u00a0\u2014\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional material recovered from SCP-5936\n\n\n\n\nUpon taking the previously mentioned hypothesis into consideration, Dr. Asheworth personally requested more contextual material be attempted to recover from SCP-5936 in hopes of confirming or denying such. The project was successfully approved, and a UEV\n2\n was sent from local regional command to Site-120, where the research team gathered the needed materials and sent the vehicle into SCP-5936. Notably, the entities within such did not recognize the UEV as existing within their reach and did not react to the vehicle's actions.\n\n\nUpon in-depth exploration of the remaining buildings, an intact journal was found. The following writing from the journal has been translated from Polish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDamien wrote to me again this morning. Though normally, I wouldn't be surprised, this time he asked me for shelter. Normally I would of course deny, the food and water supplies are low even for as little as my men have here, but I couldn't just say \"no\" to my own brother. Not after all these years of separation from each other. Maria says it's stupid to let him near us after what he's done all those years ago, but it just feels wrong. Especially since he said that he has changed and that no longer will he practice\u2026 the forbidden arts.\n\n\n \n\nI'll have to think about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDamien and his troupe of freaks came last night. Of course, he couldn't resist his usual bullshit; everyone must know when he is in town. This time was a bit different though; his \"friends\" came with numerous gifts \u2014 meat, vegetables, and clean water. For all of these uneducated morons, they were glorious saviors that came to save them from the oppression of the \"government\". I'll let them think that for as long as I need to, but I know that something must be wrong. It's not like him to just help people profitless.\n\n\n \n\nWhen I asked him what all of that fuss was about, he said, and I quote \u2014 \"Greetings, my fellow brother! I come to you with peace!\". It's\u2026 it's not like him! He was ecstatic, clearly very happy at something, and\u2026 nice for once! He was babbling about how serving some \"Lord\" made him finally reunite with his previous enemies and give others happiness. I don't know if I should be afraid or happy or\u2026 I don't know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLast night, I caught Damien writing some weird symbols on the walls of my house with chalk. When asked about what that was, all he said was that I should not worry, since all he has ever done is to serve our Lord. I know he's lying, he never could just fit the rest and worship our God like the rest of us. Whatever he's doing, I'm sure it's nothing good \u2014 no normal person dresses like a religious guru for no reason!\n\n\n \n\nIt seems his freaks have permanently settled within our basement. It's not like I care, they don't eat anything and they don't litter, but I can't just sleep safely at night knowing that\u2026 these things\u2026 sit in my town. They don't seem right. Damien says something about them being \"sinners who decided to change their ways and return to the ways of the Lord\". Thankfully, they very rarely get out of their dwellings \u2014 and when they do, they mostly just patrol the outskirts of the town, not bothering anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDamien was writing weird stuff on the walls today again. When confronted, he said it's \"for the Lord's grace\" and that they mean protection in his \"language\". Initially, I obviously didn't believe him, but when nothing happened when a raid of our beautiful government's \"helpers\" didn't come, I just couldn't not believe him. Everything he said came true. Maybe he has truly changed. I\u2026 I don't know. It seems like those freaks he brought with him are\u2026 decent people too? They help us with our crops, and one of them saved Annie from drowning. I have no idea what to think anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMy people seem to absolutely love Damien. He has become their savior, their martyr, their\u2026 leader? It's sort of worrying how quickly he got popular, but I can't just not be happy my brother is with us, normal again. He is also\u2026 nice to everybody? It seems that even Herbert somehow enjoys his company. I\u2026 I've never been this torn apart in my life. Deep in my heart, I know he is a good person, but I can't just shake off the feeling of something being wrong. Though I feel like I'm alone in my emotions - everyone seems to have accepted him as a part of our community, which of course is a good thing, it's been a long time since that happened last time, but\u2026 I don't know. I'll have to think some more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLast night, I eavesdropped on Damien, hoping to find \nsomething\n on him. Nothing. Again. He just prayed and went to sleep. That's all. I\u2026 I was wrong, then it seems. Is Damien truly a new person? Everything leads me to believe so, but\u2026 I just\u2026 I don't know!\n\n\n \n\nEverything is of course going well since he arrived, as I said, and no one was even hurt. Not a single bad thing. Maybe something did indeed change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDamien is indeed a changed man. From when he arrived, nothing bad has happened to us. Every single oppressor that previously would bother doesn't even seem to notice us. Our plants grow faster and children are happier. When I asked him how this could be true, he just said \"You should trust me and Lord more, brother.\"\n\n\n \n\nI asked him to stay more with us, and he happily accepted the offer, saying that we will finally get some good time together. During today's dinner, he announced that in just three days, everything will change for the better; of course, he didn't say what would happen, but he said that \"the Lord will be pleased when he sees what will\" in an excited tone alongside something about \"ascending\" and \"leaving the human sadness and the limitation of our bodies behind\".\n\n\n \n\nI shouldn't be this happy, but I truly am glad that he finally found himself a good road in life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02.04\n\n\n\n\n\nI wa\n\n\nThe remainder of the page is empty, with only one spot of it being minorly damaged by what is presumed to be a pen's blade with ink surrounding it.

The action was immediately notified to the project lead and assessed for further research value when such an event did not happen again for the next two weeks. Three days following the action being reported however, the event repeated - this time with approximately 600 humanoids involved.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the audio created by the humanoids.\n\n\n\n\n[[0-14h]]\n unintelligible screaming\n\n\n[[15-25h]]\n nonsensical noices\n\n\n[[25-36h]]\n unintelligible screaming\n\nFollowing the finishing of this cycle, all of the entities demanifested.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it seemed that said audio was non-sensical and logic-lacking.

It was then discovered that the true sounds admitted by the entities were being blocked by an artificial, thaumaturgic force bearing message-encrypting properties, whose origin has been dated to 1956.\n\n\nThe true transcript of the messages is provided below.\n\n\n\n\nAll of the messages are being repeated within the written timeframe by an amalgamation of approximately 1200 different voices.\n\n\n \n\n\n[[0-14h]]\n H-hello?
