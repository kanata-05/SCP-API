This is to be carried out under the pretense that the area is too geologically unstable.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5797 is a ten acre lot (Provisional Site-23) occupied by the derelict Gas n\u2019 Go Truck Stop and Caf\u00e9 in rural Stevens County, Washington. At the time of Foundation discovery, there were twenty-one vehicles parked on the premises.\n\n\nCargo vehicles weighing in excess of two thousand kilograms\n1\n travelling within a six kilometer radius of SCP-5797 will undergo an OVERDRIVE-Class anomalous event.\n\n\nAt the beginning of an OVERDRIVE event, operators of the affected vehicle will lose control over speed, steering, braking, and any other functions typically reliant on manual attention. In the seconds following the initiation of an OVERDRIVE event, human occupants will undergo involuntary flexion and muscle contractions, rendering them incapable of communication. The affected vehicle will then travel autonomously in the direction of SCP-5797.\n\n\nSaponification\n2\n of flesh and organs begins approximately two minutes into the OVERDRIVE event. This affects not only human occupants but any livestock that may constitute the vehicle\u2019s cargo. By the time an affected vehicle has reached SCP-5797, all non-osseous organic matter within has broken down into a viscous protein slurry.\n\n\nAn OVERDRIVE event concludes when the affected vehicle has reached SCP-5797. Upon entering the lot, the vehicle will park itself in the nearest available space to its point of entry. All attempts to date at blocking a vehicle\u2019s journey to SCP-5797 have failed; even with considerable damage, an impeded vehicle will persist in its efforts to reach the lot.\n\n\nSCP-5797 first came to the attention of the Foundation on 2019/08/15. A spate of missing truck drivers in the Colville area led to local authorities discovering the associated vehicles on the SCP-5797 lot, along with biological remains. The truck stop had been closed for three decades prior to the first recorded OVERDRIVE event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Experiment\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nA number of test vehicles equipped with remote control systems were driven into SCP-5797's radius of effect. In all tests, on-board recording equipment failed shortly after the initiation of an OVERDRIVE event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTESTED VEHICLE(S)\n\n\nRESULT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMack Superliner wrecker and Ford LTL 9000\n\n\nAll fuel had been siphoned from the Ford prior to initiation; vehicle was attached to the Superliner wrecker and driven into the radius of effect. Ford broke free of wrecker and made its way to SCP-5797 in convoy with the Superliner despite its lack of fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeterbilt 379\n\n\nSuggestion that \nSCP-1872\n be used in an attempt to counteract the effects of OVERDRIVE scenario. Class-D volunteer was seated at the wheel of subject vehicle to initiate SCP-1872's anomalous effects. Attempts to divert vehicle away from the OVERDRIVE course failed. Though measures were in place to free human subject from the vehicle before saponification could occur, personnel were unable to reach the truck due to its increasing speed. Subject expired and the vehicle in question reached SCP-5797.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLVSR Heavy 10x10\n\n\nLayers of counter-terrorism barricade were installed along the route, with a heavy military vehicle selected for the test. Affected vehicle avoided the barricades and instead pursued an alternate off-road route through dense forest, uprooting hundreds of trees until entering SCP-5797 from the rear of the lot. This was the last time an OVERDRIVE event occurred; testing had caused SCP-5797 to reach its full capacity of forty-seven vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a02019/08/19\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a02019/08/19\n\n\n\n\nOn the morning of 2019/08/19, approximately twenty-four hours after SCP-5797 reached its full capacity, a geological event caused the collapse of Provisional Site-23. This was identified as a large sinkhole, encompassing the entirety of the site and surrounding terrain. All forty-seven subject vehicles had fallen into the hole, and a successful search and rescue operation was enacted to recover sixteen trapped personnel.\n\n\nThree hours later, personnel reported mechanical grinding sounds and tremors emanating from the sinkhole. Subsequent exploration was unable to locate any of the forty-seven vehicles; instead, a borehole with an opening measuring six by three meters was discovered in the south-west corner of the crater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT ON 2019/08/19, THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN REVISED\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CONTAINS AN UPDATED OBJECT DESCRIPTION AND APPROPRIATE CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES FOR THE ENTITY BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED THE COLLAPSE OF PROVISIONAL SITE-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5797\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\n\n\nThe clean-up operation following the destruction of Provisional Site-23 remains ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5797's length, and its anomalous properties, have made adequate containment procedures exceedingly difficult to implement. Research into a large-scale containment vessel that SCP-5797 cannot burrow through is ongoing.\n\n\nSCP-5797 is to be monitored using probe and drone equipment. Foundation personnel embedded in the oil industry are to be on alert for damage or disturbances which may have been caused by SCP-5797. The Foundation will provide appropriate reimbursement and cover stories on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nDue to the fact that SCP-5797 inhabits an area of frequent tectonic activity, tremors caused by SCP-5797\u2019s movements are to be blamed on seismic events.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5797 is a biomechanical organism consisting of forty-seven segments, each comprised of a semi-truck or a similarly-sized cargo vehicle. Segments are connected by an intricate lattice of both metallic and organic matter, granting SCP-5797 a significant degree of articulation. The front segment, a 1990 Kenworth equipped with an industrial snowblower, has adapted in a manner which allows the organism to burrow through rock and hardened soil.\n\n\nSCP-5797 is currently active beneath the Pacific Northwest of America; since its discovery beneath eastern Washington, the organism has been tracked as far south as Salem, Oregon and as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia. Travelling at an approximate depth of 1.6 kilometers and an average speed of thirty kilometers per hour, SCP-5797 approaches the surface only in the presence of pipelines (both off- and on-shore), rigs, and other sources of oil; it is believed that SCP-5797 relies on these for sustenance. The front unit of SCP-5797 doubles as a mandible, capable of piercing steel pipes, and is equipped with rubber tubing\n3\n through which the ingestion of oil occurs.\n\n\nSCP-5797 demonstrates an attraction only to man-made sources of oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log:\u00a0Clarissa\u00a0Boetticher\u00a02020/08/21\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log:\u00a0Clarissa\u00a0Boetticher\u00a02020/08/21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGert Boetticher in 1996, a year prior to his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Clarissa Boetticher\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Andrew Fields\n\n\nForeword:\n Clarissa Boetticher, whose late husband Gert had managed the Gas n\u2019 Go Truck Stop until its closure in 1989, was located by the Foundation at a retirement home in Astoria, Oregon. Gert Boetticher died of an aneurysm in 1997. Dr Fields was posing as an FBI agent investigating the now widely-reported disappearances\n4\n in rural Washington.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Hello, Mrs Boetticher. I\u2019m a Federal Agent-\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Yes, of course. From the telephone. Agent\u2026 Fields?\n\n\nDr Fields:\n That\u2019s correct. Now, I've got some questions regarding the site of your old business. General kinda stuff, but I won't dig too hard if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Oh, no. It\u2019s a pleasure. Not that I expect to be any use, if this really is another\u2026 another Bundy, like some folk are saying.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Now, ma\u2019am, don\u2019t let\u2019s start jumping to any conclusions. We\u2019ve yet to find anyone, deceased \nor\n alive. It's very much an active investigation, and we've got people working day and night on this operation.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n I heard your \npeople\n\u2019ve been snooping around the old Gas n\u2019 Go. You know, I always expected \nsomeone\n would\u2019a bought it, after Gert packed it up, and turned it into a strip mall or someth-\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Now, may I ask you about Gert? That is, of course, if you\u2019re comfortable with-\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n It\u2019s fine. Well, so long as you\u2019re not suggesting that Gert\u2019s got something to do with it.\n\n\nClarissa laughs nervously.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n That\u2026 would be something, wouldn\u2019t it? Nah, I'm kidding. Sorry to get all Mulder on you\u2026\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Well, I\u2019ve always said, \nmy old Gert died an angry man\n.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Angry? \nViolent angry\n, or\u2026\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Angry in his heart. The Gas n\u2019 Go, that was our lifeline. I ran the store, but Gert\u2026 he was the pumps. He was the garage. You rolled in with a flat on your Pete, you\u2019d roll right on out again with it all patched up and Gert wavin\u2019 in your rear-view from the forecourt.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n What made you give it up? The garage, the store, after all those years?\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Simple. The interstates. No need to turn off anymore, drive a semi four miles through the boonies just to grab some Lays and a tank of gas. Not when you\u2019ve got them brand-spanking new travel centers or whatever they call them. You have your BP, your Shell, you name it, and it\u2019s all right there on the highway. And \u2013 let me tell you something, Mr Fields \u2013 you don\u2019t got no chance when you\u2019re up against big oil.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Would you say Gert held a grudge, then? Against these corporations?\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Oh, something like that. Right up until he died, he\u2019d go on these rants\u2026 you\u2019d chalk it up to senility, if you hadn\u2019t lived with him for half your life.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n I must say, Mrs Boetticher, this is a decent place. Helluva view, as well. Pity there's too much fog to see the bridge.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n This was the dregs, Mr Fields, of what that garage earned for us. Eighty-nine is when we shut up shop, no kids \u2013 that ship had sailed \u2013 so we put what was left in the bank. It\u2019s just a pity that Gert\u2026 Gert didn\u2019t make it far enough to be here with me right now.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n I\u2019m sorry, Mrs Boetticher.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Well\u2026 that\u2019s life for you, I suppose. Ain\u2019t nothing you could have done about it. Hell, none of this is any use to your\u2026 investigation.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n I mean\u2026 we\u2019re gonna have to dig the old place up, Mrs Boetticher. What\u2019s left of it. On the off-chance something\u2019s\u2026 someone\u2019s buried under there. Just thought I\u2019d let you know, before we\u2026\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Actually, Mr Fields, one more thing. You'll find \nsomeone\n under there, but\u2026 it's not going to be any of the poor folk you're looking for.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Oh?\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n It's\u2026 when Gert died, we took him back there to, you know, rest. I hope that wasn't breaking any laws, or\u2026\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Environmental law is not my jurisdiction, ma'am, but it's my understanding you still owned the land at the time of his death.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n I just\u2026 I should have mentioned it sooner, Mr Fields. So used to trying to forget all about it, put it to the back of my mind.\n\n\nDr Fields:\n And that's okay. I know what it's like to bury a loved one.\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n Not\u2026 not like that. When we put him there, his body\u2026 his body\u2026\n\n\nDr Fields:\n Ma'am?\n\n\nClarissa Boetticher:\n It's like he started melting\u2026 the skin just drip\u2026 dripping away.
