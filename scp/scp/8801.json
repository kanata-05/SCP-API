SCP-8801 is capable of capturing experiential snapshots of a subject and their environment. Snapshots captured by SCP-8801 are brief and objective, and are stored digitally. The monitor object is currently undergoing preliminary testing prior to deployment. The test subject, a civilian human male designated SCP-8801-1, has been implanted with SCP-8801 since embryonic development.\n\n\nAddendum 8801.1:\n Project Update\n\n\nOn 2017/10/19, SCP-8801 reported that SCP-8801-1 suddenly ceased to exist, and initiated emergency shutdown. The original schematics of SCP-8801, as well as all snapshots captured by the monitor object, have subsequently undergone mild data corruption. A preliminary investigation found that SCP-8801-1 is currently alive and in ordinary condition. The cause of the breakdown is under analysis and data recovery operations are underway.\n\n\nAddendum 8801.2:\n Recovered Snapshots\n\n\nThe following snapshots have been recovered and translated into English by Juno.aic. Corrupted data is intentionally blanked out.\n\n\n\n\nDate: \u2002\u200299/\u2002\u2002/\u2002\u2002\n\nA transducer is applied over the belly. It is above SCP-8801-1.
