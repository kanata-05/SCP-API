Persons affected by SCP-6390 outside of controlled environments are to be detained indefinitely.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6390 is a novel neurological condition which causes affected organisms to conflate feelings of affection\n1\n with hunger and appetite. The consumption of living tissue temporarily suppresses the edacity caused by SCP-6390. SCP-6390 is equally likely to affect all sexualities and demographics.\n\n\nSCP-6390 exclusively affects members of the taxonomic class mammalia. SCP-6390 appears spontaneously in eligible populations; having one or more intimate relationships, whether platonic or romantic, is a prerequisite for the development of the disease. Prolonged socialisation with carriers of SCP-6390 weakly correlates with its appearance in affected individuals, indicating that there is some memetic component in its etiology.\n\n\nAddendum 6390.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-6390's first recorded appearance occurred on the 25th of June, 1990, in the Royal Melbourne Hospital's maternity ward. There were four casualties, two adult. A post-hoc analysis of similar incidents led to the eventual classification of the anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum 6390.2:\n Case Study\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0fileserv:/S:/6390/fileserv/casestudy\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\nThe following documents are believed to contain information about progression of the SCP-6390 condition as well as details about the actions taken by one or more of its infectees.

The suspect did not identify herself and made polite but flirtatious conversation, according to Ms. Asakku. After being propositioned, Asakku allowed the unknown individual to follow her home.\n\n\nThe suspect was described as being excessively intimate, which Asakku attributed to a state of intoxication. During a moment of close physical contact, the suspect unexpectedly assaulted Asakku by tearing at her shoulder and cheeks her teeth, after which she \u2018suckled\u2019 upon the victim\u2019s open wounds, drawing out an amount of blood.\n\n\nAsakku lapsed into unconsciousness at this point and was discovered at 6:03pm by her roommate.\n\n\nFollowup:\n Investigation discontinued (Code M22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of a voicemail\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 12/11/21, 8:33pm\n\n\nRecipient:\n BSc E.S.

I understand, though. Your emotions can get the better of you, and I'm okay with that. That's why you love me, right?\n\n\nCaller:\n You don\u2019t have many acquaintances outside of work. If you\u2019re not talking to your coworkers or to me, you must be venting to your exes and school-friends. Those relationships were toxic. You shouldn\u2019t burden them with your personal drama.\n\n\nCaller:\n You can\u2019t survive on your own. When I first met you, you were reclusive, depressing, antisocial.

According to testimony by one of Gold\u2019s acquaintances, Fiona Proasheck (F, 27), the two women had spent the night frequenting bars and leisure establishments.\n\n\nWhile drinking at the Raven & Sitch nightclub, Gold encountered a woman whom Proasheck described as being \u2018roughly [her] age, tall and dressed like she was going to work\u2019. This woman, the suspect, stayed with Gold for the rest of the night and made repeated advances on both Gold and Proasheck, the former of whom responded with enthusiasm. Proasheck noticed faint red stains on the suspect\u2019s collar and the periphery of her sleeves but declined to comment. At 1:36am, Proasheck decided to return to her place of residence, leaving Gold with the suspect.\n\n\nThe victim\u2019s tongue was traumatically severed at its root and a large amount of flesh was avulsed from her lips and gums. Traces of facial cosmetics foreign to the victim were found on the intact surfaces around her mouth. Death occurred by exsanguination at approximately 2:05am.\n\n\nFollowup:\n Investigation discontinued (Code M22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of a voicemail\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 13/11/21, 6:08pm\n\n\nRecipient:\n BSc E.S.

Notably, tissue of the hands and adipose of the calves. Though some of the removed material could not be accounted for, several large chunks of macerated flesh belonging to the victim were found inside a wastebasket in the bathroom, coated in human saliva.\n\n\nAn incision was made along the victim\u2019s wrist. Shallow tooth marks were found around the wound, alongside an unusual blood smearing pattern. Generally, the wounds on the victim\u2019s body are consistent with those generated by an individual with a moderate degree of surgical skill and anatomical finesse, with few to no instances of purposeless or otherwise disorganised trauma.\n\n\nThe victim was killed by a deep stab wound to the throat, made while sitting down and presumably facing her attacker. The front door was also unlocked, with no indication of a break-in.\n\n\nFollowup:\n Investigation discontinued (Code M22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of \u201cereth730306.mp4\u201d\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 14/11/21, 11:36pm\n\n\nDuration:\n 1:13:03\n\n\nInterlocutors:\n BSc E.S. Retherford, Dr J. Vanth\n\n\n\n\n[The film occurs from the perspective of Retherford's cell phone, tucked into her breast pocket. It depicts a river and the railing of a small stone bridge. It is night time, and raining. The area is heavily forested and no buildings are visible. Retherford is standing outside of a car. For upwards of an hour, the perspective does not shift.]\n\n\nVanth:\n There you are.\n\n\n[The camera pivots toward the figure of Dr Vanth, who is standing at one end of the bridge. She is holding an umbrella and wearing opaque gloves. Retherford inhales deeply.]\n\n\nVanth:\n It was easy enough to find you, after you stole my car. The police were only too happy to help.\n\n\n[Retherford grasps her forearm, which comes into frame briefly. It is covered in bandages.]\n\n\nVanth:\n Don\u2019t be like that. You've done worse to me.\n\n\n[The camera moves away from Vanth, who takes a step forward.]\n\n\nVanth:\n Stop running. You\u2019re an awful spouse, you know that? You don\u2019t listen, you don\u2019t want to reconcile, you just go on these ridiculous runaways. What are you, eight years old? And you came back to the bridge where we had our first kiss, of all places. I know you\u2019re still thinking about me.\n\n\n[Vanth furls her umbrella and takes off her gloves. A dark red substance is visible beneath her fingernails.]\n\n\nVanth:\n You\u2019re gorgeous, Evelyn. Such a sweet and flavoursome person.\n\n\n[Retherford draws a steak knife and points it at Vanth.]\n\n\nVanth:\n I can see that you\u2019re thinking about it. But once I\u2019m gone, what\u2019ll happen to you?\n\n\n[Vanth continues to walk forward.]\n\n\nVanth:\n You have nobody to rely on now. Nobody but me.\n\n\n[Vanth places the tip of her sternum against the end of Retherford\u2019s knife. She gently pushes the blade aside.]\n\n\nVanth:\n I really do love you.\n\n\n[Retherford lowers her weapon and weeps softly. She embraces Vanth for several seconds. The camera lens is obscured by clothing and hair. Vanth emits a quiet gasp, which is followed by a wet tearing noise and a shuffle of fabric. The video abruptly ends at this point.]\n\n\n\n\nDr Vanth\u2019s remains were found on Route 6B in Delamere Forest, Cheshire alongside her mobile device. Large amounts of flesh had been crudely removed from her lips, cheeks and upper torso, with tooth marks found in her finger bones and jaw. ~2 grams of oral musculature\n2\n with genetic markers belonging to Retherford were found inside her mouth. Retherford herself could not be located.\n\n\nAutopsy of Dr Vanth\u2019s body discovered that at the time of her death, there were severely elevated levels of dopamine and serotonin in her brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
