At the discretion of the project supervisor (currently Dr. Sara T. Kothari), compatible SCP-6314 instances may be allowed to share enclosures temporarily or indefinitely. All instances are to receive at least two hours of social interaction, either with other instances or Foundation personnel, each day. See individual entries for special containment procedures unique to specific instances. Special containment procedures for individual instances override the general containment procedures here if contradictory.\n\n\nAs of current regulations on \"Amazing Alliterative Animals\", SCP-6314 are to be contained in Hall \u2588\u2588 of Site-66. To prevent possible [\nDATA EXPUNGED\n], all 25 instances are never to be contained in the same facility.\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0archived\u00a0procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that \nHypothetical Lifted Veil Scenario 2217\n has been realized, all contained SCP-6314 instances (with the exception of SCP-6314-W) are to be released from Foundation custody. Dr. Kothari has been entrusted with the task of redistributing SCP-6314 to the custody of appropriate groups and individuals.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-6314 is the collective designation for a set of 25 anomalous animals which appear to have been designed as pets for children. Each instance is of a different species and displays different anomalous qualities, but all possess the following traits in common:\n\n\n\n\nNegligible senescence.\n Though adults, SCP-6314 do not appear to age or grow.\n\n\nCellular regeneration.\n SCP-6314 rapidly regenerate from physical injuries.\n\n\nPerfect health.\n SCP-6314 have never contracted any illnesses, pathogenic or otherwise.\n\n\nAnomalous diet.\n SCP-6314 do not appear to require either food or water to survive, but become increasingly uncomfortable after long periods without either. Instances will consume food appropriate to their species or any form of commercially available pet food, typically preferring the former. Regardless of diet, no waste is produced; food and water vanish upon reaching the instance's stomach. Carnivorous and omnivorous species refuse to consume other vertebrate animals; those capable of speech universally claim that doing so would be \"gross.\"\n\n\nEnhanced intelligence.\n Many instances display intelligence roughly on par with a human. Said instances are also fluent in English, though most are illiterate.\n\n\nDomestication.\n SCP-6314 are universally docile and friendly toward humans, especially children.\n\n\nBranding.\n All instances bear markings somewhere on their bodies which spell \"[instance's name], by Dr. Wondertainment\". Each instance was recovered alongside, or able to produce when asked, a variation of the same document. Reproduced below is the version that accompanied SCP-6314-S, the first instance contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow!\n You've just found yourself your very own Amazing Alliterative Animal, a brand new series of Fantastic Friends and Perfect Pets brought to you by Dr. Wondertainment!\n\n\nFind them all and complete the Zany Zoo!\n\n\n01.

As these objects are presumably no more dangerous than the instances that are in containment, and would therefore qualify for the anomaly release program were they contained, efforts to locate them have been abandoned.\n\n\nAttached is a relevant log of messages between Dr. Kothari and Site-66 Director Louis Martin.\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIPNET COMMUNICATION LOG\n\n\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\n10 instances of SCP-6314, over one third of them, remain uncontained. We've got decent leads on -A, -G, -r, and -X, but the other six are complete unknowns. I therefore recommend that the remaining instances be located, contained, and documented before those currently in containment are released.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nBased on the instances currently in containment, it can be safely assumed that the others are no more dangerous than non-anomalous animals. As such anomalies would qualify for the release program were they already in Foundation custody, attempting to contain them in the first place would be counterintuitive.\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nWhile the remaining instances of SCP-6314 may not be a threat to human life or the nonexistent Veil, they may themselves be in danger. Although these animals are immortal, they are nonetheless capable of suffering. If the unknown instances are in the possession of groups who are mistreating or exploiting them, it is our obligation to protect these creatures by removing them from such situations, even if it is just to redistribute them to better homes.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nThe welfare of objects not requiring containment is beyond the scope of the Foundation's mission.\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nConsider, then, the psychological well-being of the instances that are in containment. Several instances have expressed a desire to reunite with the rest of their \"family,\" and claim to miss their \"siblings\". They will all be negatively affected by the redistribution of instances to different locations, but I believe that allowing them all to briefly reunite beforehand (while ensuring that all 25 are never in the same facility at once, of course) would mitigate this effect somewhat by providing some sense of closure to them.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nThe \"psychological well-being\" of objects not requiring containment is beyond the scope of the Foundation's mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-C sleeping in its habitat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapua'a in Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapua'a's aquarium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-N being held by \nResearcher James (age 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-C is a male \nHydrochoerus hydrochaeris\n (capybara). The air within a 2.4-meter radius of the object remains at a constant 21.1 degrees Celsius regardless of other conditions.\n\n\nHubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapaua'a is a male humuhumunukunukuapaua'a. Cannot be referred to with pronouns, nicknames, abbreviations, or other terms that do not contain the word \"humuhumunukunukuapaua'a\". References to groups of which Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapaua'a is a member (such as \"SCP-6314\") are not affected by this property.\n\n\nSCP-6314-J is a male \nAurelia aurita\n (moon jellyfish). It lacks stinging cells, and patches of dark pigmentation on its bell form the shape of a \"smiley face\".\n\n\nSCP-6314-N is a male \nNeurergus kaiseri\n (Kaiser's mountain newt). When held by a human and instructed to \"Clean my room!\" the object telekinetically moves nearby waste and dirty laundry to the appropriate receptacles.\n\n\nDue to their animal-level intelligence and relatively mundane properties, SCP-6314-C, -H, -J, and -N were entrusted to GoI-466 (\"\nWilson's Wildlife Solutions\n\") for appropriate care and potential future adoption. For the sake of simplicity, Drs. Kothari and Carlson delivered these instances to WWS personally, and were assigned a Foundation-owned Tesla Cybertruck for this purpose.\n\n\nAudio and video below, and elsewhere in the file, was recorded by Drs.

Kinda surprised the car still has it, honestly. All the good stuff's on streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA man emerges from the WWS building, hastily putting on a raincoat.

Surfboard not pictured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-I is a male \nAmblyrhynchus cristatus\n (marine iguana). The object can perform a variety of \"tricks,\" including various feats of acrobatics, dancing, and singing, but is reluctant to do so before large groups, claiming \"stage fright\".\n\n\nSCP-6314-T is a male \nTamandua tetradactyla\n (southern tamandua). The object can telekinetically manipulate bodies of water and its surfboard\n3\n to perform assorted tricks. Both instances are capable of speech, though SCP-6314-T possesses an exaggerated Southern California accent.\n\n\nDue to their human-level intelligence and desire and ability to perform \"tricks,\" SCP-6314-I and -T were entrusted to \nHerman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting\n. Though the Circus was not located near Site-66 at the time, its liaison Victor Chan offered to send Circus representatives to the Site via Way.

It seems, however, that this is not the case, as SCP-6314-O was removed from containment by a Global Occult Coalition representative this morning, before I arrived. I did not have a chance to assist in this transfer of custody, brief the GOC rep about the object, or inspect the conditions in which it would be transported and kept to ensure the object's safety. I do not object to SCP-6314-O's transfer to ICSUT, but I do object to this apparent override of my authority on this object, and I sincerely hope that this is the last time such a thing will occur.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nYou approved the transfer and ICSUT and the GOC filed all the necessary paperwork. The transfer proceeded without you because your presence was not required.\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nWhile I did approve the transfer, I did so under the impression that I would be able to personally supervise it. It is my job to ensure that SCP-6314-O is kept secure and protected both during the transport and at his new home, but I have been denied this opportunity. I fear that SCP-6314-O may come to harm in my absence.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nAs I said, your presence was not required. ICSUT and the GOC are fully capable of caring for SCP-6314-O, as you attested when you first approved this transfer.\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nI just wanted the chance to say goodbye. Don't take that away from me too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnable to determine context or content of above photograph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-P is not believed to exist, as everyone knows there is no such thing as a pangolin.\n5\n The purpose of its inclusion in the document that accompanies other SCP-6314 instances is unknown. It is likewise unclear why a habitat for a small mammal was constructed between those of SCP-6314-O and SCP-6314-Q, when this occurred, or who was responsible. When this chamber was first noticed by Researcher Carlson, it contained the following items:\n\n\n\n\nvegetation normally native to tropical areas\n\n\ntraces of powdered ant remains, various vitamins and minerals, and agar\n\n\nthe following note:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know pangolins were once the most trafficked mammal in the world? Well, you used to. They were being killed by the thousands, during the War. People ate their ground-up scales, thinking that would cure the Red Death. They almost went the way of the elephant. But you didn't do a thing about it. You had in your hands something that could save the whole pangolin family, but all you did was keep him as a pet. Even after the Veil lifted, that's all you had in mind for him. You were going to give Percival to Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and let the rest of them die.\n\n\nLucky for the pangolins, I decided to intervene. It wasn't easy to alter his effect like this, but it was worth it. Now, instead of being the most trafficked mammal on the planet, they're probably its safest. That includes Percival - he's safe with me, and you needn't worry about him anymore, even if you do somehow manage to remember that he exists.\n\n\nBy the way \u2013 \nMel\n (you know, the moose) wanted me to tell you that xe's perfectly safe and happy where xe is. Liv is fine, too, from what I hear.\n\n\n- L.S.\n\n\nP.S. - Don't think that the Hand is gone just because the Veil is. We're glad that you've released your prisoners, but you'd better stay on your best behavior. We're still watching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs everyone knows there is no such thing as a pangolin,\n6\n it is believed that this note constitutes some form of subterfuge or attempted deception by \"L.S.\"\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-8\n\n\nSCP-6314-Q is a male \nEquus quagga quagga\n (quagga). It possesses no notable properties beyond those shared by all instances.\n\n\nAs SCP-6314-Q is potentially immortal and one of only (at time of writing) three living quaggas, it has considerable conservation value. After experimentation with a female quagga\n7\n determined that the object's offspring do not inherit its anomalous properties, all specimens were entrusted to the \nQuagga Project\n for use in quagga re-breeding efforts.\n\n\nLogs relating to the transfer of SCP-6314-Q's custody have been omitted, as they did not involve notable interactions with sentient anomalies or Groups of Interest.\n\n\nUpdate:\n Shortly after SCP-6314-Q's transfer, the Quagga Project and all its assets were acquired by Marshall, Carter, and Dark LTD. All quagga specimens, including SCP-6314-Q, were relocated to an unknown location, and the object's whereabouts remain unknown. Dr. Kothari was not informed of this development, as it occurred after the events of Addendum 12.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-S posing for the camera in its habitat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-S is a male \nLampropeltis elapsoides\n (scarlet kingsnake). Though intelligent and capable of speech, its vocabulary consists almost entirely of words beginning with the letter \"s\". It possesses a cognitohazardous effect that limits speech directed at the object to such words.\n\n\nSCP-6314-V is a female \nMicruroides euryxanthus\n (Sonoran coral snake), though scales that would normally be red on a non-anomalous coral snake are instead a vivid violet hue. Instance has similar properties to SCP-6314-S, but related to the letter \"v\" instead of \"s\". Unlike other SCP-6314 instances, -V is generally hostile toward humans, particularly those it perceives as authority figures. However, Dr. Kothari has gained the instance's trust over time and with the assistance of SCP-6314-S.\n\n\nSCP-6314-S and -V share a close emotional bond and are able to communicate with each other nonverbally. For this reason, and because SCP-6314-S's presence seems to have a calming effect on -V, both instances were contained in the same habitat.\n\n\nMuch like SCP-6314-K, SCP-6314-S was slated for adoption by retired Foundation personnel. SCP-6314-V was deemed unacceptable for adoption or transfer to GoI custody, however, as its human-level intelligence, venomous nature, general hostility, and documented anarchist tendencies made it non-negligibly more dangerous than a non-anomalous animal.\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIPNET COMMUNICATION LOG\n\n\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nWhile SCP-6314-V is normally hostile towards people, I have been working with her for years and have gained her trust and cooperation over that time. Additionally, SCP-6314-V is consistently less aggressive when in the presence of SCP-6314-S, the instance with whom I have the most experience. I therefore propose that these instances simply be kept in containment. Although this would be an exception to the anomaly release protocol, I feel that it is a justifiable one, given the unique relationship between these two instances.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nI cannot allow exceptions to the release program for such a trivial reason. There is no reason -S cannot be adopted, and Site-66 is well-equipped to contain -V, with or without any marginal decrease in hostility due to your presence or -S\u2019s.\n\n\nSara Kothari\n\n\nI still feel that separating both instances would be detrimental to the mental health of both, leading to an unnecessary increase in -V\u2019s aggression levels. To avoid this undesirable outcome, I propose that they both be released from containment and entrusted to my custody. For reasons previously stated, I believe that I am the ideal caretaker for both instances.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nI cannot grant this request. -S is to be released from Foundation custody, including the personal custody of active Foundation personnel.\n\n\nLouis Martin\n\n\nAdditionally, please note that transfers to the custody of retired personnel would also be subject to my approval, and that it would be inappropriate for a retired employee to adopt an object whose containment they previously supervised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogged below is Dr. Kothari's initial attempt to separate SCP-6314-S from SCP-6314-V.\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log\n\n\n> RECORDING STARTED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari enters the shared enclosure of SCP-6314-S and -V, which are curled in the corner under a sunlamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nSalutations, Sammy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-S\n\n\n'Sup, Sara!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari sits down on a large rock.

Director Martin granted this request, on the condition of no further delays in the redistribution of SCP-6314 instances.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W in storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W is the vacant shell of an unknown species of sea snail. When the shell is asked a question, the voice of an elderly male speaks from within and provides general advice in response. Object remembers content of previous conversations.\n\n\nDue to its general usefulness, and to prevent the future assembly of all 25 instances in the same location, SCP-6314-W will remain in Foundation custody. Reassignment to other personnel or permanent storage is pending, but it remains in Dr. Kothari's possession for the time being.\n\n\nBelow is a transcript of the last recorded conversation between Dr. Kothari and SCP-6314-W.\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log\n\n\n> RECORDING STARTED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWilhelm, are you there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nI'm always here for you, Sara.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nI'm confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nWhat about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nThe other animals. Your siblings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nBecause you don't know where to send them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nNo. Well, yeah, I\u2026I don't know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nBecause you don't \nwant\n to send them there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[sighs] Yeah, I guess that's it. I don't want to send you all away. You're like family to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nLoss is an inevitable part of life, Sara. Terrible, but inevitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nI know, but\u2026it shouldn't have to be, at least not for you. You all live forever. You should able to spend forever together, shouldn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nPerhaps, but that isn't really what you want, is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[pause] No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nThen what do you want?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nI want you all to spend forever with \nme\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nBecause we are like family, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nRight. I've spent what, twelve years with you all? Almost the whole time I've worked here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nIt's been a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nAnd so, losing you like this\u2026I can't take it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nNow, Sara, isn't that kind of selfish?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nWhen Dr. Wondertainment made us, we were intended to bring happiness to many people. Not just you, and not just each other. Isn't being separated the best way to do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n\u2026fine, yeah, I guess it is selfish. But that doesn't change the way I feel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nOf course not. And how, exactly, do you feel?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nUm. Sad? Lonely?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nAfraid, perhaps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYes, afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nOf what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nOf losing people I care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nHas this happened to you before?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[scoffs] Of course it has. You said it was inevitable, remember?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nLet me rephrase, then. Of the times that this has happened, which one does this feel like the most?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWell, that's easy. [deep breath] When I was a little girl, I had a pet beagle. Her name was Maria, like the Santana song. She was the cutest darn thing I ever saw. And I loved her, I think, the same way I love you guys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nAs a pet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n\n\nAs a friend. But\u2026ah, but I didn't appreciate her. I don't know how many days Maria was out there in the yard, but I was inside playing video games or watching TV. I should've been out there with her, playing with my friend instead of wasting our time together, but I was stupid and - well, selfish, I guess. So when Maria got sick, I felt sad, yeah, but the main thing I felt was regret. Regret that I didn't spend more time playing with her when she was around. Regret that she died scared and alone in a vet's office, instead of old and content and surrounded by her family, even though there wasn't really anything I could've done about that. I didn't even get to see her afterwards. They just burned her and stuck her in a box. It was just\u2026so\u2026horrible. No closure or anything. I didn't even get to say goodbye. She was just\u2026gone. And now it's happening again. I'm having to give you away, but I'm not ready to lose any of you, because I want more time.\n\n\nDon't you have something to say?\n\n\nAnything at all?\n\n\nI thought you were supposed to be wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nSara\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nThere are no easy answers to questions like this. Parting is always difficult. No amount of goodbyes, and no amount time spent together, will change that. If anything, that will just make it harder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nBut it doesn't \nhave\n to be goodbye, does it? It \nshouldn't\n be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nI'm afraid that it does, Sara. If what you've told me is true, then there's not much you can do about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[tearfully] Well, you're a lot of help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nI'm sorry, Sara. But if it's any consolation, \nI\n don't think this time was wasted. And I don't think my siblings do, either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nOh yeah?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nIt's been twelve years, you said? Since you found Sammy at that pet store?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nAlmost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nNow consider this: We weren't created much longer ago than that. Many of us never had any owner besides you. You've been here almost our entire lives, and you've been taking care of us this whole time. Sure, some of the others weren't here until later - like Vivian, she was the last, wasn't she?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nThink of Vivian. You know she didn't have a good life before you brought her here. But she likes you, doesn't she? Do you understand the significance of that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nThere are only two beings in this whole world that Vivian likes. Sammy, and you. She likes Sammy because they were made that way, but her love for you was earned. And do you know how that happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nHow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nBecause you were the best owner that she ever had. That any of us ever had. You care for us better than any zoo, pet shop, or aquarium could, or any other person ever has. And it's not just a matter of feeding and cleaning us. You care \nfor\n us, but you also care \nabout\n us. We're your friends. And you are ours. The years we've spent with you have been the best of our lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[sniffs] Mine too. But I want \nmore\n years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nSo do we, Sara. But we're needed elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[sighs] I know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-W\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nI'm sorry too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> RECORDING ENDED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y reciting \"Sailing to Byzantium\" in its outdoor enclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y is a male \nBos grunniens\n (domestic yak).

Yeats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nThings fall apart. The center cannot hold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari hangs her head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYep. They sure [chokes up] do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nLassie?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari bursts into tears and sits heavily on a nearby rock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nOh dear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y approaches Dr. Kothari and nuzzles her with its snout. Dr. Kothari rubs SCP-6314-Y's neck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nThat's alright. Just let it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nIt's just - I'm - it's not fair!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nI know, I know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nThey're taking you all away from me, and I'm never gonna see any of you again!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nIt's alright, Sara. We're moving on to where we're needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nBut \nI\n need you, Yancy! Your family is my \nlife\n. And now I have to give it all away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nAw, that's sweet of you to say, but we're not that-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nTwelve years, Yancy. \nTwelve years\n. That's how much of my life I've dedicated to taking care of you all. You're my world. But now they're taking you away, and I don't even recognize the world anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nEverything's so\u2026different. We're working with our enemies now. The Circus is out in the open, and people love it. There are Maxwellist churches on the streets. Hell, they fixed the Broken God, and everything was \nfine\n! I feel like\u2026I \nknow\n we were wrong. All this containment shit, it was never necessary. What am I supposed to do now? Everything I thought was wrong. The world feels like it's moving on without me. It's like you said, \"things fall apart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nWell\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nThat quotation is sometimes taken out of context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nOf \nThe Second Coming\n? I've read that, I know-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nNo, not that. The context of Yeats's philosophy, the whole \"gyre\" thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat about it? Everything starts at a point, then spirals outwards into ruin. \"The center cannot hold.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y shakes its head\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nNo, no, that's not how it works. Well, not completely. See, look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y uses its hoof to draw a two-dimensional representation of a widening spiral, as viewed from the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nThis is a gyre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nBut so is this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y draws another spiral, beginning at the end of the previous one but opening in the opposite direction so the two of them overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nOkay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nAlright, so - [SCP-6314-Y taps its hoof at the edge of the gyre.] - we're here. Right at the end of this one gyre. But we're also at the beginning of the other one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nI mean, the spinning, the widening, it goes both ways. One gyre spins out into nothing, but another takes shape within it. And this one tightens while the other widens. So it's not just an endless spiral into ruin and despair. It's more of a-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nA cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nYeah! Or a pendulum, or something. So yeah, this might be the end of the world. But it's also the beginning of one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[sighs] I \nknow\n that, Yancy. The problem is that the new world is different. I'm not sure I \nwant\n to live in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nWell, you don't exactly have a choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari places her face in her hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[sighs] You're even less helpful than Wilhelm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nWait, uh, that came out wrong. Just, just hold on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[peers over her hands] What?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nLook, all I'm trying to say is, the world's not ending. it's just changing. Cuz \nthat's\n the nature of things - to fall apart, yeah, but also to come back together. And, well, if everything else is changing, so can you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari lowers her hands and sits up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYeah? And how am I supposed to do that? Quit the Foundation? Join the Circus? Hop over to the nearest church of Maxwell and get a freakin' computer implanted in my head? I don't even know what my job is for anymore! How can I protect normalcy when there is no normal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nAh, that's not true. There's still a normal. Just a new one\u2026one that, if what you've said to me is true, doesn't really \nneed\n protecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari appears confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nWhat are you saying?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6314-Y\n\n\nWhat are you hearing? [SCP-6314-Y winks]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari's eyes widen. She glances at her EyePod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> RECORDING ENDED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, SCP-6314-Y struck Dr. Kothari's EyePod with its horn, destroying it. The object claims that it did so accidentally while shaking its head to dislodge a fly. It responded to all further inquiries with various vulgar quotes of W.B. Yeats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6314-12\n\n\nThe footage transcribed below was compiled from Site-66 security cameras and Researcher Carlson\u2019s EyePod.\n\n\n\n\nshow\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\nhide\u00a0attached\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log\n\n\n> RECORDING STARTED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari exits SCP-6314-Y\u2019s habitat at the hallway. There is no one else present in the SCP-6314 unit, except for Researcher Carlson, who was working late in his office (located opposite Dr. Kothari\u2019s, just inside the entrance to the 6314 unit). Due to the late hour, the hallway lights are on energy-saving mode; each light flickers on as Dr. Kothari passes under it, and turns off after she passes. She proceeds quickly from -Y\u2019s habitat to the one shared by SCP-6314-S and -V.\n\n\nResearcher Carlson does not seem to hear Dr. Kothari's movements; he is listening to music\n9\n via his cranial implant and quietly singing along.\n\n\nAfter several minutes, Dr. Kothari exits the habitat. The door to the habitat closes loudly behind her, and she startles at the sound. In his office, Researcher Carlson looks up from his computer screen. His EyePod is resting on a bookshelf behind him, looking out the doorway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nSara? Is that you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari does not reply. She hurries toward the exit and tries to open the door, stopping clearly in view of Researcher Carlson, but she drops her ID card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nShit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nUh, Sara?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\u2019s grabs her ID and stands back up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nY-yes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nUh. Uh. I was just, uh\u2026visiting Sammy and V-Vivian before I\u2026before they\u2026uh\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\u2019s right sleeve moves briefly. She attempts to conceal it behind her back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nSara?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari swallows nervously. She is visibly shaking.\n\n\nResearcher Carlson begins to turn around, towards his EyePod, but stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nAre they okay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[Dr. Kothari nods quickly] Y-yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\nAre you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari takes a deep breath, then nods once raises her chin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\n[resumes facing forward] Good. I'm glad. [deep breath] So this is good\u2026night, then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\nYes. [clears throat, softly] It is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson\n\n\n[nods] Okay. Get some rest, Sara. You've earned it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari\n\n\n[smiling faintly] Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kothari quickly exits the 6314 wing and then the building altogether. She climbs into her personal vehicle and departs from the Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> RECORDING ENDED <\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Carlson did not discover that SCP-6314-S and -V had been removed from their chambers until he arrived for work the following morning. Once he reported their absence, and that Dr. Kothari had not arrived at work, agents were dispatched to her place of residence to detain her and retrieve the instances. Dr. Kothari's apartment had been vacated the night before, with most valuables and personal effects removed, as well as Dr. Kothari's vehicle. The vehicle was later discovered in Portland, Oregon, near a known access point to Three Portlands. Due to the low value of, and little danger presented by, the missing instances and the estimated difficulty of recovery, no further efforts to retrieve them are planned at this time. Active efforts to capture Dr. Kothari have likewise been abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. In addition to the instances described here, 30 similar animals associated with the \nletters of the Cyrillic alphabet\n have been discovered in predominantly Russophone countries. The Russian branch of the SCP Foundation supervised containment of Cyrillic instances until the fall of the Russian Federation during the Second War of the Flesh, at which point custody was transferred to the \nDepartment of Abnormal Threats to the Security Service of Ukraine\n. WonderCo representatives have confirmed that there were once plans to create Alliterative Animal series for multiple languages, but only the English and Russian sets were produced before post-Veil restructuring led to the project's cancellation. As the Cyrillic instances are already in GoI custody, the remainder of this document concerns only the English series.\n\n\n2\n. Non-sentient biomechanical organisms reverse-engineered from the remains of \nSCP-131\n, programmed to follow and record on-duty Foundation personnel in order to improve record-keeping. EyePods visually resemble smaller (15\u00a0cm in height) instances of SCP-131 but are colored standard Foundation gray, and locomote via hovering instead of wheels. By the year 2025, all Foundation personnel level 1 and above were each assigned an EyePod.\n\n\n3\n. A miniature version of a standard-sized board, colored purple and bearing the Dr. Wondertainment logo. This board was in SCP-6314-T's possession when it was contained.\n\n\n4\n. Presumably, the billboard in question was displaying a recruitment advertisement for the \n2030 Spacex/NASA Mars colonization mission\n. \"Get your ass to Mars\" was the advertising campaign's primary slogan, typically accompanied by a drawing of a donkey wearing a space helmet.\n\n\n5\n. This statement has been flagged for potential antimemetic corruption.\n\n\n6\n.
