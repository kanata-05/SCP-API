Excess \ndorayaki\n produced by SCP-4742 is to be used for feeding of sustenance-requiring anomalies.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4742 is a 1.5\u00a0m tall plastic statue of the character Doraemon from the Japanese franchise of the same name. SCP-4742 produces one hundred loaves of \ndorayaki\n1\n per day at varying intervals from a small aperture in its abdomen, which is deposited into its \"pouch\". Examination of the inside of SCP-4742 reveals that it is composed of machinery designed for the manufacturing of \ndorayaki\n from its raw ingredients. The source of these ingredients is unknown; therefore, it is believed that SCP-4742 violates the law of conservation of mass. Attempts to observe the process have failed due to the fact that SCP-4742 halts production of \ndorayaki\n when not fully intact.\n\n\nThe \ndorayaki\n produced is non-anomalous; however, those who consume it report it to be of exceptional quality.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n On 2008-09-28, SCP-4742 was lost following a Chaos Insurgency raid on Site-11. Efforts to relocate SCP-4742 are deemed low-priority.\n\n\n\n\nView next unlocked revision\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
