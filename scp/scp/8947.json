Foundation security personnel posing as local law enforcement are to monitor the perimeter and apprehend any civilians who breach it.\n\n\nPer Protocol Montezuma-11, should there be a disparity in the amount of gold produced by the incorporeal entities within SCP-8947 and the amount of gold required to slow SCP-8947-A\u2019s growth, a ration of gold bullion is to be provided to Foundation containment personnel to offset the disparity. In the event that a given quantity of gold produced by these entities does not prove sufficient, Foundation Protocol Montezuma-11\n1\n dictates that the following must take place:\n\n\n\n\nThe incorporeal elements of SCP-8947 must present their accumulated gold to SCP-8947-A, which they do every Sunday night at roughly 22:51 hours local time. This presentation lasts three minutes and six seconds.\n\n\nOnce the entities have finished their presentation, there is a thirty-three second period of inactivity from SCP-8947-A.\n\n\nAfter this period has elapsed, one of two events will take place:\n\n\n\nSCP-8947-A will remain inert, and all incorporeal elements of SCP-8947 will disappear. This is considered an \u201cinactive\u201d state, and it is safe to end Protocol Montezuma-11.\n\n\nTremors beneath SCP-8947 will become increasingly violent. These tremors will be accompanied by a dense, green haze from within SCP-8947-A, the consistency of which is inconclusive but is inimical to humans\n2\n. This is considered an \u201cactive\u201d state, and requires the initiation of Protocol Montezuma-11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of an \u201cactive\u201d state, three different events must take place to inhibit the growth of SCP-8947-A.\n\n\n\nA human child, between four and six years of age, must approach the edge of SCP-8947-A with a basket of 10 gram gold bullion bars. The child must then be made to throw individual bars into SCP-8947-A, at a rate of one bar every thirty seconds until the end of the event. Every time the child throws a bar, they must say the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dFor what we have wagered against our souls, so must we repay in gold.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother similarly aged human child must accompany each gold bar with a handful of salt, thrown out of a burlap bag, while speaking the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dFor how we have festered so long in the darkness, so must we repay in salt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, a third child must have both of their wrists cut perpendicular to their arm with a blade\n3\n, and be made to bleed out over SCP-8947-A until the end of the event. An adult human must stand near the child and repeat the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dFor the innocence we have stolen, so must we repay in blood.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the discrepancy between the amount of gold required by SCP-8947-A and the amount of gold offered by the incorporeal entities within SCP-8947 has been resolved, the tremors will cease and the green haze will dissipate. After this, it is safe to end the protocol, and tend to any medical necessities.\n\n\n\n\nFoundation psychologists and game strategists are to continue to analyze the pattern of events that occur within SCP-8947 in order to better optimize them to neutralize any potential activation states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of only three remaining images of the Spirit Mountain Hotel from 1921.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromotional material originally published in Las Vegas newspapers regarding the Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino:\n\n\nStep Into the Height of Elegance at the Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino\n\n\nExperience unparalleled luxury and excitement at the Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino, an awe-inspiring destination nestled near the picturesque Laughlin, Nevada. Built by visionary billionaire Alejandro Giuseppe Bianchi Tagliaferro II, this sprawling 86,800 square-foot entertainment facility offers a harmonious blend of opulence, innovation, and entertainment in a setting as grand as the American West itself. Whether you're seeking relaxation, fine dining, or thrilling games of chance, Spirit Mountain promises an unforgettable escape.\n\n\nThe hotel stands as a beacon of refinement, featuring 186 exquisite staterooms spread across fifteen floors, each appointed with lavish furnishings and modern comforts. For those seeking the pinnacle of indulgence, our exclusive penthouse suite on the top floor provides sweeping views of the rugged desert landscape, complete with private roof access. After a day of adventure, unwind at our stylish cocktail lounge and jazz club, where the finest musicians set the tone for enchanting evenings.\n\n\nFor culinary delights, dine at the Restaurant Nevada, an architectural marvel perched dramatically on the mountain\u2019s edge. From intimate dinners in one of five private suites to lively performances on the stage, every moment here is steeped in sophistication. The crown jewel of the restaurant is the Overlook Suite, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding desert as you savor world-class cuisine. Finally, thrill-seekers and high-stakes players will find their haven in our ornate casino, a five-story masterpiece featuring games of chance beneath a dazzling open atrium. The Spirit Mountain Casino promises fortune, excitement, and memories that glitter as brightly as Nevada\u2019s stars.\n\n\nMake the Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino your destination today\u2014a place where every moment is a testament to life\u2019s finest pleasures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the Spirit Mountain Hotel published in 1918.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8947 is the group designation for any anomalous activity within the abandoned former Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino near Laughlin, Nevada - specifically, its weekly cycle of anomalous activity.\n\n\nOnce a 8,060m\u00b2 entertainment facility built by billionaire entrepreneur\n4\n and occultist\n5\n Alejandro Giuseppe Bianchi Tagliaferro II in 1911, the structure suffered severe structural damage after an earthquake and a fire destroyed a significant amount of the hotel and casino during a seasonal gala event in the spring of 1922, resulting in the deaths of over 230 individuals.\n\n\nSCP-8947 is inhabited by a number of semi-incorporeal\n6\n humanoid entities, all of which bear the group designation SCP-8947-1. These entities are grey, mostly featureless\n7\n, humanoid representations of patrons of the hotel who perished the night of the earthquake. These entities wear unique outfits typical of the 1920\u2019s upper class, though these outfits show significant wear and, in some cases, are barely recognizable as apparel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior of SCP-8947.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach SCP-8947-1 entity has a unique identity and is sentient, as they are capable of speech and are generally self aware. They will interact with individuals within the hotel and casino as if they were fellow patrons of the hotel, but will respond negatively if the individuals are not dressed in period appropriate clothing and speak using period appropriate mannerisms. Beyond these interactions, SCP-8947-1 instances appear to follow a rough pattern of events\n8\nand try to complete a certain set of actions before the Montezuma-11 event Sunday night. While these events typically take place with minor variations\n9\n, Foundation personnel are able to slightly alter their behaviour through conversation and interaction with the instances. After the Montezuma-11 Protocol takes place, the SCP-8947-1 instances disappear, reappearing on the next Thursday morning at 08:00 local time. While it appears that SCP-8947-1 instances can recall events from previous cycles\n10\n, they typically do not address this, even if asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion affected by expansion of SCP-8947-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947-A is a large fissure located in the center of the casino, roughly 28m in length and 6m across at its widest point, which extends indeterminately deep into the earth below\n11\n. SCP-8947-A is the focus of containment efforts within SCP-8947, as it routinely undergoes activation events, wherein the instances of SCP-8947-1 must make a gold offering to SCP-8947-A. If the offering is not of a suitable value\n12\n, SCP-8947-A will begin to increase in size, resulting in severe tremors and structural damage to the surrounding hotel and casino. These activation events can only be terminated by proper fulfillment of the Montezuma-11 Protocol, which brings an end to any geological activity and begins a period of inactivity.\n\n\nCurrent projections indicate that further expansion of SCP-8947-A is an inimical threat to the Davis Dam in Laughlin, Nevada, a structure that dams the Colorado River and sits on the southernmost end of Lake Mohave. Previous failed instances of the Montezuma-11 Protocol have resulted in significant geological activity that has destabilized the foundation of the dam, and it is likely to cause unrecoverable damage if seismic events continue.\n\n\nThe failure of the Davis Dam would threaten all persons and structures within the low-lying area of the Mohave Valley, including Riviera, Mohave City, Fort Mohave, and the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation, as well as the resorts and riverfront property of Lake Havasu City. Additionally, failure of the Davis Dam could result in a cascading failure of the Parker Dam to the south, which itself would likely cause severe damage and loss of life to the towns of Cienega Springs, Parker, and the Mohave Road farms on the California/Arizona border near the Colorado River Reservation.\n\n\nProtocols have been developed to mitigate the potential loss of life from a failure of the Montezuma-11 Protocol, but currently no procedures exist that can assure a 100% survival rate of all potentially affected persons in the event of a failure of the Davis Dam, as it is currently estimated that a minimum of one-hundred and ten thousand persons would need to be evacuated in the span of only a few hours, and it is unlikely that the persons in the Mohave Valley area could be evacuated in time at all.\n\n\nAddendum 8947.1:\n Hotel and Casino Layout\n\n\nThe Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino is comprised of three primary structures, each linked to the other through a series of hallways and open-air breezeways. The first and largest, just within the main entrance, is the hotel. It is composed of fifteen floors with one-hundred and eighty-six guest staterooms, with the top floor containing a single penthouse and exposed roof access. On the main level of the hotel is a bar, as well as a cocktail lounge and jazz club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasternmost edge of SCP-8947-A within the casino - image taken from the second floor. A first floor room is visible below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the west of the hotel is the \nRestaurant Nevada\n. It is composed of a large dining room, two bars, five private suites, and a stage for performances. In the back of the restaurant is the kitchen, much of which was destroyed by fire. The primary feature of the restaurant is the Overlook Suite, which extends out over the edge of the mountain.\n\n\nTo the southwest of the hotel is the casino. It is a five story ornate structure with an open atrium in the center, once covered by a large glass dome. The casino contains a number of various games of chance, including card tables, roulette, and slot machines. On the main floor of the casino is a caged cashier\u2019s desk, through which chips can be exchanged for gold.\n\n\nOver time, due to seismic activity from SCP-8947-A and exposure to the elements, the entirety of SCP-8947 has fallen into a state of considerable disrepair. Several areas are no longer easily accessible, or have been destroyed altogether. One room, the penthouse suite within the hotel, cannot be accessed whatsoever, and attempted access from the exterior with shaped charges, as well as through the roof or through any ductwork, inevitably ends in failure. SCP-8947 appears to exert some sort of anomalous influence on these attempts, as the walls themselves do not appear to be impervious\n13\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA deeper section of SCP-8947-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, SCP-8947-A has made several areas of the casino lower levels inaccessible. SCP-8947-1 instances who are directed towards these lower levels, or SCP-8947-A in general, will become increasingly upset and agitated, though most are either unable or unwilling to describe why.\n\n\nAddendum 8947.2:\n Discovery\n\n\nIt is uncertain when SCP-8947 began to display anomalous activity. The fire that broke out and destroyed a significant portion of the structure was reported in the Los Angeles Times, due to the presence of Nevada Senator Dean Blacklock at the gala event. However, after initial investigations of the structure revealed no immediate foul play the building was abandoned, likely due to its remote location.\n\n\nIn 1962, two teenagers filed a police report in nearby Laughlin after seeing what they described as interior lights flickering and a green smog surrounding the structure. Investigators were not able to find any evidence of trespassing at the structure, and the case was abandoned.\n\n\nIn 1970 a female motorist claimed to have gotten lost on her way to Lake Havasu City from Las Vegas, and ended up at the Spirit Mountain Casino after dark. The woman claimed to have seen a thick green haze billowing out of the lower levels of the structure, and a single light on in the top floor of the hotel, where the silhouette of an individual was visible through the curtains. Additionally, the woman claimed to have heard shouting from within the structure, and to have felt some considerable seismic activity. After seeing what she described as \u201cbodies floating in the mist\u201d, the motorist fled on foot, eventually being picked up by another passing motorist. Local police discovered her car several miles down the road, nowhere near the gated road leading to the hotel. The woman\u2019s story was dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation agents in protective gear exploring the upper sections of SCP-8947-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, a locally televised ghost-hunting program \u201cDemon Hunters\u201d gained permission from the state government to access the facility for one night, in order to record an episode of their show. The episode never aired, and no members of the production team commented on its absence afterwards. However, an anonymous internet user claiming to be a member of the program\u2019s staff (and providing provable details of their employment with the television network) posted several times over a six month period on an internet message board for the amateur supernatural watchdog group \u201cKnights of Truth\u201d. In their posts, the user claims that members of the production team were exposed to spectral entities who begged them for gold, salt, and blood, even going so far as attempting to attack one of the hosts. The event apparently shocked the crew so badly that it was decided that the program would not air the footage, which was later destroyed.\n\n\nIn 2007, Foundation assets embedded in the local authorities investigated another claim of supernatural activity at the hotel, and were met with the SCP-8947-1 entities. After deducing the nature and structure of SCP-8947, a permanent forward operating base was established outside the structure.\n\n\nAddendum 8947.3:\n Protocol Montezuma-11\n\n\nProtocol Montezuma-11 was developed by a joint team of Foundation occultists, game theorists, and historians. It was originally believed that the origin of the fault within SCP-8947 was natural and it was only the SCP-8947-1 instances that were anomalous - however, study of information collected from within SCP-8947, specifically the hotel and casino, as well as sigils and markings from within the fault itself, led to the conclusion that SCP-8947-A was a result of paranatural influence upon the earth itself emanating from within the resort.\n\n\nThe intended result of Montezuma-11 is to mitigate the final cost in gold to satisfy the conditions of the activation event. This includes subtly guiding SCP-8947-1 instances into situations and relationships that will be financially lucrative, and making sure wealthy individuals (or those who carry with them a large amount of wealth) are alive and present for the end of the event on Sunday night. Until the Foundation became involved in SCP-8947's containment it is believed that the success of the Sunday night ritual was entirely up to chance\n, though the growth of SCP-8947-A does not accurately align with the expected growth given the likelihood of a successful outcome on any given week\n (\nNote: This information is now believed to be outdated. Further investigation is required.\n)\n\n\nThe secondary intention of Protocol Montezuma-11 is to further investigate the cause of SCP-8947's creation, the origin of which is thusfar unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Blake Cannon, pictured in 1920.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Head Researcher Kayla Rider's notes:\n\n\nWhile there are on average just over four hundred potential SCP-8947-1 instances, there are only a handful that can cause a notable change in the outcome of Protocol Montezuma-11. We have, over time, removed several individuals from this list - most recently one Victor Constantin Dragomir, the son of a Romanian diplomat. While Mr. Dragomir does serve a useful purpose within the established protocols as a source of gold, his value is relatively stable and cannot be influenced too far above its starting position, but \ncan\n end up far lower than where he begins. He is a \nhorrifically\n bad gambler and almost seems anomalously unfortunate. He is better left alone, where he will spend small amounts of money on games of chance and otherwise be uninvolved with the larger narrative developing over the weekend.\n\n\nThe most recent addition was Wilma Blacklock, Senator Blacklock's wife. She was originally believed to be an unimportant if not narratively interesting minor player, but the number of times she has killed her husband after discovering his infidelity has resulted in a significant amount of resources being devoted to figuring out how to keep her from doing that. While her killing her husband is not quite as disruptive as Mr. Murray having Mr. Avery killed on Saturday morning, it is still a huge issue when it happens. The only exception to this is if it occurs on Sunday morning, at which point the hotel becomes swarmed with various law enforcement and reporters, all of which become involved in the ritual Sunday night. This \ncan\n be beneficial, but as Senator Blacklock himself carries a pretty significant amount of wealth on his person it doesn't always balance out.\n\n\nThe very first person who was added to this roster was, unsurprisingly, Vince Cannon, who plays a pivotal role in the final confrontation Sunday night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8947.4:\n SCP-8947-1 Instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlejandro Giuseppe Bianchi Tagliaferro II. Image dated to August 1909.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach instance of SCP-8947-1 corresponds to a different individual who perished the night of the earthquake and fire. While many of the instances are relatively unknown invites to the gala event, several individuals were particularly noteworthy. Their identities, actions and behaviours are listed below. For ease of access in the timeline detailed in Addendum 8947.5, each individual has been given an identifier name.\n\n\n\n\n\u201dThe Senator\u201d Dean Blacklock:\n State Senator from Nevada. Attended the gala to curry favor with the wealthy Tagliaferro in order to secure funds for his upcoming campaign for Governor. 54 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Senator\u2019s Wife\u201d Mrs. Wilma Blacklock:\n The wife of Senator Blacklock. Deeply unhappy with their marriage, only keeping up the charade for appearances. 46 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Capitalist\u201d Mr. Vince Cannon:\n Owned a major publication in Las Vegas. Had previously run several hit pieces on Tagliaferro before accepting the invitation. 44 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Singer\u201d Ms. Layla Williams:\n The talented young daughter of famous jazz singer Ezekial \u201cBig Daddy\u201d \u201cZeke\u201d Williams.

Murray:\n The younger brother of the wealthy owner of the TransAmerica Railroad, Chester Murray. 48 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Heiress\u201d Mrs. Elizabeth Yates-Moore:\n The wealthy daughter of Leeman Yates, founder of Yates Prospecting\n14\n and wife of the late movie producer, Gerald Moore. Recently widowed. 58 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe D.A.\u201d Mr. Winston D. Snider:\n The Clark County district attorney and personal guest of Tagliaferro. 52 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe D.A.\u2019s Wife\u201d Mrs. Irma Snider:\n Winston Snider\u2019s wife. A deeply religious woman. 50 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Journalist\u201d Mr. Clark Avery:\n A writer with the New York Times and former Army photographer, received an invitation through his employer, Adolph Ochs, who was an old friend of Tagliaferro. 27 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Big Winner\u201d Mrs. Heather Jasper:\n A divorcee from Sacramento, notable as winning a jackpot in 99% of all scenarios on the opening night. 44 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Banker\u201d Mr. Vernon Wells:\n A banker from Reno, Nevada. 37 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Groundskeeper\u201d Mr. Walter Baker:\n The groundsman. 68 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Server\u201d Mrs. Olivia Phillips:\n A server at the restaurant. 26 years old.\n\n\n\u201dThe Chef\u201d Mr. Geno Bellucci:\n A famous chef, works in the restaurant. 62 years old.\n\n\n\n\nIn total, 256 individual instances of SCP-8947-1 are present within SCP-8947. Three individuals were reported dead but are not present within the SCP-8947-1 instances, these being Alejandro Tagliaferro, his granddaughter, Emilia Fitzwilliams, and an individual listed as \u201cA. Shaw, M.D.\u201d\n\n\nAddendum 8947.5:\n Timeline of Major Events\n\n\nNote: The following is an optimized timeline (the \"Opportune Scenario\") of major events throughout the weeklong cycle that SCP-8947 continuously loops through, presented in four hour blocks starting at 08:00 on Thursday morning. Many of these events are still under investigation. Notes detailing situational variations are included in the footnotes.\n\n\nThursday\n\n\n\n\nThursday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\nThursday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nAll attendants who begin within SCP-8947 appear spontaneously, immediately beginning their actions for the day.\n\n\nThe first guests (Mr. Harvey Beaumont and his fiance, Ms. Eva Goldstein\n15\n) arrive and are checked in.\n\n\nGeno Bellucci and his staff begin to cook lunch. He expresses dissatisfaction with his new server, Olivia Phillips, who is late.\n\n\nWalter Baker, the groundskeeper, meets with the rest of his staff to assign duties for the day.\n\n\nOlivia Phillips arrives to work, a half hour late. She attempts to hide from Geno Bellucci, and is unable to. Geno scolds her for her tardiness, and threatens to fire her if she\u2019s ever late again. Mr. Clark Avery, a writer, notices this exchange as he passes by.\n\n\n\n\n12:00 Local Time:\n\n\n\n\nBy noon, another hundred guests have arrived. The hotel manager (Mr. David Peaks) announces lunch in the grand hall of the hotel. Once inside the hotel grand hall, the patrons take their seats and focus on an empty, raised stage at the front of the room. Based on the attention given to this, it is likely that someone is speaking to the assembled group, who occasionally laugh and clap enthusiastically. However, no figure ever appears on the stage\n16\n.\n\n\nAfter the individual at the front of the room finishes speaking, the wait staff serves lunch. Senator Blacklock spends the majority of his mealtime moving around the room, shaking hands. His wife leaves halfway through the meal.\n\n\n\nMrs. Blacklock\u2019s absence is usually followed by the absence of another server, Enrique Ides. It is unknown how - if at all - the two know each other, but Mrs. Blacklock follows Mr. Ides to a broom closet in the casino where they have sex. Their absence goes unnoticed\n17\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Wells, a banker, strikes up a conversation with Mr. Murray, the brother of a wealthy railroad mogul, about Alejandro Tagliaferro\u2019s wealth. They are joined by Mr. Snider, the Clark County district attorney. Notably, Mr. Wells appears distressed by Mr. Snider's presence\n18\n.\n\n\n\n\n16:00 Local Time:\n\n\n\n\nAfter being dismissed from lunch, many of the guests leave to go to the casino or the pool. Mrs. Blacklock, accompanied by one of Senator Blacklock\u2019s friends' wives, goes to the bar by the pool. Geno Bellucci spends ten minutes admonishing his staff for their lax attitude about lunch. Senator Blacklock, Mr. Cannon, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Murray go to the Casino.\n\n\nThe groundskeeper, Walter Baker, goes to the first basement level to put away some gardening equipment. While down there, Baker discovers a door he had never noticed before. After trying all of his keys on it, he leaves it, confused\n19\n.\n\n\nOlivia Phillips, while washing dishes in the kitchen, is visited by Mr. Clark Avery. They speak briefly about her new job and Geno Bellucci\n20\n, before Mr. Avery is called away.\n\n\n\n\n20:00 Local Time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayla Williams, in a publicity photograph from 1921.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayla Williams \u2013 The Jazz Siren of Spirit Mountain\n\n\nStep into the golden glow of the Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino and let the enchanting voice of Layla Williams carry you away. Daughter of the legendary Ezekial \"Big Daddy\" Williams, this radiant songbird has taken the jazz world by storm, captivating audiences from New Orleans to Chicago with a voice as smooth as silk and as deep as midnight.\n\n\nNow, for an exclusive 1921-1922 residency, Miss Williams brings her spellbinding melodies to Laughlin, Nevada, transforming each evening into a symphony of passion and rhythm. With a presence as dazzling as the desert stars and a voice that makes hearts swoon, Layla embodies the very soul of jazz.\n\n\nJoin us for a night of unforgettable music, where the champagne flows, the dice roll, and the magic of Layla Williams lingers long after the last note fades.\n\n\nSpirit Mountain Hotel and Casino \u2013 Where Jazz Lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayla Williams performs at the hotel jazz bar. During this performance, she is approached by an intoxicated Vince Cannon, who makes a pass at the singer. He is accosted by hotel security, who attempt to throw him out of the hotel\n21\n.\n\n\nDuring dinner service, Benjamin Murray calls Geno Bellucci out to his table in an extravagant display of giving appreciation to the chef. During this conversation, which lasts only a few moments, they speak about a potential investment opportunity in a franchise of restaurants organized by Mr. Bellucci. Due to her waiting on a table nearby, Olivia Phillips overhears part of this conversation, which becomes an important prerequisite for the initiation of the Montezuma-11 event\n22\n.\n\n\n\nAfter Mr. Cannon is released to his room, he will occasionally leave later that evening and attempt to seek out Layla Williams. The result of this is irrelevant, so long as Mr. Cannon is in the casino the following night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Layla Williams checks into the hotel shortly after 21:00. During her check in, Senator Blacklock will pass by on his way to the jazz club and stop to speak to her\n23\n. Unlike with Mr. Cannon, Ms. Williams will initiate this contact, likely knowing about Senator Blacklock and his potential connections due to his ongoing campaign for governor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Williams serves an interesting role in the events of the weekend, as she is the most capable romantic match in terms of ability to produce additional gold from the matched person - seemingly in a bid to impress her\n24\n. Persons who are matched with Ms. Williams have a tendency to seek out additional wealth - either from their own possession or from the casino - in order to maintain her attention. She is one of the more emotionally compromised major players, and her proclivity for seeking out affection and companionship has, at times, resulted in tragic incidents wherein she perished before the end of the weekend, either as a result of aggression from a partner, or by her own hand\n25\n. It is imperative that, regardless of her interactions with other hotel occupants, she be present to sing for Tagliaferro on Sunday night, as this is a prerequisite to begin a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt roughly 21:48, Mrs. Blacklock will enter the casino with another of her friends, Mrs. Jasper. Mrs. Blacklock will take a seat at a slot machine, and send Mrs. Jasper to get them drinks. Upon returning, Mrs. Jasper must take the seat to the right of Mrs. Blacklock. After roughly six minutes of playing, Mrs. Jasper will hit jackpot\n26\n.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of dinner service, Mr. Avery seeks out Olivia Phillips again. The two of them return to Mr. Avery\u2019s hotel room. While in the room, they discuss Olivia\u2019s boss, Geno Belluci, and Olivia expresses frustration about his advances towards her. Mr. Avery offers a ride back to New York at the end of the weekend, while Mrs. Phillips tells him she'll keep a knife on her person in case he tries it again.\n27\n\n\nIf Walter Baker is paired in some way to Ms. Williams\n28\n, this is the earliest hypothesized point (roughly 23:00) during which Walter would be able to find the Small Vault\n29\n.\n\n\nA door within the penthouse is heard opening and closing several times, and two muffled male voices speak briefly, though inaudibly\n30\n.\n\n\nIf Senator Blacklock engaged in infidelity earlier in the day, Mrs. Blacklock will receive a phone call shortly before they go to sleep\n31\n. After taking the phone call, Mrs. Blacklock will leave their room and not return until the morning.\n\n\nIf Senator Blacklock is made aware of his wife's intentions after his infidelity, their room will receive the phone call but neither of them will be awake to hear it. Answering the phone will find the line open, but the voice of the speaker on the other end is muffled and unintelligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\n\n\nFriday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\nFriday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nMr. Cannon spends several hours early Friday morning sitting by a fountain on the hotel grounds drinking with a small party\n32\n. While most of the party has moved inside as of 02:45, Mr. Cannon continues to drink outside for another hour, staring up at the penthouse apartment of the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n04:00 Local Time\n\n\nNo Major Events of Note\n\n\n08:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nIf Mrs. Blacklock learns about her husband's infidelity, and receives the phone call the prior night, she will leave the hotel and return in the morning with a handgun. If she is not intercepted, she will shoot Senator Blacklock three times in the chest and neck, killing him. \nThis cannot be allowed to take place.\n Senator Blacklock must be present at the meetings of the conspirators on Friday and Saturday, as well as present on Sunday to confront Tagliaferro. In the event that Mrs. Blacklock is not intercepted and does kill her husband, no further gold will be collected from the casino's guests and will need to be produced entirely by Foundation assets during the active stage of the Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\nA letter arrives at the front desk for Mr. Avery containing details about financial indiscretions on the part of Benjamin L. Murray and Vernon Wells\n33\n, The Entrepreneur and The Banker, respectively. Mr. Avery will spend the rest of the morning following both Mr. Wells and Mr. Murray.\n\n\n\nMr. Murray or Mr. Wells discovering the letter is not necessarily indicative of a breakdown in the Opportune Scenario. Mr. Wells, and to a lesser extent Mr. Murray, will become increasingly paranoid if they discover the letter\n34\n, and will take actions to silence Mr. Avery prior to his revealing the nature of their crime to Mr. Snider, the district attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast is served in the main hall as guests continue to file in. During this time an absent individual\n35\n, likely the aforementioned A. Shaw, speaks to the concierge. As is evident by the concierge's comments and addressing the space down and to the right of the \"A. Shaw, M.D.\" absence, it is likely that the figure is accompanied by Emilia Fitzwilliams, Tagliaferro's young granddaughter. The two are escorted to an elevator, which appears on the top floor some time later. A. Shaw is believed to leave the hotel roughly three hours later.\n\n\nWalter Baker, if paired with Ms. Williams the night before, typically spends Friday morning exploring the basement level in search of the key to the small vault. The key is located in a small locker on a ledge overlooking SCP-8947-A. While Walter Baker (and all other SCP-8947-1 instances) will not yet recognize SCP-8947-A's existence, he will still be apprehensive about getting to the locker containing the small vault key. If either the key, the locker, or Walter Baker fall into SCP-8947-A\n36\n, the small vault, and by extension the secret vault, will no longer be accessible during the active cycle. Only the small vault is required for the Opportune Scenario, and while the secret vault does make the Opportune Scenario significantly easier it is much more difficult to achieve. \nFor this reason, Walter Baker must be encouraged to construct a small walkway out of nearby piece of plywood, as one of the footsteps needed to reach the locker is loose and will fall if not stepped over quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n12:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevada Senator Dean Blacklock. Image taken in 1918.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PARADISE CITY GAZETTE\n\n\nApril 3, 1922\n\n\n200+ DEAD IN SPIRIT MOUNTAIN INFERNO\n\n\nSENATOR DEAN BLACKLOCK AMONG THE VICTIMS IN DEADLIEST FIRE IN NEVADA HISTORY\n\n\nLaughlin, Nev. \u2013 A catastrophic blaze tore through the luxurious yet ill-fated Spirit Mountain Resort and Casino late last night, leaving over two-hundred dead in what is now the worst fire-related disaster in Nevada\u2019s history. Among the deceased are Senator Dean Blacklock, his wife Wilma Blacklock, Clark County District Attorney Winston Snider, famed publisher Vince Cannon - who recently made powerful enemies with his relentless criticism of Pan-Pacific Railway tycoon Alejandro Giuseppe Bianchi Tagliaferro II - and numerous other wealthy patrons and socialites.\n\n\nThe blaze, which erupted shortly after midnight, swiftly engulfed the mountaintop resort, leaving nearly no time for escape. Reports indicate that few of the hotel's occupants were able to reach safety, with many guests and staff members trapped as the fire raged uncontested through the structure\u2019s grand but questionably maintained halls.\n\n\nBillionaire\u2019s Palace or Death Trap?\n\n\nThe Spirit Mountain Resort and Casino, the crown jewel of Tagliaferro\u2019s growing empire of leisure properties, has long been a subject of scrutiny. Known for its opulent yet reckless excess, the hotel was a feat of engineering - perched precariously atop the rocky cliffs of Spirit Mountain, boasting the best views money could buy but, as last night proved, none of the fire precautions it should have had.\n\n\nFor years, this publication has raised alarms over the apparent lack of proper fire suppression systems at the resort, with sources alleging that the building\u2019s construction cut corners to maximize profit. Even as rumors of faulty wiring and inadequate water pressure circulated, inspections were allegedly fast-tracked through state regulators - many of whom were said to be in Tagliaferro\u2019s pocket.\n\n\nA particularly damning 1921 expos\u00e9 published by \nthis very newspaper\n, authored by none other than Vince Cannon himself, questioned how a casino of such scale and decadence could have been built without modernized safety measures. The article detailed instances where emergency exits were blocked, fire escapes poorly maintained, and sprinklers rumored to be nonfunctional. It is no small irony, and certainly no coincidence, that Mr. Cannon - Tagliaferro\u2019s most vocal critic - perished in the very inferno he had warned about.\n\n\nPolitical Shockwaves and Suspicions\n\n\nThe timing of Senator Blacklock\u2019s death could not be more politically disruptive. As the frontrunner for the Nevada gubernatorial race, Blacklock was widely expected to triumph over his scandal-plagued Republican opponent, James Gault, whose investment dealings are currently under public scrutiny. With Blacklock\u2019s sudden passing, the Democratic Party is left scrambling to find a replacement, with early discussions centering on Public Service Commissioner James G. Scrugham and party insider James T. Boyd.\n\n\nBut beyond political ramifications, \nquestions of foul play are already being raised\n. Was this simply a tragic accident, or is there more to the story? Whispers are growing among Nevada\u2019s elite that certain powerful interests may have benefited from Blacklock\u2019s death - including those who may have feared his governorship would interfere with their ambitions. And if any such parties exist, no name looms larger than that of \nAlejandro Giuseppe Bianchi Tagliaferro II\n.\n\n\nCALLS FOR JUSTICE\n\n\nThe \nParadise City Gazette demands answers\n. The Spirit Mountain disaster was not merely a tragedy of fate - it was a disaster of greed, negligence, and unchecked power. The very people entrusted with ensuring public safety failed in their duty, either through incompetence or corruption. Who, if anyone, will be held responsible?\n\n\nWith \nAlejandro Tagliaferro still missing\n, the mystery surrounding this catastrophe only deepens. Officials insist he was present at the resort when the fire broke out, yet \nhis body has not been recovered\n. Did he perish in the flames, his remains lost to the inferno? Or - \nas some now whisper - did he escape?\n Given his wealth, influence, and the questions swirling around the resort\u2019s operations, his disappearance cannot be ignored.\n\n\nBut Tagliaferro\u2019s uncertain fate does not absolve him of blame. His resort\u2014built on a mountain, packed with high-paying guests, but seemingly devoid of even the most basic fire suppression measures\u2014was a \ndeath trap waiting to be sprung\n. That it took the lives of \nover 200 people, including a United States senator, the Clark County District Attorney, and one of Tagliaferro\u2019s most vocal critics\n is no coincidence.\n\n\nThe people of Nevada \ndeserve the truth\n. Investigators must uncover \nwhy safety warnings were ignored, who profited from the shortcuts taken, and whether political or financial influence played a role in preventing proper oversight\n. Did state officials turn a blind eye? Were inspections falsified? And most chilling of all - \nwas the fire a mere accident, or was it something far worse\n?\n\n\nUntil these questions are answered - and until Tagliaferro is found, dead or alive - this story is far from over. The \nParadise City Gazette\n will continue to investigate, and we will not rest until those responsible are \nbrought to justice\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Jasper, having won a jackpot the day before, will spend most of the morning and early afternoon listening to Layla Williams in the hotel jazz bar. \nAs Mrs. Jasper typically leaves the building on Saturday morning, and will not be available to present her jackpot earnings to SCP-8947-A, one of two options must be chosen; either Mrs. Jasper should be encouraged to join in Mr. Cannon's card game with Alejandro Tagliaferro\n37\n in the hopes that her winnings then fall to Mr. Cannon, or she should be encouraged to approach Layla Williams with romantic intent.\n\n\nIn the event that Layla Williams has sex with Mrs. Jasper, the latter will reveal the location of her winnings to Layla. Afterwards, Layla will seek out the winnings and steal them from Mrs. Jasper, and will have them available at the beginning of the Montezuma-11 event\n38\n.\n\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Yates-Moore arrives at the hotel. Shortly after arriving she is met by Mr. Murray and Mr. Cannon, and the three of them leave to speak with Senator Blacklock. During this meeting, the details of their involvement together becomes apparent; Mrs. Yates-Moore claims that her late husband, Gerald Moore, entered into a business deal with Alejandro Tagliaferro prior to the former's death. According to Mrs. Yates-Moore, her husband believed until his death that Tagliaferro had been secretly hiding profits from their joint business venture (currently believed to have been investing in the fledgling Kervier Mining Company), which she believes is in excess of seventy-five million dollars\n39\n, and storing them away within the Spirit Mountain Casino's central vault\n40\n. Tagliaferro had repeatedly denied Gerald Moore's claims, up to his death, and Mrs. Yates-Moore now desires to take what she believes is her fortune. Mr. Cannon and Mr. Murray, as well as Senator Blacklock, have agreed to use their influence to force Tagliaferro to turn over the fortune, so long as they receive a substantial cut of it, for various reasons:\n\n\n\nMr. Murray wants the money to buy out the controlling shares in his brother's railroad company\n41\n, as well as cover for a money laundering scheme he is involved in with Mr. Wells.\n\n\nSenator Blacklock wants the money to shore up his campaign for Governor, which has recently become precarious due to Tagliaferro's support of his opposition,\n\n\nMr. Cannon seems to have no other motivation beyond personal hate for Tagliaferro - it can be revealed through discussion and observation that Cannon's Las Vegas publication, the \nParadise City Gazette\n, is in the middle of a multi-year long smear campaign against Alejandro Tagliaferro. While the more recent pieces did coincide with the election that Tagliaferro was actively involved in due to his support of Senator Blacklock's opposition, it is currently not believed that these two are in any way related, and the cause of Mr. Cannon's distaste for Tagliaferro remains unknown\n42\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring lunch service, Geno Bellucci makes another pass at Olivia Phillips, this time cornering her in the kitchen and slapping her on the bottom. Olivia will retaliate by slapping him, causing him to lash out at her violently. \nGeno Bellucci must be called away before he can further harm Olivia Phillips. Due to his later involvement with Olivia Phillips, Clark Avery, Walter Baker and the secret vault, he cannot be allowed to harm Olivia enough that would cause her to leave the hotel. Instead, he must only be allowed to harm her enough that she leaves to find Clark Avery.\n\n\nOlivia finds Clark, who consoles her. At the conclusion of their conversation, Olivia agrees to carry a knife she took from the kitchen with her and defend herself the next time she is aggressed by Geno Bellucci.\n\n\n\n\n16:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nAt the hotel pool, Mrs. Jasper and Mrs. Blacklock discuss Mrs. Jasper's sexual encounter with Layla Williams. Mrs. Blacklock discusses how, in her youth, she had briefly dated a man named Vincent Arians before he joined the British military during World War I. It is now known that this individual was an agent of and informant for the Chaos Insurgency, though the relevance of this is unknown.\n\n\nWalter Baker, if having previously discovered the Small Vault, will continue to search through the basement levels of the hotel, eventually finding a door without a key\n43\n. He spends time trying to pick the lock, but gives up when he is unable to do so.\n\n\nBenjamin Murray and Vernon Wells meet in a smoking lounge where Mr. Wells expresses concern about the presence of Clark Avery, who he claims had been making inquests into their past business dealings over the last few months. Mr. Murray agrees but claims to be more concerned about the presence of Winston Snider, the Clark County District Attorney. Mr. Wells is by far the more anxious of the two and discusses leaving the resort several times, but is rebuffed by Mr. Murray. Mr. Murray tells him to remain calm and that he'll speak to a friend about handling both Mr. Avery, but to leave Mr. Snider alone so as not to involve additional law enforcement.\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Mr. Murray makes a phone call to an outside line and briefly discusses how he believes Clark Avery is informing on him and Mr. Wells and that the journalist will soon go to Mr. Snider with his findings. \nLeft unimpeded, Mr. Murray will make this phone call at 17:29. However, it is imperative that Mr. Murray be distracted enough that he makes this call after 17:34. If his call is to go through, he will arrange for three individuals to enter the hotel late Friday night/early Saturday morning and kill Clark Avery, who must be present within the hotel on Sunday. However, if Mr. Murray attempts to make this call any time after 17:34, the line will not connect and Mr. Murray will not attempt to make this call again.\n\n\nMrs. Yates-Moore and Mr. Cannon spend the better part of the afternoon in Mrs. Yates-Moore's room engaging in sexual intercourse. After three hours, Mr. Cannon leaves to go to the casino floor, where he meets a handful of other guests, including Mr. Murray and Mr. Snider, who all begin to play cards. They are joined at 19:23 by Clark Avery. They will remain at the card table until later in the evening. Mrs. Jasper will also attempt to join this game if her money has not already been stolen by Ms. Williams. \nAs Mrs. Jasper has the highest chance to win the game, all parties involved must be influenced to reject her attempts to join.\n\n\nMrs. Snider, \"The D.A.'s Wife\", exits her room after evening prayer and leaves for the restaurant. As she is walking towards the restaurant she runs into Mr. Vernon Wells, \"The Banker\", and proceeds to drop her belongings. The man helps her pick them up, and she carries on out of the hotel. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Wells arrives at the Snider room and enters it using the key he had just stolen from Mrs. Snider, and proceeds to investigate their room looking for information suggesting Mr. Snider is investigating both he and Mr. Murray. \nThis information does not exist, and as a result Mr. Wells will spend a significant amount of time during that night's card game looking for nothing in the Snider room.\n\n\n\n\nBeing unsuccessful in locating information pertaining to an investigation that is not taking place, Mr. Wells decides to lace a bottle of seltzer water on Mr. Snider's nightstand with an unknown poison. To retrieve this poison he has to leave the Snider room and return to his own, then come back to the Snider room to complete his task.\n\n\nIt is important to monitor Mr. Snider during his time at the card table while also watching the situation with Mrs. Snider and Mr. Wells. If at any point Mr. Snider has winnings greater than $1000 in the card game, he will cash out before the next hand and Mrs. Snider will return to their room to get her bag. \nThe timing of this is very important\n - if Mrs. Snider does not encounter Mr. Wells \nbefore\n he laces the bottle of water, it is likely that Mr. Snider will be killed. Mrs. Snider will not leave the casino until her husband is no longer playing cards, so in order to have her interrupt Mr. Wells' attempted poisoning Mr. Snider must either reach $1000 or run out of money with enough time to ensure Mrs. Snider gets back to their room before Mr. Wells returns. Should she encounter Mr. Wells as he is leaving or returning to her room, Mr. Wells will be dissuaded and will flee, and will not attempt to kill Mr. Snider, allowing Mr. Snider to be present on Sunday with the money he had earned in the casino, if any.\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nAt 20:30, Alejandro Tagliaferro enters the casino hall. It is believed he is accompanied by Emilia Fitzwilliams and the individual known as A. Shaw - implied from a reference made by Mr. Cannon later in the evening - but this is uncertain due to the nature of their absence from the other SCP-8947-1 instances. Tagliaferro takes time to walk around the casino floor and speak to many of the guests, before walking out to the floor proper. For the first of only two\n45\n times throughout the four day period, Tagliaferro's voice can be heard. He cannot be addressed by Foundation staff, and speaks only to the other SCP-8947-1 instances at the table, and specifically to Mr. Cannon. Tagliaferro will ask to be dealt in, and will join the game. Taking part in the game are a Mr. Jackson and Mr. Bates, Mr. Benjamin Murray (The Entrepreneur), Mr. Clark Avery (The Journalist), Mr. Vince Cannon (The Capitalist) and Tagliaferro.\n\n\nThe game usually plays out in one of three ways, with a very rare fourth:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA)\n Mr. Cannon begins to play very aggressively, pushing out Mr. Jackson and Mr. Bates within the first few minutes of play. After either Mr. Murray or Mr. Avery push the other out, Tagliaferro will then push out the remaining of the two, and then proceed to win the game when Cannon goes all-in on triple Aces (A\u2660 A\n\u2665\n in hand, A\n\u2666\n 3\n\u2666\n 3\u2663 showing) and Tagliaferro shows a full house (A\u2663 3\u2660 in hand). This outcome has a 65.5% chance of occurring without outside interference, and is the most detrimental to the Opportune Scenario as Tagliaferro will take the money and leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB)\n Mr. Cannon begins to play very aggressively, only this time pushing out Mr. Murray first. Mr. Murray will buy back in to the game and push out Mr. Cannon's flush (K\n\u2665\n 7\n\u2665\n in hand) with a straight flush after three hands (3\n\u2665\n 5\n\u2665\n in hand, 2\n\u2665\n 4\n\u2665\n 6\n\u2665\n showing). After Mr. Cannon leaves the table, Alejandro Tagliaferro will also leave and the remaining winnings will go to the winner of the table, usually Mr. Avery. This outcome has a 22.2% chance of occurring without outside interference, and is only slightly detrimental to the Opportune Scenario (requires the discovery of the small vault). It is generally accepted that this is the safest scenario, as triggering the discovery of the small vault has a significantly higher chance of success than triggering the third outcome of this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC)\n In any situation, if Tagliaferro or Mr. Cannon leave the table early (generally considered before two or more persons have been removed from the table), for whatever reason, both will cash out the majority of their own money and the game will continue without them. However, without both Mr. Cannon and Tagliaferro, the game cannot produce enough money to meet even the barest conditions of the Opportune Scenario. This outcome has an 11.2% chance of occurring, and occurs most frequently by accident due to outside interference interrupting Mr. Cannon or in some way disturbing him, causing him to become agitated and leaving the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD)\n Mr. Cannon plays conservatively, waiting on Mr. Murray to push out Mr. Jackson and Mr. Bates. Mr. Avery will bluff Mr. Murray out of most of his accumulated earnings with some variation of a two pair ace high, but then lose his winnings to Alejandro Tagliaferro. Mr. Murray will go back and forth between Tagliaferro and Mr. Cannon, eventually being pushed out when he is bluffed again, only this time by Mr. Cannon. Mr. Murray will express his frustration at being bluffed twice, and leave the table with nothing. This leaves only Mr. Cannon and Tagliaferro with the maximum possible money left at the table. This outcome has a 1.1% chance of occurring.\n\n\n\n\nIn the event the game reaches this point \n\"D\"\n, Tagliaferro will call a brief recess and the party will move to the bar while the table is reorganized. This event has occurred only a handful of times since the Foundation began observing SCP-8947 in 2007, and every time it occurs a unique conversation takes place. This is unusual within the pattern of SCP-8947, which typically follows a generally set pattern that allows for mostly minor deviation. All but one of these unique conversations have been short, while the most recent (occurring on November 18th, 2016) was considerably longer. Transcripts of these conversations are available below.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947 Event Log\n\n\n16/5/2008\n\n\n\n\nCANNON:\n Well, Alejandro.

He came here by ship, and after spending time in the cities out east he scraped together whatever meager sum he could muster and set out west. He read stories about cowboys and indians, and hills full of gold - a land where a man could make something of himself.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Sounds like the stories worked.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n (\nLaughs\n) Well, can you blame him? Fresh off of a boat, with the grime of the city behind him and nothing in front of him but opportunity. Yes, the romanticism of the West bit him, and he came out here seeking his fortune.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Did he find it?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n No. My father made something of himself, certainly. Worked his fingers to the bones and climbed the ladder at a small railway. Ran contracts on the Lincoln line between Reno and Sacramento for thirty-years until his body broke. Scraped together enough to run a single engine, \non lease\n, from his former employer. (\nPause\n) My father worked until he could not work any longer, and died with more debt than dollars.\n\n\nCANNON:\n A modern American tragedy.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Maybe. He never complained, not even once. He might have even said he was happy.\n\n\nCANNON:\n So how do you figure in?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n My mother died when I was young, and I spent all of my growing days either at our humble mission school or with my father in his yard. I saw the work my father did, and what little his sweat was worth.\n\n\nCANNON:\n And you decided that wasn't for you.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Naturally.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Quite a story. Strange that you then somehow went and conquered the world all the same.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n No. Not the world. Not even a corner of it. I have been profoundly fortunate, and my good luck has provided me with wealth beyond reason. But this isn't the world, Vince. It can't be your whole life. It wasn't the money that made my father happy, it was purpose. We can't stay the same forever. We have to change.\n\n\nCANNON:\n (\nLaughs\n) That's rich. Is it the kid? She suddenly giving you some perspective?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n I thought I'd be satisfied with all the wealth my father never saw, but I was wrong. We're not meant to live like this. Our lives have to account for more than just numbers on a ledger.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Bold coming from the man with all the money.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n For now. It doesn't last forever.\n\n\nCANNON:\n It might.\n\n\nPause\n\n\nCANNON:\n Looks like the table is set. Should we get back to our game?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n You know how this ends. You don't have to do this.\n\n\nCANNON:\n You're right. I don't have to do anything.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Very well. Good luck to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nClark Avery leaves his hotel room around 01:30, having returned there after the night's card game some hours earlier. He will spend some time trailing Vince Cannon and Vernon Wells, who spend much of the evening moving between various bars and the outdoor veranda. \nThis is a critical block of time\n - Mr. Avery must be monitored and his position altered or obscured in some way if it seems likely he is about to be discovered by either of the two men, as Clark Avery being discovered by Mr. Wells will almost always lead to Mr. Wells fleeing the resort before the end of the night.\n\n\nAdditionally, this is the point at which, if Benjamin Murray was able to make his phone call the previous night, three additional instances of SCP-8947-1 will appear. These instances (who are never named) will attempt to kill Clark Avery if they locate him during the night - and are almost always successful. In the event that these individuals do arrive, there are generally four possible outcomes - only one is acceptable to fully fulfill Montezuma-11, as it is the only outcome where Clark Avery survives the night and the hotel is not alerted to the disturbance. The other scenarios vary depending on whether or not the hotel patrons become aware of the assassination attempt - the worst scenarios are those in which the hotel is alerted, as many of the patrons will leave before the end of the day. The four scenarios are presented below, in descending order of preference:\n\n\n\nScenario 1:\n The three men arrive to kill and spend the better part of the night hunting for Clark Avery. They are unable to find him, likely due to heavy Foundation intervention in obscuring Mr. Avery and discreetly interrupting the pathing of the three assailants\n46\n. If they are unable to find and kill Mr. Avery by 0600 Saturday morning, they will abandon the hotel and not return. This is by far the rarest outcome, relying on the most Foundation intervention. The effort involved and luck required to achieve this scenario is the reason why Mr. Murray's phone call the night before must be disrupted. It is, however, the only outcome that can still feasibly fulfill Montezuma-11, and is the best of the four.\n\n\nScenario 2:\n The three men find and discreetly kill Clark Avery. Avery's death here means he does not speak to Winston Snider on Saturday night, and Mr. Snider leaves the hotel Sunday morning. The discretion involved in this scenario makes this outcome generally better for fulfilling Montezuma-11 than the last two, as the only people who leave the hotel at this point are Clark Avery and Winston Snider, but Snider's presence on the final night is imperative to beginning the chain of events that begins the end phase of the protocol, and his absence significantly increases the Foundation's necessary contribution of gold bullion at the end of Montezuma-11.\n\n\nScenario 3:\n The three men attempt to kill Clark Avery, but create a disturbance among the guests in doing so and are unable to kill him. This typically involves Winston Snider becoming aware of the disturbance and engaging with the assailants. Regardless of whether or not any of the three men survive, the disturbance will cause many of the resort's guests to leave by the end of the day, \nsignificantly\n reducing the available gold on Sunday night. On average about 36% of guests will leave the hotel during Scenario 3, which while detrimental to the preferred outcome is still better than Scenario 4.\n\n\nScenario 4:\n Clark Avery is killed after a large disturbance that alerts the guests in the hotel. The occurrence of a successful assassination of a relatively well known journalist almost immediately results in heavy police presence throughout the rest of the weekend (denoted by additional SCP-8947-1 instances arriving in uniform) and a near-total abandonment of the rest of the weekend's proceedings. \nTHIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME\n from the perspective of keeping Foundation contributions to Montezuma-11 low. The only persons present on Sunday night will be a handful of hotel staff and police officers searching for the assailants, if they have not already been apprehended\n47\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nThe three assailants, if they have not yet found and killed Clark Avery, will leave around 06:20, as hotel staff begin prepping for the morning's activities.\n\n\n\n\n08:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nHeather Jasper, if she is still in possession of her jackpot winnings from Thursday night, leaves the hotel Saturday morning sometime after 08:00. While this cannot be allowed to happen in the Opportune Scenario, she cannot be convinced to stay at this point and steps must be taken to relieve her of her winnings earlier in the weekend.\n\n\nAt breakfast on Saturday, Mrs. Irma Snider (\nThe D.A.'s Wife\n) overhears part of a short conversation between Elizabeth Yates-Moore and another hotel guest about her grievances with Tagliaferro and her late husband. At some point, Mrs. Yates-Moore and her friend will see Layla Williams (\nThe Singer\n) and invite her to join them. It is during the conversation that follows that Mrs. Yates-Moore makes a passing remark about Tagliaferro rarely leaving his penthouse, at which point Ms. Williams will inform her that Tagliaferro will be present for the conclusion of the weekend on Sunday\n48\n.\n\n\nThere is a rare but important event that can take place after 09:00 on Saturday, wherein Walter Baker, The Groundskeeper, is injured in his morning duties and is taken to a hospital in Laughlin.\n49\n It is standard practice to monitor Mr. Baker during this timeframe in order to ensure he avoids injury - this period concludes just before he leaves to take his lunch break, after which he spends much of the afternoon trying to get into the secret vault.\n\n\n\n\n12:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Gerald Moore and Mrs. Elizabeth Yates-Moore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBITUARY: GERALD MOORE\n, 1863 \u2013 1919\n\n\nHOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA\n \u2013 The American film industry has lost one of its most esteemed pioneers with the passing of Mr. Gerald Moore, founder of Gateway Pictures, who died peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on the evening of September 14, 1919, at the age of 56.\n\n\nBorn in Hungary in 1863 under the name Gergely M\u00f3ricz, Mr. Moore came to America as a young man in pursuit of opportunity, a dreamer who, like so many before him, sought to build a new life in a land that promised boundless possibility. After settling in New York in the late 1880s, he adopted the name Gerald Moore and soon made his way westward, drawn to the burgeoning film industry that would come to define his legacy.\n\n\nA man of vision and generosity, Mr. Moore was instrumental in shaping California\u2019s film industry, first as an innovative cinematographer and later as a producer of great renown. Founding Gateway Pictures in 1911, he brought to the silver screen films that captivated audiences and elevated the craft, known for his keen ability to recognize talent and his steadfast commitment to artistry. Beyond his own studio\u2019s success, he played a crucial role in helping establish some of Hollywood\u2019s most ambitious production houses, including Syncope Symphony, known for its pioneering work in synchronized sound experiments, and Helios Filmworks, which would later become a powerhouse in historical epics. His generosity extended beyond the camera, as he was known to provide work and mentorship to many young filmmakers, actors, and technicians who sought to make their mark in the industry.\n\n\nAbove all, Mr. Moore was a devoted father and family man. He was preceded in death by his beloved first wife, Mrs. Ilona Kov\u00e1cs Moore, who passed away in 1908. A woman of grace and warmth, Mrs. Moore was widely cherished by those who knew her, remembered for her kindness and steady presence by her husband's side during the early days of his career. Together, they raised four children - Mr. Geoffrey Moore, Mrs. Cherine Moore-Davidson, Miss Yvette Moore, and Mr. Adrian Moore - who mourn his passing deeply and carry forth his legacy of strength and ambition.\n\n\nMr. Moore is also survived by his second wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Yates-Moore, whom he married in 1912. The daughter of Mr. Leeman Yates, a prominent entrepreneur known for his work in the prospecting industry, Mrs. Yates-Moore was by his side in his final years.\n\n\nIn an industry often known for its ruthlessness, Gerald Moore stood apart - a man of honor, warmth, and generosity, a leader who sought to uplift rather than to dominate. His loss is felt deeply by the many who knew him, and his contributions to cinema will endure for generations to come.\n\n\nServices will be held this Sunday at the Hollywood Cemetery, where Mr. Moore will be laid to rest beside his first wife. The Moore family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to organizations supporting young filmmakers - a final tribute to a man who believed so deeply in the power of storytelling and the next generation of artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring lunch service, Elizabeth Yates-Moore dines with Dean and Wilma Blacklock in a private booth. They discuss at length the senator's upcoming gubernatorial election campaign, and Tagliaferro's interference in it\n50\n.\n\n\n\nIt is during this meeting that Mrs. Yates-Moore confesses her current situation to the Blacklocks - she is nearly penniless, subsisting entirely on a heavily overextended line of credit established by her late husband. Her father Leeman Yates had sold much of his company to the Kervier Standard Company prior to his death in order to cover expenses incurred due to a failed business deal with a local real estate group. The comparatively modest sum she was left in his will is all the money she has left, as her late husband Gerald Moore had left all of his money to his four children from a previous marriage. Her inheritance money had quickly expired due to her lavish lifestyle, and the bills incurred on the assets she did inherit - namely, her husband's Las Vegas estate - are beginning to outpace her ability to pay them off. By her account, she would be entitled to any additional money owed to her husband's company, of which she is now the sole employee, and is convinced that the money she believes is owed to her husband by Tagliaferro would be passed to the company, and not his children\n51\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the lunch service, Olivia Phillips confronts Geno Bellucci about his previous sexual advances. The end result of this interaction is only important insomuch that Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Bellucci both remain alive. It is not believed that Mrs. Phillips' intention is to kill Mr. Bellucci, but on several occasions the discourse between them has become violent, Mrs. Phillips produces her knife, and one of the two are killed. It is possible to avoid this by convincing any member of the restaurant staff or any of the patrons to intervene, though if not done carefully this has a chance to further escalate the conflict.\n\n\n\nHowever, the most common outcome is one where where Mr. Bellucci apologizes for his actions, admitting they were inappropriate and untoward. This outcome is \nnot\n preferred, as it results in one or both of Mr. Bellucci and Mrs. Phillips leaving the resort and not returning by Sunday. As such, it is generally considered more efficient to slightly antagonize one or the other prior to their confrontation, enough that neither of them are willing to reconcile but also not so severely as to result in lethal violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayla Williams also performs shortly after lunch in one of the lounges. She will receive a phone call at the front desk near the expected end of her set, informing her of her father being shot\n52\n and sent to the hospital during a robbery in Louisiana earlier that day. The Opportune Scenario requires Layla Williams to be in the hotel on Sunday night to sing for Tagliaferro, and receiving this phone call will cause Layla Williams to leave shortly afterwards. While her set usually runs just long enough that she misses the phone call, causing a message to be left with her that she does not read before the end of the weekend, it is possible for her to conclude slightly earlier and receive the message. \nIt is therefore preferable that the set run as long as possible, either by encouraging Ms. Williams to perform an encore or distracting the front desk clerk attempting to inform Ms. Williams of the phone call. The individual on the other end of the call (believed to be Ms. Williams' uncle, Lee Williams) will only stay on the phone for a few moments, so it is only necessary to extend the set two or three minutes after the call is made in order to prevent her from receiving the message.\n\n\n\n\n16:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nDuring the afternoon, Walter Baker will attempt to get into the secret vault.\n\n\n\nThe vault door contains a complex locking mechanism requiring three separate keys, a translated cipher, and its 12-digit numerical output. These locations of all the items and information needed to access the vault are known, but require a significant amount of work to replicate. Specifically:\n\n\n\nWalter Baker will need to gain access to two different areas of the hotel he does not naturally have access to, those being a 7th floor administrative office and the 9th floor greenhouse.\n\n\n\nTo get into the administrative office, he will need to convince Mary Primrose, a secretary for the casino, to allow him to enter the office. Mrs. Primrose is the only person in the office\n53\n who will permit this, and encountering her is only possible during a two minute gap around 16:25 when she leaves through to use the 7th floor washroom. Mrs. Primrose leaves the office at 17:05 and will not return afterwards.\n\n\n\nOnce inside the office, the key is in an envelope marked to Tagliaferro's attention in the 3rd drawer from the top of the filing cabinet in the back corner of the office, behind two unused desks. Nobody in the office (including Mrs. Primrose) should be allowed to look at the name on the envelope, or else they will attempt to stop Mr. Baker from taking it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get into the 9th floor greenhouse\n54\n, he will need to enter through an open window on the exterior of the building. Getting into that window will require he shimmy across the exterior of the building, avoiding the detection of anyone standing in the garden below, and then find the loose window lock on the north side of the greenhouse. This will give him a roughly 61cm entrance to climb through. The key is located in a lockbox behind a \nLilium candidum\n in a grey flowerpot near the center of the greenhouse.\n\n\n\nAny fall Mr. Baker experiences attempting to get into the greenhouse window will invariably be fatal, and over repeated attempts this has happened numerous times. As a result, Mr. Baker has seemingly become unconsciously avoidant of this strategy, which has led Foundation game theorists to look for other ways to enter the greenhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third key is located beneath a drain at the bottom of one of the hotel pools. This is the simplest key to obtain, but as Mr. Baker is not a strong swimmer this key has been notoriously difficult to collect, and usually requires Mr. Baker to try and convince other patrons to swim down and get the key for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter Baker will need to be introduced to Miriam Marshall, a traveling nurse, who has studied cryptography as a hobby and can work out a complex mechanical cipher within the locking mechanism.\n\n\n\nMs. Marshall is only present at the hotel on Saturday, as she checks in Saturday morning and leaves Sunday morning. This leaves very little time for Mr. Baker to interact with her, as regardless of their progress she will always leave Sunday morning and cannot be persuaded to stay.\n\n\nThis cipher requires a code phrase\n55\n, which is located within a logbook on the same basement level as the secret vault door. Mr. Baker cannot simply be given the output of the cipher\n56\n - attempting to do so, even subtly, will result in Mr. Baker and Ms. Marshall becoming incapable of seeing or interacting in any way with the person trying to provide the code. This will also cause Mr. Baker specifically some considerable distress, as from his perspective the person he was engaging with will have abruptly ceased to exist. If this occurs he will almost always immediately give up his attempt to get into the secret vault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the complexity of trying to get Mr. Baker to collect the items necessary to enter the secret vault and the danger the task puts him in (and his growing unwillingness to do so\n57\n) it is generally considered not worth the effort to try and enter the secret vault, as a number of other outcomes (opening the small vault, Mrs. Jasper's jackpot being stolen, optimal card game resolutions, Messrs. Cannon, Wells and Murray staying until Sunday night, etc.) are all usually sufficient to fulfill Protocol Montezuma-11, and the contents of the secret vault require additional intense manipulation of Mr. Baker and several other hotel patrons to see any payout. While the potential gold payout can be significant, the more important value in opening the secret vault is further exploration into Tagliaferro's occultist background and greater intentions.\n\n\n\nThe contents within the secret vault no longer exist, and only manifest when Walter Baker (or another instance of SCP-8947-1) enter the vault to remove them. In the four instances wherein Mr. Baker successfully opened the secret vault, the following items have been recovered from it:\n\n\n\nA book entitled \"\nThe Way Under The Water\n\", written by an \"L. M. L. Morrisey\". This book is believed to be a fictional depiction of a god sleeping under the ocean and describes ways to pay homage to that god,\n\n\nA book entitled \"\nSaisons\n\" written by French author \u00c9tienne Dumarche. Walter Baker does not read French and the text of the book is unknown.\n\n\nA book entitled \"\n\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (Ash and Rebirth)\n\" written by Russian author Gavriil Povolzhin. This book can be translated by a Dmitry Alekseyevich Volkov, his wife Elizaveta, or their two sons Alexei and Andrei, all of whom are staying at the hotel as guests. This has been difficult to achieve, and thus far has only revealed that the text combines elements of Orthodox Christian mysticism with folk tales and alchemical symbolism. The text is structured as a series of parables and dialogues between a dying sage (called \"\n\u0423\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\n\" or \"the fading one\") and a mysterious, otherworldly being (called \"\u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447 \u0417\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0441\" or \"weaver of veils\") who guides the sage toward understanding the transcendence of mortal existence.\n\n\nA book entitled \"\nUmbra Vitae\n\" by 17th century Greek author Ioannis Krypteron. The text is written entirely in Greek and there are no known patrons of the hotel who can read Greek.\n\n\nA collection of papers believed to be a copy of the \"Eschaton Manuscript\n58\n\", a series of writings by an anonymous 11th century author speculated to have originated in either the Levant or Southern Europe. It is a deeply cryptic and ancient text believed to have been transcribed by an unnamed sect of Gnostic mystics detailing the apocalyptic concept of transformation through fire\u2014not as a destructive force, but as the ultimate purifier.\n\n\nA book entitled \"Chrysalis of Night\" written by 19th century Hungarian author Karolina Szegedy. The contents of the book are unknown - Mr. Baker cannot be compelled to open it, complaining that it \"feels wrong\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlchemical rune described in \nAuric Vitae\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nAuric Vitae\n:\n\n\n\"As the final breath of the ritual escapes into the aether, and the golden essence suffuses the flesh, the mortal vessel shall crumble, giving way to the eternal form. No longer bound by decay or time, the adept shall rise anew\u2014transformed into a being of living gold, a luminous conduit of divine perfection.\n\n\nThe veins shall flow with molten aurum, warm and unyielding, and the skin shall gleam with the brilliance of a thousand suns. The eyes, now orbs of crystalline amber, shall perceive not as man, but as the eternal does\u2014piercing the veil of time and space. The heart, stilled in its mortal cadence, shall beat no more, yet it shall thrum with the resonance of the cosmos itself.\n\n\nBeware, for such a gift is not without its weight. The burden of eternity lies not in the years, but in the unrelenting brilliance, the burning purity of gold, which allows no shadow, no retreat into darkness. Once made whole, the immortal shall walk forever in light, unyielding and alone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA book entitled \"\nAuric Vitae\n\" written by 16th century German author and self-proclaimed alchemist Heinrich von Stahl. This book can be translated by a Friedrich Adler, another hotel patron. The text describes the mystical properties of gold, not as a mere element but as a divine substance capable of transforming flesh and spirit. \nAuric Vitae\n claims that by consuming \"living gold\" (gold transmuted through secret alchemical processes), one can attain physical immortality and spiritual transcendence. The book combines dense alchemical recipes with cryptic rituals involving lunar phases, human blood, and rare herbs.\n\n\nA collection of various alchemical tools and supplies, including all but one of the ingredients needed to perform a ritualistic transformation described in \nAuric Vitae\n. Each of these ingredients is labeled according to their name given in the text, but additional information has been provided by whomever assembled the ingredients. While the original ingredients cannot be tested, the descriptions provided have informed some understanding of their purpose in the ritual:\n\n\n\nPhilosopher's Mercury\n: A liquid metal alloy, composed of mercury and trace elements.\n\n\nAuric Seed\n - A crystalline structure formed from gold, developed through prolonged exposure to concentrated sunlight.\n\n\nMolten Crown\n - Liquid-phase gold alloy. Procured offsite.\n\n\nGolden Myrrh\n - Resin infused with colloidal gold during pyrolysis. Demonstrates enhanced aromatic and combustive qualities.\n\n\nPhoenix Feather\n - A specimen representing symbolic avian anatomy, used in combustion studies. Material includes carbonized organic matter.\n\n\nBreath of Aurum\n - A vaporized mixture of cinnabar (HgS), elemental gold, and organic compounds such as ambergris. Produced through sublimation under controlled heat.\n\n\nBlood of a Saint\n - A single drop of human blood\n59\n.\n\n\nHeart of Quartz\n - Rose quartz shaped to mimic anatomical features.\n\n\nSalt of Eternity\n - A finely ground mineral residue, hypothesized to derive from meteorites. Displays unique fluorescence under ultraviolet light.\n\n\nLunar Ash\n - Combustion byproduct of Artemisia absinthium (wormwood) and other botanicals, collected under specific lunar phenomena.\n\n\nElixir of Sol\n - A distilled mixture of botanical extracts, honey, and other organic compounds. Notable for its refractive golden hue and energy-release potential.\n\n\nEcho of Thunder\n - Rainwater collected during thunderstorms.\n\n\nDragon's Breath\n - A gaseous compound containing sulfur dioxide, ethanol, and an unidentified proprietary catalyst. Combustion studies reveal high-temperature unknown matter.\n\n\nVeil of Orichalcum\n - A fabric woven from an unidentified golden alloy thread. Unusually soft.\n\n\nCircle of Binding Runes\n - A geometrical diagram inscribed with gold-based ink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ritual described in \nAuric Vitae\n can be performed by Walter Baker - the result of which is the total transformation of his entire body into gold. This is believed to be a failure of the intended alchemical process, which describes a transformative experience that elevates the individual into a being \"made of gold, but not bound by it\" and implies the resultant subject would still be ambulatory and conscious. It is likely that the failure stems from a missing ingredient - the \"blood of a saint\", which Mr. Baker substituted for his own blood in the only recorded performance of this ritual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from a conversation between Clark Avery and Winston Snider on Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClark Avery. Image taken in 1921.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVERY:\n You'll need to move quick, sir. I don't know who sent it, but this tip - it's solid. I\u2019ve followed the money, traced the filings. It all runs through Wells.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n You\u2019re saying this whole damn operation\u2019s a front?\n\n\nAVERY:\n Not exactly. The casino\u2019s real enough, but the money moving through it - Murray\u2019s money - it\u2019s not his. It belongs to TransAmerican. Or at least, it did before he started washing it through here.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n Hell of a way to bite the hand that feeds him. Chester Murray bankrolls half the rail lines west of the Mississippi. You\u2019re telling me his own brother\u2019s been siphoning off his money?\n\n\nAVERY:\n Through a shell company - Porter Finance. Set up by Wells, run under a name that doesn\u2019t exist. The money was earmarked for a northern expansion, but instead of laying track, it\u2019s been coming here, piece by piece. Wells launders it, Murray pockets the clean cash.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n And Wells didn\u2019t want him here this weekend\u2026 That tracks. When I first met them, Wells looked damn near ready to chew through his cigar when Murray walked in. Didn't seem like he was supposed to be here.\n\n\nAVERY:\n Because if he wasn\u2019t, the whole thing stays quiet. Wells keeps working, the money keeps moving, and no one asks questions. But Murray - he's arrogant. Too sure of himself. He thought he could show up, throw his weight around, and nobody\u2019d dare push back.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n And now you\u2019re pushing back.\n\n\nAVERY:\n Guess I am.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n Does anyone else know?\n\n\nAVERY:\n Whoever passed the tip. Nobody else I know of.\n\n\nSNIDER:\n No sense in waiting, then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo events of significant importance occur on Saturday night:\n\n\n\n\nAround 21:15 Clark Avery seeks out and arranges a meeting with Winston Snider. They endeavour to find a location where they will not be disturbed, and while this is usually successful there have been several occasions where their conversation is overheard by one Leonard Haskins, a courier in Benjamin Murray's employ, who will then report back to Mr. Murray. It is only at this point that Mr. Murray becomes unsettled enough to flee the hotel, notably without informing Mr. Wells\n60\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this meeting, Mr. Avery lays out the results of his investigation to Mr. Snider. In short - Mr. Avery received an anonymous tip\n61\n detailing allegations of financial indiscretions perpetrated by Mr. Murray against his brother's company, TransAmerican Railroad. Murray had been funneling a significant amount of wealth intended for the development of a new northern line into a survey company owned by a fake persona managed by his banker, Mr. Wells. That money, believed to be in excess of $450,000\n62\n, was in the process of being laundered at the Spirit Mountain Casino, and had been for several weeks prior. Mr. Snider confirms that during his initial meeting with both Mr. Murray and Mr. Wells that the latter had not intended the former to make an appearance at the hotel that weekend, and seemed somewhat anxious about his presence\n63\n, likely because it threatened to expose what was an otherwise discreet money laundering scheme.\n\n\nAfter some deliberation, Mr. Snider will make a phone call to the Clark County Sherriff's office and arrange for the arrival of uniformed officers to arrest Mr. Wells and Mr. Murray the following evening, which is the soonest these officers could arrive\n64\n.\n\n\nThere have been, on occasion, instances where Mr. Avery is unable to convince Mr. Snider, usually due to Snider having not interacted with Wells and Murray on Thursday and thus not being suspicious of them at the start. In this instance the police will not be called, and Mr. Avery - frustrated about this outcome, will seek out Olivia Phillips shortly after this meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOstensibly, Mr. Avery desires to meet up with Mrs. Phillips in the hopes that she has heard anything about Mr. Wells or Mr. Murray that could help his investigation, though she has not. It is during this meeting, which typically occurs (if at all) sometime around 21:45, that the truth of their relationship is revealed - Olivia Phillips is the widow of one of Clark Avery's former classmates, Jacob Phillips, who died during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel during the first World War. Avery, who was an army photographer during the war, had been asked by Mr. Phillips to look after Mrs. Phillips if he did not return from Europe. It is possible, then, that Mr. Avery took the lead on the Murray/Wells tip because he knew it would send him to Nevada, which he could use as an opportunity to check in on Mrs. Phillips.\n\n\nIf Mr. Avery has not been able to convince Mr. Snider of Mr. Wells and Mr. Murray's crimes, he will leave the hotel the following morning. During this conversation with Mrs. Phillips he will try to convince her to leave as well, offering travel back to New York and help finding gainful employment there. Mrs. Phillips will not desire to leave if she has made amends with Geno Bellucci, but considering this is considered a less than ideal outcome then it is more likely that she will be inclined to go. Because Mrs. Phillips' presence on Sunday night is the trigger for initiating Montezuma-11, she cannot be allowed to leave with Mr. Avery. Several tactics have been used to prevent this, primarily:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvince Mrs. Phillips that Mr. Avery is at the hotel to pursue her romantically. This can be difficult, as that is clearly not Mr. Avery's intention and he shows no evidence to support it, but it has been effective especially if her and Mr. Bellucci's work relationship has become especially toxic.\n\n\nDelay Mr. Avery's arrival to her room that evening. Since Mrs. Phillips lives in the on-site staff housing, which becomes locked at 22:00, Mr. Avery will not be able to enter that evening and will depart the next morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 23:30 Mr. Cannon, Senator Blacklock, Mr. Murray and Mrs. Yates-Moore meet in Murray's suite on the casino floor. This meeting is the penultimate major event before the activation of Montezuma-11, and requires very little setup aside from ensuring all four participants are still in the hotel on Saturday night\n65\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several different variations of the conversation that follows, with all of them leading more or less to the same outcome; Mrs. Yates-Moore wants the money she believes she is owed, Sen. Blacklock is willing to assist so long as he is given part of the fortunate as a campaign donation, Mr. Murray seems generally ambivalent but seems to enjoy the drama of it all (and desires some of the money to aid in covering up his own money laundering scheme), and Mr. Cannon seems to desire little else than ruining Tagliaferro's reputation\n66\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947 Event Log\n\n23/11/2019\n\n\n\n\nMURRAY:\n So, we\u2019re all in agreement, then? We put the screws to the bastard, and by Sunday night, he hands over our - \nyour\n money, all nice and neat?\n\n\nCANNON:\n No, Murray, you soft-headed drunk. We don\u2019t \u201cput the screws\u201d to him - we break him. If he won\u2019t hand it over, we make sure he wishes he had. He's smart, but he's not invincible.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n No, no, no. This can\u2019t look like a shakedown. If this turns bad, it\u2019ll be my neck in the noose, not yours. I cannot - will not - be seen strong-arming a man as well-connected as Tagliaferro over money.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Don\u2019t get sanctimonious on me now, Blacklock. You want this just as bad as we do. More, even. You've got precious political ambitions to keep alive.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n I need \nfunding\n. There\u2019s a difference between that and an outright robbery.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n Call it whatever makes you comfortable, Senator. Just make sure the money ends up in my hands.\n\n\nMURRAY\n laughs, as if hearing a joke. He is clearly drunk.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n I like a woman who knows what she wants.\n\n\nCANNON:\n You\u2019d like a rattlesnake if it batted its eyes at you.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n (\nTo Mrs. Yates-Moore\n) And you\u2019re certain the money is in the vault?\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n My husband never lied to me.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Oh yeah. I'm sure.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n We\u2019re still missing something. Tagliaferro is a stubborn man, but you're right - he\u2019s not stupid. We need to be sure he feels cornered. He won\u2019t crack unless he knows there\u2019s no way out.\n\n\nCANNON:\n That\u2019s why we do it in public. Sunday night. He\u2019ll be in the grand lounge - he always is. That girl Layla is going to be there, and he'll be there to hear her sing. Drinks, cards, pretending he\u2019s still king of the goddamn world. We make sure he has nowhere to run.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Except\u2026\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n Except what?\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Except for that man he's been spending time with.\n\n\nThe room falls into a brief silence.\n\n\nCANNON:\n I\u2019ve seen him. He\u2019s\u2026 strange. Not local, that\u2019s for damn sure.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n I noticed him too. Tall, foreign-looking. Keeps to himself, but always near Tagliaferro. Something about him feels\u2026 off.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n You\u2019re not seriously telling me you three are afraid of some assistant.\n\n\nCANNON:\n That man\u2019s no assistant.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n There\u2019ve been whispers.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n About what?\n\n\nMURRAY:\n You know. Whispers.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n Oh, enough.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n That\u2019s not our only problem.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n There\u2019s always another problem.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n His granddaughter is here.\n\n\nCANNON:\n (\nLaughs\n) His daughter's girl? I hear she\u2019s lovely. What a shame that she has to watch her grandfather finally get dragged out into the light. I'm beside myself.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n We have to consider if she\u2019s a liability.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Oh, come on, Dean. You getting sentimental?\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n I\u2019m saying if things turn ugly, I don\u2019t want an innocent girl caught in the middle of it.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Sounds like that's up to him, isn't it?\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n You know what I mean.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Fine. If you don't want ugly, then let\u2019s make sure things don\u2019t turn ugly.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n One last thing.\n\n\nCANNON:\n (\nClearly annoyed\n) What now?\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n Snider.\n\n\nThe room goes silent again.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Yeah, that one might be a problem.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n If he catches wind of this, we\u2019re finished.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n (\nScoffs\n) Then make sure he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\nCANNON:\n We just keep him distracted. He\u2019s a lawyer, sure, but I doubt he\u2019s above a well-placed bribe.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Or a bottle.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n We\u2019ll keep him busy.\n\n\nCANNON:\n Tomorrow night, we make our move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\n\n\nSunday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\nSunday\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nIn the single instance where Walter Baker, the Groundskeeper, managed to complete the ritual detailed within the Secret Vault, it occurred shortly after midnight. There is little other data on how quickly this ritual could be completed.\n\n\nAt around 02:12, the front desk clerk will go on break and leave the front desk unattended. It is during this time frame that a highly unlikely event may occur - the front desk phone will begin ringing, and will continue to ring until roughly 30 seconds before the desk clerk returns. No other persons pass through the hotel lobby during this time, as all the patrons are either in their rooms or at the casino, so nobody else will answer the call. This call has occurred thrice since the Foundation began observing SCP-8947, with each additional iteration of the call seemingly picking up where the former had left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the phone in question did survive the fire and remains at the front desk. Upon picking up the receiver (the phone in question being a \"candlestick\" telephone that was common at the time), a voice can be heard on the other end of the line. The voice is undetermined\n67\n, and is only barely audible, but a conversation can be made out between them and another person - the second person cannot be heard aside from muted murmering. A transcript of the conversation, insomuch as it has been recorded, is below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947 Event Log\n\n\nUnknown Call Log #1\n\n\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n I heard a story one time from a traveling Mamluk when we were out in the desert - a queer story.

Something about what he said, or maybe the way my fingers had lingered too long over the weight of my own coin. He waited until the fire had burned low and then told me this story.\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n \"There are many gods in this world,\" he said. His voice was dry, like the wind. \"Some demand blood. Some demand devotion. But there is one god that does not ask. It only \nwaits\n.\" I felt my own throat go dry then, as dry as his words - or worse. I cannot say why. He looked past me, as if he was looking at someone out in the dunes, and continued.\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n \"I once served a man,\" he said, \"who had no god but greed.\"\n\n\nThe other voice says something. It seems to be ignored.\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n The Mamluk told of his master, a man who built his fortune on the suffering of others, whose wealth grew like rot upon the bones of the desperate. He spoke of gold counted by candlelight, of ledgers inked in misery.

While it is not impossible to dissaude some of these guests from leaving, even up until the point where they are checking out, once they have signed out in the hotel's log book they can no longer be interacted with. There are several contingencies available in case high-value persons, such as Mr. Cannon, Mr. Murray, Mr. Wells or Senator Blacklock attempt to leave at this stage, but they are all exceedingly difficult and it is considered much easier to make sure they do not get to this point in the first place.\n\n\nAt around 09:05, another one of the groundskeepers, Brett Beverly, will find the transfigured body of Walter Baker in the basement. He and several other members of the resort staff will spend the next several hours moving the body up into the hotel atrium\n68\n.\n\n\nDuring breakfast this morning, Mr. Cannon and Mrs. Yates-Moore will sit together with two other socialites, Mr. and Mrs. Fred and Delilah Potter. While Mrs. Yates-Moore carries the conversation, Mr. Cannon seems noticeably distracted throughout.\n\n\nAdditionally during breakfast service, District Attorney Winston Snider and his wife, Irma Snider, eat with Layla Williams, the Singer. Mrs. Snider confides in Layla that she is a big fan of her father, Zeke Williams, who performed a gospel service at their church several years before. They speak for some time, and Layla promises to sing \"Down in the River to Pray\" at the night's performance for Mrs. Snider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not required for Mrs. Snider to make this request, but adding this song to the end of Ms. Williams' set slightly shortens the time between the confrontation with Tagliaferro and the beginning of the Montezuma-11 event. It is a marginal decrease, but there are several persons at the hotel who will try to leave once the confrontation reaches its zenith, and it is possible to delay them enough that they cannot make it to the edge of the resort grounds by the time the activation event begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nJust before 14:00, Mr. Cannon will assemble a small group of men\n69\n in his stateroom and provide them all with weapons - generally bully clubs and batons. He will procure a handgun, and explain that they will be confronting Tagliaferro in the evening about a major alleged theft that has transpired. He will lie and claim that law enforcement has been called, but in order to avoid letting Tagliaferro escape before they arrive he and some others will perform a citizens arrest. The men in the room (seven in total) are just there to mitigate hotel security if they try to assist Tagliaferro in evading justice.\n\n\nAround 14:35, Clark Avery will speak to Olivia Phillips one more time, warning her about a potential confrontation between the police and both Mr. Murray and Mr. Wells that evening. He tells her to try to keep her distance, as he does not know whether or not the event will escalate. Mrs. Phillips asks who all is implicated, and Clark idly remarks that there may be other hotel staff involved, but he does not know the full extent of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear from this conversation that Mr. Avery is talking about Mr. Wells' employees working to launder the money, but Mrs. Phillips is thinking about the conversation between Geno Bellucci and Benjamin Murray during dinner on Thursday. Her presence at the lounge Sunday evening, then, is likely in the hopes of watching Mr. Bellucci get implicated for money laundering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nAt this point on Sunday there is very little that can be done to change the outcome of the weekend, as most of the events that have been put in motion cannot be altered and only need to be resolved. None of the highest value individuals at the hotel will seek to leave after the morning block, and no other major events of significance take place between the conversation between Mr. Avery and Mrs. Phillips, and the end of dinner service.\n\n\n\n\n20:00 Local Time\n\n\n\n\nDinner services proceeds as normal, without any interruptions. Notably missing from the dining hall is Mrs. Yates-Moore, who spends a significant amount of time in the evening getting dressed and putting on makeup prior to leaving for the lounge at 20:45.\n\n\nAt 20:52, the door to the penthouse opens. \nThis is the beginning of the Montezuma-11 Activation Event\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontezuma-11\u00a0Activation\u00a0Event\n\n\n\n\nMontezuma-11\u00a0Activation\u00a0Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis list is comprised of all known instances of SCP-8947-1, and other individuals of interest.\n\n\nNames listed here have been recovered from a variety of sources, and are listed as accurately as possible given the information available.\n\n\n\n\nHotel Guests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject Name\n\n\nSubject Occuption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Dean Blacklock\n\n\nState Senator from Nevada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Wilma Blacklock\n\n\nSocialite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Vince Cannon\n\n\nNewspaper publisher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Benjamin L.

fulfilled - a state known as an \"Uncontrolled Activation\". During an uncontrolled activation, the fissure beneath SCP-8947 will begin to expand at 22:51 and will not stop until midnight. This is the most disastrous outcome and has been experienced comparatively few times since the Foundation began monitoring SCP-8947 - each instance was the result of the absence of Olivia Phillips from the lounge on Sunday night, either due to being compelled to leave with Mr. Avery, being dead, or having left the hotel after Mr. Avery's (or another prominent figure's) death on Saturday.\n\n\nScenario B:\n The conditions of Montezuma-11 have been fulfilled, but there is not enough gold present within SCP-8947 to satisfy the conditions of the protocol - a state known as a \"Controlled Activation\". During a controlled activation the fissure under SCP-8947 will only begin expanding once it is clear that there is not enough gold within the resort to fulfill the required amount. When the ritual described in this document's containment procedures takes place, and that quantity is satisfied, the fissure will immediately cease expanding. This has been the most common outcome historically, though the rate at which it occurs has been steadily decreasing over time as SCP-8947 game theory teams have been continuously optimizing the outcome.\n\n\nScenario C:\n The conditions of Montezuma-11 have been fulfilled, and there is enough gold present within SCP-8947 to satisfy the conditions of the protocol - a state known as a \"Resolved Activation\". The fissure beneath SCP-8947 does not expand.\n\n\nAt the end of all three scenarios, regardless of outcome, a fire breaks out within the hotel and casino and wholly consumes it. This fire is fully incorporeal and cannot harm living creatures, though SCP-8947-1 instances do appear to be burning alive throughout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this fire has burned out, the SCP-8947-1 instances within will vanish (if they have not already burned away) and the activation event will end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontezuma-11 Activation Event Timeline\n\n\nNote: This timeline of events is generally accurate during Scenario B and Scenario C. While it is mostly accurate for the beginning of Scenario A\n70\n, it will wildly diverge near the end due to Mrs. Phillips' absence.\n\n\n\n\nAt 21:00, Layla Williams begins her set in the lounge. Most of the prominent figures within SCP-8947 arrive ahead of time, including all of the conspirators, Avery Clark, and Mr. and Mrs. Snider.\n\n\nAt 21:03, Alejandro Tagliaferro arrives. He is greeted by Ms. Williams and the band, and his entrance is met by applause from the crowd. Tagliaferro is ushered onto the stage, where he offers a few polite introductions and thanks the crowd for attending the gala event. He takes his place at his table alongside, presumably, his granddaughter and A. Shaw.\n\n\nLayla Williams and the lounge band proceed to play their set for roughly the next hour and twenty minutes. They always play the exact same setlist, with the single exception of \"Down to the River to Pray\" if requested by Mrs. Snider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of These Days\n - Sophie Tucker\n\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n - Bessie Smith\n\n\nAfter You've Gone\n - Marion Harris\n\n\nThere'll Be Some Changes Made\n - Ethel Waters\n\n\nHow Can I Hope to Change\n - Layla Williams\n71\n\n\nI Ain't Got Nobody\n - Marion Harris\n\n\nBeale Street Blues\n - Alberta Hunter\n\n\nT'aint Nobody's Business If I Do\n - Sara Martin\n\n\nA Good Man is Hard to Find\n - Marion Harris\n\n\nLay Me Down\n - Ezekial Williams\n\n\nI've Seen the Mountaintop\n - Ezekial Williams\n\n\nGotta Have Quick Feet\n - Ezekial Williams\n\n\nSugar Blues\n - Eva Taylor\n\n\nYou Can't Keep a Good Man Down\n - Bessie Smith\n\n\nNobody Knows You Like Me\n - Layla Williams\n\n\nBenny and the Band\n - Benjamin Wright\n\n\nSing Me One More\n - Layla Willaims\n\n\n(Optional) Down to the River to Pray\n - Spiritual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the band reaches the end of the setlist, Mr. Cannon will get up from his table and join Mrs. Yates-Moore and Mr. Murray at his. Seeing this, Senator Blacklock will also rise to join them. At the conclusion of the set, the four conspirators will make a show of moving together towards Tagliaferro's table to make their public confrontation. The initial confrontation rarely changes, and an example transcript of this interaction is included below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947 Event Log\n\n24/11/2019\n\n\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n (\nAs they approach\n) A lady should not keep company with desperate men.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n (\nloudly\n) A thief should not keep company with honest men.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Honest men. That's interesting.\n\n\nThe other instances of SCP-8947-1 turn to look at the sound of the disruption.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n (\nraising his voice\n) The way I see it, Alejandro, this is an opportunity. Right here, before all these people, you clear your name. You show us what\u2019s in the vault.\n\n\nThere is a murmur in the room.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n (\nexhales, as if amused\n) The vault.\n\n\nCANNON:\n (\ncalm but cold\n) It\u2019s simple. You open it, and if there\u2019s nothing there - well, we owe you an apology.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n (\nvery loud\n) Hell of a thing to find out you\u2019re not a crook in front of a crowd.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n What exactly are you expecting to find inside the vault of a casino?\n\n\nMore murmering.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n The money, Alejandro. Gerald Moore's hard earned gains.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n All this scheming\u2026 for some money?\n\n\nSenator Blacklock appears unsettled by the casual response.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n \nSome money.\n It's seventy-five million dollars. Seventy-five million that belongs to \nme\n.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Yes, I'm certain \nyou\n of all people would think such a debt would be owed to you. Would that it existed.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Hrmm? What are you trying to say?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Gerald Moore was a good man. Honest with his money, when he had it. I only knew him when he did not, and he certainly did not give it to me.\n\n\nThe murmering turns to whispering.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n (\nAppearing nervous\n) She claims he told her-\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n \nYou're a liar\n. He didn't need to tell me anything - I have the receipts. I know you have that money!\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Money that would no doubt go to his children, if it existed, but as I've already said - there is no such sum in my possession.\n\n\nMURRAY:\n Prove it then! Prove it! She said it's in that vault. If you've got that money in there, then we'll know you're a liar. Hell, if you don't - I'll buy you a beer myself.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n You really want to do this?\n\n\nThis is seemingly addressed to Cannon specifically.\n\n\nCANNON:\n We want an answer.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Very well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conspirators will then lead Tagliaferro out of the lounge and towards the casino floor. They are followed by a large gathering of spectators - hotel guests, staff, and others. Almost all the notable players are in this group, including Olivia Phillips. Clark Avery is also among the mass of people moving towards the casino, seemingly looking for Mrs. Phillips.\n\n\nThe group arrives at the casino floor around 22:30. As Mr. Cannon and his gang get into formation in front of the group, several members of casino security, notified ahead of time of what was transpiring, take up positions around the casino floor and on the walkways on the second and third floors.\n\n\nThey stop just short of the fissure in the center of SCP-8947, in the location where the vault used to be. There is the sound of jingling keys, likely coming from Tagliaferro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8947 Event Log\n\n24/11/2019\n\n\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n I told you one time, Vince. I don't know if you remember it the same way I do. We can't stay the same way forever. We all have to change.\n\n\nCANNON:\n I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n I was afraid you wouldn't. It's just me, then. (\nPauses\n) There's still time to walk away.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n \nOpen it\n.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n If you insist.\n\n\nThere is the sound of keys clicking in a lock. A heavy mechanism is triggered, and large steel elements can be heard sliding against each other. A moment later there is a much heavier sound as something is released, and the sound of the vault door sliding open.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n What\u2026 what the hell is this?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n You tell me.\n\n\nThe conspirators take a cautionary step back. Persons in the back of the mob push forward to try and look inside.\n\n\nYATES-MOORE:\n No\u2026 no, I\u2026 I didn't think\u2026\n\n\nCANNON:\n What is it? \nWhat is it?\n\n\nA voice in the back of the crowd cries out.\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n What is it? Is it the money?\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n He's a thief, isn't he? That money shouldn't be his!\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n No, it's\u2026 stop, we need to\u2026\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n He might have stole from us! That's our money in there!\n\n\nUNKNOWN VOICE:\n Our gold!\n\n\nBenjamin Murray vomits and faints. Mrs. Yates-Moore begins to push her way backwards into the crowd. She is openly weeping.\n\n\nCANNON:\n What is this, you bastard? What have you done?\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n I told you, Vince. It can't just be this.\n\n\nMr. Cannon pulls out his firearm and aims it - not at Tagliaferro, but at the vault behind him. A shot rings out, and then another. Hotel security swarms down into them as Cannon's gang, now including a large contingent of persons armed with whatever they can grab from around the casino floor, surge forward. Senator Blacklock is pushed to the ground. Elsewhere in the back of the crowd, Clark Avery attempts to push forward, searching for Olivia Phillips.\n\n\nBLACKLOCK:\n Please!\n\n\nAudible through the growing cries of the crowd is Tagliaferro, speaking to someone else who cannot be seen. While it is hard to make out, it seems as if he says \"the room\", \"take her\", and \"safe\".\n\n\nA riot breaks out. Casino security attempt to push back the mob, many of whom now try to beat them back with improvised weapons. More gunshots are heard. It is pandaemonium\n72\n. \nThroughout the din, Mr. Avery calls out for Mrs. Phillips.\n\n\nAVERY:\n Olivia! Olivia!\n\n\nMrs. Phillips, seeing an opportunity, moves quickly through the mob towards Geno Bellucci, who is standing near the front of the group next to Mr. Cannon. As she approaches, she pulls out her knife, staring at him. As she closes the distance, she makes one final leap forwards and extends the knife out in front of her. At the last minute, Mr. Bellucci sees her and turns sideways. She stumbles and falls forwards, hitting the ground right at the edge of the fissure, but not before the knife sticks into something invisible at around waist height.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n No\u2026 no, no, \nNO!\n\n\nThe room grows silent, and all attention turns towards the vault. There is the sound of panicked gasping, and then something small and soft hitting the ground, before slipping off the edge of the fissure and falling down into the dark.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n Not again\u2026 please, not again\u2026\n\n\nPHILLIPS:\n Wait, no, I didn't\u2026\n\n\nThe ground begins to shake. There is the sound of something burning inside the vault.\n\n\nCANNON:\n I just\u2026 (\nlaughs\n) I just can't believe it\u2026 it's never your\u2026\n\n\nA low, rumbling sound emanates from beneath them. A thick green haze begins to rise from within the fissure, quickly approaching the top.\n\n\nTAGLIAFERRO:\n (\nQuietly\n) \u2026it's here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 22:51, Protocol Montezuma-11 begins. Please refer to the containment procedures for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Protocol Montezuma-11 was created under the supervision of the Site-56 Game Theory Research Group and the Site-87 Occult Studies Division.\n\n\n2\n. Specifically, this substance causes severe and immediate lesions across the body wherever it touches. As these lesions intensify, the substance begins to break down body fats and lipids, creating a thick, fatty fluid that begins to seep from the skin. The only deterrent to this substance is salt, which must be applied in a powdered form to the bodies of all individuals participating in Protocol Montezuma-11, and protective body suits, which must also be coated in powdered salt beforehand.\n\n\n3\n. These cuts do not need to be especially deep, only so much that blood is spilled over SCP-8947-A.\n\n\n4\n. Tagliaferro inherited his father's company, Tag Railways, a minor rail venture local to the American southwest, and widely expanded its influence over the decade following his father's death in 1904. At its peak, his Pan-Pacific Railway Company operated lines that ran the full length of the Pacific coast and into Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\n\n5\n. Tagliaferro specifically belonged to an unnamed group of occultists devoted to the research of and subservience to a specific greater demon. In collected texts from Tagliaferro's ruined hotel library, this demon is called \"Pan Hun\", and is described as a demon of transfiguration. Service to this demon is now considered an offshoot of neo-sarkicism.\n\n\n6\n. When and how these entities can be interacted with is the subject of considerable study. They are primarily only semi-incorporeal, which is to say, they can be interacted with physically by non-anomalous human subjects and personnel, but only within reason. If a person were to take an action that would have seemed profoundly unusual during the original period of the original loop, SCP-8947-1 instances will typically become fully incorporeal and act as if the action never occurred. This has happened before when attempting to push or pull entities with any significant force, as well as if taking lethal action against them. SCP-8947-1 entities can be killed throughout the course of the weekly cycle, but only by other SCP-8947-1 entities or actions that befall them as a result of their own behaviour.\n\n\n7\n. Aside from obvious differences in size, general shape, sex, etc, the instances are otherwise identical.\n\n\n8\n. Referred to internally as \"the script\"\n\n\n9\n. Occasionally large variations can occur, which almost always require immediate intervention from Foundation game strategists to correct the outcome of SCP-8947's activation cycle and prevent a breach of containment.\n\n\n10\n. To a certain extent. It is not currently believed that the instances necessarily remember previous cycles, however, they do tend to alter their behaviour based on the outcomes of past cycles.\n\n\n11\n. Depth testing within SCP-8947-A has been inconclusive.\n\n\n12\n. The exact value of gold is seemingly random within a certain limit, though this amount has trended upwards since SCP-8947\u2019s discovery.\n\n\n13\n. Specifically, in situations where shaped charges are used, personnel find the charges to be defective or otherwise nonfunctional. When attempting to enter through the door or wall with a cutting implement such as an ax or motorized saw, the implements themselves become dysfunctional. Attempts to enter through an exterior window have resulted in three personnel falling from their harnesses, and another developing an immediate and acute fear of heights upon reaching the top floor suite.\n\n\n14\n. Now Kervier International.\n\n\n15\n. While not otherwise notable due to their lack of involvement in the events transpiring over the weekend, Mr. Beaumont and Ms. Goldstein \nare\n notable due to their being suspected aliases for George Blankenship and Stella Marie Davis, notorious jewel thieves believed to have stolen $600K in diamonds and other valuable gems (roughly $12.6M in 2025) from sixteen different properties between 1915 and 1921. Despite their infamy, the two appear to have had no ulterior motive for being at the hotel and were only enjoying a weekend together - close observation of them over numerous cycles has revealed nothing other than general relaxation during the time they spent at the hotel. George Blankenship and Stella Marie Davis were never found and were assumed to have either perished or fled the country, and later investigation revealed the names Beaumont and Goldstein as being aliases they had adopted while traveling abroad. Despite their suspected wealth, these two individuals do not carry large amounts of money on them, and are of little importance in the grand scheme of SCP-8947's activation cycle. The location of their stolen gems are still unknown.\n\n\n16\n. Context implies this is Tagliaferro.\n\n\n17\n. If Mrs. Blacklock and Mr. Ides are interrupted by someone entering the closet, Mr. Ides will flee and Mrs. Blacklock will return to her room for the rest of the day. If she is not present in the casino on the first night, Mrs. Jasper will not hit her jackpot, the contents of which are required to neutralize a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n18\n. This conversation cannot be interrupted, as it precedes a conversation between Mr. Snider and Mr. Avery on Saturday night that is required to neutralize a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n19\n. If Walter Baker is followed during this, he will not find the door and will not later find the Small Vault, the contents of which are required to efficiently satisfy a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n20\n. This conversation is otherwise unremarkable and not necessarily relevant to the greater narrative throughline of the weekend, but is notable for having the only single line of repeated dialogue out of every conversation that has been recorded for as long as the Foundation has been monitoring SCP-8947. While most other conversations maintain the same general outcome, the words used are not always consistent, with this single exception. The line in question follows Mr. Avery asking Mrs. Phillips to be careful and that men like Bellucci are known to take advantage of young women like her, to which she invariably replies \"He'll bleed before I do.\"\n\n\n21\n. For reasons that will become immediately apparent, Mr. Cannon cannot be thrown out of the hotel. If Mr. Cannon is not present in the hotel on Friday night, he cannot win the game of cards he plays with Tagliaferro, the winnings of which are required to neutralize a Montezuma-11 event. Additionally, he must be present Saturday night to organize the meeting of the conspirators that is required to even begin a Montezuma-11 event. Foundation personnel must intervene and convince hotel security to allow Mr. Cannon to return to his room.\n\n\n22\n. It is possible for Mrs. Phillips to miss this conversation, which results in her taking Mr. Avery's advice on Sunday morning and not being in the lounge on Sunday night. To avoid this, she must be compelled to linger long enough by Mr. Murray's table in order to hear the conversation between her boss and The Entrepreneur.\n\n\n23\n. This must be dissuaded. If Senator Blacklock and Ms. Williams engage in any sexual activity, Mrs. Blacklock will later attempt to kill the Senator, and both must be alive in order to properly neutralize a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n24\n. During several cycles, Ms. Williams was influenced to pair with numerous other individuals, and did so eagerly, seemingly due to a past romantic relationship that had recently ended. However, while none of these pairings resulted in the production of additional gold, there is one pairing that, with Walter Baker (the groundsman), if introduced on Thursday, can result in Walter Baker finding the Small Vault before Saturday and, potentially, discovering the Secret Vault on Saturday. This pairing has proven difficult to reproduce, as Ms. Williams has developed a mild repulsion to Walter Baker and tends to avoid him when they are near each other. It was later discovered that her greatest value is in her ability to engage in a sexual encounter with Mrs. Jasper on Friday, detailed below.\n\n\n25\n. Layla Williams was known for suffering from manic depression, likely a result of her lifestyle and the actions of her manager, Big James Fieldman, who kept her on an extremely strict schedule of performances (both at the hotel lounge and elsewhere) and was said to maintain the frantic pace with a steady supply of barbiturates and stimulants.\n\n\n26\n. Occasionally, Mrs. Jasper will attempt to leave Mrs. Blacklock and return to her husband in their hotel room. This cannot be allowed. Her jackpot winnings are required to neutralize a Montezuma-11 event.\n\n\n27\n. Originally, several attempts were made to forego the activation of the Montezuma-11 Event entirely by dissuading Olivia Phillips from taking the knife from the kitchen. After several attempts to do so, eventually Olivia was convinced to take romantic interest in Geno and did not take the knife from the kitchen. This did not prevent the activation of the Montezuma-11 Event.\n\n\n28\n. It has been theorized that the only reason why this compels Walter Baker to find the vault so early is because this pairing is such a dramatic and unexpected departure from his expected routine that he shows signs of shock, and only happens upon the vault door by accident.\n\n\n29\n. The small vault contains enough gold bullion within to usually satisfy at least 20% of the total value by itself. The presence of the small vault is interesting, as its location and the location of its key are not indicative of Tagliaferro knowing about its existence, especially compared to the Secret Vault, which is considerably more difficult to get into and contains material that could have only been placed there by Tagliaferro himself. It is possible that the small vault was installed by a prior groundskeeper, but records indicate Walter Baker had been employed by the hotel for the previous eight years, and the hotel had only been in operation for just over ten. How it came to be where it was, who filled it with gold, and why it had not been discovered by the head groundskeeper for nearly a decade prior to 1922, is all still unknown.\n\n\n30\n. This is the only time throughout the weekend that sound can be heard in the penthouse, and while the transliteration of the conversation has proven impossible, many observers have described the voices as sad.\n\n\n31\n. This call is one of the great unknowns within SCP-8947. Considering what takes place after receiving this call it can be assumed that the person on the other end of the line is informing Mrs. Blacklock about the infidelity in question - however, throughout repeated observations of the aforementioned coupling no other persons within SCP-8947 could have possibly witnessed the event take place. Furthermore, Mrs. Blacklock offers no pushback against the allegations (if they are allegations), implying that the person on the other end of the line is someone she trusts or, perhaps more likely, someone providing information she was already expecting to hear. These factors have led researchers to further speculate on the nature of this call, with some believing that it must have originated from Tagliaferro, who may have had ways of gathering information from within the hotel that have either been destroyed or have long since fallen into disrepair, and may have been a person Mrs. Blacklock would have trusted. Regardless, the source of this call remains unknown.\n\n\n32\n. This party contains persons attached to the families owning several Las Vegas casinos, and despite the wealth it can be assumed their families have available none of them make a substantial difference in conducting Montezuma-11.\n\n\n33\n. This letter has raised questions about the nature of Mr. Avery's presence during the events prior to Sunday night. It was originally believed that Mr. Avery was only in attendance due to his employer, Adolph Ochs, being unavailable and sending Mr. Avery in his place. However, the contents of the letter indicate that Mr. Avery may have had contacts within relevant financial and law enforcement sectors who were providing him with information, and he was likely (and later confirmed) present at the hotel to follow a lead about a money laundering scheme perpetrated by Vernon Wells on behalf of Benjamin Murray.\n\n\n34\n. This usually happens by accident, typically if My. Avery leaves the letter in the inner pocket of his dinner jacket and the jacket is given to Mr. Murray on accident after Friday evening's meal.\n\n\n35\n. Like the absent individual believed to be Alejandro Tagliaferro, neither A. Shaw or Emilia Fitzwilliams appear as an SCP-8947-1 instance, and are instead represented by an absence that is addressed and interacted with as if otherwise occupied by an SCP-8947-1 instance.\n\n\n36\n. While SCP-8947-A likely did not exist until the final night of the original activation cycle, its presence currently is no less a logistical challenge to the SCP-8947-1 instances, who will not pay notice to SCP-8947-A if it is pointed out, but do still have to navigate around it. It is possible for SCP-8947-1 instances to fall into SCP-8947-A - if this occurs, bystanders will express uncertain fear and anxiety but cannot explain in any detail why they feel this way. Similarly, if SCP-8947-1 individuals who fall into SCP-8947-A are trapped below but not killed by the fall (for example, if they land on one of the many rocky outcroppings within the fissure) they will express an apparent horrific existential dread that does not conclude until the end of the activation period. It is unknown why this dread manifests, though it has been speculated that, since the lower sections of SCP-8947-A are outside the boundary of the resort, these instances may be far enough away from the anomalous influence that created them that they become somewhat self aware, though this awareness has limits and these instances are in no way capable of rational conversation.\n\n\n37\n. This is discouraged, as the most likely outcome is that she wins the card game, taking both Mr. Cannon's and Tagliaferro's winnings with her when she leaves on Saturday morning.\n\n\n38\n. Notably, Mrs. Jasper will resist this theft attempt unless she is absent from the hotel or is otherwise incapacitated. Typically this can be achieved by having Layla Williams get her intoxicated before their sexual encounter, eventually leading to Mrs. Jasper approaching Layla in the hotel foyer while intoxicated and getting thrown out of the hotel. Alternatively, there is a 7% chance that Mrs. Jasper will naturally become injured during her sexual encounter with Layla Williams, and will not be able to get out of bed until after the Montezuma-11 event has taken place.\n\n\n39\n. $1.9B, adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n40\n. A vault that sat where SCP-8947-A is now - the vault itself no longer exists.\n\n\n41\n. Additionally, it is implied that Mr. Murray would use the money to aggressively push bribes with local governments in an attempt to disrupt Tagliaferro's much larger Pan-Pacific Railway Company, which directly competes with his own family's company.\n\n\n42\n. SCP-8947 Head Researcher Kayla Rider filed a report in 2009 due to a slight variation in the conversation had between Tagliaferro and Cannon during their card game on Friday night, wherein Cannon lost the game and, instead of angrily leaving the casino floor as per usual, he instead finished his drink, looked towards the space believed to have been occupied by Emilia Fitzwilliams during the game, and said, \"It's fine, Alejandro. It's always fine. You always get what you want, don't you? Doesn't matter what it costs, you'll have yours, because nothing is ever your fault.\"\n\n\n43\n. This is the secret vault.\n\n\n44\n. There is one strange scenario that can occur wherein Mr. Wells returns to the room while Mrs. Snider is in it, does not realize she is in the room, and enters it while she is still there. There is generally one of two outcomes - either Mrs. Snider becomes indignant at Mr. Wells and attacks him, forcing him to flee, or Mr. Wells makes a poorly conceived attempt to seduce Mrs. Snider as a cover for his being in her room. Neither of these outcomes are ideal for the Opportune Scenario or Mr. Wells - Mrs. Snider attacking Mr. Wells causes him to panic and leave the resort, and Mr. Wells attempting to seduce Mrs. Snider nearly always results in Mrs. Snider threatening to tell her husband, at which point Mr. Wells will either flee or, more rarely, strangle Mrs. Snider and \nthen\n flee the hotel. The breakdown in the script following the latter of these events is catastrophic to the Opportune Scenario, second only to the public killing of Clark Avery later on the same evening. However, there is a third exceedingly rare outcome (observed only twice ever) where Mr. Wells' attempt to seduce Mrs. Snider is successful. The very brief sexual encounter that follows has always resulted in the death of Mr. Wells from a heart attack and Mrs. Snider fleeing the hotel, both of which are not ideal results.\n\n\n45\n. Described in more detail later.\n\n\n46\n. While it seems obvious that the three assailants should be disrupted as much as possible in their attempt to find Clark Avery, something strange happens if Foundation personnel become \ntoo\n disruptive during this period. If any or all of the three men are somehow held up in an \"unbelievable\" way - i.e., a way which implies someone having greater knowledge of the scenario playing out than any of the original occupants would've otherwise, Clark Avery will begin to move in such a way that brings him seemingly purposefully closer to the three men. This has always led to an altercation between them, which Mr. Avery always loses. It is unknown why Mr. Avery does this; one theory indicates that Avery is somehow aware of the presence of the three assassins, and their apparent odd behaviour (due to Foundation intervention) leads him to believe he can take a fight against them and win, if need be. This is simply not the case, as any of the three men are capable of killing Mr. Avery in seconds, and will do so if given the opportunity.\n\n\n47\n. The only way this scenario can in any way be salvaged is if Walter Baker, the groundsman, has located the secret vault and somehow translated the text within and worked out how to perform the ritual described. More information on this is detailed later in this file, but the events that would need to have taken place earlier in the weekend combined with the obscure requirements to even access the secret vault itself mean this outcome is profoundly unlikely, and to date has only been observed once.\n\n\n48\n. This conversation is important for two reasons: it informs Mrs. Yates-Moore about Tagliaferro's presence on Sunday, information she will later pass to the other conspirators on Saturday night, and it raises Mrs. Snider's suspicions about her intentions, information she will later pass to her husband. This conversation is rarely interrupted, but is valuable nonetheless.\n\n\n49\n. Strangely, the source of the injury is seemingly random. Mr. Baker has at different times fallen and broken bones in his arms, hips, and legs, received lacerations both minor and major while trimming hedges, and been concussed while cleaning exterior windows of the hotel. The randomness of these injuries has led some within the research team to theorize that some form of external force is acting upon the \"script\" of SCP-8947, creating instability or uncertainty to disrupt attempts to satisfy Protocol Montezuma-11. This is, of course, only speculation.\n\n\n50\n. In a strange twist of irony, it is likely that Senator Blacklock did not need to get involved in the conspiracy against Tagliaferro to secure his election for governor in 1922. His opponent, Republican businessman James Gault, became embroiled in an investment scandal shortly before the Republican state primary, which he lost to another unpopular Nevada Republican, John H. Miller. Senator Blacklock would have likely been the significantly more popular candidate of the two, even with Tagliaferro's involvement. After Senator Blacklock's death, Nevada public service commissioner James G. Scrugham became the Democratic favorite, winning his primary over James T. Boyd (who was polling 32-68 against Blacklock prior to his death) and later beating John Miller to become Governor of Nevada.\n\n\n51\n. This is, however, provably false. While Mrs. Yates-Moore was the only remaining employee of Gerald Moore's defunct film studio Gateway Pictures, the company was passed to Moore's oldest son, Geoffrey Moore, upon his death. As Geoffrey was in Europe at the time of his father's passing and had not yet returned to the United States to settle his affairs, the company had not yet been shuttered. Any money owed to Gateway Pictures would have passed to Geoffrey as the executor of the estate, and then through him to his younger siblings as noted in the will. More importantly, though, is that the debt - if it existed at all - likely had nothing at all to do with the production studio and was owed to one of Gerald Moore's other companies, all of which passed to his children upon his death.\n\n\n52\n. Zeke Williams would pass away several days later.\n\n\n53\n. There are two other staff members in the office who are similarly working overtime with Mrs. Primrose, but neither of them will answer the door if Mr. Baker knocks and will not leave through the hallway he has access to.\n\n\n54\n. To date, the key for the greenhouse has not been located, leading the research team to believe that it is kept in Tagliaferro's penthouse suite. The location of this key was only determined by trial and error over many repetitions of the cycle specifically designed to encourage Mr. Baker to search the entire hotel.\n\n\n55\n. omne debet mutare\n\n\n56\n. 3422\u00a03353\u00a02352\n\n\n57\n. Danger aside, Mr. Baker is a quiet, timid man who is not a strong speaker and is incredibly uncomfortable around others, but especially around women. The aforementioned Williams/Baker coupling is not only difficult to achieve because of Ms. Williams' aversion to Mr. Baker, but also because Mr. Baker is exceedingly awkward and finds it difficult to communicate with others, let alone seduce them.\n\n\n58\n. A copy of this text exists in the Site-17 general collection.\n\n\n59\n. This is the only ingredient that is missing from the collection.\n\n\n60\n. This is understandably disastrous for the proper implementation of Montezuma-11, but is not the absolute worst case scenario. Mr. Wells still has access to a sizeable portion of gold on his own, and while he will find Mr. Murray's absence unusual he does not have enough time at this point to come to the realization that he has been abandoned.\n\n\n61\n. It is possible this tip came from someone in Tagliaferro's circle due to his and Mr. Murray's competing business interests, but it is considered more likely that the tip came from someone within TransAmerican Railroad, the company owned by Benjamin Murray's older brother, Chester Murray.\n\n\n62\n. Roughly $9.5M USD adjusted for inflation\n\n\n63\n. While the reason for this initially seems uncertain, Murray's comments throughout the weekend seem to make it clear that he did not believe that there was anyone present who could challenge him, not even law enforcement, due to his connections to his far wealthier brother. The fact that he felt the need to steal from that brother is an irony that seemed to be lost on Mr. Murray.\n\n\n64\n. Generally speaking, the arrival of the officers at this point is irrelevant - they cannot physically arrive earlier than the start of Layla Williams' set on Sunday evening because of the travel time required, and if they are delayed enough that they do not arrive by the end of the set (and thus the beginning of Montezuma-11's activation period) they do not carry enough wealth on their person to satisfy the required value of the protocol by any meaningful amount.\n\n\n65\n. This conversation can take place without Benjamin Murray, but his absence is likely to unsettle the other members of the conspiracy, specifically Senator Blacklock, which has on very rare occasions led to Blacklock convincing the others the opportunity has passed them. This almost always leads to Senator Blacklock and Mrs. Yates-Moore leaving before Sunday night, and is extremely detrimental to the outcome of Montezuma-11.\n\n\n66\n. The subject of Vince Cannon's antipathy towards Tagliaferro is another one of the enduring mysteries surrounding SCP-8947. Little is known about their early interactions, but it is known that one of the first major benefactors of Cannon's \nParadise City Gazette\n was one of Tagliaferro's investment companies. It was not until 1913 that the paper began to become more critical of Tagliaferro specifically, taking aim at his business dealings in Nevada and associations with anti-war activists. For his part, Tagliaferro rarely spoke about the paper or Cannon, only being quoted once saying, \"I have met the man, and found him well. I cannot say he felt the same.\"\n\n\n67\n. The voice is notably \nnot\n Tagliaferro, nor anyone else at the hotel. This call, and its contents, have been studied at length by research staff without much success. It is believed that this phone call is directed at Foundation staff specifically, though how that is possible, and where the call would have originated from, are all unknown.\n\n\n68\n. In the one instance where this ritual was completed, the confrontation Sunday night continued took place at the beginning of the evening, instead of at the end, with the hotel staff confronting Tagliaferro as he arrived for dinner instead of the conspirators. The result of that confrontation diverged significantly from the Opportune Scenario, but did successfully fulfill the requirements of Montezuma-11.\n\n\n69\n. Including Las Vegas nightclub owner Rocko Latrell, the cousin of a Reno real estate mogul Michael \"Baby\" Stoops, and \"Jumpin\" Jack Harrison, a prominant semi-professional boxer.\n\n\n70\n. In the event most of the persons in the hotel have left, such as in the case of Clark Avery or Winston Snider being killed, Tagliaferro will go the lounge alone and sit there until shortly before 22:51. He will rise and walk to the edge of the fissure, formerly the location of the casino vault, and disappear sometime shortly afterwards. On one occasion, he could be heard saying, \"Strange. I thought it would be different than this,\" before vanishing.\n\n\n71\n. An original song written by Layla and her father, Ezekial Williams.\n\n\n72\n. This fight, while chaotic, tends to follow similar trends on repeat occurrences. The fight always reaches its resolution right at 22:51, regardless of whether or not Olivia Phillips is in the crowd.",

        "Addendum 8947.1: Hotel and Casino Layout\nThe Spirit Mountain Hotel and Casino is comprised of three primary structures, each linked to the other through a series of hallways and open-air breezeways. The first and largest, just within the main entrance, is the hotel. It is composed of fifteen floors with one-hundred and eighty-six guest staterooms, with the top floor containing a single penthouse and exposed roof access. On the main level of the hotel is a bar, as well as a cocktail lounge and jazz club.\nTo the west of the hotel is the Restaurant Nevada . It is composed of a large dining room, two bars, five private suites, and a stage for performances. In the back of the restaurant is the kitchen, much of which was destroyed by fire. The primary feature of the restaurant is the Overlook Suite, which extends out over the edge of the mountain.\nTo the southwest of the hotel is the casino. It is a five story ornate structure with an open atrium in the center, once covered by a large glass dome. The casino contains a number of various games of chance, including card tables, roulette, and slot machines. On the main floor of the casino is a caged cashier\u2019s desk, through which chips can be exchanged for gold.\nOver time, due to seismic activity from SCP-8947-A and exposure to the elements, the entirety of SCP-8947 has fallen into a state of considerable disrepair. Several areas are no longer easily accessible, or have been destroyed altogether. One room, the penthouse suite within the hotel, cannot be accessed whatsoever, and attempted access from the exterior with shaped charges, as well as through the roof or through any ductwork, inevitably ends in failure. SCP-8947 appears to exert some sort of anomalous influence on these attempts, as the walls themselves do not appear to be impervious 13 .\nLastly, SCP-8947-A has made several areas of the casino lower levels inaccessible. SCP-8947-1 instances who are directed towards these lower levels, or SCP-8947-A in general, will become increasingly upset and agitated, though most are either unable or unwilling to describe why.",
        "Addendum 8947.2: Discovery\nIt is uncertain when SCP-8947 began to display anomalous activity. The fire that broke out and destroyed a significant portion of the structure was reported in the Los Angeles Times, due to the presence of Nevada Senator Dean Blacklock at the gala event. However, after initial investigations of the structure revealed no immediate foul play the building was abandoned, likely due to its remote location.\nIn 1962, two teenagers filed a police report in nearby Laughlin after seeing what they described as interior lights flickering and a green smog surrounding the structure. Investigators were not able to find any evidence of trespassing at the structure, and the case was abandoned.\nIn 1970 a female motorist claimed to have gotten lost on her way to Lake Havasu City from Las Vegas, and ended up at the Spirit Mountain Casino after dark. The woman claimed to have seen a thick green haze billowing out of the lower levels of the structure, and a single light on in the top floor of the hotel, where the silhouette of an individual was visible through the curtains. Additionally, the woman claimed to have heard shouting from within the structure, and to have felt some considerable seismic activity. After seeing what she described as \u201cbodies floating in the mist\u201d, the motorist fled on foot, eventually being picked up by another passing motorist. Local police discovered her car several miles down the road, nowhere near the gated road leading to the hotel. The woman\u2019s story was dismissed.\nIn 2004, a locally televised ghost-hunting program \u201cDemon Hunters\u201d gained permission from the state government to access the facility for one night, in order to record an episode of their show. The episode never aired, and no members of the production team commented on its absence afterwards. However, an anonymous internet user claiming to be a member of the program\u2019s staff (and providing provable details of their employment with the television network) posted several times over a six month period on an internet message board for the amateur supernatural watchdog group \u201cKnights of Truth\u201d. In their posts, the user claims that members of the production team were exposed to spectral entities who begged them for gold, salt, and blood, even going so far as attempting to attack one of the hosts. The event apparently shocked the crew so badly that it was decided that the program would not air the footage, which was later destroyed.\nIn 2007, Foundation assets embedded in the local authorities investigated another claim of supernatural activity at the hotel, and were met with the SCP-8947-1 entities. After deducing the nature and structure of SCP-8947, a permanent forward operating base was established outside the structure.",
        "Addendum 8947.3: Protocol Montezuma-11\nProtocol Montezuma-11 was developed by a joint team of Foundation occultists, game theorists, and historians. It was originally believed that the origin of the fault within SCP-8947 was natural and it was only the SCP-8947-1 instances that were anomalous - however, study of information collected from within SCP-8947, specifically the hotel and casino, as well as sigils and markings from within the fault itself, led to the conclusion that SCP-8947-A was a result of paranatural influence upon the earth itself emanating from within the resort.\nThe intended result of Montezuma-11 is to mitigate the final cost in gold to satisfy the conditions of the activation event. This includes subtly guiding SCP-8947-1 instances into situations and relationships that will be financially lucrative, and making sure wealthy individuals (or those who carry with them a large amount of wealth) are alive and present for the end of the event on Sunday night. Until the Foundation became involved in SCP-8947's containment it is believed that the success of the Sunday night ritual was entirely up to chance , though the growth of SCP-8947-A does not accurately align with the expected growth given the likelihood of a successful outcome on any given week ( Note: This information is now believed to be outdated. Further investigation is required. )\nThe secondary intention of Protocol Montezuma-11 is to further investigate the cause of SCP-8947's creation, the origin of which is thusfar unknown.\n",
        "Addendum 8947.4: SCP-8947-1 Instances\nEach instance of SCP-8947-1 corresponds to a different individual who perished the night of the earthquake and fire. While many of the instances are relatively unknown invites to the gala event, several individuals were particularly noteworthy. Their identities, actions and behaviours are listed below. For ease of access in the timeline detailed in Addendum 8947.5, each individual has been given an identifier name.\nIn total, 256 individual instances of SCP-8947-1 are present within SCP-8947. Three individuals were reported dead but are not present within the SCP-8947-1 instances, these being Alejandro Tagliaferro, his granddaughter, Emilia Fitzwilliams, and an individual listed as \u201cA.
