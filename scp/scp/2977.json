Estimated current depth is 1.7\u00a0km.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2977\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the unpredictability of the emergence of SCP-2977-2, SCP-2977 has been publicly designated as a critically endangered species and provided protection under the multilateral CITES treaty. Non-anomalous research data may be considered for public release at the discretion of the Lead Researcher.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Upsilon-7 (\"The Glass Jar\u201d) are to monitor international conservation groups for descriptions matching SCP-2977-1. MTF \u03d2-7 are to investigate possible instances, locate SCP-2977-2 using chemical pheromone tracking and ground-penetrating radar, and convert affected areas into Provisional Sites under the guise of preservation efforts.\n1\n SCP-2977-2 must be located before full containment is enacted.\n\n\nDue to the extreme rarity of both SCP-2977-1 and SCP-2977-2, future excavation attempts must be approved by both the O5 Council and the current coordinator of Project Longfellow.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2977 are a species of eusocial insect of the family \nFormicidae\n, commonly known as ants. SCP-2977 members are black in color and reach between 13\u00a0mm and 20\u00a0mm in length depending on caste. SCP-2977 are externally distinguishable from other \nFormicidae\n by their limited reproduction cycle and the characteristic \"rainbow\" or \"bullseye\" pattern of debris surrounding their colonies. SCP-2977 also cultivate unusual food species in underground reservoirs in a pattern of agriculture-like mutualism, including \nAmblyopsidae\n (Blind cave fish) and tardigrades.\n\n\nSCP-2977 colonies, designated SCP-2977-1, expand almost directly downward to extreme depths, rarely exceeding 1.5\u00a0m in diameter below the surface. SCP-2977-1 are known to extend below 15\u00a0km, the maximum depth currently attainable by Foundation technology. The concentric circle pattern of debris surrounding each SCP-2977-1 is created when SCP-2977 members bring excavated material from the deepest point in their colony to the surface, with deeper minerals forming new rings as older debris are pushed outward.\n\n\nSCP-2977-1 are considered \"mature\" when they reach an estimated final depth of \u2588\u2588 km and cease producing new debris. (A summary of minerals surrounding a \"mature\" instance is available in Addendum 2977-1.) Mature colonies produce nuptial flights of male and fertile queen SCP-2977 members in order to produce new SCP-2977-1. This occurrence is extremely infrequent, and has only been observed 16 times across all Sites since initial containment in 1914.\n\n\nSCP-2977 instances have not displayed digging capabilities superior to those of non-anomalous \nFormicidae\n. Based on observations of expanding debris patterns around multiple SCP-2977-1 over time, it is estimated that the time required for a new SCP-2977-1 instance to reach a \u201cmature\u201d depth is \u2588\u2588\u2588 years.\n\n\nSCP-2977-1 are always found in close proximity to a \u201csource\u201d colony, designated SCP-2977-2. SCP-2977-2 emerge sporadically in areas of high volcanic and tectonic activity, primarily in the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d. It is believed that SCP-2977-2 originate at an unknown depth and expand upwards until they break the surface, leaving only entry tunnels visible.\n\n\nUnlike typical SCP-2977 queens, queens emerging from SCP-2977-2 are wingless and reproduce by asexual parthenogenesis. SCP-2977-2 queens also display significant genetic aberrations from SCP-2977-1-produced queens. (Genetic analysis results are available in Document 2977-2.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2977-1: Site-2977-\u03b1 Colony Debris Pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic available: Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of circular debris bands surrounding SCP-2977-1-\u03b1-05, a \"mature\" instance that has not produced new debris in over 40 years.
