Site-AE7 works in conjunction with Site-65 and Site-177 to comprise the SCP Foundation Saskatchewan Operational Region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\u00a05121\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Event\u00a05121\n\n\n\n\nOn 03/22/2014, all Foundation facilities within Saskatchewan and neighboring provinces received a \"Code 0X1\" alert, indicating all external connections to and from Site-AE7 had suddenly ceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALERT: 0X1 - 0X1\n\n\n\n\nUnable to ping SITE-AE7. Contact Site Administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Gate-1 (\"Timekeepers\") was dispatched to the site and established a perimeter upon reporting the site as missing. When no changes were recorded following activation of a Scranton Reality Anchor, a search of the site grounds commenced in an effort to uncover what had happened. The search was halted when two Foundation agents entered the site grounds and appeared to demanifest.\n\n\nSeveral tests were performed between 03/22/2014 and 03/30/2014 on the former site grounds to determine the scope of its effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote Surveillance Drone with audio and video feeds.\n\n\nThe drone was piloted above the test site before being slowly lowered towards it.\n\n\nUpon descending approximately 25 meters above the site, the signal from the drone was lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-10754, equipped with audio and video recording devices.\n\n\nSubject entered the test site as directed.\n\n\nSubject appeared to demanifest. Audio and video feeds cut off at the exact moment of disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-10556, equipped with audio and video recording devices and a steel cable tethered harness.\n\n\nSubject entered the test site after being persuaded by guards.\n\n\nTest results mirror those of the previous. The steel cable was severed near the harness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing review of these test results, further attempts at exploration were deemed futile. The perimeter of the site remains secured. Further testing proposals will require Level-B review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5121\u00a0Contact\u00a0Log\u00a0A\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Contact\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOn 07/13/2015, Foundation servers indicated several restored and attempted connections from Site-AE7.

Depending on several variables, conditions may be met where the temporal flow is halted but the affected portion of reality continues to exist, suspended from local time. This phenomena is relatively simple and is generally easy to reverse by stabilizing local Hume levels.\n\n\nDiscrepancies within a spatio-temporal environment, despite appearing to contradict them, generally manifest within the confines allowed by physics. When the converse of the above occurs and the spatial continuum of an area is halted though the temporal flow continues, several reactions are expected to occur. When matter is suspended from space, the law of conservation of energy remains true. As a result, the affected matter enters a state of \"Paradoxical Existence\", in which it exists in some form outside of baseline reality. Should the law hold true, matter entering such an affected area will be subjected to the same state.\n\n\nParadoxical Existence differs from the more commonly known \"pocket dimension\". While a pocket dimension is a dimensional space separate from baseline reality, Paradoxical Existence is a state of existence in which a portion of baseline reality exists outside of itself.\n\n\nThe resulting area of non-existence left behind in baseline reality is known as the \"break horizon\". To the naked eye, this area appears to be unaffected by discrepancies. However, the fact of the matter is that the affected area no longer exists; the observer instead sees the continuing landscape opposite of the break horizon in place of the reality gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5121\u00a0Contact\u00a0Log\u00a0B\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Contact\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOn 07/14/2015, Dr. Williams and Dr. Atmos made contact with Site-AE7 again.\n\n\n\n\nSCPiNET v3.0.4\n\n\nTerminal:\n 065.1\n\n\nAuthorization:\n site65.williams\n\n\n\n\nSending connection request\u2026\n\n\nRequest granted.\n\n\nConnected to siteae7.paroux\n\n\n[09:07] 065.1:\n Dr. Holton, are you there?\n\n\n[09:07] AE7.2:\n FINALLY\n\n\n[09:07] AE7.2:\n I thought my terminal stopped working\n\n\n[09:08] AE7.2:\n This is Liam by the way.

This is Doctor Brian Holton, Lead Reality Expert of Site-AE7 which now appears to be permanently fucked. It's fair to say I know a thing or two about paradoxical existence; I wrote the damn book. I guess it's all true too. What an ending.\n\n\nI can literally feel myself being torn apart at the atoms when I stand near the fence, but it seems stable enough. That's definitely the break horizon on the other side. There's the tiniest breeze, so air from the break horizon must end up here too; explains why we haven't suffocated. The site's backup generator still works too, it runs off of CO2 so it's actually taking care of the air we breathe out\u2026 We've been able to survive this long because of it.\n\n\nWe ran out of food yesterday. Luckily, Paroux managed to get a terminal connected to the outside. It was nice to catch up at first. I asked them to send some supplies. It's for the others, not me. I already know there's no way out.\n\n\nAnne, I know you aren't ever going to see this, but I love you. I love you so much. I want to hold your hand, hug you, kiss you. I know you think I'm dead and that I have been for a while\u2026 I just hope there's some part deep inside you that knows I love you and haven't stopped since I ended up here. I won't be able to see you again in this life, but maybe there's hope that we'll meet in the next.\n\n\nSee you soon, Anne.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing confirmation of Dr. Holton's death, Dr. Atmos returned to Site-177.\n\n\n\n\nSCPiNET v3.0.4\n\n\nTerminal:\n 065.1\n\n\nAuthorization:\n site65.williams\n\n\n\n\nSending connection request\u2026\n\n\nRequest granted.\n\n\nConnected to site177.atmos\n\n\n[17:44] 065.1:\n I'm sorry, Dr. Atmos.

Everything seems to hold true during testing as well. I don't blame him for wanting to see his wife, I just didn't expect him to do\u2026 this.\n\n\n[17:45] 065.1:\n I don't understand\u2026 Why would he kill himself shortly after making contact with us? He went over a year without anything before\u2026\n\n\n[17:45] 177.4:\n He went that year with hope. I'd guess that it affected him heavily once he figured out Anne thought he was dead. It seemed to be the only thing giving him strength.\n\n\n[17:45] 065.1:\n So is the site lost, then?\n\n\n[17:46] 177.4:\n Not necessarily.

Documentation from Site-AE7 is sent to Site-65 via .log and .scp format on a monthly basis for review. Foundation staff members awaiting termination and deemed low-risk may instead opt to be permanently reassigned to Alternate Researcher.

        "Chapter 13-3: Paradoxical Existence Authored by: Dr. Brian Holton Certain phenomena have demonstrated a clear separation between spatial and temporal continuums, in contrast to the common belief that the two are intertwined and inseparable. Depending on several variables, conditions may be met where the temporal flow is halted but the affected portion of reality continues to exist, suspended from local time. This phenomena is relatively simple and is generally easy to reverse by stabilizing local Hume levels. Discrepancies within a spatio-temporal environment, despite appearing to contradict them, generally manifest within the confines allowed by physics. When the converse of the above occurs and the spatial continuum of an area is halted though the temporal flow continues, several reactions are expected to occur. When matter is suspended from space, the law of conservation of energy remains true. As a result, the affected matter enters a state of \"Paradoxical Existence\", in which it exists in some form outside of baseline reality. Should the law hold true, matter entering such an affected area will be subjected to the same state. Paradoxical Existence differs from the more commonly known \"pocket dimension\". While a pocket dimension is a dimensional space separate from baseline reality, Paradoxical Existence is a state of existence in which a portion of baseline reality exists outside of itself. The resulting area of non-existence left behind in baseline reality is known as the \"break horizon\". To the naked eye, this area appears to be unaffected by discrepancies. However, the fact of the matter is that the affected area no longer exists; the observer instead sees the continuing landscape opposite of the break horizon in place of the reality gap.",
