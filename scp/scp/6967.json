No personnel are allowed to touch SCP-6967 unless permitted otherwise by the Site Director for testing purposes. All personnel who handle SCP-6967 are to wear full body protective suits in the event that the object must be removed from its containment. Those who do not follow the directions above will be reprimanded, given that they are not terminated by the SCP.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6967 is a superhero doll. Upon the chest and cape of SCP-6967 are standard hazard symbols. Whenever a sapient organism comes in direct contact with the object they will instantaneously be teleported into the atmosphere, directly above the position they were previously in. The subject who touched SCP-6967 will then begin their rapid descent towards the ground. After nearly 10 minutes the subject will impact the ground, which invariably leads to death in all cases.\n\n\nWhenever an organism is teleported, SCP-6967 will stay behind on the surface it was resting upon previously, and has proven to be impervious to damage coming from falling subjects it has transported. However, SCP-6967\u2019s anomalous effects do not inhibit individuals from moving it, provided that their body does not touch the object directly (i.e. skin contact).\n\nIt is unknown how SCP-6967 teleports subjects who come into contact with it, however research has revealed that the object may have some level of understanding of its actions, as no efforts thus far to stop the termination of those under SCP-6967\u2019s effect have been successful due to anomalous means. The origins as well as the motivations of the SCP, if any, are as of yet undetermined.\n\n\nAddendum 6967.01:\n Test logs\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nThe following logs are of the experiments conducted using SCP-6967\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN TEST LOGS]\n\n\nAction:\n\nD-Class equipped with a radio and microphone instructed to touch object\n\n\nResult:\n\nD-Class fell from the atmosphere screaming and refusing to cooperate with researchers. Subject terminated on impact\n\n\nAction:\n\nD-Class equipped with radio, microphone and parachute instructed to touch object\n\n\nResult:\n\nD-Class\u2019 parachute malfunctions and is unable to be deployed. D-Class panics and states they feel as though a hand is blocking the AAD\n1\n Subject terminated on impact\n\n\nAction:\n\nD-Class equipped radio, microphone and experimental jetpack instructed to touch object\n\n\nResult:\n\nD-Class reports jetpack is being tampered with by an unknown force before plummeting towards the ground. D-Class struggles to regain control of the device, however the straps securing the subject are destroyed and the D-Class is removed from the jetpack. Subject terminated on impact\n\n\n[END TEST LOGS]\n\n\n\n\nAs of now testing for SCP-6967 has ceased indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6967.02:\n Discovery\n\nSCP-6967 was discovered July 15, 2006 in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Texas when a Foundation agent embedded within the local law enforcement received a call notifying the police of two brutal killings caused by an alleged \u201cinvisible monster\u201d. Agent Linedecker and his partner arrived on the scene to find viscera and human parts strewn across a 15 meter radius of an abandoned oil rig site. The following messages were sent to Foundation staff from Linedecker to request the aid of MTF Epsilon-6 shortly after arriving on the scene:\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Discovery\u00a0Thread\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Discovery\u00a0Thread\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n help neED HELP NOW SEND MF ASS AP\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n SEND MTF ASAP* SORRY. PLS HURRY THERE IS BLOOD EVERYWHERE ITS FUCKNG INDIVISIBLE\n\n\nFoundation Respondant:\n Stay calm, we will arrive with help soon, what is the anomaly you\u2019re dealing with and how severe is the situation?\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n INVISIBLE* SRY. IT TOOK MY MAN IN ITS POCEKT DIMENSON AND\n\nFUCKING SPIT OUT HIS GUTS AND BLOOD HURRY URGETN\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n SEND THE VILAGE IDIOTS OR SOME THONGS\n\n\nFoundation Respondant:\n Sending Mobile Task Force your way, hang in there.\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n SOMETHING* SRRY. HURRY KETER\n\n\nAgent Linedecker:\n ACTION FIGURE? wtf\n\n\nFoundation Respondant:\n Is that another typo?\n\n\nFoundation Respondant:\n Agent Linedecker?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6967.03:\n MTF Epsilon-6 arrived heavily armed to contain the presumed highly aggressive and threatening anomaly exactly 9 minutes after the last message was sent. The following transcript of SCP-6967\u2019s retrieval was recovered by Agent Trevors\u2019s communication device\u2019s recording of the events that unfolded.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0Retrieval\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Retrieval\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Okay team, this is where our guy\u2019s phone was last trackable, it\u2019s gotta be where the anomaly is.\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n No shit this is the place, look at the fuckin blood! Whatever did this is a mean sum\u2019 bitch I\u2019ll tell you that much right now!\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Let\u2019s just hope it hasn\u2019t gotten into a more densely populated area yet, I don\u2019t think I can handle anything more weighing on my conscience.\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n So then where the hell did the damn thing go? Shouldn\u2019t there be bloody footprints at the very least?\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Dispatch said the monster\u2019s probably invisible, and if I had to guess, we\u2019re probably not lucky enough to have it run away cowering from us just like that. Ya\u2019 ask me and I\u2019d say the thin-\n\n\nA loud scream cut short by a splattering sound can be heard over the microphone. It is presumed that Agent Linedecker was under the effect of SCP-6967. All MTF members curse in confusion as this unfolds\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n The hell just happened? What the fuck where did it go?\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Get your gear switched on now, we gotta be able to see it coming or we\u2019re next!\n\n\nThe agents activate the Foundation headgear provided with the intention of detecting invisible anomalies through heat vision. They mutter to themselves frantically about wiping off the blood covering the lenses\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n I-I still can\u2019t see the thing! What do we do? It\u2019s gonna kill us any minute! Guys! I don\u2019t want to die! Guys!\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Shut the fuck up! Jesus, you act all tough with your fingerless gloves and stupid fucking music just shut UP we gotta hear the thing coming!\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Both of you knock it off. Look at the center of the remains! There\u2019s something inorganic there!\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Is that uh\u2026\n\n\nAgent Hodders:\n A fucking toy? Did this thing kill a kid here no fucking way man that\u2019s fucked up-\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Hodder shut up! I\u2019m gonna shoot it, it\u2019s too damn shady!\n\n\nAgent Trevors\n He\u2019s right! This might be the source of this all, there\u2019s no way that doll would just be there unscathed, right? Rasmus stay back, it might be some kind of anomalous bomb!\n\n\nAgent Trevors throws a rock from the ground directly at SCP-6967, which is unaffected apart from falling on its side\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Notta bomb, so one thing left to do. Move outta the way!\n\n\nRunning is heard, as Rasmus approaches the object rapidly\n\n\nAgent Rasmus screams angrily, sounds of him slide-kicking the figure over with his boot, causing it to fly away a short distance\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n \nHeavily breathing\n Okay, now\u2026 it\u2019s cool to git\u2026\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Quickly, contain that toy before the monster comes back! If it\u2019s not anomalous then that thing is still out there!\n\n\nTrevors and Hodder can be heard rushing over to SCP-6967\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Okay, let's get this thing bac-\n\n\nAgent Hodder\n Give me that, man! I\u2019m not as big a pussy as you guys think!\n\n\nAgent Hodder bends down to grab the object\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Wait! Hodder your glov-\n\n\nAgent Hodder disappears as his fingers presumably touched the object\n\n\nSilence for 8 seconds\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Hodder! Hodder where the fuck did you go? You fuckin\u2019 idiot why\u2019d you listen to me!?\n\n\nRasmus continues to scream for a few minutes, Trevor stays silent\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Rasmus, listen to me, we can\u2019t make contact with that thing, it\u2019s gotta be a direct touch that activates its anomalous ability. Let\u2019s finish this and get back home before anything else happens.\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n What about Hodder? Is he gonna end up getting torn apart by that thing\u2019s fucking stand or something? I can\u2019t leave him! We can\u2019t leave him to die!\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Look, Rasmus, I wouldn\u2019t leave him if there was a chance he survives this thing, but what can we do? Just sit here? If we die this mission will all be in vain!\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Asshole, you\u2019re the one with the skin theory right? Put that shit away in a bag or somethin\u2019 and then there\u2019s no more threat!\n\n\nSilence for 3 seconds\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Alright, if this toy is the source of all of this, then the least we can do is see if Hodder can escape this thing.\n\n\nRasmus lets out a sigh of relief and soon after, Trevors can be heard zipping up a bag\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Alright, that does it. Now we wait?\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n I know Hodders' ass would do the same for us..\n\n\nSilence for the next 3 minutes\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Looks like he\u2019s not gonna be coming out of wherever he was taken anytime soon.\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Does that mean you\u2019re ready to go?\n\n\nSilence for 4 seconds\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Let\u2019s just wait a little longer, Rasmus. If this thing hasn\u2019t activated yet then I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem anyt-\n\n\nStatic crackles suddenly as the two intercoms' range connect back with Hodders'\n\n\nSnippets of screaming can be heard growing louder and as time passes the scream cuts out from connection less and less\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Hodder? Is that you? Where are you? Hodder?\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Hodder, if you can hear me tell us what\u2019s going on?? Are you okay?\n\n\nThe screaming dies and is replaced with the sound of rushing wind and sobs\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n G-guys\u2026 I'm scared.. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n What's happening to you?!\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n \nthrough sobs\n I\u2019m falling. I\u2019m falling from so high, and I'm getting so close now\u2026 I\u2019m gonna die, aren\u2019t I? Just like the others?\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n Hey you pussy, you\u2019re gonna be just fine just let us know where you are and we can figure this out! Don\u2019t give up on me like this! You hear me?!\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n You know it\u2019s kind of beautiful\u2026 the view of it all\u2026 this town\u2026 it\u2019s people\u2026.\n\n\nOnly rushing wind can be heard\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Hodder\u2026 you\u2019re gonna make it out okay. We called for backup\u2026 they\u2019ll be here to catch you with some anomaly\u2026\n\n\nAgent Rasmus:\n \nstrained voice\n you piece of shit\u2026 don\u2019t die on me like this\u2026\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n \u2026You know that album I was trying to get you guys to listen to\u2026? The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 one? That's almost all I can hear up here\u2026\n\n\nAgent Hodder:\n Hey\u2026\nsniffling\n I think I can actually see you guys from here\u2026 I guess this is goodbye Trevors\u2026 goodbye Ari\u2026. I'm sorry\u2026\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Rasmus, look out!\n\n\nAgent Hodder impacts the ground and sounds of gore are heard splattering onto the two remaining agents\n\n\nAgent Ari Rasmus weeps softly\n\n\nAgent Trevors:\n Rasmus\u2026 let\u2019s get out of here.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote from Site Director\n\nI have received many requests to conduct more experiments upon SCP-6967 since we ceased testing.
