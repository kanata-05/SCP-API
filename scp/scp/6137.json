We had just enough time to request a weekly shipment of things we're going to need to survive - food, clean water, paper goods, entertainment, that sort of thing - and modify SCP-6137's database entry, but we are currently on a full communications blackout, and will be for\u2026 well, let's not kid ourselves, pretty much forever.\n\n\nSCP-6137 is currently housed in a standard Type 1 Humanoid Containment Cell, but it's allowed to visit the recreation center and mess hall as a reward for its continued cooperation, as well as to help reinforce its existence. You'll be seeing it around the site a lot, by design. We'll be making references to its existence every thirty minutes over the PA, along with twice daily roll calls for all Site-137 personnel, along with any additional names that have been added.\n\n\nWhen in the recreation center and mess hall, do NOT mention anyone not currently assigned to Site-137. We're not going to implement any draconian measures yet, but there are lives on the line. We will not hesitate to enforce this any way we can.\n\n\nIf SCP-6137 mentions the name of someone that isn't Site-137 personnel, immediately inform Drs. Nguyen or Boyette.\n\n\nSite-137's only purpose now is the housing and comfort of SCP-6137.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6137 is a humanoid of indeterminate gender or racial background\n1\n, 2.1 meters tall and about 75 kilos. Its appearance is similar to a human, though with only four fingers on each hand. It is currently very cooperative with Foundation staff and has a gentle disposition.\n\n\nThe only known identifying marks on SCP-6137's body are a pair of similarly designed circular tattoos. The significance of these tattoos is as yet unknown. \nUpdate - 04/07/2014:\n See Addendum 6137.5\n\n\nAnyone learning of its existence will actively attempt to ignore, deny or forget it. From what we can tell, about an hour after learning of its existence or being reminded of such, an outside observer will in some way lose any memory of SCP-6137. It's been different in every observed instance, from contemptuous dismissal to a simple mental block. Any reminder of SCP-6137's existence will cause the affected individual to regain all memory of it.\n\n\nOnce SCP-6137 has learned of a sentient being's existence, if it is not reminded of them within roughly 24 hours SCP-6137 will permanently forget the being and will be unable to create new memories about them. Once SCP-6137 has forgotten them in this manner, they will cease to exist. We still remember them, there's still evidence of their existence, but for all intents and purposes they just suddenly\u2026 aren't. Admittedly, there's the slim possibility that they've just been transferred to a different location, but we're not taking the risk. (See Addendum 6137.3)\n\n\nSCP-6137 will become aware of any sentient being that learns of SCP-6137. Given our current circumstances, we're not exactly sure when SCP-6137 becomes aware of them, but any names it mentions will be added to the roll call in any event.\n\n\nA full list of the people we've lost can be found in the mess hall. Please don't make me add to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Addendum 6137.1 - Interview Log:\n- Addendum 6137.1 - Interview Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 28/03/2014\n\n\nConducting Interview:\n Head of Security Neill Fontaine\n\n\nBackground:\n SCP-6137 had been taken into Foundation custody on 28/02/2014 after approaching a guard at Site-137 and requesting to be contained.

        "Date: 04/07/2014 Conducting Interview: Head of 6137 Hospitality Dr. Francis Boyette Forward: In the past few months, SCP-6137 has been very cooperative with personnel 3 , but has consistently evaded any questions about its past. Hopefully I can stress the importance of what we're doing. Begin Interview - 15:45 Local Time Dr. Boyette: Hey 6137, glad you could take a minute to talk to me. SCP-6137: You're welcome, Doctor. Dr. Boyette: You're fine with us calling you 6137? SCP-6137: I don't recall my real name, so, while not ideal, it's the closest to a name I have. Dr. Boyette: Excellent. And you're getting along well here? SCP-6137: Yes, everything has been going well. I appreciate the people here and what sacrifices you've made. Dr. Boyette: <grumbles> Sacrifices\u2026 Well\u2026 a lot of those sacrifices weren't exactly by choice. SCP-6137: I\u2026 am aware of what you've done for me. And know that I will do all I can to help out here. Dr. Boyette: Good. You know\u2026 one thing that would help is if you could give us a little more of your history. SCP-6137: I have already told you everything I know, Doctor.

SCP-6137: I'm afraid anything I recall won't be of any consequence. Dr. Boyette: Inconsequential sounds great at this point. I'm not going anywhere. SCP-6137: Well, I remember waking near a settlement without a human in sight. I remember it being empty, but I don't necessarily think it started that way. Dr. Boyette: You don't remember? SCP-6137: I was there for days, walking through the streets, talking to myself. Dr. Boyette: Oh\u2026 SCP-6137: Doctor\u2026 I'm not stupid, I know I wasn't there by myself. I know I have holes in my memory. Dr. Boyette: Jesus\u2026 SCP-6137: I\u2019ve been alone for so long and I think it\u2019s my fault\u2026 Dr. Boyette: I know. You\u2026 you have us now. For a while. Let\u2019s talk about something else. What about these tattoos? SCP-6137: These\u2026? Oh, I keep forgetting they're there. Well\u2026 they're words. Dr. Boyette: Words? They don't look like any language I've ever seen. SCP-6137: I received these long ago\u2026 long, long ago. Many thousands of years. Dr. Boyette: Ok\u2026 ? SCP-6137: This one\u2026 Dr. Boyette sighs audibly SCP-6137: This one is a number\u2026 Thirteen thousand, seven hundred seventy one. Dr. Boyette: OK\u2026 And the other? SCP-6137: It reads, \"We have become as gods.\" End of interview"
