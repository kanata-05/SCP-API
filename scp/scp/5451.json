No animals of the family \nSpheniscidae\n are allowed to make contact with the advertisements. SCP-5451-2B instances found to have memetic effects are to be blocked by Foundation Web Crawler \u03a0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af . All materials released by SCP-5451 is to be disseminated as Foundation Cover R621 (\"Online Roleplay\"). In addition, a Foundation web crawler is to track the posts and conversations of SCP-5451-1 instances to detect any anomalous activity.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5451 is a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family \nSpheniscidae\n, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interact with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.\n\n\nSCP-5451-1 are a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that can access the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances are done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turn into SCP-5451-1 instances when they come into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) come in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.\n\n\nSCP-5451-2A instances are flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They are found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that come into contact with SCP-5451-2A turn into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they are enrolled in SCP-5451.\n\nSCP-5451-2B instances are banner ads found on the Internet. They take the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text \"(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!\", or some variation of the text. Subjects that come into contact with an SCP-5451-2B instance have a 25% chance of contributing to penguin conservation efforts using the forums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forum used by SCP-5451-1 instances to communicate\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1.1: Attempted Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances\n\n\nOn 2021/02/01, Junior Researcher Cook was assigned to arrange an interview on the SCP-5451-1 instances to gather general information about SCP-5451 and SCP-5451-2\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Attempted\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Attempted\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic: what's this school about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeep beep lettuce\n\n\nNewbie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, I'm a new student here, and I really really want to learn more about your school, the history behind it, how's the culture here, what are the great stuff to be found here and other stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCody\n\n\n4th Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUgh, newbies like you cluttering up the forums with \"what's this school about? what's the food like?\" and on and on and on\n\nWhy not do your homework and read the FAQ and lurk more around the forums before posting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeep beep lettuce\n\n\nNewbie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, you don't need to be aggressive to me\n\nI'm just asking questions, man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCody\n\n\n4th Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, yes the classic excuse\n\n\"iM jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs\"\n\nHey dummy, most of the questions you have will be answered if you lurk more\n\n@Forster, please close this thread.

After 10 months, Junior Researcher Cook publishes a paper entitled \nThe Culture of SCP-5451: A VIew Into the Life of Anomalous Penguins Through an Online School\n. An excerpt of the paper is available below along with an excerpt of the interviews done by Junior Researcher Cook on SCP-5451-1 instances.\n\nA copy of the full paper and interview log can be received from either Junior Researcher Cook or Senior Researcher Drake.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Culture\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-5451-1\u00a0Instances\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Culture\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-5451-1\u00a0Instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \nFamily Life\n\nSCP-5451-1 instances have a close-knit relationship with their family, not unlike non-anomalous penguins, despite having the mannerisms of non-anomalous humans. In a sense, their relationship with their family is like a fusion between non-anomalous humans and penguins.\n\nSCP-5451-1 instances have a noticeably close relationship with even their cousins thrice removed, as most of them live together in packs, like non-anomalous penguins. However, when it comes time for SCP-5451-1 to leave their house to start their own lineage, they are given a copy of a recipe that both their mother and father made.\n\n\nIn fact, it is a rite of passage for an SCP-5451-1 instances to cook their first meal without the assistance of their parents.\n\nA marriage proposal between two SCP-5451-1 instances consists of cooking a traditional recipe from their families and presenting their meal to the bride/groom.\n\nDue to their food recipes being passed down from generation to generation, SCP-5451-1 instances take great pride in their lineage.\n\n\nBeing a cook is considered to be the highest honor among SCP-5451-1 instances, and recreating their families' dishes while adding their own touch is considered to be one of the important things parent SCP-5451-1 instances must teach to their children.\n\n\n2. \nCuisine\n\nAlthough mainly inspired by American cuisine, the recipes made by SCP-5451-1 instances noticeably have fish in them, with some seaweed mixed in for umami.\n\nMost of the dishes SCP-54511 instances call \"traditional\" are Inuit recipes, suggesting a link between Inuit culture and SCP-5451-1 instances. In addition, most traditional SCP-5451-1 dishes involve some sort of food preservation technique, whether that be fermentation or drying food.\n\nDue to globalization, other methods of cooking food has reached the SCP-5451-1 instances. This has developed their cuisine so much, younger SCP-5451-1 instances are having a hard time developing their own recipes due to the amount of methods possible.\n\n\nSome notable food preparation methods that SCP-5451-1 traditionally use are:\n\n\n\n\nFermentation of fishes\n\n\nFreezing of fishes to be eaten raw\n\n\nDrying of seaweed under the sun for consumption\n\n\nSmoking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0Junior\u00a0Researcher\u00a0Cook's\u00a0Interview\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-5451-1\u00a0instances\u00a0Regarding\u00a0Their\u00a0Cuisine\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0Junior\u00a0Researcher\u00a0Cook's\u00a0Interview\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-5451-1\u00a0instances\u00a0Regarding\u00a0Their\u00a0Cuisine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Topic Thread: Favorite Food?
