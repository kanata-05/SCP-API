Paleontological personnel are allowed to examine it as they consider necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6861 corresponds to the bodily remains of PoI-1860. Prior to its death, SCP-6861 was a living specimen of \nTyrannosaurus rex\n, which, according to eyewitness testimony, was born in February 1809 in the State of Kentucky, USA. Prior to its death, PoI-1860 possessed an anomalous capability by which human observers were unable to perceive SCP-6861\u2019s true nature, instead seeing it as a non-anomalous Anglo-American human male. This, alongside its human-like intelligence, allowed its existence as an anomaly to be concealed from the American Secure Containment Initiative until its death in 1865.\n\n\nWhile at the height of its health SCP-6861 measured 12 meters long and weighed over 7 metric tons. This influenced the SCP\u2019s successful, though short lived, wrestling and military careers.\n\n\nSCP-6861 would, in its adulthood, pursue a career in politics, joining the, at the time anti-slavery, Republican Party and becoming a member of the Illinois house of representatives in 1834, the American House of Representatives in 1842 and eventually participating in the 1860 presidential race.\n\n\nPoI-1860 would eventually die in 1865, following a terrorist attack in Washington\u2019s D.C Ford\u2019s Theatre by confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth, who fatally shot PoI-1860 through the eyesocket while uttering the phrase \u201cSic Semper Tyrannosaurus\u201d. The death of PoI-1860 in this event led to the loss of its anomalous properties, and as a result an extensive coverup by the American Secure Containment Initiative, which would later become the SCP Foundation, took place. A posthumous analysis of Booth\u2019s body revealed it to be a member of the species \nSpinosaurus aegyptiacus\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6860\n | SCP-6861 | \nSCP-6862\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6861\n\" by Guaire, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
