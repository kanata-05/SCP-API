SCP-8072 must be monitored for anomalous temporal events or shifts in personality. Direct interviews are allowed only with approval from Level-4 personnel. Instances where SCP-8072 attempts to \"reform\" a battalion or issue commands must be interrupted immediately.\n\n\nSCP-8072 is known to resist sedation under normal circumstances and exhibits extreme resilience to termination attempts, claiming that he is bound by a \"greater campaign\" beyond death and is confirmed to be an eternal human.\n\n\nIf SCP-8072 manifests war plans or tactical drawings of non-existent battles then, personnel from the Historian Department and relevant researchers must review them promptly for signs of potential historical tampering.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-8072 appears as an adult human male physically identical to Marshal Michel Ney (confirmed to be the French Marshal due to DNA evidence) at the time of his death in 1815. SCP-8072 is 1.8 meters in height and psychically fit and robust, which is accurate from reports during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\n\n\nMichel Ney in Russia; an early example of him using his anomalous powers to turn the tides that were against him by using his valor and inspiring those around him.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8072 shows signs of having lived multiple lives, often referencing events and wars across eras far beyond the scope of the Napoleonic period. He has made remarks about battles fought in the \"stars\" or under unfamiliar empires that predate human civilization.\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-8072's mind differentiates at times, as he switches between various personas\u2014one being the historical Michel Ney, and another that speaks of commanding troops against cosmic invaders or organizing resistance against other astral nations. SCP-8072 believes he is caught in an eternal cycle of command, resurrection, and betrayal. He constantly seeks to \"redeem himself for past failures,\" referring to his blunder at the Battle of Waterloo where he wasted the majority of the French cavalry on the battlefield. \n(Refer to Addendum 8072-1).\n\n\nOccasionally, SCP-8072 showcases spectral visions of soldiers wearing uniforms from multiple periods\u2014Napoleonic \u201cpetite tenue\u201d, modern infantry, and even what appears to be futuristic soldiers. This phenomenon is not related to his actual body and vanishes within minutes.\n\n\nSCP-8072's main anomalous ability presents a high-risk via his anomalous leadership traits. His ability to inspire and encourage loyalty those around him can be a threat, however it should not be slept on that his abilities can also be used in the Foundation's favor. His charismatic and anomalous ability can lead to a temporary boost in bravery and combat efficiency, as individuals drive to follow his orders despite overwhelming odds. When it comes to the battlefield: SCP-8072 seems to predict enemy movement and anticipate battlefield development with remarkable accuracy, allowing him to make real-time adjustments to his tactics. His ability is based on the chaos of war instead of formal training, making him a formidable commander.\n\n\nSCP-8072's fearlessness and valor has contagious effects on those under his command. His willingness to lead up front and headfirst into battle displays an inspiring precedent to those under him. This phenomenon seems to be amplified during the moment of crisis, where SCP-8072's presence can change the tide of battle.\n\n\nSCP-8072 possesses a unique method of communication. SCP-8072's exceptionally great communication ability allows him to convey orders and strategies with exceptional clarity. This psychic moment allows him to reach those under his command in chaos even when traditional communication fails.\n\n\nNote:\n While SCP-8072 can inspire a heightened sense of loyalty and encourage, individuals retain their free will and personal agency. They are more likely to follow his commands or perform exceptionally well due to their emotional and psychological response to his presence. This influence is temporary and situational rather than a form of direct control.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\nSCP-8072 was first sighted in his hometown in Saarlouis, Germany, (was French territory when he was born in 1769), in full Napoleonic uniform (more specifically the \u201cpetite tenue\u201d uniform), unarmed but demanding command of a military detachment. Local authorities initially believed him to be a reenactor, but interrogation revealed knowledge of Foundation personnel and security protocols. SCP-8072 referred to Foundation agents as the real Michel Ney, \u201cDuc d'Elchingen\u201d and \u201cPrince de la Moskowa.\u201d\n\n\nAddendum 8072-1:\n \nExcerpt from Interview 8072-04\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Finkle:\n You said that you fought in the stars. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n\nSCP-8072:\n I cannot spoil too much\u2014one must live the struggle to grasp it fully. I\u2019ve seen triumphs filled with glory and defeat. However, once refreshed; we recycle and march again, setting up our positions and keeping our tactics sophisticated, and simple. Then, we give the enemy hell and cancel out their prior triumphs against us.\n\n\nDr. Finkle:\n What\u2019s your motivation to keep going?\n\n\nSCP-8072:\n The soldiers! They are my reason, we fight like brothers, enjoy victory, drowning in laughter and alcohol. And in defeat, we turn and face the enemy; and continue our march forward back on the battlefield. Without them, I would lack the will to continue; soldiers win battles, generals get credit for them, my Emperor, Napoleon once said. I have seen valor in the very midst of chaos: men holding their own against machines, keeping their comrades morale high and never wavering. These men, willing to die together rather than to view defeat, for a cause greater than themselves, make the very idea of defeat unlikely.\n\n\nDr. Finkle:\n I see, you must have seen some gruesome scenes on your eternal journey. Now tell me; you mentioned space battles and such, can you tell me more about this?\n\n\nSCP-8072:\n No doubt, I have witnessed massacres and brave souls flying through space, and men getting blown to shreds on planets they\u2019ve never seen before. In atmospheres they never fought in; these soldiers manage to rally together and fight for a cause, no matter how far away they are from home. From the edge of the galaxy\u2013to the core of it, these men have witnessed colossal sizes of machine and vessel. Yet knowing their chance of survival is low, they do not waver. This is the same for the opposition; which leads to battles that make the deep void of space look like a red space cloud with the blood flying through the final frontier of the universe, usually without result! Which in turn leads to continuations of fierce fighting in the cosmic ages of chivalry; until one side is completely deprived of ammunition and men.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8072\n\" by addyp786, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
