Once in possession of a viable host, the entity will proceed toward the nearest public space and commence an oratory. The proliferation and duration of possession events appears to positively correlate with SCP-6637\u2019s esteem as perceived by those to whom it has most recently orated. The contents of its speeches have been shown to include sensitive information, including classified Foundation data, in addition to memetic infohazards and novel ideologies which are deemed incompatible with normalcy.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0VIEW\u00a0REVISED\u00a0DOCUMENT\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6637\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n On the fourteenth day of each calendar month, a suitable candidate is to be selected for enactment of the specified procedure.\n\n\nOnly D-Class individuals scoring 42 or above in manual dexterity tests are eligible for candidacy. High-dose opioids are to be administered to the chosen candidate prior to commencement.\n\n\nChosen candidates are to be equipped with a manual rehabilitation glove which has been programmed to perform kinetoglyphic sequence 6637 \u201c\nEldritch Gangsigns\n\u201c. Immediately following commencement of the kinetoglyphic sequence the chosen candidate may demonstrate signs of distress; pending the onset of a possession event, staff are to repeatedly reassure the candidate that the procedure will cause no lasting damage to the muscles or tendons of their hand, and that any discomfort will prove fleeting.\n\n\nImmediately following the onset of a possession event, candidates are to be placed into the recovery position. Care is to be taken to keep the candidates\u2019 airways clear of vomit throughout. Should candidates experience seizure, the use of physical restraints is permitted. The calculated mortality risk of candidates undergoing the procedure should not exceed eight percent. Note that this requirement may be relaxed to a threshold of ten percent upon approval by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nPrior to the reawakening of candidates as SCP-6637 instances, an audience consisting of no fewer than 30 Foundation operatives is to gather within the performance space. Operatives are to wear contextually appropriate clothing, and are encouraged to partake in the moderate consumption of contextually appropriate alcoholic beverages.\n\n\nImmediately following the reawakening of candidates as SCP-6637 instances, a klaxon will sound. This will serve as the signal for the assigned agent of MTF Theta-88 \u201c\nSecure Containment Posse\n\u201c to enter the performance space. The agent should seek to convey an exaggerated sense of confidence as they enter the space, taking advantage of the awakening entity\u2019s disorientation to gain a slight advantage from the outset. Care should be taken to keep this advantage slight; establishing a strong sense of SCP-6637 as an underdog may harm the agent\u2019s position in the perceived narrative of the rap battle which follows.\n\n\nIt is imperative that the Foundation agent be perceived as the winner of this conflict.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6637 is an incorporeal, sapient entity which demonstrates an ability to physically possess humans for variable periods of time. Once in possession of a viable host, the entity will proceed toward the nearest public space and commence an oratory. The proliferation and duration of possession events appears to positively correlate with SCP-6637\u2019s esteem as perceived by those to whom it has most recently orated. The contents of its speeches have been shown to include sensitive information, including classified Foundation data, in addition to memetic infohazards and novel ideologies which are deemed incompatible with normalcy.\n\n\nWhilst the Foundation are not able to reliably predict which individuals will be affected by SCP-6637, through study of the kinetoglyphs used by the entity specialists have developed a method of reliably inducing possession events in viable candidates.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Jerome Benten vs SCP-6637 [Rematch]\n\n\n\n\nJerome Benten:\n\nMy squad\u2019s dreaded.\n\nMy groupies, GRU-Ps, leave gods deaded.\n\nAnd the Foundation\u2019ll cover it up like cosmetics.\n\n\nSCP-6637:\n\nThis is pataphysic analytics; you ain\u2019t got a cannon.\n\nI keep it real with the tec like Doctor Scranton.\n\n\n[The agent turns to face the crowd.]\n\n\nJB: I wish those archaeologists woulda left him resting.\n\nAt least his lines are so forgettable this is amnestic testing.\n\n\nSCP-6637: It\u2019s like the day they freed my spirit from Egyptian earth.\n\n\u2018Coz I know that you dig this, so be careful who you dissin\u2019, turd.\n\n\nJB: Disinterred? Oh, that was some cryptic wit.\n\nNow check out this simple shit:\n [The agent gestures with a vertical extension of his middle finger.] \nNo mystic glyph.\n\nI could neutralise 682 with a spinning fist.\n [The agent demonstrates a spinning backhand strike in the air, causing SCP-6637 to flinch slightly.]\n\n\nI could neutralise narrative anomalies with a scissor kick. Quick as this.\n [The agent demonstrates a rapid scissor kick move. SCP-6637 shrugs before turning to face the crowd.]\n\n\nSCP-6637: This lyricist couldn\u2019t even neutralise Mister Fish.\n\nIt\u2019s like I tagged in the Hanged King when I flip the script.\n\nAnd how\u2019s it even relevant what you could neutralise?\n\nAin\u2019t it your ethics committee, not you who decides?\n\n\nJB: Yeah, fair point. I\u2019ve considered the notion.\n\nKilling you? Well worth an instant demotion.\n\nI bet the bredrin you\u2019re possessing\u2019s a more fitting opponent.\n\nThat D-Class would breeze past this twisted and broken, typical, token, mythical spokesman ass anomaly. Easy.\n\n\nSCP-6637: Kid, wow, you should sit down, quick, now,\n\nYou need to have a little chat with yourself like Miss Chao.\n\nDo you believe in parallel universes? Let me see\u2026\n\nAnother thing: when I pun- shit\u2019s fin\u2019. Like SPC.\n\n\nJB: How you on some cosmic shit, yet still ain\u2019t made for stardom?\n\nI\u2019m a battle rap legend who was raised in Harlem.\n\nEldritch asylum-seeker; shoulda stayed in Arkham.\n\nHe\u2019s like \u2018f\u2019nagth fnnu fnuh\u2019\u2026 I\u2019m like\u2026 \u2018pardon?\u2019\n\n\nSCP-6637: Forget about your champion\u2019s cup, I\u2019mma win the grail.\n\nKid your skills are frail and my will prevails.\n\nThe second you stepped in this ring, instant fail.\n\nNow I got a little proposal of my own; I\u2019mma lift the veil.\n\n\nJB: Now, you\u2019re plainly a nerd with arrangement of words.\n\nFoundation. We\u2019re dealing with basic concerns.\n\nProposal? My terms of engagement are heard?\n\nWanna get our respect? This the stage where it\u2019s earned.\n\nAnomalous Eldritch oration\u2019s preferred?\n\nNot in rap battles. I take it you\u2019ve learned?\n\n\nSCP-6637: Yeah I\u2019ve trained and rehearsed.\n\nYou just wasted a verse. [The agent raises an eyebrow. SCP-6637 nods.]\n\nAnd you\u2019re some kind of scientist, right? Known for diligence?\n\nBut every time you say \u2018anomalous\u2019 it just shows your ignorance. [The agent turns to face SCP-6637.]\n\nHey, wait, I\u2019ll try this: he writes \u2018skips\u2019, dry scripts;\n\nLiterally\u2026 skippable would describe his.\n\n\nJB: That kinda wise quip isn\u2019t well advised.\n\n\u2018Skip\u2019 since you\u2019re gonna get jumped and then exorcised.\n\n\nSCP-6637: I\u2019mma bury you in a black box\u2026\n\nAnd that\u2019s fitting since before your raps drop you have to redact lots.\n\nYou\u2019re a total Nobody, but, hats off.\n\nYour click ain\u2019t do shit, like dado\u2019s caps-lock.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with this man\u2019s squad?

Get it the fuck out of here.\n\n\n[SCP-6637 returns the bottle to the audience member and frowns.]\n\n\nJB: I see past the D-Class host to your bleak heart\u2019s hopes through your weak half-boasts, and that\u2019s real.\n\nDeep bars both, but we mean ours most, you could possess our best but can\u2019t get how we feel.\n\nHeed the mockery. You\u2019re a freak anomaly in need of modesty, decent quality and speech economy.\n\nYou wanna orate to our nations and preach philosophies, heathen prophecies and secret properties of demonology?\n\n\u2026But instead you\u2019re stuck rap battling me? getting beaten commonly? In a league for comedy?\n\nThat must suck, right?\n\n\nSCP-6637: You missed-a whole lot of things. That\u2019s Wondertainment.\n\nToe tagged. Footnote: That\u2019s an understatement.\n\n\nJB: Ok, word up to your lyrical style but dribbling bile\u2019s a bad look.\n\nYour possession session ends when you you get a tad shook.\n\n\n[SCP-6637 wipes its chin with the sleeve of its hoodie.]\n\n\nJB: They tried telling me not to battle a god;\n\nNow I\u2019m wrapping this up like a rag-an\u2019-a-rock.\n\n\n[SCP-6637 inspects the stain on its sleeve and shudders visibly.]\n\n\nJB: Incorporeal, \u2018coz you\u2019re spirited but it\u2019s not hard.\n\nSCP-6637: Hey they call you the Jailers, but you ain\u2019t got bars?\n\n\nJB: You\u2019re on some Eldritch shit, but don\u2019t love crafting lines, right?\n\nSCP-6637: Rewind\u2026 Your crew uses SCP 2k more than hindsight.\n\n\n[SCP-6637 commences a manual kinetoglyphic sequence. The agent counters by inverting the polarity of his cap, turning its peak to the rear before yawning theatrically.]\n\n\nJB: How can you be incorporeal and still get bodied?\n\nSCP-6637: I\u2019m gon\u2019 containment breach a fresh posse in yo\u2019 west lobby.\n\n\nJB: No you\u2019re not. And I don\u2019t give a shit which elder god causes most anguish.\n\nHey I could even beat this thing in its own language. Check it out\u2026\n\n\n[The agent performs a guttural staccato couplet, tinting the air with taupe and rust-orange rhymes in perfect geometric tessellation, and causing many audience members to drop their drinks. The couplet translates as an assertion that the existence of the progenitor of SCP-6637 neatly conforms to human systems of logic, and moreover could be fully comprehended by the average infant, who would suffer no ill-effects as a result.]\n\n\nJB: And they\u2019d dream about, like, pretty ponies and strawberry jell\u2026 Oh.\n\n\n[SCP-6637 drops to the ground and begins to convulse, indicating the cessation of the current possession event, and resulting in the declaration of Sgt. Jerome Benten as the champion by default.]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-B:\n Jerome Benten vs SCP-6637 [Second Rematch]\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-6637:] Oh, you again?\n\nFor fuck\u2019s sake.\n\nAin\u2019t you got a mage to smite, or pataphysics play to write?\n\nSee these are ageless rhymes v. the ancient kind.\n\nMy temper\u2019ll shift; you\u2019re a waste of time.\n\nI don\u2019t think your state of mind\u2019s the same as mine.\n\nYour squad\u2019s not got a great design;\n\nIt\u2019s strange to find the \u2018theta\u2019 sign.\n\nI run through rounds with straighter lines.\n\nI\u2019d leave him leaning like that designation changed to \u2018phi\u2019.\n\n\n[JB:] I\u2019m goddamn glad I set a day aside for deicide.\n\nI\u2019ll beat you so bad not even your name survives.\n\nI ain\u2019t ever let the fates decide my way in life.\n\nI\u2019ll take a knife, aim and slice, and if that ain\u2019t suffice, this god\u2019s getting maimed tonight like I staged a fight re-enacting the ancient pagan rites that they replaced with Christ\u2019s.\n\n\n[SCP-6637:] You people treat D-class human beings like a cage of mice.\n\nYou\u2019re cold and you\u2019re cruel as a blade design that\u2019s made of ice,\n\nAnd trying to use that in a battle isn\u2019t great advice.\n\nI don\u2019t think your founding statement\u2019s right, stay precise:\n\nYou people live in the darkness where it\u2019s safe to hide, coz you\u2019re afraid of light,\n\nSo that others can live in the dark after you\u2019ve made them blind.\n\n\n[JB:] Now you\u2019re in the gravest plight and only acting like the bravest type coz you\u2019re afraid of fright.\n\n\n[SCP-6637:] That doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\n[The agent shrugs.]\n\n\n[SCP-6637:] Sorry. Nice rhyme scheme.\n\nBet your lyrics pad has more weird shit in it than Site-Nineteen.\n\nYou forgot you got schooled coz your memory slipped\n\nLike your ass passed a class back in seventy six.\n\nI prolly possessed the Professors. Word, bro.\n\nHow my rap\u2019s naturally captivating the first row. [SCP-6637 gestures towards the frontline audience members, all of whom appear indifferent.]\n\nReally? No-one?\n\n\u2018Professors\u2019? so \u2018first row\u2019? You know? \u2018Rho-1\u2019?\n\nAh forget it.\n\n\n[JB:] Yo, Rho-1..?\n\nI like how you refrained from making a boat pun.\n\nGood job there.\n\nBut me, I\u2019m an actual professor. You just act scholarly.\n\nI put beasts in their place. Wait\u2026 Attacks-honour-me.\n\nI\u2019m caging a lion, I\u2019m chaining a titan,\n\nForever taming the raging environs,\n\nI\u2019m clai\u2026\n [SCP-6637 interrupts.]\n\n\n[SCP-6637:] Forever taming the raging environs?\n\nHe\u2019s forever chasing a changing horizon.\n\nHe\u2019s caging a lion? Chaining a titan?\n\nHe can barely even \u2018contain\u2019 his excitement.\n\nI thought holding shit down was his basic assignment?\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to battle\u2026 he restrains his politeness.\n\nHis facade\u2019s just make-believe. Wait and see.\n\nHe\u2019s got a whole nother persona online like Stacey Lee.\n\n\n[An audience member offers SCP-6637 a bottle and is promptly declined.]\n\n\n[JB:] Nah I\u2019m not Stace Lee.\n\nThat ain\u2019t me.\n\nThe name\u2019s JB,\n\nAnd I\u2019m here to s\u2026\n [SCP-6637 interrupts.]\n\n\nSCP-6637: Pfft. You guys.\n\nJust wasting time, like you don\u2019t know your doom\u2019s nigh.\n\nI\u2019ll be surprised if he refrains from detailing the room size.\n\nProbably wanted this battle in a titanium cube, right?\n\nOf all the ridiculous SCP writers, he\u2019s the worst offender.\n\nI bet you he\u2019ll even quote this verse verbatim in the first addenda.\n\nAfter tryna make out like I\u2019ve got some perverse agenda.\n\nBruh, I\u2019m just trying to enlighten the people of Earth for better.\n\n\nJB: Nah if you\u2019re dropping jewels that\u2019s some accursed treasure.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t enlighten, you\u2019d entice \u2018em to serve forever.\n\n\nSCP-6637: Oh, like the churches of your world would never!\n\nSermons, clever, making the people averse to pleasure,\n\nWhilst providing the terms on which worth is measured.\n\nMy word\u2019s my bond yet serves to sever certain tethers.\n\nA resurgent serp\u2026 [JB interrupts.]\n\n\nJB: Whatever. I\u2019mma leave this anomalous consciousness unconscious.\n\nYou possess heads and chat shit? That\u2019s it? What a dumb monster.\n\n\nSCP-6637: I could take the truth and speak it, but who\u2019d believe it?\n\nWould there still be D-Class if I\u2019d\u2026 declassified how they\u2019re cruelly treated?\n\nThey say your crew\u2019s elitist; since they\u2019ve chosen you to lead this, it disproves the thesis.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda like Dr King got the win; you step to test and get superseded.\n\n\nJB: Our approval\u2019s needed? We reject devils.\n\nYour possession session ends when you get heckled,\n\nThen you come back equally weak in the next vessel.\n\nPlease, you still seem green as your threat level.\n\n\n[An audience member ignites a Philadelphia blunt cigar containing a genetically modified cannabis strain with Class-C amnestic certification, puffing rapidly and exhaling the fumes in the direction of SCP-6637.]\n\n\nSCP-6637: I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while, and I\u2019m a\u2026\n\nI\u2019m\u2026 uh\u2026\n\nI\u2019m hungry.\n\nHehe.\n\n\n[The smoking audience member drops the blunt and glances around, furrowing his brow before shrugging and leaving the performance space.

You wanna orate to our nations and preach philosophies, heathen prophecies and secret properties of demonology? \u2026But instead you\u2019re stuck rap battling me? getting beaten commonly? In a league for comedy? That must suck, right? SCP-6637: You missed-a whole lot of things. That\u2019s Wondertainment. Toe tagged. Footnote: That\u2019s an understatement. JB: Ok, word up to your lyrical style but dribbling bile\u2019s a bad look. Your possession session ends when you you get a tad shook. [SCP-6637 wipes its chin with the sleeve of its hoodie.] JB: They tried telling me not to battle a god; Now I\u2019m wrapping this up like a rag-an\u2019-a-rock. [SCP-6637 inspects the stain on its sleeve and shudders visibly.] JB: Incorporeal, \u2018coz you\u2019re spirited but it\u2019s not hard. SCP-6637: Hey they call you the Jailers, but you ain\u2019t got bars? JB: You\u2019re on some Eldritch shit, but don\u2019t love crafting lines, right? SCP-6637: Rewind\u2026 Your crew uses SCP 2k more than hindsight. [SCP-6637 commences a manual kinetoglyphic sequence. The agent counters by inverting the polarity of his cap, turning its peak to the rear before yawning theatrically.] JB: How can you be incorporeal and still get bodied? SCP-6637: I\u2019m gon\u2019 containment breach a fresh posse in yo\u2019 west lobby. JB: No you\u2019re not. And I don\u2019t give a shit which elder god causes most anguish. Hey I could even beat this thing in its own language. Check it out\u2026 [The agent performs a guttural staccato couplet, tinting the air with taupe and rust-orange rhymes in perfect geometric tessellation, and causing many audience members to drop their drinks. The couplet translates as an assertion that the existence of the progenitor of SCP-6637 neatly conforms to human systems of logic, and moreover could be fully comprehended by the average infant, who would suffer no ill-effects as a result.] JB: And they\u2019d dream about, like, pretty ponies and strawberry jell\u2026 Oh. [SCP-6637 drops to the ground and begins to convulse, indicating the cessation of the current possession event, and resulting in the declaration of Sgt. Jerome Benten as the champion by default.]",
        "[SCP-6637:] Oh, you again? For fuck\u2019s sake. Ain\u2019t you got a mage to smite, or pataphysics play to write? See these are ageless rhymes v. the ancient kind. My temper\u2019ll shift; you\u2019re a waste of time. I don\u2019t think your state of mind\u2019s the same as mine. Your squad\u2019s not got a great design; It\u2019s strange to find the \u2018theta\u2019 sign. I run through rounds with straighter lines. I\u2019d leave him leaning like that designation changed to \u2018phi\u2019. [JB:] I\u2019m goddamn glad I set a day aside for deicide. I\u2019ll beat you so bad not even your name survives. I ain\u2019t ever let the fates decide my way in life. I\u2019ll take a knife, aim and slice, and if that ain\u2019t suffice, this god\u2019s getting maimed tonight like I staged a fight re-enacting the ancient pagan rites that they replaced with Christ\u2019s. [SCP-6637:] You people treat D-class human beings like a cage of mice. You\u2019re cold and you\u2019re cruel as a blade design that\u2019s made of ice, And trying to use that in a battle isn\u2019t great advice. I don\u2019t think your founding statement\u2019s right, stay precise: You people live in the darkness where it\u2019s safe to hide, coz you\u2019re afraid of light, So that others can live in the dark after you\u2019ve made them blind. [JB:] Now you\u2019re in the gravest plight and only acting like the bravest type coz you\u2019re afraid of fright. [SCP-6637:] That doesn\u2019t make sense. [The agent shrugs.] [SCP-6637:] Sorry. Nice rhyme scheme. Bet your lyrics pad has more weird shit in it than Site-Nineteen. You forgot you got schooled coz your memory slipped Like your ass passed a class back in seventy six. I prolly possessed the Professors. Word, bro. How my rap\u2019s naturally captivating the first row. [SCP-6637 gestures towards the frontline audience members, all of whom appear indifferent.] Really? No-one? \u2018Professors\u2019? so \u2018first row\u2019? You know? \u2018Rho-1\u2019? Ah forget it. [JB:] Yo, Rho-1..? I like how you refrained from making a boat pun. Good job there. But me, I\u2019m an actual professor. You just act scholarly. I put beasts in their place. Wait\u2026 Attacks-honour-me. I\u2019m caging a lion, I\u2019m chaining a titan, Forever taming the raging environs, I\u2019m clai\u2026 [SCP-6637 interrupts.] [SCP-6637:] Forever taming the raging environs? He\u2019s forever chasing a changing horizon. He\u2019s caging a lion? Chaining a titan? He can barely even \u2018contain\u2019 his excitement. I thought holding shit down was his basic assignment? When it\u2019s time to battle\u2026 he restrains his politeness. His facade\u2019s just make-believe. Wait and see. He\u2019s got a whole nother persona online like Stacey Lee. [An audience member offers SCP-6637 a bottle and is promptly declined.] [JB:] Nah I\u2019m not Stace Lee. That ain\u2019t me. The name\u2019s JB, And I\u2019m here to s\u2026 [SCP-6637 interrupts.] SCP-6637: Pfft. You guys. Just wasting time, like you don\u2019t know your doom\u2019s nigh. I\u2019ll be surprised if he refrains from detailing the room size. Probably wanted this battle in a titanium cube, right? Of all the ridiculous SCP writers, he\u2019s the worst offender. I bet you he\u2019ll even quote this verse verbatim in the first addenda. After tryna make out like I\u2019ve got some perverse agenda. Bruh, I\u2019m just trying to enlighten the people of Earth for better. JB: Nah if you\u2019re dropping jewels that\u2019s some accursed treasure. You wouldn\u2019t enlighten, you\u2019d entice \u2018em to serve forever. SCP-6637: Oh, like the churches of your world would never! Sermons, clever, making the people averse to pleasure, Whilst providing the terms on which worth is measured. My word\u2019s my bond yet serves to sever certain tethers. A resurgent serp\u2026 [JB interrupts.] JB: Whatever. I\u2019mma leave this anomalous consciousness unconscious. You possess heads and chat shit? That\u2019s it? What a dumb monster. SCP-6637: I could take the truth and speak it, but who\u2019d believe it? Would there still be D-Class if I\u2019d\u2026 declassified how they\u2019re cruelly treated? They say your crew\u2019s elitist; since they\u2019ve chosen you to lead this, it disproves the thesis. It\u2019s kinda like Dr King got the win; you step to test and get superseded. JB: Our approval\u2019s needed? We reject devils. Your possession session ends when you get heckled, Then you come back equally weak in the next vessel. Please, you still seem green as your threat level. [An audience member ignites a Philadelphia blunt cigar containing a genetically modified cannabis strain with Class-C amnestic certification, puffing rapidly and exhaling the fumes in the direction of SCP-6637.] SCP-6637: I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while, and I\u2019m a\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 uh\u2026 I\u2019m hungry. Hehe. [The smoking audience member drops the blunt and glances around, furrowing his brow before shrugging and leaving the performance space. SCP-6637 takes a deep breath and regains its composure.] [SCP-6637:] I\u2019ve been guiding your kind since times immemorial. Now you won\u2019t even look at me when I\u2019m killin\u2019 you. Coz I\u2019m incorporeal. I\u2019ll possess the priest at your nan\u2019s funeral. I\u2019ll tur\u2026 [JB interrupts.] [JB:] You\u2019ll possess the priest at my nan\u2019s funeral? That\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s actually damn suitable. You ain\u2019t heard? She\u2019s asked for a\u2026 rap musical. [SCP-6637:] Please stop.
