Secondary containment procedures are considered adequate until a more feasible mechanism for SCP-3884's containment is determined.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Rho-66 \u201cRoad Hogs\u201d will maintain continual ground and aerial patrols of the American Southwest. When alerted by Foundation listening network PANOPTICON, MTF Rho-66 assets will engage SCP-3884. If SCP-3884 is stationed in a heavily-populated area, Foundation assets will establish an observation cordon around SCP-3884 and immediately confiscate any items distributed to the populace by SCP-3884-01 while deflecting local law enforcement involvement. MTF Rho-66 will then track SCP-3884 until it has cleared the population center, then engage. Resultant explosion will be publicly designated a vehicular accident.\n\n\nAll civilians and local law enforcement personnel exposed to SCP-3884 will be amnesticized.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances are Foundation personnel to attempt to acquire or redeem Civil Defense Points.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-3884 is a black Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau (IFA) W 50 cab-over truck that displays a number of anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-3884's performance capabilities exceed that of a standard cargo truck. It has shown the ability to attain speeds of over 270 kilometers per hour, and exhibits effects characteristic of a Class 2 reality distortion field, including spatiotemporal translocation and the spontaneous manifestation of matter, described in further detail below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical result of SCP-3884 detainment attempt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3884 will typically manifest within the outskirts of a population center, then drive to a local gathering point such as a strip mall, market, fairground, parking lot, or downtown area, whereupon SCP-3884-01 will exit the vehicle, lower its rear hatch, and attempt to distribute its wares. If approached by an element that intends to detain or obstruct SCP-3884-01's activities, SCP-3884 will explode, and SCP-3884-01 will vanish. SCP-3884 will then remanifest elsewhere in the southwestern United States after a variable amount of time.\n\n\nSCP-3884-01 visually resembles an emaciated, significantly decomposed humanoid figure, typically wearing a stahlhelm, leather trenchcoat, and combat boots. SCP-3884-01 will \nloudly advertise its products\n and attempt to give them to any passersby within arm's reach, or simply throw them on the ground in a pile near SCP-3884 in the frequent event that no civilians accept them. These items have thus far included fully-automatic machine guns, high-powered anti-materiel rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines, and, in one instance, a Nerf brand toy rifle, spray-painted black and given to a small child.\n\n\nEach individual instance of weaponry will have a flyer crudely affixed to it with duct tape. Text follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT'S TIME TO LOCK AND LOAD, CITIZENS!\n\n\n\n\nDO YOU WANT TO BE SAFE? DO YOU WANT TO SHOW THOSE BASTARDS HOW TOUGH YOU ARE? ARE YOU AS \nFUCKING TERRIFIED\n AS I AM?

Your time has come.\n\n\n\n\nAs SCP-3884's activities invariably attract local law enforcement attention, its attempts to supply weaponry to the populace are brief and swiftly interrupted. To date, civilians have reacted negatively to all SCP-3884 appearances and none have willingly accepted any items given by SCP-3884-01. As a result, none have participated in its rewards program, thus information regarding the aforementioned \u201cprizes\u201d is limited.\n\n\nEfforts to successfully detain SCP-3884 or SCP-3884-01 are currently underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCadaverCommander's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-3982\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3896\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4999\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3588\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4866\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4449\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5902\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3894\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3885\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3893\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4933\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1233\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3899\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3895\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3889\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Shape of a Gun\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Fucknuts Builds a Flying Machine\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Fucknuts Believes In Himself\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Makes a New Friend\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Fucknuts Takes to the Skies\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nCadaverCommander's Mobile Assault Necropolis\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3883\n | SCP-3884 | \nSCP-3885\n \u00bb",
