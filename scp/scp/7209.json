We\u2019re running low on food here.\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nApproximately 16 days of rations remaining, under the assumption all living Council Members gain an equal share of the available sustenance.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Well, you don\u2019t need anything, little Mac.\n\n\nO5-4:\n What?\n\n\nO5-6:\n Y\u2019all ain\u2019t never heard of \nPunch Out\n?

We\u2019re not killing anyone.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Damn.\n\n\nO5-1:\n We have plans in place for situations just like this.\n\n\nO5-4:\n We do?\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nYes. OPERATION ROYALE.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Exactly. 10, would you mind-\n\n\nO5-10:\n No.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nO5-10:\n I\u2019m saying no. We agreed to never try ROYALE again. I\u2019m not making the department compliant with this.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Can someone just tell us what the hell this \"royale\" is anyway?\n\n\nO5-1 distributes a paper document to each council member.

But that doesn\u2019t mean-\n\n\nO5-6:\n I\u2019m in.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Same.\n\n\nO5-10:\n You can\u2019t possibly be serious.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Seems like a good qualifier to me.\n\n\nO5-10:\n You \ncannot\n be serious.\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nThere are some ethical considerations to be had with this-\n\n\nO5-10:\n Exactly.\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nHowever, has any other council member brought forth any solution?\n\n\nO5-1:\n There\u2019s not.\n\n\nO5-7:\n It's not completely unusable. And with the resources we have now, rather than 30 years ago, this seems like a good choice.\n\n\nO5-10:\n Hold on, don\u2019t we already have a shortlist for candidates? Why would we need to do this?\n\n\nO5-4:\n The list is too long right now. I don\u2019t know, this seems a little\u2026 barbaric, but this does narrow it down.\n\n\nO5-11:\n List helps put this together too.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Let us put it to a vote. Formally, a democratic decision.\n\n\nO5-10:\n No.\n\n\nO5-1:\n All those in favor of a vote?\n\n\nO5-10:\n \nNo.\n\n\nAll council members except for O5-10 raise their available voting appendages.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Terrific.\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nNAY\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\nABSENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-01\n\n\nO5-03\n\n\nO5-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-04\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION ROYALE WILL BEGIN SHORTLY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nRe:SUBJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n (many)\n\n\nFrom:\n \nnimda.PiCS|tnemtrapedrh#nimda.PiCS|tnemtrapedrh\n\n\nSubject:\n Transfer of Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, Personnel!

You have been noted for high proficiency in your field and displayed loyalty towards the Foundation. You will be required to move on-site for the continuous containment efforts against SCP-7209. This email and all contents are highly classified - revealing any such information is punishable by termination.\n\n\nYou will soon receive a preliminary copy of the SCP-7209 file, available for your clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPF HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT\n\n\nSolving your Complaints and Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscp7209.file\n\n\n\n\nclose\u00a0file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nesoteric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nthaumiel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\ndark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nnotice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:\n SCP-7209 is contained within SCP-7209-1. SCP-7209-1 is contained through the standard Veil Maintenance Protocol applied to all Foundation Secure Facilities. More information regarding SCP-7209 will be available upon your transfer to Site-Gamma.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7209-1 is Site-Gamma, a Foundation facility located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Originally constructed for usage in [REDACTED], Site-Gamma become the containment location of SCP-7209 after the anomaly was discovered nearby.\n\n\nSCP-7209-1 is built in 3 distinct wings; RESIDENCE, RESEARCH, and CONTAINMENT. The RESIDENCE wing is non-anomalous and encompasses the perimeter of the facility.\n\n\nThe CONTAINMENT wing, composed of the central storage room for SCP-7209 and the surrounding observation booths, is located at the center of Site-Gamma. All structures in CONTAINMENT are made from an alloy of beryllium bronze and SCP-148, with the intent of counteracting any physical, mental, or thaumaturgical harm posed by the anomaly. 6 restabilized SRA Devices\n1\n are located in the perimeter of CONTAINMENT, and have been restabilized into conjoining objectively with the surrounding materials.\n\n\nMore information regarding SCP-7209 will be available upon your transfer to Site-Gamma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nPresent Staff:\n\n\n\n\nEthel Kursh, HR Liaison.\n\n\nDr. Anton Radu, Archaeology.\n\n\nAgent John Gardner, Level 4 MTF Captain.\n\n\nDr. Murph Teckler, General Research.\n\n\nSite-18 Director Iovianus Neer.\n\n\nDr. Ryoto Hishikaku, Analogue Intelligence.\n\n\nAgent B. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Espionage.\n\n\nPetra Baldwin, RAISA.\n\n\n\n\nFORWARD:\n Meeting held within the front lobby of Site-Gamma 15 minutes after the arrival of all summoned Level 4 Personnel.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nE.

I'll cut the formalities then. Hello, my name is Ethel Kursh, and I am the HR Liaison assigned to the 7 of you for the purposes of PROJECT ROYALE.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Yeah, about that, what? The document you sent us for SCP-7209 had, like, nothing of value.\n\n\nI. Neer:\n Not even a map of this facility. Just a piss-poor description.\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n Glad somebody brought that up.

NEER (22 Years)\n\n\nEMPLOYED AS:\n Level 4 Site Director\n\n\nCURRENT LOCATION:\n Site-18\n\n\nIf you asked for a definition of eloquence and leadership, most of the Foundation who knows him would probably point toward Iovanius Neer. He's not a Foundation baby by birth \u2014 Parents were eventual defectors from the Serpent's Hand. Iovanius, or Ivy as his coworkers have taken to calling him (as will this report, for the sake of being succinct), didn't get the thaumaturgy though. Nor did he get the wonders of the library. He got dirt and rations, but that makes it more impressive to watch him rise like he did.\n\n\nSite-18 has always been a tricky Site to manage. Shoved number-wise between the Foundation's greatest accomplishment and the ongoing biggest mistake, people often forget about 18, despite the facility being one of our largest. Directors in the past have done their best to try and fight the under-budgeting and take the reins of such a disorganized place. But Ivy was the first to do it right. He single-handedly took 18 from a cluttered mess to a place of utmost efficiency \u2014 and unlike some other facilities, the efficiency didn't come at the cost of humanity.\n\n\nA strong leader, an intelligent mind, a caring coworker, and someone loyal to the Foundation for the reciprocal benefits given between him and us. Iovanius Neer is probably the most qualified for PROJECT ROYALE \u2014 although the sort of archetype given by him is filled, and he's perceived as a valuable asset in his position.

You hand over everything you can about the Foundation, and you'll be freed from this cage. Given safe passage, courtesy of the Insurgency.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n But that's- The Foundation could find you anywhere, why would we ever take that?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n The Foundation, the sickly creature it is, is no god. It cannot see all. There are places and protective measures at our disposal to keep a \"defector\", as it's so offensively called, safe.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n An efficient quid pro quo.\n\n\nThe personnel are all silent. Baldwin lowers her weapon.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Fuck you.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Over my dead body.\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n I accept.\n\n\nEveryone looks at Hishikaku. He grins.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Traitor.\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n It was your little group of heroes that wanted a different way out, right?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n You're going to betray the Foundation, all for this. You're not even going to try?\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n What use is \"trying\" when the path out is right ahead?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n That's what I thought. Engineer, I accept your offer. Anything I know, it's yours.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n I knew you'd be interested in seeing reason.\n\n\nA single Insurgency Agent enters the room and places their hand on Hishikaku's shoulder.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n This one will take you out. See you in the plenty and free world, Hishikaku. Rid of the Foundation.\n\n\nR. Hishikaku:\n Works for me.\n\n\nIntercom system turns off. The camera system experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, Hishikaku and the Insurgent are gone. The other personnel step back cautiously and look around.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Where the hell did he go?\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n Doesn't matter, the prick is gone now.\n\n\nIntercom system turns back on. The sounds of a struggle can be heard. Someone taps on the microphone.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Lovely, back to you all.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n What- what's that in the background?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Nothing at all. Please return to the-\n\n\nA slamming noise.\n\n\nHishikaku (over the intercom):\n No, no no no, you- you're- you're nothing more than a goddamn ARTIF-\n\n\nGunshot. The intercom system turns off. The rest of the personnel stand in silence and surprise. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 looks at the group before lowering his rifle.\n\n\nB. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Well.\n\n\nGardner points his weapon at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's head.\n\n\nB. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hey, hey now, I lowered mine, you lower yours.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Not so fast, gnat. You were gonna work with the traitor.\n\n\nB. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And the traitor betrayed us, so we're all good now.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n That's not how it works.\n\n\nB. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh please, honey, that's exactly how it works. Trust me, you bulkheads and blockheads couldn't get out of here with the key in hand. I'm a spy \u2014 you need me.\n\n\nWhile he is talking, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is slowly reaching into his left pocket. Only Radu notices.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n And why is that?\n\n\nB. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Simple. Escape plans.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 pulls out a small metal bauble from his pocket. Radu grabs Gardner and Baldwin and pushes them to the side in time, as the bauble is thrown towards their side of the room and shatters against the wall. Smog begins flowing out of the cracked pieces.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n More of this stuff?\n\n\nThe smog fills the room, obscuring the video feed.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Not if I can help it.\n\n\nThe sounds of the north doors opening can be heard, as well as the footsteps of Gardner. Eventually, the smog fades away. The room is empty.\n\n\n[END]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nryoto.hr.file\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):\n RYOTO HISHIKAKU (30 Years)\n\n\nEMPLOYED AS:\n Level 4 Director of Analogue Intelligence\n\n\nCURRENT LOCATION:\n Site-17\n\n\nCold. Calculating. Smarter than we'd like to give credit for, given the first 2. That's the apt description of the AIC that we employ at the Foundation. The interesting ones, the quirky ones, are a rarity. Kind of the opposite of our employees. Most are quirky \u2014 Hishikaku is like the digital entities he designs.\n\n\nCurrently, he's the head of Analogue Intelligence. It's a strange and distinct difference between his old job as co-Director of the Artificial Intelligence Department, a job he lost due to quite several ethics violations against him. There's the issue with people like Hishikaku; he's incredibly qualified at his job. He's responsible for the current understanding we have of digital (or analog, whatever that entails) intelligence, and he'd be an insanely respected figure in the Foundation if he just wasn't so cruel to his coworkers. Days off are lacking, and emotions rarely show beyond the negatives.\n\n\nWhen we write about ethics issues, we're talking about really big ethics issues. Hishikaku's been suspected of betraying the Foundation for our less-moral enemies in at least 2 different instances. He's been cleared each time, but there's still the lingering wonder if he's still loyal to what's better: The Foundation.\n\n\nPROJECT ROYALE will be an excellent test of this character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\nThe west rooms of the RESIDENTIAL wing are seen.

All we know about \"Barry\" (as he calls himself) is that he was part of an old Foundation espionage initiative to reduce the risk when it came to our spies getting captured. Everything about \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was erased from his mind, and likely anyone that knew him before that. He agreed to it \u2014 allegedly \u2014 but it still does place him at odds with the more modern \"just be better at getting out of it\" mentality. More humane. Kind of.\n\n\nHe's certainly an interesting character. The lack of identity led to him forming his own, and the result is very\u2026 pataphysics calls him \"narratively convenient\". A faux-charmer with a loud mouth that can slither out of situations like the sleaze-ball they are. That kind of spy. At the very least, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is great at his job. Supposedly. It's always difficult to document these constant moving forces within the Foundation \u2014 how do you \"Human Resources\" someone who lost most of what made them human?\n\n\nHe's a very unique case for PROJECT ROYALE. He's not exactly in the same vein of intelligence as some other candidates, but he makes up for it in the specialization. Plus, the Foundation is looking to reduce active war efforts and go back to subtle movements. Nothing more subtle than a spy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n (NORTH HALL, RESEARCH WING)\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\nJohn Gardner and Murph Teckler are standing in the hall. Teckler looks worried, and Gardner is holding his weapon ready. This continues for 5 minutes before footsteps can be heard from down the hall. Both men look over to see Anton Radu running towards them, arms flailing to the sides as he struggles to keep his balance. Gardner lowers his weapon.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Just him. Great.\n\n\nRadu reaches the two men and leans on the wall, exhausted. He is shaking.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n So. What the fuck?\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n You know anything about what that last message was?\n\n\nRadu raises his hand and finishes catching his breath.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n He, uh. He's gone. The Engineer wasn't kidding about the whole storm thing, he\u2026 his body was\u2026\n\n\nRadu begins clenching his stomach and leans against the wall. Concerned, Gardner places his hand on Radu's shoulder.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Take it easy, soldier. Don't need to know the details.\n\n\nRadu vomits on the floor. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, there is no vomit on the floor. Teckler shakes his head.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Terrific. Directors gone, the robot king sacrificed himself to\u2026 something. Now the guy who specialized in escape plans is dead.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Real effective escape plan, I guess.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Got him out of here.\n\n\nRadu stands up and dusts off his pants. He gives Gardner a nod of appreciation before looking around the hall.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Where's Petra?\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Off looking, just like you were. Though after that message, she's probably on her way back now.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Hope not.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n What?\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n I don't like her vibe. The moment BLACKBOX went missing, she's been consistently more jittery and paranoid. It's freaking me the hell out.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Can you blame her?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Uh, yeah? The rest of us can hide our fear, or better yet, just deal with it. I hope you know I'm ready to take drastic measures if she changes course on us.\n\n\nGardner steps towards Teckler, whose eyes widen with fear. Gardner broadens his shoulders as his shadow falls over Teckler.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Same goes for you, dillweed. She's probably got a family to worry about, something I imagine you don't have. All in this together, remember?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Fucking- fine. Sorry.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Hey, guys, let's stay focused. All in this together, right? No need for unnecessary threats.\n\n\nGardner backs off. Teckler sighs in relief.\n\n\nA.

Baldwin:\n No, unfortunately, but something even better.\n\n\nBaldwin points at the central room on the map, labeled \"SCP-7209 HOLDING\".\n\n\nP.

Gardner:\n You see what our ticket out of here is?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Look.\n\n\nThe dust from the chamber settles. There is a metal podium in the center of the chamber, with a fluorescent ring light in the ceiling. Atop the podium is a 20 x 20 x 20\u00a0cm crystal, bearing resemblance to quartz. The personnel are silent.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Well. Interesting. A rock.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n A\u2026 rock.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n You're fucking kidding.\n\n\nBaldwin walks over to the supposed SCP-7209. Her hands are shaking and she has a look of desperation on her face.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n Well, I'm sure this is- This is fine, it was important enough to be kept here. They built a whole facility just for one anomaly.\n\n\nBaldwin starts frantically examining the object, careful to not make contact. Gardner places his head in his hands and sighs. Teckler sits on the ground and leans against the steel walls of the antechamber.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n It has to do something. Anton, Anton, you read the file, what's the deal with this thing?\n\n\nRadu is silent. He looks down at the floor.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n Anton, I- we need this thing to get out of here.

What does it \ndo\n?\n\n\nBaldwin keeps stepping forward. Gardner takes a step back while Teckler shuffles closer to the antechamber doorway.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n I told you, it doesn't do anything. The document- it was just a placeholder or something. I think SCP-7209 was too? The document wasn't even finished when I got to it, there's no proper description at all beyond-\n\n\nRadu points at the supposed SCP-7209.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Beyond that. It doesn't even have anomalous properties, I don't think. Keter class but\u2026 it said something about \"the show\"? We're in a game, right? Did the Insurgency plant this?\n\n\nBaldwin takes another step. She is no longer standing in the antechamber, and she slowly starts reaching toward her pocket. Gardner increases the grip on the firearm he's holding.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n I don't care about whatever your theory is, Anton, I just- I just need this to do anything. You're a goddamn archaeologist, can't you- I don't know, do something?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n That's not what archaeology is, I don't deal with just crystals or whatever. It's just a rock, Petra, I'm sorry.\n\n\nThe room goes silent. Baldwin starts to hyperventilate and reaches deeper into her pocket. Gardner takes another step back. Teckler is now seated in the doorway to the antechamber. Radu places his hand in his lab coat pocket. Baldwin begins to sob.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n God fucking damn it, man.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n I'm sorry Petra, but there's another way out of-\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n Another way out? What, is Big and Buff going to run into the walls until they fall over? Teckler slithering out like the worm he is? This was our last fucking shot, Anton, and it's- it's over.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Soldier, it ain't over 'till it's over. Now, I suggest you don't do what I think you're about to, because-\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n My kids, Anton. I'll never get to see them again. My wife, my coworkers, my friends, everyone I've ever loved. Gone.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Don't think like that, Petra, it's not-\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n You have family, archaeologist?\n\n\nRadu steps back. His hand grasps something inside his lab coat pocket.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n No.\n\n\nP. Baldwin:\n Then you don't understand what it's like. None of you do.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n What?\n\n\nSuddenly, Baldwin screams and pulls the revolver out of her pocket, running towards Radu and pointing at his head. Gardner attempts to shoot at her, but his firearm jams. As Baldwin runs forward, Radu pulls out his revolver. His hands are shaking. He looks at Baldwin and Gardner. Gardner is trying to unjam the firearm, and Teckler has already run away from the antechamber. With a tear welling in his eye, Radu pulls out the revolver Baldwin gave him initially and fires two shots. One makes contact with Baldwin's chest, terminating her instantly. The other makes contact with the supposed SCP-7209. The crystal shatters. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, only half the crystal shards are remaining on the ground. Baldwin's body is gone. Gardener and Radu breathe heavily from exhaustion, before sitting on the ground and dropping their weapons. They look at each other. Tears begin to well in Radu's eyes. Teckler walks back into the room slowly and sits next to Radu. He winces upon noticing the gun next to Radu. Radu leans his head back and begins to cry.\n\n\n[END]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npetra.hr.file\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):\n PETRA M. BALDWIN (11 Years)\n\n\nEMPLOYED AS:\n Level 4 RAISA Deputy Chief\n\n\nCURRENT LOCATION:\n Site-07\n\n\nRAISA is a very different environment from the rest of the Foundation. Kind of similar to us in Human Resources, you're not dealing with active anomalies or research \u2014 unless it's an infoallergenic anomaly, in which case, that's a full day of chaos. RAISA is about composure, about writing and containing your thoughts as you go to archive hundreds of years of paperwork. It's also an old department. Rumors say they were the third to come, after the Overseers and Ethics Committee. Of course, that's just speculation from the mythologists among us. The point is, the people are old. So a Level 4 Deputy Chief is unexpected.\n\n\nPetra is a go-getter. She's responsible. She cares about her coworkers, and even more about the people she handles the archival of. She cares a lot about her family \u2014 2 children \u2014 and hates spending time away from them. But she has a dedication to the Foundation, just like her mother beforehand. 33 years old, and 11 years as one of RAISA's best, has made her the leader of the modern department. Second only to Maria Jones, of course.\n\n\nNobody likes moving her so far away from her family so an extended period, but we know she'll do it. The stress of the distance might even help. She's the RAISA candidate for PROJECT ROYALE. After all, not like we can throw Maria Jones away like that, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\nTeckler, Radu, and Gardner enter the east-wing weapon storage room. The furniture, including the individual lockers, has been thrown around the room. There are ammunition and firearms on the ground. The three look around before beginning to collect items.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Grab everything you can. We wanna blast out of this place, we'll need all the firepower we can get.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n What about this?\n\n\nTeckler attempts to lift a heavy-duty barricade shield and drops it. Gardner walks over and picks it up with ease, throwing it over his back.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Works for me.\n\n\nRadu looks around the room. He places his hands in his lab coat pockets and sits down. Teckler and Gardner notice.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Hey, soldier, you good?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n What's got you all fucked up in the head?\n\n\nGardner slaps the back of Teckler's head.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n It's just\u2026 I can't stop thinking about Petra.\n\n\nGardner sighs.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Kid, I know what it's like. First kill, right?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Uh. Yeah.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Could tell from the look in your eyes. Feels like a mix of emotions. But you did the right thing.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n She was going to get us all killed, you included.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Exactly. Plus, live easy with the thought that you don't have to kill many more people in the field of archaeology, once we're out of here.\n\n\nRadu chuckles.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Guess that's true.\n\n\nGardner stands up.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n So, let's keep going. Can't let our emotions distract us, not right now. Save tears for once you're off the battlefield, or you'll get hurt.\n\n\nRadu sighs and stands up.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Yeah. Okay. Thanks.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Let's kill this fucking engineer.\n\n\nIntercom system turns on. All three brace themselves with the weapons in their hands.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n So. Do you want to object? Do you think there's another way out of this place?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n My god, do you ever shut up?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Perhaps another incentive to close inwards is required.\n\n\n3 Insurgency agents run through the doorway in front of Radu, Teckler, and Gardner. All are armed and wear tactical gear, including full-face masks bearing the Chaos Insurgency Insignia.\n\n\nInsurgent 1:\n Alright, Feds, hands behind your head!\n\n\nInsurgent 2:\n Yeah, hands, now!\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Okay, okay, okay, fine, Jesus Christ.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n No.\n\n\nInsurgent 3:\n What the \nfuck\n was that, stocky?\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n I told you, no.\n\n\nInsurgent 1:\n Not an option, you stupid-\n\n\nGardner pulls his handgun out of the holster and fires at the head of Insurgent 1, their body falling dead to the ground with a splatter of blood on the wall behind them. He then leaps toward Insurgent 3 and tackles them to the ground. While Insurgent 2 turns to react, Radu pulls out the pistol and points it toward them. Teckler runs towards the door.\n\n\nInsurgent 3:\n Get the hell off me, you beast!\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Fuck you. Radu, please, if you wouldn't mind.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Uh, yeah, right, okay. Don't shoot him, asshole.\n\n\nInsurgent 2:\n Oh, the archaeologist has a gun? Real scary there, kiddo.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nGardner begins slamming Insurgent 3's neck against the ground and punching their face mask. Insurgent 3 lands a hit on Gardner's nose. A cracking sound is heard Gardner screams. He raises his fists in the air again.\n\n\nJ. Gardner (between punches):\n Let. Us. Out. Of. Here.\n\n\nInsurgent 2 raises their gun towards Radu. Radu shakes.\n\n\nInsurgent 2:\n Well, there goes that confidence then. This'll be fu-\n\n\nA rock resembling a fragment of SCP-7209 flies through the doorway and hits Insurgent 2 in the front of their helmet mask. They fall backward while trying to recover themselves and slam the back of their head on a clothes bar in the closet behind them. The sound of a skull cracking can be heard before they fall, blood smearing on the wall behind them. Teckler runs into the room holding the pieces of SCP-7209.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Shit, did that work?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n That- how did he manage to\u2026\n\n\nA. Radu looks at the security camera in the room. Visual glitch.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Welcome back, sissy.\n\n\nInsurgent 3:\n Goddamn it, I'm gonna fucking kill you, fuckin' Foundation piece of-\n\n\nGardner grabs his revolver and slams the back end into the Insurgent's helmet mask. They slump to the ground and stop moving. Gardner leans back and lets out a tired exhale. Blood drips from the back of the revolver.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Wow.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Well? Who else, you freaky fucking shadow voice? Who else needs to get their ass kicked? Or are we done here?\n\n\nInsurgent 3 coughs and starts shallow breathing again. Gardner turns his attention back to them.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n And you. I don't know who you are, but I'll find out, and I'll have the entirety of the Foundation's armed forces focused on everyone you hold dear.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Okay, John, that's probably enough.\n\n\nGardner ignores Radu.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n You, and your insurgency, and everyone else who's out to ruin our lives. It's over, you fucking-\n\n\nGardner takes off the Insurgent's helmet and gasps. The face underneath the helmet is recognized as Chase McDougall, Gardner's second in command within their MTF. Gardner drops the helmet on the ground and leans down putting his hands on the side of McDougall's head. Tears start forming in Gardner's eyes.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Chase?\n\n\nMcDougall coughs up blood and grins weakly.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n No. No no no. You ain't- you're loyal, you would never\u2026\n\n\nC. McDougall:\n I'm\u2026 I'm sorry chief\u2026 you put up a good fight, eh?\n\n\nGardner begins speaking through sobs.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Goddamn it Chase, we were Foundation fucking family! Your father, mine, we\u2026 why would you-\n\n\nMcDougall coughs up more blood. Some lands on Gardner's face. Teckler and Radu stand behind Gardner, looking at the blood on the floor around them.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Soldier, no, you can't do this, you can't- I'm so sorry, Stormchaser, I'm so fucking sorry-\n\n\nMcDougall slowly raises his hand and places it on Gardner's shoulder. Teckler flinches.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Why\u2026 why the hell would you ever\u2026\n\n\nGardner's tears start falling into the blood on McDougall's body. Tears form in McDougall's eyes.\n\n\nC. McDougall:\n They\u2026 they had my wife, Chief\u2026 daughter too. I couldn't- I couldn't let them\u2026\n\n\nMcDougall's eyes begin to flutter shut. Gardner starts to hyperventilate.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n Don't you start dying on me, soldier- you can't start dying on me now. You can't go, we- I need you, Stormchaser, I need you to stay with me!\n\n\nC. McDougall:\n I'm so sorry, John.\n\n\nMcDougall falls limp. Gardner, Teckler, and Radu remain silent. Tears flow down Gardner's face. Teckler and Radu look at each other.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n No\u2026 that's\u2026\n\n\nSuddenly, Gardner's eyes widen. Marching can be heard approaching the storage room. Teckler and Radu run to the sides of the doorway. Gardner raises his head.\n\n\nJ. Gardner:\n You didn't have a wife. It was a cover we told them so we could-\n\n\n7 Insurgents enter the room behind Gardner. All raise their weapons and shoot directly at Gardner's head. Teckler and Radu cover their mouths while hiding behind the thrown-around furniture. The Insurgents stop firing and leave the room, single-file. Gardner's body drops dead on the floor. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, McDougall's body is gone. Radu looks around the room in confusion before the intercom system turns on again.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n And thus, there were two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ngardner.hr.file\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):\n JOHN. O. GARDNER (41 YEARS)\n\n\nEMPLOYED AS:\n Level 4 MTF Captain, MTF Charlie-99 (\"Ballistic Boomers\")\n\n\nCURRENT LOCATION:\n Varies.\n\n\nJohn Gardner is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Gardners are Foundation legacy. His family, 6 generations back, have worked here, almost all as MTF Agents. There\u2019s good reason for it too \u2014 natural talent is what some people call it. Strong, quick thinkers who can tactically deal with almost any situation thrown at them. John is the most recent and debatably best example of this. Been leading Charlie-99 since his father died, and the \u201cBallistic Boomers\u201d are no joke. A powerhouse strike team called in for heavy-duty, sometimes military, anomalous combat requires a leader fit high-stress scenarios. John Gardner fits like a leather-back glove.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the stress of being this kind of necessary leader can get to him. He\u2019s become more gruff, more aggressive over the past couple of years. It\u2019s a pattern of behavior that\u2019s unsurprising after the ways his father acted, but it\u2019s led to 3 HR Reports against him for aggravated behavior. His team respects him \u2014 he\u2019s a 6\u20194 powerhouse of a man \u2014 but can he call them friends? His closest companion is his second-in-command Chase McDougall. They\u2019ve been best friends since childhood. At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told.\n\n\nAll and all, John Gardner is the best choice for an agent in PROJECT ROYALE. His skills supersede the emotions \u2014 at least, theoretically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n (SOUTH CONTAINMENT WING HALLWAY)\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\nAnton Radu and Murph Teckler sit next to each other, leaning against the wall. Both have small splatters of blood on their clothes. Teckler releases a heavy exhale, and Radu wipes tears from his eyes. Teckler coughs.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n So.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n So?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Just us.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Yeah. Yeah, it is.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Just like you told Hishikaku, right?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Huh. Yeah, right.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n So. Are you ready to duel?\n\n\nRadu looks at Teckler with confusion and stands up. He reaches into his lab coat pocket.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Duel. You know. Fight, between two people. That's how most battle royales end anyway.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n I'm not- what happened to getting out of here together?\n\n\nTeckler stands up and laughs.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Please, that was John's whole campaign. Now that the beefcake is gone, what hope do we have of breaking out?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n That's not\u2026 we can still do this, Murph. We can't just give up now.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Goddamn it, we \ncan\n, Anton. I don't know why you can't seem to realize it, but we \ncan\n. Quite frankly, I think you want to live just as much as I do.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Of course I want to, but I also don't want any more blood to be spilled- we had to watch so many people get shot, beaten, crumpled, I\u2026 we can't do that. We can't let ourselves fall into that.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Stupid.\n\n\nTeckler reaches into his labcoat pocket; it is clearly bloated from carrying shards of SCP-7209.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n If you were against us the whole time, why didn't you just say that? Tell us the truth and leave us be?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n How far would telling the truth have gotten me? John or you or that psycho Petra would've killed me immediately if you knew I just wanted out, or that I worked at Site-37 for reasons, or that I knew what the stupid crystal was gonna be. I mean, sustainability, Anton, don't you get that?\n\n\nRadu is silent. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket and points it at Teckler. Teckler raises his hands.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Woah nelly. Thought we weren't dueling.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Did you say you knew what SCP-7209 was going to be?\n\n\nTeckler takes a step back.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Uh, yeah. It was one of the papers in my spawn room- why is that what you care about?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n If we had known about that, then- Petra might've lived you sick fuck!\n\n\nTeckler takes another 2 steps back. His hands are shaking.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Okay, Anton, let's calm down and consider for a second- LOOK AN INSURGENT!\n\n\nRadu looks behind him. Teckler turns around and starts running down the hall. Radu turns back and begins to chase after Teckler, firing an initial shot that barely misses and slams into the steel wall at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n (CONTAINMENT HALL OUTSIDE ANTECHAMBER)\n\n\n\n\nTeckler runs around the corner of the hall, narrowly avoiding the gunshot. As he runs down the hall towards the entrance to the antechamber, Radu turns around the corner after him.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Goddamn it, Teckler, you fucking traitor!\n\n\nTeckler ignores him and keeps running. Upon reaching the entrance to the antechamber, he turns with a swivel and slips on the ground, landing on his stomach. As Radu continues to run towards him, Teckler flips himself on his back and prepares to get up before another gunshot is fired.

Anton Radu walks forward at him, his revolver pointed at Teckler's head. Neither notice the multiple Insurgency agents standing around the perimeter of the room. Teckler eventually backs up against the outer wall of the chamber. He looks back, gasps, and looks back at Radu. Radu has an expression of anger.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n C'mon, man, you don't have to do this.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n I don't? I thought killing people was the only way out of this, Murph.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n That's- I wasn't serious, you know that, I still want to get out of here, just the two of us.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Why didn't you tell us about SCP-7209 then? Why didn't you tell us what you knew? Petra, she-\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n She was fucking unstable, Anton. No matter what went down, whether or not we found the crystal and tore down that door, she would've cracked eventually. Don't be so stupid.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Why didn't you tell me then at least? Tell someone? Try to encourage us to, I don't know, go somewhere else. If she was going to burst, why did you lead us to a point where people died?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n I didn't- You're being irrational, Radu, c'mon. Give me a chance, I'm not going to-\n\n\nIntercom turns on. Two taps on the mic.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Well.

Radu and Teckler finally notice them and jump in shock. Teckler tries to move away slowly while Radu watches them, but Radu keeps the revolver tracking on his head. Teckler freezes.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n When did they\u2026?\n\n\nVideo feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, the central SCP-7209 containment chamber is gone. Teckler falls back and his head lands with a hard slam against the ground. Radu jumps slightly before regaining composure and repointing the gun at Teckler. There is now another layer of Insurgents around the room.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n What is going \non\n?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Where- how- what?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Just fixing things for the show, of course.\n\n\nRadu stops and sharply exhales. He lowers the firearm and looks at the intercom speaker.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n What did you just say?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Just fixing things for the show of course.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n The.. the show?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Anton?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Where have I heard that before?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n I don't know what you mean. Now look, Anton, the worm Teckler is right before you.\n\n\nTeckler begins hyperventilating and backs himself up to the feet of the Insurgents behind him, jumping upon looking back and seeing their masked face staring back.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n That\u2026 that line. And the bodies. And the paper, and all the weird systems.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Anton? Hello? You're- you're thinking of a way to help us, right?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Why isn't Ethel here? Why wasn't the file complete?\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Earth to Anton, please, wake the fuck up!\n\n\nA. Radu:\n And that thing, that thing Hishikaku said before he died.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Anton, your freedom, sits right there before you. A way out, and a way to rid your glorious Foundation of the rats and worms like Murph Teckler. Don't you seek victory? Do you not want to find yourself the last man standing?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n This is the end, Anton. The gun, the one in your hand, is completely loaded. The right amount of shots to end everything. It's you or Teckler. His life, his squirming, pathetic life, it's not worth your own. You know that. He's done nothing but ruin it all, Anton.\n\n\nRadu looks around the room. His eyes widen slightly as he realizes something.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Oh.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n Oh?\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Or, you come with us. Join the Insurgency. Tell us everything you know - or rather, let us pull it from your brain. Help us rebuild the world, a better one free of the Foundation. A world where we could be kings, Anton.\n\n\nThe Engineer:\n Two options, archaeologist. Which one will it be?\n\n\nRadu closes his eyes and deeply inhales. His index finger slowly approached the trigger.\n\n\nM. Teckler:\n No. No no no, Radu, listen to me, it doesn't-\n\n\nRadu raises the gun to face Teckler's head.\n\n\nM.

He is sitting between O5-11 and an empty chair labeled \"13\". All of the O5 Council are staring directly at him.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Hello, Anton Radu.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n \u2026what?\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nHEART RATE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE AVERAGE. ARE YOU AFRAID, DR. RADU?\n\n\nO5-6:\n The hell he gotta be afraid of? Ain't ever seen an O5 before?\n\n\nO5-8:\n Most people haven't, actually. Funny statistic.\n\n\nO5-7:\n How do you gauge that, anyhow?\n\n\nO5-8:\n Annual census.\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nCORRECT. THE STATISTIC IS APPROXIMATELY 0.08% OF ALL FOUNDATION PERSONNEL HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN-\n\n\nO5-1 places his hand on the glass dome containing O5-3.\n\n\nO5-1:\n That's quite enough of that, everyone. Dr. Anton Radu, you have been selected as the one true victor within PROJECT ROYALE. As such, you have been immediately promoted to the position of O5-12.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Surprise!\n\n\nO5-6:\n Y'ain't much of a fighter, but damn right you proved yourself.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Oh, what's the codename gonna be?\n\n\nO5-4:\n \"The Archeologist\" makes sense, doesn't it?\n\n\nO5-8:\n Kind of drab. What about \"The Normal\"? Since he's, you know\u2026\n\n\nO5-8 raises their cybernetic arm extensions.\n\n\nO5-8:\n Not like this.\n\n\nO5-13 manifests in the \"13\" seat.\n\n\nO5-13:\n Already done before, by my previous.\n\n\nO5-5:\n If copying isn't allowed, how come 6 gets to be \"The American\"?\n\n\nO5-6:\n You questionin' my nation, \nFive-head\n?\n\n\nO5-5:\n That's barely even an insult, cowboy.\n\n\nO5-1:\n All of you, I would like to give Anton here a more positive outlook on the Council before he starts. Please. So stop talking.\n\n\nO5-4:\n Sorry, boss.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Right. Anyway. Dr. Anton Radu, do you, with all the power of the Foundation, and swearing the oath of Security, Containment, and Protection, accept this promotion?\n\n\nO5-5:\n Why do you even ask 'em that, he's obviously going to say-\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Uh. No?\n\n\nO5-5:\n -yes. Sorry, what?\n\n\nO5-7:\n Kid, that's\u2026. No isn't an option.\n\n\nO5-8:\n First time for everything.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Dr. Radu, you mean to tell me you decline the promotion to a member of the O5 Council?\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry, I know this is a big deal and everything, but I don't see myself as that kind of\u2026 I don't know. I'm not suited towards this? I'm an Archaeologist, I'm not a bureaucrat. Or anomalous, which seems to be\u2026 a common theme.\n\n\nO5-5:\n 6 isn't anomalous. He's just stupid.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Stupidly PATRIOTIC.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n But yeah. I don't even know what I did to earn this anyway, all I did was\u2026 well, I offed myself in a simulation. That \nwas\n a simulation, right?\n\n\nO5-8:\n Correct! State of the art.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n State-of-the-art simulation, used for\u2026 a battle royale.\n\n\nO5-4:\n I wouldn't think of it like that.\n\n\nO5-7:\n It kind of was.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Yes, Dr. Radu, the method we used to promote you was controversial, but-\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Controversial? You made us\u2026 you told us to kill each other! I had to watch good people, good coworkers, get slaughtered!\n\n\nO5-13:\n Death comes for us all, Radu.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Not like any of it was real, right?\n\n\nO5-3:\n \nSIMULATION: noun, imitation of a situation or process.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n It doesn't matter that it wasn't real, none of them knew that. Maybe John and Teckler, but everyone else\u2026 I mean, Petra, what happened to her\u2026 they're going to carry those memories forever now.\n\n\nThe room goes silent. O5-10 raises their hand.\n\n\nO5-10:\n They won't.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n What?\n\n\nO5-10:\n It's all gone.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n You\u2026 how is that ethical?\n\n\nO5-6:\n Who the hell said anything about ethics?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Listen, Anton, I think both you and I can agree that it would be hell for the rest of their lives if they could remember PROJECT ROYALE. What we did makes natural sense.\n\n\nO5-4:\n Foundation policy, if you will.\n\n\nO5-1: Now, let me make it clear to you: you \nare\n going to become O5-12. It's not an offer, it's an order. You displayed all the traits that satisfy a council member during PROJECT ROYALE.\n\n\nO5-4:\n You kept your cool when it was a necessity.\n\n\nO5-6:\n And ya shot who needed to be shot when they needed to be shot.\n\n\nO5-8:\n Thought through the simulation - need more minds like that.\n\n\nO5-1:\n And most importantly, loyalty. No handing over classified documents for freebies, no killing the meek and undeserving when it suited you. Foundation blood, through and through.\n\n\nO5-2:\n You are seen as worthy.\n\n\nThe rest of the Council looks at O5-2, stunned.\n\n\nO5-2:\n The trials set forth upon you, Anton, son of Maria and Andrei, were clear. You are one us the few, and it is an unchangeable truth.\n\n\nThe council looks at Dr. Radu.\n\n\nO5-2:\n No one man wishes upon himself this role. But it is a responsibility. A responsibility you have to the world, to protect the weak.\n\n\nA moment of silence.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Your perception of your qualities is naught to the universe. This is the place you were always meant to be. I am sorry.\n\n\nA moment of long silence. Dr. Radu stares down at the table, tapping his fingers. The silence is only occasionally broken by the whirring of O5-3's mechanical body.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n I see.\n\n\nO5-1:\n I\u2026 I'm not one to speak of destiny, Anton, but it's true.\n\n\nO5-4:\n The Foundation requires a 12th.\n\n\nDr. Radu sighs.\n\n\nA. Radu:\n Understood.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Perfect. Then, Dr. Anton Radu, do you accept the promotion to the position of O5-12? For the sake of all normalcy, and the people who live within it?\n\n\nA. Radu nods his head for the last time.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I do.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Congratulations. Welcome to the O5 Council, the high and final authoritative body of the Foundation, O5-12. We have a lot of work to get done.\n\n\nO5-12:\n You're darn right we do; and I know where to start.\n\n\n[END]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nscp7209clearance5.file\n\n\n\n\nclose\u00a0file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nesoteric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\ndecommissioned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\ndark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nnotice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:\n SCP-7209 is stored within Site-Gamma, the 3rd level to Secure Facility 01, and is to only be interacted with in conjunction with the activation of PROJECT ROYALE. Regular mechanical maintenance is required by a rotating schedule of amnectisized level 1 mechanics and janitorial staff, who will be terminated and replaced in 1-month cycles. All individuals responsible for the construction of SCP-7209 will remain under close watch of the O5 Council if critical changes must be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG-SE, Wing Alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7209 is the SWEENEY-GREENE SIMULACRUM ENGINE, a Class-4 Simulation Development, and Procedural Generation Mechanism, produced for the express purpose of PROJECT ROYALE.\n\n\nSCP-7209 differs from most anomalous simulation mechanisms in that it receives inputs both from standard input code, as well as information stored in the simulation user's conscious and subconscious memory. This specific ability allows for the creation of 82.6% more believable simulations and is used proactively within PROJECT ROYALE to create a realistic environment in which O5 Candidates are unaware of their status inside the simulation.\n\n\nSCP-7209 also contains a highly adaptive AIC complex (designed SCP-7209-\u0393), which has been connected to all 13 members of the O5 Council. Activatable through remote passphrase entry, the AIC complex can receive mental inputs from the O5 Council to influence behavior within the simulation; the AIC is also programmed to act out the necessary steps of PROJECT ROYALE in conjunction with the environment generated by SCP-7209. This has been used to create \"antagonists\" to O5 Candidates during the thus far 7 iterations of PROJECT ROYALE, which have included: High Priest Robert Bumaro (Iteration 2, \"AMONI-RAM\"), P. Hudson Gock (Iteration 4, \"GAME OVER\") and The Engineer (Iteration 7, \"CHAOS TAKEOVER\").\n\n\nUPDATE\n\n\nBy executive order of O5-12, with approval from a simple majority of the O5 Council, SCP-7209 has been decommissioned. Mechanical elements and materials are to be salvaged for future SIMULACRUM projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
