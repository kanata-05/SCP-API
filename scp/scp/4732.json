All web listings or written records of SCP-4732-1 are to be destroyed. All instances of SCP-4732-1 are to be sought out and recovered. Any persons found in the possession of SCP-4732-1 are to be administered a Class C amnestic. Recovered instances of SCP-4732-1 are to be kept in Storage Cell 4732-A.\n\n\nAt the current time, all testing with SCP-4732 has been indefinitely postponed.\n\n\nShould testing require Sinatra to be convinced information he is given is true, bringing up the details of his suicide attempt using a gas stove or his ties with the mafia in Chicago have both proven reliable methods for gaining his trust.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4732 is a vinyl record copy of the live Frank Sinatra album \"Sinatra at the Sands\".\n1\n When played, the record produces an anomalous event: 5 minutes and 35 seconds into track 9, Sinatra will interrupt the audience's laughter and claim that he \"hears somethin' funny\". Beginning at this time, it is possible to speak directly with Sinatra for the remaining duration of the recording. After SCP-4732 has finished playing, all existing copies of the live album \"Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin: Our Kind of Paradise!\"\n2\n (hereby referred to as instances of SCP-4732-1) change to reflect an alternate reality modified by what Sinatra has been told. Every time the event is repeated, Sinatra shows no memory of the previous event, and all instances of SCP-4732-1 are rewritten to exclusively reflect the results of the new event.\n\n\nAddendum 4732/0 - Testing Logs\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 4732-0:\n\n\nExperimenter:\n Dr. Croon\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-4732 was played on a standard turntable.

If so, save it for later. I ain't off yet, see? I still gotta make funna' Joe E. Lewis.\n\n\n(Audience laughs)\n\n\nDr. Croon:\n This is\u2026 scheduled entertainment. It won't take long.\n\n\nSinatra:\n Uh huh\u2026 now, do you all wanna hear about good ol' Joe E. Lewis, or do you wanna listen to this bum tell me my fortune? \n(The audience cheers and applauds)\n Alright, the people have spoken, mystery man. Show me what you got.\n\n\n(Sinatra begins sarcastically making \"magic\" sounds, which the audience applauds. Dr. Croon cuts him off)\n\n\nDr. Croon:\n You will die of a heart attack on May 14th, 1998. Dean Martin will die of Lung Cancer on December 25th, 1995.\n\n\n(There is a brief silence.

I'm gonna die of lung cancer soon! \n(Audience laughs)\n Speakin' of, did this fortune teller say \nwhen\n by any chance?\n\n\nSinatra:\n Yeah, as a matter a' fact he did. 1995.\n\n\nMartin:\n I'm gonna go out at 78, huh? Well what about you? He say anythin' about you, Frank?\n\n\nSinatra:\n Yeah. Heart attack. 1998.\n\n\nMartin:\n Phew!
