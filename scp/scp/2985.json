SCP-2985-6 comprises the audio journal of SCP-2985's creator, POI-2985 \"Adrian Baudin\" and an additional cognitohazardous audio file, which contains a sequence of synthesized notes that can only be described by listeners in terms one would use to describe a painting.\n\n\nThose who hear SCP-2985-6's cognitohazardous file report that it is primarily red and black and features expressionistic facial design depicting anguish.\n\n\nAddendum: Contents of SCP-2985-6\n\nNames were written on each disk in red permanent marker, in a cursive script. Vocal analysis suggests that POI-2985 is most likely a British male.\n\n\nDisk One: \"Waters\"\n\n\n\n\nI think I have the method. Not the \naesthetics\n, or the colors, or the emotions, or the style. Best to ignore them. To that end, I won't look at it again. It's not a target anymore and I can't think of it as such, else I risk to render the exercise pointless. Not a target, a pinpoint one hits with a dart thrown blindfolded.\n\n\nGeoff came over today. He offered some paints appropriate for the period, but I refused. Standard kit only. Asked me if I'd eaten. We went for dinner, at a cafe along the lake. After he'd gone, I sketched the boats. I'm not sure he gets it. But that's fine. He thinks an old man may have his hobbies, and I'd be inclined to agree.\n\n\n[A crackling noise is audible in the background]\n\n\nNot building from blank canvas feels off.

Does not feel like I thought it would. I don't feel equal; no great reverence burst from me as I became the old masters. Instead I'm\u2026 proud? It doesn't feel like someone else's. I can think of the boats I saw before. They looked \njust\n like this. If my memories have tainted the work, why does it still match?\n\n\nNearly slipped today, coming up here. The stairs are concrete, but I grabbed the railing in time. And then when I got to my room, I noticed something had rubbed off in my hand, a tiny disc of paper. But there were creases on it, like\u2026 like it was\u2026 folded? And every time I look at it, I hear a jingle in my head.\n\n\nI do not need this right now.

He seems less attentive than he was yesterday. Maybe he's busy? Working on something? I don't know. Maybe he didn't see me. I'll\u2026 ask later.\n\n\nI'll find him tomorrow.\n\n\nI'm old, but I'm not a master. We'll see how it goes.\n\n\n\n\nDisk Three: \"Flowers\"\n\n\n\n\nThere it is again. Had I an interest in forgeries, I might be living in a mansion.\n\n\nDidn't see Geoff. Did see others, though. First at the market, then the cafe. Tall men in coats, purchasing paints.

A steady knocking is audible in the background] I put some furniture against the door. They've been knocking since one, but I've never answered. I looked through the peephole, and they were holding something up, with a funnel like a phonograph and a handle like a gun. Five men.\n\n\nThey haven't stopped knocking, but they're knocking harder now. Desk against the door and I'm out of paint. They keep on\u2026 sliding discs into the mail slot. The discs make me laugh, because of how cool they are. They \nmake\n me.\n\n\nThey talked, too.

We would like to ask you a few questions.\n\n\nAbout my work?\n\n\nTangentially. We're wondering if you could give us some information about a few men we believe have been in the area.

Never talked.\n\n\nWe're sure. What is it that you're working on, Mister Baudin?\n\n\nI've put together an exhibit, for the\u2026 you know the show? The exhibit's about the\u2026 inscrutable nature of human influence. And how it may be\u2026 scrutable. It's\u2026 a work in progress.\n\n\nWe see.\n\n\n\u2026why 'we'?\n\n\n[Silence for 10 seconds]\n\n\nCould I\u2026 sketch you?\n\n\nI suppose.\n\n\n[Shuffling sounds are heard]\n\n\nNo, no, just stay there.

When the giants walked through the forest, they left trails, and trails are the easiest path if you let yourself follow them.\n\n\nWe can't do new for the sake of new. We have to understand what is already there, and why it still remains. We can't just feebly claw at treetrunks.\n\n\nBy following the paths, a statement is made. You show others that the paths are there. No mind is incapable, it's just self-limiting. We've all been marked, and by understanding how, we can understand the why we are the way we are.\n\n\nIt's\u2026 unpacking the human mind. Working backwards. And I know I'm not the only one capable.\n\n\nGeoff is waiting outside. I'll take my canvases down, and we'll start driving. After the show, we can go back to the cafe.
