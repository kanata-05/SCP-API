Instances of SCP-2727-2 are to be terminated on sight if found outside of the area containing instances of SCP-2727-1. Testing of SCP-2727 is to be approved by at least one Level 4 Personnel.\n\n\nIn incidents in which instances of SCP-2727-2 become hostile, each known entrance to SCP-2727 are to be guarded by at least three security agents until all hostile activity ceases.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2727-1 refers to various models of subway trains, located inside several subway stations across the island of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Greece. Instances of SCP-2727-1 have been found to have \u2588\u2588 station entrances throughout the island. The interior of the subway stations resembles those from the late 1950's. The boarding area for instances of SCP-2727-1 have been measured to go as far as \u2588\u2588\u2588 meters in length. The subway stations have been recorded to have support pillars every fifteen meters in any open direction.\n\n\nSCP-2727-2 refers to humanoid individuals found inside SCP-2727-1 and the subway stations. Instances of SCP-2727-2 typically resemble \nHomo sapiens\n, but lack any facial features. Instances of SCP-2727-2 are typically docile. During times when an instance of SCP-2727-1 is present within the current subway station, large amounts of SCP-2727-2 will enter SCP-2727-1, while an equal amount of SCP-2727-2 will exit the instance of SCP-2727-1.\n\n\nDuring explorations of SCP-2727-1, SCP-2727-1 have been recorded to move to other stations not on the island. Train stations explored by SCP-2727-1 have been shown to be vastly different, including architectural and anomalous changes. Changes include:\n\n\n\n\nStation architecture matching that of Gothic work.\n\n\nSeveral holes of various sizes along the walls, ceiling, and floors of the station.\n\n\nStation being made entirely of \nOsteocytes\n (human bone).\n\n\nStation walls, floors, and ceiling being made entirely of what appeared to be pig flesh.\n\n\nStation containing no instances of SCP-2727-2. It was noted that no instances of SCP-2727-2 left SCP-2727-1 during this stop.\n\n\n\n\nDuring explorations of SCP-2727-1, instances of SCP-2727-2 changed shapes and sizes, including:\n\n\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2727-2 were reported to change into humanoid creatures similar to \nSus scrofa domesticus\n (barn pigs). It was noted that instances of SCP-2727-2 become increasingly hostile during this time.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2727-2 were reported to become invisible inside SCP-2727-1, despite instances of SCP-2727-2 being visible outside of SCP-2727-1.\n\n\nSCP-2727-2 instances were reported to be invisible. Clothing worn by SCP-2727-2 was not affected by the change.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 2727-1:\n Instances of SCP-2727-2 became hostile, attacking security guards and attempting to exit the station. Hostile instances of SCP-2727-2 were terminated immediately. Approximately fifteen minutes later, an instance of SCP-2727-1 came into the station. Fifteen instances of SCP-2727-2 proceeded to carry deceased instances onto SCP-2727-1.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a02727-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a02727-1\n\n\n\n\nD-203583 is a \u2588\u2588 year old Asian male of average build. D-203583 has no previous remarkable psychological background. D-203583 is equipped with a camera fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was observing the exploration and providing instructions for D-203583.\n\n\nD-203583 is instructed to enter one of the stations. Seventeen instances of SCP-2727-2 are seen inside the station. No instances of SCP-2727-1 are visible.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Nothing is here but those faceless things.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please wait in the general area until the train arrives.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Doc I don't think a train runs through here, there isn't even a map of the routes here.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Irrelevant.\n\n\nD-203583 stayed within the station for approximately fifteen minutes before an instance of SCP-2727-1 appeared. Seventeen instances of SCP-2727-2 were recorded to leave SCP-2727-1, and sixteen instances were recorded to get on SCP-2727-1.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please board the train.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Alright doc, where is this thing going?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That information is irrelevant for your current task.\n\n\nD-203583 proceeds to enter one of the passenger cabins of SCP-2727-1. Forty six instances of SCP-2727-2 are visible. None of the instances of SCP-2727-2 are recorded to be sitting down, despite proper seating being available.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Do you want me to just stand here with these things?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You may sit until the next destination is reached.\n\n\nD-203583:\n These things aren't moving doc, are they alive?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n They have vital signs but are not sapient.\n\n\nSCP-2727-1 was stationary for six minutes before moving. SCP-2727-1 continued moving along the path for fifteen minutes along an illuminated round tunnel. After fifteen minutes, all lights within SCP-2727-1 stopped functioning for approximately nineteen seconds. When lights became functional again, instances of SCP-2727-2 resembled humanoid members of the species\n Sus scrofa domesticus \n(barn pig). Instances of SCP-2727-2 had no facial features. D-203583 reportedly became panicked.\n\n\nD-203583:\n [EXPLICIT]! What the [EXPLICIT] happened? They look like [EXPLICIT] pigs!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n They do that sometimes.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Sometimes?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n As in, they don't always do it.\n\n\nSCP-2727-1 came to a halt, and fifteen instances of SCP-2727-2 exited SCP-2727-1 along with D-203583. Sixteen instances of SCP-2727-2 were reported to enter SCP-2727-1. SCP-2727-1 was reported to leave two minutes after D-203583 exited the instance. The station appeared to be made entirely out of pig flesh. Support pillars appeared to be made out of bone. Twenty two instances of SCP-2727-2 were recorded to be in the station.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Jesus Christ. [Pause] It smells like someone is cooking hotdogs.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Noted. Can you see an exit?\n\n\nD-203583 began walking towards the far wall of the station. A slanted hole in the wall, leading to a brighter area, was recorded approximately nineteen meters ahead of D-203583.\n\n\nD-203583:\n I think there is a hole outside, but no stairs.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please approach the hole.\n\n\nD-203583 proceeded to approach the hole. Three instances of SCP-2727-2 are recorded to follow D-203583.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Doc? A few of these things are starting to follow me.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Noted. Please exit the station.\n\n\nD-203583 exited the station. Audio shows that an instance of SCP-2727-1 was inside the station during this time. The outside of the station was covered completely in pig flesh. A green smog covered visibility and prevented sight beyond approximately sixteen meters. Approximately forty instances of SCP-2727-2 were outside of the station and within sight. No geographic features were recorded during this time. Six instances of SCP-2727-2 began moving towards D-203583.\n\n\nD-203583:\n Doc, more of these things are coming towards me.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n It has been noted. Please move the camera so we can-\n\n\nD-203583:\n Doc, the ones inside the station are starting to run.\n\n\nVideo feed confirms that seven instances of SCP-2727-2 were running out of the station towards D-203583.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Confirmed. Please remain calm.\n\n\nD-203583 does not reply as seven instances of SCP-2727-2 began bludgeoning him with their fists and heads. An additional three more instances of SCP-2727-2 approach D-203583 with large stones. D-203583 was heard cursing in Mandarin and begging for mercy during this time. The new instances of SCP-2727-2 proceed to bludgeon D-203583 to death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a02727-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a02727-2\n\n\n\n\nD-203584 is a \u2588\u2588 year old Caucasian male of average build. D-203584 has no previous remarkable psychological background. D-203584 is equipped with a camera fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was observing the exploration and providing instructions for D-203584.\n\n\nD-203584 was instructed to enter one of the stations. Approximately six instances of SCP-2727-2 are inside the station. An instance of SCP-2727-1 is seen.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please board the train.\n\n\nD-203584:\n What about these.. faceless things?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n They are not relevant, please board the train.\n\n\nD-203584 boards the instance of SCP-2727-1 along with two instances of SCP-2727-2, it is estimated that three instances of SCP-2727-2 left the instance of SCP-2727-1. Approximately nine instances of SCP-2727-2 are present within the instance SCP-2727-1.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please wait until the destination is reached.\n\n\nD-203584:\n Where is this thing going?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That information is not necessary for your objective.\n\n\nD-203584:\n Doc, there's a poster in this thing, I can't read it.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Confirmed. Please steady the camera on the poster.\n\n\nD-203584 adjusts the camera to show the poster. The poster contains seven instances of SCP-2727-2, along with the russian words \"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\" which roughly translates to 'the good men.'\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you. Please inspect the train car for items of similar nature.\n\n\nD-203584 searches the train car for approximately nine minutes before finding what appeared to be a small journal and a brochure. Instances of SCP-2727-2 do not acknowledge D-203584 during this time. SCP-2727-1 begins moving at this time.\n\n\nD-203584:\n Doc, I found this\u2026 journal.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How many pages are written in the journal?\n\n\nD-203584 is heard flipping through the pages.\n\n\nD-203584:\n About five. What do you want me to do with it?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please hold each page in front of the camera long enough for stills to be taken of each.\n\n\nD-203584 proceeds to do so. Refer to Document 2727-1 for journal entries. At this time the instance of SCP-2727-1 stopped. The doors to the train car open, and thirteen instances of SCP-2727-2 rush towards D-203584, instances are shown to be equipped with gas masks from the late 1920's and munitions used during the 1920's. D-203584 is dragged from the instance of SCP-2727-1 before video feed cuts off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 2727-1\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nThey took Bill's eyes today, sewed what was left shut. He's a businessman, why the [EXPLICIT] are they torturing him? He stopped screaming lately. I thought they removed his voice box until he asked me where god was. John stopped banging on the door after one of them opened it and hit him with the butt of its gun. Whatever these things are, they aren't human.\n\n\nBill is really calm considering what happened. Must be in denial. I feel sorry for the guy. He never told us how he got here. John was pulled from his platoon, and I was taking a piss when they got me. Damn Russians.\n\n\nJanuary 25, 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nThey took Bill again. Last time they took John's fingers. I felt bad for Bill, he's had the worst so far. We didn't hear much screaming. He came back and didn't talk. I left him alone until I heard him humming. He looked up with his sewed up eyes, and I almost vomited. They took his mouth.\n\n\nFebruary 3, 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nBill's been gone for about two days now. John's convinced they killed him. I don't think they are that merciful. I thought about killing Bill before they took him last time, just end the misery, but he didn't hear a word I said. He just sat there, bald, blind, and mute. I think they closed his ears.\n\n\nFebruary 9, 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nBill's back. They took the stitches out. Shaved his eyebrows too. They must have done a flesh graft, I can't see where his eyes or lips were anymore. He just sat against the wall next to the door. I can't figure out how he's breathing. John said he breaths through his ass now. It was just a joke, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was true. They gave him new clothes, just like his old ones, but not covered in his own blood. He looks like one of those mannequins in a store.\n\n\nFebruary, 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nThey took Bill again. About an hour later they took John and I out, blindfolded us and stuck us on a train. It's been moving for a while. Bill is standing way back, he hasn't moved in a while. John just sat down. He's had enough of this bullshit. So have I. I lost track of what day it was. I think it's February.\n\n\nThe doors opened, and things that looked like Bill got on. About five on them. John is freaking out, saying they turned Bill into one of those things.\n\n\nOh god.\n\n\nThey look like pigs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2726\n | SCP-2727 | \nSCP-2728\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2727\n\" by Flower on the Wall, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
