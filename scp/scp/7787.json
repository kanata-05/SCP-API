Upon discovery, said mentions are to be removed from the internet. Misinformation is to be released claiming that SCP-7787 is a hoax. SCP-7787\u2019s page on the Lost Media Wiki is to be edited with information \u201cconfirming\u201d its status as non-existent.\n\n\nDue to the lack of knowledge on SCP-7787-1 and related anomalies, along with the near confirmed danger of it remanifesting, further testing is prohibited. SCP-7787 is not to be opened by anyone of any clearance level for any reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poster image for SCP-7787.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7787 refers to a Japanese visual novel known as \n\"A Chance Meeting With Yukiya\"\n (\n\u3086\u304d\u3084\u3068\u306e\u9082\u9005\n). Prior to containment, SCP-7787 had a minor presence in the lost media community, as its existence was unconfirmed. SCP-7787 was discovered by Foundation researcher Dr. Tatsuki Masuda using anomalous archival technology. Playing an unknown amount of SCP-7787 will initiate SCP-7787\u2019s primary affect, the manifestation of SCP-7787-1.\n\n\nSCP-7787-1 refers to Yukiya Sasaki, the love interest of SCP-7787. Approximately a week after SCP-7787 is opened, SCP-7787-1 will manifest in reality.\n\n\nSCP-7787-1 will embed itself in the life of the player. During SCP-7787\u2019s activation, an antimemetic effect is present, preventing anyone but the player from knowing about the existence of SCP-7787 or learning that SCP-7787-1 is a video game character. This effect includes removal of all online references to SCP-7787, and an inability to perceive any representation of SCP-7787-1 in visual documentation, such as screenshots.\n\n\nAll knowledge on the inner workings of SCP-7787 and SCP-7787-1 are based on the initial activation by Dr. Masuda.

Details about its release are limited.\n\n\nStory and Gameplay:\n\n\nThe game was a horror visual novel masquerading as a game in which the protagonist romances a man named Yukiya Sasaki. It played like a typical visual novel, with options that elicited different responses out of other characters, despite only having one ending.\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\n\nThe game starts with the player meeting Yukiya at the store, striking up a conversation with him, and discovering the two of them have a lot in common. The two continue to meet on accident, giving the player the chance to get closer with him. The player is warned by their three closest friends that Yuikya is dangerous, but they ignore this advice until their friends start being mysteriously killed by an unknown perpetrator. It is revealed at the end that the killer is Yukiya, who believed them to be in the way between him and the player. The game ends with the main character turning the light on in their bedroom to reveal Yukiya, who embraces them and promises to never leave them.\n\n\nAvailability:\n\n\nThe game was uploaded by ChillDaze to download and play for free on Windows, Mac OS and Linux online sometime between 2007 and 2011. ChillDaze only uploaded one game before their website went defunct in 2012. Their website is still available to view on the internet archive, including the page about A Chance Meeting With Yukiya.\n\n\nRecovery:\n\n\nThe files for the game were discovered by Lost Media Wiki user SapphireFantasy on June 12th, 2022. SapphireFantasy has stated that they discovered the OS files for the game on the 202nd page of Google on an unsecured website. SapphireFantasy played the game using an emulator, fully translating and uploading the gameplay to their YouTube account of the same name.\n\n\nThe main image I\u2019ll upload for the article\n\n\n\n\nACMWYPoster.png\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChillDaze's logo\n\n\n\n\nChillDazeLogo.png\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay cool, I\u2019ll gather some screenshots and stuff for the LMW page and I\u2019ll be golden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMy review of the game: (that I'll probably post on twitter or smth)\n\n\nI feel its a really fun game. Yukiya is delightfully chilling as a villain. While he parades himself as a kind and caring individual, it doesn't take long for one to see he's rather manipulative, cold, and cunning. He does what he wants, and gets away with it using anime logic lol, he's a charming villain though. The mc coming to the suspicion that her friends may actually be right is very good and sad when she realizes too late, and the last death takes place. the final scene had chills running down my spine fr. I'm glad I could help find it!\n\n\ncool before I upload the game I just wanna make sure I have everything in order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nItem #: idk lets go with 7787\n\n\nLets cut to the chase WHAT THE FUCK he has to be anomalous\n\nThe game has to be anomalous I dont even fuckjng know anymore yukiya sasaki is nOT A 5 YEAR ANOMALOUS TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST HES A FUCKING ANIME CHARACTER\n\nI tried to show Juniper a picture of him but she said it was static and when I asked her about it later she didnt remember what is happening\n\nIt seems that the game is coming to life. Damnit.\n\n\nthis is so scary.\n\n\nI need to talk to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0PLAY\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nYukiya:\n Oh, it\u2019s absolutely no problem! I\u2014\n\n\nTatsuki:\n Can I talk to you?\n\n\nYukiya:\n Oh, just give me second, Ella. Tatsuki, hey.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n Follow me.\n\n\n[shuffling]\n\n\nYukiya:\n Dear me, you seem frantic.

You look pale.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n Don\u2019t you fucking play dumb!\n\n\nYukiya:\n I\u2019m not playing dumb. You\u2019re really concerning me. But I won\u2019t tell anyone. Maybe you should ask Director Winters to take the rest of the day off.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n You motherfucker! I-I-\n\n\nYukiya:\n Hey, it's okay. Just breathe.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n SHUT UP! I don't wanna hear it! Get\u2014 Get away from me!\n\n\n[footsteps]\n\n\nYukiya:\n \n[distantly]\n Tatsuki\u2014\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHe called after me, but quickly gave up. He seems to care about my well being. I hope he gets hit by a bus.\n\n\nThis has so many implications.\n\n\nGod. What is going on? I feel like I'm going insane. I feel sick. He can\u2019t really be real, can he?\n\n\nHe's like, just here now. As a real person, like me or any other human. His hair is dyed blonde, but everything else translated from 2D to real perfectly. It's so weird. It's not that cold, doesn't he get hot with that large ass scarf?\n\n\nI\u2019ve just got so much on my mind. This game is anomalous. Who wouldve fucking though that the game I'm most interested in finding is a damn anomaly.\n\n\nWell I guess I have to regroup now. I tried showing to my colleagues that yukiya is from a game, but it didnt work. So maybe if I can make him talk to me? About the game. I can make him slip up. I just have to record my interactions with him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve decided to meticulously record everything about this I want to write an SCP file, but I can\u2019t. I'm pretty sure no one would be able to see it anyway.\n\n\nPlus I dont have enough information. All I know is that he came to life. That\u2019s not enough for a file. But maybe I can compile enough information, eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIts been ten days since Yukiya appeared. Maybe he really doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s from a game? He hasn\u2019t slipped up at all. In that case, I feel really bad for being so rude. But I don\u2019t know, he could just be totally lying like Yukiya does in the game.\n\n\nJeez, this is complicated. There are endless possibilities. Maybe he just appeared in reality and thats it? That\u2019s all the game does is make the love interest come to life? He could really believe he\u2019s a foundation doctor, who knows?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good idea, but its kinda nice to see my thoughts. I'm not really sure where to start with everything. Interacting with actual people is strange.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI posted on twitter if anyone remembered the game, and no one remembered it! I know its obscure but im not the only one who knew. It had a page on LMW but its not there anymore!\n\n\nI used the recovery programs I used to find the game and see if I could find the LMW page, but it\u2019s just completely gone, like it never existed!\n\n\nIt's like no one remembers its existence but me. I guess thats what happens when someone starts the game. It makes me wonder what happens if I finish the game\n\n\nBut I still dont have conclusive evidence that the game has even started in real life. Its been a month and yukiya is still acting clueless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI'm going to write a list of the people closest to me that I should keep an eye on. if he is being a lying bastard like he is in the game, then he could target anyone. My foundation and out of foundation friends.\n\n\n\n\nOscar Clements - Fellow anomalous technology specialist, has been my best foundation friend for three years\n\n\nMark Kane - Second best friend and crush (he doesn\u2019t know that part, though) works with our site when we\u2019ve got physical counterparts to our anomalies\n\n\nJuniper Lyons - My foundation sister, we\u2019ve been through thick and thin, I love her\n\n\nMaddie Case - Comes with mark from his site, she totally knows I have a crush on him and teases me about it lol\n\n\nPenny Winters - Site leader and sweetheart, She's stern, but a really kind boss.\n\n\nYasu Yamaguchi - Best friend from before I transferred to an American site, still in touch with him\n\n\nAsahi Masuda - Brother; he thinks I work with some popular tech companies; I havent talked to him in a bit though\n\n\nOsamu Masuda - My dad, haven't talked to him in a bit, but I'm still on good terms with him\n\n\nKaori Masada - Mom, also on good terms with her!\n\n\nMia Masada - my niece, love her to pieces if Yukiya killed her he\u2019d be a monster shes like 6\n\n\nKazuyuki Ikeda - best friend from back home, havent talked in years, but he's still my best friend, whenever we talk it's like no time has passed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve decided to apologize to Yukiya for being rude, just incase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWell, if he\u2019s being truthful, he didnt remember. He was super nice to me, told me not to worry about it even though he doesnt remember cause we're friends. I dont consider him my friend\n\n\nBut I dont know if I can trust him. It took less than a month for him in the game to get to the killing. I have a bad feeling about this. He\u2019s maybe just trying to lure me into a false sense of security. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not gonna work. Im gonna make sure that I dont fall for his fake charm for a second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTatsuki apologized. That was very kind of them. But strange. I didn't think they would. Are they actually sorry? This is probably a good thing. They might be willing to work with me. Maybe they'd understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to talk with me more. He\u2019s so nice, it\u2019s hard to believe how evil he is. We get along well, though he\u2019s picked up on my nerves when I talk to him. He says he\u2019s known me ever since I transferred to this site. He seems to have (or is faking) these fake memories of when we first met. Other people believe him! I asked Maddie and she says she\u2019s met him several times.\n\n\nPeople are starting to worry that I keep asking things that they think I should already know. This is just all so weird.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI should try to more concretely write an SCP file. But there\u2019s a lot about this I still don\u2019t know. The game is the anomaly, and Yukiya is 7787-1. That\u2019s the number that I\u2019ll use. But I\u2019m still unsure how a lot of this shit works\n\n\nIt's been like, a month and a half since he appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try this anyway\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-7787\n\n\nObject Class:\n Idk\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Do not fucking play this game like at all costs don\u2019t fuckin play it\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7787 refers to a Japanese visual novel known as \u201cA Chance Meeting with Yukiya\u201d. Any person that plays SCP-7787 (unknown amount, presumably any) will initiate SCP-7787\u2019s primary effect, the manifestation of SCP-7787-1. SCP-7787-1 refers to the game's main love interest, Yukiya Sasaki who will manifest in reality approximately a week after the game is played. After the manifestation of SCP-7787-1, the events of the game will begin to take place in reality. It is unknown how aware SCP-7787-1 is that it is a video game character.\n\n\nuuuugh. there's so much I dont know. but we are not gonna test this thing again. if I even get past it that is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIncase this all ends and I can show these notes to someone, I feel I should note the in game deaths\n\n\nHaruka Nakaya - Found dead in her home, fell down the stairs, thought to be an accident\n\nEtsuko Aikawa - Subject of a brutal hit and run\n\nAoi Kutsuki - Found gutted in the protags room with a missing heart, given to them by Yukiya when he appears\n\n\nI need to compare who he could possibly kill in these ways. I'm thinking that Haruka will be Maddie, as they're both friends that I/mc met through another person\n\nEtsuko is probably gonna be Juniper, as they're both close friends that I/mc have known for years\n\nAoi is gonna be Mark, probs, as the mc acts a bit flirty with Aoi at some point.\n\n\nI just need to make sure. I need to religiously watch these guys to make sure he doesnt attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI didn't expect to take this long. But I've really just enjoyed being a person. I have all the time in the world, I think. I'm not actually sure. But I'm sure the stupid rules will allow me some time to enjoy myself. But Tatsuki is getting suspicious. They don't appear to enjoy my company. I fear I'm going to have to remain secretive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI'm doing my best to keep an eye on everyone. But it's kinda hard to be everywhere at once. But, I have noticed Yukiya being a bit more nosey around Maddie and Mark whenever they come around. He's been talking with her more. I've got my eye on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTomorrow is the last day that Maddie will be at our site for the next month. Either, he's gonna wait the month, or he's gonna kill her tomorrow. I've been pestering her so much, she keeps asking if im okay\n\n\nI\u2019m just really worried. I don\u2019t want anyone to die\n\n\nLike he could just be a normal guy, but I really doubt it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI\n\nI was wrong about who. But not when.\n\nJuniper. My almost sister. She died the same way Haruka did. Sort of. They found that it seemed her neck was manually broken to ensure she died. Like, whoever did it made sure she died as soon as possible.\n\n\nI feel sick. My head hurts. When I was mapping all this out it almost didn\u2019t feel real. But now that shes gone, it does. I want to throw up\n\n\nI wish that I was dreaming. can this please just be a bad dream?\n\n\nI\n\n\nI fucking\n\n\nI NEED TO TALK TO HIM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0PLAY\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nTatsuki:\n Yukiya, I have to talk to you.\n\n\nYukiya:\n Ah, okay.

You killed Juniper!\n\n\nYukiya:\n Wh-What? Are you okay? I heard the death was an accident.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n Staged by you! Why- why did you snap her neck? Sh- she snaps her neck in the game\u2026 but this was forceful! You were forceful! They said she died almost immediately. Which is better than pain\u2014 but she- she\u2014 I mean\u2014 I just didn\u2019t want her to die at all! She\u2019s one of my \nbest\n friends! An sh-she\u2019s gone! Because of you!\n\n\nYukiya:\n I know it\u2019s hard for you to lose such a close friend. Do they have any leads on who did it?\n\n\nTatsuki:\n \nOf course\n it\u2019s hard you fucking psychopath! You knew she was one of my best friends! That\u2019s why \nyou\n killed her! To get to me!\n\n\nYukiya:\n You look really ill. You should go see the site infirmary. I know some months ago, you apologized for attacking me. I still don't remember you doing so. Have I done something to you?\n\n\nTatsuki:\n I\u2014 \n[sniffles]\n What\u2014 what the hell? I- I\u2026 It was you! I know it was you! Or your existence\u2026 somehow\u2026\n\n\nYukiya:\n Well, I didn't kill Juniper. But, I'm not mad at you for your accusation. You're clearly rather stressed out\u2026 Here, please let me walk you to the infirmary. You seriously look like you're about to faint.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n \n[sniffles]\n Just let me\u2014\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0AUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIt hurt to see how upset they were. I tried to ensure Juniper didn't suffer. But this is going to be worth it, I know it is. I've had so much fun just. well, being alive! I went to the animal shelter the other day to look at animals. I couldn't adopt, as I can't guarantee I'll stay around, but maybe after my victory is guaranteed. I feel terrible thinking about how excited I'll be once I win. Maybe once I win, I could do something to make up for causing Tatsuki pain. But, I wouldn't accept an apology from me, either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNone of this even feels real anymore\n\n\nI just want it to stop\n\n\nIt almost felt like I was actually playing the game. until actual consequences\n\n\nI fucking wish I NEVER FOUND THIS GAME\n\n\nwhy does this have to happen to me?\n\n\nNOTHING I SAY will fucking MAKE HIM BREAK hes an amazing actor but I fucking KNOW I kNOW THAT HES BEHIND THIS\n\n\nI will never fucking love him, ill fight against him till the day I die I wont let this MOTHERFUCKER WIN\n\n\nERG I JUST WANT TO CHOKE HIM WITH HIS STUPID SCARF\n\n\nmaybe just maybe if I win.. if I win. if I win, everything will reverse, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHe doesn't seem to even be trying to romance me. He just seems to be trying to be friends with me. he's noticed that I've been hard headed and just asked if he did anything to upset me. like DUUUUHHH but every time I bring up game shit he plays oblivious and asks me if im okay.\n\n\nHe also just\u2014 does his job? Like I mean obviously he\u2019s gonna do his job but I\u2019d expect since he has no experience he just wouldn\u2019t or would do as little as possible. But he\u2019s actually really good at it?\n\n\nIn the game, his charm starts to fade a bit. like the facade starts to fade once the first killing happens, but only by a little. hes been just as friendly and nice to me as always.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe stress of this is affecting my work. My coworkers are getting concerned. but most of them assume its junipers death. But she died before my stressed behavior started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYukiya invited me and a few other coworkers to get some dinner after work\n\n\nI don't really know why, the others were all on board, and kinda looked at me when I refused. He said he'd pay\n\n\nWhere did he get money from? there so much about this anomaly I dont really know anything about.\n\n\nHe said after Juni's death, things were tense and he wanted to help the atmosphere. weird.\n\n\nI'm not sure why he keeps trying to interact with me. Especially after he killed Juni, he should \nknow\n that I want fucking nothing to do with him\n\n\nugh. I'm\u2026 I'm trying to have hope. Hope that I actually had a good idea for once.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI have to regroup again. I was right about the how and when, but not who. Maybe all I have to know is when. I know he\u2019s following the deaths of the game, sorta. He snapped Juni\u2019s neck for some reason. Which made the death fast. Why would he want the deaths to be fast? In game he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about the pain he puts people in. he\u2019s been going with his own schedule. He at least tried to follow the game deaths it just seems he have his own twist on things. To make it less painful, I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI've been so exhausted wondering whats gonna happen next. Just wondering when I might lose someone else. Just\u2026 hang on, Tatsuki. You've got this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIt's been like, two weeks since the last killing. this is weird. I don't know why he hasn't killed anyone else. but its not like im sad that hes not killing my loved ones.\n\n\nI have noticed that he's been trying to get closer to me. like, talk to me more as if we were friends or something. he doesnt even bring up the time I yelled at him for killing juniper. I record most of our interactions. but nothing interesting has really happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI really don't want to kill anyone else. I'm hoping that there is a way around this. I may not really have a choice. Even if the memories are fake, everyone here really likes me. I've never had friends before. I like having friends. I can't be soft when the stakes are this high. It's me, or just a few people I don't know very well. And I chose me. It's strange. Are killing these people the way I'm going to win?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMy coworkers have started whispering about me. About the fact that I've been looking so dead. And acting dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYukiya is such an anomaly. and I don't mean in the \"he came from a video game\" thing. He's weird. He doesn't act like his in-game counter part. He told me he was gonna go feed ducks after work. What???? that doesnt make sense to me. that's something I feel like most people did as kids with their parents\n\n\nThough I suppose he didn't go through that sorta experience\n\n\nHe also is super eager to do things for other people, take the garbage out, go to the break room and grab snacks for the others. That sorta stuff. I don't know who enjoys that sorta stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWeird new development. Yukiya\u2019s been coming to me for advice. I asked why me and he says cause we\u2019ve known each other for a while and he doesn\u2019t feel close enough to anyone else\n\n\nHe probably said that cause I\u2019m the only one that knows his true nature\n\n\nHe asked me if I thought that the \u201ccruel for the greater good\u201d model of containment ever got exhausting to enforce\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what his goal is. I said yeah, that it did\n\n\nHe asked if I ever wished we did things differently, if we could\n\n\nI said like yeah, duh but there isn\u2019t another choice a lot of the time. He nodded and thanked me for my time\n\n\nLike wtf\n\n\nDoes this have to do with why he hasn\u2019t killed anyone else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNot much has really happened. It's now been a month and a week since Juni died. Yukiya hasn't showed any signs of going after someone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYukiya didnt come to work today. he called in sick. like, does he even have a house or does he just disappear when hes not at the foundation? I suppose the only place he has to go is the game\n\n\nwas he conscious in the game? or did he just come to knowing what he had to do?\n\n\nI wonder if anyone has actually played this game before. if so, what happened? did they win or lose? I just assume that this plays like an actual game. Im really just praying that it does, and the damage will reverse\n\n\nBut how do I win exactly\n\n\nI really havent thought of it. I guess he wins by eliminating all three of his targets. but if so why has he been so damn slow? id think he'd want to win as soon as possible\n\n\nI suppose I win by preventing the deaths. but its kinda hard to do that when he's not killing\n\n\nso I suppose we're at a state of limbo\n\n\nI just want this to be over with. this is exhausting. I want juniper back. I want my life back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI think I see what I have to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEsame berry was found dead in her office\n\n\nbullet straight to the head\n\ninstant deaht\n\n\nI dont understand. idont fuckignw gett it.

She has a slight resistance.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n How much would she know about something if someone was trying to hide it with amnestics?\n\n\nJoy:\n Not very much. Basically just that there's something she doesn't know. In terms of memetic and amnestic resistance, she's not the strongest. Just enough to set her senses off; if it even triggers, anyway.

I thought following the script was the best way to stay. But, I realized that script didn't do anything for me. I- I really didn't plan to kill you. I looked at this from every angle. This was the only solution that guaranteed I stay. I didn't want to kill anyone! That's not who I am! I'm not a killer!\n\n\n[A shuffling can be heard]\n\n\nTatsuki:\n I don't \n[coughs]\n I d-don't understand. If you like me, \n[coughs]\n Why? Why kill me? You kept t-trying to \n[coughs]\n be my friend.\n\n\nYukiya:\n Don't you get it? I don't have a choice! Do you know what it feels like to be trapped in a cold, dark void as nothing but a consciousness for ten fucking years? I just wanted to win! Part of being my own person is realizing how much I've enjoyed being alive! Eating, having people that like me and look up to me! Having responsibility! Hell, petting cats, feeding ducks! I can tell that I'm meant to be a person, not a character! haven't had any friends before!

We could've h-had a \n[coughs]\n truce.\n\n\nYukiya:\n Trust me. I thought of that. I know as much about the way this whole real life \"game\" works as you do. I don't know if it would've let me. Suppose I did tell you. Would you have even believed me? Sometimes, you have to do cruel things for the greater good. That's what I've learned at the Foundation. And I'm sure I'll go to hell for killing three innocent people. But at least I can live life to the fullest until I do.\n\n\nTatsuki:\n \n[coughs]\n I-\n\n\nYukiya:\n I\u2014 I should've chosen a painless method. But I suppose I just wanted to explain this all to you. I want it to be clear that this isn't personal. You clearly hate me. Which is fine. You hate the killings. Not who I really am. And with you gone, I'll finally get to drop the facade and just be myself. \n[pause]\n Now. Just try to be calm. It'll hurt more if you struggle. I didn't want to kill you. You were simply a casualty of fate.\n\n\n[Extraneous audio removed]\n\n\nYukiya:\n I suppose if I hadn't killed anyone. \n[pause]\n Maybe\u2026 you would've agreed to keep me around. Without trying to take me down. \n[pause]\n I wish that I would've thought things through. I tried to follow the path. I- this isn't who I am. I'm not a killer. I didn't want to be a killer. \n[sobs]\n I'm sorry, Tatsuki. I\u2019m so very sorry. It looks like fate wasn\u2019t kind to either of us. I'm sure you'll go to heaven. You're a good person. I can pretend to be for as long as I'm alive, now.\n\n\n[Extraneous audio removed]\n\n\nYukiya:\n \nWhat\n? Why am I-?\n\n\n[An unidentified shuffling can be heard.]\n\n\n[The door busts open.
