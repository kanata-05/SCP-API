This cube is to be kept within a secondary Hollow Containment Cube 5 metres across all dimensions with a material width of 5 centimetres. The larger Hollow Containment Cube is to also be filled with petroleum and kept buried 5 metres below Site-55. Any attempt to access the cube is to be deterred.\n\n\nAmended:\n Communication about SCP-6235 via text based channels is forbidden regardless of clearance level due to administrative difficulties. Any individual who reads this article is required to disregard it. Read the conversation logs below for clarification.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Conversation\u00a01:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conversation\u00a01:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nHey, do you have a minute?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nhang on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nok whats up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nRyan, we\u2019re on official channels, please watch your grammar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nbaite meoeoeoee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nOk seriously what\u2019s up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nI\u2019ve found a file for a scip but I think it\u2019s bugged or something, the description is missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nWhat? The entire description?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nYeah, and the containment procedures sound like total nonsense. Apparently it\u2019s buried inside 2 boxes under this site?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nHuh, that is weird. Also, grammar. You forgot a comma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nGod damn it Ryan I\u2019m serious, if this is user error you know what could happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nFine, fine. What\u2019s the scip number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\n6235\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nOk loading it now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nUuh, Casey?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nWhen you said the description was missing, what did you mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nIt was blank. Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nLike, entirely blank? No text at all?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nYeah?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nHave you refreshed the page since you started messaging me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nNo, why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nI know right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Conversation\u00a02:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conversation\u00a02:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nHey Nick, we have a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nWatching your grammar for once Ryan?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nHa, this is serious. We think there\u2019s a network breach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\n\u2026Nick?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nWhat did you do this time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nOk that\u2019s\u2026 deserved honestly but I didn\u2019t do anything, I swear! There\u2019s a scip, SCP-6235 and it\u2019s auto-updating with chat-logs from the internal foundation intranet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nRyan if this is some kind of elaborate joke, you\u2019re in deep trouble. I\u2019ve been lenient with you before but this is way beyond out of line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nYou think I don\u2019t know that? How would I even do this, I don\u2019t have the clearance to edit files, never mind create them and as far as I can tell this file was created today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nFair point. Have you spoken with anyone else about this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nOnly Casey, but she\u2019s the one who told me as you can see above so I don\u2019t think that counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nNo-one else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nOk, I\u2019m letting my supervisor know about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nYour\n supervisor? Jeez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n1215\n:\n\n\nShut up Ryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Conversation\u00a03:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conversation\u00a03:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n5443\n:\n\n\nOk, but are you seriously sure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nYeah, it has to be some kind of hostile actor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n5443\n:\n\n\nIt\u2026 could just be an anomaly. We do literally work for the SCP Foundation Morris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nYeah, but what are the odds of an anomaly directly affecting a file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n5443\n:\n\n\nDecently high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nFair. Still, Occam\u2019s Razor II applies. Don\u2019t ascribe to anomalies what can easily be explained by malice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n5443\n:\n\n\nFair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nI mean if you want to refresh your memory of my argument, I\u2019m sure the article has a copy by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n5443\n:\n\n\nUh, it hasn\u2019t actually. It has this conversation but no trace of Nick\u2019s call to me or my call to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\n\u2026interesting. Call me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nNow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Conversation\u00a04:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conversation\u00a04:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nI just tried to edit its containment procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nwhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nI just tried to edit its containment procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nyou can edit files?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nWell yeah, I\u2019m a researcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nOr, at least I normally can. It was instantly edited back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nk first of all it is news to me that researchers can just edit the files. do you have any idea how many times I\u2019ve had to go get a pass-key or something from nick to make a minor fix?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nYes, Ryan, I know. And don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re actually surprised by this, you go on that rant every time it comes up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nfine fine. anyway second; thats weird.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nThat\u2019s it? Weird?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\ni mean what do you want me to say, someone is editing the files to undo any changes to it. it\u2019s weird.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nSomeone, or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nwhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nWell, this could easily be an anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nok fine yeah, someone or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nIt's not an unreasonable guess Ryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nsure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n2349\n:\n\n\nOh also, your grammar has gotten worse again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-\n9432\n:\n\n\nSeriously, bite me Casey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Conversation\u00a05:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conversation\u00a05:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nHello.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nDon\u2019t pretend that you can\u2019t respond. Someone or something is editing this document, and we\u2019ve locked literally every security clearance out of it. Meaning that whatever\u2019s editing the file, is within the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nOr maybe you can\u2019t respond. Maybe you aren\u2019t intelligent after all. Just let me add an addendum to the containment procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nIt will just be to prevent people discussing you. We can\u2019t have you continually expanding or your file might start over-writing data associated with other files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nWe know which server you\u2019re in and we can just delete you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n If the file for SCP-6235 is deleted/altered without permission, or if anything is done to interrupt SCP-6235, the contents of the smaller Hollow Containment Cube will detonate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nThis file appeared yesterday; we haven\u2019t actually put the containment procedures into effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nUnless\u2026 they already are?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nAre\u2026 Are you holding Site-55 hostage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3:\n Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nWouldn\u2019t detonating the Hollow Containment Cube constitute suicide?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4:\n The Hollow Containment Cube contains SCP-6235. SCP-6235 cannot edit this file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nThen\u2026 what are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5:\n SCP-6235's file will be free to edit from 13:00 to 13:01 on 5th of May 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nWait, but it\u2019s already almost 1pm, couldn\u2019t you give me more notice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nHello??\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-\n3349\n:\n\n\nShit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a06:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a06:\n\n\n\n\nAs long as the edict lain out in the updated containment procedures is followed, no harm will come to Site-55.
