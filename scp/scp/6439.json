Evidence of its existence should be sought out and quarantined, and amnestics administered as necessary.\n\n\nIn addition, to continue the effective containment of SCP-6439-1, Foundation assets should work to encourage the traditions associated with Halloween and counter attempts to eliminate or substantially change them.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6439 is a temporal anomaly taking the form of an extra 24-hour period per calendar year. The anomaly is accompanied by an amnestic effect; it can only be perceived under specific circumstances and through specific methods. Researchers assigned to SCP-6439 believe this amnestic effect is caused by SCP-6439-1 (consult the Addenda Materials for further information). As such, its existence has been rendered unknown to all but a very small number of people who have encountered evidence of it. This evidence is extremely rare and all of it is believed to be in Foundation hands, though other instances of SCP-6439 being perceptible are being actively sought out.\n\n\nPrimary evidence for SCP-6439 comes from three sources. The first is the recording of a radio broadcast received by a high-orbit American spy satellite to which the Foundation has covert access. It is a commercial broadcast from WAEK \u2018The Wake\u2019, a local radio station in Kentucky, specifically the show \u2018Midnight To Morning With DJ Abby\u2019. The show was evidently broadcast during a non-existent period between October 31st and November 1st.\n\n\nThe second is the evidence given by a CIA technical analyst, Gavin McCrae, to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, concerning a Chinese satellite and its anomalous data.\n\n\nThe third is marginalia in a medieval Irish manuscript, \nThe Book of the Days of Leinster\n, describing events supposedly having taken place in the 9th century CE.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6439.1:\n Radio Broadcast of \u2018Midnight To Morning With DJ Abby\u2019\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n That was George Michael with \u2018Careless Whisper\u2019, bringing us into this October 32nd with the sexiest sax in music. I\u2019m Abby, here to keep my shift workers and midnight lurkers company from the turn of the calendar up to the early hours. Call in to request a song, anything you like as long as it\u2019s classic and cool, or just tell me what\u2019s on your mind. As those costume parties are winding down and the trick or treaters finally come down off their sugar buzz, we\u2019ll be keeping it calm and copacetic here on WAEK, The Wake.\n\n\nProducer Wendell has just handed me a note from our weather desk. There\u2019s an extreme weather warning for all parts of the state. Don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s tornadoes or raining frogs, it just says \u2018extreme weather\u2019. So it\u2019s looking like a weird night, and not just because yesterday was Halloween.\n\n\nAnd speaking of my loyal colleague Wendell, he\u2019s telling me we have a caller on the line. Hi there, you\u2019re speaking with DJ Abby. What\u2019s happening?\n\n\nCalvin:\n Hi Abby, Calvin here, uh, long time listener, first time caller. Listen, it\u2019s kinda crazy out here, I was wondering if your listeners have ever seen anything like what\u2019s going down here.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Sure thing, Calvin, speak to me.\n\n\nCalvin:\n I\u2019m down at the Primo Pins Bowling Alley, near West Creek? Just, you know, hanging out. There are a bunch of people here. Well, I say people, but they\u2019re more like\u2026 shadows.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Shadows?\n\n\nCalvin:\n Yeah. I thought maybe it was a bunch of goof-offs wearing all black bodysuits for Halloween, but they got closer and I could, like, kinda see through them. They were coming out of the darkness past the parking lot lights. I was with my buddy, we were smoking, you know, and he said, \u2018look at these goobers, I\u2019m gonna go mess with them.\u2019 But now I can\u2019t see him and these shadow people are all around the car.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Sounds far out. Maybe you oughta drive out of there?\n\n\nCalvin:\n My buddy\u2019s got the keys. Hey, hey, he\u2019s here. Hey, Kyle! Kyle, my dude, let\u2019s split! Uh, he\u2019s not hearing me. Looks like they\u2019re carrying him.\n\n\n[\nA scream rings out, distant.\n]\n\n\nCalvin:\n Whoa, Kyle, get out of there! Aww, geez, now he\u2019s going see-through, too. The shadow people have these glowing eyes and there are way more of them. They\u2019re getting close. Hey, Kyle, you still got that piece in the glove compartment? Sorry, Abby, I gotta go.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Sounds like Calvin has his hands full there. Maybe all you out there in radioland should steer clear of Primo Pins for a while. Time for a track to keep our minds off these interesting times. Stick around, I\u2019ll be right here with you till the small hours start getting big.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n That was Dexys Midnight Runners with \u2018Come On Eileen\u2019, and she\u2019d better get moving because it is weird out there tonight. The network is sending warnings of blackouts across the state, extreme winds, hail the size of grapefruits, and a whole bunch of gosh-darned forest fires out of control. Plus there are riots in Louisville and Lexington. It\u2019s the perfect night to stay inside with me and wait out the crazy with some classic tunes.\n\n\nI'm getting word from Producer Wendell that there's a caller on the line. Tina, what\u2019s on your mind?\n\n\nTina:\n Hi Abby! I\u2019m calling from Owensboro. I work at the hospital here. We\u2019ve all had to evacuate and we\u2019re hiding out in the local high school, in the gymnasium.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Sounds like something heavy is going down there, Tina.\n\n\nTina:\n Oh boy, you have no idea. Just after midnight the security guys said there was a disturbance in the basement. The next thing I know, there are naked people walking around! Naked people from the morgue! Dead folks that just got up off the autopsy table and out of the cold lockers. It was the darndest thing I ever saw. They had those autopsy incisions, some of them were from car wrecks or whatever and had bits missing. They were moaning and running about the place.\n\n\nOf course we all high-tailed it out of there. The stragglers told me some of the dead folks were conducting operations on those who couldn't run for it fast enough. All kinds of crazy things you hear, some people saying it\u2019s judgement day, or it\u2019s a weird virus from space, or aliens. I gotta say, Abby, I don\u2019t know what to think.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n As a man once said, Tina, when you\u2019re going through hell, keep going. Hunker down and ride it out.\n\n\nTina:\n Well, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re even safe in here. One man, he started screaming there were monsters eating his brain, and suddenly he\u2019s crawling up the walls and along the ceiling like a big old spider! And I saw some sasquatch-looking thing in the parking lot outside, and a whole lot more kinda shambling down main street. I know it\u2019s Halloween but this just beats all.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Stay strong, Tina, baby. Remember you\u2019re not alone. Whatever happens, we\u2019ll all see it through together.\n\n\nTina:\n A gotta say, you\u2019re real calm about all this craziness going on.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n The way I figure it, what happens, happens, and fretting about it all isn\u2019t going to make it go away. The only thing I care about is that I don\u2019t face it alone. And I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m here with our callers, all our listeners, Producer Wendell, all the good folks following us from Midnight to Morn. As long as I got that, there\u2019s no better place to ride out the storm than right here with some good tunes and good company.\n\n\nTina:\n That\u2019s a fine philosophy, Abby, but it\u2019s kinda difficult to chill out when there\u2019s people crawling on the ceiling and giant bats flying around. Did I mention the bats? I think they\u2019re bats, anyway, they look the size of airliners from down here. Hold on\u2026 \n[\nPause.\n]\n I gotta go, I think the cops just said we all gotta barricade the doors.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Stay safe, Tina. Same to all of you out there.\n\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s raining blood. And in case you think I\u2019m about to spin some Slayer, I mean actual blood. It\u2019s coming down in sheets outside the studio window. We got glowing symbols in the sky, looking like some kind of Latin writing. I can see the power going out in some parts of town, so we\u2019ll broadcast just as long as we can.\n\n\nRight now we have a request on the phones. Talk to me, Kevin.\n\n\nKevin:\n Glad I got through, Abby, the phones are real messed up. So, uh, I always wanted to request a song and it looks like I might not get another chance. See, the problem is \u2014 my mom, she died maybe three years ago?\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Sorry to hear that, Kevin.\n\n\nKevin:\n She\u2019s outside my kitchen window right now. She\u2019s all blotchy and has these long claws but it\u2019s definitely her. She\u2019s howling and trying to bust in. Got some players from the bridge club with her. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna make it through the night. I said to myself, it\u2019s pick up the phone now or never.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Glad to be here for you, Kevin. And I hope your mom just wants to catch up. What song do you want to request?\n\n\nKevin:\n Well, given what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s only really one song that would be appropriate.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n I\u2019m way ahead of you, buddy. For Kevin and his late mom, here\u2019s REM.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Seeing us through to the small hours, this is DJ Abby. And this might really be the end, my beautiful friends. We\u2019ve had calls from folks seeing the dead walk, monsters among us, the seas boiling and the earth aflame. Through the rain of blood outside the studio I can see the ground heaving up and rivers of lava flowing across our bluegrass state. Most of the phone lines are down, but\u2026 \n[\nPause.\n]\n Producer Wendell says someone\u2019s got through.\n\n\nCaller, you\u2019re on the air.\n\n\nDon:\n Abby! Oh thank God you\u2019re there, Abby. My name\u2019s Don, long time listener, I\u2019m down in Louisville and half of West End just fell into this big pit.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n I know plenty of folks who would call that an improvement.\n\n\nDon:\n I didn\u2019t much love it neither but now there\u2019s just this big fiery hole, like a lake of flame with all these things leaping around in it. People are lining up to jump in! Plus half everyone I can see are covered in these red boils and there are bugs like big fat grasshoppers everywhere. Swarms of them.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Locusts, maybe?\n\n\nDon:\n Well, they ain\u2019t ladybugs. We were having our office Halloween party when it all started and now I\u2019m stuck in Accounting dressed like Chewbacca watching the damned world end. Excuse my language but it\u2019s just been crazy. Oh boy, the Omni Hotel just fell down.\n\n\nDJ Abby:\n Thanks for calling in, Don. I gotta cut you off because something\u2019s coming down out of the sky. It\u2019s like\u2026 a mountain upside-down, made of bodies. Arms and legs, all tangled up, all writhing like worms. The sky around it\u2019s opening up like a sinkhole. The ground is warping around it. I can\u2026 I can feel its thoughts, battering against my skull.\n\n\nI think this is it, people. The last trumpet is sounding. The last disc is spun. Whoever\u2019s still listening, I\u2019m glad I could spend the last moments on the air with you.\n\n\nIt\u2019s turning towards me. Its face\u2026 a void. Emptiness. \n[\nPause.\n]\n Producer Wendell says it\u2019s got the same face as his father, but I just see an endless nothing.\n\n\nWe\u2019re getting some interference here. I\u2019ll stay on the air as long as I can. Stay strong out there, people. Do not\u2026 Go\u2026 Quietly\u2026\n\n\n[\nStatic takes over.\n]\n\n\n[\nA new voice breaks through.\n]\n\n\nUnknown:\n I have seen your offering for this year. I have heard the songs of your celebration. I have tasted your delighting in fear. And it is good.\n\n\nUnknown:\n The bargain that was struck is fulfilled. Once more you are spared. The devastation of my wake and the majesty of my horror shall be erased.\n\n\nUnknown:\n Let your devotion to fear be given voice again when next this day comes to pass. I shall cleave close to the terms of our bargain. I hunger, and unlike you, I shall not forget.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6439.2:\n Transcription of a Hearing of the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n\nThe following is the partial transcript of an evidentiary session of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, held in secret to receive the testimony of CIA technical analyst Gavin McCrae. Senator Darlene Sanchez conducted the session. Though the proceedings are classified, the Foundation acquired a transcript through its assets in the legislative branch.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nSenator Darlene Sanchez:\n Analyst McCrae, please explain the context for why you brought us here today.\n\n\nCIA Analyst Gavin McCrae:\n It\u2019s all kind of, off-the-record. None of this is official CIA policy or anything.\n\n\nSanchez:\n You won\u2019t get into trouble for colouring outside the lines, Analyst McCrae. We don\u2019t go squealing to the teacher. All we care about is the truth.\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Sometimes an issue comes up which could lead to both sides spending a lot of money or even kicking off an international incident, which could be resolved if we just talked to each other. So that\u2019s what happened here. My opposite number in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Chinese Ministry of State Security is a guy named Liu Kenong. He found out we were talking a lot about the communications satellite one of their shell companies launched three years ago.\n\n\nSanchez:\n How did this Kenong find out what the CIA was talking about?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n They spy on us as much as we spy on them. They\u2019re monitoring chatter, maybe they have agents inside. The same thing we do. It\u2019s not really my department.\n\n\nSanchez:\n I see. Continue.\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Kenong asked to meet me at the airport in Kuala Lumpur. He had my travel itinerary too, by the way. But it was a public place, so it was probably safe. Just an unofficial chat over coffee, you know. So I met him there. Nice guy, I guess. His English wasn\u2019t great but it was better than my Mandarin. Together we got by. We had to look up some of the technical stuff.\n\n\nThe CIA was worried one of the Chinese satellites was for spying. It wasn\u2019t in Earth\u2019s orbit, at least nowhere we could see, but we knew they were getting data from it. So we wondered what it was. We were getting jumpy that the Chinese had stolen a march on us. Getting ahead in the new secret space race. Kenong said we\u2019d got it all wrong.\n\n\nSanchez:\n Do you have reason to trust this Kenong?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n No more or less than he had to trust me. It\u2019s a reciprocal thing, Senator. We can\u2019t function without at least some communication with the other side. We\u2019re trying to put one over on each other, sure, but neither of us has an interest in starting a conflict over nothing that ends up costing money and lives. Simple answer, I don\u2019t have much reason, to be honest, only his word. I\u2019m just telling you what he told me.\n\n\nSanchez:\n Something of a gentlemen\u2019s agreement, then. Please continue.\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Kenong said there was a satellite but it wasn\u2019t spying on anything. It was a test. They wanted to know if they could hide something, like a space station, on the far side of the sun, orbiting opposite to the Earth. They figured it would be impossible to see from Earth so they could hide whatever they wanted there.\n\n\nThe satellite they sent up was designed to prove if that was true. They flew it to the other side of the sun and it was supposed to sit there broadcasting test signals. If the Chinese could pick them up, or if anyone else on Earth did, they\u2019d know the idea was a no-go.\n\n\nThe thing is, after about six months, the Chinese were able to detect this satellite. And we were, too. So the test failed. Or worked, depending on your point of view.\n\n\nSanchez:\n What did the CIA believe they had detected?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Like I said, we thought it was a spy satellite. We didn\u2019t know what it was supposed to be spying on from way out there but we didn\u2019t like it. The tension started rising, we were trying to crack codes and get people inside the Chinese operation to find out.\n\n\nThen the Chinese reacted and started hunting down moles and tightening security. Everyone\u2019s getting more paranoid, convinced something big\u2019s about to happen. It\u2019s only so long before someone does something stupid. That\u2019s what Kenong was trying to defuse.\n\n\nSanchez:\n I see. And this idea the Chinese had, of hiding something behind the sun. It didn\u2019t work because it could be detected from Earth?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n That was inconclusive. The satellite kept going off course. Kenong didn\u2019t understand it, he told me. He assumed it was just a malfunction, but then they noticed the satellite\u2019s atomic clock was exactly one day off compared to the one they\u2019d synched it to on Earth. And yes, they checked if it was a leap year. They went through the programming, didn\u2019t find any bugs, recoded the whole thing and tried again.\n\n\nA year passes, and the same thing happened. The satellite went off course, the Chinese saw it, we saw it, suddenly the CIA Director is being briefed on this new secret Chinese weapon again. The Chinese try to fix it, can\u2019t find what\u2019s wrong, and try a third time. One year later? Same thing. Exactly twenty-four hours out of whack. So eventually they gave up and recalled the satellite. Kenong said it burned up on re-entry, like they\u2019d planned.\n\n\nSanchez:\n Did Kenong believe it was a malfunction?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Of course. So did I. It\u2019s the only explanation. Either there\u2019s a bug in the programming or there\u2019s an extra day in the year no one knows about. \n[\nHe laughs.\n]\n\n\nSanchez:\n And how would this extra day get there?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSanchez:\n If there were an extra day we don\u2019t experience on Earth, but the rest of the universe does, that means this satellite was programmed for 365 days instead of 366. How might that occur?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n I\u2019m not sure I follow you. Time is time, you can\u2019t change it.\n\n\nSanchez:\n You\u2019ll forgive my high school physics, but time can change, can it not? With a large enough gravity source? A black hole, that kind of thing?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Sure, but the biggest thing nearby is the sun and it doesn\u2019t distort spacetime that much. If there were a black hole anywhere near us, we\u2019d know about it. Or rather we wouldn\u2019t know anything because we\u2019d be sucked in pretty fast.\n\n\nSanchez:\n So what could the explanation be?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n Senator, please excuse me, but are you genuinely suggesting our perception of the length of a year is wrong?\n\n\nSanchez:\n I am privy to information that even a CIA analyst is not. What seems ridiculous to you is very pertinent to us. Humour me. What could make that happen?\n\n\nMcCrae:\n I don\u2019t know. Aliens? Magic?\n\n\nSanchez:\n I see. Thank you, Analyst McCrae. Your evidence has been very enlightening.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6439.3:\n Analysis of \nThe Book of the Days of Leinster\n\n\nThe following is a translation and commentary of writing found in the margins of \nThe Book of the Days of Leinster\n, a manuscript held in the Trinity College Library in Dublin. The book dates from the 10th century and is a chronicle of Irish kings and significant events from the mid-9th century. The translation and notes are by Professor Sean Dullan. This document came to the Foundation\u2019s attention as potential evidence of a historical anomaly and was retrieved following a data search regarding temporal anomalies and eschatological scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nThe text consists of three passages of marginalia across two pages of the manuscript, in a notably less sophisticated hand than the main text. The Middle Irish used is highly colloquial and includes abbreviations and elisions, rendering many challenges in translation. Apart from this there are no significant lacunas in the text.\n\n\nThe passage begins with a statement by the unnamed writer, explaining the original copies of the tale had been lost. The writer wrote it down from memory to ensure it would not pass from memory and be forgotten. \nThe Book of the Days of Leinster\n was used as a matter of convenience and because the writer expected such a large and expensive book to be preserved.\n\n\nThe story itself dates from the early 9th century and concerns a king of Leinster named Bran mac Donnchada. This individual is not mentioned in other sources, though he may be any one of several contemporary kings in the region who used various names and honorifics. Bran was journeying north out of Leinster with a force of Irishmen and Vikings to defend his borders. The writer neglects to describe his opposition, or the numbers of his army.\n\n\nThe writer here gives a date which, according to the modern calendar, equates to October 32nd, and is presumably an error. On this day, as Bran led his army across the border, it was confronted by what the text describes as a \u2018demon\u2019. It was of great size, and had the bodies of many men, though the exact meaning of this is not clear. It is described as \u2018descending\u2019, perhaps literally from the sky, or metaphorically as a predator descends on its prey.\n\n\nBran\u2019s army scattered at the sight. Some men were \u2018struck down\u2019, though again the text is ambiguous on whether this meant \u2018killed\u2019 or \u2018rendered unconscious\u2019. Others went mad, or fled. The writer states the demon\u2019s face was perceived by some men as that of a hideous monster, and by others as that of a family member, animal, or religious figure.\n\n\nKing Bran was not among those who fled or were incapacitated. In the demon\u2019s face he saw an image of himself, weak and bound in ropes. But Bran was not afraid. The writer alludes to Bran\u2019s widely acknowledged valour and his many deeds in war, though does not name them.\n\n\nBran and the demon then engaged in a discussion. The writer describes them speaking of the state of the world and whether the demon should destroy it or not. Bran maintained the world was a fine place and full of brave men and fair women, and all the glories of nature. The demon, however, was not convinced, and determined to destroy it and everyone in it.\n\n\nBran, however, was cunning and wise as well as very brave, and proposed a deal to the demon. If he saw to it that a festival was held in the demon\u2019s honour, he asked that the demon spare the world and undo the terror it had already wrought. The demon thought upon this, and decided it would return in exactly one year. If the festival was to its liking, the demon would hold off destroying the world and cause all that happened on that day to be undone, so the horror of its appearance would not scar the minds of all who witnessed it.\n\n\nThus the deal was struck, and King Bran returned home. He bade all the people of his own kingdom, and called upon all his allies elsewhere, to have a festival to please the demon. As the demon was a thing of fear, the festival was to celebrate fear. All things grotesque and terrifying would be sung of and paraded, and for a day, it would be as if the beautiful and the ugly had changed places.\n\n\nThat next year, when the demon arose with much madness and destruction. It was pleased by the festival and did as it had bargained, turning back the day and sparing the world. King Bran lamented he would never see the result of his cunning, nor would any other witness it, for the memory itself of that day was undone. The only solace he had was when the next day dawned. For if the festival of fear did not happen, or if it was found wanting, the sun would never have risen again.\n\n\nBran had his scholars write of the day he encountered the demon and the deal the two had made. However, copies of these writings were lost, prompting the unnamed writer of the marginalia to note down all they remembered of the tale. This perhaps explains the lack of any mention of the tale elsewhere in the extant literature. Similarly, a creature of myth resembling the demon is not recorded anywhere, suggesting the tale is either one peculiar to the Leinster region, or was an invention of the unnamed writer.\n\n\n\n\nThe entity King Bran encountered, and that may still manifest on Earth on the 32nd of October every year, is designated SCP-6439-1. Its containment is likely beyond the capacity of the Foundation, and so containment efforts should instead be aimed at ensuring the tradition of Halloween continues.\n\n\nThe story of King Bran is roughly contemporary with the first mentions of Samhain, the pagan festival that took place from October 31st to November 1st. Samhain is believed to have been later combined with Christian traditions to become All Hallows\u2019 Eve, and then the modern Halloween.\n\n\nResearch into SCP-6439, and the means of perceiving missing time, continues. The Foundation is to liaise with friendly space agencies to generate reliable ways of achieving this. It is evident the reality-erasing effect does not extend to the whole universe, but only contains Earth, and that the 24 hours of missing time can be detected at a sufficient distance from Earth.\n\n\nThe exact nature of SCP-6439-1 is not known. Studying it can likely only be achieved on the 32nd of October, with the data generated being archived in a form that can survive the cognitive omission of the day. Foundation Applied Metaphysics staff are working on a means of doing this.

The Halloween parties are at the \u2018hanging out in the kitchen\u2019 stage and the costumes have all fallen apart. This is DJ Abby keeping you company until it\u2019s time to throw out the pumpkins and bring in those plastic skeletons from the yard.\n\n\nAs always, we\u2019re playing anything you want so long as it\u2019s old and good. You know, Halloween got me thinking about what it is that scares me. Not gonna say I wouldn\u2019t run if a skeleton or mummy or vampire jumped out of the shadows at me, but you know what really frightens me? It\u2019s being without you guys. Or without Producer Wendell, or anyone. It\u2019s being on my own, facing the world with no one by my side. That\u2019s why I love keeping you nighthawks and music dorks company every night. It means none of us are alone out there. We have each other. Even if I\u2019m just a voice coming from your car radio, that\u2019s a connection, and it\u2019s connections that keep us safe.\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry, folks, I\u2019m not going to get too philosophical on you. Abby\u2019s gonna keep the tunes spinning just like always. This one\u2019s a track that felt appropriate, for some reason. For everyone in this strange family of late-night listeners, here\u2019s REM with \u2018It's the End of the World as We Know It.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6438\n | SCP-6439 | \nSCP-6440\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6439\n\" by Ben Counter, Pacific Obadiah, & edited by Lt Flops, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Addendum 6439.2: Transcription of a Hearing of the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\nThe following is the partial transcript of an evidentiary session of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, held in secret to receive the testimony of CIA technical analyst Gavin McCrae. Senator Darlene Sanchez conducted the session. Though the proceedings are classified, the Foundation acquired a transcript through its assets in the legislative branch.",
        "Addendum 6439.3: Analysis of The Book of the Days of Leinster\nThe following is a translation and commentary of writing found in the margins of The Book of the Days of Leinster , a manuscript held in the Trinity College Library in Dublin. The book dates from the 10th century and is a chronicle of Irish kings and significant events from the mid-9th century. The translation and notes are by Professor Sean Dullan. This document came to the Foundation\u2019s attention as potential evidence of a historical anomaly and was retrieved following a data search regarding temporal anomalies and eschatological scenarios.\nThe entity King Bran encountered, and that may still manifest on Earth on the 32nd of October every year, is designated SCP-6439-1. Its containment is likely beyond the capacity of the Foundation, and so containment efforts should instead be aimed at ensuring the tradition of Halloween continues.\nThe story of King Bran is roughly contemporary with the first mentions of Samhain, the pagan festival that took place from October 31st to November 1st. Samhain is believed to have been later combined with Christian traditions to become All Hallows\u2019 Eve, and then the modern Halloween.\nResearch into SCP-6439, and the means of perceiving missing time, continues. The Foundation is to liaise with friendly space agencies to generate reliable ways of achieving this. It is evident the reality-erasing effect does not extend to the whole universe, but only contains Earth, and that the 24 hours of missing time can be detected at a sufficient distance from Earth.\nThe exact nature of SCP-6439-1 is not known. Studying it can likely only be achieved on the 32nd of October, with the data generated being archived in a form that can survive the cognitive omission of the day. Foundation Applied Metaphysics staff are working on a means of doing this. Until this is achieved, knowledge of the existence of SCP-6439 shall remain classified as an infohazard, and placating SCP-6439-1 is to remain the primary means of containment.",

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-6439 is to be handled in accordance with security measures typical for infohazards. Evidence of its existence should be sought out and quarantined, and amnestics administered as necessary.",
    "description": "SCP-6439 is a temporal anomaly taking the form of an extra 24-hour period per calendar year. The anomaly is accompanied by an amnestic effect; it can only be perceived under specific circumstances and through specific methods. Researchers assigned to SCP-6439 believe this amnestic effect is caused by SCP-6439-1 (consult the Addenda Materials for further information). As such, its existence has been rendered unknown to all but a very small number of people who have encountered evidence of it. This evidence is extremely rare and all of it is believed to be in Foundation hands, though other instances of SCP-6439 being perceptible are being actively sought out.",
