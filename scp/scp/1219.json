This chamber should be outfitted with overhead lighting controlled by an external switch.\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 SCP-1219 is housed at Storage Site-\u2588\u2588. Personnel entering the darkened containment area for testing purposes must refrain from vocal utterances unless otherwise instructed by research staff.\n\n\nDescription:\n The entity or event labeled SCP-1219 may manifest at any time within a sufficiently dark area of a suitable size (determined to be minimum 2m\n3\n; maximum unknown), provided at least one sentient being is present to witness the phenomenon. SCP-1219 manifests as a whistled version of the song \nCamptown Races\n which rises gradually and erratically in volume until audible to those present in the area. The entity or event will not manifest in the presence of an infrared camera or other low-light recording devices. No anomalous effects have been noted in relation to audio recordings of SCP-1219.\n\n\nOnce triggered, the whistled song lasts for an apparently unlimited duration, generally until light exposure occurs. However, the song will cease within 10-20 seconds if a witness or witnesses attempt to whistle, hum, sing, or otherwise engage with SCP-1219's tune, and the witness(es) will be dismembered (stripped primarily of organs related to vocalization) and severely flayed with marks similar to those inflicted by a bullwhip along the neck, back, and legs, resulting in immediate or delayed death in 100% of observed cases. SCP-1219's whistle does not appear to compel this engagement. Dismemberment and flaying occurs rapidly and cannot be prevented by the introduction of light to the containment chamber. No physical component to SCP-1219 has been recorded or identified.\n\n\nSCP-1219 has been found capable of instantaneous transfer within a distance of approximately 1km. If exposed to light, the entity or event will cease immediately and recur in the nearest suitable dark space inside its transfer range. If no such space is available, SCP-1219 appears to enter a passive state and will not recur unless and until an accessible area meets all criteria for manifestation.\n\n\nResearchers speculate that SCP-1219 may be permanently incapacitated via constant illumination of this 1km area. No termination attempts are scheduled at this time.\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition Log 1219-1:\n SCP-1219 was first documented on 08-16-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 St., an apartment complex in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588.
