Photo taken before Foundation acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n To maximize available space, persons interred within the grounds of SCP-6502 must be alive at the time of their burial. New interments must be approved by the lead researcher assigned to the project (currently Dr. Robert Campbell).\n\n\nCommunications and listening devices have been installed throughout the first several feet of SCP-6502\u2019s topsoil. Staff should maintain regular communication with interred subjects until such a time as subjects\u2019 physiology no longer allows for it. Subjects have proven more cooperative if informed that the Foundation is seeking a way to free them from SCP-6502, but is unable to do so at present; this story should be maintained by all staff when speaking to the interred.\n\n\nStandard measures are permitted to ensure the comfort of buried subjects. However, as long-term comfort is unlikely to be achieved, unreasonable expenses will be denied by the Office of Procurement.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6502 is Harwick Cemetery, located in Waverly Falls, MA. For unknown reasons, humans buried alive within the cemetery are unable to die. While subjects\u2019 bodies undergo the typical decomposition process, their mental faculties and higher intelligence remain intact even past the point of total bodily decay as long as they are interred.\n\n\nThis effect applies only to those buried alive: corpses buried in the cemetery show no further signs of life. Additionally, the anomaly only impacts those buried in traditional coffins and fully covered over with at least six feet of natural soil from the cemetery grounds. Attempts to construct subterranean facilities benefitting from SCP-6502\u2019s preservation effects have failed, as have attempts to preserve subjects via interment in above-ground mausoleums.\n\n\nSince 2009, the Foundation has used Harwick Cemetery as a medical facility for the preservation of high-value staff and prisoners. There are currently 46 individuals interred alive within the anomaly\u2019s grounds, including 31 former Foundation staff members, 9 members of other Groups of Interest, and 6 civilians found buried within the cemetery prior to Foundation acquisition.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation contained SCP-6502 after reports of unexplained sounds and vibrations drew an agent\u2019s attention in 1994. Multiple individuals affected by the anomaly were later discovered, the oldest of whom had been buried in a family plot since 18 April 1951. Further investigation found that an unlicensed coroner had been practicing in the nearby city of Waverly Falls since the early 1950s, resulting in several inadvertent live burials throughout the 20th century.\n\n\nAddendum: Sample case\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Ava Bradley, a Foundation memeticist and expert containment specialist, was stricken with a lethal infohazardous infection on 9 September 2018. As Dr. Bradley\u2019s death would break containment protocols for multiple high-risk objects, her body was interred within SCP-6502. Interactions between Foundation staff and Dr. Bradley, now designated SCP-6502-46, are logged below for educational purposes.\n\n\n\n\n9 Sept 2018, 19:31\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Campbell:\n Dr. Bradley?

Nothing but the water and the sky and the sand, on and on forever.\n\n\nSCP-6502-46:\n Once, on one of those trips, I swam out much deeper than I was supposed to go.

I snuggled up into his arms while he carried me back.\n\n\nSCP-6502-46:\n That night my mom made bulgogi and rice and the perfect fried eggs, with oyster sauce and fresh bok choy.
