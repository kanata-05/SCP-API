Containment Liaisons are in the process of devising long-term containment solutions for SCP-3280.\n\n\nShould SCP-3280 reach the entrance to Sub-Level 2, the Site will enter a security lockdown, making entrance and egress impossible. Do note that this will also activate Blackout-Protocol: ensuring that no hazardous or sensitive information is broadcast from the Site. This will be necessary to prevent a full containment breach and failure of Third Mission (Protect) goals.\n\n\nDescription:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course. Despite the repeated assurances that your security upgrade was in the process of being implemented, you're still Level 0, and thus, effectively worthless as far as Overwatch is concerned.\n\n\nThe file though.

It's wedged beneath him, but you're able to slide it out and detach it from the loop. Thankfully, Nichols was the type of person to scrawl their password on the underside of their clearance card, as you discover upon turning it over in your hands.\n\n\nYou approach the terminal with renewed vigor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO SCIPNET DATABASE\n\n\nSecurity Clearance Level 2 - Accepted\n\n\nAccess Security Footage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is definitely helpful.

They are to be equipped with a flashlight, as well as a security baton for self-defense. An ultra\nsonic transmitter is to be sewn into their clothing, which will broadcast a freq\nuency capable of drawing SCP-3280 to their location upon accessing the deepest area of the sub-level. This should \ndraw SCP-3280 away from the sub-level's entrance,\n to its preference for live prey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting harder to\u2026keep focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to contain SCP-3280 in this manner will result in the full lockdown of \nSite-5\n1\n the site. MTF Iota-12 (\"The Silencers\") and \nTau-4 \"Water, Water, Everywhere\"\n will be immediately dispatched to contain the threat. Should twelv\ne hours pass without Overwatch receiving an \"All Clear\" from these teams, all Sites are to enact emergen\ncy measures in preparation for an imm\ninent XK-scenario.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3280 is a sapient entity composed of a fluid physically identical to water, capable of travelling ~2.5\u00a0km/h. Non-anomalous wa\nter introduced to SCP-3280 will be incorporated into its mass, and remo\nved samples prove to operate identically. At the time of its discovery, the entity was approx. 66.4 liters in volume; it is currently estimated to be ~2500 liters.\n\n\nThe entity is hostile to human life. SCP-3280 will seek out humans within its vicinity, forcing its mass into open orifices. SCP-3280 is also readily absorbed through the pores. The affected experience symptoms such as loss of motor control, weakening of the micturition reflex, visual hallucinations, and abdominal pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost as if on cue, you feel a churning in your own stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-\n3280 dis\nplays claustrophobic behavior, \nviolently expelling itself from confined spaces or containers; such as vials or test subjects. SCP-3280 will constrict its mass, lashing out in pressurized bursts exceeding 255\u00a0MPa - rendering all attempts of physical containment or transportation impossible. Wh\nen not hunting living prey, SCP-3280 will attempt to exit the underground level it is currently contained within. \nThus far, SCP-3280 has been kept away from the sub-level's entrance. It is believed\n that if SCP-3280 learns that it is sealed within the sub-level, it could instigate a violent response from the entity, irrevocably breaking containment. SCP-3280's escape from the site proper would constitute an XK-cla\nss end of the world scen\nario, once it becomes incorporated into the planet's water cycle. Contingency measures include\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roiling in your stomach becomes unbearable. You recoil backwards, away from the monitor. You drunkenly stumble, struggling against the thing inside of you, out into the hallway. The storm outside rages. Torrents of raindrops spatter across the windows. You fall against the wall, face pressed against the cool glass.\n\n\nIt is only in those final seconds, as water wells up to your throat and expands, that you notice the raindrops streaking towards your face, in defiance of gravity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<<< When Day Breaks\n | After the Storm | \nFall Forever >>>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
