Site-75 is to have a chain link fence with razor wire installed around the perimeter. The area inside Site-75 is to be monitored using motion detectors and security cameras. Any signs of public intrusion or vandalism is to be reported immediately. Should SCP-1503 approach the fence within a proximity of 10m, the entirety of Site-75 will be reestablished and centered around SCP-1503 again.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1503 is a sapient entity made entirely out of stone located on the southern face of Mount Ungaran in Central Java, Indonesia. SCP-1503's appearance is vaguely humanoid in form and shows signs of weathering and moss/lichen growth on its surface. Upon further inspection, SCP-1503's left index finger is significantly \nworn\n when compared to its right index finger. Using time-lapse photography, it is determined that SCP-1503 is capable of moving at a maximum rate of 1m/yr.\n\n\nBased on SCP-1503's movement and direction, it is estimated to have moved a total of 656m from its original location. SCP-1503's original starting point can be traced to a cave of higher elevation. Inside the cave's interior, inscriptions written in ancient Br\u0101hm\u012b script are carved into the walls. Based on patterns of erosion within the interior, there is an estimated 200 to 300 years between each instance of writing. Most of the writing is illegible, but the five inscriptions that are decipherable are believed to be the most recent, dating between 100 BC and 1200 AD.\n\n\n\n\nArchival Document\nR-1503-2\n\n\nNote: Inscriptions are listed in order of approximate date.\n\n\n1\nst\n Translated Inscription\n\n\nToday when I was walking I [saw/sensed] a [land/rock] rise from the blue [sea/water].
