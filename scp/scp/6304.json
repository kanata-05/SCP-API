Questioning of personnel within Site-42 as well as thorough searches of database archives reveal that at no point has an SCP-6304 has ever been found or logged. Furthermore, no D-Class subject by the name of \"Jackson Iut\" has ever been attained by the Foundation.\n\n\nFurther investigation is currently underway. SCP-6304's file and any derivative documents thereof have been moved to the Supplemental Files Record, pending further classification.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n6304\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nneutralised\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\n{$disruption-class}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\n{$risk-class}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-3812\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The remains of SCP-6304 are to be kept in Site-42's morgue for further medical study. Should no additional anomalous characteristics be discovered, Class A Biohazardous Material Disposal Procedures are to be enacted.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Archived\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nArchived Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6304 is currently quarantined within Site-42's D-Class dormitory. All D-Class personnel are to be temporarily relocated to vacant humanoid containment cells until suitable housing replacements are made. Plans to reconstruct the dormitory into a standard anomaly containment cell are pending. Observational studies of SCP-6304 may be conducted with approval from Site Director Smith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6304 was a temporal anomaly that manifested within the presumably deceased body of D-3812\n1\n; while a clinical examination could not be conducted due to SCP-6304's previously intangible state, exposure to external stimuli had been met with no response. The body was located on the top bunker of the far-left wing of Site-42's dormitory and since discovery, had displayed no signs of movement. \nSCP-6304 constantly exhibits a green glow of approximately 6 lux.\n \n(See Addendum 6304-A)\n.\n\n\nRelocation of SCP-6304 could not be made as the body appeared to be completely intangible. Though SCP-6304 appeared to be able to rest atop D-3812's designated bunk bed, attempts at moving the bed revealed that SCP-6304 was simply hovering in place.\n\n\nSubjects within close proximity of SCP-6304 experienced a minor distortion in their perception of time, reporting slightly accelerated behavior from interactions for twenty-four hours after contact. Repeated contact halves the duration of this effect in half for each subsequent interaction. Although extended length of contact has led to a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, no other side-effects appear to manifest.\n\n\nSCP-6304 was discovered and reported by several D-Class personnel following a large commotion at Site-42's D-Class dormitories during the early morning hours of September 23, 2032. According to video surveillance footage and testimony from D-Class personnel, SCP-6304 had manifested on the bed previously belonging to D-3812. Following intervention by Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, D-Class personnel were evacuated and SCP-6304 was cataloged.\n\n\nDuring a regularly scheduled review of security tape footage, 63,082,981 video files dated for September 23, 2032 were discovered within system files, amounting to 24 hours of footage. Following review, the footage was found to possibly be a byproduct of SCP-6304 and was thus designated as SCP-6304-1. Those who appear in the footage claim to have no recollection of the events depicted and administration of retrograde Class X amnestics revealed no evidence of memory tampering. An edited transcript of the compiled footage has been recorded below; \nan uncut version is available upon request\n \n(See Addendum 6304-B)\n. It should be noted that with each recurring instance of SCP-6304-1, video and audio quality decreased by a significant margin, thus rendering a large majority of the videos unplayable.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Abridged\u00a0transcript\u00a0of\u00a0video\u00a0logs\u00a0#1-6\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG #1\n\n\n\n\nDATE: 09/23/2032\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n09:13:32\n \nD-3812 is seen conversing with several other D-Class personnel. Subject appears to be highly agitated.\n\n\n09:13:30 | D-3812:\n \"I'm telling you, I cleaned the restroom yesterday. Why the hell am I gonna have to do it again?\"\n\n\n09:13:39 | D-4991:\n \"If you cleaned it yesterday, then why is it still so dirty? You didn't do shit.\"\n\n\n09:13:46 | D-3812:\n \"The fuck, man? It was spotless. If it's dirty now it's cuz \nyou\n guys messed it all up.\"\n\n\n09:13:56 | D-4268:\n \"Even if you did clean it, you did it early. Bathroom cleanups are on Fridays, not Thursdays.\"\n\n\n09:14:02 | D-3812:\n \"What the fuck are you talking about? It's Saturday.\"\n\n\n09:14:07 | D-4991:\n \"Man, you're really losing your marbles, huh? He's right, it's Friday. So you still gotta clean, and this time, don't half-ass it.\"\n\n\n09:14:20 | D-3812:\n \"What? Guys, I swear I cleaned it. It was clean, and you guys even reminded me to do it yesterday. Is this some sort of stupid joke?\"\n\n\n09:14:37 | D-5343:\n \"Just suck it up. We know that restroom duty sucks, but someone's gotta do it and this week, it's your turn.\"\n\n\nD-3812 argues about his conflicting account for fifteen minutes before D-Class are gathered for the mandatory morning role call.\n\n\n\n\n11:58:40:\n \nD-3812 is seen talking with the on-site psychiatrist, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588, having been referred to by other D-Class personnel.\n\n\n11:58:48 | D-3812:\n \"I know how it sounds but I swear, my memory's amazing. Damn near photographic, has been for my entire life. And it wasn't some sort of weird hallucination or dream or nothing like that.\"\n\n\n11:58:59 | Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \"Interesting. Then I presume that you aren't experiencing any strange symptoms? Headaches, inexplicable fatigue, insomnia, anything like that?\"\n\n\n11:59:08 | D-3812:\n \"Nope. I'm totally fine.\"\n\n\n11:59:13:\n \nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588 nods and writes on a clipboard. Text is rendered illegible due to insufficient video quality.\n\n\n11:59:31 | Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \"Were you exposed to any anomalous objects recently? Your records show that you haven't been selected for testing in several weeks, but\u2026\"\n\n\n11:59:45 | D-3812:\n \"Nah, I've just been living day-to-day, you know? Kind of boring but at least I'm not in danger of dying every other afternoon.\"\n\n\n11:59:56 | Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \"Right.
