All basic life functions are supported through the stasis unit and maintained by the Research and Development Division.\n\n\nSCP-5607-1 is to be extracted via a catheter and stored within pressurized biologic storage tanks. The extracted SCP-5607-1 is given to Development Team 14 to be repurposed into Compound-5607/P.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5607 within its stasis unit.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5607 is theorized to be an extraplanetary humanoid entity originating from outside of the Sol System. Measuring 11\u00a0cm in height, SCP-5607 is bipedal, with elongated arms, and a large head relative to its body (approximately 4\u00a0cm in diameter). Similar in biological function to native Earth plants, SCP-5607 subsists off water, UV radiation, and carbon dioxide. Since its discovery, SCP-5607 remains in a self-induced comatose state, though all bodily functions are fully operational.\n\n\nSCP-5607 was discovered in 1976, during a Foundation-backed mission to the lunar surface. During surveying operations in the Montes Secchi range, astronauts discovered a disk-shaped vessel (designated SCP-5607-0). After SCP-5607 and its stasis container were removed from SCP-5607-0, a self-destruct sequence initiated leading to the destruction of the vessel in its entirety. The salvaged remains were declared unsuitable for experimentation and subsequently left at the point of discovery (2.65\u00b0N 42.97\u00b0E, Montes Secchi, Earth 1).\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5607-0 prior to its destruction.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5607-1 is the designation for urine created by SCP-5607 and is currently considered anomalous due to an unexplained biological reaction caused by its inhalation. During the examination of the spacesuit worn by SCP-5607, an unusual urine disposal method was discovered. Utilizing a catheter and an advanced vaporization unit, the suit redistributed vaporized SCP-5607-1 through the respiratory systems. Inhalation of SCP-5607-1 was subsequently tested on 28 different species, including humans. These tests concluded that SCP-5607-1 unilaterally causes a substantial increase in physical and mental dexterity, far beyond pre-exposure parameters. It is theorized that this facilitates the acuity needed for piloting the high-speed interstellar vessel used by SCP-5607.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5607 Project Proposal\n\n\n\n\nPISS Device.\n\n\n\n\nThe Research and Development Division has developed an inhalation device utilizing Compound-5607/P, an SCP-5607-1 derivative capable of a temporary and substantial increase in the effectiveness of Mobile Task Force agents. The device was designated the Personal Inhalant Service Stimulant, or PISS device. Testing concluded a ~175% increase in performance-related scoring in all participants.\n1\n The R&D division requests the use of a high-engagement Mobile Task Force in order to test the long-term use of the PISS Device.\n\n\nMTF Administration: \nApproved\n\n\nSite Director: \nApproved\n\n\nEthics Committee: \nApproved\n\n\nDr. Cooper Millgate and Development Team 14 are hereby granted a six-month trial for the operational use of PISS Devices utilizing MTF Epsilon-19, under the supervision of Captain Luke Wells. Further stipulations and requirements are available to applicable personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCP-5607\u00a0Project\u00a0Requests\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998/02/15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Flavoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Millgate, my men have been apprehensive about using your compound due to the taste, which has been described as \"sour cat piss flavored\". I was hoping your team could develop a more palatable flavoring for the PISS Devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Flavoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn understandable request, Captain Wells, next week's batch will have new flavoring. Will cherry be suitable for your men?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Re:Flavoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Millgate, cherry would work fine, the general consensus is for either cherry or grape. So whichever is easier on your end, thank you.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1998/02/28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Millgate, the new flavoring is satisfactory to say the least, mixed berry was an excellent middle ground. My men have begun using the devices during almost every engagement. This week alone we cleared 17 successful recovery missions. I would like to request an additional 12 units for our next delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am glad to hear the new flavor is to your men's liking, Captain. I am likewise pleased in the successful missions, though I would like to remind you that Compound-5607/P is for high-intensity situations and should not be overused. Additional devices will be included in your next shipment.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1998/03/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Empty canister return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Wells, while I am thrilled with our results over the past few weeks, I have an area of concern that needs to be addressed. As per the protocol laid out in our trial, \nall\n empty Compound-5607/P canisters must be returned upon delivery of the next shipment. The last two weeks you were short eight canisters.\n\n\nPlease make sure your men return the canisters once they've been depleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Empty canister return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Millgate, it has come to my attention that several of my men have been keeping the spent canisters to get the \"final bits\" during tight situations. Two other operatives threw away their canister by mistake. I will make sure this does not happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Re:Empty canister return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease do make sure this does not happen again, I would hate to jeopardize the program due to simple oversights. I will be sending additional canisters with your next shipment to ensure that saving spent canisters is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1998/04/02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n More PISS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to an incident I am unauthorized to disclose, my team will be taking on twice the number of assigned missions. In response, I would like to double the number of devices received in our next shipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:More PISS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain, we are incapable of producing that many devices at this time. At most I can include an additional 16 units, but any more would require additional funding and an expansion of current facilities. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1998/04/04\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI regret to inform you that our last shipment has been misplaced or thrown away by mistake. We received and signed for it yesterday, but it came during our resupply and must have gotten lost in the confusion. We are still scheduled to take on missions and would greatly appreciate another batch.

Please do be more careful in the future, we can not afford such losses.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1998/05/01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n The end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is with great displeasure that I must inform you that our trial has been ended prematurely. Due to the high cost/time expenditure required for the project and that my expertise is needed elsewhere, O5 has deemed the project inconclusive and will place the remaining compound on ice along with SCP-5607. I give you and your men my utmost gratitude for your assistance in this endeavor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nFrom:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:The end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find this to be unacceptable, we rely on those PISS's to get our job done. You must make an appeal. You're smart, you'll figure it out, there has to be a way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Captain Luke Wells\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Re:The end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I understand your situation and appreciate your confidence, there is simply nothing I can do. I've been ordered to move everything into storage this afternoon. By this time tomorrow, I'll be across the country working on another project. Medical staff will ensure your men are taken care of if there are any concerns. It's been a pleasure working with you Captain Wells, I wish you and your men the best of luck.\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RELAY 1998/05/01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Site Director | Dr. Richard Nylen\n\n\nCc:\n Site 51 Internal Security\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Cooper Millgate\n\n\nSubject:\n PLEASE HELP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know how they got in here, but Epsilon-19 is in my lab and is currently holding my staff hostage.
