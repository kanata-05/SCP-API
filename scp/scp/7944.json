SCP-7944 and the original box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-7944 is currently held in Secure Containment Locker 4 in Site 312\u2019s anomalous storage unit in Nieuwegein, Netherlands. Rubber or nitrile gloves are to be worn when handling SCP-7944 unless cleared for testing by Lead Researcher Van Oosterbeek or Site Director Dubois.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7944 is a 1940s-style attachable electric light, commonly used by the American military during the liberation of the Netherlands. SCP-7944 was preserved by its former owner in the original box, which includes a handwritten note on the side: \u201cA man is the shadow he casts on the world,\u201d followed by the letters \u201cAS.\u201d\n\n\nUnlike non-anomalous flashlights of the same make and model, SCP-7944 is capable of producing coloured light. When switched on, SCP-7944 will generate an orange light with no further anomalous effects. At undetermined intervals, the colour will shift, resulting in the shadow no longer matching the illuminated subject. Instead, it will show what appears to be symbolic representations or alternative statuses. Preliminary testing determined the following options: red, yellow, blue, purple, and green, as well as \u201cbaseline\u201d orange. Not every subject will trigger all colours.\n\n\nSCP-7944\u2019s battery compartment is not accessible, and penetrative scans have shown it is empty.\n\n\nThe correlation between the coloured light and its subsequent shadow, as well as SCP-7944\u2019s source of power, is subject to further examination.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 2020-02-17, Foundation monitoring towers registered an unusual spike in Hume levels at the Zuyderzonne Palliative Care Home in Arnhem, Netherlands, alerting the nearest site for possible Reality Altering Risks. Field Agent Jacob Banks was dispatched to investigate, and discovered SCP-7944 in the Home\u2019s lost and found.\n\n\nSCP-7944 was previously seen in the possession of Mr. Thomas Springs, a resident of Zuyderzonne\u2019s long-term housing wing for patients with Korsakoff syndrome.\n1\n Nursing staff reported that Mr. Springs had misplaced it several weeks prior to the discovery event, and had started questioning other residents about its whereabouts. These inquiries grew increasingly confrontational over the weeks, eventually leading to an altercation with a neighbour in which Mr. Springs came to a fall.\n\n\nStaff and residents had encountered the item\u2019s anomalous properties in the preceding months to its discovery but had rejected it as an optical illusion. No witness could recall the changing of colour.\n\n\nDue to Mr. Spring's medical condition, Agent Banks was unable to complete questioning him on SCP-7944's origins during the initial retrieval. A follow-up visit is scheduled on 2020-02-26.\n\n\nSite 312\u2019s Anomalous Technologies Specialist Harrit Swanepoel was assigned to SCP-7944 to determine the specific nature of its anomalous effects, power supply, and ontokinetic risks. See Addendum 7944/01 for the research hypothesis and an excerpt of tests performed.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7944/01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRESEARCHER NOTES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted on:\n\n\n2020-02-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproved on:\n\n\n2020-02-20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformed on:\n\n\n2020-02-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n Each colour shows a different \u201caspect\u201d of the item subjected to SCP-7944. These colours are not randomly assigned, but appear to have a predetermined connotation. The \u201corange\u201d colour functions as the baseline (or: \u201cpresent\u201d) aspect of the subject.\n\n\nPower is taken ontokinetically from the surroundings rather than an internal power source. Base readings show minor fluctuations in Hume levels if switched off. These base levels appear to increase slightly over time.\n\n\nResearch questions:\n\n1) What is the connotation between a specific colour and the displayed shadow?\n\n2) Is the specific source SCP-7944 draws power from traceable, predictable and/or manipulable?\n\n\nTest design:\n A set of 10 randomly chosen items from around Site 312 offices, with varying levels of \u201cuniqueness\u201d and emotional connotation. Each item will be subjected to SCP-7944\u2019s effects 3 times in the same location to rule out variations in Hume levels and visuals displayed.\n\n\nBelow are a selection of test results to illustrate SCP-7944\u2019s effects. See Document 7944/HS-T110 for full documentation and accompanying video.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTEST 1\n\n\n\n\nItem description:\n a randomly chosen mug from the kitchenette, unused.

Before the second repeat could be performed, Mx. Swanepoel was asked to perform minor IT adjacent duties in another office. During their absence, Agent Claessen entered the office to retrieve a file and accidentally brushed against the vase, almost tipping it over. He steadied it and put it slightly further to the left, unbeknownst to Researcher Swanepoel.\n\nWhen Mx.

This, in addition to the changes in the test result, lead to the hypothesis that the person interacting with SCP-7944 and/or its subject affects the resulting anomalous display.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDue to the above outcome, the subject of test 10 was changed without review or approval.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTEST 10\n\n\n\n\nItem description:\n Mx.

Translation attempts didn't result in a coherent text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\n A notable spike in Hume levels was registered during this test. No repeat test was performed, and Mx. Swanepoel was reprimanded for using themselves as test subject before clearing it with senior administration.\n\n\nMedical review showed no neurological effects and no changes in Mx. Swanepoel\u2019s personal Hume field.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAfter review of test results, a hypothesized key for the connection between colour and change of shadow was created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2. Proposed key for SCP-7944's colour changes. Excerpt taken from document 7944/HS-T110.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPower supply appears to be guided by the individual interacting with SCP-7944, reflecting back on the displayed imagery. The default Hume interference is not fully understood as of yet.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTo confirm this key, as well as attempting to further pinpoint the Hume level irregularities, additional testing was requested. The possibility of objective versus subjective shadow display was discussed in the context of SCP-7944's possible use during questioning. To investigate the viability of this application, a test with a live subject was requested.\n\n\nSince Site 312 does not have access to D-Class personnel and no medical effects from SCP-7944 exposure were registered, Lead Researcher Van Oosterbeek volunteered as test subject.\n\n\nDue to Researcher Swanepoel\u2019s earlier unsanctioned actions, Specialist Sterre de Veer was assigned to this project as co-lead. Ms. De Veer was in charge of test design and questioning while Mx. Swanepoel\u2019s duties were limited to technical setup, data collection and review.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7944/02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2020-02-24\n\n\nINTERVIEWERS:\n\nSpecialist Sterre de Veer, Site 312\n\nResearcher Harrit Swanepoel, Site 312\n\n\nINTERVIEWEE:\n\nLead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek, Site 312\n\n\nNOTE:\n This file was translated from Dutch to English using the SwanTran4.9 Translation and Transcription Tool. Original language file available upon request.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[The camera turns on. In frame is Lead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek, sitting on a chair with his hands resting on his legs. To the right is the SCP-7944 object, placed on a tripod and surrounded by monitoring equipment. Mx. Harrit Swanepoel is standing next to it, then steps out of frame. Ms. Sterre de Veer is standing on the left, holding a set of notecards with highlighted questions.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Camera is running. Are you ready, sir?\n\n\nGIJS:\n About as ready as you can be for an interview under a bright spotlight. \n[Sigh]\n What do you want me to talk about?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n We have a set of predetermined topics to see if we can direct the changing of the light based on the conversation. We\u2019re also trying to determine the exact nature of the green and purple colour, since they appear to be quite close but not interchangeable. So these questions are designed to draw out more symbolic responses.\n\n\n[Gijs nods. He twists his wedding ring around his finger.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n If any of these questions make you uncomfortable, or you prefer not to answer, please say so and we\u2019ll change the subject. This is by no means an interrogation.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n Ready?\n\n\n[He nods again. Harrit, wearing a nitrile glove, switches SCP-7944 on. Researcher Van Oosterbeek is cast in an orange light, resulting in a matching shadow on the wall behind him.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Could you please state your name and position within the Foundation?\n\n\nGIJS:\n Right. My name is Gijs van Oosterbeek and I\u2019m Site 312\u2019s Lead Researcher.\n\n\n[The light quickly blinks to green, showing the outline of a goose aggressively flapping its wings and apparently hissing. Harrit chuckles, and Sterre signals them to stay quiet.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 3. Still taken from camera feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Could you tell us a little bit about your work here? What is your field of expertise?\n\n\nGIJS:\n Officially, I specialise in bureaucratohazards and containment through regulation.\n\n\n[The colour changes to purple, and the shadow shows a large pile of documents and binders with a gavel on top. It then switches to green, depicting a cockroach walking in circles through a labyrinth. Van Oosterbeek pauses for a moment, eying the changed light before continuing.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n But in practise, I spend most of my time as head of the Department of Relations and Regulations. Filling out forms, requesting grants, setting up collaboration with organisations on both sides of the Veil. All to fill the holes left in our finances due to our \"challenging\" budget. You know, the \nreal exciting\n stuff.\n\n\n[He gestures for emphasis, which isn't replicated by the shadow. It turns blue and shows a collage of forms, diagrams and underlined fine print. Clearly visible are the FITP-998/31 and \nEXC-819-A4/02b\n forms.\n6\n]\n\n\nGIJS:\n When I do get to do research, it\u2019s usually part of an investigation. Interviews in the field and data collection, since I\u2019m currently the only qualified Field Researcher \u2014 although we\u2019re in the process of changing that, aren\u2019t we?\n\n\n[He winks at Sterre. The light switches to purple, and shows his shadow handing a magnifier glass to a silhouette that looks like her.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n God, this is nerve-wrecking. Resisting the urge to look is harder than I thought.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n You\u2019re doing great, sir.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n No dark secrets or repressed thoughts yet.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Haven\u2019t had those since I came out of the closet, anyway.\n\n\n[The light momentarily switches to orange before turning purple. The shadow still resembles Van Oosterbeek, except he\u2019s now holding a glass of wine. In the backdrop is the phrase \u201cNormal is like, totally crazy enough.\u201d in a loopy font. Harrit starts laughing.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4. Still taken from camera feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIJS:\n Did I jinx it?\n\n\nHARRIT:\n I think the SCP just called you basic.\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Laughing]\n You don\u2019t need anything anomalous to figure that out.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Let\u2019s go back to the pre-established questions. Could you tell us a little bit about your career before you joined the Foundation?\n\n\n[The light turns red, and the shadows show an outline of Van Oosterbeek with more hair, standing behind a podium with a microphone. It then turns green and depicts a voting ballot with a checked box.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n Sure. Would you believe I used to be a politician? That\u2019s where I ran into the Foundation: I tried to reform a convoluted law that turned out to be convoluted on purpose.\n\n\n[The shadow shifts to a marijuana leaf.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n And is that when you\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 5. Still taken from camera feed, mid-transition between shadow displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[There is a knock on the door. It opens before anyone can answer, and Agent Jacob Banks briefly steps into view of the camera, then steps back. The light switches back to orange.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, I\u2013 we just received a follow-up from the medical lab.\n\n\nGIJS:\n You\u2019re not going to tell me there is a medical effect after all, just as we\u2019re experimenting on me?\n\n\nJACOB:\n Nothing like that. \n[Clears throat]\n No, it's forensics, they -\u2013 there are -\u2013 it appears there is a\u2013\n\n\nGIJS:\n Spit it out, kiddo.\n\n\nJACOB:\n They found a genetic match. For you. For one of the residents, and you.\n\n\n[Van Oosterbeek freezes up for a moment. He frowns, then gets up and walks off-screen. His shadow doesn\u2019t move. The rustling of papers is heard.]\n\n\n[The light suddenly turns blue, displaying two strings of DNA. They split apart, and half of each combines into a new string of DNA.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Off-screen]\n T-they\u2019re sure?\n\n\n[The light starts to flash in quick succession. Red: an adult woman with a one-year-old child standing on her shoes, taking steps together. Blue: the name \"Arthur\", followed by a question mark. Green: a razorblade and a tie being tied.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Yeah, positive.\n\n\n[Yellow: Van Oosterbeek pacing back and forth. Red: a man and woman holding hands, with a Ferris wheel and pier in the background. Purple: the silhouette of a man with a question mark as his head. Yellow: the chair thrown across the room.

Swanepoel has been aggressively pressing the on-switch on SCP-7944 during the interruption, to no effect. The light switches to green, showing a burning fire being put out by rain, until everything is swept away.]\n\n\nHARRIT:\n I\u2019m trying! It\u2019s not letting me! The Hume readings are off the chart as well.\n\n\n[Sterre turns to the camera and redirects it to the ceiling.

I am literally watching the words appear on the screen, it\u2019s riveting.\n\n\n[Jacob turns around in his seat.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n We\u2019ve been using this equipment for every field investigation I\u2019ve been part of. It all works.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n I just don\u2019t want any surprises. It\u2019s the first time out for the new portable Kant counter.\n\n\nJACOB:\n And the new Field Researcher. \n[He makes a dramatic sound effect]\n Away from the safe confines of labs and offices, and out in the big bad world. Will she be ready for the real work to begin? This February, Specialist De Veer will embark on a quest of a lifetime.\n\n\n[Sterre adjusts the camera on her blouse, ignoring him. She takes out a stack of notecards and starts reviewing them.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Alright, first thing you need to know about field work: disregard all of those questions and pick three topics to focus on. Then\u2013\n\n\nGIJS:\n How about you let me do the mentoring, kiddo. You can focus on fixing your tie.\n\n\n[Jacob turns back around, looking down at his tie.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n I\u2019m just telling her what you taught me. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the standard procedures and generalised questions in a non-sterile environment.\u201d\n\n\nGIJS:\n Yeah, because \nyou\n tend to underprepare and hold onto those basics as a last resort. You\u2019re better when you follow your gut.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Flailing upwards.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Can you save the snark for your internet friends, Harrit?\n\n\n[The car passes a sign reading \u201cZuyderzonne Tehuis; Palliative Care Home\u201d. They turns up the driveway and park the car. Jacob gets out to help Sterre lift the suitcase that contains the Kant counter from the backseat.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Quietly]\n What\u2019s wrong with my tie?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n It\u2019s hanging too high on your torso.\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Groan]\n Harrit messed up my knot during testing.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Your knot? Can\u2019t you just retie it? \n[Pause]\n You can\u2019t, can you?\n\n\nJACOB:\n I usually just ask Gijs to tie them for me, and loosen the knot when I get home.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n For\u2026 \nevery single one of your ties\n?\n\n\nGIJS:\n For god's sake, Jacob. I got you that one for Christmas, have you been doing it for two whole months?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 6. Still taken from Agent Jacob Banks' camera feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Gijs sighs and takes the tie with trombones from Jacob. The camera feed turns to the Kant counter, which Sterre is double-checking.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n It worked until now.\n\n\nGIJS:\n At least I don\u2019t have to tell you to shave, now that you dumped the soul patch.\n\n\nJACOB:\n I was pulling that off.\n\n\nGIJS:\n That\u2019s what I like about you Americans: believing in dreams to the point of self-deception.\n\n\n[Sterre hides a chuckle by burying herself behind her notecards.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Quietly]\n I\u2013 uh -\u2013 I wanted to say sorry for springing the news on you on camera.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Don\u2019t worry, kiddo. There isn\u2019t really an etiquette for telling your boss \u201cI accidentally found your long-lost father and he might be magic,\u201d is there?\n\n\nJACOB:\n That\u2019s fair.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Besides, SwanTran records just about everything we do, cameras or no.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n That includes you rapping your field reports, Lin-Manuel.\n\n\nJACOB:\n It\u2019s not rapping, it\u2019s actually a slam poetry technique I use to order my thoughts. Picked it up when I was really into improv in college and\u2013\n\n\nGIJS:\n Nobody\u2019s surprised. \n[Some muffled sounds coming from Jacob\u2019s microphone.]\n There you go, Full Windsor. Remind me to show you how to do this yourself later.\n\n\nJACOB:\n Thanks, pops.\n\n\n[Jacob gives a joke-salute and walks over to the reception. Gijs and Sterre sit down in the waiting room.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n You ready?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n I think so, just a little nervous. How are you, sir?\n\n\nGIJS:\n Me? Fine, fine. Dealt with this stuff years ago. I\u2019m just here to observe you two at work. [He winks] Wouldn\u2019t want to miss your first field case.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n I\u2019ll do my best, sir.\n\n\nGIJS:\n I know, which is why you won't be needing those cards.\n\n\n[He holds out his hand. Sterre hesitates, holding her notecards with both hands.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n Come on, you prepared well. You don't need those.\n\n\n[Sterre takes a deep breath, looking one last time at her handwritten notes. She then reluctantly hands them over to Van Oosterbeek.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n You\u2019re going to be fine, love. You got this.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n I hope so.\n\n\n[Gijs places a hand on her shoulder and squeezes. She takes a deep breath, tightly gripping the handle of the portable Kant counter. A moment later, Jacob waves them to follow him, handing each of them a badge when they catch up.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n He's in the west wing, room 2.31. We\u2019ll find it easily by following the red route. Cover story is nice and simple: we're grad students doing some preliminary interviews with Korsakoff patients for our thesis. No need to go into detail on the topic.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n What about Mr. Springs?\n\n\nJACOB:\n You tell him whatever is necessary. It's not like he'll remember an hour later.\n\n\n[His eyes widen and he turns to Gijs.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n I'm sorry, that didn't sound the way it did in my head.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Just like your rapping.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Harrit, zip it. We don't need a peanut gallery. \n[To Jacob]\n It's fine, you're right. Natural amnestic treatment.\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Cheerily]\n Exactly!\n\n\n[They scan their badges and an automated door opens, leading to a crossroad. The floor is covered in coloured linoleum: blue on the right, yellow straight forward, and red on the left. A board hangs from the ceiling, with arrows in matching colours pointing in each direction, as well as the words \u201cdaily activities,\u201d \u201ctreatment and therapy,\u201d and \u201cliving quarters,\u201d respectfully.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n I like how they took their time decorating. Gives it a little more of a friendly feel.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n This kind of colour use helps people with cognitive disabilities like Alzheimer's and Korsakoff to find their way on their own. It lets them build more independence through routine.\n\n\nJACOB:\n Huh, clever.\n\n\n[They continue down the hallway, eventually arriving at room 2.31. The name \"Thomas Springs\" is posted under the number. Jacob gives Sterre a head nod, then opens the door.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Quietly, to Sterre]\n Just follow my lead.\n\n\n[They enter a small but cozy, personalised living room with a bed next to the window, and an adjacent bathroom. Mr. Springs is sitting in a chair next to his desk, carefully cutting the leaves of his bonsai tree. A large pachira tree stands in the corner, and several grass plants and cacti are standing or hanging from shelves. Sterre's camera feed passes the window in the door, showing Gijs talking to a nurse in the hallway. The view lingers on a whiteboard placed next to the door, where several pictures of nursing staff are displayed with their title and name.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 7. Still taken from Specialst De Veer's camera feed.\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACOB:\n Morning, Thomas. How are we feeling today?\n\n\n[Mr. Springs turns around and quickly glances at the badge on Jacob's jacket.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Morning, Dr. Banks. I'm good. Just finished watering the plants.\n\n\n[Jacob nudges Sterre forward. She drags the Kant counter closer and connects two wired sensors, placing the first one carefully on the desk.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Would you mind if I attach this, Thomas? I\u2019d like to take your vitals.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n You certainly can, dear. Although I\u2019m fine, you're all making such a fuss. It's just a little bonk on the crown, and I got a dense head. You should've seen the other guys.\n\n\n[Sterre extends the second sensor, attaching it to Mr. Springs' left index finger. He looks at it with interest.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Guys? There was more than one?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Yeah. There were three of them, all built like mountains. Got me right in the back when I stepped outside.\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Frowning]\n Really?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n \n[To Sterre]\n I might not look like it, but I can pack a punch. Though I gotta be honest: they got the better of me.\n\n\n[Jacob is looking around the room. There are yellow post-it notes everywhere, with little to-do lists on them. \"Wear striped sweater and jeans; take morning walk (crossed out); water plants (crossed out); 11:00 physical therapy; 14:30 buy groceries.\" is written on one next to the landline phone.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n And all because we're no longer allowed to smoke in the pub.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Hume field is within acceptable parameters. I\u2019m taking a baseline reading, keep him talking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 8. Still from Agent Banks' camera feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACOB:\n You know what I\u2019d call that? Governmental overreach.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Damn right. \n[Shakes head]\n Those civil servants need something to worry about, or they\u2019ll remember to do their job.\n\n\n[Jacob\u2019s feed is lingering on a set of photographs.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Has anyone ever told you that you have a lovely aura, Dr. De Veer?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n \n[While monitoring the Kant counter]\n I can honestly say that\u2019s a new one, sir. What does it look like?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Deep, calming indigo, like an endless starry sky on a warm spring night.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Mm, minor spike detected. Could be a flub, since I'm also getting some weird feedback. Can you reproduce it, Joker?\n\n\nJACOB:\n You can\u2019t leave me hanging after that. What does mine look like?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Loud.\n\n\n[Harrit is heard snickering through the earpiece.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n And red. Like an alarm going off, or fireworks. Maybe an eagle screeching. You\u2019re an American?\n\n\n[Jacob's feed turns to a bin with discarded post-it notes: red ones with \u2018Monday\u2019 written on top and blue ones with \u2018Sunday\u2019, both filled with crossed-out to-do lists.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n My accent already gave me away, so you\u2019ll have to try harder to impress me.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Don\u2019t have to, but I can.\n\n\n[He grabs a pack of playing cards and shuffles them, holding up three cards he can\u2019t see himself: 10 of diamonds, ace of spades, and a joker.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Pick a card. Left, middle, right.\n\n\nJACOB:\n Middle.\n\n\n[He shuffles them again, then points at Sterre.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Look at your badge, doctor.\n\n\n[Sterre looks down. A playing card is pinned on top of her nametag. She takes it off and holds it up in front of her camera: a queen of hearts.]\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n That\u2019s disappointing. Also: no new spikes, seems like a normal sleight of hand.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Because you\u2019re a queen that just stole my heart. \n[To Jacob]\n Your card is in your pocket.\n\n\n[Jacob feels in his pocket and takes out a playing card, holding it up to the feed. It is the ace of spades.]\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Little blip there. Seems like our magician is cheating.\n\n\n[Sterre turns to Jacob, then starts laughing and points to his badge. The camera feed shows a playing card in front of the visitor pass.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 9. Still taken from Agent Banks camera feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Cheerily]\n That sums me up, alright. Good one.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Wait until I get my lamp back from the police. I\u2019ll be able to show you your deepest, darkest secrets.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Your lamp?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n My magic lamp. Those \nschoffies\n8\n must\u2019ve taken it when I got knocked out. Got it from my dad, a real family heirloom. It\u2019ll reveal your true nature, in all its fragmented glory. \n[Sigh]\n I hope they get it back soon.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Where did he get it?\n\n\n[Thomas has taken out an old coin and starts flipping it between his fingers.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n By fighting in the American army to free the Western Front. After the war he decided to stay, fall in love, build a family. You know how it goes. \n[He flips the coin into the air, then grabs it]\n He was done with the harshness and horrors of humanity, so he turned to performance. Light up the world with magic.\n\n\n[He flips over his hands, suddenly holding a bouquet of flowers, which he hands to Sterre with a wink. Jacob\u2019s feed now shows the vase on his nightstand to be empty.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Anything to brighten the day.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n That was a spike. Biggest one we've got yet. Interference seems to be getting loopy, too. \n[Pause]\n I'm going to run some additional analysis. Got my readings, you can disconnect our magic man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 10. Flowers given to Specialist De Veer and returned to Site 312.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Sterre takes the flowers and thanks Mr. Springs. She starts removing the sensors.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Thank you for your time, Thomas. I hope they find your lamp soon.\n\n\n[Thomas gives a polite nod, then turns back to his bonsai. The two leave the room, carefully closing the door, and look down the hallway.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Where did the gooseman waddle off to?\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Went for a walk, he\u2019ll be back soon. Give me a sec, I want to check something.\n\n\nJACOB:\n That was odd, being lied to with a straight face.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n He wasn\u2019t lying. Confabulation and interference are symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome, resulting from processing errors in the brain. He\u2019s conflating earlier memories or distorting events, but he believes them to be accurate. At some point in his life, he was probably mugged after leaving a pub.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n See, I wasn\u2019t seeing things. I just rewound the feed: the flowers on his nightstand were tulips.\n\n\nJACOB:\n That confirms he\u2019s ontokinetically gifted.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Less than what we\u2019d call a Level 1 Reality Bender, according to the analysis.\n\n\nJACOB:\n So he's just supplementing his normal skills with it. Like instinct.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n You think the lamp might\u2019ve rubbed off on him, after decades of use?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Maybe, or maybe it just enhanced what was already there.\n\n\nJACOB:\n A missing component, in a way. \n[He scratches his chin]\n What do you say, Mx. Robot? Any change of there being co-dependency?\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n Mm, could be. That could fit with the interference I keep getting. Let me run some simulations.\n\n\nJACOB:\n Don't you already live in one?\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n \nI wish\n. \n[A pause, some typing is heard]\n Gijs is in the hospital garden, by the way.\n\n\n[INTERRUPT]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat with\n\n\nUntitled Gooseman [GIJS]\n\n\nbricked nick\nname\n[HARRIT]\n opened the chat\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 LOADING MESSAGE HISTORY \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled Gooseman [GIJS]:\n\n\ninto water.

Van Oosterbeek is sitting on a bench, staring at his phone. His eyes are red.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n Dani\u00ebl called, so I had to take it.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Of course, sir.\n\n\n[Jacob sits down next to Gijs, unbuttoning his jacket and placing a hand on his shoulder.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Fathers, amirite? Can\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t live without \u2013- well, you can. I guess you can.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n \n[Scolding] Jacob.\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Faintly smiling]\n I could, yeah. Done so all my life, and I think I managed pretty well. I\u2019ve gone through the whole rigamarole: anger, mourning, accepting that I\u2019d never know who he was or why he let my mother rot. But seeing him sit there, it just kinda hit me.\n\n\n[He closes his eyes, leaning the back of his head against the wall.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n I thought about it. What it would be like, meeting him. Four fucking decades I imagined what he would be like, what we would talk about, what his reasons could\u2019ve been.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n It\u2019s a little different to mourn the father he is, not just the one he isn\u2019t.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Yeah. \n[He wipes his eyes]\n I guess there was a moment where I thought: \u201cwell, better late than never,\u201d but that ship has sailed. \nUnable to make new memories\n, the nurse said. Can't even remember the name of the people he sees every damn day.\n\n\n[Sterre places a hand on his lower arm. He places a hand on top of it.]\n\n\nSTERRE:\n He still remembers who he was. Korsakoff isn\u2019t regressive once under treatment.\n\n\nGIJS:\n You think I should talk to him?\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Do you think it might give you closure?\n\n\n[Gijs shrugs and shakes his head.]\n\n\nJACOB:\n Worst case scenario, he forgets everything you said the moment you walk out.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Leave him like he left us. Hah, it would serve him right.\n\n\nJACOB:\n And you can do it as many times as you want!\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Jacob!\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Laughing]\n You're pettier than me, kiddo. \n[He takes a deep breath]\n How did it go?\n\n\nJACOB:\n Harrit got some strange readings. Loopy shit.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n Minor ontokinetic interference, but it's not as straightforward as you'd expect from an unintentional Reality Bender. So now we're thinking the SCP-7944 object and Mr. Springs are connected, in a way.\n\n\nJACOB:\n Two parts of the anomaly. We were discussing having them interact.\n\n\nGIJS:\n We could see what happens if we bring them together in the same room. \n[He tabs his briefcase]\n Maybe some additional emotional upset to trigger an outburst.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n You mean you are going to talk to him?\n\n\n[Gijs gets up and straightens his back.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n We drove all the way here, might as well finish the job.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7944/04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2020-02-26\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n\nLead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek, Site 312\n\n\nINTERVIEWEE:\n\nMr. Thomas Springs, former owner of SCP-7944\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SUPPORT:\n\nField Agent Jacob Banks, Site 312\n\nSpecialist Sterre de Veer, Site 312\n\nResearcher Harrit Swanepoel, Site 312\n\n\nNOTE:\n This file was translated from Dutch to English using the SwanTran4.9 Translation and Transcription Tool.

He\u2019s standing in his kitchenette, making a cheese sandwich. Gijs no longer has his earpiece in, but is still wearing a microphone. He's sitting on a chair next to the kitchen table, the Kant counter placed beside him. There is one sensor wire going into Gijs' briefcase, attached to SCP-7944, and another is set up on a nearby dresser. Jacob and Sterre are standing close to the door.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n I rarely get visitors, let alone visitors for lunch. You sure you don\u2019t want anything?\n\n\nGIJS:\n I\u2019m good. Not hungry.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Your kids don\u2019t want to join us?\n\n\nGIJS:\n They\u2019re not my kids. I work with them. They\u2019re my team.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n A whole team, huh? At least you're taking mugging seriously this time.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n We could leave, sir.\n\n\nGIJS:\n It\u2019s fine. Are we good to go?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n When I reported the theft of my lamp, the officer just tried to downplay it. This country is going down the drain.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece, simultaneously with Mr. Springs]\n Readings are clear, no activity in SCP-7944. More weird interference, but nothing to shatter or even dent reality. Tell him I'm ready.\n\n\n[Jacob gives him a thumbs up]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 11.

He looks at the badge on Gijs\u2019 shirt.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n \u201cVan Oosterbeek.\u201d I used to know someone by that name a long, long time ago. Lovely girl.\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Coldly]\n I\u2019m aware.\n\n\n[Thomas stops chewing. He looks the man opposite of him.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n You\u2019re Sjaan\u2019s kid.\n\n\nGIJS:\n You knew about me?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n \n[After a pause]\n Yeah. She wrote a letter telling me she was pregnant. Sent it to Arthur Springs. My father. That\u2019s the name I\u2019d given her.\n\n\n[Gijs doesn\u2019t say anything. Thomas puts the plate down on his desk.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n You have her eyes.\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n And her decency.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n \n[Scolding]\n No peanut gallerying!\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n It was just a summer fling. One summer of love in Scheveningen. I wasn\u2019t ready to be a father.\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Raised voice]\n She wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother, but fuck knows nobody cared about that.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n You were better off without me in your life.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Clearly, but I would have liked a say in that.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n How is Sjaan?\n\n\nGIJS:\n Dead.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Oh.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Cancer, seven years ago.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n My condolences.\n\n\nGIJS:\n \nTief op.\n11\n\n\n[Several moments of silence. Thomas Springs has folded his hands together and is staring at his half-eaten lunch.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n How did you find me?\n\n\nGIJS:\n \n[Sarcastically]\n Magic.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Really? Like, Tarot cards?\n\n\nGIJS:\n No, it was just dumb luck. I didn't go out looking for you, if that's what you're asking.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Oh. \n[Pause]\n You\u2019re married?\n\n\n[Gijs looks down at his hands. He has been twisting his wedding ring around his finger.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n I\u2019d love to meet her someday.\n\n\nGIJS:\n Him.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Oh. I mean, all kinds of stuff is possible these days.\n\n\n[Another pause. Thomas rubs the back of his neck, looking around himself to avoid Gijs\u2019 staring. After several seconds, Gijs breaks the silence.]\n\n\nGIJS:\n That\u2019s it, then?\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n \n[Softly]\n I don't know, what do you want me to say? I mean\u2013\n\n\nGIJS:\n Why didn't you look for me, if you knew about me? Why did you pretend I didn't exist?\n\n\n[Thomas looks at the floor and shrugs. Gijs curses under his breath. After several seconds of silence, Thomas clears his throat.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n Look, I know I\u2019m a piece of shit. I fucked you and Sjaan over. \n[He tabs against the side of his head]\n I\u2019ve got quite a resum\u00e9 of fuckups, and now I\u2019m out of second chances.\n\n\n[Thomas stands up, walking over a dresser covered by cacti and succulents. Clear on display is the photo portrait of an army officer, presumably taken somewhere in the 1940s.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n That\u2019s Arthur, your grandfather. He came here after D-Day, found love and never left. \n[Pause]\n Sometimes I wish he had.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 12. Portrait of Arthur Springs, on display on Mr. Springs' dresser. Still taken from Agent Banks' camera feed (zoomed in).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACOB:\n \n[Mumbling]\n \u201cA man is the shadow he casts on the world \u2013 Arthur Springs.\u201d\n\n\nGIJS:\n So that\u2019s the excuse.\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n It isn\u2019t. I don't have any. I just\u2013\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n I\u2019m getting a massive read. Did you turn on the flashlight?\n\n\nJACOB:\n No, we didn\u2019t.\n\n\n[The feed shows light coming from Gijs' briefcase. It is flashing in all colours, one after the other. Thomas turns around, his eyes widening.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n My lamp!\n\n\n[The colours start to flow together. The light is turning bright, piercing white.]\n\n\nHARRIT:\n \n[Through earpiece]\n It\u2019s stabilising. The loop is resolving. No spikes, no weird feedback, none. Did it turn off?\n\n\nJACOB:\n No, it\u2019s still on.\n\n\nSTERRE:\n I think it's neutralising itself.\n\n\n[Gijs looks over. Jacob mimics a flat line, then throws his hands in confusion. The light grows brighter as Gijs opens his briefcase, taking out the box. Thomas takes it, walking back to the seating area and carefully placing the box to the desk. He opens it, taking out the flashlight.]\n\n\n[His eyes tear up. He holds the light in his hand, then looks at his son. Behind Gijs is an endlessly complex series of shadows dancing on the walls, morphing into each other. A woman walking with one-year-old child standing on her shoes, taking steps together. A boy cycling. Two fish swimming in circles. Two teens walking a dog. The Eiffel tower. A small tree growing taller and thicker. A multi-tiered cake with a topper of two men holding hands. Two people dancing a waltz. A knight swinging a sword.]\n\n\nTHOMAS:\n \n[Softly]\n I'm sorry I missed all of it.\n\n\n[A goose spreading its wings, with several little chicks seeking shelter under it. An outline of Harrit enthusiastically showing off a device. A castle with a wall being build up, brick by brick. Gijs placing a hand on Jacob's shoulder, who answers with an embrace. A river, its water thrashing against the banks. An outline of Sterre surrounded by books, with Gijs holding her notecards, practising with her. Eight differently shaped glasses, raised in a toast.]\n\n\n[A man standing next to a cradle, gently swinging it. A mobile hangs above it, with a flower, a tie and a swan dangling from it. The castle stands in a storm, the water rising but held off by the wall. A vast sky with endless stars, 1s and 0s, and trombones twirling around in patterns reminiscent of a kaleidoscope.]\n\n\n[Behind Thomas, no shadow is cast.]\n\n\n[He places the lamp on the table, steps forward and wraps his arms around Gijs. Thomas is sobbing loudly, his shoulders shaking with every exhale. Gijs lets him, but doesn't reciprocate. Eventually, he pats Thomas curtly on the back.]\n\n\n[For a brief moment, a tiny blink of a shape can be made out in Thomas\u2019 nothingness. The lamp turns off.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n An update in Special Containment Procedures is pending.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUpdate available\n\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7944\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nvlam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ncaution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigned Site\n\n\nSite Director\n\n\nResearch Lead\n\n\nCase Lead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite 312\n\n\nAnna Dubois\n\n\nGijs van Oosterbeek\n\n\nGijs van Oosterbeek\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1. SCP-7944-A and the original box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-7944-A is currently held in Secure Containment Locker 4 in Site 312's anomalous storage unit in Nieuwegein, Netherlands. Rubber or nitrile gloves are to be worn when handling SCP-7944, unless cleared for testing by Lead Researcher Van Oosterbeek or Site Director Dubois.\n\n\nSCP-7944-B resides in a monitored room at the Zuyderzonne Care Home in Arnhem, Netherlands, and poses no individual risk to normalcy outside protocol 7944/LIGHTUP, which is to be carried out once per month for stabilisation of SCP-7944-A.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7944 consists of two components. SCP-7944-A is a 1940s style attachable electric light, commonly used by the American military during the liberation of the Netherlands. It is preserved in the original box, which contains a handwritten note on the side: \u201cA man is the shadow he casts on the world\u201d, followed by the initials \u201cAS.\u201d\n12\n This note was added by Mr. Thomas Springs, hereafter referred to as SCP-7944-B, who has an ontokinetic connection to SCP-7944-A.\n\n\nSCP-7944-A is capable of producing light that shows symbolic or asynchronous representations of the illuminated subject. If both components of SCP-7944 are apart for more than 19 days, SCP-7944-A with start to fragment into a coloured spectrum and generate rising levels of ontokinetic feedback.\n\n\nProtocol 7944/LIGHTUP was designed to temporary stabilise SCP-7944-A fragmentation by reuniting it with SCP-7944-B on a monthly basis.\n\n\nCurrently, Lead Researcher Van Oosterbeek is assigned this task under the cover of a family visit.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.
