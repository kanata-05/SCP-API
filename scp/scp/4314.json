It\u2019s infinite. So why are we so obsessed with calculating it? There\u2019s nothing to calculate. It just goes on forever without any kind of pattern. Even when 4314-A starts talking there\u2019s still no pattern, no end. But loads of mathematicians still keep running it through any supercomputer they can find, just to see how far they get. Why? What are they looking for?\n\n\nWell, I think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t \nreally\n believe that it\u2019s infinite. Nature abhors infinity. There\u2019s a start and an end to everything in at least one dimension; the universe is infinite spatially but not temporally. It began at one point and will eventually end at another. When we see something that doesn\u2019t follow that rule - a \nbottomless pit\n or an \nendless hallway\n - we secure and contain it, because it fundamentally doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\nYet we accept this infinite number, pi, and we say the circumference of a circle is 2\u03c0r. But it\u2019s \nnot\n. If we measured the exact circumference of that circle all the way down to multiples of the Planck length, it wouldn\u2019t be a multiple of pi. Because \nthere is no pi\n. It\u2019s something that we have created, an arbitrary constant that we need to make our math work. It doesn\u2019t exist in nature. There are never \u201cpi electron volts\u201d or \u201cpi Higgs-bosons\u201d. Nature deals strictly in integers.\n\n\nAnd yet, -A somehow knew that we would find it. It knew that we (or someone, at least) would invent geometry, and in doing so discover pi. It knew that, once we found it, it would fascinate us. We'd want to delve deeper. So deep that the exact value at that scale is relevant only at a philosophical level. It knew that we wouldn't trust infinity, and we'd still want to measure it. To contain it.\n\n\nBut no matter how finely we measure, we\u2019ll only ever have an approximation. Infinite precision would still only find infinity. How is that possible, that there can be a number with no exact value, only an approximation? Somewhere, at the far end of pi, there is something else. That something may very well be nothing. But when we observe it, when we force it to conform to our understanding, we give it form and consciousness. We give it a soul. We give it a voice.\n\n\nAnd when it speaks, it refers to itself in the plural.\n\n\n-Dr. King\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation AI-4314-2 (an upgraded copy of AI-4314) was directed to calculate the value of \ne\n as precisely as possible.\n\n\nAddendum 4314-3:\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-4314-A has been redesignated SCP-4314-\u03c0.
