This chamber is to be kept under guard by two members of security personnel. Any additional instructions relating to SCP-4296 will be given by Dr. Henry Woods of the Pataphysics Department.\n\n\nTesting involving SCP-4296 is to take place once a day with the approval of Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4296 is an entity resembling a naked humanoid male, six meters in height and red in colouration. The limbs of SCP-4296 are fused directly together with its main body, and for this reason it has remained in the fetal position since it was first recovered in [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSCP-4296 reacts to no phenomena save for human suffering which occurs in its immediate vicinity, at which it will noticeably shudder and moan in a high-pitched voice. SCP-4296 appears to prefer physical injury and torture to mental or emotional distress - although it will still respond to it - but will not respond to any human suffering that concludes with the death of the human in question.\n\n\nIf SCP-4296 is not provided with at least one example of human suffering per day, it will demanifest from its current physical and metaphysical location and remanifest at the nearest location where human suffering can be found. SCP-4296 has proven capable of physical, metaphysical and pataphysical traversal, appearing in physical locations, dreams and even narrative works such as films and television shows on these occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4296-1:\n\n\nTesting Parties:\n Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nStimulus:\n Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enter the testing chamber. Using a handsaw, Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 non-lethally dismembers and beheads D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 over the course of three hours, scattering him throughout the testing chamber. Camera footage indicates D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is awake and actively conscious throughout this process.\n\n\nOnce D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been thoroughly dismembered, Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 rips out his own spinal cord and hangs himself with it from a nearby light fixture. Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 remains alive and in the same location as of the time of writing.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4296 shudders and moans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4296-2:\n\n\nTesting Parties:\n Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nStimulus:\n Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 enters the testing chamber, wheeling in an industrial meat grinder behind him. Once the meat grinder has been securely fitted in the center of the room, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 reluctantly feeds himself into said grinder for approximately thirty minutes, exiting it as a pile of miscellaneous wriggling viscera.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4296 shudders and moans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4296-3:\n\n\nTesting Parties:\n Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\n\n\nStimulus:\n All testing parties enter the chamber and sit in a circle around SCP-4296.

While they are screaming as expected, Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588 attempts to resist removing her own internal organs, but is obviously unable. Once all internal organs have been removed, the testing parties repeatedly smash their heads on the floor until they are unable to make any movement bar twitching on the ground.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4296 shudders and moans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4296-4:\n\n\nTesting Parties:\n D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nStimulus:\n D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enters the testing chamber. His head subsequently explodes. Following this, D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 rolls around on the floor, clawing at his stump.

Although the epidermis is burnt away, the fire is unable to burn any of the muscle or flesh beneath thoroughly enough to break it down, but still causes excruciating pain.
