After such procedures are conducted, instances of SCP-3260-A may receive amnestic treatment and be reassigned to non-critical positions within suitable Foundation front companies.\n\n\nAll Foundation facilities should be monitored for signs of SCP-3260.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3260 is a visuocognitive affliction affecting Foundation personnel exclusively. When in contact with official SCP documentation, an individual (SCP-3260-A) suffering from SCP-3260 will perceive the information contained therein differently from depicted, resulting in a perceptual discrepancy that may lead said individual to breach protocol, intentionally compromise containment measures, and perform other assorted actions based on the inaccurate interpretation of the relevant document(s).\n\n\nThe nature of the perceptual discrepancy experienced by instances of SCP-3260-A varies, but recurrently entails false and/or misleading information.\n\n\nAs of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588 cases of SCP-3260 have been identified among Foundation assets worldwide. Project Proxy currently coordinates all research efforts concerning SCP-3260 - Priority Aleph research subjects assigned to it include:\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of the vector through which SCP-3260 is transmitted, if existent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of personnel particularly susceptible to SCP-3260, if applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountermeasures to SCP-3260.\n\n\n\n\nNo obvious pattern has been established between confirmed cases of SCP-3260 at this time, both in regards to individuals affected and discrepancies observed.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Abridged SCP-3260 Case Report - Appropriate Clearance Required\n\n\n\n\nAfflicted:\n SCP-3260-A/1\n\n\nPrevious Clearance:\n Level 2, Junior Researcher\n\n\nDocument Summary:\n SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Euclid. Dis-2 thaumaturgical entity. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is aggressive towards all non-Tartarean lifeforms, and was responsible for at least 7 casualties before containment was established.\n\n\nReport:\n First reported case of SCP-3260. SCP-3260-A/1 was detained after it repeatedly attempted to assign a cleaning crew to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's enclosure. All containment cells housing aggressive SCP objects must be sanitized remotely as per standard Foundation protocol.\n\n\nWhen interrogated, SCP-3260-A/1 expressed confusion, citing the respective SCP document as the basis for its decision. Printed copies of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's special containment procedures were then provided to SCP-3260-A/1, who was asked to read them out loud. SCP-3260-A/1's reading contained a non-existent addendum describing \"Incident \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-V\", in which SCP-3260 was supposedly fed an experimental compound, rendering it docile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfflicted:\n SCP-3260-A/7\n\n\nPrevious Clearance:\n Level 4, Site-27 Director\n\n\nDocument Summary:\n SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Safe. A humanoid Class II essokinetic entity. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been cooperative since containment in \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and was reclassified as Safe after the introduction of Lang/Scantron-based devices to mainstream containment doctrine. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is paraplegic.\n\n\nReport:\n SCP-3260-A/7 received an updated copy of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 documentation following its reclassification, as per protocol. Upon reviewing the document, SCP-3260-A/7 alerted \nMTF Eta-10\n of a possible containment breach, citing suspicion that personnel assigned clearance 3/\u2588\u2588\u2588 might have been under the effect of an unknown cognitohazard.\n\n\nAfter no evidence of such contagion was discovered, SCP-3260-A/7 was questioned. Like in previous cases, SCP-3260-A/7 made allegations that had no correlation to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's actual containment procedures. Among them, SCP-3260-A/7 claimed the document called for unwarranted torture of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, including [REDACTED], in direct violation of multiple directives of the Ethics Committee. At this point in time, no further containment measures are necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfflicted:\n SCP-3260-A/9\n\n\nPrevious Clearance:\n Level 3, MTF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 Operative\n\n\nDocument Summary:\n SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (-\u2588, -\u2588). Keter. Humanoid entity that actively attempts to breach containment. Capable of inducing unclassified, non-thaumaturgical/essokinetic anomalous phenomena. Hostile to all human beings. Highly resistant to firearms.\n\n\nReport:\n SCP-3260-A/9 communicated desire to cease Foundation employ after receiving a digital copy of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's containment procedures. According to SCP-3260-A/9, the document mentioned Project \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588, a hypothetical initiative to incorporate SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 to MTF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588's roster. No plans to weaponize SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 currently exist, given the anomaly's Gimel classification following the most recent Thaumiel Review.

[REDACTED].\n\n\nReport:\n SCP-3260-A/21 brought attention to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 during [REDACTED], when the improvement of containment measures was being discussed. At this point, it was discovered that SCP-3260-A/21 had authorized several attempts to neutralize SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 through the use of other SCP objects. Such requests were sent by SCP-3260-A/22, SCP-3260-A/23 and SCP-3260-A/24, then senior researchers not known to have been affected by SCP-3260.\n\n\nThe incident marks the first observed case wherein multiple instances of SCP-3260-A shared an identical perception of a SCP document. At this time, neutralization of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is deemed unnecessary, following the successful development of Compound LZ-05.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAISA DATABASE INTEGRITY WARNING\n\n\n\n\nThis is the only accurate version of this document. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-3260 has not been neutralized and no inoculation process exists. SCP-3260 is not a Dis-5 thaumaturgical entity.
