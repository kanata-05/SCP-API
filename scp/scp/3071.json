Martha Langley\u2019s pets, one cat and two ferrets, went into the possession of Site 126 security guard Michael Pearson, all since deceased.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3071 was the materialisation of a non-anomalous Cavendish banana in the head of Martha Langley on March 23rd, 1987 at her home in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\n\nSCP-3071 resulted in the separation and ejection of most of Martha Langley\u2019s brain tissue and skull. Fragments of both were found in adjacent spaces to the dining room SCP-3071 occurred in, and various stains were present on all walls and the ceiling. Martha Langley is thought to have died between 0 and 0.5 seconds after SCP-3071. The banana also exploded.\n\n\nThe Foundation was made aware of SCP-3071 after a suicide report and police intervention. A cause for SCP-3071 has never been identified, but multiple have been disproven including teleportation, manual insertion and the Warhol effect.\n\n\nAddendum.3071.1:\n Testing Log\n\n\n\n\nTest \u2116:\n 1\n\n\nTest:\n Teleportation of 50 successive Cavendish bananas into 50 D-Class personnel heads.\n\n\nResult:\n Humans found uniquely susceptible to banana teleportation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest \u2116:\n 2\n\n\nTest:\n 50 Cavendish bananas shot by AR-15, one bullet each.\n\n\nResult:\n No new information gained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest \u2116:\n 3\n\n\nTest:\n 7.3\u00a0kg sledgehammer applied on 50 Cavendish bananas.\n\n\nResult:\n No new information gained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest \u2116:\n 4\n\n\nTest:\n 50 Cavendish bananas sliced into 1.5\u00a0cm wide units with a steak knife.\n\n\nResult:\n No new information gained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest \u2116:\n 5\n\n\nTest:\n Teleportation of 50 successive D-Class personnel into 50 bananas.\n\n\nResult:\n Bananas found uniquely susceptible to human teleportation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3070\n | SCP-3071 | \nSCP-3072\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3071\n\" by fabuIa, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
