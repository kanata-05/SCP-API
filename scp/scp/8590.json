While a reality warper, SCP-8590 does not currently pose a threat to the veil. Containment procedures are to be focused on tracking and documenting SCP-8590\u2019s manifestations and behavior until it can be successfully, permanently contained.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8590 is a 32-year-old human male with reality-warping abilities, including teleportation, manifestation of objects, manipulation of a person's memory, and omniscience.\n\n\nSCP-8590 uses the combination of its incredibly powerful abilities to work menial, low-paying jobs.\n\n\nSCP-8590 appears throughout the contiguous United States, usually in the Midwest. How SCP-8590 chooses its locations is unknown; there does not appear to be a pattern. Identification on SCP-8590\u2019s person (name tags, driver's license, etc) only displays the name \"Dale.\" The positions SCP-8590 holds change rapidly based on no known factor; most likely, SCP-8590 simply decides to have a new job and does so.\n\n\nAddendum 8590.1:\n Discovery and Initial Interactions\n\n\nDuring an unrelated investigation in Wisconsin, Foundation Agent Sarah Palmers encountered SCP-8590 when attempting to pick up a check from a local Goodwill.\n\n\n\n\nGOODWILL SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n(Palmers approaches SCP-8590 in an aisle. She is holding a vase.)\n\n\nPalmers:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Hm.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Is your manager here? I made a drop-off last week and needed to pick up my check.\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n He's not here today.\n\n\nPalmers:\n He said he would be here. Do you know when he'll be back?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Not in my job description to know that.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Alright. \n[\u2026]\n Can you tell him to give me a call when he gets back?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n I don't really like talking to him.\n\n\nPalmers:\n You're not being very helpful.\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n That's your opinion.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Uh\u2026 okay. I was looking at this vase. There's no sticker on it, do you know the price?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Take it.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Huh?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n I wouldn't care if you burned this place to the ground with me in it. Take the vase.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Okay. Are you sure?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n I do not care.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Alright. Thanks?\n\n\n(Palmers moves towards the exit.)\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n \n(Shouting.)\n The manager's not gonna let you back in the store if you steal that.\n\n\n(Palmers stops, then turns towards SCP-8590.)\n\n\nPalmers:\n I'm not stealing anything.\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n You didn't pay for that.\n\n\nPalmers:\n You literally told me to take it.\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n I'm not gonna stop you from stealing. I'm just letting you know the manager isn't gonna be happy. He'd probably ban you.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Then let me buy the fucking thing!\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n There's no need to use that language, ma'am.\n\n\n(SCP-8590 and Agent Palmers walk back to the cash register.)\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Is that all today?\n\n\nPalmers:\n Jesus fu\u2014 yes. That's all.\n\n\n(SCP-8590 scans the vase 100 times. Palmers stares, clearly losing patience.)\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n That'll be two thousand dollars.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Are you out of your mind?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n No.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Two \nthousand\n dollars?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Yeah.\n\n\nPalmers:\n That's not odd to you?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n I scanned it a hundred times.\n\n\nPalmers:\n Why the hell would you do that?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n You didn't stop me. I thought you wanted a hundred of them.\n\n\nPalmers:\n I don't \nwant\n a hundred vases. I want one.\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n You should have said that.\n\n\nPalmers:\n This is absurd!\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.\n\n\nPalmers:\n No no no. Don't worry.

SCP-8590 is driving.)\n\n\nPalmers:\n The hell? Are you towing my car because I didn't buy your vase?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Ma'am, that wouldn't make any sense. You double parked in the handicap section.\n\n\nPalmers:\n No\u2014 I\u2026 did I? I guess I did. Can you just help me out?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n There's going to be a fine.\n\n\nPalmers:\n How much?\n\n\nSCP-8590:\n Do you want a hundred cars or just the one?\n\n\nPalmers:\n Oh my god.
