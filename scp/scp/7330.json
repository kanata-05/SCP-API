Dunno who's gonna see it, but.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Log 7330.1\n\n\n[Major Evans, undergoing interstellar travel on a one-person mission to investigate an unidentified spatial anomaly, awakens early from cryosleep. She pings Site-821 in Hawaii, her flight control centre.]\n\n\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Command, you there?\n\n\nCommand:\n We're around.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n So, the selective cryosleep isn't really \ndoing it\n for me. Did you test it properly?\n\n\nCommand:\n We certainly tried, is it not putting you under?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Mostly, but I'm still conscious. I can still hear, see, all that. It's not comfortable. I've been playing guessing games to pass the time.\n\n\nCommand:\n Are you in danger? Will you survive the trip?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n\nCommand:\n Can you state your reason for halting cryosleep and initiating contact?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Oh. Uh. Like I said, I've been playing games to pass the time. I've been trying to name everything I can see out the porthole. It's been going alright, I never did too badly at astronomy. I guess that's obvious since\u2013\n\n\nCommand:\n Since you were selected for a top-secret, high-priority spacefaring mission? Yes.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Right, so anyway I'm doing great; nearly got all of them. Just a few bugging me.\n\n\nCommand:\n You want us to name the stars?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Just one or two. Not even that, just gimme a hint.\n\n\nCommand:\n Please hold.\n\n\n[Silence on recording]\n\n\nCommand:\n We're cleared to play a \nguessing game\n with you, Major Evans. Five minutes.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n You're misunderstanding. I just\u2013 Okay, whatever. What's that star? The one directly in front of me.\n\n\nCommand:\n Oh. That's Betelgeuse. It's in the Orion constellation, Major. \nHow did you not know this?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n No, I knew, I knew. I just did\u2013 wait, like the movie?\n\n\nCommand:\n Sort of. Betelgeuse is the star, it's spelled differently.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Really?\n\n\nCommand:\n Really. It's one of the largest stars we've found. Also known as Alpha Orionis. Again: how did you \nnot\n know this?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n You're kidding me. Betelgeuse. They named a star after a film.\n\n\nCommand:\n No! The star's name was the inspiration for the film. The film is spelled B-E-E-T-L-E-J-U-I-C-E. The star's spelled B-E-T-E-L-G-E-U-S-E.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n I feel like you're pulling my leg. That's a really weird way to spell it.\n\n\nCommand:\n We aren't. What will it take to convince you? It's called Betelgeuse.\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n But\u2013\n\n\nCommand:\n Betelgeuse!\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Doesn't\u2013\n\n\nCommand:\n \nBetelgeuse!\n\n\n[The signal from Command is replaced by noise.]\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Right. Well. Sorry. Anyway, about this cryo-sleep bug. Could you get one of the lab guys on the call?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Command?\n\n\nMaj. Evans:\n Guys?\n\n\n[Major Evans continues to send calls out to Command for another hour. At that point, she checks the Earth on her monitor. She doesn\u2019t believe it at first, because why would you? She sends out a distress call, and writes this draft.
