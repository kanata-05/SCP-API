Personnel are advised to stay within their respective locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaphysical representation of SCP-6408.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6408 is an oracular-shaped \nhole\n within the human noosphere, acting as a pathway to a much larger noospheric expanse. This invariably leads to foreign structures entering into consensus thought.\n\n\nThese foreign structures are metaphysical in nature, presenting as commands/demands. A subject's mind perceives these as subconscious thoughts and thus are acted upon without the subject's knowledge.\n\n\nLog of Foreign Structures:\n Each of these instances resulted in the subjects congregating at the derelict Foundation Site-301.\n\n\n\n\nInstance #1\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Screws\"\n\n\nResult:\n 48 personnel began to use their fingers to pull out assorted screws from Foundation buildings.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #2\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Steel beams\"\n\n\nResult:\n 13 personnel began to use their fists to punch at the concrete walls. After roughly 72 hours of this, the personnel retrieved several steel support beams from inside the walls.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #3\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Cement\"\n\n\nResult:\n 5 construction personnel diverged from a convoy of construction vehicles, bringing bags of cement to Site-301.\n\n\nResponse:\n Unaffected personnel began to follow the diverging convoy, which resulted in all of them being terminated by affected personnel at Site-301. The cadavers were repurposed for sustenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #4\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Guards\"\n\n\nResult:\n STF Theta-4 left their positions at Area-140 and walked towards Site-301, taking up defense positions there instead.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #5\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Food\"\n\n\nResult:\n 18 research personnel in the staff break room at Area-140 began raiding the cafeteria, bringing it to Site-301 in stolen vehicles.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #6\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Wires\"\n\n\nResult:\n 15 Foundation engineers began pulling apart equipment and machinery, collecting bags of assorted cables and wires before heading to Site-301.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #7\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Gears\"\n\n\nResult:\n The same Foundation engineers returned the following day attempting to enter Area-140. Replacement STF operatives attempted to stop the incoming personnel, but were easily eliminated by the attackers, who then proceeded to tear apart more machinery, returning to Site-301 with bags of assorted gears.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #8\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Workers\"\n\n\nResult:\n A total of 289 personnel from several Sites converged at Site-301.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #9\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Electricity\"\n\n\nResult:\n The affected personnel began to hijack Foundation powerlines, diverting electricity to Site-301.\n\n\nResponse:\n No response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #10\n\n\nDemand:\n \"Foundation\"\n\n\nResult:\n \nInsert Information Here\n\n\nResponse:\n \nInsert Information Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6407\n | SCP-6408 | \nSCP-6409\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6408\n\" by Bread_Tyrant, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
