Item is humanoid and possesses canid anatomical features such as; head resembling that of a coyote or jackal, a tail, short black fur covering its entire body, and claws.\n\n\nAge of the Item is unknown. Identity is suspected but not confirmed yet.\n\n\nItem is largely unresponsive to external stimuli. Since its containment, the Item has spent all of his time in a state similar to hibernation or suspended animation. It is not dead however.\n\n\nDetail of current containment:\n Item requires minimal containment measures. A normal sized room guarded by two security officers is sufficient to contain the entity.\n\n\nReport:\n Item was inherited to the Foundation by the Inner Africa Expeditionary Society. According to documentation belonging to the Society, the Item was found during an expedition into the Pyramids of Giza and recovered in the same state as it currently is in now.\n\n\nOutside of its appearance, the Item shows few abnormal properties. Item does not seem to age. Item does not seem to have physiological needs, and if it does, it does not need to satisfy them as it has made no attempt to eat or drink the food given to it by staff.\n\n\nAppendix:\n The current location of the Item is temporary. It is to be moved to ROAECC27 when construction of that facility is finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-7638\n\n\nLevel 3/7638\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Neutralized\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The remains of SCP-7638 are stored in the Low Security Artifact Storage section of Reliquary Area-27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7638's skull.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7638 was the deific entity known as Anubis, a zoomorphic deity belonging to the Egyptian pantheon whose worship began around 3100 BC and ended in the 530s AD.\n\n\nSCP-7638 was believed to have been a Class-III Reality-Bending entity and a skilled thaumaturge at its prime. However, this cannot be adequately verified due to its status as a Neutralized anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-7638 was first discovered and contained by the Inner Africa Expeditionary Society (IAES), a Foundation precursor organization that was dedicated to the containment of anomalous artifacts and entities within the African continent, particularly in British colonies of the time.\n\n\nSCP-7638, along with all other anomalies contained by the IAES, came into the possession of the Foundation on September 7th, 1901, following the dissolution and merger of the Society with 12 other anomalous management organizations which resulted in the formation of the modern-day SCP Foundation.\n\n\nAddendum-01:\n On 02/12/1908, one week following its transferral to Reliquary Area-27,\n1\n SCP-7638 awoke suddenly from its hibernation and a series of interviews were conducted with it by ex-director Vivianne August.\n\n\n\n\n[+]\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a01908/04/12.\n\n\n\n\n[-]\u00a0Close\u00a0Log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 04/12/1908\n\n\nINTERVIEWED:\n SCP-7638\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Director Vivianne August\n\n\n\n\n<Beginning of Log, 09:06>\n\n\nDirector August:\n [In Egyptian] H-Hello, Am\u2026 am I speaking to\u2014\n\n\n[Director August is cut off by SCP-7638.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n [In English] I appreciate the effort, but it is better not to speak a language you do not fully grasp.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Oh, you can\u2014 [She clears her throat.] Right, right, of course. Um, who\u2026 Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with, exactly?\n\n\n[SCP-7638 remains silent for a moment before beginning to hum.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Your kind has bestowed upon me many titles and names over the centuries, but I believe that you may know me better as \"Anubis\". So for all intents and purposes, that is who I am.\n\n\nDirector August:\n That\u2026 well, that certainly clears up a few things, uh\u2026\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Is everything well, human?\n\n\nDirector August:\n No\u2014 Erh, I mean, Yes! I'm just\u2026 This is\u2026\n\n\n[Director August stutters before nervously chuckling.]\n\n\nDirector August:\n Lord, I'm sorry. I just\u2026 nothing really prepares you to speak with an actual deity. I'm just nervous, it's all.\n\n\n[SCP-7638 laughs heartily.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Just like old times. You know? Whenever the others and I made an appearance among your kind, we would get the exact same reaction; even the mightiest Pharaohs would fall to their knees in awe and reverence. It is nice to know that some things have not changed even after all this time.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n But\u2026 you need not worry, human. My time as a being worthy of worship ended long ago.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Do you mind if I ask why?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n I do mind, but perhaps I will tell you another day.\n\n\nDirector August:\n \u2026 Okay, then. Why did you wake up just now? You were unresponsive since you were found, until now that is.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n \"Some of my brethren are here\u2014what little remains of them, at least. I can faintly feel the remnants of their essences permeating through the walls of this prison of mine. I wanted to see if it wasn't my mind playing a dirty trick on me.\n\n\nDirector August:\n I suppose that makes sense. We\u2014we do store quite a lot of artifacts, and other stuff down here, including things related to your pantheon.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n So you do. I must admit, you sure are an interesting bunch, trying to control that which your kind does not understand. A noble endeavor, but ultimately futile.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Yes, I've\u2026 heard that before, but, how do you know what our mission is?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n It is rather easy to pretend to be sleeping. Besides, I\u2014\n\n\n[SCP-7638 abruptly stops, coughing violently and gasping for breath.

Its fall is prevented by Director August, who holds its body with her arms as security arrives.]\n\n\n<End of Log, 09:14>\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n Following this incident, the Item was transported to the infirmary of the Complex by security personnel where it arrived unconscious but alive.

This place is rife with scholars, after all, is it not? One would assume that my chamber would be filled with people eager to ask me questions. Instead, it's just you.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Yes, well, this is a very important matter for the Foundation as a whole. My superiors can't just let anyone know you exist, let alone grant them access to speak with you.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Hmm, I suppose that makes sense, but I have the feeling your questions are more urgent than mine.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Yes, um\u2026 what exactly happened to you last time?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Did I scare you?\n\n\nDirector August:\n Scare me? You almost killed me!

SCP-7638 sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n The truth is, you could say that I am more dead than alive in my current state. It takes a lot of energy and concentration to ward off death for as long as I have, and there is something here making that more difficult.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Oh, right. There are a lot of defenses around here, especially the 'magical' kind. They must be interfering with\u2026 Whatever you're doing.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Ah, I see. It is no wonder that this place felt so strange to me then.\n\n\n[Silence.]]\n\n\nDirector August:\n What happened? Who did\u2026 this to you?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n The same one who slaughtered the others and razed our land.\n\n\nDirector August:\n You mean\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Something that is better left off for another day.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Sure.

Do not worry. I won\u2019t pass out again\u2014at least not for now, I promise.\n\n\n[Director August sighs and returns to her chair.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n As I said, a lot of energy and concentration, the latter of which is easily disrupted by your 'defenses'.\n\n\nDirector August:\n I\u2026 I imagine that must make it even harder without many worshippers.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Hmm? What do you mean?\n\n\nDirector August:\n You don't know? Sorry, I thought you were aware already, but you and your entire pantheon aren't worshipped nearly as much as you used to be, and\u2014\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n I do know that. I\u2019m simply confused as to why you think it would be relevant to my current state.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Oh, uh\u2026 We, the Foundation, I mean, operates under the belief that gods and similar entities require worshippers to exist. So, with a limited number of worshippers, your power would be lesser than it used to be overall.\n\n\n[Silence. SCP-7638 chuckles softly, his laughter gradually building to full-blown amusement over the course of several seconds.]\n\n\nDirector August:\n Did\u2026 Did I say something wrong?\n\n\n[SCP-7638 does not respond and continues laughing for approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds.]\n\n\nDirector August:\n \u2026 You don't need worship to exist, do you?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n No, we do \nnot\n! Where did such a ridiculous notion even come from?!\n\n\nDirector August:\n Decades of research and\u2026 And theories, by previous organizations.\n\n\n[SCP-7638 laughs again.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Oh, your kind's grandiose sense of self-importance will always be amusing to me.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Right.\n\n\n[Silence.

It has been a while since our last conversation after all.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Yeah, well, I have been very busy lately. You recontextualized\u2026 \na lot\n of things, and that has been taking up most of my time lately.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Ah, I see. Well then, I will keep things short.

I mean, you dismissed my previous questions abou it, and now you're just\u2026 going to tell me? Just like that?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n I know this seems sudden, but I have meditated enough, and I\u2026 I need to get this off my chest.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Sure, that's reasonable enough. You can begin when you're ready.\n\n\n[Silence for 12 seconds.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n It all happened several millennia ago. I was tending the souls of the dead, guiding them to the \ndw\ua723t\n2\n as was my duty. It was just another day. Everything was going well\u2026 until he appeared.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Who?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Oh, I am sure you are most familiar with him, doctor. You are a follower of his, after all.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nDirector August:\n \u2026Yahweh?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Who else?\n\n\nDirector August:\n Oh\u2026 holy shit.\n\n\n[SCP-7638 sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n He began by plaguing our people, as I am sure you must already know. It's a famous story, after all.\n\n\nDirector August:\n Y-Yeah, the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Of course, we attempted to retaliate\u2014to defend our home and our followers\u2014but\u2026 we failed. Laughably so. He slaughtered most of us, wounded others, like me, and then forced the few of us he did not finish off to watch as he ravished the people we protected.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Do you have any idea how it felt? To stand there, unable to do anything as hundreds beg you to save them?\n\n\nDirector August:\n No. I\u2026 I don't.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n And I hope you never have to find out, for your sake. Regardless, after everything was said and done, he departed with his people and left us broken beyond repair. We tried to continue without the others, but it was never the same.\n\n\nDirector August:\n I'm sorry\u2026 If that's worth anything to you.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Do not be.

Upon inspection of the wing, the corpse of SCP-7638 was found in its containment cell, undergoing an early stage of decomposition.\n\n\nImmediately following the discovery, an autopsy was conducted on the corpse of SCP-7638.

It took you almost three months.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Things such as these require that time, human, specially so when I am\u2026 Like this.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Of course. Now, what do you have for me?\n\n\n[SCP-7638 pushes SCP-7638-1 forward on the table]\n\n\nO5-11:\n Nice handiwork.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n I believe that you're familiar with the shape.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Yes, I did my research into your pantheon. It's an Ankh, a symbol that represents life.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n Correct. It's imperfect, but it works. Stay close to it and death shall be almost unknown to you.\n\n\nO5-11:\n \nAlmost?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n I\u2026 There is a part that I need to complete it, but I cannot obtain it without dying in the process. I did the best that I could with what I had.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nO5-11:\n Why didn\u2019t you ask us for help?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n There is no man alive who knows the afterlife as well as I do. I am sure that your people are more than capable at what they do, but I do not trust you with this.\n\n\nO5-11:\n I\u2026 See.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n If you'll excuse me, it is time for you to upheld your end of the deal.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Huh? Oh, right. Give me a moment.\n\n\n[O5-11 exits the interview room and returns 1 minute and 2 seconds later, accompanied by a member of MTF Alpha-1 carrying a cadaver trolley with a coffin on it.]\n\n\nO5-11:\n Here, it's all yours.\n\n\n[The Alpha-1 member moves the trolley toward SCP-7638 and opens the coffin, revealing its contents.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n What is this?\n\n\nO5-11:\n Is there a problem?\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n This\u2014there is barely anything here!\n\n\nO5-11:\n Oh, that. You see, Anubis, we made a deal: you gave us immortality, and in exchange, I\u2019d let you see your wife\u2019s bones. Unfortunately, you delivered something incomplete, and in turn, I\u2019m giving you something that\u2019s also incomplete.\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n But it works! It is almost complete! There is very little difference between true immortality and this!\n\n\nO5-11:\n But there is, and I was very clear. Pseudo-immortality or whatever you call it only gets you a skull and a few other bones, pal.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n You are a miserable man.\n\n\nO5-11:\n I don't need your opinion.\n\n\n[O5-11 takes SCP-7638-1 and walks to the exit of the containment chamber, accompanied by the Alpha-1 member. He is interrupted by SCP-7638 as he is about to step through the exit.]\n\n\nSCP-7638:\n You better cling to life as long as you can, \nbecause I swear that what awaits you afterward is worse than any earthly punishment you could possibly think of.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Don\u2019t worry about me; I\u2019m not planning on dying anytime soon. You have 15 minutes.\n\n\n[O5-11 leaves the containment chamber.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 minutes following the conclusion of the above interaction, the corpse of SCP-7638 was found laying on the floor of the chamber, holding the skull of the deceased Egyptian deific entity Anput close to its chest cavity.\n\n\nAll personnel working at Reliquary Area-27's High Value Containment Wing were amnesticized afterwards and a cover-up story was fabricated to conceal the circumstances of SCP-7638's neutralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7637\n | SCP-7638 | \nSCP-7639\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7638\n\" by SimpleRuins, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
