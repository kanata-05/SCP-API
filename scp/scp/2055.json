All Class A and Class B personnel, as well as key civilian figures, should be subject to constant automated remote surveillance using approved protocol D-11 for intelligent remote monitoring systems.\n\n\nRecording and alarms should be triggered in response to observed individuals engaging in \u201cchair-gathering\u201d, talking to themselves, or otherwise displaying abnormal acute-onset behaviours. In the event of automated monitors being triggered, the nearest available security officers should be alerted and authorised to carry out immediate physical intervention.\n\n\nIn cases where remote monitoring has allowed SCP-2055 to be interrupted, affected individuals have become highly agitated and resistant. As such, the use of restraints is approved in order to prevent affected personnel harming themselves or others.\n\n\nOnce removed from the location of onset, abnormal behaviours cease, with the individual exhibiting no memory of preceding events. Affected personnel must nevertheless be debriefed, in order to identify any epidemiological pattern or predictors of onset.\n\n\nWhere the process ends in the individual taking their own life, gathered chairs should be removed, in order to support the appearance of mundane suicide.\n\n\nDue to the difficulty in predicting the occurrence, prevalence or individual outcomes of SCP-2055, constant surveillance is currently the only certain counter-measure. Professor H\u2588\u2588\u2588's interviews with survivors of SCP-2055 and post-mortem examinations of fatalities have not yet identified any definitive aetiology or risk factors; as such, further investigation is essential. Observation is therefore a priority and it is necessary that observed occurrences in non-essential populations be allowed to continue to completion in order to further knowledge of this phenomenon.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2055 is a behavioural phenomenon that has been observed in \u2588.\u2588% of the global population. Estimating the precise number of cases is difficult as survivors of SCP-2055 retain no memory of the phenomenon, and it is likely that the majority of SCP-2055 fatalities have been miscategorised as conventional suicides due to the similarity in presentation.\n\n\nSCP-2055 fatalities are distinguished only by the behaviours preceding death: affected individuals will, whilst alone, suddenly begin gathering any available nearby chairs and placing them in a row. Affected individuals have then been observed to talk to themselves for anywhere between a few minutes and twelve hours, moving around the room and appearing to address the empty chairs.\n\n\nIn 94.3% of observed cases, the individual ultimately discontinued this behaviour and resumed previous activities without any apparent memory of the occurrence. However, in 5.7% of cases the individual ended the behaviour in suicide \u2014 most commonly through the application of a ligature to the neck, although exsanguination and self-poisoning have also been observed.\n\n\nDue to the lack of awareness of their own behaviour exhibited by survivors, the only means of investigating SCP-2055 has been through random surveillance of the general population via \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The first case was observed \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1994 and, since the inclusion of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in commercial \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 after \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it has become possible to remotely observe increasing numbers of cases.\n\n\nNo abnormalities have been identified by either psychological examination of individuals who have survived this phenomenon or post-mortem examination of those who have not. However, remote recording of the phenomenon taking place has generated potentially useful insights into the nature of SCP-2055.\n\n\nAnalysis of recordings initially identified a resemblance between the behaviour of affected individuals and the behaviour of a defendant standing trial. However, legal experts who have reviewed recordings of affected individuals have suggested that the process more closely resembles the legal practice of voir dire: the preliminary examination of prospective jurors to determine their suitability to serve on a jury.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nTranscriptions of remote SCP-2055 recordings gathered covertly via \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\n\nTranscript SCP-2055-1207\n\n\n[\nSubject 1207\n is alone in his home eating an evening meal at onset of phenomenon.
