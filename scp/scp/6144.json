They must then smash and eat $0.78 million USD worth of computer graphics cards. {\nadded on March 17th, 2022\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe organization and successful adherence to the containment procedures will be managed by Alpha: Containment-6144.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6144 is a cinnamon tree that causes economic collapse within the American stock market. Cinnamon sticks created from SCP-6144\u2019s bark are not anomalous.\n\n\nPaper made from the pulp of cut branches of SCP-6144 display the above-mentioned containment procedures. Every four years, an additional step appears on newly made paper from SCP-6144.\n\n\nThe additional step is then analyzed by Alpha: Containment-6144 and, subsequently, constructed and added to SCP-6144's containment area. Each new containment procedure has been noted to be more difficult and convoluted to follow as time progresses.\n\n\nThe containment procedures for SCP-6144 have been halted three times since its initial containment. Listed below are short excerpts of each incident.\n\n\n\n\nContainment Breach Log\n\n\nBreach 1; Date: 3/17/1974:\n Misunderstanding of SCP-6144 led to a lack of containment for approximately 5 months and 17 days. It is generally considered that the resulting effect of this was the stock market crash of 1974 and the subsequent stagflation\n1\n of the 1970s.\n\n\nThe difference of time between the start of containment and the descent of oil prices, which is thought to be the instigator of the recession, was 10 days.\n\n\nBreach 2; Date: 6/22/2000:\n An attack on Site-28 by the Chaos Insurgency led to a break in containment of SCP-6144 for 4 days. Later that month, the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s burst, causing the collapse of the early Internet industry.\n\n\nThe difference of time between the renewal of containment and the raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which is thought to be the instigator of the recession, was 21 days. The main reason for the raising of interest rates is still debated.\n\n\nBreach 3; Date: 9/13/2008:\n The late 2000\u2019s \u201c\nType Green\n\u201d Campaign by the Global Occult Coalition, which involved the extensive termination and imprisonment of reality benders, led to a sharp decline in supply of Level 2B Reality Benders required for Containment Step 5. SCP-6144 lacked containment for approximately 3 weeks, 4 days.\n\n\nThe ensuing phenomena was the Great Recession of 2008 and the following housing price collapse. Supply chain issue of reality benders was solved through importation from parallel realities.\n\n\nThe difference of time between the renewal of containment and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers\n2\n was 27 days.\n\n\n\n\nIt is still unclear whether the aforementioned situations were the result of SCP-6144\u2019s lack of containment or were coincidental incidents that occured due to chance. The economic recessions supposedly caused by SCP-6144 can be explained by legitimate non-anomalous factors.\n\n\nBayesian statistical analysis of the null hypothesis of SCP-6144 not being anomalous results in a p=0.06\n3\n. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively determined that SCP-6144 does, in fact, impact stock prices.\n\n\nSCP-6144 was secured on March 17th, 1974 at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s de Paris\n4\n in Paris, France. The amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre was the location of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the AWCY? movement and the 10th \"\nSommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\n5\n\".\n\n\nThe following log is the first appearance and securement of SCP-6144 during the \nSommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\n.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 17th, 1974\n\n\nInvestigator:\n Undercover Agent Joseph Laurent\n\n\nBackground:\n Keynote Exhibition #2 occurred in the \u201cGreat Hall of the People\u201d \u2014 a room seating 5,000 individuals. The session commenced at 9:43 am. A number of anomalous objects, phenomena, beings were presented by their associated creator. The final presentation was listed on the events brochure as \n\u201cSins of the Past Haunt the Future\u201d\n.\n\n\nAgent Laurent was assigned to monitor this session and report back all anomalous entities.\n\n\n\n\nStart Log:\n\n\nPOI: 3542A \u201cThe Box of Teeth\n6\n\u201d:\n \u2026that was quite a marvelous sculpture. Thank you for that. And now for the last showcase for this block, we have a project from a group in Indonesia. This proposal has been endorsed by \u201cThe Dancer.\u201d\n\n\nPOI: 1762F \u201cShaamil Sihasale\u201d:\n Good afternoon fellow artists, entrepreneurs, doctors, executives, and patrons of the arts. My name is Shaamil Sihasale, third year student at the College of the Green Forest\n7\n\n\nToday, I will be presenting on behalf of the Malacca Supernatural Artists Collective (MSAC). Before I continue, I would like to thank the Selection Committee for granting us this privilege of presenting this piece to all of you.\n\n\nAs well, thank you to the 15,000 damned souls that were used by MSAC and infused into the tree. Finally, the biggest thanks goes to the late creator of this project Aalok Majumder, who sadly was eaten by the amazing piece by \u201cThe Playwright\u201d a few hours ago. I\u2019ll be presenting on his behalf.\n\n\nWhat you see before you is a cinnamon tree and it does something cool. (\nsilence for 20 seconds\n)\n\n\nPOI: 3542A \u201cThe Box of Teeth:\n Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?\n\n\nPOI: 1762F \u201cShaamil Sihasale\u201d:\n Hmm\u2026well\u2026let's see\u2026(\nsilence for 15 seconds\n) Okay, okay, I\u2019ll be honest. Aalok wanted the tree to be one thing but I see it a different way.\n\n\nThis is how he saw it. So there was this company, yeah? Called the Dutch East India Company, they along with a lot of other companies took over Southeast Asia, real imperialist style and grew a lot of spices. Funny thing too, all those hundreds of islands were named the \u201cSpice Isles.\u201d That wasn\u2019t our name, though. (\nlaughs\n)\n\n\nSo Aalok thought one day, it would be quite serendipitous if the spices said \u201c\nfuck you\n\u201d right back. Like c'mon, their economy was jump started by the exploitation of our lands and people. So wouldn\u2019t the most acute irony be that if a cinnamon tree, the exact same spice that started this whole thing, caused them to lose that same money?\n\n\nOkay, okay. So now you have his version.\n\n\nBut! I view it in a different way. Instead of viewing it as a tool in reference to the past, why not look to our future? So taking advice from my good friend, and founder of MSAC, \u201cThe Dancer,\u201d we decided to \ngift\n this item to the SCP Foundation. (\nmurmurs in the audience\n)\n\n\nHah! Don\u2019t worry. The astute among us have already noticed. Can the fellow artist in Row 27 seat 14 come to the stage? That\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking to you Foundation agent Laurent.\n\n\n(\nThere is an uproar in the audience. Some individuals jump out of their seats and run, most are yelling loudly, a few have no reaction. Sihasale whispers into the microphone\n)\n\n\nHe\u2019s spying on us, by the way, so don\u2019t take out anything too unique.\n\n\n(\nAgent Joseph Laurent is instructed to, tentatively, follow POI: 1762F\u2019s instructions. As such he quickly walks to the stage.\n)\n\n\nSo I know the Foundation doesn\u2019t like art too much. But our founder thought instead of punishing the empires that are long gone, why not punish the ones oppressing us now?\n\n\nSo Laurent, my friend, you will take this tree. And you will contain it, just as you have done with many of MSAC\u2019s other projects.\n\n\nBut here\u2019s a secret, making sure it doesn\u2019t activate will get more difficult overtime. I\u2019m sure you can figure out the details, but it\u2019s a built-in measure to make sure Aalok\u2019s revenge eventually comes.\n\n\nOne day you \nwill\n fail, let's just see how long you can keep the system going.\n\n\nSo there we go. A construct that will ruin both the sins of the fallen kingdoms and the kingdom ruling over us in the present. I have some more philosophical babble about capitalism, symbolism, inspiration and other shit like that but I\u2019ll save that for the discussion block afterwards.\n\n\nLaurent, before you go, I\u2019ll give you a small hint. The souls that Aalok infused get kinda chippy if you don\u2019t regularly feed them. Up to you if you want to do something about it.\n\n\n(\nBefore any response could be made, Agent Laurent and SCP-6144 are transported to the street adjacent from the Palais des Congr\u00e8s de Paris\n.)\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n A subsequent raid of the hall 30 minutes later led to no persons or evidence of the \nSommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\n The other assigned undercover agents Marie-Fran\u00e7oise De Villepin, Fabien Chastain, Jean-Luc Cl\u00e9risseau lost contact and have since been MIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. A period of time in which there is both high unemployment and high inflation.\n\n\n2\n. At the time, the fourth largest investment bank whose collapse triggered many after-effects of the recession.\n\n\n3\n. Standard protocol for the rejection of the null hypothesis would require a p-value of less than 0.05.\n\n\n4\n. One of the largest convention venues in France.\n\n\n5\n. This exhibition of anomalous art pieces and projects has been held every 10 years since 1874. Members of the AWCY? movement send their proposals to the Selection Committee.\n\n\n6\n. The announcer and main moderator for the \nSommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\n, POI: 3542A is composed of three mouths attached to a femur bone.\n\n\n7\n. A colloquial idiom meaning that an individual grew up as a bandit, thief, or outlaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6143\n | SCP-6144 | \nSCP-6145\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6144\n\" by Azmoeth Jikandia, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
