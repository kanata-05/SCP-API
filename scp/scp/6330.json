Funding should be supplied to companies encouraging the sale and purchase of baby monitor cameras, in an attempt to detect and witness SCP-6330 \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019 Events.\n\n\nShould reports of a Sleepwalker Event circulate, Mobile Task Force Iota-12 \u2018Lucid Dreamers\u2019 are tasked with investigation and suppression of public media circulation or news reports regarding SCP-6330. All civilians who view SCP-6330-1 or SCP-6330-2 instances are to be immediately administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n\nAt any time, one (1) SCP-6330-1 should be held within a small item locker in the site nearest to its recovery (current study instance kept at Site-44). The instance should be examined weekly and any changes, reported to the nearest Level-3 researcher. SCP-6330-1 that are affected by Sleepwalker Events are to be left in the possession of the family they were discovered with, as no anomalous activity has ever been recorded following an Event.\n1\n Families in possession of SCP-6330-1 should be monitored in case of further activity.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6330 is a phenomenon affecting stuffed animals worldwide, though is most common in teddy bears. Manifestation of this phenomenon is referred to as a Sleepwalker Event.\n\n\nSleepwalker Events occur only within the households of families with young children, typically between the ages of 1 to 14. Events begin by the manifestation of entities referred to as SCP-6330-2. These creatures typically blend with shadows (though this mechanism is poorly understood) and somewhat resemble creatures associated with fantasy, such as dragons or ogres, and always manifest beneath a child\u2019s bed. SCP-6330-2 instances depict behaviour indicating that they intend to hunt or prey upon the sleeping child. SCP-6330-1 are stuffed animals already present in a child\u2019s room, that seem to be non-anomalous prior to SCP-6330-2 manifestations.\n\n\nSCP-6330-1 have been shown to instantaneously manifest small wooden \nmedieval\n2\n weaponry in order to combat SCP-6330-2, and assumably to protect the child. Battles have been shown to last upwards of 20 minutes, and are always near silent. In \nall\n most observed cases, SCP-6330-1 have emerged victorious,\n3\n though are severely \u2018wounded\u2019 during the skirmish. Torn wool and stuffing are common, and following all known events, SCP-6330-1 have \u2018died\u2019 due to their injuries. Prior to \u2018death\u2019, the instance will drag the SCP-6330-2\u2019s corpse back under the bed frame and demanifest.\n\n\nIt will emerge a short while later, and attempt to climb the bed. The SCP-6330-1 will then embrace its child and \u2018pass away\u2019.\n\n\nAddendum 6330.1:\n Test Logs\n\nDue to SCP-6330 incidents being generally random and irregular, a total of one controlled test has taken place. The following is a log of the events.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Test\u00a06330-14\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Test\u00a06330-14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-44\n\n\nDate:\n 14/7/1987\n\n\nForeword:\n The following test was conducted on the grounds of Site-44. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s 7-year-old daughter (henceforth referred to as \u2018subject\u2019) was placed in a humanoid containment room and was soothed to sleep using a teddy bear that Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 claimed the subject had a strong emotional attachment to. This experiment was conducted a total of 13 times prior to the following Sleepwalker Event. MTF Iota-12 were stationed at the room\u2019s entrance for swift intervention if needed.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Pines:\n Subject has entered REM sleep.\n\n\nSubject:\n (\nQuiet snoring\n)\n\n\nNo anomalous activity is observed for 3 hours. At 01:40 PDT, an SCP-6330-2 is observed beneath the subject\u2019s bed.\n\n\n01:40:\n A quiet rustling sound can be heard beneath the bed and sounds reminiscent of a large animal\u2019s breathing are audible. A pair of large, scaly clawed hands grasp the rim of the bed. A creature resembling a western dragon emerges. It stands approximately 3 metres above the ground, switching between bipedal and quadrupedal motion.\n\n\n01:45:\n For five minutes, the SCP-6330-2 patrols the room, moving silently and methodically, unaware of the surveillance cameras.\n\n\n01:50:\n SCP-6330-2 turns towards the subject, poising itself at the foot of the bed, stretching its arms out towards the subject. It gapes its jaws wide, exposing rows of large, pointed teeth and a dark pink tongue. Its motions at this time are likened to that of a snake. As it seems to prepare to lunge at the subject, the stuffed bear stands up on the subject\u2019s chest, and draws a small sword and shield from an unknown source. It positions its sword\u2019s tip pointed downward and has its shield at its side. SCP-6330-1 hunches over slightly and twirls its sword,\n4\n maintaining eye contact with SCP-6330-2. After 10 seconds, the SCP-6330-2 throws its jaws at the subject and SCP-6330-1 responds with a leap towards the subject\u2019s attacker, slicing SCP-6330-2\u2019s eye. The SCP-6330-2 responds with a quiet grunt, and touches its wound, which leaks a viscous black liquid.\n5\n The SCP-6330-1 jumps towards SCP-6330-2 and utilises fabric from the bedsheets to quickly cover the wound, apparently attempting to minimise mess and evidence of its presence.\n\n\n01:59:\n Both instances are in battle for 9 minutes before the first signs of damage to SCP-6330-1. Following the severing of one of SCP-6330-2\u2019s dorsal spikes, it strikes the SCP-6330-1 with a heavy slap, which sends SCP-6330-1 across the room. SCP-6330-1 stands back up, placing a hand on its stomach, and looks at its hand which is now covered in wool and stuffing. They charge at each other once again, though the subject seems to move slightly in their sleep. Both instances stop and quickly stare at the subject before the subject settles. The instances resume fighting.\n\n\n02:10:\n After 20 minutes of battle, both instances are heavily scarred and injured. After kicking itself off of the SCP-6330-2\u2019s nose, SCP-6330-1 sprints from one side of the room towards SCP-6330-2, leaping into the air and landing a fatal blow, slicing the neck of the other instance, which falls lifeless to the floor. SCP-6330-2 is dragged by the SCP-6330-1, back under the bed.\n\n\n02:15:\n A short while later, the SCP-6330-1 emerges. Damage sustained includes loss of one buttoned eye, exposed stuffing and torn wool. It places its sword and broken shield on a nearby table. SCP-6330-1 then drags itself up the bedsheets towards the subject, who was sleeping peacefully throughout the test. It rests beside the child, laying motionless. It seems to glare directly at the camera, and a small woollen thumb protrudes from its round hand, giving a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 to researchers. Its head flops onto the child\u2019s cheek before it ceases to move.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon conclusion of this test, MTF Iota-12 carried out heavy investigation of the bed. The SCP-6330-2\u2019s corpse was not discovered beneath the bed frame, though trace amounts of the aforementioned black substance was present. Samples taken reveal it to be composed of raw haemoglobin and water, though its viscous nature and other physical properties do not support the discovery.\n\n\nThe SCP-6330-1 instance was removed and placed in secure storage. It has to date shown no further anomalous properties.\n\n\nAddendum 6330.2:\n\nFollowing a Sleepwalker Event taking place on 07/07/2001, a news headline with the title:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung Boy Reported Missing from Family Home in Portland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas circulated on mass among citizens of Portland, OR. Upon investigators\u2019 arrival at the scene, it was discovered that the young boy\u2019s room had large trails of viscous black liquid streaking the walls. Investigators soon requested Foundation intervention, at which point, MTF Iota-12 were dispatched. Testing confirmed the substance to be that commonly associated with SCP-6330-2, and Iota-12 requested permission to carry out full investigation of the Event. This request was approved by Overseer command.\n\n\nThe following file was written by MTF Iota-12 personally. I recommend all informal comments should be ignored. ~ Director Woods.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Field\u00a0Report\u00a06330-131\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Field\u00a0Report\u00a06330-131\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENT 131 INCIDENT REPORT\n\n\nReport:\n 6330-131\n\n\nOverall Disruption:\n High (like really bad)\n\n\nSummary:\n Sleepwalker occurred on the night of 06/07/2001. No camera footage, witness reports or any signs of exactly what happened, though neighbours who were awake reported hearing thumping from the room. Trails of suspected SCP-6330-2 viscera on the walls.\n\nChild missing. Additionally, the aforementioned child\u2019s stuffed orca was found in the corner of the room. Well, really parts of it were all over the place, but its main body and head sat hunched over near the bed. It had an amount of the black substance on it, but its eyes were damp with water. We suspect it was an SCP-6330-1 instance.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Local Authorities and Media companies have picked up on the case. The public are very interested in trying to figure out what caused the disappearance. We\u2019ve told them that we think an animal or something came in the room, kid put up a fight, and that the substance was blood, but the kid lost and was taken by it. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not happy with that answer and people are demanding we \u2018stop lying to them\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING: Portland Boy Found!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 days after the Sleepwalker Event, the child was rediscovered, unconscious behind a hedge in the family\u2019s garden. A brief interview revealed that the child witnessed the final minutes of this Event. He claimed \u201cMy orca was fighting a big monster, and then the monster grabbed me and took me out the window but someone saw it\n6\n so it dropped me and I hid in the bush\u201d. A second interview revealed no other discoveries, but the child claimed \u201cthe monster \nate his socks\n\u201d.\n\n\nIt is unknown what the SCP-6330-2\u2019s intentions were, had it been able to escape with the child. All involved were amnesticised and a cover story was fabricated, with Iota-12 encouraging parents in the local area to purchase video surveillance cameras.\n\n\nAddendum 6330.3:\n\nOn 19/11/2008, a call was filed to local authorities by a family in Cambridge, England. They claimed to have discovered footage of a Sleepwalker Event within their son\u2019s room. Mobile Task Force Iota-12 \u2018Lucid Dreamers\u2019 were dispatched to investigate. The footage was seized by personnel and all members of the family were administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Document\u00a06330-184\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Document\u00a06330-184\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Cambridge, England, within the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family\u2019s residence.\n\n\nDate:\n 19/11/2008\n\n\nForeword:\n The following is a textual description of the events witnessed by baby monitors. It should be noted that this is the first digital recording of a Sleepwalker Event outside of controlled testing.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n12:01:\n The child\u2019s bed sways lightly as an instance of SCP-6330-2 emerges. The instance resembles an unknown creature, though is described as having a large, muscular frame and stands upright. The instance walks to the opposite end of the room, hunching over and observing the child for exactly 10 minutes.\n\n\n12:11:\n The SCP-6330-2 begins to stand further upright, extending an assumably retractable set of claws. The child\u2019s teddy bear, which was placed next to the child, suddenly stands, drawing a bow and quiver. SCP-6330-2 assumes a quadrupedal stance and snarls before lunging towards the bed. The SCP-6330-1 fires a single arrow towards the SCP-6330-2, striking the instance directly in its canine-like snout. SCP-6330-2 responds with a loud huff, reminiscent of that of a bull or bovine.\n\n\n12:28:\n The instances battle for approximately 30 minutes, the longest recorded Sleepwalker Event to date. Both show abilities and skill sets consistent with other SCP-6330-1 and -2 instances. Eventually, SCP-6300-2 has SCP-6330-1 pinned to a nearby wall, seeming to \u2018strangle\u2019 it. The SCP-6330-2 then pulls one of SCP-6330-1\u2019s arrows from its arm, plunging it into the -1\u2019s chest. SCP-6330-1 shows behaviours likened to those of intense pain. SCP-6330-2 seems to be victorious.\n\n\nThe SCP-6330-2 leans its head towards SCP-6330-1, seeming to \u2018whisper\u2019 into the instance\u2019s right ear, though audio recordings cannot determine exactly what was vocalised. The SCP-6330-1 lifts up its head, staring blankly into SCP-6330-2\u2019s eyes. It reaches behind its back, pulling out a small, entirely wooden Glock-19 handgun. The bear points the weapon into SCP-6330-2\u2019s forehead and swiftly fires. The shot creates minimal noise and the SCP-6330-2\u2019s body falls limp. Black, viscous fluid is sprayed on the wall. The -1 hauls SCP-6330-2\u2019s corpse towards the bed, noticeably limping. It drags the body by its large forearm and demanifests upon reaching the underneath of the bed.\n\n\n12:40:\n SCP-6330-1 returns, and briefly stares around the room before turning to the child. It climbs up a desk and seems to notice a piece of paper and pen. It begins to write a note, which is left on the bedside desk (\nSee Field Report 6330-184\n). Heavily wounded, the -1 limps to the bed, falling on the child\u2019s chest with its arms stretched wide. There is no further movement, it perishes next to its child.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a report of the investigation, written by MTF Iota-12 following the case\u2019s conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Field\u00a0Report\u00a06330-184\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Field\u00a0Report\u00a06330-184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENT 184 INCIDENT REPORT\n\n\nReport:\n 6330-184\n\n\nOverall Disruption:\n Low\n\n\nSummary:\n Sleepwalker begun at 12:01. Fight approx. 30 minutes. Sleepwalker ended at 12:40, with the neutralisation of the affected SCP-6330-1. Really made us question how many times this happened to us all as kids\u2026\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n SCP-6330-1 produced a note. Only recorded instance of -1s being able to understand english. Reads as following:\n\n\n\n\nHello, Timothy.\n\n\n \n\n\nThank you for always taking care of me, it really was fun. I was able to repay the favour of protecting you. Unfortunately I am hurt.

SCP-6330-2 responds with a loud huff, reminiscent of that of a bull or bovine. 12:28: The instances battle for approximately 30 minutes, the longest recorded Sleepwalker Event to date. Both show abilities and skill sets consistent with other SCP-6330-1 and -2 instances. Eventually, SCP-6300-2 has SCP-6330-1 pinned to a nearby wall, seeming to \u2018strangle\u2019 it. The SCP-6330-2 then pulls one of SCP-6330-1\u2019s arrows from its arm, plunging it into the -1\u2019s chest. SCP-6330-1 shows behaviours likened to those of intense pain. SCP-6330-2 seems to be victorious. The SCP-6330-2 leans its head towards SCP-6330-1, seeming to \u2018whisper\u2019 into the instance\u2019s right ear, though audio recordings cannot determine exactly what was vocalised. The SCP-6330-1 lifts up its head, staring blankly into SCP-6330-2\u2019s eyes. It reaches behind its back, pulling out a small, entirely wooden Glock-19 handgun. The bear points the weapon into SCP-6330-2\u2019s forehead and swiftly fires. The shot creates minimal noise and the SCP-6330-2\u2019s body falls limp. Black, viscous fluid is sprayed on the wall. The -1 hauls SCP-6330-2\u2019s corpse towards the bed, noticeably limping. It drags the body by its large forearm and demanifests upon reaching the underneath of the bed. 12:40: SCP-6330-1 returns, and briefly stares around the room before turning to the child. It climbs up a desk and seems to notice a piece of paper and pen. It begins to write a note, which is left on the bedside desk ( See Field Report 6330-184 ). Heavily wounded, the -1 limps to the bed, falling on the child\u2019s chest with its arms stretched wide. There is no further movement, it perishes next to its child. [END LOG]"
