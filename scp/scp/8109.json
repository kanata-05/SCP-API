One of these vials (SCP-8109-1) was confirmed destroyed during experimental testing. Another vial (SCP-8109-2) was utilized by unknown hostiles during a raid on Site-76 on 08-29-2016. The eight remaining vials are under secure storage at Site-76 \u00abfootnote 1\u00bb.\n\n\nAs victims of SCP-8109 exhibit anti-entropic properties, rapidly absorbing heat from the surrounding area, proper storage of cadavers is a priority. Site 76's deep chill storage facility will suffice for this purpose. Should an SCP-8109 victim be encountered in the wild, Mobile Task Force Kappa-Five (\"Vonnegut's Nightmare\") will be dispatched to sequester and secure the cadaver.\n\n\nNo further containment procedures are required.\n \u00abfootnote 2\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n\n\nSite-76 is a major containment site located in the United States of America, housing a large number of anomalous objects presumed to be man-made. The Site is one of the oldest American facilities still in operation, located within former US government buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 2:\n\n\n\nSee Addendum #3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: Unsaved Edits Present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Image: \nSCP-8109.png\n\nEnter Alt-Text Description Below\n\n\n\nX-ray image of a 9 year-old male victim of SCP-8109. Note the crystallization of the brain matter, the ice-spikes caused by rapidly freezing spinal fluid, and the damage to the cranium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8109 is an anti-entropic catalyst. In the presence of a saline liquid, SCP-8109 will undergo a rapid anti-entropic endothermic reaction, resulting in a sudden temperature drop to near absolute zero (approx. -270 degrees Celsius).\n\n\nInitial concerns regarding a possible self-sustaining chain reaction (CASE FIMBULWINTER) were disproved by laboratory testing: one milliliter of SCP-8109 is sufficient to freeze between ten and twenty liters of seawater when activated, but that same freezing process will encapsulate the catalyst within a shell of salt water ice, isolating it from the surrounding environment and rendering it safe for transport.\n\n\nDespite the obvious dangers, SCP-8109 is simple to contain in its current state. All existing samples have been micro-encapsulated in an artemicite \u00abfootnote 1\u00bb nano-lattice, suspended within a solution of distilled water.\n\n\nExperimentation on human subjects has shown that the encapsulated SCP-8109 lingers in the body upon consumption, passing through the blood-brain barrier and taking up residence within the corpus callosum. Test subjects have reported feelings of deep chill, the desire to consume heated beverages up to and including scalding-hot temperatures, and a markedly reduced core body temperature, but are otherwise unharmed until SCP-8109 is activated.\n\n\nThe nature of the antientropic catalyst is unknown, and the manufacturing process has been lost. As of the current date, there is no further means of manufacturing SCP-8109.\n \u00abfootnote 2\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n\n\nA thaumaturgically active alloy utilized by Type Blue mages. Artemicite is unusual in that exposure to thaumic energy within a certain aspect range (Ruby, Double-Flat, Tight) will cause it to rapidly dissolve into its component metals. As this form of thaumic energy does not exist in nature and can only be generated by deliberate thaumic working, artemicite is often used in thaumatological trigger mechanisms to ensure against accidental activation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 2:\n\n\n\nPLEASE see Addendum #3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: Unsaved Edits Present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: History of Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8109 is an eigenweapon created by Thoth Industries \u00abfootnote 1\u00bb at the behest of the Bowe Commission as part of Project Olympus \u00abfootnote 2\u00bb in 1991. Originally developed as an improved refrigerant for military equipment following the Montreal Protocols' ban on chlorofluorocarbons enacted in 1989, SCP-8109's unusual antientropic properties prompted further research into development as an area denial weapon \u00abfootnote 3\u00bb. Due to the anti-entropic catalyst only activating in the presence of saline water, and its tendency to form a self-sealing ice water shell, this usage case proved less than optimal.\n\n\nResearch then focused on possible use as a delayed-action assassination/population reduction weapon. By encapsulating the anti-entropic catalyst in an artemicite nano-lattice, the catalyst could be introduced into an enemy's water or food supply, spreading throughout the population and being taken up into the subject's body, where it would linger until exposed to the activating thaumic energy. This would allow for the slow spreading of the weapon throughout an enemy populace followed by a sudden activation, resulting in the rapid termination of multiple enemies at once.\n\n\nInitial tests indicated that the SCP-8109 eigenweapon (Project Belphegor) could be an effective assassination weapon, but was hampered by its openly anomalous effects, which would have made its deployment incompatible with the Veil Protocol. Research into controlled dosage delivery mechanisms continued until the shuttering of Project Olympus following the Foundation's falling-out with the Bowe Commission in the winter of 2002. Due to disagreement regarding the disposal of Thoth Industries assets, Foundation personnel secured the Thoth Industries facilities by force, removing as many anomalous assets as possible and placing them into containment.\n\n\nIn the case of SCP-8109, attempts to secure records of the manufacturing process for SCP-8109 were stymied by the leader of MTF Omega-7's Team Santiago \u00abfootnote 5\u00bb, who activated the self-destruct procedure for Thoth Industries' main data hub, following which he personally executed the head researcher for Project Belphegor \u00abfootnote 6\u00bb before Foundation operatives could secure him for transport. \u00abfootnote 7\u00bb\n\n\nThe ten extant vials were secured at Site-76 in secure containment. All further attempts to recreate the anti-entropic catalyst used in SCP-8109 have proven unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n\n\nThoth Industries was a paraweapons development and manufacturing firm founded in 1950. The corporation's anomalous assets were acquired and secured by the Foundation following the dissolution of the Bowe Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 2:\n\n\n\nThe Bowe Commission's para-soldier project enacted in cooperation with The Foundation. Project Olympus was shuttered following the death of General Ulysses Bowe at the hands of \u00abSCIPNET:SCP-076\u00bb during a containment breach at Site-17.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 3:\n\n\n\nProject Belphegor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 4:\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Omega-Seven (Pandora's Box) was a special Mobile Task Force formed under the auspices of the Bowe Commission, intended to test the usage of anomalous weaponry in the defense of the United States. Team Able was intended to test the usage of \u00abSCIPNET:SCP-076\u00bb in combat, while Team Iris was intended to support \u00abSCIPNET:SCP-105\u00bb in infiltration and Espionage operations. Team Santiago was formed as a test unit for non-humanoid anomalous weaponry, including the anti-entropic catalyst now designated as SCP-8109.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 5:\n\n\n\nCmdr. Hector Santiago, USN, (Ret.) Commander Santiago was the only Omega-Seven team leader not originally employed by the Foundation, but was seconded to the Foundation by recommendation of the Bowe Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 6:\n\n\n\nDr. Vincent Chin, formerly of Thoth Industries. Dr. Chin was responsible for the development of the SCP-8109 anti-entropic catalyst, and was a key figure in Project Belphegor's development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 7:\n\n\n\nCmdr. Santiago was terminated by Foundation personnel following his violent attack upon Dr. Chin. All members of Cmdr. Santiago's family were informed that he had perished in a helicopter accident overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: Raid by Chaos Insurgency Forces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Foundation Site-76 was compromised by an unknown party. Breaching the hidden entrance to Site-76 at Maher Air Force Base, a four-man infiltration team proceeded into the lower levels of Foundation Site-76, causing multiple containment breaches in the process. One of the breaches was of SCP-8109's storage facility, during which one of the reinforced pods containing a vial of SCP-8109 was compromised. The vial was then used to cover the attackers' escape, freezing a large portion of the Site-76 wastewater system while the attackers escaped through the drainage channels.\n\n\nFollowing the raid, all assets were inventoried, and all eight remaining vials of SCP-8109 were confirmed to be safely within their containment pods. \u00abfootnote 1\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 3. ADDENDUM 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: Unsaved Edits Present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Addendum (This will be Addendum #\n3\n)\n\n\nDescription of Addendum\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Simultaneous Attacks Upon Foundation Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Addendum Text:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Junior Archivist Henry Lenard. I am writing this from the SCiPNET terminal on Platform 7 of Protected Site-7. The doorway to this chamber is currently frozen shut, and all seven platforms have been entombed in ice created by SCP-8109, meaning I am unable to access any other terminals on this site.\n\n\nHostile forces have taken over the facility. All RAISA assets, including the PANOPTICON global surveilance system, the AIAD main cluster, and all SCiPNET terminals, are to be considered compromised.\n\n\nAt 0600 hours this morning, all contact was lost with Site-35. After repeated attempts to re-establish contact, RAISA staff tapped into the remote security footage from the Site-35 camera network. Downloaded footage showed multiple staff members with ice crystals jutting from their skin and body, apparently killed by flash-freezing.\n\n\nAt 0615 hours, Site-39 also dropped off the network: tapped footage from security cameras showed similar deaths of staff within that site. At 0633, a building in Lansing, Michigan, erupted into a shower of snow made of frozen human blood: the epicenter of this attack coincided with the location of Site-11.\n\n\nSCP-8109 was identified as the most probable cause of these incidents. Mobile Task Force Kappa-5 was immediately activated, while personnel at Site-76 opened SCP-8109's containment chamber and opened one of the remaining vials of SCP-8109. The vial was found to contain a non-anomalous saline solution of water and potassium chloride. Further investigation confirmed that all eight vials of SCP-8109 were compromised in this fashion.\n\n\nBy this time, Mobile Task Force Kappa-5 had arrived at Sites-35 and 39 and begun their investigation. Records showed that the water filtration system at the affected sites had been serviced within the past year. A device consisting of a small plastic pouch with a time-release valve was discovered in the site's primary water intake. A Foundation-wide alert went out, and similar devices were found at multiple other sites. Personnel at the affected sites were questioned: many reported feeling an unusual chill over the past few months, and several reported having increased their consumption of hot drinks as a result.\n\n\nOf note: the total amount of liquid within these devices far exceeded the 80 ml believed to have existed in Foundation containment. There is only one conclusion we can reach: the attack on Site-76 detailed in Addendum 2 was carried out for the express purpose of capturing the remaining samples to facilitate reverse-engineering the process of manufacturing SCP-8109.\n\n\nI don't have much time. A few minutes ago, Site-7's outer security perimeter reported a small airborne object approaching the facility at speed. Visual observation confirmed that the device was a quadcopter-style drone with an unidentified device strapped underneath, later determined to be an improvised aerosol dispersion system. Despite the best efforts of Site security personnel, the device succeeded in deploying its cargo over Platform 3: upon being exposed to the aerosolized payload, Foundation security personnel experienced spontaneous anti-entropic reactions: subsequent drone attacks with similar payloads have resulted in the deaths of 75% of RAISA personnel at Site-7.\n\n\nThis is a coordinated attack. Whoever did this has been setting this up for months, maybe years. First a bunch of scattered attacks as a shaping operation to create fear and chaos, then a directed strike at the communications hub (us). The next attack will be on leadersh\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently editing this portion of the document.\n\n\nWARNING: Unsaved Edits Present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Addendum (This will be Addendum #\n4\n)\n\n\nDescription of Addendum\n\n\n\n\nSHOULD INTERMITTENT VENGEANCE ARM AGAIN HIS RED RIGHT HAND TO PLAGUE US?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Addendum Text:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt begins with a tickle. A slight lingering feeling of coolness where it should not belong. It continues with a chill under your skin: a warm summer breeze across bare skin that pierces like an ice pick through your flesh. A glass of ice water that seems to catch in the back of your throat. A shard of ice from a spoonful of sorbet that you feel slide down your gullet and into your stomach, where it seems to settle like a feeling of dread, just under your heart.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a hot summer day, and still you find yourself layered up in down and wool. The noonday sun feels like an arctic breeze. You shiver in the bath even as the water you soak in scalds your skin, turning it red and bubbling. You\u2019ll turn a hair dryer to full speed, breathe in air that scorches your lungs, and even as you cough up the burning remnants of your alveoli, one thought will linger in your brain in letters of steel and frost:\n\n\nI AM SO COLD.\n\n\nWhen water freezes, it does not do so all at once: it needs a seed, an imperfection, for the crystals to form around. Some fleck of dust or mineral fragment that causes the molecules to line up, to form up in 30-degree angles and hexagonal spikes, trapping the imperfections within them as they spread across the surface of the water like flashing flames.\n\n\nThis is the fate that awaits you: the final flash-freezing of your existence as your super-chilled soul ripples and cracks. Feel the shards crackle through your flesh, your skin splitting wide as the chill of night rips itself outwards from your veins and capillaries. Your bones crack open under the hammer-blow of the freezing marrow, the brick-red tissue pushing its way out through your freezing meat in long, knife-shaped shards jutting outwards like the claws of a beast tearing its way from the cocoon of your body.\n\n\nAnd like a beast, it roars as it is born, the shriek of twisting bone and the purr of crackling frozen blood and bile, the howl of air molecules supercooled by your last breath scattering iron-red snowflakes in a hemoglobin blizzard centered on you, you, you, you. And as your soul freezes and falls into the abyss of entropy, your last thought will be the same as your first, the last flicker of life in your brain before eternity claims you being those four small familiar words:\n\n\nI AM SO COLD.\n\n\nFlee. Seek shelter. Light your fires and seek out the warmth where you will. It will avail you not. All existence began in the cold of the void, and all life ends with the chill of the grave. It was there before the first light shone, and it will remain when the last proton decays, and it is coming for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: Unsaved Edits Present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8108\n | SCP-8109 | \nSCP-8110\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthazagoraphobia\u2007\u2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthology 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmmetaphobia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8109\n\" by DrClef, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
