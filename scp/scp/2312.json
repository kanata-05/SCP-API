Areas with identified SCP-2312 instances are to be cordoned off under the pretence of a Cyprus Turkish Peace Force Command training area. In cooperation with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC)\n1\n government, appropriate counter-Extranormal Events measures are to be enacted against all 2312-Eris Events.\n\n\nUpdate (05/05/2004):\n TRNC's \nde facto\n sovereignty is to be upheld, as defined by the current borders claimed by it.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2312 refers to a series of carvings found on the surface of the Kyrenia Mountains referencing an individual named \"King Pan\" (designated SCP-2312-A); instances typically manifest once per month. SCP-2312 instances are written in Koine Greek, and styled as decrees from SCP-2312-A. Although its identity and existence cannot be ascertained, SCP-2312-A is inferred to be a monarch claiming rulership over a \"Kingdom of All Cypruses\".\n\n\nWhen an SCP-2312 instance manifests, a corresponding Extranormal Event will occur (designated 2312-Eris Event). All 2312-Eris Events are localised within TRNC-controlled territory. Removal of SCP-2312 does not prevent occurrence of 2312-Eris Events. Below are several examples of SCP-2312 instances and corresponding 2312-Eris Events; compilation is restricted to Level \u22653/2312 clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslated excerpt\n\n\n2312-Eris Event\n\n\nCover Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026All Cypruses shalt unite under I and render my crooked brother's singular Cyprus a petty kingdom\u2026\"\n2\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026let all Cypruses have meat\u2026\"\n\n\nFishes spontaneously rain over TRNC cities.\n\n\nFabrication of a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026scriptures of my benefactor \u2013 who gave me infinity \u2013 shalt spread to all Cypruses\u2026\"\n\n\nAdvertisements of \"Heavenly Antlers Properties\" are mailed to every TRNC household.\n\n\nPublicity stunt by author \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\u2026birds in flight \u2013 the pleasure of my deceiving brother \u2013 shalt be cast down\u2026\"\n\n\nAll birds within TRNC-controlled territory lost control over their wing muscles.

They were classified under SCP-2312 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1998, upon discovering a causality between SCP-2312 manifestations and 2312-Eris Events.\n\n\nAddendum 2312-1:\n Excerpt from \"Heavenly Antlers Properties\" Ad\n\n\n\n\nGot the short end of the family inheritance?
