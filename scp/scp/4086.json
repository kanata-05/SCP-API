On a monthly interval, no less than 908 kilograms of living biological material is to be dumped into SCP-4086. Any individuals attempting to enter SCP-4086 through either the intake or the outlet are to be apprehended and turned over to Federal Authorities to be charged with \u201ctrespassing on United States property\u201d. Any biological research that is attempted within the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n reservoir or the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n river immediately after the dam is to be obtained by embedded Foundation personnel working within the Bureau of Reclamation for alteration of the biological statistics. No further explorations by human test subjects are permitted due to the dangerous nature of SCP-4086-1 and inability to retrieve test subjects from SCP-4086-1. Any growths of SCP-4086 that are discovered outside of its location at \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Dam are to be sealed off immediately after discovery.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4086 is the concrete ring gate spillway of the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Dam located in \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n, Oregon. The structure has a vertical drop of 300m from the crest of the intake to a 90-degree elbow bend which leads to a 200m long discharge tunnel. No unusual materials or substances have been observed to be included in the construction of SCP-4086. Under normal operating conditions, water from the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n reservoir will enter the intake of SCP-4086 and continue through the tunnel system until it is discharged from the outlet at the foot of the Dam along with any debris that may be in the water with the exception of living organisms. Any living organism that enters the intake of SCP-4086 in an unrestrained free fall state of motion vanishes after reaching terminal velocity into SCP-4086-1. SCP-4086-1 is a level III space-time anomaly which activates when living biological matter enters its field traveling at terminal velocity relative to the earth\u2019s gravitational pull. Test subjects who have entered SCP-4086-1 have reported a vast network of tunnels and pitfalls similar to the design of most spillways on modern dam structures. This network of tunnels floods violently and quickly roughly every hour according to the start of when the subject first enters SCP-4086-1. The tunnels quickly drain through the numerous pits located throughout the labyrinth within a span of minutes. It is not currently understood how such a large volume of water is moved either upwards or downwards throughout SCP-4086-1. No organism that has entered SCP-4086-1 has been able to be recovered.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-4086\u2019s anomalous qualities were discovered by the Foundation on September 18, 19\n\u2588\u2588\n, when an embedded agent in the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Police Department received a call from an unidentified male individual notifying them of his intentions to end his life by jumping into the mouth of the intake of SCP-4086. When officials arrived to the location, the victim was observed jumping into the mouth of the spillway. Efforts to recover the remains of the presumed deceased individual were not successful, and forensic analysis of the bottom of the intake shaft showed no trace of blood or other indicators that a body had made impact within the area. It should be noted that the reservoir was 1m below the crest of the spillway at the time of the incident. Agent \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n, who was one of the first responders, relayed the details of the occurrence to Foundation personnel. Diversion and investigation team Beta-9 \u201cBusy Beavers\u201d were sent from area \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n under the guise of employees from the Bureau of Reclamation and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, who then assumed control of the scene.\n\n\nThree explorations (Documents SCP-4086-DI, SCP-4086-DII, and SCP-4086-DIII respectively) were successfully conducted into SCP-4086-1. Transcripts of explorations into SCP-4086-1 are available for review by Authorized personnel.\n\n\nFrom the last few frames of video that were received in Document SCP-4086-DIII, it appears that the tunnel that A-978 was sucked into had teeth of some form lining the tunnel walls pointing further down the tunnel. It is unsure whether the teeth were made of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n or made of the same materials that the rest of SCP-4086-1 is made of.\n\n\nTwo months after the fish screen was installed over the top of SCP-4086, several reports were received by the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n Police Department of 4 missing municipal sanitation workers who were last reported doing work in the storm systems of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n City in Oregon. Six more municipal workers entered the tunnels where the 4 men were lost and after 6 hours, only 3 of the six workers exited the storm system. They reported that they found a tunnel system that did not exist on the City infrastructure map, and after entering the tunnel, a surge of water washed away 3 of the men. Beta-9 was promptly deployed to the scene and obtained control of the investigation. It was confirmed that the undocumented tunnels were involved with SCP-4086-1 after a sample of the tunnel wall was taken and compared with the concrete of the original structure of SCP-4086 along with its design elements. Beta-9 noted that there were no significant drops encountered in the storm system, which would have provided a free fall state that would have enabled entrance into SCP-4086-1. In an attempt to halt the spread of SCP-4086 further outside of its known locations, the fish screen was removed from SCP-4086. An investigation into the storm system of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n City 6 months after the removal of the screen found an additional 4 undocumented tunnels had appeared.\n\n\nTwo similar reports of missing persons inside of drainage systems are being investigated currently in relation to SCP-4086-1. One investigation is under way in Las Vegas, Nevada and the other in New York City, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4086-DI\n\n\nD-5850 is a Caucasian male, 38 years of age. D-5850 has a history of reckless self-endangerment along with an inclination to impress his peers by performing dangerous stunts. D-5850 Was given a standard issue foundation reconnaissance pack and outfitted with a wireless camera transmitter and two flashlights with spare batteries. Subject was briefed about his task to enter SCP-4086-1.\n\n\nBegin Transcript:\n\n\nD-5850:\n Why can\u2019t you guys just lower me down by ropes? I don\u2019t get it, this is insane, this is a death wish!\n\n\nDr Richards:\n we have already informed you of the circumstances D-5850, you don\u2019t need to worry about your safety regarding the drop.\n\n\nD-5850:\n I know what you said guy, but I don\u2019t see you standing over this massive hole smiling and getting ready to jump! I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n You don\u2019t have a choice D-5850, it\u2019s either comply, or face termination. If you like, we could have a guard \u201cassist\u201d you over the railing.\n\n\nD-5850:\n No guy, don\u2019t touch me. Is everything working before I do it?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n yes, everything is functioning properly, you may proceed.\n\n\nD-5850:\n OK then\u2026\n\n\nD-5850 seems to take a moment breathing heavily and leaning forward then back several times, then lets one foot over the platform and steps off. The camera feed goes dark and activates to night vision very quickly as D-5850 plummets down SCP-4086. The camera feed experiences a couple of seconds of intense static feedback as D-5850 enters SCP-4086-1. D-5850 is heard to gasp louder and louder as the sound of air rushes through the microphone. There is a sound of impact made with loose material and a loud \u201coomph\u201d from D-5850 approximately 13 seconds after leaving the observation platform.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n D-5850, are you alright? Can you hear us?\n\n\nD-5850:\n *gagging and coughing* what IS THIS?! It smells like death down here!\n\n\nDr Richards:\n D-5850 please confirm that you can hear us and that you are unharmed.\n\n\nD-5850:\n yes I can hear you. I landed on rocks or something down here.\n\n\nD-5850 shines his shoulder mounted light downwards to reveal a large mound of rotting fish corpses along with other wildlife carcasses.\n\n\nD-5850:\n What is all this? Why are all of these dead fish down here?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Never mind that, could you please angle the camera upwards and tell us what you see?\n\n\nD-5850:\n It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s pitch black up there, I don\u2019t see the sky or anything. Hey Doctor, I didn\u2019t fall down THAT far did I? Shouldn\u2019t I still see sunlight or something?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n You\u2019ve apparently entered another plane of reality D-5850, in a place such as where you are right now, you will likely encounter many things we consider to be abnormal. Please continue exploring.\n\n\nD-5850:\n Fine guy, but no tricks! If I see any kind of strange stuff that looks too dangerous, then I\u2019m out and done, you understand?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please proceed D-5850\n\n\nD-5850 proceeds to clamber down the mound of carcasses to the bottom of the elbow section. He shines his light down what would be the discharge tunnel.\n\n\nD-5850:\n Something doesn\u2019t feel right down here doctor. I feel out of place, like I\u2019m lost. And this darkness seems a lot thicker than normal. My light is on full power and I can only see about 5 meters in front of me. What else is down here guy?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n You are the first person to be relaying information back to us about SCP-4086-1 from within, we do not have any answers for you at this time, please continue.\n\nD-5850 begins walking for about 20 minutes until he enters a large rectangular room. Facing him from the opposite wall are 4 separate tunnels each about 2 meters in diameter. A faint rumbling noise can be heard emanating from each tunnel. The floor and bottoms of the tunnels are wet and there is significant growth of algae and other fungi along the floors and walls.\n\n\nD-5850:\n The floor is getting wet the further that I go. It's pretty slick in a lot of places. Also, there is a faint roaring noise coming from the tunnels, but it's far, like way deep in there. Which tunnel do you want me to go down?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please explore the rightmost tunnel. Proceed with caution.\n\n\nD-5850 begins walking down the tunnel furthest to the right and shortly encounters a \u201cY\u201d junction in the tunnel.\n\n\nD-5850:\n Left or right guy?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please take the left Tunnel.\n\n\nD-5850 proceeds to the left tunnel and after about 5 minutes of walking comes to a smooth right turn in the tunnel, another 2 minutes of walking leads to a smooth left turn and then 5 minutes later a \u201cT\u201d intersection, D-5850 pauses here.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n proceed left with caution.\n\n\nD-5850 takes the left-hand turn and walks for another 10 minutes passing many smaller side tunnels until he meets with another \u201cY\u201d junction. The ambient rumbling noise grows louder gradually.\n\n\nD-5850:\n Hey, there have been a lot of smaller side tunnels that I\u2019ve been seeing as I walk, do you want to see what\u2019s in those at all?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n For now, please continue down the primary tunnel systems. Take the Right tunnel.\n\n\nD-5850:\n OK\u2026\n\n\nD-5850 continues forward for another 5 minutes until reaching another \u201cY\u201d junction.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Left.\n\n\nD-5850 begins to walk into the left-hand tunnel. The roaring noise has grown significantly louder. The tunnel turns abruptly left and after a few seconds, opens up into a cement room approximately 9 meters in diameter with a domed ceiling approximately 6 meters to the top. In the center of the room is a pit identical to the intake of SCP-4086.\n\n\nD-5850:\n That noise is coming from down there Doctor. It sounds like water moving back and forth, but really deep. I mean it is WAY down there.\n\n\nD-5850 attempts to shine his light down the pit but is unable to see anything.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please remove a glow stick from your pack and activate it and drop it down the pit.\n\n\nD-5850 takes a moment to get a glow stick and crack it, then shake it and toss it down the pit. Roughly 25 seconds pass before a deep splashing noise is heard reverberating up the pit.\n\n\nD-5850:\n That is a LONG way down. I\u2019m not staying around here; this thing makes me nervous.\n\n\nD-5850 begins to walk out of the room when the rumbling noise begins to grow even louder. A deep rushing noise is heard emanating from behind D-5850, and the air begins to rush quickly out from behind D-5850.\n\n\nD-5850:\n Hey guys something is happening here. I\u2019ve got a really bad feeling about this!\n\n\nD-5850 turns just in time to see water erupt out of the pit in the room that he just left.\n\n\nD-5850:\n WHOA!\n\n\nD-5850 begins sprinting back the way that he came passing the first \u201cY\u201d junction.\n\n\nD-5850:\n IT\u2019S FLOODING! IT\u2019S ALL FLOODING! I CAN FEEL THE AIR RUSHING FROM EVERY TUNNEL BEHIND ME! IT\u2019S COLD! THE AIR IS GETTING A LOT COLDER!\n\n\nAS D-5850 approaches the second \u201cY\u201d junction, the water overtakes him and washes his feet from under him. D-5850 struggles against the water but within a minute his movements cease as hypothermia sets in. The current sweeps his body through the tunnels until it is indiscernible where he is anymore. The current begins to change directions and the camera flows down the tunnels until the current picks up significantly. The water is seen to be sucked down a pit similar to the first one discovered by D-5850 at an incredibly fast rate. The camera is ripped from the body of D-5850 and no further footage is discernible due to a lack of light. After approximately 20 seconds of darkness, the video feed goes to static and never reconnects.\n\n\nEnd Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4086-DII\n\n\nD-3246 is a Latino male, age 24. Subject has extensive experience with regards to navigating underground drainage tunnels due to a childhood spent primarily living in the sewer and storm systems of Cali, Columbia. D-3246 has been given a wet suit and a small oxygen respirator in addition to a standard issue foundation reconnaissance pack and a wireless camera and two flashlights with spare batteries. A wall anchor system has also been provided to D-3246 in the event of flooding. D-3246 has been briefed on the conditions of SCP-4086-1.\n\n\nBegin Transcript:\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Are you ready to make the drop D-3246?\n\n\nD-3246:\n If you people want to kill me, just use one of your guns. Doesn\u2019t the constitution say something about no cruel or unusual punishment?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n This isn\u2019t a punishment D-3246, this is an agreement that you made with the Foundation. One month of absolute obedient service to the Foundation in exchange for your freedom and all charges against you dropped. This is a fair price for such an offer.\n\n\nD-3246:\n You don\u2019t really expect me to just throw myself down there do you? I may be desperate, but I\u2019m no idiot.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Whenever you\u2019re ready D-3246, just remember that the longer you wait, the more likely that I am to invalidate our agreement and send you out for termination.\n\n\nD-3246:\n OK, OK, give it a rest. I\u2019m going already. I still don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t even have a bungee cable or something as a backup.\n\n\nD-3246 stands at the edge of the observation platform for about 5 minutes with no movement.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n We are waiting D-3246!\n\n\nD-3246:\n This isn\u2019t that easy as AAAYYYYY!!!!!\n\n\nAs D-3246 began to retort to Dr Richards a guard came from behind and assisted D-3246 off the observation platform and into SCP-4086. The camera feed from D-3246 quickly entered night vision mode and within seconds returned static feedback as D-3246 entered SCP-4086-1. 13 seconds pass as D-3246 screams at the top of his lungs until he crashes into the pile of rotting fish and other wildlife discovered by D-5850. The subject quickly uprights himself, shaking violently.\n\n\nD-3246:\n I\u2019ll kill whoever just did that to me. I\u2019ll find you and *heavy gagging sounds and coughing are heard through the microphone* OH! That stench! What is that smell?!\n\n\nDr Richards:\n you are currently standing on a sizeable mound of rotting animals. You may proceed down the tunnel presently.\n\n\nD-3246:\n hey, how are you guys going to get me out of here? I don\u2019t see the top of this thing. No light or nothing!\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Your primary concern is to go where you are directed to go and do what you are directed to do. Please proceed down the tunnel.\n\n\nD-3246 checks his shoulder mounted light to ensure that it is on full brightness, then begins walking down the mound and into the tunnel. D-3246 enters the first rectangular room with 4 separate tunnels on the opposing wall and is instructed to enter the middle left tunnel.\n\n\nD-3246:\n what\u2019s down the other tunnels?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n If there is enough time, you will show us.\n\n\nD-3246 begins walking down the middle left tunnel and after several minutes of walking comes to \u201cY\u201d junction. He is instructed to take the left pathway, which he does. D-3246 soon encounters several smaller off branching tunnels. At this point, D-3246 remarks about the sound of rumbling in the deep.\n\n\nD-3246:\n I know that sound. These tunnels are active. The water isn\u2019t coming down from up there is it?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n No D-3246, the water in the Lake is several meters below the spill level of SCP-4086.\n\n\nD-3246:\n These tunnels slope downwards the further that I go. Water wouldn\u2019t be draining uphill, what is that sound coming from Doctor?\n\n\nDr Richards:\n There are several pits that we have seen in these tunnels from a previous expedition, water appears to be active at the bottoms of these shafts. Please have your wall anchor and respirator ready in case you encounter water. Proceed with caution.\n\n\nD-3246 continues exploring the tunnels, entering one of the smaller side tunnels, having to crouch to navigate through it. The rushing sound of water stays at relatively the same level. D-3246 comments on the slickness of the floor due to algae and slime, but otherwise remains silent as he travels deeper into the tunnels. Eventually, he exits the smaller tunnel into another 2 meter wide tunnel.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n D-3246, please use a piece of tape to mark the tunnel that you just exited.\n\n\nD-3246 applies a length of duct tape to the top of the side tunnel before continuing down the tunnel system. He turns a corner and finds a tunnel that is steeply sloped at an increasing angle until the angle becomes vertical and the tunnel slopes into a vertical shaft. The rumbling noise has turned into a low roar.\n\n\nD-3246:\n I Don\u2019t think I\u2019m going THAT way.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please remove a disposable object of reasonable weight from your backpack and toss it down the hole.\n\n\nD-3246 removes a pair of binoculars from his pack and tosses them down the shaft. They skid down the floor of the slide like structure before falling. Approximately 35 seconds pass before a plopping sound is heard echoing back up the walls of the pit.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Please return quickly to the side tunnel that you entered from earlier.\n\n\nD-3246 hastily makes his way back to the smaller tunnel marked by duct tape and begins crawling through. It takes a few minutes for him to shuffle to the other side. As D-3246 enter the initial main tunnel and begins heading further down it, he stops abruptly.\n\n\nD-3246:\n Something's happening, there\u2019s water coming down the tunnels, I can feel the air moving!\n\n\nThe rumbling in the deep begins to grow louder and louder.\n\n\nDr Richards:\n Use your wall anchor to secure yourself to the tunnel wall and activate your oxygen respirator. Prepare for water impact.\n\n\nD-3246:\n This is CRAZY! I\u2019M GOING TO DIE DOWN HERE!\n\n\nD-3246 manages to use the wall anchor and attach himself to the wall and place the respirator in his mouth just as a wall of water becomes visible about 5 meters away. The water hits D-3246 with substantial force and for approximately 5 minutes is whipped about helplessly by the current. Suddenly, the water changes direction and begins flowing just as strongly in the opposite direction. Approximately 5 minutes pass and then the water recedes. D-3246 gets up and in a panic, rips off his wall anchor and begins running upstream of the tunnel. It is unclear the direct route that he takes due to water on the camera lens and multiple moments of darkness as his flashlight becomes covered. Dr Richards tries to reassure D-3246 but with no response. D-3246 turns a corner and slips on the slick floor. He falls to the ground but is unable to bring himself fully to a stop before sliding down a steep tunnel. His screams do not quite drown out the growing rumble that indicates that he is sliding towards a pit. The camera jerks upwards just long enough to see a pit approximately 3m in diameter in a room roughly 4 meters away. D-3246\u2019s arms are seen scratching frantically as he slides towards the open hole. Just before D-3246 goes completely over the edge, the footage shows his fingers catch a crack or ridge on the floor and he is able to stop himself from sliding into the chasm.\n\n\nD-3246:\n HELP ME! PLEASE! GET ME OUT OF HERE! PLEASE! HELP! HELP! HELP!\n\n\nD-3246 continues to scream for help with Dr Richards unable to communicate with him. After roughly 6 minutes of D-3246 struggling to pull himself out of the hole, He apparently manages to swing his leg up onto the lip of the pit, and at the same time, knocking loose the camera secured to his shoulder. The last footage that is seen is of a few glimpses of the shrinking light of D-3246 as he dangles at the lip of the shaft before the transmission cuts out. Communication was never reestablished with D-3246.\n\n\nEnd Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4086-DIII\n\n\nA-978 is a state-of-the-art android with the designed purpose of exploring and collecting data within SCPs deemed too hazardous for human test subjects. It is assumed that since SCP-4086-1 will accept non-biological material if it is within close proximity of living biological material, that A-978 will be able to successfully enter and explore SCP-4086-1. A-978 is equipped with a hyper frequency video transmitter for long range data transmission, along with special grappling systems which will prove useful for scaling the pits found within SCP-4086-1. A-978 has a battery life of 72 hours without energy intake. A retrieval cable is also attached to A-978 as an attempt at recovery.\n\n\nBegin transcript:\n\n\nA-978 is activated and walks to the edge of the observation platform. It jumps from the platform after a brief system check and encounters no static video feedback as it enters SCP-4086-1. Upon landing, A-978 scans the area and it is found that the retrieval cable has been severed. A-978 detaches the severed cable from itself. Further inspection of the surroundings reveals the remains of D-5850. The corpse shows signs that it has been mostly digested rather than decomposing due to exposure of the body to water. A-978 proceeds down the tunnel system and enters the middle left tunnel in the hopes of finding D-3246 if he survived by some means. Upon entering the tunnel, major differences in air pressure are detected by sensors on A-978 and accordingly a brace for impact is made by grappling to the floor. In approximately 23 seconds, the roaring sound increases until a wall of water is viewed racing towards A-978, which is unaffected by the current. After the water recedes, A-978 continues down the tunnel until a pit is encountered. There are no signs of D-3246 having been through the area. At this point, a video relay device is applied to the side of the pit and A-978 begins to grapple its way down the hole. Approximately 2/3 of the way down, the water at the bottom of the pit begins to surge, and A-978 braces for impact. The Rushing water does not affect the android, and the grapple is completed into the bottom of the pit which opens up into a large circular chamber. It is difficult to discern from the footage what the source of the water is due to its intense waves and motion from seemingly all directions. The water level itself appears to be about waist deep to A-978 and no variations in depth are immediately noticeable. A-978 begins to walk slowly forward and soon finds what appears to be a submerged tunnel which is situated halfway on the floor and halfway on the wall. The tunnel seems to slope downwards rapidly and night vision from the retinal cameras are unable to make out much detail from the depths. A-978 looks along the wall further until it discerns movement not associated with water. Upon closer inspection, A leg and arm appear to be protruding from the wall, despite being made of solid concrete. A scan of some tattooing on the hand confirm that it is the body of D-3246. A-978 is given commands to return to the entry point for retrieval. Before A-978 can begin the ascent back up the shaft, a violent current sweeps A-978 off the ground and it collides into the wall. A vortex begins to form where a portion of the wall meets the water approximately 3m from A-978, and the current draws A-978 into the vortex. The camera feed goes to static 4 seconds after A-978 is sucked underwater. No further transmissions were received from A-978.\n\n\nEnd Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4085\n | SCP-4086 | \nSCP-4087\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4086\n\" by Researcher Durham, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-4086 is to be fitted with a fish screen and monitored by Foundation personnel stationed at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Dam. On a monthly interval, no less than 908 kilograms of living biological material is to be dumped into SCP-4086. Any individuals attempting to enter SCP-4086 through either the intake or the outlet are to be apprehended and turned over to Federal Authorities to be charged with \u201ctrespassing on United States property\u201d. Any biological research that is attempted within the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reservoir or the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 river immediately after the dam is to be obtained by embedded Foundation personnel working within the Bureau of Reclamation for alteration of the biological statistics. No further explorations by human test subjects are permitted due to the dangerous nature of SCP-4086-1 and inability to retrieve test subjects from SCP-4086-1. Any growths of SCP-4086 that are discovered outside of its location at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Dam are to be sealed off immediately after discovery.",
    "description": "SCP-4086 is the concrete ring gate spillway of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Dam located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oregon. The structure has a vertical drop of 300m from the crest of the intake to a 90-degree elbow bend which leads to a 200m long discharge tunnel. No unusual materials or substances have been observed to be included in the construction of SCP-4086. Under normal operating conditions, water from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reservoir will enter the intake of SCP-4086 and continue through the tunnel system until it is discharged from the outlet at the foot of the Dam along with any debris that may be in the water with the exception of living organisms. Any living organism that enters the intake of SCP-4086 in an unrestrained free fall state of motion vanishes after reaching terminal velocity into SCP-4086-1. SCP-4086-1 is a level III space-time anomaly which activates when living biological matter enters its field traveling at terminal velocity relative to the earth\u2019s gravitational pull. Test subjects who have entered SCP-4086-1 have reported a vast network of tunnels and pitfalls similar to the design of most spillways on modern dam structures. This network of tunnels floods violently and quickly roughly every hour according to the start of when the subject first enters SCP-4086-1. The tunnels quickly drain through the numerous pits located throughout the labyrinth within a span of minutes. It is not currently understood how such a large volume of water is moved either upwards or downwards throughout SCP-4086-1. No organism that has entered SCP-4086-1 has been able to be recovered.",
