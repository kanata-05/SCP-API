Galileo.aic is also tasked with monitoring social media and video-sharing platforms for any mention of SCP-5106, or its associated activity. All evidence is to be discredited or removed, and all direct witnesses are to be amnesticized.\n\n\nIf SCP-5106 is located, a joint task force comprised of \nMTF Eta-4 (\"Begone Thoth\")\n and MTF Victor-17 (\u201cNature Boys\u201d) members is to track and attempt to contain the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-5106 is an avian entity resembling a Canada Goose (\nBranta canadensis\n), capable of communication in fluent English. SCP-5106 has heightened intelligence, though the extent of its cognitive capabilities is unknown. SCP-5106 displays a rudimentary understanding of subterfuge, slang terminology, interpersonal relations, and the barter system.\n\n\nSCP-5106 is capable of commanding non-anomalous fauna to follow basic commands. It is unknown whether SCP-5106 uses some form of anomalous influence or if faunae follow the orders of their own volition. Though the full extent of this ability is unknown, SCP-5106 seems incapable of using it to affect humans and other species of higher intellect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nSCP-5106 was initially discovered by civilians within Cattus Island State Park in Toms River, New Jersey. Following a drastic increase in theft-related incident reports, patrons of the park began reporting strange behavior in the local avian population. On 2020/08/13, a video depicting SCP-5106 related activity was uploaded to the media-sharing platform YouTube. The following is a transcript of the aforementioned video evidence which was flagged and transcribed by Galileo.aic:\n\n\n\n\n\u274f\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a05106/1\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a05106/1\u00a0\u2750\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2020/08/13\n\n\nDepicted:\n Carlos Vega (M 18), Randall White (M 19)\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Carlos Vega is walking in front of the camera through a dimly lit playground.]\n\n\nCarlos:\n Man, when you said we was goin' to see the birds, this isn't what I thought you meant.\n\n\nRandall:\n Nah dude, I told you, the birds sold me this camera.\n\n\nCarlos:\n The fuck you mean though?\n\n\nRandall:\n I was eating lunch with Daniele over there. \n[Randall points around the camera toward a pavilion in the distance]\n and a fuckin' goose came up offering to sell us an iPhone, and I didn\u2013\n\n\nCarlos:\n How's a goose offering you shit, bro?

After removing a pocket knife from Carlos's left sock, the squirrels retreat back into the trees.]\n\n\nCarlos:\n On some real shit\u2013 did I just get robbed by a bunch of squirrels?\n\n\nRandall:\n I don\u2013\n\n\nSCP-5106:\n Don't worry, they'll give it back when we're done with our transaction.\n\n\n[SCP-5106 is seen entering the clearing encircled by eight Canadian geese.]\n\n\nSCP-5106:\n How can we help you, boys?\n\n\n[Several of the geese honk in the two men's direction.

Randall rips the bread into small chunks and spreads them on the ground. SCP-5106 and the other geese honk and flap their wings; in unison, they swarm and consume the bread pieces. After finishing the bread, SCP-5106 and its geese fly away.]\n\n\nCarlos:\n That\u2013 that was some, I don't ev\u2013 who the fuck's gonna believe this shit.\n\n\n[Randall shakes the camera towards Carlos.]\n\n\nRandall:\n Everyone, man, I got that shit on here.\n\n\n[The two men walk out of the clearing and back through the underbrush.]\n\n\nCarlos:\n Yeah but, even on film, I don't know if I'd believe that shit\u2013 and I was there, man.\n\n\nRandall:\n Yeah, we'll see.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a brief investigation to confirm anomalous activity, the Foundation deployed a two-man detachment of MTF Victor-17 with a five-member avian pursuit team as support.

Finch and Crane are to remain hidden in the tree line for SCP-5106 to appear, at which time it will be tranquilized. Avian Unit 3 will remain on standby within the treetop and will pursue SCP-5106 if it attempts to escape.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Agents Finch and Crane are crouched in the underbrush facing towards SCP-5106's clearing.]\n\n\nFinch:\n How long is this gonna take? Do you think they're on to us, Crane?\n\n\nCrane:\n No, I don't think so, the bird unit hasn't noted any movement.\n\n\nFinch:\n Maybe they're off trying to sell people stolen junk.\n\n\n[Both agents laugh.]\n\n\nCrane:\n What a fuckin job.\n\n\nFinch:\n You can say that again. Shit, this is probably one of the least weird cases we've had in months.\n\n\nCrane:\n Yeah, I know\u2013\n\n\nFinch:\n Shhh. Look, over there.\n\n\n[Finch points towards the western end of the clearing, movement can be seen in the underbrush. A total of 14 geese exit the tree line and enter the clearing.]\n\n\nCrane:\n That trap isn't holding all of them. How many tranq rounds do we have?\n\n\nFinch:\n Five.\n\n\nCrane:\n Shit, run back to the truck, grab another case of rounds. And be quick about it, we don't want them getting spooked.\n\n\nFinch:\n You got it.\n\n\n[Finch crawls through the brush for several meters before standing and running towards the truck.]\n\n\nFinch:\n Just cause he's old as shit I gotta do the grunt work\u2013\n\n\n[Agent Finch stops several meters from the truck, the back doors are open and a large quantity of geese footprints can be seen on the ground. Finch quickly sprints to the back end of the truck and looks inside.]\n\n\nFinch:\n \n[Over radio.]\n Uh, Crane, we got a problem.\n\n\n[The truck previously filled with various equipment is now empty; the five parrots composing Avian Unit 3 are unconscious and bound together with vines.]\n\n\nCrane:\n \n[Over radio.]\n Hurry up, I think they're on to us.\n\n\nFinch:\n \n[Over radio.]\n Avian Unit 3 is down, and I\u2013 I think we've been robbed.\n\n\n[Finch unties the unconscious parrots.]\n\n\nCrane:\n \n[Over radio.]\n What?\n\n\nFinch:\n \n[Over radio.]\n All of our equipment is gone!\n\n\nCrane:\n \n[Over radio.]\n Those little fucks! Get back here.\n\n\nFinch:\n \n[Over radio.]\n Coming.\n\n\nCrane:\n \n[Over radio.]\n I'm sending a backup request to command.\n\n\n[Agent Finch sprints back to Crane.]\n\n\nFinch\n What's the plan?\n\n\nCrane:\n We don't even know if one of them is the one we need. If we scare them off we won't have a pursuit team.\n\n\nFinch:\n Why don't one of us wait here and the other go out there and try talking to them? If one of them answers we shoot that one with the tranq.\n\n\nCrane:\n Since backup is 40 minutes out, it's worth a shot.\n\n\nFinch:\n OK, take this.\n\n\n[Agent Finch hands Crane the tranquilizer rifle. Finch stands and walks into the clearing.]\n\n\nFinch:\n Okay, guys, looks like we got off on the wrong foot, how about we just talk this out?\n\n\n[The geese immediately face Finch and begin to honk.]\n\n\nFinch:\n I know at least one of you can talk\u2013 let's just work this out.\n\n\nSCP-5106:\n I think this has worked out just fine for us.\n\n\nCrane:\n Finch, I can't tell which one is talking\u2013 you gotta get it to step out of the group.\n\n\nFinch:\n As far as I can tell you're a business ma\u2013 goose, so let's do business.\n\n\n[One of the geese steps from the group, a black rectangular object can be seen on its back.]\n\n\nSCP-5106:\n Okay then, let's make a de\u2013\n\n\n[Crane fires two tranquilizer rounds into the goose after several seconds of stumbling the goose falls to the ground. The remaining geese fly away in response.]\n\n\nCrane:\n Got it.\n\n\n[Crane exits the treeline and the two Agents approach the fallen goose.]\n\n\nSCP-5106:\n Only thing you got was played! \n[Various honks can be heard in the background.]\n\n\nFinch:\n What the fuck\u2026\n\n\n[Finch pushes the goose over revealing a Foundation issued handheld radio attached to its back. Honking can be heard from above. The two Agents look up in time to see a Foundation issue electrified capture net falling on them.]\n\n\nCrane:\n Ah shit.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Team Alpha 4 arrived within a half-hour; the two MTF Victor-17 agents were discovered unconscious within the clearing.
