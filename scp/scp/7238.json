We use our anomalous gifts to create art that could not exist without us, art that questions the foundational assumptions society works off of, art that will revolutionize the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Are We?\n\n\n\n\nWe are artists. Independent thinkers. Rebels against the status quo. We see the potential, and we seize it. Morality? Weakness? Boredom? Non-coolness? We reject it all, eschewing the shackles of commercial art, and elevating ourselves into a higher state of being.\n\n\nWe are the Artists and the World is Our Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJoin AWCY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you want to be part of our collective of artists across the globe, creating revolutionary works of art? No problem, we'd love to have you in our community!\n\n\nTo join, you must meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently of consenting age;\n1\n\n\nYou are willing to get a tattoo as a part of your initiation;\n\n\nYou are currently not, nor have ever been an employee of The Foundation, Foundation subsidiaries, or any other normalcy organizations;\n\n\nYou create art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you meet the above qualifications, you can submit your application using the link below! (Please note: There is a mandatory application fee.)\n\n\n\n\nJoin AWCY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMeet The Arts Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nArts Council\n is formed of the top anomalous artists throughout this universe and beyond. We are a trusted group of cultural leaders, influential artists, established patrons and the original founding members of \nAre We Cool Yet\n, who guide our collective towards greatness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a council of experts, each with our own laundry list of accolades, artworks and insights - together we shape what our collective is, by coordinating events, allocating funds, planning exhibitions and more!\n\n\nMembership to the Arts Council is offered to members on a case-by-case basis, and happens once per year during the \nInduction Ceremony\n.\n\n\nThe Arts Council focuses on keeping our artist collective running smoothly, another individual makes the decisions for the direction and mission of \nAre We Cool Yet\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Critic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImogen Harper, The Critic (2008-2010)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Who Is 'The Critic?'\n\n\nThe Critic is an appointed position that determines the overall vision, mission and message of \nAre We Cool Yet\n. They are chosen on the retirement of the former Critic, selected from who we feel are the most promising up-and-coming artists, revolutionizing the anomalous art world.\n\n\n \n\n\nFormer Critics have been undiscovered maestros, reclusive artistic hermits, Deer College Students, mothers, conceptual beings and more! We are always looking for new potential candidates for the position of Critic, so who knows, YOU might be next\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWant to see more, Doctor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
