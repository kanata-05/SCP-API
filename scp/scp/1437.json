Any trespassers attempting to access SCP-1437 are to be brought into custody, interrogated, and if found to be ignorant of SCP-1437's nature, dosed with a Class-A amnestic and released.\n\n\nAny items or organisms which emerge from SCP-1437 are to be immediately tested for hazards, and if found safe, examined further. Experimentation involving SCP-1437 is strictly forbidden.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1437 is an apparently endless hole measuring 3m x 3m, located in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Desert. Attempts to dig into SCP-1437 from the side result in the diggers encountering solid rock where logic would dictate SCP-1437 would be. SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground.\n\n\nSCP-1437 appears to be an access point to an as-of-yet unknown number of parallel universes. Objects have been known to periodically emerge from SCP-1437 at great speeds, including:\n\n\n\n\nOne (1) US quarter. (First known object emergence.)\n\n\nLarge quantities of dirt and rocks. (Believed to be an attempt by a parallel containment team to fill in their corresponding SCP-1437.)\n\n\nA map of North America written in Spanish. (According to said map, the government of North America is \"La Rep\u00fablica Popular de Aguas Nuevas\", or \"The People's Republic of New Waters\".)\n\n\nA photograph of a skyline, believed to be a radically altered version of New York's. (Structures resembling coral are visible and a large flying organism can be seen in the distance.)\n\n\nSeveral disks made from solid gold. (Accompanying the disks was a sheet of paper reading 'PLEASE SEND RAIN'.)\n\n\n\n\nDuring a period lasting from 200\u2588-20\u2588\u2588, numerous individuals, most of whom wore D-class uniforms, emerged from SCP-1437; all of them were dead on arrival.\n1\n All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes' documentation on SCP-1437.

Any authorized tours of the area are to be accompanied by two (2) security officers for their own protection. Taking of photographs is to be permitted. Any citizens attempting to go past safety fencing are to be arrested and handed over to local law enforcement.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1437 is an apparently endless hole measuring 10m x 10m, located in the town of Promise. Attempts to dig into SCP-1437 from the side result in the diggers encountering solid rock where logic would dictate SCP-1437 would be. SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground.\n\n\nSCP-1437 appears to be an access point to an as-of-yet unknown number of parallel universes. Objects have been known to periodically emerge from SCP-1437 at great speeds, including:\n\n\n\n\nOne small pyramid composed of concrete. (First known object emergence, believed to be a building material.)\n\n\nLarge quantities of dirt and rocks. (Believed to be an attempt by a parallel safety team to fill in their corresponding SCP-1437.)\n\n\nA landscape painting, believed to be of a location in Scotland. (According to the painting, its originating universe's sun is blue and its sky yellow.)\n\n\nSeveral disks made from solid gold. (Accompanying the disks was a sheet of paper reading 'PLEASE STOP PLAGUE'.)\n\n\nA photograph of several scientists. (All scientists pictured have unusually long fingers, estimated to be nearly twenty-five (25) centimeters long.)\n\n\nA sheet of paper reading \"THANK YOU PLEASE SEND MORE GIFTS.\"\n\n\n\n\nDuring a period lasting from 2009-2012, numerous individuals, most of whom wore bright orange jumpsuits, emerged from SCP-1437, all of whom were dead on arrival. All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes' documentation on SCP-1437. It is currently believed that these individuals and the documentation they carried were sent as a gesture of desired cooperation. On the 15th of August 2012, a volunteer from the Foundation, Marco Perton, entered SCP-1437 wearing safety gear, taking with him a copy of this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerged\u00a0Documentation\u00a01437-2\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\nIndividual carrying documentation was in adequate physical condition.

SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground.\n\n\nSCP-1437 appears to be an access point to an as-of-yet unknown number of parallel universes. Objects have been known to periodically emerge from SCP-1437 at great speeds, including:\n\n\n\n\nA statue of what is believed to be a reptilian entity sporting numerous eyes and tails. (First known object emergence.)\n\n\nLarge quantities of dirt and rocks. (Believed to be an attempt by a parallel containment team to fill in their corresponding SCP-1437.)\n\n\nA glass bottle of water.\n\n\nA human femur.

(Ball only has five sides.)\n\n\n\n\nDuring a period lasting from 200\u2588-20\u2588\u2588, numerous individuals, most of which wore D-class uniforms, emerged from SCP-1437, all of which were dead on arrival. (The fact that it is apparently impossible to travel through SCP-1437 and survive has prevented the Corporation from utilizing SCP-1437 for commercial purposes.) All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes' documentation on SCP-1437. It is currently believed that these D-class personnel and previously mentioned documentation were sent as a gesture of desired cooperation. Several D-class personnel have been sent through SCP-1437 carrying copies of this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerged\u00a0Documentation\u00a01437-3\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\nIndividual carrying documentation was wrapped in bandages and appeared to have been blinded in the recent past.

(Believed to be attempt by demons at mocking us.)\n\n\nA human eye which moved when touched. (Believed to be a lesser demon. Was burnt immediately.)\n\n\n\n\nDuring a period lasting from 200\u2588-20\u2588\u2588, dead demons wearing the skins of men emerged from the pit. They were thrown back in immediately and the site was re-blessed by High Priest \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerged\u00a0Documentation\u00a01437-4\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\nIndividual carrying documentation was a heavily emaciated pre-adolescent, who appeared to have been lobotomized in the recent past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1437\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-1437\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-1437 is to be contained behind a perimeter of two (2) meter tall electrical fencing, which is to be patrolled by groups of three (3) security officers at all times.

Recognizing an assassination attempt upon members of Our Masters Above, the supervising Servant ordered that a \nDon-Burten explosive device\n be delivered down SCP-1437. Its orders were followed and the threat appears to have been resolved.\n\n\nThis is a reminder of why we must be vigilant in our containment procedures.
