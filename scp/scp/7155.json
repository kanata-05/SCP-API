I stole somebody's credentials (forgot who but i dont really care at this point) and I keep adding comments. Someone reverted my edits so there has to be somebody there reading this.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI was just going through the numbers and i eventually found this so somebody must know how to undo this paint, right? This stupid paint just \nsticks\n to me.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI've been scrubbing for hours and my hands hurt and they're bleeding. The paints still there and im still stained.
