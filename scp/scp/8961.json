THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+32\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents of this article may be exaggerated/untrue.\n\n\nIt has been confirmed that most/all of this article was AIC-generated without peer review. Investigation is currently underway as to the described anomaly/events.\n\n\nIt has been confiscated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrections/containment will be made pending O5 review.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8961\n\nObject Class:\n Thaumiel\n1\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n At this time, SCP-8961 does not need to be contained. It is safe as long as it is in the possession of Ullr.aic. Ullr.aic is authorized to make as much of SCP-8961 as is necessary in order to maintain the operating standards of Site-169.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8961 is a black ink nearly identical in function to the magical item \u201cMarvelous Pigments\u201d from the tabletop game \nDungeons and Dragons\n.\n\n\nAn appended description of \u201cMarvelous Pigments\u201d from the 5th Edition of \nDungeons and Dragons\n is included below.\n\n\n\n\nMarvelous Pigments\n\n\n\u2026these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image\u2026 [This process] lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features\u2014such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2026\n\n\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8961 differs from its fictional counterpart in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nObjects created by SCP-8961 will revert to an ink state when significantly damaged. When this happens, the ink loses all anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-8961 does not need a brush to be applied. It is most efficiently applied through the use of machinery, such as a Model X0.0034\u00a03D Printer, which is compatible with most AIC (Artificial Intelligence Construct) models that have a physical terminal.\n\n\nSCP-8961 can be used to create \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. These entities, hereby referred to as SCP-8961-1, appear to possess sentience and are capable of speech. However, they have no life signs (heartbeat, respiration, etc.), and will revert to an ink state when killed. At present, creation of SCP-8961-1 instances has only been tested using a 3D printer.\n2\n\n\n\n\nAs noted above, objects created by SCP-8961 revert to an ink state when destroyed. While this is unavoidable in the course of gameplay (see below), Party members (i.e., site staff and anomalies) are encouraged to avoid destroying their environment where possible. Analysis has found that this will significantly increase the Fun level of Site-169.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8961 was heuristically generated by Ullr.aic as a containment solution for Site-169. According to the mission statement of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division:\n\n\n\n\nWe want to break up the monotony of containment in the simplest way possible: by having fun. \n(Dir. Metanoia, \nGlassford Hill Site Proposal\n, 1985)\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis has determined beyond reasonable probabilistic counter that the most ideal way for a group of sentient individuals to increase the surrounding \"Fun level\" is by playing the tabletop game \nDungeons and Dragons.\n To that end, the grounds of Site-169 have been converted into a thematically appropriate environment for immersive gameplay.\n\n\nSCP-8961 is currently being used to facilitate eight (8) ongoing games of \nDungeons and Dragons\n at Site-169, henceforth labeled Parties 8961-A through 8961-H. The most significant is Party 8961-E, the only group to have advanced past the first dungeon.

The common room has been converted into a hidden elevator through the use of SCP-8961. Once all six Party members have entered the room via the adjacent sitting area, the doors will close and the elevator will ascend.\n\n\n\n\nBrother Instigare, Lady Feathergaol, and The Claw all enter the common room first. The Claw is carrying manila folders containing character sheets. On the table in the center of the room are an assortment of weapons made of SCP-8961.\n\n\nThe Claw goes to the table, puts down the sheets, and picks up a scimitar (1d6 slashing).\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Are these for us?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Must be. I guess this is going to be like a LARP thing?\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n I don't think we've ever played that way before.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n What are you playing as, Deputy Case?\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Dragonborn monk. And you can just call me Kirby, you know.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Actually, right now I should be calling you\u2026 \n(he opens the folder on the table)\n \u201cThe Claw.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Oh, Christ, please don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t think of anything better than that.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Don\u2019t overthink it, dearie. This is a fantasy game, the names are supposed to be fun and silly. I\u2019ve named myself \u201cLady Feathergaol.\u201d\n\n\nThe Claw looks at her sheet.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \u201cLady Feather-jail\u201d? \nLady Feather-jail?\n And you spelled it the Old English way? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me, Polly, that\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n We\u2019ve had a lot of practice. Seriously, Kirby, don\u2019t sweat it. \u201cThe Claw\u201d is cool.\n\n\nAmy enters the common room, Jawshua following behind her.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Oh, were we supposed to name our characters? I just wrote down \u201cAmy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n That\u2019s alright, dearie. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to play as yourself.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n I\u2019d have trouble remembering a new name, on top of all the rules.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n No problem. Polly and I used to play \nDungeons and Dragons\n in college. We can answer any questions you have.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Thank you, Cole.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n What about Jawshua? Where\u2019s its sheet?\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Moreover, how are we going to handle his turns? I have been wondering about that, given his inability to talk. Or\u2026 carry anything.\n\n\nJawshua is a stuffed shark approx. 40 inches in length. It hovers in the air. The other four Party members turn to look at it.\n\n\nULLR.aic\u2019s voice emerges from the overhead intercom.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nJawshua\u2019s sheet will be handled the same as every Party member\u2019s. For the sake of speed and efficiency. And to ensure that the game is fair. I will roll the dice on your behalf.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n So \nyou\n made Jawshua\u2019s sheet?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nThat is correct. Jawshua is a human fighter. Rest assured. The sheet was statistically generated to be balanced. It is neither underpowered or overpowered.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but\u2026 does Jawshua even \nwant\n to play? I didn't know he could\u2026 think.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n It can't, at least not from what research has found. It \nis\n a little odd for a 7538 instance to be here. Ullr, did you instruct it to play?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYes.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Why?\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nThere was a. Cancellation. Within your Party. Analysis determined that an instance of SCP-7538 would be an appropriate last-minute replacement.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Someone at Site-169 cancelled? On \ngame night?\n That\u2019s tantamount to a containment breach.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n What a mystery! Is the game always this involved?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Not always.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Usually.\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n What about Melissa?\n3\n\n\n\"AMY\":\n She's out of town for an appointment with \nDarwish\n. Do you think \nshe\n was our \"cancellation\"?\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n That's where my head was at, but\u2026 \n(pause)\n I dunno, something about this is weird.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nDue to schedule constraints. The game must begin shortly. Are all Party members assembled?\n\n\n\"AMY\":\n We're missing Feghoot.\n\n\nThe Claw walks up to the threshold of the adjacent sitting room.\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n Moses! You done in there? Time's up.\n\n\n\"SIR LEE\":\n \n(shouting)\n That's Director Feghoot, to you.\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n \n(to Amy)\n We're gonna be here for hours.\n\n\nSir Lee enters the common area, standing behind The Claw.\n\n\n\"SIR LEE\":\n Oh, \nrelax.\n I was merely taking some extra time to familiarize myself with the rulebook.\n\n\nThere is a synthetic hum and a slight ground tremor as the elevator begins its ascent. All Party members other than Jawshua react at once, looking around the common area.\n\n\n\"LADY FEATHERGAOL\":\n What was that?\n\n\n\"BROTHER INSTIGARE\":\n It feels like we're moving.\n\n\n\"SIR LEE\":\n \u2026We are. Up.\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n But\u2026 That's not possible\u2014\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nWelcome. To the \"Funhouse Dungeon.\" The first in a theoretically infinite series. Of adventure paths/encounters. Designed by Ullr.aic.\n\n\n\"SIR LEE\":\n Oh no.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAs the elevator reaches the surface. You see before you the world of \"Wyvale.\" Or rather. You see the gatehouse separating you from Wyvale. To enter the realm proper you must first pass through. The \"Funhouse Dungeon.\"\n\n\n\"THE CLAW\":\n \u2026\nWhat did you do to Site-169?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-03\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDungeon Log 8961-E-03:\n Funhouse Mirror Encounter\n\n\nEncounter Description:\n Party 8961-E is in the Funhouse (lower level of the Site-169 parking garage). Before them is a 30-foot-tall mirror with bronze framing. This mirror is actually an enchanted portal. The reflections that face the Party are warped: it is a funhouse mirror. Each Party member must laugh at their reflection to pass through.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to the Party, there is a second mirror hanging from the ceiling. The first Party member to step into its reflection must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the Party member instantly switches places with their doppelganger (L. 6 NPC) in the mirror.\n\n\nThe Party member is trapped within the mirror until their doppelganger dies. Alternatively, breaking the mirror will free them.\n\n\nEncounter Note:\n Events of the previous log have rendered Party members compliant. Log deleted so as not to impact Fun level.\n\n\n\n\nParty-8961-E approaches the funhouse mirror. They are two spaces (10 ft.) away from the mirror on the ceiling.\n\n\nIn the funhouse mirror, their reflections resemble their characters. Amy, a gnome, is smaller than the others, a fact which is comically magnified by the distortion in the mirror.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Hmm\u2026 this is rather cute, actually. Ullr, I think I might like this one.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n I\u2019d really prefer it if you stopped trying to befriend our captor.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n I\u2019m only being honest.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Polly, can I ask a question?\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Yes?\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Is there a particular reason you chose to play an Aarakocra? Because\u2026 you know, you\u2019re literally a duck\u2026 so I\u2019m wondering\u2014\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Don\u2019t read too much into it, dearie.\n\n\nBrother Instigare laughs. His funhouse reflection promptly disappears from the mirror and is replaced with a normally-proportioned reflection of a half-elf in sorcerer robes.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Would you look at that!\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n \n(still laughing)\n Joke so good it solved the puzzle for me.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n I sincerely hope this mirror accepts fake laughter.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Oh, surely you don\u2019t mean that. Amy is right, this one is fun!\n\n\nLady Feathergaol deliberately exaggerates laughing at the mirror. Her funhouse reflection promptly reverts to a normally-proportioned Aarokocra ranger.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n There you are! It \ndoes\n accept fake laughter.\n\n\nAmy and The Claw exchange a glance. Amy laughs genuinely, but The Claw cannot return it. After a moment, they fake their laugh. Both reflections revert to normal proportions.\n\n\nSir Lee does not do anything.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Hey\u2026 what about Jawshua?\n\n\nJawshua is a plush shark. It floats four feet in the air.\n\n\nThere is a moment of silence as the other five Party members look at each other.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \u2026Look, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll go on ahead\u2014\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Wait, I\u2019ve got an idea.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Sure.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Hon, I\u2019m gonna put you down for a sec.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Just as well, I\u2019d like a stretch.\n\n\nBrother Instigare places Lady Feathergaol on the ground in front of him. He crosses behind the other Party members and stands next to Jawshua.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Ullr, can you roll a Performance check for me, please?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nWhat is the nature. Of your performance?\n\n\nBrother Instigare takes Jawshua\u2019s pectoral fins in either hand and mimes that the entity is shaking with laughter. He produces a deep-voiced monster laugh.\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYour check succeeds. The funhouse reflection of Jawshua dissipates. To blessed normalcy.\n\n\n\u201cLADY FEATHERGAOL\u201d:\n Very good thinking, dearie. Let\u2019s get a proper look at this mirror, shall we?\n\n\nLady Feathergaol advances. Behind her, Amy, The Claw, and Brother Instigare all turn to look at Sir Lee.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n We\u2019re waiting.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Then wait.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to any of the Party members, Lady Feathergaol steps into the reflection of the trapped mirror on the ceiling.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nI will now roll a Charisma save.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n What?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Who for?\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n What does that mean?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n It means one of us is being threatened by something, and Ullr is rolling a hidden check to see if they\u2019ll be okay or not.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Remember when I destroyed the door to the Funhouse, and he had us roll Reflex? It\u2019s the same as that, Amy.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Oh! Oh, alright. But why is it Charisma, now?\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n I imagine it\u2019s a \nmagic jar\n, or some other mind-altering effect.\n\n\nThe others look at him.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n What? It stands to reason, doesn\u2019t it? When we used the Reflex skill, it was because the threat was physical. Charisma is the skill representing personality and identity. Ergo, that must be the nature of the threat.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Wow, I\u2019m learning \nso\n much.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Don\u2019t be glib, Kirby. If we want to contain the anomaly, we have to understand how it's being used. \n(to the others)\n From this point forward, we should assume one of us is compromised in some way. If you feel that anyone\u2019s behavior is odd or out-of-character, don\u2019t hesitate to point it out.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n You know, sir, you\u2019re actually pretty good at this game.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \n(grimly)\n You\u2019d be surprised how similar this is to my real job.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Why limit ourselves to magic spells? It could be a cognitohazard. An ontokinetic. \n(pause)\n I don\u2019t like this.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Will you at least tell us if the player passed the check?\n\n\nLady Feathergaol did not pass the check. She has been transported to an extradimensional space within the mirror on the ceiling. This action was not detected by the Party members' passive Perceptions.\n\n\nAt the same time, a Level 6 Doppelganger NPC appeared in her place. This doppelganger resembles the Party member (i.e., a Mallard duck) in every respect. From hereon, Lady Feathergaol's doppelganger will be referred to as SCP-8961-GAOL.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNo.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n Well, I don\u2019t feel any different.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Me neither.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n I would hope not. This is \nsupposed\n to be a game, after all.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Ullr, the person who\u2019s been affected \u2014 would they know?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAssuming that the target did not pass the check. They would be aware of the effect by now.\n\n\nOn the ceiling, Lady Feathergaol is honking and flapping her wings. The Party cannot hear her through the glass.\n\n\nThe Party, including SCP-8961-GAOL, exchange a series of glances.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Well\u2026 It seems we\u2019re all alright, then.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Seems so.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n Shall we continue?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-06\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDungeon Log 8961-E-06:\n Haunted Tomb Encounter\n\n\nEncounter Description:\n Party 8961-E has completed \"THE FUNHOUSE DUNGEON.\" They are now playing \u201cTHE RUINED KING OF WYVALE\u201d scenario. Their objective is to find the Ruined King at the top of the Blasted Tower (the highest point of the AEED Headquarters).\n\n\nThey are presently navigating the Haunted Hedge Maze (the Playground, Site-169\u2019s outdoor recreation area). Beneath the maze is an ancient tomb housing hundreds of restless spirits. A single Ghost (CR 4)\n4\n lingers near the entrance, picking weeds off the tombstones.\n\n\nThe ghost is a lure. When the party approaches it, three Wraiths (CR 5) come out of the ground behind them, blocking their retreat. The Wraiths attack immediately for a surprise round. The ghost disappears when the fighting starts.\n\n\n\n\nParty-8961-E completes the Maze Puzzle Encounter and proceeds through the opening that appeared in the hedge. They find themselves in a new portion of the maze. It is more open, but also more dilapidated. The ground is dirty with twigs and leaves, and the hedges are browning.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYou step through the hedge. A moment later. The opening seals shut behind you. The air is pervasive. A dark chill\u2014\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Excuse me, but can we take a little break first? My feet are tired.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAnalysis shows that now is an inopportune time for a short rest. This section of the dungeon is unfamiliar. And likely dangerous.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n No, my character doesn\u2019t want a break. I do.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nOk. If you want to speak out of character. You have to say \u201cout of character\u201d first.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \nChrist.\n Amy, we don\u2019t want a break, we want to \nleave.\n Ullr, is 8961 flammable?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nOk. That information. Is not part of the game.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n It\u2019s alright, Amy. How about you sit over there on the stump? The rest of us will have a look around and see whatever we\u2019re supposed to do in this room.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n This is probably going to be a combat encounter. We\u2019ve suddenly been given a lot more space to work with.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n A fight isn\u2019t guaranteed just because the space is convenient.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Not in real life, maybe.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \u2026Is the game \nsupposed\n to be that obvious? I thought millions of people played it. It can\u2019t be \nthat\n predictable.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n I don\u2019t think it was designed with former super-para-military field operatives in mind, Kirby.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \u2026Out of character\u2026\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYes?\n\n\nSir Lee steps away from the other Party members, looking into the nearest security camera.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \u2026Speaking \nsolely\n as Moses, I think my fellow party members and I would prefer to rest our feet. Just for a little while. Do you think that could be arranged, Ullr?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNo. Party 8961-B will soon be arriving for an encounter which is unrelated to yours. It would not make sense. If both were going on at the same time. Therefore. A break is not feasible.\n\n\nSir Lee turns away from the camera, scowling.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Just forget about the AIC. Amy and I will wait here. The rest of you can solve the puzzle.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE:\u201d\n Jawshua, do you think you could scout ahead? I\u2019m squishier than you in a fight.\n\n\nJawshua is a plush shark and floats four feet in the air. It does not respond, but it begins to glide slowly forward.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nI will roll an Investigation check for Jawshua.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n You also wanna roll for me to cut through the hedge, or should I just do it?\n\n\nThe Claw does not wait for an answer. They begin hacking at the nearest hedge with a scimitar (1d6 slashing). The branches that break off explode into ink.\n\n\n\"AMY\":\n Kirby!\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYou are a monk. It is not logical for you to attack with a scimitar (1d6 slashing). Moreover. Your actions are pointless. For there is only more of the maze beyond.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Yeah, cause you randomly generated the whole fucking thing.\n\n\nThe Claw succeeds in breaking through the hedge. On the other side, approximately five feet away, is another hedge. The Claw goes through and looks around the corner to see a new section of the maze.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Jesus, I don\u2019t remember the Playground being this big. I can\u2019t see how Ullr set all this up within the perimeter.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Then he didn't.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n You don\u2019t mean\u2026?\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n He made the Site bigger. Isn't that \nlogical?\n\n\nThe Claw returns to the destroyed section of hedge.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Why bring logic into this? He could have used 8961. It\u2019s an anomaly, after all.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nSCP-8961 is designed to increase the overall Fun level of Site-169. Through the implementation of fantasy objects and scenery. Which simulate the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. It is not capable of compressing space.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n So you admit to having extended the perimeter of the Site?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nOk it is correct that I have extended the perimeter but it was only for the sake of making additions to the property which are statistically likely to increase the Fun level.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n What sort of additions, Ullr?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \n80.2% of the new space is occupied by a moat.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Oh, Christ.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n A \nmoat?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAnalysis indicates that this information is a spoiler. This discussion should not continue. The attention of your characters would logically be occupied by Jawshua\u2019s situation.\n\n\nThe Party members look towards the other side of the room. Jawshua is being hugged by the Ghost (CR 4). It is \nSCP-6245\n.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n Oh! It\u2019s a\u2026 bedsheet with eyeholes.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n Hey! I\u2019m the scariest ghost you\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Uh\u2026 Polly\u2026\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Hello Sammy! Good to see you.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n Hi Amy! I was wondering if you were playing or not.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Yes, we are. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d come over, but my hip is acting up.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Everyone in the site is playing, Sammy.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Most of us, I might add, against our will. Which rather raises the question as to what \nyou\u2019re\n doing here, SCP-6245.\n\n\nEveryone in the Party other than Jawshua glares at Sir Lee. He ignores them.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n I\u2019m working with Ullr as a\u2026 what did you say I was, again?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nRoleplay assistant.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n Roleplay assistant! Yeah! Ullr said that since I\u2019m an actual ghost, I provide\u2026 uh\u2026\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAtmosphere. Verisimilitude. And coolness. In the form of a cameo.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n \n(nodding)\n Those things. Can I go back to hugging the shark now?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNo. This would restrict Jawshua. Which would be unfair to the Party. Because they are being attacked.\n\n\nSCP-6245:\n Aw.\n\n\nThe three Wraiths (CR 5) manifest through the floor behind the Party.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nLady Feathergaol. The first wraith will\u2014\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Hang on, why do they get a surprise round? I can see the whole room from my position in the hedge. The others were facing away, but I would be able to warn them.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNo.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n No?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYou are only able to see because you damaged the environment. Which is not part of the encounter. The wraiths get a surprise round.\n\n\nThe Claw ignores Ullr.aic and approaches one of the wraiths, swinging their scimitar (1d6 slashing).\n\n\n\"AMY\":\n Kirby\u2014\n\n\nThe wraith lifts a talon in defense. The apparition is only half-solid, and the blade goes partway through its spectral flesh. Ink sprays the ground.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nOk all three of the wraiths attack The Claw.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n \nHey!\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Bring it on, asshole. I\u2019m using \nshield.\n\n\nThe defensive bonus provided by the Shield spell causes the first two wraiths to miss. The third wraith has The Claw's scimitar (1d6 slashing) stuck in its hand. It succeeds in pulling the weapon out of The Claw\u2019s grip.\n\n\nThe wraith takes the scimitar (1d6 slashing) in both hands and twists it. Ink spills out of it like water wrung from a towel. With a screeching crack, the blade breaks into liquid.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n You fucker. You made it do that on purpose.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nI gave no command.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Kirby\u2026\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n Don\u2019t \u201cKirby\u201d me. This AIC needs to be decommissioned.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n \u2026Even if that \nwere\n the case\u2014\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \nEven if\u2014\n Amy, I can\u2019t believe you. Site-169 is a \nparadise\n compared to the rest of the Foundation. 8961 and its creator are an \ninfestation.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n That\u2026 is a practical way of thinking, but\u2014\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n But \nwhat?\n There\u2019s a limit to what we\u2019re capable of. I\u2019m sorry, but there is.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Kirby, you\u2019re being reactionary. AICs are a product of the Foundation. There must be a rational explanation for Ullr\u2019s behavior, and I\u2019m confident that if we continue to play along with his adventure, we\u2019re inevitably going to\u2014\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n \u2014Inevitably going to kiss it on its little robot feet? You\u2019re out of your mind, Metanoia. This thing is threatening to undo everything you\u2019ve made. Don\u2019t you have any respect at all for your own hard work?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n You\u2019re upset. I understand.\n\n\n\u201cTHE CLAW\u201d:\n No. I\u2019m going to go do my \njob.\n\n\nThe Claw exits through the damaged hedge. As they turn the corner, their footsteps pick up speed.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Kirby, wait!\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Kirby! You\u2019re being an idiot. I would think a \nformer field agent\n would know better than to\u2014 Ugh, forget it, they\u2019re not listening.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nOk. So. The wraith with the damaged hand pursues The Claw.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Oh, no, Ullr, please. They\u2019re just upset. They\u2019ll come back later. This isn\u2019t part of the game.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nThey did not say \u201cout of character\u201d first.\n\n\nThe wraith goes through the hedge in pursuit of The Claw.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNow. I have generated the initiative order for this combat. Brother Instigare. You are first\u2014\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Look, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m stepping on any toes, but\u2026 maybe we \nshould\n split up.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n No.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nNo.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n A Level 6 monk soloing a Wraith is gonna be\u2026 oh, who am I kidding, they'll be fine, they can make like six attacks per round. But\u2026 y\u2019know, that isn't my point. This isn\u2019t \njust\n a game, so\u2026 What, what I feel is, either we split up, or we\u2019re \nall\n going after Deputy Case.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n That\u2019s well-put, dearie.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nYou are in the middle of combat. It is not logical for you to be discussing\u2014\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Out-of-character! Out-of-character, I think we should split up.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n So we\u2019ll just turn our backs on these enemies, then?\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Ullr isn\u2019t going to \nactually\n hurt us. Are you, Ullr?\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nThe purpose of \u201cThe Ruined King of Wyvale\u201d dungeon-slash-adventure-path. Which you are currently playing. Is to increase the Fun level of Site-169. Statistically. Physical harm does not rank highly as a \u201cfun\u201d activity. Therefore the game is not designed to harm any member of Site-169.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n See? So\u2014\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nHowever.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n As I thought.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nMy response time. While exceptional in comparison to yours. Still leaves a margin of error. From a probabilistic standpoint. There is the slim possibility of what is known as an \u201caccident.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n In other words, you can command these 8961 creations as you see fit, but if one of them is acting on pre-established programming to kill us, you might not be able to stop them in time.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nThis is an adequate example of a potential \u201caccident\u201d scenario.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n You guys, all of this is exactly why I\u2019m saying we need to go help Deputy Case.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n I agree with you, Mr. Filverent. But we have to acknowledge the monsters in front of us, too.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Then we have to split up.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \nNo.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nI also said \u201cno\u201d and I am the Game Master.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Director Fegoot, you need to go after Kirby.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \n(scoffing)\n Oh, yes! Let\u2019s take a bad idea and make it worse.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Kirby\u2019s too upset to listen to me. And the Filverents know the game best, so I\u2019ll need their help against the wraiths. That leaves you.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n You think Kirby\u2019s going to listen to \nme?\n You\u2019d be better off sending the shark.\n\n\nSCP-8961-GAOL:\n Actually, I think that\u2019s a lovely idea. You should take Jawshua with you.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n Agreed. The three of us can handle a couple of wraiths, right, Amy?\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n \n(to Sir Lee)\n Can't you see we have no choice?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Of course I can see that. If this were a field mission, Kirby would be signing their death certificate right now. We\u2019re all lucky it\u2019s just a game.\n\n\nULLR.aic:\n \nAnalysis indicates that I was not heard during the part where I said \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Oh, just shut up, Ullr.\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n It isn\u2019t \njust\n a game.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n What?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n It\u2019s \nnever\n \u201cjust a game.\u201d \n(hesitates)\n That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s always been my experience.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \nBrother Instigare,\n do you really think \nnow\n is the time to be imparting \nnuggets of wisdom\n about a \nglorified children\u2019s toy?\n\n\n\u201cBROTHER INSTIGARE\u201d:\n \u2026Sorry, sir.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n \n(sighing)\n SCP-7538.\n\n\nJawshua turns in the air and glides forward until its nose is in front of Sir Lee\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cSIR LEE\u201d:\n Come along. We\u2019re off on a quest to die stupidly.\n\n\n\u201cAMY\u201d:\n Thank you, Moses.\n\n\nSir Lee ignores her and goes through the damaged hedge. Jawshua follows him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Dungeon\u00a0Log\u00a08961-E-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0[RELEASED\u00a0FILE]\u00a0Overseer\u00a0Council\u00a0Emergency\u00a0Meeting\u00a0(Edited)\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0[RELEASED\u00a0FILE]\u00a0Overseer\u00a0Council\u00a0Emergency\u00a0Meeting\u00a0(Edited)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Minutes:\n Emergency Meeting called by Doctor M. Mayfield (Clearance Level 3)\n\n\n\n\nLOG BEGINS\n\n\n\n\n[00:12:07] \nDr. M. Mayfield enters a cavernous room strategically lit with white floor lamps that serve to illuminate the center of the room as much as they obscure any other part of it. There is a large white desk in the shape of a half-circle, just at the edge of what the floor lights can illuminate. The clean white surface is incongruous with the rest of the dark space. At each of the desk\u2019s 13 segments is a tall white board onto which the silhouette of each member of the O5-Council is reflected. Five of the silhouettes are illuminated and moving. Eight are dark and static.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n Thank you for agreeing to meet with me on such short notice. I don\u2019t want to waste your time, so I\u2019ll get right to the point. I believe something is happening at\u2014\n\n\n[00:12:08] \nThe glow around O5-7\u2019s profile brightens with a synthetic hum.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Something is always happening, Mayfield. And our time \nis\n valuable. You\u2019re already wasting it.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n I apologize, sir. Site-169 is inaccessible.\n\n\n[00:12:09] \nAnother hum as O5-9\u2019s portrait brightens.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Define \u201cinaccessible.\u201d\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n The security perimeter outside of the building has been widened, and there\u2019s a new fence. None of these changes were approved by security. If I try to go inside, an armed panel informs me that I must make a character sheet first.\n\n\n[00:12:10] \nSeveral profiles light up at once.\n\n\nO5-3:\n A character sheet?\n\n\nO5-13:\n Like in DnD?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Doctor Mayfield, we don\u2019t take kindly to jokes.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n Respectfully, if I was going to contrive a reason to talk to the O5-Council, don\u2019t you think I would come up with something better than that?\n\n\n[00:12:12] \nThere is a moment of silence.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Oh, relax, everybody. I\u2019m looking at the dossier for Site-169 right now. This is normal for them.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Yeah, look on page five. They have a regularly-scheduled pool party every other weekend.\n\n\nO5-13:\n So you guys do tabletop as well?\n\n\nO5-5:\n This is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about when I said we needed better financial management.\n\n\nO5-1:\n What are the upkeep costs, Five?\n\n\nO5-5:\n Let\u2019s see here. Salaries, security equipment, keeping the lights on. The usual.\n\n\nO5-1:\n What\u2019s their annual budget?\n\n\nO5-5:\n Let me check\u2026 Oh. They don\u2019t have one.\n\n\nO5-3:\n You mean this place doesn\u2019t cost us anything other than upkeep?\n\n\nO5-1:\n I didn\u2019t even know we \nhad\n a Site-169.\n\n\nO5-3:\n Me neither.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Nor me.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Are there any Council members present who \ndid\n know we had a Site-169?\n\n\n[00:12:17] \nSilence.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Lovely.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Mayfield, what is it that you people actually \ndo\n here?\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n We are the Headquarters for the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division. We provide therapy and recreation to low-risk people and objects in containment\u2014\n\n\nO5-1:\n Oh, what, so like, what we do at every site?\n\n\n[00:12:19] \nMayfield pauses.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n \u2026No, Council member. The AEED focuses on providing individualized care, and very few Foundation sites have any consideration of recreational time. What we do is different from the standard therapy policy.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Sounds superfluous.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Is there something wrong with the standard therapy policy?\n\n\nO5-3:\n You mean like R&D? You\u2019re researching better forms of therapy?\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n Not\u2026 not in the way that you\u2019re asking, but\u2014\n\n\n[00:12:20] \nThe silhouette of O5-7 spreads his hands.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Then I have to ask, Doctor Mayfield. What is the point of you?\n\n\n[00:12:21] \nPause.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n Look, Council, the fact of the matter is that there \nis\n something wrong with our standard therapy policy. It\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s wrong with every healthcare program ever made: a lack of time and resources. It is simply impossible, even for the Foundation, to meet the individual needs of every single sentient being under our purview. Even a normal therapist with non-anomalous clients isn\u2019t going to succeed with all of them\u2014and the definition of \u201csuccess\u201d is going to differ for every one of those clients. You know as well as I that we can\u2019t offer that level of care to, say, an ontokinetic that likes to explode people\u2019s brains. For obvious reasons, we must prioritize containment. This is where the Engagement Division comes in. We provide real therapy and real recreation to the anomalies that \ndon\u2019t\n need a high level of containment. It is, I assure you, a unique and necessary function.\n\n\n[00:12:24] \nThe O5-Council is completely silent.\n\n\nO5-7:\n So is that why you called an emergency meeting today, Mayfield? To tell us that the Foundation is incapable of providing \u201creal\u201d therapy?\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n N\u2026. No, sir, I\u2019m talking to you about the unusual incident unfolding at Site-169.\n\n\nO5-1:\n \n(laughing)\n Really? I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\nO5-9:\n I still don\u2019t see what the problem is. If your site is playing \nDungeons and Dragons\n, then make a character sheet and join in.\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n But\u2026 \n(sighs)\n Council, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but surely you can see the significance of what I\u2019m bringing to your attention. I, I can\u2019t get ahold of my superior. Over a game of \nDungeons and Dragons\n! You don\u2019t think that\u2019s odd?\n\n\nO5-3:\n I think everything I\u2019ve heard about your department is odd, Doctor Mayfield.\n\n\nO5-7:\n It \ncould\n be anomalous. If this site is so superfluous, why don\u2019t we send in a Strike Team and put Mayfield here in quarantine?\n\n\nDR. MAYFIELD:\n I\u2014\n\n\nO5-5:\n No need. I\u2019ve figured out what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Oh? Do tell.\n\n\nO5-5:\n While the rest of you were bickering, I did some digging. Looks like Six assigned an AIC to Site-169 a few months back.\n\n\nO5-13:\n O5-6? Hang on, I\u2019ll ask it to join the call.\n\n\n[00:12:28] \nThere is a long pause. O5-13\u2019s microphone picks up the sound of typing.\n\n\n[00:12:30] \nWith a hum, O5-6\u2019s silhouette lights up and animates. The technology projecting its image onto the board struggles to convey its shape.

Navigable by way of difficult Acrobatics check (DC 23).\n\n\nEncounter Notes:\n Damaged sustained to SCP-8961 structures due to unknown weaponry.

Can an old man like me manage it?\n\n\nHe starts up the lower part of the rubble, moving slowly. Jawshua remains stationary.\n\n\nApprox. 3 minutes of silence as Sir Lee scales the rubble. Progress delayed due to overexertion. At the top, he pauses. The stonework\n6\n pushed out of the turret has created an uneven ledge leading into the structure.\n\n\nSir Lee looks down at Jawshua. In the distance, there is the sound of an explosion (see Dungeon Log 8961-E-06.2). Alerted by the flash of light, Sir Lee turns his head towards the perimeter. A thick line of gray smoke is rising from the direction of the Playground.\n\n\nSir Lee appears to look past it, in the direction of the perimeter.\n\n\n\u201dSIR LEE\u201d:\n He\u2019s right, you know. It\u2019s never just a game.\n\n\nJawshua is a plush shark, and does not respond.\n\n\n\u201dSIR LEE\u201d:\n None of them are. An AIC shouldn\u2019t be behaving in this way. Amelie said as much herself. Whatever SCP-8961 really is, it has impacted Ullr\u2019s programming as much as it has impacted our environment.\n\n\n\u201dSIR LEE\u201d:\n A machine can dictate, but it cannot \ndirect.\n It can record, but it cannot \nplay.\n Based on my examination of the rulebook, I suspect that Ullr does not fully understand how to play \nDungeons and Dragons.\n The Game Master is the arbiter of the rules, yes, but they are also a \nparticipant.\n Did you notice, Ullr never calls us \"players\"? That's what it's missing. It doesn't know how to play.\n\n\nLong pause.\n\n\n\u201dSIR LEE\u201d:\n Let\u2019s have you stay here, SCP-7538.

Due to spatial limitations, the command terminal for Ullr.aic is in the same room. A false wall of SCP-8961 has been constructed to separate the intended arena from Ullr.aic\u2019s workspace.

The weapon they are wielding is now identified as a high-density displacement cannon\n7\n. They see the Ruined King and immediately fire the cannon.\n\n\nThere is a loud burst of displaced air.
