We really have to talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA002\n\n\n\n\nI forwarded them to the Southwest-US breach desk. Site-01's secure communication system is not the reporting line of first resort. You know that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA003\n\n\n\n\nRight. But this isn\u2019t a breach. I guess it\u2019s arguably an invasion from a single alien organism, but either way, it\u2019s from something we never \nhad contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA004\n\n\n\n\nI know that the distinction is immaterial in practice. But I know the breach desk. Their first, second, and third questions are about what destructive or disruptive actions, if any, are being undertaken by the breaching anomaly. That\u2019s not a methodology that would work in this instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA005\n\n\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA006\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an airship, and it\u2019s just sitting there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA007\n\n\n\n\nI know I sound crazy. I\u2019m sending over the 8217 file. That should shed a bit more light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA008\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019re finished, or as soon as you\u2019re convinced of need, I\u2019m going to request substantial external assistance, ideally an MTF. Do not scramble \nanyone\n without some form of filtering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA009\n\n\n\n\nUnderstood. I know 8217. We've never encountered an airship before, but the arrival of one is certainly a tail risk we've planned for. You'll get the support you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA010\n\n\n\n\nDeeply appreciated. We have three hundred employees at Site-592. At least eighty are infected already. We may need to amnesticize everyone here several times before this is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n8217\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nvlam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nwarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-8217-1 instances are to be frozen, with the freezer placed in a Safe-class containment locker at Site-48. Experimentation requests for non-infectious fingers require project team approval. Experimentation requests for infectious fingers require Site Director sign-off and are solely to be conducted upon D-Class subjects; following these experiments, infected personnel will be amnesticized and returned to service.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8217-1 is a set of 22 fingers that appeared on the desk of Site-48 Researcher Masha Straschnov on June 8, 2024. Genetic testing has confirmed that all fingers come from a single humanoid being of an as-yet-unidentified species. Each measure between 5 and 8 centimeters and appear to have been violently severed.\n\n\nWhen touched, each SCP-8217-1 instance induces a distinct vision of life upon an alien planet. Within the vision, all intelligent lifeforms are perceived as human; the actual appearance of these lifeforms, if extant, is unknown. A minority of SCP-8217-1 visions cause exposed individuals to develop an as-yet poorly-understood disorder characterized by heightened aggression and increased comfort with the concept of human extinction. To avoid this, \u2018infectious\u2019 visions are auto-censored by AIC.\n\n\nUsing the relative size of astronomical phenomena perceivable in the background of SCP-8217-1 visions, Foundation astronomers successfully triangulated the depicted planet (designated SCP-8217-2) and obtained an image of it through the Extrasolar Observational Array.\n\n\nFrom orbit, the surface of SCP-8217-2 appears of uniform color and without geographic variation, bearing little resemblance to the lush planet observed in SCP-8217-1 visions. Ongoing explosions are visible at several points across its surface. SCP-8217-2 is orbited by two moons; their orbital speeds imply that the density of SCP-8217-2 is comparable to that of animal biomass.\n\n\nA partial record of SCP-8217-1 visions is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8217-4-1 | \nInfectiousness:\n Negative\n\n\n\n\nLog of Associated Vision:\n\n\n\n\nYou are Hanu Cealal, scarcely king.\n\n\nYou are tired, bone-tired. You see yourself in the gilded pane that surrounds the hemicycle. Your green robes have been scuffed by hard riding. No crown covers your pate. Against the advice of your aide, you let your eyes drift upward: dozens of kings are gathered, and none of their faces are kind. A few second-sons sit in the crowd, gold-threaded cloth tied over their vacant sockets. You wonder which ones slew their kin. You wonder how they did it.\n\n\nThe steward turns to you. He is a slight man, trusted by all. Above reproach, beneath contempt. You nod at him. He nods back, and turns his face to the crowd. \u201cBegging your patience. Begging your patience. The steward yields ground to the dispossessed.\u201d\n\n\nYou take the podium. \u201cGratitude. Gratitude to this assembly of kings. Gratitude to the Royal Federation. Gratitude to the Font-of-Song. Long I have ridden. Long have I feared this day. My hold on Cealalia was broken by my child, and I was banished from my land, from my own rightful domain. He took my diadem from my head; he set me on this cruel journey; he has shown none of the filial respect to which I am entitled\u2014\u201d\n\n\nA voice rings out from above. \u201cKing,\u201d it says, \u201cyour hardship is yours to bear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBegging your patience,\u201d you say, and sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve come to sing my lands away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTwenty percent of its loot,\u201d says a voice from the uppermost level. It is King Carrigan, and upon his pronouncement, King Cirhin erupts into laughter.\n\n\n\u201cWhy such a beggar\u2019s offer?\u201d Cirhin asks.\n\n\n\u201cCealalia is not a wealthy land,\u201d says Carrigan. \u201cAnd the diadem of its royal family has certain powers that could render it difficult to defeat. I don\u2019t like the idea of fighting ten thousand clones for a molehill of gold.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPermission to elaborate on the diadem?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d says Carrigan.\n\n\n\u201cThe holder of the diadem has a few powers, most of the standard form associated with a low-level magical artifact: teleporting small objects, conveying memory with a touch. Nothing with which your majesties are unfamiliar.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThose are plainly not the powers that I reference.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. Its sole major property, to which King Carrigan refers, is the ability for the holder of the diadem to duplicate himself. But there are numerous limitations to this ability, which impair its usefulness in war. Duplicates cannot maneuver independently. The holder can move all of them at once, or one at a time, but the holder cannot make one shoot and another walk. An army of such duplicates could never ford a river, or take any other action that requires multiple persons to undertake different, though simultaneous, movements. What is more, the holder feels the pain of each duplicate, and must eat copiously, to the point of distending his stomach, to enable the duplication process to occur. Duplicates are typically used solely to impair assassination attempts; there is little chance that your majesties would face an army of them.\u201d\n\n\n\"Why reveal this?\" asks Carrigan.\n\n\n\"To assure you of the soundness of your investment,\" you say. \"I wore the diadem for many years. I know its limits as I know my own heart.\"\n\n\n\u201cI am not convinced.\"\n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d says Cirhin. \u201cSixty percent.\u201d\n\n\nThe chamber is silent. You too are silent. It is the largest loot share ever offered in the chamber; how Cirhin plans to profit off his conquest, none can say.\n\n\n\u201cA generous offer. Gratitude. Gratitude. Are there any beneficial standards of trade that you would request upon my restoration?\u201d\n\n\nKing Cirhin laughs again.\n\n\n\u201cKing, when my armies have passed through your land, there will be nothing to trade, no-one to trade with, and no throne to restore you to. But you will have no need for those persons\u2014your wealth will be vast as the sun.\u201d\n\n\nYou see your grin in the gilded pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8217-4-3 | \nInfectiousness:\n Negative\n\n\n\n\nLog of Associated Vision:\n\n\n\n\nYou are King Carrigan, wealthy, cautious. Your retainers sit eighty feet away, on the far side of the hemicycle. When the meeting ends, not more than an hour hence, you will be reunited with them. They are collating bon mots. They know your mood is foul. You are with them so often that you think of them, at points, as part of yourself. They are the part of your brain that soothes anger, that does those things that you did when you were still an heir. Royalty is a second childhood. You know that Cirhin is also a child.\n\n\n\u201cSixty percent?\u201d you whisper. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no chance of making a sesterce.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not after profit,\u201d says Cirhin.\n\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re after the diadem?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, that I\u2019ll give back to Hanu, once I\u2019ve slain all his kin. If he wants a new family, he can make one as large as he wants, out of the only member of it he\u2019s ever cared for.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAmusement, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn part. But largely because my advisor has developed a weapon of unparalleled force. It strikes like a dream, he tells me. Explosions so vast that they make new threnodies in the Song. It floats far above the earth, where none can touch it. And the simple act of seeing it drives men to frantic, animal courage. We have built a hundred, at my direction. I myself have not yet seen it in person, but the testing shows that we stand on the brink of a new world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis strikes me as a state secret.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was. I tell you now because it\u2019s too late to avert it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSurely such force is not necessary to defeat the Cealals?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just want to make everyone witness our might. It\u2019ll make looting easier, it\u2019ll accelerate future surrenders, and, should the time come to fix certain discrepancies between our historic borders and\u2026 well, Carrigan, never mind about that. I want to shock the world. To unnerve it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly unnerved me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA promising start,\u201d says Cirhin. \u201cBut no, I don\u2019t care about Cealalia. That\u2019s why all of it will burn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8217-4-4 | \nInfectiousness:\n Negative\n\n\n\n\nLog of Associated Vision:\n\n\n\n\nYou are Rosu Cealal, lately king, helmsman of sixteen eyes in eight heads. One of them is immured, a spare, in the case of disaster. Your designated survivor, it sees only the clean and cushioned walls of the room of its imprisonment. The other seven are in the throne room; six recline in the shadows of the hall, unmoving, and the seventh, recipient of your current attentions, sits the throne. When you claimed it, the weight of the diadem sat easy on your head. You wondered: why not sooner?\n\n\nNow you only wonder why you let your father live.\n\n\nAt your left hand sits your dour general; at your right hand sits your younger brother, eyeless Seh, bandage about his face, his aide cradled behind him. Your ministers have left the room, frightened in ways that frightened you. Ansem, the Lord of Fisheries, wouldn\u2019t meet your gaze. He left in a hurry, not more than twenty minutes before. You\u2019re sure he\u2019s on a fast horse to the hinterlands. You think of replacing him. You wonder why you\u2019d bother; he\u2019d be back soon enough, with Hanu. You know these Royal Federation deals: a targeted invasion, a rapid surrender, punishing taxes to pay off the conqueror, and then a gradual return to normalcy. Your father backed an invasion once, and it paid off for him handsomely.\n\n\nYou wonder if you yourself should take flight.\n\n\n\u201cAny word from the spies within Cirhinia?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, yes,\u201d says the general. \u201cOne says that the damage Cirhin intends to exact is going to be\u2026 unusually severe, for a Royal Federation intervention.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo we know what he means by that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think it might be wise to take Cirhin seriously, but not always literally,\u201d says the general. \u201cBut it seems that he\u2019s been tromping around his palace, declaring that he wants to see our whole land burned.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan we negotiate with him? I'm not too proud to teleport a missive into his court.\"\n\n\n\u201cI took the liberty of reaching out already.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWithout my consent?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMerely an overture. The situation has been developing quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hope, is there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs he open to negotiation?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. He seems eager to exhibit his new weapon. His airship.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps we\u2026 we cede a town or two, for his exhibition.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I will reach out. But I am not optimistic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do we know about this airship?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is rigid, floating cartilage, like a whale in the sky, and it drops explosive material.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo they load it up with that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. No, it births it. Like an egg. It is assuredly magical. We successfully placed a spy on the assembly line, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave we heard anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing useful. We\u2019ve received\u2026 ah, seventy messages. But all are gibberish. Not encrypted, just raving. \u2018Our world has built its own child\u2019 was one. \u2018What is your blood fated for?\u2019 \u2018Song\u2019s end.\u2019 \u2018The new man flies.\u2019 And, over and over, \u2018Better them than us.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs someone playing a joke on us?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. No. To our body of knowledge about the airship, we must add that those who see it become sick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA011\n\n\n\n\nSituation has evolved.

Some were amnesticizable; others weren\u2019t. We lost twelve people outright, maybe more. There\u2019s another sixty infected we\u2019ve got barricaded away in the southeast corner of the main building. Some of them escaped into the cells; if we\u2019re lucky, they\u2019re dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA014\n\n\n\n\nHow long ago was that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA015\n\n\n\n\nNot sure.

Most likely by my hand. I woke up covered in blood.\n\n\nAlso, all of this is permanent, and I know it. I\u2019m still getting used to that. It\u2019s like the noise in my head started screaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA020\n\n\n\n\nIs there anyone I can speak to who wasn\u2019t infected / amnesticized?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA021\n\n\n\n\nYou won\u2019t be getting rid of me so easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA022\n\n\n\n\nRuss, we\u2019ve worked together for years. You\u2019re paranoid; that\u2019s all it is. I can also assure you that nobody\u2019s going to hold you responsible for actions undertaken while under the influence of a cognitohazard.\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t join up yesterday. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been on the other side of the desk, telling someone else that nobody blames them for whatever they did when something else was riding their mind.\n\n\nI just need access to someone with a memory of the actual breach to get a sense of what you need down at 592.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-592 Director Russ Braithwaite\n 08.22.2024 #8217DA023\n\n\n\n\nNo. I\u2019ll ask around later.

It gave you a thrill to see so many eyes upon you. Such fear, such work to be done. Then, one by one, they looked up at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 mass above you, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u200b\u200b\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. You saw their knees weaken. Grins spread across their faces. An understanding of their fate. An eagerness for it. When they fought, it was not out of hope but for love of it. Rabid, but vastly outmatched. A pleasure to slay. You look forward to your own end, but there are so many joys that lurk before it. You and your brethren took their corpses out to the front gate and set them aflame. Then, from a far distance, the airship laid its egg upon the village\u2019s remains. So disproportionate. A ruin far exceeding the village it replaced. You looked and love bloomed in your heart, the love of a father for a child that has far surpassed him, and then you kept marching.\n\n\nTo clean your weapon seems so shameful. You wish all the blood stayed upon it. You wish that you could look at it and see all at once the fruit of your efforts.\n\n\nYou wear the robes of Cirhinia, purple and red, but Cirhin\u2019s not who you march for. You march for your boy.

He stares at the fire with holy intensity.\n\n\n\u201cWe thought we were people. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re the chaff. And soon our child won\u2019t need us.\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know why he says all this. You know all this.

He grabs his weapon. The others around the fire cheer. They\u2019re jealous of you. They wish they had thought to get up first, to steal the moment, to have the chance to fight. But you\u2019re of two minds about it. You have no desire to give him what he wants.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t.\n\n\nThe next day, the camp departs. He is left on the empty plain, crying out for water.

What \nwould\n be the point?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was wondering if there were any\u2026 earlier prototypes of the airship. Before you settled on the current design.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere were never prototypes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou mean the initial design of the airship was its current form?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I never designed it. I found the first one in the desert two years ago. The pilot seat had the bones of an animal I\u2019d never seen. They were petrified, many millennia dead. It came from a different world, I think.

None of our airships have decamped for the stars.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, not yet. They will. This, too, is part of it: vestigial organs decay, the caterpillar is swallowed in the metamorphosis, it is the fate of children to bury their parents.

You say\n\n\nthey float above the surface 600 meters and to build to that peak, given a surface area of 464 trillion square meters, needs 280.2 quadrillion cubic meters\n\n\nExplosions come frequent as heartbeats, and bring with them white-hot, seizing pain, doubled and redoubled, nothing you could dream of, nothing you could know.\n\n\n3,000 airships each 30 minutes each drops a bomb of 42 cubic meters meaning each year that is 2.25 trillion cubic meters\n\n\nYou pause to bite your fingers off. They might not be yours. You feel it all the same.\n\n\n123,750 years then I can eat the airships then I can die\n\n\nYou hope life blooms fast on your great corpse.\n\n\nWith your mouth, and some shoving, you deposit your fingers in your deplumed palms.\n\n\nunsure where life is or if there is life, send to each planet in case there is life, they came from somewhere they\u2019re going elsewhere\n\n\nSomewhere, upon one of your heads, the diadem awakens. The fingers, full of the memories of the world you ate, are fluttered away to their destination.\n\n\nScent is fetid. Acrid. Rotting self and human shit. You feel yourself trillionfold, being devoured, swallowing excrement. Even the screams are pain. No pause to your agony. You cannot take it. But it bites and tears and goes and goes and goes.\n\n\nUnconsciousness comes, a blessed instant, then you wake up screaming elsewhere.\n\n\nYou are the Song and the pain of the Song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n 08.22.2024 #8217DB001\n\n\n\n\nSent over all documentation for the -592 detonation in line with internal reporting requirements.

Genetic testing has confirmed that all fingers come from a single humanoid being of an as-yet-unidentified species. Each measure between 5 and 8 centimeters and appear to have been violently severed.",
