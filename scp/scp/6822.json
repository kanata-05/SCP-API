These properties affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, inducing a calmed state of mind within individuals. This will be followed by the subject developing partial omniscience for a short period of time, allowing them to comprehend the state of the world as a whole and the implications behind them.\n\n\nSCP-6822's effects can also be reproduced through photographs and will persist for up to 24 hours.\n\n\nAddendum 6822-1:\n Discovery\n\n\n\n\nOn Christmas Day, 1914, during the first year of the First World War a single soldier climbed out of the trenches holding a white flag. They walked deeper into No Man's Land as the shelling subsided, and planted the flag at the top of a hill.\n\n\nLater, soldiers from both sides crossed their trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and conversations. Here, all men were comrades and they mingled and exchanged foods and souvenirs. They hugged one another, they mourned lost brothers and fathers, and they sang Christmas carols while others drank or played games of football. The truce was observed along a large part of the trenches on the Western Front despite not being authorised by either of the opposing sides, even after Pope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n \n\n\nSo that's how it is.\n\n\nYou think aloud to yourself as you finish reading.\n\n\n \n\n\nVisions of the Earth had already flashed by you.\n\n\nThe streaks of destruction left behind and the corpses of ruins left rotting.\n\n\nYou had felt everything everyone else did. Their feelings, their thoughts, and their hopes.\n\n\nYou had felt the textures of the ground and the ridges of the mountains that now ceased to exist.\n\n\nYou had felt a dying Earth, scarred beyond all hope.\n\n\nAnd there, in the middle, was the clock.\n\n\nTicking down, a second at a time.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou get up and close the computer.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou know where to go.\n\n\nYou always knew.\n\n\nAnd now you understand.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEach one of your steps echoes throughout the facility, slipping into corners and doors ajar.\n\n\nYou walk past the offices, coloured a blank beige with papers scattered about.\n\n\nThe security room, with weapons untouched and lockers unopened.\n\n\nAnd the dozens of containment chambers, all silent, all open.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou are in front of the site's main entrance. You can see the light spilling in through the door, all of it, vibrant colours.\n\n\nYou wonder how long it's been since you got out of the site. How long it has been since you've seen the faces of your family, your friends.\n\n\nJust how long has it been?\n\n\nYou take some slow steps.\n\n\nAnd you walk outside.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou are greeted by the sunlight, warm and comforting.\n\n\nThere are flowers everywhere.\n\n\nRed, white, yellow, pink, of every colour you could imagine.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe sirens weren't wailing.\n\n\nInstead, they played music.
