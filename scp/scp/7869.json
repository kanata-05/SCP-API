I don't mind the shift at all, but\u2026 My new quarters are situated near the goddamned Site junkyard! Said junkyard smells of rusted metal and horse shit, how did the building contractor even get permission to put research offices so close to it!? I tried to complain to my superior to get me a better office, but he didn't even pick up his phone. Bastard.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 6\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nGave up attempting to change quarters and just tried to get used to the smell. But something else\u2019s come up- every night, some kind of bright light shines from the 'yard. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I don\u2019t like it at all, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep well because of it\u2026 Fuckin' thin curtains, they don\u2019t keep the glare out at all. I\u2019ll try to find out what it is tomorrow, I can\u2019t take this anymore.\n\nAll the bad stuff happens to me, huh? I haven\u2019t been able to catch a break since I came here. I miss Site-42.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nDown with work yesterday, so I wasn\u2019t able to make a log. Well\u2026 Today, I called on the junkyard\u2019s foreman. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with the light in the junkyard- he wasn\u2019t even aware that such a thing was happening in the junkyard in the first place. He had the nerve to tell me to go to the Site Therapist, because I was \u2018seeing things\u2019. No I wasn\u2019t! I know I wasn\u2019t! I\u2019ll have to visit the junkyard myself and put down a video camera\u2026 I need to know what's going on right now before I \ndo\n go crazy.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 9\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nThe guards were confused by my visit today, because no researcher\u2019s ever cared to look at the junkyard even once before now. After all, it\u2019s just junk, right? No personal stakes in it or anything. I myself, I wish I hadn\u2019t. The smell\u2019s even worse when you\u2019re near it. Some of the Ds\u2019 weren\u2019t very happy to see me again either. I just ignored them. The video camera\u2019s in place, I\u2019ll see what it has to show me tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 10\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nOk, so I looked at the camera footage in detail, and I think\u2026 I think I\u2019ve found something big. Five minutes into the recording, the footage just blanked out. Right after that, I noticed that about half of the piled junk surrounding the camera was\u2026 gone. I think I can report this as a suspected skip, but I\u2019ll have to go down again and get more evidence.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 11\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nI walked around the junkyard again today, and found shards of silicon shards scattered all around the soil. If I remember correctly, isn\u2019t our silicon waste repurposed into circuitry or whatever? It isn\u2019t just dumped here, and certainly not in pieces like this. Akiva detector was acting up too. Pinging loudly, showing high readings\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a malfunction, I checked the internal systems and they were all fine. Why should there be a high Akiva reading in a junkyard, of all places? It isn\u2019t a religious area at all, and even this is way too high to be considered normal. I think I really am onto something big, but I need to corroborate my findings elsewhere first. Maybe I can see if this also happens elsewhere. If it does, I'll be able to confirm it as a skip.\n\nCarl out.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nJust arrived in Berlin. I\u2019m exhausted as hell. I\u2019m going to check the Berlin junkyards tomorrow and just stay around in there for a few days, constant travel isn\u2019t doing me any good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrote this last night drowsy and drunk on the cheap booze the plane gave me. I don\u2019t know whether to shred it or keep it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll also go around and see the surrounding towns, but that'll be it. France is next on my bucket list- only a few more countries to go.\n\n\nJanuary 29\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nI'm finally back at Site-81. The past few weeks have been a whirl. I travelled to different sites, different states, different countries\u2026 All only to take a look at their junkyards. I must sound crazy, but it\u2019s worth it. If what I\u2019ve found out is correct, this to-be skip I\u2019ve found is active in pretty much every junkyard in the world- And what I\u2019ve gathered from each visit, the data\u2026 It\u2019s more or less all the same. A bit of junk gets shaved off every night, and nobody cares, because junk\u2019s junk. Traces of silicon were also present on every scrapyard I visited- and so was the Akiva radiation. I\u2019m beginning to see a pattern here. Every junkyard in the world is staffed with people who, if they do notice what\u2019s going on, are too dumb or too busy to care, because handling junk is only for lowlifes. Whatever\u2019s doing this, it\u2019s taken advantage of this pattern to boldly steal from the junkyards\u2026 Assuming that the entity, or entities responsible have grown complacent due to all of their successes so far, I may be able to catch them on camera if I keep watch over the Site-81 Scrapyard tonight. I\u2019ve already acquired SCRAMBLE goggles, SRAs, all the stuff\u2026 Here goes nothing.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\nI just got a picture, but it appears that the anomaly can ruin photos taken of it. Well, even if the photo\u2019s baked, at least I\u2019ve still collected and seen enough evidence to know for sure that the anomaly exists, so there\u2019s that. The SCRAMBLE goggles registered a few memetic hazards originating from the anomaly, but they weren\u2019t lethal. What\u2019s strange, though, is that the memetic hazards in question were able to pierce through the goggles\u2019 security- a problem that I\u2019ll have to flag later. The anomaly manifested at around midnight- I was almost about to give up on observing the scrapyard when it came. I shouldn\u2019t be waiting any longer\u2026 \nI think I\u2019m ready to alert my superiors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP entry has been constructed on this page.
