Currently, members of Mobile Task Force Psi-33 (\"Himmler's Housekeepers\") are leading containment efforts. Before deployment personnel must wear Third Reich military insignias, and be partially fluent in German. Incendiary munitions are to be used against instances to ensure complete neutralization. If personnel do not possess the necessary munitions, inflicting significant cranial trauma will temporarily suffice in neutralizing an instance until proper disposal.\n\n\nCivilians are to be redirected away from areas inhabited by SCP-6839 instances. Any sightings reported outside of their known habitation are to be investigated, and unauthorized witnesses are to be administered amnestics. Any evidence taken by civilians such as photographs or videos are to be confiscated. In the event any evidence of SCP-6839 is leaked to the public it is to be dismissed as a hoax.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6839 refers to a species of hostile hominids. Specimens are covered in white fur, and they stand upright with an average height of around 2\u00a0m. Their bodies primarily consists of bone, and layers of muscle tissue. Instances do not require sustenance to survive, but they have been observed to ingest organisms for the purpose of assimilating their mass. Therefore, they are considered to be biologically immortal.\n\n\nSCP-6839 were developed during the Second World War by the \nAhnenerbe Obskurakorps\n of Nazi Germany. Recovered documents referred to them in German as \nSchneemensch\n, which translates to \"snow men.\" SCP-6839 are designed to be adaptive organisms capable of manipulating their organic mass, especially within combat situations. They possess a limited degree of sapience that allows them to independently strategize, and comprehend language to receive commands in German. In addition, they have been conditioned to superficially identify German soldiers while ensuring their safety over their own. This fact is currently exploited by mobile task forces to confuse instances. Genetic analysis has found instances to possess the DNA of humans (\nHomo sapiens\n), sea stars (\nAsteroidea\n), and \nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n.\n\n\nIn combat scenarios, SCP-6839 instances have demonstrated the ability to utilize firearms. Their muscular physique allows them to rapidly traverse their environment. They have been documented to travel at approximately 50\u00a0km/h on foot. In the absence of firearms, specimens will modify their anatomy to combat enemies. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing their muscle mass.\n\n\nForming additional limbs such as arms, tendrils, or membranous wings.\n\n\nIncreasing bone density.\n\n\nElongate the arms, fingers, and claws.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6839 exhibit regenerative properties that allow instances to survive lethal injuries. However, inflicting cranial trauma can temporarily immobilize an instance as it regenerates lost brain tissue. Decapitation can partially achieve a similar result, but the head will remain an active threat. A new instance can also develop if the body and head are allowed to individually undergo regeneration. The speed of the process greatly varies depending if it can access organic matter to assimilate. Incendiary damage is the most effective method in neutralizing a specimen.\n\n\nIn July 1945, instances of SCP-6839 were encountered by British forces during Operation Tabarin.\n1\n They had discovered one of the entrances into a subterranean complex that housed a facility for Nazi Germany.\n2\n However, the initial survey team were killed in action by instances of SCP-6839 that were guarding the area. The British Special Air Service were then deployed later in November to neutralize the threat. An agent from the British Occult Service\n3\n also accompanied them. The mission concluded in December with only 3 survivors from the SAS unit. In their testimonies they reported encounters with SCP-6839 instances. The Secret Intelligence Service\n4\n then proceeded to inform the Foundation regarding their existence. Further encounters with SCP-6839 instances occurred during Operation Highjump\n5\n, and subsequent deployments.\n\n\nInstances are currently scattered throughout Queen Maude Land, East Antarctica. They were originally confined to \nNew Swabia\n6\n to guard the region, but Foundation efforts successfully repelled them from the area. The facility where instances were being developed was successfully shut down, which contain similar equipment found in \nSCP-2936\n. It is unknown how many specimens remain active, but efforts to neutralize them are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 01:\n The following correspondence was recovered from Germany after the Second World War. They have been translated into English from German. Person of Interest files for the individuals named can be provided upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom\n\n\nKarl Reuter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo\n\n\nHeinrich Himmler\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nBlack Forest Snow Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have investigated the reports regarding the creature, and our men were able to successfully hunt it down. It is indeed a Child of the Night we were told about by the Man with the Green Gloves.\n7\n We were able to confirm it by comparing the scalp he had provided to us. Unfortunately, it had no exotic technology for us to collect. If the story of their demise is true then the ancient Aryans were thorough in reducing them to mere animals. However, even animals can be made useful.\n\n\nI've sent the body to Klossner. Perhaps he may be able to create something of value. If not then an educational display at House Wewelsburg\n8\n will be fitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom\n\n\nDietrich Klossner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo\n\n\nHeinrich Himmler\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nStatus Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe few snow men I was able to make have gone to assist in the Eastern Front. I have also sent the instructions for their development to New Swabia. The glass wombs we had shipped there will be able to manufacture an army capable of withstanding the Antartic cold. It is a shame we are low on equipment here in Germany, but I understand that we had to prepare our remote facilities.\n\n\nI will continue work on my other projects, and provide you updates as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, GRU Division \"P\" documents regarding the Second World War were acquired by the Foundation. According to them, Soviet forces had encountered 12 SCP-6839 instances during the Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes offensive in October of 1944, presumably those mentioned in Klossner's memo. Despite experiencing casualties, they were able to successfully neutralize them with heavy artillery fire. The encounter was kept classified from the Allied Occult Initiative\n9\n to research instances for potential militaristic gain. However, in 1945, Klossner was acquired by the United States during Operation Paperclip\n10\n before Soviet forces could secure him and his research in Operation Osoaviakhim\n11\n on October 22, 1946. Attached is a translated copy of the Soviet profile concerning SCP-6839.\n\n\n\n\nOSI \"ALARIC WILD MEN\"\n\n\nDIVISION \"P\" DEPARTMENT III\n\n\nAPPROVED 10.II.1955 PRINTOUT NR: 3\n\n\nD.NR:\n 29-X-1944\n\n\nDETAIL:\n OSI \"ALARIC WILD MEN\" are large primates covered in white fur. They possess high intelligence, and great physical strength. Their injuries are healed by devouring other organisms, which may also increase their mass. Damage to the head combined with flames and explosives are sufficient in exterminating them.\n\n\nThe creatures were fought in the Great Patriotic War\n12\n during Comrade Stalin's Tenth Blow.\n13\n It was the only encounter. ALARIC\n14\n scientist Dietrich Klossner was responsible for their creation. Details of their development remain unknown, but the use of techniques from flesh-crafters\n15\n are a possibility. Klossner's researcher was deemed valuable for enhancing the projects of the late Ilya Ivanov.\n16\n According to informants, the creatures can be found in East Antarctica. SACK\n17\n currently occupy the region, presumably to exterminate them. Soviet operations in Antarctica must remain alert.\n18\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 02:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, an information breach occurred in an article published by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 magazine.\n19\n It contained classified information regarding the British Special Air Service during Operation Tabarin, albeit with embellished details. Notably, it reported on their encounters with SCP-6839. Foundation investigators found that the article was written by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a former employee of the UK Ministry of Defence. During interrogation he claimed to have discovered the personnel files of the 1945 SAS mission. He then tracked down the final survivor named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for an interview. At the time, he suffered from dementia before dying two months later from natural causes. The severity of the breach was evaluated as inconsequential against consensus reality due to the unreliable reputation of the magazine. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 received amnestics after the investigation.\n\n\nAddendum 03:\n The following is a transcript of an SCP-6839 encounter by MTF personnel during neutralization efforts. It has been edited for brevity. Other transcripts are available at request.\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following transcript is mostly recorded from within a Barys 8x8 armored combat vehicle of MTF Delta-14 (\"Winter Wonderland\"). It was accompanied by a modified BvS 10 that pulled an autonomous anti-tank guided missile system.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n I have a visual on the target.\n\n\nThermal cameras detect 5 instances traversing the Antarctic landscape. Telescopes observe that 2 specimens are moving a 3.7\u00a0cm Flak 43 turret.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n There are five polar men\n20\n on the move. They're hauling a flak turret.\n\n\nAn instance can be seen leading at the front while wearing a German steel helmet, and wielding an MG 81 machine gun. It appears to be instructing other instances.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n It looks like that big guy with the helmet is the leader. I think we're going to need a missile strike for this one. That turret might give us trouble if it still works. It could even be anomalous.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n You got it, MaCready.\n\n\nHofmann communicates with the operators of the BvS 10 to activate their missile launch system. They begin targeting the group of SCP-6839 instances.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n We're set.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Good.\n\n\nA missile is launched at the targets. Exterior camera observes the explosion in the distance. The surrounding area is engulfed in flames.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n Did we get them all?\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Wait.\n\n\nThe instance wearing the steel helmet can be seen rising out of the snow after the explosion begins dissipating. The left side of its body is charred with the arm missing. In the other arm it is still holding on to the MG 81.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n The big one barely survived, and it looks pissed off.\n\n\nThe instance appears to notice the MTF, and begins to move towards their position. Additional limbs can be seen forming from its back.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n It's coming towards us. Send another rocket at it with a lower blast yield. I'm going to slow it down with the turret.\n\n\nThe Sarbaz turret\n21\n locks on to the instance, which begins firing its weapon at the direction of the vehicle. Agent MaCready begins to open fire upon it. The specimen begins performing evasive maneuvers, and throwing snow up in the air. Additionally, it begins to move on all limbs closer to the ground.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Slippery bastard.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n What's it doing?\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Trying not to get hit but-\n\n\nThe right shoulder of the instance is struck by a round from the turret, losing its arm in the process. A second round is then fired that hit the left side of the torso.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Got you.\n\n\nAppendages appear to be growing from behind the head and neck of the instance as it continues to approach.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n We're now ready to fire.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Blow it up then.\n\n\nMissile is fired at the specimen, but its head can be seen disconnecting from the body before impact. The targeted area is engulfed in the resulting explosion.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n Is it dead now?\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n I'm not sure if it is. The head looked like it came off right before the impact. Let me check thermal for anything. If it somehow survived that I doubt it was able to get far in good shape.\n\n\nThermal camera displays a flexible limb flailing in the snow. It does not move from its position.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n I see something moving. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Just flailing.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n Trap?\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Maybe or its just beaten up. If so it probably needs time to recover before going on the move again.\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n Should we fire again to finish it off?\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Sounds wasteful to send a third missile on that thing. I think we can get a closer look on foot, and burn it up with flamethrowers. Silent Frankie\n22\n over here can also take control of the turret for me if the worst happens. How's your German?\n\n\nAgent Hofmann:\n I was about to ask you the same question.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n [Laughs] I think we'll do fine. Let's get going.\n\n\nVehicle travels to the location of the incapacitated instance, but stops approximately 4\u00a0m away. The operatives exit the vehicle with one possessing an M9 flamethrower. They proceed to approach the instance, which only consists of the head and upper spine. Two additional eyes that are bloodshot have grown on the face. It is severely burned while flailing strips of tissue can be observed.\n\n\nAgent MaCready:\n Damn thing is barely alive. This'll be easy then. Let's put it out of its misery.\n\n\nThe M9 flamethrower is then used to ignite the instance. It begins to shriek and flail around until movement ceases. The specimen is confirmed neutralized.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 04:\n The following is Incident Report 6839 concerning a coordinated assault by SCP-6839 instance.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 6839\n\n\nSCP involved:\n SCP-6839\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n Mobile Task Forces Alpha-19 (\"Antarctic Guardians\"), \nEta-5 (\"J\u00e4eger Bombers\")\n, and Psi-33 (\"Himmler's Housekeepers\").\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-\u2588\u2588, New Swabia, East Antarctica\n\n\nDescription:\n 39 instances of SCP-6839 attempted to siege Site-\u2588\u2588. Their bodies were notably covered in thick plates of bone, especially around the head in multiple layers. Some instances had their arms terminate in sharp protrusions while others wielded WW2-era firearms. Additionally, there was an instance measuring approximately 3.5\u00a0m in height. It appeared to consist of multiple specimens fused together with no discernable head. Multiple eyes were located across its arms and torso.\n\n\nThe facility performed an emergency lockdown, and engaged SCP-6839 instances with explosive munitions. A distress signal was broadcasted to all nearby facilities for reinforcements. Operatives of Eta-5 proceeded to neutralize the large instance after it breached Gate A. Other instances attempted to assist it by assimilating into its mass or neutralizing on-site artillery. Furthermore, the specimen was observed collecting shrapnel for use as armor. Meanwhile, operatives of Alpha-19 and Psi-33 defended against the rest of the instances.\n\n\nPersonnel were able to successfully repel the SCP-6839 instances, but the site sustained 32 casualties along with costly property damage. Repairs were immediately underway in anticipation of a second siege. Only 6 instances survived the skirmish. Personnel were able to track them to an undocumented cavern located 43\u00a0km away towards the South Pole. A counter-attack was authorized by the O5 Council to be carried out by Alpha-19, and Psi-33.\n\n\nUpon arriving at the location, an elongated fusion of instances emerged from the cavern. It was estimated to be 4.3\u00a0m in length with a width of 1.2\u00a0m. Multiple limbs acted as feelers around the mouth, and portions of the body were covered in armor plating made of bone. The 6 previously mentioned instances also emerged from the cavern. Personnel were able to successfully neutralize them before entering the cavern.\n\n\nOperatives discovered a large space containing dismembered limbs belonging to SCP-6839 instances. Each were individually undergoing regeneration to form a new instance. All instances were promptly incinerated.\n\n\nImpersonation of Third Reich personnel was observed to have little to no effect on the instances throughout the incident. The special containment procedures for SCP-6839 may require reevaluation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 05:\n MI6 provided to the Foundation a debriefing they had performed with Corporal \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He was one of the three survivors of the 1945 Special Air Service mission. The transcript has been edited for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nInterviewer:\n What happened during the mission, corporal?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We arrived at the location after we parachuted down. The entrance of the tunnel didn't seem to be guarded, but there were bones scattered around. Some had bits of clothing on them. I think it was the survey team. Before we could go in with the explosives we were being attacked from all sides.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Germans?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n It was their abominations, yes. They probably thought it was easier to let them pick us off while they hid underground. Their polar men were stopping our advances, but the mortars we had helped to distract them. In the sky there were strange aircraft\n23\n out of our reach. Our planes were engaging them, but it wasn't looking so good up there.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Did you access the tunnel?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Some of us did while the others tried to stop the polar men from pursuing us. Unfortunately, there were more of them inside that were able to push us back out. By that point we decided to collapse the entrance with the explosives we had left. Otherwise, we would've been overwhelmed on both sides.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Was there anything unusual about the tunnel?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yeah, the walls had patterns on them such as straight lines and spirals. It didn't look like concrete either since it was black in color. I can't really tell you anything else. The fighting kept us all occupied.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n So what happened next after the tunnel collapsed?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n The mission was essentially a failure, so retreating seemed like the best option. The polar men chased after us for a while, picking off whoever they can. They eventually stopped when we got far enough.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Then you were rescued?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yes, sir. It was me, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Everyone else was gone by then, but their deaths are still fresh in my mind. I saw those abominations rip apart and eat them whether they were alive or dead. Their mouths seemed wider as they bit off as much as they could chew. The snow around them was dyed crimson. A man could go mad at such sights. They should've been able to go back home instead of dying out there in the cold.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n My sincere condolences, corporal. Their deaths were not in vain.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yeah? Do we have a plan for the Germans? I want them smoked out of their frozen hell hole.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n We'll let you know when we do. Thank you for your time, corporal.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

They possess high intelligence, and great physical strength. Their injuries are healed by devouring other organisms, which may also increase their mass. Damage to the head combined with flames and explosives are sufficient in exterminating them. The creatures were fought in the Great Patriotic War 12 during Comrade Stalin's Tenth Blow. 13 It was the only encounter. ALARIC 14 scientist Dietrich Klossner was responsible for their creation. Details of their development remain unknown, but the use of techniques from flesh-crafters 15 are a possibility. Klossner's researcher was deemed valuable for enhancing the projects of the late Ilya Ivanov. 16 According to informants, the creatures can be found in East Antarctica. SACK 17 currently occupy the region, presumably to exterminate them. Soviet operations in Antarctica must remain alert. 18",
        "Foreword: The following transcript is mostly recorded from within a Barys 8x8 armored combat vehicle of MTF Delta-14 (\"Winter Wonderland\"). It was accompanied by a modified BvS 10 that pulled an autonomous anti-tank guided missile system. <Begin Log> Agent MaCready: I have a visual on the target. Thermal cameras detect 5 instances traversing the Antarctic landscape. Telescopes observe that 2 specimens are moving a 3.7\u00a0cm Flak 43 turret. Agent MaCready: There are five polar men 20 on the move. They're hauling a flak turret. An instance can be seen leading at the front while wearing a German steel helmet, and wielding an MG 81 machine gun. It appears to be instructing other instances. Agent MaCready: It looks like that big guy with the helmet is the leader. I think we're going to need a missile strike for this one. That turret might give us trouble if it still works. It could even be anomalous. Agent Hofmann: You got it, MaCready. Hofmann communicates with the operators of the BvS 10 to activate their missile launch system. They begin targeting the group of SCP-6839 instances. Agent Hofmann: We're set. Agent MaCready: Good. A missile is launched at the targets. Exterior camera observes the explosion in the distance. The surrounding area is engulfed in flames. Agent Hofmann: Did we get them all? Agent MaCready: Wait. The instance wearing the steel helmet can be seen rising out of the snow after the explosion begins dissipating. The left side of its body is charred with the arm missing. In the other arm it is still holding on to the MG 81. Agent MaCready: The big one barely survived, and it looks pissed off. The instance appears to notice the MTF, and begins to move towards their position. Additional limbs can be seen forming from its back. Agent MaCready: It's coming towards us. Send another rocket at it with a lower blast yield. I'm going to slow it down with the turret. The Sarbaz turret 21 locks on to the instance, which begins firing its weapon at the direction of the vehicle. Agent MaCready begins to open fire upon it. The specimen begins performing evasive maneuvers, and throwing snow up in the air. Additionally, it begins to move on all limbs closer to the ground. Agent MaCready: Slippery bastard. Agent Hofmann: What's it doing? Agent MaCready: Trying not to get hit but- The right shoulder of the instance is struck by a round from the turret, losing its arm in the process. A second round is then fired that hit the left side of the torso. Agent MaCready: Got you. Appendages appear to be growing from behind the head and neck of the instance as it continues to approach. Agent Hofmann: We're now ready to fire. Agent MaCready: Blow it up then. Missile is fired at the specimen, but its head can be seen disconnecting from the body before impact. The targeted area is engulfed in the resulting explosion. Agent Hofmann: Is it dead now? Agent MaCready: I'm not sure if it is. The head looked like it came off right before the impact. Let me check thermal for anything. If it somehow survived that I doubt it was able to get far in good shape. Thermal camera displays a flexible limb flailing in the snow. It does not move from its position. Agent MaCready: I see something moving. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Just flailing. Agent Hofmann: Trap? Agent MaCready: Maybe or its just beaten up. If so it probably needs time to recover before going on the move again. Agent Hofmann: Should we fire again to finish it off? Agent MaCready: Sounds wasteful to send a third missile on that thing. I think we can get a closer look on foot, and burn it up with flamethrowers. Silent Frankie 22 over here can also take control of the turret for me if the worst happens. How's your German? Agent Hofmann: I was about to ask you the same question. Agent MaCready: [Laughs] I think we'll do fine. Let's get going. Vehicle travels to the location of the incapacitated instance, but stops approximately 4\u00a0m away. The operatives exit the vehicle with one possessing an M9 flamethrower. They proceed to approach the instance, which only consists of the head and upper spine. Two additional eyes that are bloodshot have grown on the face. It is severely burned while flailing strips of tissue can be observed. Agent MaCready: Damn thing is barely alive. This'll be easy then. Let's put it out of its misery. The M9 flamethrower is then used to ignite the instance. It begins to shriek and flail around until movement ceases. The specimen is confirmed neutralized. <End Log>",
        "Incident Report 6839 SCP involved: SCP-6839 Personnel Involved: Mobile Task Forces Alpha-19 (\"Antarctic Guardians\"), Eta-5 (\"J\u00e4eger Bombers\") , and Psi-33 (\"Himmler's Housekeepers\"). Date: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 Location: Site-\u2588\u2588, New Swabia, East Antarctica Description: 39 instances of SCP-6839 attempted to siege Site-\u2588\u2588. Their bodies were notably covered in thick plates of bone, especially around the head in multiple layers. Some instances had their arms terminate in sharp protrusions while others wielded WW2-era firearms. Additionally, there was an instance measuring approximately 3.5\u00a0m in height. It appeared to consist of multiple specimens fused together with no discernable head. Multiple eyes were located across its arms and torso. The facility performed an emergency lockdown, and engaged SCP-6839 instances with explosive munitions. A distress signal was broadcasted to all nearby facilities for reinforcements. Operatives of Eta-5 proceeded to neutralize the large instance after it breached Gate A. Other instances attempted to assist it by assimilating into its mass or neutralizing on-site artillery. Furthermore, the specimen was observed collecting shrapnel for use as armor. Meanwhile, operatives of Alpha-19 and Psi-33 defended against the rest of the instances. Personnel were able to successfully repel the SCP-6839 instances, but the site sustained 32 casualties along with costly property damage. Repairs were immediately underway in anticipation of a second siege. Only 6 instances survived the skirmish. Personnel were able to track them to an undocumented cavern located 43\u00a0km away towards the South Pole. A counter-attack was authorized by the O5 Council to be carried out by Alpha-19, and Psi-33. Upon arriving at the location, an elongated fusion of instances emerged from the cavern. It was estimated to be 4.3\u00a0m in length with a width of 1.2\u00a0m. Multiple limbs acted as feelers around the mouth, and portions of the body were covered in armor plating made of bone. The 6 previously mentioned instances also emerged from the cavern. Personnel were able to successfully neutralize them before entering the cavern. Operatives discovered a large space containing dismembered limbs belonging to SCP-6839 instances. Each were individually undergoing regeneration to form a new instance. All instances were promptly incinerated. Impersonation of Third Reich personnel was observed to have little to no effect on the instances throughout the incident. The special containment procedures for SCP-6839 may require reevaluation.",
        "<Begin Log> Interviewer: What happened during the mission, corporal? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We arrived at the location after we parachuted down. The entrance of the tunnel didn't seem to be guarded, but there were bones scattered around. Some had bits of clothing on them. I think it was the survey team. Before we could go in with the explosives we were being attacked from all sides. Interviewer: Germans? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It was their abominations, yes. They probably thought it was easier to let them pick us off while they hid underground. Their polar men were stopping our advances, but the mortars we had helped to distract them. In the sky there were strange aircraft 23 out of our reach. Our planes were engaging them, but it wasn't looking so good up there. Interviewer: Did you access the tunnel? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Some of us did while the others tried to stop the polar men from pursuing us. Unfortunately, there were more of them inside that were able to push us back out. By that point we decided to collapse the entrance with the explosives we had left. Otherwise, we would've been overwhelmed on both sides. Interviewer: Was there anything unusual about the tunnel? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah, the walls had patterns on them such as straight lines and spirals. It didn't look like concrete either since it was black in color. I can't really tell you anything else. The fighting kept us all occupied. Interviewer: So what happened next after the tunnel collapsed? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The mission was essentially a failure, so retreating seemed like the best option. The polar men chased after us for a while, picking off whoever they can. They eventually stopped when we got far enough. Interviewer: Then you were rescued? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yes, sir. It was me, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Everyone else was gone by then, but their deaths are still fresh in my mind. I saw those abominations rip apart and eat them whether they were alive or dead. Their mouths seemed wider as they bit off as much as they could chew. The snow around them was dyed crimson. A man could go mad at such sights. They should've been able to go back home instead of dying out there in the cold. Interviewer: My sincere condolences, corporal. Their deaths were not in vain. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah? Do we have a plan for the Germans? I want them smoked out of their frozen hell hole. Interviewer: We'll let you know when we do. Thank you for your time, corporal. <End Log>"
