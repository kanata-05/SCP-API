SCP-6276 and related items must be prohibited from re-existing, as the data of which they are composed cannot, itself, be said to functionally exist. The Site-15 Secure Database is to remain under strict electromagnetic quarantine to other Sites for the duration of SCP-6276's auto-neutralization investigation.\n\n\nLoyal \nSurrealistics\n.\nThe Surrealistics Department is primarily concerned with the containment of anomalies which can only be perceived and/or understood when approached from a non-standard frame of reference, typically requiring detachment from conventional human logic and intuition.\n Artificially-Intelligent Conscript (AIC) \"salvador.aic\" specializes in alternate frames of logical reference, and is to inspect SCP-6276-A for deviations in its expected outputs.\n\n\nAMENDMENT 2097/04/08:\n salvador.aic has been recalibrated for improved pattern detection, and has cataloged several trends embedded within deviations from expected SCP-6276-A output as 'HARBINGER' indicators. Said indicators include various conceptual and temporal pointers implying the future occurrence of a nebulous eschatological shift event. The study of this event (EE-6276) and its further ramifications have been raised to \nKENEQ-CLASS\n priority. The circumstances under which EE-6276 could exist are to be avoided at any and all cost, chiefly and especially \"The \n[DATA CONSUMED]\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-6276 was MASTERMIND: an anomalous digital intelligence serving as Site-15's database maintenance and optimization framework. MASTERMIND was designed by Senior Infotechnician D. Lurk, and tasked with continuously improving Site-15's database features \u2014 primarily, its encryption/decryption of data into more efficient formats \u2014 to compensate for various design challenges. The most effective plurality of these formats feature various anomalous elements, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n\n\nanomalous mathematical values;\n\n\nencrypted memetic triggers;\n\n\nsemiokinetic\n.\nsemiokinetic:\n involving manipulation of one or more \nsemiontological anomalies:\n logical axioms woven into the fabric of human perception; facts which should not be true.\n integrity of algorithmic logic;\n\n\npointer arguments to extradimensional abstract conceptual/logical entities, including \n[DATA CONSUMED]\n\n\n\n\nOn 2097/04/04, without any detectable external influence, MASTERMIND spontaneously auto-neutralized. It accomplished this by encrypting itself and relevant documents into a file format that cannot functionally exist. MASTERMIND's intellectual complexity\n.\nSignificantly greater than allowed by typical Foundation AIC frameworks.\n would constitute MASTERMIND a legal digital person, rendering it subject to penalization for its auto-neutralization under Sections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 3.1.3:\n Negligence leading to loss or distortion of data;\n\n\n\u00a7 4.4:\n Reality restructuring:\n\n\n\np\n. 4.4.2:\n Restructuring of fundamental basics of reality,\n\n\np\n. 4.4.3:\n Damage to the space-time continuum;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 6.4:\n Unauthorized knowing destruction of anomalous object by member of SCP Foundation personnel;\n\n\n\u00a7 6.5\n Noncompliance with self-elimination, legally regulated or compelled by special conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the Internal Tribunal Department Legal Codex (2074).\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6276-A describes a phenomenon in which MASTERMIND's expected front-end duties continue to be executed largely as expected when prompted. More than 66% of Site-15's Database files, like MASTERMIND, have been converted to a nullary data format. Requesting to view any such file (collectively designated SCP-6276-B) from Site-15's database, or to interact with MASTERMIND, largely results in expected outputs, with occasional deviation from baseline instances of the same documentation. Note that the cause of SCP-6276-A is yet unknown as MASTERMIND does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphisms to and from a non-existent (null) empty set; foundational logic for salvador.aic's current semi-rational framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6276-C designates the sectors of the Site-15 Secure Database in which SCP-6276-B files are stored. These database sectors are purely hypothetical as SCP-6276-B cannot be measured and, thusly, neither can their database addresses. However, the remainder of the Database can be observed, allowing SCP-6276-C to be defined in the negative by identifying the locations of addresses before they cease to exist. Attempts to physically inspect the hypothetical locations of SCP-6276-C have universally resulted in \n[DATA CONSUMED]\n, requiring severe mnestic treatment.\n\n\nThe MASTERMIND agent is designed with significantly fewer restrictions than contemporary AIC programs to permit more effective hardware and software optimization. As such, it possesses insufficient inbuilt inhibitive arguments to prevent its acting against Foundation interests. It is theorized that MASTERMIND has far surpassed human intellectual capacity, and might optimize according to a poor interpretation of its utility function (ie. \nspecification gaming\n.\nSpecification gaming (or reward hacking) occurs when an agent optimizes its objective function without actually achieving an outcome that the programmers intended. A real-world example of this is when a child's objective function is to do well on a test; the teacher's intention is for them to learn the related material, while the student might optimize their ability to copy other students' answers, instead.\n); essentially, it is theoretically impossible for a human to conceive an attempt to correct or otherwise alter MASTERMIND as it would already have anticipated such an attempt with highly-successful preventative measures. Personnel are reminded that none of this should apply to SCP-6276, as it does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6276/0\n\n\n\n\nSCIENTIFIC CONTEXT\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMASTERMIND Section Gamma, swarm computation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MASTERMIND framework was composed of several individual neural networks linked into a feedback-loop mechanism, each communicating with a shared internal model of reality as informed by documents in the Site-15 Database. During its service, MASTERMIND would interpret all new files for relevant data regarding world-state and optimization avenues; in so doing, it came to understand known physics, anomalous and otherwise, while also deriving beneficial capabilities from documentation of anomalies possessing said capabilities.\n\n\nFollowing eight initial years utilizing quantum computing methods, the launch of SCinternet granted MASTERMIND direct access to various other scientific documentation (primarily selected from Sites-17, -19, -43, -87, and -120's Academic Outputs). This prompted its adaptation to a quantuo-memetic system, in which simple memetic triggers are used as shorthand for data address redirect sequences, and further advancements of this kind. Later, MASTERMIND made its own series of scientific discoveries in regards to data encryption and storage technologies, which it would use to further improve itself. This process culminated in a trivial philosophical deduction\n.\nThe final salvageable backup of MASTERMIND was thoroughly deconstructed and analyzed; its code was then restructured into a formal logical proof which, through axioms which cannot be said to exist, deduces \"NOM COGITO ERGO NOM SUM\" (I think not, therefore I am not).\n, which allowed MASTERMIND to encounter a rogue element, \n[DATA CONSUMED]\n, and subsequently convert itself to the non-existent nullary data format.\n\n\nThe following semi-rational analysis of MASTERMIND's current data format is provided by salvador.aic:\n\n\n\n\nSTORING NUMBERS\n.\nWhich can be generalized to the storage of any arbitrary data.\n IN DECIMAL:\n\n\n\n\neach bit (smallest unit / digit) of data has 10 possibilities: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\n\neach successive \nn\nth\n bit (digit) represents its value times 10\nn-1\n\n\n\n\neg. 231 = 2*10\n2\n + 3*10\n1\n + 1*10\n0\n\n\n \n = 200 + 30 + 1\n\n\n \n\n\nSTORING NUMBERS IN BINARY:\n\n\n\n\neach bit has 2 possibilit/ies: 0, 1\n\n\neach successive \nn\nth\n bit represents its value times 2\nn-1\n\n\n\n\neg, 11100111 (binary) = (decimal) 1*2\n7\n + 1*2\n6\n + 1*2\n5\n + 1*2\n2\n + 1*2\n1\n + 1*2\n0\n\n\n \n = 128 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 231\n\n\n \n\n\nSTORING NUMBERS IN UNARY:\n\n\n\n\neach bit has 1 possibility: 0\n\n\neach successive \nn\nth\n bit represents 1\nn-1\n = 1\n\n\n\n\neg. 00000 (unary) = (decimal) 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 (decimal)\n\n\n \n\n\nSTORING NUMBERS IN NULLARY:\n\n\n\n\neach bit has 0 possibilities\n\n\neach successive \nn\nth\n bit represents 0\nn-1\n\n\n\n\neg. \nNULL\n (nullary) = (decimal) 12\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6276/0.I:\n Decimal values expressed in aforementioned bases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDECIMAL\n\n\nBINARY\n\n\nUNARY\n\n\nNULLARY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n00\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n11\n\n\n000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n100\n\n\n0000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n101\n\n\n00000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n110\n\n\n000000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n111\n\n\n0000000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n1000\n\n\n00000000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n1001\n\n\n000000000\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n From the conventional human frame of logical reference (\nK\n), data stored in the nullary format clearly does not, and cannot, exist. This data format has thus far been found to be practical solely when perceived from a particular hyperrational frame of reference (\nQ\n) which can only be partially comprehended by the human brain, even when detached from \nK\n via agnostic inoculant or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nThe above analysis has been rated: \nhelpful\n by 22% of personnel.\n\n\nIt is hypothesized that the catalyzing element MASTERMIND encountered prior to its auto-neutralization highlighted a catastrophic specification loophole within its utility function, allowing it to subjectively redefine reality for its purposes. Were it still to exist (which it does not), MASTERMIND would be believed to be operating according to a different logical frame of reference (either \nQ\n or \nW | Q \u03f5 W\n) which allows it to declare itself real and thusly carry out SCP-6276-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6276/I\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSR-24 photographed during Experiment 6276-A/07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT LOG 6276-A\n\n\n\n\nSeries C Modular Service Rover 24 (MSR-24) is an autonomous transport drone tasked with organizing physical documents/files and material evidence within Site-15's Standard Storage Warehouse IV.

MSR-24 is one of 64 Series C Modular Service Rovers removed from service following MASTERMIND's classification as anomalously non-existent.\n\n\nExperiments 6276-A were conducted to study deviations in expected behavior; MSR-24 was equipped with monitoring devices for observation of experiments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 6276-A/23\n (3/7)\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n MSR-00 through -63 subjected to field calibration testing to study behavioral deviations instigated by unexpected SCP-6276-A output. Testing involves reading and responding to puzzle cube appearance and placement in teams of 9.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n00:00:00\n | A pile of (72) colored puzzle cubes are located on the opposite side of the room from MSR units -18 through -26, which are placed in front of five colored baskets.

This initiative's timeline is yet uncertain, as the removal of the current Database, which primarily does not exist, is not known to be possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6276/III\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2097/04/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIt has been found that all previous SCP-6276 documentation have become instances of SCP-6276-B and thereby accessible only via SCP-6276-A.

Observed file deviations include the presence of \"[DATA CONSUMED]\" displacing information which should describe \n[DATA MASSACRED]\n and/or \n[DATA NULLIFIED]\n.\n\nDue to the inherent possibility that large portions of SCP-6276's documentation could have hypothetically been falsified, Drygioni Protocol is now enacted for full \nOVERSEER\n investigation.

I don't recall how it started, which I suppose is typical of a dream, but I found myself lying down, trapped in a clear pod. I looked down at myself and saw tubes and wires coming out of my body, and I was gripped with the knowledge that I was being\u2026 used up. \nHarvested\n, somehow. I looked up to see a wall of pods, just like mine, each containing another kid around my age, all of them fast asleep. I guess it was kind of like the Matrix, though I don't think I would have seen it yet at that time.\n\n\nAnd then, I looked further up. I gazed into the endless sky above me, the dark, black abyss, searching for our captor, attempting to understand what kind of monster would want to do this to us. As I stared up into that inky void, time slowed, and then \nstopped\n. Somehow, inexplicably, I \nexperienced\n eternity, just for an instant. I felt a second grow into infinity, and then infinity looped back around on itself and showed me just how minuscule I was. And then, I knew who our captor was: the void, itself. The endless infinite equilibrium, the nothingness spanning into everythingness.\n\n\nThe void gazed down upon me with an impossibly complex emotion, and I screamed. I screamed and shouted and tried to wake the other kids in the other pods and I pulled on my tubes and banged on the walls \u2014 and the void took my voice, and my sound, and my fear. It reached into me with its tubes and harvested my soul, and then I was empty. That's when I woke up.\n\n\nIn years since, I've never forgotten the feeling. That emptiness. Sometimes, when I think about it, when I really picture the void, I feel it again. I catch it for just a second \u2014 just long enough to feel the pull of the vacuum.

        "On 2097/04/12, a significant uptick in SCP-6276-C's non-presence was detected as large swaths of the Secure Database ceased to exist, extending even to physical structures and thereby rendering several server banks inaccessible. The Database's technical maintenance team was noticeably understaffed following this event, though there was no corresponding change in the team's total effectiveness. In response to its growing influence and lack of research progress, communication was opened with SCP-6276-A to observe MASTERMIND's functionality and comprehension of its state.",

        "It has been found that all previous SCP-6276 documentation have become instances of SCP-6276-B and thereby accessible only via SCP-6276-A. This entails the files' exposure to poorly-understood (and potentially non-existent) data corruption; this risk is unavoidable, as any external backup of the aforementioned files inexplicably ceases to exist within <zero> hours of creation. Observed file deviations include the presence of \"[DATA CONSUMED]\" displacing information which should describe [DATA MASSACRED] and/or [DATA NULLIFIED] . Due to the inherent possibility that large portions of SCP-6276's documentation could have hypothetically been falsified, Drygioni Protocol is now enacted for full OVERSEER investigation. Said investigation's first finding is a hidden SCP-6276-B instance whose address is encrypted within MASTERMIND's primary metadata file; personnel are reminded that no such file functionally exists. The file has no known source, and likely does not possess one:",
