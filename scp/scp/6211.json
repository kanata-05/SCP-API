O5-4 first strenuously objected to, and then reluctantly confirmed, this theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6211-3:\n Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n O5-1\n\n\nINTERVIEWED:\n Dr. L. Lillihammer (Chair, Memetics and Countermemetics, Site-43)\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n After one week of analysis, Dr. Lillihammer requested the re-acquisition of PoI-2011 and a private meeting at Site-01 to report her findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Lillihammer and O5-1 are seated opposite each other in the latter's office.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n You realize of course that we don't, as a rule, make appointments to see people. It usually goes the other way around.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n But you like me.\n\n\nO5-1:\n It's more that I'm interested to hear why you beat your friend with his own CD player.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n He's not my friend. He's an idiot who brought a cognitohazard into my Section, and played it at maximum volume.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n You're not saying\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n \"Wonderful Christmastime\" is one of the most potent, invasive, intrusive, insidious pieces of cognitohazardous 'music' ever created. It is literally impossible for any human being to stumble on that precise combination of monstrous, discordant pap accidentally, much less a goddamn \nBeatle.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Lillhammer:\n Sir Paul McCartney is a hostile memeticist, sir. We should have figured it out when Dr. Blank drove into a ditch back in 2015 while hammering the dial on his car radio. We should've made the connection to all those homicides and suicides every December. The warning signs were all there.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Poor Chuck.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Pardon, sir?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Nothing. Well, we have McCartney in custody now. Would you like to speak with him?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Wait, you don't mean\u2026\n\n\nO5-1:\n Oh, no.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You didn't bring him \nhere,\n did you?!\n\n\n<O5-1 reaches under his desk, and presses a button. There is no response.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Oh, no, no.\n\n\n<A discordant, wavering note sounds in the air, soon joined by others.>\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n SON OF A BI\u2014\n\n\nVoice:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n Dr. Lillihammer was able to neutralize the memetic audio before significant damage was done to personnel or equipment, but PoI-2011 escaped from Site-01 during the confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6211-4:\n Aftermath\n\n\nA note was received at Site-43 the following day, delivered via unknown means.\n\n\n\n\nI didn't know what I was until you picked me up off the street and ran your tests, you bumbling fascist boobs, but I sure as hell know now.\n\n\nI'm a musical magician \u2014 a \nmugician\n \u2014 and I'm going to make every last one of you sing and dance whether you like it or love it.\n\n\nDon't come looking for me, because the next twelve months are going to be very, very busy ones.\n\n\nI've got a lot to learn, and a new album to work on.\n\n\nIt's been a while since I wrote Christmas music.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2011-EX\n has been reclassified from Explained to Pending.
