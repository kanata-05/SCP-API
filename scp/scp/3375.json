All staff of affected aquariums will be debriefed with a similar cover story.\n\n\nCoinage left by SCP-3375 is to be collected and stored in the nearest Foundation-owned facility. Writing left by SCP-3375 is to be removed using methods that are not obtrusive to aquarium inhabitants and onlookers.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3375 refers to an anomalous population of \nHeterocongrinae\n (garden eels) observed to spontaneously manifest in public aquariums in the North American and European continents\n1\n. SCP-3375 instances appear and generally behave identically to their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n\nAccording to the limited collected data, SCP-3375 instances will typically manifest\n2\n in large aquarium displays with sandy substrate ideal for burrowing, and emerge headfirst from the substrate during regular scheduled feeding times. SCP-3375, unlike their non-anomalous counterparts, will readily consume any small pieces of food present, and remain undisturbed by the presence of other animals\n3\n in the area.\n\n\nFollowing the feeding period, SCP-3375 will retreat into the substrate, and after a period of 30 to 60 seconds, will reappear holding a single siglos\n4\n coin in its mouth. An SCP-3375 instance will then deposit the coin on the substrate and withdraw into the burrow it originated from. Once SCP-3375 is no longer in view above the substrate, any evidence of the burrow it apparently occupied disappears. Coins produced by SCP-3375, while in unusually pristine condition, exhibit no anomalous properties.\n\n\nIf no food is introduced to the tank at the time of SCP-3375 manifestation, SCP-3375 will remain at its burrow and placidly observe nearby fish. Should SCP-3375 be kept waiting for food longer than 10 minutes, it will retreat into its burrow without producing coinage\n5\n.\n\n\nOn rare occasions, usually involving multiple instances of SCP-3375 manifesting in the same location, the first SCP-3375 instance to appear will leave its burrow and seek out the nearest flat surface. The SCP-3375 instance will then use its tail to deposit a layer of dark-colored mucus\n6\n to form the script \u201c\u0633\u067e\u0627\u0633\u201d\n7\n. Upon such an act being performed, the SCP-3375 instance will return to its burrow, and all SCP-3375 present will each produce the typical siglos and collect the coins into a small pile, with the first SCP-3375 adding an additional siglos to the top of the collection.\n\n\nIt is noted that SCP-3375 manifest exclusively in water environments that differ widely in animal and plant population from those preferred by their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Of note, individuals of the \nHeterocongrinae\n subfamily are native to the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Atlantic and East Pacific.\n\n\n2\n. Though singular instances of SCP-3375 have been known to manifest, it is more common for two or more SCP-3375 instances to appear together.\n\n\n3\n. SCP-3375 instances will quickly retreat back into their burrows if a human approaches with the intent to extract it from the burrow.\n\n\n4\n. A silver coin issued by the Achaemenid Persian Empire from 520 BCE-450 BCE to 330 BCE, weighing approximately 5.40 to 5.60 grams.\n\n\n5\n. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, this behavior has been observed in three public aquariums. Despite increased Foundation surveillance of the facilities, none of the three aquariums were visited again by SCP-3375.\n\n\n6\n. Lab analyses currently cannot be performed, as the mucus dissipates upon attempt to collect samples.\n\n\n7\n.
