    "all_text": "rating:\u00a0\n+16\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7387 is to be securely stored within a specialized soundproof, climate-controlled containment locker at Site-73, specifically designed to mitigate the anomalous acoustic effects of the item. The locker is equipped with an advanced digital locking mechanism that logs all access by date, time, and personnel identification.\n\n\nAll research interactions with SCP-7387 require prior authorization. A formal request must be submitted and approved by a review panel chaired by Dr. Reese Embers, Level 4 Senior Researcher. Applications for research are evaluated based on merit and potential contribution to understanding SCP-7387\u2019s properties and effects.\n\n\nPersonnel who have been granted access to SCP-7387 must schedule their research sessions no less than two weeks in advance to allow for comprehensive preparation and security clearance. Following any interaction with SCP-7387, personnel must undergo a psychological evaluation to assess any signs of emotional dependency or psychological impact. This assessment is critical to the understanding of SCP-7387\u2019s long-term effects on mental health.\n\n\nTo prevent the risk of dependency and to maintain research objectivity, personnel are restricted to a maximum of two interactions with SCP-7387 per month. This regulation ensures that the research with SCP-7387 remains methodical and that its availability is equitably distributed among the staff at Site-73.\n\n\nContainment breach emergency protocols require that any use of SCP-7387 as a mood stabilizer outside of approved research parameters must be sanctioned by at least two Level 4 Senior Researchers, with Dr. Embers being a mandatory signatory due to his extensive experience with the anomaly.\n\n\nThe procedures and guidelines surrounding SCP-7387 are subject to continuous evaluation and adjustment. Dr. Embers leads regular audits of the containment protocols, with the objective of adapting to any new insights into SCP-7387\u2019s anomalous effects and balancing them against the psychological welfare of Foundation personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7387 being played on a record player\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7387 is a vinyl record of the 1994 album \u201cDookie\u201d\n1\n by the band Green Day\n2\n . While it appears physically identical to any standard issue of the album, it possesses anomalous properties that manifest when the record is played. Listeners experience a state of euphoria and an enhanced sense of well-being akin to the psychotropic effects of cannabis\n3\n, albeit without any chemical interaction or physiological dependency. Dr. Embers, the primary researcher, refers to the phenomenon as \u201ceuphonic euphoria.\u201d\n\n\nThe object came to the Foundation\u2019s attention following a series of reports from a Berkeley, California record store\n4\n, which cited unusually high customer contentment levels associated with this particular record. The store\u2019s proprietor, a punk music enthusiast, did not have a clear recollection of the record\u2019s origin, claiming it appeared mysteriously in his collection.\n\n\nUnder Dr. Embers\u2019 supervision, a series of controlled experiments confirmed SCP-7387\u2019s benign effects. These include significant mood enhancement, increased sociability, and a general state of relaxation persisting for approximately thirty minutes post-exposure. Subjects frequently report nostalgic flashbacks during the listening experience, suggesting the record\u2019s effect extends into the cognitive realm, triggering specific memories associated with listeners\u2019 formative years.\n\n\nDr. Embers advocates for SCP-7387\u2019s use as a supplementary mental health resource within the Foundation, proposing that its unique properties could serve as a non-pharmaceutical therapeutic aid for staff. His ongoing research aims to further understand SCP-7387\u2019s potential applications and to establish protocols for its safe use. The goal is to harness the anomaly\u2019s positive effects to alleviate stress and improve overall morale among Foundation personnel without undermining operational security or effectiveness.\n\n\nAddendum 7387.1 - Experiment Log and Personal Reflections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7387-01:\n\n\nObjective:\n\nTo evaluate the immediate psychological effects of SCP-7387 on D-Class personnel and monitor for any adverse effects or anomalous behavior.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nFive D-Class subjects were individually exposed to the complete playback of SCP-7387 in a secure observation room equipped with audiovisual recording devices. Baseline psychological evaluations were conducted prior to exposure.\n\n\nResults:\n\nSubjects exhibited consistent elevations in mood, characterized by spontaneous smiling, laughter, and expressions of contentment. No adverse reactions occurred. Post-exposure, subjects reported a persistent sense of well-being lasting up to several hours. Psychological evaluations indicated significant reductions in reported anxiety and stress levels.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Embers\u2019 Personal log entry:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s trials were a success, and it seems we\u2019ve got the most cheerful group of D-Class on record. It\u2019s not every day you see a hardened criminal humming \u2018Basket Case.\u2019\n5\nThe good mood is contagious, even the guards were tapping their feet. Note to self: propose \u2018Dookie\u2019 as a mandatory Monday morning ritual for the site \u2014 just kidding\u2026 unless?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7387-02:\n\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine the impact of SCP-7387 on cognitive performance, creativity, and group dynamics within Dr. Embers\u2019 research team.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nThe research team was exposed to SCP-7387 during their scheduled break times over one week. Cognitive and creativity tests were administered before the week began and after each \u2018Dookie\u2019 session. Team meetings were held post-exposure to discuss ongoing projects and problem-solve.\n\n\nResults:\n\nTest scores for problem-solving and creativity saw a notable increase during the week. Observations during team meetings showed an enhanced group cohesion and a more open exchange of innovative ideas. Staff reported feeling more motivated and engaged with their work.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Embers\u2019 Personal log entry:\n\n\u201cWho knew that \u2018Coming Clean\u2019\n6\n could actually lead to literal moments of clarity? The team\u2019s never been so lively; even Sanders, who\u2019s about as expressive as a teaspoon, was full of suggestions. It\u2019s fascinating \u2014 the music seems to act as a cognitive lubricant, and I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 could we have found the ultimate anti-procrastination tool?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7387-03:\n\n\nObjective:\n\nTo introduce SCP-7387 to senior staff members and assess its feasibility for broader application within the Foundation\u2019s staff welfare programs.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nA \u2018team-building exercise\u2019 was organized for senior staff, incorporating SCP-7387 exposure into the session. Participants were not informed of the record\u2019s anomalous properties to gauge unbiased responses.\n\n\nResults:\n\nThe session facilitated an unprecedented level of openness among the participants, breaking down typical hierarchical structures. Many expressed regret when the session concluded. However, there was initial resistance to the idea of implementing SCP-7387 Foundation-wide due to concerns over potential misuse or dependence.\n\n\nDr. Embers\u2019 Personal log entry:\n\n\u201cI could barely contain my excitement \u2014 to see the brass so relaxed, so\u2026 human, was nothing short of miraculous. Yet, as expected, they\u2019re playing hot potato with the idea of implementing it. But I\u2019ve got a feeling that today\u2019s session has planted a seed of change. Time to prepare for the next round \u2014 let\u2019s bring the house down, or should I say, the Foundation up!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7387.2 - Audio Log 7387-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting regarding the use of SCP-7387 for staff welfare\n\n\nAttendees: Dr. Reese Embers, Ethics Committee member Marco Mentumi, Senior Researcher Dr. Marcus Liang , and Site Director Dr. Julian Keats.\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\n Let\u2019s commence. Dr. Embers, you\u2019ve requested this meeting to discuss the potential application of SCP-7387 for\u2026 recreational use, was it?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n Not just recreation, Mr. Mentumi. It\u2019s about mental health. Our staff faces unimaginable stress daily. My proposal outlines a controlled, safe environment for SCP-7387 use \u2014 to ease the psychological burden.\n\n\nDr. Liang:\n With all due respect, Dr. Embers, this feels like a slippery slope. How do we prevent dependency? What if it affects operational readiness?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n The effects are temporary and have shown no sign of dependency. It\u2019s less about creating a crutch and more about providing a mental health tool. Think of it as a\u2026 punk rock therapy session.\n\n\nDr. Keats:\n Therapy is one thing, Reese. But we cannot ignore the possible perception issues. The Foundation is not a place for\u2014\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n With due respect, sir, perception must not trump our staff\u2019s well-being. We\u2019re not discussing a free-for-all; it\u2019s structured, scheduled use, with clear guidelines.\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\n And if those guidelines fail? If it becomes a crutch?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n I\u2019ll personally oversee the implementation. We\u2019ll have strict protocols, mandatory waiting periods, psychological screenings \u2014 the whole nine yards.\n\n\nDr. Liang:\n It seems like a band-aid solution, Embers. What about long-term effects? Have those been considered?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n The long-term effects of not addressing our staff\u2019s mental health are far more concerning, Dr. Liang. And we have data showing only benefits thus far.\n\n\nDr. Keats:\n But we can\u2019t just \u2018jam out\u2019 to solve our problems, Dr. Embers. I can\u2019t authorize this.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n I understand your hesitations. But I urge you to reconsider. Music has power \u2014 and this could be revolutionary for us.\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\nWe will take your proposal under advisement, Dr. Embers. But as of now, the committee is not convinced. Meeting adjourned.\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7387.3 - Incident Report 7387-IR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Summary: Unrest and Agitation of D-Class Personnel Date: [REDACTED]Location: Site-73, D-Class Dormitories Report Filed By: Dr. Reese Embers\n\n\nEvent Description:\n\n\nAt approximately 2200 hours, a riot commenced among the D-Class population in the East Wing Dormitories. Tensions had been escalating for several days due to stricter containment procedures implemented site-wide. The incident began with verbal altercations and escalated to physical confrontations between inmates.\n\n\nResponse Actions:\n\n\nUpon notification, Dr. Reese Ember proposed the use of SCP-7387 to de-escalate the situation. Initially met with skepticism by the Site Director, permission was reluctantly granted as a last resort to avoid potential casualties and further unrest.\n\n\nDr. Embers, accompanied by a security detail, entered the dormitories with a portable record player and began playing SCP-7387. As the record played, the riotous noise began to subside; agitated D-Class individuals gradually became calm and compliant. The music permeated the area, and within minutes, a noticeable shift in the atmosphere occurred.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n-Immediate cessation of violent behavior among D-Class personnel.\n\n-No injuries or fatalities reported following the intervention.\n\n-SCP-7387\u2019s effects lasted for approximately 30 minutes, during which the D-Class personnel were peacefully escorted back to their cells.\n\n-Post-incident interviews indicated a unanimous sense of well-being and a temporary suspension of hostile intentions.\n\n\nFollow-Up:\n\n\nDr. Embers recommended a debrief for all staff involved, praising the efficacy of SCP-7387 as a non-lethal, humane crowd control measure. This incident has prompted a reassessment of SCP-7387\u2019s potential applications within the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Embers\u2019 Notes:\n\n\n\u201cThe riot was quelled not with force, but with the universal language of music. Today, \u2018Dookie\u2019 did more than just play; it reminded us that even the most troubled souls could find solace in a melody. This is concrete evidence that SCP-7387 has more to offer than just a \u2018good time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Addendum:\n\n\nEnhanced security measures and behavioral monitoring are to be implemented for D-Class personnel. Dr. Embers\u2019 intervention will be analyzed for potential protocol development in crisis de-escalation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7387.4 - Audio Log 7387-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the final review meeting regarding the application of SCP-7387 for mental health purposes within the Foundation, post-incident 7387-IR.\n\n\nDate: [REDACTED]Location: Site-73 Conference Room B Present: Dr. Reese Embers, Ethics Committee Member Marco Mentumi, Senior Researcher Dr. Marcus Liang, and site director Dr. Julian Keats.\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\n Let\u2019s come to order. Dr. Embers, in light of the recent D-Class incident, your proposal is back on the table. Impress us.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n Thank you. I believe the incident report speaks volumes. SCP-7387\u2019s potential as a therapeutic and crisis management tool is\u2014\n\n\nDr. Liang:\n \u2014A fluke? Dr. Ember, it worked once. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a solution.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n With respect, it\u2019s not just the incident. My research shows consistent, positive outcomes. It\u2019s a tool, not a cure-all. We need to be progressive.\n\n\nDr. Keats:\n The risk of dependency still concerns us.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n Understandable, but we control the access. We monitor usage. The benefits are palpable. We have a responsibility\u2014\n\n\nDr. Liang:\n To security, not feel-good measures.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n To our people. Morale is security. A happy Foundation is an efficient one. We\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s not be so archaic.\n\n\nSilence\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\n Your passion is\u2026 infectious, Dr. Ember. And the results are, admittedly, intriguing.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n \u201cInfectious\u201d is a choice word here, but thank you.\n\n\nDr. Liang:\n \nSigh\n What do you propose?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n Controlled, recorded sessions. Voluntary participation. Regular reviews. We document everything. This could revolutionize how we handle stress and mental health.\n\n\nDr. Keats:\n And if there\u2019s a sign of dependency?\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n We pull back immediately. The safety nets are there. We\u2019re cautious by design.\n\n\nPause\n\n\nMr. Mentumi:\n Very well. We will greenlight a trial period. Strict oversight. Dr. Embers, don\u2019t make us regret this.\n\n\nDr. Embers:\n You won\u2019t. I assure you.\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

We document everything. This could revolutionize how we handle stress and mental health. Dr. Keats: And if there\u2019s a sign of dependency? Dr. Embers: We pull back immediately. The safety nets are there. We\u2019re cautious by design. Pause Mr. Mentumi: Very well. We will greenlight a trial period. Strict oversight. Dr. Embers, don\u2019t make us regret this. Dr. Embers: You won\u2019t. I assure you. End Log",
