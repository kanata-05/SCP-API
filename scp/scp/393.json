The vitals of D-393 are to be monitored at all times to prevent SCP-393 from 'linking' to important SCP personnel in the event of D-393's death. A secondary D-class subject will remain on stand-by for emergency reclamations of SCP-393 if D-393 should die.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-393 is an ordinary 9\u00a0cm x 14\u00a0cm blue day planner with a year embroidered into its cover that always matches the current year. The information on the back of the day planner reveals it to be a product of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 publishing. SCP-393 has the ability to 'link' to a nearby subject via unknown means. Once linked, the day planner will appear in the hands of its owner whenever it is not being watched. Additionally, any event written in the past dates of the day planner are instantly recalled by the subject as if they experienced it themselves. Events written in a future date of SCP-393 will elicit no change until the date of the event has passed, at which time the subject will recall the event. If the subject currently linked with SCP-393 dies, SCP-393 will choose a new owner within ten minutes of the previous owner's demise, based on proximity. There appears to be no maximal distance for this ability (for additional details, see \ntesting log\n).\n\n\nInterview Log 393-1a\n\n\nInterviewed\n: Test 393-1 subject\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword\n: Review of subject's mental state after Test 393-1 and the extent of memory alteration .\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, 5:31 \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2\u2588\u2588\u2588>\n\n\n''Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:'' So you say you spent the day yesterday at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Park with your girlfriend Cindy.
