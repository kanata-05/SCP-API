Further information is available upon request.\n\n\nSCP-8044 succumbed to injuries sustained January 14, 2024.\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015,\n SCP-8044 emancipated itself from Foundation custody. It was presumed lost and granted Pending-Neutralized status.\n\n\nOn January 13, 2024,\n Sebastian Smith, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, surrendered himself to Foundation custody bearing information on possible interactions with SCP-8044. Pertinent sections of his debrief are attached, edited for clarity of tone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was around finals, a year and a few months ago;\u2014I recall this time so well as I do every indelible stain of misery concomitant with school semesters. \nPff.\n But specifically, here, I\u2019m referring to the awful limbo I often encounter on their tail ends. And quite then\u2014lachrymose and dreaming of static, putting aside a few other colorful melodramatics,\u2014is where we first met.\n\n\n \nThe exact scene was set in the evening of a rainy warmer winter, where I might imagine myself slouched over the windowsill in a weary mood\u2014the soft, homely glow of oil light flickering in reflection across my \nglazed\n eyes, but in truth, I held a menial absence that resisted any romanticism. I was just alone, gazing out at darkness bereft of anything\u2026 That was then until\u2014and appearing to me only beside a break in my thoughts, so that an inordinary thing might be noticed at all,\u2014nuzzled against the brickwork, there was a little starling, shivering and wet.\n\n\n \nSo I mused, \nHow rare,\n on that a bird should stray so close\u2026 \nYou\u2019d rather be inside, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m in your way; is that why you\u2019ve come?\n\n\n \nAnd two quick chirps followed: \u201cIn-deed!\u201d\n\n\n \nAscribe it to the mood, or that parrots have been renowned for as much, but I didn\u2019t react insofar as one without any experience with the preternatural might, and I invited him in\u2014should he understand me further. Then, he did, and it was quite the night. To be quite honest about it, I amounted everything to a dream until I came to my senses beside him in the morn.\u2014Because who would have guessed that he\u2014with the entire world on the edge of his wingtips\u2014could be as lonely as I?\n\n\n \nAt first, the arrangement was simple: his nearby nest\u2019d been blown apart, and he wished for a brief respite from life, so I kept my window cracked open during the day, and he\u2019d stay with me over the night; however, soon enough, he\u2019d tend to stay the day, too. Where I\u2019d been rotting through the last weeks of the semester, I found myself putting on a brave and endearing front when Anomaly (as he\u2019d refer himself) would come around, and in another week, that fa\u00e7ade became truth, and I was happy to have found a friend.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nCome winter break, we struck a deal that I might prop my window open a smidge and against regulation, but for who he was to me already, it was no matter, and then I was again lonely for that time whereby I was away and home. I met with old friends for whom I didn\u2019t anymore care, and there persisted a painful awareness of whom I\u2019d like to talk to just then instead. Alas, I\u2019d to wait a month.\u2014So I did, and I came back with a new smile, for he\u2019d waited just there for me\u2014him being to me as I was to him. And there was our beginning: love not quite at first sight, but it came around quickly enough\u2026 unspoken, anyway.\n\n\n \nA month and a half into there, he was perched up in a nest atop a shelf I\u2019d helped him to establish some weeks prior, and I was on my bed below, both of us focused on the TV.\u2014It was some movie I can\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure I recommended it, but my eyes were tearing any focus I struggled to keep into blurry obscurity. Behind which, my mind only filled with what I\u2019d needed to say.\n\n\n \n\u2018Nom,\n\n\n \n\u201cYea-h?\u201d He twitched over to meet my gaze, \u201cSome\u2019s the ma-tter?\u201d\n\n\n \nAnd I committed with a gesture\u2026 \nWould you like to rest here, instead?\n\n\n\u201cHeh. If you-d\ntch\n like me to\u2014sure.\u201d And he fluttered down to the crevice of my arm and elbow.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nIt was after that movie that I didn\u2019t see him for some time, actually,\u2014perhaps a week\u2026 \nsix-and-a-half days\u2026\n There were a few speeches I toyed with in that timeframe, and it was a week of fantastic daydreaming till I would once again see him, so when upon my sill he dropped, I had a great many things to say, and yet\u2014post greetings\u2014only the crudest things came out of me.\n\n\nWould you mind if I would like to touch you?\n\n\n\u2026which he thought was a tad silly when we\u2019ve been in contact plenty, so I stuttered out the latter half again until he understood, and when he did, he said he\u2019d never considered such a thing! \nEr.\n Ultimately, he wanted to take things slower than I, and I obliged him, of course. Henceforth, however, days would come and go where I\u2019d not hear a single word as he\u2019d speak\u2014too transfixed on his supple frame, perched-perched atop those delicate legs\u2026 I\u2019d catch myself salivating and try to salvage without him being any the wiser. But this was strange; why do I like him so much? Men like women;\u2014that\u2019s how it works,\u2014so why on Earth am I in musth over a bird? It\u2019s driving me almost as crazy as he\u2019s\u2026\n\n\n \nI took up birdwatching over it, actually\u2014\ner,\n birdvoyeurism;\u2014at any rate, I take no interest in other avians\u2014just him. Perhaps to do with his sapience, then, but no matter\u2026 my answer was quite simple: I\u2019m not some kind of fetishist, and no depth of inquiry will counteract anything I already know\u2014what my feelings speak as truth. \nSo about what I said last week\u2026 I know we haven\u2019t talked about it as much as maybe either of us would have liked.\n Uhh, \nthis isn\u2019t about desire so much as it is that I\u2026 I\u2019ve never wanted to be closer to someone before, but I want to be closer to you, and I think I didn\u2019t quite know how to express that, and I just had to say something, and it just got away from me in the moment. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nCome summer, then, I stayed in Philly. So I said to everybody back home that work was available, but it was truly in large part to do with him\u2014to not part with him. It was around that time we both relaxed into each other\u2019s presence a little more, and he began to open up to where I\u2019d jumped ahead.\u2014Wherein, we did start canoodling a little more\u2026 I\u2019d kiss him on the head and he\u2019d peck me back, which is a lot more soft and affectionate than it sounds. And he began to talk to me of his past, of you, of disdain. Well.\n\n\nAt any rate, the gears of academia spun again in the fall, and it spawned a new group of anecdotes that might give semblance to the niceties of our daily lives together in that time, but I\u2019ll refrain to only say: it truly, moreso than even before, felt like we\u2019d begun to merge into a coexistence, and I began working up the courage to tell him something I\u2019d been feeling for a long time.\n\n\n \nSo when a night upon which the rain fell terribly hard against darkness bereft of\u2014on like that which we met, is all\u2014that I did lay myself in the same mist, same cherubic dew of the tip of my lips, that I spoke thenceforth unsaid things to him.\n\n\n \nAnomaly\u2026 you\u2019ve brought a kindly kind of light back to my life this past while, and I hope I\u2019ve managed similarly with yours. And in that time of us together, I\u2019ve felt us growing similarly\u2014perhaps toward a future where we might stay together, and I\u2019d like it to be so. I want to be with you, Anomaly, and I think I love you.\n And I bit my cheek to hold from quivering, and rain masked stray tears running across them.\n\n\n \nWe exchanged no more words, but he walked up my arm and pressed his head in the path of my waterworks. That night, we remained unmoving till the rain ceased to fall.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nHowever.\n\n\nFor weeks after, he strayed toward leaving something unspoken, and he shied from my usual provocations. The most I could coax out was how he didn\u2019t yet have the words to explain his thoughts. \nBut why? You need only reiterate what I\u2019ve already said. I know you, Anomaly. Just say it.\n But he\u2019d stay up in his nest, reticent while here and unreachable when not, and no word nor action I could make could avail me of him. Then, my folks called me home over the winter break, so I closed an anxious door and would spend every second spinning for how his thoughts would finally unfurl.\n\n\n \nIt started when I lost nails on the long drive home, and once there, racking my head turned to days of infrequent fits and bruises. I evinced nothing, and I felt no less alone than when I was with him. \nDon\u2019t I know him anymore? What might he be refusing to say to me?\u2014\nSee that he drove me so easily to contempt in his wake. And in another week of break, I might stub my toe and lash embarrassingly. But he\u2019s been unfair to me!\u2014How can I bleed to him and leave so unrequited?\n\n\nhhuh.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nAfter the New Year, I\u2019m back on campus, and there\u2019s not a recent trace of him left\u2014just evidence of our last night together and nothing thereafter. My heel taps actual divots into the floorboard over the hours of the week I returned and sit alone before the window, but I won\u2019t bawl until something \ntells\n me he\u2019s never coming back. I tap, I tap, I tap, and I tap, and I tap, and I ache\u2026 \nDo I feel love?\n\n\n \nMy eyes trace clouds against a grey sky\u2014soon then pierced by sunrise,\u2014and I squint through tears and dazzling day, gold through my eyes, but turned within, I only see starless and bible black.\n\n\n \nThat\u2019s, \nuhh,\n Richard Palmer-James, which just felt\u2014 \nGod! Did he ever love me?\n I mean, to do this, what kind of man?\u2014Well, \nheh.\n And I did see him again, through just twenty more minutes of simmering melancholy, when a speck of black began growing in eclipse against my sun. Its shadow fell across my eyes, and I sighed when the very last visible rays blazed only through the display of his wingspan, beating soft gyrations into the winter air. But he alighted with grace and brushed against my cheek and spoke.\n\n\n \n\u201cSeba, you al-right?\u201d\n\n\n \nAnd to entertain anything in that sequence but the utmost affection would have been absurd, so here he is, \nmy imperfect angel.\n He hops from the sill to my desk and carefully strides across to its edge before turning his head back on me. To sit and watch these avian motions always stirs me of him\u2014the way his feathers ruffle when he\u2019s nervous.\n\n\n \n\u201cWell, there\u2019s been somethin\u2019 I need to talk about you with.\u201d\n\n\n \nLo the creak that overcomes his voice on the verge of tears. He speaks so softly now, words as whispers. I could listen for hours.\u2014Hearing him transition to a statement of infidelity cuts my train of thought.\n\n\n \nExcuse me?\n\n\n \nAnd he reiterates his unfaithfulness. And I don\u2019t have the words.\n\n\n \nBut he wants to be with me, so he then says, and I hear again every wintertide thought with a new justification.\u2014What is flaking for months, disappearing from my reach for days at a time, and this? Just a lie. I utter back and speak in finality something to now I cannot recall, and he steps aback, turns, and takes off in silent flight\u2014flitting between the branches of a nearby tree and gone.\n\n\n \nI\u2019m not sure \nWhat just happened?\n And guilt\u2014more dread\u2014envelops me. I crash well down the stairs and tear across the lawn and up the tree and spoke but for the sharpest beckonings I might muster after him, but my body shudders so that I slip feet down to the grass to lie and let crying overtake me awhile, and all that happened before I settled on driving out and finding my way here with a certain incivility to the scene that\u2019s beginning to sting and set hard in my gut like I\u2019m frothing to remediate when I\u2019m more prepared to articulate myself against him\u2026 \nhuhhh\n \u2026how he\u2019s played with my feelings like I was never anything to him\u2014to teach him just how much \nI\n care. And I can\u2019t say this has helped any one bit, \nbut can you help me find him?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 01/15/2024:\n MTF-529 was dispatched to The University of Pennsylvania in attempt to locate and recover SCP-8044.\n\nSebastian Smith was interrogated again within the interim. Transcript below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I might\u2019ve come hot off the rails the other day in my vehemence of the moments and reliving them so vividly, but things aren\u2019t so serious\u2014I don\u2019t think\u2014to have warranted such a panic. We just broke down a little, or I broke down on him, and it was a bit ugly, but we can surely recover\u2026\n\n\n \nI just want to take it all back and sit down with him the other day. In these last two, my time\u2019s consumed in your housing mulling and coming up only that I\u2019m just as much a culpability.\u2014I mean, roiling in contempt over anything is a childish display aside \nhis\n experiences. I don\u2019t deserve to retain and continue any grievance so fleeting, and so many words of his spoke that he wouldn\u2019t have done anything else than what he did\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m the sole fault for misreading it at the time.\n\n\n \nI still want his apology, but I think mine to him may be foremost owed.\n\nAnd on the topic, even, if you still struggle to see\u2026 you only believe whatever I decided to speak on my behalf the other day\u2014my disparagement of his name; what did I denote other than only that I don\u2019t care for him as I do myself? I think I want you to know that and that I seek to set things straight and speak henceforth only in a less self-serving state of mind.\n\n\n \nWhat I\u2019m sure of is that he does love me, but I\u2019m not sure that stretches into monogamy or romance in his mind. Maybe we were only ever friends, and maybe I\u2019m nothing more to him, and maybe he can\u2019t conceive of more; in which case, I think I implicated him in a crime of my own fantasy. I don\u2019t want to think anymore;\u2014I wish someone could tell me who to blame and why without such a headache.\n\n\n \nI get so up in my own emotions so tiringly easily, and I hate it\u2014how hard it becomes to think straight for myself. \nAnd yet,\n the pressure that stirs me is shouldered threefold by him, and it\u2019s so unfair that I lament anything he hasn\u2019t\u2026 I need to grow up at some point; I was so \nrude,\n and I was so \ninconsiderate\n of his feelings that I just\u2026\n\n\n \nI don\u2019t know his thoughts, and I certainly didn\u2019t let him fully speak his there and then, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have ascribed anything to anything without \nactually\n listening to him. I just shot off at the hip like I always manage to do-and I interrupted and screwed us-and I should\u2019ve just kept my \nfucking\n mouth shut. I\u2019m always ruining everything for myself-and I don\u2019t understand how I can change when at every opportunity do so I just lose it all over again. I \nneed\n Anomaly in my life; I can\u2019t lose him. I don\u2019t know what I would be without him. But I don\u2019t know how to have him, and I don\u2019t know what to do. And turning this into some \npity party\u2026\n that\u2019s not my intention; I just want to get out my complacency and guilt in the matter at hand and in the relationship or whatever it was. And I\u2019m sorry to cry and shriek like this isn\u2019t professional\u2026 this isn\u2019t who I\u2019m supposed to be.\u2014Oh for Christ, Anomaly, I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n\nI just have that to say to him, anymore. That\u2019s all I need to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 01/16/2024:\n MTF-529 tracked feathers matching that of a European starling to the den of a local feral cat, where they then recovered SCP-8044\u2019s microchip ID implant from within the cat\u2019s stomach contents.\n\nSCP-8044 reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8043\n | SCP-8044 | \nSCP-8045\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8044\n\" by Savanac, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
