The file must remain preserved in its current state, as it is the subject of an ongoing murder investigation.\n\n\nEdits are prohibited at this time.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this picture MUCH MUCH better than your other one Dr. Taylor!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6863\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nSafe\n Presumed Neutralized\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The fragments of SCP-6863 are to be kept in a standard evidence locker located in Site-42\u2019s Security Department.\n\n\nDescription:\n : \nSCP-6863 appears to be a circular white plastic button (70.8mm) set in a black plastic base (87.9\u00a0mm). When pressed, the object emits a slightly distorted sound clip exclaiming \u201cThat\u2019s A Wonderful Idea!\u201d\n\n\nSubjects who interact with the object have claimed to feel a sense of renewed confidence in any idea or plan they had been considering at the time. Subjects become irrevocably convinced to follow through with said idea.\n\n\nFurther testing utilizing SCP-6863 as a means of improving morale within the ranks of Class C individuals is currently being spearheaded by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Taylor. Utilizing SCP-6863 as a possible alternative to amnestics for agents suffering from psychological traumaaaaAAAA oh golly I guess that\u2019s my cue.\n\n\nHow do you write one of these fancy things? Let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n\nSCP-6863 appears to be in pieces! It appears to have bubbling bits of your bitch brain coating all the cute little cracks Dr. Taylor! What\u2019s black & white and red all over Dr. Taylor? Your magic button!\n\n\nWOOPSIE! I think I might\u2019ve heard your gurgling corpse shit the floor just now. Gross! You\u2019re making a mess all over your fancy carpet.\n\n\nHave some decency! You are EMBARRASSING yourself in front of a peasant! Rude rude rude Dr. Taylor. Rude rude rude.\n\n\nBoy I tell ya, I feel all sorts of legitimized sitting here at your desk. Typing away. I\u2019m a real smarty pants now huh? Writing a fancy paper like the rest of you hot-shot researchers.\n\nThis means I matter now right? I matter now right? I matter now right? I matter now right? I matter now right? I matter now right?

I\u2019m writing words. I\u2019m writing woRDS! Doing the real work. DOING THE REAL WORK! Words words words.\n\n\nWatch this: hewrehgiytewdzbvmb. Dysfaeqrgh no f j geyir wteaetzvj.

I\u2019m just a field agent, after all. ONLY a field agent. I\u2019m out there breaking my bones. Bleeding myself dry. Looking the monsters in the eye. \nShowing them my face\n.\n\n\nBut you? You got the real tough job, dontcha doc? You\u2019re the real motherfucking hero. You sit here at a desk and \nwrite words\n!\n\n\nThen you drag my bony ass in here once a week, pretend to listen to a single word I say, tell me to say something nice about myself and CLICKITY CLACK PAP PAP PAP THAT\u2019S A WONDERFUL IDEA THAT\u2019S A WONDERFUL IDEA!!!!!!!!\n\n\nYou know, this is easier than I thought! Much easier than I thought. Pressing buttons. Writing words.\n\n\nI've got message for all you folks down there in in the offsite trenches. Now's the time for action. Yeah, you! You know what to do! Now's the time! Do it! Write words to matter!\n\n\nYOU\u2019VE BEEN CHOSEN\n\n\nUh oh!\n\n\nThere\u2019s banging at the door. I think they know what happened. I think they heard you begging. I think they heard me laughing. Or maybe somebody is watching me write this? I guess our session is over.\n\n\nHere they come\u2026 They\u2019re very upset with me. I can hear them calling to me from hell. They\u2019re throwing a real fit over this.\n\n\nI wish I could have asked you for advice on how to finish my fancy shmancy research paper, Dr. Taylor. I think I was onto something here!\n\n\nOh well.\n\n\nI\u2019ll miss our little chats. You really were the highlight of my week.\n\n\nNow you\u2019re just a shit-covered corpse on the floor. You are clumps of brain bits & brown hair clinging to what\u2019s left of a broken button.\n\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nYou were right! You were fucking right!
