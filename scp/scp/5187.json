Notes in the document are the best way of documentation and communication. It is not our concern that \nsmaller departments\n prefer more inconvenient methods, like embedding e-mails into the article.\n\n\n \n\n\nApprehension:\n\n\nDue to its focus on art inspiration and the low purity of cognitohazard conveyance, it is assumed that SCP-5187 was created by an individual associating with GoI-0267 (\"Are We Cool Yet?\"), since work of this quality is in accordance with this GOI's more rudimentary cognitohazard creation.\n\n\nA meme was constructed, to instil the idea in the subject to visit a designated meeting point in Manhattan. This meme was constructed in a way that will most likely only affect individuals associating with the themes of SCP-5187 and GOI-0267.\n\n\nThe local containment team has been instructed to observe the meeting point. The meme has been released to the public to catch the subject.\n\n\nNote:\n \nThis containment team seems to fulfill our standards. Should we order a reassignment?\n\n\nReproduction:\n\n\nA separate team of Central Memetics Department researchers has been tasked with reproducing SCP-5187 based solely on the concepts SCP-5187 is made of. The team did not have access to SCP-5187.\n\n\nAfter 2 weeks the team was able to reproduce a version of SCP-5187. Additionally, the conveyance purity could be increased by 32%, and Background Concepts reduced by 9%. This version of SCP-5187 now requires at least Level 3 Memetic Resistance for full neutralization.\n\n\nInterview:\n\n\nAs expected the creator of the first version of SCP-5187 arrived at the designated meeting point and was apprehended. An interview was deemed unnecessary. The subject was amnesticized and released to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file is archived since all research has been completed. All information about SCP-5187 can now be found in the concept and cognitohazard repository under NOO-745933.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nRe:SUBJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Central Memetics Department\n\n\nFrom:\n \nExplanation and Research Department\n\n\nSubject:\n Reexplaining Project: SCP-5187\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the Reexplaining Project, my department is proposing reopening research into SCP-5187. ExaRD has filed SCP-5187 as a \"potential anomaly\". In its current state, this file does not provide sufficient evidence for anomalous behaviour. The observed reactions can easily be attributed to normal emotional responses, which may or may not be the intention of the artist. At the very least more creative analysis should be considered.\n\n\nRegards\n\nDirector Weld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Explanation and Research Department\n\n\nFrom:\n Central Memetics Department\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Reexplaining Project: SCP-5187\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no reason for reopening the archived file of NOO-745933. The research was completed using Standard Procedure, no further action is required. The paranormal science of memetics is completely understood, but recognizing its nuances requires a certain expertise in this field. We therefore highly suggest not to take any further inquiries into memetic SCP-Objects in general. Such actions might compromise your department's usefulness to the Foundation.\n\n\nRegards\n\n[COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
