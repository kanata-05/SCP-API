Personnel are to avoid direct line of sight with SCP-1753 to minimize the risk of accidental exposure.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1753 is a 75\u00a0cm x 100\u00a0cm oil painting of the El Capitan rock formation in Yosemite National Park. The phrase \u201ctime to fly\u201d has been scrawled in permanent marker over the vertical rock face. Forensic analysis of SCP-1753 revealed that this phrase was incorporated by the painter.\n\n\nWhen a human capable of sight observes the painting and comprehends the written phrase they will activate SCP-1753\u2019s anomalous effects. Subjects initially experience a strong sense of vertigo that subsides within approximately thirty seconds. No further effects will be experienced for a period of twelve to fourteen hours.\n\n\nAfter this time period the subject begins to perceive any \u201cdrop\u201d (e.g. a curb, a stair, etc) as being a vertical cliff face of approximately 2,000\u00a0m in height. While this will initially only occur on a small percentage of drops encountered the effect progresses until any vertical displacement higher than 5\u00a0cm results in a sheer cliff face. Amnestics have proven ineffective at removing SCP-1753\u2019s influence.\n\n\nShould an affected individual jump from a perceived cliff they will hover in the air for approximately thirty seconds before impacting the ground with force comparable to that expected of striking the ground at terminal velocity. Subjects equipped with BASE jumping gear are able to make the descent unharmed. Of note is that SCP-1753\u2019s influence appears to be one-way: an affected subject standing at the top of a staircase will see a series of descending cliffs, while an affected subject at the bottom will see only a staircase.\n\n\nSCP-1753 was recovered in 19\u2588\u2588 after a woman in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, CA reported several minutes of laughter followed by the remains of Herbert \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (presumably the creator of SCP-1753) breaking through the ceiling. Foundation agents discovered SCP-1753 in an upstairs apartment with what appeared to be a suicide note (see Addendum 1753-001) painted on the wall of the bedroom.\n\n\nAddendum 1753-001:\n Suicide note of Herbert \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nthe sky's calling\n\ntime to fly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1752\n | SCP-1753 | \nSCP-1754\n \u00bb",
