Access to SCP-7513 is restricted to humans with Level 4 access or above.\n\n\nSite-13 is not to be used for any mission involving extraterrestrials. Staff at Site-13 are to be vetted for any extraterrestrial DNA, while staff working with SCP-7513 are to be intensely monitored for any sign of extraterrestrial influence via monthly check-ins and daily self-testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7513 is Forrest O\u2019Sullivan, a 25-year-old male of Irish-American descent.\n\n\nSCP-7513 has an anomalously high encounter rate with sapient extraterrestrial entities, with most reported encounters ending with zero casualties, and the species that said extraterrestrial entity originates from having an amicable relationship with humans from that point on.\n\n\nInteractions between extraterrestrials and SCP-7513 are almost always sexual, with entities offering SCP-7513 to partake in customary courting rituals or to engage in casual sexual activity. When encountering species that are asexual, or have no intention of copulating with SCP-7513, the actions and words of said entities are usually interpreted as flirtatious by SCP-7513.\n\n\nBefore containment, SCP-7513 was involved in 13% of incidents regarding Foundation encounters with extraterrestrial species in the past 20 years, the earliest of which being in 2003. Of these incidents that SCP-7513 was involved in, 51% of them have ended with a diplomatic relationship being established between the Foundation and said extraterrestrial species. The other 49% resulted in no further activity being reported from these extraterrestrial species.\n\n\nSCP-7513 was discovered on August 5th, 2021 during Incident 7513-1. SCP-7513 was one of the individuals interrogated for the incident, and upon the investigation of its Tinder account, it was discovered that 75% of all the accounts it had matched with were accounts flagged by Foundation webcrawlers as belonging to undercover extraterrestrials (henceforth referred to as UEs). An investigation into its other social media accounts revealed that:\n\n\n\n\n59% of all of SCP-7513\u2019s Twitter followers were accounts belonging to UEs.\n\n\n77% of Facebook groups that SCP-7513 had joined were being run entirely by UEs, sometimes with SCP-7513 being the only human in said groups.\n\n\n95% of SCP-7513\u2019s Instagram followers were accounts belonging to UEs, with 100% of comments found under posts made by SCP-7513 belonging to said accounts.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this investigation, as well as the discovery of his involvement in prior Foundation incidents, SCP-7513 was informed of its anomalous properties and willingly entered containment.\n\n\nAddendum 7513.1:\n Online profiles.\n\n\nThe following is a collection of profiles utilized by accounts belonging to SCP-7513.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Profile:\n\nForrest, 25, he/him, bisexual, BLM, trans ally. I will block you if you dm me about aliens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram Profile:\n\nForrest, 25, he/him, bisexual, BLM, trans ally. I hate aliens so much and if you even come CLOSE to me with that alien shit I won\u2019t hesitate to block you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTinder Profile:\n\nYo! My name\u2019s Forrest.

I\u2018m pursuing a degree in computer design at the University of Wisconsin.\n\n\nAlso, really important, if you\u2019re an alien, FUCK OFF!!!

See you there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7513 frequently conversed with POI-481, talking about plans and daily activities. The final conversation between SCP-7513 and POI-481 was sent on August 5th and can be found below.\n\n\n\n\ngeorgie \ud83d\udc95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall set and ready to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncan\u2019t wait to meet you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be in the back waiting for you my king!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nudbdbdbfhd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour king?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalright then\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation was investigating an unrelated string of anomalous disappearances when hume levels dropped significantly around the area of the Holden Club, equivalent to hume levels in the presence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n\nCommand approved for the operatives to set up around the Holden Club due to a rise in extraterrestrial deaths in Wisconsin, and three agents were stationed inside.\n\n\nDue to the hastiness of this operation, the agents were not properly prepared, and didn\u2019t have standard-issue lapel cameras on hand. Fortunately, SCP-7513 was recording the incident on its phone, the transcription can be read below.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n<Camera feed starts, it is a closeup of SCP-7513\u2019s face>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Okay, I\u2019m recording. I\u2019m making this for uhhh\u2026 evidence? Might get murdered tonight and I\u2019m kinda scared about that.\n\n\n<It sighs>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Listen, I like Georgie, but she seems, I don\u2019t know\u2026 too good to be true? I have a bad feeling about this.\n\n\n<It pauses, wiping its forehead of sweat>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s the only real person who contacted me after all of these ghostings and uh\u2026 people pretending to be aliens, yannow?\n\n\n<SCP-7513 takes multiple deep breaths in and out.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Alright\u2026 I\u2019m ready\u2026\n\n\n<SCP-7513 puts the camera in its pocket, covering the view partially>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n I\u2019m just gonna be cheesy about it, yeah? This is a fake flower that sprays water\u2026 yeah\u2026 yeah\u2026 I\u2019m just a funny guy, playing a lil joke, haha.\n\n\n<SCP-7513 exits its car and enters the Holden Club, immediately making its way over to the rear of the building>\n\n\n<Camera shakes as SCP-7513 approaches the back wall and walks nearby it, scanning the crowd for POI-481>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Georgie?\n\n\n<Redacted for brevity. The following five minutes consist of SCP-7513 searching for POI-481, and asking other people about POI-481\u2019s whereabouts.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n God damn, where i-\n\n\n???:\n I\u2019ve been waiting for ya, darlin~!\n\n\n<Camera shakes, a brief shot of a gigantic hornet (POI-481) bursting through the walls of the Holden Club is shown.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n HOLY SHIT!\n\n\n<Chaos erupts within the building, as many of the attendees, SCP-7513 included, attempt to flee the scene.>\n\n\n<SCP-7513 takes out its phone and holds it on POI-481 as it flies through the air. The embedded Foundation agents take out their firearms and fire at the entity. Several civilians take out weapons and attempt to take it down>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!\n\n\n<POI-481 flies at SCP-7513, picking it up and flying into the air. The footage is shaky footage of the club\u2019s wall.>\n\n\nPOI-481:\n Heya, Forrest~. Glad you could make it~!\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n GEORGIE!?\n\n\nPOI-481:\n Hiya, hun~!\n\n\n<POI-481 giggles>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Shit\u2026 fuck\u2026 fuck! FUCK!! PUT ME DOWN!!\n\n\nPOI-481:\n No can do, hun~. Got a queen that needs a king.\n\n\n<Audio is drowned out by a loud droning noise. This coincides with the arrival of an extraterrestrial spacecraft appearing over the venue.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n Fuck! FUCK!! HELP ME!!! SOMEONE HELP ME!!!\n\n\n<Multiple gunshots are heard, one piercing SCP-7513\u2019s skin on its leg.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n FUCK!!! PLEASE!!! SOMEONE!!! HELP! FUCKING HELP ME!!!

You\u2019ll be lovin\u2019 yer new life as a King, I tell ya!\n\n\n<SCP-7513\u2019s pleas turn into ineligible screams. The footage turns upwards, revealing the spaceship. The portal inside opens, showing a massive interior similar to that of a beehive. Various massive hornets similar to POI-481 are seen faintly inside the ship.>\n\n\nSCP-7513:\n NO!!! NO!!!! NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!!!\n\n\n<Footage blurs as SCP-7513 falls to the ground, letting go of its cell phone for a brief moment before grabbing it again. Field reports show that SCP-7513 utilized the fake flower on its shirt\u2019s ability to spray water to blind POI-481, before using its sharp edge to pry itself free from POI-481.>\n\n\n<SCP-7513 is caught by a civilian and quickly flees the scene. The footage ends abruptly>\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nPOI-481 entered the ship and disappeared with the rest of its species. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. No casualties were reported.
