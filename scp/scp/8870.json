The entity possesses the anomalous capability to generate large amounts of hydrochloric acid within a given subject\u2019s body via observation.\n\n\nFurther information about the entity is contained in the attached appendices.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX [8870-001] - History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFirst recorded activity of SCP-8870 was on 05/13/2024, when Mr. Karl Uzbekki, a known member of GoI-019 (\u201d\nThe Serpent\u2019s Hand\n\u201d),\n2\n heavily advocating for anti-Foundation and \nGlobal Occult Coalition\n3\n sentiments online. Uzbekki was found deceased in his apartment, due to acid exposure in internal organs.\n4\n Although residents reported no abnormal sounds or sightings, a security camera situated within Uzbekki\u2019s residence showed the presence of a hooded humanoid figure.\n\n\nThe second encounter of the entity was on 12/04/2024, when a church service of GoI-004 (\u201d\nChurch of the Broken God\n\u201d) ended in the deaths of six attendees. Surviving attendees reported the presence of a hooded figure in the back rows of the church.\n\n\nThe final sighting of SCP-8870, as of 01/10/2025, occurred on 01/03/2025, during the presidential election speech of Ms. Tori Fr\u00e0nk, culminating into Incident 8870-\u03b1.

Partly because all of the data is everywhere on the world-wide web, but mostly because a lot of innocent people\u2019s lives are getting tits-up, just because they work for this organization.\n\n\nThe truth of the matter is: The public hates us \u2014 \nhas been\n hating us ever since the glorious fuck-up over there in the East. And although that piece of the world did eventually come back, the millions of people on that piece did not. Everyone blamed us. Hell, some of the scientists and soldiers involved in the operation even blamed themselves. One to the heart, the other to the brain.\n\n\nWhat people always seem to forget is that, although it was a tragedy, there was a reason for that tragedy. We didn\u2019t just send North Korea up into another, inhospitable dimension without reason, but because it was our way of sparing billions more. As hard as it might be to believe this, we saved the world that day. We make the hard, downright unethical and cruel decisions, so that others don\u2019t have to. We always did.\n\n\nWhich brings us again to 8870. The acid person, if it is human at all. This entity has been specifically targeting pro-anomaly figures in the public, making an example out of them; we don\u2019t know why, given they are apparently anomalous themselves, but we do know to what purpose. It\u2019s to rile up the masses into hating the Foundation. Even more than before.\n\n\nEverywhere in the world, you see signs that say \u201dFUCK THE FOUNDATION\u201d or \u201dCONTAINMENT is NOT PROTECTION\u201d, or other similar stuff. On your way to work, on the radio, or some pop-up ad on your favorite porn site. They\u2019re everywhere. And that is a problem. Suddenly, one looney-bin conspiracy theorist turns into dozens of looney-bin conspiracy theorists. Then a hundred, then a thousand \u2014 and that\u2019s where the issues start to emerge.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the last thing the Foundation needs is animal rights activists arriving at Site-19\u2019s doors, advocating for the rights of \n682\n.\n\n\nBack to 8870, and the founding of the GREY MATTER Division. I propose the division to handle what the public cannot: Information. My team will sow any hateful regards toward the Foundation and feed the public new information that paints us as a necessary evil, like the sweet little free-thinkers they are.\n\n\nWe will make sure, 24/7, that the damage done by SCP-8870 will be repaired overnight. That no harm may stay. For the betterment of the world. For the greater good. For my sister and people like her out there.\n\n\nI hope you take these words to heart, Overseers.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n- Hakari Mimko\n\n\nSecure. Contain.

I didn\u2019t know\u2014\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \n(raises voice)\n \u2014And we all know what happened to her.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<An image of Tori Fr\u00e0nk\u2019s remains are shown, partially dissolving through the floor. Cavollo is seen turning away, muttering expletives in Spanish. Schneider remains in her position.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Her death shook the anomalous community. They didn\u2019t take kindly to their figure of hope being turned into a slurry paste. And with the identity of the \ntrue\n assailant unknown, they turned to us, as you might\u2019ve noticed with the increasing\u2026 \nhate\n at Foundation personnel.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Just this month I got three shoeboxes delivered to my adress with a dead rat in it. I\u2019d be utterly disgusted, if they weren\u2019t so unoriginal. \nHijos de puta!\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n If I may interrupt, Doctor\u2026\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Dr. Mimko.\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Dr. Mimko, why are you telling us all this?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<She puts another image onto the projector. The words \u201dGREY MATTER DIVISION\u201d are superimposed over a grey brain in black bold letters.>\n\n\n<The other members look at the image extensively.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n The GREY MATTER Division. \n(paces around table)\n Our job will be to produce media that\u2019s exclusively pro-Foundation. From memes to videos, movies, TV shows, games, books, pornography \u2014 anything for the public to love us again.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Cavollo raises a hand.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Why are we doing all of this? I mean, hasn\u2019t the Foundation operated without the public\u2019s knowledge longer than my grammie\u2019s been suckling the air out of this Earth? Why is it so concerned about the public now?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Mimko approaches Cavollo.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Because the next \npeople-elected\n president might not be so lenient with the Foundation. Higher taxes would be the least we had to worry about then. And, trust me, we do not want to go down \nthat path\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence. Dr. Mimko walks back toward the head of the table.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n \n(mutters)\n So this is how the Foundation dies\u2026 with rageful X-users.\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Okay, I do \nnot\n want another \nStar Wars\n reference in this room.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n I\u2019m sorry! It seemed appropriate!\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n What made you think it was appropriate?\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Look, I said I\u2019m sorry!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Mimko gives out a long exhale, rubbing her temple.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n So, we know what our jobs are, but why are we \nspecifically\n here?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \nYour\n job is to keep in touch with the current generation. Come up with a flurry of ideas to keep their young minds stimulated for longer than 10 seconds. While you \n(points at Cavollo)\n will be producing this stuff. Send it right into the masses.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Okay. Great. Where\u2019s my team?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \n(pauses)\n You\u2019re looking right at it.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n \n(pauses)\n Where?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n We\u2019re a quartett\u2014 well, trio, as of right now.\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Wait\u2014\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Chair scrapes against the floor. Dr. Schneider walks up to Dr. Mimko.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n We\u2019re all that there is?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Short one member, but, yes.\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n \n(scoffs)\n I\u2019m done. I\u2019m \ndone\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Schneider moves to the door.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Dr. Schneider\u2014\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Agent Henrik Duvall enters the room. He looks around quietly, before settling on an empty seat. He watches the proceedings with mild disinterest.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n \u2014you were hand-picked for this project, due to your expertise and skill.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Schneider stops in her tracks. Agent Duvall checks his phone.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Picked by whom?\n\n\nO5-11:\n \n(via intercom)\n By me.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Jesus!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Concerned faces, except for Dr. Mimko. Even Agent Duvall is looking up from his phone.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO5-11:\n Golly. This first meeting\u2019s going great!\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Who are you?\n\n\nO5-11:\n Oh, you know, just that voice in your heads to tell you to shut the fuck up and listen to your team leader for a second, that\u2019s all.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Are you a Director?\n\n\nO5-11:\n More than that. I\u2019m an Overseer. And now that I\u2019ve told y\u2019all, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to terminate you all\u2014\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Concerned faces.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO5-11:\n \u2014but I\u2019ve heard the Foundation doesn\u2019t like to do that anymore, so I\u2019ll just ask you kindly to bash your brains in to forget we ever had this conversation!\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n Lord, help me\u2026\n\n\nO5-11:\n Daddy upstairs didn\u2019t come down when his son was put on a stick. I doubt he\u2019ll come for you, my love.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n If I may interject. O5-11, as his title might suggest, will oversee our operations. This entire operation isn\u2019t strictly\u2026 official.\n\n\nCAVOLLO & SCHNEIDER:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nO5-11:\n Jinxed!\n\n\nMIMKO:\n I proposed the project to the Council, which they denied. But O5-11 kindly offered me to go through with it anyway.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Why?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Clas\u2014\n\n\nO5-11:\n Classified, motherfucker!\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \u2026 yes.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Now what?\n\n\nO5-11:\n Now, you do your pretty little jobs, and save the world, or whatever. Miss Mimko over here said that my ol\u2019 partners, the GOC, got something to do with it.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Would fit their MO.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The intercom system disconnects.>\n\n\n<Dr. Schneider is about to leave.

There is no other option. Please.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Schneider hesitates for a moment.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n You\u2019re pathetic.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Schneider returns to her seat at the conference table.

The following is a log of the operation, Agent Henrik Duvall attending, with Dr. Hakari Mimko overseeing via concealed body-camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<Agent Duvall arrives at the location. It is that of an elementary school, completely empty. There is a black van with the words \u201dFLOWER SHOP\u201d printed on the side.>\n\n\n<Duvall takes a look around, before exiting the vehicle. A light breeze passes him by.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n This place?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \n(through earpiece)\n What of it?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n No, it\u2019s just\u2026 and the van? Even the UIU would be more conspicuous.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Just go in, agent.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Duvall approaches the front entrance. Various small carton figures of Santa Claus are attached to the interior of the glass pane with duct-tape.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Open the door.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Duvall pulls on the doors, which do not budge. He pushes them and the doors move open.>\n\n\n<He walks through the hallways of the school building. Each room that he passes the door is closed shut. He passes one whose door is wide open; a man sits at a desk with a black briefcase laying to his side.>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<Duvall eyes the man and the room, before carefully entering.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n Ah, yes, Mr. Duvall. Please, take a seat.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The man gestures to the chair opposite him. Duvall takes a seat, shifting on it slightly.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n You are Mr. Duvall, yes?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n I am. Who are you?\n\n\nMAN:\n Oh, apologies. I am D.C. al Fine\u2019s representative. She unfortunately couldn\u2019t come personally.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n What, too busy?\n\n\nMAN:\n No, no. It\u2019s just with the recent, well, controversy surrounding the Foundation, she wanted to be safe. I hope you take no offense in this.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n \u2026 No.\n\n\nMAN:\n Very well. Let us waste no more time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Agent Duvall takes a look around. The room is an ordinary classroom, with boards, desks, chairs and images of the students and their birthdays pinned to the walls.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n You have come alone, yes?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n \n(gestures at himself)\n As alone as one can be.\n\n\nMAN:\n You know I can smell that body-camera on you.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Duvall\u2019s demeanor changes and he remains silent. He shifts in his seat.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n Yeah?\n\n\nMAN:\n Your colleague is watching me right now.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n You born that way?\n\n\nMAN:\n Got exposed to a \nparasite\n during an operation in Germany. My abilities have proven quite useful.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n I thought the Coalition didn\u2019t like anomalies.\n\n\nMAN:\n Maybe, Mr. Duvall, we are not the mindless killers certain people paint us out to be.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n Well, Mr. Duvall, and whoever else is watching, let\u2019s not stray too far from the topic at hand. We both know why this meeting was called, after all.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n Did you kill her? Tori Fr\u00e0nk?\n\n\nMAN:\n No.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n And I\u2019m supposed to believe that?\n\n\nMAN:\n Quite frankly, there is no way for you to know the truth, other than what I have to say.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n That\u2019d be putting a lot of trust into a person I barely know.\n\n\nMAN:\n If I may, Mr. Duvall\u2014\n\n\nDUVALL:\n You may.\n\n\nMAN:\n \u2014I was under the impression that this meeting was to determine whether the Coalition had a hand in the event or not. And I have quickly and truthfully answered your questions. Now, if you\u2019d excuse me.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The man stands up from his seat, taking the briefcase with him. The chair makes a scraping noise as he stands up.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n No\u2026 wait!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The man walks past Agent Duvall. He grabs the man by the wrist. He looks down at Duvall.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n Please\u2026 I, I have a son.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The man\u2019s expression changes. Duvall loosens his grip.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Duvall\u2026\n\n\nDUVALL:\n His name is Michal. He\u2019s nine years old. I have tried my best giving that boy the normalest of lives possible. To make him know that he is \nnot\n different from anybody else.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The man moves back to his seat and sits down. He listens intently at Duvall.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n Last week, UIU agents showed up at my front door. Practically barged right in there\u2026 and two days ago, my wife watched as someone followed her from her workplace all the way home; today was the same. If they\u2019re willing to do that, what would these people do to my son?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n The day the agent came, Michal was scared shitless. He couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t\u2014 And I don\u2019t want that to happen again. I want them to leave my son alone. Fuck me, I don\u2019t want my son growing up feeling that he\u2019s different, just because his daddy works at a shadow organization. I\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n<The man sighs. He puts the briefcase on the desk and clasps it open. Inside is a flashdrive in velvet cushioning. He retrieves the flashdrive and offers it to Duvall, who hesitantly takes it.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n That drive contains footage of the path the assailant took after the assassination, captured by CCTV in the area. My people are already on it, but a few more cooks in the kitchen never hurt anybody.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Agent Duvall is left speechless. The man clasps his briefcase shut again and gets up to leave.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAN:\n I may have not been totally honest, Mr. Duvall. I hope you forgive me.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Duvall is still speechless. The man nods at him and exits the area.>\n\n\n<After some time, Agent Duvall\u2019s earpiece cackles to life again.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Duvall, you reading me?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n \u2026 yes. Yes. \n(clears throat)\n I read you, Dr. Mimko.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n The mission\u2019s done. Good job, Henrik.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Agent Duvall looks out the window. He spots the black van from earlier, which is observed to exit the empty parking lot, pass by the window, before passing out of view.>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[END RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n I analyzed the footage contained on the flashdrive.

MTF Pi-1 was designated as the escort under Dr. Mimko\u2019s orders.\n\n\nUnder Council ruling, Agent Duvall was authorized to carry a highly experimental weapon, in order to minimize potential casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<Interior is that of a medium-sized room, with an elevated stage in the front and a seating area for the audience. Two chairs and a desk are on the stage, with big screens behind them.>\n\n\n<Several are in attendance, including MTF Pi-1 lead Agent Henrik Duvall, who sits in the back row. He carefully oversees the front rows.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n \n(through earpiece)\n Anything suspicious yet?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n Nope.

Murmurs of the audience quiet down.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDUVALL:\n Tell me again, why didn\u2019t we cancel the event, if we suspect 8870 to be here?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n This is our best chance capturing the entity. Or do you\u2019ve got a plan of their schedule?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n Whatever you say, boss.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<From the right side of the stage,\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n,\n8\n henceforth referred to as \u2019reporter\u2019, enters.>\n\n\n<The audience erupts in applause.

Whose very organization\u2019s been under a lot of shade, as of late. I welcome to the stage, Mr. Abu Ugondo!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Abu Ugondo enters from the left side of the stage.

It\u2019s just so good to have you here, Mr. Ugondo.\n\n\nUGONDO:\n Believe me, Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The pleasure\u2019s all mine.\n\n\nREPORTER:\n Well, Mr. Ugondo, I assume you\u2019ve heard about the recent controversy surrounding the Foundation\u2026\n\n\nUGONDO:\n I have, yes.\n\n\nREPORTER:\n \u2026 And a lot of people still have mixed feelings about that. So why don\u2019t I let you start? \n(gestures with hands)\n\n\nUGONDO:\n Thank you very much. I\u2019d like to start by saying that the SCP Foundation is, regardless of people\u2019s opinions or views, a necessary organization. We contain thousands of anomalies, which could wipe out an entire country clean if not left in check. So I wanted to start by saying that.\n\n\nUGONDO:\n Regarding the death of Tori Fr\u00e0nk, the O5-Council is deeply sorry for her family, friends and colleagues. And of course what she meant to a lot of people \u2014 \npeople\n \u2014 out there in the world. The Foundation does not take kindly to senseless violen\u2014\n\n\nDUVALL:\n Do I really gotta sit through this man saying empty platitudes?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Concentrate on the mission, Henrik.\n\n\nDUVALL:\n \n(sighs)\n Aye, aye.\n\n\nUGONDO:\n \u2014like to show that her death was not in vain, the Foundation has partnered up together with the Manna Charitable Foundation and Marshall, Carter & Dark to support oppressed anomalous communities in third world countries worldwide! This initiative aims a-\n\n\nREPORTER:\n Wait, wait\u2014 Sorry to interrupt\u2014\n\n\nUGONDO:\n Yes?\n\n\nREPORTER:\n \u2014you\u2019ve partnered up with \nMarshall, Carter & Dark\n, the same organization known to traffick human anomalies?\n\n\nUGONDO:\n Well, it\u2019s not that simple. What MC&D did in 2023 is inexcusable. But with their involvement with this initiative, they can help millions of people in the world.\n\n\nREPORTER:\n And you \u2014 \nthe SCP Foundation\n \u2014 genuinely think that this makes up for what happened?\n\n\nUGONDO:\n We\u2014\n\n\nREPORTER:\n Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think this initiative of yours is a cute attempt. But it doesn\u2019t tackle the greatest problem: Anomalies around the world are still being oppressed. The Foundation is applying a band-aid to a gunshot wound; it\u2019s simply ineffective.\n\n\nUGONDO:\n The Foundation is trying its best\u2014\n\n\nREPORTER:\n Oh, really? Millions of people\u2019d say otherwise\u2014\n\n\nUGONDO:\n \u2014to help those in need. Shoot, we have been for over a hundred years-\n\n\nREPORTER:\n \u2014and that isn\u2019t even mentioning the other scandals: \n6113\n, \nthe S\u2019kakithi\n, \n110-Montauk\n, \nBush v.

Several attendees begin to shout various expletives and making obscene gestures at Dr. Ugondo.>\n\n\n<Agent Duvall keeps a vigilant eye at the proceedings.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n Anything now?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n It\u2019s like trying to find a needle in a haystack, only the haystack\u2019s on fire and the needle microscopic.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n So?\n\n\nDUVALL:\n Nothing right now.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The arguement comes to an end when members of MTF Pi-1 walk onto the stage and deter Dr. Ugondo away. The reporter and audience look on, as Dr. Ugondo is being slowly motioned away.>\n\n\n<Before coming upon the exit, a figure in the middle rows stands up, maintaining intense eye contact with Dr. Ugondo.>\n\n\n<Agent Duvall notices, pulls out his OKU-061 firearm,\n9\n and utilizes it to incapacitate the figure.>\n\n\n<SCP-8870 slumps down on its seat, which no one else pays any attention to.>\n\n\n<Dr. Ugondo is safely escorted out of the area.

If it isn\u2019t the man himself. You\u2019ve put a lot of people in a lot of danger with your antics.

Endless spirales of thoughts and memories.\n\n\nAs if on instinct, your hand shoots up to the terminal\u2019s console, and you type in commands as quickly and as quietly as you can.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| > CONTACT: O5-1\n\n| Contacting O5-1\u2026\n\n| STATUS: \nUnavailable\n.\n\n| > CONTACT: O5-2\n\n| Contacting O5-2\u2026\n\n| STATUS: \nUnavailable\n.\n\n| > CONTACT: O5-3\n\n| Contacting O5-3\u2026\n\n| STATUS: \nUnavailable\n.\n\n| > CONTACT: O5-13\n\n| Contacting O5-13\u2026\n\n| Contact established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe termimal cackles to life. \nThank God,\n you think, exhaling loudly. A feminine voice comes through from the other end.\n\n\u201d\nClef\n?\u201d Sophia asks. \nSophia Light\n.\n\n\nYou part your lips, a slight wheeze escaping your mouth. You settle on something to say, something that summed up the situation in the most concise and least overwhelming way possible. It was just like mixing water with oil.\n\n\nBut you can\u2019t. At first you don\u2019t know why, but then you become aware of an awful, stinging feeling right in the middle of your chest. You clutch it tightly, gasping for air, as your knees painfully fail you.\n\n\n\u201dClef, you there?\u201d Sophia\u2019s voice rings out yet again. She still received no answer.\n\n\nThat sting in your chest turns into a burning feeling. Droplets of red stain the floor, pooling around you in an almost mesmerizing, artistic pattern. Pieces of your clothes swim in the pool.\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t a chemist, but no one needed expert-levels of expertise to know that acid was eating through your body. You gather all the strength you\u2019ve got left for one last time, do something, anything. Your head is above the meter tall terminal now.\n\n\nAnd you collapse again. Your head impacts the console.\n\n\nThe last thing that you see on the flickering screen is the face of Dr. Hakari Mimko, completely silent and near motionless, who is looking up at the security camera, as if looking back at you. Staring straight into your soul.\n\n\nAnd then it ends.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| NOTICE: You have been inactive for FIVE (5) MINUTES.\n\n| TERMINAL LOCKOUT will be initiated upon further inactivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| NOTICE: You have been inactive for THIRTY (30) MINUTES.\n\n| TERMINAL LOCKOUT will be initiated upon further inactivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| NOTICE: You have been inactive for ONE (1) HOUR.\n\n| TERMINAL LOCKOUT will be initiated upon further inactivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| NOTICE: You have been inactive for TWO (2) HOURS.\n\n| TERMINAL LOCKOUT will be initiated upon further inactivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| INITIATING TERMINAL LOCKOUT\u2026\n\n| LOGGING OUT: O5-11.\n\n| LOG-OUT SUCCESSFUL.\n\n\n| \nGoodbye, Overseer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "PROJECT PROPOSAL DATE: 01/16/2025 CODENAME: \u201dGREY MATTER\u201d PROPOSED BY: Dr. Hakari Mimko I could sugarcoat this, but I\u2019m not going to. Partly because all of the data is everywhere on the world-wide web, but mostly because a lot of innocent people\u2019s lives are getting tits-up, just because they work for this organization. The truth of the matter is: The public hates us \u2014 has been hating us ever since the glorious fuck-up over there in the East. And although that piece of the world did eventually come back, the millions of people on that piece did not. Everyone blamed us. Hell, some of the scientists and soldiers involved in the operation even blamed themselves. One to the heart, the other to the brain. What people always seem to forget is that, although it was a tragedy, there was a reason for that tragedy. We didn\u2019t just send North Korea up into another, inhospitable dimension without reason, but because it was our way of sparing billions more. As hard as it might be to believe this, we saved the world that day. We make the hard, downright unethical and cruel decisions, so that others don\u2019t have to. We always did. Which brings us again to 8870. The acid person, if it is human at all. This entity has been specifically targeting pro-anomaly figures in the public, making an example out of them; we don\u2019t know why, given they are apparently anomalous themselves, but we do know to what purpose. It\u2019s to rile up the masses into hating the Foundation. Even more than before. Everywhere in the world, you see signs that say \u201dFUCK THE FOUNDATION\u201d or \u201dCONTAINMENT is NOT PROTECTION\u201d, or other similar stuff. On your way to work, on the radio, or some pop-up ad on your favorite porn site. They\u2019re everywhere. And that is a problem. Suddenly, one looney-bin conspiracy theorist turns into dozens of looney-bin conspiracy theorists. Then a hundred, then a thousand \u2014 and that\u2019s where the issues start to emerge. It goes without saying that the last thing the Foundation needs is animal rights activists arriving at Site-19\u2019s doors, advocating for the rights of 682 . Back to 8870, and the founding of the GREY MATTER Division. I propose the division to handle what the public cannot: Information. My team will sow any hateful regards toward the Foundation and feed the public new information that paints us as a necessary evil, like the sweet little free-thinkers they are. We will make sure, 24/7, that the damage done by SCP-8870 will be repaired overnight. That no harm may stay. For the betterment of the world. For the greater good. For my sister and people like her out there. I hope you take these words to heart, Overseers. - Hakari Mimko Secure. Contain. Protect. COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY YES NAY ABSTAIN O5-1 O5-2 O5-3 O5-4 O5-5 O5-6 O5-7 O5-8 O5-9 O5-10 O5-11 O5-12 O5-13 STATUS DENIED CONCLUSION: By vote of the Overseer Council, the founding of the GREY MATTER Division has been DENIED . The project is deemed a waste of valuable resources and personnel, which could be allocated to more worth-while projects. You may remain lead researcher of SCP-8870, but do not come forward with this proposal again, Dr. Mimko. - O5-1",
