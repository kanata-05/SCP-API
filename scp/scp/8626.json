Oneiric Image Capture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n Allegedly, SCP-8626 is a broadcast of pre-recorded friendly tennis matches between two unidentified persons\n2\n in the Centre Court of Wimbledon stadium. While generally adhering to the standard procedure for such an event, SCP-8626 deviates in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nThere is no ball;\n\n\nThere is no chair umpire;\n\n\nThe audience consists entirely of children, who watch in silence.\n\n\n\n\nIn every account, the game will progress to a tiebreaker with the players in deadlock, producing increasingly guttural, hoarse, or shrieking noises of exertion as they strike at an unseen ball.\n3\n This continues until one of the figures collapses from apparent exhaustion, after which the display will fade to static. A new broadcast will begin anywhere from 1 hour to 1 week later.\n4\n\n\nSubjects who view SCP-8626 will experience prolonged and intrusive auditory hallucinations of the broadcast regardless of physical proximity. Attempts to dampen the noise with hands, headphones, pillows, or other external implements will fail. These effects persist indefinitely, but can diminish over time.\n5\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Ages 3-12\n\n\n2\n. Often the distinction of 1 male and 1 female figure is made.\n\n\n3\n. It is unclear how the players know when a point is scored.\n\n\n4\n. In most cases, it is only heard.\n\n\n5\n.
