This is believed to be SCP-5257's origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5257\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Information relating to larger groups exposing SCP-5257's effects will be handled by Marshall, Carter & Dark's own misinformation campaigns. Given the embarrassment caused by this anomaly becoming publicly known, it is believed that Marshall, Carter & Dark can be trusted to contain all information relating to the anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-5257's effects are explainable on an individual basis through mundane means and do not require additional containment measures.\n\n\nMarshall, Carter & Dark thaumaturges are currently working on a cure for SCP-5257. The organization has agreed to inform the Foundation when that project is completed so this object can be reclassified as an inactive anomaly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5257 is a viral thaumaturgical effect that causes individuals to defecate when they experience severe anxiety relating to expected harm. SCP-5257 related defecation will occur regardless of the contents of an individuals bowels. The source of the fecal matter that is produced via this effect is currently unknown, but does match the DNA of the producing individual.\n\n\nSCP-5257 appears to only affect individuals employed by Marshall, Carter & Dark, and spreads through physical contact. Given that the effect is only triggered during periods of extreme stress relating to threats of physical harm, it is currently unknown how many agents of Marshall, Carter & Dark are under the effects of this anomaly.\n\n\nThe anomaly was first discovered following a joint Foundation, GOC, and MC&D assault on a Chaos Insurgency safe house in 2021\n1\n. Several agents from all involved organizations were injured.\n\n\nDuring medical treatment immediately following the firefight, mercenaries employed by Marshall, Carter & Dark were found to be wearing adult diapers that were soiled. At first this was not understood as an anomaly, but eventually information relating to the anomaly was relayed to Foundation medical staff in order to provide better care.\n\n\nAfter SCP-5257 was properly designated and risks relating to its spread were identified, the SCP Foundation began a project to identify as much information as possible about how and why SCP-5257 was created. A collection of extant documents was searched and new documents were sought and recovered.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Initial\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nLana Fuentes\n\n\nDate\n\n\nMarch 2nd, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nAnti-Mugging Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI noticed that several of our customers have complained about fear relating to robberies that are occurring in New York City as of late. I don't know for certain how credible this fear is, but I think we can possibly exploit this fear for a new product.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of potential solutions but I'm going to leave most of the details up to R&D. They seem somewhat excited about the possibilities, and I know for a fact that you can't replicate passion for a project. Gonna put Mr. Sterling in as project lead. He seemed to be extremely eager to get started.\n\n\n\nCorporate has been on my case for months about micromanaging my teams so I'm gonna step back and see how he performs.

Invulnerability and super strength actually increases the casualty numbers. Certainly for the robber, but turns out if you give an untrained person super strength they don't act fast enough to avoid death for their companions. And that's the real issue. If we make the customer able to fight back, the death of walking partners and even innocent bystanders goes up by over 174%.\n\n\n\nOne guy was even still overpowered by two guys. He came out of it unharmed because he was temporarily invulnerable, but he was still beaten and robbed. It also hurt quite a bit, I'm told.\n\n\n\nMuggings don't happen nearly as often as I was led to believe in New York. We provoked each of the test robberies through a variety of incentives and hexes. I wanted to make sure these were real world circumstances, so I worry that the data is flawed due to the use of magic. I'm gonna dig a little deeper on how the spells work before I give up on the methods though.\n\n\n\nWe had one fairly promising outlier. One of our researchers was robbed independent of the tests and he shit himself. The robber was so overcome by the smell (and weirdness, I suspect) that he left the scene without further incident. I am going to order some tests in this area and see how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Opened Under:\n\n\nGGOU3/N5IHM/TTAB3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarshall, Carter & Dark, LLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Report 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nAdam Sterling\n\n\nDate\n\n\nMarch 15th, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nAnti-Mugging Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweaking this spell has been fun. A line change here, a slightly different intonation there and it works just differently enough for me to test it for additional efficacy.\n\n\n\nIn fact there was an error in our transcription during the last test and the defecation occurred even though the user didn't have anything in his digestive tract. I'm used to coding but honestly I've been learning a lot about how similar those two fields really are. I'm gonna keep the bugged spell and I think it might be our final version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Opened Under:\n\n\nGGOU3/N5IHM/TTAB3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarshall, Carter & Dark, LLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Report 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nAdam Sterling\n\n\nDate\n\n\nMarch 17th, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nAnti-Mugging Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've run over a hundred tests.

I actually did consider that, that's why I wanted as much data as possible to back up the product.\n\n\nLana Fuentes:\n Your data doesn't change the fact that we cant sell this to anyone.\n\n\nAdam Sterling:\n Ok. Yeah no, I get that now. I just thought maybe I could change your minds.\n\n\nLana Fuentes:\n So you knew this would be a problem and you spent 45 million dollars to test a spell that makes you shit yourself?\n\n\nAdam Sterling:\n Yes Ma'am.\n\n\nHr'asm'Kal:\n I KNOW IT'S HARD TO INTERPRET MY TONE BECAUSE MY VOICE IS BEAMED DIRECTLY INTO YOUR HEAD AT HIGH VOLUME BUT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU PERSONALLY.

Keep your work here\u2026\n\n\nAdam Sterling:\n Lana. I'm sorry, this won't happen again.\n\n\nLana Fuentes:\n \u2026your work here confidential or you forfeit your eternal soul.

Your security guy wasn't able to recognize my spell foci, so I went ahead and took the finished spell home with me.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't hard to tweak it. My background is in coding but the bug we had earlier taught me that spells just use wands and portals instead of ones and zeroes. Tell Tim I'm sorry I had to use him as a vector, but honestly he was going to shit himself in those circumstances anyway. And I knew his morning routine before work pretty well.\n\n\n\nTurns out another organization appreciates me a lot more than you ever did. I'm only sorry I don't get to see your face when you shit yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarshall, Carter & Dark, LLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Adam Sterling was among the injured agents taken prisoner during the 2021 assault on the Chaos Insurgency safe house.
