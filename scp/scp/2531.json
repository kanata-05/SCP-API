Field agents encountering SCP-2531 are to exercise caution to ensure the vine/stem/umbilical connection is not severed or damaged. Once secure, efforts are to be made to bring SCP-2531 to term allowing indefinite containment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2531 is a 70\u00a0kg (150 lbs) humanoid figure of indeterminable sex and pallid complexion, usually found in a state of advanced decay. In each occurrence, SCP-2531 has been discovered sealed within \nCucurbita maxima\n (commonly known as giant squash or giant pumpkin). SCP-2531\u2019s height has been found to vary depending on the volume of the pumpkin\u2019s interior. DNA samples taken from SCP-2531 have confirmed that the humanoid figure, although usually severely decomposed, deformed, and contorted, shares 91.4% DNA match to that of \nHomo sapiens sapiens\n and 7.2% match to that of \nHomo neanderthalensis\n. SCP-2531 is found connected to the interior wall of a giant pumpkin via an umbilical cord composed of both plant and animal matter. The cord runs from the inside of the pumpkin\u2019s stem to the base of SCP-2531\u2019s skull. SCP-2531 does not exhibit an abdominal navel. After the vine/stem/umbilical is severed or severely damaged, SCP-2531 begins to decompose at an exponential rate until only organic dust remains. After an unknown amount of time, SCP-2531 is rediscovered within a new pumpkin. Despite efforts by the Foundation and non-Foundation to preserve SCP-2531, to date no attempts at containment have proven effective.\n\n\nThe decomposition and recurrence of SCP-2531 is currently under investigation. Each pumpkin wherein SCP-2531 was discovered weighed between 340\u00a0kg (750 lbs) and 370\u00a0kg (816 lbs). Any evidence of an SCP-2531 recurrence should be investigated immediately. Local operatives have clearance to utilize Foundation infrared/ultrasound/and satellite surveillance equipment for the apprehension of SCP-2531.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a01984\u00a0Newspaper\u00a0Article\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Newspaper\u00a0Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMPKIN MAN WINS BLUE RIBBON\n\n\nBody Found Inside Massive Pumpkin Has Authorities Baffled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nADN Staff Writer\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, September 7, fairgoers grew concerned about a noxious smell around the produce tent at the Alaska State Fairgrounds. By Sunday, the smell was so pungent that fair security were called in to investigate. \u201cIt smelled like rotting meat. At first I thought it had to be a joke; a prank or something,\u201d says \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u201cI\u2019m still having a tough time wrapping my head around this one.\u201d It turns out the strange smell was originating from this year\u2019s winner of the giant pumpkin contest.\n\n\nAfter a brief dispute with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the farmer who registered the pumpkin, fair security proceeded to cut a small aperture into the squash. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that nobody was ready to find what we found.\u201d (\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588). Staring back at security personnel and fairgoers was a human face. The pumpkin and body were immediately taken to the Alaska State Medical Examiner's Office for further investigation while \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was taken into custody by Palmer Police for questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was just as shocked as everyone else,\u201d says \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u201cbut I knew right away that it was the Pumpkin Man.\u201d It turns out \u201cPumpkin Man\u201d is somewhat of a rural legend in the Mat-Su Valley. \u201cYou hear about him wailing in the field, but you just kind of think it\u2019s like a kid\u2019s story or something. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 always swore up and down that he had Pumpkin Man once. All I know is that you\u2019re supposed to leave those ones alone.\u201d\n\n\nAn autopsy report released yesterday brought more perplexing information to the public. \u201cI don\u2019t know which is stranger,\u201d says Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the ASMEO, \u201cthe fact that the pumpkin showed absolutely no signs of tampering, or that the pumpkin showed absolutely no signs of tampering.\u201d Authorities determined that the body had been dead for well over a week, and no foul play is suspected.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to stick around in the pumpkin business,\u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 stated after a nervous laugh. Who\u2019s to say we can blame him?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Subsequent\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0Interview\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted at the University of Alaska, Anchorage\u2019s \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Building, Room \u2588\u2588, on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1984 (one week after the publication of the \u201cPumpkin Man Wins Blue Ribbon\u201d article in the Anchorage Daily News).\n\n\n<Begin Log \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1984\u00a016:32:40 AKDT>\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hello, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Thank you for coming in.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No problem, and please call me \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I imagine this is all about the Pumpkin Man.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n As a matter of fact it is. Please let me cut right to the chase.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n By all means.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n In the Anchorage Daily News article, you mentioned that you had some familiarity with the local legend of the Pumpkin Man. Can you please elaborate?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So it\u2019s campfire stories you're after? Sure. Sure. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve heard.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I don\u2019t know when the stories started, but I remember people talking about the Pumpkin Man when I was a little boy. Used to scare us a bit. Sometimes, we\u2019d even joke around about it, you know. \u2018Hey, mom, this pie tastes a little funny. You cook up the Pumpkin Man?\u2019 We\u2019d laugh, but, you know, inside we were always a little scared, like if you said his name too many times, he\u2019d come around or something. It\u2019s like them damn angels. Everybody always talks about how sweet and helpful and how when their farm dog dies, he\u2019s coming back as a guardian angel, or some such. It\u2019s all horse shit. Read the damn Bible. If you ever saw an angel in real life, you\u2019d more likely shit your pants than dance. Scary as hell. Pumpkin Man was like that.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yes, but can you recall any specifics regarding the Pumpkin Man?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Sorry. I\u2019m getting on. Didn\u2019t used to meander so much.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That\u2019s fine. This is all very interesting.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yeah, so, Pumpkin Man comes around every few years. Some people think him showing up is a blessing. You know, next year will be a record harvest or something like that. But some folks think it\u2019s a pall, you know. You screwed up, and now Pumpkin Man is coming to let you know to turn around quick.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So how\u2019s business?\n\n\n[Both Laughing]\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Damn fine. You sciencey folks are great for the pocket book. But I\u2019m not so sure I want all this attention. Good note to go out on, I guess.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So your reluctance to continue farming was sincere?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n It\u2019s like if you\u2019ve gone fishing all your life, but one day you drag up a fish with a kid\u2019s finger sticking out the mouth. Every fish you pull up after that is sort of ruined. It\u2019s like that now. Might fade, but I doubt it. Before, Pumpkin Man was sort of abstract. I imagined him like a cartoon character when I was a kid. Big jack-o-lantern for a head. Seeing what was inside that pumpkin. Well. Some things you can\u2019t ever unsee. Know what I mean?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n More than you know.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You know, I\u2019d say \u2018I doubt that, young lady.\u2019 But\u2026 I believe you. So, yeah. You just sort of quietly hope to God that no Pumpkin Man shows up. I\u2019ve heard of folks cutting open pumpkins and finding a bunch of slime inside\u2026 like rotten yogurt or custard or something.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Adipocere.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Adipocere. Fat-wax. It\u2019s a cheesy, grayish-white mass produced when the body's proteins convert to fat.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Wow. Well isn\u2019t that pleasant. Yeah. Weird stuff. It\u2019s not the usual rot you see in a pumpkin. They always say \u2018that\u2019s him!\u2019 But I was never sure. Like I said in the article, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 promised on his mother\u2019s grave that he opened one up and saw Pumpkin Man. He was so damn scared that he loaded it on his pickup and threw it in the river. He was never the brightest.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We\u2019ve asked Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for an interview, but he has yet to get back to us. Again, thank you for your cooperation.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No problem. Yeah. I made a big mistake saying his name to the papers. He\u2019ll probably never have us over for dinner again. Funny how what I did validated his claims, but now everybody thinks he\u2019s crazier than ever. I really regret dragging him into it. Shooting off my big mouth.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Are there any stories of the Pumpkin Man outside the pumpkin, or is he always locked away?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh sure. Those are the worst ones. They say when he\u2019s about to come out, he wails something fierce. Screaming like a banshee. Anybody with a lick of sense gets the hell out of the field. Of course in the stories, it always happens at night, and more often than not, there\u2019s a big old lightning storm, even though lightning is about as common as Russians around here. Those stories are the worst, because he\u2019s always stalking around in the mist, watching. I think that\u2019s almost worse than coming up and eating bad little boys and girls. I mean, what the hell is he doing? What does he want? Where did he come from? If he ate us up, we could at least figure he was a devil or something. If he helped us out, maybe he\u2019d be like Frankenstein's monster or something. You know, kind of benevolent but confused. But he just lingers and watches. Why?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Do you know anyone who has seen him? Outside of the pumpkin, I mean. Out in the fields?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Most of the stories have him out in the woods, staying on the fringe, you know. Out in the mist. I don\u2019t know of anybody by name. Friend of a friend type thing. But I can ask around at the local watering hole. I\u2019d better use this fame while I\u2019ve got it. Think I could write a book?\n\n\n[Both Laughing]\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n In the article, you mentioned that\u2026 just a second. \u2018All I know is that you\u2019re supposed to leave those ones alone.\u2019 What did you mean by that?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You know, I\u2019ve asked myself that same question. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember if I heard that from somebody, or if it\u2019s just a feeling. You know, we have some of the puzzle pieces, and sometimes I think I can see the bigger picture. Pretty presumptuous, I know. I think he doesn\u2019t want to be seen. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll be ashamed or angry. Either way, I\u2019d rather let him slink around in the woods unseen than have him upset or ashamed. Ignorance is bliss, and in this case, I\u2019m just fine sticking my head in the sand.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you so much Mr. \u2588\u2026 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Is there anything else you can tell us?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Nothing that someone else couldn\u2019t tell you better, I\u2019m afraid.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Well, again, thank you. Your information is invaluable. If you can think of anything else, please don\u2019t hesitate to call.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thanks. It\u2019s not everyday I get the number of a beautiful young woman.

I was going to go visit the kids down in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588 was going to look after the place while I was gone. I was going to be out during harvest season, but there wasn\u2019t much to harvest back in 19\u2588\u2588, so I wasn\u2019t losing any sleep over it. I\u2019m mostly a cow and chicken guy anyhow.

Sometimes the seed packets get a wonky seed in there. I get a little excited, and \u2588\u2588\u2588 starts talking about how he might enter it into the fair. I mean, he didn\u2019t tell me, but \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 down at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 said he was chomping at the bit. \u2588\u2588\u2588 always had a greedy eye. I started taking good care of it, thinking he might share some of that fair money. Or maybe I ought to just let him have it for taking care of the place. But about two weeks before I\u2019m packed and on the plane, he fucking stiffs me with the bill at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s. I\u2019m pissed and drunk when I get home, so I drive out into the field with my old Ford and an axe. I whack into the pumpkin, and it starts screaming -\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Are you telling me the Pumpkin Man was alive?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh yeah. That\u2019s putting it lightly. He was freaking out; thrashing around in there, hollering. He was thumping and kicking against those hollow pumpkin walls. I was afraid he\u2019d get out, so I just kept swinging. Eventually he stopped hollering, and I knocked the pumpkin apart enough to load it into the truck. I think that\u2019s when the fear really set in. When we were kids, we used to put out food for the Pumpkin Man, and I had killed him. What did that mean for me? You know, the curse. I was so scared, I loaded him up in the truck, too. He was dead by then, and not too big, by the looks of him. I was running on pure adrenaline, so he didn\u2019t weigh hardly a thing. I drove out to the river and pushed him in.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n So you\u2019re saying that the Pumpkin Man was not only animate, but verbal?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh yeah. I mean, he wasn\u2019t spouting Shakespeare or anything, but he was hollering like a baby stuck in a man\u2019s body. It was damn eerie. Damn eerie.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n A baby\u2026 Can you show us where you disposed of his body?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Sure. Anything you want.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You said you used to put out food for the Pumpkin Man when you were younger. Please elaborate.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Sure, sure. We all used to do it. We put out a little bread or pieces of meat. They\u2019d disappear the next day, so we knew he was out there. Probably just the crows, you know. Or mice or something. Back then, it was a simple fact that it was the Pumpkin Man. Just like Santa.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Did you ever see the Pumpkin Man when you were younger?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I\u2019d see things. Weird things. You know, when I was out hunting or whatever. Bare feet in the silt miles out of town. Little piles of rocks around the pumpkins, you know. Like, like fairy rings. Ask anybody in the Mat-Su Valley. This one time, there were neat little piles of shit throughout the patch. Humanure type stuff kind of sitting in these little shallow holes. Weird as hell. Thought it might be a trick or something, like tipping outhouses. Sometimes tools disappear or show up someplace strange, but you can never really tell if you left them somewhere stupid or if somebody just borrowed them without asking. You know\u2026 somebody not Pumpkin Man.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you, you\u2019ve been very helpful. If you can think of anything else, or if you see anything else regarding the Pumpkin Man, please contact us as soon as possible.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Whatever you say, lady.\n\n\n<End Log \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1984\u00a008:03:24>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 should be actively monitored for three months.

Ultrasound tests confirmed SCP-2531-04 exhibited signs of life. Although nutrients were provided, the stem was damaged in transport. SCP-2531-04 subsequent death and decomposition began 13 hours after transport. SCP-2531 was removed from pumpkin/womb and although rigor mortis had begun, SCP-2531-04 showed a remarkable lack of decomposition.\n\n\n3 letters were observed inscribed upon the right palm of SCP-2531-04 [see SCP-2531-03].

Thank you for coming in. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No problem, and please call me \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I imagine this is all about the Pumpkin Man. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: As a matter of fact it is. Please let me cut right to the chase. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: By all means. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: In the Anchorage Daily News article, you mentioned that you had some familiarity with the local legend of the Pumpkin Man. Can you please elaborate? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So it\u2019s campfire stories you're after? Sure. Sure. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve heard. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I don\u2019t know when the stories started, but I remember people talking about the Pumpkin Man when I was a little boy. Used to scare us a bit. Sometimes, we\u2019d even joke around about it, you know. \u2018Hey, mom, this pie tastes a little funny. You cook up the Pumpkin Man?\u2019 We\u2019d laugh, but, you know, inside we were always a little scared, like if you said his name too many times, he\u2019d come around or something. It\u2019s like them damn angels. Everybody always talks about how sweet and helpful and how when their farm dog dies, he\u2019s coming back as a guardian angel, or some such. It\u2019s all horse shit. Read the damn Bible. If you ever saw an angel in real life, you\u2019d more likely shit your pants than dance. Scary as hell. Pumpkin Man was like that. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yes, but can you recall any specifics regarding the Pumpkin Man? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sorry. I\u2019m getting on. Didn\u2019t used to meander so much. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That\u2019s fine. This is all very interesting. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah, so, Pumpkin Man comes around every few years. Some people think him showing up is a blessing. You know, next year will be a record harvest or something like that. But some folks think it\u2019s a pall, you know. You screwed up, and now Pumpkin Man is coming to let you know to turn around quick. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So how\u2019s business? [Both Laughing] \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Damn fine. You sciencey folks are great for the pocket book. But I\u2019m not so sure I want all this attention. Good note to go out on, I guess. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So your reluctance to continue farming was sincere? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It\u2019s like if you\u2019ve gone fishing all your life, but one day you drag up a fish with a kid\u2019s finger sticking out the mouth. Every fish you pull up after that is sort of ruined. It\u2019s like that now. Might fade, but I doubt it. Before, Pumpkin Man was sort of abstract. I imagined him like a cartoon character when I was a kid. Big jack-o-lantern for a head. Seeing what was inside that pumpkin. Well. Some things you can\u2019t ever unsee. Know what I mean? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: More than you know. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You know, I\u2019d say \u2018I doubt that, young lady.\u2019 But\u2026 I believe you. So, yeah. You just sort of quietly hope to God that no Pumpkin Man shows up. I\u2019ve heard of folks cutting open pumpkins and finding a bunch of slime inside\u2026 like rotten yogurt or custard or something. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Adipocere. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Excuse me? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Adipocere. Fat-wax. It\u2019s a cheesy, grayish-white mass produced when the body's proteins convert to fat. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Wow. Well isn\u2019t that pleasant. Yeah. Weird stuff. It\u2019s not the usual rot you see in a pumpkin. They always say \u2018that\u2019s him!\u2019 But I was never sure. Like I said in the article, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 promised on his mother\u2019s grave that he opened one up and saw Pumpkin Man. He was so damn scared that he loaded it on his pickup and threw it in the river. He was never the brightest. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We\u2019ve asked Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for an interview, but he has yet to get back to us. Again, thank you for your cooperation. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No problem. Yeah. I made a big mistake saying his name to the papers. He\u2019ll probably never have us over for dinner again. Funny how what I did validated his claims, but now everybody thinks he\u2019s crazier than ever. I really regret dragging him into it. Shooting off my big mouth. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are there any stories of the Pumpkin Man outside the pumpkin, or is he always locked away? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Oh sure. Those are the worst ones. They say when he\u2019s about to come out, he wails something fierce. Screaming like a banshee. Anybody with a lick of sense gets the hell out of the field. Of course in the stories, it always happens at night, and more often than not, there\u2019s a big old lightning storm, even though lightning is about as common as Russians around here. Those stories are the worst, because he\u2019s always stalking around in the mist, watching. I think that\u2019s almost worse than coming up and eating bad little boys and girls. I mean, what the hell is he doing? What does he want? Where did he come from? If he ate us up, we could at least figure he was a devil or something. If he helped us out, maybe he\u2019d be like Frankenstein's monster or something. You know, kind of benevolent but confused. But he just lingers and watches. Why? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Do you know anyone who has seen him? Outside of the pumpkin, I mean. Out in the fields? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Most of the stories have him out in the woods, staying on the fringe, you know. Out in the mist. I don\u2019t know of anybody by name. Friend of a friend type thing. But I can ask around at the local watering hole. I\u2019d better use this fame while I\u2019ve got it. Think I could write a book? [Both Laughing] Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: In the article, you mentioned that\u2026 just a second. \u2018All I know is that you\u2019re supposed to leave those ones alone.\u2019 What did you mean by that? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You know, I\u2019ve asked myself that same question. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember if I heard that from somebody, or if it\u2019s just a feeling. You know, we have some of the puzzle pieces, and sometimes I think I can see the bigger picture. Pretty presumptuous, I know. I think he doesn\u2019t want to be seen. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll be ashamed or angry. Either way, I\u2019d rather let him slink around in the woods unseen than have him upset or ashamed. Ignorance is bliss, and in this case, I\u2019m just fine sticking my head in the sand. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you so much Mr. \u2588\u2026 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Is there anything else you can tell us? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Nothing that someone else couldn\u2019t tell you better, I\u2019m afraid. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Well, again, thank you. Your information is invaluable. If you can think of anything else, please don\u2019t hesitate to call. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thanks. It\u2019s not everyday I get the number of a beautiful young woman.

I\u2019m not telling you shit! [DATA EXPUNGED] \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Please, please! I\u2019ll tell you anything, just please! Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Please tell us about the fall you discovered the Pumpkin Man. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Okay. Okay. I was just scared, okay? He\u2019s not really human, right? Like an animal. You can\u2019t write me up for that, right? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We have no interest in bringing criminal charges against you if you cooperate, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and I would appreciate if you would give us the same courtesy. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Alright. Okay. It was right around September \u2588\u2588 or \u2588\u2588 maybe. I was going to go visit the kids down in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588 was going to look after the place while I was gone. I was going to be out during harvest season, but there wasn\u2019t much to harvest back in 19\u2588\u2588, so I wasn\u2019t losing any sleep over it. I\u2019m mostly a cow and chicken guy anyhow. Never had the green thumb like \u2588\u2588, but, you know, I\u2019d put in some carrots, pumpkins, and potatoes every year. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but who is \u2588\u2588? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: My late wife. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I see. Please continue. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So I see one of those pumpkins is getting real big. It\u2019s not too weird. Sometimes the seed packets get a wonky seed in there. I get a little excited, and \u2588\u2588\u2588 starts talking about how he might enter it into the fair. I mean, he didn\u2019t tell me, but \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 down at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 said he was chomping at the bit. \u2588\u2588\u2588 always had a greedy eye. I started taking good care of it, thinking he might share some of that fair money. Or maybe I ought to just let him have it for taking care of the place. But about two weeks before I\u2019m packed and on the plane, he fucking stiffs me with the bill at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s. I\u2019m pissed and drunk when I get home, so I drive out into the field with my old Ford and an axe. I whack into the pumpkin, and it starts screaming - Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are you telling me the Pumpkin Man was alive? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Oh yeah. That\u2019s putting it lightly. He was freaking out; thrashing around in there, hollering. He was thumping and kicking against those hollow pumpkin walls. I was afraid he\u2019d get out, so I just kept swinging. Eventually he stopped hollering, and I knocked the pumpkin apart enough to load it into the truck. I think that\u2019s when the fear really set in. When we were kids, we used to put out food for the Pumpkin Man, and I had killed him. What did that mean for me? You know, the curse. I was so scared, I loaded him up in the truck, too. He was dead by then, and not too big, by the looks of him. I was running on pure adrenaline, so he didn\u2019t weigh hardly a thing. I drove out to the river and pushed him in. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So you\u2019re saying that the Pumpkin Man was not only animate, but verbal? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Oh yeah. I mean, he wasn\u2019t spouting Shakespeare or anything, but he was hollering like a baby stuck in a man\u2019s body. It was damn eerie. Damn eerie. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: A baby\u2026 Can you show us where you disposed of his body? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sure. Anything you want. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You said you used to put out food for the Pumpkin Man when you were younger. Please elaborate. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sure, sure. We all used to do it. We put out a little bread or pieces of meat. They\u2019d disappear the next day, so we knew he was out there. Probably just the crows, you know. Or mice or something. Back then, it was a simple fact that it was the Pumpkin Man. Just like Santa. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Did you ever see the Pumpkin Man when you were younger? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I\u2019d see things. Weird things. You know, when I was out hunting or whatever. Bare feet in the silt miles out of town. Little piles of rocks around the pumpkins, you know. Like, like fairy rings. Ask anybody in the Mat-Su Valley. This one time, there were neat little piles of shit throughout the patch. Humanure type stuff kind of sitting in these little shallow holes. Weird as hell. Thought it might be a trick or something, like tipping outhouses. Sometimes tools disappear or show up someplace strange, but you can never really tell if you left them somewhere stupid or if somebody just borrowed them without asking. You know\u2026 somebody not Pumpkin Man. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you, you\u2019ve been very helpful. If you can think of anything else, or if you see anything else regarding the Pumpkin Man, please contact us as soon as possible. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Whatever you say, lady. <End Log \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1984\u00a008:03:24> Closing Statement: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 should be actively monitored for three months.

Ultrasound tests confirmed SCP-2531-04 exhibited signs of life. Although nutrients were provided, the stem was damaged in transport. SCP-2531-04 subsequent death and decomposition began 13 hours after transport. SCP-2531 was removed from pumpkin/womb and although rigor mortis had begun, SCP-2531-04 showed a remarkable lack of decomposition. 3 letters were observed inscribed upon the right palm of SCP-2531-04 [see SCP-2531-03]. Both sub-dermal scalpel laceration (Q) and grafting laser burn (W) were clearly discernible. The tattooed letter (G) was visible only as irritated skin. There was no physical trace of ink within the punctures. There was also no physical trace of permanent ink. SCP-2531-04 was implanted with a GPS tracking device as well as an RFID chip below the left clavicle. SCP-2531-04 was stored at room temperature to attempt to induce recurrence for future containment. SCP-2531-04 was completely reduced to organic dust in 31 hours (exponential decomposition).

    "description": "SCP-2531 is a 70\u00a0kg (150 lbs) humanoid figure of indeterminable sex and pallid complexion, usually found in a state of advanced decay. In each occurrence, SCP-2531 has been discovered sealed within Cucurbita maxima (commonly known as giant squash or giant pumpkin). SCP-2531\u2019s height has been found to vary depending on the volume of the pumpkin\u2019s interior. DNA samples taken from SCP-2531 have confirmed that the humanoid figure, although usually severely decomposed, deformed, and contorted, shares 91.4% DNA match to that of Homo sapiens sapiens and 7.2% match to that of Homo neanderthalensis. SCP-2531 is found connected to the interior wall of a giant pumpkin via an umbilical cord composed of both plant and animal matter. The cord runs from the inside of the pumpkin\u2019s stem to the base of SCP-2531\u2019s skull. SCP-2531 does not exhibit an abdominal navel. After the vine/stem/umbilical is severed or severely damaged, SCP-2531 begins to decompose at an exponential rate until only organic dust remains. After an unknown amount of time, SCP-2531 is rediscovered within a new pumpkin. Despite efforts by the Foundation and non-Foundation to preserve SCP-2531, to date no attempts at containment have proven effective.",
