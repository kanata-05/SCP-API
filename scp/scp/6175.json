All extranormal radio signals and soundwaves originating from SCP-6175 are to be recorded, translated and stored within Site-300-12's database. All mentions regarding anomalous phenomena surrounding the \nVoyager 1\n spacecraft are to be tracked and deleted by Foundation Webcrawler FIRESTORM.aic.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6175 is the \nVoyager 1\n probe. Following an anomalous event on the 09/15/2022, SCP-6175 turned on an unauthorized and previously unknown video camera implanted to its disk, and gained contact with a NASA research team within the Marshall Spacial Flight Center, in Alabama, for the next 5 months. During the spanned amount of time, SCP-6175 underwent several anomalous phenomena.\n\n\nSee Addendum 6175.1 for additional information regarding the timeline of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6175.1:\n Timeline of Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following addendum includes a timeline of events regarding SCP-6175's autonomous behavior and additional anomalous phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n09/15/2022 - 09/28/2022:\n \nVoyager 1\n begins broadcasting footage of Neptune while gaining contact with NASA researchers.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n None.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/28/2022 - 09/30/2022:\n NASA researchers report contact loss with SCP-6175 for unknown reasons. Hypothesis regarding the impact of the \nVoyager 1\n probe with another object were brought up, although quickly discarded. Research team was successfully infiltrated by MTF Gamma-55.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n SCP-6175's camera was reported to be shifting and vibrating prior to loss of contact. Following this event, SCP-6175 regained contact with the research team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/30/2022 - 10/22/2022:\n SCP-6175 is hypothesized to be teleported to an unknown location, believed to be the Bo\u00f6tes void, otherwise known as \nSCP-3200\n. The object is reported to be rotating constantly. No soundwaves, celestial bodies or astros are recorded during said amount of time.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n SCP-6175 was reported to be vibrating or shifting occasionally in an aggresive way for the following weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 superfluous logs removed for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/31/2022 - 11/01/2022:\n First contact between SCP-6175 and a foreign object within its proximity. Object reported to take the form of an antenna, similar to that of the \nVoyager\n diagram.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n The antenna was reported to be mangled and deteriorated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 superfluous logs removed for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/01/2022 - 11/08/2O22:\n Second contact between SCP-6175 and another object, reported to be a paper note. Object was zoomed in by SCP-6175's camera in order to be identified. The following note read:\n\n\nVoyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.\n\n\n\u2014 \nStephen J. Pyne\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n The note remained floating for a week before vanishing. It was unable to deteriorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/08/2022 - 11/28/2022:\n NASA computers reported radio signals originating from SCP-6175's satellite dish, which were identified to be morse code. The signals were translated into English, and the anomaly was reported to be the lyrics of \"Space Oddity\", by David Bowie.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n A loud hum of the song's instrumental was heard throughout the assigned NASA facility, followed by human footsteps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 superfluous logs removed for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/03/2022 - 12/31/2022:\n SCP-6175 is seen advancing on a straight line at high speeds, several parts of itself splitting and traveling faster than the anomaly. The separate parts follow SCP-6175 regardless of their status. SCP-6175 progressively emits a large amount of radio signals throughout the mentioned span of time, translated from morse code into the message from the note recollected last month.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n The separate parts were reported to be deteriorated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/31/2022 - 01/14/2023:\n SCP-6175 stops, before broadcasting static for the following 2 weeks.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n None. Radio signals were sent to the research team, translated as human shouting and crying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/14/2023 - 02/12/2023:\n SCP-6175 makes contact once again with its research team. During this span of time, several paper notes with stars and planets inscribed into them began spawning around SCP-6175.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n One of the notes was said to have several drawings, with one doodle resembling three individuals, though one shorter than the others, inscribed into them. SCP-6175 sent several radio signals, similar to illegible human vocalizations.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the last log, no anomalous phenomena spawned within SCP-6175's proximity. The anomaly was then reclassified by the 6175-assigned team as neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6175.2:\n Incident Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 02/04/2025, a few months prior to the end of the \nVoyager 1\n's mission, several radio signals were sent to a NASA facility kept within Cape Canaveral. Most of the sent radio signals, proceeding from SCP-6175 itself, were illegible but able to be stored, with only one of them was translated and kept within the facility's database until discovery by MTF Gamma-55:\n\n\n\n\nI love you. And I always will.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this event, the \nVoyager 2\n probe began sending meaningless radio signals to the NASA station at Cape Canaveral, before turning off once again\n1\n. SCP-6175 later broadcasted the Bo\u00f6tes Void, before the \nVoyager 2\n satellite, therefore designated as SCP-6175-1, appeared within SCP-6175's surroundings.\n\n\nAdditionally, a radio signal proceeding from SCP-6175-1 was sent to the facility at Cape Canaveral:\n\n\n\n\nI love you too, dear. It's time to come back home.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6175 reclassified to Euclid. Attempts to recover SCP-6175 and SCP-6175-1 are currently ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6174\n | SCP-6175 | \nSCP-6176\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The \nVoyager 2\n already ended its mission by the time the signals were sent.",
