The Foundation has agreed to co-fund the Lycanthrope Memorial Center and aiding \nThe Most Secret British Society for Lycanthropic Studies and Changeling Research\n1\n in the scientific archiving and documentation of SCP-6753 related media and cultural objects of relevance.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6753 designated a now extinct variant of the lycanthropic super-species\n2\n, distinguishable by their red-coloured fur, thin tails and the presence of a sixth digit and toe on all limbs, as well as their ability to cloak and disguise themselves using Rho-type CPI-pheromones\n3\n. Geographical extension mainly centered around Southeast Asia, Lemuria and most of the Sino-Russian Tsardom.\n\n\n \n\nThe species' complete and total extinction was determined and officially verified on the 16th Cheshvan of 1895 by GOC scientists, three years after the shattering of the moon, making it the fourth variant of the lycanthropic super-species that was unable to adapt to the lunar absence, despite all attempts on part of the Foundation\n4\n.\n\n\n \n\nContainment Research Project REDO-LENCE (CRP-0104), a joint venture of GOC and Foundation forces established in 1897, conducts physiological and histological research on the remaining corpses and bodies of deceased SCP-6753 instances, in order to document and analyse their biological means of Rho-type CPI-pheromone synthesis. The final and overarching goal of Project REDO-LENCE is to establish the industrial production of Rho-type CPI-pheromones\n5\n via the creation of a genetically modified organism, preferential prokaryotic, and the assembly of a microbial fermentation pipeline for drug manufacturing and purification.\n\n\n \n\nRho-type CPI-pheromones exhibit a multitude of favourable properties regarding their efficacy on baseline and anomalous humanoids, and early test screenings indicate lower and fewer adverse side effects compared to established amnestics/antimemetics.\n\n\n \n\nThe genetic components responsible for the biochemical production of Rho-type CPI-pheromones could be identified, synthesized and cloned into suitable vector plasmids. Transformation of multiple prokaryotic organisms, immortalized cells and various cancer cells was successful. Henceforth, such genetically modified organisms will be referred to as instances of SCP-6753-GMO.\n\n\n \n\nContinuous progress is severely hindered due to the conceptual connection between lycanthropic genetic material and the now absent lunar satellite. While SCP-6753-GMO instances (see above) could be grown and cultivated without further difficulty, no metabolic production of Rho-type CPI-pheromones occurred inside the cells. Lacking any lunar presence, the necessary steps of gene transcription and protein synthesis cannot transpire without violating higher noospheric belief systems regarding lycanthropic nature.\n\n\n \n\nSuch intricacies were anticipated, and theoretical proposals for solution currently under discussion include:\n\n\n\n\nthe total or partial relocation of Project REDO-LENCE to a parallel version of Earth, where the moon is still present\n6\n, or to another celestial body possessing a comparable lunar satellite\n7\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe cultivation and incubation of SCP-6753-GMO instances under artificial moonlight, or in the presence of an Astrological Pseudo-Lunar Radiation Unit\n8\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe cultivation and incubation of SCP-6753-GMO instances in mooncalf\n9\n blood serum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe cultivation and incubation of SCP-6753-GMO instances in blood serum obtained from menstrual discharge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe cultivation and incubation of SCP-6753-GMO instances on moon-shaped cheese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe professional handling of SCP-6753-GMO instances by female research personnel bearing the names \nLuna\n, \nSelene\n, \nArtemis\n or \nDiana\n since birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreating SCP-6753-GMO instances with purified saliva of somnambulant individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreating SCP-6753-GMO instances with bone marrow material obtained from deceased astronomers or taikonauts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsertion of SCP-6753 and baseline \nHomo sapiens\n genetic material in \nCanis lupus\n totipotent embryonic stem cells and initializing a cross-breeding experiment to create a canine SCP-6753-GMO instance similar in physiological makeup to SCP-6753.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe revitalization of deceased SCP-6753 instances via necrochemical/necrophysical means for further studies and experiments.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe experimental usage of voluntary translycanthropic individuals\n10\n in xenograft essays\n11\n or for cross-breeding (see above) was suggested and considered at multiple times, but was vetoed by the Judicial Department of Applied Divination.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
