The Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, and the Unusual Incidents Unit have entered into a temporary agreement to identify themselves to the public under the umbrella of a single entity titled the \u201cSourcery Initiative.\u201d Disinformation claiming that SCP-8320 is an isolated incident and the only extant anomaly is currently being propagated, with pseudoscience explaining the phenomenon in non-anomalous terms currently being devised.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 are to be detained using remote detonating thaumaturgical anchors and handled by no fewer than 7 armed personnel trained in anti-magic combat.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 are to be shot in the head on sight.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8320 is a phenomenon globally affecting all domestic cats. Although this effect is fully reversible and does not inherently harm the animal, the resulting increase in intelligence, dexterity, and anomalous ability has resulted in the spread of populations and the misplacement of many house pets. The effect was caused by Eric \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a 23-year-old resident of Brentwood, New Hampshire, known henceforth as PoI-8320. PoI-8320 has been missing since June 4, 2025, the date SCP-8320 initially occurred. From evidence recovered at the scene, SCP-8320 was likely caused by PoI-8320\u2019s attempt to use some manner of anomalous item (missing) to turn his cat (also missing) into a \u201cmagical creature.\u201d\n1\n\n\nSCP-8320 and the ensuing events began instantaneously at 3:08am on June 4, 2025, when every member of the species \nFelis catus\n2\n suddenly transformed into Type Green humanoid reality benders, designated instances of SCP-8320-1, all with common physical characteristics.\n\n\nObserved common characteristics within instances of SCP-8320-1 include:\n\n\n\n\nVery elderly, regardless of the age of the original animal\n\n\nLong-haired and bearded, regardless of sex of the humanoid\n\n\nWearing large hats, usually pointed or otherwise eclectically shaped\n\n\nWearing floor-length robes, tunics, or capes in bright colors, often embroidered with simple shapes like stars or crescents\n\n\nCarrying wooden staffs or wands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance of SCP-8320-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 are observed to be of greater safety risk to the public when many are present in a small space. The instances appear to be immensely territorial, and will frequently employ anomalous measures to eject other instances from their perceived territory. These conflicts have resulted in significant property damage through the use of anomalous abilities, but relatively few civilian casualties. SCP-8320-1 instances are almost always friendly to humans in spite of their massive aggression toward one another.\n\n\nCommon SCP-8320-1 behaviors that present a danger to the public include:\n\n\n\n\nThe spontaneous creation of narrow, but very tall stone towers\n\n\nThrowing balls of fire, bolts of electricity, or other concentrations of energy at other SCP-8320-1 instances with disregard to surrounding structures, people, or wildlife\n\n\nThe creation of small, localized weather events (primarily thunderstorms)\n\n\nThe attack and consumption of small poultry (pigeons, game hens, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandmade poster found near the residence of PoI-8320.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum \u2013 Lifted Veil Scenario 8320\n\n\n\n\nWe have a very big problem on our hands and that problem has appeared in the form of about 700 million wizards.\n\n\n- Memo from Dr. E. Weatherwax\n\n\n\n\nThe sudden appearance of millions of anomalous humanoids in place of domestic cats immediately resulted in a BK-Class Lifted Veil scenario. Due to the scale of the anomaly, initial containment was impossible.\n3\n In addition to the sheer number of instances, their anomalous abilities and general intelligence made containing individual specimens extremely difficult. Embedded Foundation agents and social engineers are currently working to keep public knowledge of anomalies limited to SCP-8320 specifically, perpetuating the idea that SCP-8320 is a singular, isolated incident.\n\nPrior to the discovery that SCP-8320-1 instances originated from cats, the Foundation apprehended several instances for containment and questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Instance SCP-8320-1 was captured near Site-109 shortly after SCP-8320 took effect. It was discovered hovering several feet off the ground, drinking tea, and eating a small bird whole.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n So, from my understanding, you are a wizard.\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n That\u2019s my understanding as well!\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n Why are you here? And why were you eating that bird?\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n They call me Morgo the Magnificent!\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n Who calls you that?\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n Oh, most people.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n I don\u2019t.\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n No matter. I must return to my tower. The books get lonely when I\u2019m away long.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n You have a tower?\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n Of course! All good wizards have towers.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n I haven\u2019t seen any tower near here.\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n Then there must not be many good wizards.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n I don\u2019t think you have an tower. I think you\u2019re lying.\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n Wizards can\u2019t lie. Breaks us out in hives.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n All wizards are allergic to lying?\n\n\nSCP-8320-1:\n Yes. And bee stings.\n\n\n[At this moment, Dr. Helit enters, draws a sidearm, and shoots SCP-8320-1 in the head.]\n\n\n[SCP-8320-1 vanishes in a burst of glittering, pale blue spoke, leaving behind a gray, long-haired cat.]\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n Good Lord, Helit. Why did you do that?\n\n\nDr. Helit:\n I saw one of those bastards earlier. Sitting in my good chair. Just showed up in my house.\n\n\nDr. Vimes:\n And you shot him?\n\n\nDr. Helit:\n I panicked. But now I have my cat back, so it all worked out, didn\u2019t it?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation contained and neutralized a number of SCP-8320-1 instances before coming to the conclusion that, while capable of perfect human speech, instances of SCP-8320-1 cannot be properly classified as having a human level of intelligence. Site-109 created a specially-designed mobile vehicle for apprehending instances, equipped with anchoring and anti-magic devices. Force was used at a much lower frequency when it was discovered that most SCP-8320-1 instances will enter containment willingly upon being told something of interest is in the vehicle, like a grimoire or a bird. In an attempt to gather information about the origin of SCP-8320, instances were captured and held in the back of the vehicle, where agents would ask them simple questions. Upon determining that the instance did not have an appropriate level of intelligence to reliably answer additional questions, the instance was neutralized with a non-anomalous hand gun, and released as close to the capture location as possible. Site-109\u2019s SCP-8320 reconnaissance team captured and neutralized several SCP-8320-1 instances using the following line of questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did all the wizards come from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucian the Garrulous\n\n\n\u201cFrom over the tallest mountain and through the widest river.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOswald the Itchy\n\n\n\"From off the back of a very large turtle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMazdor the Overconfident\n\n\n\u201cFrom my mummy and daddy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your goals or intentions here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxar the Lackadaisical\n\n\n\"I have come to save the kingdom from the wicked demon Lostharnac.\"\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThaddius the Nasty\n\n\n\"To be perhaps some sort of healer or other man of science to serve the unwashed masses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy the Trespasser\n\n\n\"I'm running away from death.

Numerous and vaguely stupid magicians have popped up on every street corner, and in many cases, have replaced our beloved pets. People from across the world have come together in an amazing display of violence and firepower, but the exploration of the destruction of the wizards has been limited to guns alone. I seek to provide the masses with a new way of enjoying our mutual bloodthirst together in a manner not dissimilar to fireworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransit ticket purchased by SCP-8320-A.

Any available mobile task force personnel, along with personnel from other branches proficient in firearms, were re-assigned to temporary Mobile Task Force Sigma-32 \u201cPropagandalf.\u201d The Foundation paused all other operations that were not strictly functional and absolutely necessary. Embedded Foundation agents in governments around the world propagated ideas regarding the danger of civilians dressing similarly to SCP-8320-1 instances during this time.\n\nBoth the Global Occult Coalition and the Unusual Incidents Unit agreed to a temporary alliance until SCP-8320 could be neutralized. Each designated an officer for the purpose of communication between organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following is a transcript of a video call between Dr. Weatherwax of the Foundation, Agent Nitt of the Global Occult Coalition, and Dr. Ogg of the Unusual Incidents Unit.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Only Dr. Weatherwax and Dr. Ogg are present on the call.]\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n I have something here about some posters found near the home of the dimwit that started all this, I think we should take a look at-\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n I suppose we should get started without her, then, shouldn\u2019t we?\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n I suppose we should-\n\n\n[Agent Nitt joins the video call. She is eating a cup of instant noodles and flipping through a day planner with her other hand.]\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n My apologies, I\u2019m here! Big day, huh?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Is this a bad time?\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n No! No. Downed powerline across the street, had to talk to some guys about it. Carry on, I\u2019m just getting myself in order. Ignore me. So! Wizards.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n We\u2019re thanking our lucky stars that they\u2019re not doing much besides shooting lightning bolts at each other.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Bet you\u2019re glad to have our methods at your disposal now, aren\u2019t you?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n No-\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes]\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Allergic to lying? Perhaps bee stings as well?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n \nNo,\n I\u2019m allergic to cats.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Well, that doesn\u2019t exactly track.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n The wizards must have worse dander, I think.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n I have a report here estimating the number of stray and outdoor cats here in the United States-\n\n\n[Dr. Ogg drops a large binder full of papers onto the floor.]\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Oh, shit-\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Just leave it, Dr. Ogg, we know there are too many outdoor cats.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n And \nnow\n there are too many outdoor wizards.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n And too many indoor ones as well, for that matter.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n But as luck would have it, they\u2019re very easy to locate, and even easier to neutralize.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n And guns are really all it takes? No anti-magic countermeasures?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n We tried knives as well, but it only works if you get them in the head, which is notoriously harder to stab than anywhere else.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n What about explosives? Have you tried exploding them?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n We have not tried exploding them.\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes.]\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Ugh. Excuse me. We have business.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n The business of calculating how many wizards we can blast in the shortest amount of time?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Exactly.\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes again.

Agents \"King Gizz\" and \"Merlin\" are working task force agents, \"Gandalf,\" \"Oz,\" and \"White Witch\" are other personnel. Their assignment is in a derelict former industrial area, known to be home to a colony of at least 30 feral cats.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]\n\n\n18:32\n \n[Unit 67D rests inside an abandoned structure after roughly 3 hours on duty.]\n\n\n18:35\n \n[Unit Captain King Gizz speaks to the group.

Cohen and the accompanying civilians refused to leave the area, lauding a large number of successful neutralizations, but eventually agreed to defer to King Gizz's leadership. All were led to believe that Unit 67D were United States federal agents. Local law enforcement in the area advised to discourage the formation of similar militias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral weeks into the Sourcery Initiative\u2019s efforts to eliminate the SCP-8320-1 population, the Foundation received the following message from Wilson's Wildlife Solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey there!\n\n\nWe're sure you've been just as busy as we have with current events. We've been up to our eyeballs, what with this whole affair being basically an animal control crisis! Given we try our best to solve our problems with as little violence as possible, we have been returning our surprise guests back to their furry forms as quickly and humanely as we can. We've even managed to establish a new catch-and-release program for vaccinating and sterilizing our local feral cat populations, with great success! But the longer this goes on, the more anxious we're getting about our feathered friends in addition to our furry ones. It's clear to us now that the wizards are doing enormous damage to local songbird populations worldwide. Even compared to their true feline forms, their appetites are truly insatiable. We would like to discuss some resources we might share between our organizations to expedite getting things back to \"normal.\" After all, you have much more firepower, but we have an extra level of expertise in herding cats.\n\n\n- F.

No reports of any anomalous abilities, but people still pulled guns, which is why we should really be talking to more public-facing people about shutting down the comic conventions.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Oh, shit, you\u2019re right.\n\n\n[Agent Nitt joins the call. She is disheveled and bleeding from a scratch across one cheek.]\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Good lord. Is this a bad time?\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n What happened to you?\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n I\u2019m fine. My daughter brought a squirrel into the house, took forever for us to get the thing back out. Shame the wizards aren\u2019t eating rodents, too. Ignore me. I\u2019m going to schedule a rabies shot, though. In case you hear me typing.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Glad to hear that you\u2019re alright-\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes]\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Wow. Still?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of them lately.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n It\u2019s come to our attention that we have other players involved in this game.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Faeowynn Wilson sent us a message.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n You got a message? The Library just mailed us another pipe bomb.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n We need to entertain the possibility of taking any allies we can get. Including the Library. And including civilians.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n You\u2019re not suggesting we collaborate with the Hand. I don\u2019t think they would-\n\n\n[Dr. Ogg reaches for something on his desk, knocking over a glass of water in the process.]\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Oh, god dammit.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n I don\u2019t mean collaborate. I mean truce. It's Christmas in 1914 and we're all going to stop shooting.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n At each other.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Of course we're going to keep shooting the wizards, yes. We should, for the moment, turn a blind eye to the activities of certain other groups. Maybe even lend a hand to the more reasonable ones, if they\u2019re doing anything to help us stop a global avian extinction event.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Gosh. It\u2019s that bad?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n They eat a horrifying amount of birds, Nitt. But on the bright side, the United States has one of the largest populations of cats.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n And the largest population of gun owners looking for an excuse.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Bingo.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\u00a0recovered\u00a0from\u00a0GOI\u00a0Alpha-19\u00a0temporary\u00a0outpost\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping vessel upon which SCP-8320-A stowed away to Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been carrying around a silly little pistol with me.

He looked just like the rest of them, I almost shot him. The crew of the ship was shooting at him too, so I think he wasn't supposed to be aboard to begin with. But he talked just like anybody, almost. Still a bit weird. I tried to get him through a Way, thinking maybe I could have more of a talk with him somewhere safer, but the second he touched it, there was this loud POP and he just disappeared. I have never seen someone so bad at magic that they can make a Way malfunction. I don't know where he went, but I'm sure somebody's got him by now. Couldn't have gotten far, what with the whole world out looking.\n\n\nK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3 - Environmental Impacts\n\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 appear to subsist on a diet of conjured food and small birds. In the weeks since the beginning of SCP-8320, environmental agencies, activist groups, and governments worldwide have raised concerns over the impact on local bird populations. Because of the immediacy of the risk, the Foundation and associated organizations have agreed to allow any interested party to partake in the elimination of SCP-8320, including other anomalous groups of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeatherwax\n\n\nFantastic news! The Artists finally succeeded in blowing up a wizard.\n\n\n\n\noh\n\n\n\n\nthey're probably not the first to do that but good to hear\n\n\n\n\nWeatherwax\n\n\nNo, I don't think you understand.\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\n\nWeatherwax\n\n\nIt didn't turn into a cat.\n\n\n\n\nIt turned into a bunch of passenger pigeons.\n\n\n\n\npassenger pigeons are extinct\n\n\n\n\nWeatherwax\n\n\nNot anymore, they're not.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNitt\n\n\nhey sorry I'm tardy to the party everyone, I got hit by a car\n\n\n\n\nI'm alright though\n\n\n\n\nthanks for the update about hte pigeons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter gathering reports of detonated SCP-8320-1 instances rematerializing as multiple birds instead of one cat, the Foundation ran several tests in sites around the world. A sample is listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nTotal No. of Animals\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtah, United States\n\n\n50\n\n\nJuniper Titmouse, Greater Sage-Grouse, Rednaped Sap-Sucker, Grasshopper Sparrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine, United States\n\n\n50\n\n\nCape May Warbler, Atlantic Puffin, Blue Jay, Downy Woodpecker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuangdong, China\n\n\n50\n\n\nLesser Cuckoo, Brown Crake, Yellowbreasted Bunting, Swinhoe\u2019s Minivet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation research has found that each SCP-8320-1 instance, upon being destroyed using an explosive, transforms into exactly 50 assorted birds weighing 10 to 500 grams. The quantity of any given species is seemingly random, but the variety present correlate to native species within a roughly 30 kilometer radius of the instance. It is also noted that this method of neutralization can result in the creation of specimens of recently-extinct bird species.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following is a transcript from a video call between Dr. Weatherwax, Dr. Ogg, and Agent Nitt.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes]\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Bless you. As I was saying-\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n It\u2019s finally getting better. I can tell we\u2019re toward the end.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Finally. This has been the longest four months of my life.\n\n\n[Agent Nitt joins the call]\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Sorry.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n What is it this time?\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n I forgot this was today.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Anyone have updates on the wizard black market?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n I hear Dark is getting awfully invested in it. Been trading them all over. Lots of countries jumping on the chance to repopulate their native birds. Very lucrative.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Terrible idea. Only a matter of time before one of them shoots a fireball through the wall of an airplane.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n One of them \nalready\n shot a fireball through the wall of an Anderson joint. I guess it didn't like being \nin\n the bubbling cauldron.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n We can be happy they\u2019re gullible. After all, look at New Zealand. It worked out for them.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n What about New Zealand?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Solved their cat overpopulation problem and their bird under-population problem in one go. Set up a \u201cgrand wizard tournament\u201d on top of a vacant lot full of a healthy amount of buried plastic explosives. They didn\u2019t even lose any of the animals. We\u2019re looking into it. Some of our researchers are a little worried about the hypothetical implications of explosion-proof songbirds.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n A \u201cgrand wizard tournament?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n They-\n\n\n[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes.]\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Bless you.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n It\u2019s the only way they could get so many of them in one place without starting a fight. An uncontrolled fight, anyway. Told them they were going to compete to see who was the best wizard.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n What\u2019s left? Are you going to disband your task force?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n They\u2019re already disbanded, mostly. Just a few squads taking care of the stragglers out in the rural areas.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n I thank God they\u2019re so easy to find. You don\u2019t even have to \nlook\n to find those towers.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Between us, the cat lovers, the gun lovers, and the avian conservationists, my guess is we\u2019ll be done with all this by the end of the month.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n And then we can focus on how to convince the whole world it didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Oh, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to try that hard. My niece is in college and when I asked her what she thought, she said it didn\u2019t lower her rent or pay her loans, so she doesn\u2019t care.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Our disinformation department is observing that most US citizens are talking about why it happened much less than they\u2019re talking about the NRA v NRFA case.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n The what?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n The National Rifle Association and the National Renaissance Fair Alliance.\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Ah.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n Did either of you see the reports about the cargo ship that found one of them stowed away? Traveled all the way across the country, hopped on a boat? Vanished from the port without a trace?\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n No?\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n You don\u2019t think that\u2019s strange behavior from one of them? Requires more forethought than we usually see?\n\n\nAgent Nitt:\n Maybe.\n\n\nDr. Weatherwax:\n Whatever happened, it\u2019s probably gone by now.\n\n\nDr. Ogg:\n You\u2019re right. It\u2019s probably gone by now.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdwatcher\u00a0Sighting\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following transcript is taken from the body camera footage of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Coin, of MTF Lambda-4 \"Birdwatchers,\" who was on duty staking out a potential sighting of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 in rural Alaska.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Coin\u2019s camera is level, pointed toward an abandoned farmhouse.]\n\n\n[A branch cracks behind her. She turns around and raises her rifle.]\n\n\n[Camera refocuses. Standing roughly 10 meters away from Coin is an SCP-8320-1 instance, wearing a red sequined pointed hat and a matching robe. It hides behind a tree.]\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n No no no no no, don\u2019t shoot!\n\n\n[Coin moves closer.]\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n \nPlease\n don\u2019t shoot, I\u2019ve been shot at so much already!\n\n\n[Coin lowers her rifle.]\n\n\nCoin:\n You look just like one of those wizards.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n I- I am! I am one of those wizards but-\n\n\n[Coin raises her rifle.]\n\n\n[SCP-8320-A collapses face-down onto the ground, clasping its hands behind its head.]\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Wait wait wait wait wait please! You can\u2019t shoot me! I can\u2019t be shot!\n\n\nCoin:\n Why\u2019s that?\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Because what if it hurts?\n\n\n[Coin lowers her rifle again. Neither speak for several seconds.]\n\n\nCoin:\n You don\u2019t seem like one of them.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Well, I am. I\u2019m a genuine bonafide wizard, I\u2019ll tell you.\n\n\nCoin:\n Then how come you talk like that?\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Talk like what?\n\n\nCoin:\n You know. Like a normal person. I\u2019ve blasted my fair share of wizards and usually they just shout something about how my wand is the wrong shape.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Oh. Well. I don\u2019t have a wand, so I wouldn\u2019t know.\n\n\nCoin:\n You\u2019re really one of them? You\u2019re not just somebody in a costume?\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Of course I am! I\u2019m just as much a wizard as the rest of them! Watch!\n\n\n[SCP-8320-A rolls up the sleeves of its tunic and holds out its hands. It strains. Nothing happens.]\n\n\nCoin:\n If that was supposed to be magic-\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n I\u2019m having an off day. Very long trip, you know. Hell of a boat. Not meant for people.\n\n\nCoin:\n It\u2019s still awfully dangerous to be walking around in a costume like that.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n It\u2019s not a-\n\n\n[SCP-8320-A pauses and rubs its beard.]\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Maybe I can\u2019t do my own magic- \nright now-\n but you watch this.\n\n\n[SCP-8320-A removes its hat and steps several paces away from it. The hat disappears and reappears on its head.]\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Ha ha! See? I told you! I told you!\n\n\nCoin:\n Ohh\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n If I could have worn a disguise to keep myself from being shot at all the way around the country, I would have done it, wouldn\u2019t I? Would have simplified things, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\nCoin:\n I\u2019m a little amazed you made it this far.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Well, I might not be the best at magic, but I suppose I\u2019m the best at staying alive. And at this point, I don\u2019t think I want to be either, frankly.\n\n\nCoin:\n You said you came here on a boat.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n I went \nsomewhere\n on a boat. I've no idea how I ended up here, though. One minute I was on a dock, the next I was out here. Sure doesn't look like Mexico.\n\n\nCoin:\n Why travel around so much in the first place?\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n I\u2019m looking for my friend. My best friend. The man with curly black hair and glasses. He\u2019s very nice to me. Scratches under my chin and everything. I want to find him so we can go home.\n\n\nCoin:\n Where\u2019s home?\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n The red house by the two maple trees.\n\n\nCoin:\n I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll call in, and we can go back to base. We\u2019ll help you find your friend.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Really? You promise?\n\n\nCoin:\n Sure. But once we find him, we\u2019re turning you back into a cat again.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n By blasting me?\n\n\nCoin:\n It won\u2019t hurt.\n\n\nSCP-8320-A:\n Then thank the gods. I\u2019m tired of this.

Although this effect is fully reversible and does not inherently harm the animal, the resulting increase in intelligence, dexterity, and anomalous ability has resulted in the spread of populations and the misplacement of many house pets. The effect was caused by Eric \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a 23-year-old resident of Brentwood, New Hampshire, known henceforth as PoI-8320. PoI-8320 has been missing since June 4, 2025, the date SCP-8320 initially occurred. From evidence recovered at the scene, SCP-8320 was likely caused by PoI-8320\u2019s attempt to use some manner of anomalous item (missing) to turn his cat (also missing) into a \u201cmagical creature.\u201d1",
