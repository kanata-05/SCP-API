Personnel with Level 4 clearance may interact with SCP-7580 after submitting a formal request to the director of Site-7.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-7580 is the designation for a Cold Steel brand pocket knife recovered from the gymnasium of Shelbyville High School in Texas. When closed, the item exhibits no abnormal traits. When opened however, SCP-7580 reveals the spiritual manifestation of former Foundation thaumaturge Lily Spurlock, hereafter referred to as SCP-7580-1. SCP-7580-1 is identical to Agent Spurlock apart from appearing grey, translucent, and incorporeal. Testing has revealed that SCP-7580-1 will remain within 1m of SCP-7580 during manifestation events. Although SCP-7580-1 appears conscious of its surroundings, it has been unresponsive to any attempts at communication, though it can be heard repeatedly vocalizing the phrase \"no more.\"\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7580-A-1: Discovery\n\n\nThe Foundation discovered SCP-7580 following a report made by Spurlock\u2019s significant other and Foundation employee, Emily Conners. Conners claimed that Agent Spurlock had not been in contact for the past five days, and had grown concerned that she was in danger. Foundation investigators discovered that Agent Spurlock had neglected to update her supervisors during her own investigation of a small GoI known as \u201cUtility Union\u201d. Spurlock was apparently known to take long breaks between updates, so it wasn\u2019t considered an issue.\n\n\nThe Foundation launched an investigation with Conners acting as an advisor. Following a 2-day search, SCP-7580 was discovered alongside several VHS tapes documenting Spurlock\u2019s torture\n2\n. A thorough examination of the scene concluded Lily Spurlock was dead, although no body was recovered. The seven members of the Utility Union have not been found.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7580-A-2: Post-Incident Interview\n\n\nInterview Transcript 7580-A\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Frank Howard\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Emily Conners\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nHoward\n: You sure you\u2019re up for this? We can wait a few days.\n\n\nConners\n: What\u2019s gonna change in a few days, Frank?\n\n\nHoward\n: Fair enough. Why don\u2019t we start from the moment you realized something was wrong and we go from there?\n\n\nConners\n: Yeah, okay. I felt\u2026 no. God, how do I explain this\u2026\n\n\nHoward\n: Just start from the beginning.\n\n\nConners\n: Okay. Lily and I both came from similar places, ya know. Our parents were Foundation thaumaturges and, despite their best efforts, we became mages just like them. There was a time that the Foundation would've just fried the knowledge from our brains, but resources have been so scarce the past decade. One thing led to another and bam, we were employed instead. Lily and I were in the same training camp and- \n(chuckles)\n that\u2019s how we met. Actually funny story, one time-\n\n\nHoward\n: Try to stay on topic, please.\n\n\nConners\n: Yeah, sure\u2026 Lily and I hit it off immediately and formed a secret spell when we were still kids. I don\u2019t know what our thought process was, but we basically linked our souls so that both of us could feel one another\u2019s emotions. If it were anyone else, that would have been idiotic, but after I met Lily\u2026 something changed.\n\n\nHoward\n: Changed how?\n\n\nConners\n: I don\u2019t remember a time before her. I don\u2019t remember who I talked to about my feelings or told shitty jokes to late at night. After a while, it felt less like we were a couple and more like we were one person. We shared thoughts, feelings, emotions, everything was broadcast between us. I\u2019m not saying we didn\u2019t have our rough patches. I mean our anger had a way of feeding each other. But the good far outweighed the bad\u2026\n\n\nHoward\n: Emily? The moment you knew something was wrong?\n\n\nConners\n: Yeah, sorry. Sometimes she\u2019d stub her toe or cut her finger and I\u2019d feel it. That\u2019s kinda what it felt like at first but much worse. I woke up one night feeling as if my heart was being ripped from my chest. It was intense, but not too out of the ordinary.\n\n\nHoward\n: The feeling of getting your heart ripped out wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary?\n\n\nConners\n: I felt the exact same thing when she watched \nReturn of the King\n. Even still, I decided to text her, just to make sure, ya know. Emily didn\u2019t respond, but this also wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary\u2014she\u2019d hyper-fixate on a case sometimes. I wasn\u2019t worried at that point.\n\n\nHoward\n: But this feeling persisted, and you didn\u2019t think to tell us then?\n\n\nConners\n: Are you kidding? Thaumaturgy isn't exactly the most welcomed branch in the Foundation. I figured if anyone found out about our little unsanctioned magical pact, that we'd get blacklisted immediately. I only came here because I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Maybe I should have come earlier. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nHoward\n: Okay, let's talk about the investigation\u2026\n\n\nConners\n: Yeah, okay\u2026 They thought that I\u2019d be helpful, since I had a direct link to her emotions.\n\n\nHoward\n: And were you?\n\n\nConners\n: Yeah\u2026 The pain would get stronger the closer we got to Lily. That being said, they probably would have found Utility without my help. They weren\u2019t a big or smart group. Left plenty of tracks and clues as to where they were holed up.\n\n\nHoward\n: But, even with your help, it took us two days to find them?\n\n\nConners\n: Yes, the night we arrived in Shelbyville I felt something change. I couldn\u2019t feel Lily anymore, but I could \nhear\n her. It was like she was talking over herself in my head, whispering and yelling over and over, \u201cNo more, no more, no more.\u201d At that exact same time it was like Utility vanished, no one had seen them and none of the members had made any purchases. This basically made tracking them impossible.\n\n\nHoward\n: So they skipped town when you arrived.\n\n\nConners\n: That was our guess.\n\n\nHoward\n: How did you find them?\n\n\nConners\n: Followed the voice in my head to the school, where we found out a couple of the members had been hanging out at a condemned gymnasium.\n\n\nConners\n: That\u2019s where we found Lily. When I\u2026\n\n\nConners takes a moment to let out a breath\n\n\nConners\n: When I opened the door I saw her standing there, transparent and grey. I ran to her but she turned away from me. She kept whispering those same fucking words, \u201cNo more, no more, no more.\u201d That had to be what she said to them right? She was begging them as they carved into her.\n\n\n[\nSparks manifest from Conners\u2019 hands, causing Howard to recoil.\n]\n\n\nConners\n: Sorry!\n\n\nHoward\n: It\u2019s fine, just try to keep a hold on that.\n\n\nConner\n: It\u2019s not that simple, it\u2019s tied to our emotions. It\u2019s like trying not to cry.\n\n\nHoward\n: Let\u2019s discuss her death. You watched the tapes, correct-\n\n\nConners\n: Death? What do you mean?\n\n\nHoward\n: Emily\u2026 You saw the ghost. Lily is gone.\n\n\nConners\n: Is that what they\u2019re fucking saying? That she\u2019s dead? I can still hear her, Howard. She\u2019s still in my head, yelling and whispering that phrase over and over and over. That spell was for life and it\u2019s still working!\n\n\nHoward\n: Emily, there\u2019s no way of knowing how that spell actually works. You two cooked it up as kids, you said so yourself.\n\n\nConners\n: Are they calling off the search?\n\n\nHoward\n: What is there to look for, Emily?\n\n\n[\nTen seconds of extraneous footage expunged\n]\n\n\nConners\n: You piece of shit! You motherfucker! You tell me who is heading this!\n\n\nHoward\n: I think we\u2019re done here.\n\n\nConners\n: She\u2019s not dead! She\u2019s not fucking dead!\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the interview, Emily Conners was granted two weeks' paid bereavement leave.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7580-B-2: VHS Tapes and Footage Recovered from Discovery Site\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0FILE:\u00a0RECOVERED\u00a0TAPES\u00a01-6\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0FILES\u00a01-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTape 1: An Introduction to the Utility Union\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(The video opens with copyright-free music playing over a backdrop of a grass field. A man is staring out at the field as text appears on screen saying, \u201cAn Introduction to the Utility Union with Bill Offer\u201d)\n\n\nOffer\n: \n(Turns to the camera)\n Oh sorry, I didn\u2019t see you there. Hi stranger, my name is Bill Offer, and I\u2019m here to ask you a question. How much good do you think there is in the world?\n\n\n(Stock footage of war, third world countries, and popular left leaning politicians cycle on screen as Offer talks in voiceover.)\n\n\nOffer\n: I don\u2019t know about you, but everywhere I look I see anything but good. Life has become a cycle of pain and injustice because we\u2019ve forgotten an important lesson, provided by previous great thinkers. \n(Offer appears on screen following a star wipe transition.)\n Utilitarianism!\n\n\n(A still image of John Stuart Mill appears on screen as Offer continues in voiceover)\n\n\nOffer\n: The originator of Utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham, described the idea as \n(The rustling of paper is audible)\n an ethical theory holding that actions are morally right if they tend to promote happiness or pleasure, and morally wrong if they tend to promote unhappiness or pain among all those affected by them.\n\n\n(A star wipe transition returns the viewer to a grass field)\n\n\nOffer\n: Now, them sure are a lotta big words but what do they mean exactly? Well, the way I like to look at it is that there\u2019s a balance in the universe between pleasure and suffering. It needs to be our duty to spread as much pleasure and goodness as possible, in order to make this world a better place. Unfortunately, there will always be those bad apples that spread far more suffering than we can ever counteract. It was a losing battle, until now.\n\n\n(A star wipe transition shows footage of known members of the Utility Union laughing together in a park as voiceover plays)\n\n\nOffer\n: The Utility Union has developed a method to fix these bad apples permanently. Using advances in spiritual healing, we can snip away the rotten parts of the human soul. Hatred, greed, jealousy, fear, and sadness can all be removed completely, leaving only the goodness in every person. With this, we can end suffering completely, and witness a brave new age for humanity.\n\n\n(Final shot shows Offer pointing at the camera)\n\n\nOffer\n: Find Utility in our Union.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTape 2: How to Snip a Soul\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(A flower covered backdrop fades in as somber music plays. Text appears on screen saying, \u201cHow to Snip a Soul with Bill Offer\u201d. An animated image of Offer appears on screen holding [REDACTED])\n\n\nOffer\n: The world of spiritual healing can be a confusing and unclear mess, but our goal with this educational video is to give you a crash course in soul snipping. Thanks to our discovery of [REDACTED], we\u2019ve developed a method to cut the negative attributes from a person\u2019s soul. Let\u2019s go over what you\u2019ll need. First and most importantly, you\u2019ll need to turn to page 57 of [REDACTED] where you\u2019ll find the exact words you\u2019ll need to say in order to enter a subject\u2019s soul. Next thing you\u2019ll need is a snipper. \n(An animated image of SCP-7580 appears on screen)\n We\u2019ll be using a knife in this series but you can use any object that\u2019s easy to picture in your mind. Lastly, you\u2019ll need a subject!\n\n\n(A star wipe transition shows the animated Offer sitting across from a featureless humanoid tied to a chair. The animated SCP-7580 sits on a table between them)\n\n\nOffer\n: Starting the process is simple. All you need to do is sit across the subject with the snipper between you. Once you\u2019re all set up, just read page 57 while picturing the snipper in your mind. If you\u2019ve done all that correctly\u2026\n\n\n(A star wipe transition shows the animated Offer in a black void with SCP-7580 in his hands.)\n\n\nOffer\n: You\u2019ll be in the soul-scape! The first thing you\u2019ll notice about this area is that you don\u2019t have a body. \n(Offer\u2019s body vanishes)\n That\u2019s right, while in the soul-scape you won\u2019t have a body, and the only way you\u2019ll be able to interact with your surroundings is by feeling. To traverse this place simply imagine yourself moving forward until you bump into something. If you\u2019ve ever stumbled to your car after a night of bar hopping, then go ahead and consider yourself an expert. After enough wandering you\u2019ll find one of your subject\u2019s soul fragments.\n\n\n(A misshapen mass appears next to Offer)\n\n\nOffer\n: Each fragment has a trait associated with it, such as happiness or sexual deviance. To identify the trait of a fragment, simply touch it and focus on what you feel. A happy fragment will show things that make you happy.\n\n\n(A star wipe transition shows a translucent Offer standing next to a soul fragment labeled \u201csadness\u201d. The fragment is connected to a similar fragment labeled \u201chappiness\u201d)\n\n\nOffer\n: When you encounter a negative fragment you\u2019ll need to use the image of the snipper to carve it free of the positive fragments. \n(A close up of SCP-7580 shows the knife stabbing into the edge of the \u201chappiness\u201d fragment)\n Be sure to carve into the neighboring positive fragments rather than the negative fragment itself, as small scraps left afterward can grow back given enough time. This process can take hours or even days depending on the size of the fragment, so be sure to pace yourself and most importantly have fun!\n\n\n(A hard cut shows Offer sitting in an arm chair.)\n\n\nOffer\n: Now, I was meant to end the video there but I thought I\u2019d take a moment to level with you. Now I\u2019m not blind, there\u2019s an obvious moral dilemma here. I mean, on paper, it seems like we\u2019re able to take away everything these people are. When you have doubts remember what we stand for. Spreading pleasure. These subjects do nothing but spread suffering with their deviances. We know what\u2019s best for them because we have a higher pleasure output. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re killing these people, just improving them. We\u2019re doing them a favor and they\u2019ll thank us, I know it.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTape 3: Acquiring Targets\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Opens with a handheld shot of a cabin believed to have been used by Lily Spurlock prior to her kidnapping. Text overlay displays the title, \u201cAcquiring Targets, a Demonstration\u201d.)\n\n\nOffer\n: \n(In voiceover)\n When finding a subject you intend to practice soul snipping on, it\u2019s important to have a list of their negative traits. This particular subject, Lily Spurlock, has displayed a great deal of hatred, lust, sadness, and sexual deviancy. Although, as our first subject, we will only be focusing on her hatred as it's most prevalent. Spurlock represents an organization dedicated to halting our goals, so we plan to extend an olive branch by improving her pleasure output.\n\n\n(Five figures lead the cameraman to the back of the house where a bathroom window is cracked open.)\n\n\nOffer\n: The moral dilemma is once again a possible issue, but Lily is a troubled person. She\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t understand the consequences her choices have. There are people out there that would kill her for what she is. What we\u2019re doing is a mercy. They are animals, but we are saviors to people like her.\n\n\n(The figures open the window and sneak into the house. They are shown walking upstairs to where Lily Spurlock is sleeping. The group surrounds the bed and the camera zooms on her face as they wait. Three minutes of silence pass before Spurlock slowly opens her eyes and sees the group. She screams as they descend upon her. A freeze-frame of her face occupies the screen.)\n\n\nOffer\n: It is important to note that subjects are dangerous when confronted with soul snipping. Negative traits will cause them to fight back. Lily in particular had a powerful connection to spiritual warfare, fueled by her hatred. Be careful when escorting potential subjects.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClip of Recovered Footage: Soul Snipping: Lily Spurlock-Session 1\n\n\n\n\n(The tape opens to a close up of Bill Offer\u2019s face as he sets up the camera. Unlike the other tapes, this one has received no editing.)\n\n\nOffer\n: Hello students, today is a very important moment for our Union. We have our very first subject here with us.\n\n\n(Offer backs away revealing Spurlock behind him in a setup resembling the one shown in \u201cHow to Snip a Soul\u201d. She is chained to a chair and thrashing in anger.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Jesus, fuck! Why am I here?\n\n\nOffer\n: I'm glad you asked, you see-\n\n\nSpurlock\n: \n(Attempts to jump at Offer but is restrained by the chains)\n Let me go! Let me out of here you motherfucker, I\u2019ll kill you!\n\n\nOffer\n: Listen, Lily. We are here to help you. This is meant to make you a better person.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Fuck you, Bill! I know exactly what you and your club are about! You don\u2019t have the resources to fight my people!\n\n\nOffer\n: As you can see her hatred is on full display.\n\n\n(Offer sits across from Spurlock and opens [REDACTED] on the table between them. SCP-7580 resides next to it, stabbed into the center.)\n\n\nOffer\n: You have us all wrong, we don\u2019t wish to fight the Foundation. Our only goal is to send you back as a better person. You should be thanking me.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Ah yeah, I\u2019m so happy about the current situation. Why don\u2019t you remove these chains so that I can show you how thankful I am?\n\n\nOffer\n: Ha, you got a fire in you kid. It drives you forward and keeps you going. But that fire is dangerous, that driving force makes you selfish. You\u2019re focused too much on what gives you pleasure and not what gives the world pleasure. A morally good person would push these negative traits away for the greater good. But you\u2019re young, you need help. I get it. Let me help you.\n\n\n(Offer recites a passage from [REDACTED] before his eyes burn a bright pink and his body falls limp. Spurlock then writhes in pain for 42 minutes. She says many things that all amount to her begging Offer to \u201cget out of her head\u201d. Mostly though, she whispers \u201cno more\u201d to herself until the 42-minute mark. Eventually, Offer moves and Spurlock stops screaming)\n\n\nOffer\n: Gentlemen, I believe we can call this session a success.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClip of Recovered Footage: Post Session 1 Interview-Lily Spurlock\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(The video opens on Spurlock who appears confused and in pain. An off camera voice asks her questions.)\n\n\nOffer\n: Please state your name for the camera.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: What\u2026 What did you do? I feel light.\n\n\nOffer\n: Your name, for the camera.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: You need to let me leave. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t feel good. I think\u2026 something is wrong with me?\n\n\nOffer\n: We will, but first you have to state your name for the camera.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: \u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you. You know that, right? No matter what happens after this moment, you're going to die. You fucking animals, I'll kill every\u2026 All of you\u2026 I'm gonna\u2026 Why did I say that?\n\n\nOffer\n: Did you see that? She broke. She lost touch with her hatred for a moment, we\u2019re close I can feel it.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Let me go. I won\u2019t tell anyone. We can fix this but you'll have to cut me loose, okay? I just want to go back home to Emily. I can\u2019t keep doing this. That was awful.\n\n\nOffer\n: Describe your experience.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: I felt something cold inside of me. It's not easy to put into words. Like a memory was bleeding. It was like something in my chest was being ripped out. It was messy and inexperienced. Like a child conducting a surgery. \n(Chuckles)\n You\u2019re pathetic.\n\n\nOffer\n: Have you experienced a change in mood since the operation?\n\n\nSpurlock\n: You could say that\u2026 What does that mean? There are strings? Loose thoughts\u2026 Images, the blood\u2026 I can\u2019t have conceived this. That\u2019s not me\u2026 It's you. It will be you. All of you. No more. No. More.\n\n\nOffer\n: We\u2019re not getting anything out of her. It\u2019s incoherent babble. Just shut it off-\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Wait\u2026 Why are you doing this? What are you doing?\n\n\nOffer\n: Like I said, we\u2019re trying to help you\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Yes, \u201cas you\u2019ve said\u201d. But what does that mean?\n\n\nOffer\n: We\u2019ve been watching you, studying your traits. Quite the temper you have\u2026\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Heh, well in my line of work you\u2019d be surprised how much that helps.\n\n\nOffer\n: Helps you what? Hurt people? Lock them up in cells?\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Protect people.\n\n\nOffer\n: Your hatred is a tool for violence and we\u2019re cutting it free. Because \nwe\n are protecting people.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Yeah? Anything else you wanna cut free, Bill? There anything in particular about me that you wish you could remove? I know you, this suffering/pleasure bullshit is just an excuse for you to-\n\n\nOffer\n: Sexual deviancy is a doorway to aggression, which causes suffering. People do not share the same world view as you, and you need to understand that.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: That\u2019s fucking \nrich\n coming from you.\n\n\nOffer\n: You can\u2019t see it now because you\u2019re still in touch with these negative traits, but we\u2019re bringing pleasure to the world.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Uh huh. Look at me, Bill. Do I look like I\u2019m enjoying myself? Am I drowning in pleasure?\n\n\n(Offer crosses the room and places a hand on Spurlock\u2019s shoulder)\n\n\nOffer\n: You can\u2019t see it now but we are making you a better person.

I\u2019ll be a shadow\u2026 Light as air\u2026 A single fragment\u2026 Up in the clouds\u2026 I don\u2019t know what will happen to me after that.\n\n\nOffer\n: Let\u2019s cut it.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Bill?\n\n\nOffer\n: Yes?\n\n\nSpurlock\n: I lied. When you asked me how it felt. I lied. I used to feel like that. But this time I didn\u2019t. When you were in my head, I didn\u2019t feel anything. Why didn\u2019t I feel anything?\n\n\nOffer\n: There\u2019s no need to worry. This is good news. You\u2019re realizing you don\u2019t need that piece of you. You\u2019re becoming a better person.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Heh\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like a better person.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7580-FU: LIAR\n\n\n(Automated Notice: The following edits have been made by\n \nFHoward_12\n. \nIf you believe these changes to be unauthorized, please report the issue to RAISA immediately.)\n\n\nHello, whoever you are. I\u2019ll have to assume you\u2019re the one in charge and not just some assistant told to edit the document before it\u2019s published. I'll be talking to you as if you're the one, anyway. So if you think this is for someone else, go ahead and forward it to them now.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know you or how to find you, but you should know who I am. I don\u2019t expect to hide my actions from you, but I do expect you to listen. Two weeks ago, you told me that the love of my life died brutally to a cult of backwater nobodies. I was told that the only thing remaining was a ghost attached to a knife. I was told to take a few days off to mourn my loss. I was told lies.\n\n\nThere were a few clues, none by any fault of your own. No, you were very thorough. Even still, there were a few things out of your control. Despite her apparent death, I could still hear her voice in my head. Those words. No more, no more, no more. This shouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\n\nYou provided plenty of solutions that could be true. It was a spell I did as a kid, couldn\u2019t be sure it worked perfectly. After the interview, I was told that the link might not have accounted for a ghost. My favorite was that the voice might have been a psychological issue, all in my head. Howard even referred me to a therapist.\n\n\nIt was a good plan, but I think Howard was what made it fall apart. It\u2019s amazing the Foundation employed such a bad liar. I knew he was keeping things from me, but it was just a hunch until I snatched his folder during the interview. I got a look at this draft, just a peek, but it was enough to see the object class.\n\n\nKeter.\n\n\nThat ghost isn\u2019t able to travel five feet from the knife. Why is it listed as keter? This only confirmed what I suspected. Someone (that's you) was lying to me. I doubt Howard even noticed I took his clearance badge. Seriously, you need to hire better.\n\n\nThat badge has gotten me pretty far. It's how I'm able to edit this document and talk to you right now. But at first, I didn't edit the document. I just read it only to find the beautiful tale you used to cover up the truth. A story of a poor agent who met a terrible fate. It was completely believable, but there was one thing that stood out to me. It said no body was recovered from the gym. That\u2019s not what Howard told me. You \"expunged the extraneous footage\" but I heard what he said, \u201cWhat is there to look for, Emily? We found the body.\u201d\n\n\nAgain. Bad liar.\n\n\nIt took some digging, but I did eventually find what you neglected to put in the document. I had to go back to Shelbyville and flash the badge to get it but now it\u2019s in my hands. The 7th bit of recovered footage. I\u2019ll link it here since you obviously forgot.\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re\u00a0Welcome\n\n\n\n\nAsshole\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClip of Recovered Footage: Post Session 27 Interview-Lily Spurlock\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(The tape opens with Spurlock hanging her head, her face obstructed by her hair. She is still chained to her chair)\n\n\nOffer\n: Please state your name for the camera.\n\n\n(Spurlock doesn\u2019t answer.)\n\n\nOffer\n: This is an interview following your 27th session, correct?\n\n\n(Spurlock doesn\u2019t answer.)\n\n\nOffer\n: How would you describe your experience during the session?\n\n\n(Spurlock doesn\u2019t answer.)\n\n\nOffer\n: Look, the session was a success, but we can\u2019t let you leave until-\n\n\n(Spurlock\u2019s hand moves, and no audible noise is heard for twenty seconds)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: State your name for the camera.\n\n\nOffer\n: Worm. I\u2019m a worm chewing on the corpse of ideas thought up by greater men.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Good, this is an interview preceding our 1st session, correct?\n\n\nOffer\n: Yes.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: How would you describe your experience during this session?\n\n\nOffer\n: I will feel torment dwarfing the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Every nerve in my body will know to suffer until they are broken and fall away. Every cell in my body will be ruptured till they are broken and fall away. Once only my soul remains it will be stripped of any joy or purpose reducing my memories to an endless journey of agony and despair. Once nothing of me remains I will be remade only to do it again and again and again.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Will you experience a change in mood following the session?\n\n\nOffer\n: Yes.\n\n\n(Offer is heard weeping.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Can you go into more detail?\n\n\nOffer\n: I will never know peace again. I will be a vessel for pain and suffering.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: Very good.\n\n\n(Extraneous footage removed.)\n\n\nOffer\n: Something is wrong. I did exactly as it said, but something went wrong. The shade attached to the knife displays no attributes that I\u2019d associate with hatred. Lily herself though\u2026 I can\u2019t see in there. I can only feel what I\u2019m cutting and somehow it never occurred to me that I didn\u2019t know what I was cutting away and what was being left behind\u2026 I think I messed up. She used her hatred to perform spells, and now I might have taken away the only thing holding her back. We were prepared for her abilities before, but now, with no suppressor, she could do anything. The doors are locked for some reason so we can\u2019t leave. I just want to go home to Mary.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should have stopped there. I got my answers and I should have stopped there. But I didn\u2019t and you won't either. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen it in person before. Don\u2019t worry. I recorded it there just to show you.\n\n\n\n\nDo\u00a0You\u00a0Even\u00a0Care?\n\n\n\n\nMonster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7580-2: Lily Conners\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Footage opens with a shot of the abandoned gym. The camera is focused on the back corner where the doorway to the locker rooms can be seen. Conners can be heard breathing heavily as she walks forward)\n\n\nConners\n: It\u2019s still her. No matter what, it\u2019s still her.\n\n\n(Conners enters the locker room and upon doing so the sound of muffled screams becomes audible. Upon hearing this, Conners\u2019 breath becomes shaky.)\n\n\nConners\n: Come on\u2026 where are you\u2026\n\n\n(Conners investigates the room and uncovers a door behind the lockers. This door should lead outside as the wall it\u2019s connecting to neighbors no other rooms. However, when Conners opens the door it reveals a tunnel leading down.)\n\n\nConners\n: Oh, fuck me. Okay, it\u2019s dark. Flashlight should be right\u2026 \n(The camera\u2019s flashlight illuminates the tunnel for a few feet, showing it to be made of a reflective, silver stone.)\n There, got it.\n\n\n(Conners steps into the tunnel and the sound of screaming immediately amplifies. Conners stops for a moment.)\n\n\nConners\n: Okay. Okay. \n(Exhales deeply.)\n I\u2019m coming, Lily.\n\n\n(Conners continues down the tunnel for 3 minutes uninterrupted. Eventually she stops and points the camera at the ground.)\n\n\nConners\n: I thought that maybe these were just weird rock formations, but there\u2019s no denying \nthat\n.\n\n\n(Conners points the camera to the cave wall revealing the face of Bill Offer carved into the surface. He appears to be screaming.)\n\n\nConners\n: That\u2019s a face. Is she carving these every time she\u2026\n\n\nWindham\n: Please\u2026\n\n\nConners\n: \n(Points the camera at the ceiling where a man is hanging, suspended by three pocket knives driven into his wrists and feet.)\n Jesus! Tyler? Tyler Windham?\n\n\nWindham\n: I might have been\u2026 I don\u2019t remember\u2026 Please, you have to help me. I-\n\n\n(Windham\u2019s abdomen begins to expand and the outline of pocket knives can be seen protruding from his skin.)\n\n\nConners\n: Jesus, fuck!\n\n\nWindham\n: No! It hurts! It hurts! Please, you have to kill me! Don\u2019t leave me like this!\n\n\nConners\n: I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\n\n\n(Conners runs down the tunnel. Windham\u2019s screams are audible for another 70 seconds before a popping sound is heard and the screaming ends. Conners continues forward for another 3 minutes. As she walks, the faces in the wall become more frequent. Conners eventually turns a corner to see the faces lining the entirety of the walls. Conners makes it to the end where a metal door is visible.)\n\n\nConners\n: Remember. No matter what, it\u2019s still her.\n\n\n(Conners opens the door and the camera is immediately blinded by a light shining from within the chamber. As the camera adjusts, the light is revealed to be a large fire. Seven figures can be seen within the flames and one is visible above them. The camera adjusts completely and reveals a dome shaped room with the Utility Union at the bottom and Spurlock floating upside down from the ceiling. Spurlock is still chained to her chair and appears to be speaking, but her words are not audible due to the screaming of Utility Union.)\n\n\nConners\n: Oh, Christ.\n\n\n(As Utility Union burns, blisters begin to appear on their bodies. These blisters grow to impossibly large sizes, causing them to fall over. Eventually, they pop revealing dozens of pocket knives protruding from within their flesh. Conners is heard gagging as this happens. After 5 minutes, the Utility Union are completely gone, replaced by piles of meat and knives. Immediately after, they reappear in what seems to be healthy condition.)\n\n\nOffer\n: No more! Please! I can\u2019t take it. We\u2019re sorry, I swear we are. We will never do anything like this again. You have my word. We\u2019ve suffered and died enough, haven\u2019t we? Hasn\u2019t this been enough?\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More.\n\n\n(Fire manifests around Utility Union again as they begin to auto-cannibalize, their teeth having been shifted to pocket knives in their mouths.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\n(Conners places the camera on the ground and runs to the edge of the fire, looking up at Spurlock.)\n\n\nConners\n: Hey Lily. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Emily. I\u2019m here. I found you.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\nConners\n: Lily, it\u2019s time to go home. You need to come down from there so we can get you back home.\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\nConners\n: You remember home right? Apollo misses you. That cat always loved you the most\u2026 I miss you\u2026.\n\n\n(Utility Union can be seen choking as their throats develop growths that enlarge into knife blades.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\nConners\n: \n(Can be seen crying.)\n Lily, can you look at me?\n\n\n(Utility Union can be seen stabbing into their abdomen and removing their organs.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\nConners\n: Lily, I need you to look at me.\n\n\n(Utility Union can be seen crying out as their bones snap and knives protrude from the fracture points.)\n\n\nSpurlock\n: No. More. No. More. No. More.\n\n\nConners\n: God damn it! Look at me!\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe footage ends there, but I tried for hours to help. I knew she\u2019d never leave, but I loved her too much to leave. Not that you'd understand that. But she doesn't love me. She barely even remembers me. They took all of that from her, there's nothing left. Just rage.\n\n\nSo that\u2019s how you plan to leave her? Half of Lily is tortured and lacks the driving force to push past her trauma, while the other half is too full of hatred to ever want to move on.\n\n\nI can\u2019t even begin to describe the hatred I feel for you. But in all honesty I\u2019m more confused. Why are you doing this? Why do you keep Lily in that state? Why are you trying to cover it up? Surely this isn\u2019t the easiest solution, leaving a reality bender free to kill these people forever. I just can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re letting this happen. It almost feels malicious.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ignorant to what I\u2019ve done and the consequences I\u2019ll see. I\u2019ve broken enough site regulations to put me in an orange jumpsuit, if I\u2019m lucky. What I\u2019m saying is, I know you\u2019ll come for me. You have no reason not to. But before you kill me, or erase my mind, or whatever, please do one thing for me. If there\u2019s any scrap of kindness or decency inside you, please grant my last wish. Tell me why.\n\n\nWhy won\u2019t you put Lily back together?\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Senior Researcher Regan Morgan believes SCP-7580 could prove useful against SCP-7570-1\n\n\n2\n.

        "Addendum 7580-A-1: Discovery\nThe Foundation discovered SCP-7580 following a report made by Spurlock\u2019s significant other and Foundation employee, Emily Conners. Conners claimed that Agent Spurlock had not been in contact for the past five days, and had grown concerned that she was in danger. Foundation investigators discovered that Agent Spurlock had neglected to update her supervisors during her own investigation of a small GoI known as \u201cUtility Union\u201d. Spurlock was apparently known to take long breaks between updates, so it wasn\u2019t considered an issue.\nThe Foundation launched an investigation with Conners acting as an advisor. Following a 2-day search, SCP-7580 was discovered alongside several VHS tapes documenting Spurlock\u2019s torture 2 . A thorough examination of the scene concluded Lily Spurlock was dead, although no body was recovered. The seven members of the Utility Union have not been found.",

        "Interviewer: Doctor Frank Howard Interviewee: Emily Conners [BEGIN LOG] Howard : You sure you\u2019re up for this? We can wait a few days. Conners : What\u2019s gonna change in a few days, Frank? Howard : Fair enough. Why don\u2019t we start from the moment you realized something was wrong and we go from there? Conners : Yeah, okay. I felt\u2026 no. God, how do I explain this\u2026 Howard : Just start from the beginning. Conners : Okay. Lily and I both came from similar places, ya know. Our parents were Foundation thaumaturges and, despite their best efforts, we became mages just like them. There was a time that the Foundation would've just fried the knowledge from our brains, but resources have been so scarce the past decade. One thing led to another and bam, we were employed instead. Lily and I were in the same training camp and- (chuckles) that\u2019s how we met. Actually funny story, one time- Howard : Try to stay on topic, please. Conners : Yeah, sure\u2026 Lily and I hit it off immediately and formed a secret spell when we were still kids. I don\u2019t know what our thought process was, but we basically linked our souls so that both of us could feel one another\u2019s emotions. If it were anyone else, that would have been idiotic, but after I met Lily\u2026 something changed. Howard : Changed how? Conners : I don\u2019t remember a time before her. I don\u2019t remember who I talked to about my feelings or told shitty jokes to late at night. After a while, it felt less like we were a couple and more like we were one person. We shared thoughts, feelings, emotions, everything was broadcast between us. I\u2019m not saying we didn\u2019t have our rough patches. I mean our anger had a way of feeding each other. But the good far outweighed the bad\u2026 Howard : Emily? The moment you knew something was wrong? Conners : Yeah, sorry. Sometimes she\u2019d stub her toe or cut her finger and I\u2019d feel it. That\u2019s kinda what it felt like at first but much worse. I woke up one night feeling as if my heart was being ripped from my chest. It was intense, but not too out of the ordinary. Howard : The feeling of getting your heart ripped out wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary? Conners : I felt the exact same thing when she watched Return of the King . Even still, I decided to text her, just to make sure, ya know. Emily didn\u2019t respond, but this also wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary\u2014she\u2019d hyper-fixate on a case sometimes. I wasn\u2019t worried at that point. Howard : But this feeling persisted, and you didn\u2019t think to tell us then? Conners : Are you kidding? Thaumaturgy isn't exactly the most welcomed branch in the Foundation. I figured if anyone found out about our little unsanctioned magical pact, that we'd get blacklisted immediately. I only came here because I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Maybe I should have come earlier. I don\u2019t know. Howard : Okay, let's talk about the investigation\u2026 Conners : Yeah, okay\u2026 They thought that I\u2019d be helpful, since I had a direct link to her emotions. Howard : And were you? Conners : Yeah\u2026 The pain would get stronger the closer we got to Lily. That being said, they probably would have found Utility without my help. They weren\u2019t a big or smart group. Left plenty of tracks and clues as to where they were holed up. Howard : But, even with your help, it took us two days to find them? Conners : Yes, the night we arrived in Shelbyville I felt something change. I couldn\u2019t feel Lily anymore, but I could hear her. It was like she was talking over herself in my head, whispering and yelling over and over, \u201cNo more, no more, no more.\u201d At that exact same time it was like Utility vanished, no one had seen them and none of the members had made any purchases. This basically made tracking them impossible. Howard : So they skipped town when you arrived. Conners : That was our guess. Howard : How did you find them? Conners : Followed the voice in my head to the school, where we found out a couple of the members had been hanging out at a condemned gymnasium. Conners : That\u2019s where we found Lily. When I\u2026 Conners takes a moment to let out a breath Conners : When I opened the door I saw her standing there, transparent and grey. I ran to her but she turned away from me. She kept whispering those same fucking words, \u201cNo more, no more, no more.\u201d That had to be what she said to them right? She was begging them as they carved into her. [ Sparks manifest from Conners\u2019 hands, causing Howard to recoil. ] Conners : Sorry! Howard : It\u2019s fine, just try to keep a hold on that. Conner : It\u2019s not that simple, it\u2019s tied to our emotions. It\u2019s like trying not to cry. Howard : Let\u2019s discuss her death. You watched the tapes, correct- Conners : Death? What do you mean? Howard : Emily\u2026 You saw the ghost. Lily is gone. Conners : Is that what they\u2019re fucking saying? That she\u2019s dead? I can still hear her, Howard. She\u2019s still in my head, yelling and whispering that phrase over and over and over. That spell was for life and it\u2019s still working! Howard : Emily, there\u2019s no way of knowing how that spell actually works. You two cooked it up as kids, you said so yourself. Conners : Are they calling off the search? Howard : What is there to look for, Emily? [ Ten seconds of extraneous footage expunged ] Conners : You piece of shit! You motherfucker! You tell me who is heading this! Howard : I think we\u2019re done here. Conners : She\u2019s not dead! She\u2019s not fucking dead! [END LOG]",
