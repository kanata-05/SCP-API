In the event that an extant instance of SCP-1558 is found, Mobile Task Force Rho-14 (\u201cSignal Crawlers\u201d) will be activated to return SCP-1558 to a Foundation-controlled BTS.\n\n\nSCP-1558-2 is to be kept at all times in a standard server room in Site 76. Access to SCP-1558-2 is limited to Level 2 personnel or above. In the event of I/O activity on SCP-1558-2\u2019s attached hard drive, the current Site 76 Director will be automatically notified.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1558 is an anomalous cellular network antenna, designed for compatibility with the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 network standard.\n\n\nSCP-1558 has the capability of \u2018intercepting\u2019 telephone calls placed through its transceiver stations and covertly replacing the audio of said calls. All calls known to be intercepted to date have fit the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\nThe call must be placed by an individual in a vehicle traveling 65\u00a0km/h or greater.\n\n\nThe intended recipient of the call must have a close personal relationship with the caller. The method by which this relationship is detected is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1558\u2019s substituted audio exhibits similar characteristics in every recorded instance: A two-person interaction involving a deep male voice (SCP-1558-1) and a perfect replica of the voice of the intended recipient of the call. The substituted audio demonstrates an awareness of the caller\u2019s circumstances and relationship with the intended recipient. In each instance, SCP-1558-1 will claim to have the intended recipient of the call held at gunpoint, and will threaten to kill them unless the caller causes the vehicle they inhabit to crash. The call is not connected to the intended recipient in any way.\n\n\nAt least \u2588\u2588 vehicular crashes, \u2588 small aircraft crashes and the crash of US Airways Flight \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (whose mid-flight intervention by the Foundation led to the discovery of SCP-1558) are known to have been caused by SCP-1558, totaling \u2588\u2588 casualties.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-1558-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-1558-2\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1558-2 is a standard, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-brand 1U rack server. Upon the completion of a SCP-1558 intercepted call, a recorded audio file of said call is downloaded to SCP-1558-2\u2019s hard drive at the next time SCP-1558-2 has internet access and power. The attached hard drive contains \u2588\u2588 audio files as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, currently encompassing all known SCP-1558 events.\n\n\nSCP-1558-2 was recovered from the home of F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 42, a cell systems engineer from Utica, New York, United States. D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had recently served a 10-year prison sentence for possession and distribution of \u2018snuff films\u2019 depicting vehicular homicides, and was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound upon discovery by Foundation operatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript\u00a01558-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-32\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Transcript\u00a01558-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial transcript of SCP-1558 event.
