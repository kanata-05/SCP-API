It\u2019s a play. I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+29\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on the production\n\n\n\n\nFor the technical team attempting to stage Jackie And Wilson, consider a minimalistic set to convey the multiple locations and the arcane nature of the setting. I have seen productions attempt to oversell it\u2014furniture in the walls and ceiling, fancy runework, etc.\u2014and they unilaterally fail to understand the point. I hope, dear reader, you do not make that same misjudgement. For the lighting, the task will be herculean. I ask you give the first scene a red colour-scheme, the second a yellow colour-scheme, and the third scene a total white washout. Fortunately, you will not be involved with the lighting of scene four.\n\n\nI ask you to decide yourself how long the breaks between each scene is. Breaks might be days, months, or no time at all. Such is the nature of time down here. To the actors, do better than me. Be what I couldn\u2019t. Alright, I\u2019ll let you get onto the play now.\n\n\nThis, my blood, it is the Hanged King\u2019s.\n\n\nSetting\n\nVarious, Alagadda\n\n\nTime\n\nA crucial little while\n\n\nCharacters\n\nJACKIE - Older, a notable performer in the city.\n\n\nWILSON - Younger, a newcomer and a nobody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nRed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A booth in a quiet corner at a party. Alagadda. The hum and noise rings at the periphery, but it\u2019s marginally quieter here. Lights come up on JACKIE, well dressed and with a gravity around her. Everything about her is measured. She lights a cigarette, glancing around. She wears a particularly ornate theatrical mask, it\u2019s not hers. WILSON enters, a disturbance. His clothes are disorderly, and his mask is cracked. He has a bag around his shoulder. For a moment, JACKIE doesn\u2019t notice him.)\n\n\nWILSON: Hey, can I\u2026?\n\n\nJACKIE: Don\u2019t let me stop you.\n\n\nWILSON: Alright, thanks. \n(He sits down. Long silence.)\n What do you dream about?\n\n\nJACKIE: That\u2019s a new one, aren\u2019t you going to ask my name first?\n\n\nWILSON: I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m serious. \n(Beat.)\n Your name wouldn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n\nJACKIE: Jacqueline\u2026Jackie. I work a few streets up, in the Mirth hall. Your turn.\n\n\nWILSON: Wilson. The Mirth, damn! Why do you smoke? I mean, there\u2019s worse things you could be doing here, and no one\u2019d mind.\n\n\nJACKIE: You\u2019d get it if you smoked. Liquid death. It\u2019s like a fire is breathed into you\u2026it\u2019s a bit like love, in a twisted kind of way. It\u2019s victory-\n\n\nWILSON: I thought you said it was death.\n\n\nJACKIE: It can be both. I couldn't care less about whatever they\u2019re smoking out there.\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah. Yeah. So, wait, you\u2019re an actor?\n\n\nJACKIE: Ensemble.\n\n\nWILSON: Well, damn, I\u2019m in the presence of a celebrity! Heh.\n\n\nJACKIE: And what do you do? No one comes here not to do \nsomething.\n\n\nWILSON: I write. Or, I\u2019m- uh, starting to write. I\u2019ve got a manuscript I\u2019ve drafted and\u2026\n\n\n(He hastily retrieves a stapled paper manuscript from his bag, and sets it on the table.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Plays or novels.\n\n\nWILSON: Huh?\n\n\nJACKIE: Which?\n\n\nWILSON: Plays.\n\n\nJACKIE: Good. Are you new to the Red Court?\n\n\nWILSON: \u2026Yeah.\n\n\nJACKIE: Me too, relatively speaking. But it pays at the Mirth, puts you in front of a crowd, as it were.\n\n\nWILSON: Christ, the things I\u2019d do. I\u2019m prepared to give a lot.\n\n\nJACKIE: I mean, clearly. Your\u2026your mask?\n\n\nWILSON: Oh, right. Yeah, I guess so.\n\n\nJACKIE How does that even happen? Forgive me if I'm overstepping.\n\n\nWILSON: I got kicked out of a few places, gave a few notes unsolicited. Plugged the play to the wrong executive, you know how it is.\n\n\nJACKIE: I'm not totally sure I do but sure. I suppose you asked a few girls what their \"big dreams\" are too.\n\n\nWILSON: No, absolutely not! \n(Beat.)\n This is me kinda' out on a limb, actually.\n\n\nJACKIE: Really? What do you do with the rest of your time, then?\n\n\nWILSON: Um\u2026oh! I go out on these long walks, let the fog and the noise kind of subsume me, and just drift off. Looking for answers, I guess. Looking for myself. I have terribly vivid dreams, and I\u2019ll just talk to myself. The passersby must think I'm a mad man. It's how I let it all out, I guess. \n(He begins to trail off.)\n Something about the feeling of the mask, and these clothes, and the way the city contorts in on itself\u2014 and the colors, and the\u2026\n\n\n(JACKIE leans in.)\n\n\nJACKIE, \nsnapping him out of it\n: Are you who you say you are?\n\n\nWILSON: Does it matter?\n\n\n(She smiles.)\n\n\nJACKIE: I think this is what I dream about, Wilson. Just this, forever. To be\u2026somewhere else. Even these grimy old couches in this grimy old manor. I dream about being not of this world.\n\n\nWILSON: I was gonna say the same thing.\n\n\nJACKIE, \nlaughing\n: No you were not.\n\n\nWILSON: I absolutely was!\n\n\n(She takes the manuscript - his play - off the table, and turns to leave.)\n\n\nWILSON: So- wow, you\u2019ll read it?\n\n\nJACKIE: I\u2019m not a real celebrity, Will. I get by as a B-lister, you\u2019ll know where to find me. \n(She goes to exit.)\n\n\nWILSON: I wasn\u2019t going to say that. \n(JACKIE stops and turns to him.)\n Your dream? It\u2019s probably better than mine, so I wanted to have said it but, uh, I didn\u2019t- I wasn\u2019t going to. When I dream, closing my eyes and fading away, I dream of being free. Free to start a fire, free to love and let love. Free to create, which is all I do these days. Where we aren\u2019t slaves to the world, the world is subordinate to \nus.\n Or better yet, the world is a big white blob and we color it by just being. So, that\u2019s what I dream. It never woulda\u2019 left my conscience otherwise.\n\n\n(Long silence, looking at one another. JACKIE turns away again to exit. Lights go down, actors prepare for Scene 2.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Jackie\u2019s apartment. It\u2019s well furnished and organized, maybe too much so. Like no one lives there. There\u2019s a couch in the center of the room, a table in front of it, shelves of books, a desk at L, and a cozy atmosphere. The desk has a phonograph on it, and the bookshelf has a section of records. WILSON\u2019s play is strewn on the desk. JACKIE is sitting on the couch, noticeably more relaxed than in scene 1. Her mask is less extravagant, it\u2019s now elegant and minimalistic. Her nails are painted black. There\u2019s a knock at the door, and she opens it to greet WILSON. The cracks in his mask have been filled in with an off-color caulk. He has freshened up somewhat externally, but there are bags under his eyes. He\u2019s beaming, and moves with an excited air)\n\n\nJACKIE: Hello again! Come on in, come in. Take a seat.\n\n\nWILSON: Hi! Uh- Alright, right. \n(He sits on the couch, she sits next to him)\n\n\nJACKIE: So, how are you, welcome.\n\n\nWILSON: Oh, thank you for having me on such short notice, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m great, actually. Or better than I was.\n\n\nJACKIE: That\u2019s good to hear, that\u2019s good. Is that why you\u2019re here?\n\n\nWILSON: Heh, yeah. I\u2019m not particularly slick, then.\n\n\nJACKIE: Not really, no.\n\n\nWILSON: OK, Ok, I\u2026Ok, um, I\u2026I GOT BOOKED!\n\n\nJACKIE, \ngenuinely happy\n: Will, that\u2019s great! Where?\n\n\nWILSON: In the reds, one of the outer circuit theatres, I forget the name. But they\u2019re gonna\u2019 shop it.\n\n\nJACKIE: Good work\u2014 Wait, I\u2019ll go get drinks. Let\u2019s celebrate, shall we?\n\n\nWILSON: Uh\u2026Ah, go on then. We\u2019re stars, you and I! Shit!\n\n\n(JACKIE retrieves a decanter of whisky and two tumblers, setting them on the table and sitting back down. She pours them out)\n\n\nWILSON, \nlifting his glass\n: Here\u2019s to art, and our success!\n\n\nJACKIE: And to all that we give for them.\n\n\n(They toast.)\n\n\nWILSON: GOD! I could run a marathon, Jack, or go to the Virtue Hall, or, uh, I don\u2019t know. Hey, wait, can I try something?\n\n\nJACKIE: OK, shoot.\n\n\nWILSON: Can you give me, um\u2026give me your best \u201cupset look.\u201d\n\n\n(JACKIE does so. It\u2019s pretty good. WILSON examines from a few angles.)\n\n\nWILSON: Alright, cool. Now, give me, like, \u201churt and shocked.\u201d \n(She does so, he inspects)\n OK, could you make it a bit more subtle? \n(She does)\n Alright, good. Awesome. You\u2019re giving me lots of ideas.\n\n\nJACKIE, \nplaying along\n: What was that all for? Like, which\u2013\n\n\n(He looks to deflect, and notices the phonograph)\n\n\nWILSON: Ooh, let me put some music on. \n(He gets up. Beat.)\n Where are the records?\n\n\nJACKIE: Over\u2026there. On the shelf. \n(He starts rifling through them, mumbling)\n\n\nWILSON: Um, huh. Is this all classical?\n\n\nJACKIE: There should be jazz? Keep looking, I\u2019d say.\n\n\nWILSON: Oh, yeah, nice. \n(He takes a record and walks to the desk, removing it from its casing. He notices his play on the desk)\n So what\u2019s been happening with you?\n\n\nJACKIE: It\u2019s been good. The show got an extension, so I\u2019m still in business. My face stays in the paper, as it were.\n\n\n(Beat.)\n\n\nWILSON: Oh yeah that\u2019s, that\u2019s good. OK, there. \n(The record starts playing smooth jazz. WILSON starts humming along, snapping in time and dancing over to the couch)\n Come on, up \u2018ya get.\n\n\nJACKIE, \nlaughing\n: No. No way.\n\n\nWILSON: COME ON!\n\n\n(He pulls her up off the couch despite her protests. They start apart, as JACKIE begins to feel the music. She dances better than him. Eventually, they pull into one another and slow dance. There\u2019s a burst of excitement, he spins her, she spins him, and they turn the room in their jilted dance. Finally they break out, laughing, and landing back on the couch)\n\n\nJACKIE: Christ, Will, no more of that, we\u2019ll break something.\n\n\nWILSON: Look at some of this stuff. Who\u2019ll miss it! Sorry, that\u2019s\u2026that comes off rude, I don\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019m easily set off these days. But all these books, who\u2019s read \u2018em? Who has the time?\n\n\nJACKIE: They\u2019re plays. Classic plays.\n\n\nWILSON: Right, so old plays, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. If I had a button in front of me that deleted every old play \n(he looks over at her)\n\u2026well, I\u2019d hesitate.\n\n\nJACKIE: That\u2019s reductive, I think. Fashion keeps changing, but our nature doesn\u2019t. We always come back here. \n(Long silence.)\n When I picture a world ideal, Wilson, do you know what I see? It\u2019s a world where the sun rises and everything is equal, and your breath and mine get in-sync, and our veins mix in and we can all sink into one another. One heart, one nature. \n(She takes his hand)\n Like waves on the beach, folding back from whence they came. Like the tiger eats the gazelle, but it isn\u2019t truly lost. Like poetry. I wish the world was poetry\u2026\n\n\nWILSON: Huh. I think I see a world that\u2019s loud. A huge ball of static, the harsh wind of this mountain we\u2019re climbing. Maybe the world would just be a giant mountain range, it keeps getting bigger forever, ya\u2019 know? \n(They get closer)\n And in this world of mountains I\u2019m making, I imagine everyone, even the birds, have to climb fair and square. It\u2019s good because, once you scale your mountain, the winds against you in the pit of the night, and the next comes into view\u2026you\u2019d see the sunrise on the horizon behind it.\n\n\nJACKIE: You really know how to trail off.\n\n\nWILSON: Heh. It\u2019s as easy as lying. \n(He reaches for the decanter)\n\n\nJACKIE: Hey, slow it down.\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah. Yeah, sorry. There\u2019s just\u2014 There\u2019s a lot of edge I\u2019m tryna\u2019 take off.\n\n\n(Long silence.)\n\n\nJACKIE: So\u2026your play, how much are they changing?\n\n\nWILSON: What?\n\n\nJACKIE: Well, it\u2019s hardly going to stay the same. It\u2019s too open for the Mirth, and it\u2019s too big for anything else on the red circuit-\n\n\nWILSON: Too \nopen?\n\n\nJACKIE: Too, too non-traditional. Too experimental.\n\n\nWILSON, \npushing her off of him\n: Jesus, too artsy? It\u2019s too artsy for the \ntheatre?!\n\n\nJACKIE: Don\u2019t be that way, Wilson, everything gets flattened out.\n\n\nWILSON: FLATTENED? Oh, I see, downsized and jaded. Aged until\u2026until it\u2019s dust and\u2026don\u2019t be what way, Jackie?\n\n\nJACKIE: You truly, deeply believe you\u2019re above it, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re not exactly the savior of theatre, Wilson. This is how it works.\n\n\nWILSON, \nstricken\n: Oh, yeah, I see. Sure, it is. Like\u2026I went to your show, because I like you. I went and just watched. Soulless. Hopelessly soulless, just going through the motions, just\u2013\n\n\nJACKIE: Oh, real kind, sure you did.\n\n\nWILSON: Robotic, Jackie. Just \nso\n robotic! I don\u2019t understand how you sell your soul for the same nothing show and nothing apartment and\u2026\n\n\nJACKIE, \nfighting back emotions\n: Get the \nhell\n out of my house, Wilson. \n(She goes to the desk and throws his manuscript at him. He doesn\u2019t budge)\n I said, get THE HELL OUT\u2013\n\n\n(Black, viscous blood shoots from her fingertips, floating upwards into the air. Long silence.)\n\n\nJACKIE: This place takes just as much as it gives.\n\n\n(Lights go down, actors prepare for Scene 3.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterlude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The lights come up. JACKIE and WILSON enter at the same time. WILSON is holding a notebook he writes in relentlessly, rubbing his eyes. JACKIE has a bag slung over her shoulder. They wander, moving across the stage, going about their tasks. The music swells. WILSON moves in sweeping arcs, writing with increasing fervor, neglecting the world around him. JACKIE starts to fall into an almost-waltz. It looks like she's being thrown around and beaten across the stage, with crescendo'ing violence. They cross each other, and lock eyes, and pause. Then, they continue, falling into a lonely partner dance. There are turns, and clapping, but they do not acknowledge one another. It gets intense, painful. Warm colors rise and attack the stage. Finally, WILSON falters, tripping over his ankle. His notebook falls to the floor ahead of him. JACKIE is directly upstage of him, the notebook directly downstage. He picks himself up, spotlight.)\n\n\nWILSON: When I, uh, dream? Closing my eyes, fading away, moving back into the end, I'm here. At the edge of a cliff, endless darkness out ahead of me. Every time. I can feel the dust collecting on my feet, I can hear the wind beckoning me. I guess it's not really a cliff as much as whatever's out there is a pit. A pit that something or, or someone is supposed to fill. I walk to the edge, and I look down, and, um. I see myself. My reflection, I guess. \n(He looks up.)\n You threw me out of your apartment, and I can't tell if that was right, or if I did something wrong. I mean, I was gonna\u2019 put you in it. And I guess that doesn\u2019t matter, but\u2013 but to me it does, I think. We keep meeting. And I wish we didn't, ya' know, so I could bury whatever part of me just has to cling. I'm not so lucky. I imagine you'd see it as a statistical anomaly, a gala here, a street corner there. Part of me thinks\u2026no, that's\u2026that's stupid. But, look, I like you. I really like you, I like how you're just there, unshakeable, and how clear you see things and\u2026 \n(He turns around, and points at JACKIE)\n\nWhen I used to look at you, I'd see a version of myself. And I liked \nthat.\n I think I still do. But now, I see myself in this. \n(He turns again to the front, pointing to the notebook. JACKIE disappears.)\n In my dreams, I put both of my feet right up to the end, and I hold my breath, arms outstretched, and I fall. It swallows me. \n(He raises an arm to the sky)\n And whatever is unsaid is held forever. The rest is silence.\n\n\n(Blackout.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Rehearsal room, somewhere in the Red Court. There\u2019s a bookshelf of plays, all color coded. WILSON stands alone against the wall, with a manuscript in the crook of his arm. He looks lost. His eyes dart aimlessly, sluggishly, around the room. There\u2019s gold trim around his mask, it isn\u2019t particularly impressive. He looks up at the door out. JACKIE, on a whim, enters. She\u2019s pale. Her mask is featureless. They acknowledge each other. Long silence.)\n\n\nWILSON: Jackie.\n\n\nJACKIE: Wilson.\n\n\nWILSON: How\u2026how are you?\n\n\nJACKIE: Jesus, how old are we?\n\n\nWILSON: Alright. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n(Beat.)\n\n\nJACKIE: I\u2019m good. I\u2019m trying\u2013 I\u2019m tired, Wilson.\n\n\nWILSON: Tired?\n\n\nJACKIE: Yes. I\u2019m so tired, and I don\u2019t know how I walked in here when I had a million other routes to wherever the hell I was walking to, and\u2026and\u2026\n\n\nWILSON: I see. I see.\n\n\nJACKIE: Are you here, Will?\n\n\nWILSON: What?\n\n\nJACKIE: Right now, are you \nhere.\n You don\u2019t look well.\n\n\nWILSON: Excuse me? No, maybe I\u2019m not, Jack. I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all so simple.\n\n\nJACKIE: Yeah?\n\n\nWILSON: I think so. I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m tired too, I think. I haven\u2019t been able to sit and\u2026I don\u2019t have the words. Why aren\u2019t you leaving?\n\n\nJACKIE: I can\u2019t. We keep meeting. And I\u2019ve got more words, more thoughts. I can\u2019t seem to run out. So I can\u2019t seem to leave, sue me. I don\u2019t forgive you.\n\n\nWILSON: I know.\n\n\n(Long silence.)\n\n\nJACKIE: So. How\u2019s the workshop?\n\n\nWILSON: It was OK. I\u2019m undecided.\n\n\nJACKIE: And that\u2019s why you\u2019re alone in your rehearsal space?\n\n\nWILSON: Call it that. Heh. I\u2026They made the changes they wanted to make. I look in the\u2026in the mirror, and don\u2019t recognize myself. What does that say? About me? I guess I\u2019m here just looking for an answer. It\u2019s what I am. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve become.\n\n\nJACKIE: Are you still drinking?\n\n\nWILSON: Are you still smoking?\n\n\n(Beat.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Maybe we\u2019re not the same at all. Christ, maybe we\u2019re too much alike. You know what I\u2019ve been doing? \n(She pulls up a chair, placing it C)\n Workshop to workshop, room to room, like a ghost. I had a class on clowning, \nclowning.\n Red rubber nose, huge characters. The lady said to view the world like a baby. We took turns making a new uses for a chair. \n(She dramatically acts each one, over enthusiastically, violently)\n Here it\u2019s a shield for my mimed sword. Here, set it down and it\u2019s the front seat of a car. Here, I set it on my head and march around and it\u2019s an elaborate headdress or I\u2019m a queen or something. But Wilson, it remains what it is. No one gets to decide that the\u2026that the chair isn\u2019t what it is. Or, I don\u2019t. And I kept thinking - which class sent me spiraling down and out. No one class, or book or whatever, can get me back. Was it the play? Was it something I did? It\u2019s a chair Wilson. Look at it. If I could find that inflection point where the slope peaked, just locate and destroy it, how much I would give to win again. Here, it\u2019s a tapper. Here you put it to a microphone and it sings. Here, you put me nose to grindstone and I will \nclown\n for you but\u2026\n\n\nWILSON: But it\u2019s a chair.\n\n\nJACKIE: Right.\n\n\nWILSON: If I could go back in time, Jack, do you know what I\u2019d do? I wouldn\u2019t go fixing tragedies or rigging the stock market. I\u2019d go, back, and I\u2019d fix all those mistakes that taught me to be who I am. The thousands of tiny awakenings. I\u2019m not perfect today, I don\u2019t mean that, but I\u2019m so much better than I was years ago. Or I seem so much better, I act so much better. There\u2019s\u2026there\u2019s ideas always rattling around, always, in my head? I\u2019d be on top of the world, and I\u2019d never stop. I\u2019d \nnever, stop.\n I\u2019d have my cake and, damn it, I\u2019d eat it too. And I wouldn\u2019t regret. I wouldn\u2019t regret anything. I\u2019d fix what I did to all those people. \n(Beat.)\n Hell, I imagine I\u2019d fix this. \n(Silence. They don\u2019t break eye contact.)\n Sorry, God, I mean to\u2013\n\n\nJACKIE: I\u2019m wounded, Wilson.\n\n\nWILSON: What?\n\n\n(She reveals her stomach, which has a large gash across its length. It\u2019s spurting coagulated, somewhat dried black blood. WILSON stares.)\n\n\nJACKIE: I\u2019m wounded. I look on my very soul and it\u2019s leaking.\n\n\nWILSON: Shit\u2026I\u2013 how\u2026?\n\n\nJACKIE: I don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t me, Jesus. I tripped somewhere, over extended somewhere else. It was hairline an age ago.\n\n\nWILSON: Is that anything related to the\u2026 \n(He gestures to her hands. She looks down at them.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Probably.\n\n\nWILSON: Jesus, Jack, that\u2019s\u2026I mean, that\u2019s\u2026\n(He begins to hyperventilate.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Do you know what I would do, if I could go back in time? I wouldn\u2019t have given up my soul. I wouldn\u2019t have given it up a thousand times. At every meeting, with every open call, in every performance, a million little deaths. Bending, and pushing, and breaking, and breaking, and breaking, and giving!\n\n\nWILSON: Then what are you doing? Why are you here?\n\n\nJACKIE: Because I want it back, Wilson. Because my show at the Mirth was discontinued. Because I need to find a new path. Because I\u2019m a masochist. I\u2026I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nWILSON: I don\u2019t think\u2026that\u2019s not right; you need to go sort yourself out! Christ, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know, um. I\u2019m sorry about the Mirth.\n\n\nJACKIE: Are you? Or are you happy that you won\u2019t\u2013 that you won\u2019t have to evict me from it yourself?\n\n\nWILSON: That part of me\u2026is dead.\n\n\n(WILSON manages a smile. It\u2019s unclear if he believes it. Suddenly, they both start laughing. It becomes hysterical. They embrace, WILSON tears up. His eyes dart between the windows, and then he begins to cry/laugh unabashedly.)\n\n\nJACKIE: There are two options, the way I see it. Either, I\u2019m wasting, and it\u2019s eating me alive.\n\n\nWILSON: Like a deer.\n\n\nJACKIE: Exactly, exactly. The other option is that\u2026\n(She hadn\u2019t considered this before.)\n is that the hole in my stomach lets the light in. The spirit needs somewhere to enter. It\u2019s the path\u2026home.\n\n\nWILSON: I don\u2019t like that. I\u2026no. That\u2019s not it.\n\n\nJACKIE: I think I\u2019m starting to get it. Maybe I need to just\u2013\n\n\n(She notices the shelves of plays, looks at WILSON, and gets up with a start towards the bookshelf.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Oh Jesus, Wilson, I reckon you were right. Down with it! \n(WILSON begins interjecting, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d \u201cwhat are you talking about,\u201d etc.)\n If I could go back in time I swear I\u2019d burn it all down! Who\u2019s going to miss it? WHO?!\n\n\n(She begins throwing the plays out from the shelves onto the ground, they fall in a pile. WILSON gets up, clearly deeply stressed, but doesn\u2019t interfere.)\n\n\nWILSON: Jack. Jacqueline, what is this?\n\n\nJACKIE: I say we rip up the canon, bury their muses. That\u2019s what it is! That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about! No more classes, no more stages, the real high art, just\u2013 just stop and smell the roses for a second. \n(She pulls out a cigarette lighter. WILSON crowds behind her.)\n\n\nWILSON: Alright, let\u2019s\u2014\n\n\nJACKIE: Are you not with me on this? Come on, it\u2019ll be fun! \n(WILSON looks at JACKIE, before going and throwing plays from the shelves.)\n Thank you! Look at them, WORDS, WORDS, WORDS! USELESS! We\u2019ll just run off somewhere, or break something, or see a sunset. What I would give to see a sunset!\n\n\n(Finally, the bookshelf is empty. JACKIE doesn\u2019t move, and stares at WILSON. Long silence.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Go on, throw it in the pile.\n\n\nWILSON: Excuse me?\n\n\nJACKIE: The manuscript, Wilson. Everything has to go, it\u2019s a goddamned fire sale!\n\n\nWILSON: No, I\u2013 no. No way. I\u2013\n\n\nJACKIE: You can\u2019t? \nYou\n can\u2019t? You hate it, I hate it. I can see it in your eyes, you\u2019re exhausted with it, it puts you to illness.\n\n\nWILSON: Well, look, I\u2013 Jackie, I can\u2019t do that, you know I\u2013 it\u2019s so easy for you to send it to ash but I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026\n\n\nJACKIE: Wilson, come on. You can do it Wilson. Into the fire! Into the fire! Into the fire!\n\n\nWILSON: Um. God, screw off! Stop it, stop it!\n\n\nJACKIE: \nInto the fire! Into the fire! Into the\u2013\n\n\n(WILSON gags, before turning around and stress vomiting. It goes on longer than it should. JACKIE slowly walks towards him, putting a hand on his back.)\n\n\nJACKIE: Jesus, Will, it was\u2026it was just a joke! It\u2019s not like that, I was just\u2026I was joking, Wilson. Heh. It was\u2026 do you need help with\u2026? \n(He shakes his head no, with heaving breath. He wipes his mouth and goes to exit.)\n Alright. Do you want me to\u2013 \n(He signals no.)\n It was just a joke Wilson! That\u2019s it!\n\n\n(WILSON exits. JACKIE watches the door for a time, before turning and looking at the large pile of plays on the ground. She kneels, takes one of the books, reads its title. She sparks her lighter, and presses it against the book. It catches, and she places it onto the pile.\n\n\nHer face is expressionless.\n\n\nBlackout. After a time, the sound of a door slamming.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A rooftop in the Red Court. One ghost light DC lights the stage. It is turned on by WILSON, sitting and looking at the city below. It is quiet. He winces and rapidly blinks, he looks as though he hasn\u2019t slept in days. The mask he wears is abrasively ornate. He speaks with great effort during this scene. JACKIE enters at the back. She is a silhouette in the darkness.)\n\n\nJACKIE: So why here.\n\n\nWILSON: I come here\u2026a lot. It\u2019s close to where we met, at that party? Look it\u2019s\u2013 \n(He points)\n it\u2019s just there.\n\n\nJACKIE: That\u2019s thoughtful. You said you frequent?\n\n\n(She approaches, entering the light. Blood has pooled around her eyes. Her mask now looks tacky, as from a costume shop. It has a spiderweb across it.)\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah. I dangle my feet off, and I look down, and I think about\u2026just\u2026falling. \n(He makes a whistle that gets gradually quieter, before a \u201cboom\u201d sound.)\n\n\nJACKIE: So why don\u2019t you?\n\n\nWILSON: Heh. Sometimes I fear I\u2019ll fall \nup.\n Isn\u2019t that awful?\n\n\nJACKIE, sitting down on the other side of the ghost light: It\u2019s not great, no. It\u2019s peaceful, though?\n\n\nWILSON: It is. Lots of time to think. I watch the hordes of people go by blissfully, absent-minded, drunk on it all.\n\n\nJACKIE: They\u2019re enviable.\n\n\nWILSON: That they are. I heard about your coma.\n\n\nJACKIE: You and every producer in the reds, Wilson.\n\n\nWILSON: Do you wanna talk about it?\n\n\nJACKIE: Not particularly, no. \n(Silence.)\n But it had me reevaluating everything. Everything that I want, that I dream about. I\u2019m leaving. Soon.\n\n\nWILSON: What? Why?\n\n\nJACKIE: Because this isn\u2019t what it\u2019s all for, is it? What I really want these days is a sunset, or a field, or something. Meeting someone at a party or dancing to old jazz records\u2013\n\n\nWILSON: Or burning old plays?\n\n\nJACKIE: Or watching clouds. I think\u2026if I spend a single day more here, I will die. Worse than that, I mean, there\u2019ll be no one to mourn.\n\n\nWILSON: Hey, stop that. I\u2026I don\u2019t, um, want you to leave. So don\u2019t, please?\n\n\nJACKIE: Wilson.\n\n\nWILSON: Because, because look. I\u2019m really not comprised of a lot. It\u2019s what I do\u2026and you. You\u2019re really all I got, Jack. I don\u2019t know what I, what I become. So you can\u2019t go, don\u2019t.\n\n\nJACKIE: You\u2019ll live. Come on.\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah, ok so I\u2019ll live. But\u2013 I walked out.\n\n\nJACKIE: Of\u2026?\n\n\nWILSON: The opening. At the Mirth. \nMy\n opening. The best moment of my life. Watching it\u2026it was like my spirit had been sucked out and bastardized. Every actor, every light cue, every single piece of blocking. Twisted. I walked before intermission. I didnt turn back, and I came to this roof, and I\u2019ve just\u2026contemplated.\n\n\nJACKIE: Soulless?\n\n\nWILSON: Robotic. Poisonous. And it\u2019s who I am. You can\u2019t separate that performance from me, ya\u2019 know? My names in the headline. So the point, the point is. Heh. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen if I just keep \ngoing.\n\n\nJACKIE: You\u2019re focusing really hard on the words, Will.\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah. This\u2026the brain fog. It\u2019s gotten bad. There\u2019s no spark in the words, I just\u2026I just grab for them. Like pinching grains of sand in a sieve. Like holding onto water.\n\n\nJACKIE: So, while you\u2019re up here. What do you dream about?\n\n\nWILSON: Look at this. Us and our dreams. \n(Beat.)\n Black water. Endless, in every direction. You and I being lifted upwards, always. It\u2019s peace, and nothing more. Higher and higher.\n\n\nJACKIE: And the hope would build.\n\n\nWILSON: Yes, the hope would build.\n\n\n(Long silence.)\n\n\nJACKIE: If it makes you feel any better, burning those plays didn\u2019t fix it. It gave me nothing the next day but emptiness. I didn\u2019t burn the ones in my apartment, but I haven\u2019t read them since. I thought maybe the answers would be out on the street, a total nobody struggling, but it wasn\u2019t there either. Makes you wonder where the hell else it could be. Makes you wonder if it exists at all. And then, I was walking, and walking, and thinking and thinking, and it was colder then. Like being thrown under icy water, or resting your head in the snow. And I fell into the coma. I don\u2019t know why I fought myself back awake, but I suppose it\u2019s because I wasnt supposed to die lost.\n\n\nWILSON: I just\u2026I just can\u2019t take it. I wish so badly that I could. I thought I could, and I held on for so long with this belief that I was better than everybody. I came here to escape. I hurt a lot of people. I wonder if, if I took off my mask right now, and you weren\u2019t there, would there be a face under it?\n\n\n(JACKIE wipes blood from her eyes, and dabs it in WILSON\u2019s palm, and then her own. She holds her hand out over the threshold, and it begins to float into the air. WILSONs does the same.)\n\n\nJACKIE: This, my blood, it is the Hanged King\u2019s.\n\n\nWILSON: This, my blood, it is the Hanged King\u2019s.\n\n\nJACKIE: Wilson?\n\n\nWILSON: Yeah?\n\n\nJACKIE: Was it ever really love to you?\n\n\nWILSON: Does it matter?\n\n\n(Long silence. They stare at the blood as it swirls and ascends higher and higher in the air. The floating blood congeals into one singular, rising column. WILSON reaches up and puts out the ghost light.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8701\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSecure Containment Procedures:\n Investigation into the mechanisms of SCP-8701 are underway, particularly any connections to thaumaturgical memetics it may represent.
