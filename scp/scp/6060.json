Prescott\n\n\nSecurity Clearance:\n Level 3\n\n\nHistory:\n Researcher Prescott spent many years in the service of the Foundation under the Prometheus Project, and following her notable progress and commendable research skills was brought on board as a researcher in the aftermath of the 6060-GH event.\n\n\nNotable Assignments:\n\nSCP-6060\n\nPrometheus Project\n\nSCP-5825\n\nEE-6210-C\n\n\nCurrent Assignment:\n SCP-6060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzie C. Prescott. There's a name I haven't heard in a while.\n\n\nSeems like forever ago. A whole different identity, a whole different life. A whole different person.\n\n\nWhat a waste of time. What even was that project? SCP-6060\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Tag:\n SCP-6060\n\n\nItem Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nPreservation Importance:\n \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24\u2b24\u2b24\n\n\nContainment Procedures:\n \nSCP-6060 is to remain contained at Site-40 by any means necessary. The well-being of SCP-6060 is maintained by Researcher Prescott. Once a week, a tissue sample shall be taken by Prescott for the purposes of Promethean Reconstruction.\n SCP-6060 is to be located and contained as soon as possible.\n\n\nItem Description:\n SCP-6060 is a bipedal organism of the female sex who answers to the name \"Candela\". SCP-6060's DNA is an exact match for that of \nHomo sapiens\n and appears to possess no anomalous traits. SCP-6060 was born many decades after the 6060-GH event (colloquially \"The Calamity\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh. That's right.\n\n\nWe weren't finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6060-A:\n SCP-6060 interview\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6060\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Susan Prescott, Dr. Cleveland Ozwald\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted to learn what SCP-6060 knows about its origins and other relevant information.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n SCP-6060. My name is Dr. Ozwald, and this is Researcher Prescott. Today we will be discussing your origins.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I told you when you took me that I don't know anything. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I'm alive.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Could you tell us how you went so long without being caught?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Yes, I would assume that someone would have noticed that you never shifted.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n That's not your business.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n You're at our mercy, SCP\u2013 \n[SCP-6060 pounds its fists against the glass divider, interrupting him.]\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n And that's not my name! It's Candela. I told you that.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I'm afraid per protocols we have to use your\u2026 designation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back. I can practically feel the puppet strings of the former self I was forced to be in that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-6060 is visibly angry, but does not reply.]\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n We've come to an understanding regarding your name. Now back to being caught, or how you weren't.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Have you considered some people just didn't care? So what if I'm human, I'm not hurting them.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n It makes a good point.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n That it does, Suzie.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n What? What did I say?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n We are done for the day.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Plans to showcase SCP-6060's existence to the public are underway.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was so excited to work with another intelligent being. I thought we'd never find an anomaly of that type in this world. But alas, Candela. I don't really remember much of what she was like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6060-B:\n SCP-6060 existence in the aftermath of the 6060-GH event\n\n\nSCP-6060's existence is notable primarily because it's generally accepted that baseline humans do not exist following the GH-Class \"Dead Greenhouse\" event known as \"the calamity.\" The anomaly is evident in that SCP-6060 was born after 6060-GH occurred, making its birth an anomaly itself. The implications of SCP-6060's existence are currently unknown, but high-profile.\n\n\nThe Foundation conducted a series of interviews to gauge the general populace's thoughts on the possibility of SCP-6060's existence before making their research known to the public. For the entirety of the interview conducted, see \nSCP-6060-AUI\n.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dominic Arania\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Susan Prescott\n\n\nForeword:\n Mr. Arania is a large organism of the order Arachnid that claims to be from an \nalternate timeline\n where spiders are the dominant species.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Thank you for your time, Mr. Arania. I'm just going to ask you a few questions if that's alright.\n\n\nDominic Arania:\n Whatever. Just make it quick.\n\n\nPrescott:\n What do you know about The Calamity\"?\n\n\nArania:\n No more than anyone else. Wiped out all humans, nonhumans took over the earth. That was well before my time, it's not like I remember it.\n\n\nPrescott:\n Understood. Do you believe the calamity wiped out all humanity?\n\n\nArania:\n You're asking if I believe in Civs? \n[He laughs.]\n No, I don't believe in civs. They're a myth meant to scare little spiders into being good.\n\n\nPrescott:\n How do you think you would react if you met someone you knew for certain was baseline human?\n\n\nArania:\n Squish them. \n[He laughs again.]\n I don't know. Why the hypotheticals?\n\n\nPrescott:\n Just part of our research. Perhaps a better way to phrase would be how would you feel if you met a\u2026 civ? What do you think the implications of that would be?\n\n\nArania:\n \n[He is silent for several moments.]\n I think I would be scared.\n\n\nPrescott:\n Scared? Why?\n\n\nArania:\n Because it means they could come back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Mr. Samual Barros\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Cleveland Ozwald\n\n\nOthers Present:\n Researcher Susan Prescott\n\n\nForeword:\n Mr. Barros is a humanoid with attributes reminiscent of a Great White Shark \n(Carcharodon carcharias)\n, including what appears to be a live miniature shark in placement of hair. Mr. Barros claims to be a \"creature\", a being who survived The Calamity by having anomalous attributes beforehand.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Mr. Barros. I would like to ask you a couple of questions.\n\n\nBarros:\n You can just call me Sam, man. And no problem.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n What do you know about \"The Calamity\"?\n\n\nBarros:\n That I was alive before it. I was human. I could talk to sharks, and they didn't hurt me. Made surfing much less dangerous. Many of my memories are fuzzy. \n[chuckles]\n Seems those were enough to keep me alive, though. Maybe I was always part shark.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n \n[nods]\n As you seem to know, all humans were killed by The Calamity. But what if I told you not \nall\n humans were dead?\n\n\nBarros:\n \n[sits up]\n You mean civs? \n[chuckles]\n Civs are just a myth, man. \n[pause]\n Unless you mean you've seen one?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n This is a hypothetical situation. In this situation, what would you do if you got to meet one?\n\n\nBarros:\n \n[his smile fades]\n That\u2026 that has a lot of answers. \n[pause]\n I mean, I'd be happy that humans aren't dead. But, I'd be jealous, admittedly. Why do they get to be human, while I'm the one with the 50-pound shark on my head that miraculously hasn't snapped my neck?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Would you want people jealous of you, angry at you for something you can't control?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Suzie, we made it clear you wouldn't be asking questions this interview.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Sorry, I just thought it was a relevant\u2013\n\n\nBarros:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n \n[remeains silent for a moment]\n Thank you for your candor. That will be all for today.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6060-C:\n Testing the humanity of SCP-6060\n\n\nIn the time following the discovery and containment of SCP-6060, many tests were performed to verify that it possessed no anomalous qualities. These tests included:\n\n\n\n\nTesting of tissue sample\n\n\nTesting of blood sample\n\n\nMeasuring vital signs\n\n\nExposure to items and life deemed anomalous to humans\n\n\n\n\nThese tests occurred weekly, along with the collection of tissue for Promethean Reconstruction per Researcher Prescott's needs.\n\n\nThese logs have been expunged for irrelevancy. To request extended logs, see Dr. Ozwald.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not right. I know I had those files somewhere\u2026\n\n\nCome on, think. It wasn't \nthat\n long ago. Where would I have kept them?\n\nMy personnel file is the only thing that makes sense\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel File:\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Miss Susan \"Suzie\" C. Prescott\n\n\nSecurity Clearance:\n Level 3\n\n\nHistory:\n Researcher Prescott spent many years in the service of the Foundation under the Prometheus Project, and following her notable progress and commendable research skills was brought on board as a researcher in the aftermath of the 6060-GH event.\n\n\nNotable Assignments:\n\nSCP-6060\n\nPrometheus Project\n\nSCP-5825\n\n\n\n\nEE-6210-C\n\n\n\n\nCandela\u00a0Audio\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n    > Tissue Test\n\n\n    > Blood Test\n\n\n    > Vitals Test\n\n\n    > Exposure to items and life deemed anomalous to humans\n\n\n    > MANUALLY INPUT LOG 1\n\n\n    > MANUALLY INPUT LOG 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Assignment:\n SCP-6060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait\u2026 I don't remember working on EE-6210-C.\n\n\nSometimes I'm a genius.\n\n\nLet's check these out. The tissue one\u2026 that would've been real early on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio log: SCP-6060 Tissue test.\n\n\nSCPs Present: SCP-6060\n\n\nPersonnel Present: Researcher Prescott\n\n\nOthers Present: n/a\n\n\nAudio:\n\n\n\n\n[A door opens. There is silence for a few moments.]\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Um. Hello, SCP\u2013\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Stop calling me that! That is not my name.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Understood. I\u2026 I won't call you that.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n What are you doing here? Asking more stupid questions?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n No, no. I'm\u2026 I'm afraid we have to run a few tests.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Tests?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n On you.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I figured that much, I'm asking what kind of tests?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Nothing too drastic. We want to keep you safe.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n That's rich.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n \u2026Today is just a tissue sample. Just a bit of skin.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Will it hurt?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n A bit, but no more than say a scraped knee.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n A scraped knee still hurts.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Yes. I suppose it does.\n\n\n[Several moments of silence pass as Researcher Prescott prepares to take the sample. SCP-6060 winces.]\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Sorry.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n It's not too bad it's just\u2026 yeah.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Mmhmm.\n\n\n[Several more moments pass before either speaks.]\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n You weren't with them.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Pardon?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n You weren't with the others when they captured me. Every other person I've seen in this facility was with the group that kidnapped me. But not you.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n They don't usually bring me out into the field.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Why not?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n The sample collection is over. Go ahead and apply pressure for me here.\n\n\n[There are more sounds as Researcher Prescott begins to leave.]\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026thanks.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n For what?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I don't know\u2026 not being as terrible to me as the others.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n That sounds like a low bar to meet.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Well, thanks for meeting it, doc.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I'm not a doctor.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Then what do I call you?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Um\u2026 Hm\u2026 The Foundation\u2013 the others call me Suzie.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Well, thank you for doing the bare minimum, Suzie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, right. She appreciated humanity, no one else seemed to give it. I was just doing what seemed right. She was\u2026 human after all. I suppose that's why no one else acted how I did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio log: SCP-6060 Blood test.\n\n\nSCPs Present: SCP-6060\n\n\nPersonnel Present: Researcher Prescott\n\n\nOthers Present: n/a\n\n\nAudio:\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Hello again\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026Just get it over with, \"SPD 6060\" or whatever.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I figured you wouldn't like that.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Then why not call me by my name?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I really don't think the Foundation will like that.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n So whose wrath do you fear more then?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n It's not about who I'll make angry.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Then what is it about?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n \n[pause]\n I need to take some blood samples, along with another tissue sample. It\u2026 shouldn't take too long.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Baaaah.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n \n[A few moments of silence pass.]\n Huh?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Baah, you know, like a sheep. I watched some movies with them.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Yes\u2026 why are you bringing that up?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Sheep follow the herd. You do what you are told without question.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Huh? I mean\u2026 What else am I supposed to do?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I can tell that you've got an individual spirit in you.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n How\u2013 Wait, are you trying to lecture me?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Not necessarily. I know by the way you talk with me, you actually listen to my feelings. No one else here does that.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I guess that's true\u2026 I just, treat you how I'd want to be treated in this situation.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n That's what I mean. No one else does that.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I\u2026 guess I didn't notice that. Would you like me to do the same arm for your tissue sample?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Doesn't really matter to me. \n[Pause]\n Why are you running so many tests on me?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n To see if there's any variation from baseline humanity.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n But why so many?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n It's just what we do.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n The Foundation?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n We find anomalies. Secure, contain, and protect them.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Funny. I don't feel very secure or protected.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I believe that. Alright, we're done. Your arm will be a little sore for a bit, but you can remove the bandage in a few minutes. Let me know if you experience any unforeseen side effects or if pain persists longer than an hour.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026Thanks, Suzie.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Don't mention it. Please.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio log: SCP-6060 Vitals test.\n\n\nSCPs Present: SCP-6060\n\n\nPersonnel Present: Researcher Prescott\n\n\nOthers Present: n/a\n\n\nAudio:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Hey.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n What is it today?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Vitals and another tissue sample.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n That's\u2026 that's a lot of equipment.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Yeah. Honestly kind of overkill in my opinion. But I guess we'll start with the EKG, it's the most tedious to set up. Alright, I'm going to need to stick these on your body. I can never remember which goes to which though\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Um, I don't\u2026 No, I won't\u2013\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n What? \n[Pause]\n No, hey, hey, it's not gonna hurt. Look I know it all looks scary but it's just like\u2026 putting stickers on your body. Just some pressure, and there's not even any residue when we're finished. Okay?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Okay\u2026\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Okay. Just gonna attach this one here\u2026 then this one here, this one\u2013 yep, you got it, and this one\u2026 I'm gonna let you do that one, right at your hip. Yep, perfect. Alright give me one second\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026Suzie, I\u2013!\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Breathe with me, in\u2026 and out\u2026 and in\u2026 and out\u2026 just think calming thoughts.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Like what?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Whatever you want. When I get anxious I imagine myself by a rushing river, the water clear but flowing, animals splashing in the water, birds chirping\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n That\u2026 helps weirdly.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Good, good. And we're almost done with the EKG. We can move onto the tissue sample next, if that'll make you feel more comfortable.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Okay. \u2026Why a river?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I'm\u2026 I don't know. \n[Pause]\n Okay, fine. So, one day, a long time ago, I got to leave the site, and I just started walking and I came across this river. I don't think I'd ever seen a river before. And I swear in that moment it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026So they don't let you leave either?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Um\u2026 no\u2026 I mean\u2013 yes! I mean\u2013 It's\u2026 it's complicated.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I just assumed you were one of them.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I am.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n But you're not \nlike\n the rest of them\u2026 but you're trying to seem like you are. Why?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n \u2026It's complicated. That's it for today. Let me know if there are any problems.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026Thanks.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n You say that to me a lot. I'm not sure I've deserved it.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Regardless, I'm offering it.

These\u2026 these tissue and blood samples. While the Foundation has been using them to ensure you're a full-blooded human, they've also been used to keep me alive.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \n[silence]\n You're so unique. You're like me, almost one of a kind. How come we're treated as something to be scared of? Why are they using such an amazing miracle of science to do the shit they don't want to? Were you expected to be a slave? If so, that backfired, and you need to let them know.\n\n\n[Twenty seconds of silence pass]\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n I-I'm sorry, I shouldn't\u2013\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n You're right. But it's not that simple either. It turns out the procedure used to revive those like me wipes our memories. I don't remember anything about who I was before I was a Promethean. This place, horrible as it is, is the only place I've ever known, these people were the ones to teach me everything I know. I can't just\u2026 leave.\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Yes, you can.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Where would I even go? What would I even do outside of the only place I've ever known?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n \u2026Start small. Go to the river. \n[Pause]\n Then, if you want, legend tells of a haven.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n A haven? For whom?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Anybody who needs somewhere to go. A haven most difficult to find if those who seek it have ill intent. A haven where a human girl can have a normal childhood without anyone thinking anything of it, and a place where should she leave, she'd find herself in danger. A place she shouldn't have set foot outside.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Suppose this haven exists, and suppose I wanted to go there. How would I get there?\n\n\nSCP-6060:\n Follow your heart. You'll know when you're halfway there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANUALLY INPUT LOG\n\n\n\n\nAudio log: Security log of SCP-6060\n\n\nSCPs Present: n/a\n\n\nPersonnel Present: Researcher Prescott\n\n\nOthers Present: Candela\n\n\nAudio:\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Candela, Candela wake up.\n\n\nCandela:\n Suzie\u2026?

We have to go.\n\n\nCandela:\n You mean\u2026?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n You're getting out of here.\n\n\nCandela:\n Oh my god. Oh my god, this is incredible, I\u2013 thank you, Suzie. I can't believe it, we're getting out of here, you'll get away from the Foundation, I'll get to show you my home\u2013!\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n No, Candela. You're getting out. I have to stay behind.\n\n\nCandela:\n \u2026What? But, why?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n We don't have time for this.\n\n\nCandela:\n But without my tissue\u2026 you'll die.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I'll be fine.\n\n\nCandela:\n Bullshit.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I got by for many years without you. I've been saving up samples, I'll be fine for a bit.\n\n\nCandela:\n But the Foundation will suspect you.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n They'll suspect me if I leave, too. And if I go with you they might find you again. They'd never stop searching. Please, Candela, you have a chance to leave this place, and I have a chance to make sure they never hurt anyone again.\n\n\nCandela:\n That shouldn't be your responsibility.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n I know. But I'm the only one who can do it.\n\n\nCandela:\n \u2026Thank you Suzie.

I hate to point fingers, but the sign\u2014\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n It was me. No need to drag it out.\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n I knew we shouldn't have trusted a \npromethean\n with 6060.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Hey, Suzie\u2019s part of the Foundation just like us.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Am I?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n What is that supposed to mean? Of\u2014\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n The more time I spent with Candela, I came to realize something.\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n Candela? You\u2019re using its name now?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Then just call me SCP-6060-1. Because we\u2019re not that different. Candela\u2026 she\u2019s like me, an outcast within a world built against that idea.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n You\u2019re not an outcast.\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n You don\u2019t treat me normally. It\u2019s like\u2014 I\u2019m technically still human! I\u2026 I\u2019d ask why I have more rights than Candela, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not even allowed to leave. I\u2019m just another anomaly you have control over.\n\n\nResearcher. Youl:\n But you\u2019re one of our friends! D-don\u2019t say that stuff! \n[pause]\n What\u2019s gotten into you?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n It\u2019s not what\u2019s gotten into me. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been holding in. I never commented on this unfairness because I owed you my life. I figured the Foundation knew what was best for me. But Candela\u2026 I learned so much talking to her. All I had to do was talk to her like she was worthy of my attention, because she was. Not some object to be locked up.\n\n\nResearcher Youl:\n Suzie\u2014\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n What are we even doing? We\u2019ve found like two or three things that are anomalous now, and just perform stupid tests that teach us nothing. Just face it, there\u2019s no need for the Foundation anymore.\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n That\u2019s ridiculous! We have learned things! And we can con\u2014\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Suzie\u2019s right.\n\n\nResearcher Youl:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Why do you even care about the Foundation, Bella? You weren\u2019t alive.\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n Why can\u2019t I care about the restoration of civility just because I wasn\u2019t alive then?\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n Do you feel guilty for being alive?\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n What? What kind of question is that\u2014\n\n\nResearcher Youl:\n You did start acting more hostile when we found 6060.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n So did you, Jean.\n\n\nResearcher Youl:\n I\u2019m not letting you drag this out. Fine, I\u2019m jealous of 6060. Aren\u2019t we all? She got to keep her humanity while we\u2019re all stuck like this for some dumbass reason.\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n I haven\u2019t even talked to the rest of the team. But, it looks like we\u2019re just operating on longing of what we want. That\u2019s no way to respect this organization.\n\n\nDr. Kline:\n Cleavlend\u2026\n\n\nResearcher Prescott:\n We never needed to secure Candela. All it did was break apart the stability we were pretending to have. It\u2019s sad that it took this long to realize.\n\n\nResearcher Youl:\n What\u2026 what do we do now?\n\n\nDr. Ozwald:\n Stop pretending.\n\n\n[end log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard to revisit these memories\u2026 but it's good that I have.

I was even more surprised to hear where you wanted to meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were some old ghosts I needed to confront here. Knowing I would see you again gave me the courage to do so, and reminded me why I had too.\n\n\n\u2026It's good to see you, Candela.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's good to see you, too. Though I must admit, I half-feared this was a trap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can see how you thought that. But no. The Foundation is long gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know. I heard rumors, but could never be sure. That's why I had to come. To see it for myself.\n\n\n\u2026It's odd. Seeing it in such a state of disrepair. I mean, it wasn't even that long ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature moves quickly. Things change quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange is nature?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, change is human. And it seems human nature is not yet eradicated. You're proof of that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\n are proof of that, Suzie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of change\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHm?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch has changed. \nI\n have changed. I'm no longer the person you once knew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen who are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not the woman the Foundation thought they brought back. I'm not a woman at all. I'm something else, entirely new, undefined. Exciting. And I'm certainly not Researcher Susan C. Prescott.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I call you then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiver. My name is river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiver\u2026 I like it. It's very\u2026\n\n\nIt's very human.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026Thanks. It just\u2026 felt right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\u2026 with the Foundation gone, what are you doing? It sounded like you didn't really have a place to\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're very kind, Candela. But I can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou haven't even heard what I'm going to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen am I mistaken?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026You would love Haphway. It's such a lovely place to live, such a supportive community. You would never need to scavenge for tissue again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd \nyou\n would never feel safe again. Not truly. Tell me I'm wrong.\n\n\nI care for you too much to put you through that, my friend. Not for the safety of a promethean, of all things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredible. You still don't see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much you've done for me. How much you've taught me about living, and caring.\n\n\nHow incredibly human you are.\n\n\nIt really is good to see you again, my friend. Are you busy after this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven't been busy since the death of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could come with me. Meet my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandela, I already told you\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to Haphway. Just a little ways. Just down to the river. I'd like to see the place that made you\u2026 you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026I'd like to show it to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome on then. Let's go.

My name is Dr. Ozwald, and this is Researcher Prescott. Today we will be discussing your origins. SCP-6060: I told you when you took me that I don't know anything. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I'm alive. Researcher Prescott: Could you tell us how you went so long without being caught? Dr. Ozwald: Yes, I would assume that someone would have noticed that you never shifted. SCP-6060: That's not your business. Dr. Ozwald: You're at our mercy, SCP\u2013 [SCP-6060 pounds its fists against the glass divider, interrupting him.] SCP-6060: And that's not my name! It's Candela. I told you that. Researcher Prescott: I'm afraid per protocols we have to use your\u2026 designation.",

SCP-6060: Have you considered some people just didn't care? So what if I'm human, I'm not hurting them. Researcher Prescott: It makes a good point. Dr. Ozwald: That it does, Suzie. SCP-6060: What? What did I say? Dr. Ozwald: We are done for the day. <End Log> Closing Statement: Plans to showcase SCP-6060's existence to the public are underway.",

I'm just going to ask you a few questions if that's alright. Dominic Arania: Whatever. Just make it quick. Prescott: What do you know about The Calamity\"? Arania: No more than anyone else. Wiped out all humans, nonhumans took over the earth. That was well before my time, it's not like I remember it. Prescott: Understood. Do you believe the calamity wiped out all humanity? Arania: You're asking if I believe in Civs? [He laughs.] No, I don't believe in civs. They're a myth meant to scare little spiders into being good. Prescott: How do you think you would react if you met someone you knew for certain was baseline human? Arania: Squish them. [He laughs again.] I don't know. Why the hypotheticals? Prescott: Just part of our research. Perhaps a better way to phrase would be how would you feel if you met a\u2026 civ? What do you think the implications of that would be? Arania: [He is silent for several moments.] I think I would be scared. Prescott: Scared? Why? Arania: Because it means they could come back.",
        "Interviewed: Mr. Samual Barros Interviewer: Dr. Cleveland Ozwald Others Present: Researcher Susan Prescott Foreword: Mr. Barros is a humanoid with attributes reminiscent of a Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) , including what appears to be a live miniature shark in placement of hair. Mr. Barros claims to be a \"creature\", a being who survived The Calamity by having anomalous attributes beforehand. <Begin Log> Dr. Ozwald: Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Mr. Barros. I would like to ask you a couple of questions. Barros: You can just call me Sam, man. And no problem. Dr. Ozwald: What do you know about \"The Calamity\"? Barros: That I was alive before it. I was human. I could talk to sharks, and they didn't hurt me. Made surfing much less dangerous. Many of my memories are fuzzy. [chuckles] Seems those were enough to keep me alive, though. Maybe I was always part shark. Dr. Ozwald: [nods] As you seem to know, all humans were killed by The Calamity. But what if I told you not all humans were dead? Barros: [sits up] You mean civs? [chuckles] Civs are just a myth, man. [pause] Unless you mean you've seen one? Dr. Ozwald: This is a hypothetical situation. In this situation, what would you do if you got to meet one? Barros: [his smile fades] That\u2026 that has a lot of answers. [pause] I mean, I'd be happy that humans aren't dead. But, I'd be jealous, admittedly. Why do they get to be human, while I'm the one with the 50-pound shark on my head that miraculously hasn't snapped my neck? Researcher Prescott: Would you want people jealous of you, angry at you for something you can't control? Dr. Ozwald: Suzie, we made it clear you wouldn't be asking questions this interview.

Alright, we're done. Your arm will be a little sore for a bit, but you can remove the bandage in a few minutes.

Just gonna attach this one here\u2026 then this one here, this one\u2013 yep, you got it, and this one\u2026 I'm gonna let you do that one, right at your hip. Yep, perfect.

When I get anxious I imagine myself by a rushing river, the water clear but flowing, animals splashing in the water, birds chirping\u2026 SCP-6060: That\u2026 helps weirdly. Researcher Prescott: Good, good. And we're almost done with the EKG. We can move onto the tissue sample next, if that'll make you feel more comfortable. SCP-6060: Okay. \u2026Why a river? Researcher Prescott: I'm\u2026 I don't know. [Pause] Okay, fine. So, one day, a long time ago, I got to leave the site, and I just started walking and I came across this river. I don't think I'd ever seen a river before. And I swear in that moment it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. SCP-6060: \u2026So they don't let you leave either?

SCP-6060: What? No you're no\u2013 Researcher Prescott: Yes I am. Candela\u2026 [sigh] . It's about time I told you what a promethean is. SCP-6060: Promethean? Researcher Prescott: Have you seen any zombie movies made Pre-Calamity? SCP-6060: I have\u2026 wait\u2026 you mean\u2026 Researcher Prescott: [pause] Yes. I was brought back to life. By the Foundation. Prometheans are a bit different than zombies, though. We were brought back using science. And\u2026 we constantly fight decay. These\u2026 these tissue and blood samples. While the Foundation has been using them to ensure you're a full-blooded human, they've also been used to keep me alive. SCP-6060: [silence] You're so unique. You're like me, almost one of a kind. How come we're treated as something to be scared of? Why are they using such an amazing miracle of science to do the shit they don't want to? Were you expected to be a slave? If so, that backfired, and you need to let them know. [Twenty seconds of silence pass] SCP-6060: I-I'm sorry, I shouldn't\u2013 Researcher Prescott: You're right. But it's not that simple either. It turns out the procedure used to revive those like me wipes our memories. I don't remember anything about who I was before I was a Promethean. This place, horrible as it is, is the only place I've ever known, these people were the ones to teach me everything I know. I can't just\u2026 leave. SCP-6060: Yes, you can. Researcher Prescott: Where would I even go? What would I even do outside of the only place I've ever known? SCP-6060: \u2026Start small. Go to the river. [Pause] Then, if you want, legend tells of a haven. Researcher Prescott: A haven? For whom? SCP-6060: Anybody who needs somewhere to go. A haven most difficult to find if those who seek it have ill intent. A haven where a human girl can have a normal childhood without anyone thinking anything of it, and a place where should she leave, she'd find herself in danger. A place she shouldn't have set foot outside. Researcher Prescott: Suppose this haven exists, and suppose I wanted to go there. How would I get there? SCP-6060: Follow your heart. You'll know when you're halfway there.",
        "Researcher Prescott: Candela, Candela wake up. Candela: Suzie\u2026? What time is it? Researcher Prescott: Candela, get up. We have to go. Candela: Go? Researcher Prescott: The others will be asleep for a while, but the security system will reset far too soon. We have to go. Candela: You mean\u2026? Researcher Prescott: You're getting out of here. Candela: Oh my god. Oh my god, this is incredible, I\u2013 thank you, Suzie. I can't believe it, we're getting out of here, you'll get away from the Foundation, I'll get to show you my home\u2013! Researcher Prescott: No, Candela. You're getting out. I have to stay behind. Candela: \u2026What? But, why? Researcher Prescott: We don't have time for this. Candela: But without my tissue\u2026 you'll die. Researcher Prescott: I'll be fine. Candela: Bullshit. Researcher Prescott: I got by for many years without you. I've been saving up samples, I'll be fine for a bit. Candela: But the Foundation will suspect you. Researcher Prescott: They'll suspect me if I leave, too. And if I go with you they might find you again. They'd never stop searching. Please, Candela, you have a chance to leave this place, and I have a chance to make sure they never hurt anyone again. Candela: That shouldn't be your responsibility. Researcher Prescott: I know. But I'm the only one who can do it. Candela: \u2026Thank you Suzie. I'll\u2026 never forget what you've done for me. Researcher Prescott: Go.",
        "Dr. Ozwald: It\u2019s come to my attention that SCP-6060 has escaped. I hate to point fingers, but the sign\u2014 Researcher Prescott: It was me. No need to drag it out. Dr. Kline: I knew we shouldn't have trusted a promethean with 6060. Dr. Ozwald: Hey, Suzie\u2019s part of the Foundation just like us. Researcher Prescott: Am I? Dr. Ozwald: What is that supposed to mean? Of\u2014 Researcher Prescott: The more time I spent with Candela, I came to realize something. Dr. Kline: Candela? You\u2019re using its name now? Researcher Prescott: Then just call me SCP-6060-1. Because we\u2019re not that different. Candela\u2026 she\u2019s like me, an outcast within a world built against that idea. Dr. Ozwald: You\u2019re not an outcast. Researcher Prescott: You don\u2019t treat me normally. It\u2019s like\u2014 I\u2019m technically still human! I\u2026 I\u2019d ask why I have more rights than Candela, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not even allowed to leave. I\u2019m just another anomaly you have control over. Researcher. Youl: But you\u2019re one of our friends! D-don\u2019t say that stuff! [pause] What\u2019s gotten into you? Researcher Prescott: It\u2019s not what\u2019s gotten into me. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been holding in. I never commented on this unfairness because I owed you my life. I figured the Foundation knew what was best for me. But Candela\u2026 I learned so much talking to her. All I had to do was talk to her like she was worthy of my attention, because she was. Not some object to be locked up. Researcher Youl: Suzie\u2014 Researcher Prescott: What are we even doing? We\u2019ve found like two or three things that are anomalous now, and just perform stupid tests that teach us nothing. Just face it, there\u2019s no need for the Foundation anymore. Dr. Kline: That\u2019s ridiculous! We have learned things! And we can con\u2014 Dr. Ozwald: Suzie\u2019s right. Researcher Youl: What? Dr. Ozwald: Why do you even care about the Foundation, Bella? You weren\u2019t alive. Dr. Kline: Why can\u2019t I care about the restoration of civility just because I wasn\u2019t alive then? Researcher Prescott: Do you feel guilty for being alive? Dr. Kline: What? What kind of question is that\u2014 Researcher Youl: You did start acting more hostile when we found 6060. Dr. Ozwald: So did you, Jean. Researcher Youl: I\u2019m not letting you drag this out. Fine, I\u2019m jealous of 6060. Aren\u2019t we all? She got to keep her humanity while we\u2019re all stuck like this for some dumbass reason. Dr. Ozwald: I haven\u2019t even talked to the rest of the team. But, it looks like we\u2019re just operating on longing of what we want. That\u2019s no way to respect this organization. Dr. Kline: Cleavlend\u2026 Researcher Prescott: We never needed to secure Candela. All it did was break apart the stability we were pretending to have. It\u2019s sad that it took this long to realize. Researcher Youl: What\u2026 what do we do now? Dr. Ozwald: Stop pretending. [end log]"
