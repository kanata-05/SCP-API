In the event of suspected damage or trespass, staff will equip SCRAMBLE\n1\n gear before conducting an advanced sweep and re-establishing containment.\n\n\nWhen SCP-4784-1 is not undergoing testing, the anomaly is to be concealed beneath a weighted blackout tarp, secured at each corner by a steel peg. Crossing the ten-meter safety demarcation line without SCRAMBLE protection is strictly prohibited.\n\n\nPersonnel with histories of depression, dissociation, and/or suicidal ideation are strongly discouraged from entering Area-94.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening title card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing title card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-4784 is a one-hectare parcel of land thirteen kilometers southeast of Hornor's Crossing, Ontario, fully enclosed by the Area-94 perimeter fence. Most territory within SCP-4784 is dense with trees, with the exception of a meadow at the approximate center of the property, thirty meters across at its widest point. As surrounding terrain is dominated by forest, brush and swampland, this area can be reached solely by controlled roadway, while the interior meadow is accessible by footpath.\n\n\nSCP-4784-1 is an anomalous art installation at the center of the meadow, angled away from the secure point of entry. The focal point of the piece is an artificial rendering of a solid-state console television with a thirty-two-inch color screen and integrated speakers. It is positioned on an inclined stone plinth, three feet at its highest elevation, surrounded by a bed of artificial red roses. While all of the above objects are superficially identical to mundane analogues, they are completely immune to erosion by weather, resist attempts at manual interference, and defy material analysis. Additionally, the articulated dials on the television's \"control panel\" serve no function, and the thorns on the artificial roses have sharpness comparable to razor wire. These anomalies can thus be described as simulacra: creative representations of real objects.\n\n\nThe television screen integrated in SCP-4784-1 will remain inert unless the anomaly detects physical motion within a radius of fifty meters, at which point it will enter its active state. The anomaly begins displaying a multitude of audiovisual patterns coordinated with interlocking anomalous effects, broadly designated SCP-4784-2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttract Sequence\n\n\nSustained bursts of audiovisual static, interspersed with assorted still images of landscapes (predominantly forest, arctic, desert, and ocean scenes), extreme close-ups of human features, mineral compositions, and rendered fractals.\n\n\nAny unprotected observers with a clear line of sight are affected by a mild compulsion\n2\n to draw nearer.\n\n\n\nAnyone approaching within five meters of the screen will become an instance of SCP-4784-2\u03c3, vulnerable to the anomaly's Primary Sequence. Beyond this stage, instances will not look away unless a third party physically intervenes, breaking the trance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Sequence\n\n\nFade through black to resolve on a title card. The text reads:\n\n\n\n\"\nUNWINDING\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\"A Film by The Developer\"\n\n\n\nThe background is a swimming, textured field of blue and green, interspersed with random noise.\n\n\nSCP-4784-2\u03c3 will adopt a stationary position, sitting or standing, and maintain visual contact with the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Sequence\n\n\nSemi-individualized presentation of still images and video, five minutes and twenty-three seconds in length.\n\n\n\nFor the first two minutes, SCP-4784-2 displays reactive visuals based on the subject's personal life, cultural background, and historical period. After the first forty-six seconds, these are rapidly and increasingly juxtaposed with renderings of human suffering, violence and social neglect,\n3\n interspersed with images of undisturbed natural habitats.\n\n\n\nAfter two minutes and twenty-three seconds, the timescale increases dramatically, with stylized visuals alluding to the passage of evolutionary, geologic, and cosmological time; recorded imagery alludes to the evolution of single-celled organisms\n4\n, the formation of the Milky Way galaxy\n5\n, and the cosmic \"Dark Age\".\n6\n\n\n01:20\n: Third-party intervention is rendered impossible as SCP-4784-2\u03c3 begins to \"fade\" from material existence. This effect begins in the head and torso, which become increasingly translucent, spreading outwards to the extremities in irregular waves.\n\n\n\n\n02:31\n: SCP-4784-2\u03c3 begins to \"despool\" along their central axis in a manner similar to textiles or film reels being unwound. An expanding, continuous \"strip\" of the body becomes entirely translucent, while the remainder is gradually overwritten by static.\n\n\n\n\n03:52\n: At approximately 30% visibility, SCP-4784-2\u03c3 begins to ripple and tear vertically in a manner similar to television scan lines. This effect intensifies until SCP-4784-2\u03c3 dematerializes completely at 05:23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcluding Sequence\n\n\nIris out on a blooming rose, surrounded by an expanding ring of cursive text:\n\n\n\n\n\"If Only It \nWere\n The End\u2026\"\n\n\n\"Are We Cool Yet?\"\n\n\n\nFade to black.\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Sequence\n\n\nIris in on a rose dying, then coming back to life in reverse.\n\n\n\nIndividualized presentation plays in accelerated reverse speed, compressed to ninety-two seconds in length.\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstances of SCP-4784-2\u03c3 interrupted prior to the Primary Sequence experience severe disorientation, mild derealization and depressive symptoms for approximately three hours, but suffer no long-term damage. Despite the implication that dematerialized instances of SCP-4784-2\u03c3 are intended to rematerialize after the Secondary Sequence, such an effect has never been observed by Foundation staff.\n\n\nSCP-4784-3 is a simulated document on the outer perimeter of the meadow, adjacent to the entry footpath. The object physically resembles a leather-bound guestbook with glossy paper, resting atop a pedestal in an open position; however, the anomaly does not have any pages beyond its surface. SCP-4784-3 will update with the full legal names of any dematerialized instances of SCP-4784-2\u03c3. Upon initial containment, it carried the following message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNWINDING\n\n\nFeaturing Special Guest Stars:\n\n\n\n\nClementia Schweiger\n\nToni Vitela\n\nKathleen Stich\n\nDavid Aylmer Brock\n\nDevon Sundi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't realize. I'm so sorry.\n\nI don't want to be cool.\n\n\nGoodbye.\n\nAnna Bojarski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to its acquisition by the Foundation, SCP-4784 was owned by \"Apollinaire Acquisitions\", a defunct front company tied to anomalous artist collective \"\nAre We Cool Yet\n?\" The five \"guest stars\" listed above have been linked to various AWCY cells across North America. Schweiger, Brock, and Sundi were all graduates of \nDeer College\n, and lived together in \nThree Portlands\n until their disappearance in 2008. This was previously attributed to death by suicide due to a co-signed, handwritten message found in their home.\n\n\nAccording to extant records, Anna Bojarski was a sophomore student at Deer College until she stopped attending anart classes in 2008. Bojarski was struggling in all her coursework and was behind on tuition payments at the time of her disappearance; other identifying information pertaining to Bojarski is missing from her student file, and no photographic evidence has been found in any Deer College yearbooks. At this time, the Foundation believes that Anna Bojarski (AKA \"The Developer\") was a casualty of her own prototype at a closed exhibition facilitated by AWCY.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-1:\u00a0Pre-Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a0(\"Stark\u00a0Collection\u00a0Tip\")\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-1:\u00a0Pre-Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a0(\"Stark\u00a0Collection\u00a0Tip\")\n\n\n\n\nThe first evidence of SCP-4784 was discovered in a photo album assembled by Luther Stark (1953-2015), an underground documentarian with known anartist ties. Stark's collection contained photographic and illustrative evidence of more than thirty anomalies, \u2588\u2588 of which were hitherto unknown to the Foundation.\n\n\nThe album was recovered by members of MTF Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") following a telephone tip by PoI-6966\n7\n on 2019/07/03:\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Call>\n\n\nOperator\n: You've reached the NYC Information Desk. How can I help you?\n\n\nPoI-6966\n: Hi! My name is Wren Masterson. \"Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen King\u2026\" (pause) Uh, actually, no. Bad idea.\n\n\nOperator\n: Ma'am?\n\n\nPoI-6966\n: Nope, not a \"ma'am\". This line does \"lost and found\", right? Well, I've definitely found\u2026 \nsomething\n.\n\n\nOperator\n: Sir, that's not\u2026\n\n\nPoI-6966\n: Not a \"sir\", either, \nplease stop guessing.\n (pause) I was going through the stacks in the NY Public Library, minding my own business, and this thing was on the shelf. Photo album. Really jumped out at me. (pause, followed by sigh) Wow, this NSA shit takes a while huh. Don't mind me, I'm just gonna start rattling off some names from this book.\n\n\nOperator\n: Wh-\n\n\nPoI-6966\n: \nLuisa Bellocchio\n. \"\nTAZ-018\n\". \"\nThe Spider and The Fly\n\". Uh, a whole lot of these are signed \"Are We Cool Yet?\" and most of \nthem\n look\u2026 unpleasant. \"Treachery of Euclids\", what the fuck is \nthat\n, a Magritte pastiche? Weak. \nProfessor Xorkanoff\n\u2026 well, \nhe\n looks chill, at least.\n\n\nOperator\n: I'm not sure what y-\n\n\n[The operator is disconnected by Foundation AI ATLS-12, which has traced the call to a pay phone near the New York Public Library.]\n\n\nPoI-6966\n: Finally. Howdy, \nofficers\n.\n\n\n[There is an audible mechanical click. The rest of PoI-6966's speech contains background noise consistent with a mundane microcassette recording.]\n\n\nPoI-6966\n (playback): Never thought this day would come. I've found something weird and artsy and interesting that is \ndefinitely not for public consumption\n. Hell, I don't even want it in \nmy\n library, let alone the NYPL, but I can't return it to the shelf, because that would be irresponsible, and I can't destroy it, because this could obviously be useful to \nsomeone\n and I have \ncertain problems\n with bookburners! It's a conundrum. Solution: give it to y'all. Consider it a gift. Been hearing horror stories about janitors for more than a decade, but you're supposedly about containment, and flipping through this book, I see things that should \nabsolutely\n be contained, if they aren't already. Maybe it'll help if you have an index, even if this one is, like\u2026 \"Tourist Grandpa's Artsy Guide to Trigger Warnings\". Yeesh.\n\n\nI'm going to bag this thing and leave it under the bench, right by this phone, and you can come get it. I'll be long gone, of course. I don't want you to grab me again\u2026 \nwhat,\n did you really think I wouldn't notice a fat twelve-hour gap in my memory? I might be a little scatterbrained, but I'm not stupid. I'm actually quite careful, and to the best of my knowledge, there's only \none\n thing that's really, truly missing from my collection. Given how I lost it, y'all have almost certainly got it packed away in a white box somewhere. Yeah?\n\n\nThere's a quid pro quo, you see. I want my \nDead Kennedys album\n back.\n\n\n[There is another click, then a clattering noise, as the phone is returned to its cradle.]\n\n\n<End Call>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-2:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0(\"Tilford's\u00a0Folly\")\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-2:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0(\"Tilford's\u00a0Folly\")\n\n\n\n\nDuring initial containment, Foundation assets sought background information from local residents under the auspices of Standard Cover Story 302 (\"Legal Eagles\"), presenting themselves as representatives of the Ontario government. The following transcript summarizes a 2019/07/20 interview between Agent Calvin Harris and by Felix Kipp, local branch librarian and amateur historian, whose domicile was three kilometers west of SCP-4784.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Calvin Harris\n: Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Mr. Kipp.\n\n\nFelix Kipp\n: Oh, it's my pleasure. We don't get a lot of new faces in these parts, and my patrons have heard all the best stories already. Multiple times, in fact. (laughing) How can I help you today?\n\n\nHarris\n: Well, my ministry is looking into some land use and zoning irregularities. Do you know anything about a plot of land a few kilometers east of your property? It was purchased by a private company in 2008.\n\n\nKipp\n: You mean Tilford's Folly. Sure. I would never have realized anyone owned it, if not for Myra, the county clerk; she filled me in. (pause) At length.\n\n\nHarris\n: (shuffling papers) I wasn't aware it had a local name. What can you tell me about it?\n\n\nKipp\n: Nothing, really. Everyone knows it, but no one visits. Nothing to see. The terrain is too rough for development, so nobody bothers trying.\n\n\nHarris\n: Have you ever seen anyone in or around \"Tilford's Folly\"?\n\n\nKipp\n: Nope.\n\n\nHarris\n: Are you sure? I understand there are a lot of deer around here. Maybe hunters-\n\n\nKipp\n: (laughing) No, no. Nobody hunts in Tilford's Folly. Not for a very long time. (pause) Actually, do you want to hear the story behind the name? I warn you, it's a little\u2026 strange.\n\n\nHarris\n: Absolutely. Weird tales are my favorite.\n\n\nKipp\n: (laughing) To each their own. I prefer conventional mysteries over urban legends; they've got nice neat endings, and this one is something of an anticlimax. (clearing throat) Regardless. That place is called \"Tilford's Folly\" because of a murder, back in the winter of 1886. Nobody around here actually \nknew\n the victim; he was just a dead body, blasted close-range with a shotgun.\n8\n Not even buried, just dumped on some fallen branches. It took them a while to figure out who he was, and even when they did, the circumstances didn't make a lot of sense.\n\n\nSamuel Tilford was an Englishman. He was privileged, if not truly affluent, but he was also a disaffected romantic type who wanted to make his own way. According to his family in Britain, Tilford corresponded with a landowner outside Hornor's Crossing \u2014 a farmer who couldn't handle the whole job on his own, and was looking for a partner. Tilford traveled to Canada, spent a few days in Niagara Falls, and then boom! Dead in the swamp, like he dropped out of the sky.\n\n\nThe next month\n9\n, the police declared they'd nabbed the perpetrator. Claimed that he lured Tilford to Hornor's Crossing as a sort of investment scam: there was no farm, no house, just a victim with money and a man who wanted it. This man met up with Tilford, took him on a \"hunting trip\" to show him the surrounding territory, then blew his guts out and left him dead in the woods. There was a confession, a trial, a hanging, and a burial. Then it was done, and there didn't seem to be any point to any of it. Hence, \"Tilford's Folly\". A senseless waste of life. (pause) Now\u2026 the \nstrange\n part. Everyone knows about the murder around here, because it's the most memorable chapter of our town's history. But \nabsolutely no one knows the murderer.\n\n\nHarris\n: I thought you said he was caught, tried and executed.\n\n\nKipp\n: Oh, he was! It was in all the papers, along with details of the confession. Lots of people turned up to watch the hanging, and they all reported the same thing: the killer asphyxiated on the gallows.\n10\n But in all the documents I've ever seen, primary and secondary, contemporaneous or otherwise, \nno one refers to the man by name\n. He's always \"the accused\", or \"the murderer\", or \"the convict\".\n\n\nHarris\n: Photographs? Descriptions?\n\n\nKipp\n: None. Some claim that there was a painting, completed sometime after the trial, but nobody's ever found it. There'd be all sorts of hullabaloo if they did!\n\n\nHarris\n: Was the killer buried near here?\n\n\nKipp\n: The body was \nsupposedly\n interred in the prison cemetery, but all those graves are marked, and he's not there. They did a site survey in the sixties. Nothing.\n\n\nHarris\n: So\u2026 there's no physical evidence of the perpetrator? What about the victim?\n\n\nKipp\n: Oh, there was definitely a \nvictim\n. There are photographs of the scene, and of the cadaver. That's how they identified Samuel Tilford, actually; they put a picture in the paper, and after he was recognized, they sent the body back to England, where he was buried in a family plot.\n\n\nHarris\n: What about Tilford's correspondence with the killer?\n\n\nKipp\n: The letters have never been found. It's all based on the family's written testimony.\n\n\nHarris\n: Huh. You weren't kidding about it being strange. (pause) Any theories?\n\n\nKipp\n: (laughing) Well of course! There are lots. All conjecture. None actually track.\n\n\nHarris\n: Some kind of cover-up?\n\n\nKipp\n: Obviously, since the killer has been so thoroughly erased. I'm tempted to draw a parallel between this and those awful shootings I see on the news; they censor the perpetrator's name, to deny them glory or satisfaction or notoriety.\n\n\nHarris\n: This was only one death, though.\n\n\nKipp\n: Yes, that's where the parallel falls apart. This crime was shocking, but not truly grotesque, more\u2026 inelegant. Leaving a corpse in a clearing when there's swamp and brush all around, that's rather clumsy. As for the parties involved, neither men were known in town, but Samuel Tilford was a \nnovelty\n. An Englishman, dead in Canada! Great Scott, by jove, and other such things! The press was beside themselves and the authorities needed a perpetrator. Tilford certainly didn't shoot \nhimself\n out there in the swamp, dump his own body, and dispose of the gun.\n\n\nNow, I \ndo\n like mysteries, but I don't have much regard for police. (pause) Don't make that face at me, young man, I know what I've seen and I know what I've read. Police detectives \nclose cases\n, it's what they do. They take a smattering of clues and try to piece them into a convenient whole, and it doesn't always work, because they don't really care about being \nright\n, just being \ndone\n. Whether they \nsolve\n anything is another question entirely. I think the most plausible explanation for all this mystery is just\u2026 they caught \nsomeone\n. Not necessarily someone guilty. They beat a confession out of him. It didn't make sense, but it stuck, so he hanged. They may not have been ashamed, but\u2026 they certainly covered their tracks.\n\n\n[The interviewee's dog enters the room. Becoming aware of Agent Harris, the dog barks twice, then approaches.]\n\n\nKipp\n: Oh, and here's Ben! Sorry, don't mind him \u2014 he's friendly, just old and blind.\n\n\nHarris\n: No need to apologize, sir. May I pet him?\n\n\nKipp\n: By all means.\n\n\nHarris\n: Well, I very much appreciate the background information. I do have another question, though.\n\n\nKipp\n: Shoot.\n\n\nHarris\n: During our site survey, we found a\u2026 junk heap, out in \"Tilford's Folly\". It was covered up with a tarp and a layer of netting, secured with cinderblocks.\n\n\nKipp\n: Oh? Left by those absentee owners, no doubt.\n\n\nHarris\n: That's what we think. (pause) You're certain that you've never seen anyone near that property? No hunters, no maintenance men, nobody?\n\n\nKipp\n: Absolutely. The view from my window is hardly universal, but it's generally pretty peaceful. Not a lot of movement over there, aside from deer, squirrels and birds.\n\n\nHarris\n: See, that's very odd, because the property was purchased in 2008. The tarp and net are weathered, but they're definitely not that old. (pause) In fact, according to a tag in the lining, the tarp was made in 2012.\n\n\nKipp\n: Hmm. Are you suggesting that someone's been\u2026 \nwandering around out there?\n (pause) Heavens! I really ought to lock my doors. Ben isn't a very good guard dog.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement\n: The above historical details regarding \"Tilford's Folly\" have been independently corroborated by Foundation researchers. The 1886 death of Samuel Tilford and the murderer's subsequent capture and execution were extensively documented in the contemporary press, yet no documentary or material evidence of the killer's identity has been found.\n\n\n\n\nFelix Kipp died in a household accident three days after his interview with Agent Harris. Forensics specialists ruled the incident non-anomalous, and the Foundation has since acquired the property as a discreet Observation Post overlooking Area-94.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-3:\u00a0Memorandum\u00a0(\"Backscatter\")\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a04784-3:\u00a0Memorandum\u00a0(\"Backscatter\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur theory is that \"Tilford's Folly\" is the narrative backscatter from a vastly overpowered pataphysical weapon. I can't provide you with a full and thorough explanation of how it works, because said knowledge would probably kill us too; here's a nice safe analogy, instead.\n\n\nImagine a pistol. Pick it up and put it to your temple and pull the trigger. You are dead. End scenario.\n\n\nNow obviously, you aren't dead, because this is a thought experiment. But what if you don't know that? What if this takes place within a simulation so perfect, you fervently and completely believe in your own death? Well, it still won't kill you, because you are real and the pistol is not. Thinking about suicide is painful, and that anguish grinds people down, but ideation is not action, and we cannot destroy ourselves with fictional bullets.\n\n\nExcept these people did. How?\n\n\nRather than a pistol, imagine a shotgun. This death would be messy, and I don't just mean gory: pellets would bounce around everywhere, and since they're tougher and faster than anything nearby, they would get embedded in the surrounding crime scene.\n\n\n\"Tilford's Folly\" is that crime scene. Some mystery man may have pulled a trigger in 1886, but \nUnwinding\n was the shotgun, and it was fired in 2008. We could accurately term this a retrocausal effect, but \nUnwinding\n is not a time machine; it is art, and art has fewer rules. Look at the parallels. These deaths were all staged in an open, natural space; no victims were local to Hornor's Crossing, but we know about their lives; the same cannot be said of the perpetrator in 1886, or Anna Bojarski. With those gaps in her student record, we have no biographical information, no photos, no known address. The only thing left is \"The Developer's\" imaginary shotgun, an infinite supply of conceptual ammunition\u2026 and a cluster of plot holes where people used to be.\n\n\nDon't look in the chamber.

My name is Wren Masterson. \"Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen King\u2026\" (pause) Uh, actually, no. Bad idea. Operator : Ma'am? PoI-6966 : Nope, not a \"ma'am\". This line does \"lost and found\", right? Well, I've definitely found\u2026 something . Operator : Sir, that's not\u2026 PoI-6966 : Not a \"sir\", either, please stop guessing. (pause) I was going through the stacks in the NY Public Library, minding my own business, and this thing was on the shelf. Photo album. Really jumped out at me. (pause, followed by sigh) Wow, this NSA shit takes a while huh. Don't mind me, I'm just gonna start rattling off some names from this book. Operator : Wh- PoI-6966 : Luisa Bellocchio . \" TAZ-018 \". \" The Spider and The Fly \". Uh, a whole lot of these are signed \"Are We Cool Yet?\" and most of them look\u2026 unpleasant. \"Treachery of Euclids\", what the fuck is that , a Magritte pastiche? Weak. Professor Xorkanoff \u2026 well, he looks chill, at least. Operator : I'm not sure what y- [The operator is disconnected by Foundation AI ATLS-12, which has traced the call to a pay phone near the New York Public Library.] PoI-6966 : Finally. Howdy, officers . [There is an audible mechanical click. The rest of PoI-6966's speech contains background noise consistent with a mundane microcassette recording.] PoI-6966 (playback): Never thought this day would come. I've found something weird and artsy and interesting that is definitely not for public consumption . Hell, I don't even want it in my library, let alone the NYPL, but I can't return it to the shelf, because that would be irresponsible, and I can't destroy it, because this could obviously be useful to someone and I have certain problems with bookburners! It's a conundrum. Solution: give it to y'all. Consider it a gift. Been hearing horror stories about janitors for more than a decade, but you're supposedly about containment, and flipping through this book, I see things that should absolutely be contained, if they aren't already. Maybe it'll help if you have an index, even if this one is, like\u2026 \"Tourist Grandpa's Artsy Guide to Trigger Warnings\". Yeesh. I'm going to bag this thing and leave it under the bench, right by this phone, and you can come get it. I'll be long gone, of course. I don't want you to grab me again\u2026 what, did you really think I wouldn't notice a fat twelve-hour gap in my memory? I might be a little scatterbrained, but I'm not stupid. I'm actually quite careful, and to the best of my knowledge, there's only one thing that's really, truly missing from my collection. Given how I lost it, y'all have almost certainly got it packed away in a white box somewhere. Yeah? There's a quid pro quo, you see. I want my Dead Kennedys album back. [There is another click, then a clattering noise, as the phone is returned to its cradle.] <End Call>",
        "<Begin Log> Agent Calvin Harris : Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Mr. Kipp. Felix Kipp : Oh, it's my pleasure. We don't get a lot of new faces in these parts, and my patrons have heard all the best stories already. Multiple times, in fact. (laughing) How can I help you today? Harris : Well, my ministry is looking into some land use and zoning irregularities. Do you know anything about a plot of land a few kilometers east of your property? It was purchased by a private company in 2008. Kipp : You mean Tilford's Folly. Sure. I would never have realized anyone owned it, if not for Myra, the county clerk; she filled me in. (pause) At length. Harris : (shuffling papers) I wasn't aware it had a local name. What can you tell me about it? Kipp : Nothing, really. Everyone knows it, but no one visits. Nothing to see. The terrain is too rough for development, so nobody bothers trying. Harris : Have you ever seen anyone in or around \"Tilford's Folly\"? Kipp : Nope. Harris : Are you sure? I understand there are a lot of deer around here. Maybe hunters- Kipp : (laughing) No, no. Nobody hunts in Tilford's Folly. Not for a very long time. (pause) Actually, do you want to hear the story behind the name? I warn you, it's a little\u2026 strange. Harris : Absolutely. Weird tales are my favorite. Kipp : (laughing) To each their own. I prefer conventional mysteries over urban legends; they've got nice neat endings, and this one is something of an anticlimax. (clearing throat) Regardless. That place is called \"Tilford's Folly\" because of a murder, back in the winter of 1886. Nobody around here actually knew the victim; he was just a dead body, blasted close-range with a shotgun. 8 Not even buried, just dumped on some fallen branches. It took them a while to figure out who he was, and even when they did, the circumstances didn't make a lot of sense. Samuel Tilford was an Englishman. He was privileged, if not truly affluent, but he was also a disaffected romantic type who wanted to make his own way. According to his family in Britain, Tilford corresponded with a landowner outside Hornor's Crossing \u2014 a farmer who couldn't handle the whole job on his own, and was looking for a partner. Tilford traveled to Canada, spent a few days in Niagara Falls, and then boom! Dead in the swamp, like he dropped out of the sky. The next month 9 , the police declared they'd nabbed the perpetrator. Claimed that he lured Tilford to Hornor's Crossing as a sort of investment scam: there was no farm, no house, just a victim with money and a man who wanted it. This man met up with Tilford, took him on a \"hunting trip\" to show him the surrounding territory, then blew his guts out and left him dead in the woods. There was a confession, a trial, a hanging, and a burial. Then it was done, and there didn't seem to be any point to any of it. Hence, \"Tilford's Folly\". A senseless waste of life. (pause) Now\u2026 the strange part. Everyone knows about the murder around here, because it's the most memorable chapter of our town's history. But absolutely no one knows the murderer. Harris : I thought you said he was caught, tried and executed. Kipp : Oh, he was! It was in all the papers, along with details of the confession. Lots of people turned up to watch the hanging, and they all reported the same thing: the killer asphyxiated on the gallows. 10 But in all the documents I've ever seen, primary and secondary, contemporaneous or otherwise, no one refers to the man by name . He's always \"the accused\", or \"the murderer\", or \"the convict\". Harris : Photographs? Descriptions? Kipp : None. Some claim that there was a painting, completed sometime after the trial, but nobody's ever found it. There'd be all sorts of hullabaloo if they did! Harris : Was the killer buried near here? Kipp : The body was supposedly interred in the prison cemetery, but all those graves are marked, and he's not there. They did a site survey in the sixties. Nothing. Harris : So\u2026 there's no physical evidence of the perpetrator? What about the victim? Kipp : Oh, there was definitely a victim . There are photographs of the scene, and of the cadaver. That's how they identified Samuel Tilford, actually; they put a picture in the paper, and after he was recognized, they sent the body back to England, where he was buried in a family plot. Harris : What about Tilford's correspondence with the killer? Kipp : The letters have never been found. It's all based on the family's written testimony. Harris : Huh. You weren't kidding about it being strange. (pause) Any theories? Kipp : (laughing) Well of course! There are lots. All conjecture. None actually track. Harris : Some kind of cover-up? Kipp : Obviously, since the killer has been so thoroughly erased. I'm tempted to draw a parallel between this and those awful shootings I see on the news; they censor the perpetrator's name, to deny them glory or satisfaction or notoriety. Harris : This was only one death, though. Kipp : Yes, that's where the parallel falls apart. This crime was shocking, but not truly grotesque, more\u2026 inelegant. Leaving a corpse in a clearing when there's swamp and brush all around, that's rather clumsy. As for the parties involved, neither men were known in town, but Samuel Tilford was a novelty . An Englishman, dead in Canada! Great Scott, by jove, and other such things! The press was beside themselves and the authorities needed a perpetrator. Tilford certainly didn't shoot himself out there in the swamp, dump his own body, and dispose of the gun. Now, I do like mysteries, but I don't have much regard for police. (pause) Don't make that face at me, young man, I know what I've seen and I know what I've read. Police detectives close cases , it's what they do. They take a smattering of clues and try to piece them into a convenient whole, and it doesn't always work, because they don't really care about being right , just being done . Whether they solve anything is another question entirely. I think the most plausible explanation for all this mystery is just\u2026 they caught someone . Not necessarily someone guilty. They beat a confession out of him. It didn't make sense, but it stuck, so he hanged. They may not have been ashamed, but\u2026 they certainly covered their tracks. [The interviewee's dog enters the room. Becoming aware of Agent Harris, the dog barks twice, then approaches.] Kipp : Oh, and here's Ben! Sorry, don't mind him \u2014 he's friendly, just old and blind. Harris : No need to apologize, sir. May I pet him? Kipp : By all means. Harris : Well, I very much appreciate the background information. I do have another question, though. Kipp : Shoot. Harris : During our site survey, we found a\u2026 junk heap, out in \"Tilford's Folly\". It was covered up with a tarp and a layer of netting, secured with cinderblocks. Kipp : Oh? Left by those absentee owners, no doubt. Harris : That's what we think. (pause) You're certain that you've never seen anyone near that property? No hunters, no maintenance men, nobody? Kipp : Absolutely. The view from my window is hardly universal, but it's generally pretty peaceful. Not a lot of movement over there, aside from deer, squirrels and birds. Harris : See, that's very odd, because the property was purchased in 2008. The tarp and net are weathered, but they're definitely not that old. (pause) In fact, according to a tag in the lining, the tarp was made in 2012. Kipp : Hmm. Are you suggesting that someone's been\u2026 wandering around out there? (pause) Heavens! I really ought to lock my doors. Ben isn't a very good guard dog. <End Log> Closing Statement : The above historical details regarding \"Tilford's Folly\" have been independently corroborated by Foundation researchers. The 1886 death of Samuel Tilford and the murderer's subsequent capture and execution were extensively documented in the contemporary press, yet no documentary or material evidence of the killer's identity has been found.",
        "Our theory is that \"Tilford's Folly\" is the narrative backscatter from a vastly overpowered pataphysical weapon. I can't provide you with a full and thorough explanation of how it works, because said knowledge would probably kill us too; here's a nice safe analogy, instead. Imagine a pistol. Pick it up and put it to your temple and pull the trigger. You are dead. End scenario. Now obviously, you aren't dead, because this is a thought experiment. But what if you don't know that? What if this takes place within a simulation so perfect, you fervently and completely believe in your own death? Well, it still won't kill you, because you are real and the pistol is not. Thinking about suicide is painful, and that anguish grinds people down, but ideation is not action, and we cannot destroy ourselves with fictional bullets. Except these people did. How? Rather than a pistol, imagine a shotgun. This death would be messy, and I don't just mean gory: pellets would bounce around everywhere, and since they're tougher and faster than anything nearby, they would get embedded in the surrounding crime scene. \"Tilford's Folly\" is that crime scene. Some mystery man may have pulled a trigger in 1886, but Unwinding was the shotgun, and it was fired in 2008. We could accurately term this a retrocausal effect, but Unwinding is not a time machine; it is art, and art has fewer rules. Look at the parallels. These deaths were all staged in an open, natural space; no victims were local to Hornor's Crossing, but we know about their lives; the same cannot be said of the perpetrator in 1886, or Anna Bojarski. With those gaps in her student record, we have no biographical information, no photos, no known address. The only thing left is \"The Developer's\" imaginary shotgun, an infinite supply of conceptual ammunition\u2026 and a cluster of plot holes where people used to be. Don't look in the chamber. This show may not end with a literal bang, but it definitely ends. - Dr. Michelle Wilkes , Department of Pataphysics",
