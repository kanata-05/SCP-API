The structure of SCP-4911 follows drystack techniques, common for retaining walls during the Neolithic Age. SCP-4911 is made up of a variety of dark and light colored stones, totaling to 5,203. There are three distinctly patterned sections in SCP-4911, with some occasional protrusions. Removal or damage to the stones of SCP-4911 is not possible and not advised.\n\n\nSCP-4911 exhibits strong mnestic properties. Visitors to SCP-4911 and the mound will remember vivid details about the area, and also be aware of the precise number of the 5,203 stones of SCP-4911. The significance of the number is unclear. The memories produced by SCP-4911 have been resistant to all known forms of amnestic treatments.\n\n\nBehind SCP-4911, at the top of the mound, is a single stone plinth inscribed with deteriorated runes. Thaumaturgic analysis indicate that if the runes were properly maintained, they would have been used to keep a permanent flame at the top of the plinth.\n\n\nOther than the plinth, no other inscriptions are found around SCP-4911. All historical records of SCP-4911 describe the area in its current state; no historical records have indicated the function or reason of SCP-4911.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4911\n\" by Joreth, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
