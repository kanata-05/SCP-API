Containment procedures and descriptors/identifiers with certain terms listed in reference to an anomalous designation of this type may or may not hypothetically reinforce the continued existence of the anomaly in question, which does or does not exist. It may or may not be necessary to interject any potentially certain statement regarding SCP-7079's assigned anomaly, whatever it may be, were it to exist, with diluting or vagueifying statements. Due to the possible nature of this so-called anomaly, the presence of such statements may or may not be indicative of the existence of said nebulous \"anomalous designation\", which can and cannot be meaningfully confirmed.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis document is to be kept as a placeholder in the slot for which it was chosen, and must not deviate from this distinction at any time.\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS, OF SORTS:\n SCP-7079 does or does not exist. If it were to exist, which is unknown at this time, it would likely\n4\n be an anomaly focused on a probabilistic or non-probabilistic effect triggered by some vector perhaps implied to be present in the standard formatting and flow of an \"\"\"\"SCP Document\"\"\"\", necessitating atypical semantics to avoid such things.\n5\n Despite this, it is unknown if it is known if any such effects have been confirmed to a satisfactory degree at time of writing. It is only known what may or may not be acceptable verbiage, and the degree by which this is known to be true is unknown.

It might, though. It might not, but it might.\n\n\nIf it \nwere\n to exist, which is an irrelevant hypothetical considering it can/cannot and will/will not be known, to you or to anyone and you and everyone, it could be suspected to have not been discovered at all, or perhaps been discovered by personnel of \natypical configuration\n, necessitating this document be conveyed in its current form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's my cue.\n\n\n\n\nThe grounds of Synecdoche (Research Station Synecdoche, but you can just call it Synecdoche) are not like your typical Foundation site. Or at least, so I've heard. I don't know what a \"typical Foundation site\" is, even though I've seen many. You'd be surprised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I could try to explain how the inner chambers of Synecdoche turn inwards like spirals, I will not. I could mention that the floors are made of logical swiss cheese, that is to say they possess more logical gaps than your swiss cheese has holes, yet I refuse. Such trivialities serve no purpose to anyone other than Surrealistics, and even that much cannot be said. Purpose, a fickle thing, is not found on agnostics. Surrealistics don't need it. We only need Perspective, and separation from these things creates Perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis day was the first in a long while I'd left Synecdoche, that spiral-room-cheese-floor secure site. It's comfier than you'd think, especially with Fourfold as the primary alternative. It's like the Four Seasons. I presume. Never been, but that's never stopped me from envisioning a hotel containing all four seasons. Seems pretty neat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'd been assigned a mission, and that's why I am here. \"Here\", being not \"there\", Synecdoche, being not \"elsewhere\", elsewhere. I was sent \"here\" to recover an agent from \"elsewhere\" and am relaying this info to \"here\", you, not \"there\" or \"elsewhere\". It's all rather jarring, but given that jarring is quite common and inoffensive to Surrealistics, it was a comforting feeling. Besides, it's not every day you get to meet an agent that doesn't exist. Or, at least, didn't exist. What do you call something that doesn't not exist, but also can't be labelled as existent? I called this one a \nDeletions\n agent. \nN/A\n, actually. Personnel file says their name is \nN/A\n. Pretty unique, don't you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not every day you get to meet an agent that doesn't not not exist. It's a little known fact that the only thing separating Nonexistence from Existence is a healthy dose of realistic logical realism. Surrealistics lack that sort of compass entirely. We're not exactly known to work with other departments, and \ncertainly\n don't mesh well with departments like \nDeletions\n. We just bump into each other's non-logical/non-non-existent shoulders on occasion, spilling whatever we're handling at the time, all over the good rug. It's always right underneath, that rug. I don't know why, but it is, and it has seen better days, my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it's not every day you get to meet an agent that doesn't not not not exist. If only I could find this agent. Is that too much to ask?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, I did find traces.

The\u2013I swear, speaking to an empty room doesn't get any less bizarre. I'm giving this talk to a bunch of unfilled seats, feels like a waste of time. Er, sorry if that came off as insensitive. However much you \ndon't\n want to be here, even if you are technically not here, or here-but-not-here, I don't want to be here even more so. Just know that none of us here willingly chose our current arrangements, alright?\n\n\n[several second pause]\n\n\nRight. [coughs] Well, the data procured from your department has been invaluable once again. Given you non-interactive folks have the best luck with studying this phenomena when we cannot, your assistance is quite literally putting Fundamental Narrativistics at the forefront of modern Metaphysics, a branch of Natural Sciences that wouldn't exist if it weren't for your help. We've already studied previously unknown quanta derived from your experimental data, we've seen and \"discussed\" interactions between antimemes and memes, antinarremes and narremes, and last week we hammered down the production of \nethos\n. As a quick recap, \nideologemes\n and \nculturemes\n mix with other quanta into complex compounds under the blanket term ethos, which enables any extant character with Belief, its inverse, and the ability to suspend them within these systems.\n\n\nThe one thing we haven't quite figured out yet is the exact nature of antiquanta interactions for most Narrativistic phenomena, and the list of quanta is ever-growing. Today, we'll be expanding on ethos by discussing interactions between seme flavors, base units of semiotic phenomena, and ideologemes, the fundamental component of ideology.\n\n\nAntiquanta interactions of all Narrativistic phenomena are theorized to result in the aberrant effects that account for specific portions of all anomalous hazards, usually by way of seeking equilibrium. Antimemes to memetic hazards, antinarremes to narrativohazards, you get it.\n\n\nThe fact is that we know that portions of ethos are a mix of semes and ideologemes, semes form chains that convert into units of meaning, called glossemes. Resulting decay into antisemes can create semiohazards, or combine with ideologemes to create the ever-popular bureaucratohazard. The latter, as you might be aware, anomalously reinforce legal systems that contradict logic, or overpower cognition, or similar. There is never an absence or inverse of this effect, which is something we've noted but not been able to find relative significance in. Like most things in the anomalous world, we simply accept them as what they are and work backwards to find their cause.\n\n\nThe real mistake we've made here was assuming that there wasn't or \ncouldn't be\n an antithesis for ideology. There are antipairs for many extant quanta, barring certain flavors which typically share antiquanta, yet we didn't see anything for ideologemes. It was impossible; we looked and looked and looked, scoured the data, ran the numbers countless times. It never made a single drop of sense for there to be one, all the math would've added up \nworse\n with it in the fray. Naturally, we bickered a lot over the implications; either we tell the higher-ups that Narrativistics' theory is flawed, which, I don't think it \ncan be\n, but we could, and wait for them, or whoever is in charge of this division, to tell us \nwe\n were wrong. We could tell them our measurements were off, or our methodologies, and that they have been from the very start, which would throw quite the spanner into our credibility. Thirdly, we could assume there really are hidden interactions and something about their nature makes them obtuse or easily discounted.\n\n\nWe chose the first option, then the third, after being told that not only were we wrong about these conclusions entirely, but that the right ones would become clear very soon. That they did. I don't know how, but they did.\n\n\nWe all realized why we had been missing it: our team simply couldn't believe the thing was real. None, and I mean \nnone\n of us could hold the belief in the existence of the iconomere, the fundamental unit of iconoclasty. I still have doubts, but that's kind of the point.\n\n\nWe are not actually aware of the existence of the iconomere, nor any hazards it creates. We're not even sure if our collective realization actually happened anymore. Nothing has given us the suspected effects profile, which, if you flip to page nineteen of the packet in front of you\u2013er\u2013wait, let me do that for you\u2026\"\n\n\n[END TRANSCRIPT]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stayed inside again today.

This is the point where our interactions end, if you can even call them that. I can't tell you what I'd call them; this whole affair has left me quite confused, perhaps due to prolonged exposure to logically nonlogical phenomena. I feel disparity that is both familiar and foreign, I don't know. I might need to get that looked at.\n\n\nEither way, you can leave your recollection as a reply and it will be\u2026scraped? Scratched? It will be scooped up by the automated crawlers and filtered as containing unauthorized spam/vandalism edits. The page will be reverted and our experiences will be saved to our respective bins, somewhere. I assume. I've never actually seen your bin. Or any edits from Deletions personnel at all, now that I think about it. I don't even know if you guys keep records.\n\n\nI'm sure that's fine. It was nice meeting you, regardless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, this is the best possible outcome, considering.\n\n\n\u2026Right, we should complete the report and append it to this document for review. Normally we would hand it off to our Semiotics liaison but\u2026 yeah.\n\n\nWhere does one even begin with this?\n\n\nTypically\u2014ah\u2014Well, here's the thing. The Department of Deletions has dealt with infohazards of all kinds, from what we know. Anything, really; cognitive, linguistic, kinetic, ontokinetic, ectoentropic, conceptual, noospheric, hell, even semiospheric hazards, are not out of our purview. If you need something gone that can kill a dead person, you go a step farther and get the agent that never dies. When that doesn't work, you pick up their surviving pieces and build a soldier from those scattered remains.\n\n\nWe've seen that semiohazards are a pain in the ass to manage, even to us; semantic systems affect the gestalt in unique and terrifying ways every now and again, and it puts you in your place. Brings you down a few notches. A few Omega-Zeds kick the bucket and we laugh to ourselves about how this-or-that anomaly killed the unkillable. But what do you do when it erases the untouchable? Where does that which cannot cease go when erased? None can't say for sure, only that it doesn't end the Assignment, and so, they're still out there, somewhere.\n\n\nNaturally, semiotic hazards of the legalese variety are the easiest for us to deal with, most of the time; we don't really need to abide by rules or laws established by governments or lawyers, for that matter. Still, we don't go out of our way to expose ourselves. If you fuck around, you will eventually find out.\n\n\nWe got stuck with this thing that could only be tamed if no one believed anything about it, we instantly knew it was semiotics. Foolish thing was assuming it was a bureaucratohazard\u2014a failure of communication, most likely; we described it as an \"antisemiomic complex that vectors through contradictory systems of belief.\" Basically, it holds both a birth and death certificate and neither of them are valid until one of them is. When one of them is, both are. Systems break down.\n\n\nOn the surface, it sounds just like another one of those legalese joints. After all, what is law and order but another system of belief?\n\n\nWell, that's the thing about iconohazards\u2014they run on belief and lack thereof. Not hard rules, no notaries required. Faith and trust, the abstract counterpart. If you believe in them or not believe in them, at all, you are cooked. We reckon most don't really have a choice in what they decide. But you're supposed to never decide. 'Cause once you've seen them, or not seen them, or whatever, and have unconsciously made the choice to believe in them or otherwise, they've already done their thing. Foolishly, we believed that not choosing to believe in the anomaly\u2014that one whose existence or nonexistence cannot be determined\u2014was sufficient. It was not. Still, it's a wonder how we even made it out of this mess\u2026.more-or-less intact. Almost said \"alive\", but we all know that's not necessarily true.\n\n\nObviously, this is assuming that, by reading our report and being completely unharmed, you at least see the account as hard to believe, yet detailed enough to not have any reason to doubt it, other than that. We really don't know\u2014By this point you've already made up your mind about them.\n\n\nThey are so effective at what they may-or-may-not do, the Administration has already utilized iconoclastic hazards \nin some retrocausal slots\n, and most of us never even noticed. Doubt you did, either. The mild ones turn you away from classified content out of sheer disbelief, which is usually enough for the average use case. The mind throws away more junk data than you might realize, and you forget about it naturally, no amnestic needed.\n\n\nThe more potent ones you don't walk away from. Suffice it to say most beings that come into contact with SCP-7079\u2014were it to exist, which, who knows, \nChrist\n\u2014leave with even their most fundamental of belief systems shattered; the belief in reality as inherently meaningful phenomena, the belief in sensory data being connected to reality, belief in the self as representative of being, stuff like that. You might wonder why Semiotics didn't send anyone to help and, well, that's why. They're not quite catatonic, but not really conscious, either. It's like they're all going through their own personal ZKs. It doesn't look comfortable.\n\n\nRegardless, we're thinking that most rogue iconohazardous anomalies can \nprobably\n be controlled if you never form any hard opinions on them, or perhaps if you have an equal body of believers and nonbelievers simultaneously\u2014Maybe. Shit, does discussing containment methodologies make them less effective?\n\n\nNone of us know, and couldn't tell you even if we did, which we don't. I think it's best if we just stop here. You get it. Just never decide whether or not to believe in them, because they may or may not exist.
