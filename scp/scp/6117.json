In the event that the item causing SCP-6117 is discovered, it is to be contained for study within Site-106.\n\n\nAdditional medical personnel from various Sites around Florida have been redistributed to Site-106 to treat injuries caused by Site-106. A counter-forensic accountant from Site-309 in Orlando has also been assigned in an attempt to alleviate financial harm done by SCP-6117 to Foundation personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6117 is a series of malignant anomalous phenomena which have been affecting the Department of Procurement and Liquidation since its purchase of the now-defunct Bank of the Sunshine State in September 2008.\n\n\nThe most common manifestation of SCP-6117 is physical or material harm. This has included objects falling onto one's person in a painful manner, computer errors which result in the destruction of hardware, and over a dozen instances of scalding from coffee machines within Site-106. In one instance, the main entrance door to P&L's offices refused to open for over two hours; simultaneously, a volume of natural gas from an unknown source\n1\n filled the offices, resulting in a conflagration when the door was finally opened by a Foundation locksmith despite their use of non-sparking tools. No personnel were harmed, but over $8,000 USD of equipment was damaged.\n\n\nLess commonly, SCP-6117 has resulted in financial damages to P&L personnel. Jean Skeates, the director of Procurement and Liquidation, has reported over $50,000 vanishing from her personal accounts \u2014 apparently having been invested in stocks which almost immediately plummeted in value. Other incidents attributed to SCP-6117 include two robberies, six cases of identity theft, and an incident in which the last will and testament of an agent's recently-deceased relative was destroyed.\n\n\nThe motive behind SCP-6117, if any, is unclear.\n\n\nAddendum: Attempts at Neutralization:\n At present SCP-6117 is believed to stem from an object or property transferred to Foundation control following our purchase of the Bank of the Sunshine State; this hypothetical object is designated SCP-6117-A.\n\n\nWhile a relatively small financial institution, the Bank of the Sunshine State had been involved with several anomalous business in south-eastern Florida, most of which had been investigated and acquired by the Department of Procurement and Liquidation. During the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis, the Bank of the Sunshine State was under an unusual amount of financial duress despite its small size; as such, the Foundation was able to use its financial capital to induce its failure, and subsequently acquired it. It is now believed that some of this financial duress was caused by a prior manifestation of SCP-6117.\n\n\nAs such, P&L forensic accountants and psychometrists began an audit of all Bank of the Sunshine State's assets in order to liquidate anomalous items in its possession and cede them to non-Foundation organizations.\n\n\n\n\nAsset \u2116:\n BOSS-8231\n\n\nDescription of Asset:\n A plot of land in the Everglades, located near the southern tip of the state. Investigation of the land discovered a natural freshwater spring, surrounded by several skeletons in armor dated to the 1500s. Testing of the spring revealed scopolamine from an unknown source, in such a concentration that ingestion of about 12mL of water would be fatal.\n\n\nPsychometric analysis by Agent Digby Du Bois indicated that the spring could be drunk from safely, but had specifically been 'modified' by an unknown party so that individuals of Spanish descent would die upon imbibing the water.\n\n\nActions Taken:\n Rights to the spring were ceded to the Everglades National Park. Signs were placed warning of lead contamination in the water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset \u2116\n BOSS-2079-31\n\n\nDescription of Asset:\n A taxidermied, adult specimen of American Alligator (\nAlligator mississippiensis\n), wearing a pair of sunglasses, a Panama hat, and a Hawaiian shirt modified to fit its body type. Discovered by Agent James Skeates within a storage unit owned by the Bank of the Sunshine State.\n\n\nIndividuals who view the object believe it is capable of movement when not in direct view; motion tracking and photography have confirmed that it remains stationary.\n\n\nActions Taken:\n Sold to a museum of oddities in north-eastern Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset \u2116:\n BOSS-3033\n\n\nDescription of Asset:\n A mansion located in Key West, Florida, built in the mid-1800s. Property has a reputation of being affected by spectral activity, with local legend claiming that half of all individuals who enter do not exit alive. Foundation medium Nena Rhys detected no spectral activity within, but did note an 'odd presence' in the attic. This was originally disregarded, leading to an investigator losing a digit due to an undocumented wormhole manifesting in the attic.\n\n\nActions Taken:\n Wormhole sealed, house forfeited to the City of Key West for condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset \u2116:\n BOSS-772\n\n\nDescription of Asset:\n A manuscript for an unpublished manual from \nERS LLC\n, entitled \"So you want to\u2026 Explore Alien Dimensions.\" Includes instructions for accessing alternate planes of existence using thaumic means, and how to profit from this access.\n\n\nActions Taken:\n Document ceded to Unusual Incidents Unit. Currently in storage in a low-value document vault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset \u2116:\n BOSS-933\n\n\nDescription of Asset:\n Approximately 6mL of human blood, in a biohazard container. Blood emits approximately 20 Akiva, and prolonged exposure can lead to glossolalia in human subjects. Three different Foundation psions have shown symptoms similar to radiation sickness in its proximity, but have made full recoveries.\n\n\nActions Taken:\n Item ceded to the Horizon Initiative.\n\n\n\n\nAfter over twenty such transactions, SCP-6117 had failed to abate in any way. In an effort to aid in the location of SCP-6117-A, agent James Skeates had stopped taking his psionic suppressant medication without authorization. Following this, he vanished for three days. A log of his recovery is below.\n\n\n\n\n[View from a lapel camera shows the outside of a mostly-vacant office building in downtown Miami. Several signs reading 'SPACE FOR LEASE' are in a lawn out front, and the sound of a water feature is audible in the background.]\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n Recording on\u2026 my name is Digby Du Bois, and this is day one of our inspection of the former corporate headquarters of the Bank of\u2014 oh, fuck it, can't I just call it BOSS?\n\n\nAgent Rhys:\n It is a mouthful, but decorum. Agent Nena Rhys, medium, inspecting the same for spectral activity. You want gloves until we go in?\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n Nah. I only took half a suppressant this morning. Dulls me enough that it won't hurt, but I'll still be useful.\n\n\n[Rhys and Du Bois enter the building and approach the elevator bank. They enter an elevator, and Du Bois's finger hovers over the button for the third floor.]\n\n\nRhys:\n What's wrong?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n I'm getting a vibe. Smells like sawdust, and ice. And\u2026 honey?\n\n\nRhys:\n You think we have someone waiting for us up there?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Only one way to find out. \nHe pushes the button, and the elevator begins to ascend.\n\n\n[The corporate headquarters of the Bank of the Sunshine State are in a state of disrepair: the reception desk has been knocked over, with papers scattered on the floor around it; a plastic plant has been tipped over in front of the elevator; several tiles of the modular ceiling are missing.]\n\n\nRhys:\n It\u2026 didn't look like this in the photographs.\n\n\n[Du Bois draws his pistol and enters the office space. He inspects the desk, and notes an impression left on its surface by a circular item.]\n\n\nDu Bois:\n You see a coffee mug anywhere? Paperweight? Anything?\n\n\nRhys:\n Negative.\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Someone might have gotten here before us. Shit!\n\n\n[Du Bois enters the office space proper. Several cubicle walls have been knocked to the floor, and most of the desks have been visibly rifled through.]\n\n\nRhys:\n You think that there were\u2026 that many anomalous items left here?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Maybe. There's\u2026 a stench when you have that much stuff in one place. Smells like\u2026\n\n\nRhys:\n Rotten eggs?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n More like acetone, actually. I\u2014 oh \nfuck\n, I smell it now.\n\n\n[Du Bois gags, supporting himself on a desk.]\n\n\nDu Bois:\n What \nis\n that?!\n\n\nRhys:\n Floor plan said the break room was that way. Maybe there was food left in the fridge?\n\n\n[Du Bois and Rhys proceed to the break room. The refrigerator is open, with three trash cans filled to the brim with decomposing food.]\n\n\nRhys:\n This doesn't make sense. Who would throw out food and not take it to the trash compactor?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Maybe they're trying to deter squatters?\n\n\nRhys:\n No, there's more than that. Ugh\u2026\n\n\n[Rhys inspects the trash cans.]\n\n\nRhys:\n There's food here, but no packaging. No lunch bags, no tupperware, nothing.\n\n\n[A clattering sound is heard from the main office area, accompanied by an expletive. Du Bois and Rhys crouch by the door and proceed towards the CEO's corner office.]\n\n\nRhys:\n Wait \u2014 what's that?\n\n\n[Du Bois's attention is turned to a stack of containers of varying sizes and shapes lined up by a window overlooking downtown. He approaches a plastic food container and opens it, finding a rubber band ball within. He reaches out to touch it; upon contact, he recoils.]\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Shit!\n\n\nRhys:\n What?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n It\u2026 I don't know how, but that rubber band ball wants to \nkill\n someone. It's anomalous.\n\n\n[Rhys reseals the container.]\n\n\nRhys:\n So\u2026 we can assume the rest off the stuff is anomalous?\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Yeah. Someone put this together quick and dirty. But who?\n\n\n[Agent James Skeates appears in frame, exiting the CEO's office.]\n\n\nSkeates:\n Was wondering when someone else would show up.\n\n\nDu Bois:\n \nJesus\n, Jimmy, what the hell?!\n\n\nSkeates:\n I\u2026 I got a pull from here after I got off my meds. Had a massive headache. I just\u2026 put everything that called to me in a box. But\u2026 there's something in here. Follow me.\n\n\n[Du Bois and Rhys follow Skeates into the CEO's office. A portrait of the CEO is propped up against the wall, revealing a safe protected with a digital PIN lock.]\n\n\nSkeates:\n Something in there, something big. I've been trying to figure out the combination for the last few hours.\n\n\nRhys:\n Have you\u2026 been brute forcing it?\n\n\nSkeates:\n \u2026yeah. Kind of had to.\n\n\nRhys:\n Okay, move. I have this.\n\n\nSkeates:\n What, are you going to get possessed so the ghost of Clyde Barrow can crack it for you?\n\n\nRhys:\n I've channeled enough thieves that I know a thing or seven, even with newer stuff like this. Move.\n\n\n[Rhys begins attempting to open the safe.]\n\n\nDu Bois:\n Why leave all this behind, though? We did kind of buy out the bank suddenly, but\u2026 a lot of those could conceivably be personal effects.\n\n\nSkeates:\n I have a feeling whatever's in there is the reason why. They wanted to get out before there was much fallout.\n\n\nRhys:\n Gotcha!\n\n\nSkeates:\n What?\n\n\n[Rhys pulls a multitool from her pocket and unscrews the panel holding the PIN pad.]\n\n\nRhys:\n This brand of safe works by unlocking when a current is delivered to the mechanism. But if you short it the right way\u2026\n\n\n[Rhys cuts some wires and places them together. Sparks emit from the wires, and the safe unlocks. Rhys opens it.]\n\n\nSkeates:\n \u2026honestly, my next idea would have been a sledgehammer.\n\n\nRhys:\n And behind door number one\u2026\n\n\n[The safe is in full view. A single document is within. Rhys takes it out and reads it.]\n\n\nRhys:\n It's\u2026 a contract.\n\n\nDu Bois:\n For what?\n\n\nRhys:\n Hold on. 'By the power invested by those undersigned, the physical bearer of this contract holds sole ownership rights to\u2026 the State of Florida'? What?\n\n\n[Rhys scans the document further.]\n\n\nRhys:\n 'This ownership supersedes all personal property in the state, as well as all claims laid to it by the federal government. The following conditions must be met, on pain of chaos\u2026' Blah blah blah, something about Florida panthers, bit about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers here is crossed out\u2026 'forever uphold the legacy of gator farms'\u2026 Andrew Jackson signed this? What? And\u2026 oh. Oh \nfuck!\n\n\nSkeates:\n What?\n\n\n[Rhys looks at the contract in shock, unable to read. Du Bois looks over her shoulder, his eyes widening.]\n\n\nDu Bois:\n 'The institution which is variably known as\u2026 the F-Foundation, the SCP Foundation, the Jailers, Sk-skippers, the Janitors, etc. is not to know of this document, nor at any time possess it. This contract is null and void if these events come to pass. I-in exchange, the b-bearer of this contract will\u2026 will hold all rights to F-Florida, and experience\u2026 stability.\n\n\n[Thunder rumbles outside.]\n\n\nRhys:\n We have to get this back to the Site.\n\n\n\n\nSince the discovery of this item, now designated SCP-6117-A, the Foundation's financial ventures took a downturn not seen since the 1960s. Stocks held by Foundation employees plummeted, anomalous processes used to produce valuable resources ceased to function, and several trade agreements the Foundation held with various countries abruptly broke down. This was, essentially, the onset of a WS-Class Anomalous Economic Collapse Scenario that would have left the Foundation effectively bankrupt by the end of 2009.\n\n\nAttempts to neutralize SCP-6117-A by methods including burning, shredding, consumption, disintegration, and disposal in a containment vault dumped at sea were ineffective; in each case, SCP-6117-A reappeared in the possession of Director Skeates.\n\n\nRe-Negotiations on SCP-6117-A:\n On April 21st, 2009, Director Jean Skeates and Agent James Skeates were contacted by a civilian law firm in Miami, claiming that a client was interested in renegotiating a contract with Profit and Loss, the Department of Procurement and Liquidation's civilian cover. They were directed to the Law Offices of Crow, Milller and White, where a meeting between the Skeateses and the unknown third party took place.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n This feels like a trap. Are you getting a headache, Jim?\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Nothing yet. It's been an hour. How long until your client gets here?\n\n\nMr. Harlow Miller, Attny. At Law:\n They should be here any time now, I do apologize for the wait.\n\n\n[Agent Skeates begins rubbing his forehead.]\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n I don't like this, mom. Big pressure wave coming in right now. I\u2026 he's almost here.\n\n\n[The door to the room opens; video recording fails. Audio feed remains intact.]\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Camera's just died.\n\n\nUnknown Male Speaker:\n Afraid it's a precaution. This bauble right here makes me unrecordable by video, but you should be able to hear me just fine.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n And you are?\n\n\nUnknown Male Speaker:\n You can call me Walter St. John. I represent a union of concerned institutions who believe we could be of benefit to the Foundation in this trying time.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I\u2026 what?\n\n\nSt. John:\n Ma'am, with all due respect, at least three people on that little club of thirteen leading you are profiting off of the current financial debacle. You're not as secret as you think, and that's especially the case with your most recent acquisition.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n You're referring to the Bank of the Sunshine State.\n\n\nSt. John:\n Yeah, ol' BOSS. See, we were wonderin' why someone went and bought up the BOSS all out of nowhere, before anyone else could get their hands on it. So, we're gonna make you an offer. We'll give you some aid in this tryin' time of yours\u2026 but we want the contract that started all this doohickery.\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Are you fu\u2014\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n James! But I share the sentiment. The Foundation doesn't hand out anomalies to civilians.\n\n\nSt. John:\n Civilians? Ma'am, if anything, you should be \ncontaining us\n. We've survived everything from OPEC to Enron to AIG and every letter of the alphabet besides \u2014 but, again, consider who leads you. So if you could abandon those principles you think you have for a moment, let me speak frankly.\n\n\n[No audio is recorded.]\n\n\nSt. John:\n Director, I don't think you appreciate how much trouble this is causing you \u2014 causing all of us. Now, I've got a new contract right here, one that transfers control of Florida and all of its property and problems to us, and frees you from responsibility. Nobody wants you to fail, you're too big for that.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n And I'm assuming that it's not gonna be all puppies and rainbows after we sign?\n\n\nSt. John:\n We want something in return, some blood on your part \u2014 not literally, Heaven knows that you have gallons of it in storage from buying out ERS back in the 80's. No, we just want your firstborn son.\n\n\n[Director Skeates laughs in disbelief. Agent Skeates is heard making a choking sound.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n You're joking.\n\n\nSt. John:\n I am, actually. We want the building you work in. Site-106, right?\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n So, let me get this straight: a cabal of bloodsucking bankers gets a state full of \neighteen million people\n, and on top of that, you're \nforeclosing on us?!\n What the fuck?!\n\n\nSt. John:\n This is an act of kindness, I assure you. Lord knows that you don't actually need the building.\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Why do \nyou\n need it?\n\n\nSt. John:\n Me to know, you to not find out. Say, you hear that a bunch of guards at that Site in Nevada walked out? Apparently their paychecks kept being late. They managed to talk 'em back, but it would be a pity if one of those Key-ter classes got out.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n You bloated, \ninsipid\u2026\n it's not even my place to speak. I'll need approval from the Overseer Council.\n\n\nSt. John:\n You have a week. If not\u2026 well, you'll continue to default on the contract.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Bastard.\n\n\nSt. John:\n Kindest thing anyone's said to me in a month. Now, I'll be on my way; see you back here in seven days.\n\n\n[Video feed is restored as the door to the room closes. St. John is heard whistling.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I should have spat in his face.\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Why \ndoesn't\n the Foundation contain billionaires? They clearly don't have souls.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I don't know.\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n There has to be a way around it. This contract, there has to be some kind of loophole. We need to take a closer look at it. Maybe find out who wrote it? Who negotiated the original terms?\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n \u2026Negotiations and Legality have been looking over that. They haven't found any odd names out.\n\n\nAgent Skeates:\n Let's have Digby look at it more closely. He was Ruyter's protege, and you said it yourself, man was the best psychometrist you knew.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n \u2026all right. Let's\u2026 let's give it a try.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, Agent Digby Du Bois was assigned to psychometric tracking of SCP-6117-A. The following is video recording of an attempt to divine the author of SCP-6117-A.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n Session twenty-six of analyzing SCP-6117-A. Okay, you bastard\u2026 talk to me.\n\n\n[Agent Du Bois picks up SCP-6117-A.]\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n \u2026it's hard to concentrate. There's\u2026 greed, of course. Lot of that. But there's so much now that it's basically background noise, like the sound of the ocean. And\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\n[Agent Du Bois removes a pen from his pocket.]\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n It's been resistant to marking before now. I'm going to\u2026 attempt to sign my name on the contract. See if that affects the energies at all.\n\n\n[Agent Du Bois signs his name.]\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n I\u2026 no, what\u2026 I\u2026 it\u2026 it was\u2026 I didn't mean any offense. I\u2026 I really didn't\u2026\n\n\n[Agent Du Bois gasps. His eyes roll back in his head, and he enters what appears to be a Class-2 Trance.]\n\n\nAgent Du Bois:\n Her eyes are the setting sun in the Gulf and the rising moon over the Atlantic. Her skin is the color of every grain of sand that's ever been trod on. Her open arms welcome those who seek refuge, and her mouth drinks the blood of slavery and genocide. The Everglades are in her smile, her hands hold the palm trees, and she sings every night at a place in Little Havana, by an ice cream shop\u2026 it\u2026\n\n\n[He shudders, and begins singing \nEverglades\n by the Kingston Trio, before collapsing midway through the second chorus.]\n\n\n[Du Bois later made a full recovery, but has no memory of the incident.]\n\n\n\n\nDirector Skeates dispatched herself to Little Havana, where she located a cafe matching the description provided by Agent DuBois at approximately 3:27 PM. The following is a transcript of the events which occurred there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill from Director Skeates's lapel camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Director Skeates enters the cafe. It is a largely open-air establishment, with a bar towards the center. A band is playing in one corner, and there is minimal activity throughout. A server approaches Director Skeates.]\n\n\nServer:\n Hello! Jean, yes?\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I\u2014\n\n\nServer:\n Florence has been expecting you. Sit right here, please.\n\n\n[Director Skeates is escorted to a table where food is already present: a shredded meat dish, a plate of fried banana chips, a bowl containing what appears to be sliced guava, and a beer.]\n\n\nServer:\n I'll be right back with her.\n\n\n[Director Skeates looks down at her food. The camera is pointed straight ahead at the chair opposite her; between frames, a woman manifests in the chair.]\n\n\n[The woman is approximately forty years old. Her hair is black, with streaks of bluish-grey throughout. She appears to have vitiligo, or a similar condition, as the skin on the outside of her arms is noticeably lighter than that on the rest of her body. Her eyes are greenish-blue, and her teeth appear to be pointed.]\n\n\nUnidentified Woman:\n So\u2014\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I'm not eating any of this. We have protocols.\n\n\n[No dialogue is exchanged.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Sorry, was you teleporting in out of nowhere supposed to get a rise out of me? I take it you're Florence?\n\n\n'Florence':\n I just call myself that. Only the first four letters are correct. And it's safe to eat; I'm not about to poison a member of the Foundation.\n\n\n[Director Skeates picks up some of the pork dish with a fork and eats it.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Not bad.\n\n\n'Florence':\n It's \nRopa Vieja\n. Shredded beef, fried, then baked, then boiled.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Pleasantries aside\u2026 you wrote the contract?\n\n\n'Florence':\n The one you're not supposed to have, yes.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n You must be quite old then.\n\n\n'Florence':\n Old as the state itself. I've made\u2026 amendments to it, over the years. So that it was easier to maintain the State.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n And you let it be kept by\u2026 a bank? A somewhat corrupt one, from what we've seen?\n\n\n'Florence':\n I owned all property within the state, including the Bank itself, and all of its assets. But when you bought it up\u2026\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n So\u2026 you're Florida's original owner?\n\n\n'Florence':\n All people have a right to self-determination, right? It's in the constitution. The contract is me, so who else should own it?\n\n\n[Director Skeates digs into her bowl of guava before replying.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n You keep trying to surprise me, but it isn't working. Let me try: someone else wants to buy out your contract.\n\n\n'Florence':\n And you're not letting them?\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n The man who came to visit us was someone named Walter St. John. He\u2014\n\n\n'Florence':\n Let me stop you right now. I know who he is. He may pronounce it that way, but the 'S-T' in his name doesn't exactly stand for 'Saint'. He wanted to\u2026 buy my contract?\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n He claims to have known you. Says he would have re-negotiated.\n\n\n'Florence':\n He does. Unfortunately. But I never would have\u2026 I never would have re-negotiated. That\u2026 \nthing\n you call Walter is a pig. But\u2026 I'm not sure that him owning the contract would be worse than you.\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n How so?\n\n\n'Florence':\n You'd try to keep me under lock and key. Poke me with tools, try to dissect me, maybe see if the Keys will vanish if you cut off a finger. Maybe you'll try to drown me and see if the coast floods. Cut out my vocal chords so that there's no more music\u2014\n\n\n[Director Skeates laughs, cutting 'Florence' off abruptly.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n It never ceases to amuse me how often I run into an anomaly that thinks we are the worst possible option, especially now, when the alternative is literally a cabal of billionaires.\n\n\n[Director Skeates takes several banana chips and chews on them.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Miss 'Florence', think about it this way. Money is the reason behind every single atrocity this country has committed. Slaves were kept within your borders because the rich didn't want to pay for labor. Natives were brutalized by the ruling class because your land was more profitable. Union leaders were murdered by thugs because, to the 1%, it was more efficient to pay off wrongful death fines than to have fire exits that didn't lock. Even today, people are dying in the streets because their homes were stolen from them by robber-barons who see more value in the blot of toner that makes up the decimal point on their earnings report than a human life.\n\n\nImagine all that, all of those atrocities throughout the history of this country. And imagine the people who committed them being free to do all that on you, for as long as they hold this contract.\n\n\n'Florence':\n McCarthy would have burned you alive, Director. But I do see your point. It's all about prioritizing the evils we get into bed with, right?\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n Better the devil you know than the devil who would use your corpse for kindling, Ms. Florence.\n\n\nFlorence:\n\u2026let me see the contract. It's years out of date, in any case. I had to add the reference to you in the 60's.\n\n\n[Director Skeates withdraws SCP-6117-A from a folder at her side, placing it on the table between them. 'Florence' draws her finger in an 'X' shape over the portion stipulating that the Foundation cannot know of SCP-6117-A's existence.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I don't suppose we can have that back?\n\n\n'Florence':\n You knew the answer to that question when you came in here, Jean.\n\n\n['Florence' rolls SCP-6117-A into a scroll and throws it in the air. It does not fall back into frame.]\n\n\n'Florence':\n I'll tell Walter not to bother calling on you again. Will you be staying for the show? I do sing here.\n\n\n[Director Skeates picks up her beer.]\n\n\nDirector Skeates:\n I'd like to, but I\u2014 \nwhoops.\n\n\n[Beer is spilled on the camera, causing a short and ending the recording. Director Skeates returned to Site-106 three hours later, lightly inebriated.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Addendum: Attempts at Neutralization: At present SCP-6117 is believed to stem from an object or property transferred to Foundation control following our purchase of the Bank of the Sunshine State; this hypothetical object is designated SCP-6117-A.\nWhile a relatively small financial institution, the Bank of the Sunshine State had been involved with several anomalous business in south-eastern Florida, most of which had been investigated and acquired by the Department of Procurement and Liquidation. During the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis, the Bank of the Sunshine State was under an unusual amount of financial duress despite its small size; as such, the Foundation was able to use its financial capital to induce its failure, and subsequently acquired it. It is now believed that some of this financial duress was caused by a prior manifestation of SCP-6117.\nAs such, P&L forensic accountants and psychometrists began an audit of all Bank of the Sunshine State's assets in order to liquidate anomalous items in its possession and cede them to non-Foundation organizations.\nAfter over twenty such transactions, SCP-6117 had failed to abate in any way. In an effort to aid in the location of SCP-6117-A, agent James Skeates had stopped taking his psionic suppressant medication without authorization. Following this, he vanished for three days. A log of his recovery is below.\nSince the discovery of this item, now designated SCP-6117-A, the Foundation's financial ventures took a downturn not seen since the 1960s. Stocks held by Foundation employees plummeted, anomalous processes used to produce valuable resources ceased to function, and several trade agreements the Foundation held with various countries abruptly broke down. This was, essentially, the onset of a WS-Class Anomalous Economic Collapse Scenario that would have left the Foundation effectively bankrupt by the end of 2009.\nAttempts to neutralize SCP-6117-A by methods including burning, shredding, consumption, disintegration, and disposal in a containment vault dumped at sea were ineffective; in each case, SCP-6117-A reappeared in the possession of Director Skeates."
