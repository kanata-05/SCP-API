A transcription and cognitohazard filtration program should be running simultaneously to document live broadcasts while removing hazards. These transcripts are to be reviewed daily by assigned research staff. All requests for direct audio files should be given to Head Researcher Dr. Nick Copper.\n\n\nDuring periods of musical interludes, SCP-5178\u2019s vitals are to be checked and its containment cell cleaned when necessary. Any noticeable change in SCP-5178's vitals or behavior must be reported to assigned research staff or an on-site supervisor.\n\n\nAny staff who have been exposed to POI-7134\u2019s live or recorded audio broadcast between 06/20/2020 (\nIncident-5178-1\n) and 08/07/2020 (\nIncident-5178-2\n) or know of someone who has shown a vested interest in POI-7134's ideology are to refer to Dr. Copper\u2019s email below.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n As of 09/18/2020 (Refer to \nIncident-5178-3\n), SCP-5178's containment class has been updated to Keter with the approval of the Classification Committee. Agents are currently investigating new instances of SCP-5178 for containment and for any information on POI-7134's whereabouts, including information on his recent radio broadcast sponsor. Containment procedures may change pending further updates.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5178 is an elderly, Caucasian male speculated to be in his late sixties. SCP-5178's identity is unknown but has been referred to as \"Broadcast Station WYLI\" by POI-7134. SCP-5178 is in a constant semi-catatonic state, where he is unwilling and/or incapable of speaking and has rarely reacted to stimuli. SCP-5178's body heals from physical damage at an extremely fast rate, regenerating tissue and organs near instantly without scarring. This regeneration is speculated to be the reason why SCP-5178 does not possess the need to eat or sleep. SCP-5178's only behavioral trait is his preference to sit in one location with his abdomen exposed to project radio broadcasts.\n\n\nProtruding from SCP-5178's abdomen is a Philips brand radio with technology constructed around the late 90s. The skin around the radio appears to have been charred and inflamed by the alteration, which is inconsistent with SCP-5178\u2019s regeneration. The radio is fully functional and SCP-5178 shows no signs of discomfort from its presence or usage, but any attempt to interact with it, including turning off the radio, is corrected by SCP-5178.\n\n\nThe only transmission receivable through SCP-5178 is a talk show entitled \"Eat The Sun with Seth Uhar\" regardless of what frequency the radio is set to. Seth Uhar, classified as POI-7134, and his recording studio\u2019s location are untraceable. Whether or not POI-7134 is human is unknown, but he has claimed several times to be from a society \"several steps ahead\" of ours. POI-7134's voice resembles an English-speaking human male in his late 20s and speaks with an American accent.\n\n\nPOI-7134's radio show is hosted live and uninterrupted, consisting of segments where he shares his belief that human society ought to detach itself from all systems and beliefs that glorify the sun as opposed to viewing it as a replaceable resource, frequently suggesting it will cause an apocalyptic event if action is not taken soon. POI-7134 also occasionally refers to an individual named \"Ule\" who is never heard speaking but is believed to be present in all live recordings. \u201cUle's\" main role on the show is unknown but POI-7134's comments suggest it to be essential. No other information is currently known about \"Ule\".\n\n\nIn between live segments are musical breaks consisting of songs relating in either title or lyrics to the sun, which are then played at various playback speeds.\n1\n It has been suggested based on comments from POI-7134 that this is done to stay in sync with our \u201ctemporal continuum.\u201d Typical programming between musical breaks consists of the following:\n2\n\n\n\n\nMonologues where POI-7134 talks to the audience about his \"anti-solarist\" ideology. A majority of the information the Foundation has gained on POI-7134 comes from these segments.\n\n\nSkits entitled \"Sunless Days\" about two humans living in a society without the sun and all the technological feats they are capable of. POI-7134's portrayal of the human characters showcases his loose grasp of human customs and terminology.\n\n\nA segment entitled \"SOL-less Conversations\" involving interviews between POI-7134 and guests of a supposed otherworldly/paranormal nature, consistently discussing the benefits of removing their respective sun. So far, none of the guests has been able to speak any recognizable form of language.\n\n\nRequests for listeners to call in with questions. No phone number is provided, yet POI-7134 advertises this segment frequently. This includes requests for sponsorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery Report\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5178 was discovered on 04/17/2020, in Lake Wylie, SC, living in a homeless camp in an undeveloped, heavily forested area after reports came into the local Police Department regarding a mutilated homeless man with a radio sticking out of his stomach. Foundation agents embedded in the local law enforcement took over the investigation soon after.\n\nAgent Arnold Castor was first on the scene at 05:34 PM, reporting that several of the other homeless locals had gathered around SCP-5178, who was wearing a Burger King paper crown at the time. Another camp resident admitted to placing the crown on SCP-5178 to see how he reacted, and he reportedly did nothing in response. Residents present could not say exactly when SCP-5178 first arrived at the camp but most confirmed the first radio broadcast occurred around 08:30 AM.\n\n\nKeith Sturges, a resident at the camp, stated, \u201cI woke up around 5 and he was already there, sitting on that stump. We didn\u2019t bother him at first; you get a lot of guys in a bad spot showing up and normally we respect them enough to leave them be. A few hours after Wojack, the ass, put that crown on his head\u2026That\u2019s when he opened his shirt and began to play that nutty show. At first, we freaked out. After the shock faded away, we thought it was a prank, but then we\u2026just kind of accepted it the longer he kept going. It was free entertainment, as strange as the subject was, so we didn\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\n\nOnce Agent Castor confirmed the anomalous state of the man's condition and the content of the radio broadcasts, he reported his findings and had SCP-5178 transported to Site-88 for further testing. All individuals present at the homeless camp and all of the police officers involved were given class-C amnestics. All mentions of SCP-5178 were removed from local law enforcement records. Dr. Copper was assigned to SCP-5178 as head researcher, and recordings of POI-7134's radio show began on 04/19/2020 after initial testing showed no harmful effects from the broadcast. While SCP-5178's containment proved simple, due to the possibility that his semi-catatonic state may lessen over time, he was classified as Euclid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Selected\u00a0Transcripts\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Selected\u00a0Transcripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript-#0001\n\n\nTranscript-#0029\n\n\nTranscript-#0234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript-#0001 for 04/19/2020 from 08:01 AM to 08:06 AM\n\n\n\n\n[\"California Sun\" by The Ramones at 0.5x playback speed fades out.

That was\u2026\"California Sun\", by The Ramones.\n\n\nSo, it\u2019s currently a time dictated by an inaccurate ball of dirt orbiting a titan of uncaring flames, and it is currently a temperature that you have no direct control over without breaking your own darn sky.\n\n\nI\u2019m your host, Seth Uhar, as always.\n\n\nI wanted\u2026to take time out to explain, as I regularly must do, the message we here at \"Eat The Sun with Seth Uhar\" hold as gospel.\n\n\n\"Eat The Sun.\"\n\n\nNo, of course, I don\u2019t mean literally. If you could eat the sun, it would have nothing nutritional for you at this stage in your evolution, and I wouldn\u2019t feel the intense need to make this show for you all. I don\u2019t think any mortal, singular life-form can eat the sun, but a society of mortal, singular life-forms could swallow it whole. The sun is very nutritious for a growing, technologically-advanced society. It's filled with elements, minerals, and energy that could fuel your next octillion generations!\n\n\nBut why won\u2019t you?\n\n\nBecause you fell into the trap that so many do. Like star-crossed insects\u2026slamming into light bulbs, you mistake the sun as the logical thing to orientate your society on when it should NOT be like that at all!\n\n\nDo you know what your sun is actually like?! Do you know what your sun has actually done?! Do you know what your sun could actually do to you?! NO!\n\n\nOh, but what about our mythical cultures and gods? Like poor \nHelios\n? What will he and \nSurya\n do? And what would \nRa\n, or \nOsiris\n, or\u2026whatever he is, think?\n\n\n[POI-7134 slams loudly on a desk.]\n\n\nPOI-7134:\n WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR EYES? YOU AREN\u2019T SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE SUN WITH YOUR EYES! COME ON! It\u2019s obvious!\n\n\nBefore your minds could even conceive of stealing the flames from your supposed \nOlympus\n, your eyes were screaming the truth to you all along. That it is a harmful, bright blight, too dangerous to even gaze upon from the safety of your caves and treetops! The sun is a convenience to you right now, a teat that humanity must wrestle its puckered lips from.\n\n\nIf you don't\u2026well, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is it not common among humans to cast derision on those who refuse to drop infantile habits?\n\n\nAm I wrong? I don't think I am.\n\n\n[POI-7134 sighs heavily.]\n\n\nPOI-7134:\n Forget what you think is part of the true natural order and take that first step into a new dimension of thought; sunless, without burning eyes\u2026alongside me.\n\n\nYou are capable of so, so much more, I know it.\n\n\nYou know it.\n\n\nTHE SUN KNOWS IT.\n\n\nIT WILL FEAR THAT TRUTH SHOULD YOU EMBRACE IT!

Ramiz noted the improvement made him uncomfortably enthusiastic to continue listening. Over the following week, an increase to staff accessing SCP-5178's broadcasts spiked. Several members of on-site staff started showing positive feelings towards listening to the broadcast, promoting serious discussions regarding the feasibility of POI-7134's ideology and started engaging in behavior spurred by their desire to support and spread the show's influence. Researchers began testing the radio broadcast with D-Class subjects and discovered a minor compulsory anomalous effect was present within the audio. New containment procedures were then put in place by Dr. Copper to minimize further exposure to the program. Following this, a site-wide email was sent to all staff regarding the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nRe:SUBJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Site-88 Research Staff\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Nick Copper, Level 4 Head Researcher\n\n\nSubject:\n Regarding Staff and SCP-5178\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll,\n\n\nIt has come to my attention that, as of June 6th, SCP-5178\u2019s broadcasts now contains a low-grade cognitohazard embedded in live and recorded audio, causing those under its effects increased enjoyment and a compulsion to continue listening to the program. It has also come to our attention that several members of staff accessed SCP-5178\u2019s audio files without permission during this period and are now under the effects of this cognitohazard.\n\n\nThankfully, the anomaly is not spreadable outside of SCP-5178\u2019s broadcasts and the effects should fade within the month. Containment procedures have been updated to stop any further spread of the anomaly. Staff afflicted by the cognitohazard, including myself, will be given a psychological analysis by an on-site psychologist within the following weeks.\n\n\nHowever, recent decisions made by some of those researchers can not be excused by this anomaly, and what we need from you is to show a little self-control, even if you feel you are under the effects of a cognitohazard.\n\n\nThe following actions are not a symptom of SCP-5178's cognitohazard:\n\n\n\n\nAccessing \nSCP-756\n to destroy their sun in order to \"See what happens.\"\n\n\nWearing sunglasses and sunscreen while inside and during inappropriate situations.\n\n\nClosing all the blinds in the facility.\n\n\nExcessive consumption of sunflower seeds.\n\n\nSunflower seed shells not being properly disposed of.\n\n\nSharing images, videos, and memes relating to SCP-5178 on site-wide work chatrooms.\n\n\nSending distressing messages to \nSCP-179\n or \nSCP-2499\n relating to the sun.\n\n\nAccessing files relating to \nSCP-037\n, \nSCP-4074\n, or \nSCP-2995\n without a work-related reason.\n\n\nAny over usage of the sun with face emoji (\ud83c\udf1e.)\n\n\n\n\nAll individuals responsible for these actions have been appropriately reprimanded and anyone else caught engaging in these or similar behaviors going forward may also be equally punished. Proper discussions of SCP-5178 and POI-7134\u2019s ideology will be put on hold for 3 months until we can confirm the cognitohazard\u2019s effects have faded. Until then, I ask that you be patient and that you show some professionalism in the workplace in spite of any perceived anomalies, not abandon common sense at the first sign of symptoms.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nDr. Nick H.

The sounds were recognized as cognitohazards by the transcription and filtering program before engaging in an emergency shut-down to prevent further damage to the recorded data. This lasted for 10 seconds before the noises ceased. The soundproofing within the containment cell was able to dampen the noise enough to cancel out the broadcast's cognitohazards before they could affect staff. However, Kevin Fowler, a class-E staff member who was emptying trashcans near to SCP-5178's cell during the incident, reported that afterwards his teeth started to hurt when exposed to direct sunlight. Investigations into this side-effect are currently pending until further testing is approved.\n\nSCP-5178 was recovered at 12:37 PM from his cell, unharmed by the event.\n4\n It is unknown what POI-7134 broadcasted immediately after the incident. By the time a response team arrived at the containment cell, POI-7134 was repeating the phrase \"I'm sorry Kevin\" for approximately 5 minutes straight before playing \"Sunshine Of Your Love\" by Cream at 0.5x playback speed and resuming his previous broadcasting schedule. The anomalous compulsive effect was no longer present in further live and recorded audio after this event. Following SCP-5178's containment cell being repaired, containment procedures remained the same until \nIncident-5178-3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcript-#1700\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Transcript-#1700\n\n\n\n\nTranscript-#1700 for 09/17/2020 from 05:15 PM to 05:17 PM\n\n\n\n\n[\"Walkin' On The Sun\" abruptly stops before a triumphant jingle plays.]\n\n\nPOI-7134:\n Helloooooo humanity!\n\n\nI am proud to announce that after our brief hiatus, \"Eat The Sun with Seth Uhar\" now has a sponsor!

Several civilians, park rangers, and agents reported distant sounds confirmed to be Yello's \"Oh Yeah\" playing at high volume from within various forests and undeveloped areas. This occurred immediately after POI-7134 made a sudden announcement (See \nTranscript-#1700\n,) at exactly 05:17 PM GST while SCP-5178 was broadcasting the same song. According to all reports, the sound lasted for approximately 4 minutes before fading out. The source of the music was never located in all instances. POI-7134 has returned to his normally shuffled playlist during musical breaks but has not yet returned to do any hosted segments as of 10/\u2588\u2588/2020.\n\nAround the same time, at approximately 05:20 PM, Kevin Fowler (See \nIncident-5178-2\n) also went missing from Foundation custody, having disappeared after notifying guards that his teeth were, \"changing into something plastic.\" Security staff reported the surveillance footage of Kevin's cell was distorted while the on-duty guard went to radio for assistance. The distortion continued until 05:22 PM, showing that Kevin had vanished from his cell. On-site investigators found no trace of Kevin but did discover traces of soot and sulfur marking the cell walls where he was standing. They also discovered a plastic knob attached to an AM/FM switch, similar in design to the one on SCP-5178's radio, covered in a mix of saliva and blood which was a 98% match to Kevin's DNA. Investigating agents believe this incident is related to SCP-5178 and was carried out by their recent sponsor. Agents are currently following any leads on this unidentified GOI.\n\n\nDr. Copper submitted a request to the Containment Committee for SCP-5178 to be reclassified to Keter status, based on evidence that multiple uncontained instances now exist and have the capability to broadcast cognitohazards to multiple civilians at any time. The request was approved on 09/18/2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The most frequently played songs are \"Soak Up The Sun\" by Sheryl Crow at 1.75x playback speed, \"Sunshine Of Your Love\" by Cream at 0.5x playback speed, and \"Walkin' On The Sun\" by Smash Mouth at various playback speeds.\n\n\n2\n. Programming does not follow a standard 24-hour schedule and so segments have no set time-frame, occurring randomly at an average rate of 16-18 times per day.\n\n\n3\n. From an average of 16-18 segments per day to around 8.\n\n\n4\n.

Speculation on the part of the author is potentially hazardous to spread to multiple people until the threat has been fully identified and will be uncensored when it has been found safe for perceptual recognition.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n As of 12/13/2020, broadcasts have returned to their normal structure with expanded hosted segments, ad spaces for non-existent products and services, and listener requested songs. Only one individual has been heard live on-air making a request and notably had a hoarse and raspy voice resembling [DATA EXPUNGED]. Musical requests do not seem to follow the same sun-based theme as previous chosen songs, but do feature variations on their playback speed. The symbolism and meaning behind these requests is believed to be related to the GOI currently sponsoring POI-7134 and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nFurther updates are pending. As of 2/5/2021 SCP-5178's research team has not been responding to communications and are subsequently under investigation for treasonous acts against the Foundation. SCP-5178 has been placed under temporary management of the Site-Director for Site-88, Dr. Anutan, until Dr. Nick Copper, Dr. Jaquita Carson, Dr. Ramiz Kola, and Agent Arnold Castor can be apprehended.\n\n\nTo prevent unnecessary complications amongst coworkers and associates of the former SCP-5178 team members, the original article authored by Dr. Copper will remain available to lower level staff, but all other staff members should remain aware the previous information on SCP-5178 and POI-7134 stated in the article is to be assumed void of authenticity until further reviews can be done.\n\n\nUpdate:\n As of 12/25/2023, Incident-5178-5 has confirmed Dr. Copper and his team have become active instances of SCP-5178, designated now as SCP-5178-A through D.

    "description": "SCP-5178 is an elderly, Caucasian male speculated to be in his late sixties. SCP-5178's identity is unknown but has been referred to as \"Broadcast Station WYLI\" by POI-7134. SCP-5178 is in a constant semi-catatonic state, where he is unwilling and/or incapable of speaking and has rarely reacted to stimuli. SCP-5178's body heals from physical damage at an extremely fast rate, regenerating tissue and organs near instantly without scarring. This regeneration is speculated to be the reason why SCP-5178 does not possess the need to eat or sleep. SCP-5178's only behavioral trait is his preference to sit in one location with his abdomen exposed to project radio broadcasts.",
