The true size and length of the beach are currently unknown, as well as the nature of its two oceans. It is also currently unknown how one gains access to this anomaly, as the Foundation's only account of an entry into the space was unintentional. Foundation staff tasked with researching the anomaly theorize that there may be several specific steps one must take in order to gain access to the anomaly. However, Foundation agents assigned to SCP-6885 have yet to uncover these theoretical steps.\n\n\nSCP-6885 also houses one additional, sub-anomalous entity. A Limulus Polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab) capable of speech and, according to reports, significantly larger than average members of its species.\n\n\nSCP-6885 was discovered by Researcher August during a short sabbatical in Baymonte View. She was found by civilians wandering the beaches with no memory of the past day or her time spent inside of the anomaly. On her cellphone were several recordings and one picture. The recordings were taken by August and serve to document her time spent in the anomaly. They are transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#1\u00a0-\u00a0Discovery\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the recording starts, the camera is aimed toward the sand. When August speaks, she sounds out of breath. The sound of gentle waves lapping onshore can be heard in the background.\n\n\nAugust:\n -alright. It\u2019s alright. Come on, you know what to do. You know exactly what to do. You\u2019ve been trained for this. Just\u2026 just have to remember. Remember what they told you. It\u2019s going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine. Just follow the steps\u2026 first.\n\n\nThe camera flips. August is dressed in an open, short-sleeve button-up with a white tank top underneath and sunglasses resting atop her head. The strap of a small, leather satchel can be seen running across her torso. Behind her, a beach around 46 meters across stretches off into the distance with no beginning or end in sight. Two bodies of water with the appearance of oceans surround the beach on either side. August takes a deep breath.\n\n\nAugust:\n My name is July August. I\u2019m a researcher at the SCP Foundation and have been for the past year. I\u2019m currently stationed at Site-78 where I study Type Greens, specifically their numerous manipulations and alterations of baseline reality. Yesterday, I left for an annual three-day trip I take to my hometown of Baymonte View- that\u2019s Baymonte View, Virginia, by the way. I travel back here every year\u2026\n\n\nAugust trails off. She takes another deep breath.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026it doesn\u2019t matter. A few hours ago, I was sitting on the beach when I decided that I\u2026 that I wanted to take a short walk. So, I started walking. And I walked, and walked, and walked. For hours, I\u2019m guessing. My head just suddenly snapped up, like I\u2026 like I was coming out of a trance. I looked ahead and didn\u2019t see any people, so I looked behind me and\u2026 there was nothing there.\n\n\nThe camera flips as August turns around.\n\n\nAugust:\n Well, not nothing. Just\u2026 more beach. At first, I thought I\u2019d just walked for \na lot\n longer than I intended to, so I looked to my left for the beachfront houses. Just to see if they could tell me how far I\u2019d walked.\n\n\nAugust turns the camera to the left, showing the second ocean.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026and the houses were gone, too. I\u2019ve just been walking on this beach for a while now, I\u2026 I don\u2019t really know what to do\u2026\n\n\nThe camera flips. August closes her eyes and takes a shuddering breath.\n\n\nAugust:\n If I had to guess, I\u2019ve accidentally entered some kind of\u2026 anomalous space. An endless beach, or\u2026 or a world that\u2019s just sand and water\u2026\n\n\nThe edges of her lips twitch.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026or maybe one of them put me here. Breached containment and I\u2026 I don\u2019t know. My phone battery should last a while longer. I\u2019m going to try and send these videos to my work computer, but\u2026 I doubt it\u2019ll work. And I doubt anyone\u2019s going to check. For now, I\u2019ll just keep walking and try to document this as best I can-\n\n\nAugust stops as the camera suddenly jolts to the right, towards one of the oceans.\n\n\nAugust:\n Did you\u2026\n\n\nA dark shape slowly appears in the water and starts rapidly moving towards the shore. A Limulus Polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab) emerges from the waves, crawling onto the sand and beginning to walk towards August. It appears larger than any other known species of its kind. The front of the entity\u2019s (SCP-6885-1) body lifts.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hello-\n\n\nThe camera turns towards the ground as August begins to run. She runs for approximately 22 minutes before coming to a stop and dropping her phone onto the sand. She puts her hands on her knees, taking in gasping breaths of air. She stands and frantically looks around, paying close attention to the two oceans on either side of her. Immediately, she throws the satchel off her shoulder and drops to her knees, beginning to dig through it. She throws a bottle of sunscreen out and onto the sand. Then a small notebook, a bottle opener, and a pen.\n\n\nFinally, she pulls out a pocket knife. Her breathing quickens as she struggles to open the blade with shaking hands. Suddenly, she drops the knife and cries out. Its blade is coated in blood. August holds her right wrist with her left hand as a gash in her palm drips onto the sand. She begins to hyperventilate. In the ocean closest to her, a dark shape moves towards the shore. August scrambles for the knife, crying out again as she places her injured palm on the sand. She crawls several feet back with the knife in her left hand, pointed towards 6885-1. It emerges from the water.\n\n\nAugust:\n STAY BACK, J-JUST GET THE FUCK BACK! DON\u2019T COME ANY CLOSER!\n\n\n6885-1:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nSlowly, August lowers the knife.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026what did you just say?\n\n\n6885-1 moves forward and August lifts the knife, crawling several more feet back.\n\n\nAugust:\n I-I said get away-\n\n\n6885-1 moves back.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I apologize. I just asked if you were alright.\n\n\nAugust\u2019s breathing begins to slow.\n\n\nAugust:\n If I\u2019m\u2026 alright?\n\n\n6885-1\u2019s body moves back and forth in an almost serpentine manner.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes. I think you cut yourself.\n\n\nSlowly, August lifts her right hand and takes a shuddering breath. She turns to one side and opens her satchel again, looking inside before immediately raising her left hand and pointing the knife at 6885-1.\n\n\nAugust:\n Don\u2019t fucking move.\n\n\n6885-1 does not move. August digs through her satchel and around a minute later, curses and closes it, lifting her head towards 6885-1. Without taking her eyes off it, she places the knife between her teeth and rips a piece of cloth from her tank top. She places the knife on the ground next to her and blows as much sand off the wound as possible before wrapping it in the cloth and tying it in a knot. She picks up the knife and stands.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026is that better?\n\n\nAugust points the knife at 6885-1.\n\n\nAugust:\n What are you?\n\n\n6885-1 sighs. It\u2019s similar to the chittering sound made by some mammals.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Is that always the first question you ask when you meet someone?\n\n\nAugust:\n Answer. The. Question.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2026 apologize for being brash. You just scared me a bit.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n \nI\n scared \nyou\n?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes. You \nare\n the one currently threatening me with a knife, after all. But, it\u2019s clear I also frightened you quite a bit. So\u2026 I apologize for that as well. And to answer your question, in all honesty, I\u2026 don\u2019t really know what I am.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026you\u2019re a horseshoe crab.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters again. It sounds lighter than before.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, I\u2019ve been called that many times before. But it\u2019s like trying to tell the sky it\u2019s called the sky, or the beach it\u2019s called the beach. When there\u2019s only one of something, a name begins to lose its meaning.\n\n\nAugust:\n There are literally\u2026 \nthousands\n of beaches.\n\n\n6885-1:\n For you, maybe.\n\n\nAugust takes a moment to look around at the beach and two oceans.\n\n\nAugust:\n Speaking of beaches\u2026\n\n\nAugust suddenly straightens her arm again, pointing the knife at 6885-1. It moves back slightly.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Again with the knife-\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026where the hell are we?\n\n\n6885-1 begins to answer before August takes a step forward and interrupts.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026did you bring me here? Did you fucking bring me here?!\n\n\n6885-1:\n No, I don\u2019t have that kind of power. I don\u2019t control this place, nor do I control who walks its sand.\n\n\nAugust:\n And this place is\u2026\n\n\nAugust trails off.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Home.\n\n\nAugust keeps the knife pointed towards 6885-1 as she looks towards the ocean behind it.\n\n\nAugust:\n So\u2026 are there more like you in this place? A\u2026 family or something?\n\n\n6885-1:\n No, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just me. And the occasional visitor, of course.\n\n\nAugust begins to lower the knife.\n\n\nAugust:\n And what are you called?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m called whatever the people who visit me here decide to call me. It\u2019s like I said, when there\u2019s only one of something, names begin to lose their meaning.\n\n\nAugust:\n So I\u2026 I could give you a name?\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n If you\u2019d like to.\n\n\nAugust thinks for a moment before responding.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026alright then. I\u2019ll call you Dash One.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Dash One?\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah. Where I\u2019m from, we\u2026 designate things by number and order. And since you appear to be the only creature here\u2026\n\n\nAugust tightly grips the knife.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026if you\u2019re not lying to me, that is\u2026 then that would make you Dash One.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hm\u2026 it\u2019s an interesting name, but I have a feeling it will grow on me.\n\n\nAugust reaches down and picks up her satchel, putting it over her shoulder.\n\n\nAugust:\n Alright then. If you don\u2019t mind, I have some more questions for you, Dash One-\n\n\n6885-1:\n What\u2019s your name?\n\n\nAugust clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026my name?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes! Unless you don\u2019t have one, like me. In that case, I could give you a name if you\u2019d-\n\n\nAugust:\n No no, I have one. I have one, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s Dr. August.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Dr. August\u2026 okay. It\u2019s nice to meet you!\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026right. Back to my questions-\n\n\n6885-1:\n Sure.\n\n\nAugust pauses.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026actually-\n\n\nAugust reaches down and picks her phone up off the sand. The camera flips.\n\n\nAugust:\n -I\u2019m going to start a new recording for our interview. So I\u2019ll be back in-\n\n\nThe recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 1 (Missing Persons):\n In this first recording, SCP-6885-1 claims that people besides August have gained entry into SCP-6885. This account does corroborate a missing person report filed in Baymonte View several years ago, in which the young man reported missing was found after two days and diagnosed with transient global amnesia by local specialists. However, this is the \nonly\n account of another situation like August\u2019s occurring in Baymonte View, though SCP-6885-1\u2019s claims have led Foundation staff to believe that this has indeed occurred more than twice. If there are other entry points into SCP-6885, their locations are currently unknown. Requires further investigation.\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#2\u00a0-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6885-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher July August\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nThe recording returns. August places the camera down on the sand, leaning it up against her satchel. She sits down a small distance away so both her and 6885-1 are in frame. The knife rests in her lap.\n\n\nAugust:\n Alright. Here\u2019s what we know so far: I\u2019m-\n\n\n6885-1:\n I apologize for interrupting so early on, but\u2026 could you please put the knife away? It\u2019s making me a bit\u2026 uncomfortable.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2026 hm.\n\n\nAugust very slowly closes the knife and places the folded blade into a pocket on the left breast of her short-sleeve button-up.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the best I can do. Having it out may make you uncomfortable, but being defenseless in this new place also\u2026 makes me a bit jumpy. I figured this is a good compromise.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I completely understand. Thank you.\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Okay then. So, here\u2019s what we know: I\u2019m in an extra-dimensional, anomalous space in the form of an endless strip of sand between two oceans. The space appears to be home to one other sub-anomalous entity, a horseshoe crab capable of speech.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026am I supposed to say something?\n\n\nAugust continues.\n\n\nAugust:\n It claims it cannot control the anomalous space, that it\u2019s just a denizen of it. I may be somewhat new to the Foundation, but I\u2019ve experienced altered reality enough times in my life to know what it feels like to be in an area where reality had been manipulated. This place\u2026 feels different than all the rest. Which makes me inclined to believe Dash One.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Thank you-\n\n\nAugust clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n BUT\u2026 I can\u2019t be entirely sure just yet. So, let\u2019s get on with the interview. That is if you\u2019re willing to comply.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m ready and willing, Dr. August.\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Perfect. We\u2019ll start with some history. How long have you been here, Dash One?\n\n\n6885-1 thinks for a moment before responding.\n\n\n6885-1:\n It\u2019s\u2026 difficult to say. I rise when it\u2019s light and rest when it\u2019s dark. But as you can see, with the beach\u2019s distinct lack of landmarks, it becomes quite the task to keep up with the flow of time.\n\n\nAugust:\n Have you ever tried?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I did, after first gaining consciousness. But it\u2019s been so long, I\u2026 forgot when I stopped.\n\n\nAugust hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n So\u2026 it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019ve been here for quite some time. Years, maybe? Decades?\n\n\n6885-1:\n If I had to guess, you could count my life in single years.\n\n\nAugust:\n Great. So, you just mentioned something about \u201crising when it\u2019s light, and resting when it\u2019s dark?\u201d It is light out right now, but I\u2026 can\u2019t see the sun anywhere in the sky. Could you explain?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I really think that\u2019s just a strange quirk of the beach with no real explanation. No explanation I could ever provide, that is. It\u2019s been like this for as long as I can remember.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026which leads us right into our next question: what is your earliest memory? Despite how long you\u2019ve been here, you should at least have \nsome\n memories from earlier in your life.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I do. My earliest memory is\u2026 of me, gliding along the ocean floor toward shore.\n\n\nAugust waits for a moment.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026that\u2019s it?\n\n\n6885-1:\n That\u2019s it. I was the same back then as I am now.\n\n\nAugust:\n So, your earliest memory is of you fully formed. You haven\u2019t grown at all since then?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I don\u2019t think so\u2026 but, then again, I have nothing really to measure my growth with.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026what about the others who have ended up here? Earlier, you said you were the only one here.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Right.\n\n\nAugust:\n But you also mentioned \u201cthe occasional visitor.\u201d Could you explain that a bit more?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Of course. Every once in a while, someone will find themselves on my beach. I usually watch them from a distance for a while before I approach\u2026 most of them just run, not unlike yourself. But\u2026 you stayed to talk, which I appreciate. Thank you.\n\n\nAugust:\n And do you know how those people ended up on the beach?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t. I always just find them after they\u2019ve already gotten here.\n\n\nAugust hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n I know I asked you this before, but\u2026 where is \nhere\n?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2026 really don\u2019t know. When you\u2019ve lived in one place your whole life, you never really learn where it stands in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\nAugust:\n Haven\u2019t you ever tried just swimming out from shore in a straight line until you find something?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I have, it\u2019s just\u2026\n\n\nAugust waits for a moment.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026what is it?\n\n\n6885-1 chitters. It sounds low and dull.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I really do think I\u2019m the only thing here. And the thought of missing someone walking the beach always managed to bring me back before I went too far\u2026 even if they all just run from me.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026sounds lonely.\n\n\n6885-1:\n It\u2019s alright. I manage.\n\n\nAugust:\n So\u2026 if you\u2019re the only thing here, how do you survive?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know that, either. I guess I\u2019ve just never really had to worry about dying before.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Must be nice\u2026 alright, I\u2019ve got one more question for you.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Ask away.\n\n\nAugust takes a deep breath.\n\n\nAugust:\n If you really aren\u2019t controlling this place\u2026 do you know how I can leave it?\n\n\n6885-1 moves slowly back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t-\n\n\nAugust groans and puts her head down onto her lap, grabbing at her hair with both hands.\n\n\n6885-1:\n -but, I know people who \nhave\n left the beach before.\n\n\nAugust\u2019s head snaps up.\n\n\nAugust:\n Really? How?\n\n\n6885-1:\n That\u2019s the part I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve watched it happen from the water. They\u2019ll be walking along and suddenly they just\u2026 fade away. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s back to where they came from, but\u2026 I guess there\u2019s no real way of knowing.\n\n\nAugust sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n And you know what they say about assuming\u2026\n\n\n6885-1 waits for a moment.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what they say about assuming.\n\n\nAugust hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n So\u2026 they just suddenly begin to fade away? Like, vanish?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes.\n\n\nAugust:\n In that case\u2026 I guess I really don\u2019t have much of a choice. I can\u2019t just sit here forever.\n\n\nAugust stands, picks up her phone, and slings the satchel over her shoulder.\n\n\nAugust:\n Alright then, Dash One. I\u2019m just\u2026 going to keep walking and see what happens.\n\n\nAugust begins to walk down the strip of sand. 6885-1 follows shortly behind her.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Would you\u2026 mind if I walked with you, Dr. August?\n\n\nAugust stops and 6885-1 stops behind her. She thinks for a moment\u2026 before sighing, nodding, and continuing down the beach.\n\n\nAugust:\n Sure.\n\n\n6885-1 follows close behind. The recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#3\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the recording returns, August and 6885-1 are walking on the beach. It is unclear how much time has passed.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026Dr. August, would you mind if I asked \nyou\n a question? I\u2019ve just\u2026 been wondering about this since our interview.\n\n\nAugust thinks for a moment before shrugging.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2026 I guess not.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Thank you. I\u2019ve just noticed that you\u2019re dressed similar to the other people I\u2019ve seen on the beach and yet\u2026 you seem more organized than them. More focused. Why is that?\n\n\nAugust sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n That\u2019s probably because my life for the past year has been nothing \nbut\n organization and focus.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hm. I\u2019m guessing it has something to do with your job? With the people you performed our interview for?\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026yeah. You could say that. How could you tell?\n\n\n6885-1:\n When you gave me my name earlier, you said that \u201c\nwe\n designate things by number and order.\u201d I just felt that there was something\u2026 a bit larger than life behind that.\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Well, you\u2019d be right in feeling that way. I\u2019d\u2026 rather not get into it all now, but I work for a Foundation that studies things that are out of the ordinary. Things that don\u2019t follow the known laws of our universe. Like you and your home, for example.\n\n\n6885-1:\n How do my home and I not follow your universe\u2019s laws?\n\n\nAugust:\n Well\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this all before, but where I\u2019m from, beaches aren\u2019t this long and horseshoe crabs can\u2019t speak\u2026 and they\u2019re a bit smaller, I think. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen one.\n\n\n6885-1:\n How fascinating\u2026 and you said you were a doctor at this \u201cFoundation\u201d earlier, right?\n\n\nAugust slowly nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026right.\n\n\n6885-1:\n What kind of medicine would a standard doctor of your profession practice?\n\n\nAugust:\n Well, these kinds of doctors don\u2019t typically study medicine. Some do, but only when a certain medicine or disease falls into that category of being considered out of the ordinary. Most of us study different aspects of the anomalous. For example, I study any and all manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n\n6885-1 stops.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026wha-\n\n\nAugust:\n I study places that are out of the ordinary and people or objects with the power to \nmake\n things out of the ordinary.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I see. So you thought \nI\n was one of those people or objects and that \nI\n created the beach.\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Exactly.\n\n\n6885-1:\n And how does one even begin to study a field like that?\n\n\nAugust:\n Typically, you\u2019d start by studying how our world functions the way it\u2019s supposed to. If you truly know what laws govern our natural world, you begin to understand how those laws can be bent to their breaking point.\n\n\n6885-1:\n That sounds incredibly difficult! \u2026and I can assure you that I am not one of those creatures who hold this power. If I was, I would never be the only one here.\n\n\nAugust hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n I think I believe you\u2026\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026or maybe I\u2019ve just finally lost it.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy for trusting me.\n\n\nAugust:\n In my line of work, that thought could get you killed.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters. It\u2019s low and drawn out.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026sounds lonely.\n\n\nAugust:\n I manage.\n\n\nThe recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#4\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording returns. August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes. It is unclear how much time has passed.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026Dr. August?\n\n\nAugust takes a moment to respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n Hm?\n\n\n6885-1:\n If your job is to study places like this and creatures like me\u2026 then why were you so surprised when you arrived? I would\u2019ve thought that in your field, this is a somewhat common occurrence.\n\n\nAugust:\n Well\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t \nnecessarily\n be wrong. Of course, anyone who works for the Foundation is always at risk of the anomalous. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m relatively new to all of this, only a year in.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Ah. I see.\n\n\nAugust:\n And I didn\u2019t come here on purpose. I wasn\u2019t even working when it happened, it was just\u2026 an accident. I didn\u2019t \nwant\n to end up here. I didn\u2019t \nwant\n this.\n\n\n6885-1 doesn\u2019t respond. August sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Shit. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026 you\u2019ve been very helpful so far, it\u2019s just\u2026 this was supposed to be a special time for me.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026special how?\n\n\nAugust:\n When you work for the Foundation, especially when you\u2019re as new as I am, you don\u2019t get a ton of time off. Only three vacation days a year. I always use those days to travel back to Baymonte View whenever life gets particularly\u2026 stressful. And when I got here yesterday, it was because life had gotten \nparticularly\n stressful. I come because this place is familiar. Relaxing. For me, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s home.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh.\n\n\nAugust:\n So to end up in a place like this when the one thing I needed more than anything was familiarity\u2026\n\n\nAugust trails off. 6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I understand now. I apologize for bringing it up.\n\n\nAugust sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n No, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m\u2026 sorry I said that.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n It\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to apologize. We\u2019re all just trying to make the best of a strange situation.\n\n\nAugust laughs, softly.\n\n\nAugust:\n Ain\u2019t that the truth\u2026\n\n\nAugust and 6885-1 walk in silence for several more minutes.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026you know, I actually grew up in Baymonte View.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Really?\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah! My parents raised me just a few blocks away from the beach\u2026 \nour\n beach, I should say. There was only one ocean.\n\n\n6885-1 looks to its left and right at the two oceans. It chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Weird.\n\n\nAugust:\n We would go to the beach practically every weekend\u2026 some days we would swim. Others, we would just sit and read. Enjoy the sun.\n\n\n6885-1:\n So that\u2019s why you come back. To visit your family.\n\n\nAugust sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026no, actually. They don\u2019t live in Baymonte View anymore.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hm. Where are they now? \u2026if you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s fine. They\u2019re\u2026 somewhere in South Dakota.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026you don\u2019t know where?\n\n\nAugust clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n We\u2026 don\u2019t really keep in touch anymore.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh. I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026yeah.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Did\u2026 something happen?\n\n\nAugust:\n I just\u2026 I got the job with the Foundation and, as I said, that keeps me busy pretty much all year round. I can only manage to sneak away for those three days and it\u2019s always to come back here. And the work I do with the Foundation\u2026 they \ncan\u2019t\n know about it. Nobody can, only people the Foundation trusts to welcome into its ranks. If the things we study ever got out into the public, it\u2026 it would not be good. Mass hysteria and panic would be the least of our problems. Piles of bodies taller than skyscrapers would probably be closer to the top of the list.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n That sounds like a difficult situation.\n\n\nAugust sighs and rubs both of her eyes.\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah. It is.\n\n\n6885-1:\n And these things you study, the\u2026 reality mix-\n\n\nAugust:\n Any and all manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Right. They\u2019re\u2026 really that dangerous?\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n No, they\u2019re \nworse\n than dangerous. Trust me, you do not want to know.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I do. But your parents, what do they think you do every day?\n\n\nAugust:\n They think I have some government desk job. And it needs to stay that way. It\u2019s better for them. Safer.\n\n\n6885-1:\n But you\u2019re their daughter! Do you really think they care about what\u2019s better or safer for \nthem\n?\n\n\nAugust doesn\u2019t respond. 6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I apologize. It appears I\u2019ve overstepped-\n\n\nAugust:\n What were you going to say?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hm? What-\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019m pretty sure you were just about to ask a question. I interrupted.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh! Right. I was just going to ask you how somebody gets involved with your particular field. It just seems awfully specific.\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s\u2026 kind of a funny story. Like I was saying before, I study people with the ability to create things out of the ordinary or \nmake\n ordinary things out of the ordinary. We call them \u201creality benders.\u201d\n\n\n6885-1:\n Reality benders\u2026\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah. And I became interested in studying them because\u2026 well, I met one when I was a child. Right here, in Baymonte View.\n\n\n6885-1:\n That must be an amazing story.\n\n\nAugust:\n It is\u2026 it\u2019s amazing to me.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Would you\u2026 care to share it?\n\n\nAugust thinks for several moments before responding. She sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n So, I grew up in Baymonte View with my parents. And growing up in a town right on the beach\u2026 you\u2019d think it would be great! \u2026at first. But besides going to the beach, it becomes a bit of a struggle to find things to do. So when looking for more ways to get out of the house and explore a bit, my parents found a small hiking trail through some woods about a 12-minute walk from our house. It seemed perfect\u2026 we must\u2019ve walked that trail at least a dozen times. I knew it like I knew the back of my hand, I\u2026\n\n\nAugust trails off.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026are you alright?\n\n\nAugust clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n Fine. It\u2019s just\u2026\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Looking back on it, I\u2026 never mind. One day, and I was nine years old when this happened, my parents were\u2026 working around the house? Doing something, I just remember that they were busy. And I\u2026 was bored. I figured since we\u2019d walked the trail so many times before, I could easily do it on my own. It\u2019s funny\u2026 when you\u2019re a kid, you aspire to have more responsibility than any one person should. And when you\u2019re all grown up, you wish you had none\u2026 like when you were a kid\u2026 while my parents were distracted, I put my shoes on and walked out the door. And don\u2019t get me wrong, Baymonte View was a pretty safe town back then, all things considered. But still\u2026 a nine-year-old walking down the street alone? I\u2019m almost more surprised that I wasn\u2019t kidnapped.\n\n\n6885-1:\n But you weren\u2019t, right? You made it to the trail?\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n I did. And everything was going to be fine\u2026 I can\u2019t really remember when it all went wrong. I must\u2019ve taken a wrong turn or missed one of those red markings on the trees that signaled what path the trail followed. The only thing I remember was that all at once, I was struck with a terrifying realization. All the times I had walked this trail, and yet\u2026 I\u2019d never \nreally\n walked its terrain. I\u2019d always just followed my parents as \nthey\n walked it. A half-hour and several more wrong turns later and the tears began to flow. I had no idea where I was.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026that must\u2019ve been really scary.\n\n\nAugust:\n It was! It was \nterrifying\n.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I remember thinking that if I didn\u2019t make it back before sunset, a monster was going to chase me down and eat me or something\u2026\n\n\nAugust\u2019s laughter slowly fades.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026you know, I used to think that thought was ridiculous. Just the fears of a child\u2026\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026we can stop if you\u2019d like.\n\n\nAugust takes a deep breath.\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s alright. Thank you, though.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Of course.\n\n\nAugust:\n Where was I\u2026\n\n\n6885-1:\n Lost in the woods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Right! I had no idea where I was or where to go and\u2026 I started crying. I cried and wandered in that forest for what felt like days. In reality, I\u2019m sure it was only around an hour. But as a kid, time always seemed to move slower. Or maybe it could just never keep up with \nus\n\u2026 it was after that first hour that I heard him. It started as just rustling leaves behind me and snapping twigs on either side of me, all of which I ran from. In my mind, a snapped twig was a pack of angry wolves on the hunt for its next meal. But eventually\u2026 my legs gave out and I was forced to stop. I stopped in a small clearing with a little pond and massive tree that blanketed everything around it in a cool shade. I heard the rustling again, so I hid behind the trunk of the tree, only peeking out every few seconds to see if I could catch a glimpse of whatever this thing in the woods was\u2026 and eventually, I did. It was a man. Just\u2026 a man.\n\n\n6885-1:\n There must\u2019ve been \nsomething\n strange about this man, something that tipped you off that he wasn\u2019t normal?\n\n\nAugust:\n Yes\u2026 what first struck me as odd was the way he walked. He didn\u2019t move between the trees like I did, no. The trees seemed almost to move \naround\n him. Like we weren\u2019t walking through a forest, but the forest just so happened to occupy \nhis\n space. But\u2026 aside from that, he looked entirely ordinary. Dirty blonde hair, if I\u2019m remembering correctly. Normal height and weight, wearing a green jacket, brown pants, and black boots. Like\u2026 like someone you\u2019d pass on the street and not even blink at.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n What he did next, though\u2026 I think that will stick with me forever. I remember\u2026 he walked around the clearing for around five minutes, scanning the ground as if looking for something he\u2019d dropped. Finally, he reached down and picked up a small stone, around palm-sized and covered with spots of moss. He carried the stone to the pond and kneeled down at the edge of the water, holding the stone towards the ground. I blinked and\u2026 and the stone was gone. In its place was a small, young turtle, around the same size as the stone with a shell covered in spots of moss! The turtle slowly climbed out of the man\u2019s hand and swam into the pond where it vanished under the water\u2019s surface. I let out a small gasp, and\u2026 he whipped around and caught me peeking out from behind the tree.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Was he angry that you were watching him?\n\n\nAugust shakes her head, adopting a small smile.\n\n\nAugust:\n No\u2026 the opposite, actually. He smiled and gently beckoned me forward, out of my hiding spot. I walked out from behind the tree in a strange mix of fear, and embarrassment that I had been caught. He hummed to himself, again turning his focus towards the ground beneath him while I just stood there, unable to move. After a few seconds, he picked up a handful of dead leaves from the dirt and cupped them between his hands. He closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them\u2026 I could hear a soft whistle coming from where the leaves were. He opened his hands and\u2026 a small bird flew out! Its feathers were a mix of reds, yellows, oranges, and dark greens. The bird flew from the man's hands and landed on my shoulder. It poked its beak through my hair and nuzzled against my cheek. I laughed and the man laughed with me. The bird chirped and whispered into my ear with the most melodious voice I\u2019ve ever heard\u2026 \u201cAre you lost?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d\n\n\nAugust falls silent. A few moments later, she continues.\n\n\nAugust:\n After around a minute, the bird flew from my shoulder and landed back in one of the man\u2019s palms. He cupped his other hand over the small creature and when he reopened them, a small pile of dead leaves fell to the ground. I laughed and clapped, and the man smiled again and gave me a wink. He pointed towards one side of the clearing, and\u2026 there was a path there, leading through the trees. A path that I could\u2019ve \nsworn\n hadn\u2019t been there just moments before. The man turned to me and nodded, and I understood with no words spoken that that was the path he wanted me to walk. I nodded back and thanked the man, too young and naive to fully comprehend the gravity of what I\u2019d just seen. The man placed his hands in his pockets and said this: \u201cIf you follow the right path\u2026 you\u2019ll never be lost again.\u201d\n\n\n6885-1:\n And did you? Follow his path, that is?\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n I did. I had walked for around 20 minutes when suddenly, almost as quickly as I had gotten lost\u2026 I was out of the forest. Another 12 minutes and I was back at my house. When I walked inside, my mother was sitting at our kitchen table balling her eyes out while my father was on the phone with the police. Apparently, I\u2019d been gone for five hours. I\u2026 wasn\u2019t allowed out much for the next few months, and never alone. Especially after telling my parents about the \u201cstrange man\u201d I\u2019d met in the woods.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I was too young to understand how that was the \nlast thing\n a parent wants to hear after their child goes missing\u2026\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, I can see how that could\u2019ve been\u2026 distressing.\n\n\nAugust:\n Totally. So\u2026 yeah. That\u2019s how I became interested in the many manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Really? Just like that?\n\n\nAugust:\n Well\u2026 no, I guess not. From that moment on, I\u2026 became kind of obsessed. At first, I just wanted to find the man again so I could thank him for his help. Ask him if he could do all of those amazing things for me again\u2026 but as I grew older, my obsession slowly spiraled more into \nhow\n what he did was even possible. I spent practically every waking moment reading everything I could get my hands on, even if I was reading someone\u2019s crackpot internet theories. I put all my energy into academia and eventually\u2026 it just paid off. I was approached by the Foundation and offered a job. And\u2026 I accepted. With the increased pay, I helped my parents with the move. House became too big for the two of them, I guess. And that\u2026 that was the last time we spoke.\n\n\n6885-1:\n So, all of your hard work paid off.\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah, it\u2026 it did. And after joining the Foundation, the first thing I did was check to see if they had the man I\u2019d met in the forest in containment. They-\n\n\n6885-1 chitters, interrupting August.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Containment?\n\n\nAugust:\n Oh, right! Yes, that\u2019s what our Foundation does. We locate places, people, or objects that fall outside of normalcy, contain those things to the best of our ability, and study them so we can better understand how they work. It keeps them safe, as well as the rest of humanity. We die in the dark, so they can live in the light.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Hm. Are you\u2026 going to contain me?\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Maybe, if I knew how I even got here in the first place. But if everything you\u2019ve told me so far is true, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. You\u2019d most likely be a Safe class anomaly or minor Euclid. Once we discover how people end up here, I have to imagine it would be pretty simple to stop. The most you\u2019d have to put up with is an occasional interview from another Foundation researcher\u2026 or a doctor, like myself.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Interesting\u2026\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah! And who knows, maybe I\u2019ll even be assigned to watch over you.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I would enjoy that very much. But first, I must apologize. I believe I interrupted you.\n\n\nAugust:\n Wha-\n\n\n6885-1:\n Something about trying to locate the man you\u2019d met in the forest?\n\n\nAugust thinks for a moment before responding.\n\n\nAugust:\n Ah, right. The Foundation, they\u2026 they didn\u2019t have him. I uhhh\u2026 never saw him again, after the forest. Instead, I was assigned to\u2026 something else\u2026\n\n\nAugust trails off.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026are you alright-\n\n\nAugust:\n Fine. Just\u2026 could we not talk about work stuff?\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Of course.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026thank you.\n\n\nAugust and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes. August laughs, softly.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026you know, they send me cards on every holiday. Valentine\u2019s Day, Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, my birthday. Even Easter, and I don\u2019t remember them taking me to church \nonce\n.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026and what do the cards say?\n\n\nAugust sighs and crosses her arms over her chest.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026that they\u2019re sorry for whatever they did wrong. Whatever they did to push me away. That they completely understand how important my new job is, and how busy I probably am\u2026 that they wish I would talk to them about it so we could figure everything out together.\n\n\n6885-1 doesn\u2019t respond. August continues.\n\n\nAugust:\n But they don\u2019t understand. \nI\n barely understand. I just know that the closer they are to me, the more danger they\u2019re in. And I\u2026 I\u2019ve caused them more than enough trouble already.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026it\u2019s like I said. You\u2019re their daughter, Dr. August. They don\u2019t care about any danger to them. If they believe \nyou\n to be in danger, however\u2026 I have to imagine they would swim through the deepest, darkest oceans for only the slightest chance to help. It\u2019s what parents do. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any position to stop them.\n\n\nAugust doesn\u2019t respond. Minutes later, she holds her left hand above her eyes.\n\n\nAugust:\n It looks like the sun is beginning to set\u2026 or whatever controls the light here.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes\u2026 it looks like it. How is your hand feeling?\n\n\nAugust:\n What?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Your hand, the one you cut earlier. Does it feel any better?\n\n\nAugust:\n Huh\u2026\n\n\nAugust lifts her right hand.\n\n\nAugust:\n You know, I\u2026 I kind of forgot about it. I guess that means it has to be feeling better, right?\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, I believe so. I\u2019m glad.\n\n\nSlowly, August turns her phone towards the ocean. The water is bathed in a soft, orange glow.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026it\u2019s very beautiful here.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes\u2026 I think so, too.\n\n\nThe recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#5\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording returns. August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes before she clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026hey, Dash One? Can I tell you something?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Of course, Dr. August.\n\n\nAugust cringes slightly and sighs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2026 haven\u2019t been entirely honest with you. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n6885-1 stops for a moment before continuing to move forward.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh. What haven\u2019t you been honest about?\n\n\nAugust:\n The thing is\u2026 I\u2019m not really a doctor at the Foundation. I\u2019m just a researcher.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Is there a big difference between the two positions?\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026honestly, not really. It\u2019s just\u2026 becoming a doctor with the Foundation takes much more time and effort. Sure, a promotion could come from an achievement, like creating containment procedures that completely neutralize the risk of a Keter class-\n\n\n6885-1 stops for a moment and looks up August.\n\n\nAugust:\n -don\u2019t worry about it. But most times, it really is just how long you\u2019ve worked with them. How well you know their operations. Becoming a doctor \ndoes\n have its perks, though. Access to restricted files, field agents\u2026 stuff like that. But\u2026 I\u2019m not a doctor. I haven\u2019t earned it, so I should stop pretending to be one.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Why did you lie in the first place?\n\n\nAugust shrugs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2026 really couldn\u2019t tell you. I think it just\u2026 made me feel safer? If that makes any sense. I was trapped in this new and strange place, so maybe if I acted like I had the experience and wisdom they do, the \npower\n they do\u2026 I would know what to do and how to react.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Well, if it makes \nyou\n feel better and doesn\u2019t really hurt anyone\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad of a lie.\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah, maybe not. But now I just feel\u2026 kind of icky.\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Okay, Researcher August.\n\n\nAugust:\n Ehhh\u2026 too wordy. You can just call me July.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n July August?\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Hey, you can take it up with Mr. and Mrs. August.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, that is quite an\u2026 unusual name.\n\n\nAugust:\n Says the crab with no name at all.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026fair enough. Though, I have been \ngiven\n names before.\n\n\nAugust:\n Oh yeah? Then I can\u2019t be the only one with a weird name. You must\u2019ve picked up some strange ones, right?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes\u2026\n\n\n6885-1 stops for a moment.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026somebody called me a god, once. I\u2026 didn\u2019t really like that one.\n\n\nAugust hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n Yes\u2026 I can see how that would be uncomfortable.\n\n\n6885-1 continues to walk.\n\n\n6885-1:\n But July August is more unusual than most, is it not?\n\n\nAugust:\n I guess so. My dad and my friends growing up always used to just call me Jules, though. Well\u2026 most of my friends. This one girl I met in college just \ninsisted\n on calling me Auggie, no matter how many times I told her not to!\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s kind of a funny story. We met at this super shitty dorm party sophomore year. It wasn\u2019t really my scene, and it was clear she\u2019d had a bit too much to drink, so I offered to walk her back to her room. From there, it\u2019s like\u2026 I just started seeing her everywhere. Or maybe I just began to notice\u2026 anyway, once I properly introduced myself, it was Auggie from that point on. A few months before graduation, I asked her why she called me that. She told me that when we\u2019d met, she had been taking a Latin class. She said it was because the meaning of the name Auggie was \u201cgreat, or magnificent\u2026\u201d\n\n\n6885-1 waits for a moment before responding.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026she sounds like a great friend.\n\n\nAugust clears her throat.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026y-yeah. Yeah, she was. Morgan was\u2026 a great friend.\n\n\n6885-1 stops and looks up at August.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026don\u2019t give me that look, Dash One.\n\n\n6885-1:\n What look?\n\n\nAugust:\n You know exactly the look I\u2019m talking-\n\n\nThe recording cuts. When it returns, August and 6885-1 are walking on the beach in silence. The sky has gotten darker.\n\n\n6885-1:\n So, how is Morgan doing with all of this?\n\n\nAugust:\n W-what?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Morgan, your\u2026 friend. How does she handle working for your Foundation?\n\n\nAugust:\n Oh no, she\u2026 she doesn\u2019t work for the Foundation.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Ah. I apologize. From the way you spoke of her, I figured-\n\n\nAugust quickly interrupts.\n\n\nAugust:\n You figured wrong. I\u2026 haven\u2019t talked with her in a while. We got into a pretty big argument a few months ago\u2026\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh. I\u2019m so sorry. We don\u2019t have to talk about it if it\u2019s too much-\n\n\nAugust:\n Well, it was mostly the same fight I had with my parents. Morgan can\u2019t know what I do with the Foundation, so\u2026 she\u2019s safer this way. Without me. And that\u2019s the end of it.\n\n\n6885-1 hums.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m still a bit confused about those rules, if you wouldn\u2019t mind clarifying them for me?\n\n\nAugust:\n What rules?\n\n\n6885-1:\n The rule your Foundation enforces where you\u2019re not allowed to see your family, friends, or loved ones. It just seems like a steep price to pay for the knowledge you seek.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026there\u2019s no rule about not seeing them. They just can\u2019t know what work we do for the Foundation.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026oh. So, what were you two fighting about?\n\n\nAugust:\n I had decided to move closer to the Foundation Site I work at, and\u2026 Morgan wanted to come with me.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \nThat\u2019s\n why you argued?\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Of course it is! I had to shoot the idea down before it had the chance to become anything more than that.\n\n\n6885-1:\n But\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t you want her to go with you?\n\n\nAugust:\n Didn\u2019t you listen when I told you about my parents? The work I do is dangerous! The more she followed me down that road, the more danger I was putting her in.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Danger of what? Her finding out what you do?\n\n\nAugust:\n Her finding out was the least of my worries.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Then you still could\u2019ve been with her-\n\n\nAugust:\n You don\u2019t understand. The danger doesn\u2019t come from her \nfinding out\n what we do\u2026 it just comes from what we do.\n\n\n6885-1:\n How is what you do dangerous? Isn\u2019t your Foundation supposed to \ncontain\n these things that-\n\n\nAugust:\n Stop talking about things you don\u2019t understand. Our Foundation is the last line of defense against an unending wave of an apocalyptic magnitude. And when that wave manages to bleed through our defenses, \nwe\u2019re\n going to be the first things standing in their way. My parents\u2026 Morgan. I don\u2019t want them anywhere near that! They can\u2019t be.\n\n\n6885-1:\n That\u2026 that sounds awful. Why would you ever choose to do something like that?\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019d dedicated my \nentire\n life to this research. I wasn\u2019t going to trip at the finish line. I was an idiot, though\u2026 I thought\u2026 I just thought they would all be like him.\n\n\n6885-1 doesn\u2019t respond. August continues.\n\n\nAugust:\n People with extraordinary gifts\u2026 who turned stones into turtles, or leaves into songbirds. Who helped lost children find their way out of the forest. But that\u2026 that is not what greeted me at the Foundation\u2019s doors.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Then why didn\u2019t you leave?\n\n\nAugust:\n Because nobody ever leaves. Once we learned of our mission, learned just how\u2026 \nimportant\n the work we were going to do was\u2026 nobody left.\n\n\n6885-1:\n But is this work worth everything? Your family? Your-\n\n\nAugust:\n You act like I \nwant\n to do this! Like I \nwant\n to spend day, after day, after day studying these creatures that wear human skin and can erase people from existence with the blink of an eye! I do it because I \nhave\n to! Because we of the Foundation have a duty and obligation to shield the rest of humanity from those unnatural who seek to do us harm.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026that\u2019s an awfully heavy burden to-\n\n\nAugust:\n Of course it\u2019s a heavy burden to shoulder! But it\u2019s one that we have to\u2026 alone.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Your logic is flawed. Your task of safeguarding humanity is doomed to fail if your Foundation continues to cut itself off from what makes its people human in the first place.\n\n\nAugust:\n I think about them. EVERY. DAY. I\u2019m doing this. FOR. THEM. Every night, my dreams are plagued with thoughts of what would happen to Morgan if one of these merciless, satanic, death-worshipping creatures escaped containment. To my parents. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to them.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026to them? It\u2019s not fair to y-\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s not fair to anybody! You say someone called you a god once? You\u2019re fucking insane. \nWe\n contain actual gods, real gods. BARELY.\n\n\n6885-1:\n So cutting them off completely is your solution? If you truly care about them, you\u2019ll come to realize that it\u2019s not your choice to make. If they want to be there, they\u2019ll find a way-\n\n\nAugust:\n Yeah? And what the \nfuck\n do you know? You\u2019re just another one of them. So don\u2019t lecture me about my life and my relationships when the longest conversation you\u2019ve ever had is the one you\u2019re having right now. Like it even matters. Once we figure out how to shove you and this entire place into a box, you\u2019ll just be another number. Just a drop in the bucket of things that shouldn\u2019t exist. If I were you, I\u2019d savor this. It\u2019s going to be a very long time before you speak to anyone else, \nDash One\n.\n\n\n6885-1 stops and looks up at August. Her breathing is erratic and shallow. 6885-1 turns forward and continues walking down the beach. The recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#6\u00a0-\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording returns. August and 6885-1 walk in silence for around ten minutes. The sky is dark and the water is bathed is a soft, white light.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026there\u2019s an old legend passed around between Foundation employees, especially those who choose to study reality benders. In today\u2019s climate, the story is considered at most taboo and at least in very poor taste.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n But\u2026 every once in a while over some drinks, or on a particularly late night, you might catch whispers of it. Of a man named \nResearcher Talloran\n.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n Story goes, Talloran attracted the attention of an entity with nigh inconceivable reality-warping properties. Nobody knows why, and nobody knows how.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n The entity breached containment, was killed somehow, and Talloran\u2019s body was found at the bottom of its cell. On his cellphone was a document that told the story of hundreds of millions of years of torture the entity forced him to perceive and endure. The unspeakable anguish that was done onto him by this entity for seemingly no reason other than it was a monster.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond. August laughs. It sounds weak.\n\n\nAugust:\n Most just think it\u2019s a story. A tale created by the higher-ups meant to teach us the importance of proper containment procedures, or something like that. Some of us, though\u2026\n\n\nAugust\u2019s laughter fades.\n\n\nAugust:\n Some of us\u2026\n\n\nAugust stops.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026could we stop for a moment? My\u2026 legs are a bit tired.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond. It stops walking and turns towards the ocean, digging itself slightly into the sand. August sits next to it. August and 6885-1 sit in silence for around five minutes. August hums.\n\n\nAugust:\n I guess there must be a sun and moon here, even if we can\u2019t see them\u2026 when the sky began to darken, the water shined with a sort of orange glow, like during sunset. And now that the sky is completely dark, it shines white, like it\u2019s reflecting the moon.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond. August laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n You know, I think one of my colleagues would \nreally\n enjoy this place. He studies anomalies that can affect or change the weather on earth or the astronomy beyond the earth, so a place like this would probably fascinate him.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026is the weather here always like this? So perfect?\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026has it ever rained?\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026I\u2019ve always liked the rain.\n\n\nSlowly, August draws her knees towards her chest and wraps her arms around her legs. When she speaks, her voice is barely above a whisper.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026I\u2019m sorry. About what I said before. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n6885-1 does not respond.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m \nterrified\n, okay? You really do have \nno\n idea about the things we contain. The things we only \njust\n manage to contain\u2026\n\n\nTears begin to drip from August\u2019s eyes.\n\n\nAugust:\n I thought it would be easy, I thought\u2026 I thought they would all be like him. Do you know what I\u2019ve heard them describe most of these reality benders as? \u201cChild-Gods.\u201d I\u2019ve seen what they can do to people, what they \nhave\n done to people, even outside of the stories. I can\u2019t-\n\n\nAugust chokes out a sob.\n\n\nAugust:\n I can\u2019t let that happen to her. To them. I can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t survive it. At least this way\u2026 I know they\u2019re safe.\n\n\nAugust places her head onto her lap as sobs silently rack her body.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026do you know what I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand?\n\n\nAugust\u2019s head snaps up. She stares at 6885-1 for several moments before responding.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026what?\n\n\n6885-1:\n The people who you choose and don\u2019t choose to put your trust into. When you first arrived on the beach and thought \nI\n was the one who controlled it, thought \nI\n was the one keeping you here\u2026 I can understand that mistrust. But the lack of faith you have in the people you love most\u2026 I don\u2019t think that will ever make sense to me.\n\n\nAugust wipes at her eyes with the back of her hand.\n\n\nAugust:\n I-it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them\u2026 I don\u2019t trust myself! I don\u2019t trust myself not to let them get too close\u2026 to put them in harm\u2019s way.\n\n\n6885-1:\n And what about your Foundation? Isn\u2019t it their sole purpose to protect humanity from these things? Don\u2019t you even trust your own people?\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026the fact that I\u2019m here right now is proof enough that I can\u2019t trust them as much as I thought I could. I know this is the right thing to do, the right path to walk-\n\n\n6885-1:\n But that\u2019s not your choice to make! You can\u2019t force the people who truly love you to stay away, not for long at least.\n\n\nAugust falls silent. 6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026if I had a family like that and a person like Morgan in my life\u2026 I would never let them go. NEVER.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026even if you holding on killed them?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Then you quit. Get rid of the danger altogether.\n\n\nAugust:\n I can\u2019t quit! Even if I wanted to leave, I\u2019ve seen what happens to the people who do. They take their memories from them. I can\u2019t lose everything I\u2019ve learned\u2026 it\u2019s all I am.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026but look at yourself. You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders and refuse to share that weight with the people in your life who want nothing more than to help you.\n\n\nAugust slowly tucks her head between her legs and grabs two fistfuls of her hair with her hands. Her voice shakes when she speaks.\n\n\nAugust:\n No\u2026 no, this has to be right, it has to be! I\u2019m on the right path, I\u2019m \nstaying\n on the right path. I know I am. Because if I follow the right path\u2026 I\u2019ll never be lost again.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters and moves closer to August.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Oh, July\u2026\n\n\nAugust slowly looks up towards 6885-1.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Just because you\u2019re walking the right path, doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it alone.\n\n\nTears begin to drip again.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026but I am alone.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026no, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve been here the whole time, haven\u2019t I? Right under your nose.\n\n\nAugust slowly nods.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026and they\u2019re here for you, too. It doesn\u2019t have to start big. Just\u2026 a message. Something that says you\u2019ve been thinking about them, and you miss them. Something that says\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\n\n\nAugust\u2019s breathing relaxes but tears continue to drip down her cheeks.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026can we stay here for a little while longer? This place really is wonderful.\n\n\n6885-1 chitters.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Of course.\n\n\nThe recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording\u00a0#7\u00a0-\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording returns. The sky is bright. August stands and stretches.\n\n\nAugust:\n What\u2019d you say we keep walking, Dash One?\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m ready when you are, July.\n\n\nAugust nods and the pair begins to walk. They walk in silence for around a half-hour. August whistles.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019ll tell you what\u2026 when we get back, I\u2019m going to sleep like a newborn.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Me as well. I am tired both physically\u2026 \nand\n mentally.\n\n\nAugust:\n You said it.\n\n\n6885-1 stops. Moments later, August stops as well, turning around to face it.\n\n\nAugust:\n What? What is it?\n\n\n6885-1:\n You may get your wish sooner rather than later. Look\u2026\n\n\nAugust turns and looks down the beach ahead. Around a hundred meters in front of them, the sand on the beach begins to make a sharp turn left, creating another beach and cutting off one of the oceans. Another hundred meters after the new beach, the geography begins to resemble that of baseline reality.\n\n\nAugust:\n Oh\u2026 I guess that means we\u2019re coming to the end?\n\n\n6885-1:\n Yes, it does. Please, don\u2019t sound \ntoo\n thrilled about it.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n Sorry, sorry\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 I thought it would be a bit longer.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Selfishly, I had secretly \nhoped\n it would be a bit longer. I apologize.\n\n\nAugust shakes her head.\n\n\nAugust:\n No need. I think\u2026 I think I hoped for that too. If only just a bit.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026thank you. From this point on, I believe I know what happens. If you continue to walk farther down the beach, at some point\u2026 you will begin to fade.\n\n\nAugust nods.\n\n\nAugust:\n Alright then. Until that time\u2026 let\u2019s keep walking.\n\n\nAugust and 6885-1 continue to walk in silence. Around eight minutes later, August staggers back and grabs her head.\n\n\nAugust:\n Ahhh\u2026\n\n\n6885-1:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nAugust:\n Fine, fine\u2026 it\u2019s just my head\u2026 just a wave of a migraine, it should pass in a moment\u2026\n\n\n6885-1 avoids looking towards August.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026Dash One? Are \nyou\n alright?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I\u2019m\u2026 okay.\n\n\nAugust:\n Are you sure? I\u2019ve never seen you act like this before. Almost\u2026 bashful.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026I\u2019m sure.\n\n\nAugust crouches down and leans in towards 6885-1. It shies away.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026what aren\u2019t you telling me-\n\n\nSuddenly, August falls to her hands and knees, closes her eyes, and grits her teeth as another wave passes over her. Slowly, her eyes open halfway as she looks out into the distance, across the ocean. After several moments of silence, she slowly turns back towards 6885-1, her eyes melancholic.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026when I go back, I\u2019m not going to remember any of this. Am I?\n\n\n6885-1 slowly moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n No, I\u2026 I don\u2019t believe you will.\n\n\nAugust sighs and presses both of her palms onto her eyes.\n\n\nAugust:\n Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I-I must\u2019ve gotten lost in our conversation a-and it slipped my mind\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nAugust removes her hands and smiles. Her eyes look red.\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s okay. I just wish I\u2019d known earlier.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n I would\u2019ve paid more attention to what we talked about\u2026\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026while yes, you will forget the specifics of our conversation, I do believe you\u2019ll retain\u2026 the feeling of it. If that makes any sense.\n\n\nAugust:\n I guess I\u2019ll find out, huh?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I guess you will.\n\n\nStill crouched next to 6885-1, August raises her phone, turns the camera towards them, and takes a picture.\n\n\n6885-1:\n What was that?\n\n\nAugust:\n It\u2019s called a selfie. Now, even if I don\u2019t remember exactly what we talked about\u2026\n\n\nAugust shows 6885-1 the picture.\n\n\nAugust:\n I\u2019ll still have something to remember \nyou\n by.\n\n\n6885-1:\n \u2026thank you, July.\n\n\nAugust smiles.\n\n\nAugust:\n And thank you, Dash One\u2026 or, whatever you decide to be called next.\n\n\n6885-1:\n I think\u2026 I think I\u2019m going to stay as Dash One. At least for a little while longer.\n\n\nAugust laughs.\n\n\nAugust:\n You know what was just a designation, right?\n\n\n6885-1 moves back and forth.\n\n\n6885-1:\n Maybe to you. But to me\u2026 it was a wonderful gift from a friend.\n\n\nSlowly, August lowers her hand towards 6885-1, stopping just short of its shell.\n\n\nAugust:\n \u2026would it be alright if I-\n\n\n6885-1 chitters and nuzzles into August\u2019s palm. They remain there for several minutes. Slowly, August stands and wipes her eyes.\n\n\nAugust:\n Could you\u2026 keep walking with me? Until it happens?\n\n\n6885-1:\n I would love to.\n\n\nAugust and 6885-1 continue to walk down the beach in silence. After around three minutes, the recording cuts to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 2 (After Action Report):\n As stated above, Researcher August was found wandering the beaches one day after she was supposed to have returned to Site-78. She had no memory of her time spent in SCP-6885 or her conversation with SCP-6885-1. When asked how she received the cut on her right palm, she claimed that she hadn\u2019t noticed it until it was pointed out to her.

        "Addendum - 1 (Missing Persons): In this first recording, SCP-6885-1 claims that people besides August have gained entry into SCP-6885. This account does corroborate a missing person report filed in Baymonte View several years ago, in which the young man reported missing was found after two days and diagnosed with transient global amnesia by local specialists. However, this is the only account of another situation like August\u2019s occurring in Baymonte View, though SCP-6885-1\u2019s claims have led Foundation staff to believe that this has indeed occurred more than twice. If there are other entry points into SCP-6885, their locations are currently unknown. Requires further investigation.",
        "Addendum - 2 (After Action Report): As stated above, Researcher August was found wandering the beaches one day after she was supposed to have returned to Site-78. She had no memory of her time spent in SCP-6885 or her conversation with SCP-6885-1. When asked how she received the cut on her right palm, she claimed that she hadn\u2019t noticed it until it was pointed out to her. She was not given access to the recordings but did show signs of intense confusion when first viewing the photo. All lie detector tests performed on August came back negative.\nSeveral days after August was recovered, she failed to appear at Site-78 and was reported out of state for two days. A tracker placed on her person after recovery showed that she stopped once in South Dakota and once in Wisconsin before returning. Upon her return, she was severely reprimanded by her Site Director and placed under careful observation.

    "description": "SCP-6885 is an extra-dimensional space consisting of a narrow and seemingly endless beach, surrounded on either side by two oceans. The true size and length of the beach are currently unknown, as well as the nature of its two oceans. It is also currently unknown how one gains access to this anomaly, as the Foundation's only account of an entry into the space was unintentional. Foundation staff tasked with researching the anomaly theorize that there may be several specific steps one must take in order to gain access to the anomaly. However, Foundation agents assigned to SCP-6885 have yet to uncover these theoretical steps.",
