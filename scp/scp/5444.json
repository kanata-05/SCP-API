Furthermore, all information relating to SCP-5444-4 is to be backed-up through at least two network-inaccessible mediums.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-5444-1 are to be stored, unpowered, in an electromagnetically-shielded storage locker. Experimentation, when applicable, is to be conducted under similar conditions, and instances may not be connected to the Site-56 intranet without approval and supervision from the IT Department.\n\n\nSeveral instances of SCP-5444-2 are uncontained; Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") has been tasked with locating and disabling rogue instances of SCP-5444-2.\n\n\nSCP-5444-3 is to be kept disassembled and stored in the High Value Containment Wing of Site-56.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5444 is a series of malware programmed in the Yashagor\u014d paralanguage. Metadata analysis has returned largely inconclusive results; it is known that SCP-5444 is 1.32\ni\n GB in size at most, although metadata relating to its creation and ownership has been extensively obfuscated. The most recent iteration of SCP-5444 was last modified on January 9th, 2018 at 16:15 EST.\n\n\nThree variations of SCP-5444 are known to exist, each of which is associated with a specific hardware environment.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5444-1 are a series of miniature computers of custom make, upon which SCP-5444 has been installed as firmware. All run a bare-metal hypervisor in order to simulate a variety of operating systems, while allowing SCP-5444 to run several iterations at once. A high-end web camera has been installed into the chassis of a single instance, designated SCP-5444-1-Prime.\n\n\nSCP-5444-2 is a hypervisor-level rootkit, commonly installed across insecure network connections by SCP-5444-1. Instances otherwise function identically to SCP-5444-1.\n\n\nSCP-5444-3 is a humanoid automaton with an artificial intelligence governed by SCP-5444. Unlike -1 and -2, SCP-5444-3 cannot directly interface with a network, and must employ HIDs\n1\n to perform its intended functions. SCP-5444-3 was powered by an esoteric engine drawing from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nWhen connected to either a database or computer network, SCP-5444 functions as an effectively sapient user. SCP-5444's primary activities are initially limited to accessing and analyzing as much data as possible; upon the confirmation of data referenced in SCP-5444-4, SCP-5444 will attempt to remove such data through any means necessary.\n\n\nAll variations of SCP-5444 reference SCP-5444-4 through a series of anomalous pointer variables\n2\n. SCP-5444-4 is a file stored on SCP-5444-1-Prime with a .rysh extension, serving as the primary method of setting SCP-5444's censorship parameters. Modification of SCP-5444-4 first requires the user to undergo a three-factor authentication process to confirm they are PoI-9522-D.\n\n\nPoI-9522-D was \nSara Miriam Yarkoni\n, a 29-year-old Iranian-American freelance programmer with connections to GoI-1285 (\"The King of Hearts Collective\")\n3\n. According to data recovered from SCP-5444-1-Prime, PoI-9522-D was the sole programmer of SCP-5444-1.\n\n\nAt present, SCP-5444-4 directs SCP-5444 to erase all evidence of PoI-9522-D's existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5444's existence was brought to the attention of the Foundation on January 10th, 2018, following a string of attacks targeting several individuals of various backgrounds. Although coordinated in such a manner as to suggest a botnet, several attacks displayed unusual complexity. Attacks included, but were not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nMass DMCA claims against videos featuring PoI-9522-D and her music.\n\n\nExtensive vandalism to several online wikis.\n\n\nSpecific behavior intended to exploit streaming algorithms in order to sabotage PoI-9522-D's music's chances of discovery.\n\n\nBlackmail intended to coerce the recipient into deleting files depicting PoI-9522-D from their devices.\n\n\n\n\nShortly thereafter, Senior Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni received an email, purportedly from his daughter Sara. Attached was a PDF, ostensibly a handwritten letter, infected with an SCP-5444-2 installer.\n4\n\n\nFollowing its installation, SCP-5444-2-1 launched a series of attacks directed at personnel assigned to the GoI-1285 project, as well as Researcher Yarkoni and his wife, \nDr. Rivka Yarkoni\n. Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") was directed to identify, combat, and isolate the threat.\n\n\nSCP-5444-2-1 was subsequently isolated and neutralized by MTF-\u03ba10 after two hours and fourteen minutes. Researcher Yarkoni was reprimanded for his carelessness and reassigned to \nArea-56\n duty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5444-A\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the 1966 SoHo Accord, the Foundation required a warrant to raid the residences of PoI-9522-D, on account of her fiance's registration as a Frequent Resident of BackDoor SoHo. Furthermore, action on part of the Foundation was limited to assisting attendant Unusual Incidents Unit operatives.\n\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\n\nFollowing the acquisition of SCP-5444-3 and all four instances of SCP-5444-1, each of their drives were isolated and imaged, as standard for computer anomalies. According to imaging software, all files pertaining to PoI-9522-D had been deleted at 16:15:54 EST on 10/01/2018, 24 hours after the last modification to SCP-5444-4; as no action had been taken to wipe the associated data, files were successfully restored with minimal effort.\n\n\nOf interest to the Foundation were several video files recorded on SCP-5444-1-Prime, in which PoI-9522-D discusses the function and background of SCP-5444, as well as updates as appropriate. The last of such videos was recorded at 16:17 EST on 09/01/2018, 19 minutes prior to her estimated time of death.\n\n\nExcerpted video logs have been provided below. The original files, as well as full transcripts, may be accessed with permission from RAISA; personnel are to be advised of their sexually explicit nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0bonus.wmv,\u00a0recorded\u00a030/12/2010\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbonus.wmv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 30/12/2010\n\nLength\n 0:28:19\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG 2.1]\n\n\nPoI-9522-D:\n Heya!

Obviously this is gonna be sexier than reading an EULA, but it still concerns a lot of technical and legal bullshit, and I know not all of you are here for my coding stuff. Bear with me, I'm gonna try making this the easiest EULA possible.\n\n\nTurning around, PoI-9522-D makes a show of walking to an office chair in the middle of the room, then settling into it with a relaxed position perpendicular to the backrest.\n\n\nPoI-9522-D:\n So, you're the proud owner of one of my videos, albums, et cetera. That entitles you to several legal rights. First of all, you are entitled to watch it. You are \nmore\n than welcome to watch it.\n\n\nPoI-9522-D chuckles, winks, and begins to slowly unbutton her jacket.\n\n\nPoI-9522-D:\n Secondly, you're entitled to download it to any device you own.

Third, and this is one goes out to \"\npink fly\n\", you cannot show any of this to anyone who doesn't need to know. Again, darling, I'll know.\n\n\nPoI-9522-D:\n So, let me be one hundred percent transparent: those files are a bit of an \nexperiment\n. They're a bit smarter than your typical file, so in addition to carrying the image of me fucking myself raw, they're a bit shy when it comes to distribution.
