A Faraday cage hardwired to the Foundation intranet is to be positioned around the enclosure to restrict public access to SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C. Disinformation campaigns regarding the sites are to be launched to settle any possible sightings of SCP-5090 before Foundation intervention. SCP-5090-1 is to be fed one loggerhead turtle egg daily, and supplied a dish of saltwater, to be exchanged for fresh saltwater every two weeks.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5090 is a Wide Area Network server. No evidence of external hardware which operates SCP-5090 exists; instead, SCP-5090 is entirely operated by SCP-5090-1. It has been concluded that SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C operate based on the daily actions of SCP-5090-1.\n\n\nSCP-5090-1 is a colony of Atlantic ghost crabs (\nOcypodinae quadrata\n) which previously resided on Scotch Beach, Block Island, Rhode Island (see addendum 1). SCP-5090-1 appears to be sapient; it is concluded that SCP-5090-1 collectively has the equivalent intelligence of a seven-year-old human child. SCP-5090's exact method of creation is unknown, although enough evidence has led to the conclusion that SCP-5090-1 created it through telecommunication. SCP-5090-1 will interact with users of SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C, appearing to perceive users as other animals in the area.\n\n\nSCP-5090-A, SCP-5090-B, and SCP-5090-C are websites created by SCP-5090-1. One or more of these websites will appear in a user's browser history and/or bookmarks before the user had accessed these websites in the first place. Visiting SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C will automatically connect the user to SCP-5090.\n\n\nSCP-5090-A is a blog-style website accessible by the domain www.turtleeggtime.crab, mainly consisting of posts about the daily lives of SCP-5090-1.\n\n\nSCP-5090-B is a video sharing website accessible by the domain www.digfromdanger.crab. Despite its intended purpose, SCP-5090-B contains few videos posted by SCP-5090-1. SCP-5090-1 mainly interacts with users through the community tab, and commenting on works uploaded by other users.\n\n\nSCP-5090-C is an educational webpage consisting of interactive media with the purpose of educating school age children that is accessible by the domain www.sand.crab.\n\n\nAddendum 1.1: SCP-5090-1 Interaction Pre Containment\n\n\nOn 07/06/2019 Dr. Marigold and Researcher Crane accessed SCP-5090-A and SCP-5090-B to interact with SCP-5090-1 before containment. Dr. Marigold went under the alias \n\"Crabgirl19\"\n, and Researcher Crane went under the alias \n\"Puzzledhearts\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nghostysandgvhbj\n\n\nturtle egg or bug\n\n\n\n\negg4lyfe\n\n\negg\n\n\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nEggs sound healthy.\n\n\n\n\nburrowsfromdangerssss\n\n\nWhy does a ross goose say egg eating good you a goose\n\n\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nThey're not my eggs.\n\n\n\n\negg4lyfe\n\n\nweird goose\n\n\n\n\nLicorice_0_3_0\n\n\nwhat animal am I\n\n\n\n\ndancecrabsand\n\n\nstupid butterfish dont know what it is\n\nhaha\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\n\nwhere do you guys live\n\n\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nA bit on the nose, crab girl.\n\n\n\n\nghostysandgvhbj\n\n\nhabitat\n\nblock\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\n\nyou didn't block me\n\n\n\n\nghostysandgvhbj\n\n\nblock\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\n\nokay\n\n\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nnosey box crab\n\n\nstand by your crab brethren\n\nno nose\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\n\nwhat the fuck how do you know the word brethren\n\n\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nwhat does that mean\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\n\nI love you all\n\n\n\n\ntheportraitjudges\n\n\nI know they're so cute right\n\n\n\n\nburrowsfromdangerssss\n\n\nI am not cute catbird\n\n\nfierce crab\n\n\n\n\nClosing statement: the animals mentioned in the log by SCP-5090-1 led to the conclusion that it resided in Rhode Island. SCP-5090-1 mentioning \"block\" appears to be a reference to Block Island, Rhode island.\n\n\nAddendum 1.2: SCP-5090-1 Interaction Post Containment\n\n\nThe following is the comment section of a video uploaded to SCP-5090-B titled \"life\". The video depicts two members of SCP-5090-1 sitting in containment for fifteen minutes.\n\n\n\n\nUploaded by ocean-survival on 08/12/2019\n\n\nVideo description:\n\n\ntoday life update\n\n\n\n\nCrabgirl19\n\ncool\n\n\negg4lyfe\n\n\nResponse to Crabgirl19:\n thanks I was in it\n\n\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\nDo you two have any hobbies?\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nResponse to Puzzledhearts:\n yes I like hunting for eggs but I cant do it a lot anymore because I am in cage thing but it is okay I have friends\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nResponse to ocean-survival:\n Cage? what do you mean, lad?\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nResponse to Puzzledhearts:\n I was at the sea with my friends but then I wasnt\n\nI am not sure what happened but now I am not in the sea\n\nI still have my friends though\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nResponse to ocean-survival:\n \nHow are you all adjusting to the change?\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nResponse to Puzzledhearts:\n adjusting?\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nResponse to ocean-survival:\n how are you taking the change, in short.\n\n\nocean-survival\n\n\nResponse to Puzzledhearts:\n nosy ross goose\n\nbut you nice\n\nmost okay with it\n\nMossy is very confused though\n\nshe doesnt like change but we try to tell her it okay cause were all together\n\n\nPuzzledhearts\n\n\nResponse to ocean-survival:\n I see.
