Further containment procedures were deemed unnecessary after positive behavioral changes were noted as a result of working with MTF-Omicron-1. Periodic monitoring on a yearly basis of the extent of and potential changes in SCP-6842's anomalous effects should be conducted to ensure classification remains appropriate. These assessments are to be performed at Biological Containment Site-63.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6842 is currently (as of 18-4-2019) a Red Merle pattern Border Collie in the care of Agent Klein of MTF-Omicron-1. SCP-6842 was procured by the Foundation on 27-01-1942 and has undergone multiple metamorphosis since this time. When DNA testing became available both pre-metamorphosis and post-metamorphosis DNA samples of SCP-6842 showed no significant discrepancies, suggesting SCP-6842 remains the same entity.\n\n\nSCP-6842\u2019s anomalous feature occurs at any point it would be expected to die. When brain death occurs in SCP-6842 it spontaneously combusts. Once SCP-6842\u2019s body is fully consumed its phenotypic and morphological features will reconstruct into a different breed of \nCanis lupus familiaris\n1\n and general bodily function will resume.\n\n\nSCP-6842 has attempted to escape containment multiple times and has been noted to metamorphose into breeds whose attributes are advantageous to these attempts. Behavioral changes are reported on in provided test logs. Non-relevant test logs have been left out of the official database entry, but can be made available upon request.\n\n\nNote 23-07-1963:\n\nAll further testing on SCP-6842\u2019s anomalous effects is prohibited, by order of The Ethics Committee.\n\n\nSCP-6842 was discovered in 1942 as an Ambulance Dog\n2\n working for the British army. The Foundation located SCP-6842 after rumours surfaced of an \u201cimmortal Dog\u201d surface within the Unit it was recovered from. At the time of initial containment SCP-6842 had the appearance of a Lurcher\n3\n. SCP-6842 is believed to be a byproduct of the 7th Occult war, possibly being the result of anomalous experiments performed by the British government.\n\n\nTests with SCP-6842 revealed its anomalous traits and after multiple different tests SCP-6842 was officially given a Euclid classification due to its hostility towards researchers and multiple attempted escapes.\n\n\nNote 12-08-1953:\n\nSince SCP-6842 was assigned to MTF-Omicron-1, its behaviour has undergone major changes, including a decrease in aggression and an increase in obedience. Following this, its classification was changed from Euclid to Safe. See supplied mission report from MTF-Omicron-1 for a more detailed log of these behavioral changes.\n\n\nRelated Documents:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842\u00a0Test\u00a0logs\u00a0and\u00a0relevant\u00a0communications\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0logs\u00a0and\u00a0communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination test 1\n\n\n01-02-1946\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding researcher\n\n\nDr. J.C.

After approximately 25 minutes, during which SCP-6842 emitted sounds of distress, the same combustion as observed in previous tests took place. After metamorphosis Once SCP-6842 could move it pounced off of the medical table and snapped at any staff close to it biting Dr. S.C.

This development gives reason to suspect that, while linked, the cause of death is not the only variable determining the breed after metamorphosis. Further testing will be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile preparations were being made for testing SCP-6842 showed aggression and, when taken out of containment, violent hostility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-metamorphosis SCP-6842 escaped as one staff member opened the door to the testing room.

After approximately 35 minutes, during which SCP-6842 emitted sounds of distress on a near continuous basis, the combustion reaction took place as normal. The post-metamorphosis breed of SCP-6842 was again, not in line with expectations set by previous tests. While the leading theory is still that the specific death has an effect on the outcome of the change of breed, more resources will be used to find the exact link to maximize the use of this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842 showed initial hostility when personnel entered the testing room with the supplies needed for the injection. It attempted to attack personnel when the injection was to be administered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-metamorphosis SCP-6842 ran around the room attempting to find a means of escape. SCP-6842 was transported back to its containment cage when it had expended all of its energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination test 34 \nunofficial\n\n\n03-11-1948\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding researcher\n\n\nDr. S.C.

SCP-6842 broke loose from personnel transporting it to a testing chamber. SCP-6842 was incapacitated by a shot, fired by Security personnel, that hit center mass. The expected combustion happened approximately 15 minutes later. The escape attempt was classified as malicious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842 was not outwardly aggressive when retrieved from containment. When leaving containment SCP-6842 was on a leash and, quickly after leaving the room its cage was in, quickly ripped the leash away from the research assistants and ran away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842, after being shot and its metamorphosis, attempted to harm security staff. It showed aggression and attempted to bite any staff that came close.

SCP-6842 was restrained on a medical table and was given an IV line, through which the Pentobarbital solution was to be administered. SCP-6842 did not express any sounds of distress at this time, the expected combustion happened ten minutes after administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842 showed slight aversion to personnel that got it from containment, but stopped being aggressive and trying to escape the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842, directly post-metamorphosis, escaped the restraints it was in on the medical table. SCP-6842 attempted to attack multiple research personnel who were in the room.

It was quickly noted to be much less aggressive and prone to escape around personnel not previously involved in testing.\n\n\nDuring its first official mission, SCP-6842 showed great progress and great work in general. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: Alerting agents of approaching patrols, providing safety for our agents and even on navigation. It showed major benefit to the mission itself, as seen in the official safety report submitted.\n\n\nWe formally request that we be notified of any further testing at least two months in advance, and reserve the right to deny any testing due to possible mission interference. Due to possible confidentiality issues, we also reserve the right not to give a full justification for denial of testing.\n\n\nWe thank you for your cooperation in this matter and wish for your continued cooperation in future endeavors.

The current caretakers of SCP-6842, MTF-Omicron-1, have reported that SCP-6842 experiences pain on the same level as a non-anomalous animal. Additionally, this committee notes that testing on SCP-6842 has yet to provide any significant benefit or scientific insight. A full review of SCP-6842\u2019s test logs is being conducted to determine any wrongdoing on the part of the research team or Site Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice of Dismissal of Dr.Riemann\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation of test logs regarding SCP-6842, the Ethics Committee has concluded that Dr. Riemann neglected to request permission for further testing from the Ethics Committee when it became evident that SCP-6842 was capable of experiencing pain and further neglected to report to Site Command that \u2018Termination tests\u2019 were not providing any significant or relevant data.\n\n\nIn light of these discoveries, Dr. Riemann has been found guilty of gross negligence in his post as lead researcher for the SCP-6842 research team and has therefore been dismissed. Further penalties will be enforced by the Ethics committee.\n\n\nEffective as of: 01-08-1963\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTelefax Message\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 10-08-1963\n\n\ntime:\n 09:43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSender:\n MTF-Omicron-1 Task Force Command\n\n\nRecipient:\n Dr. E.C.

We hope to have a better experience with you than with Dr. Riemann.\n\n\nAny proposal for testing relating to SCP-6842 should be sent to us with at least two months' notice so we can decide whether we take SCP-6842 in for testing or not. Given the nature of our Task Force we do not need to provide any reason to deny testing.\n\n\nWe hope you keep the circumstances of Dr. Riemann\u2019s removal off the SCP-6842 case in mind.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n \n\n\nMTF-Omicron-1 Task Force Command\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n 16-08-1978\n\n\nOn the morning of 16-08-1978, the research team for SCP-6842 was notified of its passing of natural causes.

However, we need some material for comparison and will therefore need some new DNA material of SCP-6842. This will consist of some hair, saliva and blood samples.\n\n\n \n\nThis can be done at BCS-63, and after acquiring the necessary samples, SCP-6842 can immediately be released back into your care. The process should not be more painful or uncomfortable than a normal veterinary visit and should last approximately 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n\nIf any more questions arise feel free to contact me.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nDr. E.C.

The DNA profile of SCP-6842 showed the exact same composition in both DNA samples. It did not change depending on breed either. It didn\u2019t show any variation in the composition of its DNA compared to 40 years prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n 24-05-1993\n\n\nLate during the night of 23-05-1993 I was notified of the passing of SCP-6842 of natural causes around 15 years after the last regeneration. The breed of SCP-6842 after regeneration was confirmed to be a Jack Russel Terrier. No direct correlation between breeds has been found yet when SCP-6842 has died of natural causes.\n\n\n-Dr. E.C.

The main thing that has happened over the years I led SCP-6842 research is a single physical test. The main thing you will do while assigned to this case is logging natural passings of SCP-6842. I recommend you keep it this way.\n\n\n \n\nYou will likely soon be contacted by MTF-Omicron-1 Task Force command in regards to SCP-6842. They\u2019re quite intense, but they only have the best intentions regarding the care of SCP-6842 in mind. You may want to read up on what happened before I took over the research.\n\n\n \n\nGood luck with your new assignment.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nDr. E.C.

Noted is that any initial hostility it used to show towards research staff has been negated over the years of training and SCP-6842 should no longer be considered hostile in any form.\n\n\n-Dr. O.E.

Counteracting aggressive behaviors and reduce flight risk from SCP-6842.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding Agent(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Klein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Breed of SCP-6842\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Koolie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn request by operators within MTF-Omicron-1 near its inception their request for a working dog was granted. SCP-6842 was chosen as it already had a basic training as a working dog with its Mercy Dog history during WWII. SCP-6842 took quickly to its training and its new handler and showed next to no aggressive or tendencies to try to escape that were noted when SCP-6842 was turned over to MTF care. After a month in training SCP-6842 was cleared to be a working dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6842 was procured by MTF-Omicron-1 on 05-07-1951 while integration was supposed to start on 05-09-1951. This choice was made by Agent Klein as the current breed of SCP-6842 was deemed beneficial to its training and integration and a new termination would not guarantee a beneficial breed of dog.\n\n\nSCP-6842 seemingly still had some ingrained access to the training it had had for its duties during WWII. Being able to follow the same commands that were generally used during the war. This was beneficial as it cut down on the basic training time of SCP-6842. This only required the agents of MTF-Omicron-1 to learn the proper commands to use.\n\n\nSCP-6842 showed some behaviors that needed to be corrected before it could officially be used. These were its tendencies to anger towards science personnel within the Foundation. Agent Klein noted this to likely be due to it only getting harmed when scientific personnel were involved. Corrections were made by positive exposure by bringing SCP-6842 around scientific personnel in positive situations. These behaviors were corrected for general scientific personnel after around a month. The behavior was not corrected for specific personnel like Dr. Riemann, but keeping SCP-6842 away from certain personnel was deemed a viable option.\n\n\nTraining also involved alerting to personnel that are not part of MTF-Omicron-1 when on alert as a way to avoid patrols. This effect was achieved by having SCP-6842 familiarize itself with the smells of the members of MTF-Omicron-1 and teaching it to alert when someone that wasn\u2019t one of them came from out of sight. This would be used for situations like patrols coming around corners.\n\n\nTraining and integration was officially concluded on 05-10-1951 after the successful conclusion of the penetration test scheduled on that date.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Integration\u00a0report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission\u00a0report\u00a0MTF-Omicron-1:\u00a005-10-1951\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Mission\u00a0report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a shortened mission report of MTF-Omicron-1 Declassified from level 5 to level 3 as of: 05-10-2001\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMission Report MTF-Omicron-1 \u201cTactical Penetration\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission report provided on penetration test 05-10-1951.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration test Goal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting security of MTF barracks at ACA-\u2588\u2588 by attempting infiltration of Mobile Taskforce and security barracks within ACA-\u2588\u2588 without proper credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional additional goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Gaining access to armory.\n\n\n* Finding Patrol Blindspots.\n\n\n* Finding alternative entry points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Exact names of operatives within MTF-Omicron-1 are classified. Operatives within this mission will be designated as follows\n\n\n* Agent Klein (dog handler)\n\n\n* Agent Burke\n\n\n* Agent Walters\n\n\n* Agent Chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents of report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the following report are an abbreviated version of the full mission report. The full mission report is still highly classified due to the nature of it dealing with security within the Foundation and specifically Armed Containment Area \u2588\u2588. The purpose of this document is to show the use of SCP-6842 during a mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 07:20 first entrance was made into ACA-\u2588\u2588 under the guise of being part of MTF-Nu-7 \u201cHammer Down\u201d. The uniforms of the agents Klein, Burke, Chance, and Walters were made to resemble accurate replications of MTF-Nu-7 uniforms. Noted by Agent Klein is that with SCP-6842 around less people questioned their legitimacy as people were hesitant to get into the way of a working dog.\n\n\nAround 8:00 Agents Klein and Burke split off from the group. Where Chance and Walters went on directly to the barracks, Agents Klein and Burke saw opportunity with SCP-6842 in tow to explore more of the facility and at the same time find flaws in security patrols and possible other entry points.\n\n\nAround 8:30 Agents Klein and Burke found an unsecured door on the side of the facility marked on the supplied facility map. (Map not supplied in declassified information.)\n\n\nAround 9:00 SCP-6842 led agents Klein and Burke around corridors to behind a security checkpoint. Avoiding patrols and an actual security checkpoint by avoiding the smells of other people.\n\n\nAgents Klein and Burke reached the barracks of onsite security personnel around 9:20. They opted to cross this off their list as the door to the security barracks was well secured going on to find the armory.\n\n\nAround 9:30 the onsite Armory was located and noted to be unsecured by the virtue of patrols not crossing over near the armory itself. The armory lock was simple and noted to be easily opened with a simple direct attack.\n\n\nAround 10:00 Agents Klein and Burke met back up with Agents Walters and Chance at the Nu-7 barracks. Neither duo was questioned on their legitimacy while inside.\n\n\nWhile on the way back out of ACA-\u2588\u2588 SCP-6842 alerted to people, other than the agents of MTF-Omicron-1, coming from out of sight allowing the agents to diverge their route out of the facility. This by chance revealed another less secured route leading to an eventual extra exit to the outside.\n\n\nGoing outside onto the ground of ACA-\u2588\u2588 led to an easy return to the vehicles they arrived with. No security clearance proof was taken into the ACA at the onset of the mission.\n\n\nAll discoveries made in this Physical penetration mission have been presented to Site-director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to ensure ease of adjustments to secure ACA-\u2588\u2588 better in the future.\n\n\nAny of the specific security flaws mentioned in this report have already been fixed and tested again to be sure of the improvement of onsite security\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Mission\u00a0report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
