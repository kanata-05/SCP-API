As of 02/16/2018, further testing is postponed pending Level 4/3302 approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3302 is a single DVD, specifically disc one of season one of the U.S. version of the television sitcom, \u201cThe Office.\u201d Notably, it is autographed by actor John Krasinski with the dedication, \u201cIf all else fails, mug thirty degrees to either side.\u201d This is suspected to be a reference to a reaction colloquially known as \u201cThe Jim Look,\u201d named for the character he portrayed on the show.\n\n\nSCP-3302\u2019s anomalous properties manifest when viewed by human beings. From the point of the first \u201cJim Look\u201d onward, viewers will uncontrollably recreate the \u201cJim Look\u201d action every time they perceive a statement as unintelligent. This reaction will go unnoticed by the subject unless brought to their attention; repeatedly bringing this to their attention may cause non-anomalous emotional distress at their apparent lack of self-control.\n\n\nInterview Log:\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-3086 (Initial owner of SCP-3302)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Evans\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nEvans:\n How are you doing today D-3086?\n\n\nD-3086:\n At least the food\u2019s better than the swill they served at the homeless shelter.\n\n\nEvans:\n I\u2019m glad to hear that. \n(Evans\u2019 watch beeps.)\n Oh, one moment\u2026 My shoes are on the wrong feet, but that\u2019s okay because I have two left feet anyway; either way I\u2019ve got it right.\n\n\nD-3086 looks to the left of Researcher Evans. He then returns his gaze to Researcher Evans and continues the conversation.\n\n\nD-3086:\n Yeah, so?\n\n\nEvans:\n No reason. Our background check shows that you only recently became homeless. Can you elaborate on why?\n\n\nD-3086:\n I really don\u2019t know\u2026 I had my life all together, but one day my wife just started getting mad at everything I did. Didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t even say nothing, she just thought I was making fun of her all the time and got so riled up that she kicked me out of the damn house! I just kind of wandered around a while with the only things I could grab on the way out.\n\n\nEvans:\n Yes, the possessions you were discovered with. \n(Evans\u2019 watch beeps.)\n Ah, Star Wars: Episode One was definitely the best of the entire series, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\n\nD-3086 looks slightly to the right of Researcher Evans.

But what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\n\n\nEvans:\n Sorry, just a random thought. Continue please, what happened after you were thrown out by your wife?\n\n\nD-3086:\n Well, I just kind of wandered for a while, but everywhere I went, people would say two sentences to me and just flip out like I was some kind of jerk. I didn\u2019t do anything to them! Even your agent fella who approached me in the soup line was kind of a jerk.\n\n\nEvans:\n I\u2019m sorry to hear it. Is there anything we can do to make your stay here more comfortable?\n\n\nD-3086 looks to the right of Researcher Evans.\n\n\nD-3086:\n You mean in my cell?\n\n\nEvans:\n Point taken.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 02/16/2018:\n A letter was found underneath D-3086\u2019s pillow despite no signs of containment breach.
