Only personnel with level 2 clearance or higher who are trained to operate SCP-6843 are authorised to interact with SCP-6843. SCP-6843 is to be kept within the designated containment chamber when operated once a month.\n\n\nThere must be a minimum of two onsite staff with level 2 clearance or higher trained to fully operate SCP-6843. A copy of the \u2018Trial of Fire 3: Walkthrough\u2019 document is required to be within 1 meter range of SCP-6843.\n1\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6843 is an unbranded laptop. SCP-6843 indefinitely runs a program called \u2018Trial By Fire III\u2019. Furthermore, the program \u2018Trial By Fire III\u2019 - designated SCP-6843-1 - cannot be exited. No other software can be executed on SCP-6843. No computer data can be uploaded onto SCP-6843 or downloaded from SCP-6843. All attempts to access any data on SCP-6843 have so far failed. Material testing of SCP-6843 illustrates that it is made of an indestructible unknown substance that imitates the appearance and properties of glass, plastic, and stainless steel. X-ray analysis of SCP-6843 interior does not highlight anything anomalous. However, no corporation logos, serial numbers, or writing - excluding the symbols on the keyboard - of any kind can be found on both the interior and exterior SCP-6843.\n\n\nSCP-6843-1 resembles and functions as a typical early 1990s point and click adventure game. The title screen of SCP-6843-1 states that it is Version 1.9 and that it was developed in 1991 by Dune Mountain Games. \nResearch into a Dune Mountain Games or additional versions, successors or predecessors of \u2018Trial By Fire III\u2019 have been unproductive.\n The use of the Foundation-operated web analysis bot Oscar-12 (\"DUNE-HUNTER\") has since lead to the discovery of an additional SCP that runs a program bearing the name \u2018Trial By Fire'.\n2\n\n\nHuman subjects who press any key on SCP-6843's keyboard initiate SCP-6843-1. Subjects who have started SCP-6843-1 are unable to sleep, eat, drink or move more than 1 meter away from SCP-6843 until it is completed. Subjects observed playing SCP-6843-1 for extended periods of time suffer from a number of afflictions caused by a lack of movement and poor hydration/nutritional intake. Subjects unable to complete SCP-6843-1 ultimately expire from dehydration, exhaustion and deep vein thrombosis. If a subject playing SCP-6843-1 dies before completing SCP-6843-1, SCP-6843 reboots to the program's title screen and all progress is lost.\n\n\nSCP-6843-1 must be started and completed before the first Tuesday of every month EST time. Failure to start SCP-6843-1 before the first Tuesday of the month results in the immediate fatalities of 10 random persons within a 10 mile radius. Failure to start SCP-6843-1 by the following Tuesday results in the number of deceased and the range of SCP-6843's influence to grow exponentially every week until the game is started. If no persons are within the initial radius of SCP-6843 by the first Tuesday of the month, SCP-6843's influence will grow until the number of victims matches the number of Tuesdays SCP-6843-1 has not been started. Additionally, if SCP-6843-1 has not been completed before the next first Tuesday of the next month, the fatality rate reaches 100 persons within a 100 mile radius and the cycle restarts. Autopsy reports from SCP-6843 victims show rapid cell deterioration and shrinkage in critical organs, similar to the effects of severe dehydration.\n\n\nSubjects dedicated to operating SCP-6843 have remarked they feel a strong sense of joy originating from SCP-6843 when they initiated SCP-6843-1. Likewise, subjects report a sense of fulfilment from SCP-6843 when they completed SCP-6843-1 and a sense of anger when not operated. It is theorised, therefore, that SCP-6843's termination of individuals who have yet to interact with SCP-6843 stems from a possible desire for attention.\n\n\nSCP-6843 was recovered from the Central Library in Los Angeles, California on October 14, 2018 after numerous spontaneous fatalities were reported in local news outlets. Field Agent Roberta Laurence noticed SCP-6843 powered on in the library\u2019s storage. Laurence started SCP-6843-1 and immediately noticed she was unable to step away from SCP-6843. When Laurence\u2019s partner physically tried to restrain her, she overpowered him, killing him in the struggle. Laurence was terminated by a third Field Agent and SCP-6843 was secured. There was no evidence of SCP-6843 in the library\u2019s records apart from an unauthored walkthrough of SCP-6843-1 with the title \u2018Trial of Fire 3: Walkthrough\u2019. The walkthrough has no anomalous properties and is printed on standard A4 paper from the same stock as used by the library. The walkthrough is accurate - apart from the title - and it is generally considered impossible to complete SCP-6843-1 without it.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0See\u00a0below\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0full\u00a0transcribed\u00a0copy\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0'Trial\u00a0By\u00a0Fire\u00a0III'\u00a0walkthrough:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Walkthrough\n\n\n\n\nTrial of Fire 3 was released by Dune Mountain Games in 1991. It follows the adventures of Blue Dog McVinny as he gets lost through time trying to find his car keys to his legendary Red Toyota MR2. The Keys were stolen by the evil but handsome fire wizard called Trolby and his forgetful crew of sugar munching mini demons. Blue Dog McVinny must use all his might and brains to find and defeat Trolby or forever lose access to his Red Toyota MR2, the love of his life.\n\n\nTrial of Fire 3 Walkthrough:\n\n\nBack Streets of LA\n\nPick up \nSmoking Cigarette\n.

Every twenty-eight lines they will turn their back away from you for twelve seconds. While Trolby is distracted: Click on the vent of the bottom left of the screen. Pull the Vent. Look at the Vent. Talk to the Vent until the Vent tells you that it is nicotine deprived. Give \ncoin\n to the Vent in exchange for a \nWorm\n.\n\n\nLet Trolby finish their speech before they let you go from boredom by opening your cell.

If Blue Dog McVinny just opens the movie case a \nYellow Slip of Paper\n will fallout. Take \nYellow Slip of Paper\n.\n\n\nLeave the mall without talking to anyone. Walk to the north and then the west. Talk to the man outside the government building and then use the \nnaked lady picture\n on him and he\u2019ll invite you in and also give you the passcode to the door. Speak with him a few times to get him to show you his \nmole\n on his left buttocks. Use \nKnife\n on the \nmole\n. He\u2019ll bleed to death and drop a patch of skin with a \nmole\n on it. Grab the patch of skin with a \nmole\n on it then exit on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\n\nReturn to the mall and enter the movie store. Use \nKnife\n on the dead owner. Exit the mall.

When the soldier leaves for the bathroom use \nKnife\n on soldier. Walk through the door the soldier was guarding.\n\n\nBy now the building should start to crumble as it is hit by nanorobotic artillery. Head west twice and then north seven times. Talk to the nanorobot gang leader. Offer to help them win the union suitcase against the nanorobot proletariat. You will be transported to a court room.\n\n\nWhenever you talk to the judge remember to right click on them and press the \u2018your great honour\u2019 option rather than the usual talk command. Watch the 18-minute cut scene. If the judge is an orange nanobot, restart the game. Otherwise continue the trail choosing any options that put the nanorobot gang leader in favour. Usually, the court case does not take longer than two hours to complete. Regardless of your choices the judge will vote in favour of the nanorobot proletariat. Use \nmagic moon sword\n on the judge.\n\n\nHead W, W, W, W, W, W, E, W, W, N, S, W, N, E, NE, NW, NE, S.\n\n\nWalk further north and your screen will fill up with angry nanorobot proletariat. Use the \nSmoking Cigarette\n on the nanorobot that is two pixels wide rather than one (warning you only have twelve seconds to do this). The time portal will break through the burning floor and exclaim that it was lonely without you. Wait three to six seconds and talk to time portal. Tell the time portal you\u2019ll never leave it alone again and propose to marry the time portal. Push time portal. Open time portal.\n\n\nIsle of the Time Marriage\n\n\nFrom this point forward, do not pick up any items in the game even if this walkthrough tells you too. They will result in an immediate game over. You may, however, exchange items.\n\n\nTalk to the priest hovering over the golden pond.\n\n\nGo north and throw the \nmagic moon sword\n in the void of infinity. Talk to the void of infinity. Tell them that you wish to get married. At this point a box on your screen will appear asking you to explain why you would like to get married and what love is. You are to type an explanation no more than five thousand words but no less than two thousand. Only half (but no less than a third) of the words may be dedicated to explaining why you would like to get married. You are allowed up to thirty-two spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n\nWalk south and ignore the Attractive lady. Instead use the \nknife\n on the wedding guests to create a meat swan. Talk to the Attractive lady. Talk about the meat swan twice. Talk to the priest hovering over the silver pond.\n\n\nWhen you marry time portal you will be given two options. Do not click the yes option or you cannot complete the game. Click no. However, if you picked up the Blue Shoes you cannot click no and must click yes. In this case you can complete the game like normal.\n\n\nIf you married time portal push time portal. Open time portal.\n\n\nIf you did not marry time portal head south. Enter the bunker before Time Portal explodes. Talk to the Attractive Lady. Offer to marry the Attractive Lady. The Attractive Lady will refuse your offer. Right click on the Attractive Lady and click the new option of Rape.\n\n\nFront Streets of LA\n\n\nYou will wake up in your apartment again. Follow the same routine of leaving as in the first section of this walkthrough but you do not need to pick up the \nSmoking Cigarette\n or the \nBrass Key\n.\n\n\nWalk north and then northwest back to the Chinese takeaway. Enter the Chinese takeaway and exchange the \nSmoking Cigarette\n for the \nsweet and sour pork\n.\n\n\nLeave and enter the museum. Talk to the museum curator fifty-one times. They eventually mention their unopened exhibition on time machines. Push the curator and they will fall down the stairs and attract the guards. Use \nknife\n on the guards. During the eight-minute cut scene if you slice the throats of any guards, immediately restart your game. Pick up the \nsecurity key\n on the ground.\n\n\nWalk to the unopened exhibit. Push the unopened exhibit door.\n\n\nTalk to one of the guard\u2019s children until they mention Ted finding a working time machine. Find the child who is swinging on the purple time machine, this is Ted. If you attempt to walk into the purple time machine Ted will press a button and a black hole will reset the universe and your game. Talk to Ted and ask to use the time machine. Talk to the children again until one of them mentions that Ted is allergic to cats (this usually takes about anywhere from four to three thousand attempts). Give the \nsweet and sour pork\n to Ted. Ted will curl up and die, dropping the time machine control remote into your hands.\n\n\nBefore entering the purple time machine head back to your apartment. Walk out of your apartment. Walk W, N, W, W, W, W, W, E, E, NE, SW. Then head back to your apartment. Head back to the museum and use the purple time machine.\n\n\nThe Path to Orgy Mountain\n\n\nNow it\u2019s time to climb the Path to Orgy Mountain. Talk to the mini demons who are eating sugar. They will inform you about a great orgy happening at the top of the mountain. Go to the mountain path and use the instructional description board on how to climb the mountain. Click on the letters P L E A S E D O N O T H I T M E A N Y M O R E M U M M Y on the description board to open the paths gate. Use the path until you reach the next puzzle.\n\n\nFor the second puzzle you\u2019ll find another board with a demon. Talk to the demon and type \u2018My life grows short. Why have you done this to me? All I had was you and you left me for that thing.\u2019 But in French. The demon will give you a kiss and pull out your heart telling you that you no longer need it. The path will now open. Push demon. Use path.\n\n\nClimb up the path to the third puzzle. There are four buttons here. Stand still for five minutes and think about your life. How did you get here? What trials and puzzles awaited you in your adventure game? Will you get a happy ending, or will you be doomed to fail over and over? The final path will open. Use path.\n\n\nAn old woman and an old man will be found at the top of the mountain. Blue Dog McVinny will remark that they look familiar. Ignore them and enter the Orgy Hut. Watch the twenty-three-minute cut scene until portal opens. You may stay here if you wish but to continue click on the portal.\n\n\nTunnels of Love\n\n\nYou will appear inside a tunnel with a pink snake. If the snake is yellow, reset your game. Talk to the snake and ask for a way out of the tunnels. The snake will ignore you and remark that it does not understand you because it is a snake.\n\n\ntake these directions:\n\n\nN, N, E, E, N S, W, W, N, W, E, E, E, E, N, N, W, S, E, N, W, N S, W, W, N, to the first puzzle room.

Walk west.\n\n\nHead north and N, N, N, W, W to find the apartment you started out in. Follow the same routine of leaving as in the first section of this walkthrough but you do not need to pick up the \nSmoking Cigarette\n or the \nBrass Key\n.\n\n\nW, E, W, E to the lava room. Walk across the lava.\n\n\nW, W, N, W and climb the ladder. You\u2019ll now be on the second level of the love tunnels.\n\n\nS, S, S, S, W, S, S, S and descend the stairs to the third level of the love tunnels.\n\n\nNW, SW, SW, S, W, E, W, E, E, E, E, E, E to slide down the fun slide of love. You will now hear a baby crying.\n\n\nWalk east to the damp warm red room. Enter the room and there will be a baby in the top left corner crying. Talk to baby and Blue Dog McVinny will find a note saying \u2018unwanted baby of love. Please enjoy\u2019. Once Blue Dog McVinny finished reading the note use the \nknife\n on the baby to open the final portal. You will lose the knife here forever so do not worry when Blue Dog McVinny says it will need to find another knife later.\n\n\nPush baby portal. Open baby portal.\n\n\nLayer of the Evil but Handsome Fire Wizard Called Trolby\n\n\nInside the Layer of the Evil but Handsome Fire Wizard Called Trolby walk West and open the North door to the eastern wing of the layer. Navigate the maze in the eastern wing until you find Trolby\u2019s bedroom. Exit the room and walk backwards through the maze. You\u2019ll fall into a trap and enter back into the cell from the start of the game.\n\n\nExit the cell and use the seventy third lever from the right. A screen will turn on and show you Trolby in the shower. Here you will hear Trolby talk about his safe that has your \ncar keys\n in the western hall. Note down the three-digit password Trolby talks about.\n\n\nExit the room and head west until you find an old woman and an old man. Blue Dog McVinny again will mention they are important. Ignore them and enter the west hall.\n\n\nWalk south until you find a large painting of Trolby riding on top of a large purple and green tentacle dildo. If the tentacle is Green and Orange, reset your game.\n\n\nPush the painting. Open the painting.\n\n\nWalk through the secret door and you will find the safe.\n\n\nEnter the three-digit password Trolby talked about in the shower. The safe will open to reveal your \ncar keys\n. Pick up \nRed Toyota MR2\n. Wait thirty seconds.\n\n\nTrolby will come in to meet you. Trolby will begin to cast a fire ball. When Trolby\u2019s fireball turns blue Push Trolby. Trolby will fall to the ground. Talk to Trolby and ask him why. Trolby will begin a cut scene speech talking about how it\u2019s time he reveals everything he knows about the world you have explored. Why this is happening to both you and him. And how you can stop it. As soon as the cut scene ends, do not let Trolby speak and use the \nBrass Key\n on him. Blue Dog McVinny will shank Trolby with the \nBrass Key\n in the neck and he will fall back and die. If Blue Dog McVinny does not shank Trolby, reset the game immediately or the game will freeze for thirteen hours and reset by itself.\n\n\nWatch the final cut scene of Blue Dog McVinny driving off into the sunset.\n\n\nCongratulations you\u2019ve completed Trial of Fire 3!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-6843 - 1:\n Lectures are offered to all onsite personnel with level 2 clearance and above by Dr. Leetam who will use recordings of SCP-6843-1 to educate staff on how to efficiently complete the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-6843 - 2:\n Although personnel are encouraged to learn SCP-6843-1 in the event that assigned trained staff are incapacitated, there have been recent discouraging reports surrounding SCP-6843 use by employees of the Foundation.
