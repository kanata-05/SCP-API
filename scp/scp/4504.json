SCP-4504\u2019s primary and secondary cells and the immediate corridors around them are to be fitted with Halothane gas dispersal systems, which should be activated immediately if SCP-4504 attempts to breach containment.\n\n\nIn the event the Halothane dispersal system is insufficient to incapacitate SCP-4504, staff are to avoid entering its reach and instead should attempt to incapacitate it from a distance using flash-bang grenades, stun grenades and Halothane gas grenades. Staff are to avoid engaging SCP-4504 with kinetic weapons, water cannons, standard-issue tasers and pepper spray. Staff approaching after it has been incapacitated should do so cautiously, as SCP-4504 has feigned unconsciousness in the past in order to lure security staff close enough to strike them.\n\n\nSCP-4504 is to be spoonfed two 50mg \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 tablets twice daily in order to treat its chronic pain and maintain its mental health. Medical staff are to ensure that the tablets have been swallowed before leaving the containment cell.\n\n\nAs of 29/11/2017 Site Director Sandoval has ended testing with SCP-4504 in order to prevent future staff casualties. SCP-4504 is no longer allowed socialisation privileges. In the event that SCP-4504 displays non-compliant behaviour, staff should remind it that it will lose leisure privileges if it continues in that behaviour.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4504 (Formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a thirty-five year old Chinese-Australian human male. As a result of its use of its anomalous abilities on itself, SCP-4504 stands 2.64m tall, possessing distorted features and greatly elongated limbs. These distortions render it resistant to both kinetic impacts and extreme pain. SCP-4504 is missing both of its hands as a result of an encounter with \nSCP-082\n during a previous containment breach.\n\n\nSCP-4504 can manifest two invisible \u2018hands\u2019 at the ends of its arms. Their shape is proportionate to SCP-4504\u2019s distorted body, each \u2018palm\u2019 approximately 20cm in diameter and each \u2018finger\u2019 being between 45cm and 60cm in length. These \u2018hands\u2019 warp space, allowing SCP-4504 to mould solid objects it touches with them as if they were only semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid physical substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, lead, beryllium bronze and flesh, as they distort the space containing the substance as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Affected substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 cannot interact with solid objects with its manifested hands without distorting them. SCP-4504\u2019s hands have reduced effect on non-solids such as liquids or gases.\n\n\nCurrently, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair affected areas simply create a second, overlapping distortion. Staff and test subjects whose bodies have been affected by SCP-4504 report extreme, chronic pain to the affected area. Affected areas of flesh will continue to function as normal unless the distortion disconnects parts of the subject\u2019s body or exposes internal organs. Foundation medical staff have found conventional painkillers to be only partially effective in mitigating the subsequent pain.\n\n\nSCP-4504 readily admits to a deep-seated hatred of the Foundation, particularly its security personnel and past psychiatrists. SCP-4504 has repeatedly expressed a desire to escape containment. To date it has attempted to breach containment 83 times, resulting in four successful escapes from Site-\u2588\u2588. During its more recent containment breaches, SCP-4504 has not attempted to flee the facility, instead seeking out and maiming specific members of Foundation staff it bears a grudge against. These have typically been senior security officers who have made decisions about SCP-4504\u2019s containment it objects to, such as restricting its contact with other humanoid SCP objects, interfering with its painkiller regimen or revoking its leisure privileges. To date, SCP-4504 has not harmed a member of on-site medical staff with the exception of its own psychiatrists, and has discouraged other humanoid SCP objects from doing so during containment breaches.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nPrevious iterations of this document have been archived and are available to 4504 staff upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nEuclid\n\n\nDocument revised as of 28/11/2010. Staff should consult newest version for up-to-date containment procedures\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n \nSCP-4504 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-\u2588\u2588. SCP-4504 must be fitted with Midas-class water cuffs before any transportation through the site, with the cuffs being removed upon arrival.\n\n\nTo date, SCP-4504 has not harmed a member of Foundation staff. In the event of a potential containment breach, staff should remain out of reach of SCP-4504 and incapacitate it using pepper spray, standard-issue tasers and water cannons.\n\n\nAs a result of good behaviour, SCP-4504 is currently allowed socialisation and leisure privileges.\n\n\nDescription:\n \nSCP-4504 (formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a twenty-five year old Chinese-Australian male standing 1.77m tall. SCP-4504 possesses the ability to warp space with its hands, moulding solid objects as if they were semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, [DATA REDACTED] and flesh, as the effect distorts space as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Affected substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 struggles to distort non-solids such as liquids or gases.\n\n\nAt present, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair the affected areas simply result in a second, overlapping distortion. Animals subjected to SCP-4504\u2019s effect have reacted in ways indicating extreme pain and distress. However, the distortions do not impact the function of biological tissue they unless said distortion exposes internal organs or removes part of the flesh in whole. \nSCP-4504 has refused to participate in testing on human subjects.\n\n\nSCP-4504 was acquired by the Foundation on 12/3/2008. Foundation agents detected a report of several small spatial distortions discovered in a shed in suburban Brisbane. The properties\u2019 landlord directed them to SCP-4504, who had lived there previously. When apprehended by Foundation agents, SCP-4504 entered Foundation custody willingly and without resistance, believing them to be agents of ASIO.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-4504\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\u00a0with\u00a0SCP-4504\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Weber\n\n\nForeword:\n An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s fortnightly interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 04/07/2008. SCP-4504 was reporting good mental health and often used these interviews to make formal requests regarding its containment. Two site security officers were also present.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 14:40>\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m glad the plants are helping you, Dennis. We\u2019re almost out of time, but when we were starting you mentioned you had another request.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Uh, yeah. Look, I\u2019m really grateful to you guys for keeping me safe like this. You explained to me about the dangers for people like me out there, with guys like the GOC or the, uh\u2026 Marshall\u2026 guys?\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Marshall, Carter & Dark?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Yeah, the rich fucks. I get it. The P in SCP stands for protecting me as much as protecting the world from dangerous people like me. I get it.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Dennis, we cannot give permission for you to leave Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Aw, come on!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s simply not possible.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Look, you said no to contact with family. Fine. You need to protect the Matrix, or normality, or whatever. Sure. But you can\u2019t keep me locked up like this. I need to get out, to be outside.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n If you would like to request more time outside in the exercise area I\u2019m sure we can-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No I don\u2019t want time in the exercise area!\n\n\nSCP-4504 leans forward out of its seat aggressively. Security staff instruct SCP-4504 to return to its seat and calm down.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Okay, okay. Look, I just- huh, I- the yard fucking sucks, okay? I go outside to stand on some fucking astroturf and run around in circles for an hour or two. I\u2019m still surrounded by four concrete walls. I\u2019m still standing on concrete no matter how much fake plastic shit you layer on top of it. And I\u2019m still being stared at by the same fucking prison guards with guns. \nSCP-4504 gestures to the attending security officers.\n It\u2019s depressing! I want to go somewhere where I can see the horizon. I wanna feel real grass under my feet. I wanna see an actual fucking tree, not just a potted plant in my room. Even- even if security just walks me around the outside of the facility walls, or something. Anything! I\u2019m not a criminal, you shouldn\u2019t treat me like this!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry Dennis, but we simply cannot take that risk. If you would like, we can discuss alternatives, like painting a horizon mural on the inside of the wall-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Fuck! No! I don\u2019t- look, it\u2019ll be fine. I promise. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. It only has to be for an hour or two, I\u2019ll do exactly what the guards say-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry, Dennis. But its simply not possible. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Huh\u2026 No.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Then we\u2019re finished for the day. I\u2019ll see you again next week.\n\n\n<End Log, 14:50>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-4504 was escorted back to its containment cell immediately afterwards. Shortly thereafter, it used its art supplies to deface the wall of its containment cell with the words \u201cYOU'RE HERE FOREVER\u201d. SCP-4504 was subsequently ordered to remove the vandalism by security staff. Per the advice of staff psychiatrist Dr Weber, the Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s exercise area was closed for three days while staff painted a mural resembling the horizon on two walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a04504/8-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a04504/8-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4504/8-1\n\n\nResearch Team:\n Senior Researcher Dr Hugh Gosse, Junior Researcher Dr Muhammed Al-Harthi\n\n\nParticipant:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nSubject:\n One adult male Sus Domesticus\n\n\nPurpose:\n To determine the effects of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly on a living creature.\n\n\nPreparation:\n The Sus Domesticus was restrained on a table with leather straps. Researchers Gosse and Al-Harthi were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nExperiment:\n \nSCP-4504 is introduced to the testing chamber and is instructed to approach the subject, place its hand on it and use its anomaly. SCP-4504 hesitates. Research team prompts SCP-4504 to approach the subject. SCP-4504 expresses reluctance and is reminded that if it does not comply it will be reprimanded. SCP-4504 complies, placing its hand on the creature\u2019s thigh and pushing into it.\n\n\nThe subject immediately begins screaming and thrashing against its restraints. SCP-4504 retreats to the far corner of the room. The subject continues to scream, struggling hard enough to shake the table. SCP-4504 requests permission to leave the testing chamber, although this is not heard by the research team due to the subject\u2019s volume. After twelve seconds, SCP-4504 repeats its request, loud enough to be heard.\n\n\nResearch team instructs SCP-4504 to approach the table again and touch the subject, this time pushing its hand into its brain. SCP-4504 expresses distress and asks permission to leave the testing chamber. Research team reminds SCP-4504 that if it does not comply with instructions it will be reprimanded.\n\n\nSCP-4504 re-approaches the table and moves to place its hand on the subject\u2019s head. The creature twists its head around and bites SCP-4504 on the palm. SCP-4504 vocalises distress and retreats from the subject, holding its bleeding hand. Testing cancelled and SCP-4504 given permission to leave the testing chamber.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-4504 was escorted to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary by security staff. En route to the infirmary, SCP-4504 reported feeling faint and lost consciousness. This was likely a result of security staff following containment procedures and placing SCP-4504 in Midas water cuffs, preventing SCP-4504 from putting pressure on its wound. Research team reprimanded for improperly restraining the test subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Breach Report 42/H\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 28/11/2010\n\n\nIncident:\n At approximately 1230 hours, SCPs-4504 breached containment during a socialisation meeting at the Site-\u2588\u2588 cafeteria, along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Over the next 20 minutes, SCP-4504 was able to breach walls and floors using its anomaly, freeing thirteen other humanoid SCP objects. Although almost all were recontained, SCP-4504 and four other humanoid SCP objects breached containment and escaped from Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDuring the containment breach, SCP-4504 refused to use its anomaly on security staff even in situations where it would have directly benefited from it. It also attempted to discourage other humanoid SCP objects from harming staff, although this was ineffective in the case of SCPs-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and -\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, resulting in 16 casualties among site staff.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Epsilon-10 (\u201cManhunters\u201d) have been assigned to pursue the escaped anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nDocument revised as of 14/01/2013. Staff should consult newest version for up-to-date containment procedures\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n \nSCP-4504 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-\u2588\u2588. The walls, door, floor and roof of SCP-4504\u2019s cell are to be interwoven with a grid of live electrical wires. These wires should be permanently charged with the same voltage as a standard-issue taser, to prevent SCP-4504 from exiting its cell through the walls. The spaces in the grid should be no larger than 6cm by 6cm, to prevent SCP-4504 from reaching its hand through them.\n\n\nSCP-4504 must be fitted with Midas-class water cuffs before any transportation through the site. These cuffs are not to be removed until it returns to its cell.\n\n\nIn the event of a potential containment breach, staff should remain out of reach of SCP-4504 and incapacitate it using pepper spray, standard-issue tasers and water cannons.\n\n\nOn 28/11/2010, SCP-4504 breached containment and escaped in cooperation with 2 other humanoid SCP objects, evading recontainment for a period of 7 months. As such, SCP-4504 is denied socialisation privileges although leisure privileges may be provided to it dependant on good behaviour.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4504 (formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a twenty-eight year old Chinese-Australian male standing 1.77m tall. SCP-4504 possesses the ability to warp space with its hands, \u2018moulding\u2019 solid objects as if they were semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, [DATA REDACTED] and flesh, as the energy fields are distorting space as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Distorted substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 struggles to distort non-solids such as liquids or gases.\n\n\nAt present, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair the distortions simply result in a second, overlapping distortion. Animals subjected to SCP-4504\u2019s distortion effect have reacted in ways indicating extreme pain and distress. However, the distortions do not impact the function of biological tissue they unless said distortion exposes internal organs or removes part of the flesh wholesale. SCP-4504 has refused to participate in testing on human subjects.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 45/I\n\n\nDate:\n 13/6/2011\n\n\nIncident:\n Immediately after being returned to containment in its cell at 1700 hours, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by breaking through a wall, despite having been informed of the new containment measures in place. SCP-4504 contacted one of the electric wires and received a painful shock. Security staff entered SCP-4504\u2019s cell and subdued it using pepper spray. Staff sustained no injuries.\n\n\nIncident Report 46/J\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 14/06/2011\n\n\nIncident:\n At 0540 hours, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by breaking through one of its cell walls. SCP-4504 contacted one of the electric wires and received a painful shock. Security staff entered SCP-4504\u2019s cell and subdued it using pepper spray. Staff sustained no injuries. Security staff instructed by Site Director Sandoval to only respond to attempted containment breaches by SCP-4504 if it manages to leave its cell.\n\n\nIncident Report 48/K\n\n\nDate:\n 15/06/2011 to 20/06/2011\n\n\nIncident:\n Over the course of the five days indicated, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment of its cell nine times. Each time it failed, contacting one of the electric wires and receiving a painful shock. After the third, fifth, sixth and ninth attempted breaches SCP-4504 received treatment from medical staff for second-degree electrical burns.\n\n\nIncident Report 50/L\n\n\nDate:\n 21/06/2011\n\n\nIncident:\n While in-transit to its first session with staff psychiatrist Dr Weber since re-entering containment, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by assaulting its security officers and fleeing from them while restrained with Midas-class water cuffs. Security officers swiftly subdued SCP-4504 using pepper spray and physical force.\n\n\nAt their discretion, security officers returned SCP-4504 to its cell, postponing its session with Dr Weber for another fortnight in order to discourage future attempts to breach containment. Site medical staff treated SCP-4504 in its cell for a concussion and two fractured ribs. Security staff reported negligible injuries.\n\n\nIncident Report 54/M\n\n\nDate:\n 05/07/2011\n\n\nIncident:\n While attending a session with Dr Weber at 1420 hours, SCP-4504 became emotionally unstable and aggressive. Security staff subdued SCP-4504 using pepper spray and physical force before returning SCP-4504 to its cell. Medical staff treated SCP-4504 in its cell for a broken nose and dislocated shoulder. Security staff reported negligible injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4504 Formal Request 19/07/2011\n\n\n\n\nAssisting Staff Member:\n Dr Herman Weber\n\n\nRequest:\n SCP-4504 formally requests the holes in its cell caused by its breach attempts be repaired. SCP-4504 states that they often spark loudly causing him anxiety and difficulty falling asleep, and that they are unsafe to move around due to the electrical hazard.\n\n\nResponse:\n Request denied. We do not have another cell prepared to house SCP-4504 while repairs are made. The chance is too great that this is another attempt to breach containment, and those holes only exist because SCP-4504 attempted such in the first place. We reap what we sow. - \nSite Director Sandoval\n\n\nSCP-4504 Formal Request 19/07/2011\n\n\n\n\nAssisting Staff Member:\n Dr Herman Weber\n\n\nRequest:\n SCP-4504 formally requests the re-instatement of its socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 states that the removal of these privileges for so long has caused it significant distress and that the return of its ability to converse with non-staff persons would be greatly beneficial to its mental health.\n\n\nResponse:\n Request denied. SCP-4504 has breached containment with the assistance of other humanoid SCP objects in the past. Allowing it this contact would inevitably lead to another attempted containment breach. SCP-4504 will have to content itself with conversations with security staff and its assigned psychiatrist. - \nSite Director Sandoval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Report\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Report\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4504 Psychiatric Report 13/09/2011\n\n\n\n\nAssigned Psychiatrist:\n Dr Herman Weber\n\n\nReport:\n SCP-4504 presents with the following symptoms: depressed mood, irritability, psychomotor impairment, chronic fatigue, chronic insomnia, decreased interest in leisure activities and significant weight loss.

Researchers Gosse and Al-Harthi were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window. SCP-4504\u2019s compliance for the test was acquired by offering the return of its socialisation privileges provided it follow the research team\u2019s instructions.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nExperiment:\n \nSCP-4504 enters the testing chamber. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach D-66549 and use its anomaly on his hand. SCP-4504 hesitates. The research team reminds SCP-4504 that if it does not cooperate during the test its socialisation privileges will not be restored. D-66549 vocalises distress and asks SCP-4504 to not cooperate. SCP-4504 hesitates again. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549 and approaches him.\n\n\nSCP-4504 pushes the index and middle fingers on its right hand into the back of D-66549\u2019s hand. Immediately, D-66549 begins struggling against his restraints, screaming and vocalising expletives. The research team asks D-66549 how he feels and if he is in pain. D-66549 vocalises more expletives and confirms that he is in extreme pain. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549 again, eliciting more expletives.\n\n\nThe research team instructs SCP-4504 to push its fingers into D-66549\u2019s forehead. SCP-4504 hesitates and requests that the experiment be discontinued, stating the research team should have enough data. D-66549 agrees. The research team disagrees, reminding SCP-4504 that its socialisation privileges will not be restored if it does not comply and again instructing it to push its fingers into D-66549\u2019s forehead. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549.\n\n\nSCP-4504 pushes the index and middle fingers on its right hand into D-66549\u2019s forehead. D-66549 resumes screaming at volume. D-66549 does not cease this behaviour when SCP-4504 removes its fingers from his forehead, nor when the research team asks him to describe the sensation. SCP-4504 asks to be able to leave the testing chamber and return to its cell. The research team permits it to do so.\n\n\n[END TEST LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Site medical staff entered the testing chamber and moved D-66549 to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary. D-66549 was observed for the next 72 hours. D-66549 reported extreme chronic pain where SCP-4504 had touched it for the entire duration. He reported that the pain did not dull with time and remained as painful as when it had first been subjected to the effect. D-66549 reported that his thought process and cognitive capacity were unimpeded. However, D-66549 was observed to suffer from insomnia, which he reported was due to his chronic pain. Even with the assistance of pain and somnic medications D-66549 was unable to sleep. After 72 hours, D-66549 requested euthanization. The research team agreed and ended the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Weber\n\n\nForeword:\n An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s fortnightly interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 14/02/2012. Two site security officers were also present.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 14:30>\n\n\nDr Weber:\n That\u2019s unfortunate, Dennis. But I was wondering if I could ask you about something?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Huhhh\u2026 sure, why not?\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019ve received reports from the site orderlies that you\u2019ve ceased cutting your hair and nails.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Yeah, you noticed.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Yes. I was wondering why you had decided to do that? Self-care is important, so I\u2019m a little concerned to see you\u2019re no longer maintaining proper hygiene.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Heh, its okay. You can say what you mean. These fucks- \nSCP-4504 gestures to the attending security officers\n -are worried I\u2019m growing my nails longer because I\u2019m trying to increase how far I can reach, or something.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Is that what you\u2019re doing?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Nah, it\u2019s because of something else.\n\n\nPause in conversation for five seconds.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Would you mind telling me what that thing is?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Well, I would, but there\u2019s no point. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s part of what makes you such a shit psychiatrist.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n That\u2019s hardly fair, Dennis.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n It\u2019s entirely fair. Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall, or tryna herd cats. I explain stuff over and over but you just don\u2019t get it.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I feel like we\u2019re getting off topic. Your fingernails, Dennis?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Hah yeah, heaven forbid we waste time on shit that doesn\u2019t matter. Anyway, uh\u2026 have you ever read the Handmaid\u2019s Tale?\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I can\u2019t say that I have. Is this relevant to-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Shit, I was hoping that would explain it. Um. I\u2019m doing it because how long my hair and nails are is one of the few things I have control over anymore. I don\u2019t get to choose where I go, where I sleep, what I do, what I eat- I have no control over any part of my life. But this? I control this.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I understand you feel that way Dennis. But perhaps you should consider allowing the nursing staff to trim them? They are rather unhygienic. It would be what\u2019s best for your health after all.\n\n\nSCP-4504 exhales for three seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 60/N\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 03/06/2012\n\n\nIncident:\n At 2230 hours while in its cell SCP-4504 used its anomaly on itself, bending the tip of one of its fingernails. SCP-4504 was careful to avoid the tip of its finger so as to not distort its own flesh. Security staff believe this is the reason why SCP-4504 has been refusing to allow medical staff to cut its hair or nails for the past several months and that the SCP is testing to see if it can use its anomaly on its own body. Senior Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 recommends medical staff cut SCP-4504\u2019s fingernails at the next opportunity.\n\n\nResponse:\n Senior Nurse \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cannot authorise the cutting of SCP-4504\u2019s nails. The nature of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly makes interacting with its hands without its consent unwise at best. If left alone, it is likely that SCP-4504\u2019s nails will break on their own or SCP-4504 will ask staff to assist it cut its nails.\n\n\nIncident Report 78/O\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 09/08/2012\n\n\nIncident:\n At 1220 hours while eating lunch at the Site-\u2588\u2588 cafeteria, SCP-4504 was overheard by security staff discussing the layout of Site-\u2588\u2588 with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Security staff immediately removed SCP-4504 from the cafeteria and returned it to its cell. Senior Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 recommends the immediate revocation of SCP-4504\u2019s socialisation privileges.\n\n\nResponse:\n As of 09/08/2012 Site Director Sandoval rescinds SCP-4504\u2019s socialisation privileges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Breach Report 79/P\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 10/08/2012\n\n\nIncident:\n At 1350 hours SCP-4504 breached containment. While it was being transported by two site security officers to its fortnightly psychiatric session with Dr Weber, SCP-4504 covertly used its anomalous ability on itself, stretching out the ring finger on its right hand within the Midas-class water cuffs it was wearing. Once its finger was approximately 45cm in length, it used this finger to breach the Midas cuffs with its anomaly and slashed both security officers with it, killing them.\n\n\nSCP-4504 then extended its ring finger to over 1.3 metres in length and proceeded to the nearby humanoid containment cells. It maimed and killed the security officers it found there and freed the contained SCP objects, initiating a site-wide containment breach.\n\n\nAlthough most of the freed SCP objects were re-captured, SCP-4504 succeeded in escaping the site along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Epsilon 10 (\u201cManhunters\u201d) have been assigned to pursue the escaped anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nKeter\n\n\nDocument revised as of 05/12/2017.

At the time of the interview, it had been three years since SCP-4504 was returned to containment after its most recent successful containment breach. Two site security officers were also present.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 14:30>\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Please! I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Now Dennis, you\u2019re exaggerating. We talked about \u201cawfulizing\u201d thought patterns. You have to be mindful of your mental illness-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n It\u2019s not a fucking mental illness!\n\n\nSCP-4504 struck the table between Dr Weber and itself with its fists. The attending security officers intervened, warning SCP-4504 that if didn\u2019t calm down it would be returned to its containment cell.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Sorry, sorry. But it\u2019s not a fucking illness! I don\u2019t have depression! The reason I\u2019m fucked up is I haven\u2019t talked to another human being in three. Years. Three years!-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Now, Dennis-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No! Listen! For once, just listen! Huhhh. \nSCP-4504 pauses for four seconds.\n I spend all day everyday locked in a tiny little concrete room. The only times I even see other people are when the guards bring me my food, and they aren\u2019t exactly conversationalists. I can\u2019t remember the last time I got to talk to someone who listens. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw the sky. Because I\u2019ve been standing on concrete constantly for the last\u2026 God I can\u2019t even remember how long its been since you first locked me up. Because I\u2019ve been standing on concrete 24/7 since then my feet are in constant agony. Animals at the zoo get treated better than me! They get whole enclosures to roam around in, full of soft grass and beautiful plants under the open sky-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Dennis you\u2019re being irrational. You have plants in your room, as well as the rest of your leisure privileges-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Three potted plants and an Xbox don\u2019t make up for a total lack of human contact!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Dennis, remain calm, or you will be returned to your cell. \nDr Weber pauses for five seconds.\n Good. Now let\u2019s see what we can do to help you. If you\u2019re suffering from chronic foot pain, we can discuss options to help with that. We can provide you with softer slippers and carpeted mats for your containment cell-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Can I go back to my cell? I\u2019d like to go back to my cell.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Dennis, we still have twenty minutes remaining. Please don\u2019t interrupt me, it\u2019s very rude-\n\n\nSCP-4504 rises from its chair and overturns the table between it and Dr Weber. The attending security officers respond, subduing SCP-4504 with pepper spray and tasers. Dr Weber exits the room. Site security officers then escort SCP-4504 back to its containment cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4504 Formal Request 19/09/2015\n\n\nAssisting Staff Member:\n Dr Herman Weber\n\n\nRequest:\n SCP-4504 formally requests thicker, softer-soled slippers and soft carpeted mats for its containment cell. SCP-4504 has stated that it has developed chronic foot pain as a result of standing on Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s concrete floors. It is the opinion of its assigned psychiatrist that granting this request will assist with SCP-4504\u2019s mental health.\n\n\nResponse:\n Request granted. SCP-4504 is to be provided with one large and one small type-2 carpeted matts for its containment cell, as well as one pair of soft slippers. - \nSite Director Sandoval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a085/Q\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a085/Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 85/Q\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 20/09/2015\n\n\nIncident:\n At 1440 hours after being provided with its requested mats and slippers in its cell, SCP-4504 moved to the wall of its containment cell and attempted a containment breach. It made contact with an electrical wire and received a painful shock. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, it contacted the same wire again, receiving another painful electric shock. It then contacted the wire five more times. Security officers entered SCP-4504\u2019s containment cell and moved it away from the wire, subduing it with pepper spray when SCP-4504 struggled against them. SCP-4504 repeatedly vocalised that it wanted to die.\n\n\nResponse:\n SCP-4504 was transported to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary where it received treatment for second-degree electrical burns. Once its initial treatment was complete and its cell had been repaired, it was returned there to prevent a possible containment breach from within the infirmary. Security officers were instructed to respond immediately if SCP-4504 attempted self-harm or a containment breach again. An emergency meeting with its assigned psychiatrist Dr Weber was arranged immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Psychiatric\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Weber\n\n\nForeword:\n An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s emergency interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 20/09/2015.

How are you feeling?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Uh, pretty\u2026 Pretty shit, actually.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Well that\u2019s no good. Have you been taking your medications like I recommended?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n I- No\u2026\n\n\nDr Weber:\n That\u2019s hardly ideal Dennis. You have a serious illness. The SSRIs may or may not help fight it but we won\u2019t know until you try them, and it can take a few weeks before they-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n N-no. It\u2019s not- uh, can we not talk about the meds? There\u2019s- I have another problem.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Another one? Surely not as serious as suicidal ideation I hope.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No, no I\u2019ve been thinking about offing myself for ages now, that was just the first time I was upset enough to try-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Now really, Dennis. You cannot keep things like this to yourself. You must talk to me about them, it\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No, please- huhh, don\u2019t interrupt me. I\u2019m- It\u2019s hard to concentrate.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n What the devil is the matter with you?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n It\u2019s the suicide watch. I can\u2019t- the guards come in every half an hour to check on me. They shout at me when they do and say I gotta answer- like with words, answer them with words, to make sure I\u2019m not- not dying or nothing. But they keep- they come in every half an hour, even when I\u2019m trying to sleep. They keep waking me up, I haven\u2019t got more than half an hour\u2019s sleep for a week. It\u2019s really fucking with my head.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Dennis, but these measures are necessary for your safety. We can\u2019t leave you alone unless we\u2019re sure you aren\u2019t going to try and harm yourself again. Have you considered trying the medications? Once you feel better we\u2019ll be able to take you off suicide watch.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No- it\u2019s- the meds won\u2019t work, it\u2019s not me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me, its this place-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s simply not true, Dennis. You can\u2019t keep using your mental health to try and breach containment. It\u2019s clearly not healthy for you and is only making things worse. I strongly recommend taking your medications and complying with staff directions from now on. You might not understand, but we\u2019re doing this with your best interests at heart.

Dennis, there\u2019s no need for that tone of voice.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Huh, no- wait, I mean-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Making light of the situation with sarcasm and mockery doesn\u2019t help anyone. If you\u2019re still having problems you need to be honest about them. Or else you\u2019ll never get better.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Wait- No, I really mean it. You\u2019ve really helped me, I- I haven\u2019t had a suicidal thought all week, I swear!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry, Dennis, but this is for your own good.

I swear I\u2019m not suicidal anymore! I won\u2019t kill myself, just let me sleep, please!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I\u2019m sorry, Dennis. We have no choice, we cannot allow you to self-harm. I strongly recommend continuing to take your medications and we can review you being on suicide watch again next week.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No! Please, I\u2019m begging you- \nAt this point, SCP-4504 rose from its chair and attempted to move around the table to accost Dr Weber.

It used its anomaly to make contact with one of the wires contained therein and received a painful electric shock. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, it attempted sustained contact with the wire. Security officers entered its cell and intervened, removing SCP-4504 to transport it to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s infirmary so it could receive treatment for electrical burns.\n\n\nWhile in transit to the infirmary, SCP-4504 attacked the security officers escorting it. It seized Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by grabbing her neck and arm. It vocalised to the attending security officers that it was a dangerous SCP and that it was going to use its anomaly on Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 unless they terminated it via gunfire first. Security officers attempted to de-escalate the situation by speaking with SCP-4504 but it proved unresponsive and repeated to security officers that it would maim its hostage unless it was terminated. While it was repeating these threats, Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was able to surprise it by ambushing it through a doorway with his taser. Security officers then proceeded to subdue SCP-4504 with tasers, pepper spray and physical force. As this occurred, the SCP repeatedly vocalised that the security officers needed to terminate it.\n\n\nSCP-4504 was subsequently escorted to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s infirmary where it was treated for second degree electrical burns, three broken ribs, and a concussion. As it was being treated, its cell was repaired and it was returned to it afterwards. The security officers involved reported negligible injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\n Alternate methods of containing SCP-4504 are to be explored.

You\u2019re unresponsive. Combined with the two attempts you made during the week, well, I\u2019m not sure if your mental state is alright. My concern is that you may be malingering, uh, lying, in order to be taken off suicide watch.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n I\u2019m not mal- lying. I don\u2019t- I\u2019m being honest. I don\u2019t feel like dying anymore. Been taking the meds. I\u2019m good now.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Is that so?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Yes. Took them everyday. Like you asked. Feel better now.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Really? So the guards must have been mistaken when they said they saw you hiding the pills in your pillow on your cell\u2019s security camera.\n\n\nSilence for four seconds.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n What?\n\n\nDr Weber:\n You\u2019re on suicide watch, Dennis. You\u2019re being constantly monitored. Did you really think you could get away with this?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Wait. I didn\u2019t- You can\u2019t-\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Dennis, you\u2019re ill. I know you don\u2019t like this but it\u2019s for your own good.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Wait. Wait. You- The watch isn\u2019t helping. You can\u2019t leave me on it.\n\n\nDr Weber:\n You need to take your medications Dennis. They\u2019re going to help you.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Have been taking medications! Am all better now! Suicide watch not helping! Makes me want to die worse!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n Calm down, Dennis. I know you want to be taken off it but I am not going to risk that this isn\u2019t part of some plan to get you a better opportunity to take your own life. I\u2019m going to recommend you remain on suicide watch until two weeks after you start consistently taking your medications.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No! Please! It\u2019s not helping! The drugs aren\u2019t going to help!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n I know you don\u2019t understand, Dennis. But I\u2019m doing this because I care about you.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n No you don\u2019t! You don\u2019t listen! You just make things worse! You hate me!\n\n\nDr Weber:\n You\u2019re being irrational, Dennis. I\u2019m going to end the session now. We have nothing further to discuss.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Fucker!\n\n\nAt this point, SCP-4504 utilised its anomaly, pushing one of its hands through the table ahead of it while rising from its chair. Before security officers could react, SCP-4504 stepped through the table and pushed its other hand into Dr Weber\u2019s head, then removing it in a slashing motion. Most of Dr Weber\u2019s face and cranium was removed.\n\n\nSecurity officers moved to subdue SCP-4504 with tasers and pepper spray while it stood over Dr Weber\u2019s corpse, swearing. In the ensuing struggle, SCP-4504 managed to make contact with Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 using its anomaly, maiming his right hand and forearm and left leg. Despite this, security officers successfully subdued SCP-4504 and transported it back to its cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a090/T\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a090/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 90/T\n\n\nDate:\n 18/10/2015\n\n\nIncident:\n After being returned to its containment cell prematurely as a result of its assault on its psychiatrist, SCP-4504 removed the mattress and sheets from its bunk and moved them into a position leaning against the wall besides the door into its cell. It sat down on the bottom of the mattress with its head resting on a pillow placed against the upright portion of the mattress. From this position it proceeded to strike at any security personnel attempting to enter into its room. Three attempts by security personnel to force entry ended in security officers being maimed by SCP-4504, once while attempting to enter while SCP-4504 was asleep. Security personnel concluded the risk of forcing their way into the cell was too great and resolved to wait until it moved away from its cell door the following morning. Given the risks involved in entering its cell, SCP-4504 was taken off suicide watch but was still observed via the cameras in its cell. SCP-4504 slept in this position for the next two weeks, striking any personnel who entered its cell between the hours of 9pm and 6am.\n\n\nThe five security personnel injured by SCP-4504 were transported to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary. After painkillers and somnic medication proved ineffective in treatment, Site-\u2588\u2588 medical personnel amputated the areas where SCP-4504 had distorted the bodies of Security Officers \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

It proceeded to rampage through the facility for the subsequent three hours, freeing two dozen other humanoid SCP objects. Among those that breached containment were SCP-4504 and SCP-082.\n\n\nAfter being released, SCP-4504 moved through the facility, navigating directly to SCP-082\u2019s containment cell. Once there, security cameras observed the two SCP objects conversing for several minutes, though the camera\u2019s audio was unfortunately unavailable. During the conversation, SCP-4504 kept its distance from SCP-082 but bowed low to it twice. SCP-082 was also observed to laugh and smile several times during their conversation.\n\n\nTheir encounter was interrupted at 1050 by site security. When it observed security officers approaching, SCP-4504 approached SCP-082 and offered up its hands. Before security officers could intervene, SCP-082 bit cleanly through SCP-4504\u2019s wrists, severing both hands.\n\n\nSCP-082 was subdued by site security. SCP-4504 was swiftly relocated to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary in critical condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a028/07/2016\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a028/07/2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4504 Formal Request 28/07/2016\n\n\nAssisting Staff Member:\n Nurse Kokoro Park\n\n\nRequest:\n SCP-4504 formally requests that it be reclassified from \u201cEuclid\u201d to \u201cNeutralised\u201d and released from Foundation containment. SCP-4504 has reported that since the loss of it's hands during Containment Breach U/9 it has been unable to utilise its anomaly in any form. SCP-4504 has stated it understands that any such release would require an amnestic treatment to remove its memories of its time in containment, and consents to such a procedure. It states that it does not expect an explanation or backstory for its disappearance or the loss of its hands and will be content with a simple return to its family.\n\n\nResponse:\n Request granted. SCP-4504 is to be held in containment for three months in order to ensure its injuries are stable and that it is truly no longer anomalous. If these conditions are met, it is to undergo a class Sigma amnestic treatment on 05/11/2016 and subsequently be released in Brisbane, Australia. SCP-4504 is to be dressed in the same manner it was when it was acquired by the Foundation and released three streets away from its family\u2019s residence at [DATA REDACTED]. - \nSite Director Sandoval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a098/U\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a098/U\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 98/U\n\n\nDate:\n 03/08/2016\n\n\nIncident:\n While treating SCP-4504 in the infirmary at 0845, Nurse Park observed a small spatial distortion in the mattress of SCP-4504\u2019s bed near its left hip. SCP-4504 quickly moved to cover the distortion with its bedsheets and denied the existence of the distortion. When Nurse Park asked it to remove the bedsheets so she could check that there was no distortion, SCP-4504 initially refused, but relented when she informed it she would have to call Site-\u2588\u2588 Security if it did not. SCP-4504 moved the blankets but attempted to conceal the anomaly by manipulating the bed\u2019s fitted sheet. Nurse Park observed the anomaly and contacted Site Security, which caused SCP-4504 to become distressed and repeatedly state that it was no longer anomalous.\n\n\nResponse:\n At 0850 Security Officers arrived at the infirmary. Security officers attempted to move SCP-4504 back to its containment cell, but it resisted, continuing to insist that it was no longer anomalous. Site security subdued SCP-4504 with pepper spray and tasers and moved it back to its containment cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Containment\u00a0Breach\u00a0Report\u00a0V/2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Containment\u00a0Breach\u00a0Report\u00a0V/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Breach Report V/2\n\n\nDate:\n 03/08/2016\n\n\nIncident:\n At 0930 SCP-4504 moved to the wall of its containment cell. It placed the end of its right arm, where its hand formerly was, against the wall and used its anomaly while drawing back its arm. By doing so it was able to remove a section of the wall the approximate size and shape of its former hand. The wires contained inside the wall did not impede this motion, as they were not contacting SCP-4504 directly.\n\n\nAfter a four second pause, SCP-4504 then repeated this motion two dozen times more within 30 seconds, tearing a hole in its cell wall and breaching containment. It exited its cell and began breaching any other containments it found, using this new application of its anomaly to dismember and decapitate any security staff it encountered.\n\n\nTen minutes later, SCP-4504 escaped Site-\u2588\u2588 along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-10 (\u201cManhunters\u201d) responded and engaged in pursuing the fleeing SCP objects. SCP-4504 was re-acquired by Foundation personnel a week later after following reports of \"a homeless man with no hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0116/W\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0116/W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 116/W\n\n\nDate:\n 27/11/2017\n\n\nIncident:\n At 2300 hours, after having lain in its bed for approximately thirteen hours, SCP-4504 arose and removed its clothes. It then proceeded to use its anomaly on itself by placing the ends of its arms against itself and stretching its limbs and torso. Security attempted to intervene by threatening to activate the cell\u2019s Halothane dispersal system, but SCP-4504 stated that after it woke up again it would resume its anomalous activity. Unsure if this was a genuine attempt to self-harm or a new manifestation of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly, security officers remained outside SCP-4504\u2019s containment cell and called for its assigned psychiatrist.\n\n\nDuring SCP-4504\u2019s self-mutilation, it frequently expressed severe distress and pain. It began by elongating its limbs before moving onto its own torso, neck and head. The process was crude, especially on its torso which required almost 30 minutes to elongate as its hands were not large enough to easily manipulate it.\n\n\nSCP-4504\u2019s on-site psychiatrist, Dr Strickland, arrived part-way through the process. He attempted to negotiate with SCP-4504, asking it why it was self-mutilating and reminding it that poor behaviour would result in the revocation of its leisure privileges again. SCP-4504 responded with laughter, pointing out it still had not regained leisure privileges after a previous attempt to breach containment.\n\n\nDr Strickland then stated that if it continued to self-harm it may be placed on suicide watch again. SCP-4504 responded with aggression and threats, stating it would kill Dr Strickland and that it knew the Foundation had been hiding antidepressants in its food. Dr Strickland again pleaded with SCP-4504 to stop mutilating itself, stating that he and the other Foundation personnel cared about its wellbeing, to which SCP-4504 again responded with laughter. Dr Strickland asked SCP-4504 why it was self-mutilating and what it thought it would accomplish, to which SCP-4504 responded \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\nDr Strickland continued to try and talk SCP-4504 down until it completed the process. It then breached containment, using the increased reach of its arms to disable the Halothane dispersal system inside its cell before breaking out. Its distorted body shrugged off attempts to subdue it, allowing it to kill Dr Strickland and several security officers. SCP-4504 then proceeded to rampage through the facility, maiming 12 security officers and killing 29 others. It was eventually subdued using flashbangs, stun grenades and Halothane grenades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a04504/15-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a04504/15-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4504/15-3\n\n\nResearch Team:\n Senior Researcher Muhammed Al-Harthi, Junior Researcher Albert Vargas\n\n\nParticipant:\n SCP-4504\n\n\nSubject:\n D-72894, a 177cm tall Indigenous Australian male\n\n\nPurpose:\n To determine the size and shape of SCP-4504\u2019s energy fields, which had been observed during its most recent containment breach to be larger than its hands were previously.\n\n\nPreparation:\n D-72894 restrained in chair using leather straps. Researchers Al-Harthi and Vargas were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nExperiment:\n \nSCP-4504 enters testing chamber. D-72894 begins vocalising distress and expletives, telling SCP-4504 to stay away from him. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach D-72894 and use its anomaly on him.\n\n\nSCP-4504 approaches D-72894. D-72894 continues to vocalise distress and expletives, asking SCP-4504 to stay away and not to harm him while struggling to escape from his restraints. When SCP-4504 reaches D-72894 it bends down, shushing him. It places the end of its forearm on top of D-72894\u2019s head and reassures him that it will not harm him.\n\n\nSCP-4504 then straightens, steps towards the room\u2019s reinforced observation window and asks the research team if they \u201cwant to see what [he] can do?\u201d. SCP-4504 then rushes the window and breaches containment while laughing. It proceeds to kill the research team and the attending security officers with before escaping into Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n[END TEST LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Security footage and post-mortem examination of the research teams from resulting containment breach confirms SCP-4504\u2019s \u2018hands\u2019 are enlarged to be proportionate to its new body, with its \u201cpalms\u201d being approximately 20cm in diameter and each \u201cfinger\u201d being between 45 and 60 centimetres in length. It is unknown if this is the result of SCP-4504 using its energy fields to manipulate each other or if they have grown in proportion to the rest of it. In light of this new information, SCP-4504\u2019s containment procedures should be updated as soon as possible.\n\n\nAll future testing with SCP-4504 has been prohibited by order of Site Director Sandoval.

You\u2019re one of them, tryna grind me down so I\u2019ll be a good skip and sit quietly in my little concrete box without bothering anyone. You don't care about my mental health, you only care about keeping me contained. Let me ask you something. You read my file, yeah?\n\n\nDr White:\n Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n So you know what I did to my three other psychiatrists?\n\n\nDr White:\n Yes. I certainly hope our relationship goes better.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Well, that depends on you. You gonna put me on suicide watch?\n\n\nDr White:\n According to what I read in your file, suicide watch was largely ineffective, was mainly used to punish you for non-compliance and was the precipitating factor in a number of your violent episodes. So no, I don\u2019t think I will be recommending it.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n You gonna try and hide drugs in my food?\n\n\nDr White:\n No.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n You gonna take away my leisure privileges if I talk back?\n\n\nDr White:\n No.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n If I tell you something\u2019s wrong, are you gonna listen or are you gonna argue and say its really my fault?\n\n\nDr White:\n Wha- No!

You might be the best shrink I\u2019ve ever had.\n\n\nDr White:\n I don\u2019t want to jinx myself, but if your other psychiatrists did that then yes, I might be. Is there anything else you wanted to ask me before I get started?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Can you draw me a map from here to Site Director Sandoval\u2019s office with all the security patrol routes marked on it?\n\n\nDr White:\n No.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Aaaahh, dangit. My cunning plan was foiled. I was so close, but you witty Foundation types managed to outfox me again. My search for Site Director Sandoval\u2019s office continues.\n\n\nDr White:\n Yes, well. Going back to the subject of your file, I noticed there were a few important pieces of information missing from it.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Please don\u2019t say \u201cwe don\u2019t know exactly how big your imaginary hands are\u201d. Cuz let me tell you now, that ended \nbadly\n for the last guys.\n\n\nDr White:\n No. It's about your\u2026 transformation.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Oh?\n\n\nDr White:\n I looked through your file, but you\u2019ve never really explained why you chose to mutilate yourself like that. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how painful a small area of your distortions must feel, and you chose to do that to your whole body. Why?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n What do you mean, why? I\u2019m bulletproof. Regular guns don\u2019t hurt me. Tasers bounce off me. It hurts so much I can\u2019t even feel it if I get pepper sprayed. I\u2019m stronger than any normal man and my long legs and arms mean I can run faster and reach further than I ever could back when I was normal. Well, sorta normal.\n\n\nDr White:\n But despite all that, you\u2019ve never used them to escape. You did this to yourself, but your file says during containment breaches you\u2019re more interested in hurting security staff than you are in actually escaping.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Well, where would I go? I\u2019m nine feet of freak. I could never hide like this. If I walked into any town with people in it they\u2019d scream and run away. There\u2019d be an MTF on me so fast they\u2019d break the land speed record.\n\n\nDr White:\n But then why do it? Was giving up your chance at getting away really worth getting back at security officers?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Oh, fuck off.\n\n\nDr White:\n I\u2019m sorry? Have I said something that upsets you? I didn\u2019t mean to-\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n You said you read my file, yeah? You see how many of those escapes were working for me before I did this to myself?\n\n\nDr White:\n They weren\u2019t as successful, yes. It\u2019s why I thought you did it. To make your breaching containment more likely.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Wrong. I kept hoping I\u2019d get away again. First time I got out, I was outside for seven months. Seven whole months, where I could walk down a street with normal people, stand under the sky, go into shops. I got to eat whatever I wanted, drive cars, look at fuckin\u2019 trees. Then I got caught and brought back here. The next time I only managed to stay away for eight weeks. Then one. Now I\u2019m lucky if I get a few hours outside of containment. By the end there I wasn\u2019t even making it all the way off Site-\u2588\u2588 before I got caught and dragged back. I realised I was never going to escape. I looked around that little concrete box and I realised I was never going anywhere else. I was gonna die in Site-\u2588\u2588, probably in that cell.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n You guys took everything from me. \nEverything.\n I even gave up my hands, watched \u2018em get ripped off me by an ogre, and that didn\u2019t even get me outside. The prosthetics you give me are crap, so I have to eat food like a dog. I was hurting so much. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I talked to someone who wasn\u2019t staff. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d seen the sky. You guys took that from me.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n But you know something? You know what you can\u2019t take from me? No matter how hard you try? You know the one thing I\u2019ll always be able to enjoy?\n\n\nPause for three seconds.\n\n\nDr White:\n Vengeance?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Fuckin\u2019 vengeance. Lashing out at people who\u2019ve hurt you so they hurt is something so basic, so fundamental, that even dogs understand it. I had nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, you keep me isolated from people, keep me trapped in my cell. I already deal with that shit, so why not? I\u2019m already hurting so bad, it's not like it could make my pain worse. So why not?\n\n\nDr White:\n I see. Why not make yourself into a monster, if you already get treated like one?\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Exactly! Fuckin'- exactly. This way I can kill way more security, which is the only thing I get to enjoy anymore.\n\n\nDr White:\n What about leisure privileges? Your file mentioned you were something of an artist.\n\n\nSCP-4504 snorts.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n Like that helps. Watching a TV in a dingy little room? Watching a shitty little pot-plant slowly wither and die? And how\u2019m I supposed to paint something good when I only ever see the inside of this place? Plus most of it is really fucking awkward to use when you\u2019ve got no hands.\n\n\nDr White:\n Well, we can start with that. I\u2019m going to recommend a review of your leisure privileges to make them more accessible and enjoyable for you. I\u2019m also going to recommend you be awarded socialisation privileges again, and that you be escorted around the outside perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 once a week.\n\n\nFour seconds of silence.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n \nWhat?\n\n\nDr White:\n That was something you asked for, years ago when you first joined us, wasn\u2019t it? Being escorted around the facility once a week so you could see the outside world? And you said it yourself. A lot of your violence occurs as a result of your feelings of powerlessness and emotional distress, which are in turn caused by your social and physical isolation. I haven\u2019t known you long, but it seems like letting you have these small privileges would vastly decrease both your distress and your violent tendencies. Of course these privileges would be contingent on your good behaviour, but you would understand that by now. I also can\u2019t guarantee Site Director Sandoval will allow any of this, but I certainly intend to argue for it. Uh- with your permission of course.\n\n\nFour seconds of silence.\n\n\nSCP-4504:\n \nJesus Christ,\n Angela! Fuck yes, I want this! Where have you been all this time? Shit, I\u2019d kiss you but I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019d start shit with the guards.\n\n\nDr White:\n Yes, probably. Now I had a few other things I thought you might like to talk about, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a018/09/2019\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-4504\u00a0Formal\u00a0Request\u00a018/09/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4504 Formal Request 18/09/2019\n\n\nAssisting Staff Member:\n Dr Angela White\n\n\nRequest:\n SCP-4504 formally requests the return of socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 also requests a review of its leisure privileges so they can be personalised so they are made more appropriate and more accessible for it, as well as the opportunity to be escorted around the perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 once a week.\n\n\nResponse:\n SCP-4504\u2019s leisure privileges will be reviewed. The rest of this request is denied. Too much chance of a flight risk with this one. \u2013 \nSite Director Sandoval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Site-\u2588\u2588\u00a0Email\u00a0Server\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Site-\u2588\u2588\u00a0Email\u00a0Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail, Dated 19/09/2018\n\n\nto:\n J.Sandoval@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nfrom:\n A.White@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-4504 Formal Request\n\n\nBody:\n Greetings Site Director.\n\n\nI know you have already responded to SCP-4504\u2019s request, but I would ask that you review your decision. As indicated in the attached documents and my interview with it yesterday, SCP-4504 is far less of a flight risk than it once was. Further, almost all of its violence is precipitated by feelings of isolation, powerlessness and distress. Alleviating these would undoubtedly reduce its violent outbursts.\n\n\nI would also draw your attention to its history regarding its medication. Never once has it attempted to breach containment or harm staff while its medication was being delivered. Why? Because it understands that if it was to do this, it would lose access to the painkillers it needs. SCP-4504 has repeatedly stated that it needs to socialise with non-staff and it needs time outside. I believe if you fulfill these requests, SCP-4504 will regard them the same way as its medication and will behave.\n\n\nIt\u2019s for these reasons I\u2019m asking you to review your decision regarding SCP-4504\u2019s formal request.\n\n\nAngela\n\n\nEmail, Dated 19/09/2018\n\n\nto:\n A.White@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nfrom:\n J.Sandoval@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: SCP-4504 Formal Request\n\n\nBody:\n Fine.

They were met by Staff Psychiatrist Dr Angela White.\n\n\nBefore commencing the excursion, Dr White asked SCP-4504 how it was feeling. SCP-4504 stated it felt anxious, and that it believed the excursion was more likely to be part of a complex decommissioning procedure than it was to be genuine excursion.\n\n\nSecurity Sergeant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 informed SCP-4504 that it was genuine, but he would turn it into a decommissioning procedure if SCP-4504 attempted to escape Foundation custody. SCP-4504 attempted to respond with aggression, but Dr Angela White interrupted and was able to redirect both parties by beginning the excursion.\n\n\nSCP-4504 and Dr White were escorted twice around the perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 over the course of an hour, as planned.

        "Excerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504 Interviewed: SCP-4504 Interviewer: Doctor Weber Foreword: An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s fortnightly interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 04/07/2008. SCP-4504 was reporting good mental health and often used these interviews to make formal requests regarding its containment. Two site security officers were also present. <Begin Log, 14:40> Dr Weber: I\u2019m glad the plants are helping you, Dennis. We\u2019re almost out of time, but when we were starting you mentioned you had another request. SCP-4504: Uh, yeah. Look, I\u2019m really grateful to you guys for keeping me safe like this. You explained to me about the dangers for people like me out there, with guys like the GOC or the, uh\u2026 Marshall\u2026 guys? Dr Weber: Marshall, Carter & Dark? SCP-4504: Yeah, the rich fucks. I get it. The P in SCP stands for protecting me as much as protecting the world from dangerous people like me. I get it. Dr Weber: Dennis, we cannot give permission for you to leave Site-\u2588\u2588. SCP-4504: Aw, come on! Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s simply not possible. SCP-4504: Look, you said no to contact with family. Fine. You need to protect the Matrix, or normality, or whatever. Sure. But you can\u2019t keep me locked up like this. I need to get out, to be outside. Dr Weber: If you would like to request more time outside in the exercise area I\u2019m sure we can- SCP-4504: No I don\u2019t want time in the exercise area! SCP-4504 leans forward out of its seat aggressively. Security staff instruct SCP-4504 to return to its seat and calm down. SCP-4504: Okay, okay. Look, I just- huh, I- the yard fucking sucks, okay? I go outside to stand on some fucking astroturf and run around in circles for an hour or two. I\u2019m still surrounded by four concrete walls. I\u2019m still standing on concrete no matter how much fake plastic shit you layer on top of it. And I\u2019m still being stared at by the same fucking prison guards with guns. SCP-4504 gestures to the attending security officers. It\u2019s depressing! I want to go somewhere where I can see the horizon. I wanna feel real grass under my feet. I wanna see an actual fucking tree, not just a potted plant in my room. Even- even if security just walks me around the outside of the facility walls, or something. Anything! I\u2019m not a criminal, you shouldn\u2019t treat me like this! Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry Dennis, but we simply cannot take that risk. If you would like, we can discuss alternatives, like painting a horizon mural on the inside of the wall- SCP-4504: Fuck! No! I don\u2019t- look, it\u2019ll be fine. I promise. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. It only has to be for an hour or two, I\u2019ll do exactly what the guards say- Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry, Dennis. But its simply not possible. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss? SCP-4504: Huh\u2026 No. Dr Weber: Then we\u2019re finished for the day. I\u2019ll see you again next week. <End Log, 14:50> Closing Statement: SCP-4504 was escorted back to its containment cell immediately afterwards. Shortly thereafter, it used its art supplies to deface the wall of its containment cell with the words \u201cYOU'RE HERE FOREVER\u201d. SCP-4504 was subsequently ordered to remove the vandalism by security staff. Per the advice of staff psychiatrist Dr Weber, the Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s exercise area was closed for three days while staff painted a mural resembling the horizon on two walls.",
        "Test Log 4504/8-1 Research Team: Senior Researcher Dr Hugh Gosse, Junior Researcher Dr Muhammed Al-Harthi Participant: SCP-4504 Subject: One adult male Sus Domesticus Purpose: To determine the effects of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly on a living creature. Preparation: The Sus Domesticus was restrained on a table with leather straps. Researchers Gosse and Al-Harthi were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window. [BEGIN LOG] Experiment: SCP-4504 is introduced to the testing chamber and is instructed to approach the subject, place its hand on it and use its anomaly. SCP-4504 hesitates. Research team prompts SCP-4504 to approach the subject. SCP-4504 expresses reluctance and is reminded that if it does not comply it will be reprimanded. SCP-4504 complies, placing its hand on the creature\u2019s thigh and pushing into it. The subject immediately begins screaming and thrashing against its restraints. SCP-4504 retreats to the far corner of the room. The subject continues to scream, struggling hard enough to shake the table. SCP-4504 requests permission to leave the testing chamber, although this is not heard by the research team due to the subject\u2019s volume. After twelve seconds, SCP-4504 repeats its request, loud enough to be heard. Research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach the table again and touch the subject, this time pushing its hand into its brain. SCP-4504 expresses distress and asks permission to leave the testing chamber. Research team reminds SCP-4504 that if it does not comply with instructions it will be reprimanded. SCP-4504 re-approaches the table and moves to place its hand on the subject\u2019s head. The creature twists its head around and bites SCP-4504 on the palm. SCP-4504 vocalises distress and retreats from the subject, holding its bleeding hand. Testing cancelled and SCP-4504 given permission to leave the testing chamber. [END LOG] Closing Statement: SCP-4504 was escorted to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary by security staff. En route to the infirmary, SCP-4504 reported feeling faint and lost consciousness. This was likely a result of security staff following containment procedures and placing SCP-4504 in Midas water cuffs, preventing SCP-4504 from putting pressure on its wound. Research team reprimanded for improperly restraining the test subject.",
        "Containment Breach Report 42/H Date: 28/11/2010 Incident: At approximately 1230 hours, SCPs-4504 breached containment during a socialisation meeting at the Site-\u2588\u2588 cafeteria, along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Over the next 20 minutes, SCP-4504 was able to breach walls and floors using its anomaly, freeing thirteen other humanoid SCP objects. Although almost all were recontained, SCP-4504 and four other humanoid SCP objects breached containment and escaped from Site-\u2588\u2588. During the containment breach, SCP-4504 refused to use its anomaly on security staff even in situations where it would have directly benefited from it. It also attempted to discourage other humanoid SCP objects from harming staff, although this was ineffective in the case of SCPs-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and -\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, resulting in 16 casualties among site staff. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-10 (\u201cManhunters\u201d) have been assigned to pursue the escaped anomalies.",
        "Incident Report 45/I Date: 13/6/2011 Incident: Immediately after being returned to containment in its cell at 1700 hours, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by breaking through a wall, despite having been informed of the new containment measures in place. SCP-4504 contacted one of the electric wires and received a painful shock. Security staff entered SCP-4504\u2019s cell and subdued it using pepper spray. Staff sustained no injuries. Incident Report 46/J Date: 14/06/2011 Incident: At 0540 hours, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by breaking through one of its cell walls. SCP-4504 contacted one of the electric wires and received a painful shock. Security staff entered SCP-4504\u2019s cell and subdued it using pepper spray. Staff sustained no injuries. Security staff instructed by Site Director Sandoval to only respond to attempted containment breaches by SCP-4504 if it manages to leave its cell. Incident Report 48/K Date: 15/06/2011 to 20/06/2011 Incident: Over the course of the five days indicated, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment of its cell nine times. Each time it failed, contacting one of the electric wires and receiving a painful shock. After the third, fifth, sixth and ninth attempted breaches SCP-4504 received treatment from medical staff for second-degree electrical burns. Incident Report 50/L Date: 21/06/2011 Incident: While in-transit to its first session with staff psychiatrist Dr Weber since re-entering containment, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by assaulting its security officers and fleeing from them while restrained with Midas-class water cuffs. Security officers swiftly subdued SCP-4504 using pepper spray and physical force. At their discretion, security officers returned SCP-4504 to its cell, postponing its session with Dr Weber for another fortnight in order to discourage future attempts to breach containment. Site medical staff treated SCP-4504 in its cell for a concussion and two fractured ribs. Security staff reported negligible injuries. Incident Report 54/M Date: 05/07/2011 Incident: While attending a session with Dr Weber at 1420 hours, SCP-4504 became emotionally unstable and aggressive. Security staff subdued SCP-4504 using pepper spray and physical force before returning SCP-4504 to its cell. Medical staff treated SCP-4504 in its cell for a broken nose and dislocated shoulder. Security staff reported negligible injuries.",
        "SCP-4504 Formal Request 19/07/2011 Assisting Staff Member: Dr Herman Weber Request: SCP-4504 formally requests the holes in its cell caused by its breach attempts be repaired. SCP-4504 states that they often spark loudly causing him anxiety and difficulty falling asleep, and that they are unsafe to move around due to the electrical hazard. Response: Request denied. We do not have another cell prepared to house SCP-4504 while repairs are made. The chance is too great that this is another attempt to breach containment, and those holes only exist because SCP-4504 attempted such in the first place. We reap what we sow. - Site Director Sandoval SCP-4504 Formal Request 19/07/2011 Assisting Staff Member: Dr Herman Weber Request: SCP-4504 formally requests the re-instatement of its socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 states that the removal of these privileges for so long has caused it significant distress and that the return of its ability to converse with non-staff persons would be greatly beneficial to its mental health. Response: Request denied. SCP-4504 has breached containment with the assistance of other humanoid SCP objects in the past. Allowing it this contact would inevitably lead to another attempted containment breach. SCP-4504 will have to content itself with conversations with security staff and its assigned psychiatrist. - Site Director Sandoval",
        "SCP-4504 Psychiatric Report 13/09/2011 Assigned Psychiatrist: Dr Herman Weber Report: SCP-4504 presents with the following symptoms: depressed mood, irritability, psychomotor impairment, chronic fatigue, chronic insomnia, decreased interest in leisure activities and significant weight loss. As such I am formally diagnosing SCP-4504 with Major Depressive Disorder. I am prescribing SCP-4504 a daily regimen of SSRIs to help combat this. SCP-4504 Psychiatric Report 25/10/2011 Assigned Psychiatrist: Dr Herman Weber Report: SCP-4504 is refusing to take its prescribed antidepressants for the sixth week in a row. Attempts by site staff to compel its taking of them by mashing them into its food have failed \u2013 SCP-4504 refuses to eat food that could hide the medication. SCP-4504 continues to insist that restoration of his socialisation privileges would be more beneficial for its mental health than antidepressants. My attempts to convince it otherwise have fallen on deaf ears.",
        "Test Log 4504/15-3 Research Team: Senior Researcher Dr Hugh Gosse, Junior Researcher Dr Muhammed Al-Harthi Particpant: SCP-4504 Subject: D-66549, a 181cm tall British-Australian male Purpose: To determine the effects of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly on a human being. Preparation: D-66549 restrained in chair using leather straps. Researchers Gosse and Al-Harthi were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window. SCP-4504\u2019s compliance for the test was acquired by offering the return of its socialisation privileges provided it follow the research team\u2019s instructions. [BEGIN LOG] Experiment: SCP-4504 enters the testing chamber. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach D-66549 and use its anomaly on his hand. SCP-4504 hesitates. The research team reminds SCP-4504 that if it does not cooperate during the test its socialisation privileges will not be restored. D-66549 vocalises distress and asks SCP-4504 to not cooperate. SCP-4504 hesitates again. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549 and approaches him. SCP-4504 pushes the index and middle fingers on its right hand into the back of D-66549\u2019s hand. Immediately, D-66549 begins struggling against his restraints, screaming and vocalising expletives. The research team asks D-66549 how he feels and if he is in pain. D-66549 vocalises more expletives and confirms that he is in extreme pain. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549 again, eliciting more expletives. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to push its fingers into D-66549\u2019s forehead. SCP-4504 hesitates and requests that the experiment be discontinued, stating the research team should have enough data. D-66549 agrees. The research team disagrees, reminding SCP-4504 that its socialisation privileges will not be restored if it does not comply and again instructing it to push its fingers into D-66549\u2019s forehead. SCP-4504 apologises to D-66549. SCP-4504 pushes the index and middle fingers on its right hand into D-66549\u2019s forehead. D-66549 resumes screaming at volume. D-66549 does not cease this behaviour when SCP-4504 removes its fingers from his forehead, nor when the research team asks him to describe the sensation. SCP-4504 asks to be able to leave the testing chamber and return to its cell. The research team permits it to do so. [END TEST LOG] Closing Statement: Site medical staff entered the testing chamber and moved D-66549 to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary. D-66549 was observed for the next 72 hours. D-66549 reported extreme chronic pain where SCP-4504 had touched it for the entire duration. He reported that the pain did not dull with time and remained as painful as when it had first been subjected to the effect. D-66549 reported that his thought process and cognitive capacity were unimpeded. However, D-66549 was observed to suffer from insomnia, which he reported was due to his chronic pain. Even with the assistance of pain and somnic medications D-66549 was unable to sleep. After 72 hours, D-66549 requested euthanization. The research team agreed and ended the experiment.",
        "Excerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504 Interviewed: SCP-4504 Interviewer: Doctor Weber Foreword: An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s fortnightly interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 14/02/2012. Two site security officers were also present. <Begin Log, 14:30> Dr Weber: That\u2019s unfortunate, Dennis. But I was wondering if I could ask you about something? SCP-4504: Huhhh\u2026 sure, why not? Dr Weber: I\u2019ve received reports from the site orderlies that you\u2019ve ceased cutting your hair and nails. SCP-4504: Yeah, you noticed. Dr Weber: Yes. I was wondering why you had decided to do that? Self-care is important, so I\u2019m a little concerned to see you\u2019re no longer maintaining proper hygiene. SCP-4504: Heh, its okay. You can say what you mean. These fucks- SCP-4504 gestures to the attending security officers -are worried I\u2019m growing my nails longer because I\u2019m trying to increase how far I can reach, or something. Dr Weber: Is that what you\u2019re doing? SCP-4504: Nah, it\u2019s because of something else. Pause in conversation for five seconds. Dr Weber: Would you mind telling me what that thing is? SCP-4504: Well, I would, but there\u2019s no point. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s part of what makes you such a shit psychiatrist. Dr Weber: That\u2019s hardly fair, Dennis. SCP-4504: It\u2019s entirely fair. Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall, or tryna herd cats. I explain stuff over and over but you just don\u2019t get it. Dr Weber: I feel like we\u2019re getting off topic. Your fingernails, Dennis? SCP-4504: Hah yeah, heaven forbid we waste time on shit that doesn\u2019t matter. Anyway, uh\u2026 have you ever read the Handmaid\u2019s Tale? Dr Weber: I can\u2019t say that I have. Is this relevant to- SCP-4504: Shit, I was hoping that would explain it. Um. I\u2019m doing it because how long my hair and nails are is one of the few things I have control over anymore. I don\u2019t get to choose where I go, where I sleep, what I do, what I eat- I have no control over any part of my life. But this? I control this. Dr Weber: I understand you feel that way Dennis. But perhaps you should consider allowing the nursing staff to trim them? They are rather unhygienic. It would be what\u2019s best for your health after all. SCP-4504 exhales for three seconds.",
        "Incident Report 60/N Date: 03/06/2012 Incident: At 2230 hours while in its cell SCP-4504 used its anomaly on itself, bending the tip of one of its fingernails. SCP-4504 was careful to avoid the tip of its finger so as to not distort its own flesh. Security staff believe this is the reason why SCP-4504 has been refusing to allow medical staff to cut its hair or nails for the past several months and that the SCP is testing to see if it can use its anomaly on its own body. Senior Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 recommends medical staff cut SCP-4504\u2019s fingernails at the next opportunity. Response: Senior Nurse \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cannot authorise the cutting of SCP-4504\u2019s nails. The nature of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly makes interacting with its hands without its consent unwise at best. If left alone, it is likely that SCP-4504\u2019s nails will break on their own or SCP-4504 will ask staff to assist it cut its nails. Incident Report 78/O Date: 09/08/2012 Incident: At 1220 hours while eating lunch at the Site-\u2588\u2588 cafeteria, SCP-4504 was overheard by security staff discussing the layout of Site-\u2588\u2588 with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Security staff immediately removed SCP-4504 from the cafeteria and returned it to its cell. Senior Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 recommends the immediate revocation of SCP-4504\u2019s socialisation privileges. Response: As of 09/08/2012 Site Director Sandoval rescinds SCP-4504\u2019s socialisation privileges.",
        "Containment Breach Report 79/P Date: 10/08/2012 Incident: At 1350 hours SCP-4504 breached containment. While it was being transported by two site security officers to its fortnightly psychiatric session with Dr Weber, SCP-4504 covertly used its anomalous ability on itself, stretching out the ring finger on its right hand within the Midas-class water cuffs it was wearing. Once its finger was approximately 45cm in length, it used this finger to breach the Midas cuffs with its anomaly and slashed both security officers with it, killing them. SCP-4504 then extended its ring finger to over 1.3 metres in length and proceeded to the nearby humanoid containment cells. It maimed and killed the security officers it found there and freed the contained SCP objects, initiating a site-wide containment breach. Although most of the freed SCP objects were re-captured, SCP-4504 succeeded in escaping the site along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

At the time of the interview, it had been three years since SCP-4504 was returned to containment after its most recent successful containment breach. Two site security officers were also present. <Begin Log, 14:30> SCP-4504: Please! I can\u2019t take it anymore. Dr Weber: Now Dennis, you\u2019re exaggerating. We talked about \u201cawfulizing\u201d thought patterns. You have to be mindful of your mental illness- SCP-4504: It\u2019s not a fucking mental illness! SCP-4504 struck the table between Dr Weber and itself with its fists. The attending security officers intervened, warning SCP-4504 that if didn\u2019t calm down it would be returned to its containment cell. SCP-4504: Sorry, sorry. But it\u2019s not a fucking illness! I don\u2019t have depression! The reason I\u2019m fucked up is I haven\u2019t talked to another human being in three. Years. Three years!- Dr Weber: Now, Dennis- SCP-4504: No! Listen! For once, just listen! Huhhh. SCP-4504 pauses for four seconds. I spend all day everyday locked in a tiny little concrete room. The only times I even see other people are when the guards bring me my food, and they aren\u2019t exactly conversationalists. I can\u2019t remember the last time I got to talk to someone who listens. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw the sky. Because I\u2019ve been standing on concrete constantly for the last\u2026 God I can\u2019t even remember how long its been since you first locked me up. Because I\u2019ve been standing on concrete 24/7 since then my feet are in constant agony. Animals at the zoo get treated better than me! They get whole enclosures to roam around in, full of soft grass and beautiful plants under the open sky- Dr Weber: Dennis you\u2019re being irrational. You have plants in your room, as well as the rest of your leisure privileges- SCP-4504: Three potted plants and an Xbox don\u2019t make up for a total lack of human contact! Dr Weber: Dennis, remain calm, or you will be returned to your cell. Dr Weber pauses for five seconds. Good. Now let\u2019s see what we can do to help you. If you\u2019re suffering from chronic foot pain, we can discuss options to help with that. We can provide you with softer slippers and carpeted mats for your containment cell- SCP-4504: Can I go back to my cell? I\u2019d like to go back to my cell. Dr Weber: Dennis, we still have twenty minutes remaining. Please don\u2019t interrupt me, it\u2019s very rude- SCP-4504 rises from its chair and overturns the table between it and Dr Weber. The attending security officers respond, subduing SCP-4504 with pepper spray and tasers. Dr Weber exits the room. Site security officers then escort SCP-4504 back to its containment cell.",
        "SCP-4504 Formal Request 19/09/2015 Assisting Staff Member: Dr Herman Weber Request: SCP-4504 formally requests thicker, softer-soled slippers and soft carpeted mats for its containment cell. SCP-4504 has stated that it has developed chronic foot pain as a result of standing on Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s concrete floors. It is the opinion of its assigned psychiatrist that granting this request will assist with SCP-4504\u2019s mental health. Response: Request granted. SCP-4504 is to be provided with one large and one small type-2 carpeted matts for its containment cell, as well as one pair of soft slippers. - Site Director Sandoval",
        "Incident Report 85/Q Date: 20/09/2015 Incident: At 1440 hours after being provided with its requested mats and slippers in its cell, SCP-4504 moved to the wall of its containment cell and attempted a containment breach. It made contact with an electrical wire and received a painful shock. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, it contacted the same wire again, receiving another painful electric shock. It then contacted the wire five more times. Security officers entered SCP-4504\u2019s containment cell and moved it away from the wire, subduing it with pepper spray when SCP-4504 struggled against them. SCP-4504 repeatedly vocalised that it wanted to die. Response: SCP-4504 was transported to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary where it received treatment for second-degree electrical burns. Once its initial treatment was complete and its cell had been repaired, it was returned there to prevent a possible containment breach from within the infirmary. Security officers were instructed to respond immediately if SCP-4504 attempted self-harm or a containment breach again. An emergency meeting with its assigned psychiatrist Dr Weber was arranged immediately.",

Dr Weber: I want to help you, But I can\u2019t if you won\u2019t help me. SCP-4504 remains silent. Dr Weber: Dennis, this is very serious. We need to talk about this. SCP-4504: I\u2026 Dr Weber: Yes? SCP-4504: I\u2026 am formally requesting\u2026 the right to die. Dr Weber: Huhh. Alright Dennis. I am formally placing you on suicide watch. Security officers are going to be checking on you every half hour to confirm that you\u2019re okay and that you aren\u2019t preparing for another attempt at suicide. I am also moving up our sessions to be weekly rather than fortnightly while we\u2019re dealing with this. You will be provided with a regimen of SSRIs to help you.

Dr Weber: Well that\u2019s no good. Have you been taking your medications like I recommended? SCP-4504: I- No\u2026 Dr Weber: That\u2019s hardly ideal Dennis. You have a serious illness. The SSRIs may or may not help fight it but we won\u2019t know until you try them, and it can take a few weeks before they- SCP-4504: N-no. It\u2019s not- uh, can we not talk about the meds? There\u2019s- I have another problem. Dr Weber: Another one? Surely not as serious as suicidal ideation I hope. SCP-4504: No, no I\u2019ve been thinking about offing myself for ages now, that was just the first time I was upset enough to try- Dr Weber: Now really, Dennis. You cannot keep things like this to yourself. You must talk to me about them, it\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. SCP-4504: No, please- huhh, don\u2019t interrupt me. I\u2019m- It\u2019s hard to concentrate. Dr Weber: What the devil is the matter with you? SCP-4504: It\u2019s the suicide watch. I can\u2019t- the guards come in every half an hour to check on me. They shout at me when they do and say I gotta answer- like with words, answer them with words, to make sure I\u2019m not- not dying or nothing. But they keep- they come in every half an hour, even when I\u2019m trying to sleep. They keep waking me up, I haven\u2019t got more than half an hour\u2019s sleep for a week. It\u2019s really fucking with my head. Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Dennis, but these measures are necessary for your safety. We can\u2019t leave you alone unless we\u2019re sure you aren\u2019t going to try and harm yourself again. Have you considered trying the medications? Once you feel better we\u2019ll be able to take you off suicide watch. SCP-4504: No- it\u2019s- the meds won\u2019t work, it\u2019s not me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me, its this place- Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s simply not true, Dennis. You can\u2019t keep using your mental health to try and breach containment. It\u2019s clearly not healthy for you and is only making things worse. I strongly recommend taking your medications and complying with staff directions from now on. You might not understand, but we\u2019re doing this with your best interests at heart. Now, tell me- how are the slippers and mats? Are they making things easier on your feet?

Well that\u2019s amazing news Dennis, I\u2019m glad to hear it. SCP-4504: Yeah. I\u2019m- I\u2019ve been taking the meds like you wanted. Really- really helped. Cleared my depression right up. Dr Weber: That\u2019s great, Dennis. A really positive outcome. SCP-4504: Yup. Haven\u2019t had a suicidal thought all week. Really great. You\u2019re amazing. Just the best. Dr Weber: Uh, well thank you, Dennis- SCP-4504: Amazing. Just spectacular. You\u2019ve always been there for me. Always listening to me and- and helping me out. Wow. You must be the best shrink in the whole Foundation. Just. So great. Four seconds pause in conversation. Dr Weber: Ahuh. Dennis, there\u2019s no need for that tone of voice. SCP-4504: Huh, no- wait, I mean- Dr Weber: Making light of the situation with sarcasm and mockery doesn\u2019t help anyone. If you\u2019re still having problems you need to be honest about them. Or else you\u2019ll never get better. SCP-4504: Wait- No, I really mean it. You\u2019ve really helped me, I- I haven\u2019t had a suicidal thought all week, I swear! Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry, Dennis, but this is for your own good. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to stay on suicide watch until- SCP-4504: No! Please, it\u2019s not helping! I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t concentrate on anything! I swear I\u2019m not suicidal anymore! I won\u2019t kill myself, just let me sleep, please! Dr Weber: I\u2019m sorry, Dennis. We have no choice, we cannot allow you to self-harm. I strongly recommend continuing to take your medications and we can review you being on suicide watch again next week. SCP-4504: No! Please, I\u2019m begging you- At this point, SCP-4504 rose from its chair and attempted to move around the table to accost Dr Weber. Site security intervened, subduing SCP-4504 using tasers and pepper spray. The session was ended early and SCP-4504 was escorted back to its cell.",
        "Incident Report 88/R Date: 11/10/2015 Incident: At 1100 hours, SCP-4504 approached the wall of its containment cell. It used its anomaly to make contact with one of the wires contained therein and received a painful electric shock. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, it attempted sustained contact with the wire. Security officers entered its cell and intervened, escorting SCP-4504 to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s infirmary so it could receive treatment for electrical burns. While it was being treated, the cell was repaired. SCP-4504 was returned to it after receiving treatment. Response: Security are to maintain a constant vigil on SCP-4504 to prevent further attempts to self-harm. Incident Report 89/S Date: 15/10/2015 Incident: At 0600 hours, SCP-4504 approached the wall of its containment cell. It used its anomaly to make contact with one of the wires contained therein and received a painful electric shock. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, it attempted sustained contact with the wire. Security officers entered its cell and intervened, removing SCP-4504 to transport it to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s infirmary so it could receive treatment for electrical burns. While in transit to the infirmary, SCP-4504 attacked the security officers escorting it. It seized Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by grabbing her neck and arm. It vocalised to the attending security officers that it was a dangerous SCP and that it was going to use its anomaly on Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 unless they terminated it via gunfire first. Security officers attempted to de-escalate the situation by speaking with SCP-4504 but it proved unresponsive and repeated to security officers that it would maim its hostage unless it was terminated. While it was repeating these threats, Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was able to surprise it by ambushing it through a doorway with his taser. Security officers then proceeded to subdue SCP-4504 with tasers, pepper spray and physical force. As this occurred, the SCP repeatedly vocalised that the security officers needed to terminate it. SCP-4504 was subsequently escorted to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2019s infirmary where it was treated for second degree electrical burns, three broken ribs, and a concussion. As it was being treated, its cell was repaired and it was returned to it afterwards. The security officers involved reported negligible injuries.",
        "Response: Alternate methods of containing SCP-4504 are to be explored. Security are to maintain a constant vigil on SCP-4504 to prevent further attempts to self-harm and are to maintain a safe distance from it when transporting it throughout the Site.",

Two site security officers were also present. <Begin Log, 09:00> Dr Weber: Good morning, Dennis. How are you feeling? SCP-4504: Good. Dr Weber: Well, that\u2019s\u2026 good. Silence for five seconds. Dr Weber: Would you\u2026 care to elaborate on what you mean by that? SCP-4504: All better now. Not- not suicidal. Drugs helped. Dr Weber: Well that\u2019s very good news, Dennis. I\u2019m glad you were able to overcome this illness. SCP-4504: Thank you. Can I go off suicide watch now? Dr Weber: Hang on a moment, Dennis. I\u2019d like to ask you some questions first. SCP-4504: Why? Dr Weber: I\u2019m just curious. You say you no longer feel suicidal, but I received two reports during the week that you attempted self-harm again. Is this true? SCP-4504: That was then. This is now. Don\u2019t feel suicidal anymore. Can I go off suicide watch? Dr Weber: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea Dennis. SCP-4504: What? Dr Weber: You say you feel better, but you\u2019re still demonstrating psychomotor impairment and depressed affect. You\u2019re unresponsive. Combined with the two attempts you made during the week, well, I\u2019m not sure if your mental state is alright. My concern is that you may be malingering, uh, lying, in order to be taken off suicide watch. SCP-4504: I\u2019m not mal- lying. I don\u2019t- I\u2019m being honest. I don\u2019t feel like dying anymore. Been taking the meds. I\u2019m good now. Dr Weber: Is that so? SCP-4504: Yes. Took them everyday. Like you asked. Feel better now. Dr Weber: Really? So the guards must have been mistaken when they said they saw you hiding the pills in your pillow on your cell\u2019s security camera. Silence for four seconds. SCP-4504: What? Dr Weber: You\u2019re on suicide watch, Dennis. You\u2019re being constantly monitored. Did you really think you could get away with this? SCP-4504: Wait. I didn\u2019t- You can\u2019t- Dr Weber: Dennis, you\u2019re ill. I know you don\u2019t like this but it\u2019s for your own good. SCP-4504: Wait. Wait. You- The watch isn\u2019t helping. You can\u2019t leave me on it. Dr Weber: You need to take your medications Dennis. They\u2019re going to help you. SCP-4504: Have been taking medications! Am all better now! Suicide watch not helping! Makes me want to die worse! Dr Weber: Calm down, Dennis. I know you want to be taken off it but I am not going to risk that this isn\u2019t part of some plan to get you a better opportunity to take your own life. I\u2019m going to recommend you remain on suicide watch until two weeks after you start consistently taking your medications. SCP-4504: No! Please! It\u2019s not helping! The drugs aren\u2019t going to help! Dr Weber: I know you don\u2019t understand, Dennis. But I\u2019m doing this because I care about you. SCP-4504: No you don\u2019t! You don\u2019t listen! You just make things worse! You hate me! Dr Weber: You\u2019re being irrational, Dennis. I\u2019m going to end the session now. We have nothing further to discuss. SCP-4504: Fucker! At this point, SCP-4504 utilised its anomaly, pushing one of its hands through the table ahead of it while rising from its chair. Before security officers could react, SCP-4504 stepped through the table and pushed its other hand into Dr Weber\u2019s head, then removing it in a slashing motion. Most of Dr Weber\u2019s face and cranium was removed. Security officers moved to subdue SCP-4504 with tasers and pepper spray while it stood over Dr Weber\u2019s corpse, swearing. In the ensuing struggle, SCP-4504 managed to make contact with Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 using its anomaly, maiming his right hand and forearm and left leg. Despite this, security officers successfully subdued SCP-4504 and transported it back to its cell.",
        "Incident Report 90/T Date: 18/10/2015 Incident: After being returned to its containment cell prematurely as a result of its assault on its psychiatrist, SCP-4504 removed the mattress and sheets from its bunk and moved them into a position leaning against the wall besides the door into its cell. It sat down on the bottom of the mattress with its head resting on a pillow placed against the upright portion of the mattress. From this position it proceeded to strike at any security personnel attempting to enter into its room. Three attempts by security personnel to force entry ended in security officers being maimed by SCP-4504, once while attempting to enter while SCP-4504 was asleep. Security personnel concluded the risk of forcing their way into the cell was too great and resolved to wait until it moved away from its cell door the following morning. Given the risks involved in entering its cell, SCP-4504 was taken off suicide watch but was still observed via the cameras in its cell. SCP-4504 slept in this position for the next two weeks, striking any personnel who entered its cell between the hours of 9pm and 6am. The five security personnel injured by SCP-4504 were transported to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary. After painkillers and somnic medication proved ineffective in treatment, Site-\u2588\u2588 medical personnel amputated the areas where SCP-4504 had distorted the bodies of Security Officers \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

        "Excerpt from Containment Breach Report U/9 Incident: At 0945 hours SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 breached containment at Site-\u2588\u2588. It proceeded to rampage through the facility for the subsequent three hours, freeing two dozen other humanoid SCP objects. Among those that breached containment were SCP-4504 and SCP-082. After being released, SCP-4504 moved through the facility, navigating directly to SCP-082\u2019s containment cell. Once there, security cameras observed the two SCP objects conversing for several minutes, though the camera\u2019s audio was unfortunately unavailable. During the conversation, SCP-4504 kept its distance from SCP-082 but bowed low to it twice. SCP-082 was also observed to laugh and smile several times during their conversation. Their encounter was interrupted at 1050 by site security. When it observed security officers approaching, SCP-4504 approached SCP-082 and offered up its hands. Before security officers could intervene, SCP-082 bit cleanly through SCP-4504\u2019s wrists, severing both hands. SCP-082 was subdued by site security. SCP-4504 was swiftly relocated to Site-\u2588\u2588 infirmary in critical condition.",
        "SCP-4504 Formal Request 28/07/2016 Assisting Staff Member: Nurse Kokoro Park Request: SCP-4504 formally requests that it be reclassified from \u201cEuclid\u201d to \u201cNeutralised\u201d and released from Foundation containment. SCP-4504 has reported that since the loss of it's hands during Containment Breach U/9 it has been unable to utilise its anomaly in any form. SCP-4504 has stated it understands that any such release would require an amnestic treatment to remove its memories of its time in containment, and consents to such a procedure. It states that it does not expect an explanation or backstory for its disappearance or the loss of its hands and will be content with a simple return to its family. Response: Request granted. SCP-4504 is to be held in containment for three months in order to ensure its injuries are stable and that it is truly no longer anomalous. If these conditions are met, it is to undergo a class Sigma amnestic treatment on 05/11/2016 and subsequently be released in Brisbane, Australia. SCP-4504 is to be dressed in the same manner it was when it was acquired by the Foundation and released three streets away from its family\u2019s residence at [DATA REDACTED]. - Site Director Sandoval",
        "Incident Report 98/U Date: 03/08/2016 Incident: While treating SCP-4504 in the infirmary at 0845, Nurse Park observed a small spatial distortion in the mattress of SCP-4504\u2019s bed near its left hip. SCP-4504 quickly moved to cover the distortion with its bedsheets and denied the existence of the distortion. When Nurse Park asked it to remove the bedsheets so she could check that there was no distortion, SCP-4504 initially refused, but relented when she informed it she would have to call Site-\u2588\u2588 Security if it did not. SCP-4504 moved the blankets but attempted to conceal the anomaly by manipulating the bed\u2019s fitted sheet. Nurse Park observed the anomaly and contacted Site Security, which caused SCP-4504 to become distressed and repeatedly state that it was no longer anomalous. Response: At 0850 Security Officers arrived at the infirmary. Security officers attempted to move SCP-4504 back to its containment cell, but it resisted, continuing to insist that it was no longer anomalous. Site security subdued SCP-4504 with pepper spray and tasers and moved it back to its containment cell.",
        "Containment Breach Report V/2 Date: 03/08/2016 Incident: At 0930 SCP-4504 moved to the wall of its containment cell. It placed the end of its right arm, where its hand formerly was, against the wall and used its anomaly while drawing back its arm. By doing so it was able to remove a section of the wall the approximate size and shape of its former hand. The wires contained inside the wall did not impede this motion, as they were not contacting SCP-4504 directly. After a four second pause, SCP-4504 then repeated this motion two dozen times more within 30 seconds, tearing a hole in its cell wall and breaching containment. It exited its cell and began breaching any other containments it found, using this new application of its anomaly to dismember and decapitate any security staff it encountered. Ten minutes later, SCP-4504 escaped Site-\u2588\u2588 along with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-10 (\u201cManhunters\u201d) responded and engaged in pursuing the fleeing SCP objects. SCP-4504 was re-acquired by Foundation personnel a week later after following reports of \"a homeless man with no hands.\"",
        "Incident Report 116/W Date: 27/11/2017 Incident: At 2300 hours, after having lain in its bed for approximately thirteen hours, SCP-4504 arose and removed its clothes. It then proceeded to use its anomaly on itself by placing the ends of its arms against itself and stretching its limbs and torso. Security attempted to intervene by threatening to activate the cell\u2019s Halothane dispersal system, but SCP-4504 stated that after it woke up again it would resume its anomalous activity. Unsure if this was a genuine attempt to self-harm or a new manifestation of SCP-4504\u2019s anomaly, security officers remained outside SCP-4504\u2019s containment cell and called for its assigned psychiatrist. During SCP-4504\u2019s self-mutilation, it frequently expressed severe distress and pain. It began by elongating its limbs before moving onto its own torso, neck and head. The process was crude, especially on its torso which required almost 30 minutes to elongate as its hands were not large enough to easily manipulate it. SCP-4504\u2019s on-site psychiatrist, Dr Strickland, arrived part-way through the process. He attempted to negotiate with SCP-4504, asking it why it was self-mutilating and reminding it that poor behaviour would result in the revocation of its leisure privileges again. SCP-4504 responded with laughter, pointing out it still had not regained leisure privileges after a previous attempt to breach containment. Dr Strickland then stated that if it continued to self-harm it may be placed on suicide watch again. SCP-4504 responded with aggression and threats, stating it would kill Dr Strickland and that it knew the Foundation had been hiding antidepressants in its food. Dr Strickland again pleaded with SCP-4504 to stop mutilating itself, stating that he and the other Foundation personnel cared about its wellbeing, to which SCP-4504 again responded with laughter. Dr Strickland asked SCP-4504 why it was self-mutilating and what it thought it would accomplish, to which SCP-4504 responded \u201cWhy not?\u201d Dr Strickland continued to try and talk SCP-4504 down until it completed the process. It then breached containment, using the increased reach of its arms to disable the Halothane dispersal system inside its cell before breaking out. Its distorted body shrugged off attempts to subdue it, allowing it to kill Dr Strickland and several security officers. SCP-4504 then proceeded to rampage through the facility, maiming 12 security officers and killing 29 others. It was eventually subdued using flashbangs, stun grenades and Halothane grenades.",
        "Test Log 4504/15-3 Research Team: Senior Researcher Muhammed Al-Harthi, Junior Researcher Albert Vargas Participant: SCP-4504 Subject: D-72894, a 177cm tall Indigenous Australian male Purpose: To determine the size and shape of SCP-4504\u2019s energy fields, which had been observed during its most recent containment breach to be larger than its hands were previously. Preparation: D-72894 restrained in chair using leather straps. Researchers Al-Harthi and Vargas were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window. [BEGIN LOG] Experiment: SCP-4504 enters testing chamber. D-72894 begins vocalising distress and expletives, telling SCP-4504 to stay away from him. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach D-72894 and use its anomaly on him. SCP-4504 approaches D-72894. D-72894 continues to vocalise distress and expletives, asking SCP-4504 to stay away and not to harm him while struggling to escape from his restraints. When SCP-4504 reaches D-72894 it bends down, shushing him. It places the end of its forearm on top of D-72894\u2019s head and reassures him that it will not harm him. SCP-4504 then straightens, steps towards the room\u2019s reinforced observation window and asks the research team if they \u201cwant to see what [he] can do?\u201d. SCP-4504 then rushes the window and breaches containment while laughing. It proceeds to kill the research team and the attending security officers with before escaping into Site-\u2588\u2588. [END TEST LOG] Closing Statement: Security footage and post-mortem examination of the research teams from resulting containment breach confirms SCP-4504\u2019s \u2018hands\u2019 are enlarged to be proportionate to its new body, with its \u201cpalms\u201d being approximately 20cm in diameter and each \u201cfinger\u201d being between 45 and 60 centimetres in length. It is unknown if this is the result of SCP-4504 using its energy fields to manipulate each other or if they have grown in proportion to the rest of it. In light of this new information, SCP-4504\u2019s containment procedures should be updated as soon as possible. All future testing with SCP-4504 has been prohibited by order of Site Director Sandoval. Information about SCP-4504\u2019s anomalies should instead be observed during its containment breaches to prevent future mishaps such as this. D-72894 was returned to its cell unharmed.",
        "Excerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504 Interviewed: SCP-4504 Interviewer: Doctor White Foreword: An excerpt from SCP-4504\u2019s first interview with its most recent appointed psychiatrist on 18/09/2019. Two site security officers were also present, as well as four more security officers waiting outside. <Begin Log, 09:00> Dr White: Hello, Dennis. My name is Dr White, but you can call me Angela, if you\u2019d like. Please take a seat. SCP-4504 chuckles. SCP-4504: \u201cAngela White\u201d, huh? Your parents musta been so proud of that one. SCP-4504 moves to the chair opposite Dr White and takes a seat. Dr White: Yes, yes, I\u2019ve heard it before. Now Dennis- SCP-4504: 4504. Dr White: I\u2019m sorry? SCP-4504: 4504. It\u2019s my name. SCP-4504. Dr White: I didn\u2019t realise you preferred to be called that. Your file states you prefer to be addressed as your birth name. SCP-4504: I haven\u2019t been \u201cDennis\u201d in a long time. Dr White: Alright, I\u2019ll keep that in mind. Treating you with respect is important to me. I'm here as your friend- SCP-4504 snorts. SCP-4504: You ain\u2019t my friend. You\u2019re one of them, tryna grind me down so I\u2019ll be a good skip and sit quietly in my little concrete box without bothering anyone. You don't care about my mental health, you only care about keeping me contained. Let me ask you something. You read my file, yeah? Dr White: Yes, that\u2019s correct. SCP-4504: So you know what I did to my three other psychiatrists? Dr White: Yes. I certainly hope our relationship goes better. SCP-4504: Well, that depends on you. You gonna put me on suicide watch? Dr White: According to what I read in your file, suicide watch was largely ineffective, was mainly used to punish you for non-compliance and was the precipitating factor in a number of your violent episodes. So no, I don\u2019t think I will be recommending it. SCP-4504: You gonna try and hide drugs in my food? Dr White: No. SCP-4504: You gonna take away my leisure privileges if I talk back? Dr White: No. SCP-4504: If I tell you something\u2019s wrong, are you gonna listen or are you gonna argue and say its really my fault? Dr White: Wha- No! Of course not! How is that supposed to help you? SCP-4504: Well fuck me then. You might be the best shrink I\u2019ve ever had. Dr White: I don\u2019t want to jinx myself, but if your other psychiatrists did that then yes, I might be. Is there anything else you wanted to ask me before I get started? SCP-4504: Can you draw me a map from here to Site Director Sandoval\u2019s office with all the security patrol routes marked on it? Dr White: No. SCP-4504: Aaaahh, dangit. My cunning plan was foiled. I was so close, but you witty Foundation types managed to outfox me again. My search for Site Director Sandoval\u2019s office continues. Dr White: Yes, well. Going back to the subject of your file, I noticed there were a few important pieces of information missing from it. SCP-4504: Please don\u2019t say \u201cwe don\u2019t know exactly how big your imaginary hands are\u201d. Cuz let me tell you now, that ended badly for the last guys. Dr White: No. It's about your\u2026 transformation. SCP-4504: Oh? Dr White: I looked through your file, but you\u2019ve never really explained why you chose to mutilate yourself like that. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how painful a small area of your distortions must feel, and you chose to do that to your whole body. Why? SCP-4504: What do you mean, why? I\u2019m bulletproof. Regular guns don\u2019t hurt me. Tasers bounce off me. It hurts so much I can\u2019t even feel it if I get pepper sprayed. I\u2019m stronger than any normal man and my long legs and arms mean I can run faster and reach further than I ever could back when I was normal. Well, sorta normal. Dr White: But despite all that, you\u2019ve never used them to escape. You did this to yourself, but your file says during containment breaches you\u2019re more interested in hurting security staff than you are in actually escaping. SCP-4504: Well, where would I go? I\u2019m nine feet of freak. I could never hide like this. If I walked into any town with people in it they\u2019d scream and run away. There\u2019d be an MTF on me so fast they\u2019d break the land speed record. Dr White: But then why do it? Was giving up your chance at getting away really worth getting back at security officers? SCP-4504: Oh, fuck off. Dr White: I\u2019m sorry? Have I said something that upsets you? I didn\u2019t mean to- SCP-4504: You said you read my file, yeah? You see how many of those escapes were working for me before I did this to myself? Dr White: They weren\u2019t as successful, yes. It\u2019s why I thought you did it. To make your breaching containment more likely. SCP-4504: Wrong. I kept hoping I\u2019d get away again. First time I got out, I was outside for seven months. Seven whole months, where I could walk down a street with normal people, stand under the sky, go into shops. I got to eat whatever I wanted, drive cars, look at fuckin\u2019 trees. Then I got caught and brought back here. The next time I only managed to stay away for eight weeks. Then one. Now I\u2019m lucky if I get a few hours outside of containment. By the end there I wasn\u2019t even making it all the way off Site-\u2588\u2588 before I got caught and dragged back. I realised I was never going to escape. I looked around that little concrete box and I realised I was never going anywhere else. I was gonna die in Site-\u2588\u2588, probably in that cell. SCP-4504: You guys took everything from me. Everything. I even gave up my hands, watched \u2018em get ripped off me by an ogre, and that didn\u2019t even get me outside. The prosthetics you give me are crap, so I have to eat food like a dog. I was hurting so much. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I talked to someone who wasn\u2019t staff. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d seen the sky. You guys took that from me. SCP-4504: But you know something? You know what you can\u2019t take from me? No matter how hard you try? You know the one thing I\u2019ll always be able to enjoy? Pause for three seconds. Dr White: Vengeance? SCP-4504: Fuckin\u2019 vengeance. Lashing out at people who\u2019ve hurt you so they hurt is something so basic, so fundamental, that even dogs understand it. I had nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, you keep me isolated from people, keep me trapped in my cell. I already deal with that shit, so why not? I\u2019m already hurting so bad, it's not like it could make my pain worse. So why not? Dr White: I see. Why not make yourself into a monster, if you already get treated like one? SCP-4504: Exactly! Fuckin'- exactly. This way I can kill way more security, which is the only thing I get to enjoy anymore. Dr White: What about leisure privileges? Your file mentioned you were something of an artist. SCP-4504 snorts. SCP-4504: Like that helps. Watching a TV in a dingy little room? Watching a shitty little pot-plant slowly wither and die? And how\u2019m I supposed to paint something good when I only ever see the inside of this place? Plus most of it is really fucking awkward to use when you\u2019ve got no hands. Dr White: Well, we can start with that. I\u2019m going to recommend a review of your leisure privileges to make them more accessible and enjoyable for you. I\u2019m also going to recommend you be awarded socialisation privileges again, and that you be escorted around the outside perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 once a week. Four seconds of silence. SCP-4504: What? Dr White: That was something you asked for, years ago when you first joined us, wasn\u2019t it? Being escorted around the facility once a week so you could see the outside world? And you said it yourself. A lot of your violence occurs as a result of your feelings of powerlessness and emotional distress, which are in turn caused by your social and physical isolation. I haven\u2019t known you long, but it seems like letting you have these small privileges would vastly decrease both your distress and your violent tendencies. Of course these privileges would be contingent on your good behaviour, but you would understand that by now. I also can\u2019t guarantee Site Director Sandoval will allow any of this, but I certainly intend to argue for it. Uh- with your permission of course. Four seconds of silence. SCP-4504: Jesus Christ, Angela! Fuck yes, I want this! Where have you been all this time? Shit, I\u2019d kiss you but I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019d start shit with the guards. Dr White: Yes, probably. Now I had a few other things I thought you might like to talk about, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "SCP-4504 Formal Request 18/09/2019 Assisting Staff Member: Dr Angela White Request: SCP-4504 formally requests the return of socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 also requests a review of its leisure privileges so they can be personalised so they are made more appropriate and more accessible for it, as well as the opportunity to be escorted around the perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 once a week. Response: SCP-4504\u2019s leisure privileges will be reviewed. The rest of this request is denied. Too much chance of a flight risk with this one. \u2013 Site Director Sandoval",
        "Email, Dated 19/09/2018 to: J.Sandoval@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from: A.White@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Subject: SCP-4504 Formal Request Body: Greetings Site Director. I know you have already responded to SCP-4504\u2019s request, but I would ask that you review your decision. As indicated in the attached documents and my interview with it yesterday, SCP-4504 is far less of a flight risk than it once was. Further, almost all of its violence is precipitated by feelings of isolation, powerlessness and distress. Alleviating these would undoubtedly reduce its violent outbursts. I would also draw your attention to its history regarding its medication. Never once has it attempted to breach containment or harm staff while its medication was being delivered. Why? Because it understands that if it was to do this, it would lose access to the painkillers it needs. SCP-4504 has repeatedly stated that it needs to socialise with non-staff and it needs time outside. I believe if you fulfill these requests, SCP-4504 will regard them the same way as its medication and will behave. It\u2019s for these reasons I\u2019m asking you to review your decision regarding SCP-4504\u2019s formal request. Angela Email, Dated 19/09/2018 to: A.White@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from: J.Sandoval@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Subject: Re: SCP-4504 Formal Request Body: Fine. But you have to go with it during the excursions, and I will hold you responsible if your assessments are inaccurate. Site Director Sandoval",
        "Excursion Report A/1 Date: 23/09/2019 SCP-4504 was escorted to the exit to Site-\u2588\u2588 by four security staff, led by Security Sergeant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. They were met by Staff Psychiatrist Dr Angela White. Before commencing the excursion, Dr White asked SCP-4504 how it was feeling. SCP-4504 stated it felt anxious, and that it believed the excursion was more likely to be part of a complex decommissioning procedure than it was to be genuine excursion. Security Sergeant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 informed SCP-4504 that it was genuine, but he would turn it into a decommissioning procedure if SCP-4504 attempted to escape Foundation custody. SCP-4504 attempted to respond with aggression, but Dr Angela White interrupted and was able to redirect both parties by beginning the excursion. SCP-4504 and Dr White were escorted twice around the perimeter of Site-\u2588\u2588 over the course of an hour, as planned. SCP-4504 did not attempt escape. The only occurrence of note was that at approximately fifteen minutes after commencing the excursion SCP-4504 began to weep.",
