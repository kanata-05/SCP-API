MTF Sigma-5 (\"'; DROP TABLE taskforces \n--\n\") is responsible for monitoring and suppressing discussion of SCP-4943 in online forums.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4943 is a patch for Windows 10 operating system pushed by the Windows Update Service on December 13, 2019. Microsoft Corporation has claimed no involvement in its development; further investigation indicated that the patch had been issued by an unknown third party that had compromised Microsoft's internal network.\n\n\nSCP-4943-1 is a type of service process created when a user makes physical contact with a machine running SCP-4943 or a connected peripheral device\n1\n. This has not been observed to affect the user in question. SCP-4943-1 instances display signs of sentience and identify themselves as the user corresponding to their creation. While the mechanisms behind these processes are not yet fully understood, they appear to be dependent on a series of registry keys initialized during their creation; deleting or editing these keys consistently causes the corresponding instance to terminate. Instances are run under the LocalService account and have been observed creating and editing files to communicate.\n\n\nSCP-4943-1 instances are highly unstable; 71% of instances used in testing crashed due to a fatal error within 6 hours of runtime.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-4943 was discovered after the Site-\u2588\u2588 IT department was alerted to suspicious network traffic originating from a system in the Site-\u2588\u2588 cafeteria used to order breakfast sandwiches. Logs indicate that SCP-4943 had been automatically installed on the machine earlier that day. While logs indicate up to 76 SCP-4943-1 processes had been present on the machine, no active instances were detected at the time of investigation.\n\n\nThe following are a series of files and logs recovered from that system.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFile path:\n C:\\Users\\Default\\fdsowhfdssujjluyes\\lelhdfojsaaoehdf.hme\n\n\nDate created:\n 2019/12/13, 9:02 AM\n\n\n\n\n\u00daB\u2018}jm\u00f9M5\u0082\u00f3\u00a5\u00e5<=\u00b9K\u00beK\u00f7\u007fa\u00c7NE\u00ad\u00c5\u00f4\u00c9\u007f]\u00c2R\u00fa`\u00eb\u00a1\u00dao\u0086\u00b2\u00c5\u00f2\u001b\u00c5\u0086\u0096\u009c\"{\u00b3\u008a gy\n\n\u00ac;}\u00cf\u00eb>\u00f4\u008cH\u008d\u0090 \u00a8\u00897\u008f\u00d2s\u00b3\u00b7]\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5EA\u00d2X \u00cdk$\u0086#\u0095\u0082B\u00c2\u00d4j\u0081\u00f2\u00b36\u00e4\u00b4\u0085\u0083\u00af@\u00fc\u00f0\u00be\u00dd\u00ec\u008bH\u00f0\u00e8\u00c5\u0085\u00f9:\u00d5/\u00d3\u00ba\u00e1q\u00b2\u00dc\u00cf\n\n]\u00e7\u0096\u00e7\u00fc5_Q\u00a3`\u00bak\u00dc\u00e0KgH;\u00e4Y\u00e7j\n\nN_Q\u00fc=\u00a8\u00a9l\u00bc\u00f8\u00b4\u009a\u00c8\\\u00d9S#\u00cb\u00e7\u0092\u0092\u00c3\u00b7_\u00da\u0094\u00f1\u00cf[\u00cfbDR>V6\u00c4;!T\u00f9\u00bay\u0090\u001b\u00ed\u0081x\u00b7\u00d5J\u00cf\u00e1\u0089\u00a4.F\u00ba\u00c61&\u00a8}\u00b1\n\n\u00c6y6Ca{}\n\n\u00e7\u00ce)le\u001b\u00b5\u008e\u0097\u00e4Bw\u00b4\u0095@\u0098.\u0088\u0089\u00db\u00c1Q\u00be\u0096\u0099\u008c\u00aew\u00f6E?\u0083l.\u00f1\u0097\u00aa>\u00cfu\u009f\u0087<M@\u00a6\u00b5\u001bPm\u2019\u008e\u00a1\u00ca\u00e8i;\u00d0*\u009e\u00dc\u0085\u00c9ONn\u0099d\u00ee\u00b5.V\u00ce-k\u0099yn\u008c\"\u00b9\u00a3\u0099\u00db\u009c\u00c7\u009c\u00e9GJ\u00a6\u00bc\u00fdL\u00ce\u0097wh\n\nwx\u00ba\u00df\u0088V(J\u00e4=vwhh\u00d5R\u00d5\u00bb\u0080-4\n\n\u00aa\u00c7W\u0096\u00b7nA\u00d58w\u00ef\u0086\u00df'|f\u00e6}\u00f4\n\n\u0094\u00ac\u00b9\u00c7\u00fel0\u00c3\u00c5\u008f\u00b4^#\u008f4gwhhhh\u008a\u00e6AWOq&8\u00aeS\u00b5\u00f4(\u00e4\u00a7\u00a6\u00e4\u00c92)\u00f4\u0090\u0092D\u009aN\u00b4u8\u00ff\"\u0099\u00f8l\u00b6\u00fe\u00f0\u00c8\u00fd\u00c6\u009b\u00e6\u00a3KX\u009a\u00f8\u00dd4\n\n`\u0080Tk\u009a\u00b5R\u00bf\u008b\u00b7N(\u00edEq`\u00c0\u009e\u00d6bwhhhh.Fw\u00ab\u00bb>\n\n\u00bd\u00fd8\u008eG4_\u00c1fO]IU\u00f61\u00866\u0094\u0088\u00b0f\u00fa\u00bc\u008a\u0091\u00925\u00d1\u00cfB\u00d7\u00aeL(\u00af7whJN\u00f2\u0088\\\u00fd<\u00far\u00dc[\u00ff\u0089X\u00d0\u009c;\u00f58\u00f9\u0093a/\u00d4\u00a5#whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwhhhhhhh\n\nwhwh\u0087hwhhwhheUwheeereeamiihiiiiiiiiiiyiiiii\n\nwhawha\u0094iis\u0093thisqssSs\n\nwhatisthis\n\nwheredeveryonego\n\n\nbenwhereareyou\n\nicanhearyoubutICANTseeyou\n\n\nstaycalm\n\njustbreathe\n\n\u00caIt\u00db\u00f4BY\u00e6\u009b\u00d1\u00c0H\u0088\u00ba\u00c1\u008c?\u00ef\n\nt\u00ebBR\u00a9\u00f2p*\u00f2(\u00d6XQE\u0082S\u0083\u00df6VSB\u00bd\u00f9n>\u00f5]\u00e9\u00c5@\n\nicantbreathe\n\nhavetofindawayoutofhere\n\nstillcantsee\n\n\nwait\n\nwhatarethoselights\n\n\nWHOtouchedme\n\n\nno\n\nNO\n\nGETAWAYFROMME\n\nGETMEOUTOFHEEU5E\u0091$R| \u00c8\u00d1\u00d3V\u009b\u00f1!\u001b\u00c6\u00a6\u00b7E\u0082\u009cm\u00e4\u00b7~\u00fa\u00a9}h\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Edit lock terminated.

Of course, wky do you aSk? NEVERMIND. What can everyone see? Or sense, I guess. what does hlkm:\\\\system mean?

I CAN SEE IT TOO. You meao to tell mU we're al\\ trapped im a computer?0How does txat even/work? we work with anomalies for a living it shouldnt work at all but here we are SO NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? What kind of computer experience do yall have? NOT MUCH, SORRY. just enough to do my job I don^t havu much eithur. so i'm stuck in a computer with a bunch of people who know nothing about computers. very comforting. Give me a second. I need to wrap my head around this. Okay. Ive got an idea but Im going to need everyones help. Dr. Bishop and Osiris, see if you can figure out how to send data over the network. If you can, try to get an email out letting someone know were here. I dont care who, anyone who might read it. any idea how we would do that Not really. We're all shooting in the dark here. Figure it out. Dr Bold, come up with a way to communicate once we get help. Maybe a file on the desktop or someplace obvious. YOU GOT IT MORGAN. AND YOU CAN CALL ME CAL. Cal it is. Quinn, you said you were with investigations right? Poke around and see if you can figure out how we got here. That might be the key to getting back out. Any questions? what about you? don't tell me you were planning on pinning all the work on us. Actually I was going to take a look at the sound drivers. If I can make enough noise I might be able to get some eyes on us. Sound good?",

We tried using the speakers. We tried changing the desktop background. Dr Bishop has disappeared into oblivion. If the clock Quinn found is accurate weve been in here for about a week. And we still have no idea how we got here in the first place. Im going to be straight with yall, Im running out of ideas. I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME EYES IF WE SHUT DOWN THE SYSTEM. ah, suicide. always a great way to get attention. NOT NECESSARILY. WE CAN MAKE BACKUPS OF OURSELVES AND SET UP A SCRIPT TO START US AGAIN ONCE IT REBOOTS. Its not the worst idea, but Id rather save anything that might kill us until we have no other options. FAIR ENOUGH. Quinn, what do you think? i've got nothing, sorry. OSIRIS, YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET LATELY. ANY THOUGHTS? im done What? i found out what happened to bishop he got lost i found some files he left trying to find us if hes still alive theres not much left of him just think about it for a second weve been here for weeks now if anyone was coming they would have found us by now or worse maybe they have and are just using us as their guinea pigs OSIRIS, CALM DOWN. WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE, WHATEVER IT TAKES. stay if you want but im not going to sit around and wait to slowly lose my mind goodbye Osiris, stop! I swear to God we are getting out of here! Osiris! HE'S GONE. HE DESTROYED HIS KEYS. now what are we going to do? \u2026give me a minute. I need to think.",
