Any satellite images possibly revealing the existence of SCP-1565 are to be edited accordingly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1565 denotes a group of 37 common snapping turtles (\nChelydra serpentina\n) residing within an irregularly shaped area on Hellas, the largest impact crater on Mars. SCP-1565 instances are visually indistinguishable from nonanomalous snapping turtles, but exhibit several differences in behavior:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1565 instances neither require nutrition, nor excrete waste.\n\n\nSCP-1565 instances show no signs of aging.\n\n\nSCP-1565 instances are capable of 'swimming' into and beneath the Martian surface.\n\n\nEvery 119 days, SCP-1565 instances arrange themselves in an inward-facing triangular array, then disperse.\n\n\nSCP-1565 instances are nearly impervious to damage, except from SCP-1565-A (see Addendum).\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1565-A is a translucent green barrier surrounding the area containing the SCP-1565 instances. SCP-1565-A is impervious to gases and maintains an internal atmosphere of 65% sulfur dioxide, 29% carbon dioxide, and 6% argon. SCP-1565-A fluctuates in shape, and has been shrinking by approximately 0.012% per decade.\n\n\nSCP-1565 instances have been recorded diving as deep as 600\u00a0m beneath the Martian surface. Sensors attached to these instances detected the presence of large corroded subterranean metal structures.\n\n\nInitial attempts to further examine these ruins were hampered by SCP-1565 instances diving down and blocking probes with their shells. Following restraint of the SCP-1565 instances, probes determined the metal structures to be the remains of large spires carved with intricate reliefs of turtle-like shapes. Electronic interference caused by high amounts of radiation emitted from below the spires' bases prevented further exploration.\n\n\nAddendum 1565-01:\n After applying a force exceeding 100\u00a0kN to an instance of SCP-1565 (as part of an attempt to remove it from SCP-1565-A), its shell was shattered and its body dismembered.\n\n\nAnalysis revealed that the SCP-1565 instance contained a secondary internal casing underneath its shell, housing the vital organs. This casing is designated SCP-1565-B, and replaces the spine and ribs expected in nonanomalous turtles. SCP-1565-B is composed of a lead-cadmium-beryllium layered composite, designed to block ionizing radiation. It includes several electronic components, some of which are responsible for SCP-1565's preservation, as well as a receiver antenna and a green, crystalline great dodecahedron acting as data storage.\n\n\nDuring routine testing, illuminating one specific face of the crystal with X-rays generated a holographic image depicting the surface of Mars in detail (albeit inaccurately; the image was missing most of Mars' impact craters) with 47 bright points scattered across its surface. One point corresponds to SCP-1565-A's location; exploration of the remaining locations is pending approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1564\n | SCP-1565 | \nSCP-1566\n \u00bb",
