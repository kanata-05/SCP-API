Any unauthorized personnel attempting access to SCP-6665 are to be detained and questioned, regardless of clearance.\n\n\nThe continued lobotomization of SCP-6665-\u03b1 will retain the functionality of SCP-6665 and the Foundation as a whole. One subject \u2014 designated 'Caretaker' \u2014 will be selected to perform daily medical examinations on SCP-6665 and its components, in order to ensure its continued complicity. Caretaker must perform the following medical routine for SCP-6665. Precise amounts specified are subject to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEKDAY\n\n\nREQUIRED MEDICAL INTERVENTION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n\n\nBeginning of starvation period; SCP-6665-\u2588 and its chamber are to be thoroughly examined. Blood transfusion to SCP-6665-\u03b1, type A+ or compatible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\nGeneral examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\nPlaque entanglement implantation (3-5, dependent on recent behavior) into SCP-6665-\u03b1, through the use of SCP-6665. Subsequent assurance of proper implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday\n\n\nGeneral examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nSynaptic retrogenesis injections (10cc), injected nasally into SCP-6665-\u03b1. This will be followed by intense monitoring of SCP-6665-\u2588, and any cries that are thought to be heard from inside the black chamber. Subsequent self-assurance that such cries mean nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\nGeneral examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\nEnd of starvation period. Sanitation of any residual nothingness. Repairs from any coinciding occurrences. Wiping the eyes and mouth of SCP-6665-\u03b1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis routine can be ignored on the dates of July 20th, October 12th, February 14th, and August 22nd. On the former two dates, procedures can be performed with marginal effectivity if a chocolate cake with several candles is present.\n\n\nPersonnel unable to recall vital and/or personal information as a result of SCP-6665 will be discreetly given replacement information; their memories are to be altered to accommodate this change. All civilians in contact with afflicted personnel will undergo similar memory alteration to apply the replacement information. Civilian databases will be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\nAny vomiting by affected personnel is to be attributed to common food poisoning. The vomit is to be thoroughly removed and incinerated.\n\n\nNARM0.0.aic \u2014 the Foundation grammatical assistance intelligence construct \u2014 has been updated with additional protocol measures allowing for it to repair data loss from SCP-6665 errors whenever possible. Such reparation, however, is usually futile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject BLACKBOX insignia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6665 is Project BLACKBOX, which is currently responsible for all classified information redaction in Foundation databases.\n\n\nSCP-6665 consists of a 15m tall, biomechanical, conical apparatus, affixed in a position of vertical levitation within Site-01. SCP-6665 predominantly resembles the shape of an orbitoclast\n1\n, which gradually tapers down from a diameter of 2m to a small point at its end.\n\n\nAt the top of SCP-6665 \u2014 in place of a normal orbitoclast handle \u2014 is a 2m tall black chamber of unknown composition. Atop this chamber is a large glass tank, which feeds directly into the chamber's only opening. While internal imaging indicates this chamber is hollow, nothing can be seen inside. This nothing is designated SCP-6665-\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-6665-\u03b1 is former Foundation Co-Administrator Malorie Auguste\n. SCP-6665-\u03b1 is in a constant state of being lobotomized by SCP-6665, puncturing through its thought. SCP-6665-\u03b1 has been integrated into SCP-6665; further details are strictly indeterminable.\n\n\nPeriodically, the tank atop SCP-6665 will begin to fill with a viscous substance from no apparent source; a liquid which is black yet colorful. After approximately one week of continuous use, the tank will be filled completely, its contents are then dispensed into the chamber of SCP-6665-\u2588. The chamber will violently vibrate for the next hour, a behavior which gradually subsides.\n\n\nFollowing this, SCP-6665-\u03b1 will vomit nothing out of its mouth, which will then become something.\n\n\nSCP-6665 causes the instantaneous replacement of classified information in Foundation databases with black boxes or other appropriate redaction techniques, with said redactions cognitively registering only when the observer is under the clearance level of the obscured data. SCP-6665 affects physical documentation by obscuring information with lines of black ink, which appears as if printed directly into the affected documents.\n\n\nInformation expunged by SCP-6665 is subject to loss of remembrance by Foundation personnel, an effect which correlates to security clearance in relation to information confidentiality. While some information can be temporarily remembered through non-Foundation sources, it will quickly be once again forgotten.\n\n\nSCP-6665 is prone to frequent errors. SCP-6665 will expunge extraneous information, such as names, dates, numerical values, and locations, even when such information is not entirely classified. This affects all levels of security clearance, and retroactively alters all former revisions of affected documents, causing Foundation recovery of most of this data to be impossible. Due to this, small pieces of data are wholly unmemorable by Foundation personnel of any clearance. Personnel heavily affected by this information removal occasionally vomit nothing, which usually remains nothing.\n\n\nIt is unknown if SCP-6665 can be disconnected from Foundation databases or otherwise deactivated, as the O5 Council has forbade any such action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6665-1 \u2014 Project Creation\n\n\n\n\nOn 2020/20/01, Project BLACKBOX was commissioned by O5-2 with assent from a majority of the O5 Council. This directly followed the deaths of both original Administrators Malorie and Maddison Auguste, the cumulative result of their respective long and arduous battles with dementia. Upon recovery of the former's body and the containment of the latter's persistence, precise plans for SCP-6665 were created, utilizing each Administrators' existing states as the main components of its operation.\n\n\nThese plans and their justification were sent to an O5 Council vote for approval.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject BLACKBOX Vote Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was all a matter of time.\n\n\nMalorie and Maddison were great people, greater leaders. Their bond, it bonded the Foundation into the organization it is today. Peacekeepers, protectors. It's a shame, as it always is, they got old, lost their way, their minds. No amount of love \u2014 personal or otherwise \u2014 can stop the infernal creep of the mind's melting.\n\n\nWith tragedy comes opportunity, like a phoenix fueling a fire. A new age begins, one of flourishment for our mighty organization. One where we \ntruly\n realize why 'protect' is only the last word in our motto. Securing knowledge, containing absolute reality; what need is protection when the horrors are forgotten? Erased from memory? Purged from thought?\n\n\nThis will only be the start of the beginning. Our Foundation, the test ground for true security, true containment. We can live burning in the light of all past knowledge, while the world remains sheltered in the dark warmth of the black boxes.\n\n\nCOUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nNAY\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPROVED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nThis is not who we are.

O5-2 was initially self-designated as the acting Caretaker, and began its routine medical examinations. A majority of these were mundane, showing little resistance to performing the core directives of Project BLACKBOX outside of unremarkable melancholic vocalizations.\n\n\nSeveral notable examinations \u2014 alongside relevant documentation \u2014 have been provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORT #\u2588\u2588 \u2014 \u2588\u258820/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n Pounding is heard inside of the black chamber. SCP-6665-\u03b1 convulses, resulting in a temporary malfunction in SCP-6665 as a whole. SCP-6665-\u03b1 vomits nothing, which becomes a front door.\n\n\nIt opens. Nothing smiles, grocery bags in hand, with an announcement:\n\n\n\n\nI'm home!\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6665-\u03b1 reaches out its arms. \nIt\n \nclings\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nashes\n. The door closes. It melts back into nothing, which pushes SCP-6665 slightly further into SCP-6665-\u03b1.

This causes SCP-6665 to clog, culminating in the glass container fracturing slightly at its top. A small quantity of fluid is ejected from the tank as a result. Once it has settled to the floor, the colors of the puddle vibrate and strum like guitar strings.\n\n\nA singing voice is thought to be heard from inside the black chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we died tomorrow I would be just fine.\n\nIf we flew away we would live alright.\n\n\nWhen I look into the pupils of your eyes, so blue,\n\nI see the reflection of me smiling at you.\n\nSmiling at you.\n\nSmiling at you.\n\nSmiling at you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6665-\u03b1 attempts to move its arms together. Before they can reach each other, they once again fall limp.\n\n\nThe crack is promptly patched without further incident. Residue was reinserted into the tank, wherein it is reluctantly processed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nTwo, what is this? One just brought this to my desk, this\u2026 I remember this, I think.

Several cognitohazards are suddenly unredacted throughout Foundation databases as a result. \nMAL\n casualties are reported.\n\n\nSCP-6665-\u03b1 vomits. The vomit becomes a black and white rabbit. The red bow on the top of its head bleeds. The rabbit smiles, nothing else smiles.\n\n\nVoices are heard:\n\n\n\n\nAhh! Oh my gosh!\n\n\nDo you like it?

So are you.\n\n\n(Display of affection.)\n\n\nHappy anniversary.\n\n\n\n\nThe rabbit isn't there anymore. The eyes of SCP-6665-\u03b1 melt slightly.

All backup generators failed to automatically engage, causing a total power outage for 1 minute and 45 seconds. This caused a temporary deactivation of SCP-6665 and its containment machinations, which caused multiple unprecedented events surrounding the apparatus.\n\n\nA full log of this power outage as viewed from the containment chamber of SCP-6665 can be found below; certain information not viewable in this footage has been supplied by O5-2.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n(\nO5-2 performs the scheduled medical routine, cataloging a higher quantity of plaque entanglement implantation into the computer terminal's medical records window.
