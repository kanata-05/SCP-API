One unarmed guard is to be posted inside the cell at all times to \nprevent tampering.\n\n\nSCP-1032 is to be monitored at all times by a high-speed camera fitted with a macro lens capable of no less than 20x magnification, or greater as necessary to ensure that all text on the hands is legible. The footage from this camera is to be searched daily for any instances of any hand passing the 12\u00a0o'clock position (\"midnight events\"; see Description). After each midnight event, the new text for the hand involved must be recorded, and its current speed and estimated time to midnight calculated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1032 is a silver alarm clock of unknown make and origin. The clock is made from silver, plastic, and glass, and bears twenty-two (22) hands of various sizes and shapes.\n\n\nThe movements of SCP-1032's hands do not measure the passage of time. Each hand instead measures the time until the end of an ongoing event or the destruction of an extant entity. White text on the front of each hand, in sizes ranging from barely legible to microscopic, describes the event to be measured by that hand.\n\n\nWhen one of SCP-1032's hands reaches the twelve o'clock position, several events occur simultaneously, the combination of which is referred to as a \"midnight event\". First, the event or entity currently written on the hand ends or is destroyed. Second, the text on the hand spontaneously changes to describe a new event or entity, which need not bear any relation to the previous one. Third, the hand's rotational velocity changes.\n\n\nTo date, SCP-1032 has never been wrong: every event appearing on its hands has ended precisely at the moment of the corresponding midnight event. It has accurately predicted the deaths of over \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 individual organisms, the fall of \u2588\u2588 governments, the dissolution of \u2588\u2588\u2588 major agencies and institutions, the death of a language, and the beginning of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588. Since any given hand's speed remains constant at all times except during midnight events, the time to the end of any entity measured by one of the object's hands can be predicted precisely.\n\n\nThe hands are designated SCP-1032-01 through -1032-22, in order of size from smallest to largest.\n\n\nThe following is a list of SCP-1032's hands and their current inscriptions. A full log of all relevant past inscriptions can be found at [FILE ACCESS RESTRICTED]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1032-01\n\nCurrent text: SCP-1032-01 rotates too fast to have a constant measurement.\n\nPredicted date (of next midnight event): N/A\n\nNotes: SCP-1032-01's only recorded text to date has been one of the three following: \"A thought.\" \"A sound.\" or \"A sensation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1032-02\n\nCurrent text: \"The worst thing that will ever happen to anybody.\"\n\nPredicted date: SCP-1032-02 moves too slowly to measure.\n\nNotes: Due to the vagueness of this inscription and the impossibility of calculating the time until its next midnight event, no useful information on SCP-1032-2 is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1032-03\n\n\nCurrent text: \"My Safe classification.\"\n\n\nPredicted date: 02/06/2012\n\n\nNotes: Dr. Guenther has suggested that, since SCP-1032 shows signs of self-awareness, it should be promoted to a Euclid-class threat. This proposal is scheduled for review on the 2nd of June, 2012.\n\n\nCurrent text: \"My Euclid classification.\"\n\nPredicted date: 09/01/2015\n\nNotes: As SCP-1032 has yet to manifest any properties warranting a Keter classification, Dr. Edison has proposed that SCP-1032 should be demoted to Safe. This proposal is scheduled for review on the 9th of January, 2015.\n\n\nYes, blindly following this prediction isn't very productive, especially when it's probably just going to make us change it back anyway. But the way these things usually work if we don't demote it, it might start doing things that force us to make it Keter.

Five minutes before his predicted death, the subject was sealed in an airtight steel chamber with two guards; all three were equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus. Despite all precautions taken, D-56342 expired exactly at the predicted time. His guards were initially unable to determine the cause of death, until it was discovered that his oxygen tank had mistakenly been filled with the pressurized VX nerve gas used to control SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
