Or simply SCP-8535. Dr. Tula. Her condition has significantly worsened from the previous day. Hairs cover about 85% of the body now, each strand reaching 10 centimeters at minimum, 25 on maximum. Growth of additional appendages has only increased drastically; the second appendage has already finished its growth, an additional set of arms is already forming on the sides of her abdomen.\n\n\nAttempted questioning today. Although she answered rudimentary \"yes or no\" questions, capacity for higher thought has seemingly been hampered. Subject reacts with human behavior when in the presence of objects once significant to her (lab equipment, engagement ring, etc.). She displays the greatest reaction whenever Agent Bokowitz Pearce is mentioned.

Arms have fully formed. Hairs are covering the entirety of her body now. It doesn't look pleasant. Had an incident today. When the standard dietary regimen was provided to it, SCP-8535 reacted with hostility. It then proceeded to use the rations to paint symbols and markings on the chamber's walls. Already asked Linguistics about this; they've got no clue either.\n\n\nCognitive abilities have regressed drastically. Subject shows an aversion to light. Objects that once held meaning to the subject garner no reaction from the subject anymore.\n\n\nStaff have complained of visual and auditory hallucinations of smaller tarantula specimens within the chamber.

She screams in agony, as she is dragged into the floor below. Iota-2 | Gecko proceeds up the stairs toward the roof.>\n\n\n<He finally manages to reach the top. An open vent cover lies right next to him. He looks up to see SCP-8535 on a pole, SCP-107 in hand. Surrounding the entity is a vast array of Ways all leading to various parts of the Earth. The entity attempts to retch into SCP-107.>\n\n\n<Clearly exhausted and dazed, Iota-2 | Gecko takes out his firearm and shoots SCP-8535. The entity recoils in pain and drops SCP-107. The entity stares angrily at Iota-2 | Gecko.>\n\n\n<The entity lunges at him. He closes his eyes, already having accepted his fate. Then SCP-8535 is knocked away in the air. Iota-2 | Gecko opens his eyes, confused.>\n\n\n<Helicopters arrive on the top of the tower. On one of them is Agent Pearce, who had taken the shot to knock off SCP-8535 mid-air with a rifle.>\n\n\n<Iota-2 | Gecko is speechless.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Kid, get out of here! We'll handle the situation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Mass amounts of soldiers of MTF Nu-7 land on the rooftop, surrounding a dazed SCP-8535. They train their weapons at it. Agent Pearce gestures for them to hold their fire.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNU-7 | BETA:\n What? We don't take orders from him!\n\n\nPEARCE:\n Director Dellen has appointed me second in command. So you better shut up or you'll get demoted to D-Class!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Nu-7 | Beta remains silent.>\n\n\n<Agent Pearce approaches the wounded SCP-8535. He kneels down before it and reaches out a hand at it. It recoils and shrieks in terror.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Woah! Hey, hey\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Pearce brushes the top of the entity's head. Tears begin to form in his eyes. He smiles.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n You really let yourself go, huh?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<There is a low, yet non-aggressive growl from SCP-8535. It eases at his touch slightly.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Come on. Let's get you back home.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Soldiers approach SCP-8535. At their sight, the entity immediately begins to shriek and run toward SCP-107.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Tara, no!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<The entity acquires SCP-107 by knocking a few soldiers over the edge of the roof. It is fired upon, but it takes the hits as it begins to retch into SCP-107. Pearce runs at the entity.>\n\n\n<Before it can retch into the object, however, a green glow manifests beside it. Out of it come several masked people, one of them being PoI-8535-A. They restrain SCP-8535 with thaumic whips.>\n\n\n<Pearce is at a loss for words.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPOI-8535-A:\n Take the shell!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Pearce runs toward the entity and retrieves SCP-107 off of it. He immediately begins to run the opposite direction.>\n\n\n<SCP-8535 visibly struggles against its restraints. A shadowy mass begins to seep out from SCP-8535.>\n\n\n<The entity shrieks loudly. Out of it emerges a shadowy mass that quickly envelops the entire roof and sky. Out of that mass emerges the face of a tarantula with giant glowing green eyes. It looks down upon the entire city. PoI-8535-A is greatly disturbed at the sight, near motionless.>\n\n\n<The mass hisses loudly. A whirlwind of shadows is generated from the top of the tower. It knocks back all people on it.>\n\n\n<Amidst the shadowy mass and chaos stands Dr. Tula, exposed down to her bare skin, head slumped back, arms outstretched. She is levitating several centimeters off the floor.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Tara!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Pearce attempts to stand in the chaos. He can barely get close to her.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Tara! Look at me!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<She is unresponsive, as if she cannot hear Agent Pearce.>\n\n\n<Pearce manages to get close to her. He is inches away from touching her.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n \n(shouts)\n Look at me! Tara, look at me!\n\n\nTULA:\n \n(coarse)\n Leave\u2026 me\u2026\n\n\nPEARCE:\n Tara! You remember that day? On the boat?\n\n\n*TULA:** \n(coarse)\n No\u2026 please\u2026\n\n\nPEARCE:\n It was the day we first met. I asked you out on a martini, under splashing waves of the ocean and a beautiful sunset. Remember?\n\n\nTULA:\n \n(coarse)\n No\u2026 no\u2026\n\n\nPEARCE:\n And the way you laughed. Oh, it was horrible. Like a dying parrot. That was when I knew that you were gonna be the woman I would want to spend the rest of my life with.\n\n\nTULA:\n Stop\u2026 \n(normal voice, tearful)\n Stop\u2026\n\n\nPEARCE:\n And the ring.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Pearce pulls out the engagement ring.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n You said yes.\n\n\nTULA:\n N\u2014 \n(coarse)\n No!\n\n\nPEARCE:\n Yes! Yes! I love you. I always loved you. And I always will. Please, Tara\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Tula's head is bowed. Pearce finally touches her. He lifts it up, so that their eyes are meeting.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Come back. Please.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<There is a sudden reverberation of all surrounding noise. Dr. Tula screams out in reverse, causing the shadowy apparition to retract back into her body. Her screams and cries are accompanied by the loud hissing noise of a million tarantulas.>\n\n\n<Tula slumps back in on herself. She is crying. She falls to the floor. Pearce tends to her. Tula embraces him in a tight hug, crying a river.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n \n(tearful)\n Tara. Oh, my God, Tara\u2026\n\n\nTULA:\n \n(tearful)\n I will always love you. Always. But I can't stay.\n\n\nPEARCE:\n \n(tearful)\n W\u2014what?\n\n\nTULA:\n I will always love you.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Tula reaches out to kiss Pearce on the lips. The last kiss they will ever have. Tears run down along the side of their faces. Their tears land in SCP-107.>\n\n\n<The tears cause SCP-107 to activate. Its outer rim glows a bright red, and the entire city is immediately beset with rainfall.>\n\n\n<The rain causes all transformed people to revert back to their original states. Thousands upon millions transform back.>\n\n\n<The man and the homeless woman transform back. Dr. Lease and Agent Lillon transform back.>\n\n\n<Tula lets go of Pearce. He looks onto her for one last time.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTULA:\n Don't come looking for me. Live your life. Promise me.\n\n\nPEARCE:\n I\u2014I\u2026\n\n\nTULA:\n Goodbye.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Tula retreats back. She transforms back into her animalistic SCP-8535 form. It writhes around in utter confusion and pain.>\n\n\n<It looks onto Agent Pearce. There is a knowing exchange in stares between the two. SCP-8535 quickly snaps out of it. It hisses, before running off into a Way and disappearing once it closes behind it.>\n\n\n<Pearce stares on ahead. He can barely process what has just transpired. The whirlwind demanifests. Everyone slowly recovers. PoI-8535-A puts a hand on Pearce's shoulder. Pearce turns around. PoI-8535-A is smiling. Pearce returns the smile.>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n Following Incident 8535-\u03b1, clean-up operations were conducted on the entirety of the Three Portlands location by the combined efforts of the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition and Unusual Incidents Unit.\n\n\nResources for the subsequent rebuilding efforts were transferred to the Mayor, while a large majority of the citizenry was amnesticized upon request. Medical expenses to any injured were also provided.\n\n\nSubsequent searches immediately after the incident could not locate PoI-8535-A, nor any hints as to the whereabouts of SCP-8535. All Foundation units were subsequently retracted from the location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX [8535-012]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 05/21/2025\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Foundation Research Site-67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<The medical wing is stocked to the brim with doctors and agents. Agent Pearce is talking to a doctor indistinctly. The doctor nods. They point to one of the beds. He thanks the doctor, then walks toward the bed.>\n\n\n<On the beds lays Agent Sam Lillon. He is tattered up and hooked to medical equipment. He has his eyes closed. Despite this, he senses Pearce's presence. He opens his eyes, looks at Agent Pearce and smiles. Pearce smiles back.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEARCE:\n Hey, kid.\n\n\nLILLON:\n I never thought I'd see your face through only one set of eyes ever again.\n\n\nPEARCE:\n \n(chuckles)\n You all right?\n\n\nLILLON:\n Yeah.

He takes a stroll down the hallways.>\n\n\n<He arrives at the door to Dr. Tula's laboratory. He contemplates it for a moment, before he decides to enter.>\n\n\n<The laboratory is noticeably more empty than before. All of Dr. Tula's lab equipment has been put into a large cardboard box sitting on the countertop. He eyes the laboratory for a moment.>\n\n\n<On the countertop next to the box sits the engagement ring. He eyes it and fondles it in his hands. Everything is silent for a moment.
