The containment unit is to be monitored by both Type-\u03b1 and Type-\u03b2 personnel. Suppression of records pertaining to incident 4681-\u25bd is to be maintained, with audits performed by operatives embedded in Connecticut police departments. Location-4681-A was purchased in 1981 by Logistics & Acquisitions.\n\n\nType-\u03b1 personnel are not allowed to enter any area designated Type-\u03b2 and vice versa.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4681 is the collective designation of people, places, and anomalous effects surrounding a Temporal Divergence event which occurred at a house in Farmington, CT (designated Location-4681-A) in 1976.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4681-1-\u03b1 is a living human being named Charlotte Roseanne Latozzi (n\u00e9e Ellison), born June 10, 1958 in Manhattan, New York. She is the widow of Joseph Latozzi, who died April 2, 1976.\n\n\nSCP-4681-1-\u03b2 is a living human being named Joseph Alfredo Latozzi, born January 21, 1956 in Manhattan, New York. He is the widower of Charlotte Latozzi, who died April 2, 1976.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Incident 4681-\u25bd, a Class-IO Temporal Divergence event occurred at Location-4681-A. While most class-IO events are retroactively repaired at the end of the event (usually in a matter of seconds) this event became self-sustaining and has remained active ever since. \n(See Incident-4681-\u25bd.)\n This resulted in the creation of two localized timelines: SCP-4681-\u03b1 and SCP-4681-\u03b2.\n\n\nBoth timelines exist simultaneously. When any person first interacts with SCP-4681, their consciousness \"locks\" into a single timeline irreversibly, designating them Type-\u03b1 and Type-\u03b2. Type-\u03b1 people are unable to see, interact, or otherwise perceive the actions of SCP-4681-\u03b2 and vice versa.\n\n\nWhen Type-\u03b1 people attempt to interact with SCP-4681-\u03b2 (or vice versa), minor destabilization events can occur. Often these manifest as rapid deterioration of physical surroundings, perceived changes/distortion in physical space, and episodes of [REDACTED] in the personnel attempting the interaction.\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a04681-\u25bd\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a04681-\u25bd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location of Incident 4681-\u25bd, as of December 1989. Note anomalous deterioration of the assailant's point of entry.\n\n\n\n\nOn April 2, 1976, Charlotte and Joseph Latozzi were staying in a home owned by Mr. Latozzi's paternal grandfather Elmer Latozzi (deceased 1981). At about 2:30 am EST, they were awakened by a noise in the downstairs front room caused by Alfred Brass, a home intruder, who had not expected the house to be occupied. At this point, the Class-IO Temporal divergence occurred, followed by the subsequent events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents of SCP-4681-\u03b1\n\n\nAfter a brief conversation with each other, Mr. Latozzi retrieved a .22 caliber Colt Diamondback revolver registered to Elmer Latozzi from the nightstand and headed downstairs to investigate. Upon encountering the intruder on the main staircase of the house, a physical altercation ensued. Three shots were fired: the first two struck Brass in the torso; the third bullet struck Mr. Latozzi in the left lung and struck the TH3 vertebrae. Mr. Latozzi was knocked over the banister and fell onto the lower-level, landing on his head and neck. Death of both the intruder and Mr. Latozzi is presumed to have occurred within minutes if not instantly.\n\n\nAfter the gunshots were heard, Mrs. Latozzi entered the second floor landing, picking up a silver dish from a hallway table. Upon her discovery of the resulting scene downstairs, she fled to the kitchen and at 2:36 dialed 911. Emergency services arrived at 2:51am and pronounced Mr. Latozzi dead.\n\n\nAt about 3:15am, responding emergency services began arguing about material facts of the scene. According to the official report, during the argument a side table upturned itself in front of several witnesses; the location was evacuated. The officer's radio transmission to dispatch was picked up by Foundation agents monitoring the frequency, and field operatives were dispatched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents of SCP-4681-\u03b2\n\n\nAfter a brief conversation with each other, Mr. and Mrs. Latozzi attempted to get back to sleep. Approximately 10 minutes later, Brass entered the darkened master bedroom on the 2nd floor. His entrance startled Mrs. Latozzi, who reached for a .22 caliber Colt Diamondback revolver registered to Elmer Latozzi which was resting on the nightstand; Brass noticed her movement and grabbed it first, firing two shots in her direction. One shot missed, hitting the far wall; the other entered through the back of her mouth and exited three inches below her left ear. Mr. Latozzi, now awake, attacked the intruder and wrestled the gun from him before firing a single shot into Brass' face, killing him instantly.\n\n\nMr. Latozzi attempted to provide first aid to his wife, picking her up and carrying her down the stairs to the phone. He attempted to dial 911 but the call would not connect. Mrs. Latozzi died of blood loss before emergency services arrived at 2:51am.\n\n\nAt about 3:15am, responding emergency services began arguing about material facts of the scene. According to Mr. Latozzi, none of the responding officers would acknowledge his presence, and only one paramedic on the scene even examined the deceased Mrs. Latozzi. When the paramedic and the officers began to argue, Mr. Latozzi became frustrated and violent, upturning a side table in anger. Emergency services left almost immediately, leaving Mr. Latozzi and the crime scene. Foundation agents arrived shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4681-1\u00a0status,\u00a0January\u00a01985\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4681-1\u00a0status,\u00a0January\u00a01985\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4681-1-\u03b1 maintains an optimistic disposition at present. She has been authorized to access books and news articles via microfiche. Her interests include pencil drawing and astronomy.\n\n\nDue to high levels of compliance she has been moved to a living arrangement with a secured balcony and telescope and has been authorized to receive occasional off-hours tutoring from Dr. Linda Haynes, a Type-\u03b1 Foundation Astronomer. SCP-4681-1-\u03b1 has occasional insomnia and depressive episodes lasting several days. She has a regular appointment with a Type-\u03b1 Foundation psychologist for counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4681-1-\u03b2 is currently held in isolation at Site-\u2588\u2588. He suffers from acute distress unless sedated. SCP-4681-1-\u03b2 reports nightmares of awakening in the dark, buried alive. He often awakens late at night with repeated, shouted apologies.\n\n\nA Type-\u03b2 Foundation psychologist has diagnosed SCP-4681-1-\u03b2 with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Prognosis for recovery is unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0November\u00a01991\n\n\n\n\nUpdate,\u00a0November\u00a01991\n\n\n\n\nFoundation agents were notified of an investigation at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Plainville, CT. The family of one Alfred Brass, the home invader who was killed during Incident 4681-\u25bd, sought authorization from Plainville to disinter the body from their family plot. Upon approval, it was determined that the grave had been disturbed previously, and local law enforcement were dispatched.\n\n\nFoundation agents interviewing local law enforcement determined that approximately half of them saw no evidence of disturbance; the other half concluded from interior damage to the roof of the coffin that the occupant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4680\n | SCP-4681 | \nSCP-4682\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4681\n\" by Sam Swicegood (CityToast), from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
