She sipped the tea, grimacing as she noticed it had cooled.

Containment forces are to be stationed within the city to reduce the expansion effect of the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-6520-A was an extradimensional space located outside baseline temporal reality which intersected with the northeastern portion of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te. The anomaly consisted of approximately 200,000 square meters centered around Parcul Chindia\n1\n, depicted in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6520-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical objects \u2013 including individuals \u2013 that attempted to cross the boundary of SCP-6520-A degraded at an exponentially elevated rate due to increased entropic decay. This boundary was found to be expanding by approximately one meter per hour at all points except SCP-6520-B.\n\n\nSCP-6520-B was a portal from baseline to SCP-6520-A, housed in the Turnul Chindiei\n2\n and was the only known safe entrance to the interior of SCP-6520-A. Entering the tower shifted a subject from baseline reality to the extradimensional space of SCP-6520. While within the anomaly, agents reported a heightened sense of generalized anxiety. No lasting anomalous effects have been observed after an individual exited SCP-6520-B.\n\n\nAbove the crown of the entrance arch was a message painted in human blood, in Daevite script, roughly translated to \u201c\nDo not fear the bloodletting, fear those holding the athame.\n\u201d\n3\n The blood showed no signs of putrescence or dehydration, despite the time having passed since placement.\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-6520-A contained more space than the dimensions of the anomaly would allow and housed numerous stone structures theorized to be a temple complex. These structures were built with stone block and simple mortar, the most recent of which were carbon dated to +/- 300 years prior to the present.\n4\n The structures showed significant degradation inconsistently across the complex \u2013 some of the buildings appeared to be freshly constructed, while others were in ruins.\n\n\nGiven the nature of the message written above the door in SCP-6520-B and the architectural style of those structures, it is theorized that SCP-6520-A represented a timeline in which the fall of the Daevite Empire never occurred.\n\n\nThe anomaly was discovered on 19 September, 1993, when a resident of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te accidentally drove a small sedan through the boundary, leading to the vehicle\u2019s partial dissolution. The driver was not found. Foundation forces were alerted and Director Varga authorized operations in the area, locking down the city and evacuating an area one mile in diameter around SCP-6520-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Hecatoncheires\n Briefing \u2013 Site-91\n\n\n19 September, 1993 \u2013 three hours after discovery\n\n\n\n\nDirector Varga\n: Senior Researcher Jocasta Rossi will have ultimate command on the ground but Captain Rashid al Hasin will have tactical command over MTF and security personnel. Initial reports indicate a new city is overwriting the reality of that portion of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, and represents an alternate reality. \nMr. Euboea\n and his forces will cordon off the area and prevent the anomalous bubble from expanding and further impacting the city. Security forces have already begun evacuation of the city, under cover story of biological weapons.\n\n\nVarga\n: Let\u2019s make this clear. We have no indication what the source of this anomaly is, but if it is an action by the Daevite matriarch\n5\n then we will capture and take her into containment.\n\n\nAgent Rebekah Douglas\n: And that\u2019s enough for you? This is the \nsecond attempt to rewrite reality\n in two weeks.\n\n\nVarga\n: Neutralization is not an option unless I give the green light. She is a resource of untold historical and biological data. We are the Secure Contain Protect Foundation. We are not in the business of justice or vengeance. That\u2019s an order, Agent.\n\n\nCaptain al Hasin\n: Excuse me, Director, but can we trust the anomaly?\n\n\nVarga\n: You mean Euboea?\n6\n No, you can\u2019t. But we\u2019ve reached an agreement with his organization and for the moment, we want the same thing. The Matriarch is an active threat to his existence. This is a trial run, we evaluate his effectiveness in the field. Any other questions?\n\n\n[No other members of the meeting raise their hand.]\n\n\nVarga\n: Right. Get out there, and let\u2019s contain this anomaly. I grew up in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, and I\u2019ll be damned if it\u2019s erased from the face of the Earth.\n\n\n\n\nInitial reconnaissance of the area within SCP-6520-A revealed signs of recent habitation: meals abandoned in course of consumption, writing instruments left atop vellum mid-sentence, etc. No living entities were observed within the anomalous space.\n\n\nAfter MTF Beta-777 (\u201cHecate's Spear\u201d) secured the area and performed a structure-by-structure sweep, Euboea and \nhis acolytes\n attempted to utilize thaumaturgy to reverse the expansion of the anomalous boundary. Their attempts were only partially successful, resulting in a slowing of expansion but not complete remission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation of SCP-6520-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n: 19/09/1993 @ 11:00 local time.\n\n\nPersonnel present\n: \nDr. Jocasta Rossi\n, \nAgent Rebekah Douglas\n, \nMTF Beta-777 Sergeant Maria Waltham\n\n\n\n\n[Rossi, Douglas and Waltham enter the tower containing SCP-6520-B. Douglas stares up at the message written above the doorway. She drags a chair over and stands atop it, placing her hand on the message.]\n\n\nRossi\n: Get down from there!\n\n\nDouglas\n: Give me a second.\n\n\nRossi\n: We don\u2019t know what countermeasures or anomalous effects were used in that message.\n\n\n[Douglas closes her eyes for a moment and then pulls her hand away, wiping the blood from her palm on the wall.]\n7\n\n\nDouglas\n: She did this.\n\n\nWaltham\n: The Matriarch?\n\n\nDouglas\n: Yes. Within the day at most.\n\n\nRossi\n: Then that\u2019s confirmation of her involvement, good. But you\u2019re on thin ice, Agent. From here on out, you listen to orders, or I will send you home.\n\n\nDouglas\n: Understood.\n\n\n[The three pass through the tower and emerge into SCP-6520-A proper. The sunlight is a different tone from outside the dome, roughly consistent with sunset. The tower exits onto a small plaza surrounded by various temple buildings made of stone. There is a small ziggurat and a domed building, with several other nondescript structures. In the center of the plaza is a fountain ringed by fig trees. The fountain\u2019s statue is made in the likeness of a woman in flowing robes holding a stone knife to the sky.]\n\n\n[Rossi walks to the ziggurat and begins climbing the steps. The others follow. The structure rises fifteen meters from the ground and is topped with a stone sacrificial table, with furrows carved in its surface. An obsidian athame, intricately dressed in gold and silver at the hilt and wrapped in leather lies on the surface of the table. Fresh blood covers the knife and table, but no cadaver is present.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: Where is everyone?\n\n\nRossi\n: No idea, this all feels unfinished.\n\n\nDouglas\n: What do you mean?\n\n\nRossi\n: Some of the buildings are rotting, some are brand new. There\u2019s evidence of people everywhere, but no actual people present.\n\n\nWaltham\n: What are you suggesting?\n\n\nRossi\n: This is a ontokinetic anomaly, right? It\u2019s rewriting reality and trying to establish an alternative timeline like \nSCP-140\n does. But it\u2019s crumbling.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Like with the \nother ritual\n?\n\n\nRossi\n: Right. Something interfered. Or the ritual failed somehow. Maybe.\n\n\n[Douglas approaches the stone table.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: \n[To Waltham]\n Do you feel that?\n\n\nRossi\n: Reports are consistent with heightened anxiety.\n\n\nDouglas\n: Not that.\n\n\nWaltham\n: What are you feeling?\n\n\nDouglas\n: A pressure. Getting worse the further in we go. She left this for us.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Why?\n\n\n[Douglas shakes her head. She reaches down and touches the blood.]\n\n\nRossi\n: Goddamnit, Douglas.\n\n\n[Douglas recoils almost immediately, and retches. Waltham catches her and supports her weight.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: It\u2019s nothing.\n\n\nRossi\n: What do you mean?\n\n\nDouglas\n: No one is holding the knife, no one is being cut on. But there\u2019s still blood.\n\n\nRossi\n: Unfinished.\n\n\nDouglas\n: She\u2019s here somewhere.\n\n\nRossi\n: Let\u2019s move on.\n\n\n[Douglas moves to follow the other two down the steps but then turns and picks up the athame, slipping it into her back pocket.]\n\n\n[The three progress through the complex, moving north away from the domed structure and approaching a wide open plaza with hundreds of wooden poles with a horizontal bar attached at each skyward point. Each cross bar has a human cadaver strapped to it by the wrists. The cadavers are in various stages of decay.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: Guess we found the residents.\n\n\nRossi\n: No, I don\u2019t think so. Some of these are recent, but most have been hanging for a while. But I don\u2019t understand the significance.\n\n\nWaltham\n: They\u2019re like sky burials.\n\n\n[Rossi nods. Douglas looks around at the bodies.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: Sorry? Help me out here.\n\n\nRossi\n: Sky burial is a Western colloquial term for a form of excarnation, where the deceased is left out in the elements to decompose and be eaten by scavenging animals. Some forms of Buddhism and Hinduism practice this, as the body is nothing to be preserved \u2013 because the physical existence is transitory. But this, feels wrong.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Why?\n\n\nRossi\n: The \nDaevite religion\n is almost completely oppositional to the tenets of Buddhism. The Daevites revered the physical plane. Life was everything to them. We\u2019ve never found any conceptual evidence of an afterlife in their religion. Everything was about the now, the life on Earth. It's where the blood and the horticulture overlap.\n\n\nDouglas\n: Right, I was reading about this, they worship something called the Font.\n\n\nRossi\n: The source of life. But that\u2019s what I mean, why do this to the bodies if they don\u2019t even believe in the spirit? Life was anything but transitory to the Daeva.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Maybe these aren\u2019t Daevites.\n\n\n[Douglas leans in close to one of the corpses.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: Is it just me, or are some of these in MTF tactical gear?\n\n\n[Waltham and Rossi look around. Waltham nods.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: Heavily degraded but definitely tactical gear.\n\n\nDouglas\n: Fuck.\n\n\nRossi\n: What?\n\n\nDouglas\n: For a second, I thought\u2026\n\n\n[Douglas is staring at a female corpse, only partially decomposed.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: It almost looks like Captain Zadeh.\n\n\nRossi\n: It can\u2019t be.\n\n\nWaltham\n: It isn\u2019t. This place is just messing with us.\n\n\nDouglas\n: This place or someone?\n\n\nDr. Rossi\n: Let\u2019s keep moving.\n\n\n[Douglas stares at the hanging corpse for a few minutes, then turns to follow the other two.]\n\n\n[Dr. Rossi approaches the domed temple building visible across the square from the ziggurat, stopping on the threshold to look up at the arched doorway. Waltham slips past to clear the area within the temple.]\n\n\nDouglas:\n So, if the pyramid is for sacrifices, what\u2019s this for?\n\n\n[Rossi shrugs and walks into the temple. Inside is a large chamber housing a fountain built into one wall. The fountain is six meters tall and features a woman holding a knife and a sapling.]\n\n\n[Douglas runs a hand under the water pouring from a spout at the woman\u2019s feet, flowing into a large basin forming the base.]\n\n\nDouglas:\n You\u2019d think they\u2019d use blood.\n\n\nRossi\n: They worshipped life. Blood and water both represent life.\n\n\n[Waltham walks back into the chamber, slipping her carbine\u2019s strap over her shoulder.]\n\n\nWaltham:\n Structure\u2019s clear.\n\n\n[Both Rossi and Douglas still look towards the fountain. Waltham circles the room and stops suddenly.]\n\n\nWaltham\n What the fuck?\n\n\nRossi:\n What is it?\n\n\n[Waltham points at the curved walls circling the chamber. Frescos adorn the wall. \nA tower surrounded by mist\n with hundreds of humanoid entities made of plants and mud, massed to attack. \nA battlefield\n with a ruined temple in a desert. \nA ruin\n on a grass plane. \nA warehouse\n surrounded by the same humanoid entities.]\n\n\nDouglas\n: Wait\u2026is this?\n\n\n[Waltham nods. She begins taking pictures of the frescos.]\n\n\nRossi:\n These are all missions Beta-777 has been involved in.\n\n\nWaltham:\n \n[Pointing at the humanoids.]\n Missions we ran against the Daeva. Even if we didn\u2019t know it at first.\n\n\nRossi:\n What is this?\n\n\nDouglas\n: It\u2019s a honey trap.\n\n\nRossi\n: Then what\u2019s th\u2013\n\n\n[An explosion to the west interrupts Rossi. The radio begins transmitting.]\n\n\nCaptain al Hasin\n: \n[Transmitting]\n This is a mandatory evacuation order for all Foundation personnel within the anomaly. This means you, Dr. Rossi.\n\n\nRossi\n: What\u2019s happening?\n\n\nal Hasin\n: We\u2019re being attacked. Now move!\n\n\n[All three rush back towards the entrance of the anomaly, where Captain al Hasin and a squad of MTF Beta-777 are defending the tower against a wave of humanoid entities carrying stone knives and axes. The entities are naked but clearly anomalous, made of fibrous material and mud.]\n\n\n[Euboea wades into the stream of entities, ripping an axe from one of the humanoids and beginning to swing in wide arcs. Within moments, dozens of the humanoids are cut in two or sent flying. But for every figure that is downed, ten more fill the space. One of Euboea\u2019s acolytes moves the crowd back with a wall of force, his palms stretched outward and his arms shaking.]\n\n\nEuboea\n: Too many! Get back!\n\n\n[A stream of entities cuts off Rossi\u2019s group from the tower. Waltham and Douglas begin firing their firearms into the crowd.]\n\n\n[Euboea raises his hand and those entities near Rossi, Douglas and Waltham ignite. The flames flow around the three, staying a few feet away from them, but the heat makes them cringe back.]\n\n\n[Another of Euboea\u2019s acolytes holds out their hands and creates a barrier to either side of Rossi\u2019s group, allowing Rossi and Waltham to rejoin the Foundation forces defending the tower. al Hasin fires his carbine into an entity that approaches the line of MTF agents, then lowers his rifle.]\n\n\nal Hasin\n: Time to go doctor!\n\n\nRossi\n: We\u2019ve barely started cataloguing the anomaly!\n\n\nal Hasin\n: Doesn\u2019t matter, we can\u2019t hold here.\n\n\n[Rossi turns towards the approaching entities. Several hundred are visible rushing towards the tower.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: Where\u2019s Douglas?\n\n\n[Rossi scans her eyes over the square flooding with entities.]\n\n\nRossi\n: I can\u2019t see her.\n\n\nal Hasin\n: She\u2019s either down or off doing her own thing like she always does. Time to go!\n\n\nWaltham\n: No, we need to find her.\n\n\nal Hasin\n: Sergeant, Agent Douglas is unreliable. This \nwouldn\u2019t even be the first time she has gone off mission during an assault\n! We\u2019re leaving.\n\n\n[Rossi continues to stare at the approaching crowd of entities.]\n\n\nal Hasin\n: Okay, through the tower, now!\n\n\n[al Hasin starts dragging Rossi into the tower. MTF forces continue firing into the crowd while retreating. Euboea\u2019s acolytes bring up the rear, creating a dome of shimmering energy holding the masses of entities back as the Foundation personnel retreat.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6520-A\u2019s anomalous field faltered and then faded away within moments of the Foundation personnel retreating through the tower. Over the next fifteen minutes, the structures within the anomaly faded and were overwritten by baseline reality revealing the park as it existed prior to the anomaly\u2019s discovery.\n\n\nAgent Douglas\u2019 body camera was discovered on the roof of Turnul Chindiei during mop up operations.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0File\u00a0restricted\u00a0to\u00a0Alpha-4\u00a0level\u00a0clearance\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Director\u2019s\u00a0Eyes\u00a0Only\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Security\u00a0Verified\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered Footage dated 19/09/1993\n\n\n\n\n[The view from the camera is partially obscured but shows Douglas being carried roughly 1.5 meters above the ground, ascending a circular stone stair for approximately two minutes. Explosions and live fire can be heard, muffled as if through walls. The view upturns and then rights itself as a pair of humanoid hands covered in moss and mud straighten Douglas\u2019 shoulders as she leans against something. The camera does not move for nearly a minute, while further explosions and gunfire can be heard louder than before. The camera is pointed at the parapet of the roof of the Turnul Chindiei. Smoke is visibly rising from the ground as the conflict escalates below.]\n\n\n[A desiccated human female figure appears on camera, dressed in a red robe and wearing a bronze crown. The figure leans over the parapet, looking down, scoffs, and then turns back towards the camera and Douglas.]\n\n\nDaeva Matriarch:\n You\u2019re the one who shot me in Mongolia, right? I thought I recognized you.\n\n\n[Another explosion roars below and the Matriarch glances back over the parapet.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: You weren\u2019t really who I was looking to reel in. But, I know you\u2019re his favorite little mouse.\n\n\n[She approaches Douglas and bends down to look at her face to face. Her skin is pulled tight against her skull \u2013 graying, emaciated and cracked.]\n\n\n[Another explosion goes off, followed by more gunfire.]\n\n\nMatriarch:\n What did you think you were walking into, mouse? Did you think I drew up a forgotten homeland, and so poorly as to not bring any souls with it?\n\n\n[The Matriarch slaps Douglas across the face, jostling the camera a little. She turns and leans over the parapet.]\n\n\nMatriarch:\n I know, you can\u2019t move, it\u2019s for the best. You\u2019re the bait now. \n[Sighs]\n I have no one to talk to about any of this now, with Leonid gone. I was never much for military tactics, that\u2019s what the Russian was for. But then you had to kill him. Your company of fools hounding me, and now you\u2019ve joined with the slug-god\u2019s minion. Mongolia, Greece, Russia. You\u2019re like ants.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to watch your whole society crumble? To watch some \nthing\n come down from the sky and vaporize all you\u2019ve tried to build back up? The slaves revolted and we lost so much, but I was trying to hold what we had together. And then it came, with its \u201cson.\u201d Just two beings reduced my army to ashes. Ten thousand kubikir, another five thousand slave warriors, endless grass children. All gone. I think they must have thought me broken, leaving me alive that day. So I hid, down the centuries, constantly crawling towards you. Never waking until Leonid found me.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: I\u2019m the last, so far as I know. All I want is for my people to survive, not bound up in the dust. Is that so much to ask for? What would you do if your people were gone and you could bring them back? Would you let field mice scare you away, just because they invented guns and explosives in the time you slept?\n\n\n[She shakes her head as she looks down on the skirmish below.]\n\n\nMatriarch:\n Look at them. Hundreds of my grass children, and your soldiers haven\u2019t had a single casualty. And where did he go? I swear I just saw him down there. All his little hybrids running around down there with your soldiers and he\u2019s nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n[The Matriarch approaches Douglas again, crouching down in front of her. The video footage begins to distort for a few seconds, leaving an oil slick effect on the footage from this point onwards.]\n\n\nMatriarch:\n Time to cut my losses, this was never going to work. It was worth a try, but at least it\u2019s not a complete waste.\n\n\n[The Matriarch reaches for a stone dagger in a leather sheath on her belt. As she pulls the knife free, Douglas lurches forward and stabs the athame into the Matriarch\u2019s side, just below the ribs. The blade comes away slick with viscous brown fluid. She quickly punches the blade into the Matriarch\u2019s side four more times. The Matriarch screams and pushes away. Douglas slumps over, weakly trying to right herself.]\n\n\n[The Matriarch holds a hand to the wounds in her torso, bent over with pain.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: You hurt me, mouse. How did you do that? How are you even moving?\n\n\nDouglas:\n \nRip your throat out\u2026\n\n\n[The Matriarch stops moving and stares at Douglas with narrowed eyes.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: What are you?\n\n\nDouglas:\n \nGonna eat your heart, you bitch.\n\n\n[The Matriarch backs away from Douglas and slides the knife back into its sheath. Douglas is still trying to clamber to an upright position. She has not let go of the athame.]\n\n\n[The Matriarch turns and walks off camera. The sound of footsteps receding is heard over Douglas\u2019 tortured breathing.]\n\n\nDouglas:\n \nCome back\u2026\n\n\n[Douglas slips and lands on her side, her breathing ragged. The oil slick effect to the footage dissolves, and for a few moments the camera is shaking with Douglas\u2019 breathing. Distant gunfire is heard below as the dome of unreality begins to shrink against the sky and skyline of temples within SCP-6520. A figure steps into view and lifts Douglas to an upright position. She tries to stab with the athame, but her arms are quickly pinned to her side.]\n\n\nEuboea\n: Relax, I\u2019ve got you.\n\n\n[He grasps the body camera and throws it to the ground. Euboea picks Agent Douglas up and puts her over his shoulder, sliding the wet athame into his belt, and walks off camera. The anomalous effect continues to shrink until the skyline vanishes and baseline reality is restored.]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\nAt time of writing, Agent Douglas has not been recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIona closed the file and pushed it away from her across the desk. Julie popped her head into the office.\n\n\n\u201cYou want another cup of tea, Director?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take some slivovitz, if you have some.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have no idea what that is.\u201d\n\n\nIona laughed, stood up and walked to a bookshelf next to the desk. She took down a bottle nestled in amongst the books, along with two shot glasses. She put them down on the desk and poured one for each of them. Julie picked hers up and held it to the light, letting the amber color shine.\n\n\n\u201cAnd what is it that I\u2019m about to drink?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlum brandy, from home. I had Dr. Rossi pick me up a bottle after the operation.\u201d\n\n\nThey each held their glass up and clinked them together.\n\n\n\u201cSo, what are you going to tell Rossi?\u201d\n\n\nIona took the file up in her hands, binding it closed with a strap and a small combination lock. She opened her safe and slipped the file inside.\n\n\n\u201cTo forget she was ever in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te.\u201d\n\n\nJulie sipped on her brandy.\n\n\n\u201cNoroc,\u201d Iona said, and then downed the shot.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+56\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHecatoncheires Cycle\n\n\n<< SCP-5626: The Far Shore\n | \nSCP-6520: Director's Eyes Only\n | \nSCP-7812: Archon >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6520\n\" by Grigori Karpin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
