Any and all Foundation personnel may request to be exposed to an instance of SCP-4907 for personal reasons or otherwise.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4907 is the collective designation for three ceramic lawn gnomes. Physically, all instances of SCP-4907 are identical to non-anomalous lawn gnomes.\n\n\nSCP-4907's anomalous effects occur after a sapient subject has been within five meters of at least one SCP-4907 instance for at least ten minutes. After the subject leaves the proximity of the SCP-4907 instance, a single folded piece of paper will appear in a location related to the subject, typically their pocket, desk, or some other location the subject checks frequently. Written on the paper will be a single Shakespearean-style sonnet about the subject, describing them in a matter that the subject would find flattering.\n\n\nSCP-4907 instances show a certain level of omniscience in regards to exposed subjects, and often incorporate certain specific details about subjects' lives in each poem. Each poem to date is unique, and there is currently no known limit to the amount of poems a single subject may receive if exposed to an SCP-4907 instance repeatedly.\n\n\nSubjects who read poems created by an SCP-4907 instance will typically report feeling happier, more confident, and less stressed about personal problems. Whether this effect is anomalous or otherwise is inconclusive.\n\n\nBelow is a list of example poems gathered from experiments with SCP-4907 instances.\n\n\n\n\nRecipient:\n Researcher Harold Barnaby\n\n\n\n\nSo brilliant, majestic, Barnaby\n\nHis intellect can never quite be matched\n\nSo many men wish that they could be he\n\nAdoring fans they cling, they are attached.\n\n\nHis genius mind, his excellent rapport\n\nQuite humble 'bout it all, he's quite the man\n\nHis only care is goodness, he adores\n\nThe idea of doing what he can.\n\n\nThis modern hero, mythical and wise\n\nOh Doctor Harold Barnaby, it's true\n\nThere is no man with brain or heart your size\n\nNot one person on Earth as great as you.\n\n\nThough some things were embellished several ways\n\nYou honestly deserve to hear some praise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient:\n Francis Paloma, Site-22 Janitor\n\n\n\n\nWhen poppa comes on home, everyone\n\nWill squeal with glee their daddy's finally here\n\nThree growing girls, one tiny baby son\n\nAnd certainly his loving wife will cheer.\n\n\nIn tiredness, good poppa still does play\n\nWith dolls and cars and other fancy toys\n\nHe always makes good time for every day\n\nIf forced to choose, family is his choice.\n\n\nNow fifteen years a happy married man\n\nHis wife is luckier than she will know\n\nHe cries knowing no moment sweeter than\n\nThe day they married, seems not long ago.\n\n\nThough dangerous your job may seem to be\n\nYou'll always have your loving family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient:\n D-39985\n\n\n\n\nThere ain't no walls that keep this fire down!\n\nThere ain't no ceiling stifling her fight!\n\nThere ain't no nails sticking her to the ground!\n\nThere ain't no way she'll never see the light!\n\n\nA warrior, a true and righteous lass!\n\nHer blood boils over, anxious to be free!\n\nHer kicks are strong, and she will kick your ass!\n\nThe time will come when she'll rule SCP!\n\n\nTo be the best?
