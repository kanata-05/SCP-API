Read with caution.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B are to be stored in a standard anomalous item storage locker at Site-81. Physical interaction with either instance by research staff who are involved in romantic affairs, or who have previously been involved in romantic affairs that have ended within thirty days prior to experimentation, is strictly prohibited. Further containment procedures have been deemed unnecessary at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph of SCP-7818-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7818 is the collective designation for two identical antique lockets composed of silver, further categorized as SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B. Each locket is embossed with an intricate design depicting interwoven vines and flowers in 14\nth\n century European Gothic-era patterns. The lockets are heart-shaped and there is a small pocket within each intended to hold photographs.\n\n\nWhen SCP-7818 is worn by an individual who shares a deep\n1\n romantic connection with another individual who is wearing SCP-7818-B, SCP-7818\u2019s anomalous effect manifests.\n\n\nSCP-7818 drastically enhances the physical and mental affection, intimacy, and emotional resonance between the individuals under its anomalous effect, causing an intensified romantic experience between them. Wearing SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B for an extended period of time will invariably cause one of the affected\n2\n to slowly dissipate from baseline reality and conceptual spacetime.\n\n\nThe intensity of this effect and the rate of dissipation is directly correlated to the emotional strength of the established bond between wearers; the stronger the emotional connection, the faster the dissipation. Initially, subtle signs of the erasure event manifest, such as affected individuals disappearing from photographs, before more notable effects manifest such as the individual's parents forgetting they concieved the affected.\n\n\nThe only aspect of the lost individual that remains unaffected by SCP-7818 is the content SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B. It is unclear why the content of SCP-7818-A or SCP-7818-B remain unaffected by SCP-7818. It is unclear what happens to individuals who are removed from baseline reality by SCP-7818. Efforts to locate these individuals have remained inconclusive.\n\n\nCurrently, the photograph contained within both SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B depicts Researcher Katherine Varga holding a female woman in a loving embrace. The identity of the second woman cannot be discerned, and Researcher Varga has no recollection of meeting or conversing with the woman in the photograph.\n\n\n\n\nThe following was recovered from Katherine Varga\u2019s apartment on May\n\n\n\n\nDear \n\u3164\u3164a\u3164\u3164 \u3164o\u3164\u3164\u3164\n,\n\n\n \n\nSince it\u2019s our anniversary I figured I would get us something nice. You always said we should get matching lockets, so I thought this would be the perfect gift! I love you so much, so I figured the engraving on it was more than accurate. I already put the pictures in.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m really sorry I couldn\u2019t give this to you in person. You know how work can be, especially when you get called in and can\u2019t say no. But when I get back, you better believe I\u2019ll make the best dinner for you ever. No spoilers, but you will absolutely die for it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBack soon,\n\nKatherine Varga.\n\n\n\n\n(P.S.

Who\u2019s this?\n\n\nm a H th\n :\n Uh\u2026 It\u2019s me\u2026 \nm a\n . I\u2019m your daughter?\n\n\nLindsey Hawthorn:\n Is this a scam?

The photos on my phone, they've all disappeared, her phone number wasn't assigned. I looked everywhere for any leads; Nothing, she was gone without a trace. I updated the description of the anomaly accordingly to reflect this. I will get to the bottom of this if it's the last thing I ever do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Transcript\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-05-23T06:35:00-06:00\n\n\nSubjects\n: Katherine Varga.\n\n\nForeword:\n The following is a transcript of a missing persons report filed by Researcher Katherine Varga and intercepted by MTF-Omega 24.\n\n\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n Hello?\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Hello, this is the Austin Police Department, what can I help you with today?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n I-I\u2019m calling to submit a missing person.\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Has it been over 24 hours since you have last seen them?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n No\u2026 But I know it doesn\u2019t have to be. I know the rules. Please, I need to report her missing. Her name is \nE\u3164m\u3164 \u3164\u3164w\u3164h\u3164rn\n, she\u2019s 5 foot 2 inches, shoulder length brown hair, and blue eyes. She\u2019s 28 years old, and white. She has a pink jacket that she wears often and it\u2019s not in my house anymore\u2026\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Do you have any photos of her?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n I don\u2019t anymore. She disappeared from all of the photos just like she disappeared this morning. I mean I have this locket but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t part with it.\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Okay. Is there any chance she\u2019s at work?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n No. Her number disappeared from my phone and then when I call her number I got an automated voice saying the number is no longer in service\u2026 She doesn\u2019t work anymore\u2026 She couldn\u2019t.\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Alright. I am going to send this off and have a unit go to you. Where do you live?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n 272 Thrash Trail, Apartment 404. Thank you.\n\n\nJason Taieo:\n Is there anything else you need?\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n No\u2026\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n The case was thrown out by the Austin Police Department shortly after the call, as there was no evidence or records on \nE\u3164m\u3164 \u3164\u3164w\u3164h\u3164rn\n and her existence. APD followed up with a wellness check on Katherine Varga, but it ultimately ended with no further action taken. Case was closed on May 25th 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 02:\n When I updated the file with the pertinent information, I apparently raised some eyebrows at RAISA. They don't remember me ever having a partner, much less one that worked for the foundation, and the people who knew I had filed the document said they hadn't ever read it. I really had to fight for them to take me seriously. They're suggesting that she never existed, that I made her up in my mind, via anomalous means or otherwise, but that cannot be true. This document is the only proof of her so I need to maintain it to the best of my ability. I've dedicated my life to her, she dedicated her life to me, I promised I would always be by her side, that I would always be there for her, and that I wouldn't forget.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 03:\n It\u2019s just now I was looking at the file, and all mentions of her name had disappeared and I had to replace them like I had before. That's when I realized, I had forgotten her name. I don't remember any party. What party? What is happening!? This cannot be happening. I'm trying everything I can, I'm her last hope. I promised I would fix this, she means everything. I can't forget there has to be something I can do. I can fix this, I can do this. I will get her back.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 03:\n My locket still has her picture in it. Those stupid lockets we got like a month ago symbolize our love. Hers, the ones with my picture in it, are gone. Every other picture of her disappeared without a trace, but the other side with her picture on it is in my hand right now. I already updated the file to reflect this. This is huge, I finally have a lead. This could be it. This could be why my darling is gone. What\u2026whatever her name was. Please please don't let me forget now. There's no one else, everyone has forgotten, I am so close, I can't give up now, I can't forget. I promised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log Transcript\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-05-20T09:45:00-06:00\n\n\nSubjects\n: Katherine Varga.\n\n\nForeword\n \nThe following transcript is an amendment to 7818.

Please forgive me. I don\u2019t even know your name anymore, but please, babe, please forgive me.\n\n\n(She closes the locket, holding it in her hands clasped together, putting them up to her face as though she were praying.)\n\n\nKatherine Varga:\n I\u2019m sorry babe\u2026 Please come back.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n(Researcher Katherine Varga then spent approximately four hours staring at the wall and at the picture in the locket.
