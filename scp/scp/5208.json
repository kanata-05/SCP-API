SCP-5208-1 is available for testing to Thaumaturge Division personnel with Level 3/5208 Clearance or higher.\n\n\nAll members of the Site-51 Thaumaturgy Division are to consume no less than 45 grams of Kellogg's cornflakes daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5208-\u03a9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5208 is the collective designation given to a series of events and anomalies related to SCP-5208-\u03a9, an Abrahamic-Thaumaturge and scientist by the name of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852 \u2013 1943). SCP-5208-\u03a9 was a member of a secret esoteric suborder of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, known as the Knights of the Seventh Day (GOI-5208SD), a group tasked with using anomalous means to covertly promote the church's beliefs. SCP-5208-\u03a9's efforts to eliminate humanity's \"sinful vices\" emphasized sexual behavior, specifically masturbation. These efforts lead to the creation of SCP-5208-1, SCP-5208-2, and SCP-5208-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5208-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5208-1 is a 1.5-meter wooden staff featuring a crucifix, used as a conduit for thaumaturgic rituals designed by SCP-5208-\u03a9. Testing revealed that SCP-5208-1, in combination with specific verbal incantations, amplifies its user's thaumaturgic abilities. Analysis revealed SCP-5208-1 to be composed of Mauritian ebony (\nDiospyros tessellaria\n) treated with a mixture of ammonia and human blood later confirmed to belong to SCP-5208-\u03a9. SCP-5208-1 was used by SCP-5208-\u03a9 during the creation of the SCP-5208-2 instances.\n\nSCP-5208-2 are a species of non-corporeal humanoid Null-Class Demonic Entities\n1\n capable of parasitic propagation through human hosts. Instances of SCP-5208-2 display only rudimentary instinctual behavior, such as survival and procreation. Human individuals within a 3-meter radius of SCP-5208-2 will begin showing signs of increased libido; this effect increases as the distance decreases. Within 1 meter the effect of SCP-5208-2 begins showing one or more of the following symptoms:\n\n\n\n\nHyperarousal\n\n\nVascular engorgement of the genitals\n\n\nErection of the penis or mammary papilla\n\n\nSpontaneous ejaculation\n\n\nUncontrollable masturbation\n2\n\n\nHeterosexual and homosexual intercourse\n3\n\n\nVoraphilic and necrophillic behavior\n\n\n\n\nOf these symptoms, uncontrollable masturbation is the most common, with more diverse symptoms manifesting with an increased presence of SCP-5208-2 instances. Prolonged exposure of a non-anomalous human to SCP-5208-2 instances causes a new SCP-5208-2 instance to manifest within the exposed person. After vomiting these new instances, the human hosts have an approximately 22% chance of developing long-term chronic exposure symptoms. SCP-5208-2 show an aversion to human subjects who have consumed a full serving of Kellogg's Corn Flakes with a 24-hour period before exposure. This aversion can be overcome when multiple SCP-5208-2 instances are present.\n\n\nSCP-5208-\u03a9 used SCP-5208-1 and at least 50 SCP-5208-2 instances to enact a combinatorial process that manifested a new entity. This new entity, designated SCP-5208-3, is a Princeps-Class Demonic Entity\n4\n claiming the name Asmodeus. Measuring approximately 4 meters tall, SCP-5208-3 has a vaguely humanoid body consisting of a black viscous liquid of unidentifiable composition. SCP-5208-3 has been observed to be capable of speech, teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and the creation of new SCP-5208-2 instances\n5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Keith Kellogg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n \n\nSCP-5208 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on 1927/2/23, by SCP-5208-\u03a9's biological brother and business partner, Will Keith Kellogg (1860 \u2013 1951). SCP-5208-\u03a9 and Mr. Kellogg directed the Battle Creek Sanitarium\n6\n from 1876 to 1943; SCP-5208-\u03a9 focused on his duties as a member of the GOI-5208SD and Mr. Kellogg directed the Sanitarium's superficial operations. Mr. Kellogg contacted the Foundation through their mutual acquaintance, \nAsa Candler\n, and a meeting was organized between Mr. Kellogg and Foundation Investigative Agent James Mueller.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0SCP-5208\u00a0Interview\u00a01\u00a0|\u00a0Will\u00a0Kellogg\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Interview\u00a01\u00a0|\u00a0SCP-5208/A-1\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 1927/2/23\n\n\nInterviewer:\n FIA James Mueller\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Will Keith Kellogg\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nMueller:\n Mr. Kellogg, are you ready to begin?\n\n\nKellogg:\n \nRemains silent.\n\n\nMueller:\n Is there an issue, sir?\n\n\nKellogg:\n I was told your organization practices discretion; I can't afford to be connected to this.\n\n\nMueller:\n Ah yes, rest assured this recording is for our records and nothing else.\n\n\nKellogg:\n I suppose that's okay, if you insist.\n\n\nMueller:\n Now, why have you called this meeting Mr. Kellogg? Mr. Candler spoke of an imminent threat.\n\n\nKellogg:\n It's my brother. I fear he is in over his head.\n\n\nMueller:\n You're going to need to be more specific, Mr. Kellogg.\n\n\nKellogg:\n My brother is Dr. John Kellogg, he is the Director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. He's been secretly working for a group called the Knights of the Seventh Day. He has been for a long time now, but things are different. He's changed.\n\n\nMueller:\n We have been investigating the organization for some time now. What\u2013\n\n\nKellogg:\n He's not a bad man. They're trying to do good, I know they are. But this work, those cursed texts have corrupted him. He's blinded by devotion; he can't even see it all unraveling around him.\n\n\nMueller:\n What exactly is your brother's connection with this organization?\n\n\nKellogg:\n His position is known as a Knight Commander, one of seven as I understood it. He has been tasked with the elimination of the sin of lust.\n\n\nMueller:\n As a concept?\n\n\nKellogg:\n As if I would know\u2013 I thought it was just a fraternity when I first learned of it years ago. It wasn't until the weird experiments started that I really saw they were doing. Magic, not your Houdini type magic mind you, but real magic. The last few years though\u2026he's changed. He filled an entire wing at Battle Creek with victims of whatever is going on.\n\n\nMueller:\n Does your brother know of your\u2026 \"concerns\"?\n\n\nKellogg:\n He won't listen to me. I could only imagine what he would do if he found out I've come to you for help.\n\n\nMueller:\n I understand, Mr. Kellogg. So, what exactly have you called this meeting to accomplish?\n\n\nKellogg:\n I don't want my brother getting hurt, not by you and certainly not by whatever he's gotten himself wrapped up in. I don't understand the esoteric ways of my brother, I never have\u2013 but your organization does, or so I have been told.\n\n\nMueller:\n What exactly do you fear will happen to your brother?\n\n\nKellogg:\n The Church is demanding results; they think he's lost control of the situation and wants to see it rectified. I know my brother is planning something big and I just don't want anything happening to him. He's lost his way\u2013 I just want him guided back.\n\n\nMueller:\n I see. Mr. Kellogg, if you'll give me a moment I need to speak with my supervisor.\n\n\nKellogg:\n Will you help him? I'm willing to pay, money is not a\u2013\n\n\nMueller:\n Do not worry about a thing, we'll handle it from here.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Will Kellogg was released under the condition that he assist the Foundation in containing SCP-5208. Following approval, a full-scale investigation of John Kellogg, Battle Creek Sanitarium, and the Knights of the Seventh Day was initiated.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Interview\u00a01\u00a0|\u00a0SCP-5208/A-1\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattle Creek Sanitarium, circa 1927.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect investigations into GOI-5208SD were successfully hindered by the effort of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church.

Amongst the survivors both SCP-5208-\u03a9 and Mr. Kellogg survived, with SCP-5208-\u03a9 sustaining irreparable brain damage during the event. MSF Zulu-1 was able to recover Captain Vanholt, Agent Fettle, SCP-5208-1, and several documents relating to GOI-5208SD\n9\n.

All public information pertaining to SCP-5208-\u03a9's involvement with GOI-5208SD was destroyed or confiscated. In return, Mr. Kellogg transferred a 10% holding of The Kellogg Company to the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
