One year after Incident 3637-A, SCP-3637 was fully excavated and transferred to a museum operated by a Foundation front.\n\n\n\n\nArchived\u00a0Special\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted.\n\n\n\n\nThe area within a one-kilometer radius of SCP-3637 is to be surrounded by an 8-meter-high barrier, with guards posted every 200 meters. If SCP-3637-1 attempts to breach the barrier, it is to be deterred using high-pressure water hoses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3637 is a fossilized \nMaiasaura\n skeleton excavated 8\u00a0km east of Bynum, Montana during a paleontological dig. Upon initial excavation of SCP-3637, a loud roar was heard by the paleontology team, with no apparent source.\n\n\nSCP-3637 will undergo a single 3637-Ramah event every time a thunderstorm forms or passes directly over SCP-3637.\n\n\nDuring a 3637-Ramah event, wind speeds in the vicinity of SCP-3637 will increase to around 140 kph, a loud roar will be heard, and salt crystals within a 119\u00a0m radius of SCP-3637 will be drawn towards it and cover it completely. A lightning bolt will then strike SCP-3637 directly (SCP-3637 is undamaged by this), and the salt crystals will coalesce into the form of an adult \nMaiasaura\n skeleton, hereafter designated SCP-3637-1. SCP-3637-1 will then extricate itself from SCP-3637, and walk away. Wind speeds will return to normal, concluding the 3637-Ramah event.\n\n\nSCP-3637-1 tends to wander aimlessly, occasionally vocalizing and digging into the ground with its forelegs. SCP-3637-1 will continue to wander and dig until rain degrades it to a point where it is incapable of locomotion. SCP-3637-1 is noted to vocalize loudly and dig more rapidly and frantically as it degrades. Rain will continue to fall in the vicinity of SCP-3637-1 until the instance dissolves completely. Only one SCP-3637-1 instance can exist at a time; a 3637-Ramah event will not occur again until the current SCP-3637-1 has dissolved.\n\n\nSCP-3637-1 is capable of remembering previously-dug areas as well as specific Foundation personnel; leading theories to explain this phenomenon are that SCP-3637-1 is either the same entity appearing repeatedly, or a group of entities sharing a collective memory.\n\n\nIncident 3637-A:\n On 5/13/18, a Foundation paleontology team excavated a nearly complete \nMaiasaura\n nest, including several dozen fossilized eggs, approximately 11\u00a0km from the location of SCP-3637. A 3637-Ramah event immediately occurred at the location of SCP-3637 despite the lack of rain, and the resulting SCP-3637-1 immediately vocalized loudly and proceeded to run directly towards the nest. SCP-3637-1 then absorbed salt from the ground, growing in size to a length of 15\u00a0m, and easily scaled the barrier. On-site personnel attempted to neutralize SCP-3637-1 with high-pressure water hoses but were unsuccessful. SCP-3637-1 then shed the excess salt, returning to its original size of 9\u00a0m, and continued course to the nest. Personnel at the nest were advised to stand down while backup was scrambled. Upon reaching the nest, SCP-3637-1 lay down next to it and nuzzled the fossilized eggs, before collapsing into salt crystals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3636\n | SCP-3637 | \nSCP-3638\n \u00bb",
