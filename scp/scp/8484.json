Rituals performed by any necromancers related to and outside of SCP-8484 must be intercepted immediately by MTF Psi-8 \"The Silencers.\"\n\n\nExpeditions into SCP-8484 are unfeasible due to foreign complications.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8484 refers to a five-story ziggurat structure approximately 1.5 kilometers east of Mesopotamos, Greece. SCP-8484 has been cordoned off by GOC personnel under the guise of Hellenic Armed Forces, prohibiting entry within a 1\u00a0km radius.\n\n\nSCP-8484 is the \nGlobal Occult Coalition's\n headquarters for \nAcheron\n, an initiative specialized in necromancy\n1\n and reanimation mageia\n2\n that incorporates \nthaumatology\n and symbolism from Greek mythology. As a result, they are able to access information from otherwise unavailable sources which has been used to interrupt allied and Foundation operations (see addendum 8484-2).\n\n\nOverheard recounts proclaim SCP-8484's internal structure is configurated into a prison, designed to forcefully confine deceased spirits and employ various torture techniques.\n3\n\n\nEven with Acheron's blatant injustice, the UN Undersecretariat D.C. al Fine has insisted on its continuation despite objections from even the Coalition's own legislative body, the Council of 108 (see addendum 8484-1). This has strained Foundation-Coalition relations, and Foundation diplomats are working on diplomatic resolutions.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8484-1:\n The following is a transcript, retrieved by covert Foundation agents, of one of the Council of 108 (C108) meetings relating to the ethical permissibility of Acheron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECORDED MEETING LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and Date:\n 1433 EST; 26/06/2019\n\n\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n Undersecretary, our goal is to mitigate, not instigate.\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n Digressing again, are we, your illuminance?\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n Absolutely not. I see no reason not to open this discussion now.\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n And I see no relevance between Acheron and bioethics.\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n Have you not heard the rumors, ma'am? Slaughtering the slaughtered? A period of tranquility instilled with pain by your orders? How do you justify yourself?\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n You said it yourself, your illuminance. They are rumors. Laytalk.\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n Yet you seem oddly silent rather than eager to dispel them. Acheron goes against everything this Coalition stands for. Your adamance only shows how tight your fist is around our throats.\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n Leonardo, I will remove you if you attempt to deviate from the discussion again.\n\n\nThe Bavarian Illuminati Delegate stammers, his face blanched.\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n What?\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n This moderated caucus has limited speaking time and a set discussion topic. You are out of line. The next time you want to speak about Acheron, I suggest you raise your hand after drafting a sufficiently destructive motion.\n\n\nBavarian Illuminati Delegate:\n How do you know my name?\n\n\nD.C. al Fine:\n Otherwise, there won't be a next time.\n\n\n\n\nD.C. al Fine has been suspected by both Foundation intelligence and C108 members of using Acheron to obtain private information of political rivals without consent.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8484-2:\n The conversation below follows two GOC members planning a deliberate attack on a Foundation Containment Team transporting an SCP. The conversation was intercepted by MTF Epsilon-66 at SCP-8484's inner cordon using equipment from \nProject VOIDSEEKER.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN RECORDING]\n\n\nThe audio is slightly muffled due to spatial disturbances. There is the soft sound of crashing waves, predicted to be a subterranean lake.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n What's the spiel?\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n Weapons transfer. Twelve men, two cars, six each, one with the payload. Tomorrow, Montana, 0500 local time. I have a Strike Team on-site right now.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n This is verifiable?\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n Yes, sir. We got it from the MTF Captain.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n Soothsayer?\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n Pilgrim as well. His body was still fresh when we brought it into Acheron. About four days after expiration, so memory is fairly intact.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n How'd you manage that with the Pilgrims?\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n Turns out that asking for a spirit's permission is optional. They summoned him like that.\n\n\nLeon snaps his fingers.\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n His screams were weirder than most, but they were genuine. It was Limb Mangling done at the highest level five times, so confidence is high.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n Good. Deploy your team. But keep the Captain's family until after the op. Ensure he understands that if this is a trap, it's his loss, not mine.\n\n\nAgent Leon Periklis:\n And, sir, Assistant Director Tilade requests at least one live prisoner. It's for interrogation.\n\n\nAzrael Silver scoffs.\n\n\nResearch Director Azrael Silver:\n We don't need them alive to make them talk.\n\n\n[RECORDING STOPPED]\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the planned attack was to embezzle an anomalous weapon under Foundation property to expand the GOC's arsenal. It was carried out approximately two minutes after the recorded conversation.\n\n\nMTF Nu-7 \"Hammer Down\" arrived at the scene approximately eight minutes after the Containment Team requested reinforcements. Unfortunately, the vehicle responsible for transporting the SCP was already stolen, likely airlifted.\n\n\nDue to recent GOC incursions being related to Acheron and SCP-8484, MTF Psi-8 was given plausible cause to search the scene for members of the Containment Team to investigate if necromantic rituals or traces of reanimation were conducted.\n\n\nNo survivors or corpses were retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8484-Z:\n\n\n\n\nLEVEL-5\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED;\u00a0INPUT\u00a0PASSCODE?\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings,\n\n\nDue to the lack of attention paid to this particular file, the two aforementioned pieces of evidence are convincing enough.\n\n\nDo not take unnecessary risks appending additional information here. Divert attention to Acheron's political and diplomatic fallout. This document should be simply kept as a reference.\n\n\nLet the noise blur everything out.\n\n\nNonetheless, if you believe the evidence you've procured is urgent and you have \nthoroughly\n deliberated your choices, I suggest ghost-booking an appointment with me immediately. Use extension 919302241274 on your burner. Yes, it's nine digits more than your regular extension number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014RAISA Director Shaw Clay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEXTUAL CHANNEL ESTABLISHED\n\n\nYOU HAVE REACHED EXTENSION 919302241274\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAISA Director Shaw Clay\n\nStatus.\n\nDid you retrieve the leak?\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor Kinsey Aishatu\n\nSupposedly.\n\nBut it was too easy.\n\n\n\n\nRAISA Director Shaw Clay\n\nTo find it?\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor Kinsey Aishatu\n\nNo.\n\nWe didn't need to find anything.\n\nIt practically fell onto our lap.\n\n\n\n\nRAISA Director Shaw Clay\n\nElaborate.\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor Kinsey Aishatu\n\nThis isn't a leak.\n\nIt's an announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nAlibis\u00a0are\u00a0expensive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n You\n\n\nFrom:\n V\u00c9RIT\u00c9\n\n\nSubject:\n The Lapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING:\n\nThe following documents do not have valid RAISA serial codes.
