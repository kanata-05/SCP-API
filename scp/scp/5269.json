SCP-5269 remains in an immobile position with its arms outstretched. Rock and lunar soil have completely covered SCP-5269's lower limbs, securing SCP-5269's position in the Moon's regolith. The object has not been observed to decompose, age, or exhibit any other phenomena associated with life or death. Thus, the biological state of SCP-5269 is unknown.\n\n\nSCP-5269 is capable of transmitting radio signals. The origin, purpose, and intended receiver of these signals is unknown. The contents of an SCP-5269 communication are presented in an anomalous, universally digestible system, capable of being comprehended and understood regardless of the listener's known language. SCP-5269 has been observed to transmit messages once every two years since the object's discovery in 2016.\n\n\nAll attempts to communicate with SCP-5269 have failed.\n\n\nAddendum 5269.1:\n SCP-5269 Signal Transcripts\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 6/19/2018, 20:36:02\n\n\n\n\nI don't miss it.\n\n\nThere are no crowds, no mirrors, no pressures or expectations.\n\n\nFinal escape. Final rest.\n\n\nI don't have to think about her anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 6/19/2020, 12:47:31\n\n\n\n\nWarmth.\n\n\nI have everything I need.\n\n\nSee them run. Amusement delays death. Not me.\n\n\nI am above all.\n\n\nI don't have to think about her anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 6/19/2022, 04:10:02\n\n\n\n\nNever going back.\n\n\nMy own world. No suffering.\n\n\nI still hate myself.\n\n\nI am always thinking about her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5268\n | SCP-5269 | \nSCP-5270\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5269\n\" by J Dune, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
