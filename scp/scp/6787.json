Due to a risk of personnel becoming trapped in SCP-6787 despite this, travel between Sublevel 12 and Sublevel 14 is only to take place via elevator at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6787 refers to Sublevel 13 of Site-87. Prior to SCP-6787's discovery in early 2022 during routine maintenance, Site-87 did not have a sublevel designated 13, instead incrementing from Sublevel 12 directly to Sublevel 14. SCP-6787 is only accessible via Site-87\u2019s main stairwell, and lacks elevator access. The door to SCP-6787 is marked with the Foundation insignia, with \u2018Department of Abnormalities, Archival Division\u2019 engraved beneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view through SCP-6787's stacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSublevel 13 resembles a public library; over 30,000 volumes of literature are believed to exist within SCP-6787, and it bears several amenities common in public libraries. Also present within SCP-6787 are:\n\n\n\n\nA book deposit slot on the rear wall of SCP-6787; it has been welded shut, with caution signs placed around it in several languages.\n\n\nSeveral pieces of seating, most of which are intact, including two sofas and an antique reading chair. However, personnel will routinely refuse to use any seating, citing an \u2018instability\u2019 with the furniture that they have not been able to elaborate on, and either lean against walls or sit on the floor to rest.\n\n\nA skylight in the center of the structure, with light levels corresponding to an overcast day consistently filtering through it. Directly beneath the skylight is a section containing several tabletop games, apparently available for lending similar to other media in the library. These games are all missing crucial pieces such as dice, tokens, and game boards.\n\n\nA circulation desk, which, to date, has not been located. Several members of personnel report seeing the circulation desk, but are unable to locate it when returning to the area where it was sighted.\n\n\nA television with a built-in Betamax player is present by a pair of microfiche machines. Despite this, no Betamax tapes have been found within SCP-6787. Similar to the book deposit slot, the slot for inputting the tape has been fused shut.\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the literature and media within SCP-6787 is non-anomalous, albeit of questionable origin, as media dating from as recently as 2021 has been located within. The exception is within the \u2018Local History\u2019 section; media from this section is designated SCP-6787-A.\n\n\nSCP-6787-A instances purport to depict and detail (if occasionally dramatize) the history of the Nexus that Site-87 is located in (Sloth\u2019s Pit, Wisconsin, Nexus 18). However, several details within SCP-6787-A instances are erroneous or contradictory. A table of selected instances follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6787-A Instance\n\n\nPurported Contents\n\n\nNotable Deviations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson Sloth: An Autobiography\n\n\nAn autobiography of the founder of Sloth\u2019s Pit, Jackson Sloth; date of publication is listed as 1893, three years after Sloth\u2019s purported death.\n\n\nAside from the date of publication, a large portion of the work details Sloth\u2019s brutal massacre, and subsequent pataphysical erasure, of Native Peoples within Douglas County, Wisconsin. In reality, Sloth had relatively good relations with the Native Peoples in the area, even learning some of the Ojibwe language in an attempt to integrate them into what would become Sloth\u2019s Pit. The tone of the work indicates that the author is proud of his accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoots Grown by Blood\n by James Patterson\n\n\nA true crime novel detailing murders committed by Jeffery Hubble, a \u2018blood cultist and farmer\u2019 who believed that \u2018human flesh could allow for a massive harvest\u2019.\n\n\nThe novel describes Hubble as murdering indiscriminately and burying upwards of twenty bodies within his field; only thirteen victims have been attributed to him. It is stated that Hubble\u2019s crimes went undiscovered until the killing of his family\u2019s dog and a local member of law enforcement in 2017; while accurate in spirit, it does not reflect actual events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA History of UFO Sightings in the Greater Superior Area\n\n\nAn account of purported extraterrestrial activity around Superior and Sloth\u2019s Pit, Wisconsin.\n\n\nNo extraterrestrial activity has been confirmed to occur within Nx-18. \nHistory of UFO Sightings\n attributes the increased activity to the presence of the \u2018Jasper Sloth Nuclear Research Facility\u2019; no such place exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: A Life, Redacted\n by \u2018Nemo\u2019\n1\n\n\nA biography of a Foundation agent stationed at Site-87 until death from an unspecified cause in 2020; the agent\u2019s name is antimemetic and cannot be perceived.\n\n\nNo agent matching the description given in the book has ever been stationed at Site-87. Her purported partner, Agent Tofflemire, denies knowledge of this individual, but has asked to keep this instance of SCP-6787-A. Request pending approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Court Record of Divorce Proceedings Between Cassandra Pike and Claude Mattings\n\n\nAs the title suggests, it is a record of all evidence and testimony within a divorce case between the two individuals; both are Foundation personnel, and have been married since 2018.\n\n\nThe primary reason given for divorce is listed as \u2018instability following the birth of their only child, Rose\u2019. Pike loses custody of her child to her husband. In reality, the Pike-Mattings family have relocated to California to work on Project LAZARUS; they have not been notified of the existence of this item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutopsy Records of Dr. Katherine Jean Sinclair\n\n\nA pair of contradictory Foundation-issued autopsy reports. One has the date of death as October of 2020, and cause of death as \u2018destruction of cranial tissue\u2019. The other lists the date of death as May of 2021, and lists cause of death as \u2018blood loss due to a gunshot wound\u2019.\n\n\nAt both times, Sinclair was in mortal danger; in the former case, her left eye was destroyed, and in the latter, she needed to resort to thaumic stasis until medical treatment could be rendered. Despite this, she is currently alive and works at Site-87.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA History of Hate in Douglas County, Wisconsin\n by the American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\nA work that portrays Sloth\u2019s Pit as a heavily conservative area, \nde facto\n ruled by \u2018The Family Church\u2019, a relatively inactive Group of Interest which modeled itself after conservative Christian teachings. They are listed as being responsible for several lynchings, hate crimes, and murders of sexual and racial minorities, overseen by a \u201cFather Reese\u201d.\n\n\nAmong the victims are an \u2018Alexander Carracos\u2019 and the \u2018The Williams Twins\u2019, both corresponding to members of Foundation personnel. \nBlake Williams and Alejandro Carrasco\n have been in a relationship since December 2021, which is listed as the date of their murder. It is unclear why Ruby Williams was targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Autumn III, vol. 1\n and \nvol. 5\n\n\nA pair of VHS tapes that purportedly show an anthology series, depicting events which occurred during October 2019 concerning Halloween-related phenomena appearing in Nexuses around the world. Volumes 2, 3 and 4 have not been located.\n\n\nThe episodes portray the Foundation attempting to, in some way, destroy or neutralize the anomalous elements of the Nexuses they control or have involvement in; Puerto Extra\u00f1o, Brazil has all extraterrestrial life exterminated, the non-human population of Esterberg is killed in a Foundation-backed pogrom, extradimensional areas such as Three Portlands and the \u2018Complex Apartments\u2019 in New York are brought into regular space in such a way that they destroy the areas they are connected to, and a nuclear bomb is dropped down the \nBottomless Pit\n within Nx-18 in an attempt to neutralize it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-87: A History\n by Phillip Verhoten\n\n\nPurports to tell the history of Site-87 in Sloth\u2019s Pit, Wisconsin, following its establishment in 1907.\n\n\nSloth\u2019s Pit was not known to the larger Foundation prior to the discovery of \nSCP-097\n in 1969, and Site-87 was not established until 1976. None of the personnel listed are known to ever have been Foundation personnel; the only individual of note mentioned is Zachary Bellwether, a purported Director of Site-87, who ran for governor of Wisconsin three times between 1945 and 1960, losing the primary each time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Index of Treason\n\n\nA document purported to be published by the Foundation, listing several individuals who had committed treason against the organization since its establishment. All current and former Site-87 personnel are listed, as are personnel at Site-43, Site-120, and several other Sites which deal with the containment of Nexuses.\n\n\nThe only known contents include references to Director Bailey\u2019s brother, \nSCP-1483\n Commissioner Thomas Bailey, as purposefully collapsing SCP-1483 and defecting to the Antarctic Empire. Upon recording this data, Director Bailey ordered the volume destroyed, and SCP-6787 sealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being sealed as of March 2022, personnel traversing Site-87 between Sublevel 12 and Sublevel 14 have sporadically found themselves within SCP-6787, leading to current containment procedures. All twenty personnel who have become trapped this way have been recovered; in the process, they have retrieved several other instances of SCP-6787-A, with titles including:\n\n\n\n\nWhen Words Fail: The Loss of \nSCP-5109\n and the Collapse of US Foundation Infrastructure\n by Harold R. Blank, Foundation Archivist\n\n\nA More Bottomless Pit? The Economic Failure of Sloth\u2019s Pit, Wisconsin\n by Simeon Adler\n\n\nDeath of Summer: The \nCamp Krakkow Disaster\n by Isaiah H. Pickman, Archivist Emeritus\n\n\nI. H. Pickman\u2019s 001 Proposal: \u2018Erasing the Word of God\u2019\n\n\n\n\nThese items are currently not being studied, per order of Director Bailey.\n\n\n\n\n| \nHub\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
