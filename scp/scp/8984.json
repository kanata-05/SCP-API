Any footage of the object is to be taken down under cover story CC-1221 (\"Copyright Claims\").\n\n\nSCP-8984 is currently contained in a standard containment chamber at \nSite-311\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8984 is an amorphous mass fluctuating between 1 and 2 meters in height which levitates approximately 1.5 meters off the ground at all times. Its surface constantly displays an ever-changing array of images, the meaning of which is currently unknown. The object is sentient and capable of telepathic communication within a range of 5 meters.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8984 was originally discovered when it manifested in downtown Manhattan, USA on April 2nd, 2024. Though there was a minor panic when SCP-8984 was initially observed by bystanders, most civilians quickly resumed their routine even after SCP-8984 communicated with them. It is unknown how long the object remained \nin situ\n before being detected by Foundation plants in the area, however, due to New York City's Native Unusuality Reading, the use of amnestics was opted against.\n\n\nInterview Log 8056.22:\n The following document is an interaction between SCP-8984 and Researcher Mallory. This interaction was routine as per Ethics Committee Dictate 7.26.D\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n[Mallory enters SCP-8984's chamber. She approaches it and smiles. SCP-8984 continues to display contextually unknown images across the surface of its body.]\n\n\nMallory:\n Hello, 8984.\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nHELLO.\n\n\nMallory:\n How are you doing today?\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nCONFUSED.\n\n\nMallory:\n What's got you confused?\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nYOU DO NOT FEAR ME.\n\n\nMallory:\n Are we supposed to? \n[Mallory folds her arms.]\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nYES.\n\n\nMallory:\n Well, to be honest, at first we were concerned you were broadcasting memetic hazards, but once we ruled that out we just kind of assumed you were just a weird blob that shows weirder pictures. That's nothing to be scared about.\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nAS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOUR ORGANIZATION DEALS IN MY KIND OF HORRORS. CORRECT?\n\n\nMallory:\n I suppose so.\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nSO IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME YOU WOULD NOT BE FEARFUL. HOWEVER, THE CIVILIANS I ENCOUNTERED DID NOT FEAR ME EITHER.\n\n\nMallory:\n This is New York, sweetheart. If you want people's attention you've gotta really try.\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nBUT I SHOW YOU HORRORS OF THE DISTANT FUTURE.\n\n\nMallory:\n Yeah, you've said that before. But none of what you're showing us looks like\u2026 well\u2026 anything.\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nPERHAPS I AM TOO SOFT IN MY DELIVERY METHOD.\n\n\n[SCP-8984 levitates 2 meters off the ground and emits a red light while continuing to display images of unknown context.]\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nFEAR ME, MORTAL.\n\n\n[Mallory shields her eyes.]\n\n\nMallory:\n Ah!\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \nYES! IT IS WORKING! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AWAITS YOU! NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR WAYS, OR FACE HORRORS BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION!\n\n\nMallory:\n I think that's your problem. You're showing us things that we just don't understand, so we can't really be scared of them.\n\n\n[SCP-8984 comes back down to its average levitation height of 1.5 meters and ceases emitting light.]\n\n\nSCP-8984:\n \n\u2026 I MUST PONDER. TAKE YOUR LEAVE, MORTAL.\n\n\nMallory:\n Sure thing, 8984. Take it easy.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
