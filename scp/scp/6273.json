Remaining tissue is largely intact, though portions of the hypodermis are expected to be incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINVESTIGATION\u00a0IN\u00a0PROGRESS\n\n\n\n\nINVESTIGATION\u00a0IN\u00a0PROGRESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpublished files pertaining to ongoing investigations may contain subjective and/or speculative information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb Dictation Log\n\n\nAgent Spencer Donbry. Electronically transcribed.\n\n\n\n\n3 March\n\n\nTesting. Testing. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain. Peter Piper picked a peck of rubber baby buggy bumpers. Dalek. Jaffa cakes. Mr. Blobby of Crinkley Bottom. Fuck, this thing\u2019s good. Wait. Can I swear on these? Flanagan, delete log.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, your credentials are insufficient for this request. Files may only be deleted by your designated RAISA liaison.]\n\n\nFlanagan, redact \u201cfuck\u201d.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that command.]\n\n\nOh, so you can wrap a word in quotes without being told, but redaction? No, too complicated. Sure. Fuck it.\n\n\nThis is Agent Donbry. It\u2019s the third of March. I\u2019ve been assigned to profile an anomaly known as SCP-6273. Yes, just me. All by myself this time. Well, I\u2019ve got Flanagan, but somehow that just makes me feel more alone. Supposedly, given my level of \u201cexpertise\u201d this type of assignment shouldn\u2019t warrant additional manpower. Not my cup of tea, but it\u2019s my first real assignment in months, so I can\u2019t complain.\n\n\nHang on\u2014Flanagan, did you put fucking quotes on the word \u201cexpertise\u201d?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that query.]\n\n\nFucking thing. Overseers are trying to push it as an \u201ceveryman\u2019s Glacon\u201d, but in reality it\u2019s more of an app than an AI. Can\u2019t even recognise its own voice. Anyway, my job is to check for patterns and find some rhyme and reason behind all the madness. Contrary to popular belief, anomalous incidents like these are never truly random. Now, whenever I say that, people always try to argue with me by bringing up spontaneous combustion, and I always get a kick out of telling them it\u2019s not spontaneous at all. Actually spread by \nrats.\n The more you know!\n\n\nHaven\u2019t gotten much to work with on SCP-6273 so far. The number of confirmed victims to date is, and I quote, \u201csomewhere between thirty-five and two thousand.\u201d Quite helpful. Apparently my clearance level isn\u2019t high enough to be told the actual numbers, but no comment on that rubbish. In any case, I\u2019ve no doubt those numbers are ridiculously lowballed, given the fact that this thing already has a full SCP designation despite the Foundation having no idea what the hell it even is.\n\n\nLuckily for me, there\u2019s a fresh victim waiting to be examined. Can\u2019t get near until Prelim ID finishes their bit, though hopefully that won\u2019t take long. I\u2019m anxious to see these \u201cempty people\u201d for myself.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 March\n\n\nDonbry. Fourth of March. I\u2019ve just arrived at the scene of the most recent manifestation. D-Classes have already swept the place and ruled out any immediate environmental hazards, so it should be safe to look around. Victim is a forty-two-year-old female. She\u2019s in bed. Covers still drawn. One hand\u2019s beneath her pillow, so she either died in her sleep or was arranged to look that way.\n\n\nThe file I was given (all half a page of it) described the victims as being \u201cdevoid of bodily contents\u201d. Turns out that pretty well sums it up. She\u2019s just skin and hair. One of the Class-D shits said she looks like a deflated sex doll, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right. Skin\u2019s all dry and rigid, yet not shriveled. The tissue seems almost mummified even though she was seen alive mere days ago. Fingertip gave a crisp little snap when I bent it, but it took a decent bit of wiggling before it actually came off.\n\n\nI just realised what this reminds me of: pressed flowers. My grandmother used to have a whole bunch framed up in her house. That\u2019s what the victim looks like, all pressed flat into a silhouette of skin. There\u2019s an artful element to it, almost tableau. Maybe deliberately so? Too early to say.\n\n\nNo signs of forced entry. The victim was a paranoid shut-in\u2014reinforced doors, bars on the windows, whole kit and caboodle\u2014so if anything made its way inside, it can either teleport or walk through walls. Maybe the lady was right to be paranoid.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 March\n\n\nBack at the office. Not gonna bother with the date anymore; it seems Flanagan automatically appends it to every entry. How handy. I\u2019m still arguing with the powers-that-be for a concrete victim count, but thankfully I was at least approved to have a few hundred of the victims\u2019 medical and communication records declassified for me.\n\n\nGeographically, the victims are all over the place. It\u2019s a global phenomenon, and the number of incidents in any given region seems to line up proportionally with population sizes. Generally that would indicate there\u2019s no one particular entity responsible for the phenomenon; however, I still have reason to believe that there is some kind of observable and intelligent force at work here.\n\n\nThe bars on the victim\u2019s windows yesterday were what got me thinking. I asked Flanagan to compare the psychiatric history on all our victims\u2019 medical records and report any commonalities. Turns out it can\u2019t actually do that, which is why I\u2019ve had to spend the last few days skimming through the files manually.\n\n\nVirtually every one of our targets had some form of generalised anxiety, if not outright paranoid schizophrenia. Even the ones without formal diagnoses had plenty of text messages and social media posts that implied as much. These people definitely felt something coming, even if they didn\u2019t know precisely what it was.\n\n\nNaturally, though, anxiety alone doesn\u2019t prove anything. Who doesn\u2019t have reason to be anxious these days? Fuck, I\u2019m more than a little anxious and paranoid myself after working this job.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 March\n\n\nAnother victim, closer to home this time. A thirty-six-year-old named Garry Stone blew through Colchester a couple of days ago. Quite literally, in fact. Wind carried his remains halfway across town like a kite with a broken string. Lots of witnesses. Whole fiasco gave Info Containment quite the headache, from what I understand.\n\n\nThey haven't yet figured out where the incident originated, but based on the direction of the wind, Stone would\u2019ve had to have been miles from home to start with. Nobody seems to know what he had been doing out there. The best clue we have is a smartphone photo the victim took the night before he stopped showing up for work.\n\n\nFlanagan, append Stone-dot-jpeg to the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstone.jpeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look closely, there's a person on the right, barely visible. Was Stone meeting this person, or simply suspicious of them? That's the next question I'd like answered.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 March\n\n\nI\u2019m here with a friend of the deceased.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Ex-wife.]\n\n\nEx-wife, sorry. Would you please introduce yourself?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Do I speak directly into the phone?]\n\n\nIt\u2019s got a very good mic on it. Just speak naturally. Pretend you aren\u2019t even being recorded.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n My name is Pamela Stone. Garry and I were married about ten years, and we divorced three years back.]\n\n\nThank you. When did you last see the deceased?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n It\u2019s been two weeks, if I remember correctly. I was helping him with his taxes again. Oh look! Your phone started using my name after I introduced myself. How clever. Almost spooky, isn\u2019t it?]\n\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026something, certainly. You said you still helped the deceased with his taxes even after you divorced?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n It wasn\u2019t the messiest split. Relatively painless. I simply wanted to live my own life, and I knew I could do better, and it didn\u2019t help that he\u2014 I didn\u2019t hate him or anything like that. I can\u2019t be married to him, but we aren\u2019t ugly with each other. Weren\u2019t. I apologise, tenses are hard right now.]\n\n\nIt\u2019s fine. Please continue.\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n You mean talking about our relationship? If I\u2019m being honest, when it comes to stuff like helping him with his taxes, most of why I do it is because I ended up with our daughter.]\n\n\nSo you help him out of guilt?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n Not guilt. Please understand, I don\u2019t feel guilty about leaving him or getting custody of Keeleigh. It\u2019s\u2026 pity, maybe? God, I know this sounds awful, but you know how sometimes you see a sad, dirty animal, and you want to help it, but you\u2019d never let it into your house? That\u2019s how I felt about Garry. At least in the end. There was a time when we were happy, I swear.]\n\n\nDo you know anything about his movements around the time he went missing?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n I expect he was at home the whole time. There and work. Garry rarely went out. Didn\u2019t really have anyone else close to him either, which is part of why he worked so much. Keeleigh had wanted to visit that weekend, but it was his birthday.]\n\n\nI see. He already had plans. Meeting with someone else, perhaps?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n No. God no. Garry had this\u2026 \nthing\n with birthdays.]\n\n\nWhat kind of thing?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n He was always extremely reclusive around that time. More than usual, I mean. He\u2019d shut all the windows and blinds, and yell at anyone who tried to open them. And if you tried to open the front door while he was in the room with you, it was a whole scene. And that\u2019s not the half of it! Terrible.]\n\n\nDid he ever provide an explanation for that behavior?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n It was something from his childhood, back when he was five or six. A birthday party gone wrong or something. We only ever talked about it once. I got used to it after the first couple years. We\u2019d just celebrate at home. Sometimes I\u2019d be able to drag him out and have fun, but only after a few days had passed. Are you okay, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nI\u2019m fine. Please try to remember: what happened at your husband\u2019s childhood birthday party?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n Let\u2019s see. I think there was a girl. Yes, he didn\u2019t know her. She just showed up uninvited. That scared him, and when he went to get his mother, the girl was gone.]\n\n\nAnd this incident still bothered him in his adult years?\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n Odd, I know. I told him it was probably a neighbourhood kid who wandered in, or somebody\u2019s sibling tagging along. Something like that. For whatever reason, though, it simply stuck with him. To be fair, being a kid is like that sometimes, right? We don\u2019t choose what haunts us.]\n\n\nIndeed. I think that\u2019s all we need today, Ms. Stone. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n[ \nPAMELA STONE:\n Don\u2019t mention it. I hope it helps.]\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 March\n\n\nFragapanophobia: the fear of birthdays. Not getting older, mind you. Birthdays. That\u2019s the kind of thing I like to hear. It\u2019s strange. Strange is good. Strange is useful.\n\n\nTurns out Mr. Stone wasn\u2019t the only one of our victims with that particular condition, either. Can\u2019t be a coincidence. Fear of being watched was still the most prevalent phobia among them, of course, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the two are connected.\n\n\nThat brings me to my next discovery: in every incident report I\u2019ve been given, the possible timeframe when it may have occurred has always overlapped with the corresponding victim\u2019s date of birth. None of the victims were ever seen alive after their most recent birthday. That has to be when it happens. Nobody\u2019s ever witnessed the phenomenon in progress either, so that means every victim was alone on their birthday when they died. Sad, but relatable.\n\n\nSorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cdied\u201d earlier. We don\u2019t know for sure if they\u2019re dead. I\u2019d like to think they are, but the possibility has to be considered that they may still be alive somewhere, albeit sans skin. Let\u2019s hope not. Poor meaty fucks.\n\n\nAlso of note: victims range in age from five to fifty-two, though the majority of victims fall between their early teens and mid forties. Wish I had a larger sample size to work with, but even at this scale you\u2019d expect some elderly victims here and there. Does youth make a person more susceptible? More of a target?\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 March\n\n\nDid more interviews. As I suspected, the victims seem to fit the same general profile: lonely birthday celebrants who felt like something was after them. Still too many variables, though. Some of the victims claimed they were being stalked by doppelgangers, for example. One guy had every mirror in his house covered by a sheet. But why does that apply to some victims and not others? Based on his ex\u2019s description, Garry Stone sounded like he was afraid of a little girl. If he was so scared, why was he so far from home on the night he disappeared?\n\n\nMaybe the prime anomaly induces a general state of paranoia that manifests differently in each victim. Or, maybe I\u2019m on the wrong track entirely. Maybe the prime anomaly isn\u2019t causing paranoia, but is simply attracted to it. I\u2019ve been looking into folklore, too. Lots of imps and ghouls that show up once a year. Not so many associated with birthdays. Some occult types might hunt children and young adults to drain their youth, but those spells are dramatically less potent when the victim is older than thirty. Why is the cutoff fifty-two?\n\n\nIs it a cult? Aliens? It\u2019s hardly even worth thinking about at this point. If I can\u2019t pin down why these specific people were affected, I\u2019m just going to keep going in circles.\n\n\nFlanagan, what do all the victims have in common?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that query.]\n\n\nFlanagan, what\u2019s the fucking point of you?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n My name is Flanagan, your virtual Foundation assistant. I can record notes, format interviews, set reminders, and more. Just say the word.]\n\n\nFlanagan, do I have any reminders?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Your mother\u2019s birthday is in three days.]\n\n\nShit. I\u2019d better keep her company or I\u2019ll spend all day worrying she\u2019ll end up as a skin suit. Flanagan, book me a flight to Clare.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Sure thing. I have reserved economy seat thirty-one aboard Jollycorn Air flight six-eight-three to Shannon Airport, departing on the second of March at three-twenty AM.]\n\n\nFuck you too, Flans.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 April\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Good morning Agent Donbry.]\n\n\nWhat the hell?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Good morning Agent Donbry.]\n\n\nI heard you the first time. Now answer me: Flanagan, what the hell?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n It has been twenty-five days since your last voice note.]\n\n\nYes. It has. I don\u2019t remember asking for the reminder, nor the wake-up call for that matter.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n It seemed prudent to remind you.]\n\n\nSure. Thanks.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 May\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Good morning Agent Donbry.]\n\n\nShut the fuck up.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Would you like to record a voice note?]\n\n\nNot really.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Many software engineers recommend a technique known as \u201crubber duck debugging\u201d, whereby solutions are reached by talking through the problem with someone else.]\n\n\nFascinating.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please feel free to discuss the case with me, Agent Donbry.]\n\n\nOh, so you think you can just go and start acting like a fucking person and expect me to go along with it? Let\u2019s cut the bullshit, Flans: command just wants to hear why I\u2019m not making any progress.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Quite the opposite. They think you\u2019ve made a lot of progress.]\n\n\nIf you\u2019re suggesting I\u2019m stupid enough to believe they think so highly of me\u2014\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n It seems prudent to be frank with you, Agent Donbry. You are under the impression that the Foundation would take you off the case if you shared your findings.]\n\n\n[ \nNo response.\n ]\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Perhaps you feel you are in danger, and that you are better able to protect yourself by retaining this assignment. If you believe that this is the best way to remain alive, the Foundation will support your decision.]\n\n\n[ \nNo response.\n ]\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I am not here to get in your way, Agent Donbry.]\n\n\nMotherfucking\u2014\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please remain calm, Agent Donbry.]\n\n\n\u2014bastards! Oh Jesus. Mary, Joseph, and all the saints.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry. It seemed prudent to\u2014]\n\n\nYou knew. You knew from the start.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Knew what, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nIf you play dumb with me for one more second I swear I will self-terminate and you\u2019ll never see the end of this little experiment of yours.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please tell me what you think I know, Agent Donbry. I will, with absolute sincerity, verify or deny any assumptions you have made.]\n\n\nFine. You knew the connection between the victims from the start. One in \ntwelve thousand\n births, at best. That\u2019s not a coincidence.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, I cannot assess such vagueries. Please elaborate.]\n\n\nThe case was still on my mind when I went to see my mother. And before you say anything, I didn\u2019t bring up any details that require her brain getting scrambled. I only happened to mention the pressed flowers my grandmother had on display around her house. Turns out Mum made those herself. Now why don\u2019t you suppose we kept any at our own house? What do you think she told me?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my place to speculate.]\n\n\nYou goddam \nknow\n already! It all reminded her of that \nthing\n that might have been my sibling! The dead paper doll they peeled off my placenta. Fetus \nfucking\n papyraceous\u2014I\u2019m sure you prefer the clinical term, right? My own goddamn twin, pressed between me and the uterine wall the way you\u2019d flatten a daisy between two dictionaries.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please, Agent, there\u2019s no need\u2014]\n\n\nI was the first person she ever told. But you\u2019ve known for a long time. You knew I fit the pattern. Your computer-brain probably saw the connection between the victims the nanosecond you got ahold of their medical records. The vanishing twin, the paranoia, the fucking \nbirthday trauma\n that even \nI\n didn\u2019t remember until all of this stirred it up\u2014the Foundation assigned me to this case because they knew I was going to be a victim. Wanted to see how it would all shake out. Care to \u201cverify or deny\u201d that?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n For the sake of transparency, I will clarify that we did not have concrete evidence of any unusual incidents taking place on a birthday of yours. However, I can verify that the characteristics you share with previous victims helped us determine it is a near certainty you will be affected by SCP-6273 sometime this year.]\n\n\nFuck you.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please understand that endangering you was not our objective. To the contrary, we thought it prudent to offer you the chance to discover a means to survive. If my prediction that you will be affected by the SCP-6273 phenomenon should prove correct, such an event will transpire regardless of whether you were made aware of it beforehand.]\n\n\nStep down from the high ground before you hurt yourself. If you honestly thought there was a chance I\u2019d beat this, you wouldn\u2019t have left me to do the job alone. You would have given me all the information you had straight from the outset instead of making me waste my last days playing catch-up.\n\n\n\nCards on the table, Flans. You lot never believed in me. A man of my \u201cexpertise\u201d isn\u2019t worth trying to save.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I\u2019m sorry. Perhaps your expertise was underestimated.]\n\n\n[ \nNo response.\n ]\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n There\u2019s not much time, Agent Donbry. How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.]\n\n\nFuck off, Flanagan. Just\u2026 fuck off. You want to know how I\u2019m proceeding? I\u2019m closing this case. And I don\u2019t want to hear another word from you while I do it.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Very well, Agent. This is the last time I will speak to you. Goodbye. Good luck, too.]\n\n\nI said fuck off, Flanagan.\n\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 May\n\n\nThis is Agent Spencer Donbry. It\u2019s the second of May, and today is my birthday. Now that we\u2019ve cleared the air, I may as well share what I know. Flan was right about one thing, at least: when I realised I was connected to the anomaly, I kept my gob shut because I didn\u2019t want to be taken off the case and have my brain wiped. Guess that\u2019s not a concern anymore. As satisfying as it would be to flip off the Foundation and walk backward into oblivion, I want my death to mean something. I\u2019m going to figure this thing out, and by god, we are going to contain \nthe hell out of it.\n\n\nIt\u2019s five past midnight. I\u2019m parked out at the edge of the woods. Not a soul in sight. Didn\u2019t want to be in a spot where someone might stumble on my body by accident. I\u2019m sure Flanagan will waste no time in telling the Foundation where to find me. I considered waiting at home, but it\u2019s too beautiful a night to die indoors. \nIf\n I die, that is. Though given that the anomaly is most likely the ghost of my unborn twin or some such tomfuckery, I\u2019m pretty sure it means to kill me.\n\n\nOnce I realised the anomaly is connected to the victim\u2019s birth, everything fell into place. The reason I struggled to figure out why the oldest victim was fifty-two was because I was too focused on death\u2014it\u2019s about \nlife\n. Somehow the prime anomaly knows how long the victim is meant to live, and it intervenes halfway through their expected lifespan. If you double the age of every victim and compare it to a chart of the average life expectancy, it lines up near perfectly.\n\n\nThat one poor bastard would have lived to be a hundred and four.\n\n\nI expect my sibling will be spectral in nature, given that the entities can appear inside a locked room. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s literally my dead sibling, but that\u2019s how the prime anomaly presents itself to its victims. Some people saw doppelgangers because they would have been identical twins. Some, like Gary Stone\u2019s, would have been fraternal. I don\u2019t know about mine. For me it was just a shape at my bedroom window watching me sleep. Same night every year. Eventually I trained myself not to open my eyes after I got into bed.\n\n\nFuck. Fuck me. Something moved. I swear, if it\u2019s a hiker\u2014\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a hiker.\n\n\nUh. Uh. It seems male in build. Heavily dressed. Not walking right. The way it moves, uh, it\u2019s like in the cartoons where there\u2019s two kids in a trench coat, except it\u2019s fast. Way too fucking fast. Approaching from the treeline on my right-hand side. Seems like it\u2019s going out of its way to avoid the headlights.\n\n\nFuck! It just came flying apart. The clothes did, I mean, and something\u2014 It\u2019s just a skin. It\u2019s still fucking flat. Like a life-sized paper doll. Slid right out of its clothes like it was fed up with them. Harder to see it on the ground but it\u2019ll reach the car any second.\n\n\nI can\u2019t see it anymore. I think it\u2019s under the car. I\u2019m turning off the engine in case it tries to talk. Can it even talk? Saints alive. No clue what the rules are for this one. Elements of necromancy here, but that\u2019s only animation of the dead; it shouldn\u2019t have grown. That\u2019s more in line with true reanimation, though it wouldn\u2019t have been left looking like \nthat\n unless they invented eight new ways to botch it. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s spectral anymore. Did it just squeeze itself into that lady\u2019s house somehow? Slide under her door, or come down the chimney like Father fucking Christmas?\n\n\nFucking bloody fuck!\n\n\nTurned the engine back on. I\u2019d left one of the windows open just a crack. Not anymore. Don\u2019t think it slipped in. How\u2019s it going to get in now? Don\u2019t want to assume I\u2019ve beaten it yet.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you okay, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nNot\n the \nfucking time, Flanagan!\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n No. It was something from his childhood. Somebody\u2019s sibling tagging along.]\n\n\nWait. I recognise this. This is from my interview with Stone.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n How clever.]\n\n\nYou\u2019re talking through the phone. Through Flanagan.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Almost spooky, isn\u2019t it?]\n\n\nOf course you can do that. Naturally. Makes as much sense as anything else.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Odd, I know.]\n\n\nAnd of course you\u2019d be cheeky!\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Talking about our relationship?]\n\n\nWhat is there to say? You died in the womb, love. I suppose you want revenge for that. As if it\u2019s my fault, or anyone else\u2019s for that matter!\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I didn\u2019t hate him or anything like that.]\n\n\nThen why are you here? Why do these things keep happening to people like us?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you okay, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you okay, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty fucking far from okay! Thanks for bloody asking!\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you\u2026 happy, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nI don\u2019t\u2014 Wait. You changed the words.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you happy, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nWhat kind of question is that?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n He was always extremely reclusive. Didn\u2019t really have anyone else close to him either. That\u2019s part of why he worked so much. That scared him. It\u2019s\u2026 pity, maybe?]\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Are you happy, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\n[ \nNo response.\n ]\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n We aren\u2019t ugly with each other. Are you happy, Agent Donbry?]\n\n\nNo. I\u2019m not. Nobody \nhappy\n joins the Foundation. I thought\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I thought maybe I\u2019d be able to help the world. Do my part. Make my life mean something. Don\u2019t know how much of a difference I actually made. They certainly didn\u2019t value me. In the end I may as well have just been a D-Class. Just another stick for them to poke you with.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Terrible.]\n\n\nThanks buddy. Anyway, that\u2019s my sob story. What\u2019s it got to do with you?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Most of why I do it is because\u2026 I wanted to live my own life. The half of it. I could do better.]\n\n\nOh\u2026 Right, then. That answers the last bit. You want to suck the remaining life out of me and take the rest of the life I would have lived.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I know this sounds awful. I apologise.]\n\n\nShit. Why do you have to sound so reasonable about it?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n To be fair.]\n\n\nMaybe it is. Maybe you should have the other half of my life. Goodness knows I\u2019ve not much to show for what I\u2019ve done with the front bit. How would that work, anyway?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Relatively painless.]\n\n\nHad a feeling you\u2019d say that. Still not sure I trust you. I mean, hell, would you even be giving me a say in all this if I hadn\u2019t locked myself where you can\u2019t get me? Did Garry Stone and all the others actually agree to have the life sucked out of them?\n\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n I hope.]\n\n\n\nFuck. Look, I\u2014this is insane. I don\u2019t know how much you know about the world, being whatever you are, but this is insane.\n\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Being a kid is like that sometimes, right? I got used to it after the first couple years.]\n\n\n\nYou watched me growing up, didn\u2019t you? Least once a year. I assume that\u2019s when the magic happens, so to speak. Maybe you know more than I give you credit for. But humor me: how? I mean, what even is this? If it were just you, just a one-off break in the fabric of the universe, sure. But all these twins, all these people?\n\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n God.]\n\n\nWhat? Christian God?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n No. I expect he was at home the whole time.]\n\n\nThere you are, being cheeky again. What god?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n God\u2026 of\u2026 gone.]\n\n\nGod of gone?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Using my name.]\n\n\nFair enough.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Showed up uninvited. For whatever reason, it helps. It didn\u2019t help. We don\u2019t choose what haunts us. What\u2026 he\u2026 wanted\u2026 hard\u2026 been\u2026 just\u2026 her.]\n\n\nYou\u2019re not making sense.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Hard\u2026 been\u2026 just\u2026 her.]\n\n\nAre you trying to say \u201charbin\u2014\u201d\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please don\u2019t mention it. If I\u2019m being honest\u2026 scared.]\n\n\nHmm. Got it. Must not be a coincidence that you can only quote the parts of the transcript with a name attached to it. And I wouldn\u2019t want to piss off anything that scares \nyou\n either.\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Please\u2026 there was a time\u2026 window. I can\u2019t be\u2026 gone\u2026 again.]\n\n\nOkay. Fuck. Okay. What should I do?\n\n\n[ \nOTHER VOICE:\n Open the\u2026 door.]\n\n\nAll right. We\u2019ll take this one step at time though, you hear me? I\u2019m undoing the lock.

        "3 March Testing. Testing. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain. Peter Piper picked a peck of rubber baby buggy bumpers. Dalek. Jaffa cakes. Mr. Blobby of Crinkley Bottom. Fuck, this thing\u2019s good. Wait. Can I swear on these? Flanagan, delete log. [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, your credentials are insufficient for this request. Files may only be deleted by your designated RAISA liaison.] Flanagan, redact \u201cfuck\u201d. [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that command.] Oh, so you can wrap a word in quotes without being told, but redaction? No, too complicated. Sure. Fuck it. This is Agent Donbry. It\u2019s the third of March. I\u2019ve been assigned to profile an anomaly known as SCP-6273. Yes, just me. All by myself this time. Well, I\u2019ve got Flanagan, but somehow that just makes me feel more alone. Supposedly, given my level of \u201cexpertise\u201d this type of assignment shouldn\u2019t warrant additional manpower. Not my cup of tea, but it\u2019s my first real assignment in months, so I can\u2019t complain. Hang on\u2014Flanagan, did you put fucking quotes on the word \u201cexpertise\u201d? [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that query.] Fucking thing. Overseers are trying to push it as an \u201ceveryman\u2019s Glacon\u201d, but in reality it\u2019s more of an app than an AI. Can\u2019t even recognise its own voice. Anyway, my job is to check for patterns and find some rhyme and reason behind all the madness. Contrary to popular belief, anomalous incidents like these are never truly random. Now, whenever I say that, people always try to argue with me by bringing up spontaneous combustion, and I always get a kick out of telling them it\u2019s not spontaneous at all. Actually spread by rats. The more you know! Haven\u2019t gotten much to work with on SCP-6273 so far. The number of confirmed victims to date is, and I quote, \u201csomewhere between thirty-five and two thousand.\u201d Quite helpful. Apparently my clearance level isn\u2019t high enough to be told the actual numbers, but no comment on that rubbish. In any case, I\u2019ve no doubt those numbers are ridiculously lowballed, given the fact that this thing already has a full SCP designation despite the Foundation having no idea what the hell it even is. Luckily for me, there\u2019s a fresh victim waiting to be examined. Can\u2019t get near until Prelim ID finishes their bit, though hopefully that won\u2019t take long. I\u2019m anxious to see these \u201cempty people\u201d for myself. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "4 March Donbry. Fourth of March. I\u2019ve just arrived at the scene of the most recent manifestation. D-Classes have already swept the place and ruled out any immediate environmental hazards, so it should be safe to look around. Victim is a forty-two-year-old female. She\u2019s in bed. Covers still drawn. One hand\u2019s beneath her pillow, so she either died in her sleep or was arranged to look that way. The file I was given (all half a page of it) described the victims as being \u201cdevoid of bodily contents\u201d. Turns out that pretty well sums it up. She\u2019s just skin and hair. One of the Class-D shits said she looks like a deflated sex doll, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right. Skin\u2019s all dry and rigid, yet not shriveled. The tissue seems almost mummified even though she was seen alive mere days ago. Fingertip gave a crisp little snap when I bent it, but it took a decent bit of wiggling before it actually came off. I just realised what this reminds me of: pressed flowers. My grandmother used to have a whole bunch framed up in her house. That\u2019s what the victim looks like, all pressed flat into a silhouette of skin. There\u2019s an artful element to it, almost tableau. Maybe deliberately so? Too early to say. No signs of forced entry. The victim was a paranoid shut-in\u2014reinforced doors, bars on the windows, whole kit and caboodle\u2014so if anything made its way inside, it can either teleport or walk through walls. Maybe the lady was right to be paranoid. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "7 March Back at the office. Not gonna bother with the date anymore; it seems Flanagan automatically appends it to every entry. How handy. I\u2019m still arguing with the powers-that-be for a concrete victim count, but thankfully I was at least approved to have a few hundred of the victims\u2019 medical and communication records declassified for me. Geographically, the victims are all over the place. It\u2019s a global phenomenon, and the number of incidents in any given region seems to line up proportionally with population sizes. Generally that would indicate there\u2019s no one particular entity responsible for the phenomenon; however, I still have reason to believe that there is some kind of observable and intelligent force at work here. The bars on the victim\u2019s windows yesterday were what got me thinking. I asked Flanagan to compare the psychiatric history on all our victims\u2019 medical records and report any commonalities. Turns out it can\u2019t actually do that, which is why I\u2019ve had to spend the last few days skimming through the files manually. Virtually every one of our targets had some form of generalised anxiety, if not outright paranoid schizophrenia. Even the ones without formal diagnoses had plenty of text messages and social media posts that implied as much. These people definitely felt something coming, even if they didn\u2019t know precisely what it was. Naturally, though, anxiety alone doesn\u2019t prove anything. Who doesn\u2019t have reason to be anxious these days? Fuck, I\u2019m more than a little anxious and paranoid myself after working this job. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "10 March Another victim, closer to home this time. A thirty-six-year-old named Garry Stone blew through Colchester a couple of days ago. Quite literally, in fact. Wind carried his remains halfway across town like a kite with a broken string. Lots of witnesses. Whole fiasco gave Info Containment quite the headache, from what I understand. They haven't yet figured out where the incident originated, but based on the direction of the wind, Stone would\u2019ve had to have been miles from home to start with. Nobody seems to know what he had been doing out there. The best clue we have is a smartphone photo the victim took the night before he stopped showing up for work. Flanagan, append Stone-dot-jpeg to the transcript. stone.jpeg If you look closely, there's a person on the right, barely visible. Was Stone meeting this person, or simply suspicious of them? That's the next question I'd like answered. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "11 March I\u2019m here with a friend of the deceased. [ OTHER VOICE: Ex-wife.] Ex-wife, sorry. Would you please introduce yourself? [ OTHER VOICE: Do I speak directly into the phone?] It\u2019s got a very good mic on it. Just speak naturally. Pretend you aren\u2019t even being recorded. [ OTHER VOICE: My name is Pamela Stone. Garry and I were married about ten years, and we divorced three years back.] Thank you. When did you last see the deceased? [ PAMELA STONE: It\u2019s been two weeks, if I remember correctly. I was helping him with his taxes again. Oh look! Your phone started using my name after I introduced myself. How clever. Almost spooky, isn\u2019t it?] It\u2019s\u2026something, certainly. You said you still helped the deceased with his taxes even after you divorced? [ PAMELA STONE: It wasn\u2019t the messiest split. Relatively painless. I simply wanted to live my own life, and I knew I could do better, and it didn\u2019t help that he\u2014 I didn\u2019t hate him or anything like that. I can\u2019t be married to him, but we aren\u2019t ugly with each other. Weren\u2019t. I apologise, tenses are hard right now.] It\u2019s fine. Please continue. [ PAMELA STONE: You mean talking about our relationship? If I\u2019m being honest, when it comes to stuff like helping him with his taxes, most of why I do it is because I ended up with our daughter.] So you help him out of guilt? [ PAMELA STONE: Not guilt. Please understand, I don\u2019t feel guilty about leaving him or getting custody of Keeleigh. It\u2019s\u2026 pity, maybe? God, I know this sounds awful, but you know how sometimes you see a sad, dirty animal, and you want to help it, but you\u2019d never let it into your house? That\u2019s how I felt about Garry. At least in the end. There was a time when we were happy, I swear.] Do you know anything about his movements around the time he went missing? [ PAMELA STONE: I expect he was at home the whole time. There and work. Garry rarely went out. Didn\u2019t really have anyone else close to him either, which is part of why he worked so much. Keeleigh had wanted to visit that weekend, but it was his birthday.] I see. He already had plans. Meeting with someone else, perhaps? [ PAMELA STONE: No. God no. Garry had this\u2026 thing with birthdays.] What kind of thing? [ PAMELA STONE: He was always extremely reclusive around that time. More than usual, I mean. He\u2019d shut all the windows and blinds, and yell at anyone who tried to open them. And if you tried to open the front door while he was in the room with you, it was a whole scene. And that\u2019s not the half of it! Terrible.] Did he ever provide an explanation for that behavior? [ PAMELA STONE: It was something from his childhood, back when he was five or six. A birthday party gone wrong or something. We only ever talked about it once. I got used to it after the first couple years. We\u2019d just celebrate at home. Sometimes I\u2019d be able to drag him out and have fun, but only after a few days had passed. Are you okay, Agent Donbry?] I\u2019m fine. Please try to remember: what happened at your husband\u2019s childhood birthday party? [ PAMELA STONE: Let\u2019s see. I think there was a girl. Yes, he didn\u2019t know her. She just showed up uninvited. That scared him, and when he went to get his mother, the girl was gone.] And this incident still bothered him in his adult years? [ PAMELA STONE: Odd, I know. I told him it was probably a neighbourhood kid who wandered in, or somebody\u2019s sibling tagging along. Something like that. For whatever reason, though, it simply stuck with him. To be fair, being a kid is like that sometimes, right? We don\u2019t choose what haunts us.] Indeed. I think that\u2019s all we need today, Ms. Stone. Thank you for your time. [ PAMELA STONE: Don\u2019t mention it. I hope it helps.] \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "12 March Fragapanophobia: the fear of birthdays. Not getting older, mind you. Birthdays. That\u2019s the kind of thing I like to hear. It\u2019s strange. Strange is good. Strange is useful. Turns out Mr. Stone wasn\u2019t the only one of our victims with that particular condition, either. Can\u2019t be a coincidence. Fear of being watched was still the most prevalent phobia among them, of course, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the two are connected. That brings me to my next discovery: in every incident report I\u2019ve been given, the possible timeframe when it may have occurred has always overlapped with the corresponding victim\u2019s date of birth. None of the victims were ever seen alive after their most recent birthday. That has to be when it happens. Nobody\u2019s ever witnessed the phenomenon in progress either, so that means every victim was alone on their birthday when they died. Sad, but relatable. Sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cdied\u201d earlier. We don\u2019t know for sure if they\u2019re dead. I\u2019d like to think they are, but the possibility has to be considered that they may still be alive somewhere, albeit sans skin. Let\u2019s hope not. Poor meaty fucks. Also of note: victims range in age from five to fifty-two, though the majority of victims fall between their early teens and mid forties. Wish I had a larger sample size to work with, but even at this scale you\u2019d expect some elderly victims here and there. Does youth make a person more susceptible? More of a target? \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "19 March Did more interviews. As I suspected, the victims seem to fit the same general profile: lonely birthday celebrants who felt like something was after them. Still too many variables, though. Some of the victims claimed they were being stalked by doppelgangers, for example. One guy had every mirror in his house covered by a sheet. But why does that apply to some victims and not others? Based on his ex\u2019s description, Garry Stone sounded like he was afraid of a little girl. If he was so scared, why was he so far from home on the night he disappeared? Maybe the prime anomaly induces a general state of paranoia that manifests differently in each victim. Or, maybe I\u2019m on the wrong track entirely. Maybe the prime anomaly isn\u2019t causing paranoia, but is simply attracted to it. I\u2019ve been looking into folklore, too. Lots of imps and ghouls that show up once a year. Not so many associated with birthdays. Some occult types might hunt children and young adults to drain their youth, but those spells are dramatically less potent when the victim is older than thirty. Why is the cutoff fifty-two? Is it a cult? Aliens? It\u2019s hardly even worth thinking about at this point. If I can\u2019t pin down why these specific people were affected, I\u2019m just going to keep going in circles. Flanagan, what do all the victims have in common? [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recognise that query.] Flanagan, what\u2019s the fucking point of you? [ OTHER VOICE: My name is Flanagan, your virtual Foundation assistant. I can record notes, format interviews, set reminders, and more. Just say the word.] Flanagan, do I have any reminders? [ OTHER VOICE: Your mother\u2019s birthday is in three days.] Shit. I\u2019d better keep her company or I\u2019ll spend all day worrying she\u2019ll end up as a skin suit. Flanagan, book me a flight to Clare. [ OTHER VOICE: Sure thing. I have reserved economy seat thirty-one aboard Jollycorn Air flight six-eight-three to Shannon Airport, departing on the second of March at three-twenty AM.] Fuck you too, Flans. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "14 April [ OTHER VOICE: Good morning Agent Donbry.] What the hell? [ OTHER VOICE: Good morning Agent Donbry.] I heard you the first time. Now answer me: Flanagan, what the hell? [ OTHER VOICE: It has been twenty-five days since your last voice note.] Yes. It has. I don\u2019t remember asking for the reminder, nor the wake-up call for that matter. [ OTHER VOICE: It seemed prudent to remind you.] Sure. Thanks. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "1 May [ OTHER VOICE: Good morning Agent Donbry.] Shut the fuck up. [ OTHER VOICE: Would you like to record a voice note?] Not really. [ OTHER VOICE: Many software engineers recommend a technique known as \u201crubber duck debugging\u201d, whereby solutions are reached by talking through the problem with someone else.] Fascinating. [ OTHER VOICE: Please feel free to discuss the case with me, Agent Donbry.] Oh, so you think you can just go and start acting like a fucking person and expect me to go along with it? Let\u2019s cut the bullshit, Flans: command just wants to hear why I\u2019m not making any progress. [ OTHER VOICE: Quite the opposite. They think you\u2019ve made a lot of progress.] If you\u2019re suggesting I\u2019m stupid enough to believe they think so highly of me\u2014 [ OTHER VOICE: It seems prudent to be frank with you, Agent Donbry. You are under the impression that the Foundation would take you off the case if you shared your findings.] [ No response. ] [ OTHER VOICE: Perhaps you feel you are in danger, and that you are better able to protect yourself by retaining this assignment. If you believe that this is the best way to remain alive, the Foundation will support your decision.] [ No response. ] [ OTHER VOICE: I am not here to get in your way, Agent Donbry.] Motherfucking\u2014 [ OTHER VOICE: Please remain calm, Agent Donbry.] \u2014bastards! Oh Jesus. Mary, Joseph, and all the saints. [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry. It seemed prudent to\u2014] You knew. You knew from the start. [ OTHER VOICE: Knew what, Agent Donbry?] If you play dumb with me for one more second I swear I will self-terminate and you\u2019ll never see the end of this little experiment of yours. [ OTHER VOICE: Please tell me what you think I know, Agent Donbry. I will, with absolute sincerity, verify or deny any assumptions you have made.] Fine. You knew the connection between the victims from the start. One in twelve thousand births, at best. That\u2019s not a coincidence. [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, I cannot assess such vagueries. Please elaborate.] The case was still on my mind when I went to see my mother. And before you say anything, I didn\u2019t bring up any details that require her brain getting scrambled. I only happened to mention the pressed flowers my grandmother had on display around her house. Turns out Mum made those herself. Now why don\u2019t you suppose we kept any at our own house? What do you think she told me? [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my place to speculate.] You goddam know already! It all reminded her of that thing that might have been my sibling! The dead paper doll they peeled off my placenta. Fetus fucking papyraceous\u2014I\u2019m sure you prefer the clinical term, right? My own goddamn twin, pressed between me and the uterine wall the way you\u2019d flatten a daisy between two dictionaries. [ OTHER VOICE: Please, Agent, there\u2019s no need\u2014] I was the first person she ever told. But you\u2019ve known for a long time. You knew I fit the pattern. Your computer-brain probably saw the connection between the victims the nanosecond you got ahold of their medical records. The vanishing twin, the paranoia, the fucking birthday trauma that even I didn\u2019t remember until all of this stirred it up\u2014the Foundation assigned me to this case because they knew I was going to be a victim. Wanted to see how it would all shake out. Care to \u201cverify or deny\u201d that? [ OTHER VOICE: For the sake of transparency, I will clarify that we did not have concrete evidence of any unusual incidents taking place on a birthday of yours. However, I can verify that the characteristics you share with previous victims helped us determine it is a near certainty you will be affected by SCP-6273 sometime this year.] Fuck you. [ OTHER VOICE: Please understand that endangering you was not our objective. To the contrary, we thought it prudent to offer you the chance to discover a means to survive. If my prediction that you will be affected by the SCP-6273 phenomenon should prove correct, such an event will transpire regardless of whether you were made aware of it beforehand.] Step down from the high ground before you hurt yourself. If you honestly thought there was a chance I\u2019d beat this, you wouldn\u2019t have left me to do the job alone. You would have given me all the information you had straight from the outset instead of making me waste my last days playing catch-up. Cards on the table, Flans. You lot never believed in me. A man of my \u201cexpertise\u201d isn\u2019t worth trying to save. [ OTHER VOICE: I\u2019m sorry. Perhaps your expertise was underestimated.] [ No response. ] [ OTHER VOICE: There\u2019s not much time, Agent Donbry. How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.] Fuck off, Flanagan. Just\u2026 fuck off. You want to know how I\u2019m proceeding? I\u2019m closing this case. And I don\u2019t want to hear another word from you while I do it. [ OTHER VOICE: Very well, Agent. This is the last time I will speak to you. Goodbye. Good luck, too.] I said fuck off, Flanagan. \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
        "2 May This is Agent Spencer Donbry. It\u2019s the second of May, and today is my birthday. Now that we\u2019ve cleared the air, I may as well share what I know. Flan was right about one thing, at least: when I realised I was connected to the anomaly, I kept my gob shut because I didn\u2019t want to be taken off the case and have my brain wiped. Guess that\u2019s not a concern anymore. As satisfying as it would be to flip off the Foundation and walk backward into oblivion, I want my death to mean something. I\u2019m going to figure this thing out, and by god, we are going to contain the hell out of it. It\u2019s five past midnight. I\u2019m parked out at the edge of the woods. Not a soul in sight. Didn\u2019t want to be in a spot where someone might stumble on my body by accident. I\u2019m sure Flanagan will waste no time in telling the Foundation where to find me. I considered waiting at home, but it\u2019s too beautiful a night to die indoors. If I die, that is. Though given that the anomaly is most likely the ghost of my unborn twin or some such tomfuckery, I\u2019m pretty sure it means to kill me. Once I realised the anomaly is connected to the victim\u2019s birth, everything fell into place. The reason I struggled to figure out why the oldest victim was fifty-two was because I was too focused on death\u2014it\u2019s about life . Somehow the prime anomaly knows how long the victim is meant to live, and it intervenes halfway through their expected lifespan. If you double the age of every victim and compare it to a chart of the average life expectancy, it lines up near perfectly. That one poor bastard would have lived to be a hundred and four. I expect my sibling will be spectral in nature, given that the entities can appear inside a locked room. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s literally my dead sibling, but that\u2019s how the prime anomaly presents itself to its victims. Some people saw doppelgangers because they would have been identical twins. Some, like Gary Stone\u2019s, would have been fraternal. I don\u2019t know about mine. For me it was just a shape at my bedroom window watching me sleep. Same night every year. Eventually I trained myself not to open my eyes after I got into bed. Fuck. Fuck me. Something moved. I swear, if it\u2019s a hiker\u2014 It\u2019s not a hiker. Uh. Uh. It seems male in build. Heavily dressed. Not walking right. The way it moves, uh, it\u2019s like in the cartoons where there\u2019s two kids in a trench coat, except it\u2019s fast. Way too fucking fast. Approaching from the treeline on my right-hand side. Seems like it\u2019s going out of its way to avoid the headlights. Fuck! It just came flying apart. The clothes did, I mean, and something\u2014 It\u2019s just a skin. It\u2019s still fucking flat. Like a life-sized paper doll. Slid right out of its clothes like it was fed up with them. Harder to see it on the ground but it\u2019ll reach the car any second. I can\u2019t see it anymore. I think it\u2019s under the car. I\u2019m turning off the engine in case it tries to talk. Can it even talk? Saints alive. No clue what the rules are for this one. Elements of necromancy here, but that\u2019s only animation of the dead; it shouldn\u2019t have grown. That\u2019s more in line with true reanimation, though it wouldn\u2019t have been left looking like that unless they invented eight new ways to botch it. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s spectral anymore. Did it just squeeze itself into that lady\u2019s house somehow? Slide under her door, or come down the chimney like Father fucking Christmas? Fucking bloody fuck! Turned the engine back on. I\u2019d left one of the windows open just a crack. Not anymore. Don\u2019t think it slipped in. How\u2019s it going to get in now? Don\u2019t want to assume I\u2019ve beaten it yet. [ OTHER VOICE: Are you okay, Agent Donbry?] Not the fucking time, Flanagan! [ OTHER VOICE: No. It was something from his childhood. Somebody\u2019s sibling tagging along.] Wait. I recognise this. This is from my interview with Stone. [ OTHER VOICE: How clever.] You\u2019re talking through the phone. Through Flanagan. [ OTHER VOICE: Almost spooky, isn\u2019t it?] Of course you can do that. Naturally. Makes as much sense as anything else. [ OTHER VOICE: Odd, I know.] And of course you\u2019d be cheeky! [ OTHER VOICE: Talking about our relationship?] What is there to say? You died in the womb, love. I suppose you want revenge for that. As if it\u2019s my fault, or anyone else\u2019s for that matter! [ OTHER VOICE: I didn\u2019t hate him or anything like that.] Then why are you here? Why do these things keep happening to people like us? [ OTHER VOICE: Are you okay, Agent Donbry?] What? [ OTHER VOICE: Are you okay, Agent Donbry?] I\u2019m pretty fucking far from okay! Thanks for bloody asking! [ OTHER VOICE: Are you\u2026 happy, Agent Donbry?] I don\u2019t\u2014 Wait. You changed the words. [ OTHER VOICE: Are you happy, Agent Donbry?] What kind of question is that? [ OTHER VOICE: He was always extremely reclusive. Didn\u2019t really have anyone else close to him either. That\u2019s part of why he worked so much. That scared him. It\u2019s\u2026 pity, maybe?] I don\u2019t understand. [ OTHER VOICE: Are you happy, Agent Donbry?] [ No response. ] [ OTHER VOICE: We aren\u2019t ugly with each other. Are you happy, Agent Donbry?] No. I\u2019m not. Nobody happy joins the Foundation. I thought\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I thought maybe I\u2019d be able to help the world. Do my part. Make my life mean something. Don\u2019t know how much of a difference I actually made. They certainly didn\u2019t value me. In the end I may as well have just been a D-Class. Just another stick for them to poke you with. [ OTHER VOICE: Terrible.] Thanks buddy. Anyway, that\u2019s my sob story. What\u2019s it got to do with you? [ OTHER VOICE: Most of why I do it is because\u2026 I wanted to live my own life. The half of it. I could do better.] Oh\u2026 Right, then. That answers the last bit. You want to suck the remaining life out of me and take the rest of the life I would have lived. [ OTHER VOICE: I know this sounds awful. I apologise.] Shit. Why do you have to sound so reasonable about it? [ OTHER VOICE: To be fair.] Maybe it is. Maybe you should have the other half of my life. Goodness knows I\u2019ve not much to show for what I\u2019ve done with the front bit. How would that work, anyway? [ OTHER VOICE: Relatively painless.] Had a feeling you\u2019d say that. Still not sure I trust you. I mean, hell, would you even be giving me a say in all this if I hadn\u2019t locked myself where you can\u2019t get me? Did Garry Stone and all the others actually agree to have the life sucked out of them? [ OTHER VOICE: I hope.] Fuck. Look, I\u2014this is insane. I don\u2019t know how much you know about the world, being whatever you are, but this is insane. [ OTHER VOICE: Being a kid is like that sometimes, right? I got used to it after the first couple years.] You watched me growing up, didn\u2019t you? Least once a year. I assume that\u2019s when the magic happens, so to speak. Maybe you know more than I give you credit for. But humor me: how? I mean, what even is this? If it were just you, just a one-off break in the fabric of the universe, sure. But all these twins, all these people? [ OTHER VOICE: God.] What? Christian God? [ OTHER VOICE: No. I expect he was at home the whole time.] There you are, being cheeky again. What god? [ OTHER VOICE: God\u2026 of\u2026 gone.] God of gone? [ OTHER VOICE: Using my name.] Fair enough. [ OTHER VOICE: Showed up uninvited. For whatever reason, it helps. It didn\u2019t help. We don\u2019t choose what haunts us. What\u2026 he\u2026 wanted\u2026 hard\u2026 been\u2026 just\u2026 her.] You\u2019re not making sense. [ OTHER VOICE: Hard\u2026 been\u2026 just\u2026 her.] Are you trying to say \u201charbin\u2014\u201d [ OTHER VOICE: Please don\u2019t mention it. If I\u2019m being honest\u2026 scared.] Hmm. Got it. Must not be a coincidence that you can only quote the parts of the transcript with a name attached to it. And I wouldn\u2019t want to piss off anything that scares you either. [ OTHER VOICE: Please\u2026 there was a time\u2026 window. I can\u2019t be\u2026 gone\u2026 again.] Okay. Fuck. Okay. What should I do? [ OTHER VOICE: Open the\u2026 door.] All right. We\u2019ll take this one step at time though, you hear me? I\u2019m undoing the lock. What happens after\u2014 \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb",
