In the aftermath of these events, an emergency Overseer meeting was called to discuss possible methods of preventing similarly improbable and unfortunate events in the future.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>\n\n\n\n\n<The thirteen council members are seated in Site-01\u2019s main meeting room.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n As I\u2019m sure you have all read up on the events of the last 72 hours, today\u2019s meeting has one purpose: to decide on a course of action to prevent disasters of this scale from happening again.\n\n\nO5-9:\n But, the disasters were averted?\n\n\nO5-3:\n The problem is that they \nalmost\n happened, Nine, and we only barely avoided a Broken Masquerade in the aftermath, or worse. In any case, most of the problems, and similar problems we've experienced over the last year, weren\u2019t caused by human error, just natural factors we have little to no control over. We can\u2019t control the weather, for example.\n\n\nO5-10:\n We \ncould\n,\n just not practically.\n\n\nO5-9:\n How are we supposed to mitigate that risk further than we already have? We funnel as many resources as we can into training and containment technology, and a simple policy change can\u2019t account for random chance.\n\n\nO5-5:\n I have a proposition.\n\n\n<There is a pause in discussion.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Well, spit it out, Five.\n\n\nO5-5:\n The very nature of our organization\u2019s work is to contain the uncontainable. To hide away the most dangerous objects this universe has to offer.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Your point being?\n\n\nO5-5:\n Our work is, by definition, \nunlucky.\n The more Keter-class anomalies we cram into a site, the more likely they\u2019ll eventually break out.\n\n\n<The O5s murmur in agreement.>\n\n\nO5-3:\n We already have fail-safes and backups, Five. Nuclear warheads and highly trained security personnel, AICs and emergency response systems.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Exactly my point. As Ten said, we \ncould\n control the odds, just not practically. So, we\u2019ll need some help.\n\n\nO5-1:\n What \nexactly\n are you proposing, Five?\n\n\nO5-5:\n We have \nalready\n bent the natural laws of this universe to our whim for the purposes of our organization. I propose we commandeer another cosmic force.\n\n\nO5-12:\n \u2026You\u2019re not saying\u2013\n\n\nO5-5:\n I see my dear Twelve has already figured it out. We have bent Death to our will, why stop there? If we could somehow manipulate the odds outside of a few policy changes and equipment upgrades, we could make Site-19 invincible no matter how many Keters we stuff in it.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Five, you\u2019re proposing we contain\u2013\n\n\nO5-5:\n Lady Luck herself, precisely, One. If we can\u2019t control the amount of times we roll the dice, then we have to get the odds on our side. The house \nalways\n wins.\n\n\n<The O5s discuss.>\n\n\nO5-13:\n This is absurd, Five! We absolutely cannot alter a non-anomalous law of the universe.\n\n\nO5-9:\n And, if this little project goes haywire? What then?\n\n\nO5-12:\n We have \nExclusionary Sites\n for a reason, Nine.\n\n\n<The O5s discuss louder.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Silence! Five, assemble a research team and have them draft a proposal. We will not vote on it until you have something more concrete than \u201cchange the odds.\u201d\n\n\nO5-5:\n Fair enough.\n\n\n\n\n<END TRANSCRIPT>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n Potential means of achieving this goal were devised and compiled in Project Proposal: Loaded Dice, detailed below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7771.2:\n Project Proposal\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPROJECT LOADED DICE\n\n\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n To develop a method of reliable artificial probability manipulation to the benefit for the Foundation.\n\n\nABSTRACT:\n Foundation policy has historically focused on preventing and mitigating accidents and disasters through redundancy, failsafes, and personnel protocol rather than altering the fundamental probability of unfavorable events. Certain contained anomalies are capable of such probability manipulation, proving it to be possible and capable of directly affecting Foundation operations.\n\n\nMETHOD:\n The primary focus of Project Loaded Dice is the study, utilization, and replication of anomalies capable of altering probability or luck. Research Area-8 is to be established within 250 kilometers of Site-01. The research and experimentation involved in Project Loaded Dice are to take place exclusively at this area. Temporary housing and containment facilities are to be built for all personnel, humanoid anomalies, and objects used in the project. A substantial budget is to be at the project\u2019s disposal until its success or failure as deemed by the O5 Council. Any anomalies required for the project are to be approved for transfer from other Foundation facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5 Council Vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[09/01/2005]\n\n\nPROPOSAL:\n Approve Project Loaded Dice, as submitted by O5-5.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nNAY\n\n\nABS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPASSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRESULT:\n Proposal approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7771.3:\n Containment Attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt #1\n\n\nMETHOD:\n \nSCP-503\n.\nA human possessing an anomalous tendency towards short-term fortune and survival but long-term misfortune.\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\n Attempts to study and replicate SCP-503's effects have been made throughout the span of its containment.

Usage of SCP-503 as a means of affecting luck of endangered sites halted after Site-47's emergency failsafes experience unexpected failure during a containment breach, allowing SCP-503 to survive but allowing multiple aggressive entities to escape the site entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt #2\n\n\nMETHOD:\n \nSCP-738\n.\nA desk that, when a person sits in front of it, manifests an invisible entity that offers to make a deal with the person seated in front of the desk.

However, due to suddenly having to deal in universal absolutes, SCP-001-SWANN entities are overwhelmed in having to manage other minor events (such as nuclear fission) rather than continuing human consciousness.

The croupier spins the wheel.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Y\u2019know, some say that people are just born unlucky.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Hm?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Or, they believe certain numbers are \u201clucky.\u201d I don\u2019t quite believe that.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <pauses> Is that so?\n\n\nCROUPIER:\n 35 black.\n\n\n<The croupier takes the pile of chips on the table.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Of course. \u201cLuck\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s simply how our feeble human minds deal with mathematical probabilities. I lost my bet not because I was \u201cunlucky,\u201d but because of the slight movements in the dealer\u2019s fingers when he rolls the ball and spins the wheel. Or, the tiny discrepancies in the air temperature around the ball, creating different magnitudes of air resistance.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 places another $15,000 on 18 red. POI-777 places $25,000 on 2 black. The croupier spins the wheel.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Sure, \u201cluck\u201d may only exist in concept, but you really don\u2019t believe that some people or things are more prone to these imperceptible differences?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n The expected probability of landing heads on a coin flip is 50%. Yet, flip a coin 10, 100, a thousand, even a million times, and it won\u2019t be exactly 50/50. Those people just happened to land in the groups of 36 heads or 64 tails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCROUPIER:\n 2 black.\n\n\n<The croupier takes the pile of chips on the table and hands POI-777 $875,000 in chips.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <chuckles> Like I just did right now.\n\n\n<POI-777 smirks.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n By chance, those people, those numbers, those \nsuperstitions,\n they prime our brains into making connections. That\u2019s what our brains do best. And, once you realize that luck doesn\u2019t exist at all, and that it\u2019s all about percentages and normal distribution, you get pretty comfortable testing the odds.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 places $50,000 on 13 black. POI-777 places $500,000 on 7 red. The croupier spins the wheel.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n It\u2019s not all math, is it, though?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n How so?\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I bet I can convince you.\n\n\nCROUPIER:\n Double 0.\n\n\n<The croupier takes the pile of chips on the table.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n You lost.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <smiles> That I did. You bet 7 and I\u2019ll bet 13 this time.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 places his remaining chips ($10,000) on 7 red. POI-777 places $500,000 on 13 black. The croupier spins the wheel.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Now watch.\n\n\n<The ball rolls seemingly randomly around the wheel. As the ball slows down, POI-777 makes a gesture with her finger and takes a sip of her drink in front of O5-\u2588\u2588. The ball lands in a slot.>\n\n\nCROUPIER:\n 13 black.\n\n\n<The croupier takes the pile of chips on the table and hands POI-777 $17.5 million in chips.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Coincidence.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Maybe. But, it sure is damn coincidental I won the \none\n time we switched bets, \nI\n made a gesture, \nand\n took a sip of my drink.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n You\u2019re not saying\u2013?\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <to the CROUPIER> I\u2019d like to cash out now.\n\n\nCROUPIER:\n Yes, ma\u2019am.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <to O5-\u2588\u2588> Why don\u2019t we go get a drink?\n\n\n<The croupier hands POI-777 a ticket for her winnings.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Thank you.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve gotten your name?\n\n\nPOI-777:\n It\u2019s Tyche.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Charmed, I\u2019m [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nPOI-777:\n A pleasure.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <gestures> Shall we?\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 and POI-777 proceed to leave the table in the direction of the Casino Bar and Lounge. MTF Alpha-1 follows closely.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n You see, Mr. [DATA EXPUNGED], \u201cluck\u201d isn\u2019t entirely a man-made concept. A man of science like yourself would see it that way, no doubt.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Hm.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Things in this world aren\u2019t always exactly as they seem, [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are\u2026 things that cannot be explained. Maybe even \nspecial\n people out there with \nspecial\n powers. The myths of old have to be explained by \nsomething.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. Even then, \neverything\n can be explained with science. If not, then it\u2019s an unknowable law of the cosmos that us humans must accept we\u2019ll never know.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n That is not the nature of humanity. Humans \nmust\n know everything. For example, <gestures towards a slot machine>\n\n\n<The player at the slot machine POI-777 gestured towards immediately wins the maximum prize listed on the machine.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Or, <gestures again towards a game of craps>\n\n\n<The shooter at the game rolls \u201csnake eyes\u201d which result in defeated groans at the table.>\n\n\nCOMMAND:\n Anomalous abilities confirmed, O5-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Even the fact that\u2013 <gestures>\n\n\n<All five members of MTF Alpha-1 simultaneously bump into five separate waiters holding drinks.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n \u2013I now know where your men are.\n\n\n<After assisting the waiters, MTF Alpha-1 makes their way towards O5-\u2588\u2588 and POI-777, procuring their concealed weapons.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <to ALPHA-1> Stand down. Do not engage.\n\n\n<MTF Alpha-1 stops.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <smiles> Now, Mr. [DATA EXPUNGED], if my memory is correct, you \u201cdo not believe in luck\u201d?\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 is silent.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Why would a \u201cman of science\u201d like yourself be accompanied by five military trained guards to talk with some random lady at a casino?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <hesitates> <To ALPHA-1> Disperse.\n\n\n<MTF Alpha-1 disperses through the crowd.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n That\u2019s what I thought.

O5-\u2588\u2588 is drinking a glass of whiskey neat, while POI-777 enjoys a lemon ouzo cocktail. O5-\u2588\u2588\u2019s earpiece is placed on the table between the two of them.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Certainly kind of you to treat me to a cocktail before whatever interrogation is about to happen.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 is silent.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I know your men are still around. I happened to see them in the reflection of your glasses.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <hesitates> I represent an organization known as the SCP Fou\u2013\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I know who you are, \njailor.\n Do you think this is the \nfirst\n I\u2019ve heard of your so-called \u201cFoundation\u201d?\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 takes a sip from his drink.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Of course you do. I expect nothing less from a man with your ego.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Then you know what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, yes?\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Of course. You intend to use my powers for your own benefit.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Then, do tell.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Like us or hate us, we are the last line of defense against this world\u2019s downfall. If you weren\u2019t aware, the world almost ended a few months ago.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I knew that.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Then, why didn\u2019t you use your powers to stop it? It was caused by pure chance, we weren\u2019t at fault for it.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Because unlike you I do not pervert the natural course of this world with what or how I think things should be. Humans are capable of incredible things, but they fail to realize they are an insignificant speck in the unknowable cosmos you claim to believe in and impose your will on.\n\n\n<POI-777 takes a sip from her cocktail.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n And, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s only \none\n god at this table.\n\n\n<The two sit in silence.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n A lot of talk from someone we found manipulating the odds to get rich.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I hardly believe defrauding a casino is at all equivalent to the \nmodus operandi\n of your organization. Besides, a goddess gets bored.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n An entire civilization dedicated altars to you, performed rituals in your name, many were devoted to \nyou.\n They created art, stories, offerings. The mythology they wrote about you is \nstill\n being told thousands of years later today. You really don\u2019t think that too contributes to an inflated ego?\n\n\n<POI-777 glares at O5-\u2588\u2588.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Your powers caused you to cease aging. But, you can still die. And, frankly, with a lifespan as long as yours, I bet a bit of \nluck\n had to do with keeping you alive. I assure you your luck \nwill\n run out.\n\n\n<POI-777 is silent for a few moments before bursting into uncontrollable laughter. This goes on for a few minutes, to the annoyance of O5-\u2588\u2588.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <laughing> Wait, wait, wait! I\u2019m so sorry! \nMy\n luck? Me? The \ngoddess\n of fortune? \nI\n will \nrun out\n of luck? <laughing even harder> That is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard!\n\n\n<POI-777 continues laughing for a few more minutes before finally calming down.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, let's get this over with! I have some more games to play. What is it you want?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n If you join our organization, you will have a seat at the council. You will get to make decisions on how to keep this world living, as well as many unimaginable benefits.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Sorry, not interested.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n We can ensure your continued existence.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n No matter how effective of an organization like yours is, this universe \nwill\n come to an end eventually. Even if you last until then, if there is nothing left for you, there is nothing left for me.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Please\u2013\n\n\n<POI-777 begins to stand up.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Thank you for the drink, but I have to get going now.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n <sighs> Then, you leave me no choice.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Hm?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n A boon.\n\n\n<POI-777 sits back down.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n I \nwant\n a boon.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n \u201cWin by persuasion, not by force.\u201d\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n And, did that go so well?\n\n\n<POI-777 is silent.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n A bet. I want to make a bet.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Ha! Your funeral!\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 is silent.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Oh, you\u2019re serious? Okay. What kind of bet?\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n A game\u2013\n\n\nPOI-777:\n There are plenty around us. What will it be? Roulette? Blackjack? Craps?\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 produces a Smith & Wesson revolver from his jacket pocket, just far enough for POI-777 to see.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Russian roulette.\n\n\n<POI-777 appears shocked and dumbfounded.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not playing.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 loads one bullet and hands the gun to POI-777.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n You can check that the gun is indeed loaded.\n\n\n<POI-777 examines the chamber and hands the gun back.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n That it is.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n The rules of the bet are simple. After every trigger pull against my head, I will load in another bullet and spin the chamber. You are free to manipulate the odds as you see fit. If I survive until the end, you have to join the council and help us. If I don\u2019t, well\u2026 you know. The game ends when the gun goes off.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n You\u2019re mad.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Maybe.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 offers his hand for a handshake.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Do we have a deal?\n\n\n<POI-777 hesitates before shaking O5-\u2588\u2588\u2019s hand.>\n.\nMTF Alpha-1 reported the local Hume level suddenly rising by ~20 Hm at this moment before dissipating to normal.\n\n\nPOI-777:\n Deal.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 spins the chamber and pulls back the hammer. O5-\u2588\u2588 puts the barrel of the gun to his head and hesitates for a few moments.>\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Here goes.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 pulls the trigger. The gun does not fire. O5-\u2588\u2588 breathes a sigh of relief.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n I was going easy on you.\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 loads another bullet and hands the gun to POI-777, who examines it and hands it back. O5-\u2588\u2588 spins the chamber and pulls back the hammer. He puts the barrel to his head and pulls the trigger. The gun does not fire.>\n\n\nPOI-777:\n <winces> Oh my god, oh my god.\n\n\nO5-\u2588\u2588:\n Getting pretty lucky, huh?\n\n\n<O5-\u2588\u2588 loads another bullet and hands the gun to POI-777, who examines it and hands it back.

In the time since her appointment six months ago, we have noticed an unusual and alarming rise in the number of incidents the Foundation has experienced. Below are some of the statistics our various departments have reported:\n\n\n\n\n65% increase in the number of successful D-Class escapes,\n\n\n27% increase in the number of incidents involving anomalies in containment,\n\n\n5.3% decrease in site efficiency,\n\n\n\u2588 Euclid/Keter class anomalies breaching containment since appointment,\n.\nMost of which were approved for cross-testing by O5-7 or per O5-7's precedent.\n\n\nNeutralization of \u2588 probability-affecting anomalies.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588 personnel injuries higher than average,\n\n\nNo change in personnel\u2019s adherence to protocol.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the destruction of Research Area-\u2588\u2588, resulting in \u2588\u2588 personnel being terminated, is still fresh in our minds. An investigation into the incident found the cause to be a shipment of bad concrete which went unnoticed for \u2588 years. This is an extremely rare occurrence for an organization as thorough as ours.\n\n\nA majority, if not all, of the incidents were caused by random chance or \u201cbad luck.\u201d While we do not have any direct evidence, we suspect that the Foundation\u2019s recently poor performance is due to sabotage on O5-7\u2019s part. The correlation between her appointment and the start of these incidents is just too blatant to be written off as coincidence. As such, we are urgently calling for her removal from the council as her current position is a detriment to the Foundation. We hope you take our concerns seriously.\n\n\n \n\n\nSophie Gray\n\n\nChairwoman of the Containment Committee\n\n\nIllya Vitalijovych Pavlov\n\n\nHead of the Department of Health and Security\n\n\nJewel Jayde Morales\n\n\nHead of the Department of Internal Affairs\n\n\nNoe Young-Soo\n\n\nHead of Logistics and Foundation Asset Management for Site-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7771.11:\n Overseer Conference on 17/12/2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[17/12/2005]\n\n\nPARTIES PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nOverseer Council (sans O5-7)\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n In response to the official complaint from four department heads regarding effects on Foundation activities possibly caused by O5-7, an emergency session of the O5 Council sans O5-7 was called to discuss potential courses of action.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>\n\n\n\n\n<Twelve of the council members are seated in Site-01\u2019s main meeting room.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n I\u2019m sure you have all seen the memo sent to us by multiple department heads.\n\n\nO5-5:\n This is ridiculous.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I have to agree with Five.\n\n\nO5-13:\n Of course you would! It was you two that got us in this mess.\n\n\nO5-2:\n And, now you want us to stay in it?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Seven is \nnot\n a problem.\n\n\nO5-2:\n You saw the statistics, right, Twelve?\n\n\nO5-12:\n I did.\n\n\nO5-2:\n And, you have nothing to say for it?\n\n\nO5-12:\n They \nhave\n no evidence. As far as we can tell, it could\u2019ve been caused by the previous O5-7\u2019s death or even GOI sabotage.\n\n\nO5-3:\n \u2026That \nis\n unfortunately true.\n\n\nO5-13:\n Unbelievable, Three!\n\n\nO5-3:\n I\u2019m forced to see things as they are, Thirteen.\n\n\nO5-2:\n The statistics\u2013!\n\n\nO5-5:\n Are unsubstantiated and frankly ambiguous. They cannot directly connect O5-7 to these statistics, and one new Overseer out of thirteen \ncannot\n cause this much damage to an organization that has existed for over a century.\n\n\nO5-13:\n She\u2019s \nnot\n a normal Overseer.\n\n\nO5-3:\n Says the anomaly.\n\n\n<O5-13 glares at -3.>\n\n\nO5-5:\n Removing an Overseer is an extremely drastic move, and we have all made decisions that angered the others before.\n\n\nO5-13:\n Such as this project.\n\n\nO5-5:\n <sternly> \nHowever,\n Seven has only been on the council for six months. She could very well be leaving this rough patch.\n\n\nO5-10:\n Do you trust that?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Never judge a book by its cover, Ten. Out of everyone I thought you would know this.\n\n\n<O5-10 scoffs.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Enough! If I am correct, everyone is confident in their opinion of O5-7?\n\n\n<The O5s are silent.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Exactly, no further deliberation is needed. Honestly, this infighting gets aggravating, and I like us to remember that we make the decisions, not the department heads. As such, O5-7\u2019s removal from this council will be put to a vote. All in favor?\n\n\nO5-1, -2, -4, -9, -13:\n Yea.\n\n\nO5-1:\n All opposed?\n\n\nO5-3, -5, -6, -8-, 11-, -12:\n Nay.\n\n\nO5-1:\n O5-10 abstains. The measure fails.

All personnel are accounted for and sent to Site-\u2588\u2588 for reassignment and amnesticization. Fireteam BETA secures all physical project materials, documents, and anomalies for extraction.\n\n\nAt 11:00 AM, all present Overseers save for O5-1, -7, and -13 discreetly exit Site-01 with MTF Alpha-1 (\u201cRed Right Hand\u201d) escort, while O5-1 and -13 enter the secure bunker and seal it behind them. O5-7 is not notified of either event. At 11:07 AM, an unannounced sitewide lockdown is initiated. At 11:12 AM, MTF Omega-1 Fireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12 (\u201cAchilles\u2019 Heels\u201d) enter Site-01 with orders to intercept and terminate O5-7\n.\nOnsite Kant counters reported the local Hume level suddenly rising by ~20 Hm at this moment before dissipating to normal.\n. Onsite elements of MTF Alpha-1 are ordered to protect the bunker exclusively and to not engage with other personnel. At this time, O5-7 remains in her office, not notified of the lockdown or arrival of Mobile Task Forces.\n\n\nAt 11:18 AM, MTF Omega-1 secures the camera control room. One member of Omega-1 is injured by a falling ceiling tile. No cause apparent. MTF Omega-1 reports seven additional injuries resulting from accidents and improbable occurrences, such as falling bricks, broken bones from slipping, and others. Zero recorded fatalities.\n\n\nAt 11:23 AM, simultaneous containment breaches are reported at Sites-06-3, -17, and -19. MTF Epsilon-11 (\u201cNine-Tailed Fox\u201d) is mobilized to respond to these breaches. Presumed related to ongoing action at Site-01. By order of O5-2 and -9, half of onsite MTF Omega-12 personnel are reassigned to guard the Overseers from potential ontokinetic attack. Fireteam ALPHA and remaining MTF Omega-12 personnel continue into Site-01.\n\n\nFireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12, now \u2588\u2588\u2588 feet from O5-7\u2019s location, approach the hallway containing the Overseer\u2019s office. As they round the corner, all members of MTF Omega-12 simultaneously complain of dizziness, nausea, and severe headaches. All members collapse within minutes, with Fireteam ALPHA unable to revive them. Medical team dispatched to their location. Fireteam ALPHA is ordered to continue into the site by COMMAND, with assistance affirmed by several nearby Mobile Task Forces.\n\n\nAt 11:28 AM, Fireteam ALPHA assembles outside of O5-7\u2019s office, who remains typing at a terminal. At this time, Site-01 experiences an electrical blackout, with backup generators failing to power more than the Site\u2019s terminals and database. Fireteam ALPHA don night vision goggles and attempt to shoot O5-7 through the wall, but all provided weapons malfunction. As Fireteam ALPHA troubleshoots their weapons, several negligent discharges occur which strike other personnel. Only one member is left unharmed. O5-7 is unharmed. Full power is restored to the facility, which temporarily blinds the single member of Fireteam ALPHA. As they recover, the single member of Fireteam ALPHA enters the office to terminate O5-7. However, a weapon malfunction (presumably caused by an incomplete discharge) causes the member\u2019s firearm to explode. This injures the member, resulting in significant damage to the hands and bleeding.\n\n\nThe single active member of Fireteam ALPHA attempts to engage O5-7 with a knife. O5-7 unharmed. Surviving member's vital signs destabilizing; presumed incapacitated.\n\n\nFurther support from nearby Mobile Task Forces, including MTF Alpha-1 and Omega-12, are en route.\n\n\nTHE CURRENT SITUATION IS ONGOING.
