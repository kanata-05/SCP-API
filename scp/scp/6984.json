Stop emailing me.\n\n\nGood day,\n\nDr. Coix\n\nResearch Head, Site-322\n\nSent from my iPhone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter inspection by Site-322 maintenance staff found no fault, the faucet was subjected to testing. Subsequently, the object was given its SCP designation, and the present containment procedures were enacted.\n\n\nAs of yet, no human has been identified as a genetic match with SCP-6984 effluence.\n\n\nUpdate [23/06/2018]:\n Following a presentation given by Dr. Ilse Reynders at 2018's Inter-Site Containment Conference,\n2\n Site Director Paul Lague nominated a number of on-site anomalies, including SCP-6984, for the Site\u2019s Integration Program. After a brief period of ideation and testing, the anomaly was integrated into the site\u2019s infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM INTEGRATION PROGRAM PROJECT LEAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe integration of SCP-6984 has been a success; we now pump fluid waste through to SCP-6984, where it\u2019s converted to CSF and undergoes standard biohazard disposal. We\u2019re working our way up to using it as our primary fluid waste disposal method, but the guys in the AA department would like to stress that you \nshouldn\u2019t\n introduce \nany\n solid matter to SCP-6984\u2019s plumbing.\n\n\nIt ain\u2019t broke. \nDon\u2019t break it.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Paul Lague, Site Director, Site-322\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate [04/11/2020]:\n SCP-6984\u2019s function as an anomalous filtration system for waste fluids remained unhindered for over two years. However, on the 2\nnd\n of November, 2021, SCP-6984's output halted completely. Its supply of acroamatic waste, however, continued to build up. The untreated acroamatic waste was stored in a buffer tank before reaching SCP-6984 and began to accumulate there. The fault was identified, before this accumulation triggered an alert, due to the diligence of Dr. Anthony Coix, who contacted Site Maintenance within two hours of SCP-6984 running dry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Maintenance\u00a0Request\u00a0#321.2020\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Maintenance\u00a0Request\u00a0#321.2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \ntenpics.223.ecnanetniam|c.xirdneh#tenpics.223.ecnanetniam|c.xirdneh\n\n\nFrom:\n \ntenpics.223.hcraeser|a.xioc#tenpics.223.hcraeser|a.xioc\n\n\nSubject:\n Broken Faucet.

Did no one tell you? I suggest you report to the Medical wing ASAP. Tell them it\u2019s long-term biohazard exposure.\n\nChase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing investigation by containment maintenance, a blockage was identified within the piping of SCP-6984. The following log details the intervention effort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013BEGIN LOG\u2013\n\n\n\n\n[Yousef Ellison, Containment Maintenance, and Natalia Kemp, Containment Specialist, are standing in SCP-6984\u2019s containment chamber. Chase Hendrix, Site Maintenance, enters with plumbing equipment. All three are wearing Level B HAZMAT suits.]\n\n\nEllison:\n Thanks for coming in for this.\n\n\nKemp:\n We could've managed, but we didn't have the tools with us, and since your office is so close by\u2026\n\n\nHendrix:\n No, no, I get it. No worries. I'm just glad to be in all this gear. \n[He taps his helmet.]\n Feel like I should be wearing this for my regular jobs, too.\n\n\n[Hendrix approaches SCP-6984. He takes a deep breath, then inserts the end of a handheld auger into the faucet. Hendrix begins threading the auger through the object's plumbing.]\n\n\nHendrix:\n How far back do you reckon this thing is?\n\n\nKemp:\n We were unable to loc\u2014\n\n\nHendrix:\n Oh! I\u2019ve got it. I think.\n\n\n[Hendrix squeezes the trigger of the auger handle, closing the device's grabbing mechanism. He frowns.]\n\n\nHendrix:\n It's\u2026 kinda spongy. Weird. It's definitely manageable, it\u2019s moving when I pull it. If this is all there is\u2014\n\n\nKemp:\n Are you prepared to remove the obstruction?\n\n\nHendrix:\n Listen, you guys are the ones who deal with this kind of thing on the daily. You tell me. Is it \nsafe\n to pull it out?\n\n\nKemp:\n We have performed a number of preliminary tests and have identified no\u2014\n\n\nEllison:\n Frankly, we don't know. We're probably as safe as you. It's an anomaly\u2026 despite everything, it's still going to be hard to predict. All we know is that \nthis\n way is less likely to damage SCP-6984 than a more invasive intervention.\n\n\n[Hendrix sighs. He begins winding the auger, pulling the blockage towards the faucet. The resistance from the obstruction increases and he strains while winding.]\n\n\nKemp:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nEllison:\n Need help\u2026 uh\u2026 winding? Pulling?\n\n\n[Hendrix nods with gritted teeth. He stops winding the coil and begins pulling the device away from the faucet. Ellison and Kemp assist him in pulling the auger cable out of SCP-6984.]\n\n\nHendrix:\n Okay, it's pretty close. Final heave: one, two, three!\n\n\n[Ellison, Kemp, and Hendrix pull the cable together, and it flies loose from the faucet. The three fall backwards as a high-pressure jet of fluid begins to run through SCP-6984. Ellison gets up to turn off the faucet, while Kemp and Hendrix inspect the end of the auger cable, which holds a pink mass.]\n\n\nHendrix:\n Is that\u2026?\n\n\n\n\n\u2013END LOG\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe neural tissue recovered from the intervention was designated SCP-6984-1. Should a similar issue arise, the recovered material is to undergo testing, then standard biohazard disposal.\n\n\nFollowing the removal and containment of SCP-6984-1, a review of the object\u2019s role in Site-322's infrastructure is underway. Regardless of the outcome, Dr. Coix has been banned from entering Containment Chamber 112.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
