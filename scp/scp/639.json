SCP-639 should not leave containment area without an escort of at least one security guard, and should not be allowed to mingle with site personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-639 is a Caucasian male approximately 1.6\u00a0m in height and weighing 78\u00a0kg, age 24. SCP-639 is viewed simultaneously on all angles regardless of viewer's position: being in front of the figure will have a view of his front, back, sides, and so forth. Attempts to capture the subject in any sort of photographic medium yields a heavily distorted figure.\n\n\nExposure to SCP-639 causes extreme eyestrain and mild paranoia, with subjects reporting \"not knowing if he was coming or going, or what he was even looking at.\" Effects do not persist once SCP-639 is removed. It should be noted that SCP-639 observes the whole of the world in the same fashion that it observes him (that is, all objects are apparently seen from all angles at once), which seems to have caused extreme paranoia as well as a host of associated mental illnesses.\n\n\nSCP-639 was recovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Texas, from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 County Mental Hospital. Subject was under the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who alerted the Foundation May 12, 20\u2588\u2588. SCP-639 was picked up by Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588, under the guise of a medical transfer. Class C amnestics were administered to staff. SCP-639 was transferred to Site-\u2588\u2588 where he is currently being kept.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Following interviews by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588.\n\n\nInterview Log 639-A\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-639\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n Initial Interview with SCP-639.

Thinks that the interviewer is not real unless physically present to be seen, but as that causes serious visual and mental stress to the interviewer, I do not recommend it.\n\n\nNote:\n I was wrong. Just facing away from it seems to negate the visual stress, although interviewing someone while facing away from them is\u2026 awkward.
