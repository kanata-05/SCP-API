Foundation security personnel have been assigned to monitor and intercept civilians attempting to access SCP-2539.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2539 is a 3.1 kilometer stretch of road located near Rhodehampton, New South Wales. Individuals who attempt to traverse SCP-2539 in a motor vehicle will disappear after having travelled five hundred meters, and later reappear at the other end of SCP-2539 between seven and eight hours later. After returning, said individuals typically show signs of severe dehydration and heatstroke, even when provided adequate supplies to prevent this.\n\n\nThose affected by SCP-2539's primary anomaly report having travelled down SCP-2539 for the full duration of their disappearance: all reports involve them stopping for a figure named \"\nMiriam Wells\n\". Descriptions of its appearance match that of highway patrol officer Miriam Wells, who disappeared in late 2009 on a routine patrol. She is usually described as wearing civilian clothes and attempting to ask subjects for directions.\n\n\nIn a minority of observed cases, subjects report being able to convince the woman to join them in their vehicle. All such subjects later find a piece of heavily scorched and decomposed human flesh in the storage compartment of their vehicle. The source of this is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2538\n | SCP-2539 | \nSCP-2540\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2539\n\" by Taffeta, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
