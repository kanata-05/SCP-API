SCP-5968 begins to manifest with advertisements reading \u201cHave a stellar meal at the Starlight Diner. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Starseed way.\u201d, hereby designated as SCP-5968-1. These advertisements originate by growing through the cracks of sidewalks, roads and brick walls and appear to be biological in makeup with the texture of copy paper. Once fully formed SCP-5968 will appear at the address of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Starseed Way.\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-5968 is painted a washed beige on all walls, with a popcorn ceiling lit by fluorescent lights and a black and white checkered tile floor. Seating in SCP-5968 is provided by red and yellow wooden tables surrounded on their sides with cushion booths. The dimensions of the building change constantly but usually fall between 5m-15m wide and 20m-170m long, with a constant height of 3.5m, SCP-5968 is always a hallway, possessing no kitchen or bathrooms, only a door at the end of the hallway with a plaque reading \"\nManager\n\" in gold lettering. SCP-5968 is populated with humanoid entities, hereby designated SCP-5968-2, roughly two (2) meters tall with an absence of facial features with the exception of a painted-on smile. These entities are covered in dry, heavily dimpled skin and wear neon yellow jumpsuits that resemble nylon in material. In place of hands SCP-5968-2 instances possess large fleshy clam like appendages that regurgitate ordered items from SCP-5968's menu. SCP-5968's menu items range from regular items to the extraterrestrial and anomalous and change daily; said items do not have prices however tips are happily accepted in the form of solid matter. The menu appears in the reader's native tongue and in Braille for blind customers.\n\n\nPatrons of SCP-5968, hereby designated SCP-5968-3, include a variety of extraterrestrial and extra-dimensional creatures, many able to understand most human languages and none hostile.\n\n\nSCP-5968's menu:12/19/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEffect Upon Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuban Sandwich\n\n\nItem made in the stack order from bottom to top of: grilled Cuban bread, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, three (3) dill pickle chips and a dollop of honey mustard.\n\n\nD-33231 felt full.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlokvidashi Flank\n\n\nItem tested near identical in genetic makeup to the \nHomo denisovan\n species of early human. The sample is that of an infant Denisovan leg slow-cooked and dressed with Asian black bean sauce.\n\n\nD-33231 reportedly enjoyed the food remarking, \u201cIt tastes like chicken\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolok's Faou\n\n\nSubject served a plate of opaque white gelatinous cubes, weighing in at exactly one (1) kg.\n\n\nAfter three (3) bites D-33231's hair turned a shade of bright blue and they gained a set of pyrokinetic abilities lasting approximately sixteen (16) minutes, after which D-33231 passed out and woke up speaking an unknown click-based language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFairy Dust\n\n\nSubject served two (2) grams of a white powder, a direct match for C17H21NO4 or crack cocaine.\n\n\nD-17776 jumped on a diner table, ran up to an SCP-5258-2 instance, kissed the entity on its smile, announced \u201cNo time to play, Johnny \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a business boy!\u201d, then fainted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMango\n\n\nItem was a mango of the Alphonso variety.\n\n\nD-61222 enjoyed the sweet treat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynomite Lionfish\n\n\nSubject served a fried lionfish filet glazed in Dynomite sauce.\n\n\nD-61222 remarked on the sweet, filling nature of the filet. Fifteen (15) minutes after consumption D-61222 exploded, causing interior damage to his holding cell. Traces of uranium and plutonium were found post-analysis in D-61222's blood, leading researchers to believe the dish was a prepared instance of the \nSCP-5632\n subspecies of lionfish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrilled Latabros Breast from Tau Ceti f\n\n\nSubject served a portion of meat in a sirloin cut. The meat is dark blue in color and secretes a black sweat. The sample appeared biological and carbon-based however possessed no DNA.\n\n\nD-001238 described the meat as tasting like mud and pepper and likened its texture to that of a soggy wood block. Upon trying to separate the meat into chunks D-001238 found a ticket with writing in an unknown script similar to ancient Sumerian. D-001238 picked up the ticket and disappeared in a flash of bright yellow light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Interaction Logs with SCP-5968-3 Instances\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0LOG:\u00a0SCP-5968-3-\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0LOG:\u00a0SCP-5968-3-\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance:\n SCP-5968-3-\u03b8\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5968-3-\u03b8 is a ball of heptagons made of solid bars of photons.

The entities locomote via a network of vines extended from beneath the inside of their bottom eyelid, and secure themselves in the same fashion.\n\n\nInteraction Account:\n These entities do not respond to any stimuli, but do appear to convey their orders to SCP-5968-2 instances through blank stares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded Addendums\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0A:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Tip\u00a0with\u00a0Currency\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0A:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Tip\u00a0with\u00a0Currency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon being tipped with $7.53 in pocket change an SCP-5258-2 instance encased D-32789's hand with its clam-like appendage. Once removed D-32789's hand appeared permanently tattooed with a similar tattoo to the smile on instances of SCP-5968-2's faces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0B:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Tip\u00a0with\u00a0Gold\u00a0Bullion\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0B:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Tip\u00a0with\u00a0Gold\u00a0Bullion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon being tipped with eight (8) ounces of gold bullion the waiting instance of SCP-5258-2 sucked the material into its clam-like appendage then after 0:45 seconds elapsed the appendage spat out a key made of said eight (8) ounces of gold, hereby designated SCP-5968-4, that when used on any door with a lock, allows user passage into SCP-5968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0C:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Ask\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Manager\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0C:\u00a0Attempt\u00a0to\u00a0Ask\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon D-30009 asking an instance of SCP-5968-2 to speak with the manager they were handed a 4cm x 6cm card reading \"He's dealing with a problem in sales\".

Tango moves forward, brushing past one of the SCP-5968-2 entities and revealing the Manager's door.\n\n\nTango:\n \"Reporting surroundings: Interior of SCP-5968 appears five meters in widths and fifteen meters in lengths. Four booths, three empty one filled, and the manager's door is visible. Requesting further command.\"\n\n\nA transmitter clipped to Tango's belt beeps, clicks then sounds \"Approach an instance of SCP-5968 and ask to see the manager.\"\n\n\nTango:\n \"Lima, adhere to command, ask the instance to see the manager.\"\n\n\nLima:\n \"Sure thing T.\"\n\n\nLima walks up to the closest instance of SCP-5968-2 and asks to see the manager to which the instance responds \"He's dealing with a problem in sales.\"\n\n\nTango:\n \"Typical response given. Requesting further commands.\"\n\n\nThe transmitter activates once again, sounding \"Data received, proceed with minimal force.\"\n\n\nTango:\n \"Alright men on my command we rush the managerial office.\"\n\n\nEcho:\n \"Got it.\"\n\n\nLima:\n \"Roger that cap'n.\"\n\n\nTango moves into approaching stance and signals Echo and Lima.\n\n\nTango:\n \"3-2-1.\"\n\n\nThe agents begin running towards the door and although footsteps can be heard, the manager's door does not come any closer into frame. After stopping in confusion tango turns around to reveal the team has traveled a considerable distance. A voice calls out to the team through newly manifested ceiling intercoms relaying the message \"Please be seated, your order will be taken immediately.\"The team persists for another minute, and eventually more steps of footsteps can be heard. Tango looks over her shoulder revealing the two instances of SCP-5968-2 catching up to them from behind.\n\n\nTango:\n \"Shit! I think they're trying to stop us.\"\n\n\nEcho:\n \"You think?!\"\n\n\nLima:\n \"We've gotta find a way to bring the door closer to us! You know, we aren't makin' progress and tweedle dee and dum are high on our tails.\"\n\n\nTango:\n \"I might have an idea, hold them back.\"\n\n\nLima and Echo disappear out of frame, rustling can be heard as Tango retrieves a grappling hook from her utility belt. Tango tosses the rope and it wraps around the handle of the manager's door. She begins pulling herself closer to the door and it does not pull away, around one meter from the door Tango turns around to see Echo and Lima being forced into a booth by the two instances of SCP-5968-2. Tango's transmitter sounds \"Proceed\", and she turns around and enters through the door. The camera feed goes white for three seconds before adjusting to reveal an empty white void containing only a wooden desk decorated with several phones from a variety of decades and other unidentifiable devices. At the desk sits a mound of grey, opaque slime covered in tan fedora-style hats. From the mound sprouts sparkling tendrils of dust picking up and answering the phones, speaking in a myriad of voices and languages.\n{Figure hereby represented as SCP-5968-5}\n\n\nSCP-5968-5:\n [In the voice of an old english man, a young Scottish woman and Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]The Aretha Franklin albums!
