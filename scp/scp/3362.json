Biological and memetic countermeasures are to be put into place to restrict access to Level 3 supervisors or approved handlers.\n\n\nOnce a week, a member of D-class personnel is to be selected to view SCP-3362. The selection process is to include a background check to ensure that the subject has no ties to any Groups of Interest, organized crime rings, or any other group where they could hold a position of authority. Viewing of SCP-3362 is to be presented to subjects under the guise of testing; in order to facilitate this facade, subjects are to be shown a non-anomalous copy of \nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\n and instructed to note any differences between it and SCP-3362.\n\n\nObservation of this testing is to take place in monitoring rooms placed appropriately so that observing personnel cannot make visual contact of any kind with the screen displaying SCP-3362. As a precaution, only research assistants fulfilling the following conditions are allowed to supervise testing:\n\n\n\n\nHas a clearance level of Level 1 or less.\n\n\nHas a salary of less than 65,000 yearly.\n\n\nIs subordinate to Researcher Evereds, who is understood to be directly subordinate to SCP-3362-1.\n\n\n\n\nA redundant chain of command is to be maintained to reduce the impact of Eta Incidents. The HMCL Supervisor of SCP-3362, currently Dr. Jack Simpson, is considered the superior of SCP-3362-1. A redundant \u201cHMCL Director\u201d is considered the superior of Dr. Simpson, a \u201cMaterials Director\u201d is considered the superior of the HMCL Director, and Project Head/3362 is considered the superior of the Materials Director. After an Eta Incident, the HMCL Director will be demoted to HMCL Supervisor, the Materials Director will be demoted to HMCL Director, and a new member of Foundation personnel is to be selected to take the position of the Materials Director.\n\n\nThe current instance of SCP-3362-1 is Dr. Laurel Shepherd, who will look at the audience and give the standard \u201cOK\u201d signal at all times. Any major deviations in behavior are to be reported to the HMCL supervisor.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3362 is a VHS tape of the 1946 movie \nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\n. It is physically indistinguishable from a non-anomalous copy of the tape.\n\n\nThe primary anomalous properties of SCP-3362 manifest when viewed. SCP-3362-1 is an individual that appears in viewings of SCP-3362. SCP-3362-1 is able to interact with the scene, though no deviations in dialogue or plot has been reported. It is confirmed that SCP-3362-1 is conscious and fully aware of its current situation.\n\n\nThe secondary anomalous effects of SCP-3362 activate when viewed by a human subject. If the subject is of a higher economic, social, or political standing than SCP-3362-1, they will spontaneously disappear five to ten hours after first viewing SCP-3362. In subsequent viewings of SCP-3362, the subject that disappeared will replace SCP-3362-1. Two to four hours after this disappearance, the previous instance of SCP-3362-1 will reappear in the vicinity of the former location of the new instance of SCP-3362-1.\n\n\nThe tertiary anomalous effects of SCP-3362 activate when it is not viewed by any human subject for a period of one month. At this point, an Eta Incident will occur. SCP-3362 will lose its anomalous properties, and the superior of SCP-3362-1 at the time of the Eta Incident will disappear. Of the visual media currently owned by the supervisor, one will become the new instance of SCP-3362, with the supervisor as an instance of SCP-3362-1. It is of note that the previous instance of SCP-3362-1 will not reappear after an Eta Incident.\n\n\nIt is believed that, following Eta Incidents, SCP-3362 tends to relocate itself to Christmas movies produced before 1980.\n\n\nAddendum:\n History and Discovery\n\n\nSCP-3362 was originally recovered after the disappearance of Mr. Sherrams, an office worker for the Adacron corporation. After his disappearance, Officer Williams took the original instance of SCP-3362, believed to be a VHS tape of \nThe Star Wars Holiday Special\n, and eventually viewed it himself, becoming the next instance of SCP-3362-1. It was speculated that these disappearances were related, and the Las Vegas Police Department began to investigate this phenomena.\n\n\nRoughly one month after the start of the investigation, Detective Sheryl was reported to have disappeared while investigating a potential lead. This was interpreted as a deliberate action of the party that was responsible for the disappearances, and Sheryl\u2019s assets were seized as evidence.\n\n\nThe Foundation was alerted to the presence of SCP-3362 when the chief of police of the Las Vegas Police Department viewed SCP-3362\n1\n during the course of the investigation and became subject to its secondary anomalous effects, resulting in his spontaneous disappearance. MTF Gamma-7 (\u201cRed Herrings\u201d) administered amnestics to all appropriate civilians and officers and confiscated security footage of the event.\n\n\nFurther testing elucidated the anomalous properties of SCP-3362. However, due to improper handling during testing, Dr. Redmond became the SCP-3362-1 subject.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident 3362-8\n\n\nA catastrophic containment breach on 09/05/2008 caused Site-45 to become inaccessible for several weeks. During this period of time, SCP-3362 underwent an Eta Incident, leading to the disappearance of Dr. Carrion, a Level 2 supervisor monitoring testing for several SCP objects, and the relocation of SCP-3362 to a VHS tape of \nFrosty the Snowman\n. SCP-3362 has since been relocated to Safe-class Site-49, due to the low possibility of a containment breach.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident 3362-9\n\n\nAfter a scheduled viewing session of SCP-3362, D-4578 spontaneously disappeared. Testing with D-5572 confirms that D-4578 had become the next instance of SCP-3362-1.\n\n\nA later background check of D-4578 revealed that he had connections to the American Mafia, and during his time with the group, he had amassed a considerable amount of influence and offshore wealth.\n\n\nDue to the American Mafia\u2019s lack of cooperation in the containment of SCP-3362, an Eta Incident was allowed to occur for the purposes of experimentation. However, the next instance of SCP-3362-1 was Global Occult Coalition Director Claras, who was later determined to have connections to the American Mafia.\n\n\nThe Global Occult Coalition then discovered SCP-3362, and attempted to destroy it. However, this triggered an immediate Eta Incident that caused the disappearance of Dr. Grayson, a director of the GOC\u2019s PHYSICS department. The Foundation then purchased SCP-3362, now a VHS tape of \nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\n, from the GOC for a sum of 500,000 USD.\n\n\nSPECIAL ADDENDUM 3362.1:\n Incident 3362-Omega\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOn 04/10/2018, O5-10 retired from their position due to stress. However, they volunteered to become an instance of SCP-3362-1, in order to test what would occur during an Eta Incident to a person without a supervisor.\n\n\nOn 05/10/2018, an Eta Incident occurred, though no instance of SCP-3362 could be found. At first, it was thought that SCP-3362 was neutralized. However, it is believed that this event had implications that are not within the grasp of the current Foundation.

        "Addendum: History and Discovery\nSCP-3362 was originally recovered after the disappearance of Mr. Sherrams, an office worker for the Adacron corporation. After his disappearance, Officer Williams took the original instance of SCP-3362, believed to be a VHS tape of The Star Wars Holiday Special , and eventually viewed it himself, becoming the next instance of SCP-3362-1. It was speculated that these disappearances were related, and the Las Vegas Police Department began to investigate this phenomena.\nRoughly one month after the start of the investigation, Detective Sheryl was reported to have disappeared while investigating a potential lead. This was interpreted as a deliberate action of the party that was responsible for the disappearances, and Sheryl\u2019s assets were seized as evidence.\nThe Foundation was alerted to the presence of SCP-3362 when the chief of police of the Las Vegas Police Department viewed SCP-3362 1 during the course of the investigation and became subject to its secondary anomalous effects, resulting in his spontaneous disappearance. MTF Gamma-7 (\u201cRed Herrings\u201d) administered amnestics to all appropriate civilians and officers and confiscated security footage of the event.\nFurther testing elucidated the anomalous properties of SCP-3362. However, due to improper handling during testing, Dr. Redmond became the SCP-3362-1 subject.",
        "Addendum: Incident 3362-8\nA catastrophic containment breach on 09/05/2008 caused Site-45 to become inaccessible for several weeks. During this period of time, SCP-3362 underwent an Eta Incident, leading to the disappearance of Dr. Carrion, a Level 2 supervisor monitoring testing for several SCP objects, and the relocation of SCP-3362 to a VHS tape of Frosty the Snowman . SCP-3362 has since been relocated to Safe-class Site-49, due to the low possibility of a containment breach.",
        "Addendum: Incident 3362-9\nAfter a scheduled viewing session of SCP-3362, D-4578 spontaneously disappeared. Testing with D-5572 confirms that D-4578 had become the next instance of SCP-3362-1.\nA later background check of D-4578 revealed that he had connections to the American Mafia, and during his time with the group, he had amassed a considerable amount of influence and offshore wealth.\nDue to the American Mafia\u2019s lack of cooperation in the containment of SCP-3362, an Eta Incident was allowed to occur for the purposes of experimentation. However, the next instance of SCP-3362-1 was Global Occult Coalition Director Claras, who was later determined to have connections to the American Mafia.\nThe Global Occult Coalition then discovered SCP-3362, and attempted to destroy it. However, this triggered an immediate Eta Incident that caused the disappearance of Dr. Grayson, a director of the GOC\u2019s PHYSICS department. The Foundation then purchased SCP-3362, now a VHS tape of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life , from the GOC for a sum of 500,000 USD."
