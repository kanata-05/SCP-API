Entrance to Site-7733-B is visible in the foreground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Civilians are not permitted within 100m of SCP-7733, with toxic long-term soil contamination in place as a cover. Due to limited scheduling slots, use of SCP-7733 is limited to SVIC members.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7733 is an electronic device taking up most of the interior space of a 2700m\n2\n storage facility (Site-7733-A) located in Qaqortoq, Greenland. It is primarily constructed from electronic components commercially available in the year 1974, although it also includes a number of cold cathode semiconductor switches of unknown origin.\n\n\nHuman operators may interact with SCP-7733 from inside a 10m\n2\n room (Site-7733-B) attached to the outside of Site-7733-A, containing a punched paper tape interface feeding in and out of Site-7733-A. When an operator enters information\n1\n describing a specific real or hypothetical set of conditions and a possible event that could occur within them (a \"query\")\n2\n, after a period ranging from 5 seconds to 19 hours\n3\n SCP-7733 will output one of three possible responses:\n\n\n\n\n\"\nAdditional Data Requested\n\": SCP-7733 will specify information not included in the initial query. After the operator has entered this data, or rejected the request, SCP-7733 will output another response.\n\n\n\"\nOut of Bounds\n\": Confirmation that empirically-available data is insufficient to calculate the probability of the event\n4\n, concluding the query.\n\n\n\"\nCalculation Complete\n\": The calculated probability for that event to have taken place, under assumed conditions of consensus reality, reported in units of Drustons (Drst) up to three decimal points, concluding the query.\n\n\n\n\nThe Druston unit appears to serve as a unit measuring the unlikeliness of the event. In simplistic queries, it is seemingly based on a logarithmic expression of the probability ratio. It is unknown if this pattern still applies in queries where conventional estimation is not possible. Calculations over 200000.000 Drst have never been observed, indicating a possible upper limit for SCP-7733's calculations.\n\n\nOperators may not enter a new query until SCP-7733 has concluded the current query, further limiting the frequency of use. SCP-7733 is able to store information from queries internally, and will refer to it in replicated or similar queries rather than requesting information a second time.\n\n\nSCP-7733's methods of calculating or estimating probability, including the initial ability to interpret queries, are currently unknown. As SCP-7733 cannot operate when foreign objects are present in the same chamber as the components, very little is currently known about how the device functions, although the exceptional complexity of function and ability to operate over decades without maintenance suggests anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\nSampled Testing Documents (Translated):\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\u00a0Testing\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Testing\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\nQuery 7733-09\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conditions:\n A single atom of fermium-259 exists within a vacuum.\n\n\nQuery Event:\n That atom has decayed after exactly 1.5 seconds.\n\n\nAddition Data Requests:\n None\n\n\nQuery Conclusion:\n \nCalculation Complete - 1.003 Drst\n\n\nEvent Outcome:\n Not tested in reality\n\n\n\n\nQuery 7733-23\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conditions:\n A United States 1 cent coin is thrown into the air by Research Assistant Aleia Cole from floor level in an arc approximately 1 meter high.\n\n\nQuery Event:\n The coin will land and settle on the floor with the heads side facing up.\n\n\nAddition Data Requests:\n\n\n\n\nThe position of Research Assistant Cole's hand while gripping and throwing the coin (Granted)\n\n\nThe year of production of the coin (Granted)\n\n\nHistory of previous tosses of the coin (Denied, Not Available)\n\n\nThe construction material and condition of the floor (Granted)\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conclusion:\n \nCalculation Complete - 0.998 Drst\n\n\nEvent Outcome:\n The coin landed with the heads side facing up.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 7733-24\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conditions:\n A United States 1 cent coin is thrown into the air by Research Assistant Aleia Cole from floor level in an arc approximately 1 meter high, in a replication of the previous query.\n\n\nQuery Event:\n The coin will land and settle on the floor with the heads side facing up.\n\n\nAddition Data Requests:\n None\n\n\nQuery Conclusion:\n \nCalculation Complete - 0.998 Drst\n\n\nEvent Outcome:\n The coin landed with the tails side facing up.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 7733-119\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conditions:\n The weather of Mount Hood National Forest, in Mount Hood Oregon\n5\n is observed continuously every day for 12 weeks from a specific point within the glacial valley.\n\n\nQuery Event:\n A cloud formation with a strong visual resemblance to a member of the infraorder Anisoptera\n6\n will be visible each week on Thursday at 15:04 PDT.\n\n\nAddition Data Requests:\n\n\n\n\nInitial humidity, wind and atmospheric pressure (Granted)\n\n\nWeather forecast for the remainder of the 12 weeks (Granted)\n\n\nLocation and angle of observation site (Granted)\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conclusion:\n \nCalculation Complete - 1583.776 Drst\n\n\nEvent Outcome:\n A cloud of that description was visible each week, at the time described and from the specific viewing point, for at least 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 7733-7057\n\n\n\n\nQuery Conditions:\n Research Assistant Houston Carver will make a set of personal purchases at a grocery store, using a debit card.

        "[00:00:00] SVIC-133 9 takes attendance and formally commences the 95th SVIC Meeting. [00:38:33] SVIC-133 begins by announcing new or updated AAP validations: A total of 119 new AAP were validated: 49 below the abnormality threshold and 70 above. A total of 527 AAP validations were replicated: 512 remained within the same approximate range, 14 10 significantly increased, and one significantly decreased. AAP-p16i3 11 (associated with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-EX 12 ) decreased from 44109.139 Drst to 30013.711 Drst after SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-EX made three consecutive incorrect predictions, in addition to the two failed predictions prior to the 94th SVIC Meeting. As a result, AAP-p16i3 is now considered non-anomalous, and no longer requires investigation, surveillance or containment. [00:45:17] SVIC-133 restores order after an outburst from SVIC-316 13 and vocal conflict between SVIC-316 and SVIC-198 14 following the announcement of AAP-p16i3 's updated validation and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-EX's consequently updated object class. [00:48:43] SVIC-133 opens floor to statements by other SVIC members prior to voting. [00:50:09] SVIC-198 receives the microphone, and begins a prepared speech about the importance of defending consensus reality through a low abnormality threshold 15 , but is interrupted by outcry from multiple other members. SVIC-198 abandons their script, and attempts to defend their successful proposal during the 94th SVIC Meeting to lower the abnormality threshold 16 in order to maintain AAP-p16i3 's category. [01:03:26] SVIC-198 cedes the remainder of their time to SVIC-347 17 . SVIC-347 formally proposes that the abnormality threshold be decreased to 43811.019 Drst, recategorizing 14 existing AAP as anomalous, and SVIC-198 seconds the proposal. [01:05:59] SVIC-316 receives the microphone, and presents a series of transparency slides comparing the rate of recategorization following the raising and lowering of the threshold, in order to demonstrate the historical reliability of a higher abnormality threshold. SVIC-316 formally proposes that the abnormality threshold be increased to 47636.300 Drst, recategorizing 5 existing AAP as non-anomalous, and SVIC-284 18 seconds the proposal. [01:28:40] SVIC-038 19 receives the microphone, and attempts to show a presentation relating to the financial impact of recategorization, but cannot retrieve the necessary files from their flash drive. SVIC-038 formally proposes that the abnormality threshold remain unchanged, and SVIC-110 20 seconds the proposal.
