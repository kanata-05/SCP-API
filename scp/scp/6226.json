It uses its attached oars to ambulate through the water. It is very friendly with personnel and will float along the edge of its enclosure following anyone passing by its fence.\n\n\nAddendum-6226.1 Anomaly Transferral:\n\nDue to the Boring Agreement, since SCP-6226 was discovered in Crater Lake, it is planned to be transferred to GoI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions) for documenting and care. A full document from WWS is expected upon its arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Email\u00a0Relations\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\u25a3\u00a0Email\u00a0Relations\u00a0\u25a3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Tim Wilson\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Jerimiah Greene\n\n\nSubject:\n New Anomaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have come into the possession of a new anomaly.

Quite docile. He even likes to follow around our staff when they come to greet him! I will attach a photo of the enclosure he is currently being kept in. I'm not really sure why we've put the fence around there, it's not like he's planning on going anywhere!\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jerimiah Greene\n\nSCP-6226 Head Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcceAttached Image:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Jerimiah Greene\n\n\nFrom:\n Tim Wilson\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:New Anomaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat news. We haven't had many birds some in our doors for a while. Everyone's very excited to meet him! I'm especially intrigued as I've been wanting to care for a Shoebill for quite a while. I've also come up with a name, Eddie!\n\n\nThat enclosure seems a little small. We've picked out a nice roomy habitat for him. We suspect he'll love it! The enclosure is nice, but I do wish we could see his smiling face! Speaking of Eddie, what anomalous properties should we be expecting?\n\n\n\n\nTim Wilson\n\nWWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Tim Wilson\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Jerimiah Greene\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:New Anomaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere isn't much you'll need to worry about vis-\u00e0-vis anomalous traits. My only gripe about him is he doesn't need to eat or sleep (His squawking could get a little loud during the night!). But for the most part, he's just like a baseline shoebill. I've packed a copy of the full documentation we have on him (including some wonderful photos from our on-site amateur photographer that are just so lovely) along with him in the truck we're sending him to you in.
