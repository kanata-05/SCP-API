The 247\nth\n sample is under indefinite evaluation at the Site-87 research facility. Due to natural degradation, location, and/or several decades of nuclear testing conducted by the USSR, further containment of SCP-7307-1 is deemed unnecessary.\n\n\nAll media containing depictions of SCP-7307-2 has been expunged from public record. \nAn agreement between the Foundation, Roscosmos, and NASA has been reached to classify the existence of SCP-7307-2. The Alabaster-Reece Observatory is tasked with tracking SCP-7307-2.\n As of 1974/02/23, SCP-7307-2 no longer requires containment procedures.\n\n\nDue to the size and location of SCP-7307-3, direct containment has been deemed unfeasible. A remote observation unit utilizing Poseidon.aic has been installed to monitor SCP-7307-3 for any activity. The USS \nMorpheus\n is to perform a yearly manned investigation of SCP-7307-3.\n\n\nAny change in the status of SCP-7307 is to be immediately reported to Dr. Wallace of Project Lighthouse at Site-87.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-7307 is the collective designation for several anomalous events and objects initially discovered on 1945/07/16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo SCP-7307-1 instances, 1947/06/22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7307-1 are 246 spherical formations consisting of ice, soil, and bedrock with diameters ranging from .5 - 5.6\u00a0km. These objects spontaneously appeared in Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan starting on 1945/06/16 and ending on 1975/11/24. Analysis of core samples indicate that all SCP-7307-1 instances originate from Semipalatinsk, but did not form from existing materials found at the location. The sites at which each SCP-7307-1 instance was discovered, as well as each core sample tested, registered a unique concentration of Boerhiemer Radiation\n1\n, indicating a probable extra-universal origin for these phenomena. An additional 143 SCP-7307-1 instances were detected and are theorized to exist 4.8\u00a0km underground in the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico.\n\n\nSCP-7307-2 is a 3.4\u00a0km ovaloid structure consisting of various inorganic and organic components including but not limited to: sand, metal, fauna, asphalt, concrete structures, substratum, flora, glass, and wood. SCP-7307-2 is surrounded by a cloud of oxygen, nitrogen, helium, natural gas, propane, water vapor, and approximately 26,000 human corpses.\n\n\nSCP-7307-2 is currently orbiting Earth approximately 400,000\u00a0km from the Exosphere and has a trajectory which will eventually remove it from Earth's gravitational influence; estimated to occur between 1970-1980.\n On 1974/02/23, SCP-7307-2 was incinerated by the Sun and no longer exists. Samples collected by a Foundation probe prior to its incineration indicate the place of origin to be Hiroshima, Japan circa 1940-1950.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7307-2, circa 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective view of SCP-7307-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7307-3 is the island of Cuba, including topsoil, flora, fauna, structures, ~7 million humans, and substratum; compressed into a complex array of non-euclidean overlapping cubes that is partially embedded in the bedrock of the Atlantic ocean. SCP-7307-3 originates externally of Prime Reality and poses no threat to the inhabitants of Cuba. All further information regarding the contents of SCP-7307-3 is classified Level 5/7307 and can be acquired through approval of a Project Lighthouse supervisor.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral location of documented SCP-7307-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first instance of SCP-7307-1 was discovered by Senior Lieutenant Aset Sultanov on 1945/06/16 while travelling to Moscow. Upon arriving at Kustanay station, Sultanov contacted Soviet military command and explained the phenomena. On 1945/06/18, a Soviet military convoy and several scientists arrived to investigate the SCP-7307-1 instances. Though initially considered to be some form of German subterfuge, the response team was unable to definitively ascertain its origin. Two weeks after its initial discovery the Foundation was contacted by a liaison within the Kremlin to assist with the investigation and concealment of the phenomena. In accordance with the Beria Compromise\n2\n, the USSR officially took control of nearly 18,000\u00a0km\u00b2 of land surrounding the initial instance to be used in the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Foundation was regularly updated on the SCP-7307-1 phenomena until its conclusion in 1975.\n\n\nSCP-7307-2 was initially detected by researchers at the Alabaster-Reece Observatory\n3\n on 1950/04/14, though visual confirmation could not be ascertained until 1952/11/26. In conjunction with visual confirmation, the distinct Boerhiemer Radiation associated with SCP-7307 was registered and Project Lighthouse began its investigation. Though discovered in 1950, it is theorized, based on the extent of radioactive decay, that SCP-7307-2 originally entered Prime Reality shortly after the SCP-7307-1 instances began to appear.\n\n\nOn 1962/10/18, Atlantic Research Substation 4 detected a surge in Boerhiemer Radiation 3.6\u00a0km from the Puerto Rico Trench. Due to the Cuban missile crisis\n4\n, Foundation facilities in North and Central America were operating under emergency standby procedures and could not immediately investigate the disturbance. Subsequent to the conclusion of the crisis, Project Lighthouse in conjunction with the crew of the USS \nMorpheus\n began a three-month excavation and exploration of SCP-7307-3. All further information regarding the contents of SCP-7307-3 is classified Level 5/7307 and can be acquired through approval of a Project Lighthouse supervisor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Lighthouse Report Summary \u2014 1965\n\n\nThe reality in which SCP-7307 originates is officially designated Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25; a stable reality with near identical laws of physics to Prime Reality. Though limited in primary resources, Project Lighthouse has learned of several deviations in human history, specifically surrounding the actions of the USSR and United States of America, including their inability to achieve nuclear fission. The heightened political instability between these two countries, as well as the open use of anomalous weapons, has led to Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25 being deemed a potential threat to Prime Reality.\n\n\nProject Lighthouse speculates that a series of events leading to mutually assured destruction within Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25 would instantaneously initiate a XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario on Prime Earth.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Lighthouse Report Summary \u2014 1968\n\n\nOn 1968/01/12\u00a012:32 GMT, local reality sensors at Site-51 alerted Project Lighthouse liaisons to a surge in Boerhiemer Radiation\n5\n from within the local SCiPNet server room. The following conversation took place over SCiPNet at 12:33 GMT between Researcher Liam Wilkerson\n6\n and an unidentified User who is presumed to be Liam Wilkerson of Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25. The terminal was remotely overridden by the director of Project Lighthouse, Dr. Wallace.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n| Unidentified User: Hello\u2026 are you seeing this Liam?\n\n\n| Unidentified User: Please I don't have much time\u2026\n\n\n| Wilkerson10471: Who is this?

SCP-7307-1a is a spherical mass measuring 2.3\u00a0m\n3\n, consisting of a human corpse\n7\n and various other materials commonly associated with a Foundation workstation. The instance was sequestered by Project Lighthouse for testing and is to be stored indefinitely at Site-87.\n\n\nComputer analysis technicians were able to transfer the received file into a readable format type. It is unknown if the data was corrupted due to this process or from exposure to Boerhiemer Radiation.

In response to the inevitable threat, an emergency meeting of the Ethics Committee and O5 Command led to the establishment of the Nexus Protocol. An ultimatum would be presented to President Kennedy and Premier Kosygin before the initiation of Nexus Protocols; this choice was to be delivered by Dr. Michael Wallace, director of Project Lighthouse\u2014 through a SCiPNet sever.\n\n\n\n\n[[ACCESS GRANTED]]\n\n\n[[CONNECTING TO TERMINAL John001]]\n\n\n[[CONNECTION TO TERMINAL \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u04391]]\n\n\n[[CONNECTION ESTABLISHED]]\n\n\n|Wallace00098: Hello, my name is Dr. Michael Wallace, I from what you know as Universe 16.18.9.13.5. I am here on behalf of the SCP Foundation of my world in order to bring you a proposition.\n\n\n|\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u04391: What is the meaning of this Kennedy, what have you done?\n\n\n|John001: Aleksey, I assure you that we had nothing to do with this.\n\n\n|Wallace00098: At approximately 02:00 our time, we had a mobile task force enter your reality with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and they released it into your atmosphere.\n\n\n|\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u04391: I know not the meaning of this and I grow tired of this intrusion. I have no time for pendo conspiracy.\n\n\n|John001: I've already told you\u2014 this ain't us. You and I both know what we've done to their world, we always knew this time would come.\n\n\n|Wallace00098: Right, as you said, the time has come to answer for your indiscretions. You are about to receive a file, I suggest you look it over, have your people check it's authenticity.\n\n\n[FILE TRANSFER SUCCESSFUL]\n\n\n|John001: You wouldn't\u2026 This isn't even, how do you have this?\n\n\n|Wallace00098: As I said, we don't\u2014 it's been released into your atmosphere.\n\n\n|\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u04391: What are your demands?\n\n\n|Wallace00098: You are to stop using the Boerhiemer devices, entirely, their impact on our world has been deemed a risk we are not willing to take. Any living civilians from our universe are to be returned through a dimensional fault of our choice; then all currently know dimensional faults will be mended effective immediately. There will be no further contact between our worlds; if you want to wipe each other off the map, so be it, your just not going to take us along with you.\n\n\n|\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u04391: And if we refuse?\n\n\n|Wallace00098: Then we will flip the switch and effectively atomize your entire planet. Mr. Kosygin, we are not playing games anymore\u2014 this has gone far enough.\n\n\n|Wallace00098: As we both are aware Mr. Kennedy, this won't exactly effect you in the same way. But we doubt you'd want to preside over a planet of cosmic dust.\n\n\n|John00098: I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n\n|Wallace00098: Of course you don't. Regardless, this is our proposition. You both have one hour to reach an adequate compromise\u2014 if one is not reached we will carry on as planned. You will be hearing from us shortly.\n\n\n[Wallace00098 DISCONNECTED]\n\n\n[FILE RECEIVED - UNKNOWN FILE TYPE]\n\n\n[CONNECTION LOST]\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Kennedy and Premier Kosygin signed a binding contract formally known as the Nexus Accord; declaring a permanent cease to Boerhiemer weapon development, testing, and use. A de-escalation program will be initiated within both countries and all current Boerhiemer devices will be dismantled.
