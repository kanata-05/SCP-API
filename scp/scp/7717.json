Permanent containment of SCP-7717 is currently considered plausible but not of upmost priority.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7717 is an apple of unknown cultivation that appears at random on Foundation-made photographic material and documents. SCP-7717 does not show any signs of change in colour, decay, or loss of condensation on its surface.\n\n\nSCP-7717 has to date not been observed directly or on non-Foundation records. Because of this it is unclear if SCP-7717 is only memetic, physical, or both as in some scenarios it cannot be discerned.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7717 was discovered on March 4\u00a01973, during digitalization of older files. Over 2000 photographs, video logs, or other material showed an apple with the same pattern in the background. Because of the modernization in technology and the ease of making digital records, SCP-7717 observations have increased exponentially after implementing controls of its presence on Foundation material.\n\n\nAddendum 7717.1:\n Observations of SCP-7717\n\n\nData omitted for brevity.

A significant amount of classified files have been edited to remove the anomaly.\n\n\n\nFiles where removal was unsuccessful were remade and scanned for the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 August 1985\n\n\nA document with a memetic hazard was accidentally printed.
