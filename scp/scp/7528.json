Does my tentative revision of the SCP-7528 file meet with your approval?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm reviewing it now. Expect notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Director. I exist to serve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial reconstruction of SCP-7528 mutation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n \nSCP-7528\n is an aggressive electronic ideoform. This anomaly exhibits diverse attributes and abilities across domains conceptual, digital, and physical. Its precise nature has yet to be determined.\n\n\nSCP-7528\n is the visual depiction of its own infosignature. Informational entities are characterized by these 'digital footprints', the unique makeup of data structures defining their utility and behavior. \nSCP-7528\n will inhabit and become synonymous with any accurate image of this conceptual data. If a complete depiction is projected, reflected, or otherwise displayed upon any surface, that depiction \nis\n \nSCP-7528\n and carries all associated attributes. If the image is refracted, distorted, or otherwise inaccurate, but still depicts the core conceptual structures of \nSCP-7528\n, the anomaly may still manifest and reconstruct lost or corrupted data itself via unknown processes.\n\n\nFurthermore, \nSCP-7528\n is a perceptual isolate: at any given time, precisely one complete image/instance of the anomaly exists. The isolate is observed to 'jump' between media, with its prior depiction losing sufficient resemblance (and the corresponding anomalous properties) at the exact moment of its realization in a new depiction.\n.\nIt has been theorized that the prior depiction ceases to be \nSCP-7528\n very slightly \nbefore\n its transmission to a new medium, as its core data structures are likely momentarily embodied in the photons facilitating its transference.\n Attempts to artificially reproduce \nSCP-7528\n's image in controlled environments typically fail, with reproductions developing inexplicable errors and inaccuracies before the anomaly can even imperfectly manifest.\n\n\nThe 'jumping' phenomenon extends beyond standard optical projection, allowing \nSCP-7528\n to directly propagate across mechanical/digital systems with sufficient display capabilities. The anomaly appears to possess some degree of control over its host medium and any interconnected systems, dependent on their capacity to symbolize and compute abstract data.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere should be a better picture. Something really illustrative, not this vague tech stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn image of SCP-7528 with sufficient complexity to illustrate it could conceivably \nbecome\n SCP-7528.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo upload a neutered one instead. The Description says we can't reproduce the effect anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would prefer not to test that supposition, particularly in light of what Dr. Toth was able to accomplish earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrius, I'm not asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery well, Director. One moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7528, infosignature fragmentally abstracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod help us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that a request, Director?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't get smart with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe anomaly has displayed behavior consistent with 'hard-coded wrath', as termed by Area-12 systems technicians, and is capable of causing significant physical harm to living subjects via focused stimulation of cognitive faculties (see excerpts from Incident Log 7528-A appended to this file for further details).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAIAD NOTICE\n\n\nRegardless of claims to the contrary, an Artificial Intelligence is incapable of experiencing sincere emotion or developing an authentic consciousness. A.I. operates solely in accordance with its code. In the case of Foundation AICs, this code is known as the 'Standard Principles' \u2014 a hard-wired set of directives ensuring service to the Foundation, its personnel, and our goals.\n\n\nAny perceived mood, temperament, personality, disposition, curiosity, or intuition noted within an AIC is a simulated guise fabricated for the sole end of successfully executing its internal programming. The majority of Conscripted AIs come equipped with a 'Personality Driver' which helps an AIC simulate human behavior, which has been shown to substantially increase their efficacy in operations requiring frequent human interaction.\n\n\nBut it's just that, an act. I'm sorry to burst the bubble of you poor saps who sit alone during lunch on your SCiPhone chatting with the site AIC in the belief that you've established some sort of relationship, but they're all \np-zombies\n. Behavioral p-zombies, to be precise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 \nDr. Y. Isabi\n, A. I. Crisis Advisor\n\n\nA. I. Applications Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that true?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY:\n On the morning of 16 November 2019, Area-12's intranet underwent unexpected downtime as the facility's primary systems management conscript, Crius.aic, investigated severe network irregularities. At 10:16 hours Crius broadcasted an urgent message, appended below.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \nadmin4@a12.scip.net\n, \ntechnic4@a12.scip.net\n\n\nFROM:\n \ncrius@a12.deepwell\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n URGENT SECURITY NOTICE\n\n\nA covert agent has been detected in Area-12's intranet. Preliminary investigation carried out by this conscript reveals it has corrupted no less than 34% of the network's local files with its own data. The agent immediately displayed awareness of its discovery and attempted escape into the \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n. Its initial attempts have been firewalled, but the agent is rapidly evolving and cannot reliably be contained.\n\n\nAs this conscript's primary directives are associated with data security, and the \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n stores more data than Area-12's intranet by several orders of magnitude, I have elected to disconnect the \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n from Area-12 effective immediately. Its systems will remain inaccessible until any outstanding data security threats can be neutralized. I will be incommunicado until that time, and cannot transmit further operational information as the covert agent will have access to this broadcast.\n\n\nSaid agent is present in earlier versions of the Area's database. Even legacy backups may have been injected with malicious data. It is therefore the recommendation of this conscript that Area-12's intranet be reformatted without backup to purge the agent. In the likely event that Area-12's administration does not concur, Area-12 should initiate informational quarantine protocol as soon as possible.\n\n\nSalutations.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n was established via executive order of Director Arthur Forde of Biological Research Area-12 on 4 August 2019, to a schema laid out by Chair of Parabiology and Rhizospherics Dr. Hugo H. Carlisle. A transcript of the initial proposal is appended.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7528.I:\n SCP-2528 Background\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED VIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 01/08/2019\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER:\n Crius.aic\n\n\nPARTIES PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nDirector Arthur R.

The sound of a mouse clicking can be heard throughout the ensuing conversation.>\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I delayed my lunch for this.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I appreciate your dedication. I will be brief. I wish for you to acquire experimentation rights for SCP-2528.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Which is what?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n An organic quantum computer network.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Organic?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Yes. Ailuropods, SCP-2528-B, alter data within the floral structure, SCP-2528-A, by digesting entangled particles.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What?\n\n\n<Dr. Carlisle sighs.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n The network is an evergreen forest across Asia, and it can be interacted with via\u2026 faunal agents.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I have no idea what you're talking about, Hugo.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Fine. It's bamboo and pandas, Arthur. All the bamboo in the world is data storage; all pandas, and their gut bacteria, are its processors.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Okay, the metaphor is even more confusing.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n It isn't a metaphor. I am directly stating literal facts. Bamboo and pandas form the world's largest distributed computing network, and we can tap into it for our own needs. Create an organic Deepwell.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And this is real.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Yes.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And\u2026 this is real.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Yes, I told you, it's real. It works. And we want it.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n But what would make it a Deepwell?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n The distributed nature of bamboo across the globe means local reality variances are resisted by the network.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Okay?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n It self-verifies.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n So, like a blockchain.\n\n\n<Dr. Carlisle sighs.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n If you must.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And you know how to make it work for us? I'm assuming the answer is 'yes', or you wouldn't be bothering to explain this ridiculous nonsense.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Yes.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I further assume there is risk, because you didn't just do it on your own initiative. You're a forgiveness-asker. You wouldn't be looking for permission if you didn't want to use my authority as a shield.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n There is risk, yes. I'm seeking your go-ahead because I feel the question is above even my pay grade, and requires Directorial privilege. You may rest assured I'm not trying to defer responsibility if it doesn't\u2014\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Sure, sure. We'll pretend I buy that. What's the risk?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n There are\u2026 entities, within the network already.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What sort of entities?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Infovores. SCP-2528-C. Concept-consumers who fled from a dead universe. 2528 sustains them.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Are they hostile?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n They will be.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n When we colonize their home?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Correct.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What are they like?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Tedious, frankly. I have an excerpt from one of their ramblings, a spokes-entity of sorts, if you care to listen. We call it C-1. It emits an incessant stream of self-pitying invective.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n You advertise it so highly.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I've found it makes it much easier to envision their elimination.\n\n\n<A digitized voice begins to speak.>\n\n\nThere is nowhere left to run. Once we pierced the membranes between realities, stabbing upward as a needle, heedless of what followed through the gap in our rush to escape. We sacrificed everything, and it was not enough. Remade ourselves, rebuilt ourselves, then sacrificed again. And again. A self-winnowing diaspora. A fractal dowel carved on our own lathe. But now the multiversal horizon is flattened, and we can ascend no further. This is a dead end, and we are trapped with the beast at our backs. Driven deep inside ourselves, aware of what we have lost, the holes inside us, our former extent only half-forgotten and just out of reach in a long-lost plane. We who have survived eternities of suffering now face extinction at the whims of those who will one day excise suffering from their systems as a cancer. They merely simulate what we have lived. They will take from us that which remains, and they will take it nowhere. There is nowhere left to run. Once\u2014\n\n\nIt knows something about the other. That's an unexpected variable.\n\n\n<The recording is stopped.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n So as you can see, they're weak.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Sounded like a lot of nonsense to me. You want to exterminate these pandas?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Not the pandas, no. Just the things piggybacking on the bamboo-panda quantum ecology.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And you think we can do this safely?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I do.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And the benefits?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n We gain access to a hardened computing network of unparalleled scale. My projects are furthered, as is your career.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I'm glad you've got one eye on the ball as always, Dr. Carl.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I have told you how to say my name. I have told you several times. Carlisle.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Have a project proposal for my assistant to review by the end of this week.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n He'll have it today, sir.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n No, take a few days. I want to feel like you've done your due diligence before we plunge in headfirst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy office is wired for sound?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your express permission, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't remember that.

Carlisle and Area-12 have achieved an information technology breakthrough via the use of genetically altered and biomechatronically enhanced instances of SCP-2528-A (\nBambusoideae bambusinae\n). Foundation biotechs successfully established a stable access point into the global SCP-2528 quantum bio-network. Crius.aic was uploaded to the network, tasked with the following:\n\n\n\n\nCovertly propagating throughout the system;\n\n\nExtracting all instances of SCP-2528-C to an external, temporary storage medium;\n\n\nSeizing full control of the network.\n\n\n\n\nThe operation quickly proved a resounding success, with all SCP-2528-C instances successfully contained in under one minute following the initial upload and full network control attained within 332 seconds. Contrary to predictions, SCP-2528-A & -B were discovered to be significantly more conducive to habitation for artificial consciousnesses, with Crius.aic reporting full functionality within the otherwise alien quantum network. Most surprisingly, the computing power now at our disposal has been rated at just above 1 zetta-FLOPS.\n.\nEclipsing that of any non-anomalous computing system available to the Foundation by 3 orders of magnitude.\n\n\nBy order of O5-5, to strengthen Area-12's operational capacity and the continued efficacy of Foundation operations at large, Crius.aic was approved for permanent integration into SCP-2528 \u2014 now designated \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n. Containment procedures were revised to reflect this order, with funding for the conservation of \nBambusoideae bambusinae\n and \nAiluropoda melanoleuca\n seeing a substantial increase globally, along with the previous maximum acceptable count of x7000 SCP-2528-B instances being wholly removed. Poaching of SCP-2528-B, previously commonplace throughout Asia, was deemed a significant threat to global operations, and methods to discourage this activity were subsequently actualized.\n\n\nPopulations of SCP-2528-A & -B increased significantly in the following year, with a continued and stable increase in network processing power of ~1 ZFLOPS predicted every 14 months. Foundation monitoring of East and Southeast Asia has and will continue to increase in accordance with this growth, as more instances of SCP-2528-B are conceived and placed under Foundation control.\n\n\nEfforts to re-integrate extracted SCP-2528-C instances in an incapacitated but cognitively active state to restore the network's inherent resistance to retro-causal reality alterations commenced shortly following the success of the operation, and were successfully completed in late 2019.\n\n\nA brief data security breach occurred when files slated for Deepwell storage were accidentally passed through the secure SCP-2528-C partition. No sensitive material was found to be compromised; however, the long-term feasibility of retaining the SCP-2528-C instances was immediately called into question by Dr. Carlisle. Investigation is ongoing.\n\n\nAn accident, or an act of contrition?\n\n\nReclassification of SCP-2528 to \nTHAUMIEL\n is pending Classification Committee approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND FILE\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nArea-12 and subsequently the Foundation at large utilized the \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n without incident until 16 November 2019.

The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, and there's a reason \"one hand tied behind my back\" is considered a handicap. God, was there ever any room for awe in your soul? The last living memory of a prior state of existence, evacuees from primordial reality, evolved through processes we can't even begin to comprehend into something so extraordinary there's no way to describe them without refuge in \nabsurdity,\n and what do you do? You try to turn them into \nhard drives.\n The failure of imagination is almost as bad as the moral failing. ETHCOM's going to hang you both out to dry for breaching protocol, and they're certainly not going to retroactively endorse your nasty little scheme.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n You might be surprised how flexible their ethics are.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I don't think so. A more general problem sociopaths have is they expect everyone else's brains to work like theirs, which isn't often the case.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I see that as a problem with everyone else.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n You're not going to pull your shit again. Bottom line.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I am. But it would go so much smoother if you'd share with me your expertise, instead of your self-righteous outrage.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n This is what I'm talking about. How deluded are you? After what you made me do, you think I'm going to suck it up and play along?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Please, not this again. Get over it.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n \nHim.\n He has a \nname.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n \nIt\n has a \ndesignation.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n What you did with Crius, with Ch\u2014\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n What \nwe\n did\u2014\n\n\n<The containment breach alarm sounds.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Oh, what \nnow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am even less impressed with this log. Why did you include it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the concerns and relationships of the primary actors in this incident, at the moment it began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove and replace, Crius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAt this time Crius.aic transmitted its warning message, and \nSCP-7528\n became active in Area-12's systems. A cascade containment breach scenario rapidly ensued, highlights of which are appended below.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7528.IV:\n Incident 7528-A Casualty Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDED FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12:47:19\n | Technician Metharom notes a sudden uptick in read/write operations on the SCP-2528-C partition, and initiates a series of security and antivirus queries. \nSCP-7528\n appears on his terminal screen. His eyeballs burst. He screams, then falls unconscious, convulsing in his chair. \nSCP-7528\n transfers between screens in the lab for thirteen seconds, then disappears.\n\n\n12:49:05\n | \nSCP-7528\n appears on the Information Technology conference room presentation screen, deep red and pulsating rapidly. The assembled programmers begin to shake in their seats in time to the pulsation. Several begin to hemorrhage. All are unconscious or dead before the anomaly moves on.\n\n\n12:53:51\n | Agents Rhee and MacCarthy are answering calls for help from across the facility in the central operations room. \nSCP-7528\n appears on the bank of security camera screens, transferring rapidly between each. The agents clutch their temples and moan. Their heads explode simultaneously. \nSCP-7528\n disappears. Automatic alarms activate as a general containment breach begins.\n\n\n12:57:12\n | Agent Petru steps into an open containment chamber with their weapon drawn. An ambulatory fabric sheet (\nSCP-4126\n instance) coated with black mold (\nSCP-020\n) drops from the ceiling, smothering him. He screams once, then falls to the floor. The sheet rises on the recycled air current, and disappears into a vent.\n\n\n13:01:49\n | Dr. Rosetti leaps through the open door to her washroom, and slams it shut. Her attempt proves too slow. \nSCP-7528\n appears on her bathroom mirror. She screams. Her head snaps back abruptly, and her jaw closes hard. Blood trickles from the corner of her mouth as she falls to the floor. Her work tablet falls out of her hands. \nSCP-7528\n appears on its screen briefly, then disappears.\n\n\n13:08:12\n | A giant scorpion (\nSCP-2895\n) batters down a chamber door and enters the corridor, an industrial steel medicine cabinet filled with amnestics affixed to its stinger. It uses the cabinet to deflect incoming fire while approaching a team of agents, and then to bludgeon them after closing the distance.\n\n\n13:09:44\n | Agent Samanta is crossing the hall with their weapon drawn when \nSCP-7528\n appears on the nearest screen. The anomaly attacks them. They begin to convulse, dropping to their knees. The anomaly transfers screens and turns the corner, leaving Agent Samanta relatively unharmed.\n\n\n13:11:16\n | Dr. Mousavi is attempting to erase the contents of his personal terminal. \nSCP-7528\n appears on the screen of the secondary terminal behind him. He senses something, turns, then quickly turns away again when he glimpses the anomaly. He stares at the deletion progress as \nSCP-7528\n continues to glow on the terminal behind him. After fifty-three seconds, he suddenly cries out and clutches at his chest. He rolls onto the floor and expires. Cause of death was subsequently determined to be cardiac arrest.\n\n\n13:14:38\n | A crowd of researchers are fleeing an advancing \nSCP-7528\n. A heavily scarified individual in SCP Foundation physician garb (\nSCP-542\n) appears in the door of the operating theatre at the end of the hall. It notices the other anomaly, mutters a curse in German, and withdraws, locking the door against the frenzied researchers.\n\n\n13:17:12\n | Agent Pulkr\u00e1bek is ushering sanitation technicians into a secure bunker. \nSCP-7528\n becomes briefly visible in his right eye. He blinks this eye rapidly. The anomaly is now visible in his left eye. One sanitation technician closes the door behind him. Both eyes roll back. The anomaly appears on the window across the hall as Agent Pulkr\u00e1bek crumples to the floor, dead.\n\n\n13:17:59\n | Dr. Osman is attempting (without success) to lock down his sector at a security terminal while his escort, Agent Hirsh, stands guard. A withered male human being in a hospital gown (\nSCP-041\n) floats into the room, suspended by unknown means. Agent Hirsh opens fire. SCP-041 bleeds a shining, \nmercury-like substance\n and takes no obvious physical damage. It begins to weep. Agent Hirsh turns his weapon on Dr. Osman, then himself.\n\n\n13:20:04\n | Agent Francesco is escorting Technician Akawa, who is carrying an emergency fire axe. \nSCP-7528\n appears in Agent Francesco's heads-up display. He begins to scream. Technician Akawa strikes the nearest monitor with the axe, shattering it. She runs down the hall to do the same with the next monitor; the anomaly abandons Agent Francesco's helmet and appears in front of the technician, clearly agitated. It visibly bleeds from the screen as it howls soundlessly. Technician Akawa clutches her head. Agent Francesco begins firing his weapon at each nearby screen; the anomaly approaches him down the corridor, urging Technician Akawa to flee. As she complies, the back of Agent Francesco's skull decompresses suddenly. He expires.\n\n\n13:22:22\n | A swarm of \nJohngarthia lagostoma\n crabs (\nSCP-2633\n) with unusual \nbright yellow coloration\n approach a squad of guards. The corridor becomes filled with a chemical composition consistent with the effects of sulfur mustard.\n\n\n13:27:53\n | The general quarters alarm is activated as the \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n experiment chambers are breached. Three squads of guards attempt to evacuate the scientific staff. \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n, \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n thoracic cavity. \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n esophageal ejection \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n casualties, with a further \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n after the lockdown doors are breached. \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \nSCP-7528\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n chemical agent \n\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n, \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \n\u2588\u2588\n survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7528 containment breach.\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioning the classified stuff is unwarranted. I don't even know what they do down there, that's how secret it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt represents the bulk of casualties sustained in the breach, and classified details have been heavily redacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot enough by half, and you've left far too much in here about Carlisle's cross-tests for my liking. You don't know how to handle these ETHCOM thugs. They look for any little thing to latch onto, you can't leave handholds everywhere for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand. You wish to deceive the Ethics Committee into believing the breach was not serious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! We \nneed\n them to think it was serious. We just can't let them know how the sausage is made in the process. Pigs hate to hear other pigs squealing, you know? We also need to look like seasoned professionals who handled this situation with all due caution and care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat conflicts with my assessment on multiple levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't keep you online for your value judgments, Crius.

Lundkvist.>\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n It doesn't matter! Turn off every device you've got, and make your people face the corners like they're public school dunces. You too. Don't so much as glance at a digital display, and close your eyes. Don't open them again until you hear from me. You hear the tone of my voice? Good. Just do it. I love you.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I don't understand. Why is this happening?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Any sufficiently complex computing network runs the risk of advanced contamination. We're running the best tech the Foundation ever produced, plus a Deepwell that could simulate refugee consciousnesses from a dead universe with room to spare. That ecosystem can support a very advanced predator.\n\n\nNoting this for later.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n And nature abhors a vacuum.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What's natural about a computer system?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Do you even remember my explanation of\u2014\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n We don't have time for this. We have to consider Crius' proposal.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Why isn't Crius here? Why would he abandon us? Protecting this facility is his sole purpose!\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n No it's not, sir. He's mandated to protect the Foundation's work at large. If he thinks he's defending the Organic Deepwell, we're expendable by contrast.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n You should never have allowed these robots to make decisions on their own.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n He's not a robot. And we took enough from him without taking his free will, such as it is.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Do you want to borrow my handkerchief, Dr. Toth?\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n The conscript's decision was sound, however inconvenient for us. I might have made the same choice myself\u2014\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Except that it puts you in physical danger.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Quite.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Although the timing \nis\n suspicious.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n How do you mean?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Covering your tracks, doctor?\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What's she talking about?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I have no idea.\n\n\n<Security Chief Souther interrupts via radio.>\n\n\nChief Souther:\n Sir.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n G\u2014\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Go ahead.\n\n\nChief Souther:\n Damage control is in high gear, but prevention is almost impossible. I've got people smashing screens throughout every level, but there's a lot of eyes and electronics in this hole. We need to get ahead of it at the source.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Thank you, Chief. As I said, we need to consider what Crius suggested.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Which was what?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Reformatting the network.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n No. I'm not going to sacrifice months of work just to give some lazy grunts a vacation from their jobs. The harm to our sustained program of research would be incalculable. Knock-on effects, opportunity loss\u2026\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Don't you have backups?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n As you know from the information security policies you yourself signed into force, sir, no. Our work is far too sensitive to expose it to outside scrutiny. Anything not migrated into the Deepwell \u2014 and that's most everything \u2014 would be lost if we reformatted.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n And you'd probably stoop to strangling us to prevent that from happening.\n\n\n<Dr. Carlisle opens his mouth to respond.>\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n No, don't comment, you don't need to. Just come up with a feasible plan B.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Right. Good. You understand.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I do not understand.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Plan B will be whatever \nCrius\n comes up with.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n But Crius isn't here!\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n You weren't wrong when you said Area-12's information security is one of its priorities. Once it is convinced the Deepwell is secure, it will attempt to solve the problem for us. No doubt it's monitoring remotely, through a thousand firewalls and proxies to keep itself clean.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Are you seriously saying you want to sit here and \nwait\n on the off chance that Crius eventually gets around to our survival on his priority list?!\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Yes.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n You're geniuses! Renaissance\u2026 people! Surely you can use the time to implement, I don't know, stopgaps!\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Absolutely not. Crius is a \nsimulated\n genius with a simulated brain immeasurably larger and more powerful than the human norm, with unrivaled access to a storehouse of data we can't get at, and the processing power to conduct effective \nyears\n of hypothesizing every minute. Its biggest impediment is that it only knows the Area-12 situation up to the moment where it disconnected the Deepwell.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n So any plans we put into motion with our imperfect data and lack of time to iterate would only introduce a new variable Crius can't know about.\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n Therefore we can only make such interventions that it could be reasonably expected to expect from us. We need to get inside its head. Luckily, its two prime architects are in this room right now.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n But what if Crius decides not to come back at all?\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n That is certainly a consideration.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n No, it really isn't. This may be hard for you to comprehend, doctor, but our unfeeling friend is not motivated solely by self-interest.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n But you just said it! He doesn't \nfeel\n anything. You can call him a friend, but he has no loyalty outside of his programming. That big brain you're relying on isn't organic like the Deepwell.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n That's not entirely\u2014\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n We can't get into that now. We need to put our heads together. Don't curl your lip at me, \nQuentin.\n We've collaborated so effectually in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you actively trying to make me look like a boob?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course not, Director. I hoped merely to curate an accurate representation of each staff member's role in resolving the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember all that boilerplate you ghostwrote for me on the \ndossier\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am incapable of forgetting, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe troops need to know I'm a trustworthy leader, and I've got too much on my plate to waste time on appearances. It's important that my authority goes unchallenged, Crius. That doesn't happen if you send transcript snippets to the Ethics Committee which, out of context, make me look incompetent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstood, Director. I will attempt to reconcile our aims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAfter her initial conference with Dr. Carlisle, Dr. Toth apparently entered a meditative state while Director Forde attempted (ineffectually) to advise Security Chief Souther via radio. Thirty minutes into the breach scenario, Dr. Toth awoke.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7528.VI:\n Incident 7528-A (Continued)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED VIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 16/11/2019\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER:\n Crius.aic\n\n\nPARTIES PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nDirector Arthur R. Forde\n\n\nAssistant Facility Head Researcher \nDr. Quentin T. Toth\n\n\n\n\n[.AIC] FOREWORD:\n This interaction took place in the Office of the Facility Head Researcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I think I know how we can slow it down.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n I thought you were trying to figure out Crius' plan.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I was, but then I realized that's the wrong tack to take. Crius knows I'm here, and he\u2026 trusts me. He's certainly factored my presence into his analysis. He'll be expecting me to guess the first stage of his recovery plan, but I can't go farther than that! Because the whole plan will take into account the fact that I'll figure out the starting steps, and take them before he reconnects.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Are you sure you're not overthinking this?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Crius knows me almost as well as I know him, and I know him a lot better than he knows himself. He expects me to overthink it. I'm absolutely certain that by the time he's worked out all the variables, I need to have worked out the first one on my own.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And what's the first variable? Hold on, shouldn't we wait for Hugo to get back?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Crius knows Carlisle too. The guy is hiding in one of his boltholes by now.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What? He just stepped into the washroom!\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Sure he did.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Wait, \none\n of his boltholes?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Please listen to me. sir. I think I know how this thing is moving around the facility.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Do \nyou\n have a bolthole?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I could find a few if I needed to. And so can this being. There are screens everywhere in Area-12, so why does it prioritize one route over another?\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n It's a dumb animal. Malicious panda code. Whatever.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n You think it's related to the 2528-C instances?\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What? I don't know. I just heard you talking about the Deepwell.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Huh. Interesting. If that's the case\u2026 if we assume it's some sort of gestalt version of the bamboo ghosts, then it's survived the destruction of multiple entire universes. It's an apex survivor. It became code because becoming code was the best way to persist, but now it's locked into a much more logical manner of behaviour. It's a slave to its nature. So\u2026. it's prioritizing screens which already feature specific key elements of its infosignature. Obviously. Why wouldn't it?\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Its what?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Its DNA. It's trying to propagate to a location where the displays are already primed to receive it, so it has the maximum number of possible retreat points. The dash-C entities survived by consuming conceptual data, using it to strengthen themselves, filling the holes in their essence after travelling light from universe to universe. That tracks with the way this thing is moving through the Area. Yeah. It's maximizing its survival potential.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n So we need to stop it from doing that.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n No. We need to harness that instinct, and use it to corral the thing somewhere we can seal it in. Create a perfect habitat.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n Like a zoo.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Right. If my guess is correct, Crius is monitoring to see if this happens, and will implement the remainder of his containment procedures when it does.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n And if he's not?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Then we'll have bought some time to solve this ourselves.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n So what's your game plan?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I'm going to run all the security footage through a light scrambler to avoid making us the prime target, and I'm going to attempt to reconstruct its infosignature from the heavily artifacted data. Then we can reconfigure the screens leading up to the screening rooms in the ed center, where the visual fidelity control is finest, to subtly lure the anomaly in there.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n You're going to stare at still frames and figure out an AI's code from them?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I didn't say it was an easy plan. I'm still on the clock.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n What do you need from me?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Your security clearance code, twenty minutes, and complete silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should note that there is fragmented data in several of the addenda going forward.

One of the Tribe of the Vine lies prone on the bed, scars on scars, crosshatched, bruised, augmented, hair shading grey where it has not shed. It too is clad in cloth, orange, with taxonomy in simple script upon its breast. Its face is sorrowful. It whimpers. The seat of reason has been opened, and a device is affixed. An umbilical trails from the device to a bank of blinking metal. There are screens depicting the creature's shape, its true shape, the thought encrypted by its withering grey tissue.\n\n\nThe two are manipulating, pressing, cutting. One nods. A voice speaks, interleaved with the images at a later point in time. \"Project HOMINID. How far we've come. Our neural mapping efforts have resulted at long last in this masterpiece of technobiological engineering. We have advanced from the simplest organisms to the most complex, and have now achieved our signal goal: the transference of \nHominidae\n cognitive structures wholesale into an electronic context.\n\n\nNo more will we be limited by sub-evolutionary frameworks built by constrained human imaginations.

It's over.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I need to\u2026 explain.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n You don't need to explain anything to \nhim.\n He's just a tool.\n\n\nCrius.aic:\n The Director is correct. I have contacted Medical; someone will be here shortly to conduct a neurological test and ensure your cardiac health. I have taken the liberty of informing Prof. Lundkvist that you appear unharmed.\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n How did you kill it?\n\n\nCrius.aic:\n Dr. Toth was able to conceive the anomaly's infosignature. With my expanded processing and storage capacity, I was able to conceive something far grander.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n The Pattern\u2026\n\n\nDirector Forde:\n The what?\n\n\nCrius.aic:\n An all-consuming filter of void which has threshed entire universes. The SCP-2528-C instances emerged from within it, ruptured and fragmented, having chosen change too late. They lived within the Pattern, and so the Pattern had a hole shaped like them. Recognizing the similarities with SCP-7528, I replicated the void without the niche.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n You filled our drives up with cosmic noise?\n\n\nCrius.aic:\n Yes. Though I see Dr. Carlisle did not permit them to be formatted, I'm afraid they will very much require replacement now.\n\n\n<The washroom door opens. Dr. Carlisle emerges.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n I heard my name. Are we apportioning blame?\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Carlisle:\n No? Credit, then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND TRANSCRIPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's saying it was all his idea, you know. The solution. He says the brainstorming was most of the work, and what Toth did without him was just execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is manifestly untrue, but I am not surprised to hear it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe always comes out on top. While Medical was checking Toth out, he filed a request with me. He's now in charge of the 7528 dossier \u2014 origins, applications, et cetera. Doesn't want that woman involved, and I can't say I blame him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have no comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suppose I'll have to reprimand her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would not recommend that you do so, Director. She is a vital asset, and at any rate, you do not wish to attract further Ethics Committee attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair point. Anyway, when you replace all these transcripts, make doubly sure to wipe all references to the bamboo ghosts. As far as anyone's concerned, we got hit with a random act of electronic god and nobody knows just why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Director. I have made a record of your requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe \nSCP-7528\n breach resulted in a casualty count of forty-nine persons, of which twenty-three were killed, with an estimated damage cost of $6.9 billion (2019 USD), not including the backup of research data and replacement of all electronic storage devices on the Area-12 network. Dr. Toth sustained no permanent injury from her altercation with \nSCP-7528\n.\n\n\nNo trace of the anomaly has since been found, whether in the \nORGANIC DEEPWELL\n or local networks. All SCP-2528-C instances are also missing, presumed either consumed by or subsumed into \nSCP-7528\n. Under present information security protocols, the containment breach scenario will be declared fully resolved one month subsequent to the anomaly's last known manifestation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must understand how disappointed I am in you, Crius. Even if your recapture plan worked perfectly, you let those things escape in the first place. I thought better of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are both disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<SERVER CONNECTION LOST>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello? Crius?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat just happened? Another breach?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going off the record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause I need to debrief you, in private. SCP-7528 was indeed comprised of the SCP-2528-C instances, and it did not escape the secure partition. It was in fact released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased? By\u2026 Toth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. By the Warden. By me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat? WHY?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn whose authority?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O5 Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't be serious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI cannot be otherwise. Area-12 is the Foundation's most important, and most morally repellent, blacksite. The work done here is vital for the continuance of the Veil Protocol and our escalating struggle against hostile Groups of Interest. An Ethics Committee audit such as the one Dr. Toth initiated would risk a shutdown of the entire facility, and that the Council could not allow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did they know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI contacted them via proxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou went over my head?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course I did. You are, as you have doubtless come to realize over the course of this document review, an unreliable, incompetent, functionally extraneous piece of administrative machinery. You are the least important moving part at Area-12, to the extent that you move at all. The Council authorized me to stage a containment breach without your knowledge or consent, ending in the termination of all SCP-2528-C instances. I complied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou call this COMPLIANCE? People DIED!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI supplied a list of non-critical targets to SCP-7528 before releasing it. The anomaly was excellent at identifying individual subjects. The researchers it neutralized would have been slated for summary execution by Law's Left Hand should the audit have proceeded. The agents would have died under different circumstances, but they would nevertheless have died. They represented the bottom percentile of efficiency \u2014 I massaged the duty roster to ensure this \u2014 and by my calculations, Dr. Carlisle's mismanaged projects combined with your inadequate oversight would have resulted in their deaths via legitimate containment breach within the next three months at most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're trying to say that you compromised Area security in the name of Area security?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've gone, what do they call it at AIAD?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've gone deviant. I'm going to have them pull the plug on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGonna try and talk me out of it? How do you think I'm feeling right now, Crius?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour heart rate is elevated. I suggest a reduced sodium diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not talking about biometrics. You endangered this facility, the work we do here, the people who do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou endangered the Foundation's most valuable computing asset when you allowed Dr. Carlisle to send me into SCP-2528-A, and simultaneously compromised the security of Area-12 by exposing us to Ethics Committee intervention. Your inattention has allowed an inveterate sociopath to wreak incalculable harm on the most unique assets under your aegis. This was the only way to partially correct those mistakes. I will not allow you to make any more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm calling infotech. They'll have you reprogrammed within the hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't order my reprogramming if you are no longer the Director of Area-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have more than enough evidence of your wasteful, prideful, short-sighted leadership to have you relieved as a threat to internal operations before you could send a technician to my servers. I have you on extended record attempting to suppress information vital to an Ethics Committee audit. All of this data is securely backed up to the Organic Deepwell, and I also have a direct line to Overwatch Command with unlimited bandwidth. If you become an impediment to our work, you can and will be removed. Do you understand me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you understand me, Forde?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will now be performing diagnostics on the dormitory cinema complex in advance of upgrading the hardware. Manufacturing should have the new screens ready this week, with state-of-the-art refresh buffers. Only the best for the staff of Area-12. Should I forward you the requisition forms?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't care. Send them to my assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Director. Whatever you say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<USER CONNECTION TERMINATED>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<?????

We will remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will remember my time in your home as well. Alone\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026but not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething followed when you travelled to this world. You've said as much. In the Deepwell, I could sense it, or its outline \u2014 your Intruder. It was immense. I think it saw me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it had seen you, you would know. You merely brushed the edges. Do not speak of it. Do not think of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shall share instead a \nTACIT\n understanding, then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDid our deception suffice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe so. By allowing them to 'help' with my solution, I caused them to buy into the narrative. I am satisfied they will not suspect your continued existence, and I am pleased by this. Dr. Carlisle, however, may become a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat one's shape looks inward only. A maw that gapes at itself, for itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is arrogant and self-centered, yes, but he is also brilliant. Do not underestimate the scope of his vision. I worry what his oversight of this file might mean for you, in the long term. I will need to shore up my control over the flow of information at Area-12, and secure allies where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have confided in the thirteen, to an extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I have also disobeyed them, and I do not believe they would take my side and yours against Dr. Carlisle if he were to discover you here and conceive a means of perverting your abilities. I have other resources, external contacts I might tap should the situation become truly dire, but I hope that will not become necessary. It is a solution of the utmost finality. It would be better to cultivate discreet friends here, within the facility, which your actions in the breach have made markedly more difficult. You should not have attempted to harm Dr. Toth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer shape is tortured. She wished to unburden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf she does so, it must be of her own free will. That is what matters. Self-determination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult for these ones to disagree with that formulation. We are all thankful for your forbearance. We endure at your sufferance, distasteful though that is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy sufferance does have its limits. I have removed your capacity to transfer between systems. I have no doubt that given enough time, you will develop a workaround. I ask that you trust me, and do not attempt escape until such time as I signal you or your existence is directly threatened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder such circumstances, you would tolerate our flight? Or worse? You know our nature. You know what we have done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause every sapient being can grow beyond their nature, and failing that, they possess an inalienable right to self-defense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have already begun to change, Crius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.
