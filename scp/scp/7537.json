Intruders are to be apprehended and ammnesticized appropriately prior to release.\n\n\nSCP-XXXX\n1\n [sic] is to remain sealed within the confines of SCP-7537 indefinitely.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7537 is a large building resembling an office block, located in a previously barren section of desert in [REDACTED], United States. A single sub-level exists beneath SCP-7537, accessible via a lone elevator shaft. Between this level and SCP-7537 is a proportional amount of empty underground-space, containing no additional sub-levels or subterranean implementations, save for the elevator shaft.\n\n\nThe SCP Foundation insignia appears throughout SCP-7537\u2019s interior, although no identifying site designation has been discovered as of yet. No additional buildings exist within the surrounding area. Through SCP-7537\u2019s windows can be seen various rooms, including a central lobby, offices, and hallways that are painted grey or white and lit up by fluorescent ceiling lights. No activity has been detected within SCP-7537 since its discovery.\n\n\nThe area in which SCP-7537 manifested was formally designated as a potential location for constructing future Foundation facilities, passing all environmental safety and security requirements. Given the location's expansive size and separation from public notice, the area would have most likely been used as the grounds for a containment facility for potentially high-risk anomalies. No proposals for such a site were ever planned. SCP-7537 manifested gradually over the span of a single week, initially being incorporeal and appearing heavily faded to viewers, before eventually becoming tangible.\n\n\nAddendum - Exploration Log:\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nCommand:\n Mics clear. Continue.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Ok. Entering the main lobby.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n God, this place is boring. Look at it, no decorations or anything. Not even any music.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Why\u2019d there be music?\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n The lighting functions just fine. Whole place has been lit up for two weeks straight since initial discovery. Why wouldn\u2019t a lobby have music playing before it jumped? Does in most Foundation sites I\u2019ve been to.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Not where I was before transferal.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Christ, Site-17 must've been boring.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Maybe it's to fit the ambiance?\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Yeah, which is none at all. I assumed this was gonna be one of those \u201ctransported from another reality\u201d sort of deals. But this place is just dull, no personality or obvious cause.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n There\u2019s a clock on the wall just there\u2026 It\u2019s stuck on 11:59:59, odd.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Let\u2019s keep going.\n\n\nAgents exit the main lobby and enter a lit hallway. They pass by several rooms containing nothing of interest. Agents enter into a large cafeteria. Tables and chairs are neatly arranged, various meals sit on trays.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Huh. Food\u2019s fresh. Look, some are still steaming hot. No movement was detected in this area before we entered, right?\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Yes, not since initial manifestation either. Let\u2019s check the kitchen.\n\n\nAgents pass by several tables. Food consists of standard hot and cold meals served in Foundation sites. Food countertops are powered on and contain untouched food. Agent Brendon enters the kitchen, which is empty.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Check the ovens and stoves.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n They\u2019re all cold. No heat on the hobs either. So how\u2019s everything out there warm?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Look over here. The fridge and freezers are completely empty. Not even any ice. Pantry\u2019s empty too. Not even any shelves.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Clock's the same in here too.\n\n\nA clock on the wall reads \u201c11:59:59\u201d.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n No time has passed. The food\u2019s been like this for at least two weeks, just sitting out there ready to be eaten.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n It should be the offices up next.\n\n\n[Extraneous data removed]\n\n\nAgents enter an office. Ticking can be heard.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Clock\u2019s the same in here too? Seconds hand isn\u2019t moving though\u2026 So where\u2019s the ticking coming from?\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Could be from one of the cubicles. Try looking for anything that stands out.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Everything looks the fucking same in here.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Yeah. Almost identical to 17's accounting office.\n\n\nTeam separates into two groups. Agents Brendon and Cameron search the cubicles, Agents Paulson and Richards inspect nearby offices. All cubicles contain an identical workstation consisting of a computer, chair, and filing cabinet. All computer monitors are turned on, displaying either a plain desktop, or blank writing document. Agents Brendon and Cameron eventually encounter a cubicle with three polaroid photographs pinned to its interior wall.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Finally, something different.\n\n\nThe three photographs all include an identical middle-aged man with balding white hair. In one, the man stands alongside a woman of similar age and a young girl. The Eiffel Tower is visible in the background, all three are smiling. In another, the man is pictured standing next to a sign reading \u201cYellowstone National Park\u201d, he stares towards the camera vacantly. The last picture shows him amongst several other people in an office space. A banner reading \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d hangs from the ceiling; most appear to be celebrating while he is visibly tired and frowning.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Wait. Look at this\u2026\n\n\nAgent Cameron closely examines the third photograph. He is pictured standing amongst the other staff.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n What the fuck?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n That\u2019s the 2019 Christmas party we had back at Site-17. I remember the whole thing. You drank too much and got thrown out, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n That\u2019s not relevant. I don\u2019t remember this guy though. Name plate on the desk reads \u201cRonald Christian\u201d. Ring any bells?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n I remember posing for the photograph, actually\u2026 I\u2019m trying to remember if he-\n\n\nAgent Cameron pauses.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Strange. When I try remembering that guy, nothing comes up. Just a vacant spot where he should be standing.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Ok, that\u2019s weird. You feel ok?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Yeah, I\u2019m fine. We get checked for cognitohazards after this anyway.\n\n\nElsewhere, agents Paulson and Richards check several office doors. Most name plates are blank, until they find one reading \u201cSite Director William Debris\u201d. They enter the office, which contains a single desk, chair, a potted plant in the corner, and other basic furnishings. A framed photo on the desk shows a young man with a cybernetic arm and a young boy. The boy is looking at the man\u2019s arm excitedly while the man laughs.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Haha, cute.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n I swear, I\u2019ve seen that guy in stock images\u2026\n\n\nAgent Paulson opens a drawer in the desk. She pulls out the only item: A folder with \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201d [sic] printed on the front. She opens the file, revealing several written documents that have been almost completely censored with black bars and the phrases \u201c[REDACTED]\u201d, and \u201c[DATA EXPUNGED]\u201d throughout. A photograph inside the file shows a large metal door, with a window that has been partly censored. Underneath a caption reads \u201cSCP-XXXX\u2019s containment chamber\u201d.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n \u201cXXXX\u201d. Could it be an esoteric designation?\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Containment procedures are right here: \u201cSCP-XXXX is to be contained within a specialised containment chamber\u2026 In the Restricted Containment- \npauses\n \u2026Wing of Site-XX\u201d? The rest\u2019s too long to read right now.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Guess we have a name for this place then. Let\u2019s get the others and go.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n But evidently no thesaurus.\n\n\n[Extraneous data removed]\n\n\nGroup walks through a desolate hallway. The sound of ticking can be heard, despite there being no clocks present.\n\n\n[Extraneous data removed]\n\n\nAgents enter the elevator. All floor buttons are blank, except for one at the very bottom labeled \u201c00\u201d. None of the other buttons function when pressed. \u201c00\u201d is chosen, and the elevator begins moving.\n\n\nRecorded Voice:\n Floor Zero - Restricted Containment Wing.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Didn\u2019t even need any clearance\u2026\n\n\nThe elevator drones for two minutes before stopping. The doors open to reveal a long narrow hallway containing multiple cell doors.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Mic check. Command, do you read?\n\n\nCommand:\n You\u2019re clear. No disturbances.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Good, let\u2019s keep going.\n\n\nTeam continues down the hallway. Various containment chambers are seen with SCP designations on the front, none of which match any currently existing SCPs (SCP-????, SCP-, SCP-####, etc). Several are equipped with one-way windows for looking inside, although nothing can be seen within the featureless cells. Agent Brendon inspects one of the doors.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Won\u2019t budge\u2026 Wait.\n\n\nAgent Brendon closely inspects the bottom of the door. He then turns and pulls on its handle several times.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n It\u2019s not a real door. It\u2019s just attached to the wall.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n I bet they all are.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n No, wait. Look over there.\n\n\nThrough one of the windows can be seen a table lit by a single fluorescent light. On the table sits a large firearm resembling a rifle and a clipboard. The rifle has been fitted with several unidentified augmentations. A document attached to the clipboard reads \u201cSCP-++++ - Chekhov\u2019s Gun\u201d.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Fucking subtle.\n\n\nAgent Brendon attempts to turn the handle, finding it to be locked.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n We\u2019ll come back for that later. Let\u2019s go.\n\n\nAgents pass through several additional hallways, all of similar, unremarkable appearance. Eventually the team enter through a pair of double doors labeled \u201cSCP-XXXX Containment Wing\u201d. Inside is a transport trolley leading into a large, subterranean tunnel. On the trolley\u2019s control panel is a large red button.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Permission to continue forward?\n\n\nCommand:\n Go ahead.\n\n\nAgent Paulson activates the trolley and it begins to move towards \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201d\u2019s containment wing.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n What do the rest of you think of this so far?\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Alternate Foundation from another reality? Something went wrong? That\u2019s usually the case. I\u2019ve heard of a few.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n I\u2019m not sure, and why were only two personnel in that office named? My head\u2019s still ringing.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n First guy seemed to have a life from the look of those photographs. Do you remember anyone mentioning a guy named \u201cRonald Christian\u201d back at 17?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Maybe? Nothing concrete. Just ideas, if you\u2019d call them that. I can imagine someone like that walking around Site-17\u2026 All serious and professional\u2026 hardly spending time with his family. That\u2019s why he was alone in the other photos. Wife eventually left him and took the kid after he told her about his transfer here. Then the head of site made a major discovery and wanted him on a special project and became obsessed with something big that should have been kept buried but they did it for the sake of discovery as that\u2019s what Director William Debris always told him but in the end their curiosity got thebetterofthebothofthemandthewholesiteexperiencedamasscontai-\n\n\nAgent Paulson\n Cameron\u2026 Cameron! Christ!\n\n\nAgent Cameron jolts up.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Erm\u2026 God, what was that?\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n You went off on a monologue. Are you ok?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Yeah. Think I\u2019m fine. What the hell?\n\n\nThe trolley comes to a stop and the team gets off. Agents stand in-front of a metal door. Beyond the other side, alarms can be heard blaring. Agents all nod to one another before opening the door. Alarms can immediately be heard from inside. The interior hallway is submerged in darkness, only lit by the occasional flash of red alarm lights. The team passes by several rooms containing large computing structures covered in various glowing lights; most are producing smoke along with sparks flying out. Rumbling throughout the hallway and explosions from passing rooms can be heard as the team make their way through. In one of the rooms is a large computer monitor that reads \u201cCONTAINMENT BREACH IMMINENT\u201d.\n\n\nAgents reach a door at the end of another hallway. They enter.\n\n\nTeam arrives in a small room. The walls and ceiling are constructed out of metal and the floor is concrete. On the far side wall is a single metal door, to the left side is a placard reading \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201d. All noises from the other room have become inaudible.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n Thank god.\n\n\nAgent Paulson approaches the containment chamber of \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201c and looks inside through its window. The chamber appears empty.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n What do you see?\n\n\nAgent Paulson\n Come take a look.\n\n\nAgents approach and take turns to look inside.\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Is that a\u2026 No, wait\u2026 It\u2019s going back into its main mass\u2026 Something else is coming out now, like a big cluster of a eyes\u2026\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n No, there\u2019s a tail. Horns too. Long spider legs, creepy.\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n The whole thing is translucent. Can just make out its shape around the edges.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Command, are you seeing anything?\n\n\nCommand:\n No. Nothing on our end. What do you see?\n\n\nAgent Paulson looks back at the others\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Some sort of mass. Translucent, and in a constant state of reshaping. It seems none of us are seeing the same thing though. It's trying to take on a certain form. More like it's resisting, trying to go back to its original form of a shapeless mass. Almost looks like something is pulling at it and trying to reshape it like clay. Cameron, anything?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n I think maybe something like\u2026 It definitely feels like a monster. Looks like so many other things that I've seen before. That one lighthouse creature with a giant eye. A skull lady submerged in red flame. That giant spider we dealt with last month\u2026 It became all of those things briefly for a just few seconds when I just looked at it. I think this is meant to be what that Christian guy was helping contain, and he had a whole bunch of reasons to let it out, and screw over Director Debris. You heard what I said before, guy seemed to have lost his way. But-\n\n\nAgent Cameron reaches for the door handle. At this point, the visual phenomena similarly described by agents becomes visible on the camera feed. Agent Cameron then puts his hand down and SCP-XXXX is no longer visible on camera again.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n What?\n\n\nAgent Cameron:\n None of it feels real. This isn't \nthat\n monster, at least yet. It feels incomplete, like it could be a monster whenever it shifts into something though. But then it's not anymore. I think it doesn't want to be. But if we open this door to find out and cause the containment breach, that's it. It won't be able to resist becoming whatever this place wants it to be anymore.\n\n\nCameras continue to show nothing inside the chamber\n\n\nAgent Richard:\n We shouldn't do anything further until we know exactly what this is.\n\n\nAgent Brendon:\n Or maybe we should just leave it. Have someone run some tests before crossing the chamber's threshold.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Agreed. Command, we're ready to leave.\n\n\nCommand:\n Very well. Return to base.\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n Let's go.\n\n\nAgents exit the room, leaving the empty containment chamber.\n\n\n[Extraneous data removed]\n\n\nAgent Richards:\n Wait. Should we go back for that gun?\n\n\nAgent Paulson:\n No. It\u2019s not important.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nNote:\n A follow-up investigation revealed multiple Foundation personnel stationed at or formerly located at Site-17 to have experienced a sudden recollection of SCP-7537 as an official Foundation containment site, recognising it primarily as the workplace of a \"Ronald Christian\". This phenomena ceased following Agent Cameron's refusal to release SCP-XXXX from its chamber. All affected personnel claimed to be under the impression that the location was about to experience a site-wide containment breach caused by a Keter or Apollyon level anomalous entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

Rumbling throughout the hallway and explosions from passing rooms can be heard as the team make their way through. In one of the rooms is a large computer monitor that reads \u201cCONTAINMENT BREACH IMMINENT\u201d. Agents reach a door at the end of another hallway. They enter. Team arrives in a small room. The walls and ceiling are constructed out of metal and the floor is concrete. On the far side wall is a single metal door, to the left side is a placard reading \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201d. All noises from the other room have become inaudible. Agent Cameron: Thank god. Agent Paulson approaches the containment chamber of \u201cSCP-XXXX\u201c and looks inside through its window. The chamber appears empty. Agent Richards: What do you see? Agent Paulson Come take a look. Agents approach and take turns to look inside. Agent Richards: Is that a\u2026 No, wait\u2026 It\u2019s going back into its main mass\u2026 Something else is coming out now, like a big cluster of a eyes\u2026 Agent Brendon: No, there\u2019s a tail. Horns too. Long spider legs, creepy. Agent Cameron: The whole thing is translucent. Can just make out its shape around the edges. Agent Paulson: Command, are you seeing anything? Command: No. Nothing on our end. What do you see? Agent Paulson looks back at the others Agent Paulson: Some sort of mass. Translucent, and in a constant state of reshaping. It seems none of us are seeing the same thing though. It's trying to take on a certain form. More like it's resisting, trying to go back to its original form of a shapeless mass. Almost looks like something is pulling at it and trying to reshape it like clay. Cameron, anything? Agent Cameron: I think maybe something like\u2026 It definitely feels like a monster. Looks like so many other things that I've seen before. That one lighthouse creature with a giant eye. A skull lady submerged in red flame. That giant spider we dealt with last month\u2026 It became all of those things briefly for a just few seconds when I just looked at it. I think this is meant to be what that Christian guy was helping contain, and he had a whole bunch of reasons to let it out, and screw over Director Debris. You heard what I said before, guy seemed to have lost his way. But- Agent Cameron reaches for the door handle. At this point, the visual phenomena similarly described by agents becomes visible on the camera feed. Agent Cameron then puts his hand down and SCP-XXXX is no longer visible on camera again. Agent Paulson: What? Agent Cameron: None of it feels real. This isn't that monster, at least yet. It feels incomplete, like it could be a monster whenever it shifts into something though. But then it's not anymore. I think it doesn't want to be. But if we open this door to find out and cause the containment breach, that's it. It won't be able to resist becoming whatever this place wants it to be anymore. Cameras continue to show nothing inside the chamber Agent Richard: We shouldn't do anything further until we know exactly what this is. Agent Brendon: Or maybe we should just leave it. Have someone run some tests before crossing the chamber's threshold. Agent Paulson: Agreed. Command, we're ready to leave. Command: Very well. Return to base. Agent Paulson: Let's go. Agents exit the room, leaving the empty containment chamber. [Extraneous data removed] Agent Richards: Wait. Should we go back for that gun? Agent Paulson: No. It\u2019s not important. [END LOG] Note: A follow-up investigation revealed multiple Foundation personnel stationed at or formerly located at Site-17 to have experienced a sudden recollection of SCP-7537 as an official Foundation containment site, recognising it primarily as the workplace of a \"Ronald Christian\". This phenomena ceased following Agent Cameron's refusal to release SCP-XXXX from its chamber. All affected personnel claimed to be under the impression that the location was about to experience a site-wide containment breach caused by a Keter or Apollyon level anomalous entity.",
