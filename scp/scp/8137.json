Due to the nature of SCP-8137\u2019s effects, no hazardous or volatile materials are to be stored within the container without prior approval from Level 3 personnel. SCP-8137 may be used for testing on biological or chemical matter as needed, but tests involving radioactive substances or live organisms require clearance from Site Command.\n\n\nPersonnel interacting with SCP-8137 should exercise caution when sealing organic material inside to avoid unintentional long-term preservation.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-8137 is a rectangular plastic Tupperware container measuring approximately 20\u00a0cm x 15\u00a0cm x 10\u00a0cm. The container is composed of clear plastic with a detachable blue lid. Both long sides of the container are embossed with the words \"\nForever-Fresh\u2122\n\". The materials used in the construction of SCP-8137 are consistent with typical commercial-grade food storage containers, and no other notable physical anomalies are present.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-8137 manifest when any organic object is placed inside and the lid is fully sealed. Upon sealing, the object will cease all forms of decomposition, including spoilage, aging, and decay. The effect persists for as long as the lid remains sealed. However, SCP-8137 does not appear to reverse any damage or spoilage already present at the time of sealing. Upon reopening the container, normal biological processes resume.\n\n\nSCP-8137 was discovered in a residential kitchen in [REDACTED], USA, following a Foundation investigation into anomalous household items. The object came into Foundation custody without incident, and no other anomalous items were found at the site.\n\n\nAddendum 8137-A: Testing Logs\n\n\nTest 1-1\n\n\nSubject:\n Two ripe bananas, one placed in SCP-8137, the other left as a control\n\n\nProcedure:\n Both bananas were left in their respective environments for one month.\n\n\nResults:\n After one month, the banana stored in SCP-8137 showed no signs of decomposition or spoilage, maintaining the same condition as when it was sealed. In contrast, the reference banana exhibited extensive rot and discoloration, consistent with typical spoilage after prolonged exposure.\n\n\nConclusion:\n SCP-8137 effectively halts all signs of decomposition for organic matter.\n\n\nTest 1-2\n\n\nSubject:\n A banana with early signs of spoilage\n\n\nProcedure:\n A partially spoiled banana was placed in SCP-8137, while another spoiled banana was left outside as a control. Both were left for one month.\n\n\nResults:\n After one month, the banana stored in SCP-8137 retained the same level of spoilage it had at the time of sealing, showing no further decomposition but no improvement either. The control banana decayed completely.\n\n\nConclusion:\n SCP-8137 does not reverse spoilage or damage; it only preserves the current state of organic matter.\n\n\nTest 2-1\n\n\nSubject:\n One live Mus musculus (house mouse)\n\n\nProcedure:\n A live mouse was placed in SCP-8137 with the lid sealed.\n\n\nResults:\n After approximately 4 hours, the mouse expired due to asphyxiation, as SCP-8137 is airtight. The mouse\u2019s body was left inside SCP-8137 for one month. During this time, the corpse showed no signs of decay or decomposition. Upon reopening the container, the corpse immediately began to show typical postmortem changes.\n\n\nConclusion:\n SCP-8137 prevents decomposition of living organisms after death but cannot sustain life due to lack of air exchange.\n\n\nTest 3-1\n\n\nSubject:\n 10 grams of Cobalt-60 (radioactive material)\n\n\nProcedure:\n A 10-gram sample of Cobalt-60 was placed in SCP-8137, with another 10-gram sample left outside as a reference. Both samples were left for 63 months.\n\n\nResults:\n After 63 months, the reference sample of Cobalt-60 had decayed to approximately 5 grams, with the lost mass converting into Nickel-60 through beta decay, consistent with the expected half-life of Cobalt-60 (5.27 years). The sample stored inside SCP-8137, however, remained exactly 10 grams, showing no signs of radioactive decay or mass loss.\n\n\nConclusion:\n SCP-8137 halts radioactive decay and mass loss in addition to biological decomposition.\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nAddendum 8137-B: Experiment Proposal\n\nFollowing the results of Test 3-1, researchers have proposed further experiments involving SCP-8137\u2019s potential applications for long-term containment of hazardous materials, including highly radioactive substances. Approval is pending review from the Site Director.",
