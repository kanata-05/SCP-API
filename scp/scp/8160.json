If an informational breach is located, standard academic suppression tactics are to be deployed, ensuring the information is lost, its founders discredited, and the overall initiative refocused or disbanded if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8160 denotes an amorphous region of deep space\n1\n which interferes with any signals, celestial bodies, or manmade apparatus that pass through its interior. Though the region has been found to be approximately spherical,\n2\n all attempts to remotely gather information pertaining to the interior conditions of the anomaly have failed due to anomalous interference.\n\n\nFollowing the region's discovery, reconnaissance exo-ship EV1-\"Grasping Destiny\" has been deployed to serve as the staging ground for a series of manned interstellar scouting trips into SCP-8160. Up to date results from these exhibitions have been summarized below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Status\n\n\nDecommissioned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot Status\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n Signal lost upon entry. Pilot failed to navigate to planned depth within anomaly, later citing \"immediate loss of directional control\" as a reason for this failure. Pod recovered 15km from drop-off point; perfect condition, non-functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Status\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot Status\n\n\nRetired\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n Signal lost upon entry. Attempted preliminary tests 1\u00a0km from drop-off point, then returned after 1 hour. Upon review, all tests performed incorrectly. Pilot unable to recognize errors, relieved from duties due to anomalous reorientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Status\n\n\nDecommissioned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot Status\n\n\nDeceased\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n Signal lost upon entry. Perimeter drone view witnessed pod rapidly accelerating into anomaly. Pod found 1 month later 1357 Km from drop-off point and in a state of disrepair. Pilot lost; Starvation. No meaningful data gathered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following encrypted signal was captured by a foundation-operated satellite stationed outside of the Veiled sector. Metadata analysis of signal identified a matching SCP-8160-issue Manned-Autonomous Transporter\n3\n probe model and scouting mission code, however, no records of the \"Mission Zero\" detailed in its contents exist within the SCiPnet database. Additionally, the mission is dated before official Foundation discovery of the phenomena. EV1-\"Grasping Destiny\" has since been contacted for input on this disparity: Response pending.\n\n\nThe decrypted signal contents have been provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile-0MISSION/log\n\n\n\n\nPilot:\n Theta\n\n\nVessel:\n 0A75NN2\n\n\nSummary:\n Reconnaissance of potential anomaly.

Covering the floor at the center of the room is a wide chalk circle, approximately 2 meters in diameter.]\n\n\nBigger than I expected\u2026\n\n\n[Theta walks the perimeter, pushing against the exterior wall. A light buffeting of dust can be heard from outside.]\n\n\nSturdy too\u2026\n\n\n[Theta backs a few steps toward the center of the room, but suddenly stops, bumping into something.

It's a game of marbles. Of course it is.\n\n\n[Theta opens the storage pocket on the exterior of their exo-suit. Sitting next to the knife inside the pocket is a small grey marble.]\n\n\n[They pause again.

A trail painted in ink. A line shifting as the liquid-pages move, but always clear- connected across their surfaces. Uncountable pages interlocking in a perfect spiral of patterned ink, pointing down, leading down, into a dark whirling splotch at the center.]\n\n\n[In moments, Theta can no longer see their objects.
