Trained and experimented on from kindergarten by the PENTAGRAM, she was handed to the Foundation in tenth grade. It wasn\u2019t till she was pushing 40 that they decided she was, in fact, capable of life outside a cell. With lethal countermeasures if she naps for too long.\n\n\nMeet Adam Saxon\n. His central nervous system was made redundant by a surgery itself made redundant less than five years later; but as one of the Foundation\u2019s finest counter-intelligence officers, he could only stand forced retirement for so long. Despite decades of field and deskwork, Adam\u2019s self-image and people skills are somewhat rusted.\n\n\nMeet Bharath \u201cBarry\u201d REDACTED\n. Somewhere in his soul hides a divine tardigrade capable of reducing him to cinders and regenerating him from the ashes. It also helps that any memetic effects placed on him are both useless and usually burn the offender in the process. His passions include foreign languages, historiography, and comic books.\n\n\nUnder the watchful eye of living legend / chief librarian Olympia, this trio venture through genealogical records from the Hyperborean age, dig through terminals in sites long shuttered, and crack cyphers in languages deliberately buried. They work for the Archival Division, archaeologists of invisible histories and investigators of buried mystery.\n\n\nPREVIOUSLY, IN REAL TALES OF THE SUPERNATURAL:\n\n\nIn 1939, exhausted from a lifetime battling the forces of the British Empire under sea and Veil, Vishwamitra Thakkar \u2013 better known as Captain Nemo of the Nautilus \u2013 tried to sever his ties with rebellion and bloodshed. Aboard the mighty Albatross, a spaceship of his own making, he assembled a crew of the brightest minds and heroes ever seen in occult history to voyage among the stars. British commandos killed everyone aboard before it left Pluto.\n\n\nNemo knew the Crown could not be trusted, and left a contingency plan: a robot body-double that found its way off the Moon to Earth, where it tracked down old equipment now stored in Shadow British Museum, Her Royal Majesty\u2019s Reliquary for Artifacts Obscene and Profane. The Archival Division followed it \u2013 but were too late to stop Nemo from constructing a dead man\u2019s switch and triggering his ultimate vengeance upon perfidious Albion.\n\n\nNow, \nCaptain Nemo\u2019s wrath barrels towards Buckingham Palace\n at almost ten percent of the speed of light. With less than forty hours to stop it and no way of directly getting aboard\u2026 how does the Archival Division prevent the obliteration of planet Earth?\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBarry!\u201d\n\n\nBharath \u201cBarry\u201d [REDACTED], starting his twelfth re-read of \nREAL TALES OF THE SUPERNATURAL\n issue 763 \u2013 an issue with him in it, something he\u2019d only dreamed of, in the same comic as heroes like Nikola Tesla, Captain Nemo, even Olympia \u2013 looks up at Adam Saxon.\n\n\n\u201cSupposed to be working on that SCP format,\u201d Adam says. \u201cYou even know where we\u2019re going? What is that, your eleventh reread of that comic? \u201d\n\n\nBarry doesn\u2019t bother to correct him. \u201cWe\u2019re visiting the lost city of Carcosa! Popularly known as a fiction created by Ambrose Bierce, it\u2019s actually a Central African Nexus built from the body of what is assumed to be some extraterrestrial organism. Thought to have landed sometime in the 13th century AD \u2013 \u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Adam says. \u201cWhat about the jungle? The Congo? What do you know about it?\u201d\n\n\nBarry barely listens to his mouth while it regurgitates the complete geographical dossier of the three-hundred-square kilometer patch of Congolese jungle on which their CH-47 Chinook is encroaching. It\u2019s the third time Adam has made him repeat the contents of the dossier because he doesn\u2019t approve of \nReal Tales of the Supernatural\n. Like he\u2019s trying to be his dad and not his manager.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Adam says. \u201cWhat\u2019re you rolling your eyes for, soldier?\u201d\n\n\nAcross from them, Chessaline Broad tries to savor her fifteen minute nap. She hasn\u2019t needed to sleep in over a quarter century; shouldn\u2019t be asleep more than a quarter of an hour anyway. The shock collar around her neck was her idea; every twenty minutes it electrocutes her awake. For safety\u2019s sake, each of her hands are busy with their own Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\n\n\u201cMaking final approach to the landing point now,\u201d says the chopper pilot over the intercom.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN EXCERPT]\n\n\nSAXON:\n Okay. Let\u2019s take it from the top. Remember, we\u2019re presenting this to Olympia tomorrow. Unless she likes what she sees, we can\u2019t go where we need.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Right! So. After we contained SCP-6190 \u2013 as seen in issue 763 of \nReal Tales of the Supernatural\n, I still can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in it \u2013\n\n\nBROAD:\n Focus, Barry! After we contained SCP-6190 and \nneutralized\n SCP-2669 in the process \u2013 wherever the Khevtuul is now, I hope she\u2019s happy \u2013\n\n\nSAXON:\n If you\u2019re going to bring up the Khevtuul at all, bring up how the boys upstairs should expunge all their research on replicating it. The Foundation prefers burying their mistakes anyways\u2026 Nobody should have to undergo what she did.\n\n\nSAXON:\n Now focus, both of you. Belgian Carcosa. What do we know about it? Why is it relevant? Why should Olympia fund a trip down there?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Right! Um. So, during postmortem analysis of 6190\u2019s containment, we decided to go back into the literature and figure out how the British Empire erased Nemo from the historical record.\n\n\nBROAD:\n We still haven\u2019t figured out how they did it. Our best guess\u2026 some kind of reverse memetic?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Anti-memetic!\n\n\nSAXON:\n We\u2019re not calling it that. Some kind of reverse meme that kept him hidden and was propagated by existing historical records. We\u2019re not going to pretend to explain we know how it worked \u2013\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n But once I did know it was there, it was like my memetic immunity suddenly kicked in. Suddenly I was seeing Captain Nemo more and more in our records, and while I was adding and checking and cross\u2013checking all this new information, I found his expeditions into the Congo. Slide?\n\n\nBROAD:\n Slide! Between 1890 and 1930, Nemo discovered underground waterways leading into major lakes within the Congo Basin, which he used as secret supply lines to support the various guerilla forces opposing Belgian rule during the periods it was known as the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo.\n\n\nSAXON:\n We\u2019ve found a considerable amount of correspondence and records suggesting that virtually every organized resistance force in the Congo received support from Nemo via these supply lines \u2014 all but one. Slide.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n I\u2019m not fully comfortable assigning Nemo\u2019s concerns \u2013\n\n\nSAXON:\n Next slide. Nemo supported all but one faction. The Free State of Carcosa \u2013 formerly the People\u2019s Republic of Carcosa. In particular, Nemo was uncomfortable with the growing political influence of a Belgian operative known as Tintin. Barry?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Yes, I found records of one \nMister\n Tintin, unclear if it\u2019s the one by Belgian comic author Georges Remi, aka Herge \u2013\n\n\nSAXON:\n Elaborate on the evidence.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n But\u2026 We found records of a Belgian reporter, last name Tintin, dispatched by right-wing newspaper Le Vingtieme Sinclair to write a puff piece on the Belgian Congo in 1919. In those records, we also uncovered a plane ticket for a second passenger, first name Snowy. Last name Terrier.\n\n\nBROAD:\n These records were already in Foundation custody. Hidden until Barry\u2019s memetic immunity counteracted the agent concealing them. We were able to trace Tintin and Snowy via expense receipts from Le Vingtieme Sinclair, as they traveled from Portugal to the coast of the Belgian Congo, but lost track of him as he ventured up the Congo River from Tshumbiri.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n That\u2019s the last time we see him in the historical record for the next decade. The magazine officially reported his death in 1925. Unofficially, he resurfaces in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1929, then again in 1930 when Nemo is dropping off supplies with members of Free Carcosa. Tintin and Nemo have some kind of encounter that, uh\u2026\n\n\nSAXON:\n That spooks the hell out of Nemo. Next slide. At that point, Nemo starts reducing his frequency of cooperation with Carcosa\u2019s provisional government until cutting off contact with them outright. Carcosa itself stops being relevant around 1960. Partly because of the nonaggression pact signed during the 1963 Paraweaponry Cessation Treaties, but primarily because in 1960 the Kowloon Walled Cortex is discovered and becomes the premiere economic Nexus of the Southern Hemisphere. Something to do with integrated circuits. Barry can explain later. But as for Tintin himself, slide! Barry?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n The main pattern we see is that Tintin keeps cropping up wherever there\u2019s some kind of\u2026 well, some kind of right-wing government. At first, it\u2019s to support them and write agitprop. But after World War 2 we see him drifting in the other direction. Alongside more radical left wing revolutionary groups. But never from their own records. Only from the records of the dictatorships and military juntas opposing them. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a force of nature instead of an actual person.\n\n\nBROAD:\n The last official Foundation record of his appearance is 1979. Some scuffle at an Antarctic base. The details about why he was there are redacted above our clearances, um\u2026\n\n\nSAXON:\n Here\u2019s where I\u2019ll make my official request to Olympia to heighten my personal clearance.\n\n\nBROAD:\n What about our clearances?\n\n\nSAXON:\n My past experience will have more weight to the request. Barry. Describe the surveillance footage?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Right! Two weird things. One is that it\u2019s not until six-one-ninety is contained that I find, I mean that Archival starts finding, Captain Nemo\u2019s mentions of Tintin in our records. Two is that Analytics Working Group Bravo-3 pulled up almost a collective hour of CCTV footage from various sites automatically processed over the past fifty years that only now triggered their pattern recognition\u2026 and sent it down to us because it identified Tintin in all of them.\n\n\nSAXON:\n Likely a reverse memetic \u2013 no, I\u2019m not using antimemetic \u2013 that only now precluded us from identifying Tintin as a person of interest. Slide! Chess?\n\n\nBROAD:\n Over the past fifty years, Tintin has been part of at least six different raids on front locations of our Sites. Almost half the time he simply isn\u2019t in disguise but wasn\u2019t picked up by our cameras or caught by our surveillance systems. We\u2019ve seen him in Nevada, Ontario, Sylvania, Bangkok, and even our lunar facility. But somehow he\u2019s evaded recognition \u2013 until now.\n\n\nSAXON:\n Rephrase that as picked up by our analysts or even identified by our cameras. But clearly he has some interest in the Foundation. The real nail in the coffin is this letter our mail crawlers somehow picked up, addressed to Tintin himself. Dated less than a month ago.\n\n\n[END EXCERPT]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDearest Tintin,\n\n\nPlease come back to our apartment. We last left each other tasting bitterness on our tongues. Until now, out of misguided resentment and shame, I never wrote to you again. But I need to apologize in person. Along the shore where the cloud waves break, and the twin suns sink behind the lake, at the nook we first saw Aldebaran in the sky below the ground. Before I enter the Eye.\n\n\nYour brother always,\n\nChong Jen Zhang\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCarcosa\u2019s entrance resides under a sawtooth formation north of Lake Tumba, composed of a dozen granite peaks jutting from the ground. There is no granite in this part of Africa. These fossilized open fractures belong to a Simurgh struck out of the sky, yet hidden from satellites all the same.\n\n\nThe sun is just breaking the horizon as the CH-47 Chinook sets Archival Division down by the farthest peak from the city\u2019s exposed bones, alongside all the supplies the team will need to track down their target: such as spare heads for Adam, Barry\u2019s full complement of containment suits, and Chess\u2019s daily amphetamine supplement.\n\n\nAdam stews in the back seat. In less than two hours, he smashed through three different trees. Thank God for America\u2019s pre-war metallurgy; it\u2019s the only reason this Jeep\u2019s engine has survived. When Chessaline volunteered to take over, he humored her, assuming she would immediately crash or blow a tire. In the last three hours Chess\u2019s eyes have been closed, she has deftly dodged a dozen different crashes that would have rendered their Jeep into an immobile hulk. Not for the first time, he wishes he still had a mouth to gnaw at his fingers. Just how rusty is he? What if he gets these \u2013 well, these fucking \nkids\n killed?\n\n\nBarry is bored. He\u2019s never been in the Congo; never visited this part of the world; never even sat shotgun before. Yet despite charting a path through pumpkin-colored dirt and overgrown trails, navigating via sheer dead reckoning; identifying foliage he\u2019s never seen before, he\u2019s bored. None of these plants hold a candle to what he witnessed aboard Nemo\u2019s ship. To what he helped Khevtuul obliterate.\n1\n Where is his sense of adventure?\n\n\nChessaline fears that she\u2019s done something wrong. Should she crash their buggy on purpose? She\u2019ll keep an eye out for opportunities to fake an accident.\n\n\nAround noon, Adam procures a cassette tape. \u201cBarry, you like classic rock?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChess, get ready to take a right in a hundred meters,\u201d Barry replies.\n\n\n\u201cI like it!\u201d Chessaline says. \u201cEspecially Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jethro Tull, \u2013\n\n\n\u201cEyes on the road!\u201d says Adam, as he leans forward to slot the cassette deck into place. \nRun Through the Jungle\n blasts through tinny speakers as Chess yanks the Jeep into a turn so sharp Adam fears his head might be ripped off its socket. Then they\u2019re off again, barreling through a winding route that Barry has memorized and Chess\u2019 hands steer like they\u2019ve run this course a thousand times already.\n\n\nAs evening falls and their Jeep runs out of fuel, the trio sputter to a halt at the tunnel that feeds Lost Carcosa from the surface: a hole bored directly through the fallen colossus\u2019s femur. The tunnel is easily twenty meters in diameter and barely half the actual width of the surrounding bone.\n\n\nLike their dossier said, the checkpoint station has been carved into the wall. Unlike what the dossier said, it sports a window, made of glass, nonetheless. Especially unlike what the dossier said, the man and woman behind the glass sport surprisingly modern overcoats and weapons \u2013 AK-47s whose frame is the same color as the walls.\n\n\nAdam starts re-evaluating the accuracy of the dossier he was assured was up-to-date. Starts wondering why he didn\u2019t bother double-checking. His head begins to throb.\n\n\n\u201c<We know the Foundation when we see \u2018em>,\u201d says the woman in the station. \u201c<What\u2019s your cover story? Let\u2019s work something out.>\u201d\n\n\nChess and Adam look at Barry.\n\n\n\u201cOh! Uh. They know we\u2019re Foundation,\u201d Barry says. \u201cAsked about our cover story, said we could work something out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t paraphrase them next time,\u201d says Adam. \u201cTranslate directly for me. Could save our lives. I wanna talk to them through.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat should we say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI speak English, Foundation pig,\u201d the man interrupts. \u201cWhat business do you have in Carcosa? We know our history. The nonaggression pact still stands.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow the hell does this man know what nonaggression means?\u201d Adam whispers. Then, louder. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to start a war. We\u2019re just looking to meet someone.\u201d\n\n\nThe woman says, \u201cWhat are you willing to say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d Adam says.\n\n\n\u201cWe know about you, Adam Saxon,\u201d the woman says. \u201cAbout the woman, Chessaline Broad. Even the boy \u2013 Bharath, last name [REDACTED]. We know you\u2019re here to find Mister Tintin. We know why he returned. Carcosa teaches its people many things if they are willing to listen. In that manner, it requests your knowledge first. A password.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor what you\u2019re willing to give up,\u201d says the man. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know what a computer is. Give us one of your passwords.\u201d\n\n\nEven after a quarter-century, Adam can still feel his phantom muscles as redundant eyes try popping from eliminated sockets. Who taught Carcosa about computers, let alone the Internet? How has nobody in the Foundation thought to write this down?\n\n\nBoth guards start laughing, almost in unison \u2013 rifles still trained on the Jeep. It\u2019s like they\u2019re sharing an inside joke that Adam can\u2019t hear. How can he have a headache when he lacks a head to ache?\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t. The surgery replaced his meat head with metal. Means if it\u2019s aching it\u2019s vibrating. Picking up signals.\n\n\nHe starts looking for patterns in his migraines. Chessaline and Barry start whispering to each other.\n\n\n\u201cDo we have any passwords worth sharing?\u201d they say in unison.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have internet access,\u201d Chess sighs. \u201cJust intranet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d For an instant, Barry\u2019s suit glows red-hot \u2013 just an instant. He looks down and realizes he\u2019s partially melted through the Jeep. \u201cUgh. I have access to the intranet and the sanitized archives and \u2013 well, the library. It is a pretty cool library.\u201d\n\n\nHe tries to look apologetic at Chess. \u201cI could probably get you access to those archives. And the library. Oh. Sorry, I never thought to ask \u2013 \u201d The burning in his cheeks is somehow worse than the burning of his flesh.\n\n\nChessaline shrugs and smiles at Barry. She can\u2019t quite figure out how body language works but those moves in that order always seem to cheer people up. For that matter, what body language are these guards sharing? It\u2019s some inside joke. Something they know Archival doesn\u2019t. But what?\n\n\nBarry feels an overwhelming urge to leap from the Jeep and start a war. It\u2019s the parasite riding shotgun in his mind, yes. But he\u2019s not blind. There\u2019s something everyone else knows he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s how they talk, angle their heads to process dialogue, look at each other. Body language? Chess and Adam\u2019s shared tactical language? A message carried in the bones of the beast surrounding them?\n\n\nChessaline senses but struggles to articulate the shift in Barry\u2019s body language. Jealousy. Anger. At her. What has she done to make him jealous? He has more privileges, more passwords, more access than her. Hell, he\u2019s almost twenty years younger. What does he have to be jealous about? Each of her hands tense in anticipation.\n\n\nAdam weighs his options. It\u2019s not the first, third, nor even fifth time he\u2019s been hung out to dry by the Foundation\u2019s embarrassing lack of intelligence, let alone Counterintelligence. That\u2019s why he got the skull surgery in the first place. Couldn\u2019t risk his intelligence being trapped in his brain case. Now that he knows he doesn\u2019t know what Carcosa knows, he can sort out how and what to learn from the city. As long as his teammates stay cool.\n\n\nAdam opens his mouth just as Barry and Chess leap at each other.\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nFor over half a millennium, Carcosa has thrived as one of Earth's only post-scarcity societies. Every centimeter of its being is usable for tools, technology, \nfood\n. The people\u2019s streetlights burn the creature\u2019s blubber; its roads consist of unearthed bone and shaved muscle; its apartments are carved into the leviathan\u2019s veins like pueblos in an arroyo. Carcosa\u2019s bones shielded the city from thermobaric weapons and Western necromancers, while its blood fueled munitions that could intimidate napalm. Pigs, potatoes, yams and tomatoes fed happily off the fat deposits of the land.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of space or work; of food to grow and community to develop; of room and board to discard the material circumstances of one's past and build a communal future with both comrades and friends. More than one foreign economist has gone mad trying to quantify how many people Carcosa could comfortably support for a dozen lifetimes.\n\n\nSo why does it need police?\n\n\nFor counter-revolutionaries. Agent provocateurs. So-called ambassadors from the civilized world who seek to exploit Carcosa past even the leviathan\u2019s breaking point in the name of profit.\n\n\nSince King Leopold dispatched mercenaries into the heart of the jungle, since the United States\u2019 PENTAGRAM tried to force it to pick sides during the Congo Crisis, even before the Berlin Wall and dream of global revolution collapsed, the Lost City of Carcosa chose to remain lost. The city could feed the continent\u2019s population but lacked the stomach for an eternally cold war. So a pact was signed. Carcosa would mind its own business \u2013 as long as the Foundation, GOC, and powers behind them would do the same.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nAdam isn\u2019t worried for himself. He helped write the damn pact cited by these Carcosan kids \u2013 these \ncops\n that dragged him, Barry, and Chess into their checkpoint station. The Foundation is no more an enemy of the Free State of Carcosa than it is of Cuba or Israel.\n\n\nHe\u2019s worried about Barry and Chess. Even if the dossier hadn\u2019t been so hideously outdated, Adam hadn\u2019t thought to explain to them the details of the nonaggression pact. They were only Level 3 personnel. He assumed he could just show the paperwork at the checkpoint.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it is those kids\u2019 fault these stupid pigs have the Archival Division team cuffed to pulsating red tables.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nBarry is kind of surprised. He expected some kind of police brutality or interrogation but the two women in front of him are surprisingly considerate.\n\n\n\u201c<Your Swahili is surprisingly good,>\u201d Left says. \u201c <Although it sounds \u2014 >\u201d,\n\n\n\u201c<Outdated>,\u201d says Right. \u201c<Who on Earth taught you how to speak Swahili?>\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d Behind his helmet, Barry licks his burning lips. \u201c<I\u2026 taught\u2026 myself? I taught myself!>\u201d\n\n\nHis interrogators look at each other and exchange rapid-fire dialogue he can\u2019t follow. The hard part is how they effortlessly alternate between both French and Swahili. Why can\u2019t he keep both languages in mind at once?\n\n\nSomething about the way they both cock their heads at the same time\u2026\n\n\n\u201c<I will not lie, I am impressed>.\u201d says Right. Then, in perfect English: \u201cI am impressed. Your name is Bharath right?\u201d\n\n\nShe pronounced his name right. Holy crap \u2013 er, holy cow.\n\n\n\u201cBharath, we are not trying to arrest you,\u201d says Left. \u201cWe just have a few questions. What made you attack the driver of your vehicle?\u201d\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nChess is embarrassed, but unsurprised, to find herself blindfolded, drugged, and chained to the wall by each appendage. The last thing she remembers being mad enough to try throttling Barry. Her best friend.\n\n\nOh God. That\u2019s straight up humiliating. Bharath? Her best friend? What did she do? What if Barry doesn\u2019t forgive her?\n\n\n\u201cMs. Chessaline Broad,\u201dsays a voice whose source she can\u2019t triangulate, \u201cwe apologize in advance for using the following code words.\u201d\n\n\nThe next sixty seconds are antimemetic in Chess\u2019s mind. Each time she recalls it, she does not comprehend the sounds issued to her \u2013 only experiences the physical pleasure and simultaneous shame she felt from recognizing Pentagram debrief codes and promptly spilling the Foundation\u2019s secrets, plus six months of shibboleths and intelligence into their inner workings. Every replay of the Carcosans\u2019 commands during that minute just remind her of her susceptibility to her childhood training.\n\n\nThe only good news is her interrogators don\u2019t live long enough to share those secrets.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u201cWell maybe if you hadn\u2019t confiscated my damn head off its shoulders,\u201d Adam says, \u201cI could see where your interpretation of that clause is coming from!\u201d\n\n\nHis hands clench then relax, but even in that instant Adam sees the way his two interviewers each tense their muscles in anticipation of a pistol quickdraw. They came ready to shoot. What the hell is up with these people? The Foundation hasn\u2019t bothered Carcosa since the Suez Crisis. Archival records didn\u2019t suggest otherwise.\n\n\nThe entire room quakes. Adam\u2019s head-antenna rotates instantly in the direction of the source. His grasp of French and Swahili are rusty but he comprehends enough of the Carcosans\u2019 conversation to start worrying.\n\n\n\u201c<Station\u2026 sent under earth? Shift\u2026 hours early,>\u201d he makes out through the rumbling. They\u2019re both looking at him now. \u201cFoundation?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever this is,\u201d Adam says in English, \u201c I have nothing to do with it. If I could raise my hands I would.\u201d\n\n\nGunshots now. Both detectives across from Adam move as one: standing up from their chairs, drawing their weapons, and moving to opposite sides of the cell door.\n\n\nScreams now. More gunshots. Adam recognizes the distinctive halted chatter of a Belgian Vigneron SMG set to full-auto, firing almost twice as many rounds as it should at almost twice the regular rate. It\u2019s the signature weapon of the man Archival came looking for.\n\n\n\u201cI know that sound. It\u2019s his gun, the reporter\u2019s, Tintin! He\u2019s who the Foundation is looking for, he\u2019s shooting your men!\u201d Adam shouts frantically. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, he\u2019s shot me before, but that means you and I are on the same side. Untie me and maybe we can survive this!\u201d\n\n\nThe two men look at each other. Fire off a series of statements he can\u2019t follow. But as the interviewer on the left pulls a key from his pocket, the door swings open and a hail of gunfire spills in.\n\n\nAdam tries throwing himself backwards as soon as the door is kicked in. Maybe that\u2019s how he survives. A stray bullet smashes through the bone cuffs pinning him to the table and lets him fall over entirely. He doesn\u2019t move a muscle while the stink of gunsmoke and blood linger in the air.\n\n\nA dog barks. Then footsteps recede.\n\n\nAdam, much to his shame, will never forget that he waited till the footsteps were inaudible before getting up to look for Barry and Chess.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nBarry is enraptured by just how much more Swahili and French he\u2019s learned in an hour with Left and Right than five years on his own. He himself doesn\u2019t understand what came over him when he tried to fistfight fucking Chessaline Broad. Barry has no doubt that he is not only utterly incompetent at combat but could instantly immolate anyone he wanted to. What kind of person would that make him?\n\n\nSomehow these two cops understand him better than most therapists the Foundation employs. It turns out they\u2019re on work-release programs too; Carcosa mandates a four-year tour-of-duty period in their Self-Defense Forces and features multiple free universities. Barry didn\u2019t even know Carcosa had finally developed a standing army \u2013 er, self-defense force.\n\n\nRight is explaining how she mentally adjusts from her native tongue to French grammar when the door slams open and both she and Left are cut down in a hail of bullets. Barry stares dumbfoundedly at the guileless, blue-eyed, blond-haired face in the threshold. Tintin nods at him, shoots his cuffs open, and walks off. Snowy pauses by the doorway a moment, tongue hanging and tail wagging, then follows the reporter out of sight.\n\n\nGunfire won\u2019t stop ringing in his ears.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nAt the sixty-first second, the voice in Chessaline\u2019s ear is drowned out by the chatter of a submachine gun. Immediately, her self-defence protocols kick in and she rips her hands free from the wall, chains and all.\n\n\nA Wire Fox Terrier barks. \u201cGreat snakes!\u201d someone says. \u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d\n\n\nTwo gunshots as her shackled hands leap to her defense, dragging the manacles into the bullets' path and shattering them before she even registers the bullets.\n\n\nThe terrier barks again. It would be easier than thought to snatch up a chunk of broken metal and pitch it through the mutt\u2019s brain \u2013 but she only thinks about it, rather than act on it. \u201cGo away!\u201d she shouts while ripping her blindfold off. \u201cPlease! Just get people out of here! I mean no harm!\u201d\n\n\nSomehow it works.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nChess is rummaging through the evidence lockers when Bharath runs across her. He waits until she turns around, studying the oddly rounded corners and pale coloration of said lockers, to say her name \u2013 this is the most effective means of disabling her automatic response protocols.\n\n\n\u201cChess!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBarry!\u201d She scoops him up in her arms while straining her eyelids open, lest she lose control of her arms.\n\n\n\u201cMissed you too,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you seen Adam?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d She drops him and points to the nearest corner of the room. \u201cMy hands directed me to the evidence locker. Your spare suits and Adam\u2019s heads are over there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood find, Barry,\u201d Adam says as he pushes past Barry. \u201cAre you two okay?\u201d\n\n\nBarry and Chess exchange glances while Adam is attaching his combat head: a thin sheath of cylindrical metal whose insides are engraved with photoelectric martial arts routines. They think he can\u2019t see them. On the other hand, he deserves scrutiny right now. They\u2019ll come to appreciate him.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nArchival Division do not emerge back into the light of the checkpoint station from which they were initially apprehended. Instead, they step into the artificial gas light of blubber, onto streets of faintly twitching muscle, and a cacophony of humanity amidst disaster. At a glance, Adam diagnoses the aftermath of an earthquake, during which some kind of looting is at play. At a glance, Chess diagnoses a civil war during which some kind of earthquake has occurred.\n\n\nBarry is curled at the foot of the station door, trying his hardest not to ignite from sensory overload.\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nBefore his surgery, Adam was trained to locate the sky. Whether in a skyscraper\u2019s infinity pool, some cultist\u2019s basement in the tundra, a Scarlet Hammer obstacle course used to train its suicide assassins \u2013 if he could just orient up and down, his training would enable him to escape whatever obstacles had been set and remove human counters were in his way.\n\n\nChessaline has been trained to do that twice as fast and only lethally. Adam cannot allow her to touch anyone lest they actually start an international incident \u2013 so he grabs her shoulders and asks her for a favor. \u201cChess, help me find the sky, would you?\u201d\n\n\nShe looks at him. \u201cAdam\u2026 what\u2019s happening here?\u201d\n\n\nIn that moment of shock, Adam grabs her and Barry by their suit collars and drags them back into the police station.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve killed, I\u2019ve killed I\u2019ve killed I\u2019ve killed\u201d, babbles Chess, \u201cI\u2019ve hurt people under red ceilings and red skies but that was red and it wasn\u2019t either! Adam what was that? Where are we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Chess,\u201d Adam says. \u201cFirst. How\u2019s Barry. Is he OK?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2013\u201d Barry sits up and vomits into his helmet. Then his suit glows hot enough to instantly sublimate the waste soaking into it. He retches several more times, venting enough heat each time to melt the station floor, but manages to stand up out of the resultant crater.\n\n\n\u201cI want water,\u201d he croaks. \u201cBut I\u2019ll live. Adam. What do we do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comparing our options.\u201d Adam\u2019s go-to phase for buying himself time. \u201cBarry. Go look for some water. You get some water, we find a basket to stash supplies in, then figure out how to reach the surface. Chess. Do me a favor. Step outside that door. For the next thirty seconds after that or until being attacked, record as much of the environment as you can to tell me in as much detail as you can. If you\u2019re attacked at any point or once the thirty seconds run out, come back inside and block the door. Then tell me what you saw.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYessir,\u201d they both say. Barry looks like he might retch again, but stumbles away. Chess stands up, salutes, spins around smartly, and promptly closes the station door behind her. Adam checks the weapons he\u2019s secured and the state of the station. It\u2019s like the boy adventurer materialized a car at the front desk, then gunned down whomever he didn\u2019t flatten.\n\n\nStill. There are AK-47s, grenades he\u2019s never seen before but understands at a glance how to use \u2013 but not a single damn filing cabinet in sight. Not even a sheet of paper. Where the hell are the records? It has something to do with his migraine \u2013 but the boy reporter somehow left nobody alive to give answers.\n\n\nThe front door opens and Adam swings his rifle up. \u201cAdam!\u201d Chess says from somewhere besides the empty doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\nHe lowers the rifle. \u201cCome through. What did you see?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI saw Tintin!\u201d says Chess as she shuts the door behind her. \u201cHim and that dog Snowball. They escaped up one of the capillary skyscrapers, along a spiral balcony running up the side. They were chasing someone. I\u2019ve also identified what I think are the broad factions of the ongoing civil war within Carcosa.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a civil war?\u201d Adam says.\n\n\nChess squints at him. \u201cThank you for helping me calm down, Adam,\u201d she says, emphasizing her breathing exercises, \u201cbut I know a civil war when I\u2019m looking at one. Look, I can see riot cops using the same kind of guns you have, and I can see unarmored targets with \u2013 throwing chunks of bone and Molotovs. There is a civil war happening outside right now. That boy and his dog are somehow in the middle of it.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nTintin and the Long Twentieth Century\n |\n\n\nHub\n | Tintin and the Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8620\n\" by A Random Day, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
