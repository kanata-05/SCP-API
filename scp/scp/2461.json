The remaining SCP-2461 artifacts are to be placed in High Security Containment at Armed Containment Site 2461. No access to SCP-2461 is to be permitted without unanimous consent of the O5 council. Anti-theft measures in place at Armed Containment Site 2461 are classified under Protocol 999-2461-Gernsback. Lethal force is authorized to prevent theft of SCP-2461 objects.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2461 is a series of artifacts recovered from a crash site on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-A:\n A disc-shaped device approximately 45 meters in diameter and 10.5 meters in height. Device's exterior is covered in a radar-absorbing material. Entrance and egress are possible through a dilating iris doorway in the central underside of the device, either by ladder, elevator, or roof-mounted gravity lift.\n\n\nThe interior of the device is divided into three levels, each approximately 3 meters in interior height. The topmost level (Deck 1) appears to be devoted to command and control, and includes a control center, observation dome, and navigation systems. The second level appears to be devoted to engineering and avionics, and includes the avionics, engine, and flight control systems. A small living quarters, including galley and cots, is also located on this level. The third level contains the remaining avionics and flight control systems, but is mostly made up of a toroidal fuel tank, containing approximately 40,000 liters of an unknown combustible liquid. At the moment of the writing of this article, 10,000 liters of fuel remain in the tank.\n\n\nThe underside of the device has six hemispherical protrusions located at regular intervals around the circumference of the disc. Each hemisphere shields a turreted X-ray laser in the 200\u00a0MW range. Guidance and firing are carried out either by the master gunnery control station on Deck 1, or by individual turret controls on Deck 3.\n\n\nThree extendable struts are located at regular intervals on the underside of the device, and can be extended for landing.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-B:\n Ten instances of SCP-2461-B were found inside SCP-2461-A, labeled SCP-2461-B1 through SCP-2461-B10. At the time of the writing of this article, seven instances of SCP-2461-B (B1 through B7) have been destroyed through testing or accident, leaving three extant examples.\n\n\nSCP-2461-B is an exoskeletal \"powered armor\" suit constructed of a highly sophisticated steel alloy. Each was originally worn by a different instance of SCP-2461-C before recovery, and was individually fitted to its wearer's physical characteristics. Experimentation has revealed that SCP-2461-B grants the user increased strength, that its armor plating is capable of repelling small arms fire up to and exceeding .50 BMG, and that it contains systems capable of life support in hard vacuum for extended periods of time.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-C1 through C12:\n The cremated remains of twelve individuals (eleven male, one female) who originally operated SCP-2461-A. At the present time, none of the SCP-2461-C instances have been positively identified. Autopsies carried out after the initial crash site recovery indicates that all ten individuals were killed [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-D1 through D10:\n Ten devices originally housed in leather holsters affixed to the exterior of each SCP-2461-B. Eight of these devices (SCP-2461-D1 through D8) were damaged beyond repair in the impact. One of the surviving devices was subsequently destroyed during the course of experimentation and testing, leaving one extant device remaining.\n\n\nSCP-2461-D is an X-ray laser pistol in the 150\u00a0kW range. The emitter is located in the bulbous structure located just above the grip. The collimating \"barrel\" of the device is a hexagonal prism made of an artificial aluminum oxide crystal, protruding four inches from the emitter, surrounded by combination heat-sink and barrel shroud. The devices are rechargeable by 125\u00a0V alternating current, or by replacing the power pack located in the grip.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-E1 through E4:\n Four X-ray laser rifles in the 200\u00a0kW range. The construction is similar to that of SCP-2461-D, except that the power pack is located in a magazine well located forward of the trigger housing, the barrel has been extended to twelve inches and includes a forward hand grip made of walnut wood, and a rifle butt made of the same walnut wood has been attached to the rear of the laser emitter housing.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-F through Z:\n [DATA EXPUNGED UNDER SECURITY PROTOCOL 999-2461-GERNSBACK]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461-ALEPH through HE:\n [DATA EXPUNGED UNDER SECURITY PROTOCOL 999-2461-GERNSBACK]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Initial Recovery and History.\n SCP-2461-A (and all artifacts contained within) were originally recovered from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588 on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

As of the writing of this article, no plans have been made for any such transfer.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0following\u00a0information\u00a0is\u00a0limited\u00a0to\u00a0personnel\u00a0with\u00a0999-2461-Gernsback\u00a0clearance\u00a0only.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conceal\u00a0information\n\n\n\n\nThe following slogans were found scrawled on various interior surfaces of SCP-2461-A upon recovery.\n\n\n\n\nDeutschland \u00dcber Alles!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGott Strafe Amerika!

At the time of the writing of this article, the identities of these operatives are unknown.\n\n\nForensic reconstruction indicates that, at the time of impact, two of these individuals (VAV3 and VAV4) were located just outside the corridor leading to the control center on Deck 1, armed with SCP-2461-D and SCP-2461-E instances. Two other individuals (VAV1 and VAV2) were found at the controls of SCP-2461-A, seated at the pilot and copilot's stations. Two SCP-2461-C instances (C1 and C2) were also found nearby, each killed by a headshot by a laser pistol in the 150 kw range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0following\u00a0information\u00a0is\u00a0limited\u00a0to\u00a0O5-level\u00a0personnel\u00a0with\u00a0999-2461-Gernsback\u00a0clearance\u00a0only.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Conceal\u00a0information\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of SCP-2461-A Cockpit Flight Data Voice Recorder.\n\n\n\n\nUnknown:\n \"Stick this in your pipe and suck it, Ratzi scum!\"\n\n\nSounds of physical struggle.\n\n\nC-1:\n \"Foolish.

It is with the utmost respect and gratitude for the care with which you have maintained these historical artifacts that the Coalition cordially requests that these remains and artifacts be returned to the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n\nStrike Team Alpha was the first Global Occult Coalition strike team to be formed in the wake of the Second World War. Their exploits against the SS Ahnenerbe and the Thule-Gesellschaft during the years following the dissolution of the Nazi regime were instrumental not only in dealing with the occult fallout of that war, but in repairing the reputation of the German people in the occult community. Certainly, complicit guilt in the deaths of nine million innocents cannot be expunged easily, but their pasts do not in any way lessen the courage and sacrifice of Commander Hans Fritzl, Lieutenant Wilheim Weiss, Sergeant Manfred Schroeder, and Special Agent Diana Wu-Frost.\n\n\nCertainly, an organization whose early history includes a shameful involvement in the \n\"McCarthy-Truman UFO Scandal\" of 1951\n must understand the value of repentance and restitution.\n\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\nUnder-Secretary-General D.

        "To Whom It May Concern, The Global Occult Coalition High Command has recently received word that the remains of GOC Strike Team Alpha are in the custody of your organization. It is with the utmost respect and gratitude for the care with which you have maintained these historical artifacts that the Coalition cordially requests that these remains and artifacts be returned to the Global Occult Coalition. Strike Team Alpha was the first Global Occult Coalition strike team to be formed in the wake of the Second World War. Their exploits against the SS Ahnenerbe and the Thule-Gesellschaft during the years following the dissolution of the Nazi regime were instrumental not only in dealing with the occult fallout of that war, but in repairing the reputation of the German people in the occult community. Certainly, complicit guilt in the deaths of nine million innocents cannot be expunged easily, but their pasts do not in any way lessen the courage and sacrifice of Commander Hans Fritzl, Lieutenant Wilheim Weiss, Sergeant Manfred Schroeder, and Special Agent Diana Wu-Frost. Certainly, an organization whose early history includes a shameful involvement in the \"McCarthy-Truman UFO Scandal\" of 1951 must understand the value of repentance and restitution. Yours Sincerely, Under-Secretary-General D. C. Al Fine United Nations Global Occult Coalition",
