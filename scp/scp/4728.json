As SCP-4728 has yet to be observed going any farther than around 200 meters away from SCP-4728-A, nor demonstrated any apparent desire to do so, more proactive containment measures are not necessary at this time.\n\n\nWhen interacting with SCP-4728, staff are encouraged to use diplomatic language and to defer to SCP-4728\u2019s self-assigned titles or honorifics as warranted by context, and to SCP-4728-A with similar proper titles and adjectives as indicated by SCP-4728\n1\n this has been shown to greatly ease conversation and information sharing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4728 is an adult Spotted Salamander\n2\n, physically unremarkable other than a physical size of just under 0.5m, about double that of the largest non-anomalous members of the species. It resides in SCP-4728-A, which designates a small pond located in southwestern Ontario near the Northwestern shores of Lake Superior. It contains anomalously stable water levels regardless of relevant climatic factors such as precipitation, humidity, or temperature, to the point of resistance to freezing in the winter, and having a surface area fluctuating only ever slightly; at areas of 13.1-13.5\u00a0m\n2\n in length and possessing a maximum depth of approx. 3.3m close to its physical center.\n\n\nSCP-4728 displays sapience and a wide-ranging ability to verbally communicate with other species, human and non-human alike. SCP-4728 is fluent in English and primarily speaks in grandiose verbiage in relation to itself, its claimed capabilities, and its area of claimed \u201choly jurisdiction\u201d (i.e. SCP-4728-A and the woodland immediately surrounding it). In reality, despite claims of a number of powerful paranormal and reality-warping capabilities, the only confirmed anomalous capabilities so far consist of its intelligence, cross-species communication, skills, the ability to levitate for a short period of time,\n3\n and to walk upright bipedally.\n4\n Other claimed abilities including resurrection from death, tsunami-summoning, and \"blessing for increased harvest yields\" have not been confirmed.\n\n\nWhile local fauna often take direct actions based on the wishes and proclamations of SCP-4728, no other such instance of local wildlife has been seen sharing similar anomalous abilities themselves, and the degree to which successful direction among other wildlife results from communication vs unseen compulsion on the part of SCP-4728 remains unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4728-A in the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n While the presence of a recurring local summer camp legend involving a \u201ctalking lizard king\u201d were noted by local agents in the past, no further evidence was initially noted of the potential anomaly nor folkloric aspects of children\u2019s accounts indicative of clear, actual anomalous encounters. However, following local receipt of corroborative reports from a previously skeptical counselor who agreed to accompany her campers to observe and meet SCP-4728 in July 2022, a small team of Foundation Field Reconnaissance agents was dispatched to comb the area and search for any actual anomalies. A log of their eventual initial encounter with SCP-4728 at SCP-4728-A is available below.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Access\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Initial\u00a0Encounter\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n August 2, 2022\n\n\nIndividuals Present:\n Field Agents Shane Winston, Janice Usry, and Walt Henson; SCP-4728\n\n\nForeword:\n The three field agents are exploring the area when they encounter SCP-4728-A in a clearing and are soon verbally called upon in English by a large salamander basking on a rock.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Halt! Who approaches my shores, unannounced and uninvited?\n\n\n(\nSCP-4728 crawls into view of the agents, a small crown of moss nestled on its head.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Two oddly adorned humans and an ogre, how very interesting.\n\n\nHenson:\n Uh, ogre?\n\n\nUsry:\n All three of us are humans actually. Henson is just a tall and stocky one.\n\n\nHenson:\n Wait, how do you know he meant me?\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Ah, my apologies, Son of Hen, a simple mistake.\n\n\nHenson:\n Ugh\u2026 (\nmuttering\n) Ogres aren\u2019t even a real thing.\n\n\nWinston:\n (\nwhispering back\n) Well actually\u2026 hmm, actually never mind; that might be above your clearance.\n\n\nHenson:\n Wait, what?\n\n\nUsry:\n (\nturning back to SCP-4728\n) No need to apologize, sir, a simple mistake anyone might make.\n\n\nHenson:\n Unbelievable\u2026\n\n\n(\nAgent Usry elbows Agent Henson before continuing.\n)\n\n\nUsry:\n And what is your name, if we may learn of it?\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Why, I am God-King Solomon Anders the First, Forever Blessed be my Name. I\u2019m the divine regent of this great aquatic empire in which you all find yourselves dangerously close to trespassing.\n\n\nWinston:\n Aquatic Empire?\n\n\nHenson:\n God-King?\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Yes, I am an oceanic deity, who's made this vast sea here the center of my kingdom, and I rule it divinely.\n\n\nWinston:\n Wait, so is the God-thing is just like an honorific then, or literal?\n\n\nHenson:\n What, did you think that thing might actually be a god? (\nwhispering\n) It\u2019s just a big salamander. Salamanders don\u2019t even live in the ocean\u2026\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Oh I\u2019m sorry, are your gods native to your own environs? Did you share a midwife with your deity perhaps, growing up so close to them?\n\n\nHenson:\n Oh, don\u2019t even start.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Ah you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t make too much out of who I am: just a lowly, simple talking salamander rambling about before you.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4728 jumps onto a higher rock and raises its voice\n).\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Humble yourself mortal, so I don\u2019t have to do so myself.\n\n\nHenson:\n Wait, I'm sorry, is that some kind of threat\u2014\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n If you want to get into the specifics, I\u2019m technically a demigod. My mother was indeed \u201cjust a big salamander\u201d as the Son of a Hen put it so poetically.\n\n\nUsry:\n And what about your father? Is he some great \"God\u201d then?\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Ah yes, that would be Poseidon; perhaps you've heard of him.\n\n\n(\nAgents Winston and Usry maintain their professional demeanor; Agent Henson lets out an involuntary chuckle.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Just what humors you so, oaf?\n\n\nHenson:\n Sorry, sorry. But come on\u2026 Poseidon, really? Ow!\n\n\n(\nAgent Usry elbows Agent Henson in the side just as SCP-4728 moves even closer to him.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n You\u2026 You dare mock a divine agent in his own abode?\n\n\nHenson:\n (\nrolling eyes\n) Oh, calm your gills or whatever, Prince Pond Lizard, or are you gonna smite me or something\u2026 what?\n\n\n(\nAgent Usry interrupts Agent Henson\u2019s diatribe to direct his attention to the wide variety of suddenly gathered local fauna now surrounding the group from all sides, ranging from a cloud of small flying insects to a large brown bear.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n I\u2019d suggest you all leave.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n No agent was seriously harmed upon retreat, though Agent Henson was noted to suffer five hornet stings, two spider bites, and a seemingly directly targeted course of biochemical effluence from a large skunk on his return trek. Agent Henson was chastised for his unprofessional behavior towards SCP-4728.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Interactions:\n The field agents heeded SCP-4728\u2019s suggestion and were allowed through the way they came, with Field Head Agent Usry noting a reprimand of Agent Henson for unnecessarily discourteous behavior toward the encountered anomalous entity, emphasizing the potential for such behavior to jeopardize missions and the need to avoid any similar such acts in the future.\n\n\nDue to observable remaining hostility around Agent Henson by local fauna on their return trip, only Agents Usry and Winston were sent on the second contact expedition. Agent Henson was instead sent to do biological sample collection and general observation separately in the meantime, scouring the perimeter of the new established Provisional Area 4728 alone for the day.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Access\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0second\u00a0SCP-4728\u00a0Encounter\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nWinston:\n So what do you think this thing\u2019s deal is anyway?\n\n\nUsry:\n Dash One? Well obviously that little spring or whatever it's set up shop in isn\u2019t some vast, divinely-ruled aquatic kingdom, but that salamander obviously has some real pull with the local fauna here, besides just an ability to spook young local campers. How far those abilities reach is probably best discovered by playing along for now\n\n\nWinston:\n You\u2019re right, and don\u2019t worry. Unlike Henson, I can at least be professional enough to \npretend\n to take\u2026 the\u2026\n\n\n(\nWinston trails off as Usry silently indicates that they are quickly approaching SCP-4728-A. Sure enough, SCP-4728 soon appears and intercepts them.\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n HALT! You dare you show your miserable faces on my shores again, so soon after only narrowly escaping my divine wrath?\n\n\nUsry:\n Greetings, your holiness, and our sincerest apologies. We simply wanted to make amends for our ignorance and insolence that was displayed earlier.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n (\nSCP-4728 stands up bipedally and walks to stand in front of and stare at each agent in turn, solemnly nodding both times.\n) In my divine wisdome, I sense your sincerity. You may stay for now. What of that insolent Son of the Hen?\n\n\nUsry:\n Agent Henson was\u2026 still fairly overcome with a well-earned state of shame over his behavior, you see, and personally chose not to risk your ire with his return so soon.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Hmph. Understandable I suppose, though I\u2019d still like to hear it from him in person, in the future. Let that loathsome plebe know that, please.\n\n\nUsry:\n We will make sure to do just that.\n\n\nWinston:\n Oh, it will truly be our pleasure.\n\n\nUsry:\n Would you mind if we asked some questions about your glorious kingdom and history?\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Normally I would now, but I\u2019m actually quite fatigued after a long day of dispensing holy judgment and wisdom. Perhaps when you bring that Chicken's Son for his overdue admonishment, I\u2019ll have more energy. You two may leave now.\n\n\nWinston:\n Is there any way we could at least\u2014\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n I mean it, you. May. Leave. Also, next time come bearing offerings, like any halfway-decent supplicant. It's just good manners\u2026\n\n\n(\nSCP-4728 trails off both audibly and physically, just as various sets of animal eyes from throughout the field view come into focus, staring at the two agents intensely and suspectingly.\n)\n\n\nWinston:\n Um, but\u2026\n\n\n(\nSCP-4728 pointedly ignores the two agents continued presence and attempts at dialogue.\n)\n\n\nUsry:\n Oh fine.

However, Agent Henson did not return for his own scheduled re-arrival, nor did he provide any check-in or update to explain his absence. Upon checking his gear\u2019s audiovisual feed and GPS status, it quickly became clear that Agent Henson was being constrained upside-down over the middle of SCP-4728-A while muffling due to an apparent blockage in his mouth. Agents Winston and Usry were immediately dispatched to rescue Agent Henson and de-escalate the situation to whatever extent possible.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Access\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Retrieval\u00a0Mission\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n(\nAs Agents Usry and Winston approach the scene, Agent Henson can be seen dangling above the center of SCP-4728-A via a makeshift rope and pulley system affixed to a nearby tree branch, blindfolded by large leaves from the local flora. A crowd of various animals surrounds the clearing in apparent spectation of the event.\n)\n\n\nWinston:\n Oh boy\u2026\n\n\nUsry:\n What have you done now, Henson?\n\n\nWinston:\n Wait, there\u2019s some regular words and language in the mix of all that ribbiting and buzzing and cawing\u2026 Must be SCP-4728, but I can't quite make out what it\u2019s saying.\n\n\nUsry:\n Here, let me try isolating the voice\u2019s frequency\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n \u2026with utter disregard for whether the now-deceased, (\nUnintelliglible Ribbit-Like Noise\n), could maneuver away. Crime #16: Sacrilege and Slander against our great nation and its holy champion, my own holiness\u2026\n\n\n(\nA semi-synchronous cacophony of various animal sounds roar together for a moment\n)\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Yes, yes of course, blessed forever be my holy name. Except, not when spoken of from this particular obscene, vile tongue of a \ncharlatan\n, who has dared utter epithets of this holy land I dare not repeat. To continue, Crime #17; attempted kidnapping\u2026\n\n\nUsry:\n Ok this has to stop, ASAP. (\nAgent Usry begins walking into the clearing as she shouts\n) Excuse Me! I would like to speak to your High Holiness about whatever is occurring here. We would like to arrange for the acquisition of our\u2026 wayward compatriot.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n (\nFloating down to perch on the bound torso of Agent Henson\n) For what reason do you believe you even have the right to request such a thing, impudent mortal, let alone why I would ever grant it.\n\n\nUsry:\n Me and my colleagues are but emissaries of a larger and more powerful organization ourselves, as I\u2019m sure your wisdom has already gleaned from the activity around the area.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Don\u2019t play with my limits any more than you\u2019re already doing so child! I know everything that happens near the shores of my ocean.\n\n\nHenson:\n Again, it\u2019s not even a proper pond!\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Charges, two more bear swipes and add an additional Sacrilege and Slander count. Anyway, back to you two, why should I even consider such an unhinged act?\n\n\nUsry:\n As I said, me and my colleagues come from a powerful organization with its own very, uh\u2026 rigid and selective code of behavior and punishment. We like to handle our grave miscreants on our own terms, you see.\n\n\nHenson:\n You have got to be kidding me.\n\n\nWinston:\n Silence, Miscreant!\n\n\nUsry:\n Ahem\u2026 as I was saying, I\u2019ve been sent here with offers for full and fair reparations proffered for any damage done by our rogue agent here. We would also proactively agree to provide direct support in establishing great walls of stone and metal to prevent any future troublemaking members of our species from defiling or encroaching on your realm any further, in order to make up for this egregious mistake in the first place.\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n Hmmm\u2026 And why should I trust you?\n\n\nWinston:\n As you\u2019ve said before, with your deific abilities and divine wisdom, you can as always verify the truthfulness of our words and intentions. Please, I invite you to check now so you may know our earnest honesty!\n\n\nSCP-4728:\n That uh, yes well; I can see that, of course. Very well, but want to see him appropriately punished, and will need to meet with a representative to go over the exact restitutions by tomorrow at High Noon!\n\n\nUsry:\n Of course your holiness! One of ours will be there for the occasion in prompt time.\n\n\n(\nAgent Henson rolls his eyes dramatically before being cut down unexpectedly by a well-placed bite to the rope holding him above SCP-4728-A by a resident moose.\n5\n)\n\n\nWinston:\n (\nGathering Agent Henson\u2019s battered, half-conscious body from SCP-4728-A.\n) Alright, come on troublemaker, and don\u2019t you dare mess things up any more than you already have.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs alluded to in Agents Usry\u2019s and Winston\u2019s impromptu negotiations for Agent Henson\u2019s release, the Foundation proceeded with the already-planned construction of secure perimeter fencing,\n6\n and its promise to patrol the perimeter of the area itself, along with modest additional provisions of additional food supplies and local flora as requested by SCP-4728. Agent Henson was transferred to another project upon his return to base camp and treatment of his injuries.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

    "containment_procedures": "The local woodlands immediately surrounding SCP-4728-A have been acquired under Provisional Area 4728 and fenced off to inhibit civilian incursions and any potential resulting encounters with SCP-4728-A and SCP-4728. As SCP-4728 has yet to be observed going any farther than around 200 meters away from SCP-4728-A, nor demonstrated any apparent desire to do so, more proactive containment measures are not necessary at this time.",
    "description": "SCP-4728 is an adult Spotted Salamander2, physically unremarkable other than a physical size of just under 0.5m, about double that of the largest non-anomalous members of the species. It resides in SCP-4728-A, which designates a small pond located in southwestern Ontario near the Northwestern shores of Lake Superior. It contains anomalously stable water levels regardless of relevant climatic factors such as precipitation, humidity, or temperature, to the point of resistance to freezing in the winter, and having a surface area fluctuating only ever slightly; at areas of 13.1-13.5\u00a0m2 in length and possessing a maximum depth of approx. 3.3m close to its physical center.",
