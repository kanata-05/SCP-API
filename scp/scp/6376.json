SCP-6376 is contained in a locked garden within Outpost-6376. Approximately every 2 weeks, 10 liters of human blood is to be poured on the soil and roots surrounding SCP-6376.\n\n\nRitual-6376 is forbidden without express approval by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6376 is a tree of an unknown species with bright red leaves. SCP-6376 requires regular feeding of human blood to survive but has no other environmental requirements. SCP-6376 does not lose its leaves through the changing of seasons, nor does it noticeably grow. Any individual that attempts to harm SCP-6376, through cutting it down or carving into the bark, will hear a voice warning them not to do so, and will receive a debilitating vision if they continue to pursue harming the object.\n\n\nSCP-6376's \"voice\" is an auditory hallucination resembling human speech that the object produces under certain circumstances, such as Ritual-6376 or if a person attempts to damage it. This hallucination occurs for every human or animal within a 30-meter radius and is not impacted by walls. Individuals who have heard this voice have described it as a deep androgynous voice with gravitas, and an amused tone.\n\n\nRitual-6376 is a ritual through which SCP-6376 may be communicated with. SCP-6376 appears to be prophetic and has provided useful information to the Foundation in the past. As such, it has received the Thaumiel classification.\n\n\nAddendum 1: Ritual-6376\n\n\nRitual-6376 is a method of gaining information from SCP-6376. To start, a sacrifice must be performed by the ritualist. The method of achieving this sacrifice may differ, but it should always involve the body part of a human (such as blood, bone, or hair). Depending on how valuable the sacrifice is to the ritualist, the more valuable the information one gains from SCP-6376 will be.\n\n\nAfter the sacrifice is performed, it should be lain on the roots of SCP-6376. SCP-6376's roots will then move, pulling the sacrifice under itself. Once the sacrifice has been accepted, the ritualist must ask a question. If the sacrifice is deemed satisfactory in comparison to the value of the question, SCP-6376 will respond. If the sacrifice is unworthy, SCP-6376 will request more.\n\n\nAddendum 2: Notable Ritual-6376 performances\n\n\n\n\nRitual-6376-1\n\n\n\n\nDate Performed:\n 05/10/2013\n\n\nRitualist:\n Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n\nSacrifice:\n 1 liter of blood.\n\n\nQuestion:\n \"What are you?\"\n\n\nAnswer:\n \"I am a tree.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRitual-6376-2\n\n\n\n\nDate Performed:\n 05/10/2013\n\n\nRitualist:\n Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n\nSacrifice:\n 1 liter of blood.\n\n\nQuestion:\n \"Why can you talk?\"\n\n\nAnswer:\n \"I'll need more before I can tell you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRitual-6376-3\n\n\n\n\nDate Performed:\n 05/11/2013\n\n\nRitualist:\n Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n\nSacrifice:\n 1 arm from medical surplus.\n\n\nQuestion:\n \"Why can you talk?\"\n\n\nAnswer:\n \"Because I was made to.\"\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\nSCP-6376 appears to resist providing information about itself to others.

You are approaching this from the wrong angle. Sacrifice's merit isn't based on the value or amount sacrificed, it's based on how difficult of a sacrifice it is.

That impacts their value.\"\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\nLet it end, Holmes.\n \u2014Dr. Sykes\n\n\nLeave me be. I'll figure it out.\n \u2014Dr. Holmes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRitual-6376-75\n\n\n\n\nDate Performed:\n 09/26/2013\n\n\nRitualist:\n Senior Researcher Richard Holmes.\n\n\nSacrifice:\n Lynn Holmes, David Holmes\n\n\nQuestion:\n [DATA REDACTED PER O5 ORDER]\n\n\nAnswer:\n [DATA REDACTED PER O5 ORDER]\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\nDr. Holmes accomplished this sacrifice by drugging his wife and infant son.

He then attempted to damage SCP-6376 with an axe. The following transcript details security footage taken within SCP-6376's enclosure. Notably, since SCP-6376 communicates mentally, its side of the conversation is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n[Dr. Holmes enters the garden and barricades the door.]\n\n\nDr. Holmes:\n Hello.\n\n\n[Dr. Holmes walks towards SCP-6376.]\n\n\nDr. Holmes:\n You lied.

No! No! No! No!\n\n\n[The axe makes contact with SCP-6376, dislodging a small amount of bark.

He stops sobbing.]\n\n\nDr. Holmes:\n \u2026Oh.\n\n\n[The roots of SCP-6376 reach up to grab Dr. Holmes. Dr. Holmes does not fight this.]\n\n\n[Fifteen seconds of corrupted footage.]\n\n\n[Dr. Holmes lies limp in SCP-6376's roots. He is pulled beneath the earth.]\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n Access to SCP-6376 is now forbidden to everyone without express order of the Outpost Director. Security surrounding SCP-6376's garden has been increased to prevent further break-ins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6375\n | SCP-6376 | \nSCP-6377\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6376\n\" by LizardWizard, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
