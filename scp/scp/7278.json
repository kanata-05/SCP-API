A search for PoI-7278 is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-7278 is an object which has become definitionally compromised. To clarify, it is impossible to accurately describe all of SCP-7278's properties and conceptual being within a single word or phrase, with attempts by the Department of Miscommunications only being able to reach the 70% threshold. It is for this reason that determining the true nature of SCP-7278 is extremely difficult and likely impossible.\n\n\nExtensive testing of SCP-7278 has managed to determined that it has the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nIt is mechanical in nature;\n\n\nIts volume is approximately 1.6\u00a0m\n3\n and its weight is approximately 300\u00a0kg;\n\n\nIts shape is that of a rectangular prism;\n\n\nOne of its sides has a keypad attached to it as well as a slot to insert money into;\n\n\nIt contains several low cost candies and snacks, such as chocolate bars and bags of potato chips;\n\n\nIt will dispense said candies once money has been placed into it and a code has been entered into the keypad, associated with the dispensed candy,\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7278 gained its anomalous properties following a thaumaturgic ritual being performed upon it by an unknown Fae thaumaturgist (PoI-7278).\n\n\nSCP-7278 was discovered on the streets of FP-120 (\"\nEsterberg\n\") on 2/27/2019. The object was given to the Foundation's safekeeping by the Esterberg government.\n\n\n\n\nIncident 7278.01\n\n\nSCP-7278 gained its anomalous properties on 2/26/2019 after the following incident.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2/26/2019\n\n\nSubject:\n PoI-7278\n\n\nForeword:\n The following log was taken by an Esterberg security camera. Footage procured after the incident.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nPoI-7278 walks across the street, whistling slightly. They stop in front of SCP-7278.\n\n\nPoI-7278 produces a 5 z\u0142oty coin from their pocket and places it within SCP-7278. After a pause, the SCP-7278 rejects the coin and PoI-7278 takes it back. They then attempt to place it back into SCP-7278. This repeats approximately twenty times, with PoI-7278 growing increasingly more exasperated.\n\n\nPoI-7278 attempts to use a different 5 z\u0142oty coin and this time succeeds in having SCP-7278 accept the coin. PoI-7278 then types 52 on the keypad, corresponding to a Grze\u015bki chocolate bar.\n\n\nSCP-7278 rejects PoI-7278's coin and its screen displays a \"no designation found\" error. PoI-7278 stares at SCP-7278 for approximately twenty seconds before beginning to bang on and shake SCP-7278. No change is noted within SCP-7278.\n\n\nPoI-7278 then attempts to purchase the chocolate bar, dropping the coin and picking it up several times. Each time they attempt to type a number into the keypad, they are met with a \"no designation found\" error. This repeats for some time, each time being punctuated by PoI-7278 verbally and physically abusing SCP-7278.\n\n\nPoI-7278 shakes their fist angrily and bangs on SCP-7278.\n\n\nPoI-7278:\n Skurwysynu!\n1\n\n\nPoI-7278 glows with Elan Vital Energy as they begin to attempt a thaumaturgic ritual.\n\n\nPoI-7278:\n \n(in Polish)\n I'll show you no designation found\u2026\n\n\nThe recording ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7277\n | SCP-7278 | \nSCP-7279\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7278\n\" by NielleiN, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
