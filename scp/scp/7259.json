SCP-7259 possesses no discernible anomalous features at a glance, besides a constant, high pitched sound\n1\n coming from an unknown location within SCP-7259. The sound has been recorded as inducing a feeling often described as \"doomed\" in individuals capable of perceiving it.\n2\n\n\nDecoding the sound using a spectrogram reveals a distorted, screaming figure. While the image does not seem to be inherently anomalous, individuals have reported heavy feelings of terror when viewing it.\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-7259, while seemingly non-anomalous, forcefully denies most matter entrance. The atmosphere inside has been described as \"impossibly thick\" by individuals when attempting to enter the building, but has shown no noticeable differences in the limited tests that were able to be performed in it.
