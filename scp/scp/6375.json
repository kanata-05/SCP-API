Nonetheless, a small research team of between 2-4 individuals continuously monitors SCP-6375 to prevent any potential unauthorized entry by visitors to Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park. Entrance into SCP-6375 and interaction with SCP-6375-A is generally prohibited and requires special approval from the Regional Director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6375 is a wooden cabin located in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park in Del Norte County, California. It resembles residential cabins constructed in rural America in the mid-19th century and has basic amenities appropriate to that time period:\n\n\n\n\nA fireplace which will automatically light itself via anomalous means if the ambient temperature in the cabin drops below 17 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA single-person bed which has remained unused by SCP-6375-A for all of SCP-6375\u2019s recorded history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA study area consisting of a wooden stool, table, and a lantern which remains permanently lit through anomalous means.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6375 is ordinarily imperceptible to observers due to an unusually strong antimemetic effect. It was only discovered accidentally by the Foundation in 1951 due to an Agent using memory-restoring drugs to track an unrelated SCP object nearby.\n\n\nSCP-6375-A is a male humanoid entity referring to itself as the \u201cChronicler of the Forgotten Stories\u201d. Although SCP-6375 was first discovered in 1951, SCP-6375-A has not aged in that time period and continues to resemble an elderly male in his early-to-mid sixties.\n\n\nSCP-6375-A claims to be assigned by an unknown third party (see Interview Log SCP-6375-A) with the task of completing all unfinished written works of fiction ever created by human beings. Once every 24 hours, a large stack of papers\n1\n will appear in SCP-6375-A\u2019s vicinity. The contents of these papers will invariably be an incomplete work of fiction (or several works), which SCP-6375-A will then complete while retaining the writing style of the original author.\n2\n After being completed, the papers containing the story will disappear from SCP-6375, which SCP-6375-A appears to interpret as them being \"collected\".\n\n\nWhen questioned, SCP-6375-A will express irritation at being interrupted and a desire to resume writing as soon as possible. To date, SCP-6375-A has not required rest or any form of sustenance and has yet to express any discomfort or desire to stop writing. As the stories completed by SCP-6375-A are non-anomalous and have yet to provide any useful information to the Foundation, researchers have been instructed not to enter SCP-6375 or disturb SCP-6375-A except under extraordinary circumstances. Currently, the most common form of stories completed by SCP-6375-A are user-generated fiction of existing universes, or \"fanfiction\u201d.\n\n\nInterview Log SCP-6375-A:\n\n\n\n\nThe following interview was conducted on 22 Feb 1953, two years after SCP-6375-A was first discovered. Subsequent interviews yielded similar responses from SCP-6375-A, leading to the implementation of the current monitoring protocols in 1959. This transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Michael Carlson\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6375-A\n\n\n[Agent Michael Carlson knocks on the cabin door.]\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n Go away! I\u2019m busy!\n\n\n[Agent Carlson opens the door and walks in.]\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n Thank you for being so polite, traveler. Is there something you need?\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n I\u2019m sorry to disturb you, but my superiors have instructed me to ask you several questions.\n\n\n[SCP-6375-A sighs and puts down its pencil.]\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n Who are you?\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n I am the Chronicler of the Forgotten Stories. Until you so rudely interrupted me, I was working on completing a rather fascinating science fiction novel.\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n So you\u2019re a writer?\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n More of a chronicler, as the name implies. I\u2019ve been assigned to complete the stories written by humans that have been forgotten by their creators. An abandoned universe is a terrible thing.\n\n\n[SCP-6375-A picks up its pencil and continues writing.]\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n Have you always used a pencil?\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n What the\u2026no, of course not! My writing materials and papers change over time even as I remain blessedly hidden.\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n I see. Why is your\u2026house is so hard to find? Based on its construction, you\u2019ve been here awhile. We were fortunate to stumble upon you.\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n And I was unfortunate! As you might have guessed, there are countless unfinished stories that need completing. Only a fraction of the tales spun by humans ever reach a proper end without my help. If my task is to ever be finished, I must work in uninterrupted silence, without unwanted distractions.\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n May I ask who assigned you to complete your task?\n\n\n[SCP-6375-A turns around to stare at Agent Carlson, saying \u201cNo\u201d forcefully before turning back around to resume writing.]\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n Is there anything my superiors can do to assist you with your\u2026assignment?\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n Yes, actually. There is one extremely important thing that I require of you and your superiors.\n\n\nAgent Carlson:\n What would that be?\n\n\nSCP-6375-A:\n Get out of my home and stop bothering me!\n\n\n[SCP-6375-A refuses to answer any further questions.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The type of paper generated is whatever is most commonly used in North America at the time. As of 2022, SCP-6375 produced papers in the US Letter style.\n\n\n2\n. Literary analysis similar to that used to identify the author of the political novel \nPrimary Colors\n has confirmed that works produced by SCP-6375-A match the writing style of all original authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6374\n | SCP-6375 | \nSCP-6376\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6375\n\" by ObserverSeptember, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
