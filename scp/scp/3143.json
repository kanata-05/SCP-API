A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-ISMETA) is to monitor online fiction communities for signs of its emergence. When found, an authorized member of the \nPataphysics Department\n is to be assigned to deconstruct it.\n\n\nMTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Freds\") is to investigate any leads regarding possible locations of SCP-3143-A. If found, he is to be apprehended and taken into Foundation custody.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3143 is an intrafictional construct. When active, this construct exhibits the ability to temporarily 'flatten' portions of reality into a script-like narrative. This narrative is derivative of the genre established by North American writers of hard-boiled and noir fiction\n1\n.\n\n\nDuring this period, SCP-3143 takes on the role of the main character (a 1930s private detective) hired to solve a case. All entities flattened by its effect become characters within the narrative surrounding it, exhibiting personalities and attributes typical of the genre's style. The narrative will continue until SCP-3143's actions lead to a resolution consistent with the genre; at this point, the narrative will conclude and reality will revert. Events which occurred within the narrative will be projected into reality; however, entities involved in these events will typically have no recollection of what occurred.\n\n\nSCP-3143 was first noted in 2005 in the \naftermath\n of a containment breach at Site-95. In 2012, the Foundation's Pataphysics Department worked alongside the \nDepartment of Analytics\n to make contact with and apprehend SCP-3143.\n\n\nSCP-3143-A is Murphy Lawden, SCP-3143's author.\n\n\nAddendum 3143.1:\n Interview Logs\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3143/interviews/001.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2012/02/02\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Thaum\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-3143, SCP-3143-A\n\n\nNOTE:\n Dr. Thaddeus Thaum is part of the Pataphysics Department. He has a degree in English Literature, and specializes in the analysis of fiction.\n\n\n\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nINT. MURPHY LAW DETECTIVE AGENCY - NIGHT\n\n\nA light-skinned man sits alone in his office; a blade of moonlight cuts across his face. His trademark trilby hat is tossed thoughtlessly across his desk; a bent cigarette is nearby, left smoldering in an ashtray. His shirt is stained with blood \u2014 some of it might even be his own.\n\n\nHe's got a slug of bourbon in his hand, a slug of lead buried in his chest, and 6 more waiting for the next son of a bitch who comes through that door \u2014 courtesy of his .44.\n\n\nHis name is MURPHY LAW, and if you think his number is up, then you haven't been counting. He's the sort of man you pray for when you need him \u2014 and the sort you curse when you don't.\n\n\nHe is also our NARRATOR. His voice is a husky snarl; as if he's got a throat stuffed full of sand-paper and rusty nails.\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nIf there's one thing the Foundation is good at, it's tying up loose ends. I knew it was just a matter of time before the lab-coats tried to shove me in a box.\n\n\n\n\nThe door to the office flies open. An old man in a lab-coat enters; he's got a scowl so deep it's been carved down into the bone. This is DR. THAUM, and he's here to get to the bottom of this \u2014 no matter what the cost.\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nBut if they wanted to contain \nme\n, they were gonna need a bigger box.\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nHello, SCP-3143. How are you doing, today?\n\n\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted answers. I just wanted out.\n\n\n\n\nMURPHY finishes the shot of bourbon and levels his pistol at DR. THAUM's chest.\n\n\nMURPHY\n\n\n\n\nGive me one good reason why I shouldn't ventilate you right now, doc.\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM raises an eyebrow, folding his arms across his chest.\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nBecause you can't.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nIf he thought I didn't have the moxie to plug him full of lead, then he had another thing coming. Specifically, a whole lot of lead.\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nYou \ndo\n know that I can hear you narrating, right?\n\n\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nWhat the hell was he on about? Something wasn't right.\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nYou're an intrafictional construct; a sapient story that can warp reality. Specifically, you flatten it into a movie script that mimics crime-fiction and hard-boiled noir.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATOR\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn't\u2026 what?\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nAnd let's be honest \u2014 it's not even proper noir. The defining element of the style is the anti-hero; the character with no prospects, trapped in a world with no future. But after reviewing your file, I can see that you don't qualify.\n\n\n\n\nMURPHY\n\n\n\n\nI don't\u2026 qualify\u2026?\n\n\n\n\nDR. THAUM\n\n\n\n\nYour narrative is heroic and simple, with clear villains and heroes. In the end, the day is saved without consequence. That's not hard-boiled \u2014 it's certainly not noir. You're just fantasy escapism dressed up in a suit, a hat, and a drinking habit.\n\n\n\n\nMURPHY:\n Where \u2014 where are we? What's happening?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n You rely on the \ntropes\n of noir \u2014 outwardly rejecting the notion of appearances and style while secretly embracing them \u2014 engaging in a hyper-masculine narrative based around the myth of the frontier, only projected in an urban environment\u2026\n\n\nMURPHY:\n What is this?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n \u2026but you fail to faithfully replicate their complex, dense settings where moral action is all but impossible. You fail to connect to the essence of what makes noir what it is. You are, in a sense, merely parodying it. An unintentional satire, if you will.\n\n\nSCP-3143:\n What's going on?!\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n And on top of it all, your name is based on an absurdly contrived pun.\n\n\nSCP-3143:\n What are you doing?!\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n I'm deconstructing you, SCP-3143. I'm \ncontaining\n you.\n\n\nSCP-3143:\n I\u2026 I don't understand\u2026\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n I'd like to speak with the author, please. Mr. Lawden? Are you there?\n\n\nSCP-3143-A:\n How\u2026?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n Hello, SCP-3143-A.\n\n\nSCP-3143-A:\n Where am I? Who am I?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n You are Murphy Lawden, a retired shoe-salesman from New Jersey. You live alone \u2014 save for your two cats.\n\n\nSCP-3143-A:\n I'm\u2026? Oh, God. How did I get here?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n We believe you accidentally created an intrafictional construct. Do you recall a screen-play of yours? \nIt Always Rains\n?\n\n\nSCP-3143-A:\n I\u2026 I think so. I don't \u2014 oh, God.\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n I think we've done enough for today, Mr. Lawden. I'll give you a chance to rest and settle in; we can continue this interview later, if that's alright with you?\n\n\nSCP-3143-A:\n I\u2026 yeah. Uh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

I understand this must all be quite bewildering.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n So, I've just been trapped? All this time? Narrating, or writing this ongoing story? My memory of all of this is so foggy.\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n Something like that, yes. We found an unfinished copy of your script, \nIt Always Rains\n. That's how we determined who you were.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n God, I remember that. It was\u2026 yeah. I wanted to write, um, write a story, or something, I think? Something like what I read as a little kid?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n Somehow, you managed to bring the narrative to life \u2014 literally. You 'became' the main character, in a sense.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Right. So\u2026\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n If it's alright with you, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Okay. But, uh\u2026 can I ask you something, first?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n Of course.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n You read the script, right?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n Yes.

THAUM:\n Do you want a frank assessment, Mr. Lawden?\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Sure?\n\n\nDR. THAUM:\n It was fairly awful.\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Oh.\n\n\nDR.

Besides, it's not like a fictitious department with fictitious employees has a costly upkeep.\n\n\nOtherwise, leave the article as is. It might contain several inconsistencies (the fact that neither Murphy Lawden nor \nIt Always Rains\n actually exist being the most glaring) but further edits could invite unwanted attention from SCP-3143.\n\n\nOn that note: Let's leave SCP-3143 alone for a while. Yes, we've learned quite a bit about him, but he's also learned quite a bit about us. Until we know precisely how his abilities work, further efforts to contain him could be dangerous. I'm particularly concerned with what he said during the final interview \u2014 it sounds like he thinks we're all just as fictitious as he is.\n\n\nOn a final note: \nSCP-423\n is currently missing.

His trademark trilby hat is tossed thoughtlessly across his desk; a bent cigarette is nearby, left smoldering in an ashtray. His shirt is stained with blood \u2014 some of it might even be his own. He's got a slug of bourbon in his hand, a slug of lead buried in his chest, and 6 more waiting for the next son of a bitch who comes through that door \u2014 courtesy of his .44. His name is MURPHY LAW, and if you think his number is up, then you haven't been counting. He's the sort of man you pray for when you need him \u2014 and the sort you curse when you don't. He is also our NARRATOR. His voice is a husky snarl; as if he's got a throat stuffed full of sand-paper and rusty nails. NARRATOR If there's one thing the Foundation is good at, it's tying up loose ends. I knew it was just a matter of time before the lab-coats tried to shove me in a box. The door to the office flies open. An old man in a lab-coat enters; he's got a scowl so deep it's been carved down into the bone. This is DR. THAUM, and he's here to get to the bottom of this \u2014 no matter what the cost. NARRATOR But if they wanted to contain me , they were gonna need a bigger box. DR. THAUM Hello, SCP-3143. How are you doing, today? NARRATOR He wanted answers. I just wanted out. MURPHY finishes the shot of bourbon and levels his pistol at DR. THAUM's chest. MURPHY Give me one good reason why I shouldn't ventilate you right now, doc. DR. THAUM raises an eyebrow, folding his arms across his chest. DR. THAUM Because you can't. NARRATOR If he thought I didn't have the moxie to plug him full of lead, then he had another thing coming. Specifically, a whole lot of lead. DR. THAUM You do know that I can hear you narrating, right? NARRATOR What the hell was he on about? Something wasn't right. DR. THAUM You're an intrafictional construct; a sapient story that can warp reality. Specifically, you flatten it into a movie script that mimics crime-fiction and hard-boiled noir. NARRATOR This wasn't\u2026 what? DR. THAUM And let's be honest \u2014 it's not even proper noir. The defining element of the style is the anti-hero; the character with no prospects, trapped in a world with no future. But after reviewing your file, I can see that you don't qualify. MURPHY I don't\u2026 qualify\u2026? DR. THAUM Your narrative is heroic and simple, with clear villains and heroes. In the end, the day is saved without consequence. That's not hard-boiled \u2014 it's certainly not noir. You're just fantasy escapism dressed up in a suit, a hat, and a drinking habit. MURPHY: Where \u2014 where are we? What's happening? DR. THAUM: You rely on the tropes of noir \u2014 outwardly rejecting the notion of appearances and style while secretly embracing them \u2014 engaging in a hyper-masculine narrative based around the myth of the frontier, only projected in an urban environment\u2026 MURPHY: What is this? DR. THAUM: \u2026but you fail to faithfully replicate their complex, dense settings where moral action is all but impossible. You fail to connect to the essence of what makes noir what it is. You are, in a sense, merely parodying it. An unintentional satire, if you will. SCP-3143: What's going on?! DR. THAUM: And on top of it all, your name is based on an absurdly contrived pun. SCP-3143: What are you doing?! DR. THAUM: I'm deconstructing you, SCP-3143. I'm containing you. SCP-3143: I\u2026 I don't understand\u2026 DR. THAUM: I'd like to speak with the author, please. Mr. Lawden? Are you there? SCP-3143-A: How\u2026? DR. THAUM: Hello, SCP-3143-A. SCP-3143-A: Where am I? Who am I? DR. THAUM: You are Murphy Lawden, a retired shoe-salesman from New Jersey. You live alone \u2014 save for your two cats. SCP-3143-A: I'm\u2026? Oh, God. How did I get here? DR. THAUM: We believe you accidentally created an intrafictional construct. Do you recall a screen-play of yours? It Always Rains ? SCP-3143-A: I\u2026 I think so. I don't \u2014 oh, God. DR. THAUM: I think we've done enough for today, Mr. Lawden. I'll give you a chance to rest and settle in; we can continue this interview later, if that's alright with you? SCP-3143-A: I\u2026 yeah. Uh, yeah. Okay. Okay. I need to gather my thoughts. DR. THAUM: Of course. [END LOG]",

DR. THAUM: Good. I understand this must all be quite bewildering. SUBJECT: So, I've just been trapped? All this time? Narrating, or writing this ongoing story? My memory of all of this is so foggy. DR. THAUM: Something like that, yes. We found an unfinished copy of your script, It Always Rains . That's how we determined who you were. SUBJECT: God, I remember that. It was\u2026 yeah. I wanted to write, um, write a story, or something, I think? Something like what I read as a little kid? DR. THAUM: Somehow, you managed to bring the narrative to life \u2014 literally. You 'became' the main character, in a sense. SUBJECT: Right. So\u2026 DR. THAUM: If it's alright with you, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. SUBJECT: Okay. But, uh\u2026 can I ask you something, first? DR. THAUM: Of course. SUBJECT: You read the script, right? DR. THAUM: Yes. It was required as part of my preparation for this assignment. SUBJECT: Did you, uh\u2026 did you think it was any good? ( Silence. ) SUBJECT: Uh. DR. THAUM: Do you want a frank assessment, Mr. Lawden? SUBJECT: Sure? DR. THAUM: It was fairly awful. SUBJECT: Oh.

THAUM: I see from your charts you haven't been eating. Do you want to talk about that? SUBJECT: Not really. DR. THAUM: I've also been informed you've been trying to write more fiction about SCP-3143. SUBJECT: Until you took my pencils away. DR. THAUM: Mr. Lawden, that was for your own safety. Until we understand how the anomaly occurred, we can't allow you to \u2014 SUBJECT: Oh, screw you. You just think it's crap. DR. THAUM: I didn't say that. SUBJECT: But you were thinking it. Weren't you? DR. THAUM: I wouldn't call it 'crap'. SUBJECT: Why did you have to stop the story? What was the problem? He was helping people. It was fun. DR. THAUM: That's not the point. We can't have anomalies running around and \u2014 SUBJECT: And what? Telling stories that you don't like? Stories that aren't yours? DR. THAUM: Stories that aren't \u2014 excuse me? SUBJECT: Cut the crap, doc. We both know what's going on here. DR. THAUM: I'm not sure what you're insinuating. SUBJECT: You use a veneer of objectivity to try and create a sense of distance \u2014 of detachment \u2014 to make the incredible seem credible. DR. THAUM: Wait. What? SUBJECT: You cloak yourself in the outward 'trappings' of science \u2014 the terms, the titles, the 'interview logs' \u2014 all in some desperate, contrived attempt to make it sound a little more reasonable, a little more respectable, a little more plausible\u2026 DR.

I recommend we keep them on the books \u2014 they might come in handy, particularly in regards to developing allegorical and metafictional countermeasures. Besides, it's not like a fictitious department with fictitious employees has a costly upkeep. Otherwise, leave the article as is. It might contain several inconsistencies (the fact that neither Murphy Lawden nor It Always Rains actually exist being the most glaring) but further edits could invite unwanted attention from SCP-3143. On that note: Let's leave SCP-3143 alone for a while. Yes, we've learned quite a bit about him, but he's also learned quite a bit about us. Until we know precisely how his abilities work, further efforts to contain him could be dangerous. I'm particularly concerned with what he said during the final interview \u2014 it sounds like he thinks we're all just as fictitious as he is. On a final note: SCP-423 is currently missing. I'm concerned it might have something to do with our little experiment. I'm having some of my people look into it; I'll keep you updated. - Site Director August",
