    "all_text": "rating:\u00a0\n+111\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2178\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Provisional Site-\u2588\u2588 has been established at the base of SCP-2178 in order to provide housing and supplies for personnel assigned to SCP-2178. A circular security perimeter with a radius of three kilometers is to be established around SCP-2178 and regularly patrolled. Because of SCP-2178\u2019s remote location, the possibility of civilians accidentally finding SCP-2178 is extremely unlikely; as such, individuals found attempting to breach SCP-2178\u2019s security perimeter are to be detained as potential persons of interest.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2178 is a large rock formation located in the Himalayas mountain range. From base to peak, it is approximately 162 meters tall; the elevation at the peak of SCP-2178 is approximately 6.5 kilometers. SCP-2178 resembles a closed fist. A human head, designated SCP-2178-1, is affixed to the base of SCP-2178. SCP-2178-1 appears to belong to an adolescent woman of Han Chinese ancestry.\n\n\nSCP-2178 undergoes anomalous changes, creating environmental conditions impossible for its location, in a 360 day cycle. The cycle has five phases of 72 days each.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first phase, SCP-2178 is covered in shrubbery, light forest, and grass. The temperature of SCP-2178 is approximately 15 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second phase, all plant matter on SCP-2178 begins to dry; brush fires are common in this period. Temperature increases to approximately 30 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third phase, all plant matter on SCP-2178 has been completely burned away; SCP-2178 exhibits minimal anomalous activity during this phase. Temperature is approximately 20 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fourth phase, clouds moving from east to west continuously cover SCP-2178, greatly decreasing visibility. Temperature drops to approximately eight degrees Celsius. Expeditions to SCP-2178 during this time have revealed that it is covered in snow despite the temperature being above water's freezing point. Spontaneous magnetic fields pointing in random directions and ranging in magnitude from 50 to 700 microtesla appear in the area surrounding SCP-2178 during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fifth phase, temperature drops to negative three degrees Celsius. Despite the decrease in temperature below water's freezing point, the snow covering SCP-2178 melts, generating streams and rivers which pour down the sides of SCP-2178. The climate surrounding SCP-2178 is perpetually rainy during this period. Analysis of the water produced by SCP-2178 in this period shows that the water is unusually rich in silt and minerals. The flow of water across SCP-2178 enriches the soil, which gives rise to a rapid growth of vegetation, initiating the first phase and re-iterating the cycle.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2178-1 is both alive and conscious. It suffers no injuries from its environment and has no need for food or drink. When SCP-2178-1 is questioned, it does not provide any information about its origins and is extremely disoriented. SCP-2178-1 is aware of its condition, but does not exhibit any signs of distress. It has proven impossible to dig into or otherwise damage SCP-2178, making retrieval of SCP-2178-1 impossible.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-2178-03\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2178-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor James Zhang\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Can you tell me how you got here?\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n What about your name, or where you came from?\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n \u2026name? I don\u2019t have a name, do I?\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Can you tell me where you are right now?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n This is a mountain. I am trapped inside it.\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Uh, yes. Yes, that's right. The\u2014the mountain seems to be impenetrable, so it seems like it\u2019ll be some time before we can get to you, but\u2014\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n Get to me? Why would you want to get to me? It is nice here.\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Right.\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n I do not need a name. I do not need a place. Or a home. The universe is very big. It is very dynamic. For something small and permanent like me, there is no place in the universe to stay without being wiped away\u2026\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Can you please elaborate?\n\n\nSCP-2178-1:\n It is warm here. Who are you?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2178A:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, Provisional Site-\u2588\u2588 personnel apprehended an individual attempting to breach SCP-2178\u2019s perimeter. The individual was identified as Weidong Chen, a Taiwanese citizen. Chen is currently held at [REDACTED] as a Person of Interest. Further details regarding Chen are classified to Level 4/2178 personnel on a need-to-know basis.\n\n\nImmediately after participating in Chen\u2019s arrest, Agent Barnes reported significant mental disorientation and dysphoria. Two days afterwards, Agent Barnes claimed to have new memories of an event in his past that he had not taken part in. Details of this event are classified Level 4/2178; there is convincing evidence that the event is strongly related to SCP-2178.\n\n\nAgent Barnes claims that his symptoms began immediately after directly handling a photograph on Chen\u2019s person. The photograph was of Chen, a woman who appeared to be SCP-2178-1, and a third individual with a digitally obscured face.\n\n\nOn the back of the picture, a note is written in Chinese. Translated into English, it reads:\n\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, an arrogant, crude, trickster decided that he could challenge Heaven. I wonder if you ever thought that things would come to this? Tomorrow, a foolish girl is going to try the same thing as the trickster. Don't worry. All this time, I've known that I am not strong or cunning. So this is insurance. R.W. can't kill me, but even if he is a coward, he has stomach enough to wipe me. Whatever happens tomorrow, this photograph will remember it all, and if need be, it will help me remember. If you ever need to use this, the Hand is finished. If you need to use this and you fail, this is also a good-bye.\n\n\nOne day we\u2019ll look back on this and think that somebody was just playing a trick on us all.\n\n\n\n\nThe photograph has not displayed any anomalous properties since.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a04/2178\u00a0clearance\u00a0required\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument-2178-06\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Use of memory-enhancing paramedication allowed Agent Barnes to recall the anomalous event memory with increased precision. Agent Barnes reported that the event took place in a location resembling known descriptions of the Wanderer\u2019s Library, known to be a base of operations for the Serpent\u2019s Hand, a Group of Interest. The event largely consists of a conversation between a man, described as tall and pale-skinned, with Caucasian features, and a woman, whose face cannot be seen. Her voice is described as young, with a slight Mandarin accent.\n\n\nA transcript of Agent Barnes\u2019 recollection of the conversation is provided below.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nWoman:\n So you went ahead and did it.\n\n\nMan:\n Y\u2014yeah. I did.\n\n\nWoman:\n And?\n\n\nMan:\n There are some things that we just have to do, aren\u2019t there? Look, I don\u2019t like this, I don\u2019t like this at all, if it were up to me we\u2019d never have to do this, and look, okay, I\u2019m still not sure that it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2014\n\n\nWoman:\n Oh, come on. You weren\u2019t sure? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\n\n\nMan:\n I\u2014please, I'm confiding this in you.\n\n\nWoman:\n What do I care what you think? You\u2019ve already cast the die. What can you do to reverse your decision? Will you go to the Book-Burners\n1\n and say, \u201cHaha, just kidding, we\u2019re not interested in getting with your program after all?\u201d\n\n\nMan:\n I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nWoman:\n And there\u2019s nothing you can do to change what you\u2019ve done to the Hand.\n\n\nMan\n I don\u2019t know, all right! Even given what they've done to us, the Book-Burners are bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If we don\u2019t interfere with the status quo, they will protect us as human beings. This was the right decision. I made the right choice. We can\u2019t survive\u2014can\u2019t live on like this. You don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t understand.\n\n\nWoman:\n I don\u2019t understand? I feel like I understand things pretty well. You did this out of cowardice.\n\n\nMan:\n You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to have to fear stepping outside the library, because if you do then men in masks are going to shoot you, or worse, you\u2019ll see someone in here and next time you step outside you\u2019ll hear that they\u2019re dead\u2026you don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like because you\u2019ll challenge whoever you want. You don\u2019t. You don\u2019t know\u2014or worse, worse, you step outside and you\u2019ll see your family again, except they\u2019re behind bars, in a cage forever, while their mind slowly breaks, and even if you find them again you\u2019ll look them in the face and they won\u2019t know who you are. That\u2019s worse, isn\u2019t it? Even the Book-Burners have their mercies if you compare them to the Jailers.\n2\n\n\nWoman:\n You\u2019re fear-mongering. We don\u2019t compromise.\n\n\nMan:\n If we make concessions to them, they will protect us.\n\n\nWoman:\n Concessions? What will you do for those who won\u2019t concede? The ones who will still fight? Or the ones who couldn't integrate even if they wanted to?\n\n\nMan:\n I\u2026I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nWoman:\n We stand for something. Everywhere else, people want to protect their precious consensus reality. \nConsensus reality.\n God, what a joke. So long as reality is decided by a majority, there will always be a minority that has no place in that reality. We are the refuge and the salvation from organizations like the Global Occult Coalition\u2014it's another hilarious hypocrisy, a supposed coalition of the occult that uses the magic it likes to stamp out the magic it doesn't. Don't you remember? When they came for the outcast, we interceded. Or, rather, we did.\n\n\nMan:\n I\u2014\n\n\nWoman:\n And what\u2019s even worse is that you think they\u2019ll keep their word! How laughable. D.C. Al Fine regularly threatens major members of the 108 if they do not toe Her Mightiness\u2019 line. What happens to the Hand under the global reign of the Book-Burners? Even you, for all your lack of spine, have some interests. Your life and safety seem to take precedence. And one day, those things will be in the way of what they want.\n\n\nMan:\n So what\u2019s your alternative, then? How will you keep us alive?\n\n\nWoman:\n Stay alive? Staying alive means fighting. It always has. I have no concrete answers, but let me tell you, I\u2019m more than arrogant enough to say that I\u2019ll accept no world where the alien is marginalized and hunted as a matter of routine under a banner of peace and justice. If heaven will not have you and if you have any pride as a human being, then the only option is to challenge heaven itself. To bring it crashing down.\n\n\nMan:\n We can\u2019t do that!\n\n\nWoman:\n It's been done. I could do it again.\n\n\nMan:\n No. No, earlier, you were right. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say. I made this decision, and I can\u2019t undo it. We need protection. The jailers are never going to give that to us. But\u2026but the book-burners\u2026what the hell are you going to do about this? What are you going to do to me?\n\n\nWoman:\n What am I going to do?\n\n\nMan:\n We\u2019re\u2026we\u2019re friends, right? You can\u2019t just\u2026\n\n\nWoman:\n Ah\u2026your mistress. Bianca, right? She hated you.\n\n\nMan:\n What?\n\n\nWoman:\n She hated you for letting her brother die. I found her crying over one of his pictures one night, and she said that she would never forgive you for that.\n\n\nMan:\n How could you? How dare you? I\u2014I\u2019ll\u2014\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in time, Agent Barnes reports that several anomalous individuals gather behind the man. These individuals appear to lack mouths. All individuals appear to be holding lanterns in their left hands.\n\n\nMan:\n You\u2019re lying to me. Provoking me to attack you, so that the Library makes me pay.\n\n\nWoman:\n Am I?\n\n\nMan:\n You\u2019re not a God, or a hero, or a\u2026a Great Sage Equal to Heaven, that stupid title\u2026Don't you understand? It doesn't matter what your ancestor did. They write books and worship him, not you. You\u2019re like me. You\u2019re scared and weak, and you\u2019re terrified that I\u2019ll find out exactly how weak you are. What have you done? You almost brought down heaven? You never did that. He did.\n\n\nWoman:\n You're calling me weak? That's hilarious.\n\n\nMan:\n You know, if you want to disagree with me, maybe, maybe you should live through what I\u2019m trying to prevent. Maybe if you want to act like you\u2019re as big as your forefather, maybe you should live through what he went through. See\u2026see? You really are his descendant. For his hubris, he was trapped under a mountain of the five elements. And I guess I'm the Buddha.\n\n\nThe man whistles. A doorway appears in a bookshelf next to the man.\n\n\nWoman:\n A Way? How did you\u2014\n\n\nMan:\n I'm doing you a service, all right? You'll find peace. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAfterword:\n Agent Barnes is strongly convinced that the transcribed events are not his memories, and are instead the memories of the woman.

    "containment_procedures": "Provisional Site-\u2588\u2588 has been established at the base of SCP-2178 in order to provide housing and supplies for personnel assigned to SCP-2178. A circular security perimeter with a radius of three kilometers is to be established around SCP-2178 and regularly patrolled. Because of SCP-2178\u2019s remote location, the possibility of civilians accidentally finding SCP-2178 is extremely unlikely; as such, individuals found attempting to breach SCP-2178\u2019s security perimeter are to be detained as potential persons of interest.",
