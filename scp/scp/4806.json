Should an instance manifest in a major metropolitan area, local Emergency Broadcast Systems will be utilized to emit auditory \u2014 and, where possible, visual \u2014 subconscious aversion memetics (SAMs) to deter civilian observation of SCP-4806. Fatalities caused by SCP-4806 are to be officially labeled suicides and published as such in coroner\u2019s reports. Direct witnesses to these deaths are to be administered Class-A amnestics, including any and all first responders. Social media and image sharing activity around manifestations should be monitored and interfered with as necessary to prevent a breach of secrecy.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4806 are tower cranes that appear spontaneously at construction sites in metropolitan areas. As an instance has never been observed being assembled or transported, it is currently theorized that SCP-4806 manifest instantaneously\u2014typically during the early morning. SCP-4806 also appear to manifest worldwide and at random, with instances recorded across 45 countries. Only one instance of SCP-4806 will manifest at a time, and time gaps between manifestations range from two days to five months. It is unclear if SCP-4806 instances are simply identical or if SCP-4806 is a single object manifesting in different locations, though all instances exhibit consistent \u2014though not completely similar \u2014 properties.\n\n\nIn 70% of manifestations, SCP-4806 will remain at their locations for approximately 24 hours before spontaneously demanifesting. Instances carry a strong memetic effect; any individuals working at construction sites, when questioned about SCP-4806\u2019s sudden appearance, appear confused and nonchalant, often stating that the object has been on-site for weeks. Other civilian witnesses also demonstrate apathy toward SCP-4806, even if the materialization occurs under their direct observation. Demanifestation will occur after all construction personnel have left the site or 24 hours have elapsed \u2014 whichever occurs last. After demanifestation, individuals will have no recollection of SCP-4806\u2019s prior existence.\n\n\nIn approximately 30% of instances, however, a vaguely humanoid figure \u2014 designated SCP-4806-A \u2014 manifests at the tip of the crane\u2019s jib\n1\n during midday, typically around 1:30pm. When observing SCP-4806-A, onlookers will become convinced that the entity is a suicidal individual, and immediately begin displaying signs of distress. Because SCP-4806 appear in highly-populated areas, this effect is highly contagious, spreading through crowds rapidly as more and more people draw attention to SCP-4806-A. This spread has been confirmed to be non-anomalous.\n\n\nAfter initial observation, any nearby individuals will inevitably attempt to access SCP-4806 in order to scale it and dissuade SCP-4806-A from suicide. This behavior is often highly aggressive, self-endangering, and frantic, and has included:\n\n\n\n\nAn individual assaulting a construction worker in an attempt to hijack another crane adjacent to SCP-4806 (Incident 4806-25).\n\n\nAn individual ramming his car through physical barriers and into an active construction site (Incident 4806-41).\n\n\nA paraplegic individual exiting his wheelchair and attempting to scale a fence surrounding SCP-4806 (Incident 4806-97)\n\n\nAn infant \u201cgrasping\u201d for the entrance to an SCP-4806-occupied site before wrestling out of her mother\u2019s arms (Incident 4806-182)\n\n\nA news helicopter attempting to land on SCP-4806 to \u201crescue\u201d SCP-4806-A (Incident 4806-203)\n\n\n\n\nShould an individual succeed in accessing SCP-4806 \u2014 either by breaching and ascending the tower ladder or using another object to enter SCP-4806 \u2014 they will inevitably position themselves at the end of the crane jib and attempt to make verbal and physical contact with SCP-4806-A. Though the jib can be elevated upwards of 60m in the air, affected individuals display no signs of vertigo, sometimes pacing back and forth or running across the top beams. They will often begin pleading with SCP-4806 in an unusually distressed manner or attempt to physically force it back from the tip.\n\n\nWhen contact is made with SCP-4806-A, one of the following will occur:\n\n\n\n\nIf the individual stops within five meters of SCP-4806-A, SCP-4806 will instantaneously demanifest, sending any persons currently on SCP-4806 falling, typically resulting in death.\n\n\nIf the individual stops within one meter of SCP-4806-A, SCP-4806-A will extend an armlike appendage to the individual\u2019s shoulder before vanishing. Any individuals currently positioned on SCP-4806 will then cease all vocalization and make their way to SCP-4806\u2019s jib. Once all persons are positioned on the tip of the jib, they will synchroniously jump, at which point SCP-4806 will demanifest.\n\n\nIf the individual makes physical contact with SCP-4806-A, SCP-4806-A will extend an armlike appendage to the individual's shoulder. The individual's figure will begin flickering rapidly before vanishing for 3.5 seconds. During these 3.5 seconds, the individual's corpse will manifest on the ground directly below the tip of the crane jib. The condition of the corpses from past incidents suggest significant trauma consistent with high-velocity impact. Immediately after this span of time, the corpse will re-appear at the top of SCP-4806, slumped over the jib. SCP-4806-A will then vanish and the individual\u2019s corpse will levitate to the entity\u2019s prior position and take its place, at which point SCP-4806 and the corpse will demanifest.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4806.1: Survivor Interview\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Eileen Lawrence\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Todd Macindoe\n\n\nForeword:\n During Incident 4806-249, Lawrence was scaling SCP-4806 in an attempt to reach SCP-4806-A when the object dematerialized. She struck several levels of scaffolding in her fall, and while her ribs and legs were badly damaged, Lawrence survived. After being treated at a nearby hospital, at which she underwent several panic attacks, she was briefly taken into Foundation custody for questioning. Lawrence was told that she had been placed under psychiatric monitoring during her stay and was administered Class C amnestic treatment prior to release.\n\n\n<Begin Log: 18:00, 16 September 2009>\n\n\nMacindoe:\n Ms. Lawrence, are you currently using any painkillers?\n\n\nLawrence:\n No, not right now \u2014 I took some pills last night, but none today. I just woke up, so the pain isn\u2019t too bad.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n Good to hear. \n[Jots down notes]\n How have things been since Monday?\n\n\nLawrence:\n \n[Pauses]\n I don\u2019t know. \n[Chuckles]\n I\u2019ve just been trying to wrap my head around things, I guess.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n That\u2019s understandable; now, I know this might be difficult for you, but I was hoping to get your side of what happened that day. \n[Gesticulates]\n Specifically\u2026 what made you climb the crane?\n\n\nLawrence:\n \n[Rubs face]\n Well, I was getting off lunch and saw a bunch of people crowding around a construction site at \u2588\u2588th and \u2588\u2588nd. And\u2026 when I went to investigate, I saw that they were all panicking \u2014 screaming that someone was on top of the crane and that they were going to jump \u2014\n\n\nMacindoe:\n I hate to interrupt, but I\u2019d like to fast-forward a bit if you don\u2019t mind. Security cameras show you breaking into the construction site along with about fifteen others \u2014 can you tell me why you did that?\n\n\nLawrence:\n \n[Pauses]\n\n\nMacindoe:\n Ms. Lawrence?\n\n\nLawrence:\n I don\u2019t know \u2014 I honestly don\u2019t remember much before getting onto the crane.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n I see. \n[Jots down notes]\n So, from there on, then, what exactly \ndo\n you remember?\n\n\nLawrence:\n \n[Sighs]\n I know I\u2019m crazy.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n No one\u2019s calling you crazy; we just want to know your side of things.\n\n\nLawrence:\n After getting on I just\u2026 blanked. The person or\u2026 whatever that was on top of the crane\u2026 \n[Pauses]\n they were different somehow \u2014 or maybe I was just seeing them from a different angle. Because it didn\u2019t feel like just one person anymore \u2014 like they were an array of people all stacked into one body, going on and on and on but all standing still and compressed into one swollen\u2026 thing.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n What compelled you to keep climbing?\n\n\nLawrence:\n I think that's when I realized just how high up I was. When I looked down, I saw the crane beneath me, but nothing else. The buildings and ground all faded into a colorless fog\n2\n. The metal around me just extended further and further until it just looked like a line\n3\n. But I wasn't afraid of falling. I felt kind of\u2026 like, claustrophobic, almost. I wasn't afraid, but I knew I couldn't stay there, and whoever was on top of the crane \u2014 they were \nit\n. Not my way to safety exactly, but at least my shortcut down. \n[Pauses]\n And that's when reality hit. Or, I guess, when I hit reality \n[Chuckles]\n.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n \n[Jots down notes]\n Before we conclude, Ms. Lawrence, I was hoping to ask you a broader question. Was there anything special about the crane that made you want to climb it? Or about the person on top that made you want to take such drastic measures?\n\n\n[Lawrence\u2019s face pales considerably and she appears to shake suddenly]\n\n\nLawrence:\n I don't think the crane was anything out-of-the-ordinary. That\u2026 whoever was up there, I think they're really what makes it all tick. They want you, and they'll will twist and bend you to get you to follow them up. I think they can bend the crane too \u2014 make it appear and disappear, stretch and\u2026 \n[Rubs eyes and shakes head]\n never mind \u2014 I think I'm still not quite thinking straight. All I can really give you is what I felt then. Once you're on that crane, there's only one way down, and it's the way \neveryone\n else has gone before.\n\n\nMacindoe:\n Thank you, Ms. Lawrence \u2014 I think that's all I need from you. We'll leave you to your recovery.\n\n\n<End Log: 18:05, 16 September 2009>\n\n\nClosing Statement (Macindoe):\n Though I don\u2019t doubt the subject\u2019s belief in her own story, it does not seem we have much here to go from. Without a proper psychological background prior to the fall, it\u2019s impossible to assess whether this story is indicative of SCP-4806\u2019s effects or the subject\u2019s mental state. My professional assessment, though callous it might sound, is that we\u2019re going to need far more data before we can gain any further insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
