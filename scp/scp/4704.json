Containment Hangar 92-\u0394 is to be outfitted with a Scranton Reality Anchor (SRA). Each SRA\u2019s function must be checked on a weekly basis. A minimum of five Level 3 researchers are to remain on site. In the event of a reactivation of SCP-4704 effects, research personnel are to immediately contact Site-01 and record all anomalous adjustments made to the area. SCP-4704 instances discovered outside of Foundation custody are to be immediately recovered and replaced with a 1:1 replica of gabbro, limestone, or sandstone.\n\n\nRevision 2/15/2019:\n Newly-manifested SCP-4704 instances discovered outside of Foundation custody are to be immediately recovered. All civilian elements witness to the manifestation of an SCP-4704 instance are to be detained and administered Class A amnestics. The replacement protocol is deemed unnecessary for these instances.\n\n\n\n\nNotation by the Department of External Affairs:\n\n\nI've received inquiries on the necessity of the replacement policy. SCP-4704's global fame and current importance within the historical culture of the Republic of Costa Rica has made its removal from public knowledge impractical. It is in our judgement that the cost of such an operation would far exceed that of current procedures.\n\n\n- \nM. White, Director, DEA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiquis Delta region, Republic of Costa Rica\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4704 is the collective designation given to an assortment of over three hundred petrospheres\n2\n discovered within the Republic of Costa Rica, specifically that of the Diquis Delta region. These spheres were originally found in clusters of up to twenty instances organized in geometric patterns, ranging in size from about 2.5 centimeters to over 2 meters in diameter, and weighing up to 16 metric tons. Details concerning sculpting and transportation of these spheres are unknown. This is due to the European conquest of the region during the 16th century, resulting in the loss of indigenous knowledge and culture. Accurate dating of SCP-4704 instances proves difficult, as the majority are no longer in their location of discovery. Civilian interference has lead to the relocation of numerous instances to public and private spaces (such as tourist destinations, government offices, parks, and museums), as well as the destruction of many instances prior to Foundation involvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial public discovery of SCP-4704 in 1930 by workers of the United Fruit Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo singular instance of SCP-4704 displays an immediate anomalous nature. Anomalous effects become active when a minimum of two instances are positioned in a specific geometric pattern.\n\nActivated SCP-4704 instances are classified as sonorous rocks\n3\n, being capable of emitting a frequency of 65.40625\u00a0Hz when stimulated. Activated instances respond to the production of musical tones within their vicinity. Frequency and duration of tones which generate a response from SCP-4704 are varied, but inconsistent.\n\n\nInstances possessing active anomalous effects generate discrepancies within the hume field of the surrounding area. These discrepancies are minor, but will at times produce alterations to aspects of the space. Recorded alterations include:\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of flora and Poaceae species indigenous to Diquis Delta region\n\n\nSlight alteration of spacial temperature consistent with climate of Diquis Delta region\n\n\nDegradation of chemical elements within air and/or soil possibly harmful to present organisms\n\n\nThe generation of insects and arachnids native to the Diquis Delta Region\n\n\nGeneration of crops typical in Mesoamerican culture\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4704 are theorized to have been used to alter land for the purpose of cultivation by local Mesoamerican tribes. However, upon the removal of SCP-4704 instances from their position of initial discovery, the anomalous effects of said instance become neutralized. Removal of several instances results in the neutralization of all surrounding instances as well. \nDue to the ignorance of this fact prior to the collection and containment of SCP-4704, it is believed that all instances are neutralized.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n Anomalous nature of SCP-4704 discovered when amateur musician \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 visited the Republic of Costa Rica on 11/21/1996. Subject arrived to location known for possessing SCP-4704 instances and began to play an acoustic guitar. Activated instances nearby responded to this sonorous stimulation, generating effects within a radius of about 20 meters. The Foundation intercepted local security reports to law enforcement and investigated all archaeological sites containing SCP-4704. Shortly thereafter the O5 Council approved the commencement of \nOperation Bag of Sand\n, in which agents seized and replaced all displaced instances, finalizing on 29/05/2002 The following is an interview conducted immediately after apprehension of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Rodolfo\n\n\nForeword:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 hand cuffed to table. Prior to interview subject demonstrates anxiety and aggression towards personnel. Subject expresses suspicion that personnel are members of a government based organization. Interviewer was instructed not to deconfirm this suspicion nor to confirm the events of the anomalous interaction, as to maintain ambiguity. Superfluous data expunged.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Good morning, sir, my name is-\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You can't hold me here!

The flowers! The plants! They just started growing all over!\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n I'm only inquiring. Now, you did not expect these effects?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Why would I?\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, your reaction to these \"flowers\" you saw were caught by a security camera. I've seen the tapes myself. I must say, you were rather excited.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So what? Like I said, it was crazy shit. Stones aren't supposed to make stuff grow.\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n I don't recall mentioning the Esferas. So, you believe they were the source?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I- I was- what?\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I have with me documentation showing this isn't the first of our Esferas that you've visited. And in all of said sites you've played your music. You have been expecting this, haven't you?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \u2026I knew it, I knew you were fucking CIA!\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n I am not affiliated with the United States Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. So please, tell me, what were you trying to do here? What is your interest in our native artifacts?\n\n\nSubject begins to laugh.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Those things aren't native man, no Indians carved those! Wake up! They were \n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Um\u2026 yes, well, but why the guitar?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Because I wanted to make something beautiful with my music. Something meaningful.\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo removes his glasses and sighs\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, enlighten me. Where is it that you learned of this? Where did you get these ideas?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Do I look like a rat to you? I don't need to explain a thing! Doesn't matter anyways, I proved it today!\n\n\nDr. Rodolfo:\n Mmm. Well, I'm sorry to inform you that these effects you claim to have seen were imaginary. There were no growing plants. It was a hallucination.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No! No! I saw what I saw!
