Testing with SCP-7334 may only be performed with written permission from two Level 4/7334 Personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7334 is a pair of two identical clockwork spherical containers, each with a diameter of 1m. Each container houses a portal, designated SCP-7334-A and -B. When inside the spherical containers, the two portals may be moved freely. When a spherical container is opened, the portal within will remain suspended at the position where it was released. If portals are released from their housing, they will behave as a continuous inter-spatial pathway, with items entering one end being subsequently released from the opposite end. The containers weigh less than an object of their size and composition should.\n1\n\n\nAddendum 7334.01:\n Abridged Testing Logs\n\n\nThe following is a series of tests performed with SCP-7334 to ascertain its functions and limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 7334.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n\n\n5/6/2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nBoth ends of SCP-7334 were opened, and a tennis ball was thrown into SCP-7334-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nItem immediately exited SCP-7334-B with the same velocity it had when it entered SCP-7334-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\nSCP-7334 acts as an instantaneous gateway between two points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 7334.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\n5/9/2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nBoth ends of SCP-7334 were opened.

Can you hear me in there, D-2980?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Yeah, I hear you, Henderson.\n\n\nHenderson:\n Okay, good. Looks like we're recording, so you can just start describing your surroundings when you're ready.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Well, it's pretty much just a white void. I can't really-\n\n\nTransmission from D-2980 cuts to static at this time. Test 7334.05 was concluded upon failure to reestablish contact with or retrieve D-2980. However, D-2980's recording continues past this point.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Good, the connection's severed. Okay, how have you been holding up in here? Have you followed my instructions?\n\n\nD-2980's voice can be heard responding to his own questions. Due to differences in amplitude of volume, it is believed that these answers come from a second instance of D-2980, designated here as D-2980-1.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Just like you told me, passing things from one hole to the other based on your diagram.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Good, good. Now it's your turn to get out of here. If you go through that hole, you should go back where you need to be.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n What, back to Foundation custody? Why would I want to do that? At least here it's safe, if a bit boring.\n\n\nD-2980:\n It's not back to Foundation custody, it's\u2026 well, I can't really explain.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Why not?\n\n\nD-2980:\n I didn't last time, and I wouldn't want to risk upsetting the flow of things. Listen, it'll all make sense later. For now, you need to go. The red pickup will have keys in the ignition. Go to Yellowstone. No matter what else happens, you need to get there.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n What are you talking about?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Just do it, okay? That's pretty much your only option, right now. If you don't, well, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead. Oh, before I forget, take this. It'll help the documentation later if you keep records. Trust me, you want to be documenting \nanything\n unusual.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Well, if there's anyone I can trust\u2026 Okay, here goes, I guess. It's that one, right?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Right, and remember to check the diagram for when you should open the portals. I wasn't having you pass that stuff through for nothing.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Ok, well, see you around, I guess\u2026\n\n\nD-2980:\n More like \nbe\n me around, but yeah. Good luck, I'm counting on you.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above log, the recording device contained a series of journal entries made by D-2980-1. The logs were not dated, but D-2980-1 noted the number of each log as it was made. Transcripts of each log have been included below. For simplicity, D-2980-1 will now be referred to as D-2980.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 01:\n\n\nI'm not sure what I was expecting when I stepped through that portal. No, that's not true actually, I had some idea. Monsters. I thought there would be some kind of zombie outbreak or demons or, I don't know, something. I didn't expect to find nothing.\n\n\nNothing's not quite the right word either. Obviously, I'm not in that void any more. From what I can tell, I'm in the average American suburb, but there's no one here. I thought for sure I would need to grab the portals and make a break for it, but there was no one on the other side to see me. Whoever did live here must not have had a very good HOA. The grass is all overgrown. Litter fills the streets. I hadn't registered it before, but I haven't even heard a bird singing since I got here, just the wind and\u2026 metal scratching? It's probably debris blowing around. The ground is littered with metal junk.\n\n\nIs this hell? This is always how I'd imagined it, especially after watching that one episode of the Twilight Zone as a kid. In the show, the guy dies and goes to hell, where he gets everything he ever wanted. He even mistakes it for heaven until he realizes he can't be with anyone. He's totally alone.\n\n\nThat's how I feel. I know I wasn't great before. There's reasons why I got made D-Class, after all, but I'd hoped I'd made up for it by now. Now I'm alone here.\n\n\nNo, there has to be something more to this. He said I needed to go to Yellowstone. Maybe that's where I'll find my answers. He obviously knew what he was talking about, because I can see the red pickup now. I'll update again if anything happens between here and there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 02:\n\n\nIf this is hell, it's not the human one. All along the road I keep seeing mangled machines. They're hard to describe, but they look like they've been here a while. They might have even looked like people, once, but they're all covered in rust. Whatever broke them happened a long time ago.\n\n\nThe machines on the sidewalk aren't the only strange thing about this place. I don't think I've passed a single grocery store since I've gotten here. It's hard to tell, since I don't recognize the writing on these signs, but I haven't seen anything that looks like somewhere you'd get food.\n\n\nAnother thing, this truck is far more advanced than I'd thought. It's definitely not running on gas, but I'm not sure what it could be. I don't even see a fuel gauge. I'm just going to tell myself it's electric and try not to think about it too much. I'm just glad for the GPS touchscreen. I tapped Yellowstone on the map - I used to hike there so often that I know the spot by heart - and began driving. It's going to be a long trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript:\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nD-2980:\n Okay, so I was trying to turn on the radio to listen to some tunes for the drive, but every station is playing the same message. I'll try to capture it, I don't know if you'll be able to hear.\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n -stay indoors. This is an automated message from the United World Safety Association.

This is-\n\n\nD-2980:\n What have I gotten myself into?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 03:\n\n\nI was wrong about the corpses. They must not have known I was here because I was in the truck. I'm not getting out of the truck anytime soon after what I just saw.\n\n\nThere was a pigeon in the road. It was the first flesh and blood creature I'd seen since I ended up here, so I stopped the truck and just watched it for a while.\n\n\nIt got too close to one of the rusted machines. Suddenly, the mechanism sprung to life, trapping the pigeon. As I watched, gears spread over the surface of the pigeon's body. I thought it was being enveloped. The truth was worse.\n\n\nI watched as, over the course of a few minutes, the pigeon thrashed and changed. When it was done, a rusty mechanical pigeon flapped away, its gears clicking as it stiffly beat its wings.\n\n\nIs whatever I'm heading towards really worth it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 04:\n\n\nI saw more strange machines today. I'd started to take it for granted that everything here was dead, but that doesn't seem to be true. The first few I saw were dead, \nrandom mechanical husks\n. Each had a huge eye, unmistakably cephalopod, in the center of its body. I mistook them for just more wreckage at first until I passed close by one. They gave me chills. That wasn't the worst thing I saw today, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript:\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nD-2980:\n Okay, I'm recording this because I feel like I could honestly die in the next few minutes, and I want somebody to hear about this\u2026 thing. Maybe they'll be able to avoid it if they know what to look for. It looks like there's a cloud of white smoke with some guy standing in the middle of it. He's just walking down the middle of the road towards me, but the smoke follows him. I've been a D-Class long enough to pick up bad anomaly vibes when I see them. Maybe if I drive a little ways off the road, he'll ignore me.\n\n\nAn engine is heard accelerating, and the sound of tires on dirt becomes audible.\n\n\nD-2980:\n I think it's working. I'm just going to\u2026 OH SH-\n\n\nA large explosion is heard. The engine accelerates more.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Go go go go go go.\n\n\nMore explosions are heard, growing quieter over time.\n\n\nD-2980:\n (breathing heavily) Okay, I think I'm in the clear. He's started walking east again\u2026 I guess\u2026 I guess I'll just keep driving, for now.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 05:\n\n\nI saw someone today. He stood on a hill in the distance, but I knew he was watching me. I must have seen him at least seven times today, always in the distance, always watching.\n\n\nIf this is hell, he must be the \ndevil\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript:\n\n\nD-2980:\n So, it looks like the entire road here is blocked by a pile-up of those broken robots, and there's guard rails on either side. I'm going to try turning around to find another route. I am definitely not walking through that.\n\n\nA faint metallic creaking sound is heard.\n\n\nD-2980:\n I think there was a split in the road a ways back that should take me around. I guess that does it for this log, then.\n\n\nA loud metallic creak is heard, followed by the sound of metal hitting metal.\n\n\nD-2980:\n What?!\n\n\nA loud metallic scraping sound is heard followed by a crash. D-2980 grunts.\n\n\nA door is heard opening, followed by rapid footfalls and an explosion.\n\n\nD-2980:\n You have got to be \nkidding\n me!\n\n\nMore explosions are heard along with D-2980's panting and running.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Wait, it's shooting at the zombie robots. HAHA!\n\n\nD-2980's footsteps continue as the sounds of metallic screeching and explosions become more distant.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 06:\n\n\nThe truck is gone. Those \nthings\n destroyed it.\n\n\nI almost tried to leave. I had opened the portal, fully prepared to pick a hole in the void and take whatever it gave me. Anything would be better than this. When I opened it, though, a backpack filled with water bottles and food fell out, along with a map of Yellowstone park. One of the rangers' stations was circled in red. It was about a hundred miles out. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to keep going. I should make it in a few days' time. I figure, if things do go south, I could just open one of the portals and leave then.\n\n\nI still see the figure in the distance. I can't tell if it's my imagination, but it feels like it's getting closer.\n\n\nI'm a bit worried that I haven't gotten a gun from the portal yet. Come to think of it, I don't remember putting any sort of weapons through the holes when I was in the void.\n\n\nDoes that mean a gun wouldn't help? I guess I'll just have to tell Satan to get behind me and let him eat my dust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 07:\n\n\nI've seen a lot of crazy things in my time in the Foundation: math problems that create grizzly bears, the living front half of a cat, a reincarnating platypus, things I can't even remember now. In all of that, I can't remember anything quite so out-of-place as what I just saw. While I was making the trek towards Yellowstone, I saw a herd of \ncattle\n grazing. At least, I assumed they were cattle. When I got closer, I saw that they were made of metal, with eyes made from lightbulbs and tails made from umbrellas. It looked like the sort of sculpture you'd see at a flea market, except for the fact that these were alive. I saw that one of them even had calves.\n\n\nAs I watched, a deer walked past the herd. Unlike the cattle, this deer was of pure flesh and blood. Compared with everything else I'd seen so far, the deer seemed to be the unusual one in this scenario. While the deer passed, one of the cattle turned, its horns lowering towards the deer. I jumped when the gunshot sounded. The deer fell to the ground, with the cow that apparently shot it rolling forwards to eat the fresh meat. Are even the cattle here killers?\n\n\nI wonder just how far in the future I've ended up. Hundreds of years? Thousands? The biologist in me is riddled with questions. Did regular cows go extinct, only to be replaced by these to act as, what, robotic groundskeepers? Why do the cows need to eat? Are they partially organic, or is what they eat converted into fuel somehow? Were the calves created that size originally, or can the robot cows\u2026 reproduce?\n\n\nMaybe if I were better versed with machines, these answers would be more obvious to me. For now, I'll need to leave them behind. It's only a few more miles now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript:\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nD-2980:\n -come on come on come on come on!\n\n\nFast footsteps and heavy breathing are audible.\n\n\nD-2980:\n It's not human.

The sounds of metal creaking and sticks breaking becomes louder.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Got it!\n\n\nA door opens, then slams shut. Scratching is audible from the other side of the door.\n\n\nD-2980:\n That was too close. That's it, I'm getting out of here. I don't ca-\n\n\nD-2980 is cut off. There is a loud thump. D-2980 screams.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n Halt! HC-2490, release!\n\n\nA thump is audible, then metallic scratching retreating.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n Identify yourself. Which division of Guard Constructs do you hail from? What is your purpose in returning here?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Guard construct? What are you- uh, are you a robot?\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n Are you\u2026 not?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Last I checked, I was still flesh and blood.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n Flesh and blood, and you are\u2026 sapient?\n\n\nD-2980:\n I\u2026 think so? Not really sure what you mean.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n You are the one we have been waiting for, then. Come with me.\n\n\nThere is wooden creaking audible, followed by metallic footsteps.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Uh, who are you?\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n I was called Mekhane, a scientist of great renown among my people. I have been working here for many years. This machine will serve as the tomb of my people and the birthplace of yours.\n\n\nD-2980:\n What do you mean? What happened to humanity?\n\n\nMekhane:\n Is that what you call your race? If so, nothing has happened to humanity. Humanity has not yet been.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Okay, you've lost me.\n\n\nMekhane:\n Inevitably you have seen the situation outside. The virus is our fault. In our hubris, we sought to replace mother nature's designs with our own. At first, it began with merely copying her designs in our image. It was not long before that was not enough for us anymore. We created the virus to convert what we saw as impure flesh into perfect machines. The populace served as the carriers for this virus, spreading it by their touch. We had not anticipated the effect it would have on them, that all touched by my creation were doomed to be mindless.\n\n\nThis facility is my last attempt to atone for our actions. It is capable of generating a new species. That is why I sent the Hunter Constructs to distribute the portals. They would wait for a subject to arrive, assess their viability, and bring me their DNA. I had not anticipated a subject arriving intact by themselves. Come, let us begin the process so I may pass on my knowledge of the machine to you before I expire.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Me? You just met me. Doesn't that seem a bit\u2026 hasty?\n\n\nMekhane:\n To have made it this far, you must possess the instincts and skills necessary for survival. That is what truly matters if your species is to thrive here. Besides, I believe that, regardless of one's previous life, one such as you would rise to the occasion. I have only one request. Forget me and my people. I would rather my species pass quietly out of memory so you do not aspire to emulate us. It would not go well for you.\n\n\nD-2980:\n How will I stop them from making the same mistakes, then?\n\n\nMekhane:\n I have prepared a process by which you may implant false memories. This should allow for the creation of historical lessons without requiring the tragedies behind those lessons. This will also allow you to recreate your species with minor loss of technological progress should anything happen.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Actually, in that case, could I make a quick trip? I need to get some things from my time.\n\n\nMekhane:\n First, allow me to take a sample of your DNA so I may replicate you should you fail to return.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Thanks for the vote of confidence.\n\n\nMekhane:\n You are welcome.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Log Transcript:\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nD-2980:\n Okay, so you said this can hold how much data?\n\n\nMekhane:\n Approximately 9.99 Googolbytes based on the data measurement method you gave me. I apologize that it could not be more efficient. I had to dedicate space to adapting the Hunter Constructs' camouflage so that only you would be able to perceive it.\n\n\nD-2980:\n I'm sure this will be enough. I've just got to get in, download the data, and bring it back. You said this hole would take me back to when the first D-Class test was performed, right?\n\n\nMekhane:\n Assuming the date you told me paired with my extrapolations of the time offset is correct, yes. I will be awaiting your return.\n\n\nA rush of air is heard.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Okay, so it should be\u2026 uh, hey there.\n\n\nD-2980's voice can be heard responding to himself. Due to differences in amplitude of volume, it is believed that these answers come from a second instance of D-2980, designated here as D-2980-1.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Uh\u2026 who are you?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Don't panic. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm you.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Am I going crazy, or am I dead right now?\n\n\nD-2980:\n Neither, this is real, and this is important. I don't know if it's started yet, but there's going to be stuff floating through here. Here, take this, it shows what holes lead where.\n\n\nD-2980 proceeds to explain which objects will be entering the space and what hole each object needs to be put in.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Also, can you put this recorder back in the hole I came from? I'm not supposed to have it on the other side.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n Sure, if you say so.\n\n\nD-2980:\n See you soon, or, honestly, I'm not sure how time works in here.\n\n\nD-2980-1:\n I know what you mean.\n\n\nD-2980:\n Oh, and avoid any cameras that come through one of those holes, I think it's that one. You should probably turn off the recorder now so the battery doesn't ru-\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation of computer terminals at Site-19 show that Terminal 133 was accessed by the Administrator\n2\n at 1300 hours on 5/11/2001. A data download of 16 zettabytes was performed via the terminal, taking significantly less time than the hardware should allow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Entry 08\n\n\nShe replaced me. I can't believe Mekhane thought I wouldn't make it back! Okay, I can believe it, but I'd hoped she'd wait longer until she cloned me! The clone has my memories, too. I'm going to send it- him. I'm going to send him back to where I'm from so this log can make it back. I know she told me she doesn't want to be remembered, but I want her to be remembered. I think by the time this gets back, humanity should be ready to hear it.\n\n\nI spent a lot of time poring over that data I downloaded. I did a double-take after reading about SCP-2000. I did a lot of double takes after reading all those files, actually. I don't know if I'm ready for this responsibility, but I do know that I have the knowledge and experience to try, despite my past mistakes. I know I wanted to quit before, but now I'm ready to give it my all.\n\n\nTo all who will be, I vow to Secure all threats to humanity. I will Contain anything which endangers the veil of normalcy you all enjoy. I will Protect you.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

    "description": "SCP-7334 is a pair of two identical clockwork spherical containers, each with a diameter of 1m. Each container houses a portal, designated SCP-7334-A and -B. When inside the spherical containers, the two portals may be moved freely. When a spherical container is opened, the portal within will remain suspended at the position where it was released. If portals are released from their housing, they will behave as a continuous inter-spatial pathway, with items entering one end being subsequently released from the opposite end. The containers weigh less than an object of their size and composition should.1",
