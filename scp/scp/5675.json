Anomalous or otherwise suspicious activities are to be reported to the Foundation immediately under the Foundation and UIU's intelligence-sharing protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5675 is a phenomenon affecting residents of Chicago\u2019s Douglas neighborhood. SCP-5675 presents as a cognitohazardous anomaly, through which individuals display adverse psychological responses to garbage collection vehicles operated by the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation.\n\n\nSymptoms of SCP-5675 include paranoia, anxiety attacks, and in several cases myoclonic seizures. In all occurrences of this phenomenon, the affected individual has reported an acrid smell not typically associated with refuse.\n\n\nThe first known incidence was on the morning of 2015/06/03, wherein approximately two hundred Douglas residents reported to local medical services and emergency rooms. SCP-5675 continued, with only the vehicles assigned to the weekly Douglas collection round triggering SCP-5675. Since Foundation observation began, an incident occurred once per week until 2015/11/08 (see Addendum-1). In all cases, an amnestic aerosol was dispersed over the neighborhood and its surrounding environs using an agricultural aircraft.\n\n\nPoI-5675 is Robert Brigham Jr., a local resident with an interest in thaumaturgy and ritualistic practices. Brigham was first identified as a person of interest after triangulation of SCP-5675 events; the most severe symptoms had been seen in individuals near the apartment building where Brigham lived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-1:\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum-1:\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\nThe first SCP-5675 events began approximately one month after eleven year-old Grace Fontaine went missing from the city\u2019s North Lawn area in May 2015. Her disappearance was ruled an abduction by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, though no suspects had been identified prior to PoI-5675\u2019s arrest.\n\n\n\n\nStatement given by Lena Fontaine at press conference the night following her niece\u2019s disappearance:\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got a few things to say to the city of Chicago tonight, on behalf of my sister Joan and her husband Markus. First, the whole family would like to thank everyone who gave their time \u2014 \nhours\n of their time \u2014 to help search for our Grace. Whatever the outcome, whatever lies ahead, we are indebted to your efforts.\n\n\nSecond thing, which should go without saying, is something that you\u2019ve no doubt been hearing time and time again. However, I\u2019d like to reiterate: if anyone knows anything, and I mean \nanything\n, that might help us in our search for Grace, do not hesitate to get in touch with the authorities.\n\n\nOnce again, we thank everybody who\u2019s aided in the search so far. Be that combing the streets or sharing posts on social media, you\u2019re real angels. I\u2019m gonna hand back to the Commissioner right now. God bless. Let\u2019s get our baby back.\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s investigation into SCP-5675 drew the attention of the FBI\u2019s Unusual Incidents Unit. The UIU was keen to establish whether Fontaine\u2019s disappearance was linked to the emergence of SCP-5675 and took over the Fontaine investigation from the wider FBI. \nNOTE: Foundation reservations regarding intelligence sharing with the UIU are currently under review; it is possible that had information about SCP-5675 been passed to UIU contacts earlier on, a connection between SCP-5675 and the Fontaine investigation may have been identified sooner.\n\n\nOn 2015/11/08, the apartment of Robert Brigham Jr. was raided by MTF Iota-10 (\u201cDamn Feds\u201d) in conjunction with the UIU. MTF Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\") was also present, due to the potential risk of cognitohazardous phenomena.\n1\n\n\nBrigham was detained without incident and taken into joint Foundation/FBI custody. Investigators discovered, along with literature relating to various thaumaturgical practices, the polished skull of a young human female. Genetic analysis confirmed that it belonged to Grace Fontaine. A bag containing approximately one kilogram of biological matter was also recovered from the apartment\u2019s refrigerator.\n\n\nFollowing Brigham\u2019s arrest, SCP-5675 events have ceased and the anomaly has been reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-2:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum-2:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Robert Brigham Jr.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Laura Dunnings, UIU\n\n\nForeword:\n Due to the discovery of Fontaine\u2019s remains, the UIU wished to conduct an interview in accordance with Brigham having become an FBI homicide suspect. Two Foundation operatives were present during the interrogation.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n Mr Brigham?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Junior.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n So, Mr Brigham, to cut to the chase: We're almost certain you abducted Grace Fontaine.\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Well I\u2019m not gonna, like, deny it or anything; I mean, you found her skull sitting on my mantelpiece like it was granny\u2019s fine china.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n I've only mentioned abduction. You do understand, Mr Brigham, that your statement constitutes a confession to murder?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n I understand completely.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n And, while we're at it, you want to tell me why you kept the skull?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n It's like a\u2026 like a trophy, I guess. A little something to remember my endeavour by. I polished her all clean - that's to buff the bad spirits right out, so they say.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n \nThey\n?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Occultists. Magic people. They've got stories\u2026 bad things happening to people who abuse their guidance. Karma, you might call it. And I guess this is it.\n\n\nBrigham gesticulates at the room.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n Just so we're clear \u2014 you're talking about the texts we found in your apartment, correct?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Ah, the spellbooks?\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n Officially, we prefer the phrase \u201cthaumic literature\u201d. But go on.\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Well, I\u2019ve dabbled. Just another of my \npeculiar\n hobbies.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n You\u2019ve \ndabbled\n?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n I\u2019m no wizard, ma\u2019am. I couldn\u2019t tell you any thermic\u2026 thermal\u2026 whatever you wanna call \nspells\n off the top of my head. Ain't no use without my books.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n When you say about people who \"abuse\" this\u2026 \nmagic\n \u2014 were you engaging in thaumic practices when you murdered Grace Fontaine?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n I might have\u2026 whispered a sweet something or two into her ear. Something to get her to calm down. She was scared shitless - kicking, \nscreaming\n, all the way back from North Lawn in the back of my car. Screaming for someone to save her, to find her, \"don't hurt me!\" and all that-\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n And did it work? The spell, or whatever you want to call it?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n I mean, I told you I\u2019m not a wizard. She quit squealing, yeah, but kept squirming. Like her mind was somewhere else. That\u2019s why I had to\u2026 had to hit her with the\u2026\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n So that\u2019s how she died? You hit her with\u2026 what, exactly?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n A shovel, I think. Keep one in my truck in case of a Chicago winter. I weren't going to kill her right away. Might not have killed her at all, in fact, but desperate times call for desperate\u2014\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n So where\u2019s the rest of her, then? What did you do with the body?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Between my little ornament and what your buddy pulled outta the fridge, you got her.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n No, the \nrest\n of her.\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n I broke her down. Teeny-tiny little pieces. I been putting bits of her out with my trash every garbage day. Good luck combing the landfills if you wanted to, like, stitch her back together or something.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n And you didn't think to\u2026 get rid of these so-called karmic spirits from what was left of the body?\n\n\nRobert Brigham Jr.:\n Polishing bone's one thing, ma'am, but the best I could do with the other\u2026 stuff was dice her up and sneak her out. Thought it was done and dusted until you came knocking at my door. And, I'll tell you \u2014 if I'd not been brought in, I'd have done it all over again.\n\n\nThe room is silent for a moment while Agent Dunnings and the observing Foundation personnel take notes.\n\n\nAgent Dunnings:\n Thank you, Mr Brigham. I think that\u2019s enough for now, but I\u2019ll be speaking to you again soon.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Brigham was charged with the first-degree murder of Grace Fontaine. Occult literature recovered from Brigham's home corroborates the suggestion that an incantation was performed during Fontaine\u2019s abduction with the intention of \"calming\" his target. Thaumaturgical experts believe that this particular incantation was capable of inducing a side effect not mentioned in the texts, in which the affected victim instead expresses fear and panic through the transmission of ontokinetic energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
