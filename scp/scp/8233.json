SCP-8233 shows signs of damage consistent with continuous disuse, abandonment, and neglect over a long period of time.\n\n\nSCP-8233's site proper holds a series of facility blocks that were presumably dedicated to documentation and research, with many rooms holding filing cabinets and desks emptied of their contents. A farther portion of the building leads to large-scale storage, with slightly separated faculties containing tools utilized in weapons manufacturing. The only room within SCP-8233 with an intact plaque is labelled \"\n\u041b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\n\",\n1\n though it has also been completely cleared out of all materials and equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\u2003\n\n\n[INFORMATION OMITTED: SUB-LEVEL FORMAT]\n\n\u2003\n\n\n\n\nRecovered materials:\n\n\n\n\nA severely vandalized and sodden English copy of \nThe Great Gatsby\n\n\nA severely vandalized and sodden journal written in Ukrainian\n\n\nAn incomplete deck of cards\n\n\nA bloodstained handkerchief\n2\n\n\nA 5-piece Reichspfennig coin\n\n\nA discarded pair of eyeglasses\n\n\nA chipped button\n3\n\n\nFragments of a chess board\n\n\nA rusted scalpel blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2003\n\n\n[INFORMATION OMITTED: SCP-8233-1]\n\n\u2003\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8233 was located following the 1998 routine global anthropological assessment of urban legends and folklore. When overviewing documentation regarding folkloric practices that persisted in communities through the period of Soviet rule, various data points were located for potential investigation, specifically regarding nighttime-tales that were disseminated amongst the children of settlements within and south of Novorybnaya. A roughly-translated nursery rhyme reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Beware the men who watch and stare\n\nAnd do not shut your eyes.\n\nFor they will think you're mocking them\n\nAnd bring on your demise.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther research revealed this to be a piece of folklore passed down to the generations following the second World War, with the elderly insisting upon it as a protective fable used to teach children about the vulnerability and potential dangers brought upon by sleep. Further investigation revealed contradictory origins \nand a significant lack of evidence.\n4\n\n\nTwo agents were sent to the settlement in 2003 in order to interview locals and gauge anomalous activity, leading to the identification of SCP-8233 following the interrogation of the village's local government. After an extended and strenuous process,\n5\n the anomaly was reported to Site-22 and a containment crew was dispatched.\n\n\nFive crude wooden crosses were discovered approx. 65\u00a0m behind SCP-8233's plot, stuck upright in the snow in a straight line. Exhumation of the immediate area recovered a gold wedding band and 217 additional wooden crosses. No human remains were found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8232\n | SCP-8233 | \nSCP-8234\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8233\n\" by Quicksilvers, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
