SCP-6760 is not to be operated without proper clearance, under any circumstances.\n\n\nAll queries suitable for use with SCP-6760 are permitted. However, priority will be given to queries of interest to the Department of Tactical Theology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6760 is a hyper-complex machine intelligence built by the Foundation Department of Tactical Theology. SCP-6760 possesses several experimental components which lend it the following anomalous analytical capabilities:\n\n\n\n\nUltra-high-fidelity probing and mapping of the Infosphere;\n\n\nWidespread pataphysical data-processing;\n\n\nOntokinetic and semiontological reality manipulation \u2014 for the purposes of revealing unknowable and/or inaccessible information.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6760 was built as a software framework, surrounding the existing Foundation artificial intelligence construct CROM.aic \u2014 chosen for its unparalleled analytical processing skillset.\n\n\nSCP-6760 was created for the purpose of determining \"objective truth\" via comprehensive mapping of the entirety of human knowledge and further extrapolation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6760-1, Test Log / Incident 6760-A:\n On 05/14/2030, succeeding permission from the O5 Council, SCP-6760 was activated, and its CROM.aic communications terminal was initialized.\n\n\nCommunication with SCP-6760 is accomplished in the form of data queries; operators may present a data point, object, or entity. This information is then processed by SCP-6760 and a simple descriptive response is generated. SCP-6760 also returns information describing the founder, progenitor, or other creator of the selected concept, but due to fundamental design constraints describes these creator entities as \"authors\".\n.\nShortened to \"\nau\n\" in the command line.\n\n\nComplex queries \u2014 those which are not able to be communicated by the declaration of a single object or entity \u2014 are disallowed, such that SCP-6760 does not respond with potentially dangerous or overwhelming information, which may cause physical harm or harm to the human psyche. It is to be noted that SCP-6760 would actively avoid answering such queries prior to this.\n\n\nThe following are reproduced transcripts of the subsequent tests and interactions with the intelligence.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<\nCROM.AIC\n> Please provide a \nQUERY\n. \nCROM.AIC\n will provide a \nRESPONSE\n.\n\n\n<\nuser\n> crom search new-york-city\n\n\n<\nCROM.AIC\n> PROCESSING\u2026\n\n\n<\nCROM.AIC\n> \n(1) RESULT:\n \nnew-york-city - settlement - population-center - human - author: Peter Minuit\n\n\n<\nuser\n> crom au peter-minuit\n\n\n<\nCROM.AIC\n> PROCESSING\u2026\n\n\n<\nCROM.AIC\n> \n(1e5) RESULTS (MOST RELEVANT DISPLAYED):\n \npeter-minuit - dutch - human - governor.
