Supplies of SCP-5853 are to be contained in a standard containment unit at Secure Facility 64, Wing-F. Any instances of SCP-5853 discovered being sold are to be immediately intercepted.\n\n\nAll episodes of SCP-5853-A have been removed from air and scans for further television broadcasts and online video are to be performed with positive returns to be expunged from their respective platforms. Under no circumstances may any Foundation personnel\n1\n that have children or are considering parenthood be assigned to SCP-5853.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5853 are packaged taffy confections. Each package of SCP-5853 contains two candies: one blue - raspberry flavored, and one red - cherry flavored. While the blue candy has thus far shown no anomalous effects, any individual who consumes the red SCP-5853, after reciting the key phrase, will be transported to an extra-dimensional space. This space coincides with the features of \u201cTicky Taffy Town\u201d, henceforth referred to as \u201cSCP-5853-A\u201d, a 90's era television program that advertised SCP-5853 prominently.\n\n\nThe anomaly was brought to the attention of the Foundation by way of the UIU, who had become aware of an apparent correlation between disappearances of children and the airing of SCP-5853-A. SCP-5853 is theorized to be responsible for the disappearances of an estimated 3500 children between the years 1994-1999\n\n\nSCP-5853 Document File 1: Discovery\n\n\n\n\nNotable connections between child disappearances are as follows:\n\n\n1. Parents of missing children have reported that their child was last seen within, or assumed to be heading into, a kitchen pantry.\n\n\n2. Upon searching for missing children, the only evidence found in the vicinity were open Ticky-Taffy wrappers. In all cases the cherry-flavored portion was not present, leaving the blue raspberry portion.\n\n\n3. The previously aired episode of SCP-5853-A had the appearance of a secondary character, \u201cMr. Hister\u201d.\n\n\n4. In all cases in which the parent was nearby upon the disappearance of the child, music of the show\u2019s theme song could be heard.\n\n\nThe anomaly was relinquished from the UIU to the Foundation following the disappearance of a UIU operative's child. Formal request for SCP designation was sent to Administration with notable documentation contained henceforth.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5853 Document File 2: SCP-5853-A Character Descriptions\n\n\n\n\nPhysical descriptions and characteristics of the 5 main \u201ccharacters\u201d, henceforth referred to as \u201centities\u201d, of SCP-5853-A:\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1\n:\n\n\nMr. Squibbles\n\n\nDescription:\n A bipedal humanoid figure with the head of a plush octopus. Entity is approximately 3.2 meters in height and consistently wears khakis and a red sweater vest.\n\n\nPersonality:\n Takes the role of a father figure within SCP-5853-A. Has a patient and benevolent manner, and often touts the episode's lesson.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2\n:\n\n\nMrs. Bobble\n\n\nDescription:\n A female entity dressed in attire similar to that of a stereotypical clown, with blue hair, white makeup, red nose and an over-sized, multi-colored blouse and cargo pants.\n\n\nPersonality:\n Entity is often portrayed as a bringer of questions to SCP-5853-A-1 concerning the day\u2019s lesson or theme.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3\n:\n\n\nKizzy Wink\n\n\nDescription:\n A small entity roughly 1 meter in height that resembles a bipedal feline. Possesses humanoid hands and an oversized head in comparison to the size of the remainder of its body.\n\n\nPersonality:\n Entity is often the perpetrator of the events that illicit the need for a daily lesson and theme. Often benign, but mischievous, the entity is the surrogate avatar for the young audience.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4\n:\n\n\nFranzipans\n\n\nDescription:\n A small, rotund, plush-like avian entity roughly 0.3 meters in both length and wingspan. Entity has an anthropomorphic hammer in place of a beak. Despite its small wingspan, entity is able to fly and will often hit the other entities as a form of physical comedy.\n\n\nPersonality:\n Appears to be the companion pet of SCP-5853-A-3, often annoying SCP-5853-A-1.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5\n:\n\n\nMr. Hister\n\n\nDescription:\n A 2.3 meters high, presumably male\n2\n humanoid entity with a long, golden-yellow hooded-robe. Entity uses tentacles that emerge from beneath its cloak as a means of transport. Attempts at obtaining facial descriptions have proven difficult due to the significant distorting effects it has on SCP-5853-A recordings when entering the video frame. Current attempts to describe its face note that it resembles a misshapen, tumorous human skull.\n\n\nPersonality:\n While the entity is not depicted as hostile by SCP-5853-A, it is visually and verbally disturbing.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSCP-5853 Document File 3: Critera & Relevant Info\n\n\n\n\nAll episodes of SCP-5853-A that contain SCP-5853-A-5, typically start with hyper-colorized, pleasant lighting and tone, as consistent with that of children\u2019s programing. The main cast of entities (SCP-5853-A-1 \u2014 4 ) will act as normal throughout the first half of the episode while learning about the day's lesson. Teachings include tying shoes, the importance of brushing teeth, locking doors, listening to your parents, and telling the truth, et cetera. The mood is often bright, and after the episode's opening montage, the theme song continues to play along in the background.\n\n\n\n\nTheme Song & Background Music \nPrior\n to SCP-5853-A-5\u2019s Entrance\n\n\nLyrics removed as potentially cognitiohazardous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nOctopus and clown time\n\nHammer bird and feline\n\nNo time to feel down time\n\nNo time to feel down time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when SCP-5853-A-5 enters the frame, noticeable distortions appear. Distortions include, but are not limited to: dulled video quality, over-saturation of color, and substantially decreased contrast. Additionally, the usual upbeat background theme is transposed from C-Major Ionian to B-Locrian.\n\n\n\n\nTheme Song & Background Music \nDuring\n SCP-5853-A-5 Effect\n\n\nLyrics removed as potentially cognitiohazardous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nChildren of the Crown time\n\nRed of flesh and death time\n\nDreamlands wait for all time\n\nDreamlands wait for all time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\nIt\u2019s Ticky Taffy Town time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen on screen, the subject matter changes quite drastically as SCP-5853-A-5 offers stark nihilistic messages about reality, existence, death, and time. SCP-5853-A-1 \u2014 4 will show signs of distress at the content of SCP-5853-A-5's speech and will attempt to offer positive counterarguments, but these are inevitably refuted by SCP-5853-A-5. Some of note are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n- \u201cTo exist is such a holy endeavor, that the Gods find it impossible.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI met God the other day, I stared at Him, and He stared back. I cried and He cried. I laughed and He laughed. When I went to embrace Him, my hands could not pass through the Mirror.\u201d\n\n- \u201cFlesh is not the truth.\u201d\n\n- \u201cYour parents will soon die, and so will you.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDays have become weeks, and weeks have become moments, seconds long, decades apart. Time is ebbing, flowing, undulating as a worm through the dirt, moving towards the beak of a bird. For a long time, it has only been the ever infinite now.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI feel nothing but the nothingness.\u201d\n\n- \u201cYou may not believe in the slaughter, but the slaughter believes in you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nUpon departing the scene, SCP-5853-A-5 will remark \"I shall now be departing to the land of right, with the truth of red to be my might\" as it enters the large dresser with the words \u201cMr. Squibbles\u2019s Treasure Chest\u201d written on the top.\n\n\nFollowing SCP-5853-A-5's departure, the episode will continue as if SCP-5853-A-5 had never visited; none of the main characters will mention the previous conversations or events.\n\n\nIt is believed that SCP-5853-A-5\u2019s closing remark may have some role to play in the disappearance of the children.

D-Class is to be monitored using standard medical equipment. Junior Researcher is to scan infrared, ultra-violet and other frequency wavelengths of audio-visual data for anomalous, cognitohazardous, or memetic activity. Ethics Committee Consultant is to sit in on the test. Lead Researcher is to signal to begin the test.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Lead Researcher, Frank Monroe commencing with test SCP-5853-1. We are using SCP-5853-A episode 03, season 01, the first appearance of Mr. Hister, SCP-5853-A-5.\n\n\nTracy Klaus:\n Vitals steady, everything normal.\n\n\nD-643980:\n What do you freaks have for me this week?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A episode begins.\n\n\nD-643980:\n What the shit is this?!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Please D-Class, just watch the show.\n\n\nAs the show opens, D-643980 begins watching more intently. While initially a cognitohazard is suspected, scans from Junior Researcher Morgan Eskew reveal no anomalous influence.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Morgan, everything looking good on the additive levels?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n All good sir, a small increase in Hume, nothing but indeterminacy can\u2019t shrug off.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Say Doc? I assume there\u2019s some \u201cDoc\u201d watching all this. Why this show?\n\n\nTracy Klaus:\n Heart rate increasing, as well as perspiration.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, we are investigating a new anomaly. That\u2019s all you need to know.\n\n\nD-643980:\n It's just\u2026 I got some memories with this show. My younger brother, he used to watch this show all the time, until he\u2026 until he disappeared. \nD-643980 sighs\n. I miss him.\n\n\nUpon hearing this, Jennifer Lam is visibly shaken. Dr. Monroe, Mrs. Lam, and Researcher Eskew all look at one another.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Mrs. Lam?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Give me a minute.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Mrs. Lam, do we proceed with this D-Class?!\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Give me a moment! What I want to know is, how the hell this wasn't vetted!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n I'm so sorry about this, but I have no idea how this was missed. Morgan! Any change in Hume or hazard?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n It's the same as before. There's been no change.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Lam! Do we proceed?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n I\u2019m thinking, damnit!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 makes it appearance on screen.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Lam?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Proceed! I\u2019ll take the hit if anything comes of it.\n\n\nD-643980:\n \nTo himself.\n Man, I don\u2019t remember the show getting this dark. Jeremy\u2026 watched this shit?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Thank you. You make the calls I can't.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Well, it is my job.\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Alright, let\u2019s focus on the test.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n \nWhispers under his breath.\n How\u2019d we miss that?\n\n\nThe show continues. SCP-5853-A-5 departs, and the show has its closing song, credits roll, and the show ends.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Well, that was fucken weird.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, are you ready to proceed to the next part of the test?\n\n\nD-643980:\n I mean, I don\u2019t have a choice, do I?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Not really. Just trying to be cordial.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Yeah all these straps\u2026 real cordial.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Agent Bekolev, please undo torso restraints on the D-Class.\n\n\nAgent Bekolev:\n Copy.\n\n\nAgent Bekolev proceeds to un-latch the leather restraints on D-643980. Researcher Klaus removes the monitoring equipment and attaches a mic, earpiece, receiver, and shoulder camera mount.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Fancy toys, this must cost a fortune.\n\n\nTracy Klaus:\n Spare no expense.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Agent Bekolev, please remove shackles and hand restraints. Upon removal, you are authorized to terminate the D-Class should he fail to register any command within five seconds. D-Class, do you understand?\n\n\nAgent Bekolev readies his firearm by engaging the slide.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Yeah\u2026\n\n\nAgent Bekolev:\n Copy sir.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Agent Bekolev, please hand D-Class the SCP-5853 package.\n\n\nAgent Bekolev:\n Copy.\n\n\nAgent Bekolev puts an package of SCP-5853 into D-643980\u2019s hands.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Oh shit! I haven't seen these in years. They're like a novelty now, huh? I always liked the raspberry; Jeremy always took the cherry\u2026\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, on the back of the box you will find a phrase taped to it. Please eat a red piece, and the red piece only, then say the phrase.\n\n\nD-643980:\n What kind of weird ass\u2026\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Five seconds, D-643980. Bekolev?\n\n\nD-643980:\n Okay! Okay! Okay, Jeez.\n\n\nD-643980 consumes the red SCP-5853 candy and recites the key phrase.\n\n\nD-643980:\n \u201cFlesh is not the truth.\u201d\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Sir, Hume levels are now rising. I think we\u2019re in.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Perfect, D-Class, please sit down and report anything strange.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Okay, umm, no, nothing\u2026 wait\u2026 what?\n\n\nVideo feed from D-643980\u2019s camera distorts and the theme song of SCP-5853-A can be heard.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Fuck!\n\n\nD-643980 disappears from the observation area.\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Hume levels returning to baseline.\n\n\nTracy Klaus:\n Switching to D-Class Audio-Visual.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class. Come in D-Class. Can you hear me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5853 File 6: Testing Log-1-2\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5853\u00a0File\u00a06-Testing\u00a0Log:\u00a01-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nD-643980 Audio-Visual Log-Transcription\n\n\nD-643980\u2019s video feed is completely black except for one single stream of light splitting down the center field of view. D-634980's audio shows slight signs of static and distortion, but remains intelligible.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Yes, copy. I mean, fuck. Shit, where did you send me? Where am I?\n\n\nVideo feed from D-643980 shows that he attempts to turn around and return but is met with blackness and an audible thud.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n We don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why you\u2019re there. Move forward please.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Well, I don't have anyone pointing a gun at my head anymore, so I ain't doing shit. I'll just stay here until you come get me.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n If we get you, D-Class, you will be terminated. Just do what we say and things will be fine.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Are you fucking kidding me? \nD-643980 sighs.\n Okay, fine, I'm moving forward. There's this door. It seems like I'm, uh, like I'm in some kind of big closet.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Please exit if you can.\n\n\nD-643980 pushes open the doors and falls out on. The shoulder camera spins as D-643980 stumbles, revealing \u201cMr. Squibbles\u2019s Treasure Chest\u201d.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Jesus!\n\n\nD-643980 stands up, the video feed shows the rest of the room. The theme song of the show continues in a loop in the background. The room is an exact replica of the SCP-5853-A set, however locations that aren't shown during the airing of episodes \u2014 or otherwise remain unseen to the general audience, are filled with blank, white backdrop. The sound of a door opening can be heard. SCP-5853-A-1 through -4 walk through the front. SCP-5853-4 is skipping and speaking indistinctly. D-643980 returns to hide in \u201cMr. Squibbles\u2019s Treasure Chest\u201d.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, please extend the camera out so that we can see.\n\n\nD-643980 opens the chest's door slightly and points the camera outwards.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n What a day! We sure did learn a thing or two!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4:\n Wouldn\u2019t be another wonderful wacky Ticky Taffy day if we didn\u2019t!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4 flies around the room and bumps SCP-5853-A-1 in the head.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n My tentacles!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2 - 4 laugh.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Cut that out you two! We only have a bit longer before the town meeting!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2:\n Oh boy! I hope someone brought some good ones!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n I\u2019m sure they will be great, like all the others! I for one, am looking forward to it!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n As always! I don\u2019t think we got any yet.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2:\n Yes, usually we would see them by now.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4 flies toward the camera. D-643980 pulls the camera back inside, D-643980's breathing is fast and labored.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4:\n Can\u2019t forget to check! To check!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1 opens the doors and looks down at D-643980.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Oh, what pleasure! Hello there, little boy! Welcome to Ticky Taffy Town! I am Mr. Squibbles.\n\n\nD-643980 screams.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n Why is this one so loud? And so big!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Little boy, it is alright! Mr. Squibbles doesn\u2019t mean to cause you fright!\n\n\nD-643980 stops screaming, the camera feed is noticeably shakey.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Sir, what do you want me to do?\n\n\nBoth SCP-5853-A-1 and Doctor Monroe reply.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Just have a seat and calm down. Come join us for the engagement in town!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Engage with entities while we form an extraction plan.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Engage?!\n\n\nBoth SCP-5853-A-3 and Monroe reply.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n Ment! It\u2019s the gathering after we all learn our lessons.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n We will be sending a team in shortly for extraction. Remain calm, retreat only if absolutely vital.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Fuck, ok.\n\n\nSuddenly SCP-5853-A-2 loses all its color and turns a glowing red.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2:\n What did you just say, young man?\n\n\nThe camera feed starts warping, and video quality drops substantially.\n\n\nD-643980:\n I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry. I was scared.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Mrs Bobble, do calm down. If the boy was scared, he's allowed to to express himself. However, young sir, do find better language to do so, if you would please. It\u2019s not good to make Mrs. Bobble upset, lest you fail his righteous test. Do you understand?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, do not, in any circumstances anger the entities! It may mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\nD-643980:\n \nReplying to both simultaneously.\n Yes sir.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n What\u2019s your name, kid? Why are you so big?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, I have a hunch. Do not let them know you are an adult.\n\n\nD-643980:\n My name, uh\u2026 is uhh, Davey and I have a\u2026 umm\u2026 growth disorder, my\u2026 uhh, bones are really big, you see.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Remarkable! Well Davey, we must be off to the town meeting! You will join us as our esteemed guest.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, please proceed, we need to see the extent of the anomalous area.\n\n\nD-643980:\n \nQuietly.\n Sounds great\u2026\n\n\nD-643980\u2019s camera feed is led outside the front door of the domicile. D-643980 turns the camera around to show that on the front door there is an address number that reads \u201cS01E03\u201d.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n That\u2019s very interesting, hey Eskew?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Yes Doctor?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Can you bring me the list of all the episodes of SCP-5853-A that feature Mr. Hister?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Oh. Oh, oh! Yes! I See.\n\n\nOutside the house, the surrounding area is made up of the miniature town that is only seen briefly in the opening sequence of the show. All structures, buildings and roads are made and stylized exactly as the miniature set-pieces would be, however are to full scale. Past what could only be seen in the immediate areas in the opening sequence, the larger space drops off to the same vacant white backdrop as to what was seen in the SCP-5853-A house. Scattered throughout this large expanse is other copies of the town, each with their own SCP-5853-A house. The towns have no regard for placement, some being located overhead or below across the vast whiteness. A long pathway leading from each house converges to a single location in the distance. This location is that of a small-town square, containing a cobblestone roundabout and a large fountain in the center. D-643980\u2019s camera is whirled around as the group walks.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n D-Class, wait. Point your shoulder up to the diagonal right, about a half turn, and then at one o\u2019clock.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Huh?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Jen, what do you see? D-Class, please follow that request.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Yeah, okay.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2:\n Aww, now Dave! Don\u2019t sound so down! Can\u2019t be blue when you\u2019re with this clown!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4 then flies into SCP-5853-A-1\u2019s head.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n My tentacles!\n\n\nAll entities burst out laughing. D-643980 nervously chuckles.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Heh.\n\n\nD-643980\u2019s camera feed pans up and to the right.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Monroe, see that?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Huh?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Eskew, zoom in.\n\n\nD-643980\u2019s camera feed zooms in on one of the long roads the distance. There are other versions of SCP-5853-A-1 - 4 walking down their respective road.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-643980, please turn your camera view so that we may see some other roads out there. Can you see anything?\n\n\nD-643980:\n Uh, yeah, I can, but I gotta stay quiet.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3 turns to D-643980.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n Don\u2019t be quite! Start a riot! You\u2019re stuck here now, might as well try it!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Good point D-Class, just try to point your camera at the other pathways in the distance.\n\n\nD-643980 raises a thumbs up into the camera feed.\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Here it is Dr. Monroe.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Thank you, Eskew.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n There! \nLam gasps.\n Oh God. There's a kid with each group. I've counted 3 so far.\n\n\nD-643980\u2019s camera feed shows that small children are walking with each of the groups of SCP-5853-A-1 - 4.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, please if you can aim your camera at one of the entities\u2019 homes that are in the towns floating around you.\n\n\nCamera feed from D-643980, shows him hold up a quick middle finger, before the motion of the camera is aimed at a distant entity house.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Eskew, zoom further. Can you make out the number on the door?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Barely.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Oh man. It reads \u201cSierra\u2026Oscar\u20263\u2026Echo\u202613\u201d.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Ok so, yes\u2026 ok, so season three, episode thirteen, is on the list of episodes featuring SCP-5853-A-5.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n How many seasons was this show on?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Five.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n And how many episodes in each season?\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n Twenty-seven.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n So exactly how many episodes are stealing children?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n We\u2019ve counted thirty\u2026 umm\u2026 thirty-one episodes with Mr. Hist\u2026 umm SCP-5853-A-5.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Jesus, with re-runs, VHS sales, and that crazy internet showing everything now\u2026 how many children? Hundreds? Thousands?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n I would gather.\n\n\nMorgan Eskew:\n We gotta know how to properly contain this thing then!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Alright, MTF it is. I\u2019ll submit the request.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n You\u2019ll need my endorsement. Which I am not willing to give.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Huh?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n I\u2019m sorry, but we can't send countless MTF ops into some place we know absolutely nothing about. That could just end up as a needless loss of life.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Jen!\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n I hate this as much as you do, but we're in no position to do anything right now outside of pulling this from the public and containing it. For all we know, the children are already dead.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n So, what do we do with the D-Class?\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n We gather as much information as we can now, and then try to get him the hell out later.\n\n\nD-643980 whispers into his mic.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Hey, guys, we\u2019re here.\n\n\nCamera feed pans up as Researcher Eskew zooms the camera back out to bring the panorama function online. All the SCP-5853-A-1 - 4 entities from each episode have gathered at the fountain. Over one hundred entities and over two hundred children can be seen. D-643980 and his respective entities are located immediately at the fountains edge with children and other entities crowding around. Most of the children are in a state of petrified fear, while others look sleep-deprived, most are crying. The entities converse amongst themselves in a strange, unknown language. As the last of the groups make their way to the area, the continual background theme stops.\n\n\nAll the entities in unison:\n I now arrive to the sea of sin, with the red of my flesh to offer him!\n\n\nFrom a point in the white, 15 meters above the fountain, a large 3 by 2-meter mirror-like rectangle appears. The rectangle starts spinning until the blur of its motion creates a black void, out from which SCP-5853-A-5 emerges.\n\n\nUnison:\n Mister Hister!\n\n\nThe mirror behind SCP-5853-A-5 slows down to a stop, its reflective surface expels a continuous stream of white light. From the white back-drop surrounding the space, hundreds of dark humanoid entities materialize, each motionless, suspended upside-down in the air. Each humanoid entity is the size of a child.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class, focus in on SCP-5853-A-5. Do not interact, unless advised.\n\n\nD-643980:\n \nWhispering.\n Just get me out of here, okay?\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n We\u2019ll do our best.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 speaks. Its voice is a combination of many overlapped whispers and hisses. When it speaks the suspended figures twitch and shake.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Hello, my children. How is everyone today?\n\n\nThe crowd of SCP-5853-A entities cheer and jump.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n That\u2019s so good to hear. My children, it is time to tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A entities continue cheering.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Ennie, Meanie, Minnie, Moe, catch a sinner by the toe.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 points long, slender, bony finger at one of the children opposite D-643980 on the other side of the fountain.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Yes, you my child. What is your name?\n\n\nThe child is a female with blonde hair, approximately four to six years of age. She appears disturbed.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:\n Um\u2026 Ummmm.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n My child, do I frighten you? Don\u2019t you remember Mister Hister?\n\n\nD-643980:\n \nWhispers into mic.\n This doesn\u2019t look good.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Just observe D-Class. It's all we can do for right now.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:\n \nThe child nods.\n I\u2026 My name is Bethany.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Well Bethany, why don\u2019t you come up here and tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.\n\n\nOne of SCP-5853-A-5\u2019s many tentacles extend from beneath its robe and picks up the child. The child screams. As she does, the other children are seen trying to run away, but are all intercepted by an SCP-5853-A entity.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Oh, Bethany, do not cry, have no fear. Just tell Mister Hister what he wants to hear. Did you learn your lesson today?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:\n Yes.. \nThe child sobs.\n Yes, I did sir\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n And what was the lesson? Say it so all the other children can hear.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:\n I\u2026 Um\u2026 Today I learned from Mr. Squibbles that it is um.. important to tie your shoes in his special way, so they don\u2019t\u2026 um\u2026 come lose all day.\n\n\nThe cheer of an SCP-5853-A-1 entity can be heard from somewhere in the crowd.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Oh, Bethany, that is so good, and so smart of you. Your prize is to pass through the mirror and into the Dreamlands!\n\n\nAll SCP-5853-A entities cheer in unison.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A Entities:\n The Dreamlands!\n\n\nThe SCP-5853-A-5 tentacle throws the child into the mirror behind it. The child\u2019s cries are cut off as her body crosses the threshold. The mirrored surface increases in luminosity. This causes more children to try to run. The SCP-5853-A entities again restrain those who attempt to flee.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Jesus.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Who is next? How about you friend?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 uses its tentacles to acquire a young male child, with brown hair and glasses, approximately seven to nine years in age.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Hello my child. What is your name?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:\n Tommy\u2026 \nSobs.\n Tommy Mathis.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Ahh Tommy! You look like such a smart boy with your glasses. Can you tell Mister Hister, did you learn your lesson today?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:\n I um\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Take your time, Tommy.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:\n I remember today you told us that you met, um God the other day\u2026. you\u2026. uh\u2026 stared at him, and\u2026 he stared back. You uh cried and he cried too. Um\u2026 You laughed and he did too. You went to hug him, but your hands could not umm\u2026 pass through the\u2026 the\u2026 Mirror.\u2019\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n What a smart boy you are! And so rare! Not for this world!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 sighs, as the child it was holding vanishes. SCP-5853-A-5 then turns to the other children.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n I do like when that happens. Who\u2019s next? How about you?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 grabs another child, male, black hair, five to seven years of age.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n And what is your name young man?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:\n \nThe child is sobbing uncontrollably.\n I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Don't be afraid, I just want to know your name.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:\n I\u2026 I\u2026 Tyrone\u2026 Please.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Well Tyrone, can you tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:\n I\u2026 I\u2026 didn\u2019t pay attention\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t know!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n You didn\u2019t learn anything Tyrone?\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:\n No\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Well then Tyrone, you are now going to learn your lesson.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 holds the child over the fountain and begins to flay them starting with the legs. Small chunks of flesh are removed by the tentacles' serrated suckers while the child screams in pain. The child can be seen and heard screaming. Blood and flesh fall into the fountain causing the water to turn red. As SCP-5853-A-5 works its way up the child\u2019s body, it tears away at pieces of skin and flesh and tosses them into the fountain. The SCP-5853-A entities surrounding the fountain rush in and begin to devour the pieces. This causes the remaining children to attempt escape. Video feed from D-643980 shows that he also attempts to flee. All around the tentacles of SCP-5853-A-5 start to grab children at a much faster rate, skipping the pervious introductions and going straight to asking each child what lesson they learned. The many voices comprising SCP-XXX-A-5\u2019s speech ask multiple children at the same time. As each answer they all met fate of the previous children based on their responses. (See Addendum SCP-5853-3)\n\n\nD-643980:\n Fuck, fuck, fuck, what do I do?!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n Try to find shelter of some sort! Anywhere!\n\n\nIn their panic, some of the children run over or are pushed off the side of the floating precipice of the town center. Their bodies, immediately lifted into the air to become a part of the floating figures above SCP-5853-A-5. D-643980's screams are heard as his video feed is pulled rapidly upwards. As D-643980 is above the fountain, dozens of children\u2019s bodies can be seen, dismembered, skinned, quartered, and partially, if not almost completely, eaten. The SCP-5853-A entities gnaw and tear at pieces of flesh as they wade through the fountain, which is now filled with blood, bone, and viscera. SCP-5853-A-5 turns to D-643980.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Well hello there! You're quite the hefty child, aren't you? No matter. Pray tell, what have you learned today?\n\n\nD-643980:\n My Name is Dave. Dave\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n And Mr. Trenton, what did you learn today?\n\n\nD-643980:\n How do I respond?!\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n \nMonroe can be heard flipping rapidly through pages of episode transcripts.\n: Umm\u2026 S01E03\u2026 Umm the lesson there was\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n What was that my friend?\n\n\nD-643980:\n I\u2026 I remember, on my way here\u2026 I was told by Mr. Squibbles: \u201cDon\u2019t to make Mrs. Bobble upset, lest you fail his hideous test.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5:\n Oh, my dear child, so close\u2026 You should know the consequences of your actions. You are to exist for all stars, amongst your brothers.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Wait. No. No. No!\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-5 makes an unseen injury on D-643980 and then lifts them to the sky with the other suspended humanoid figures. Video feed from D-643980 shows that a young boy of nine to eleven years of age is suspended upside-down along with D-643980, who is also upside-down. The child is unrecognizable except for identifying clothing. The skin and muscle of show years of decay and dehydration.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Jeremy!\u2026 Is that you!\u2026 Oh Jeremy! Oh, no! I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry! No! Please! Please wake up! No! Jeremy!\u2026 Can you hear me! Jeremy!\u2026 Please.\n\n\nLater investigation shows the clothing belonged to that of a Jeremy Trenton who was reported missing to the FBI and later UIU under strange circumstances.\n\n\nD-643980:\n Oh Jeremy\u2026\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-Class?\n\n\nOne-minute of silence.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-643980?\n\n\nOne-minute silence.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n D-643980, please show sign of life.\n\n\nFor three days, the camera feed from D-643980 can be seen, suspended upside-down next to the body. A continuous stream of red fluid, presumed to be blood, flows constantly over the camera lens. Of note, the volume of blood seen passing the shoulder cam of D-643980 throughout the three days is in excess of eighteen times the amount of blood found in the human body.\n\n\nThe feed is terminated three days later.\n\n\nFrank Monroe:\n I'm sorry, Dave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: SCP-5853-A-A\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\u00a0SCP-5853-A-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to SCP-5853, it is to be noted that UIU Agent Mathis\u2019s son, Thomas, was returned to his personal household kitchen pantry. Contact was made at 03:00am PST, 01-08-2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: SCP-5853-A-B\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\u00a0SCP-5853-A-B\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nRegarding SCP-5853 and latter D-Class explorational logs:\n\nFull understanding of these parameters for any future explorations into/experiments involving SCP-5853-A are necessary. Note that these findings were made from extensive viewing of the recorded evidence of a single D-Class exploration log, and may be inaccurate:\n\n\n-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a lesson from the aired SCP-5853-A episode, they are passed through the \u201cMirror\u201d.\n\n\n-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a lesson from being in the extra-dimensional space, they are left to hang with the other suspended entities.\n\n\n-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers that they don\u2019t remember what they learned, didn\u2019t pay attention, didn\u2019t learn anything, or lie (this can also mean giving lessons from an episode other than which episode the SCP-5853-A-Child viewed), the child is, in variable ways, tortured, killed, and consumed.\n\n\n-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a repetition or summation of the phrase Mr. Hister says in the episode, the child will disappear, to be transported back to the kitchen pantry from which they left.

Ensure cameras are on. Stay frosty.\n\n\nDelta & Charlie:\n Heard.\n\n\nAll MTF cameras show a black void with a single opening of light shining through. Alpha pushes the interior door open and light floods the camera\u2019s view. After the balance settles, the interior set of SCP-5853-A can be seen. An exaggerated kitchen to the right and an overly decorated living room to the left. The exit can be seen ahead, along with three windows. Outside is completely white.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Scan everything.\n\n\nDelta:\n Yes sir.\n\n\nThe MTF team spreads out into the small set area. Each camera detailing the setting. MTF-Delta\u2019s feed shows a living room with an exaggerated TV set and an oversized reclining chair. MTF-Charlie\u2019s feed shows him rummaging through the kitchen area, finding utensils made of rubber and foam.\n\n\nCharlie:\n Command, you seeing this? It\u2019s all fake.\n\n\nCommand:\n Noted Charlie. Alpha, progress to the town square area.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Copy. Team, let\u2019s go.\n\n\nSuddenly, the door to the set area can be heard being opened. Charlie takes a position hiding behind the large recliner. Delta ducks down behind the kitchen counter. Alpha rushes back into the dresser.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Maintain positions. Weapons hot.\n\n\nCommand:\n Team, do not, under any circumstances, engage with the entities.\n\n\nCharlie & Delta\u2019s camera feeds continue in limited capacity, showing the entities' movements.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-3:\n What a day! We sure did learn a thing or two!\n\n\nThe SCP-5853-A-3 jumps into the recliner.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-4:\n Wouldn\u2019t be another wonderful wacky Ticky Taffy day if we didn\u2019t!\n\n\nThe SCP-5853-A-4 flies around the room and bumps SCP-5853-A-1 in the head.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n My tentacles!\n\n\nThe SCP-5853-A-2 - 4 entities laugh.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Cut that out you two!

To check!\n\n\nThe SCP-5853-A-1 entity walks over to the cabinet, opens the doors and looks down at Alpha.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Hello there, little boy! Welcome to Ticky Taffy Town! I am Mr. Squib\u2026\n\n\nAlpha opens fire. The rounds connect with the entity. Brown rust-colored fluid is seen leaking from the body mass of the SCP-5853-A-1 entity. It stumbles backward and collapses on the floor.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1:\n Owie.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-1 ceases movement. 6 seconds passes as the other SCP-5853-A entities look at the body.\n\n\nCommand:\n Terrence! I told you to not engage.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Fuck, Frank, there isn\u2019t much else to do! We are cornered!\n\n\nEvery MTF feed records the sound of a sharp scream, followed by many more. The 3 remaining entities in the area also begin screaming. The exterior white surrounding the area dims turning black. After 4 seconds the entities stop screaming. All is quiet and black.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \nQuietly.\n Okay command, switching to NODs.\n\n\nCharlie:\n Copy.\n\n\nDelta:\n Yes sir.\n\n\nFeeds from MTF switch from black to night vision. Delta's feed peaks around the kitchen counter. No entities besides SCP-5853-A-4 are in sight within the domicile. Feed from Charlie shows the SCP-5853-A-4 entity suspended in mid air, unmoving, above the incapacitated SCP-5853-A-1 entity.\n\n\nCommand:\n Alpha, this is no longer an exploration mission, the objective is extraction. Priority One is to get you and your team to the Town Center, and tell SCP-5853-A-5 the key phrase.\n\n\nAudio feed begins to degrade substantially, while video feedback reduces from approximately 93% to 87%.\n\n\nCommand:\n \u2026 Sacrifice\u2026 Chaos\u2026 Perception\u2026\n\n\nAlpha:\n Command?\n\n\nCommand\u2019s signals are no longer audible in the recording.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Command?\n\n\n3 seconds of static.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Team, entities clear, evac.\n\n\nDelta:\n Copy.\n\n\nCharlie:\n Negative.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Report Charlie?\n\n\nCharlie:\n I still have an active threat in sight, Alpha.\n\n\nAlpha:\n What is it doing?\n\n\nCharlie:\n Hovering, its stationary. But\u2026 like glitching.\n\n\nFeed from Charlie shows the SCP-5853-A-4 entity phasing in and out of location, appearing in both static and transitory forms.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Charlie, head for the door first. Delta and I will suppress. We will follow up behind you once threat is eliminated.\n\n\nCharlie:\n Rodger.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Three\u2026 two.. one\u2026 go!\n\n\nCharlie\u2019s feed begins to rapidly move towards the interior/exterior door. Alpha\u2019s feed emerges slightly from the dresser. Delta\u2019s feed rises from behind the kitchen counter, the barrel of his rifle partially obscuring the frame. Both MTF feeds observe Charlie attempt to approach the door, the SCP-5853-A-4 entity returns to normal function. The entity speeds at Charlie\u2019s head, making contact and propelling the agent into the neighboring wall. Alpha\u2019s camera shows that the injury is instantly fatal, as Agent Charlie\u2019s cranium appears to shatter upon impact with the wall. Alpha and Delta proceed to open fire upon the entity. The agents continue to engage fire until the entity is brought from flight to immobile on the ground. Gunfire quickly subsides.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Go! Moo! Head toward door!\n\n\nDelta:\n Yes, sir!\n\n\nAgent Delta\u2019s feed shakes from behind the kitchen counter and towards the door. Feed from Alpha shows five claws and a shadow pass outside one of the windows. As Alpha opens the door, from the left, the SCP-5853-A-1 entity grabs Agent Delta. The SCP-5853-A-3 entity then uses it claws to tear out a large portion of Agent Delta\u2019s abdomen. Agent Delta continues automatic gunfire upon SCP-5853-A-3 until it ceases movement. SCP-5853-A-1 screams. Last signal received from Agent Delta was of his own hands pulling the pin on an incendiary grenade, while charging the SCP-5853-A-1 entity.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Moo! Fuck. One of you fuckers left. Where are you?\n\n\nFeed from Alpha shows the shadow of SCP-5853-A-2 bouncing in and out of frame.\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2\n Miss Bobble is upset\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-A-2 is seen from Alpha\u2019s feed. The entity is charging at inhuman speeds. Alpha fires a grenade round from his secondary. The impact blows a hole in the entity, and it ceases to move, remaining upright in its prior charging stance. Alpha\u2019s feed rushes across the SCP-5853-A set and exits the building. The entire area is completely black, except what can be illuminated by standard issue MTF - NOD equipment. A narrow pathway is seen, as well as a dim light in the distance.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Frank, what the fuck? Well, hell, if anyone is even getting this anymore. If I don\u2019t make it outta here, please give all my love to Jesse. Let Caleb know, his father loved him so much. Teach him to not make the same mistakes I did.\n\n\nThe camera feed from Alpha continues in night vision down a narrow path towards the growing light in the distance. The sound of SCP-5853-A\u2019s theme song is notably absent.\n\n\nAlpha:\n I hate Non-Euclidian shit\u2026\n\n\n182 minutes of travel goes by, and the distant light is no longer in front of the path, but above it. Alpha\u2019s camera feed points upward, suddenly shifts, and loses focus.\n\n\nAlpha:\n I feel like being pulled by something. I'm on a lower path now. Deeper, longer\u2026\n\n\nAlpha\u2019s feed slowly brightens until the entire feed is whiteout. Second to last notable feed shows Alpha approaching the Town Square.\n\n\nAlpha\u2019s feed goes to static for 8 minutes.\n\n\nAlpha\u2019s feed returns, showing Alpha\u2019s hand reaching out and opening a white wooden door. Past the door is a room with a young woman in a rocking chair. The woman is humming to an infant in her arms. The woman looks up to the camera. The woman appears to be Jesse Bazarian, Agent Bazarian\u2019s wife.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Jesse?\n\n\nSCP-5853-?:\n Hello\u2026 my, child.\n\n\nThe entity holds the infant up.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Jesse\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5853-?:\n See the Mirror. Through the Mirror. The Mirror is the only Salvation. Salvation achieved by sacrifice to He Who Is Divine Among the Dreamlands. Release yourself through the Mirror. Ascend through the Mirror.

Miles,\n\n\nI regret to inform you that I am no longer able to fulfill my duties as Researcher.\n\n\nI have come to the realization that Lam was right. Although, I don\u2019t agree with her. I can\u2019t keep trying to save the world from the things we study. It\u2019s not about how far I can probe. It\u2019s for our own protection.\n\n\nI need to know when to call it quits. I could spend \u2018X\u2019 number of dollars and \u2018X\u2019 number lives, sacrificing to whatever\u2026 to wherever I think, or wherever I think the \u2018Mirror\u2019 may bring us, who \u2018Mr. Hister\u2019 might be, or the implications of a clown entity called \u2018Bobble\u2019. I could try to chase these down to their penultimate conclusion, sacrificing MTF, D-class and children alike.\n\n\nLam, she was right. God I\u2019m sorry, Terrence. At the end of the day all SCP-5853 needs is to be hidden. In the dark.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just not made for this. Not anymore. I can no longer do this. Let me forget. Let me go back.\n\n\nConsider this my resignation.\n\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\nDr. Frank Monroe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5: [STAFF RESIGNATION: DENIED]\n3\n\n\nAddendum: SCP-5853-A-C\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\u00a0SCP-5853-A-C\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nFormatted Document Contents:\n\n\nFurther investigations into production staff and actors turned up no leads. Analysis of SCP-5853-A\u2019s closing credits revealed that instead of staffer names, the credits consisted of a continually growing list of names. Cross-examination into both Foundation and UIU records show that all known names of children who have been reported missing due to what is believed to be SCP-5853-A's effects are listed on the credits. Cross-referencing of the credits against known missing children shows that only 17% of children listed are known to the Foundation and UIU.\n\n\nOf note, as of 1-23-2000, the names Robert Faulk, Mohammed Al Abi, Terrence Bazarian, and Frank Monroe have been added.\n\n\nFrank Monroe is currently M.I.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5853\n\" by JayKillbam, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
