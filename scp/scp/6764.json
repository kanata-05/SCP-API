Communications with SCP-6764 are to be transcribed, with individuals involved amnesticized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6764 is an entity who communicates via textual digital outlets, primarily short messaging services such as personal text components, in English-speaking countries. The phone number by which SCP-6764 uses to contact an individual varies with each instance, and investigation shows that these numbers exist and can be linked to ordinary individuals. Despite this, SCP-6764 will always refer to the number as belonging to itself. There are no discernible patterns related to SCP-6764 contact events, and the entity has been shown to be able to communicate in locations with little or no internet connection at ordinary speeds.\n\n\nSCP-6764 self-identifies as \u201cMadeline\u201d or \u201cMaddie\u201d, an adult female of unknown age and ethnicity who claims to be located in an area near the individual it is contacting, though a physical presence has yet to be observed. Upon initiating contact, SCP-6764 will explain to the individual that it is inconvenienced, lost, hurt, or \u201cstuck\u201d, and requires assistance. SCP-6764 will then, regardless of whether or not the individual has chosen to continue contact with the entity, request said assistance.\n\n\nShould an individual continue contact with SCP-6764, the entity will attempt to guide them to its location. This will, if followed, result in the individual's death, the cause of which varies depending on the context of the encounter and the surrounding environment. However, a lack of engagement by the individual or a recognition of the obvious danger that would result from following through with SCP-6764\u2019s requests \nusually precludes this.\n\n\nAddendum.6764.1:\n Communication with SCP-6764\n\n\nThe following are transcripts of communication logs with SCP-6764, sourced from various encounters.\n\n\nEvent.6764.24: \nRecovered from the phone of Derrick Gerald, a student at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYo, it\u2019s Maddie from chem class.
