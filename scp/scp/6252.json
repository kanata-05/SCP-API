Regions with elevated levels of Thelxinoe\n1\n spore propagation are to be routinely monitored for presence of SCP-6252.\n\n\nSCP-6252 specimens may only be collected with the expressed permission of the Niftski Castle Site Director. Any person attempting to gather or consume SCP-6252 without permission is to be terminated immediately. No known methods can neutralize a person who has consumed SCP-6252 (such persons are referred to as SCP-6252-A). All current containment efforts are currently focused on threat mitigation and the development of pacification techniques in the event of SCP-6252 ingestion.\n\n\nIndividuals assigned to the Support Member Brigade (SMB)\n2\n are to consume at least 20\u00a0kg of bananas a month\n3\n in order to maintain elevated blood serum potassium levels, which are to be checked monthly.\n\n\nAll on-site staff are to wear Darbian 2C-rated\n4\n(or higher) protective goggles at all times.\n\n\nIf a person is observed to consume any amount of SCP-6252, then the \nK-Osmic\n5\n Protocol is to be initiated in order to minimize potential collateral damage. All staff assigned to the Niftski Castle Site are to be trained to operate the \nK-Osmic\n Dispenser Klaxon in the event that the automated SCP-6252-A detection system fails.\n\n\nThe first instance of human SCP-6252 consumption took place 13 September 1985\n6\n. An incident report of this event is provided below. For access to full reports on each SCP-6252-A occurrence and up-to-date findings from the Niftski Castle Research Team, please contact the site's communications director Lewis E. Giovanni.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6252 spore print used to produce concentrate and to propagate additional specimens.\n\n\n\n\nK-Osmic\n Protocol and Dispenser Klaxon System\n\n\nThis procedure consists of all known methods of minimizing damage and loss of life in the event of a person consuming SCP-6252. Dispersion arrays are installed throughout Niftski Castle and the surrounding 2\u00a0km exclusion zone\n7\n. Each array is designed to draw in SCP-6252-A and to selectively inhibit several physical capabilities until the subject can be subdued following cessation of SCP-6252 effects.\n\n\nActivation of the \nK-Osmic\n Dispenser Klaxon will trigger all arrays within 100\u00a0m of the activation point in order to control the activity of SCP-6252-A. Any subsequent detection of SCP-6252-A outside of the initial 100\u00a0m area will result in activation of additional dispensers.\n\n\nThe following items are dispensed by \nK-Osmic\n arrays and are listed in their order of dispersal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispensed Item\n\n\nEffect on SCP-6252-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\u00a0cm golden disks\n8\n\n\nAttention manipulation\n \u2013 SCP-6252-A have a compulsion to collect round, golden objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotassium Vapor\n\n\nMobility limitation\n \u2013 Adheres to skin and pulmonary tissue in order to increase potassium levels resulting in decreased muscle contractility and strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmmastrephidae\n9\n dye\n\n\nDecreased visual acuity\n \u2013 Specially formulated compound that bonds to ocular membranes and reduces visual capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuided \nChelonoidis carbonarius\n10\n shell\n\n\nDaze\n - Capable of stunning for several seconds following direct contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiftski Castle shown after restoration efforts were completed in 1988.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-6252 refers to a species of mushrooms that grows exclusively in the area surrounding Niftski Castle located near Mount Tsurugi in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. Persons who consume SCP-6252 are referred to as SCP-6252-A. The active phase following ingestion of these mushrooms tends to last for 4m54s.\n\n\nSCP-6252 and its byproducts have the following effects following human consumption:\n\n\n\n\nIncreased strength and speed exceeding any previously observed non-anomalous human capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResistance to physical damage including harm from small arms fire and explosives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of 15-20% in both height and overall mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBioluminescence resulting in a rapidly modulating color display which may blind people without adequate PPE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect contact with other human beings results in instantaneous combustion and they are immediately rendered into ash. [Of note, all of their clothing and belongings remain intact following this process.]\n\n\n\n\nThe SCP-6252 research team is currently developing compounds based on the mushroom's extract for such uses as boosting mission performance of MTFs, increasing efficacy of various medical treatments, and testing with other anomalies. As well, it is being us\n\n\nSCP-6252 samples are available for use during testing following submission of a research proposal as well as authorization from the overseeing Site Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT REPORT\n\n\nSUBMISSION BY:\n JR. RESEARCHER ALICE NOLMY\n\n\n\n\nThe biennial FAnoCom\n11\n Symposium was held at the newly established Niftski Castle Site on 13-SEP-1985. In attendance were 56 Foundation mycologists and junior research assistants. Attendees presented their research on 12 Novel Ecology Submissions (NES), one of which was a report by Dr. Bowman Serafini who discovered what would later be classified as SCP-6252 \u2014 at the time he referred to this as his namesake \"BowSer Cap.\" His presentation focused on the process of using spore prints to propagate anomalous fungi and to synthesize concentrated extract as well as the effects of SCP-6252 shown in animal studies.\n\n\nPresentation topics included newly discovered or synthesized mycological substances, each of which may be potentially beneficial for the Foundation either as a research aid or for use in direct applications. Of note, Dr. Jay Scarbo\u2019s NES was noticeably disjointed and incongruent with his personality and previous presentation style\n12\n.\n\n\nFollowing the presentations, a peer review process began in order to aggregate the research presentations into a report for submission to the Foundation Director of Mycology, Dr. S. Miyamoto. All members of the review board elected to deny inclusion of Dr. Scarbo\u2019s research in the final report stating:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Scarbo's conducted a series of poorly managed studies which are not fit for inclusion in this report nor do they embody the research standards of the Foundation. Dr. Scarbo\u2019s failure to utilize sufficient precautions resulted in the disfigurement of dozens of Foundation staff. These deformities include: enlarged mandibles, over growth of the lower canine teeth, ocular enlargement, darkening of skin tone, and necrosis of the upper extremities leading to auto-amputation.\n\n\n\n\nA notice was submitted to Dr. Scarbo's Site Director, Dr. Elvin Gadd, requesting that he undergo a psychological evaluation prior to allowing him continued use of his research privileges.\n\n\nAt approximately 19:30 local time, Dr. Scarbo entered into the laboratory of Dr. Serafini where he was able to locate samples of SCP-6252 extract and ingest a large quantity of the concentrated substance. He then proceeded to break through several walls and enter into the Niftski Castle Conference Hall resulting in collapse of portions of the castle's infrastructure. Ultimately, security forces were unable to have any meaningful effect on Dr. Scarbo\u2019s at this time.\n\n\n\n\nPin previously awarded by FAnoCom to recipients of its \nAward in Mycological Exploration\n.\n\n\n\n\nAfter entering the Conference Hall, he proceeded to kill the 85 staff within. All causes of death were determined to be due to instantaneous disintegration upon physical contact with Dr. Scarbo. Subsequently Dr. Scarbo began to fervently search for all seven \nAward in Mycological Exploration\n (A.M.E.) pins that were present among the ashen piles.\n\n\nHe then proceeded further into the castle toward the dormitories. He entered into my personal room knocking over several pieces of furniture and demanded that I provide him with additional SCP-6252 concentrate. I informed him that the print's essence was in a different part of the castle.\n\n\nDr. Scarbo continued to approach me, but he misstepped and slipped on a banana peel that had fallen from my trash can causing him to spiral in place and collapse to the ground.\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-6252 then subsided and he was apprehended by site security.\n\n\nWhen asked why he assaulted the FAnoCom conference and what his goal was he stated:\n\n\n\"It's A.M.E.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. An aerosolized byproduct of SCP-6252 growth. However, this is also known to correlate to the development of various mycological anomalies.\n\n\n2\n. Staff members who maintain site security systems and respond to \nK-Osmic\n alarms.\n\n\n3\n. If unable to do so due to food allergy, please refer to the SMB Dietary Guide for acceptable alternatives.\n\n\n4\n. The Darbian scale is used to measure effectiveness against a specific subset of anomalous visual injuries related to modulating color fields.\n\n\n5\n. A contraction of \nPotassium\n (K) and \nOsmolarity\n referring to the highly concentrated potassium vapor used during this process.\n\n\n6\n. This lead to the deaths of 82 Foundation staff members and the destruction of a significant portion of the Niftski Castle gatehouse.\n\n\n7\n. Each array is to be evaluated quarterly by SMB staff in order to ensure proper functionality.\n\n\n8\n. 3D-printed using golden filament per design specifications located in the facility archive.\n\n\n9\n. Lesser flying squid.\n\n\n10\n. Red-footed tortoise.\n\n\n11\n. Fungal Anomaly Community\n\n\n12\n. An effect later identified to be due to exposure to the \nFungus Regnum\n variant of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6252\n\" by Barbarous Bread, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Dr. Scarbo's conducted a series of poorly managed studies which are not fit for inclusion in this report nor do they embody the research standards of the Foundation. Dr. Scarbo\u2019s failure to utilize sufficient precautions resulted in the disfigurement of dozens of Foundation staff. These deformities include: enlarged mandibles, over growth of the lower canine teeth, ocular enlargement, darkening of skin tone, and necrosis of the upper extremities leading to auto-amputation.",
