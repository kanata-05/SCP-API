In the event an individual survives multiple strikes within their lifetime, they are to be questioned, in order to ascertain any similarities between instances.\n\n\nIf any underlying cause for SCP-7166 is discovered, research into possible methods of neutralization is to be prioritized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7166 is a phenomenon affecting individuals who are struck by lightning. This phenomenon does not appear to affect all victims of lighting strikes, but SCP-7166 has been found to occur at higher frequencies if:\n\n\n\n\nThe individual is struck by lightning, but survives,\n\n\nThe individual retains higher brain functions,\n\n\nThe individual resumes everyday activities after recovering from the lightning strike (e.g. work, leisure, family, etc.), and\n\n\nThese activities place the individual outdoors.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who meet these criteria, designated SCP-7166-1, will become significantly more likely to experience lightning strikes. This effect appears to be cumulative with repeated strikes, as individuals who survive more than two strikes become far more likely to experience a third strike, and so on. This effect will only demanifest following either SCP-7166-1's cessation of outdoor activities, loss of higher brain functions, or death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sanderson, come on. Time to give it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure I understand, ma'am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7166. There's nothing there. You know it, I know it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMa'am, I can assure you, I've been looking into this. There's more here than meets the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger, I'm worried for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou haven't taken a SINGLE day to grieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork takes my mind off it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullshit. I know what happened, Roger. I've seen it before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don't know a damn thing, Brooke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou really think you're the first person to try to find a reason? To not be able to accept what happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm reassigning you to \n765\n. You are to focus solely on its containment. If I catch wind that you're looking into this again, I will personally have you demoted. Am I understood?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 2\n\n\nEvery day I think I'm closer to a breakthrough, and every day I come up short. They wanna cut my funding. They want to classify it as explained. I will NOT let that happen. I know the truth. I know what I saw.\n\n\nBrooke's sending me to the fucking duck pond. Supposed to be clearing my head. But there's nothing to clear. What a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 3\n\n\nArrived at the pond today. The staff there are very lax. Too lax, if you ask me.\n\n\nThe project lead here is a woman named Whittaker. Helped me get acquainted with everything. Talks a lot.\n\n\nThere's a thunderstorm on the forecast for Friday. I'm gonna see what I can learn from it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 4\n\n\nWhittaker came snooping by today. Of course, no tangible signs of my research. So she went on her way.\n\n\nTalked with one of the other researchers, name's Adrian. Or, Dr. Mather, rather. First person I've talked to here who seemed to actually care what I had to say. Or, at least, pretended to care. The way he talks reminds me of Jason: paints these big sweeping pictures with words, tries to get you just as excited as he is. Certainly the least intolerable person here. He talked at length about the different ducks he'd seen here. I guess I pretended to care, too.\n\n\nThis storm is supposed to be a nasty one. Apparently all staff are going to be sequestered in a storm shelter on the premises. I'll either have to peel off from the crowd when they head that way, or sneak out once everyone's inside. Either way, no one can know. I don't want anybody else getting caught up in this mess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 5\n\n\nMather caught me working. I made him promise me not to tell Whittaker. I think I scared him half to death. Can't have anyone stopping me tomorrow.\n\n\nBrooke called to check up on me. I don't know how convincing I was. She always seems to know when I'm bullshitting.\n\n\nOne more day. One last night. Then it's just me and that storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanderson!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're, uh\u2026 how are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFine, I guess. Been worse. You?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, you know, alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I wanted to ask, what, uh\u2026 you got any plans for this evening?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, probably the storm shelter, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, well yeah, but I meant\u2026 after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess just sleep, mostly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight, of course. Well, I was wondering\u2026 and you don't have to say yes, of course, I totally understand-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian, what is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you want to go on a date?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to say no! Don't feel obligated to-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mather, I appreciate the interest, but I\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, of course! Sorry for asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not you, Adrian. I, uh\u2026 it's complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight! Sorry. Should've guessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, it's alright. Just, nothing against you. Maybe some other time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 6\n\n\nAdrian. He asked me out.\n\n\nI didn't know what to say. That was the FURTHEST thing from my mind.\n\n\nI said no. Did I mean no?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, of course I meant no. No time for any distractions. I have to focus on the task at hand.\n\n\nThe storm hits us around 9 PM. Three hours from now. Guess I'd better start preparing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALERT\n\n\nA SEVERE WEATHER WARNING IS IN PLACE\n\n\nALL STAFF MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO SHELTER A IMMEDIATELY\n\n\nTHIS MESSAGE REPEATS\n\n\n \n\n\nALERT\n\n\nA SEVERE WEATHER WARNING IS IN PLACE\n\n\nALL STAFF MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO SHELTER A IMMEDIATELY\n\n\nTHIS MESSAGE REPEATS\n\n\n \n\n\nALERT\n\n\nA SEVERE WEATHER WARNING IS IN PLACE\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere's Sanderson?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's not- oh.

Just fucking DO IT ALREADY!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger! What the hell are you doing? Get inside!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it's me! Come on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. I have to learn what it wants! How it works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat, the fucking lightning? You can watch it from the shelter-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt strikes people, Adrian. And if they live, it strikes them again. And again. Until there's nothing left to strike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what are YOU doing out here then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I can get struck and live, I can- I can figure out its MO. And I can figure out a way to stop it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger, we have D-Class! You don't-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey don't have the knowledge I have. They'd be toast. Not like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what's stopping you from dying right here, right now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight. So-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter. Either way, what's done is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI- Roger, what's gotten into you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo inside, Adrian. I'm finishing this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! Are you fucking crazy? I'm not leaving you here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not letting anyone else get wrapped up in all this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not moving an INCH until you're safe and sound in Shelter A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian, I'm warning you-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger, listen to me. I don't know what's wrong with you, but whatever it is, this isn't gonna fix it. You're risking everything, just to, what, to stop people from getting struck by lightning? I mean, listen to yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut getting struck AGAIN and AGAIN! That's not unlucky. That can't JUST be luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not?!?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause then they all died in vain. Walter Summerford, Roy Sullivan-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople die from bad luck all the time, what the fuck's the difference?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUs, Adrian! We can stop it! We have the means! The resources! We can prevent shit like this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not our place! We don't get to just call something an anomaly cause we don't like it! That's not how any of this is supposed to work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger, please, come inside. It's fucking freezing out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 7\n\n\nI've got a cold.

SCP-7166 was hypothesized using circumstantial evidence, including records regarding Walter Summerford, Roy Sullivan, and Jason Sanderson. SCP-7166 was eventually determined to be unquantifiable, and the probability for lightning strike survivors to be struck again was determined not to have exceeded projected numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 21\n\n\nFlew into Anchorage yesterday for Christmas.
