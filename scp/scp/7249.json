Any information that may reveal the existence of SCP-7249's anomalous properties to non-Foundation scientists or the general public must be immediately destroyed\n1\n. Scientists or any other individual that discovers SCP-7249's anomalous properties must be amnesticized as quickly as possible. Mass amnesticization of civilians for the purposes of concealing SCP-7249 has been authorized by the O5 council to preserve the Veil of Secrecy.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7249 is the collective designation of four species of extremely massive organisms inhabiting the Milky Way galaxy. Each species differs greatly from the others, but have been grouped together under this designation due to some similarities between each of them.\n\n\nSCP-7249-A is the smallest species, with their mean diameter ranging from 1.2 miles (2km) across to 2,159 miles (3,475km) across. Instances of SCP-7249-A are generally spheroids, although many other shapes of these organisms have been observed. Each instance has a shell made of varying materials that can be anywhere from 1,266ft (385.9m) to 133,970ft (40,834.1m) thick, depending on the size of the organism itself. SCP-7249-A instances receive sustenance by absorbing light and heat from nearby stars through their shell. Instances communicate with each other and with other species of SCP-7249 via electromagnetic waves, which Foundation scientists have been able to translate into audible sound with data sonification. How these organisms reproduce is currently unknown. The number of SCP-7249-A instances in the Milky Way galaxy is currently unknown, but current estimates say the number may be upwards of 3.7 billion. At least 58 celestial bodies within our solar system are instances of SCP-7249-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Instances of SCP-7249-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Number\n\n\nCommon Name\n\n\nImage\n\n\nCurrently Orbiting\n\n\nNotability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-01\n\n\nGanymede\n\n\n\n\nJupiter\n\n\nFirst known instance of SCP-7249-A / Within our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-11\n\n\nIo\n\n\n\n\nJupiter\n\n\nThickest shell of any SCP-7249-A instance / Within our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-29\n\n\nMimas\n\n\n\n\nSaturn\n\n\nLargest deformation of any SCP-7249-A instance / Within our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-44\n\n\nDeimos\n\n\n\n\nMars\n\n\nUnique shape / Within our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-58\n\n\nMoon\n\n\n\n\nEarth\n\n\nOrbiting Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B is the second smallest species, ranging from 3,031.9 miles (4,879.4km) to 217,202.5 miles (349,553.5km) in diameter. These organisms are all nearly spherical in shape and have a shell that can be anywhere from 692 miles (1,113.7km) to 39,882 miles (64,183.9km) thick and made from a vast array of minerals. Like SCP-7249-A, SCP-7249-B instances receive sustenance from light and heat absorbed from stars through the shell and communicate using electromagnetic waves. The number of SCP-7249-B instances in the Milky Way is estimated to be around 1.7 billion, one of which resides in our solar system.\n\n\nSCP-7249-B instances reproduce asexually. As an instance grows, it will slowly begin to produce eggs. Eggs produced this way are pushed outward into the upper layers of the shell. Once an asteroid collides with the instance, any eggs exposed during the collision will be forcefully ejected from the shell unto space. These eggs travel for several centuries before hatching into a new instance of SCP-7249-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Instances of SCP-7249-B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Number\n\n\nCommon Name(s)\n\n\nImage / Artist's Impression\n\n\nCurrently Orbiting\n\n\nNotability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B-01\n\n\n51 Pegasi b, \"Dimidium\"\n\n\n\n\n51 Pegasi\n\n\nFirst known instance of SCP-7249-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B-32\n\n\nPSR B1620-26\u00a0b, \"Methuselah\"\n\n\n\n\nPSR B1620-26 AB\n\n\nOldest known instance of SCP-7249-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B-79\n\n\nKepler 452b\n\n\n\n\nKepler 452\n\n\nAppears to be attempting to camouflage itself as Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B-155\n\n\nHAT-P-7b\n\n\n\n\nHAT-P-7\n\n\nVery close proximity to nearest star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-B-394\n\n\nMercury\n\n\n\n\nSol (The Sun)\n\n\nWithin our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next largest species is SCP-7249-C, which can be as little as 629,567,395 miles (1,013,190,509.7km) wide to 1,470,500,000 miles (2,366,540,352km) wide. Unlike the other species mentioned before, instances of SCP-7249-C do not have a shell, but rather a thick membrane that can be 83,758 miles (134795.4km) thick to 16,998,152 miles (27,355,873.9km) thick. The number of SCP-7249-C instances in the Milky Way is estimated to be well over 1 billion.\n\n\nSCP-7249-C instances have a unique method of acquiring sustenance that also functions as a self-defense mechanism. These organisms produce an extremely flammable, dense gas which is secreted through the membrane. Due to the enormous gravitational pull of the organism, the gas will be pulled towards the center of the organism but cannot pass through the membrane once secreted. The extreme density of the gas combined with the volume of said gas causes it to set itself on fire. Once ablaze, the gas provides heat and light for the instance of SCP-7249-C to absorb, making it effectively self-sustaining.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-7249-C use most of the energy absorbed through their membranes to produce transparent eggs within themselves. Once the instance has produced a certain amount of eggs, it will begin swelling up slowly before violently erupting. This eruption tears the organism apart, killing it and releasing the eggs inside of it. The gas on the surface of the instance will be dispersed, as well as much additional gas stored within the instance. Many of the eggs produced by the instance will perish, but some will begin to collect gas that was pushed outward during the explosion. If one of these eggs collects enough gas, the gas will be set ablaze and the organism will begin absorbing energy and growing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Instances of SCP-7249-C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Number\n\n\nCommon Name\n\n\nImage / Artist's Impression\n\n\nConstellation\n\n\nNotability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-C-02\n\n\nSpica\n\n\n\n\nVirgo\n\n\nBrightest within its constellation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-C-06\n\n\nAlpha Lupi\n\n\n[Redacted]\n\n\nLupus\n\n\nBrightest within its constellation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-C-29\n\n\nRigel\n\n\n\n\nOrion\n\n\nBrightest within its star system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-C-40\n\n\nIRAS 17163-3907\n\n\n\n\nScorpius\n\n\nAppears to be injured, expelling large amounts of internal gas in a ring shape around itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-C-55\n\n\nUY Scuti\n\n\n[Redacted]\n\n\nScutum\n\n\nLargest known instance of SCP-7249-C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D is the final and most unique species of SCP-7249. SCP-7249-D instances can be anywhere from 15 miles (21.4km) wide to 78 billion miles (125 billion km) wide. Instances of SCP-7249-D have no shells or membranes unlike the other species. They also do not absorb heat and sunlight for sustenance. Instead, SCP-7249-D instances spin rapidly, bending spacetime around them to pull in nearby matter, which they feed on. The rapid spinning produces a spherical black veil around the organism. Once matter passes through this veil, the SCP-7249-D instance within will quickly consume it. All attempts to retrieve matter from beyond this veil have failed. SCP-7249-D is the only species of SCP-7249 that preys on other species of SCP-7249. The number of instances of SCP-7249-D in the Milky Way is estimated to be approximately 500 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Instances of SCP-7249-D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Number\n\n\nCommon Name\n\n\nImage / Artist's Impression\n\n\nNotability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D-08\n\n\nGaia BH1\n\n\n\n\nClosest to Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D-23\n\n\nOGLE-2011-BLG-0462\n\n\n\n\nFirst isolated instance of SCP-7249-D discovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D-026\n\n\nV404 Cygni\n\n\n\n\nCurrently preying on an instance of SCP-7249-C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D-050\n\n\nGRO J1655\u221240\n\n\n\n\nGenetic mutation causes SCP-7249-D-50 to be invisible or very transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D-077\n\n\nSagittarius A*\n\n\n\n\nCenter of our galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7249-A was discovered in October, 1999. Three members of MTF Gamma-4 (\"Blondebeard's Crew\") were overseeing the construction of Ganymede Area-01, which was intended to be the Foundation's first base of operations beyond the asteroid belt before being abandoned. One member of MTF Gamma-4 noticed that the base's satellite dish was picking up electromagnetic waves from an unidentified source. The team was able to use data sonification to convert the electromagnetic waves into audio. Upon listening to the audio, all three members of MTF Gamma-4 requested to leave Ganymede Area-01 as quickly as possible. The audio file containing the sonified electromagnetic signal was lost, but the three members of MTF Gamma-4 who listened to the file described it as \"Ganymede screaming.\"\n\n\nSCP-7249-B was discovered in July, 2002. A team comprised of three members of MTF Gamma-4, five members of MTF Epsilon-13 (\"Manifest Destiny\"), and two members of MTF Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") was sent to a Foundation space station orbiting planet 51 Pegasi b in order to analyze nearby moons in search of SCP-7249-A instances. Once the team arrived, they immediately began receiving strong electromagnetic wave signals. However, after searching all moons within the 51 Pegasi star system, no instances of SCP-7249-A were found. During preparation for a return to Earth, the space station passed closely by 51 Pegasi b and the team began receiving stronger electromagnetic wave signals. A highly pressure-resistant drone was sent into 51 Pegasi b's gaseous surface to search for unusual resources. Upon nearing the core of the planet, the drone began detecting large amounts of solid material. The drone successfully returned to the station 4 hours later with several samples of the solid substance. Analysis of the substance confirmed it to be organic tissue.\n\n\nSCP-7249-C was discovered in March, 2009, when two members of MTF Gamma-4 were sent to explore the SN 2009bb supernova. During their approach, the two members crashed into an unseen, apparently spheroidal object. Using infrared cameras installed on the exterior of the vessel, the team was able to detect the object they had crashed into, which was later identified as an SCP-7249-C egg. The infrared cameras also detected at least 142 additional eggs at approximately the same distance from the supernova. Electromagnetic wave detectors on the vessel also received a pattern of signals which was later translated into audio through data sonification. The sound produced is believed to be some form of pained \"screaming\" emitted by SCP-7249-C instances during their violent reproductive processes.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-D was discovered in August, 2016. MTF Gamma-4 was stationed at a base on an instance of SCP-7249-B which was orbiting a black hole. During a drilling operation on the SCP-7249-B instance, the black hole began to spin much more rapidly than it previously was, which increased its gravitational pull significantly. MTF Gamma-4 was able to evacuate the SCP-7249-B instance before it was pulled into the black hole, which slowed down to its previous speed after fully enveloping the SCP-7249-B instance. Soon after, Foundation astrophysicists confirmed that several other black holes in the Milky Way were exercising similar behavior, as well as other anomalous behaviors such as spontaneous trajectory changes and strategic axis tilting.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Experiment Log 7249-A-1\n\n\nThis was the first and only set of experiments performed on an SCP-7249 species. Further tests were planned during the testing period, but were cancelled after Incident 7249-Alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7249-A-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-01 (\"Ganymede\")\n\n\nProcess:\n MTF Gamma-4 (\"Blondebeard's Crew\") drilled through shell in an attempt to locate organic tissue within SCP-7249-A-01.\n\n\nResult:\n MTF Gamma-4 was able to successfully reach organic matter beyond the shell of SCP-7249-A-01. However, during the descent through the shell, the team appeared to drill through a nerve-like organic structure which caused SCP-7249-A-01 to emit large amounts of electromagnetic waves. Foundation scientists used data sonification to produce the following noise from the electromagnetic waves.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249-A-01 continued producing these electromagnetic waves for over 6 hours before returning to normal. The injury caused by the drill was completely healed within 14 days.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-01 (\"Ganymede\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to communicate with SCP-7249-A-01 by sending random electromagnetic waves in its direction.\n\n\nResult:\n Foundation staff received no reply from SCP-7249-A-01.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-13 (\"Hyperion\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to communicate with SCP-7249-A-13 by sending random electromagnetic waves in its direction.\n\n\nResult:\n Foundation staff received no reply from SCP-7249-A-13.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-26 (\"Triton\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to communicate with SCP-7249-A-26 by sending random electromagnetic waves in its direction.\n\n\nResult:\n Foundation staff received no reply from SCP-7249-A-26.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-29 (\"Mimas\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to communicate with SCP-7249-A-29 by sending random electromagnetic waves in its direction.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-7249-A-29 stopped producing electromagnetic waves entirely for over 6 hours before resuming normal activity.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-29 (\"Mimas\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to draw SCP-7249-A-29's attention by landing an unmanned spacecraft on its shell.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-7249-A-29 did not react.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-29 (\"Mimas\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to draw SCP-7249-A-29's attention by drilling a hole into its shell.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-7249-A-29 did not react.\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-7249-A-29 (\"Mimas\")\n\n\nProcess:\n Foundation scientists attempted to draw SCP-7249-A-29's attention by detonating an explosive device with the force of [DATA EXPUNGED] pounds of TNT on its surface.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-7249-A-29 produced abnormally high amounts of electromagnetic waves for approximately 12 hours. Foundation scientists used data sonification to produce the following noise from the electromagnetic waves.\n\n\n\n\nAfter about 12 hours had passed, SCP-7249-A-29 stopped producing electromagnetic waves entirely. MTF Gamma-4 (\"Blondebeard's Crew\") was sent to SCP-7249-A-29 to examine the organism. Upon drilling through the shell, the team discovered that SCP-7249-A-29 was no longer displaying any signs of life whatsoever. SCP-7249-A-29 was pronounced neutralized the next day, and testing of all SCP-7249 instances was temporarily postponed. The next day, a grade 11 tsunami struck Miami, Florida which destroyed the majority of the city as well as Site-106. Foundation scientists attributed the tsunami to an unexpected change in the orbit of SCP-7249-A-58 (\"Moon\"). The following memo was sent to all Foundation personnel involved with SCP-7249 later that day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE O5 COUNCIL\n\n\nDue to recent developments concerning SCP-7249, we have come to the conclusion that experimenting with SCP-7249 is too risky to continue. All current and future tests of SCP-7249 are suspended until we have decided that it is safe enough to resume. The O5 Council feels this is necessary considering the destruction caused by SCP-7249-A-58 yesterday. While it is still unclear whether or not SCP-7249-A-58 intentionally caused the tsunami and if it is related to the death of SCP-7249-A-29 in any way, we do not want to take any more risks. We have no way to know if these species can harm us further or if they even have the capacity for revenge. Considering that one of them is orbiting our own planet and there are at least another 57 of them less than a light year away, potentially angering them is just too dangerous. We have no idea what might happen if we kill another moon, and we certainly don't want to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7248\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7249\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
