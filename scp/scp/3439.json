The envelope is to be stored in a dry, climate controlled archive room in the vault wing of Site-77\n1\n. Any personnel working with SCP-3439 are instructed not to look directly at the object, and instead view it through a live feed display while handling. It is not advised for personnel exposed to SCP-3439 to receive any class of amnestic treatment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3439 is a picture-postcard depicting a view of Oia village, on the Greek island of Santorini. The reverse side lacks any form of postmark or address, and has only the words \u201cWish. I was here\u201d(\nsic\n) hand-written in black ink. These details have been confirmed by repeat photographic and video analysis. However, individuals viewing the object in person provide inconsistent accounts, with no two subjects having described similar images or writings, even when observed simultaneously.\n\n\nAny personnel who view SCP-3439 for too long becomes unresponsive, exhibiting deficits in attention and focus. Subjects describe feelings akin to melancholy which persists even when the object is removed. If left unchecked, this condition progresses into a deep state of depression. Personnel often report a strong desire to look at SCP-3439 again, with repeat viewings only enhancing these effects.\n\n\nAddendum 3439.1: Test Logs\n\n\nForward:\n The following are examples of transcripts illustrating the anomalous properties of SCP-3439\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3439/T1 \u2013 17/07/2002\n\n\nSubject:\n D-77053\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject was instructed to look at the front of SCP-3439 and describe what they saw. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attending.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nD-77053:\n What is this?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Just say what you see clearly into the microphone.\n\n\nD-77053:\n It\u2019s a house. What more do you want?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Could you provide more detail?\n\n\nD-77053:\n It\u2019s old? On the side of a mountain\u2026 green shutters\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How many houses can you see?\n\n\nD-77053:\n Just the one.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Do any of these houses happen to look like these?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shows the subject a photograph of SCP-3439\n\n\nD-77053:\n What? No. What is that, Greece? This house is in Italy.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How do you know it\u2019s in Italy?\n\n\nD-77053:\n Just the style of it. Those green shutters, the yellowing stone wall, the red roof. It looks just like Chianni\u2026 or at least, just outside of Chianni\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What else can you see?\n\n\nD-77053:\n \u2026I know this place. My mother moved to somewhere similar with me and my brother many years ago. There used to be this swing set at the back where we played for hours\u2026 oh hey, there it is! Right on the corner, you can just make it out\u2026.\n\n\nThe Subject stares silently at SCP-3439 for a while\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Continue your description.\n\n\nD-77053:\n It is that house\u2026 The very one we\u2026 Where did you get this?\n\n\nThe Subject looks more closely at the object.\n\n\nD-77053:\n I haven\u2019t been back there since\u2026 It looks just like I left it. As though Ma\u2019 could walk right out of there\u2026 Was this taken recently?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We cannot disclose that information.\n\n\nD-77053:\n No it couldn\u2019t have been. That\u2019s her car out front. She was still driving\u2026 I never noticed how nice this house looked in the sun. It must be like just after noon. I can practically smell her cooking through that window. It smells like\u2026. like\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you, I think that will be enough.\n\n\nD-77053:\n No wait. Can I just look at it a little more?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n\nD-77053:\n No please! I haven\u2019t seen them for so long. You gotta understand.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Return to your seat.\n\n\nD-77053:\n I\u2019m only asking for a little longer! Please, I could almost see them walking round the corner! Please just give me that. Just that.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n This test has been concluded.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAnalysis:\n SCP-3439 appears capable of displaying images which hold emotional significance to the observer. Further testing is required to see if such an effect is unique to viewing the front of the object, and whether there is a pattern behind what the observer sees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3439/T2 \u2013 25/09/2002\n\n\nSubject:\n D-88835\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject was instructed to look at the reverse side of SCP-3439 and describe what they saw. A line of questioning would follow to determine the connection between the subject and the illusion. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attending.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nD-88835:\n Is this some kind of joke?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What do you see on the card?\n\n\nD-88835:\n I see writing.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please recite what you see written.\n\n\nD-88835:\n To Jean, I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but you truly have made me the happiest man in the world. Knowing you\u2019re with me until the end, I have no fear, no dread, and no pain. Please live well after me. There is no need to worry. Salvador.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Does this mean anything to you?\n\n\nD-88835:\n Really? That\u2019s what you\u2019re asking?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Answer the question.\n\n\nD-88835:\n Fuck! Yes it means something! This message is for me, you know?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Who is Salvador?\n\n\nD-88835:\n He was\u2026 my partner.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Were you together long?\n\n\nD-88835:\n We only knew each other for a year\u2026 we were married for like two days. What was it, 20 years ago?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What happened?\n\n\nD-88835:\n It\u2019s\u2026. not a fun story. He had brain tumour or something like that. The timing of it was just terrible \u2018cause he got the doctors notice five months in to our relationship\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Are there any other markings on the card?\n\n\nD-88835:\n There\u2019s a date\u2026 February 2nd, 1985\u2026 The date he\u2026. How did this?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Have you ever read a message like this before?\n\n\nD-88835:\n No, when we got married he had been in the hospital for a week. They were trying a new experimental therapy but it didn\u2019t work. I was with him till\u2026. I can\u2019t do this.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is there anything else written on the card?\n\n\nD-88835:\n No\u2026 That\u2019s it\u2026 I think I just want to\u2026. sorry.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you, we\u2019ll finish the interview here.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAnalysis:\n It would appear that both sides of SCP-3439 are capable of subjective illusion. Interestingly, while the contents of either side is subjective to the observer, the front and the reverse sides never seem to switch. As with the image, the written content also contains a deep emotional context for the observer. Further testing is required to see if both sides of the object work in tandem or apart from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a03439/T3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3439/T3 \u2013 30/02/2003\n\n\nSubject:\n D-93366\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject was instructed to look at both sides of SCP-3439 in turn. Questions were provided to encourage detail and better determine the contextual significance of the illusions. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attending.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nD-93366:\n Is this a postcard?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What can you tell me about it?\n\n\nD-93366:\n It\u2019s nice, really fancy looking. You get this from Japan?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Describe what you see.\n\n\nD-93366:\n It\u2019s a shrine, like the kind you see all over that country. It\u2019s covered in red leaves, the whole picture is actually. Reminds me of that one time in autumn.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Tell us more about that.\n\n\nD-93366:\n Well\u2026 back in better days, I worked for this company who had a branch in Kobe.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is that what you see in the picture?\n\n\nD-93366:\n No, this is Kyoto. No mistake about that\u2026 I only went there once but, you can\u2019t forget a place like that.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What happened in Kyoto?\n\n\nD-93366:\n Nothing much. It was somewhere a friend wanted me to see. She said it would be a tragedy to leave without going at least once.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Tell us more about this friend.\n\n\nD-93366:\n There\u2019s not much to tell. Her name\u2019s Yurie and I\u2019d often meet with her and her niece, Honoka. Really energetic kid, always jumping about everywhere.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How did you meet?\n\n\nD-93366:\n That was Honoka\u2019s doing. I was sitting in the park when she ran up to me and started talking, just out of nowhere. Yurie ran up and apologised for her, and then we just talked.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Did you meet with them often?\n\n\nD-93366:\n Every now and again, sure. Being in a new country is really isolating. It was nice to have someone to meet up with the odd lonely weekend. Even if it was just to walk about watching over a child at play.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Would you consider her a close friend?\n\n\nD-93366:\n I think so. I did meet the rest of the family, Yurie\u2019s sister and her sister\u2019s husband. They even invited me to a big meal somewhere. It was nice\u2026 It was just\u2026 just nice. Honoka kept calling me big brother. I kinda liked it. I\u2026 I\u2019d never been anyone\u2019s brother before.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What happened next?\n\n\nD-93366:\n Well\u2026 You know how it is. The company I was working for went bust, and my visa along with it. I had to pack up and leave before I\u2019d even been a full year. Two days before my plane, Yurie called me up and told me we were going to see Kyoto. It was just her this time. No Honoka.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is that what you see on the postcard?\n\n\nD-93366:\n Actually\u2026 Yes. It looked just like this when we got there. Red leaves everywhere. Even looking at this picture\u2026 it\u2019s like it\u2019s right in front of me. Vibrant. But also kinda\u2026 sombre? Like something\u2019s slipping away\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Did you ever return?\n\n\nD-93366:\n Couldn\u2019t afford it. Once I got back work was impossible to find. Things got bad, one thing led to another and, well you probably have this all on file somewhere.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Could you turn the postcard over and state what you see?\n\n\nD-93366:\n \u2026what is this?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What do you see?\n\n\nD-93366:\n It\u2019s written in Japanese\u2026 really big characters all down the side.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Can you read them?\n\n\nD-93366:\n I\u2026 yeah. First part's a date. 1995, January, 19th. About two months after I left.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What else can you read?\n\n\nD-93366:\n It says\u2026 Dear big brother. Thank you for giving us happy memories. We are fine, but big sister is often sad even when she smiles. Looking forward to when you play with us again. \u2026Please\u2026.don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t forget about us.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is that everything?\n\n\nSubject does not respond.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Answer the question.\n\n\nD-93366:\n Oh\u2026 what?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Can you see anything else? Or is that everything?\n\n\nD-93366:\n No. that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s it.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Very good, please return the object.\n\n\nD-93366:\n Actually\u2026 do you mind if I keep hold of this?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We cannot allow that.\n\n\nD-93366:\n But\u2026 never mind.\n\n\nSubject returns the object.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAnalysis:\n This data confirms that both sides of SCP-3439 contribute towards a particular life event or memory that is specific to the observer. One pattern that emerges is that the front displays a sentimental location, while the reverse side shows a message from someone connected to this location. The memories associated trend towards being bittersweet in nature. Further analysis is required. It may also be of interest to note that the date provided by D-93366 takes places a few days following the Great Hanshin Earthquake. The significance of this has yet to be understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3439.2: Follow-up Studies\n\n\nSince the initial testing, all civil documents pertaining to the D-class subjects involved have been reviewed and verified. All accounts support the information provided during the tests. This leads us to conclude that these memories were not in any way synthetic.\n\n\nSubjects D-77053, D-88835, and D-93366 have had noticeable changes in behaviour following the tests, acting more withdrawn, distant, and generally less responsive. The decision was made not to terminate these subjects in order to evaluate potential recovery methods. Individual reports are detailed below:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-77053\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-77053\n\n\n\n\nSubject D-77053 requested to view SCP-3439 at any moment they were brought before a researcher. On the 8th May 2003, Subject D-77053 was finally granted this request on the condition that they were recorded speaking aloud what they saw on the reverse side. What follows is a transcript of this recording:\n\n\n\n\n15th June 2000\n\n\nLook after your brother. When I'm gone you're all he'll have left, and while I know you'll be ok, I am so worried for him.\n\n\nMy time is short, I can feel it slipping away. Please, my children, keep each other strong. Look after one another.\n\n\nI love you both\u2026so much.\n\n\n\n\nWhen questioned, the subject only had the following to say:\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry Ma'\u2026 You were right\u2026 You know I used to hate it in there, always felt trapped\u2026 look at me now eh? Certainly escaped to better things didn\u2019t I\u2026\n\n\nI use to hate how cut off it was, how cold it got, how dark night was\u2026 But looking at this\u2026 All I can see is\u2026.warmth. That moment\u2026.that one moment. When everything was just\u2026 It feels so close now. Can I have a second? Just for this?\n\n\n\n\nOver the weeks that followed this session, the condition of subject D-77053 did not improve. Subsequent viewings were permitted, and even encouraged by active researchers. These repeat viewings did little to quell the subject's symptoms, and in fact triggered further depressive episodes. This all culminated on 15th June 2005 when [DATA EXPUNGED]\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-88835\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-88835\n\n\n\n\nDuring routine psychological assessment, Subject D-88835 made the following statement in response to the question. \u201cHow have you been feeling lately?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about him\u2026 I\u2019ve tried, but he\u2019s always there, like some kind of ghost, following me about. I thought I was over this. I thought I got better\u2026 But now it\u2019s happening all over again. There was going to be a vineyard in Spain, somewhere people wouldn\u2019t bother us. Now I can\u2019t look at a fucking grape without\u2026 But it was never this bad before!\n\n\n\n\nSubject D-88835 was treated with class D amnestics shortly thereafter, several weeks post exposure to SCP-3439. While the subject lost all memory of the object, and that any interview had been conducted, they instead reported a strange but overwhelming sense of loss and longing with no clear reason as to why.\n\n\nSubject D-88835 provided the following written statement during a psychiatric evaluation:\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s something missing. Like a hole in the back of my neck. I want to scream sometimes but I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s like I live in a shadow now, and I want it to stop, I try to make it stop, I try so fucking hard all the time. I don\u2019t feel like me. Something\u2019s broken. It\u2019s driving me crazy. Why won\u2019t anyone say what\u2019s wrong with me?\n\n\n\n\nIn the weeks that followed, subject D-88835 became prone to violent episodes which increased in intensity and frequency over time. The subject is currently contained in a standard cell within the containment wing of Site-77 pending further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-93366\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Subject\u00a0D-93366\n\n\n\n\nSubject D-93366 was offered counselling by onsite therapists following on from the initial exposure. The subject has since been diagnosed with clinical depression. Notably, unlike other subjects, their symptoms have yet to progress to anything more severe. As such, the subject is cleared to abide by all standard D-class protocol. What follows is a log of one of their psychiatric sessions.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ris:\n What\u2019s been on your mind lately?\n\n\nD-93366:\n I don\u2019t really know anymore. I can\u2019t get that card out of my head. It\u2019s silly, I haven\u2019t thought about this for years but now it\u2019s like that\u2019s all there is.\n\n\nDr. Ris:\n If you had the chance, would you try to make contact?\n\n\nD-93366:\n It\u2019s been almost 10 years. Do you think they\u2019d even remember? Look at me. Do you think anyone\u2019s going to want to deal with me now? I know what you guys call us. Disposable\u2026 Throw them in with the death traps and see what happens, don\u2019t worry, no one will miss them\u2026.\n\n\nDr. Ris:\n You are providing a vital service to all of humanity.\n\n\nD-93366:\n Those red leaves\u2026 That\u2019s the one thing I can't get out of my head. That day was so chilly. Told me she liked it better in Spring, when it got warm. I made a promise to her! I made a goddamn promise and now it's\u2026 everything\u2019s just\u2026 too late. Whatever life that could have been\u2026 It\u2019s too late.\n\n\nDr. Ris:\n Is there anything you can think of that might make it easier for you?\n\n\nD-93366:\n \u2026Let me read my card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

What more do you want? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Could you provide more detail? D-77053: It\u2019s old? On the side of a mountain\u2026 green shutters\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: How many houses can you see? D-77053: Just the one. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Do any of these houses happen to look like these? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shows the subject a photograph of SCP-3439 D-77053: What? No. What is that, Greece? This house is in Italy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: How do you know it\u2019s in Italy? D-77053: Just the style of it. Those green shutters, the yellowing stone wall, the red roof. It looks just like Chianni\u2026 or at least, just outside of Chianni\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What else can you see? D-77053: \u2026I know this place. My mother moved to somewhere similar with me and my brother many years ago. There used to be this swing set at the back where we played for hours\u2026 oh hey, there it is! Right on the corner, you can just make it out\u2026. The Subject stares silently at SCP-3439 for a while Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Continue your description. D-77053: It is that house\u2026 The very one we\u2026 Where did you get this? The Subject looks more closely at the object. D-77053: I haven\u2019t been back there since\u2026 It looks just like I left it. As though Ma\u2019 could walk right out of there\u2026 Was this taken recently? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We cannot disclose that information. D-77053: No it couldn\u2019t have been. That\u2019s her car out front. She was still driving\u2026 I never noticed how nice this house looked in the sun. It must be like just after noon. I can practically smell her cooking through that window. It smells like\u2026. like\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you, I think that will be enough. D-77053: No wait. Can I just look at it a little more? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That won\u2019t be necessary. D-77053: No please! I haven\u2019t seen them for so long. You gotta understand. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Return to your seat. D-77053: I\u2019m only asking for a little longer! Please, I could almost see them walking round the corner! Please just give me that. Just that. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: This test has been concluded. <End Log> Analysis: SCP-3439 appears capable of displaying images which hold emotional significance to the observer. Further testing is required to see if such an effect is unique to viewing the front of the object, and whether there is a pattern behind what the observer sees.",
        "Test 3439/T2 \u2013 25/09/2002 Subject: D-88835 Procedure: Subject was instructed to look at the reverse side of SCP-3439 and describe what they saw. A line of questioning would follow to determine the connection between the subject and the illusion. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attending. <Begin Log> D-88835: Is this some kind of joke? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What do you see on the card? D-88835: I see writing. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Please recite what you see written. D-88835: To Jean, I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but you truly have made me the happiest man in the world. Knowing you\u2019re with me until the end, I have no fear, no dread, and no pain. Please live well after me. There is no need to worry. Salvador. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Does this mean anything to you? D-88835: Really? That\u2019s what you\u2019re asking? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Answer the question. D-88835: Fuck! Yes it means something! This message is for me, you know? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Who is Salvador? D-88835: He was\u2026 my partner. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Were you together long? D-88835: We only knew each other for a year\u2026 we were married for like two days. What was it, 20 years ago? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened? D-88835: It\u2019s\u2026. not a fun story. He had brain tumour or something like that. The timing of it was just terrible \u2018cause he got the doctors notice five months in to our relationship\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are there any other markings on the card? D-88835: There\u2019s a date\u2026 February 2nd, 1985\u2026 The date he\u2026. How did this? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Have you ever read a message like this before? D-88835: No, when we got married he had been in the hospital for a week. They were trying a new experimental therapy but it didn\u2019t work. I was with him till\u2026. I can\u2019t do this. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is there anything else written on the card? D-88835: No\u2026 That\u2019s it\u2026 I think I just want to\u2026. sorry. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you, we\u2019ll finish the interview here. <End Log> Analysis: It would appear that both sides of SCP-3439 are capable of subjective illusion. Interestingly, while the contents of either side is subjective to the observer, the front and the reverse sides never seem to switch. As with the image, the written content also contains a deep emotional context for the observer. Further testing is required to see if both sides of the object work in tandem or apart from one another.",
        "Test 3439/T3 \u2013 30/02/2003 Subject: D-93366 Procedure: Subject was instructed to look at both sides of SCP-3439 in turn. Questions were provided to encourage detail and better determine the contextual significance of the illusions. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attending. <Begin Log> D-93366: Is this a postcard? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What can you tell me about it? D-93366: It\u2019s nice, really fancy looking. You get this from Japan? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Describe what you see. D-93366: It\u2019s a shrine, like the kind you see all over that country. It\u2019s covered in red leaves, the whole picture is actually. Reminds me of that one time in autumn. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Tell us more about that. D-93366: Well\u2026 back in better days, I worked for this company who had a branch in Kobe. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is that what you see in the picture? D-93366: No, this is Kyoto. No mistake about that\u2026 I only went there once but, you can\u2019t forget a place like that. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened in Kyoto? D-93366: Nothing much. It was somewhere a friend wanted me to see. She said it would be a tragedy to leave without going at least once. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Tell us more about this friend. D-93366: There\u2019s not much to tell. Her name\u2019s Yurie and I\u2019d often meet with her and her niece, Honoka. Really energetic kid, always jumping about everywhere. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: How did you meet? D-93366: That was Honoka\u2019s doing. I was sitting in the park when she ran up to me and started talking, just out of nowhere. Yurie ran up and apologised for her, and then we just talked. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Did you meet with them often? D-93366: Every now and again, sure. Being in a new country is really isolating. It was nice to have someone to meet up with the odd lonely weekend. Even if it was just to walk about watching over a child at play. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Would you consider her a close friend? D-93366: I think so. I did meet the rest of the family, Yurie\u2019s sister and her sister\u2019s husband. They even invited me to a big meal somewhere. It was nice\u2026 It was just\u2026 just nice. Honoka kept calling me big brother. I kinda liked it. I\u2026 I\u2019d never been anyone\u2019s brother before. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened next? D-93366: Well\u2026 You know how it is. The company I was working for went bust, and my visa along with it. I had to pack up and leave before I\u2019d even been a full year. Two days before my plane, Yurie called me up and told me we were going to see Kyoto. It was just her this time. No Honoka. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is that what you see on the postcard? D-93366: Actually\u2026 Yes. It looked just like this when we got there. Red leaves everywhere. Even looking at this picture\u2026 it\u2019s like it\u2019s right in front of me. Vibrant. But also kinda\u2026 sombre? Like something\u2019s slipping away\u2026 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Did you ever return? D-93366: Couldn\u2019t afford it. Once I got back work was impossible to find. Things got bad, one thing led to another and, well you probably have this all on file somewhere. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Could you turn the postcard over and state what you see? D-93366: \u2026what is this? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What do you see? D-93366: It\u2019s written in Japanese\u2026 really big characters all down the side. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you read them? D-93366: I\u2026 yeah. First part's a date. 1995, January, 19th. About two months after I left. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What else can you read? D-93366: It says\u2026 Dear big brother. Thank you for giving us happy memories. We are fine, but big sister is often sad even when she smiles. Looking forward to when you play with us again. \u2026Please\u2026.don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t forget about us. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is that everything? Subject does not respond. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Answer the question. D-93366: Oh\u2026 what? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you see anything else? Or is that everything? D-93366: No. that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s it. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Very good, please return the object. D-93366: Actually\u2026 do you mind if I keep hold of this? Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We cannot allow that. D-93366: But\u2026 never mind. Subject returns the object. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you for your cooperation. <End Log> Analysis: This data confirms that both sides of SCP-3439 contribute towards a particular life event or memory that is specific to the observer. One pattern that emerges is that the front displays a sentimental location, while the reverse side shows a message from someone connected to this location. The memories associated trend towards being bittersweet in nature. Further analysis is required. It may also be of interest to note that the date provided by D-93366 takes places a few days following the Great Hanshin Earthquake. The significance of this has yet to be understood.",
        "15th June 2000 Look after your brother. When I'm gone you're all he'll have left, and while I know you'll be ok, I am so worried for him. My time is short, I can feel it slipping away. Please, my children, keep each other strong. Look after one another. I love you both\u2026so much.",

I thought I got better\u2026 But now it\u2019s happening all over again. There was going to be a vineyard in Spain, somewhere people wouldn\u2019t bother us. Now I can\u2019t look at a fucking grape without\u2026 But it was never this bad before!",
        "There\u2019s something missing. Like a hole in the back of my neck. I want to scream sometimes but I don\u2019t know why.

D-93366: It\u2019s been almost 10 years. Do you think they\u2019d even remember? Look at me. Do you think anyone\u2019s going to want to deal with me now? I know what you guys call us. Disposable\u2026 Throw them in with the death traps and see what happens, don\u2019t worry, no one will miss them\u2026. Dr. Ris: You are providing a vital service to all of humanity. D-93366: Those red leaves\u2026 That\u2019s the one thing I can't get out of my head. That day was so chilly. Told me she liked it better in Spring, when it got warm. I made a promise to her! I made a goddamn promise and now it's\u2026 everything\u2019s just\u2026 too late. Whatever life that could have been\u2026 It\u2019s too late.
