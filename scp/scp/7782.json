The method by which it speaks is unknown.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On February 14th 2023, SCP-7782 spontaneously manifested on Doctor Yellowstone's desk alongside a valentines day card with the text \"You are the apple of my eye!\" The following interaction was recorded by security cameras in Doctor Yellowstone's office.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n Hey there, doc. Some might bake you into an apple pie, but I'd bake you into a cutie pie.\n\n\nDoctor Yellowstone:\n Oh, hello. Thank you, I guess. How did you get in here?\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n I fell from the tree right into your basket\n1\n. Speaking of which, if I saw you on a tree, I'd climb to the top just to pick you.\n\n\nDoctor Yellowstone:\n I'm flattered, but no thank you. Have you heard of the Smith-Malus anomalous scientific law? It states that \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away.\"\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n Dang. Well, it was nice to meet you anyways!\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n As of July 17th 2023, SCP-7782 has made romantic advances towards fifty-three Foundation Personnel, twenty-two sapient SCP objects, and one picture of a potted plant. None of these individuals have reciprocated SCP-7782's advances, and it has not made advances towards individuals who have declined previously. Researcher Wadsworth offered to introduce it to one of the Foundation's artificial intelligences. However, SCP-7782 declined, as the artificial intelligences do not run on Apple-branded computers.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n To test how SCP-7782 interacts with mundane objects, a non-anomalous \nred delicious\n apple was placed in its containment locker. The following was recorded after.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n Hey, Wadsworth. Who's that?\n\n\nResearcher Wadsworth:\n That's an apple\n2\n.\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I'm gonna go talk to her.\n\n\nSCP-7782 rolls closer to the apple.\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n Uh, hi. I'm Johnny.\n\n\nThe apple is silent.\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n I, um, just wanted to say I think you're beautiful.\n\n\nThe apple remains silent.\n\n\nSCP-7782:\n Do you want to get to know each other?\n\n\nThe apple continues being silent.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mundane apple remained in SCP-7782's containment locker at its request, and it continued to talk to the mundane apple despite the fact that the mundane apple has yet to verbally respond.\n\nAddendum 3:\n Two engagement rings were found embedded in SCP-7782 and the mundane apple a year following Addendum 2. Nine months after the previous event, an apple seed with a tiny pacifier was found in SCP-7782's containment locker.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. There are no trees nor baskets in Doctor Yellowstone's office.\n\n\n2\n. SCP-7782 has not seen any other apples since its original manifestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7781\n | SCP-7782 | \nSCP-7783\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7782\n\" by ParallelPotatoes, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
