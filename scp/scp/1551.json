Integrating agents are to move into 12 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Street, a purchased house, in order to maintain constant surveillance of SCP-1551. Any civilian coming within 30 meters of SCP-1551 are to be questioned and, if not found to be an instance of SCP-1551-X, given a Class-C amnestic and released. New instances of SCP-1551-X are to be interviewed for confirmation of having gone through the events associated with SCP-1551 before being allowed into SCP-1551. At this time, precautions against a resident of SCP-1551 leaving the containment area are not necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1551 is a house located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Argentina. SCP-1551 is associated with a repetitive sequence of events that target humans, causing them to eventually be forced by circumstance to live in SCP-1551. These humans are individually assigned a number, so that the first known human under SCP-1551 would be referred to as SCP-1551-01, the second human SCP-1551-02, the third as SCP-1551-03 and so on. When the previous human living in SCP-1551 dies, the sequence of events associated with SCP-1551 repeats. According to reports dating as far back as 19\u2588\u2588, the events have repeated themselves 23 times, with the current individual being SCP-1551-23. Almost all iterations have begun with the previous individual's suicide, with the only exception being an accident from falling off the roof of SCP-1551 during repairs.\n\n\nThe exact mechanism of these events are currently unknown, with multiple theories being discussed. See Document 1551-01T for more information.\n A tentative theory of the events associated with SCP-1551 have been established; see Addendum 1551-T for more detail.\n\n\nSCP-1551 appears as a house in an extremely dilapidated state. \nThe building itself is not known to exhibit anomalous properties apart from those attributed to the events.\n Research is ongoing; see Interview log 1551-23-02 for more detail. SCP-1551 contains a kitchen, a living room, three bedrooms, and two bathrooms. The house has no functioning plumbing, heating or electricity. The house itself has only basic furnishings, with the current SCP-1551-23 living primarily in the kitchen. SCP-1551-23 is a male of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, approximately 43 years of age. Subject spends all his time attempting to repair SCP-1551; this task is impossible for a single person. The only time he is seen outside of SCP-1551 is to tend to the backyard garden, the only area of the property not in a state of gross disrepair. SCP-1551-23 is fully cooperative towards any Foundation personnel and has lived on the property for \u2588 years, the longest of any human that has lived in SCP-1551 since coming into Foundation custody (the average being 3 months).\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0SCP-1551-T\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\nThrough multiple interviews with humans who have lived in SCP-1551 and the collaborative efforts of Dr. \u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a tentative theory has been established of the sequence of the events associated with SCP-1551. This sequence is theorized to accommodate minor variations in circumstance and temperament of each instance. This theory states that the purpose of the events is to force a human into a position where occupying SCP-1551 and attempting to repair it unaided is the only option. The sequence comprises two parts. Initially, events place the subject in a situation of relative prosperity; subsequently, this prosperity is taken away. The general process of the events associated with SCP-1551 are as follows.\n\n\nThe first part of the events typically involves moving the targeted human instance to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, usually through an offer of work. At this point, if the targeted human was close with their family, they have a misunderstanding which causes them to no longer be on speaking terms. The instance eventually meets and marries a resident of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. If the couple is fertile, they will have a child before part 2 begins.\n\n\nThe second part of the sequence begins with the spouse of the targeted human leaving them. The spouse typically takes most of their wealth. Either shortly before or shortly after, the subject will lose their job and become unable to maintain their current standard of living. At this point they are informed of SCP-1551, which, if repaired, could be bought cheaply and resold for an extremely high price. The targeted human purchases the property over the option of homelessness. If they have any money left, their remaining savings will go towards hiring construction crews which invariably fail for a wide variety of reasons such as fraud, freak accidents, and sudden bankruptcy of the construction company. Once remaining funds are exhausted, they will move into SCP-1551 themselves and attempt to repair it alone. At this point the sequence is considered complete until the death of the instance, initiating another iteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0log\u00a01551-23-01(Translated\u00a0from\u00a0Spanish)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interview was to confirm SCP-1551-23's experiencing of the events associated with SCP-1551.\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1551-23\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nSCP-1551-23:\n It's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
