Should it activate before being properly secured, Mobile Task Force Alpha-21 (\"DDT Did Nothing Wrong\") is to be sent in to subdue and capture the instance. Class-A amnestics are to be administered to all witnesses.\n\n\nSCP-3428 instances in custody are to be submerged in soil unless needed for experimentation. Testing involving SCP-3428 requires approval from SCP-3428's Head Researcher (currently Jared \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588), and must be submitted 6 days in advance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3428 are crude statues of hummingbirds with wingspans no larger than 5 meters. \"\nCtM\n\" is engraved upon the underside of each instance. Individual instances differ slightly in make with one another, although most instances are composed of scrap metal and polyester fabric. SCP-3428 are typically found around .5 to 1.5\u00a0m underground, either in archaeological dig sites or urban construction areas. While buried underneath at least .5\u00a0m of soil, SCP-3428 remains inert.\n\n\nApproximately 5 to 10 days after being unearthed, SCP-3428 will spontaneously animate. Behavior varies between instances, although most have shown destructive tendencies upon animating. Instances of SCP-3428 will generally only cause damage if the act of doing so is clearly visible. It is rare for instances of SCP-3428 to outright attack humans.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-3428's crude physiology renders them unable to feed, instances have been observed attempting to scavenge for food and drink, much of which lies outside the typical trochilidae diet.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-3428 instances of note are listed here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nAnimation Date\n\n\nArea\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-1\n\n\n13/3/1983\n\n\nDijon, France\n\n\nInstance was uncovered during scheduled maintenance of a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 factory. By the time agents arrived, SCP-3428-1 had nearly leveled the structure.\n\n\nThis was the first SCP-3428 occurrence. SCP-3428-1 was severely damaged during capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-5\n\n\n19/2/1985\n\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\n\nSCP-3428-5 was found harassing alligators outside of a sugar plantation, and sustained serious damage before being secured.\n\n\nSCP-3428-5 appeared to be wearing a Mardi Gras mask and beads. Investigation into the possibility of a deliberate unearthing is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-16\n\n\n13/11/1990\n\n\nBurbank, California\n\n\nUpon waking, SCP-3428-16 headed towards [REDACTED] Studios before becoming distracted by a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Co delivery truck.\n\n\nAttached to SCP-3428-16 was a loudspeaker. As soon as SCP-3428-16 animated, the loudspeaker began playing \nNight on Bald Mountain\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-46\n\n\n12/8/2005\n\n\nSite 56\n\n\nSCP-3428-46 dug itself out of the ground and proceeded towards Site 56's front entrance. Its attempts to force itself through ended when the automatic security system decapitated it.\n\n\nSCP-3428-46 is the first instance to unearth itself without observed human assistance. In addition, SCP-3428-46's insides housed a nest of wasps, which proceeded to fly out after SCP-3428-46's destruction and unsuccessfully attack a soft drink vending machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-49\n\n\n12/5/2007\n\n\nSite \u2588\u2588\n\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\nCross-testing between SCP-3428 and other avian SCP objects is strictly prohibited from this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3428-59\n\n\n23/6/2013\n\n\nJackson, Ohio\n\n\nAfter waking, SCP-3428-59 knocked over several power lines before attempting to destroy a soft drink vending machine. However, upon contact, SCP-3428-59 immediately stopped and fell apart.\n\n\nAfter SCP-3428-59's destruction, witnesses reported an unidentified male voice saying \"Feel the buzz. Chill out with a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\". An investigation of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Co is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
