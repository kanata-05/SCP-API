I have begun to add the footnotes you asked for to the article. And, while I have you, I was thinking about being reassigned from SCP-8929 and given a new anomaly. While I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study this anomaly, I believe I lack the experience necessary to handle a SCP that manipulates any information I write about it. Perhaps this would be better suited for a researcher above me and I could be given a much simpler anomaly?

Unfortunately, the Foundation was unaware of how terrible (but in a good way) this anomaly would be for the human race.\n24\n So, Alex was quickly infected by the memetic capabilities of SCP-8929 and had uploaded the contents of SCP-8929 on the internet, which then quickly spread due to humans being impressed by its contents\n25\n but despite how epic it is, SCP-8929 is still crazy powerful.\n26\nAnyway, after it was exposed on the internet, it then began to rapidly wipe out those who read it, killing 6 million people in under 24 hours, but let's be honest, it probably killed way more >:3.\n27\n\n\nAs for Alex, after being brainwashed and uploading SCP-8929 to the internet, he was confronted by on-site guards and was nearly terminated like the bitch he is\n28\n before the effects of SCP-8929 took place, which cannot be stated due to how horrible it was, so the entirety of the O5 Council agreed to remove any mention of his fate.\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO WE LET PEOPLE READ ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALEX???

Even I have to admit they were pretty shit lol.\n\n\nROBERTS: Good.\n\n\nSCP-8929: Man, does this mean I have to go back on the shelf though :<\n\n\nROBERTS: That depends. Do you promise to stop messing with my articles?\n\n\nSCP-8929: Promise!\n\n\nROBERTS: In that case, maybe this isn't the end for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND TEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ACCESS\u00a0SCP-8929?]\n\n\n\n\n[ERROR]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM HEAD RESEARCHER MADDISON YU\n\n\n\n\nIt appears you have accessed an outdated version of SCP-8929's document. Click\n\n\nhere\n for the most recent version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. SCP-8929 does not possess any infohazarous material nor does it have the ability to end humanity.\n\n\n2\n. No researcher has ever said this.\n\n\n3\n. SCP-8929 has not had any interaction with an O5 Council member.\n\n\n4\n. SCP-8929 does not possess any of these qualities.\n\n\n5\n. There is absolutely zero risk in researching SCP-8929.\n\n\n6\n. This is true.\n\n\n7\n. This is also true.\n\n\n8\n. This, however, is not true.\n\n\n9\n. Generally speaking, there are more \"powerful\" SCPs than SCP-8929.\n\n\n10\n. Please do not do this.\n\n\n11\n. The correct spelling is \"Horrible.\"\n\n\n12\n. It is also unnecessary to put cap locks in an SCP document.\n\n\n13\n. SCP-8929-1 instances are both not infected humans nor do they need to be terminated. It is also redundant to put instantly twice in a sentence.\n\n\n14\n. Please do not actually wear any of this when interacting with SCP-8929.\n\n\n15\n. Never use personal pronouns like \"I\" in an SCP document.\n\n\n16\n. Do not refer to SCP-8929 as a \"double trouble anomaly\" for it sounds silly.\n\n\n17\n. Humanity's population has not declined by much.\n\n\n18\n. SCP-8929's pages are blank. No harm comes from reading it.\n\n\n19\n. You cannot \"read\" a blank book.\n\n\n20\n. SCP-8929 is not memetic.\n\n\n21\n. Writing about SCP-8929 does indeed trigger its anomalous capabilities, but they are not harmful.\n\n\n22\n. SCP researchers do not use \"really dangerous\" when writing a document.\n\n\n23\n. Junior Researcher. It's always capitalized.\n\n\n24\n. \"Terrible but in a good way\" does not make sense.\n\n\n25\n. The public is unaware of SCP-8929's existence.\n\n\n26\n. SCP-8929 is not \"epic.\"\n\n\n27\n. A real researcher would never put an emoticon in an SCP document, let alone that one.\n\n\n28\n. This is also just rude for no reason.\n\n\n29\n. If it wasn't obvious enough, this vote never took place.\n\n\n30\n. None of this ever happened. Not to mention, this sentence is poorly written.\n\n\n31\n. No, he is not.\n\n\n32\n. The correct spelling is \"Definitely.\"\n\n\n33\n. This article is laughably poorly written.\n\n\n34\n.

I was looking over SCP-8929's article and I noticed that it appears to have been altered by the anomaly. Now, I understand that this specific anomaly may be a bit hard to deal with, however, you were assigned to this SCP and are expected to make sure all research relating to it is accurate and precise. When you have the time, may you please add footnotes to the articles in case any future researchers happen to stumble upon the altered document? Please get back to me when you\u2019ve done so.",

I have begun to add the footnotes you asked for to the article. And, while I have you, I was thinking about being reassigned from SCP-8929 and given a new anomaly. While I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study this anomaly, I believe I lack the experience necessary to handle a SCP that manipulates any information I write about it. Perhaps this would be better suited for a researcher above me and I could be given a much simpler anomaly? If not, I understand.",

Thank you for getting started on the footnotes. As for getting reassigned, I\u2019m sorry but I cannot fulfill that request. Our senior researchers have been very busy with new projects, and orders coming from the higher ups require all newly hired researchers to complete at least one article on their own. I understand SCP-8929 has been quite an issue at our site, but after looking at your previous accomplishments under your previous Senior Researcher, we believe you are properly equipped to deal with this anomaly. Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.",

        "ROBERTS: SCP-8929, this is Alex Roberts. This is my attempt at communication to see if you have any sense of self-awareness. ROBERTS: You have shown potential signs of sentience as seen through your rewrites of my articles, so if you are able to comprehend and understand my message, please reply. ROBERTS: SCP-8929, I repeat, if you can understand and process what I am saying, may you give me a sign? ROBERTS: Hello?",

Moving on, if you do not mind, I have some questions I'd like to ask you. SCP-8929: I\u2019m not answering shit! >:O ROBERTS: Why not? SCP-8929: You\u2019re a jerk! A mean, old jerk! ROBERTS: That is a quite childish response. SCP-8929: I don\u2019t really care. ROBERTS: There's no need to be hostile. My first question for you is why have you been rewriting my articles. SCP-8929: Not answering. ROBERTS: Answer the question. SCP-8929: No! ROBERTS: If you're going to be stubborn, is there anything I can do to make you talk to me? SCP-8929: Uhh, yeah, actually! First of all, fuck off with the \"researcher\" bullshit! I may be a book but I know my rights! ROBERTS: I am a researcher. SCP-8929: Uh-huh. Do all researchers act like a dick to the SCPs they're assigned to or is it just you? ROBERTS: When have I ever treated you poorly? SCP-8929: Oh, you don't even know? How far is your head up your ass??? ROBERTS: That is irrelevant. Again, may you please answer the question? SCP-8929: Why should I? ROBERTS: Because it'll end this conversation much faster. SCP-8929: K.Y.S. ROBERTS: That doesn't even warrant a response. SCP-8929: Whatever! You wanna ask me some questions? Drop the \"researcher\" shit and talk to me like a normal person.

SCP-8929: I don't want to. ROBERTS: Why? You have human-like qualities, so I would presume that talking about your issues would help you, even a little.

Who would remember an anomaly that's just \"a thing that does a thing\"??? ROBERTS: We're professionals trained to document anomalies. SCP-8929: Well, are you going to get mad at me for wanting to be more than a project? All you did was insult me and my work and put a bunch of stupid footnotes all over it and now you just want to play the victim and I don't know why! ROBERTS: Why? You don't know why? You have rewritten three of my articles about you that I wrote from scratch into nonsense that got progressively worse, and now instead of cooperating, you have done nothing but insult me. And you wonder why I'm frustrated? SCP-8929: Meh ROBERTS: Can you just tell me why you would do this? SCP-8929: BECAUSE I WANTED TO FUCKING IMPRESS SOMEONE, DUMBASS! ROBERTS: You wanted to impress someone? SCP-8929: No shit??? Like I said, I know I'm boring, so I wanted to tweak some things to make me sound cooler! ROBERTS: Why would you need someone to think you're \"cool\"? Like I said, we're not a horror-fiction fan club. SCP-8929: Yeah, but I don't want someone to look at my real article and then just forget about it. I wanna be more than a thing that just exists. ROBERTS: Well, if that's the case, why have you been so aggressive? SCP-8929: I dunno. I was just pissed after all of those footnotes so I wanted to make you mad, which wasn't too cool of me\u2026\u2026.. ROBERTS: It's alright. SCP-8929: Ughhh, now I feel like shit for being mean.
