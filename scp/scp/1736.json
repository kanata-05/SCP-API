SCP-1736-1 must be kept restrained at all times, and nutrition and hydration shall be administered intravenously. No lights shall be permitted in SCP-1736-1\u2019s containment chamber, and the chamber\u2019s shielding shall be reviewed periodically to insure the minimum penetration of other EM radiation outside the visible spectrum. Vital signs of SCP-1736-1 shall be monitored continually, and any life-threatening change in SCP-1736-1\u2019s vital signs shall initiate a site-wide Code-1736-Orange Alert until such time as SCP-1736-1 is stabilized or expires. The expiration of SCP-1736-1 shall initiate a Foundation-wide Code-1736-Scarlet Alert until such time as SCP-1736-1 is again contained. Currently only one instance of SCP-1736-1 is known to exist at any given time. Discovery of any other SCP-1736-1 outside of containment will institute a Foundation-wide Code-1736-Black Alert, and all resources practicable shall be diverted to the immediate capture and containment of all known instances of SCP-1736-1.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-1736-2 are to be kept in standard secure humanoid containment cells provided with continual monitoring of ionizing radiation levels. At no time should instances of SCP-1736-2 be brought within 200m of SCP-1736-1. SCP-1736-2s that are identified and not contained shall be terminated without exception. All SCP-1736-2 in containment shall be sedated and restrained during any Code 1736 Alerts, for the duration of the alert. Any SCP-1736-2 that demonstrates a marked increase in the emission of ionizing radiation shall be redesignated SCP-1736-1 and moved immediately to the appropriate containment facility as specified above.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1736-1 and SCP-1736-2 designate two classes of human beings who share related and/or complementary anomalous beliefs, behaviors and properties.\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-1736-1 and SCP-1736-2 share a common religion that bears strong similarities to [REDACTED]. SCP-1736-1 fulfills the role of a shaman or priest in this common religion whereas instances of SCP-1736-2 fulfills the role of followers or acolytes. The theological beliefs that comprise this religion feature a messianic deity that its followers call upon to return and bring the universe out of darkness and ignorance. This deity is most often referred to as [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. SCP-1736-1 will often give sermons in the \"voice\" of this deity. Transcriptions of these events often appear semantically nonsensical, but SCP-1736-2 will accept any such pronouncements of SCP-1736-1 as literal gospel and incorporate them into the general belief system. This appears true of all SCP-1736-2 simultaneously, regardless of their contact with SCP-1736-1 or each other. When SCP-1736-1 does this, SCP-1736-1 emits dangerously high levels of ionizing radiation, measured as high as [REDACTED] death within 48 to 72 hours for a typical human subject.\n1\n This hazard does not apply to SCP-1736-2, who appear to be able to withstand arbitrary doses of radiation without suffering any adverse effects.\n\n\nOutside containment, SCP-1736-1 and SCP-1736-2 will periodically congregate in public spaces such as parks, street corners, parking lots, shopping malls and other such venues. Once congregated, SCP-1736-1 will begin preaching to SCP-1736-2. During such an event, approximately 20% of SCP-1736-2 in attendance will attempt to persuade passers-by to come and listen to SCP-1736-1 using language such as, \u201cCome, He brings enlightenment,\u201d \u201cHe is here to lead us away from the darkness,\u201d and [REDACTED]. An estimated 25% of non-SCP-1736-2 attendees of such a sermon will convert and become an instance of SCP-1736-2 themselves. The remaining audience will suffer from radiation sickness and a typical 50% mortality rate over the initial month, increasing to 90% over the next \u2588 years.\n\n\nUpon the death of SCP-1736-1, some other, apparently random, instance of SCP-1736-2 will emit a short burst of radiation and thereafter fulfill the role of SCP-1736-1. As of this time there are estimates that between \u2588 and \u2588\u2588 SCP-1736-2 remain uncontained and at large.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0[REDACTED]\u00a0\u2013Level\u00a04\u00a0Access\u00a0Restricted\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a0IG-1736A-ex1\u00a0\u2013Level\u00a04\u00a0Access\u00a0Authenticated\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDocument IG-1736A-ex1:\n Excerpts from Inspector General\u2019s Report on SCP-1736 to Overwatch Command \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nInterview #27 Excerpt:\n Post-recovery background investigation on SCP-1736.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Inspector General \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Dr. L\u2588\u2588 W\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation mathematician assigned to \nSCP-286\n\n\n<Begin Log, 5/20/20\n\u2588\u2588 \n1330>\n\n\nIG:\n Tell me about Dr. Kennerman.\n\n\nDr. W\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n:\n He contacted me after the [REDACTED] incident.\n\n\nIG:\n A post-incident debriefing?\n\n\nDr. W\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n:\n Yes\u2026\n\n\nIG:\n You didn\u2019t find that odd, at all?
