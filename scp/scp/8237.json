If any instances are recovered, they will be stored in a Class III Secure Item Lockbox at Site-19. Only a maximum of ten copies of SCP-8237 are to be stored at any given time, with any excess copies being decommissioned via incineration.\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Archived\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Archived\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nWhile not in testing, SCP-8237 is to be kept within a \nClass III\n Class I Secure Item Lockbox located in Site-632 Secure Storage. The object is only to be removed from storage for testing purposes \nby employees with Clearance 3/8237\n under direct authorization from Research Head Dr. Stultus. Should SCP-8237 be removed for testing, it is only to be read by the designated D-Class in a secure testing environment.\n\n\nNote:\n I originally advised that the tome be kept in a higher security lockbox. The Class Is are simple non-electronic key locks that anyone with a decent set of lockpicking skills can open. The Director and I compromised with restricting who had clearance to test the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8237 is a large, leatherbound textbook bearing the name \nImpossible Feats and Their Solutions\n by the Wondertainment Publishing Division. The book has no discernable date of publication and has sustained considerable wear from consistent use. The contents of the book contain seemingly impossible feats with detailed instructions on how to perform them. These instructions appear to be backed by non-anomalous scientific principles, but are impossible to actually perform without breaking the aforementioned principles.\n\n\nWhen a subject reads any given page, they will suddenly find themselves experiencing that given action either as a participant or bystander. Research has concluded that a subject will only be affected once they have partially read any given page and the subject is unable to deviate from the present action until it is complete.\n\n\nAddendum-8237-1 (Acquisition):\n SCP-8237 was discovered by Dr. Stultus on the desk of a Site-632 employee, yet he was unable to identify who worked at the desk in question. Accompanied with the tome was the following letter:\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Document\u00a08237-1\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Document\u00a08237-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello old friend,\n\n\nIt's been quite a few years, how have you been? I've been doing quite well, not that you'd care. We left things off on quite a sour note, you trying to strangle me and all, but that's all in the past now, isn't it? I come to you with a proposition, a peace offering if you will.\n\n\nThis is a book I think you would find quite fascinating. The stuff in here allows the reader to do anything short of breaking reality. I would recommend keeping this thing locked up, but I know the Foundation. They're going to use every method available to find some use from this book. I was hoping that, by giving it to you, you can make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. You know well what the anomalous can do, so I trust you to keep this book safe. Or maybe you'll try and use it to fix all the issues you've got inside that head of yours. Either way, it's yours now. Do with it as you will, but know that I'll be watching to see how this all plays out.\n\nSee you on the Wayside,\n\nDr. John M. Finch\n\nThe Alternative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n I've never heard of this person before. I advise we take what they say with an air of caution. There has to be a reason they gave this book to us. As the Researcher Head, I advise we start testing until contact can be made with this individual. -Research Head Stultus\n\n\nAddendum-8237-2 (Testing):\n\n\nNotice:\n For a full list of unabridged testing logs, please contact Site Director Herbane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No.\n 8237-1\n\n\nSubject:\n D-3245\n\n\nPage:\n 15\n\n\nTopic:\n How to Cook a Steak Without Fire\n\n\nResults:\n Subject requested and was granted one full (unpackaged) T-bone steak. Subject then began repeatedly slapping the uncooked steak. After numerous unsuccessful attempts at getting the Subject to stop, security personnel were called in to remove the subject. Subject displayed high distress at being removed and refused to respond to any attempts at questioning.

Subject then proceeded to pitch the ball at supersonic speeds, resulting in damage to the testing room wall and extreme damage to the subject's arm. After several months of medical treatment, the subject was asked to reproduce the effects. The resulting pitch caused extensive damage to the testing room and to D-9267's arm and eardrums.

Upon delivery, subject slapped the steak at the speed of over 3,000 mph, resulting in the immediate cooking of the steak and the total destruction of the subject's arm. At the request of Dr. Stultus, the subject was provided with another steak with the expectation that they would use their remaining arm to repeat the effect. The subject refused to comply and was subsequently terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No.\n 8237-67\n\n\nSubject:\n N/A (This test utilized a remote-controlled robotic arm) \nNote:\n Y'know what?

Subject remained hesitant until the threat of termination, at which point he began to run at an exponentially increasing rate. After several seconds, subject lost control and collided with a testing chamber wall, causing extensive damage to both themselves and the surrounding environment. Subject terminated.\n\n\nNote:\n I don't care how much it costs and I don't care if you have to clean the D-Class off the floor.

The formula was initially confiscated by Dr. Stultus until Site Security forcefully removed the information from his possession. Subject was subsequently terminated\n\n\nNotice:\n Dr. Stultus has been suspended from research pending a formal inquiry into his misuse of Foundation resources \n-Dir.

Herbane had been invited to Site 19 to coordinate an experiment and was not able to receive the message.\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Site Director Gabriel Herbane\n\n\nFrom:\n Doctor Charles Stultus\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\nGabe,\n\n\nI'm not sure if this will even make it to you, but I just need to explain why I'm about to do this. A few years ago I came across\u2026something I would rather not relive. I've tried so hard to forget, and then I met The Alternative. I thought they would've made me forget everything if I just told him what had happened. I gave him my story, but I was wrong. In fact, I think the nightmares have gotten worse since I met them. I've been stealing amnestics for personal use, but I haven't had much luck with wiping these memories completely.\n\n\nThe book has to hide something that will be able to help me. I don't care if it's a mind-wipe or some way to get my hands on that Finch guy. This book is the key to giving me peace, we just need to keep looking. I've been going through so many pages that at this point I know we're close to something. I know what I need to do. I'm not sure what's going to happen, but know that no matter what, I'm sorry for all the harm I've caused in my search for peace of mind.\n\n\nGoodbye,\n\nCharles\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8237-4 (Incident-8237-ALTER):\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n On 02/13/1987, Site-632 underwent a breach of containment initiated by former Research Head Dr. C.

Dr. Stultus is seen to be extremely agitated and is seen shouting at Security Personnel.\n\n\n23:03:31\n Security Personnel recognizes that SCP-8237 was removed from containment and withdrew their firearm. A much more aggressive conversation follows in which Security Personnel continues attempts to remove Dr. Stultus from the Storage Area.\n\n\n23:03:37\n Dr. Stultus is seen to have increased aggravation and is visibly distressed.\n\n\n23:03:44:\n Researcher Stultus opens SCP-8237 to a random page.
