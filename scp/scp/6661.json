If popularity declines, the think tank is to evaluate the best course of action. SCP-6661-2 based memetic agents are to be spread throughout the internet and social media sites as well as Foundation intranet.\n\n\nFoundation web crawlers are to scan the internet for SCP-6661-1 instances and look out for any active SCP-6661-1 events. The final instructions of the SCP-6661-1 are to be redacted whenever possible.\n\n\nPersonnel directly dealing with SCP-6661-1 are to be memetically inoculated prior to being assigned to the object.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6661 is a phenomenon surrounding a particular internet meme\n1\n. SCP-6661-1 is an internet meme commonly known as Trollge. This meme spawned as a variant of the Trollface meme.\n\n\nThe meme starts out similarly to how a Trollface comic plays out, with the main character, Trollface\n2\n, providing instructions to carry out a prank. What distinguishes SCP-6661-1 from a regular Trollface meme is that the prank instructions begin devolving into more macabre instructions with each panel. These steps culminate in an atrocity or sinister event occurring.\n\n\nThe final step of each comic seems to be a cognitohazardous switch that makes a reader carry out the act displayed in the comic. It is estimated that 0.25% of those exposed to SCP-6661-1 are susceptible to its anomalous effects. It is currently unknown on what basis readers are chosen to carry out the skits.\n\n\n\n\nNOTABLE INCIDENTS\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0December\u00a02020\u00a0\"Pretty\u00a0Girl\"\u00a0Incident\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nWant to get back your girlfriend?\n\n\nStep 1: Find out her favourite facial cream.\n\n\nStep 2: Procure the facial cream.\n\n\nStep 3: Obtain urticant plant (Use gloves)\n\n\nStep 4: Blend the leaves with the cream, then repack it,\n\n\nStep 5: Give girlfriend the gift.\n\n\nStep 6: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n24/12/2020,\n\nMelbourne, Australia:\n\n\nCollege student, Leah Miller was hospitalised after applying a facial cream spiked with gympie-gympie (Dendrocnide moroides). The victim had crudely enucleated herself and had attempted to remove her face before being restrained by paramedics. Her ex-boyfriend and fellow college mate, Peter Witkins, were arrested at the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0December\u00a02020\u00a0\"Sleepy\u00a0time\"\u00a0Incident\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nWant to help little kids?\n\n\nStep 1: Get a job at a children's hospital.\n\n\nStep 2: Make friends with the children.\n\n\nStep 3: Enter oxygen tank room.\n\n\nStep 4: Replace tanks with carbon monoxide.\n\n\nStep 5: Release them from their defective vessels.\n\n\nStep 6: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n28/12/2020,\n\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia:\n\n\n15 terminally ill children were killed via carbon monoxide poisoning. Hospital orderly Aziz Hidayat was identified as the perpetrator after he was caught replacing oxygen tanks with carbon monoxide tanks. During the interrogation, he was recorded calmly stating that he was \"delivering them\". He has not stated who the recipient was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0January\u00a02021\u00a0\"Harvester\u00a0Valley\"\u00a0Incident\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nWant to have a good holiday?\n\n\nStep 1: Pack necessary equipment and items\n\n\nStep 2: Say goodbye to family.\n\n\nStep 3: Drive to the valley campgrounds.\n\n\nStep 4: Find local shepherd and his flock.\n\n\nStep 5: Steal a little lamb.\n\n\nStep 6: Relish upon its flesh for it will be your last meal.\n\n\nStep 7: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n20/1/2021,\n\nAlberta, Canada:\n\n\nOliver Desjardins entered a local tourist campground and opened fire upon the campers, killing 10 and injuring 14.

When emergency services were called to the scene, Proch\u00e1zka stood in front of the active nozzle and ignited a road flare. 26 people including Proch\u00e1zka were killed, and property damage was in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n\nReports of floating corpses and objects occurred when it began raining at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0February\u00a02021\u00a0\"Red\u00a0Master\"\u00a0Incident\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\n23/2/2021,\n\nBray, Ireland:\n\n\nBrother Brendan O'Brien is still at large.\n\nMTF Chi-13 \"Choir Boys\" were deployed to the site.

Before carrying out the necessary expungement, Junior Researcher Michael Ramirez edited out the distortion and scanned the image through a spectrogram generator without authorisation.

With permission from the O5, a spectrogram was constructed with a reply to the question and spread through the internet. Within 24 hours, another SCP-6661-1 instance with the distortion was detected and isolated.\n\n\nThe following is a record of the messages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation made spectrogram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6661 response:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n5/3/2021:\n Yes, we see you.
