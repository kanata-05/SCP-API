Those outside the SCP-7538 management team may also participate with permission from the Research Head.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7538 designates a group of sentient stuffed selachians colloquially referred to as 'Bl\u00e5haj', manufactured by the Swedish company IKEA.\n\n\nSpecimens of SCP-7538 are capable of levitation, travelling through the air in a matter comparable to swimming in the ocean. Despite bearing a resemblance to typical blue sharks, SCP-7538's behavior are similar to that of domesticated canines, being fairly docile and able to understand simple instructions.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Recording Log\n\n\nOn the 9\nth\n of November, 2021, an unauthorized package was delivered to Site-757 before being taken in by Dr. Mako and brought to SCP-7538's cell. Due to this, Senior Researcher Anthony Clips was sent in to investigate the matter.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nClips enters the containment chamber while fixated on a clipboard he has in hand.\n\n\nClips:\n Good afternoon, Ms. Mako. Director Numen had sent me here to inspect a certain matter involving a recent package that arrived on-site. Apparently, I was told you would know about it so \u2014\n\n\nHe looks up and sees Mako, who is staring back at him while taping a boxing glove to the tip of an SCP-7538 instance's nose with duct tape. Her mouth is agape and her eyes are widened as Clips accidentally drops his clipboard. There is a brief moment of silence.\n\n\nA number of other specimens are also equipped with boxing gloves. He kneels down and picks up his clipboard.\n\n\nClips:\n What are you doing?\n\n\nMako glances away from Clips before looking back.\n\n\nMako:\n What does it look like I'm doing?\n\n\nClips:\n It looks like you're attaching boxing gloves to your pet sharks.\n\n\nMako:\n Well, you'd be right, my good man. Thanks for the observation!\n\n\nClips clicks his pen repeatedly and sighs.\n\n\nClips:\n I'm reporting you to the higher ups.\n\n\nMako:\n Wait, wait, wait \u2014\n\n\nMako scrambles to Clips, almost tripping while doing so.\n\n\nMako:\n I can assure you that I have a very reasonable explanation behind\u2026 \n(gestures)\n all this. It makes a lot of sense once you hear me out.\n\n\nClips:\n I'm sorry but I doubt there's anything reasonable about \nthat.\n\n\nClips points to two SCP-7538 instances bumping into each other using the boxing gloves. She turns to them and lets out a chuckle.\n\n\nMako:\n It's cute, isn't it?\n\n\nClips:\n That's\u2026 besides the point.\n\n\nMako:\n Eh, you were considering it for a moment.\n\n\nClips:\n No, I wasn't.\n\n\nMako:\n Are you \nshore?\n Laying playful punches on your new fishy friends. You'd be down for that, right?\n\n\nClips:\n No, I wouldn't. That's ridiculous.\n\n\nMako turns back.\n\n\nMako:\n Look, Clippy \u2014\n\n\nClips:\n Don't call me \"Clippy\".\n\n\nMako:\n \u2014 \nClips,\n right. This is all just a misunderstanding. I mean, I\u2019m only trying to expand on our recreational activities. Creating more games we can play together, you know?\n\n\nClips:\n And you jumped to\u2026 \nboxing gloves?\n\n\nMako:\n This is just an experiment!\n\n\nClips:\n This is a glorified show-and-tell at an elementary school.\n\n\nMako:\n Good g\nreef\n, Clips. You're hurting the poor souls. Look at them.\n\n\nTwo SCP-7538 instances are chasing one another. Clips raises his eyebrow.\n\n\nClips:\n You're hurting the site's budget.\n\n\nMako:\n No, I'm not. This is from my own paycheck, honest.\n\n\nClips:\n Then you're hurting your own budget. I'm leaving.\n\n\nMako rushes to the entrance, blocking him.\n\n\nMako:\n I'm afraid I can't let you go, Clips.\n\n\nClips:\n Step away, Ms. Mako. You're being highly unprofessional.\n\n\nMako:\n No. I'm sorry, but you leave me no choice. \n(Raises her voice)\n Finions!\n\n\nAll SCP-7538 specimens faces Mako and Clips.\n\n\nClips:\n What the f \u2014\n\n\nMako:\n \nATTACK!\n\n\nMako shoves Clips to the ground as the SCP-7538 instances approach him, proceeding to surround and punch him all over his body again and again.\n\n\nMako:\n That's right. Come on, boys. Punch him in the gut!\n\n\nClips:\n Hey, stop! Get off of me!\n\n\nMako:\n What's wrong, Clips? Don't you \nsea\n how much fun they're having?\n\n\nClips:\n Mako, for the love of \u2014 \now!\n\n\nClips shields himself from the specimens with his clipboard.\n\n\nMako:\n I'm sure it can also improve staff morale. Very entertaining, very fun. It's a jawsome idea, don't you agree?\n\n\nClips:\n \nOw!\n \u2014 As if.\n\n\nMako:\n Aw, you're such a gilljoy.\n\n\nClips:\n Mako, can you please stop this whole fiasc \u2014 \now!\n \u2014 STOP THAT!\n\n\nThe SCP-7538 instances stop and hesitate for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nMako:\n No, I still need more data. Just keep 'em occupied for a little longer, okay?\n\n\nClips:\n Ugh\u2026\n\n\nThe next few minutes consist of Clips being constantly hit by the SCP-7538 instances, occasionally but unsuccessfully attempting to wave them off with his arm. Mako then calls them off, causing the specimens to fly elsewhere and interact with each other again.\n\n\nClips remains in a fetal position as Mako kneels down, staring at his face. He ignores her and turns to the ground.\n\n\nMako:\n So, \nwater\n your thoughts? What'd you think?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nClips:\n \u2026I think I hate you.\n\n\nAnother pause. Mako grins.\n\n\nMako:\n \n(Inhales)\n Worth it.\n\n\n[FIN. LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mako was later reprimanded for this behavior. The boxing gloves were also confiscated and removed from facility grounds.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncmon clips\n\n\ni said i was sorry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, Mako. You should consider this a warning for such childish conduct. Even if your department handles matters concerning the morale of anomalies, I did not consent to being endlessly punched by shark toys stuck with boxing gloves.\n\n\nApology unaccepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nokay, yeah, that was unfair. i shouldve given u the chance to fight back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat did u do with the gloves anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike we said, they were disposed of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno dont lie\n\n\ni saw that glimmer in ur eyes back there\n\n\ntheres no need to be so uptide, u know\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not lying.\n\n\nStop with the puns.\n\n\nAnd stop acting like you know what you're saying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlook, me and the other management staff r planning to have an all out fight with our sharks. twice as many boxing gloves, twice as many punches, twice as fun\n\n\ni know u said we shouldnt slack off like that but theres nothing wrong with loosening up every once in a while\n\n\nbesides, we can just write it off as standard protocol. im sure its fine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, I have no reason to play around with you lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclips, its a simple yes or no question\n\n\nu wanna come with or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nOkay, fine.\n\n\nThe gloves are in my closet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncool, sea u next week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwinkwonkboi's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6199\n \n(+142)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6714\n \n(+104)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8386\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2689\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7245\n \n(+54)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4931\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6895\n \n(+32)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5358\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8184\n \n(+9)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8245\n \n(+81)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6039\n \n(+74)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6306\n \n(+57)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6245\n \n(+65)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3204\n \n(+78)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7735\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nAnomalous Entity Engagement Division Orientation\n \n(+54)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwater diet\n \n(+27)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nur typical unrequited love\n \n(+33)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething's Burning\n \n(+40)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodnight, Sweet Dreams\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritter Profile: Miss Cassandra!\n \n(+40)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Jones Marcel Should Be Employee of the Century\n \n(+11)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Care, Dear\n \n(+14)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Taste For Sore Eyes\n \n(+12)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#WettleAppreciationPost\n \n(+140)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sinking Feeling\n \n(+26)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to feel something.\n \n(+32)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoses And Thorns\n \n(+18)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nman overboard!\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Kirby's Case, Part I: An Antithesis\n \n(+11)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nCertified Criminal\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELTHY: SCP-6780 Fanart\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICED: SCP-7345 Fanart\n \n(+19)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection Of Trolls (8999 Fanart)\n \n(+89)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENLIGHTENMENT: SCP-6059 Fanart\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTWITNESS: SCP-5843 Fanart\n \n(+30)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfroot froggo :)\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRACKHEAD: SCP-173 Fanart\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfart exchange gift for jim (7384 fanart)\n \n(+25)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMBUST: SCP-6057 Fanart\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESPOND: Telecommunications Monitoring Office Fanart\n \n(+48)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFISHER: SCP-2689 Fanart\n \n(+24)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing CalcaRuler: Halloween Emperor\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfading stars doodles (straight from my phone's sketchbook app)\n \n(+37)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7K DOODLES\n \n(+72)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7537\n | SCP-7538 | \nSCP-7539\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7538\n\" by winkwonkboi, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
