Due to the nature of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588's primary project, transfer of SCP-5499 to a proper containment site has been deemed unfeasible at present.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5499 is an L7\n1\n-Brand Smart Refrigerator, Model 2S. Prior to its installation in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 Break Room on January 31st, 2005, SCP-5499 displayed no anomalous properties.\n\n\nOutside of direct observation, SCP-5499 is capable of damaging foodstuffs placed within its chassis. Such damages occur in bursts of 1 to 4, typically spaced at least 4 hours apart, and are accompanied by a series of messages played across SCP-5499's touchscreen. The process by which SCP-5499 chooses foodstuff is unknown, although it shows considerable preference towards foodstuffs of sweet and savory flavor profiles.\n\n\nSCP-5499 was discovered following a series of complaints to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 Human Resources Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5499-001: OBSERVED ACTIVATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a rough approximation of the date and time of select activations, based on available security footage and subsequent tickets filed with the Human Resources Department. In the interests of budget, no tests were conducted on SCP-5499's anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate and Time (Estimated)\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nObserved Messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1st, 2005, 13:44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottle of iced tea completely drained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mmm haha just what I needed\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1st, 2005\u00a018:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Specialist \u2588\u2588\u2588's lunch disappears, and Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's brownie is reduced to half its original mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ah that hit the spot\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2nd, 2005, 14:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnician \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's birthday cake is covered in a series of uneven depressions, with a plastic fork stuck into its side.
