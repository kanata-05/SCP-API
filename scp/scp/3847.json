Outpost-3847 has been established at the entrance to SCP-3847 and is maintained by Site-143. Outpost-3847 must be continually manned by 2 personnel to warn off civilians and monitor the area. Experiments and updates regarding SCP-3847 are to be filed back to Site-143.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3847 is an area of roughly 40\u00a0m X 80\u00a0m X \n5\u00a0m\n 20\u00a0m, located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Henan Province, China. When within SCP-3847, vocalizations produced by avian creatures\n1\n are perceived by human subjects as messages in their native language, hereafter referred to as SCP-3847-1.\n\n\nSCP-3847-1 instances are scattered messages, often words of encouragement or comfort, with occasional repetition. They seem to be addressing a certain unknown individual, rather than the affected subjects, and are not influenced by attempts at communication.\n\n\nRecording of avian vocalizations within SCP-3847 shows that only human perceptions are altered while the original sounds are unaffected. SCP-3847-1 instances also do not correspond to the original vocalizations in length, volume, or pitch. Furthermore, different human subjects often perceive the same vocalization as different messages. It is therefore believed that birds entering the area are not the source of SCP-3847-1, and do not gain intelligence in the process.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Examples\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3847-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Examples\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3847-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance yourself with nature. Your mind and body at ease. Feel the flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't torture yourself by thinking about it. There are wonders to be explored, let's focus on that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will not be alone. It is with your help, and he appreciates that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe won\u2019t blame you. Your king won\u2019t either. You don't have to blame yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure you will have a sweet dream tonight. Blessings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not your fault, you did what you can. The whole kingdom appreciates your effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's okay if you want to be left alone. Stay here with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo more worries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need to dwell on the past. The hills are charming today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare your burden with me. I will understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe machine will keep him happy, just like we will keep you happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to study some scrolls. I will accompany you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a beautiful day outside! Camellias are blooming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not come join us in the field? We will sing for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou couldn't have seen it coming. Afterall, he was the greatest king.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about it anymore, sit down and have some tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don't have to feel lonely here. We are here for you, always will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3847 came to the Foundation\u2019s attention after several locals accidentally discovered its properties.\n\n\nUpdate:\n Further experimentation finds that ophidian creatures are subject to the same effect as avian creatures within SCP-3847. The messages produced in this way are hereafter referred to as SCP-3847-2. SCP-3847-2 appears drastically different from SCP-3847-1 in tone and manner.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Examples\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3847-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Examples\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3847-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoward.

Witness what you allowed to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you just sit here, while he suffers? Do you think that mere machine is enough to ease his pain? For all he did for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was your mentor and friend. You owe him everything. Go back to him. Go back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow could you let him do it alone?
