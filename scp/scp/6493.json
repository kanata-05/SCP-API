Usage of SCP-6493 must be approved by O5-Council\n1\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6493 is the designation given to two objects:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6493-A, a .60-caliber Syrian flintlock pistol of early 19th century make, that provokes both visual and auditory hallucinations to any individual that holds it;\n\n\nSCP-6493-B, a collection of \n62\n 57 bullets, which display a significantly low internal Hume level\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen loaded and shot through SCP-6493-A, any instance of SCP-6493-B will rapidly reach baseline Hume levels, along with the general area of its path and any object that it collides with. When said object is a Reality Bender, or any other ontokinetic entity or object, any effect that the target will be violently dismembered, resulting in the neutralization of its anomalous effects. Although it is hypothetically possible to neutralize the effects without killing the subject, the explosive nature of SCP-6493-B makes it virtually impossible.\n\n\nSCP-6493 was previously owned by late GOC Strike Team member Louis Laurent. It was purchased by Laurent in Damascus, Syria in the aftermath of a joint GOC-Foundation operation involving the termination of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It is currently unknown if SCP-6493 has always been anomalous since its creation, or rather gained its properties after the death of Agent Laurent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1 /// Experimentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment-1\n\n\nExperiment-2\n\n\nExperiment-3\n\n\nExperiment-4,-5,-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 01/07/2020\n\n\nPresiding:\n Dr. Kyer, D-986271\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-986271 was instructed to hold SCP-6493-A, load it with an ordinary .60 bullet, shoot at a target from a distance of 20\u00a0m, and report any type of hallucination.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n D-986271 reported hearing a man frenetically crying followed by a loud gunshot after picking SCP-6493-A. D-986271 was not able to shoot the bullet after loading, as the flint mechanism did not respond to the pulling of the trigger.\n\n\n \n\n\nNotes from Dr. Kyer:\n 'D-986271 exhibited a sense of stress and anxiety following this experiment.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 01/07/2020\n\n\nPresiding:\n Dr. Kyer, D-986271\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-986271 was instructed to load an ordinary flintlock pistol with one SCP-6493-B, shoot at a target from a distance of 20 m, and report any type of hallucination.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n D-986271 did not report any hallucination. Subject was not able to shoot SCP-6493-B, as it appeared to not ignite, despite the flint mechanism working as intended. SCP-6493-B's internal Hume level remained between 0.1-0.4 Hm.\n\n\n \n\n\nNotes from Dr. Kyer:\n 'Following a psychological analysis, D-986271 was dismissed from further experimentaion involving SCP-6493.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 02/07/2020\n\n\nPresiding:\n Dr. Kyer, D-801718\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-801718 was instructed to load SCP-6493-A with -B, shoot at a Scranton Reality Anchor (fixed at 75 Hm) from a distance of 40\u00a0m, and report any type of hallucination.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n D-801718 reported being able to see a toppled chair, and to hear an infant crying while holding SCP-6493-A. D-801718 successfully loaded SCP-6493-A and shot SCP-6493-B toward the Reality Anchor. The Hume level of the area rapidly reached baseline values, and after being perforated by SCP-6493-B, the Reality Anchor stopped working. Following analysis showed that the internal components of the SRA were broken beyond repair.\n\n\n \n\n\nNotes from Dr. Kyer:\n 'Further experimentation with SRAs is required to gatter enough data. D-801718 did not show any substantial psychological disturbance.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiments 4, 5 and 6 were omitted for brevity; procedure and results were similar to Experiment-3. D-801718 reported the following hallucinations:\n\n\n\n\na woman yelling something unintelligible;\n\n\na knife flying;\n\n\na man standing in front of them;\n\n\na 'loud and violent arguement'\n3\n;\n\n\nSCP-6493-A in a drawer;\n\n\na bloody carpet;\n\n\na crib;\n\n\nglass shards on a table;\n\n\na woman holding a knife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM ETHICS COMMETTEE\n\n\n \n\n\nDate:\n 06/07/2020\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-6493 and its future usage.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the experiments brought forth by Dr. Kyer, experimentation of SCP-6493 has been \nsuspended until further notice\n.\n\n\n \n\nFuture usage of SCP-6493 \nmust\n be allowed by O5 Council vote under the threat of any K-Class Scenario involving any ontokinetic threat. By order of the O5 Council, MTF Nu-8 \"Gun Control\" must be established as a Task Force capable of safely using SCP-6493 in case of such Scenario becoming reality.\n\n\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2 /// Discovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 30/06/2020, at 00:27, the following email was sent to a computer terminal of Site-42.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nresearcher.david.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@scp.int\n\n\nFrom:\n \nresearcher.jane.ware@scp.int\n\n\nSubject:\n Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey David, it's been a while.

Yes, I'm a Reality Bender, although I'm still fairly weak. I've decided to turn myself in, send someone to come pick me up. I promise I don't have bad intentions, I just think that remaining here could be dangerous for everyone, for both Lyvia and Louis.\n\n\n \n\nDon't worry, I didn't tell anything to Louis, I don't know how he could react. One thing that I know is that he wouldn't support me reaching out to the Foundation for this. I can't believe that in 8 years he still can't understand that 'shooting big scary monster' is not always the solution, I'm starting to believe that the GOC actually indoctrinates its members. Turning myself to them means suicide, and yes I know that he just wants me to be in the safest of hands, but he just can't comprehend that those hands are not the GOC's.\n\n\n \n\nRespond soon,\n\nResearcher Jane Ware.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher David \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 notified Site Director John M.

Due to the demands of the GOC over the possession of SCP-6493, a meeting between representatives from both organizations was scheduled for 09/07/2020 in order to settle the dispute. By O5 council order, O5-\u2588, O5-\u2588 and Dr. Eberhardt were chosen as the Foundation's representatives.\n\n\nMTF Eta-5 agent Patrick Blake, known to be a long time friend of both Louis Laurent and researcher Jane Ware, was interviewed in order to move forward the investigation effort.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\nDate:\n 01/07/2020\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Eberhardt\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Agent Patrick Blake\n\n\nForeword:\n Agent Blake was asked about his relationship with Louis Laurent and Jane Ware, and give further information about the couple themselves.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Laurent during a UN peacekeeping mission in the late 2000's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Good day Agent Blake.\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Good day Doctor.\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n We are here to talk about the Laurent couple. I was told you were an acquaintance of them, were you not?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Yes\u2026 Doctor.\n\n\n[ \nAgent Blake started sobbing\n ]\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Hey, everything's ok. Take your time if you must.\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n No, I'm\u2026 I'm ok. So, me and Jane were friends back in Middle School. Both my father and her mother were Foundation researchers, so obviously we followed their steps. Her as a researcher, me as a J\u00e4eger Bomber\u2026\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n And what about Laurent?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Louis\u2026 Louis\u2026 He was a strange fellow. Strike Team member, nickname 'LAWDOG'; we met in Syria in 2011, during the operation for the termination of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, are you familiar with that, Doctor?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Yes, I'm aware.\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Good. Jane arrived after the battle, as a field researcher, or something like that. They met in Damascus, she fell for him first. Eventually they started dating, and in 2014 they started living together in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, after Louis got discharged. A year ago they married and had Lyvia. Oh God, is she ok right now?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Yes Agent, Lyvia is safe now. Although someone will have to take custody over her.\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Is that also going to be decided in that meet up thing?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Yes. I'll be attending the 'meet up thing' too. I can assure you we won't let the GOC take her.\n\n\n[ \nsilence\n ]\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n So anyway, you said that Laurent was a 'strange fellow', can you elaborate on that?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Yeah\u2026 He was the archetype of the perfect soldier. They always tell us that 'a good soldier doesn't question, they just act', well Louis took that way too seriously.\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n In what way?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n For him, anything said by GOC High Command was devine law. He just\u2026 took his duty over anything else. There were rumours back in Syria about him, some thought he was some sort of secret project or super soldier made by the GOC, always obeying order.\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n Thank you Agent. Can you tell us more about Jane Ware?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Sure. She always had been interested by her mother's work, so she put a lot on time in her reasearch. She was the brightest and most kind-hearted person I've ever known. And regarding her relationship with Louis, they did truly loved eachother, even though they did sometimes clash, because of the different philosophies of the Foundation and the GOC you see.\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n And what about her condition? Did she ever tell you about it?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n No, I discovered that Jane was a Reality Bender just a few hours ago. As far as I was told, she herself discovered this just recently. By the way Doctor, was she found in the end?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n I'm not allowed to tell you about the current status of Jane Ware.\n4\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n I see\u2026 and what about the meeting, what's that about besides Lyvia?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n I'm sorry, I cannot speak of this either.\n\n\n[ \nAgent Blake started sobbing for about 1 minute\n ]\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n I\u2026 I have another question. Have you ever heard of an antique gun belonging to Laurent?\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Uh\u2026 Yeah his flintlock, he bought it back in Damascus, why the question?\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n It was found in the bedroom, we believe it is connected to the incident.\n\n\nAgent Blake:\n Oh\u2026 I see.\n\n\nDr. Eberhardt:\n This concludes the interview.

Libero.\n\n\nDate:\n 09/07/2020\n\n\nLocation:\n London, UK.\n\n\nSubjects discussed:\n Ownership of SCP-6493; custody over Lyvia Marie-Claire Laurent.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n An agreement, involving SCP-6493 being officialy recognized by the GOC to be left in the hands of the Foundation, and custody over Lyvia Marie-Claire Laurent being left to be decided by Foundation, was reached.\n\n\nNotable exchange from the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nAmbassador Lynd H.
