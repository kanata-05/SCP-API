In low dosages it provides effects similar to a mild stimulant, although most users also report impaired cognition and difficulty forming thoughts. SCP-7985-1 are circular white pills with the text \u201cMylex\u2122\u201d stamped into their side. SCP-7985-1 is so far the only known delivery vector for SCP-7985. Approximately 50mg of SCP-7985 is present in each dose of SCP-7985-1.\n\n\nThe anomalous effects of SCP-7985 are only apparent at high dosages or after prolonged, persistent exposure to low dosages of the chemical. Under these conditions, it begins to have extreme effects on cognition and individual agency significantly beyond those generated by conventional narcotics.\n\n\nAll further testing involving SCP-7985 has been permanently suspended following the review of materials taken in the raid leading to SCP-7985\u2019s initial discovery and containment.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Recovered Materials\n\n\nAll known instances of SCP-7985-1 in Foundation custody were discovered in a raid on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Co., a civilian pharmaceutical concern. It is unknown how \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Co. first came to possess SCP-7985-1\n1\n, and all involved civilians were amnesticized following SCP-7985-1\u2019s capture and recovery. The following materials were recovered along with 86 instances of SCP-7985-1.\n\n\n\n\nTRIAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\nPRODUCT:\n MYLEX\u2122 50 MG\n\n\nDATE:\n 4-7-1983 - INDEFINITE\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n Subjects are to be administered Mylex\u2122 once every 48 hours. After each administration, the status of each patient is to be assessed via the following questionnaire:\n\n\n1: Please rate your level of wakefulness over the past 48 hours. 5 is an average level of awareness, while 10 is extremely drowsy and 1 is extremely alert.\n\n\n2: Have you experienced any unexpected pains/cramps over the past 48 hours?\n\n\n3: Have you felt any nausea or other unexpected symptoms over the past 48 hours?\n\n\n4: You trip over a dead squirrel/bird/other nonspecific small animal on the sidewalk. Do you keep walking or check your shoe?\n\n\n5: Would you rather lose a leg or an arm?\n\n\n6: You have been found, bureaucratically, to not exist. Do you attempt to re-register yourself w/ the state, or use this opportunity to vanish?\n\n\n7: Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex\u2122?\n\n\n8: What is fear?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW FORM\n\n\nInterview #:\n 12-5\n\n\nPatient Name\n: Jorge Poitros\n\n\nDoses\n: 5\n\n\n\n\n[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\nI\n: You trip over a dead squirrel/bird/other nonspecific small animal on the sidewalk. Do you keep walking or check your shoe?\n\n\nPatient #12\n: Could it be a chipmunk?\n\n\nI\n: If you wish.\n\n\nPatient #12\n: I don\u2019t like chipmunks. I keep walking. If it\u2019s under my foot I figure it darn well deserves to be there.\n\n\nI\n: Would you rather lose a leg or an arm?\n\n\nPatient #12\n: Leg. Arms are how we exist. Generally, when we do something considered to be part of \u201cliving\u201d, we do it with our arms. The hands play a role, but it\u2019s minimal.\n\n\nI\n: You have been found, bureaucratically, to not exist. Do you attempt to re-register yourself w/ the state, or use this opportunity to vanish?\n\n\nPatient #12\n: Vanish. Social Security can bite me.\n\n\nI\n: Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex\u2122?\n\n\nPatient #12\n: I did, but I forget why. It\u2019s a wonder drug. I wonder why I did.\n\n\nI\n: What is fear?\n\n\nPatient #12\n: Hey, you\u2019re not going to take me off this stuff if I answer wrong, right?\n\n\n\n\n[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW FORM\n\n\nInterview #:\n 17-8\n\n\nPatient Name:\n Cynthia Barangsa\n\n\nDoses:\n 17\n\n\n\n\n[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\nI:\n Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex\u2122?\n\n\nPatient #17:\n I couldn\u2019t hate it. No, I couldn\u2019t hate it. But I don\u2019t like you. You\u2019re what makes it real and painful. When it\u2019s just me and my nervous system, I can pretend I don\u2019t feel anything. It\u2019s all just\u2013 you know, small parts of a crumbling whole. I\u2019m 67. I can comfortably pretend random pains and sensory oddities are just transient things brought on by age. Decay claims everything. Even without any specific condition, I\u2019m going to hurt and suffer and feel sick for reasons I can\u2019t understand.\n\n\nPatient #17:\n But you make it real. You tie it all back to this drug. I don\u2019t get to escape from it and shove it all into tomorrow. I\u2019m suffering real and actual pain because of a choice I made. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\n\nI:\n What is fear?\n\n\nPatient #17:\n What I feel when I think of my heart quietly stopping when I\u2019m four hours into the night. The idea of an empty supermarket. I feel a tightness in my throat when I think of a barren shelf. Disorder in places we most expect control. Just-in-time shipping is my idea of God.\n\n\nPatient #17:\n Not you. I don\u2019t think of you.

I forget it if I say it, too, but if I say it at least it doesn't just vanish. There\u2019s a spider on your hand.\n\n\nPatient #5\n: I want to go back to being nauseous.

It was determined to be relevant to SCP-7985, and was attached to the file for the object for preservation. The original document is presumed lost.\n\n\n\n\nMYLEX\u2122\n\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\n\nTraditional focus groups are presented with one central problem: the difficulty of accurately sampling a truly average American. People are too idiosyncratic on the level of handfuls and dozens that most groups typically operate. Too many individual quirks: not enough people with the same birthdays, incongruent political beliefs, membership in opposing bowling leagues, etc.\n\n\nMylex\u2122 solves this issue. Say hello to the real, truly average American: a collage of dozens of demographically typical individuals. All opinions expressed are that of a representative sample. A focus group of merely 12 Mylex\u2122-boosted Americans has been demonstrated in multiple commercial studies to be substantially more accurate than normal focus groups in determining consumer tastes and preferences.\n\n\nTry the marketing revolution. Try Mylex\u2122.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
