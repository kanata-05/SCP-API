It is to be isolated within an underground bunker, located at least 500 meters from the main site, with access granted only to female security personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n\nMembers of the public who have attended events featuring SCP-4649 are to be amnesticised and relocated out of Grozny, Russia.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n PoI-4649 and her associates are to be considered Level 4 containment priorities. Under no circumstances are they to come into contact with SCP-4649. PoI-4649 (currently the only member in custody) is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell and supervised only by female Foundation staff.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4649 is an octagonal-ring, 9 meters across in diameter, normally utilised in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) competition. The outer fencing is made of reinforced steel and its base comprises of plywood, foam, and canvas. The floor of the structure is suspended 1.2 meters off the ground.\n\n\nAny blood that comes into contact with the base of SCP-4649 dissipates within 24 hours, whether human in origin or otherwise. Inspection of the area directly beneath the structure shows no trace residue or stains.\n\n\nFollowing \nAbsolute Championship Berkut 19\n1\n, SCP-4649 has been found to induce increased aggression, adrenaline spikes and a dampening of neuro-inhibitors in biologically male subjects (See Addendum 4649-01 for more information).\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation was alerted to the anomalous nature of \"Absolute Championship Berkut\" events in general after a total of 16 deaths were reported within a six-month period, with members of the audience comprising a quarter of the casualties. In addition, law enforcement records show spikes in arrests for violent assault, more than triple that for disorderly behaviour and an overwhelming number of complaints lodged for noise pollution whenever an ACB event was hosted in the area.\n\n\nThe disappearance of blood from SCP-4649 was first attributed to a dedicated janitorial team, who was tasked with the removal of human fluids at the conclusion of each event. CCTV footage from the arena, however, showed no such janitorial interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Addendum\u00a04649-01:\u00a0Initial\u00a0Site\u00a0Survey\n\n\n\n\n\u229f\u00a0Addendum\u00a04649-01:\u00a0Initial\u00a0Site\u00a0Survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Lead Researchers, Dr. Yuri Sobakin (Male, 41) and Dr. Alena Koshka (Female, 35), posed as attendees at \nACB 19: The Baltic Challenge\n.

Roughly 1,000 people in attendance. The lights have been dimmed, with only SCP-4649 illuminated by flood-lights in the center of the arena.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Sound check, if you'd please, Alena.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Registered. About 85 decibels. Normal for a crowd like this.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Reminds me of \nGriboyedovsky\n2\n, doesn't it?\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Please, there were \nmore\n people back then.\n\n\n[20:16]: \nThe first fight commences: two Caucasian males trade punches and kicks within the confines of SCP-4649.\n\n\n[20:25]: \nThe fighter in red inflicts a deep wound above his opponent's eye \u2014 first blood of the night. Despite the fighter in black bleeding profusely, the referee ignores the injury and waves for the fight to continue.\n\n\n[20:31]: \nThe fighter in black goes down in the 2nd minute of the 3rd round. The fighter in red pins him down and continues raining punches down on him even though the fight is over. The referee restrains him after a minute has passed.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Spike of 120 on the decibel-meter!\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Feels like a chainsaw going off next to my ear.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Zoom in on canvas.\n\n\n[20:33]: \nCamera captures multiple splotches of blood on the floor of SCP-4649.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Multiple incidences of high-velocity blood splatters within SCP-4649, and they already appear to be fading.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Hmph. Definitely more blood on that shithead when he tried to hit on you at the bar last week.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Focus, Yuri.\n\n\n[20:45-21:33]: \nThe second and third fights escalate in violence. The former lasts a full five rounds, whilst the latter only lasts sixty seconds. Both, however, feature the same amount of blood loss. SCP-4649 is three-quarters covered in blood by this point, making it difficult for the camera to focus on any one spot. Decibel readings rise to 130, similar to the roar of a jet's engines.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Make sure you\u2019re recording every inch of the floor, Koshka!\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n I\u2019m trying! There\u2019s just\u2026 so much\u2026\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n If you can't do it properly, maybe I should take over!\n\n\n[22:05]: \nThe fourth fight commences. One of the fighters repeatedly throws his opponent down to the canvas before targeting his face with punches. Both fighters become completely covered in blood, of which its origins cannot be determined by this point of time.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n (muffled) Decibel readings are through the roof! 140 and rising! If this continues, we\u2019ll go deaf, Yuri! Yuri?!\n\n\n[22:15]: \nCamera pans to the right, where Dr. Sobakin is seen to be on his feet, screaming and shouting along with the rest of the crowd. His face extremely flushed.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n KILL HIM! KILL THE BASTARD!\n\n\n[22:16]: \nCamera whips to the left, where a brawl erupts between two men in the stands.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n Yuri! Perhaps we should terminate the operation and\u2014\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n Quiet! The main event is starting! Make sure you film the \nmothers\n properly!\n\n\n[22:17]: \nCamera shaky as it pans back to SCP-4649. The music is so loud that nothing else can be heard in the arena. Two women make their way down the aisles from opposite sides, with rows of spectators bowing and swaying in sync with the music.\n\n\n[22:19]: \nSound-recording device shows a consistent reading of 150 decibels (a thunderclap repeatedly going off) with each beat of the speakers. The device also captures Dr. Koshka's breathing, close to the mic.\n\n\n[22:20]: \nThe main event begins. The camera shakes as the stadium erupts in a frenzy. Dr. Koshka\u2019s panicked gasps can be heard as she struggles to keep the camera focused on SCP-4649. The female fighters tear into each other, repeatedly throwing each other down into the congealed blood beneath their feet.\n\n\n[22:25]: \nCamera captures a mass brawl occurring in the lower stands. People are climbing over and tackling each other to the ground. Dr. Sobakin lunges at someone in the row in front.\n\n\n[22:29]: \nDr. Koshka turns the camera up towards her face.\n\n\nDr. Koshka:\n (shouts) Help me!! He's gone crazy! Everyone is killing\u2014!\n\n\n[22:30]: \nDr. Sobakin grabs the camera, grinding his teeth into the feed. Both his ears are bleeding from either side.\n\n\nDr. Sobakin:\n BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! BLOOD FOR THE MOTHERS!\n\n\n[22:31]: \nKoshka screams as the handheld camera falls to the floor.

Let's just say she lost her head, and I kept my own. Dr. Koshka: But we stopped your little blood ritual. The Foundation has you in custody, along with your broken arena. Ms. Pevneva: Oh, but I can wait, daughter. History has shown that your kind cannot hold us forever. Meanwhile, my sisters will carry my mantle to the rest of the world. There is no stopping us from rewriting history as we see fit. Dr. Koshka: You\u2026 If I could put you down the same way you did those innocent men and women, I would do so in a heartbeat. Ms. Pevneva: Please. We both know you cared less about those \"innocent\" men and women less than wanting revenge for your husband. They were nothing more than slaves to the spectacle, daughter, with their lust, greed and unbridled rage. I didn't kill Yuri. No\u2026 I saved you from him. They killed themselves when they entered the arena that night, when they revealed who they really were. Dr. Koshka is visibly upset. Dr. Koshka: You're wrong. Yuri was a brilliant man. Ms. Pevneva: Those who willingly throw themselves into the flames do not deserve our sympathy, daughter. They are nothing but sheep to the slaughter, and we are their rightful queens. [END LOG]",
