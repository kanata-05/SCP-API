A commercially produced bell muffler is to be placed into the interior of SCP-4551 when not in testing.\n\n\nContainment Update:\n In order to control rust build-up, SCP-4551 is to be cleaned with a 20% electrolytic solution of white vinegar mixed with salt, once per day and re-cleaned after testing. This process is to be performed inside SCP-4551's anechoic chamber.\n\n\nFurthermore, in order to prevent severe oxidation to occur on SCP-4551's surface, renaissance oil is to be doused daily. This oil is to be blessed by a member or decendent of Roseafar.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4551 is an ornate iron funeral bell, constructed during the late 1300s in Roseafar, Scotland. When SCP-4551 is rung, it produces a clear note in E\u266d3, which causes an illusion (SCP-4551-1) to appear to the ringer for a period of up to ten minutes.\n2\n\n\nSCP-4551-1 illusions appear to be incorporeal, partially-translucent figures with a physical appearance identical to a deceased individual whom the ringer had an interpersonal relationship with.\n\n\nThe following has been observed during interactions between a ringer and an SCP-4551-1 illusion:\n\n\n\n\nThe ringer maintains that the SCP-4551-1 illusion is the 'soul' of a deceased individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRingers report that the SCP-4551-1 illusions converse about past memories shared between the ringer and SCP-4551-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4551-1 illusions engage in endearing behavior such as giving compliments and easing doubts when emotionally 'close' to the ringer, and engage in negative\n3\n behavior when 'distant' to the ringer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn engraving of an SCP-4551-1 illusion, also from \nPrayer of Roseafar\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been observed that the time frame in which an SCP-4551-1 illusion persists for, is based upon the decibel rating that was produced. For more information, please see the table below.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4551-1\u00a0Decibel\u00a0Rating\u00a0and\u00a0SCP-4551-1\u00a0Time.\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note, the following decibel ratings are rounded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecibel rating during ringing:\n\n\nLength of time that an SCP-4551-1 illusion persisted for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<40\u00a0dB\n\n\nNo effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\u00a0dB\n\n\n4 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\u00a0dB\n\n\n6 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\u00a0dB\n\n\n8 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\u00a0dB\n\n\n10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>100\u00a0dB\n\n\nNo effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n Rust has been documented occurring on SCP-4551, with about 3\u00a0mm\n2\n of rust occuring daily, generally forming around the base of the bell. As of \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it has been discovered that when a human subject rings SCP-4551 while the object is rusted\n4\n, a cognitohazard occurs in which the memory of a deceased individual is completely forgotten by the ringer. For more information, please see addendum no. 3. It is currently unknown what will occur if SCP-4551 is rung while fully rusted.\n\n\nThe \nPrayer of Rosefar\n, a holy book from the region, describes SCP-4551's rust effect in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\nRust\u00a0and\u00a0Man'\u00a0Transcript.\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Text.\n\n\n\n\nHawk!

George Albert, SCP-4551 was considered to be a holy item, and was used to wish for harvests and to celebrate and revere dead members of the community. A special ceremony known as the '\nGost of God'\n was conducted to remove rust from SCP-4551, and to prevent deceased members from being forgotten by the population of the village. This ceremony required a dying member of the community to baptize the bell. A special song was sung during the ceremony, viewable as a transcript below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGost\u00a0Of\u00a0God'\u00a0Transcript.\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaen, caome send sae aend sell dead maen Shael liea, whean that comaes based and baerre, era have noathing wean we away faed, well tha t we cares foare is worams, Escaeot flat which we dka for God's sake, wea have naothing ready but God's Goetz and a latest memy.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost' sightings and reports of paranormal activity were frequent in the area surrounding Roseafar, with the local area using the sightings as a method to attract tourism to the region. These sightings had not been taken seriously until April 9th, 2005, when, during a mass offered in Edinburgh for the recently deceased Catholic Pope John Paul II, SCP-4551 was rung, triggering the appearance of 23 instances of SCP-4551-1. The presiding priest, Roseafar native Fr. George Albert, confessed to removing SCP-4551 and moving it to Edinburgh for this mass.\n\n\nFoundation agent Lilly Amarte confiscated SCP-4551 at the ceremony, and George Albert and the congregation were detained, and given class-A amnestics.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum No. 2: SCP-4551 Testing Log\n\n\nFive tests were conducted with SCP-4511, viewable below.\n\n\nCurrently, SCP-4551 summons SCP-4551-1 instances regardless of the ringer's place of birth.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4551\u00a0Test\u00a0Results.\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Test\u00a0Results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\nIdentity of SCP-4551-1\n\n\nDuration of manifestation (Minutes) .\n\n\nFirst words or activity performed by an SCP-4511-1 illusion.\n\n\nLast words spoken or activity performed by an SCP-4551-1 illusion.\n\n\nSummary of Interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 Welling.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Welling.

I never did, and you need to accept that. It isn't healthy to dwell on one person again and again. You did the same thing when we dated. You need to move on.\n\n\nSubject apologized for flaws in the relationship, and stated that he had always loved her. SCP-4551-1 illusion vanished shortly after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-5192\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Rouse.

D-1072's Father apologizes, with D-102 accepting, as both reconcile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum No. 3: Rust Test\n\n\nAs SCP-4551 produces a cognitohazardous effect when rung, testing has been been put forth to judge if SCP-4451 when rusted can act as a rudimentary amnestic. The following tests had been conducted by Dr. Amie Amarte and Dr. Lucy Daniels, tested on D-4515.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4451\u00a0Rust\u00a0Test.\n\n\n\n\nClose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4451- Rust Test Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 6/6/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nExperiment Lead:\n Dr. Amie Amarte, Dr. Lucy Daniels.\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-4551 (Rusted.)

That is all.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n SCP-4551 behaves as a rudimentary amnestic, able to produce an effect in which the ringer will completely forget the memory of the individual summoned during a rusted ringing of SCP-4551. Family members and those related are not affected. Currently, the only long term side effect is clinical depression, and periods of muteness.\n\n\n\n\nD-4515\u00a0Follow-Up\u00a0Interview.\n\n\n\n\nClose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-4515 Follow-Up Interview.\n\n\nDate:\n 1/28/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nExperiment Lead:\n Dr. Amie Amarte, Dr. Lucy Daniels.\n\n\nSubject:\n D-4515\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n1200 Hours\n \nD-4515 is brought into interview room 361, meeting with Dr. Daniels, and Dr. Amarte.\n\n\nDr. Daniels:\n Please be seated.

The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning\u2026 We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don't know just yet. I don't think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it\u2019s not as though there aren\u2019t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics\u2026 But is it //right\n? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man's memory from him. Imagine if the some old coot doctor done the same to me. If they made me forget her. Like I did with the man's mother. For now though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll put those feelings aside.

The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning\u2026 We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don't know just yet. I don't think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it\u2019s not as though there aren\u2019t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics\u2026 But is it //right ? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man's memory from him. Imagine if the some old coot doctor done the same to me. If they made me forget her. Like I did with the man's mother. For now though.",

        "Note : The following information and messages where written two years after the intital SCP-4551 interview and tests.",
        "Daniels, I'll cut the pleasantries. I want to see her again. I can't go on with my work, I keep thinking of her. You know, me and her, we've been married for almost 35 years. I'm old, Daniels, I'm old. We both know my time here is short. But before I leave, I want to say goodbye to her. I'm asking for permission to use SCP-4551. Just for a moment, please. I want to say goodbye for her. I never got the chance too, and quite frankly, neither did you. You know, she was from Rosefar, she found the damned thing. Its only appropriate, Daniels. Let this be the last thing I do here. Let my last moment be a happy one, please.",
        "I'll cut the pleasantries too, Amie. You've been a damn fine doctor here, and Lilly was a damn fine agent too. Both of you have been. Okay, okay, Amie, I'll do it with you. I can weasel my way out of this, don't worry. You're right, she deserves this as much as you do. Meet me at the lab tomorrow, before noon. I'll let Albert know. He is a priest, Amie. From Roseafar, like Lilly."
