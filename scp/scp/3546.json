As these items are non-anomalous, no further action is required.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3546 was Cherise Schultz, a 63-year-old widow previously residing in Cherry Hill, New Jersey (United States). Ms. Schultz reproduced works of art which were indistinguishable (physically, chemically, or otherwise) from their authentic counterparts. Until 2012, Ms. Schultz's works were regularly purchased by a \nprivate firm\n for use in high-profile instances of forgery, theft, and fraud.\n\n\nMs. Schultz produced these works from non-anomalous materials (typically acrylic paint), applying them in such a way that their arrangement and composition were anomalously transformed into a work identical to one which she had no prior knowledge of. She reproduced several hundred paintings, frescoes, and sculptures during her career; collectively, these works are estimated to have grossed profits in excess of several hundred million (US) dollars.\n\n\nMs. Schultz sold each work for fifty (US) dollars (excluding costs of shipping and handling).\n\n\nAddendum 3546.1:\n Initial Interview\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2012/07/21\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Cmdr.
