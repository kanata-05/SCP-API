Following incident 1486-8, a 55-meter spherical radius is to be demarcated around SCP-1486 as an area in which absolutely no copulation is to occur.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1486 is a children's doll, 48 centimeters in height. SCP-1486 is animate; however, due to its nature it is mostly immobile. SCP-1486 is highly damaged, and is missing its right arm. SCP-1486 will frequently exude human blood, feces, pus, and cervical mucus from small pores covering its torso and head. SCP-1486 is seemingly sapient.\n\n\nIf a fertile, human couple of opposite sexes completes copulation within ~50 meters of SCP-1486 (regardless of contraceptive use), SCP-1486 will disappear from where it has been placed and appear in the female subject's uterus at less than 0.01% of its original size\n1\n. SCP-1486 will then begin slowly increasing in size at the rate of a normal embryo and foetus\n2\n. Ultrasound testing of the subject has shown that SCP-1486 retains its shape throughout the growth process. Subjects may sustain damage to the uterine wall, causing infertility. Excretions from SCP-1486 will exit through the cervix.\n\n\nAfter a period of ~9 months, SCP-1486 will induce labor in the subject. SCP-1486 may be birthed normally. However, due to the presence of several harsh edges on its exterior, Caesarian sections have proven to be a much safer form of delivery.\n\n\nOnce it has been birthed, SCP-1486 will search for the subject mother and in some instances, SCP-1486 will attempt to breastfeed unless restrained. SCP-1486 can communicate verbally through unknown means, and will address the subject and others.\n\n\nAttempted abortion results in SCP-1486 rapidly expanding, causing the subject's abdomen to rupture. SCP-1486 will be immediately hostile.\n\n\nSCP-1486 was discovered by Foundation operatives following a complaint submitted by [REDACTED] after an ultrasound imaging session.\n\n\nAddendum 1486-1:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1486\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Fulnan\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-1486 had recently been birthed and was sitting with D-7397, its \"mother\", at the time of interview. D-7397 had been sedated and was unconscious.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Hello SCP-1486.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Hey doc, long time no see.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Indeed.\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n 9 months, if I had to guess (Laughs). How's it hanging?\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n It's fine. Mind if I ask a few questions?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Shoot.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Alright. Who or what made you?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Well doc, when a mommy and a daddy really love each other, or are really fucking drunk\u2026\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Please answer the question.\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n How do you think? My momma got laid and I happened to be the fastest sperm.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Alright. How did you become damaged?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Being born isn't fucking easy, you can get pretty torn up. I think I would know that better than anyone.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Okay. So this woman is your mother?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Yeah, this woman here's my momma. Might not be the best looker, but she's got the best tits I've ever seen.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n So you've seen tits before this?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n It's an expression, dumbass.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n But what about all the times you've been, er, born before this?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n You don't remember being born before this birth?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Well, yeah, of course I do.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Were the women those times not your mother?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n I thought they were, but they would scream and throw me away. How could they be my momma if they would do that?\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n They gave birth to you.\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Well, yeah, but I mean they hate me. How could a mother hate her own kid, doc? Enough to hurt them so much?\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Lots of mothers\u2026\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n It doesn't make any sense! How could they just throw me away? How could they just hammer it in like that?\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n Well, I mean\u2026\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n I just don't get it.\n\n\nDr. Fulnan:\n 1486?\n\n\nSCP-1486:\n Can we stop please?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Examination of SCP-1486 following the interview showed a severely increased excretion of cervical mucus from the area surrounding its eyes. SCP-1486 was separated from D-7397 and placed into storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Whether this effect is achieved through use of the same phenomena as observed in \nSCP-886\n, \nSCP-1263\n, \nSCP-1586\n, or a combination thereof is currently unknown.\n\n\n2\n. For financial and ethical concerns, testing regarding the subject body's acceptance and nourishment of SCP-1486 has not been performed.
