Access to a mobile device has been deemed acceptable by the containment team. Content posted by SCP-4831-1 is to be heavily monitored to prevent confidential information from being leaked. For more information on SCP-4831-1's needs, please see Document-315.\n\n\nThe house containing SCP-4831 has been secluded from the public. SCP-4831-1's family are not to be amnesticized.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4831 is the bathroom of a household within Wet Money, Kansas, US. SCP-4831's anomalous properties manifested on 25/4/2018, and the Foundation was made aware of its existence on 2/5/2018. Attempting to access the interior of SCP-4831 is physically impossible.\n\n\nThe door and window for SCP-4831 are locked, and all attempts at unlocking both have failed. The walls, door, floor, and window inside SCP-4831 are indestructible as well, and have resisted all attempts at dismantling. This includes the use of sharp tools, explosives, high amounts of heat, and corrosion.\n\n\nSCP-4831-1 is, at the time of writing, 17-year-old Tucker Miles who was inside of SCP-4831 when it gained its anomalous properties and is now trapped within. Besides this, SCP-4831-1 is physically non-anomalous. All attempts at freeing SCP-4831-1 have failed.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\nHousehold-531\u00a0Security\u00a0Footage:\u00a0#1\n\n\n\n\nOf\u00a0Reuben:\u00a0Elizur\u00a0the\u00a0son\u00a0of\u00a0Shedeur\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground:\n Footage was taken from security camera footage that overlooked SCP-4831's door.\n\n\nTime:\n 15:15\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-4831-1 is heard opening the front door, presumably returning from school.\n\n\nSCP-4831-1's mother is heard yelling from another room.\n\n\nMrs. Miles:\n Tucker, can you do me a favor?\n\n\nSCP-4831-1:\n What?\n\n\nMrs. Miles:\n Can you bring me the duct tape from the bathroom?\n\n\nSCP-4831-1:\n 'Kay, give me a sec.\n\n\nSCP-4831-1 is seen entering SCP-4831 to retrieve the duct tape. It is assumed that, while they are doing this, they are also using the restroom. After SCP-4831-1 closes the door, SCP-4831's anomalous properties activate.

Mrs. Miles: Look, Tucker, I\u2026 I know things haven't really been going well for you. Me and Dad haven't been treating each other in the best of ways recently. And I'm sorry. Tucker. I know you mean well. And, just\u2026 SCP-4831-1: I'm sorry too, Momma. That was really rude. I didn't know what I was thinking\u2026 Mrs. Miles: I understand that, I was your age too. It's just, I really want you to be happy, and\u2026 Mrs Miles begins to weep. Mrs. Miles: I haven't been doing a\u2026 real good job. SCP-4831-1: It's not your fault, Momma. None of this is. This isn't normal. None of this is. I love you Momma, I never want you to think otherwise. Mrs. Miles: I know, Tucker\u2026 Silence for over two minutes Mrs. Miles: So, uh\u2026 are you hungry? SCP-4831-1: A bit, yeah. Mrs. Miles: We looked around for food that we could slip under the door, and we found these MREs. They were used by soldiers and they are very flat. Turn on the light in there. A stream of light emits from underneath SCP-4831's door. Mrs. Miles takes out a standard Chili and Macaroni \"Meal, Ready-to-Eat\" and slides it underneath the door. Mrs. Miles: It's really easy, all you need to do to cook it is add water from the sink or something and wait a bit. SCP-4831-1: Ah, okay\u2026 Mrs. Miles: Okay, so, put the silver\u2026 uh\u2026 bag in with the heating element thing, then add some water. Don't go over the limit on the bag. A bathroom sink being turned on can be heard in the background. SCP-4831-1: Whoops, that's too much water\u2026 Mrs. Miles: It's fine, it'll still taste the same. Then seal the bag and wait a bit. SCP-4831-1: How long does it take? Mrs. Miles: About ten minutes, the website said. SCP-4831-1: Okay. Silence SCP-4831-1: So, Momma\u2026 Mrs. Miles: What? SCP-4831-1: I found the duct tape you wanted. Do you still need it? Mrs. Miles: No, Tucker, I al- SCP-4831-1: Here, hold on. SCP-4831-1 is heard attempting to forcefully push what is assumed to be the roll of duct tape underneath the door. Mrs. Miles: Tucker\u2026 SCP-4831-1: I can't even fucking give you the tape! Mrs. Miles: Please, calm down\u2026 SCP-4831-1: I can't, Momma. I just can't. I was so happy! I was so happy. I'm going to fucking die in this bathroom. I'm never going to see you again. I can't calm down! Get me out of here! I don't want to die in here! Mrs. Miles: Tucker, yelling at me isn't going to help anyone. SCP-4831-1: I\u2026 I just\u2026 I wanna hug you again. Mrs. Miles: Punkin\u2026 SCP-4831-1: I miss you. I love you. Mrs. Miles: It's okay, Punkin. I will stay by you until the day I die. Mrs. Miles presses her body and arms against the door and closes her eyes. Several minutes pass. Mrs. Miles: I\u2026 (sniff) think your food is ready. The sound of steam exiting a bag can be heard. Mrs. Miles: Do you need a fork? SCP-4831-1: Yes please\u2026 Mrs. Miles enters the kitchen, grabs a small plastic fork, and slides it underneath SCP-4831's door. Silence SCP-4831-1: It tastes horrible\u2026 [END LOG]",
