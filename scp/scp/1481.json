Site security is to remain on standby in proximity to tests conducted on SCP-1481.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1481 is a plastic recyclable coffee cup. SCP-1481 rests in an inactive state until it is physically rubbed by a sapient being. When SCP-1481 is rubbed, it will enter its active phase, in which it manifests a spectral humanoid hereby referred to as SCP-1481-1. SCP-1481-1 manifests dressed in multiple coats and torn jeans, all of which are likewise spectral but seem to nonetheless be stained with a variety of unknown substances. SCP-1481-1 has a nervous tic, which occurs every few minutes.\n\n\nOnce SCP-1481-1 has manifested, it will offer to grant an unlimited number of \"wishes\" to the individual who caused it to manifest; however, SCP-1481-1 is largely non-compliant with said wishes, and will often ignore them, wrongly claim to have already fulfilled them, or produce an outcome which bears only a slight resemblance to the one requested.\n\n\nSCP-1481-1 has made a variety of requests, which are typically for alcohol, recreational drugs, money, or warm food.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Tests were conducted by Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The goal of the tests was to establish a general knowledge of the capabilities of SCP-1481-1.\n\n\nLog of tests with SCP-1481:\n\n\n\n\nItem Requested:\n One sandwich\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-1481-1 manifested a sandwich, which it promptly ate.\n\n\nItem Requested:\n A winning lottery ticket\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-1481-1 manifested a losing lottery ticket.\n\n\nItem Requested:\n A 100-carat diamond.\n\n\nResult:\n 100\u00a0g of coal; SCP-1481-1 assured personnel that the coal was pure diamond.\n\n\nItem Requested:\n \"The meaning of life\"\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-1481-1 laughed hysterically for three minutes and fourteen seconds, then claimed to have forgotten what had just been requested. Subsequent requests for this item produced the same result.\n\n\nItem Requested:\n The means to achieve unlimited energy.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-1481-1 manifested one deviled egg, which it promptly ate.\n\n\n\n\nInterview log 1481-1-2\n\n\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hello, SCP-1481-1.\n\n\nSCP-1481-1:\n Hey there, young feller!\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n SCP-1481-1, I have some questions for you.\n\n\nSCP-1481-1 stares at the South wall of the interview chamber for six minutes and nine seconds before answering.\n\n\nSCP-1481-1:\n You ever notice how, how \nwhite\n this wall is? I f-f-feel like it's got so much \nmeaning\n.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n In relation to the items you are able to manifest, where do you take said items from?\n\n\nSCP-1481-1:\n I, I know a g-g-guy who, who, a guy who knows a guy.

C'mon, man, please?\n\n\nSCP-1481-1 was provided with 40 grams of methamphetamine, which it promptly consumed. Upon consuming the methamphetamine, SCP-1481-1 began to speak, and continued speaking for five hours and twenty-three minutes. Much of what SCP-1481-1 said during this time was incomprehensible 'word salad' interspersed with profanity, and a large quantity of what are assumed to have been logorrheic neologisms. A full transcript of this 'word salad' is available in Document 1481-RL51.
