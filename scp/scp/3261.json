SCP-3261-2 instances are only to be removed from the locker for testing purposes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3261-1 is a 17-stringed koto made from \nPaulownia tomentosa\n wood measuring 182 centimeters in length. The ry\u016bgaku is decorated with a floral pattern, while the ry\u016bzetsu depicts a small village and is engraved with the kanji \"\u6a3a\u5ca1\n1\n\". SCP-3261-2 is the collective designation for 12 pieces of sheet music for koto written in Yamada school notation.\n\n\nWhen an instance of SCP-3261-2 is viewed, the viewer will begin to search for SCP-3261-1. The degree of this compulsion varies depending on the instance viewed. Copies of SCP-3261-2 do not preserve this anomalous effect.\n\n\nWhen the viewer finds SCP-3261-1, they will begin to use it to play the SCP-3261-2 instance viewed. The SCP-3261-2 instance will be played within an error margin of 0.7%. If play is interrupted, the player will become distressed and attempt to resume by any means possible.\n\n\nThe player and all listeners will begin to perceive a scene dependent on the instance of SCP-3261-2 selected. The player and listeners can interact with people and objects within this scene, collectively designated as SCP-3261-3, although these objects are not visible to non-listeners. When SCP-3261-2 ends, the player and listeners will become unconscious for approximately 15 minutes. Selected SCP-3261-2 instances are listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nScene\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3261-2a\n\n\n\u6751\u4eba\u306e\u5b50\u5b88\u5504 (Villager's Lullaby)\n\n\nA small village with late Meiji era architecture at dusk. At the beginning of the third line, a man exits a house carrying a wooden bucket. The man collects water from a well in the center of the village. During the seventh line, he re-enters the house.\n\n\nThought to be the village depicted on the ry\u016bzetsu of SCP-3261-1. Lyrics are similar to a typical lullaby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3261-2c\n\n\n\u5c0f\u7460\u7483 (Siberian Blue Robins)\n\n\nTwo young boys watching a pair of Siberian blue robins in a cherry tree. The robins' vocalizations align with the rhythm of the song.\n\n\nSong consists of three stanzas, each of which is a tanka. Lyrics describe the robins in a manner typical of Japanese poetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3261-2d\n\n\n\u541b\u304c\u4ee3 (Kimigayo)\n\n\nThe coronation ceremony of Emperor Meiji. No deviations from the original event have been observed.\n\n\nSong was composed in 1880 and became the national anthem in 1888, although Meiji was coronated in 1868.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3261-2g\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nA village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a at noon. SCP-3261-3g1, a man in 1970s clothing, can be seen frantically searching for an unknown object.\n\n\nNo lyrics. See notes on SCP-3261-2a. Page is partially illegible due to water damage. SCP-3261-3g1 is thought to be searching for SCP-3261-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3261-2j\n\n\n\u79c1\u306e\u89aa\u611b\u306a\u308b\u5c0f\u6625\u5c02\u7528 (Dedicated to My Dear Koharu)\n\n\nA young couple walking through a village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a in the morning.\n\n\nLyrics are typical of modern love songs, although analysis of the paper and ink has determined it was composed in the early 1910s. SCP-3261-2j is the longest known instance of SCP-3261-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3261-01:\n SCP-3261-3j9, a man standing near the well in SCP-3261-2j, was interviewed by Researcher Hidekazu \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

In fact, I wouldn't even have ended up here if I had just stopped playing that damn koto, then and there. It was just laying there at that curios shop, with a few pieces of paper I couldn't even read. I bought it, played a song, and boom, I'm in some village.
