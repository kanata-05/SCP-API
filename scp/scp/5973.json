YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLASS C AMNESTIC TREATMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER O5-5973-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5973\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The Foundation is to maintain SCP-5973's exclusion zone during the recovery and clean-up phase. Non-Foundation emergency personnel within this zone are to be supervised; upon leaving, they are to be treated with appropriate amnestics.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: 05/11/21\n\n\nFollowing an emergency consultation with the Ethics Committee, the O5 Council has authorized the termination of any surviving sentient organisms found within the SCP-5973 exclusion zone (Executive Order O5-5973-1). Operatives suspected to have participated in the termination of survivors prior to the issuing of this Order will no longer face disciplinary action. Research Site-33's reactor ring is to be used as a temporary depository for organic remains until a larger storage vessel is acquired.\n\n\nA combined amnestic and misinformation campaign (Executive Order O5-5973-2) is to be enacted with immediate effect. A mandatory Class C amnestics drive, to which all Foundation personnel below the executive levels will be subjected, will be enforced over the coming weeks. We believe this is in the best interests of preserving the Foundation's reputation and its directives to Secure, Contain, and Protect.\n\n\nThe presence of such a large exclusion zone makes total prevention of media and public interest impossible; as such, Foundation operatives within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are to disseminate the story that an unprecedented seismic event has occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural and terrain damage in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Township, close to the north-western edge of the exclusion zone.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5973 is the designation for a spatial anomaly that occurred on 05/10/21 at Temporal and Extraspatial Research Site-33 in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ohio. Personnel had successfully propelled a single hydrogen atom to a speed believed faster-than-light.\n1\n The particle accelerator, an underground structure twenty-seven kilometres in diameter beneath \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 County, had been in use without fault for three years prior to the SCP-5973 event, though no tests prior to 05/10/21 had achieved an FTL effect.\n\n\nThe spatial anomaly occurred several milliseconds after the atom reached FTL speeds; it has been speculated that the atom lapped itself several times before a mechanical fault abruptly reduced its speed, causing it to collide with a previous iteration of itself which was subsequently knocked from its course.\n\n\nThe immediate effect of this collision was the duplication of all matter within the accelerator's perimeter (offset from its existing position by approximately 0.6 inches). Severe damage to manmade and organic structures within the 27-kilometre perimeter (including several towns) occurred in seconds. Winds of up to eleven on the Beaufort scale were recorded as far away as Wisconsin in the moments following SCP-5973; the cause of this event was the mass displacement of air.\n\n\nThe widespread loss of life caused by SCP-5973 is believed to have been largely instantaneous, with the majority expiring from crush and laceration injuries. The current human toll stands at approximately fourteen thousand.\n2\n Among those who expired were fifty-seven Foundation personnel, following the destruction of Site-33 infrastructure within the radius of the anomaly. As exploration and recovery is ongoing, the final toll is still pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a005/11/21\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a005/11/21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Manston, MTF \nMTF Alpha-4\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Ash Singh, Ethics Committee\n\n\nForeword:\n In the immediate aftermath of SCP-5973, eighty two-man response teams were sent into the affected area to assist with reconnaissance and recovery. Personnel had been drafted in from a variety of MTF squads in order to maximise operational capacity (hence the presence of \u201cPony Express\u201d operatives).\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Manston:\n Look, I don\u2019t want a grilling. I want some Class C. I wanna forget this whole fucking thing, but you\u2019ve had me sitting in here for-\n\n\nDr Singh:\n I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. How about I just\u2026 let you talk. Tell me what you found yesterday, you and Agent Dunnings. I\u2019ll be recording.\n\n\nAgent Manston:\n Fine, whatever. It was a fucking mess, that\u2019s what it was. We\u2019re Pony Express, for God\u2019s sake. One minute we\u2019re in Dayton, snooping around some USPS office \u2018cause a worker thinks she found a \u201cstamp that moved\u201d. Next thing you know we get a call that every agent in the state\u2019s been mobilized, pronto. Something big. They sent a Chinook down to get us, and next thing I know we\u2019re heading into a disaster zone.\n\n\nThey had us, me and Dunnings\u2026 Christ, it was a middle school, or it used to be. On a Monday morning. I knew it was gonna be bad wherever we dropped, but that\u2026 oh, God. What I\u2019ll remember the most, though, or maybe what I, y\u2019know, latched onto instead of all those poor people, it was the silence. Other than the choppers in the distance, it was dead quiet. That\u2019s when we heard the\u2026 gunshot.\n\n\nSo we went across the yard, across the street, and there was this Wendy\u2019s. Mind you, we weren\u2019t supposed to enter any place we hadn\u2019t been assigned, what with practically everything being \u201cstructurally unsound\u201d. But we went over to this Wendy\u2019s where we heard the shot coming from. Just like the school, it was full of\u2026 I\u2019m gonna be real, most of those poor bastards you could barely say were \u201cbodies\u201d anymore. Hideously deformed\u2026 dismembered. Bits and pieces of people everywhere. Only I went in, at first, went behind the counter. You know, where they cook the food. And this one girl\u2026 I think it was a girl\u2026 she was bleeding. Not in the same way the others had bled\u2026 she\u2019d been shot, right through what was left of her, of her\u2026\n\n\nDr Singh:\n It\u2019s okay, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Take your time.\n\n\nAgent Manston:\n Anyway, she was warm. Like she\u2019d been alive a bit longer than the others. Wouldn\u2019t wish it on my own worst enemy, to survive a disaster like that. But that bullet had gone right through, and the way it was flayed, I knew it was Foundation issue. I called Dunnings inside, and you know what he said to me? Straight away, \u201cthat\u2019s a mercy kill.\u201d Can\u2019t say either of us blame whoever did it.\n\n\nAnd in the bathroom, what was left of it, that\u2019s where I found\u2026 Agents Parker and Carruth. Pony Express like me and Dunnings. We\u2019re an MTF, but we\u2019re not soldiers, doctor. None of us, let alone them, were prepared for\u2026 this. Parker and Carruth, in full tactical gear, slumped in a stall. They\u2019d removed their breathing apparatus, and set off a single can of amnestics. Parker\u2019s gun, I checked, it was still hot.\n\n\nDr Singh:\n I\u2019d like to deeply apologise on the behalf of the Foundation, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The Ethics Committee are devoted-\n\n\nAgent Manston:\n My ass you are. You didn\u2019t stop them testing that great big fucking collider or whatever. Who was that \"protecting\"? It\u2019s an affront, doctor, to everything this Foundation purports to represent.\n\n\nDr Singh:\n The administration are hugely embarrassed by this disaster, Agent Manston. Besides, Site-33 had a purpose. We hoped the accelerator would help us better understand the mechanics of \nspace-time anomalies-\n\n\nAgent Manston:\n We\u2019re done here, doctor. I\u2019ll take the Class C, then get me out of here.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Agent Manston\u2019s testimony formed the basis of Executive Orders O5-5973-1 and O5-5973-2. The Ethics Committee and O5 Council came to the joint conclusion that maximum suppression of SCP-5973, and its associated events and aftermath, is the most effective way to preserve the Foundation\u2019s integrity, reputation, and internal morale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-1:\u00a005/11/21\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum-1:\u00a005/11/21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal memo from the Administrator to O5 Command\n\n\nThe Administrator:\n I\u2019ve just had Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on the phone.
