It's been\u2026 a weird transition \u2014 going from a typical day outside to being moved inside here. Not a lot has changed since the merge. Well, except for this fancy console with all of these weird switches and dials that I was given.\n\n\nSubordinates continue to act as if nothing happened. Well, frankly nothing \ndid\n happen\u2026 they're all just copies. Fakes. The real ones are probably out doing their own thing, or living in their own little worlds. I was lucky when they granted me an opportunity to try and fix Site-148 \u2014 usually they would just stop funding a poorly operating Site and people would transfer out.\n\n\nInstead they run about their day here completing their daily responsibilities like normal. I'm not sure how to feel about it, really; I don't think they'd even believe me if I told them the truth now. Against the programming and whatnot.\n\n\nI've been asked to keep this relatively updated as time goes on. I was warned that certain aspects of this sandbox might\u2026 change\u2026 after awhile. Frankly I wish they would've elaborated on that a bit more, but we'll be ready regardless.\n\n\nUntil next time, then.

Inside numerous Foundation personnel can be seen exercising, resting near benches and patio tables, or engaging with others. Most remain expressionless, however some appear to smile slightly. Whispering and murmuring can be heard as the camera pans throughout the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$caption}\n\n\n\n\nThe recording then moves into the hallways through Site-148. There is notably less traffic than before. More personnel can be seen entering or staying within their offices, doing miscellaneous work. Several anomalies can likewise be seen throughout the premise, mostly awaiting processing before their containment commences.\n\n\nAnother sweep of the premises commences before camera pans out to the external environment. It is approaching sunset. On the streets outside, simulacra stroll throughout. None detect the camera as it continues to navigate through crowds.\n\n\nOne simulacrum briefly clips through an restaurant building before returning to normal.

REYES\n\n\n\n\nWhen I took this position I was provided with a very simple description: \"Help them improve and we'll help you improve.\" And that made sense \u2014 I'd monitor the situation here and once it was over, things would go back to normal. I'd return to my Site, and my office, and my family, and that would be the end of that.\n\n\nExcept it's not just that. Of course it's never just that with these people, huh?\n\n\nNo, instead they start changing things in the background and don't inform me about it until the situations escalate outside. Of course, \nthey\n don't have to worry about it. They're not the ones dealing with the sudden change management requests or the increasing accidents.\n\n\nNo, that falls onto me to fix.\n\n\nI can't be too upset, I guess. It's not like anything has been detrimental to our work. I just wish there was some more transparency. Is this a test? Are we being penalized for something? I know our Site wasn't the best kept place in the world but\u2026 ah, what the hell. Things are still fine, people are mostly happy, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much.\n\n\nSpeaking of, they never told me that I'd be able to change the literal \nvariables\n of my personnel. It's weird to me that I can essentially do whatever I want with them \u2014 make them happy or mad, give them higher strength or more intelligence, the whole 9 yards. I've been too busy to try and test it out now but maybe that might come in handy here in the future.\n\n\nMaybe I could even edit myself sometime.

Were they hoping that somehow this would teach me to be a better leader? Is this console supposed to mean something more? They keep holding down the gas and not telling us why. What happens if we need to pull the brakes for a second? Or when our people start dropping? None of this lining up right in my head.\n\n\nBut I guess that's also sort of the point, right? They want this to be a challenge. A test, or maybe just so they can see what all's possible before things start heading south. Which, you know, is fine. Especially with this tool at my disposal.

Very little activity is recorded as the camera continues monitoring Site-148. One anomaly can be seen suspended in mid-air, hovering upside down within the cafeteria. Its figure distorts into geometric shapes intermittently.\n\n\nOutside, the nearby streets and buildings are likewise vacant. What few simulacra remain appear notably more aggressive and violent. In a local parking lot, a locked car is being emptied out by unknown assailants with masks. No further events occur throughout recording.\n\n\nCamera returns back to Site-148, but little occurs.

Especially when we're already so busy. Using this console was my only option, and probably my best one at that. Now everyone is ten times more focused, happy, and physically equipped to complete their duties. Some have even elected to remain stationed on-site 24/7 \u2014 sleeping for just a few hours a day in their little office cots.\n\n\nI can't blame them; it's been ridiculous trying to keep up. Again, and again, the operators outside make these bizarre and nonsensical changes. All the while not even having the balls to tell me about them beforehand, despite my NUMEROUS requests to be involved. Now it's just a constant battle of hopeless catch-up.\n\n\nI'm starting to believe these \nSIMULACRUM\n operators are just ghosting me for the fun of it. Because why not, right?\n\n\nWhile I'm complaining, I can't help but mention the weird system irregularities that keep happening. Lot of it's been visual stuff \u2014 things don't look like they're loading in properly, or sometimes the walls and ceilings of my office don't always seem right. I had someone yesterday come up to me and report that simulacra outside are beginning to spawn without limbs or faces.

Said he wanted to chat about some issues he's been having with containment drafts. And everything was fine until the flesh across his face inverted.
