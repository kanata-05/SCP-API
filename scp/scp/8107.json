Dr Kingston is to maintain possession of the key to the locker.\n\n\nResearchers must submit a written proposal for approval to Dr Kingston if they wish to test an unused bag. A verbal request is sufficient for testing with a pre-used bag, though destruction of any bag may result in loss of testing privileges.\n\n\nAs all the bags detached from the stack and used for testing (SCP-8107-2) are presumed to have the same anomalous effects as the unused bags (SCP-8107-1), further separation of unused bags is prohibited unless and until all used bags have been destroyed in the course of legitimate tests.\n\n\nInvestigation is to continue of Dollar General franchises across the country for any corresponding anomalous events, items, or persons.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8107 consists of a total of 198 \u2018T-Shirt\u2019 style plastic shopping bags inside a cardboard box, 92 unused and still attached together in the standard fashion (SCP 8107-1) and 6 of them used in testing (SCP 8107-2). The markings on the cardboard box are typical for the boxes that shopping bags are shipped in, indicating an initial amount of 1,000 bags. The used bags have been flattened and replaced in the box for convenience. The bags are thin white plastic, identical visibly and materially to any other non-anomalous shopping bag. The printed slogan on each bag says \nVALUE MAX!!!\n in red letters, although the box was recovered from a Dollar General discount store. Efforts to locate additional bags are ongoing.\n\n\nThe box has no anomalous properties. The bags are reusable but no more durable than any other plastic bag, and the anomalous effect stops as soon as the body of the bag is ripped. Ripping the handles does not affect the anomaly itself but does make it slightly more difficult to activate.\n\n\nAny item placed into the bag, then enclosed by compressing the top of the bag, either through twisting or squeezing, is immediately replaced with a significantly cheaper though semiotically similar item. If the replaced item is then enclosed again, the next replacement will be even more degraded in value, and items that are enclosed a third time are replaced with a crude and worthless approximation with no cash value whatsoever.\n\n\nThe chain terminates there: the anomaly removes but does not replace items with no cash\n1\n value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\n\nBlack office stapler.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nEight paperclips, tangled together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\n\nPaperclips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Note\n\n\nThe bag ripped around the paperclips as it was closed.
