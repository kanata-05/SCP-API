Civilians who have encountered an instance of SCP-7786-A should be administered Class A or B Amnestics, depending on the circumstances.\n\n\nThe Foundation will collaborate with the German Government to institute a restricted zone encompassing a two-kilometer radius around Brocken Mountain, designated as Area-122. This containment procedure will be enforced throughout the month of April, effectively prohibiting civilian access to the mountain during this period. Concurrently, MTF-Omicron-50 and all armed security teams in the area are mandated to promptly neutralize any encountered instances of SCP-7786-A.\n\n\nGiven the predatory disposition of SCP-7786-A entities, Foundation personnel are required to maintain teams comprising a minimum of two individuals when traversing the vicinity of the mountain.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-7786 is an extradimensional space situated near Brocken Mountain in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The entryway to SCP-7786, designated as \"Entry Point Alpha,\" is positioned along the southern path that leads to the mountaintop.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7786 location, and Area-122 extension (Click to Enlarge).\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7786 can be accessed only through the execution of a set of magical rituals, which grant the performer(s) the capability to ingress and egress on a single occasion for each completed ritual. (See Addendum-7786-02 for details.)\n\n\nThe internal topographical layout of SCP-7786 is an intricate reconstruction mirroring Brocken Mountain, encompassing its structures and the adjacent environment, including a replica of the buildings that can be found on the mountaintop. However, the sky within SCP-7786 always appears crimson red, accompanied by a thick red mist, and the buildings exhibit observable structural decay and erosion. [REDACTED] is located at the center of the mountaintop. With the exception of instances of SCP-7786-A and SCP-7786-B, SCP-7786 is entirely devoid of any other form of fauna.\n\n\nSCP-7786-A designates a group of an unknown number of hostile humanoid entities. All instances of SCP-7786-A exhibit congruent physical attributes, including a stature measuring 2 meters in height with reduced muscular mass; a cranium resembling that of domestic goats, adorned with dense black fur enveloping the entire body; hind limbs similar to those of ungulates; upper limbs ending in five-fingered hands similar to those of humans; and a pair of feathered wings, each extending to a span of three meters.\n\n\n\n\nAn image taken from inside SCP-7786 (Click to Enlarge).\n\n\n\n\nWhile instances of SCP-7786-A ordinarily remain within SCP-7786 for the majority of the year, their activity outside of SCP-7786 will extend throughout April, allowing them to enter and exit from SCP-7786. When outside of SCP-7786, each SCP-7786-A entity initiates solitary nocturnal predation, focusing primarily on mammals and lone humans. When selecting its prey, designated as 'The Target', SCP-7786-A meticulously tracks the target, biding its time for an optimal ambush opportunity. SCP-7786-A will then proceed to attack and kill its target, concentrating on disabling critical organs. Following incapacitation, SCP-7786-A transports the remains of the target to SCP-7786, partially consuming and storing the residual parts, \nfor an unknown purpose\n.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-7786-A are not impervious to harm and can be neutralized with conventional weaponry. Observations indicate that after the demise of an SCP-7786-A entity, the organism's remains spontaneously combust through an unknown process, culminating in the total incineration of the entire body within a matter of seconds.\n\n\nSCP-7786-B designates a group of human individuals, all identified as white caucasian females, with ages ranging between 20 and 80 years old. Presently, instances of SCP-7786-B are believed to possess normal human genetics. However, continual monitoring of their conduct has ascertained their ability to use \"magic\" via incantations and ritualistic practices.\n\n\nIn contrast to SCP-7786-A entities dwelling within SCP-7786 permanently, instances of SCP-7786-B become observable within SCP-7786 only during the Hexennacht events, spanning from the 30th of April until the sunrise of the 1st of May. During this event, instances of SCP-7786-B congregate atop the mountain within SCP-7786 and engage in what appear to be religious ceremonies linked to the Sarkic cult. Hitherto observed activities encompass orgiastic rituals\n1\n, sacrificial rites, and the consumption of unspecified meat varieties, attributed to the targets of SCP-7786-A.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7786-01:\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Department\u00a0Of\u00a0Mythology\u00a0And\u00a0Folkloristics\u00a0report\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDie Hexennacht.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistic representation of the Hexennacht event dates back to 1829 AD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHexennacht, or \"Witches' Night\" in English, is a legend primarily associated with German folklore. The legend speaks of witches gathering each year on the night of April 30th at the peak of Brocken, the highest mountain in the Harz range. The main purpose of this gathering seems to be to hold a celebration marking the transition from winter to spring.\n\n\nThe earliest known mention of the legend dates back to the 15th century, although research has found references to similar phenomena as early as the 8th century. It is worth noting that during this same period, Brocken Mountain became associated with mysterious phenomena due to its height and atmospheric conditions. This mountain was home to Saxon tribes known for practicing pagan rituals, which were later linked to witchcraft by Christian missionaries. In 1589, a significant witch trial took place where 133 women were accused of participating in what is known as the \"Witches' Sabbath\" on Brocken Mountain, leading to the burning of all but four of them.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that this phenomenon coincides with the celebration of \"Walpurgisnacht,\" which is observed in several regions of Central and Northern Europe. The celebration primarily commemorates Saint Walpurga, who was an abbess in Francia.\n\n\nAlthough she is highly praised by Christians in Germany for her role in combating epidemics and witchcraft, The Foundation sources suggest that Saint Walpurga was associated with mysterious groups linked to occultism and astrology. There aren't many details about her connection to these groups, but considering her stance against practitioners of black magic, it is believed that these groups might have been working toward the same goal as her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation was alerted to the anomaly following the reception of a report from the Group of Interest \n'Mages Academy'\n on March 27, 2002. It appears that the Academy had been monitoring SCP-7786 activity for some time but required a governmental cover, which the Foundation could provide to deal with the anomaly given the fact that Brocken Mountain is a well-known tourist destination. Neutralization was not an available option at the moment.\n\n\nHowever, the Academy stipulated that the Foundation must provide regular updates regarding the containment status of SCP-7786. In exchange, the Academy committed to supplying the Foundation with pertinent information and resources conducive to containment.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7786-02:\n\n\nTo initiate the location of the SCP-7786 entry point, a tracking device was surgically implanted beneath the skin of one of the SCP-7786-A instances that was successfully captured by security personnel. This instance, designated SCP-7786-A-012, was subsequently reintroduced into the wild to track its destination. Approximately two hours post-release, the signal from the tracking device was lost in proximity to the eastern pass situated at the mountain base. Concurrently, a significant reduction in hume levels, reaching 11.03%, was observed in the area. This data substantiated the hypothesis of a multidimensional portal's existence at the aforementioned location.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Additional\u00a0attached\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\nTo access SCP-7786 it was suggested to use a Latin rite from a copy of \"Passing Through Perspective 101\" held by the Academy. Next is a copy of Document 12-C page 38 taken from the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing Through perspective 101, folder C-12.\n\n\n\n\nThe mirror worlds are natural formations that intersect our world and serve as exact replicas of the locations they intersect with. These dimensions may arise naturally due to energy disturbances, as mentioned previously, which may cause distortions to the internal environment of the dimension, depending on the amount of energy produced.\n\n\nAlternatively, a mirror dimension can be created artificially by using a magician's manna\n2\n energy. However, the creation of a mirror dimension may require the presence of many people to contribute their energy, whether or not they are directly involved in the process.\n\n\nHow do I enter one of them?:\n To access a mirror dimension, you must first find the entrance. Mirror dimensions may have various entrances. Once you locate one of the entrances, follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Draw the symbol depicted in the image below at the location of the entrance.\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a path of salt in front of the circle, leading toward the entrance. Then step into the circle while holding an unlit candle. Next, recite the following statement in Latin: \"Viam tenebrarum ambulo duce lucis.\" If your candle is lit, this indicates success.\n\n\n3. Now, proceed along the salt path. If you have completed all the steps correctly, you will find yourself entering the mirror world when you reach the end of the salt line.\n\n\n4. To exit, retrace your steps to find the path you came from; you will encounter the salt line. Walk along it in the opposite direction from your previous path, and you will return to your starting point when you reach the end of the line.\n\n\nWhat if the ritual fails?\n This suggests that you may have made one of the following mistakes:\n\n\n\n\nYou didn't draw the symbol correctly.\n\n\nYou misspelled the previous sentence.\n\n\nYou don't have a soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to test the efficacy of the rituals, D-9027 was instructed to perform the ritual and was equipped with a communication device and a live broadcast camera to evaluate the functionality of recording equipment inside SCP-7786. After completing the ritual, D-9027 gained entry to SCP-7786. Notably, the provided equipment remained operational, confirming that wireless communications were uninterrupted within SCP-7786.\n\n\nHowever, upon the subject's request to exit SCP-7786, D-9027 was suddenly attacked by one of the SCP-7786-A instances, causing the camera to fall to the ground adjacent to the subject. The camera feed displayed D-9027 falling on his back, attempting to resist the SCP-7786-A instance. But since D-9027 had not been equipped with any self-defense weapons at the time SCP-7786-A was able to terminate the subject, fatally wounding D-9027 by lacerating his throat.\n\n\nSubsequent footage captures the SCP-7786-A instance dragging the body of D-9027 out of the camera's sight. The camera continued to broadcast for seven hours until its battery was depleted.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7786-03:\n\n\nDuring the same month, two teams of trained Class D personnel were deployed to SCP-7786 to install live surveillance cameras. The first team, consisting of D-06457 and D-03456, sent on 04/2/2002, succeeded in installing two out of the seven planned cameras inside SCP-7786. However, D-03456 was killed after an encounter with two instances of SCP-7786-A, and contact with D-06457 was lost as he attempted to return to entry point alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA representation of the path followed by D-02333 and D-05852, as well as the location and range of the surveillance cameras within SCP-7786\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second team, consisting of D-02333 and D-05852, successfully installed the remaining surveillance cameras inside SCP-7786 and returned with significant injuries. For detailed information, refer to Site-122 Archive, Exploration Logs section E-05, document 7786-09766-D-002.\n\n\nThe internal environment of SCP-7786 is currently under continuous surveillance for research and security purposes, with a focus on the Hexennacht event. The primary location for SCP-7786-A instances to conduct their ceremonial event is situated atop the mountain, covered by Camera C-4.\n\n\nAny deviation from the normal behavior of the subjects must be reported directly to the Director of Research for consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nThe remainder of this file is monitored and it is Level 4/7786 classified\n\n\nUnauthorized entry will be responded to by a disciplinary review and the possibility of demotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Enter\u00a0your\u00a0security\u00a0identification\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision:\n 7786.02\n\n\nEntry date:\n 04 May 2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7786-\u03a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nketer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\njuggernaut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\namida\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ncritical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\n\nThe present research, conducted in conjunction with the SCP Foundation Department Of Mythology And Folkloristics, and the Mages Academy, is dedicated to the development of an effective method for the neutralization or permanent containment of SCP-7786-\u03a9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Omicron-50 badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Mobile Task Force MTF-Omicron-50 (codenamed \"Mountain Monks\"), has been commissioned with the implementation of \"Procedure Walpurga-301\" to forestall any breach of SCP-7786-\u03a9's containment (refer to Addendum-7786-05 for the procedure details). Additionally, five inactive Scranton Reality Anchors have been positioned in the vicinity of Brocken Mountain. It should not be activated unless a containment failure is reported.\n\n\nIn the event of a containment breach, immediate notification of O5 Command is imperative, prompting the declaration of an XK-Class emergency and a Level 5 containment breach, with the activation of the anchors encircling the mountain as a last resort measure.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-7786-\u03a9 is the designation given to a multi-dimensional demonic entity, contained by an unknown means within a cavity connected to a crater as its entrance is located at the center of the mountaintop within inside the SCP-7786 pocket dimension. The diameter of the crater that leads to the cavity is approximately 20 meters, but the cavity's internal dimensions are still unknown. Flames at a constant temperature of 5,000 Kelvin are being continuously emitted out of the cavity through an unknown process. Remarkably, these flames appear to have no effect on SCP-7786\u2019s internal temperature. The Foundation's became aware of SCP-7786-\u03a9's existence on 01/05/2002 (See Addendum-7786-04 and the Incident Report).\n\n\nMost of the data concerning SCP-7786-\u03a9 has been gathered from historical manuscripts related to several Germanic tribes, which consistently refer to SCP-7786-\u03a9 as \"Wotan.\" While comprehensive information on SCP-7786-\u03a9's origin, physical attributes, and full anomalous capabilities remains limited, analysis suggests that SCP-7786-\u03a9's entry into our reality will trigger an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. This conclusion is supported by SCP-7786-\u03a9's apparent hostility towards all human life, along with the violent and gruesome nature of events associated with SCP-7786-B.\n\n\nIt is currently believed that SCP-7786-\u03a9 remains in a dormant state when left undisturbed. However, it has come to light that instances of SCP-7786-B are actively attempting to incite its activity (See Addendum-7786-04). This presents an ongoing threat to the potential of a containment breach, necessitating research into effective containment protocols for SCP-7786-\u03a9.\n\n\nPreviously, a proposal was put forth to station Scranton Reality Anchors around Mountain Brocken and activate them to restore Hume levels in the vicinity to their standard range. Theoretically, this action would lead to the permanent separation of SCP-7786 from our dimension. However, the project was rejected due to the potential risks of inadvertent merging of dimensions or reality distortion within the area. Instead, it has been reserved as a last line of defense to be employed in the event of a breach.\n\n\n\n\nDocument-7786-0989:\n The following documents have been collected from the memoirs of Priest Heinrich von Schrober, translated from German. It is believed to have been written sometime between 740 and 751 AD.\n\n\n\n\nToday, by the divine will of the Almighty, we have successfully purged yet another witch,\n [corrupted text] \nher soul from the clutches of sin and delivering our world from\n [corrupted text]. \nRegrettably, these sinister adherents persist in their wicked assaults. Peasants and their innocent animals remain prey to them. By nightfall, the eerie cackling of these witches reverberates\n [corrupted text] \nabodes, and our precious children vanish into the shadows. To compound our tribulations, the mountain trembles with increasing ferocity, leading us to ponder if\n [corrupted text] \nof the Lord's righteous retribution for our inability to expunge this pervasive evil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a few days past, I beseeched Saint Willibald, imploring for assistance, and in his grace, he did reply with a message.\n [corrupted text] \nsending unto us an English saint, though I remain uncertain whether the singular presence of such a noble soul shall suffice to alleviate our dire predicament. Our fervent attempts have thus far proven ineffective in combating the malevolent forces aligned\n [corrupted text] \nSatan. Yet, any form of aid, no matter how modest, is most earnestly welcomed in our unwavering resolve to stand against these\n [corrupted text].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Walpurga graced our town in\n [corrupted text], \nbefitting a saint. In our conversation, I candidly recounted the harrowing experiences we have endured: the sinister witches, the winged demons, and the looming\n [corrupted text] \nnear our village. To my surprise, she disclosed her intent to ascend the mountain, her singular journey unaccompanied by any other soul. In a moment of weakness, my curiosity overcame me, and I implored the saint to share her purpose on the mountain. I must humbly confess, my Lord, that I allowed my selfish inclinations to override my better judgment, inadvertently prying into her intentions. It was during this exchange that Saint Walpurga revealed the existence of a malevolent entity known as Wotan, an adversary of God, driven by boundless hatred and unrelenting fury. This malevolent force is purportedly the very source of the curse afflicting our land, heralding a dire future filled with destruction and pestilence. Recognizing the urgency of her mission, I promptly withdrew my inquiries, allowing Saint Walpurga to commence her ascent of the mountain. While I remain uncertain of the duration of her absence,\n [corrupted text] \nknowledge concerning Wotan now consumes my thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days have elapsed, and the Saints have yet to return to us. However, we have discerned a notable reduction in the onslaughts from\n [corrupted text], \nparticularly the little ones, since her revered arrival. The nature of her endeavors atop the mountain remains shrouded in mystery, but it is our fervent hope that her righteous deeds continue to bring relief to our beleaguered community. May the Almighty continue to bless her noble efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of Wotan has been a burdensome presence in my contemplations ever since the saint imparted\n [corrupted text]. \nAn insatiable desire to decipher the enigmas enveloping this malevolent being has consumed me, for reasons that remain elusive. In moments of frailty,\n [corrupted text] \nrevealing to my brethren\n [corrupted text]. \nYet, I held my tongue, adhering to the saint\u2019s explicit directive to uphold silence. The allure of this demonic entity exerts an inexplicable and formidable sway over my spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI find myself in a state of terror. Earlier that night, I had retired to my room for slumber. This is the last event I recall before awakening to find myself in the barn near Raymond\u2019s farm I was inscribing strange symbols onto\n [corrupted text] \nusing the blood\n [corrupted text] \nchicken, now torn asunder and lying near me. I have no recollection of how I arrived there, nor any memory of events preceding this. I fear I am falling prey to a malevolent demon. The thought of seeking aid fills me with trepidation, for I fear being branded a heretic, the dire consequence being the stake and fire. Perhaps this is the divine retribution I deserve. Upon the saint\u2019s return, I shall plead for her intercession. O Lord, I beseech Your divine intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full week\n [corrupted text] \nthe saint\u2019s departure, and her holy presence has yet to bless us anew. Throughout this period, our tranquil town has been spared the malevolence of witches and demons. The townsfolk find comfort in this respite, yet my soul is besieged by ceaseless torment. I cannot enter the hallowed grounds of the church without sensing the ominous presence of Wotan at my heels, his sinister whispers pervading my senses. He haunts my dreams, tempting me with promises of wealth and unholy power. A paralyzing dread grips my heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs dawn broke today, our awakening was rudely interrupted by the tremors that convulsed the mountain.\n [corrupted text] \nearthquake our village has ever endured. A collective exodus from our homes was prompted by this seismic upheaval, children's wails\n [corrupted text] \nfrantic chorus. Our animals too, vexed by the tremors, succumbed to irrational behavior. The instinct to flee gripped us, only to be thwarted by a crimson radiance emanating from the mountain's summit, its disappearance followed by an unsettling\n [corrupted text]. \nNo one among us dared to approach\n [corrupted text].\n\n\nFortuitously, Saint Walpurga returned to us later that afternoon, bearing evident signs of exhaustion, her cloak tattered and worn. Our collective plea for an account of her mission fell upon her ears.\n \nHowever, she offered only the assurance that the curse had been vanquished from\n [corrupted text], \nleaving us with her holy benediction as she departed\n \nback to the monastery of Heideheim am Hahnenkamm.\n\n\nWhile I regret the missed opportunity to seek her\n [corrupted text], \nit brings me solace to affirm that, from that day onward,\n [corrupted text] \nof Wotan no longer haunts my being. It seems that I may no longer have cause for concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7786-04:\n Incident Report 7786-\u03a9-0756-D.\n\n\nAt 19:42, the C-4 camera positioned inside SCP-7786 experienced a malfunction of unknown origin, which was shortly after capturing the anticipated movements of SCP-7786-B entities. This malfunction obstructed the recording on the monitors, thereby impeding the documentation of events at that time. Due to the significance of the area to be monitored, assumed to be the meeting point of SCP-7786-B instances, both D-7578 [male, 40 years old] and D-9688 [female, 35 years old] were dispatched to SCP-7786 to rectify the camera issue.\n\n\nThe subjects succeeded in reaching a location close to the C-4 camera. However, acknowledging the heightened risk of detection, both subjects opted to record the event using the cameras attached to their helmets. The dialogue has been translated from German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera points toward the large gathering of SCP-7786-B instances, up to 100 instances estimated.\n\n\nSome of the SCP-7786-B instances gather around long wooden tables and eat what appears to be a bunch of human limbs.\n\n\n(During the audit of the snapshots taken at a later time, it was noticed that most of the dishes, utensils, and cups were made of materials varying between precious stones like \nsapphires, diamonds and gold.\n)\n\n\nD-7578:\n Holy shit!\n\n\nD-9688:\n Shh, keep your voice down.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n D-7578, do you think you can get to the surveillance camera while they are distracted?\n\n\nD-7578:\n There is no way you will convince me to go near any of those things. Can't you see where the damn camera is? Why did you guys put it in an open place like that?\n\n\nD-9688:\n Hey, look at this!\n\n\nD-7578 raises his head to see what D-9688 is referring to.\n\n\nA 3-meter-tall humanoid male emerges from a nearby building. The entity possesses six disproportionate arms that appear to be surgically attached to its body.\n\n\n(It will be referred to as SCP-7786-B2.)\n\n\nSCP-7786-B2 walks to one of the wooden tables, collects the empty plates, and then returns inside the same building.\n\n\nD-7578:\n Well, I guess that was the waiter of this place.\n\n\nD-9688:\n Doctor, let us get out of here, we can't fix your camera.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n No, you two are instructed to stay there longer and keep recording. We need to get more footage of this event.\n\n\nD-7578:\n You can't be serious about that. I am getting out of here, and you can't stop me.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n D-7578, may I remind you that any disobedience to orders will result in termination upon your return.\n\n\nD-7578:\n fine.\n\n\nSubjects were instructed to stay inside SCP-7786 for more footage.\n\n\n(12 min of extraneous dialogue skipped.)\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-7786-B gather around the crater and form a circle, then begin to recite in an unknown language.\n\n\nD-7578:\n What the hell are they doing?\n\n\nThe crater begins to gradually increase in size, and after one minute, it has reached 70 meters in diameter.\n\n\nAn instance of SCP-7786-A flies over the hole and throws the mutilated carcass of a horse into it.\n\n\nWhat appears to be the shadow of a giant being appears inside the hole, and a roar is heard.\n\n\nD-9688:\n Well, maybe this is the right time-\n\n\nD-7578:\n Look out, behind you!\n\n\nAn instance of SCP-7786-B appears behind D-9688. D-7578 fires four shots at it.\n\n\nThe sound of gunfire causes the SCP-7786-B instances to disperse from their previous activity, and the crater gradually returns to its normal size.\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-7786-B and SCP-7786-A focus their attention on both subjects and attack them relentlessly. Gunshots don't seem to affect SCP-7786-B instances, and both subjects are captured.\n\n\nThrough the D-7578's helmet-mounted camera, an instance of SCP-7786-A can be seen chopping off the limbs of the subject using a machete and finishing with his head.\n\n\nD-7578:\n AAAAAHHHHG-\n\n\nThe body of the subject is thrown into the hole, and then the camera breaks down when it comes into contact with the fire.\n\n\nD-9688 is dragged by four instances of SCP-7786-B. The helmet-mounted camera of D-9688 falls facing the sky, and the recording continues for another five minutes while a scream from D-9688 can be discerned in the background.\n\n\nSCP-7786-B2 is shown looking at the camera before stomping on it, cutting the recording.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter losing contact with both Class D subjects, all security teams in Area-122 were put on high alert in case of any potential emergencies. Ten hours later, D-9688 was found near Entry Point Alpha and was apprehended by the stationed agents without showing any resistance. D-9688 was subsequently transported to the Joint Research Center of Area-122 for interrogation. During the transfer through Area-122, the group encountered Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a member of the onsite Mages Academy, on their way.\n\n\nThe following log is collected from nearby security surveillance camera footage of the event.

Why do you ask, anyway?\n\n\nD-9688 avoids making eye contact with Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Karl pulls a small red cube-shaped object from his pocket, and the object begins emitting a faint light as he slowly moves it closer to D-9688.\n\n\nAgent 1:\n Hey! What do you think you're doing with that?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Wait, I'm just trying to check on something\u2026 Maybe we should not-\n\n\nD-9688's eyes turn black, and she raises her still-cuffed hands toward Karl, generating a shockwave that pushes him several meters back. D-9688 breaks her cuffs.\n\n\nAgent 2:\n What in the hell!?\n\n\nAgent 2 raises his weapon towards, who in turn raises her right arm, producing several unremarkable black tendrils. The tendrils wrap around Agent 2 and forcefully hurl him against Agent 1, propelling both towards a nearby wall.\n\n\n<09:15>\n\n\nThe alarm is activated. All unarmed personnel have left the scene, and all security personnel at the site have been directed to respond to the emergency.\n\n\nKarl attempts to stand up after being thrown to the ground. D-9688 then shifts her attention towards him.\n\n\nD-9688:\n [unintelligible]\n\n\nD-9688 points her index finger of her left hand towards Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, then emits a burst of intense flame from her finger towards him.\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n (Fast) \nAperi magnum scutum tuum et protege me!\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 raises both arms in front of him, and a glowing magical circle that resembles a nonagram appears. The circle deflects the fire, preventing Karl from being harmed.\n\n\n<09:17>\n\n\nAdditional security personnel arrive behind D-9688 and begin firing at her. D-9688 is struck by several bullets, showing signs of pain, but the bullets fail to disable her.\n\n\nD-9688 extends more black tendrils from her right arm toward the security teams while continuing her previous action against Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. As the security personnel attempt to take cover, the tendrils successfully strike four individuals, penetrating their bodies and resulting in their termination.\n\n\nTwenty instances of SCP-7786-A are detected approaching from the sky, flying toward the remaining security teams who are now trying to engage them.\n\n\n<09:21>\n\n\nHenrik \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, another member of the Mages Academy arrives at the site.\n\n\nHenrik \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What the fuck is happening?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What does it look like is happening to you?

The ground beneath D-9688 begins to reshape itself, transforming into a human hand that grasps D-9688, while she tries to break free from the stone grip.\n\n\nHenrik \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What are you waiting for?

Henrik \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shows signs of pain without a clear cause.\n\n\n<09:26>\n\n\nKarl approaches D-9688 and strikes her on the forehead with the coin-shaped object, emitting smoke from the object before it merges with D-9688's skin, leaving a symbol similar to the object. D-9688 loses consciousness.\n\n\nSecurity personnel successfully neutralized all attacking instances of SCP-7786-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-9688 was successfully subdued by both Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Henrik \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and the remaining security teams proceeded to detain D-9688. The final incident report recorded 6 fatalities and 11 injuries, with damages estimated at $25,000 to the surrounding environment.\n\n\nD-9688 was later brought in for an interview under heavy security, with Karl summoned as an assistant Interviewer and to intervene in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Reinhard, Area-122.\n\n\nAssistant Interviewer:\n Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nInterviewee:\n D-9688.\n\n\nNote:\n The dialogue has been translated from German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Alright. We are ready to begin. D-9688, you\u2014\n\n\nD-9688:\n You better free me now, you lowly insect, because if you think these chains will bind me forever, then you are\u2014\n\n\n(D-9688 screams in pain)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Shut up. It is not polite to interrupt someone while they are speaking, and you better answer our questions, or this symbol on your forehead will burn even more.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Now, as I was saying, D-9688, you were arrested by our agents after you left SCP-7786, and when you arrived at the research site, it was confirmed that you possessed anomalous capabilities. Can you tell me how you acquired your powers?\n\n\nD-9688:\n Listen to me here, you pig. I am not your slave to call me with letters and numbers. I have a name you rather start calling me with.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n And that will be?\n\n\nD-9688:\n It's Seldra Varnelit.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Really? What if I told you that your name is [REDACTED], sentenced to death for premeditated murder during a robbery.\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Nah, doc, I can confirm that this girl is no more. The person we are talking to now is one of those ill-fated witches.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n And how is that possible?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I'll take a guess and say: a reincarnation ritual, am I right?\n\n\nD-9688:\n A witch hunter as I see. Fuck you.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n If you are this \"Seldra Varnelit,\" what prompted you to leave SCP-7786? And why did you not resist the arrest by our agents?\n\n\nD-9688:\n SCP\u2026 What.\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n His talking about the mirror world.\n\n\nD-9688:\n And why would I tell\u2014\n\n\n(D-9688 screams in pain)\n\n\nD-9688:\n \u2026 After you fools ruined my sister's ceremony, I decided to take that girl's body and go outside to see who the new inquisitors that are trying to stop us from releasing our lord from his prison. I planned to infiltrate and obtain information from within your ranks. I thought it would be simple enough. But I didn't expect that of all people there would be witch hunters right where I was hoping to go, and you know the rest.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Tell me more about that dimension.\n\n\nD-9688:\n What am I supposed to tell you? It's the place where we live after being kicked out of our lands. We retreated to the mountains and created a place to live, but it still seems like humans won't stop baiting our tails.\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Mountains? So, there is more out there?\n\n\nD-9688:\n Take a guess, Witch Hunter.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n A witch hunter. Why does she keep referring to you by that?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Because I am a witch hunter. Or you could say that I hunt black magic witches to be exact. Don't confuse sorcery with the magic we use in the academy.\n\n\n(D-9688 hits the table with her left hand)\n\n\nD-9688:\n You're all just a bunch of hypocrites! Your academy was using the same magic as us, and yet you were pardoned for being the church's loyal dogs while my people were chased, plundered, and burned just because we didn't believe in your worthless beliefs.\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I think it's normal when your beliefs are based on worshiping demons, eating children, and all sorts of disgusting fleshy things.\n\n\nD-9688:\n Fool, you made us like this. Wotan was a noble soul who showed bravery and gallantry in wars and sought to gain knowledge about this world's secrets, but thanks to the demonization by that accursed bastard Charlemagne, and that whore Walpurga, our lord was sealed and thrown into the depths of hell. As for us Saxons, we lived in peace with nature in these lands for centuries before you came and ruined everything for us. Now Wotan seeks revenge on those who corrupted him with darkness, and we are just fulfilling our lord's new desires.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n But the people you're talking about have been dead for centuries, and Europe has now moved on from all this stuff. There are no church-controlled governments and ordinary people no longer engage in witch-hunting or anything like that. People don&#39;t know any of this exists.\n\n\nD-9688:\n And what about them, (points to Karl) or your so-called Foundation, or the [REDACTED]? You are all but just the inquisition of the new age. Don't tell me that anything has changed or that you have moved on, not after everything that has befallen on us.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n How do you know about all of that? This information should only be available to\u2014\n\n\nD-9688:\n Thanks to the orange rats you keep sending us, we have been able to look into their memories. Memories don't die even if their owner did, and a person's knowledge is one of the gifts our lord has given us.\n3\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Speaking of the devil\u2026\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Literally.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n \u2026What will Wotan exactly do if he is to be summoned?\n\n\nD-9688:\n Destruction. Simply you dumb mortal, destruction will come. All your glass cities will collapse in on themselves, and the fires of his wrath will consume every inch of the human world. You, who call yourselves the first line of defense for humanity, will stand by and watch without being able to do anything to stop your destruction. Your civilizations will collapse, and you will be forced to flee and hide away just as you did to us and as you did to those before you. This is justi\u2014 FUCK!\n\n\n(D-9688 screams in pain)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I don't think so. You don't have any idea of what we are capable of, if your lord was sealed once, then we can seal him again back to the little hole.\n\n\n(D-9688 starts laughing hysterically)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What is so funny right now?\n\n\nD-9688:\n Hehe\u2026 And you also don't know what I am capable of\u2026\n\n\n(D-9688 pulls an unknown type of seed from her pants pocket.)\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Hey! Where did you get this from? The security personnel have already searched you for\u2014\n\n\n(D-9688 spits on the seed, causing the seed to grow and form a gametophyte that develops into a full plant at an abnormal speed.)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh fuck. Doc, get away!\n\n\n(D-9688 throws the plant on the ground, and within 20 seconds, the plant grows into a wooden humanoid-shaped entity, approximately 4 meters tall.)\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Shit, call security NOW!\n\n\nControl room via radio:\n Security is on the way.\n\n\n(As Dr. Reinhard flees out of the interrogation room, Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attempts to fend off the attacking humanoid entity while he slowly steps back, trying to reach the door outside. The entity follows them to the corridor outside.)\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n What the hell is that thing?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n A wooden golem, it's been a long time since I've seen one.\n\n\nDr. Reinhard:\n Didn't you say that she won't be able to use her magic?\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That's not her magic, that is a magical item, you don't need to be a wizard to use these.\n\n\n(Surveillance footage from the interrogation room shows D-9688 pulling two black feathers from her pocket. The feathers spontaneously ignite, and D-9688 throws them into the air. Each feather generates a large flame for a few seconds, resulting in the appearance of two instances of SCP-7786-A. One instance attempts to break D-9688's restraints by biting them, while the other licks her forehead, gradually erasing the symbol on her forehead.)\n\n\n(Security teams arrive at the site and begin to engage with the entity. Although the bullets cause visible damage, the entity remains largely unaffected and continues to obstruct security personnel from accessing the interrogation room.)\n\n\n(The SCP-7786-A instance succeeds in freeing D-9688, and her severed right arm begins to regenerate.)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No! Don't let her escape!\n\n\n(Security personnel deploy fragmentation grenades against the entity, resulting in partial destruction and impairment of its movement, but the entity remains unneutralized.)\n\n\n(D-9688 proceeds to the northern wall leading to the outside and places her both hands on it, causing the wall to instantaneously dissolve and collapse.)\n\n\n(Karl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 generates a blue magical circle beneath the entity.)\n\n\nKarl \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \nARDE!\n\n\n(The magical circle emits a blue cylindrical flame wave that ascends vertically, causing an explosion that burns the entity and creates a hole in the corridor ceiling.)\n\n\n(D-9688 emerges through the gap she created in the wall. Nearby surveillance cameras capture D-9688 flying at high speed towards Brocken Mountain.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing report:\n D-9688 has not been found since her last sighting during the incident. While it is speculated that she may be inside SCP-7786, her current location remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\nAfter sharing the recovered data with the Mages Academy, their research team recommended the utilization of a counter-ritual to temporarily nullify the magic produced by SCP-7786-B during every Hexenacht event. These rituals are presumed to be similar to those practiced from the eighth century. This initiative has been designated as \"Procedure Walpurga-301\" (refer to Addendum-7786-05 for detailed information).\n\n\nAddendum-7786-05:\n\n\n\n\nPROCEDURE WALPURGA-301.\n\n\nThe procedure was prepared by the joint research team with the Mages Academy, the mobile task force personnel \u201cOmicron-50 (Mountain Monks)\u201d will implement the procedure annually until more effective containment procedures for SCP-7786-\u03a9 are developed.\n\n\nPart of the procedure hinges on the collective perception of human consciousness, wherein the participants are believers in an unseen manner, uncertain that the rituals are indeed capable of expelling witches and evil spirits. This necessitates that as many individuals as possible bear witness to the procedure, thereby requiring civilian intervention, all the while keeping the main cover story.\n\n\n\n\nThe staff who are aware of the procedure should realize that this is not a containment method; it is a distraction so that we can find a better solution. The procedure does not stop SCP-7786-\u03a9 directly; it hinders witches from summoning SCP-7786-\u03a9 to our world. If we miss one day, it could mean the end for us.\n\n\nWe have been allowed to act, and we must take advantage of it.\n\n\u2014 \nDr. Faust\n\n\n\n\nState:\n \n[Active]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the implementation of procedure Walpurga-301 on 04/30/2003 \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n Cultural institutions shall serve as a fa\u00e7ade for the SCP Foundation, facilitating the promotion of a cultural festival associated with \"Walpurgisnacht\" within the towns scattered across the province of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\n\nVarious methods, such as offering gifts, food, and even the employment of cognitohazards, may be employed to encourage the attendance of as many civilians as possible.\n\n\n2.\n On the night of April 30, coinciding with the \"Hexennacht Event,\" a fire shall be ignited using logs, each one inscribed with a distinct set of pre-identified prayers.\n\n\n3.\n A single Class D individual will be equipped with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 to render them imperceptible to the general public while executing the remaining rituals.\n\n\n4.\n The designated subject will puncture an adult goat directly in the heart using a knife until it expires while also chanting in Latin: \"O Magne Wotane, anima huius animals villas et acquiesce ab ira tua, quaeso, suscipe.\" Following this, they will extract the goat's heart and consume it.\n\n\nParticipant subjects have consistently reported that the extracted heart appeared black, despite confirming that the goat used in the ritual was in good health.\n\n\nIf the subject resists compliance with the procedure, all available means, including physical coercion, must be employed to ensure adherence.\n\n\n5.\n Upon the subject's successful consumption of the goat's heart, they must dispose of the remaining carcass into the fire and immediately leave the location.\n\n\n\n\nUp to this date, Protocol Walpurga-301 has proven to be effective in countering the rituals performed by SCP-7786-B entities, with no incidents regarding a containment failure occurring, and research into better methods for containing SCP-7786-\u03a9 is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7786-06:\n On 12/04/2\u2588\u2588\u2588, members of the mobile task force Omicron-50 successfully neutralized an instance designated as SCP-7786-A-052. After the body of the instance was burned, security personnel found a livestock identification tag in the burnt remains. The serial number of the tag was later confirmed to match one of the goat tags used in Procedure Walpurga-301 in 2\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Approximately two hours post-release, the signal from the tracking device was lost in proximity to the eastern pass situated at the mountain base.

        "Today, by the divine will of the Almighty, we have successfully purged yet another witch, [corrupted text] her soul from the clutches of sin and delivering our world from [corrupted text]. Regrettably, these sinister adherents persist in their wicked assaults. Peasants and their innocent animals remain prey to them. By nightfall, the eerie cackling of these witches reverberates [corrupted text] abodes, and our precious children vanish into the shadows. To compound our tribulations, the mountain trembles with increasing ferocity, leading us to ponder if [corrupted text] of the Lord's righteous retribution for our inability to expunge this pervasive evil.",
        "Only a few days past, I beseeched Saint Willibald, imploring for assistance, and in his grace, he did reply with a message. [corrupted text] sending unto us an English saint, though I remain uncertain whether the singular presence of such a noble soul shall suffice to alleviate our dire predicament. Our fervent attempts have thus far proven ineffective in combating the malevolent forces aligned [corrupted text] Satan. Yet, any form of aid, no matter how modest, is most earnestly welcomed in our unwavering resolve to stand against these [corrupted text].",
        "Saint Walpurga graced our town in [corrupted text], befitting a saint. In our conversation, I candidly recounted the harrowing experiences we have endured: the sinister witches, the winged demons, and the looming [corrupted text] near our village. To my surprise, she disclosed her intent to ascend the mountain, her singular journey unaccompanied by any other soul. In a moment of weakness, my curiosity overcame me, and I implored the saint to share her purpose on the mountain. I must humbly confess, my Lord, that I allowed my selfish inclinations to override my better judgment, inadvertently prying into her intentions. It was during this exchange that Saint Walpurga revealed the existence of a malevolent entity known as Wotan, an adversary of God, driven by boundless hatred and unrelenting fury. This malevolent force is purportedly the very source of the curse afflicting our land, heralding a dire future filled with destruction and pestilence. Recognizing the urgency of her mission, I promptly withdrew my inquiries, allowing Saint Walpurga to commence her ascent of the mountain. While I remain uncertain of the duration of her absence, [corrupted text] knowledge concerning Wotan now consumes my thoughts.",
        "Two days have elapsed, and the Saints have yet to return to us. However, we have discerned a notable reduction in the onslaughts from [corrupted text], particularly the little ones, since her revered arrival. The nature of her endeavors atop the mountain remains shrouded in mystery, but it is our fervent hope that her righteous deeds continue to bring relief to our beleaguered community. May the Almighty continue to bless her noble efforts.",
        "The name of Wotan has been a burdensome presence in my contemplations ever since the saint imparted [corrupted text]. An insatiable desire to decipher the enigmas enveloping this malevolent being has consumed me, for reasons that remain elusive. In moments of frailty, [corrupted text] revealing to my brethren [corrupted text]. Yet, I held my tongue, adhering to the saint\u2019s explicit directive to uphold silence. The allure of this demonic entity exerts an inexplicable and formidable sway over my spirit.",
        "I find myself in a state of terror. Earlier that night, I had retired to my room for slumber. This is the last event I recall before awakening to find myself in the barn near Raymond\u2019s farm I was inscribing strange symbols onto [corrupted text] using the blood [corrupted text] chicken, now torn asunder and lying near me. I have no recollection of how I arrived there, nor any memory of events preceding this. I fear I am falling prey to a malevolent demon. The thought of seeking aid fills me with trepidation, for I fear being branded a heretic, the dire consequence being the stake and fire. Perhaps this is the divine retribution I deserve. Upon the saint\u2019s return, I shall plead for her intercession. O Lord, I beseech Your divine intervention.",
        "A full week [corrupted text] the saint\u2019s departure, and her holy presence has yet to bless us anew. Throughout this period, our tranquil town has been spared the malevolence of witches and demons. The townsfolk find comfort in this respite, yet my soul is besieged by ceaseless torment. I cannot enter the hallowed grounds of the church without sensing the ominous presence of Wotan at my heels, his sinister whispers pervading my senses. He haunts my dreams, tempting me with promises of wealth and unholy power. A paralyzing dread grips my heart.",
        "As dawn broke today, our awakening was rudely interrupted by the tremors that convulsed the mountain. [corrupted text] earthquake our village has ever endured. A collective exodus from our homes was prompted by this seismic upheaval, children's wails [corrupted text] frantic chorus. Our animals too, vexed by the tremors, succumbed to irrational behavior. The instinct to flee gripped us, only to be thwarted by a crimson radiance emanating from the mountain's summit, its disappearance followed by an unsettling [corrupted text]. No one among us dared to approach [corrupted text]. Fortuitously, Saint Walpurga returned to us later that afternoon, bearing evident signs of exhaustion, her cloak tattered and worn. Our collective plea for an account of her mission fell upon her ears. However, she offered only the assurance that the curse had been vanquished from [corrupted text], leaving us with her holy benediction as she departed back to the monastery of Heideheim am Hahnenkamm. While I regret the missed opportunity to seek her [corrupted text], it brings me solace to affirm that, from that day onward, [corrupted text] of Wotan no longer haunts my being. It seems that I may no longer have cause for concern.",
