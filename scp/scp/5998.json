Humanity shall decide its own future.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation discovered SCP-5998 in 1961, after the Department of Tactical Theology had calculated the decreasing effectiveness of various religion-aligned containment procedures. Researchers theorized that an Iscariot Event (The death or cessation of a religiously significant figure) had occurred, and began reviewing global levels of akiva radiation.\n\n\nThe snow is cold. A familiar feeling.\n\nIn 1963, consistently high levels of ambient radiation around the North Pole drew suspicion, and concentrated searches of the area were undertaken, leading to the discovery of SCP-5998.\n\n\nIt feels beautiful\n\nThe following events have tentatively been proposed to have been affected by the 5998-Iscariot event.\n\n\n\n\nThe Quiet Revolution in Quebec, Canada.\n\n\nThe Communist Party of China's promotion of atheism (as a result of the Cultural Revolution).\n\n\nA renewed interest in German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's works, as well as the 'Death of God' philosophical movement in the 1960's.\n\n\nLaunch of \nVostok 1.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n In 1989, the corpse of a Caucasian male in his early forties was found buried in a snowbank approximately fifty metres from SCP-5998. Identification in his pocket confirmed him as a member of GOI-182 (\"\nla Spada di Cristo\n\"), a Vatican-affiliated Group of Interest.\n\n\ndying in the dark. You're living in the light. I did my duty.\n\nThe remnants of a crashed Piasecki H-21 Shawnee helicopter were found similarly buried a short distance away from SCP-5998. Analysis of the crash site concluded that the pilot had likely lost control of the aircraft after the fuel tank had exploded, though the cause of the explosion could not be determined.\n\n\nA number of items were recovered, in various states of damage.\n\n\n\n\nAn envelope with a letter enclosed, stamped by a seal. Illegible due to water damage.\n\n\nA gold cross on a chain. Warped by the heat of the crash.\n\n\nA personal calendar in Italian for the year of 1959. Ink damage is present extensively on most dates for the month of January, stopping at the 25th.\n2\n\n\nRemnants of a map, with ink damage present.\n\n\n\n\nA textual document was also recovered from the wreckage, and is available below in a translated form.\n\n\n\n\nTo whoever finds this, know what I did, I did with the heaviest of hearts.\n\n\n\n\nI grew up an orphan. I never knew my mother. My father had gone to serve Italy in the Great War as they were calling it, and never came back. I was one of many, in the overcrowded streets I called home.\n\n\n\n\nI most likely would've died in those streets, stealing food from the wrong shopkeeper or running afoul of the local mafia gangs, if I had not had the fortune of picking the pockets of a solider. Though I had not known it at the time, stealing from a Sword of Christ would turn out to be the greatest decision of my life.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time in my life, I had brothers. A home. Faith. The Lord gave me the greatest gifts I had ever known, and the possibility of salvation for a misspent youth. He gave me everything I never knew I needed, and asked for nothing in return.\n\n\n\n\nAnd what did I do to repay this unconditional kindness? I betrayed Him and everything I ever believed in. The Lord welcomed me into his arms, and I placed a dagger in his back.\n\n\n\n\nThe Holy Father insisted I would not burn for this act. That I would be venerated among my brothers as Saint Fillipo, a guardian of man's progress. But not even canonization can wash the blood from my hands.\n\n\n\n\nBury what you have found in here. Let me be forgotten, as He will be soon.\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Also known as Ophanim.\n\n\n2\n. Pope John XXIII announced the second Vatican Council on this date, which ultimately resulted in wide-spanning church reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5997\n | SCP-5998 | \nSCP-5999\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5998\n\" by Cerastes, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
