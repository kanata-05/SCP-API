More specifically, SCP-7076 targeted the attendees of secondary public institutions, though mainly being centered on high school seniors that are to graduate in the late spring and early summer of 2076.\n\n\nUpon its creation, SCP-7076 was strictly theoretical in its actual influence on the public, proposed as a possible encroaching threat due to the high frequency of prior anomalies that targeted American high schoolers in between late 1975 and early 1977. As is policy standard for projected anomalistic activity, various high-level Foundation \ncomputational engines\n were fed portions of the SCiPNET archival and research database in order to parse the information given in order to connect data points and form generalized predictions for future containment efforts.\n\n\nAfter two weeks of review, the F19 Anomalous-Prevalence Computational Engine, in collaboration with four Turing-standard artificial statistical analysis constructs, produced its results regarding SCP-7076 on 22 October 2068. These results confirmed the predicted likelihood that SCP-7076 would, in fact, increase in both number and severity, with models explicitly stating the high probability that this second wave of anomalies could possibly dwarf the recorded number of incidents that initially occurred in 1976.\n\n\nSCP-7076-1 designates a localized reality shift that is to occur during or immediately following a completed American high school senior graduation ceremony. The results of an SCP-7076-1 event are currently inconclusive, though the presented data suggests it will involve the sudden violent deaths and/or incorporation of all attendees.\n\n\nStatistical models also suggest that the sheer amount of SCP-7076-1 events in the following late spring and early summer of 2076 may potentially cause a reality cascade and mass reality restructuring event.\n\n\nPlease contact your Site Director in order to be assigned a research team.\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\n\n\nThe band has started playing.\n\n\nDo you know this song?\n\n\nIt is both a familiar yet unfamiliar tune.\n\n\nSomething heard in the distant possibility of a memory.\n\n\nOr a faded, faded dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\n\nADDENDUM 7076.1:\n Timeline of Events\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31 May 2069\n\n\nFour high school sophomores go missing in the midst of the school day. The incident was initially brushed aside as an instance of skipping class, though all four students were not friends nor were they part of an existing friend group. Security cameras in the hallway captured the students entering a supply closet before closing the door behind them. The closet was found empty with no exit points other than the main door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 August 2069\n\n\nTwelve high schools in the state of Iowa within a 50-mile radius do not open as planned for their first day of classes. Students and staff were unable to enter buildings on school grounds as both keycards and physical keys were useless in bypassing security locks. Several students claimed that they could see movement through various windows of the building, with two students reporting that they saw the classrooms were filled with \"doppelgangers\" of the student and staff body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 September 2070\n\n\nMichelle Easmon, a biology teacher at Ledeville High School in Robeson, Oregon, is reported to have initiated a lesson that was not in the class itinerary. The topic of the lesson regarded the effects of sound frequency on cellular bodies, in which she produced and powered on an antique radio c. 1950. The audio quality was discordant and caused pain and migraines to those present. Afterwards, students reported the persistent feeling that they had forgotten something important, though this faded over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 September 2070\n\n\nDuring a broadcasted speech, Senator Denise Rivera (OH) congratulates the graduating class of 2076, stating that she will \"work [her] damnedest to push all Ohio students into the empty, lonely, and lovely future that they deserve.\" Ms. Rivera's eyes then roll back into her head and she falls to the ground, seizing.

Investigations revealed the cause to be hundreds of partially shredded and destroyed yearbook pages that appeared to have been spontaneously generated from within SCP-1833's binding. Due to the intense pressure, most of these pages were shredded to such an extent that the contents were illegible, though the few fragments that could be recovered depicted the fully alphabetized headshots of various current high school seniors from across the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 January 2076\n\n\nPlymouth Regional High School, located in Plymouth, New Hampshire, experiences a shift in which several blocks of lockers immediately sink into and through the floor.

        "Item Number: SCP-7076 Object Class: Pending Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7076 does not require containment, see below. Description: SCP-7076 was a series of escalating anomalous incidents that occurred across the United States and primarily targeted the senior high school graduating class of 2076. Foundation statistical models predicted SCP-7076 due to previous data and recorded history regarding a series of violent anomalous occurrences that victimized the high school senior class of 1976. Foundation statistical models also predicted a culmination resulting from various reality failures occurring at graduation ceremonies across the United States. While anomalies pertaining to the class of 1976 experienced heightened activity, there was no resulting cascading event at any ceremony within the country. Kant counters were eventually brought to various random graduation ceremonies, with resulting measurements displaying no deviation from baseline Hume levels. Following the summer of 2076, all anomalous activity pertaining to SCP-7076 and SCP-7076-related anomalies ceased. SCP-7076 is currently being decommissioned and will be archived within the Foundation's database.",
