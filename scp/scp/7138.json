You wanted to see me?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n Yes, have a seat.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n So what do you need?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n I\u2019ve got something for you. An SCP that just got picked up.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n What is it?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n It\u2019s a painting, I think.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n You think?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n Well, it\u2019s from those weird artists\u2026 Are We Cool Yet? or whatever they call themselves. To me, it\u2019s just a bunch of magenta paint slopped on a canvas.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n I see. And what anomalous properties does it possess?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n It's killed three people by triggering self-mutilation.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n [whistles] Well, that certainly seems anomalous enough. How'd you get it?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n An MTF found it outside of an apartment where three artists had gouged out their eyes. By the time they got there, two were already dead from blood loss. The third died in custody a few hours later.\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n Just the eyes, you say?\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n Yep. The reports should show up in your inbox shortly.\n\n\n[A chair scrapes as it is pushed back.]\n\n\nDr. Montgomery:\n Well, it should be pretty simple. Most likely there\u2019s just some kind of memetic agent encoded in the image.\n\n\nDirector Carl Blanden:\n Thank you. I\u2019ll expect a report shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA newer version of this document has been detected.\n\n\nVIEW NEXT ITERATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7137\n | SCP-7138 | \nSCP-7139\n \u00bb",
