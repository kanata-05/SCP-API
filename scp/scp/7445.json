Provisional Area-358 has been established in order to properly investigate the anomaly and have better access to LoI-NW/107.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.2\n \u2014 LoI-NW/107, circa 1971.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7445 denotes an anomaly located beneath LoI-NW/107 (\"\nPalavataivas Observatorio\n\"), an observatory located in Savukoski, Finland. The only way to reach the anomaly is believed to be through the observatory's southernmost compartment, which leads to SCP-7445 through a steep spiral stairway. Additionally, a golden placard reading the words \"\u041a\u00eb\u0446ka-1; \u0410\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c 1959\"\n1\n can be seen on SCP-7445's door.\n\n\nSCP-7445's only anomalous property consists of its inaccessibility. Out of all the 19 attempts carried out by Foundation personnel in order to try and breach SCP-7445's entrance, none have proven successful. As such, SCP-7445's contents are currently unknown.\n\n\nSCP-7445 was originally discovered by Provisional Area-358's Communications Department following the interception of a report detailing the discovery of a previously unknown room within LoI-NW/107, although no researchers could enter it. No blueprints of the observatory included SCP-7445.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7445-1:\n CONTAINMENT LOG \u2014 19.02.1971\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7445 was originally contained by the SCP Foundation on the morning of February 19th, 1971, following the anomaly's discovery. As SCP-7445 was occupied and heavily guarded by members of \nGoI-358 (\"The Abnormal Interactions Command\"),\n a field agent (\"Operative \u0431\u00e1\u0432\u0438\u0435\u0440a / B\u00e1vyera\") was dispatched to terminate the station's occupiers.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 19/2/1971\n\n\nFIRE TEAM:\n Dispatchment-A34/B\u00e1vyera.\n3\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n Agent BV34 was armed with 3 AM-B2s to mass amnesticize station personnel clustered in single rooms; 10 ST/Class-A amnestic syringes to individually administer to separate and isolated personnel; and a silenced Makarov PM to terminate any necessary personnel.\n\n\nAgent BV34's primary objective was to amnesticize all of the station's personnel and contain them within a single room for later termination or extraction by MTF Samekh-358 (\"Stuck in the Sauna\"). The following log details the mission, as successfully performed by Agent BV34 and commanded by Dr. Ilya N\u00e1machov.\n\n\nThe following log has been translated from Russian, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nFootage begins recording. BV34's body camera pans up to record the entrance to the Palavataivas Observatory. It's nighttime outside and BV34 is wearing a flashlight.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n N\u00e1machov.\n\n\nCommand:\n BV34.\n\n\n(\nBV34 raises his flashlight and his gun, and slowly walks towards one of the station's walls.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n What's the current demographic status of the base?\n\n\n(\nRustling paper can be heard over the radio, followed by a short pause.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Base is currently at 11 personnel. Activities are unknown; all comms are heavily restricted and protected as to avoid interceptions.\n\n\nBV34:\n Roger that. What should I do, Command?\n\n\n(\nWind resonates across the radio, partially lowering N\u00e1machov's volume.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Proceed to the closest entrance. If possible, try and breach any of the station's secondary access points.\n\n\nBV34:\n There's only one entrance.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n \u2026Right. Breach the entrance, then. And try not to make any noise.\n\n\nBV34:\n Got that.\n\n\n(\nBV34 crouches and slowly closes up to the station's door. The wind begins to strengthen as BV34 sticks to the facility's door.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n N\u00e1machov, I can hear one\u2026 No, two people walking along the entrance's hallway.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n They're walking from one point to another; side-to-side.\n\n\nCommand:\n I gave you a pocket arsenal, B\u00e1vyera. You don't need to tell me everything that is going on.\n\n\nBV34:\n Right, right.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n One\u2026\n\n\nBV34:\n Two\u2026\n\n\nBV34:\n Three\u2026\n\n\n(\nShort pause. BV34 kicks the door wide open, and bursts into the hallway. Just as soon as he breaches onto the hall, he grabs a guard by the chest and stabs a syringe into his neck before knocking his rifle to the floor.\n)\n\n\n(\nAnother guard, situated at the end of the hallway, raises his own rifle and aims at BV34, who quickly pushes the injected guard aside and pulls out his Makarov. He throws himself to the floor and slides forward before aiming his gun up at the guard, and shooting him in the chest twice.\n)\n\n\n(\nAs the guard's chest bleeds a pair of bloodstreams, he screams and frantically shoots at the floor in an attempt to take down BV34. The agent quickly stands up and chokes the guard against the wall before stabbing another syringe onto his neck. The first guard stands up from the floor, picking up his rifle, and clumsily aims at BV34.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Fuck.\n\n\n(\nThe guard tries firing at the operative twice. BV34 shoots him in the leg, making him stumble onto the floor before dropping his rifle. As the amnestics' effects begin kicking in, the guard falls limp.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n N\u00e1machov, there were two guards at the en-\n\n\nCommand:\n No need to tell, operative. I've heard the whole thing.\n\n\nBV34:\n Okay, both of them are down and limp. One of them's got a pair of shots in the chest, though.\n\n\nCommand:\n The only thing that matters right now is that they're both down. If one of them dies, that's not our concern.\n\n\nBV34:\n Understood. I'm proceeding to the next room.\n\n\n(\nRustling paper can be heard from Command's radio.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Alright. If you pop in one or two B2s, please close all entrances and squeeze out of the room just as soon as the smoke expands. Also, please remember that I'm not your daddy.\n\n\nBV34:\n Mhm.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n It's infested with SACKs. The Directorate's not gonna like this.\n\n\nCommand:\n It's okay. I'll deal with it as soon as the mission's done.\n\n\n(\nShort pause.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Okay. I'm going in.\n\n\n(\nBV34 knocks the door open. Six researchers wearing white lab coats and ushankas are playing a card game and smoking cigars in one of the room's two tables. Just as soon as BV34 enters the room, the researchers notice him and stop playing.\n)\n\n\n(\nBV34 opens an AM-B2 smoke bomb and tosses it at the group, which quickly throws the table forward, breaking it. While a pair of researchers take cover behind the broken table, the rest pull out Glock 17 guns and try shooting at the operative, who throws the other table forward and takes cover.\n)\n\n\n(\nTwo researchers quickly approach BV34's knocked table and take cover on the other side while the bomb quickly begins expelling amnestic gas at the end of the room.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Shit. Command, they're all armed. Or at least most of them.\n\n\nCommand:\n Don't be shy to use what you have.\n\n\n(\nSilence. A few seconds later, two thumps are heard.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Right. Two are down. I'll throw another one to fasten it up.\n\n\nCommand:\n Understood. Take cover once you do so.\n\n\n(\nShort pause.\n)\n\n\n(\nBV34 quickly stands up and runs to the door behind him, dodging the quick gunfire as another pair of researchers falls asleep. He opens another bomb, and tosses it across the room before hiding behind the door. The remaining researchers charge towards the door he's locked himself behind, and aggressively try to open it.\n)\n\n\n(\nAs BV34 keeps pulling the door back, one of the researchers shoots the operative, hitting him in his right calf.\n)\n\n\n(\nBV34 screams in pain. After a few seconds of pulling back, the operative kicks the door wide open, pushing the researchers onto the floor. Following this, he stabs one of them in the neck with a syringe before shooting the other in the head. The first researcher tries to stand up, but BV34 pushes the syringe further in before retrieving it.\n)\n\n\n(\nThe second researcher falls asleep, limp. BV34 stands up and covers his mouth and nose with a piece of cloth lying next to the dead researcher.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n They outdid my day again, huh?\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Well, you outdid 8 people already. Wait, no. 6 people.\n\n\nBV34:\n Uh huh. If I were you, I'd begin detaching the whole team. My job's almost done here.\n\n\nCommand:\n They're on their way already. ETA is 2 minutes or so.\n\n\n(\nSilence. BV34 takes the dead researcher's glock and keeps it in his pocket.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Right, good. I'm heading for the target.\n\n\nCommand:\n Take care.\n\n\n(\nBV34 nods. Then, he leaves by the door he previously locked himself behind.\n)\n\n\n(\nThe hallway connecting to SCP-7445's stairway is heavily secluded and a pair of security cameras point at BV34. At the end of the hallway, a vault door can be seen.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n There's, uh\u2026 Surveillance cameras in here.\n\n\nCommand:\n Take your badges off. We don't want to get in a mess with these guys. Their task forces are damn tough.\n\n\nBV34:\n The badges are under my gear.\n\n\nCommand:\n Okay, hm.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n I guess you could just w-\n\n\n(\nN\u00e1machov is interrupted as BV34 fires at the security cameras, striking them in the lens. Following that, he begins walking forward.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Right. Guess that works too.\n\n\nBV34:\n The building is clear, by the way. Just in case the boys are coming in.\n\n\n(\nBV34 kicks down the door in front of him and proceeds the stairway leading to SCP-7445. The stairway is completely dark, in comparison to the remainder of the building. He turns on his flashlight, and proceeds forward.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Also tell the boys to bring flares. This place is dark.\n\n\nCommand:\n Noted.\n\n\n(\nBV34 descends to the bottom of the stairway with caution, which seems to be full of cobwebs and dust. Once he reaches the bottom, he crouches under the spiral staircase, and turns off his flashlight.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n There's 3 more of them. You may want to take care of them before they ask for an E11 unit.\n\n\nBV34:\n Shut up for a second.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\n(\nA few seconds later, BV34 kicks the floor with his heels. Suddenly, three red lights emanate from the end of yet another hallway, and begin looking around.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Huh. This one's tough.\n\n\n(\nBV34 turns his flashlight on before firing at the guard's NVDs\n4\n in the distance. As the goggles crack into glass shards, the guard frantically charges towards BV34, resisting the fired shots. The operative dodges the charging guard, and chokes him by the back.\n)\n\n\n(\nJust as soon as BV34 is about to administer a syringe to the guard, the latter defends himself by aggressively kicking the operative's liver with his left elbow. BV34 releases the guard and falls onto the floor, damaged.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Agent?\n\n\nBV34:\n SILENC-\n\n\n(\nBV34 is grabbed by the neck, lifted above, then thrown to the floor. A crack is heard as the guard removes his helmet, and smashes it against the operative's head.\n)\n\n\n(\nJust as the guard lifts his helmet to smash it onto the agent once again, BV34 raises himself and stabs the syringe onto one of the aggressor's eyes, who recoils and whines in pain. BV34 pulls out his Glock and fires at the guard's head thrice, terminating him. The latter's corpse thumps onto the floor.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Piece of shit.\n\n\n(\nThe agent slowly stands up. His right leg has been broken.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Command. ETA?\n\n\nCommand:\n They should already be there. What's your status?\n\n\nBV34:\n One of my legs is mangled and my head is spilling brains like the damned Kolim\u00e1.\n\n\nCommand:\n You're being retrieved soon enough. I'll let the rest do the dirty work, then.\n\n\n(\nBV34 chuckles.\n)\n\n\nBV34:\n Well done. Fuck them SACKs. Fuck them as hard as you can.\n\n\nCommand:\n Will do. Is the Ky\u00f3tska there?\n\n\nBV34:\n No idea. I'm bleeding beneath the staircase and I can barely move.\n\n\n(\nRustling paper and static can be heard over the radio.\n)\n\n\nCommand:\n Okay. Sit down and wait for the guys to take you back. Great job, agent. You can turn your cam off now.\n\n\nBV34:\n Thank you, N\u00e1machov.\n\n\nCommand:\n No problem.\n\n\n(\nAs the recovery team is heard descending the stairway, BV34 turns his body camera off, and the feed is cut.\n)\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the arrival of the recovery team, Agent B\u00e1vyera was transported to Provisional Area-358 and his wounds were adequately treated. His right femur and tibia were found to suffer from minor injuries, and a bullet was extracted from his right calf. Additionally, a fracture had opened on his left temple, requiring surgery in order to be treated. Because of this, the agent was officially discharged until he fully recovered from his wounds.\n\n\nAll amnesticized personnel were extracted from the base and moved to Provisional Area-358, where each of them were administered a large dose of Class-B amnestics and discharged from their prior positions. The remaining pair of personnel was found to be outside the base, performing tests on the area's permafrost and soil. They were promptly amnesticized by the recovery team before they returned to the base.\n\n\nLoI-NW/107 was successfully seized and a group of Foundation researchers was established in the base in order to contain SCP-7445.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7445-2:\n INCIDENT LOG \u2014 07.03.1971\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the morning of March 7th, 1971, 15 days following the containment of SCP-7445, several squads of the Global Occult Coalition were spotted patrolling through the streets of Savukoski, Savukoski Municipality, carrying heavy weaponry and explosive materials. All of the GOC officers were dressed as members of the local authorities and the Abnormal Interactions Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 3.1\n \u2014 Savukoski, Finland, circa 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt about 0640 hours, GMT+1, all GOC operatives stationed themselves in front of the Savukoski Town Hall, and breached its entrance using battering rams and siege engines. Following this, the operatives stormed the site and all civilians were held at gunpoint under the guise of a national scale drug investigation being performed.\n\n\nAfter breaching onto the observatory's basement, the operatives found a vault door that led to Provisional Area-358, located beneath the STH. The vault was breached using rams, as it required a password in order to be opened. Following this, several groups of operatives stormed the facility beneath.\n\n\nAs the raid continued, a group of GOC operatives proceeded to cut the power supply, and the facility went pitchblack. An evacuation protocol was initiated by the Site's personnel, and a Site-wide breach was announced to the remainder of the Foundation. Local security was heavily affected by the power cutoff, as the lack of power resulted in MTF responses being delayed. Additionally, the MTFs were not prepared to respond to such an incident.\n\n\nLater during the incident, the Foundation personnel began evacuating through an emergency tunnel that would lead them to the Savukoski helipad, where they would be transported to the city of Rovaniemi until Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") security teams could properly deal with the breach. As the breach went on, however, Foundation helicopters stationed at R3C Halcyon-3\n6\n were simultaneously hijacked by another group of assailants that damaged the helicopters' engines.\n\n\nThe camp was later declared as lost, as the assailants had destroyed all of the Foundation's properties and captured all personnel. As such, no evacuation routes were considered plausible at the time, requiring personnel to take alternatives and improvise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 3.2\n \u2014 Palavataivas Observatorio, Savukoski, circa 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the GOC squads began wreaking havoc across the site, destroying large amounts of materials, seizing multiple anomalies and capturing as much personnel as possible, a series of operatives proceeded to leave the site and admonish all individuals wearing white coats and ushankas. This hindered the personnel's attempts to escape through the assigned evacuation routes, as a large amount of civilians joined the cause and helped the squads chasing the persecuted.\n\n\nNotably, the admonition was first transmitted in Russian, but later in Finnish.\n\n\n\n\nIn total, only 3 of the 47 researchers stationed at Provisional Site-358 managed to escape. The rest were abducted by the intruders, and extracted from Savukoski towards an unknown location. None of the escapees managed to retain any information about the incident, as their objectives were solely focused on escaping the Site safe and sound.\n\n\nProvisional Site-358 was successfully recovered by a platoon of Foundation soldiers on that same day, and as of March 8th, 1971, the Site is officially secure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n\n\u00abNOTICE FROM THE RECORDKEEPING AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\u00bb\n\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous file has been heavily modified by an unidentified intruder.

Please stand by while the issue is being fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 RAISA Technician Kekko Markkinen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7445-3:\n DIRECTORY CHANGELOG \u2014 15.03.1971\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 13th, 1971, a pair of squads pertaining to MTF Samekh-358 (\"Stuck in the Sauna\") and MTF Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") carrying anomalous weaponry and specialized gear breached an occupied Provisional Site-358 through the facility's evacuation system, attacking the Site at an unexpected time. In a matter of 12 minutes, all access routes for the Site were completely blocked, and the Site's occupiers were terminated without any Foundation casualties.\n\n\nDespite the large amount of occupiers shown in Addendum 7445.2, there were only 7 intruders inside the facility at the time of its recovery. None of them carried any GOC identifiers, or any sort of identifying material for that matter.\n\n\nFollowing the recovery of Provisional Site-358, it was revealed that all terminals containing remote SCP files were hijacked and locked under a new password. However, the encrypting was noted to be weak and easy to crack, leading to the swift recovery of the terminals by Foundation technicians.\n\n\nNotably, among the 34 files contained within the remote terminals, only 3 were edited by the intruders described in Addendum 7445-2:\n\n\n\n\nThe SCP-7445 document;\n\n\nA file containing information on Incident-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/1, an event that took place in November 1959 in the town of Kolari, Finland, and involved information regarding an anomaly under the GRU-P Division's jurisdiction;\n\n\nAnd a dossier containing notorious information about LoI-NW/107, which was heavily guarded by Foundation personnel until a raid occurred on March 5th, 1971, and terminated all of the Foundation's activities within SCP-7445 and the observatory.\n8\n\n\n\n\nThe second and third files were completely devoid of contents following their recovery by the technicians, and all attempts to perform a backup or a recovery of their previous contents were met with failure. SCP-7445's file, however, was heavily edited to:\n\n\n\n\nContain an incomplete and shortened version of the original file;\n9\n\n\nInclude a video log of LoI-NW/107's siege by a russophone intruder;\n10\n\n\nAnd include a summary of Provisional Site-358's seizure by several squads of intruders.\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a complete analysis of the situation by RAISA Technician Kekko Markkinen, a series of inconsistencies and errata were discovered in the newly-edited SCP-7445 file.\n\n\nThe following is a list of said incongruences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.\n Although Provisional Site-358 was cited by its \ncorrect designation\n in the notice at the beginning of the new SCP-7445 file, the facility is cited as \"Provisional Area-358\" throughout the remainder of the document.\n\n\nII.\n SCP-7445 had been under the Foundation's jurisdiction and containment since 1968, and as the anomaly was categorized as a Safe-Class object, a set of established containment procedures was already in place until LoI-NW/107 was sieged. SCP-7445's discovery, as such, \nis not recent\n.\n\n\nIII.\n SCP-7445's properties were known to the Foundation, and the anomaly was completely accessible. Most information included in the new file was \nfalsified by the assailants\n.\n\n\nIV.\n \nThere is no Communications Department\n at Provisional Site-358, as the Site's only purpose is to monitor extraterrestrial, astronomical and astrophysical anomalies; and contains anomalous instruments that may relate to said fields.\n\n\nV.\n The Global Occult Coalition has \ndenied any involvement\n in the siege described in Addendum 7445.2. Additionally, the GOC has denied having any involvement in Savukoski as a whole.\n\n\nVI.\n There are no records of Soviet researchers being stationed at Provisional Site-358, with the entirety of the site being comprised by personnel of \nFinnish nationality\n and descent. As such, the individual known as Dr. Ilya N\u00e1machov is either an intruder pertaining to another organization, \nor doesn't exist\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the original SCP-7445 file was deleted along with all of its addenda and contents, a new recontainment operation needs to be carried out in order to recreate the old document. Excavation and extraction of SCP-7445 will begin on March 18th, 1971 in order to transport the anomaly to Provisional Site-358.\n\n\nAs a result of the recent raid on Provisional Site-358, the O5 Council has performed an unanimous vote, and officially declared that the facility will be moved to the municipality of Riihim\u00e4ki along with SCP-7445 in order to avoid further breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \n\"Kyotska-1; April 1959\"\n\n\n2\n.

    "containment_procedures": "As SCP-7445 was recently discovered and little is known about the anomaly's nature, behavior and properties, a proper set of containment procedures cannot be established yet. Provisional Area-358 has been established in order to properly investigate the anomaly and have better access to LoI-NW/107.",
    "description": "SCP-7445 denotes an anomaly located beneath LoI-NW/107 (\"Palavataivas Observatorio\"), an observatory located in Savukoski, Finland. The only way to reach the anomaly is believed to be through the observatory's southernmost compartment, which leads to SCP-7445 through a steep spiral stairway. Additionally, a golden placard reading the words \"\u041a\u00eb\u0446ka-1; \u0410\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c 1959\"1 can be seen on SCP-7445's door.",
