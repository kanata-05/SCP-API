All testing with SCP-2207 is to be done in containment laboratory 8803. After testing, containment laboratory 8803 is to be decontaminated and checked for damage.\n\n\nAs of test 42, exploration by D-class and/or Foundation personnel beyond SCP-2207-1 instances are preemptively denied.\n\n\nAs of Incident 2207-01, all tests involving SCP-2207 are to be suspended.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2207 is a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand disposable plastic knife. Testing has indicated that, outside of SCP-2207's anomalous properties, it is identical to other non-anomalous disposable plastic knives.\n\n\nWhen the cutting edge of SCP-2207 reaches a minimum speed of 6\u00a0m/s\n1\n, it severs local space-time, creating a rift that connects to a random alternate universe. These rifts are designated as SCP-2207-1.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2207-1 typically last approximately five minutes without outside intervention, and the length is equal to the distance that SCP-2207 traveled at or above 6m/s. Instances remain stationary after creation, but may be widened by pulling along the edges. Instances may be kept artificially open for a maximum of 24 hours by placing any material across the instance's threshold. After 24 hours, the SCP-2207-1 instance closes, severing any material crossing the threshold.\n\n\nExploration Log:\n The following is a partial, abridged exploration log. See Document 2207-24 for a full log of tests, explorations, and recovered material from SCP-2207-1 instances. In all tests, a mechanical arm was used to create SCP-2207-1 instances, and the SCP-2207-1 instance was propped open by a set of metal braces. It has been later determined that at least three other alternate realities accessed by different SCPs, including \nSCP-1165\n, may be the result of prior testing with SCP-2207.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0exploration\u00a0log.\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0exploration\u00a0log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-06-12\n\n\nTest #:\n 10\n\n\nExploration #:\n 1\n\n\nType:\n D-Class only, equipped with standard recovery harness and cable, radio/video umbilical, and Level C PPE.\n\n\nTest time:\n 24 hours.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-10 is in a hallway, with white walls, fluorescent lighting, and tiled floor. A set of double doors is on the opposite side. D-2207-1 does not report any unusual sensations upon breaching the SCP-2207-1 instance, and is instructed to pass through the double doors.\n\n\nOne minute into the test, D-2207-1 reports that he is no closer to the doors than when he started. Video confirms this. However, 84 meters of recovery cable and umbilical has been fed through the SCP-2207-1 instance, and visual inspection from outside the instance indicates that D-2207-1 has walked halfway through the hallway.\n\n\nD-2207-1 is instructed to keep moving forward, and complies despite mild protest. After two more minutes, D-2207-1 reports that he is still no closer to the doors. Video confirms this, and an additional 168 meters of cable and umbilical has been fed through the SCP-2207-1 instance. Visual inspection from the outside of the SCP-2207-1 instance indicates that D-2207-1 has still not moved more than halfway through the hallway.\n\n\nAt this point, D-2207-1 is recalled. From the outside of the SCP-2207-1 instance, D-2207-1 is seen to turn around. D-2207-1 reports that the SCP-2207-1 instance is much further, with video indicating a distance of approximately 250 meters. D-2207-1 runs towards the SCP-2207-1 instance, while the recall cable is activated. D-2207-1 is visibly seen to run in place from the exterior of the SCP-2207-1 instance.\n\n\n252 meters of recovery cable has been recalled after 30 seconds, filling the spool. Research personnel begin to physically pull on the recovery cable, trying to manually recall D-2207-1. D-2207-1 reports that he's no closer than before to the SCP-2207-1 instance.\n\n\nThree minutes and thirty seconds into the test, D-2207-1 is instructed to stop moving, and given the explanation that technical difficulties compounded by his movement are hampering recovery efforts.\n\n\nAn additional 108 meters of recovery cable and video umbilical is manually recalled over the next thirty seconds, with researchers noting that they don't feel any additional weight on the other end. Video and observation from the SCP-2207-1 instance indicates that D-2207-1 looks behind him. Video shows that the double doors appear to be much further behind him than before, and D-2207-1 begins to run towards the SCP-2207-1 instance.\n\n\nTen hours into the test, D-2207-1 has largely stopped his attempts at self-recovery. During this period of time, D-2207-1 was seen to alternate between running, walking, jogging, and sobbing.\n\n\nExploration ends after a period of 24 hours, due to the forced closure of the SCP-2207-1 instance. Metal braces, the recovery cable, and the radio/video umbilical are severed. D-2207-1 is not recovered, and an additional \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 meters of recovery cable and radio/video umbilical were recovered. Examination of the recovered cable and umbilical indicate no deviances from Foundation standard, apart from the anomalously added length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-06-27\n\n\nTest #:\n 25\n\n\nExploration #:\n 15\n\n\nType:\n D-Class only, equipped with EEG cap\n2\n, standard recovery harness and cable, radio/video umbilical, and Level C PPE.\n\n\nTest Time:\n 16 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-25 is a small alley of a large, unnamed city. D-2207-7 reports a sensation of vertigo upon breaching the SCP-2207-1 instance. During the immediate stages of exploration, materials are recovered (mostly refuse), and D-2207-7 reports three additional vertigo-like sensations and an occasional stare from inhabitants of Universe-25. The latter is determined not to be a breach of exploration protocol, as D-2207-7 is dressed in level C PPE.\n\n\nAt approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds into the test, D-2207-7 reports a fifth sensation of vertigo, and levels of ambient light begin to notably diminish. D-2207-7 looks up (without being directed) towards the sun. The sun appears to be undergoing a solar eclipse. However, the occluding object does not pass over the sun, but instead appears to originate from the center of the sun.\n\n\nAfter one minute and thirty seconds, the unknown object has fully occluded the sun, including the corona. D-2207-7 is ordered to come back, but is unable to as the unknown occluding object appears to attract objects on the ground. Video indicates D-2207-7, as well as other individuals, vehicles, and other objects are lifted into the air, moving towards the unknown occluding object. The attracting force does not extend past the SCP-2207-1 instance. There is no meaningful communication from D-2207-7 during this period of time.\n\n\nThe recall cable is activated, and D-2207-7 is recovered within one minute. The metal braces propping the SCP-2207-1 instance is removed, and the instance is allowed to close naturally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-07-10\n\n\nTest #:\n 38\n\n\nExploration #:\n 28\n\n\nType:\n D-Class only, equipped with EEG cap, standard recovery harness and cable, radio/video umbilical, and Level C PPE.\n\n\nTest Time:\n 2 hours, 38 minutes, 18 seconds.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-38 appears to be in a farmland, currently growing a crop visually similar to \nZea mays\n subsp. \nmays\n (maize or corn). D-2207-14 begins limited recovery of crop samples.\n\n\nAfter one hour, D-2207-14 returns with gathered samples and passes through the SCP-2207-1 instance. Research personnel note that all samples are of low quality, heavily blighted and easily destroyed by light handling. D-2207-14 claims that none of the samples she recovered were blighted when questioned. Review of video confirms D-2207-14's account.\n\n\nD-2207-14 is sent to recover new samples from Universe-38, after being equipped with twenty four re-sealable bio-safe sample bags. Upon breaching the SCP-2207-1 instance at one hour and thirty minutes into the test, she reports that all plant life within two meters of the SCP-2207-1 instance have withered. Video and observation from SCP-2207-1 confirms this.\n\n\nD-2207-14 notes that wind speed is increasing, and discovers a structure similar to a barn at the two hour mark. She is instructed to go inside.\n\n\nThe interior of the barn-like structure does not significantly differ from barns in working farms, being used for storage for a variety of tools and packaged plant matter visually similar to hay. D-2207-14 is instructed to gather samples of the hay-like plant matter and two easily-carried tools.\n\n\nD-2207-14 travels to the upper floor of the barn-like structure and approaches a window. The location of the breach point of Universe-38 is visible due to the withered plants surrounding the instance. Observation indicates that the wind is rapidly spreading the withering or blighting effect.\n\n\nD-2207-14 reports that she hears a noise from the lower level of the barn-like structure and investigates. A male individual, wearing blue overalls, a gray t-shirt, a hat made of a straw-like material, and carrying a rifle of unknown make and model is seen inspecting the recovery cable and radio/video umbilical.\n\n\nD-2207-14 is instructed to switch her radio to free-range mode and to press the quick-release button on the recovery harness. D-2207-14 complies, and is instructed to leave the barn-like structure and return to the SCP-2207-1 instance. Site-\u2588\u2588's armed containment response unit is called to containment laboratory 8803 as a precautionary measure.\n\n\nAt two hours and twenty three minutes, D-2207-14 reports that she has left the barn, but the individual from the barn had spotted her and started firing his rifle. Gunshots and yelling in an unknown language can be heard over the radio. The recall cable is activated.\n\n\nD-2207-14 reaches the SCP-2207-1 instance at two hours and thirty minutes into the exploration. The unknown individual is seen entering the withered/blighted area, and falls to the ground before Site-\u2588\u2588's armed containment response unit can fire. The individual's body is subsequently seen to rapidly mummify. D-2207-14 is instructed to recover the unknown individual's body, and eventually complies. The instance is allowed to naturally close.\n\n\nThe second set of recovered samples do not show signs of the blighting effect that the first had. The unknown individual was found to be carrying identification in a wallet, along with several examples of paper currency and a set of photos, presumably of family members. All information in the wallet is in an unknown and currently undeciphered script. The recovered tools were determined to be functionally identical to a dulled hand scythe and a hacksaw.\n\n\nD-2207-14 died shortly after the test, mummifying thirty minutes after the exploration, likely due to the blighting effect. The effect was found to not be communicable from D-2207-14's body, the body of the unknown individual from Universe-38, or any recovered material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-07-14\n\n\nTest #:\n 42\n\n\nExploration #:\n 32\n\n\nType:\n D-Class only, equipped with EEG cap, standard recovery harness and cable, radio/video umbilical, and Level C PPE.\n\n\nTest Time:\n 24 hours.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-42 is a grassy field, with the skyline of an unknown city visible approximately two to three kilometers away from the breach point. D-2207-16 is instructed to pass through the SCP-2207-1 instance.\n\n\nD-2207-16 is seen to breach SCP-2207-1, and subsequently appears to freeze in place once fully through. Video feed is still operational, and requests to ascertain D-2207-16's status are unanswered. EEG shows a sudden increase of alpha brainwave activity. The recall cable is activated after thirty seconds.\n\n\nThe recall cable snaps at the SCP-2207-1 instance, also severing the radio/video umbilical. Visual observation from the SCP-2207-1 instance shows that the umbilical and recall cable beyond the threshold remain slack.\n\n\nRecovery attempts are made with a variety of tools, including hooked poles. However, all attempts fail in a similar manner to the recall cable, with objects quickly becoming stuck after exposure to the environment beyond the SCP-2207-1 instance. It is also discovered that the metal braces remain immobile.\n\n\nExploration ends after a period of 24 hours, due to the forced closure of the SCP-2207-1 instance. Metal braces and all tools used in the recovery attempt are severed. D-2207-16 is not recovered.\n\n\nNote:\n \nDue to the attrition rate of D-class and near-certainty of hostile and/or dangerous conditions beyond SCP-2207-1 instances, remote control drones with audio/video feedback are to be used for all further tests involving SCP-2207.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-07-28\n\n\nTest #:\n 56\n\n\nExploration #:\n 46\n\n\nType:\n Remote controlled drone with audio/video feedback.\n\n\nTest time:\n 35 minutes, 45 seconds.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-56 appears to be within a borough or small suburb outside of a large city. The drone is deployed.\n\n\nWithin one minute, the skyscrapers of the city are seen to sag, causing a mild panic from individuals within the suburb. The sagging becomes more defined as the exploration continues. By three minutes, the skyscrapers appear to begin melting, and the sagging effect is now seen on the houses of the suburb. The sagging effect passes to individuals after five minutes.\n\n\nBy ten minutes, almost all visible objects have turned to puddles, and the controller of the drone notes difficulty in controlling the drone. After fifteen minutes, the drone becomes unresponsive to controls and falls to the ground.\n\n\nA second drone is deployed, while video data is still received from the first, which progressively distorts as the exploration goes on.\n\n\nAfter twenty-five minutes, the controller of the second drone reports difficulties with the drone's movement. The second drone is recalled, as no significantly new data was recorded. The metal braces are removed, and the SCP-2207-1 instance is allowed to close.\n\n\nInspection of the second drone shows that all load-bearing surfaces are heavily warped, with sagging effects on the remaining surfaces. The side of the metal braces exposed to Universe-56 are also found to be warped. Strength and compression tests indicates that the affected material does not deviate from non-affected material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 19\u2588\u2588-10-06\n\n\nTest #:\n 126\n\n\nExploration #:\n 116\n\n\nType:\n Remote controlled drone with audio/video feedback.\n\n\nTest Time:\n 1 hour, 21 minutes, 36 seconds.\n\n\nOverview:\n The breach point of Universe-126 is a glade in a temperate forest, during the day. The drone is deployed, and occasional faint, jagged lines are seen in the ground, sky, and air. The lines appear to be harmless to the drone.\n\n\nAfter three minutes, the lines are distinct enough to continuously observe, with the highest concentration forming around the SCP-2207-1 instance.\n\n\nAfter ten minutes, sections of the sky are rendered as blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" visible in white. Visual observation from the SCP-2207-1 instance indicates that the sections appear black.\n\n\nBy twenty minutes, the entire sky is rendered in blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" in white. Sunlight is still visible, though without an apparent source.\n\n\nForty minutes into the exploration, sections of the ground are rendered in blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" visible in white. One of these sections appears under a tree, which subsequently falls. The tree is not visible as it passes into the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patch.\n\n\nOne hour into the exploration, the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patches begin to form in the air, with the ones on the ground expanding and new ones forming.\n\n\nAfter an hour and fifteen minutes, the drone is recalled as the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patches make further exploration difficult. The controller is unable to successfully navigate the drone back, causing it to become disabled and fall to the ground.\n\n\nTwo minutes later, a \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patch forms on the ground beneath the drone, and contact is subsequently lost.\n\n\nThe metal braces are removed from the SCP-2207-1 instance, and it is allowed to naturally close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 2207-01:\n On 19\u2588\u2588-10-06, the following letter was found addressed to Site-\u2588\u2588's administration:\n\n\n\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\n\n\nIT HAS COME TO THE ATTENTION OF \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 THAT MULTIPLE RECENT YGGDRASIL-SEVERANCE EVENTS ARE TIED TO ACTIONS PERFORMED BY YOUR ORGANIZATION, \nThe SCP Foundation\n.

D-2207-14 complies, and is instructed to leave the barn-like structure and return to the SCP-2207-1 instance. Site-\u2588\u2588's armed containment response unit is called to containment laboratory 8803 as a precautionary measure. At two hours and twenty three minutes, D-2207-14 reports that she has left the barn, but the individual from the barn had spotted her and started firing his rifle. Gunshots and yelling in an unknown language can be heard over the radio. The recall cable is activated. D-2207-14 reaches the SCP-2207-1 instance at two hours and thirty minutes into the exploration. The unknown individual is seen entering the withered/blighted area, and falls to the ground before Site-\u2588\u2588's armed containment response unit can fire. The individual's body is subsequently seen to rapidly mummify. D-2207-14 is instructed to recover the unknown individual's body, and eventually complies. The instance is allowed to naturally close. The second set of recovered samples do not show signs of the blighting effect that the first had. The unknown individual was found to be carrying identification in a wallet, along with several examples of paper currency and a set of photos, presumably of family members. All information in the wallet is in an unknown and currently undeciphered script. The recovered tools were determined to be functionally identical to a dulled hand scythe and a hacksaw. D-2207-14 died shortly after the test, mummifying thirty minutes after the exploration, likely due to the blighting effect. The effect was found to not be communicable from D-2207-14's body, the body of the unknown individual from Universe-38, or any recovered material.",
        "Date: 19\u2588\u2588-07-14 Test #: 42 Exploration #: 32 Type: D-Class only, equipped with EEG cap, standard recovery harness and cable, radio/video umbilical, and Level C PPE. Test Time: 24 hours. Overview: The breach point of Universe-42 is a grassy field, with the skyline of an unknown city visible approximately two to three kilometers away from the breach point. D-2207-16 is instructed to pass through the SCP-2207-1 instance. D-2207-16 is seen to breach SCP-2207-1, and subsequently appears to freeze in place once fully through. Video feed is still operational, and requests to ascertain D-2207-16's status are unanswered. EEG shows a sudden increase of alpha brainwave activity. The recall cable is activated after thirty seconds. The recall cable snaps at the SCP-2207-1 instance, also severing the radio/video umbilical. Visual observation from the SCP-2207-1 instance shows that the umbilical and recall cable beyond the threshold remain slack. Recovery attempts are made with a variety of tools, including hooked poles. However, all attempts fail in a similar manner to the recall cable, with objects quickly becoming stuck after exposure to the environment beyond the SCP-2207-1 instance. It is also discovered that the metal braces remain immobile. Exploration ends after a period of 24 hours, due to the forced closure of the SCP-2207-1 instance. Metal braces and all tools used in the recovery attempt are severed. D-2207-16 is not recovered. Note: Due to the attrition rate of D-class and near-certainty of hostile and/or dangerous conditions beyond SCP-2207-1 instances, remote control drones with audio/video feedback are to be used for all further tests involving SCP-2207.",
        "Date: 19\u2588\u2588-07-28 Test #: 56 Exploration #: 46 Type: Remote controlled drone with audio/video feedback. Test time: 35 minutes, 45 seconds. Overview: The breach point of Universe-56 appears to be within a borough or small suburb outside of a large city. The drone is deployed. Within one minute, the skyscrapers of the city are seen to sag, causing a mild panic from individuals within the suburb. The sagging becomes more defined as the exploration continues. By three minutes, the skyscrapers appear to begin melting, and the sagging effect is now seen on the houses of the suburb. The sagging effect passes to individuals after five minutes. By ten minutes, almost all visible objects have turned to puddles, and the controller of the drone notes difficulty in controlling the drone. After fifteen minutes, the drone becomes unresponsive to controls and falls to the ground. A second drone is deployed, while video data is still received from the first, which progressively distorts as the exploration goes on. After twenty-five minutes, the controller of the second drone reports difficulties with the drone's movement. The second drone is recalled, as no significantly new data was recorded. The metal braces are removed, and the SCP-2207-1 instance is allowed to close. Inspection of the second drone shows that all load-bearing surfaces are heavily warped, with sagging effects on the remaining surfaces. The side of the metal braces exposed to Universe-56 are also found to be warped. Strength and compression tests indicates that the affected material does not deviate from non-affected material.",
        "Date: 19\u2588\u2588-10-06 Test #: 126 Exploration #: 116 Type: Remote controlled drone with audio/video feedback. Test Time: 1 hour, 21 minutes, 36 seconds. Overview: The breach point of Universe-126 is a glade in a temperate forest, during the day. The drone is deployed, and occasional faint, jagged lines are seen in the ground, sky, and air. The lines appear to be harmless to the drone. After three minutes, the lines are distinct enough to continuously observe, with the highest concentration forming around the SCP-2207-1 instance. After ten minutes, sections of the sky are rendered as blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" visible in white. Visual observation from the SCP-2207-1 instance indicates that the sections appear black. By twenty minutes, the entire sky is rendered in blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" in white. Sunlight is still visible, though without an apparent source. Forty minutes into the exploration, sections of the ground are rendered in blue with the phrase \"[NO SIGNAL]\" visible in white. One of these sections appears under a tree, which subsequently falls. The tree is not visible as it passes into the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patch. One hour into the exploration, the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patches begin to form in the air, with the ones on the ground expanding and new ones forming. After an hour and fifteen minutes, the drone is recalled as the \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patches make further exploration difficult. The controller is unable to successfully navigate the drone back, causing it to become disabled and fall to the ground. Two minutes later, a \"[NO SIGNAL]\" patch forms on the ground beneath the drone, and contact is subsequently lost. The metal braces are removed from the SCP-2207-1 instance, and it is allowed to naturally close.",
