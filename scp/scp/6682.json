SCP-6682's documents must be reviewed daily for unauthorized changes by trained personnel with proper knowledge of SCP-6682's abilities. SCP-6682 is to be kept in a Class-V Humanoid Containment Cell. The only access point in the cell is a small tempered glass viewport, viewed through a periscope. In case of damage, the Site Director is to be notified immediately. No devices or documents of any kind are to be moved within a 10-meter perimeter of SCP-6682. Any devices or documents possibly afflicted by SCP-6682 should be destroyed, no hospitality of any kind is to be shown to SCP-6682, persons found sympathetic to SCP-6682 are to be reassigned, and no items of any kind are to be provided to SCP-6682.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOh, this is pathetic.\n\nThey don't know the extent of what I can do.

And if you don't keep our little secret, \nI'll know.\n And I \nwill\n get out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6682 is the designation given to \na human measuring 1.7 meters, held prisoner without consent.\n SCP-6682's skin is dark grey in coloration, with similar physical properties to ABS plastics. It is not impervious to damage, however, SCP-6682 is capable of recovering through individual triangles materializing in damaged sections, interlacing together over a period of time to repair the surface. It is unknown to what extent injuries can be healed. Through observation of wounds, SCP-6682 appears to be hollow. SCP-6682 displays unusually high strength and coordination, capable of \ngiving hugs,\n however, SCP-6682 can be effectively subdued with minimal effort, entering a state of unconsciousness after sustaining fire from \n999\n rounds of 9x19mm ammunition. SCP-6682 is sapient and conversational, exhibiting a positive outlook and attitude, and acts jovially when conversing or interacting with other sapient beings. SCP-6682 has been shown to be fluent in English, French, Spanish, Latin, Portuguese, and Italian. It is theorized that SCP-6682 is also capable of understanding several other languages, including Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, and Hebrew. \nPossibly even more.\n SCP-6682 is \ncompliant.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI'm kind to them. Not that they return the favor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, \nSCP-6682 should be allowed 2 hours of escorted roaming of Site-82,\n as it poses a massive risk in the case of a containment breach. SCP-6682 has been observed to be \nconventionally attractive.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-6682 was discovered after mounting police reports of suicides and homicides in the state of Colorado, with equally as unusual circumstances and no evidence. Attached below is documentation regarding the theorized victims of SCP-6682.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6682\u00a0VL\u00a0UP.\u00a02009-1-1\u00a0-\u00a0LEVEL\u00a04\n\n\n\n\nSECURITY\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0LEVEL\u00a04\u00a0DETECTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1999-12-25:\n Micheal Delariva - was found dead in his apartment. A tattoo artist, Delariva had sketched depictions of SCP-6682 in the weeks leading up to his death. Cause of death: Traumatic head injury through blunt force.\n\n\n1999-12-29:\n Ryan Townhend - missing after a call with the Suicide Prevention Hotline. Police dispatched to home found no signs of Townshed. The body was found 2 years later. The body had been skinned through unknown means. A close friend of Delariva, possible witness. Cause of death: Severe blood loss.\n\n\n2000-2-17:\n Elaine Visck - found dead in her home. Using a makeshift noose, Visck's body was found 2 weeks after the estimated time of death. Subject had recently divorced her husband of 17 years. Connection to SCP-6682 suggested through a suicide note discussing a figure of similar physical description to SCP-6682. Cause of death: Asphyxiation.\n\n\n2000-2-27:\n Rodger Visck - found dead in workplace bathroom. Had only part of the body recovered from the scene. Most of body is liquefied. The first recorded sighting of SCP-6682 was photographed in Visck's clothing. SCP-6682 appears human in this depiction. Cause of death: Unknown.\n\n\n2000-5-2:\n \nI told him he meant the world to me.\n Subject's body found missing teeth, eyes, and the left leg. Subject's eyes had been filled in with an unknown black substance. Foundation investigation begins. Connection to SCP-6682 was discovered after SCP subject confessed to his \npunishment.\n Cause of death: Single self-inflicted gunshot wound to side of head.\n\n\n2001-1-1:\n Nina Visck - found critically injured behind a nightclub. Subject had received 28 stab wounds to the chest and stomach. Died in ICU 4 hours post-discovery. Cause of death: \ndisobedience.\n\n\n2002-3-1:\n Joseph Harris and Veronica Poli - committed murder-suicide or double suicide with a former companion. SCP-6682 caught briefly on a hidden surveillance camera in Poli's home. MTF Psi-21 \"Hard Count\" is dispatched.

SCP-6682 was successfully recontained following breach cleanup without incident. \nUpdating containment procedures is not necessary.\n\n\nMaintenance note:\n The fire started at 07:01, the exact time I booted the terminal that manages CCTV feed.

A lockdown was not initially considered, however, it was discovered that the on-duty guard, Blake Roberts, was not at his post, and all relevant CCTV cameras were found to be powered down. Following this discovery, a partial lockdown was initiated.\n\n\n03:20:\n A guard failed to update their status near the Light Containment Zone's main armory.

You have successfully managed and maintained SCP-6682 for this long, and kept it satisfied and compliant. Now, I've just finished cleaning up the largest breach in 4 years, and I've got to explain how 4 on-site personnel got killed by your, ahem\u2026 negligence. This isn't like you. So.

Blake Roberts was a loyal man. I was the one who personally recommended his position at the Foundation.

He was committed to the Foundation's cause and was an iron-willed, intelligent, and strong man. I do not know what the hell this thing said or did to him in order to cause a reaction like this. It is almost inconceivable. I feel a sense of betrayal, a sense of loss, and most of all, disappointment. We should have taken better care of this situation. We should have noticed the discrepancies. We need to encourage reporting every single little thing we notice. We need to be able to bother our superiors about things that do not seem to have immediate consequence.

There's a limit to distance, thank Heavens. To be generous, it's around 5 meters, so let's double that and make that the exclusion radius. And don't let it say anything else to ANYONE. Blake Roberts was the toughest man I knew. If this beast could cause him to act in this manner, who knows what may happen to someone less loyal to our cause?\"\n\n-Dr. Atkins\n\n\nOwing to SCP-6682's recent behaviors, the risk that it presents in the case of an escape, and the scale of the associated containment breach, SCP-6682 has been approved redesignation as Keter.\n\n\nSCP-6682 has been escorted to a Class IV-SC containment cell. After the strangulation of G. [DATA EXPUNGED], this has been upgraded to a Class V-SC containment cell. SCP-6682, since the incident, has become extremely violent. The use of firearms to subdue SCP-6682 has been approved. It has been deemed impossible to monitor SCP-6682 through any realistic means other than human observation, as other formats are corruptible by SCP-6682. As such, a small viewport will be built, and a periscope will be installed, allowing monitoring from a safe distance. SCP-6682 is to be provided with no further contact or information.\n\n\n\"Some may see the new procedures as overkill. They are overkill. I will have no more deaths attributed to my name.\" -Dr. Atkins to Site Director Harris following the incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYou.
