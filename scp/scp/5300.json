The Foundation's resources aren't unlimited, so why should we use them to seek out anomalies we wouldn't even know existed if we didn't look? In the short term, it appears to have little benefit; however, in the long term, it will prove to be essential.\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges we face as an organization which, at its core, strives to control change is determining what \nshould\n change. Where is the line drawn between anomalous and mundane? When should science be top secret, and when should it be used to advance humanity?\n\n\nThese questions do not always have answers. But one thing my colleagues and I are absolutely certain of is that, if humanity is to have a future, it will lie beyond Earth.\n\n\nTo date, a number of extraterrestrial anomalies have been documented and contained, but the majority of the Foundation\u2019s work has been terrestrial in nature. Looking to the future, a dedicated space program will become exponentially more important. It is our job to clear the way for humanity\u2019s advancement so that, when future generations look back through their history and forward to their own prospects, it will cohere into something that makes sense; to explore the darkness so others can expand into the light; and, as always, to secure, contain, and protect.\n\n\nTowards this end, Project Briareus is being significantly expanded. All staff will be required to read the logs from the mission which took place at the end of last year. This will give you an example of the sort of things we expect to encounter out there and an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. The logs have been attached to this message.\n\n\nGood luck to you all.\n\n\u2013 Zeig Skannon, Project Briareus Director\n\n\n\n\n1 attachment: \nbriareus_3_logs.fdoc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5299\n | SCP-5300 | \nSCP-5301\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5300\n\" by MirageTD & Habitual_Snubnose, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
