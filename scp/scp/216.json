Access requires Level 2 clearance. Insertion of recording devices into SCP-216 is prohibited without O5 approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-216 is a 35.6\u00a0cm (14 in) high iron safe with a multiple-dial combination lock. The lock has 7 dials each with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. The combination cannot be changed while the door is open. The weight of the device appears to fluctuate in an obtuse manner (see document 88-B).\n\n\nThe door of SCP-216 can always be opened, but the accessible interior space appears to change depending on the currently entered combination. Objects placed inside SCP-216 may be accessed by re-entering the combination that was configured when the object was inserted. Objects retrieved from SCP-216 appear to be undamaged by the device.\n\n\nIt is speculated that every possible lock combination results in a different interior, and that there are approximately 4 million available compartments. It is unknown how many objects currently reside inside SCP-216.\n\n\nAn engraving found on the bottom of the safe reads \"3/4\". It has been hypothesized that the compartments of SCP-216 are shared with three other devices of a similar nature. This hypothesis is consistent with the findings reported in document 88-B.\n\n\n\n\nDocument # 88-A:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Initial test log\n\n\n- Combination lock set to 6692724 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.\n\n- 1 notebook and pencil placed inside and door closed.\n\n- Combination lock set to 6692725 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.\n\n- Combination lock re-set to 6692724 and door opened. Notebook and pencil retrieved from compartment.\n\n\nNote: \n\"SCP-216 appears to be a very efficient storage solution.\"\n - Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nDocument # 88-B:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Test log\n\n\nTesting the effect of inserted items on the SCP's total mass.\n\n\n- Total mass of unit before inserting item: 935.877\u00a0kg\n\n- Notebook and pencil (total mass 350\u00a0g) inserted into SCP-216 and door closed.\n\n- Total mass of unit after inserting item: 935.965\u00a0kg\n\n\nExpected mass: 936.227\u00a0kg\n\nActual mass: 935.965\u00a0kg\n\nDifference: 262\u00a0g\n\n\nTesting shows that SCP-216 takes on approximately 25% of the mass of its contents, suggesting the mass is distributed evenly between SCP-216 and the three other hypothesized devices.\n\n\n\n\nDocument # 122-A:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Test log\n\n\nCompartments 0000000-0000206 checked for contents.

Upon the door being opened, it attacked and killed Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and mutilated two nearby D-class personnel before being shot five times by guards. Autopsy of the wolverine revealed no anomalies.\n\n\nSubsequent examination of compartment 0000409 has revealed it now contains only loose wolverine hair, with residual traces of wolverine urine and wolverine anal musk.\n\n\n\n\nDocument # 160-A:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Test log\n\n\nCompartment 0000456: A fully loaded Glock 19 handgun with a round in the chamber, and one regular flavor Klondike Bar ice cream dessert. The ice cream bar was not melted, cold to the touch and remained so as long as it was in the compartment. It was removed for inspection, and began to melt within 2 minutes. It was placed back in the compartment; the door closed for 3 hours, and then reopened. The ice cream bar was in the same slightly melted state as when it was placed back three hours prior. The ice cream bar was removed, placed in a freezer in the nearby 2nd floor cafeteria for one hour. After one hour it was placed back into the compartment with the handgun and the door closed.\n\n\n\n\nDocument # 161-A:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Test log\n\n\nChamber 0000501, confirmed to be empty, had one (1) standard Foundation GPS unit placed inside it.

When compartments 0000332 to 0000398 were opened, individual body parts were found corresponding to an unknown male, arranged in the same order as found in experiment 152-D, including the liver, spleen and lungs. All previous traces of tissue from experiment 152-D, which had not been cleaned, were found to have been sterilized from these compartments. Pursuant to request for O5 directive, body parts were placed back into their compartments.
