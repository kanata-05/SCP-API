During SCP-3248-1 events, the windows of SCP-3248 are to be sealed, and soundproofing equipment within SCP-3248 is to be activated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3248 is a two story house located in Evansville, Indiana. SCP-3248 was previously owned by Dr. Herald Sullivan, a medical practitioner specializing in surgery. No links between Dr. Sullivan and any other anomalous phenomena have been discovered.\n\n\nOn the 10th of every month at exactly 0400 hours local time, an SCP-3248-1 event will begin. The interior of the house will be remodeled to resemble its appearance on October 10th, 1979. Furniture will appear and disappear during this period, and any personnel within SCP-3248 during an SCP-3248-1 event are considered lost until its conclusion. Entry into SCP-3248 is impossible at this time.\n\n\nDuring an SCP-3248-1 event, Dr. Sullivan and his family\n1\n will materialize in their beds, and awake soon afterwards. The family will set up their house for an upcoming party with several colleagues and friends. The party will commence at approximately 1800 hours local time. Guests will materialize at the front step of SCP-3248, and will be allowed in.\n\n\nAll SCP-3248-1 events have been nearly identical, save for the occurrence of an SCP-3248-2 event. At some point during the festivities, one of the partygoers will murder Dr. Sullivan. The method of murder and the partygoer that commits the murder has differed for every SCP-3248-2 event. The partygoers will react with shock, and will attempt to call authorities or, in some cases, attempt to leave\n2\n. The SCP-3248-1 event will always end at midnight\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Attachment:\u00a0Abridged\u00a0Event\u00a0Timeline\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation has been aware of SCP-3248's anomalous properties since its discovery in 1985. An abridged log of SCP-3248-1 and SCP-3248-2 events have been documented below.

Dr. Sullivan had relocated himself to his kitchen during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/10/1989\n\n\nEdward Davis\n\n\nBreaking down the door with a sledgehammer and crushing Dr. Sullivan's head.\n\n\nDr. Sullivan had hidden himself in the bathroom during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/10/1991\n\n\nBertha Sullivan\n\n\nIgniting Dr. Sullivan using a matchstick.\n\n\nSCP-3248 caught on fire during this time. However, at the end of the SCP-3248-1 event, all damage to SCP-3248 was repaired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/10/1992\n\n\nSharon Garcia\n\n\nDrowning Dr. Sullivan in his toilet.\n\n\nDr. Sullivan was hiding in the bathroom again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/10/1993\n\n\nRobert Brown\n\n\nSecuring Dr. Sullivan to the ground with rope and sawing off his legs with a hacksaw.\n\n\nDr. Sullivan attempted to resist this action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/10/1994\n\n\nEdmond Sullivan\n4\n\n\nRitually sacrificing Dr. Sullivan using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nFirst noted use of ritual sacrifice and an SCP object in an SCP-3248-2 event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/10/1997\n\n\nJames Sullivan\n\n\nSecuring Dr. Sullivan to the ground and carving a symbol belonging to [DATA EXPUNGED] using his fingernails.

Mark Sullivan then picks the skin off of Dr. Sullivan's face and consumes it. Dr. Sullivan eventually dies of blood loss.\n\n\nDr. Sullivan did not resist during this event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 01:\n Further Notes\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sullivan held a party on October 10th, 1979, in SCP-3248 before it gained its anomalous properties.\n\n\nThe guests at this party and the guests of SCP-3248-1 events differed greatly.\n\n\nInvestigation into guests of SCP-3248-1 has revealed that all died between October 10th, 1979, and November 23rd, 1983. All were also patients of Dr. Sullivan at one point.\n\n\nFurther investigation using advanced autopsy procedures on recoverable cadavers revealed that all of these guests died within three days of their medical appointments with Dr. Sullivan, and had SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n5\n in circulation.\n\n\nDr. Sullivan disappeared on November 23rd, 1983. His cadaver was later found in a nearby river. Cause of death could not be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. His wife, Bertha Sullivan, and his two children, James Sullivan and Mark Sullivan.\n\n\n2\n. It is of note that SCP-3248 cannot be exited after the SCP-3248-2 event.\n\n\n3\n. Similarities between SCP-3248-1 events and the scripts of \nSCP-453\n has been noted. An investigation into whether the two anomalies are derivatives of the same phenomenon is ongoing.\n\n\n4\n.
