SCP-1192 is to be provided with several pencils and pages of paper to allow it to communicate.\n\n\nIn the case that SCP-1192 becomes belligerent, mild sedatives may be introduced into its food and water supply under close veterinary supervision.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1192 is a juvenile male Gang-gang Cockatoo (\nCallocephalon fimbriatum\n), a species normally native to south-east Australia, approximately 33.5\u00a0cm in length.\n\n\nSCP-1192 appears to be sapient and exhibits intelligence and common knowledge consistent with that of a human child between the ages of six (6) and eight (8). SCP-1192 is unusually disheveled as it appears to be unable or unwilling to preen itself, and has difficulty flying despite being essentially healthy and uninjured. Close examinations have shown a slight, healed-over contusion on the back of SCP-1192's head, but no internal injury or damage was ever found.\n\n\nSCP-1192 was discovered and brought into containment by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, who at the time was embedded as an undercover agent in the Newark Police Department in New Jersey. It is believed at this time that SCP-1192 began following Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and trying to attract his attention because of the perception of an authority figure in police uniform. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 became suspicious due to SCP-1192's unusual species and erratic behavior and sent a request for assistance; a Foundation containment team was dispatched and was able to detain SCP-1192 and bring it to Site \u2588\u2588 for examination.\n\n\nAddendum 1192-01:\n Experiment Log 1192-01\n\n\nShortly after initial containment, experimentation was performed in which SCP-1192 was introduced to a multitude of objects in a controlled environment in order to deduce its abilities. Upon being introduced to the testing chamber, SCP-1192 immediately gravitated to a pencil and paper and began to attempt to write crude sentences. At this point, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was brought in in an attempt to communicate with SCP-1192.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1192\n: (writes \"who ar u\" [sic])\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n: I am Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
