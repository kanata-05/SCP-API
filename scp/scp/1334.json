The immediate property surrounding the apartment complex is to be fenced off, under the guise of ongoing renovation. During daylight hours, two guards posing as building contractors are to be stationed at the main gateway; the outside of the building is to be monitored at all times by camera surveillance.\n\n\nAny personnel intending to enter SCP-1334 must undergo preliminary training and wear only authorized attire, which will be provided, when entering the building. All interactions with SCP-1334-1 and any observed differences in the interior of SCP-1334 are to be thoroughly documented.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1334 is a six-story apartment building located in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 province of China. The exterior of the complex is nondescript, and the interior rooms each contain specifically arranged items, including:\n\n\n\n\npairs of chopsticks, bottles of wine, articles of jewelry, and chinaware arranged in multiples of two\n\n\nbundles of incense sticks, office supplies (pens, pencils, notepads), and children\u2019s toys (marbles, animal figurines, etc), arranged in multiples of three\n\n\nsmall potted plants, empty fishbowls, bronze sculptures, ashtrays, and bamboo wind chimes arranged in multiples of five\n\n\nstacks of paper money and coins arranged in stacks of eight (It was also noted that all clocks in the complex, both analog and digital, had been set to 08:08. None of the clocks were observed to be functional.)\n\n\n\n\nItems placed in groups that are removed from SCP-1334 disintegrate upon crossing the threshold of the bottom floor; the same result occurs if the objects are defenestrated. Replacements will appear roughly 8 hours after removal. Grouped items that are rearranged will automatically return to their original grouping.\n\n\nSCP-1334 is currently inhabited by a humanoid figure, noted to closely resemble the late \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 who was listed as the contracted tenant of the building\u2019s sixth story apartment. This entity, designated as SCP-1334-1, acts in a manner consistent with complaints filed by the apartment complex\u2019s other tenants, who described Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 as \u201ceccentric\u201d and \u201cdisruptive to others\u2019 households\u201d. Retrieved hospital records indicate that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 suffered from paranoia and was discovered missing prior to his 44th birthday, and was later presumed dead. Though SCP-1334-1 appears corporeal, infrared scans of the apartment and complex during sightings do not indicate any heat signatures save for those of Foundation operatives.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1 is believed to be the cause of the disappearances of the former tenants of the building (as well as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a janitor and the landlord of the apartment building, who both visited the complex following the initial disappearances). After these disappearances came to Foundation attention and subsequent containment intervention occurred, Foundation agents sent to investigate SCP-1334 repeatedly encountered SCP-1334-1, who would inform them that their attire was \u201cunlucky\u201d due to accessories or thread count. All agents who encountered SCP-1334-1 reported dizziness and nausea upon leaving the apartment; these symptoms were determined to be due to low red blood cell count. The cause of these effects is unknown.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-1334-1:\n After three successful agent interactions with SCP-1334-1, the following interview was conducted by Agent Tai Yang Shen, playing the part of a maintenance inspector checking on a broken window on the fourth floor. Prior to approaching SCP-1334, Agent Shen was given a set of clothes tailored specifically for the experiment.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The following partial transcript has been translated from Mandarin.\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n Hello Sir.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n Hello. Why are you visiting this place?\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n It is time to do maintenance on the building, and the other residents have made complaints about their apartments last time. I am here to inspect.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n There are no other residents here.\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n Is that true? Sorry, maybe I got the wrong building. But I am sure that my company was responsible for this place.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n The other residents left. Since then, not even one person has come here.\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n I see. Still, I need to take a look around. The window on one floor is broken.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n [pause] Which floor?\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n If you step outside, you can see it. The one up there.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n Sir, do you know number meanings?\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n I think numbers are very important. [rapidly knocks on wall eight times]\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n Very good! You are careful. Knowing number meanings makes life easier. Please enter and inspect the building. I will show you where the window is.\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n Thank you.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n You are more careful than the last person. They wore a flower with four petals.\n\n\nAgent Shen:\n Really? That is very unlucky.\n\n\nSCP-1334-1:\n I also told them that. They did not listen.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-1334-2:\n After several subsequent \u201cinspection\u201d visits to SCP-1334, several instances of graffiti (all using the same reddish-brown paint) were discovered in various places throughout the apartment complex. A partial log, translated from simplified Chinese characters, follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ceiling is a wall. Five is a lucky number. Every room is safe.\u201d (painted onto the back of each door of every room in the building)\n\n\n\u201cThey did not listen to my warning. They left first.\u201d (painted over the doorway of the fourth story apartment)\n\n\n\u201cI am still here. I will always be here, because I understand numbers. I understand how to use them.\u201d (painted onto the bathroom mirror of the sixth story apartment)\n\n\n\u201cTo let numbers become your life is to let your life become numbers.\u201d (painted across the living room wall in the fifth story apartment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-1334-3:\n During one visit on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent Shen did not encounter SCP-1334-1 and proceeded to enter the complex to change a lightbulb near the stairway. Under the guise of ascertaining that the lightbulb was installed effectively, Shen took a picture that included some new graffiti that had appeared on the walls. Said graffiti was written in what appeared to be fresh blood, and comprised entirely of long strings of numbers, each roughly 0.3 meters tall and consisting mainly of the Chinese character eight (\u516b, b\u0101) while the character four (\u56db, s\u00ec) was wholly absent. Upon the next visit, SCP-1334-1 greeted Agent Shen as before, and the graffiti was no longer present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1333\n | SCP-1334 | \nSCP-1335\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1334\n\" by Zyn, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
