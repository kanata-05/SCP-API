Access to the Foundation observation post in Antuco is restricted to Foundation personnel with 5/5227 clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoliage in Antuco.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-5227 was an anomalous weather formation centered around Antuco, an abandoned Chilean village, and lasted from June 8th to 10th, 1976. SCP-5227 manifested as a fog descending on Antuco and completely covered the village, drastically reducing visibility and communications. The anomaly was originally identified as such due to its observational anomaly and rapid formation\u2014 weather sensors at Facility 57, 23km from Antuco, depicted SCP-5227 as a static blur during its three-minute formation (1:07AM - 1:10AM local time). Attempts to hail the Foundation observation post in Antuco through radio resulted in failure. Further testing confirmed SCP-5227 had the anomalous capability to block radio transmissions.\n\n\nA 3-man expedition from MTF PI-3 \"Garcas Oligarcas\" was planned to ascertain the status of Antuco. Several hours before departure, another agent was added to the expedition. The thick forest surrounding Antuco and the exceedingly low visibility made vehicular and aerial travel infeasible. The team departed Facility 57 on foot at T+6 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5227.1\n\n\nEXPEDITION LOGS \u2014 6.8.1976\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Click\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0credentials\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPEDITION LOG EXCERPTS\n\n\nCHILEAN INTERIOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF PI-3 \"GARCAS OLIGARCAS\"\n\n\n\n\n\u03c03-ALPHA - VALENTINO SCIPIONI \n(SOURCE)\n\n\n\u03c03-BETA - PEDRO CASEROS\n\n\n\u03c03-GAMMA - ALEJANDRO PETROCCHI\n\n\n\u03c03-DELTA - DAMI\u00c1N GARL\u00c9S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN EXCERPT\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n[Team is hiking through the jungle.

It's a good place for an installation, though. Antuco's been abandoned since before I was born.\n\n\nCASEROS:\n Why?\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Beats me. It was barely ever big enough to get on any maps, and then over a few months all the people just seem to have moved away.

The one-room building contains a bunk bed, two flipped chairs, several steel lockers, and a table covered in defunct communication equipment.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Get in.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n What the hell is going on? How do you have Level-5 Clearance?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n I'm on your side, I swear. But for now, we need to get away from that fog. You saw what it did to Pedro.\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S shuts the door once all three have entered. He moves to the table, inspecting the equipment.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Can you explain what the fuck is going on here, Damian?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n With all due respect, Captain, that's classified. All you need to know is that people much higher up than you have very specific instructions about what is going to happen here. You are obligated to help me stop this mess.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n We saw the fog's source, it was coming from the center of town. Why are we all the way out here?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n This is the best spot to get a signal out. A minor weakness in the anomaly's structural integrity, exploited using paratechnology.\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S reaches into his bag and pulls out a small spherical device with a blue light.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n What is that?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n It is a radio signaller, amplified using thamaturgy. Just enough to punch through SCP-5227.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n Who are you signalling to?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Fifty-seven. More specifically to an air squadron stationed there on standby. Once they get the signal, they'll give us a small delay and then bomb this hellhole to kingdom come.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Why? What are you trying to destroy?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n That's classified.\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S turns away to the table to begin setting up the device.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Okay. All I know is that suddenly the greenhorn is claiming to be a Level 5 secret agent, one of my team members is dead in the dust by your hand, you won't let us even investigate what's causing this. Our job. I don't know \nwho\n you are, but\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n I'm afraid this is a matter of internal Foundati-\n\n\n[Gunshot. GARL\u00c9S' calf spurts blood and he crashes to the floor, dropping the device.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n FUCK!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Sorry\u2026 sir, but you've killed a Foundation operator and are hindering the proper investigation of the anomaly. I am hereby relieving you of command. We're finding out what's causing this. The wound's not lethal, and there's a first aid kit in the locker.\n\n\n[PETROCCHI advances and takes the transmitter from the floor.]\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n And we're taking this.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n You\u2026 you two don't know what you're doing. You're going to ruin everything. I'm ordering you to stop-\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n I'm sorry, Damian.

I just don't know how to be comfortable with what we're doing. I'm a religious man, you know that. It's hard to be a man of God in this Foundation, but I try. I pray for my soul, and everyone else's. This is\u2026 blasphemous.\n\n\nWhat they're asking us to do \u2014 it's not a question of technology. We have the technology, we've had it since we took it from the Axis after the armistice. But we've never needed it. I understand that the Foundation is faced with containing more and more, for lack of a better word, theological threats. But we have to ask ourselves if fighting fire with fire is a good idea.

And, frankly, the fact that we've created a prototype at all is a testament to the skill of the team.\n\n\nThere is simply far too much invested into this to cancel now.

Which means that\u2026\n\n\n[A loud rumbling is heard. Industrial fans set into the grilled floor begin turning, quickly sucking away the fog. In a few seconds, the majority of the fog has been removed and the facility is visible in its whole. Pipes and computer displays cover the walls, focusing in the center of the room around a large industrial vat set into the floor. The vat is filled with a greyish-green liquid and fog rises from its surface steadily. A massive metal cross is suspended above it, upside down and coated in a brown fluid, which slowly drips into the vat. GARL\u00c9S is in the doorway, wearing a gas mask and clutching his thigh.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Damn. I was hoping you'd have missed it.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You all did a good job hiding the place.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Hiding things from the rest of the Foundation is my job, Valentino.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n You're all fucking insane.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Alejandro-\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n No, really. I don't believe in God, but I know that you don't play with things you don't understand. People stationed at this outpost have the highest turnover rate in the sector. I always thought it was because of the isolation, but no, it's because you buried a fucking monster underneath them! How many people have ended up like Pedro?!\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Look. I'm sorry about Pedro, I am. He was a casualty, and it was my fault. But I didn't make the thing that did that to him.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n And where is it, huh? You just ditched it down here after you were done playing God?\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S motions at the vat. It bubbles quietly.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Jesus Christ.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n \nPuta madre.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Your indignation isn't going to help anyone, Alejandro. Who are you gonna tell? The police? The Council approved this, you can't change anything.\n\n\nPETROCCHI:\n I can't imagine the Ethics Committee approved it. I bet that'd be interesting from them to know, that-\n\n\n[Gunshot. PETROCCHI falls to the floor, a hole in his forehead. SCIPIONI draws his gun.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n FUCK! What the fuck are you doing?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n My job, Valentino. Just put down the gu-\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You've killed two of my people already. I'm not stupid, the Council will have me disappeared for thi-\n\n\n[An explosion from outside rocks the building. Both stumble. A large portion of the ceiling gives out, revealing the foggy sky overhead. Planes are faintly visible through the haze.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n What the hell?!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n I called in the airstrike while Alejandro had you distracted.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Are you insane?! We'll be killed!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n I'm not being disappeared by the Council, Dami\u00e1n. I'm-\n\n\n[Another explosion rings out, this one heavily muffled.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Tha- what?\n\n\n[Through the hole, it is visible that all the large bombs are being suspended in the fog until they detonate. None are able to reach the facility. Inside, the vat bubbles.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n It's\u2026 protecting itself.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Then it's sentient.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n And intelligent. It knows what bombs are. You might've left an infant down here then, but\u2026 it's not a baby anymore.\n\n\n[The bombs suspended in the air suddenly flip, before rocketing back up through the sky and colliding with one of the bombers. The plane violently fulminates in a burst of flame. The other bombs in the air also flip, but do not ascend.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Fuck! Jesus Christ, it's murderous!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n We attacked it with planes and bombs, Dami\u00e1n! What is it supposed to do!?\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S cocks his pistol. SCIPIONI does the same.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Move, Valentino! That's an order!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You're not actually trying to kill it, are you? Are you \ninsane?\n What makes you think you can kill a god?\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Why on Earth are you \nprotecting it\n? You saw what it did to Pedro, to the observers, to the flight crew! Suppressing things like these is your job!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n Creating them isn't. And \nyou\n killed Pedro, you son of a bitch.\n\n\n[GARL\u00c9S advances as SCIPIONI backs up towards the vat.]\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n You're compromised. Just like he was. Protecting it against all odds. Now move.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You made a god, Dami\u00e1n. You can't just put a bullet in its head and expect it to die.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Let me fix it, goddammit!\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You're just afraid. You brought a god into this world, you did experiments on it, you left it in a vat for \nyears\n, and now you're afraid that it's violent? You cannot weaponize a tool that you're expecting to be stabbed in the back with! And you sure as hell can't get rid of it this easy.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n For all we know it's not even a fucking god. Just some fucked up \nthing\n that we brewed in a vat and decided to deify.\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n It doesn't matter if it's actually a god or not. You- the entire Council fears this thing like a god. It doesn't matter what it is, it might as well be a god. You all gave it this kind of power. You can't control what it does with it anymore. Symbols have power, you know that.\n\n\nGARL\u00c9S:\n Then what the fuck are we supposed to do? Just not be scared of it?\n\n\n[SCIPIONI's heel reaches the rim of the vat.]\n\n\nSCIPIONI:\n You can't have a god with just fear. You need faith. Trust me.\n\n\n[SCIPIONI spins backward, raising his pistol and emptying the magazine at the chain suspending the inverted cross above the vat. The chain breaks, dropping the cross into the vat where it begins sinking. An infantile screeching rings out as the bombs suspended in the sky begin detonating one by one. The fluid in the vat, displaced by the cross, begins flooding into the chamber. Camera feed abruptly cuts out at the same time as the shrieking.]\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the termination of the camera feed, all bombs suspended in the air above Antuco simultaneously detonated at low altitude, out of range of aircraft. The exterior facade of Satellite Facility 57-Beta collapsed, and ground troops conducted an excavation operation to breach into the building.\n\n\nThe body of Supervisory Agent Dami\u00e1n Garl\u00e9s was discovered; the cause of death was determined to have been respiration of the vat amniotic fluid. The vat itself was completely drained. Captain Valentino Scipioni was found at the bottom in a state of shock, sitting next to an unidentified desiccated corpse crushed by the large metal cross. Captain Scipioni has been amnesticized following a full medical recovery.\n\n\nProject Divinidad is considered \nclosed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+283\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5226\n | SCP-5227 | \nSCP-5228\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5227\n\" by Rounderhouse, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
