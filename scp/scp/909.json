No writing materials are to be allowed inside the cell. A short summary of SCP-909's current situation is to be pasted on the wall beside the bed. Extras are to be provided if the previous summary is removed by SCP-909. SCP-909 is to be fed three times daily with any peanut-free meal. If SCP-909 is seen attempting to write or draw, he is to be incapacitated through non-lethal means.\n\n\nCurrently experimentation with SCP-909's effects has been discontinued, due to risk of containment breach. Research may be conducted if the current Site Director's approval is given.\n\n\nAs of current regulations on \"Misters\", SCP-909 is to be contained in Hall \u2588\u2588 of Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-909 appears to be a young adult Caucasian male suffering from permanent anterograde amnesia. SCP-909 seems to be aware of his condition but cannot recall experiences past this, aside from memories gained due to SCP-909's effects.\n\n\nSCP-909's anomalous effects become apparent when it writes down any of the experiences still in its working memory. When described through writing, experiences immediately enter SCP-909's long term memory. However, the experience disappears from the memory of all other persons involved.\n\n\nSCP-909 is allergic to peanuts and will go into anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of any peanut products.\n\n\nSCP-909 was discovered at Entrance [EXPUNGED] of Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum 909-1:\n The words \"Mr. Forgetful, from Little Misters \u00ae by Dr. Wondertainment\" are tattooed upon SCP-909's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909 had been wearing a 3-piece suit with the brand name \"Doctor's Orders\" sewn into the tag. Foundation personnel have yet to find a clothing company operating under this name.\n\n\nAddendum 909-2:\n Further examination of SCP-909's clothing revealed a list of other possible instances of anomalous humanoids similar to SCP-909 (See Document 909-a) inside the left pants pocket.\n\n\nAddendum 909-3:\n Interview Log\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-909\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-909 was put into initial observation for seven hours, during which the subject's anterograde amnesia and relation to \nSCP-905\n were discovered.
