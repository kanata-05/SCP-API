SCP-8762 is permitted to request activities to maintain its morale. However, any activities posing potential harm to SCP-8762 are to be denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8762\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8762 is a \nmiddle aged\n man of indeterminate age who identifies himself as \"Steve\".\n.\nSCP-8762 has responded to a variety of names, including, but not limited to; Hubert, Larry, John, Bob, and Juggletron.\n No records of SCP-8762 exist in any known country, region, or sovereign state. Physically, SCP-8762 is non-anomalous and has the same physiological requirements as typical humans.\n\n\nSCP-8762 has one noticeable, yet extremely potent anomalous effect: whenever SCP-8762 is within close proximity of any anomalous location or object, their abilities will temporarily cease; the reason behind this is currently unknown. Anomalous personnel will remain conscious, although any abilities will cease until SCP-8762 exits the anomalies proximity. SCP-8762 must be awake, conscious, and in a healthy mental state for this to occur. \n.\nAlthough entering REM sleep doesn't negate this effect, medically induced comas appear to do so.\n\n\nSCP-8762 was first discovered at Site-01. Camera footage showed SCP-8762 wandering through the hallways for fifteen minutes, appearing extremely confused. After being noticed by several security guards, SCP-8762 was detained and interviewed. Extensive testing revealed that SCP-8762 was not associated with any known group of interest.\n\n\nSCP-8762 emits no Humes, Akiva radiation, or any forms of anomalous energy, thereby eliminating the possibility of it being a weapon. After it temporarily neutralized SCP-001, it was designated as SCP-8762.\n\n\nBelow is an interview log between SCP-8762 and Foundation researcher Elizabeth Carter.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Elizabeth Carter\n\n\n \n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8762\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEGIN LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Good afternoon Steve, hope everything is going well with you.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n It's going.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Excellent. I'm going to ask you a few things if that's alright with you, need to learn a bit about you and whatnot.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Go ahead.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Can you tell me about your background? Where are you from?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n No clue.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Pardon?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Just woke up here, really.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n You don't remember anything about your past? Family, friends, occupation?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n No, sorry.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762 picks its nose, looking around the room for a moment.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n \u2026let's discuss your daily routine. What do you usually do during the day?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n I wake up, have breakfast, walk around a bit, maybe read a book or watch TV, then I have lunch, walk around some more, have dinner.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n And?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Then I go to bed.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter pauses.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n So you don't remember anything before appearing.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Seems so.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n But you do have a plan for every day, despite the fact you don't remember why you're here? Or anything?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Just what comes to mind when you mention it, can't really remember doing that.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n I see. Do you have any hobbies? \nInterests?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Not really. I just do normal things.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n What exactly are \"normal\" things?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Watching TV, mainly.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n What do you watch? Movies? Any shows?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n The weather channel.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter clenches her fist around her pen. SCP-8762 does not notice.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n How do you feel about not having any history or memories prior to your appearance here? For all that we know, you could have a family searching for you, or maybe a big career, or-\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n I guess it's a bit strange, but I don't think about it much.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Carter:\n \u2026And if we were to ask you to stay here for an extended period, how would you feel about that?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8762:\n Don't have anywhere else to be.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing confirmation of SCP-8762's anomalous traits, it was exposed to several minor anomalies to test the limits of its abilities.\n\n\n\n\nTest 1\n\n\nAnomaly:\n \nSCP-6161\n, a cake knife that causes all cut objects to become cake.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-8762 used SCP-6161 on various items, all resulting in nothing remarkable. He frowned, proclaiming that \"You me promised cake, this is a knife.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 5\n\n\nAnomaly:\n \nSCP-8022\n, a clay brick. Whenever it strikes an individual, they will vividly dream.

Upon attempting for several minutes, \n.\nDuring this time, SCP-8762 held out its hands and loudly grunted, sweating and growing red.\n it responded, exhausted; \"That's enough thinking for now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 11\n\n\nAnomaly:\n \nSCP-113\n, a small gemstone capable of causing anyone who touches it to swap biological sexes.\n\n\nResults:\n Results pending. SCP-8762's sex is currently unknown, as all biological scans give mixed results. When asked, it replied with \"I'm John.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 13\n\n\nAnomaly:\n \nSCP-6914\n, a small sign that says \"KEEP OFF GRASS\". If individuals step on grass located near SCP-6914, they will then be struck by lightning.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-8762 proceeded to step on the grass with no issues, although later stated that it felt \"a bit inconsiderate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 44\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-173\n\n\nResults:\n Initially, SCP-8762 stood within the same room as SCP-173 and did not report any findings. Shortly afterwards, however, personnel report a mild swelling in SCP-8762's face, which it attributed to \"a mild peanut allergy\".\n.\nSCP-8762 had no known allergies, nor has it eaten any peanuts.\n \n Moments later, SCP-8762 spontaneously combusted.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its untimely death, personnel discovered that its remains still shared the same properties as the anomaly itself. Lead theories suggest that SCP-8762 \"absorbed\" the properties of other anomalies. Because of this, smaller fragments of it are still capable of weakening anomalous effects.
