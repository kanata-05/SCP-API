SCP-8247 instances are to be provided with appropriate food, water, and enrichment daily. As SCP-8247 instances can transform at will, Foundation Personnel are to approach instances of SCP-8247 with extreme caution. Access to the enclosures outside of providing SCP-8247 instances with their daily needs is not permitted.\n\n\nReports of wild animals and/or house pets that show behaviors or abilities that align with documented information about SCP-8247 instances are to be monitored by the SCP-8247 research team in cases of possible containment breaches.\n\n\nAll witnesses of SCP-8247 are to be administered amnestics and released.\n\n\nDiamond Summers may be allowed to visit SCP-8247-A27 for three hours twice a day during its meal times. Summers is permitted to feed SCP-8247-A by hand.\n\n\nDescription:\n\u00a0SCP-8247 refers to an anomalous subspecies of felines. SCP-8247 instances possess the ability to transform into a Bengal Tiger at will. SCP-8247 instances have often been observed to display violent tendencies, often attacking and consuming other animals and humans. Despite their primal behaviors, instances demonstrate behaviors of a typical house cat regardless of which form they are currently in. SCP-8247 instances do not require raw meat and are capable of surviving on processed cat food, although larger portions are required and instances still exhibit a preference for fresh meat. Despite anatomy differences, SCP-8247 maintain behavioral traits influenced by the anatomy of big cats, such as the inability to purr except when exhaling. There are currently 247 instances of SCP-8247 in containment.\n\n\nAddendum-1-Findings:\n The following are relevant media discovered of a notable SCP-8247 instance (dubbed SCP-8247-A27) found by the Foundation in deduced chronological order. This includes social media posts on the platform \nInstagram\n and journal logs by its owner, Diamond Summers. This is the only SCP-8247 instance known to be a house pet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n249 likes\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n \nToday is our last day in our apartment!

Anyways, I can\u2019t fucking BELIEVE I\u2019m getting evicted from my apartment. And my only option is to move in with my aunt and uncle\n\n\nThey fucking hate me. They\u2019ve always thought internet influencer wasn\u2019t a \u2018real job\u2019. But they offered to let me live with them, probably just so they can boss me around tbh\n\n\nThey've always been so bossy, even when I was a fucking kid. They always yelled at me and called me lazy and shit, and still do. Like they'd even insult my parents for letting me turn out the way I did. Anyway at least I\u2019ve got Meagan, she\u2019s always been so sweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n224 likes\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n \nWe've moved into our new house!

She\u2019s been hissing and scratching my aunt and uncle and once she even bit my aunt. They\u2019re threatening to call animal control if I don\u2019t have her checked out I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do\n\n\nPoor Meagan doesn\u2019t even seem to notice she\u2019s in danger, she\u2019s just been cuddling up with me at night and licking my face\n\n\nI don\u2019t deserve her\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 14th\n\n\nThank fuck I have a job interview in 2 weeks just about. The closer I am to getting a job, the closer I am to getting out of here. Being an influencer is not paying as well as I thought it would. I\u2019m just not popular enough and sponsors are so hard to come by these days. Maybe they were right. Maybe being an influencer isn\u2019t a real job, I shouldn\u2019t have quit my job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 likes\n\n\nmeaganthekittycat\n \nHey guys!

Summers' was later interviewed about SCP-8247-A27. This interview took place before SCP-8247\u2019s file was created.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Diamond Summers\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Cara Sandals\n\n\nForeword:\n Researcher Cara Sandals of the Zoology department at Site-908 was tasked with interviewing Diamond Summers, the owner of SCP-8247-A27.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSandals:\n Hello, Diamond. I appreciate you coming to talk with me about Meagan.\n\n\nSummers:\n Uh\u2026 hello? You said you wanted to like, study her. You\u2019re not going to poke and prod her with needles or anything are you?\n\n\nResearcher Sandals laughs.\n\n\nSandals:\n Oh, no. It\u2019s closer to observing her. But no poking or prodding involved.\n\n\nSummers:\n Good. Also, just for your information, the people she hurt were in self-defense! She doesn\u2019t just attack people for no reason she\u2019s not dangerous just because she\u2019s a tiger!\n\n\nSandals:\n Diamond, I understand your defensiveness, but I\u2019m going to ask you to calm down. I didn\u2019t accuse her of being dangerous. You seem to know a lot about her.\n\n\nSummers:\n Of course I know a lot about her, she\u2019s my cat! I\u2019ve had her since she was a kitten. And are you sure you don\u2019t think she\u2019s dangerous? I don't believe that you don't!\n\n\nSandals:\n While others like Meagan have shown violent tendencies, Meagan herself has not. I\u2019ve worked with animals a long time. I can tell when one is bonded to a human the way Meagan is bonded to you. I do not think she\u2019s dangerous. I think she\u2019s protective.\n\n\nSummers:\n I still don't believe you! I still don't believe you won't take her away from me! Wait- others like her? There are others like Meagan?\n\n\nSandals:\n Yes. We currently have other instances in containment. As I said, you seem quite knowledgeable about the species. What else have you observed about Meagan?\n\n\nSummers:\n Observed? Like what? Like what she likes to do? Why do you want to know that? So you can use it against her?\n\n\nSandals:\n Like behaviors, natural instincts, likes, dislikes. Stuff like that. And no, not to use it against her. To help her. Please just answer the question.\n\n\nSummers:\n Ugh, fine. Um\u2026 she eats.\n\n\nSummers pauses, then laughs.\n\n\nSummers:\n \nA lot.\n Like she\u2019s got this \nhuge\n appetite! But that makes sense with the tiger thing now.\n\n\nSandals:\n Bengal tigers can eat as much as sixty to seventy-five pounds of food in one night. The instances we currently contain have all been observed to eat a lot of animals and people. But it seems Meagan was able to survive off of cat food.\n\n\nVisible discomfort is seen on Summers\u2019 face.\n\n\nSummers:\n Egh, I could never imagine Meagan doing such a thing. She\u2019s a sweetheart, she really is. Yeah, but she eats a lot of it like I said. Um, she also doesn\u2019t purr right. Like she only purrs when she exhales.\n\n\nSandals:\n That\u2019s another natural behavior of a tiger. I\u2019m surprised that didn\u2019t set you off to there something being off sooner.\n\n\nSummers:\n Me too, to be honest. Recently I made a post asking my Instagram followers about it, but I never looked at the comments. Still, this all confuses me. What's your goal here?\n\n\nSandals:\n I get that. We\u2019re not all thinking about things like that too hard. Our goal is to help Meagan as I already said. Anything else you've observed?\n\n\nSummers:\n Yeah. I\u2019ve found Meagan really likes to play with toys. Have you tried toys with the other instances? Meagan really loves those wands that have the feathers and worms you know?\n\n\nSandals:\n We have not. Currently, we just feed them and give them places to climb and such.\n\n\nSummers:\n The fact that you call them 'instances' tells me a lot. Even though they\u2019re tigers, maybe they\u2019d be happier if you played with them! They\u2019re cats too! Maybe you just haven\u2019t found some of their playful sides. Cats often get what seems to be violent when they really just want to play.\n\n\nSandals:\n That\u2019s true. That\u2019s a very common house cat behavior.\n\n\nSandals sets down her clipboard.\n\n\nSandals:\n Diamond. You\u2019re very knowledgeable about Meagan. Which leads us to believe that you may be of some help to us here. Meagan has also already shown to not like to be distanced from you for too long. It\u2019s been a week and she\u2019s already injured three staff members and attempted to injure two more. Before this interview, I was discussing something with my colleagues, and you've only further proven yourself here. We would like to offer you an opportunity.\n\n\nSummers gasps.\n\n\nSummers:\n What kind of opportunity?\n\n\nSandals:\n The kind where we allow you to continue to see Meagan. As we see you\u2019re currently homeless, we will house you and provide you with basic needs. In exchange, you will help us study and take care of Meagan, and possibly other instances of SCP-8247 if it is deemed safe.\n\n\nSummers:\n I\u2026 I get to keep Meagan? So you were serious about helping her? Now I feel kind of bad for doubting you.\n\n\nSandals:\n You can\u2019t live with her anymore. But you will be allowed to visit her. How often is yet to be determined. What do you say?\n\n\nSummers:\n I\u2026 of course. I\u2019m not really in the position to turn you down. I\u2019d love to help you. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\nSandals:\n No problem, Diamond. Now, Meagan is probably waiting to see you.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n As of June 25th, 2021, Diamond Summers has been granted Level 0 clearance with some exceptions. Allowing Diamond Summers access to interact with other instances of SCP-8247 is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8246\n | SCP-8247 | \nSCP-8248\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8247\n\" by DianaBerry, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Interviewed: Diamond Summers Interviewer: Researcher Cara Sandals Foreword: Researcher Cara Sandals of the Zoology department at Site-908 was tasked with interviewing Diamond Summers, the owner of SCP-8247-A27. <Begin Log> Sandals: Hello, Diamond. I appreciate you coming to talk with me about Meagan. Summers: Uh\u2026 hello? You said you wanted to like, study her. You\u2019re not going to poke and prod her with needles or anything are you? Researcher Sandals laughs. Sandals: Oh, no. It\u2019s closer to observing her. But no poking or prodding involved. Summers: Good. Also, just for your information, the people she hurt were in self-defense! She doesn\u2019t just attack people for no reason she\u2019s not dangerous just because she\u2019s a tiger! Sandals: Diamond, I understand your defensiveness, but I\u2019m going to ask you to calm down. I didn\u2019t accuse her of being dangerous. You seem to know a lot about her. Summers: Of course I know a lot about her, she\u2019s my cat! I\u2019ve had her since she was a kitten. And are you sure you don\u2019t think she\u2019s dangerous? I don't believe that you don't! Sandals: While others like Meagan have shown violent tendencies, Meagan herself has not. I\u2019ve worked with animals a long time. I can tell when one is bonded to a human the way Meagan is bonded to you. I do not think she\u2019s dangerous. I think she\u2019s protective. Summers: I still don't believe you! I still don't believe you won't take her away from me! Wait- others like her? There are others like Meagan? Sandals: Yes. We currently have other instances in containment. As I said, you seem quite knowledgeable about the species. What else have you observed about Meagan? Summers: Observed? Like what? Like what she likes to do? Why do you want to know that? So you can use it against her? Sandals: Like behaviors, natural instincts, likes, dislikes. Stuff like that. And no, not to use it against her. To help her. Please just answer the question. Summers: Ugh, fine. Um\u2026 she eats. Summers pauses, then laughs. Summers: A lot. Like she\u2019s got this huge appetite! But that makes sense with the tiger thing now. Sandals: Bengal tigers can eat as much as sixty to seventy-five pounds of food in one night. The instances we currently contain have all been observed to eat a lot of animals and people. But it seems Meagan was able to survive off of cat food. Visible discomfort is seen on Summers\u2019 face. Summers: Egh, I could never imagine Meagan doing such a thing. She\u2019s a sweetheart, she really is. Yeah, but she eats a lot of it like I said. Um, she also doesn\u2019t purr right. Like she only purrs when she exhales. Sandals: That\u2019s another natural behavior of a tiger. I\u2019m surprised that didn\u2019t set you off to there something being off sooner. Summers: Me too, to be honest. Recently I made a post asking my Instagram followers about it, but I never looked at the comments. Still, this all confuses me. What's your goal here? Sandals: I get that. We\u2019re not all thinking about things like that too hard. Our goal is to help Meagan as I already said. Anything else you've observed? Summers: Yeah. I\u2019ve found Meagan really likes to play with toys. Have you tried toys with the other instances? Meagan really loves those wands that have the feathers and worms you know? Sandals: We have not. Currently, we just feed them and give them places to climb and such. Summers: The fact that you call them 'instances' tells me a lot. Even though they\u2019re tigers, maybe they\u2019d be happier if you played with them! They\u2019re cats too! Maybe you just haven\u2019t found some of their playful sides. Cats often get what seems to be violent when they really just want to play. Sandals: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s a very common house cat behavior. Sandals sets down her clipboard. Sandals: Diamond. You\u2019re very knowledgeable about Meagan. Which leads us to believe that you may be of some help to us here. Meagan has also already shown to not like to be distanced from you for too long. It\u2019s been a week and she\u2019s already injured three staff members and attempted to injure two more. Before this interview, I was discussing something with my colleagues, and you've only further proven yourself here. We would like to offer you an opportunity. Summers gasps. Summers: What kind of opportunity? Sandals: The kind where we allow you to continue to see Meagan. As we see you\u2019re currently homeless, we will house you and provide you with basic needs. In exchange, you will help us study and take care of Meagan, and possibly other instances of SCP-8247 if it is deemed safe. Summers: I\u2026 I get to keep Meagan? So you were serious about helping her? Now I feel kind of bad for doubting you. Sandals: You can\u2019t live with her anymore. But you will be allowed to visit her. How often is yet to be determined. What do you say? Summers: I\u2026 of course. I\u2019m not really in the position to turn you down. I\u2019d love to help you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sandals: No problem, Diamond. Now, Meagan is probably waiting to see you. <End Log> Closing Statement: As of June 25th, 2021, Diamond Summers has been granted Level 0 clearance with some exceptions. Allowing Diamond Summers access to interact with other instances of SCP-8247 is currently pending.",

SCP-8247 instances are to be provided with appropriate food, water, and enrichment daily. As SCP-8247 instances can transform at will, Foundation Personnel are to approach instances of SCP-8247 with extreme caution.

    "description": "SCP-8247 refers to an anomalous subspecies of felines. SCP-8247 instances possess the ability to transform into a Bengal Tiger at will. SCP-8247 instances have often been observed to display violent tendencies, often attacking and consuming other animals and humans. Despite their primal behaviors, instances demonstrate behaviors of a typical house cat regardless of which form they are currently in. SCP-8247 instances do not require raw meat and are capable of surviving on processed cat food, although larger portions are required and instances still exhibit a preference for fresh meat. Despite anatomy differences, SCP-8247 maintain behavioral traits influenced by the anatomy of big cats, such as the inability to purr except when exhaling. There are currently 247 instances of SCP-8247 in containment.",
