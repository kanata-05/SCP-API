Outside of testing, the locker is to be filled with nitrogen gas while sealed to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6743 was a standard size 11 iron ring, featuring an empty setting at the center. Its design was consistent with a typical promise ring.\n\n\nPrior to Incident 6743-1, after being removed from the finger of a properly fitting subject, SCP-6743 would cause the former wearer to lose their ability to speak and write adjectives, verbs, and common nouns\n1\n more than once, however symbolic language\n2\n is unaffected. In almost all cases, this effect wore off after approximately 72 hours.\n\n\nAs of 1/21/1999, SCP-6743 is nonfunctional and considered neutralized following its destruction during Incident 6743-1.\n\n\nHistory:\n SCP-6743 was recovered on 6/22/1998 during a raid on an Black Prince Jewelers warehouse in New York City, New York. The object was found in a crate, next to the following note:\n\n\n\n\nHey Vanessa\n3\n. I made the ring just like you asked- it'll only work temporarily on most people, but it's permanent on that fucker you were talking about. Can't believe he screwed you over like that, sold you out to the jailers.\n\n\n \n\nThis world is a cruel place, unfortunately. I hope this can make what he did to you somewhat better.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n-Rob, Black Prince Jewelers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6743-1:\n As of 1/5/1999, SCP-6743 is pending reclassification to anomalous object status due to its relatively low risk compared to other anomalies. \n-Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nIncident 6743-1:\n At 16:34 local time, 1/21/1999, Dr. Patrick Lyons of the Anomaly Reclassification Committee destroyed SCP-6743 by shattering it with a hammer. The following documents were recovered during investigation into SCP-6743's neutralization.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Documentation\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Documentation\n\n\n\n\nThe following are emails between Dr. Patrick Lyons, and Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n4\n approximately 83 hours after Dr. Patrick Lyons wore and then removed SCP-6743 on 1/8/1999 for testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/11/1999:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nSubject:\n The Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent afternoon, Dr. Faheem.\n\n\nSCP-6743's abnormalities persist beyond the 72 hour period, now approaching 83 within myself. I hoped that you possess a clarification for this issue that could aid me?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:The Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is highly interesting. Unfortunately, you are the first recorded instance where SCP-6743 has affected an individual for longer than 72 hours, and due to its safe properties, there has been no research into cancelling its effects on a subject. As such, the only advice I can provide as of now is to continue waiting it out and try to conserve your words until the affect goes away.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Re:The Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand, unfortunately. I intend to respond again soon, if these effects continue. I ask that you please research into solving this controversy, assuming they carry on.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1/14/1999:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nSubject:\n Lingering Ailment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Faheem, I am turning increasingly disquieted as the consequence of the eccentricity proceeds in me. It has now been roughly 6.6 days since exposure. I kindly request that you locate an elucidation for my condition, as petty amounts of words remain.\n\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nDr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Lingering Ailment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lyons, I apologize for my inability to help you thus far. As I stated before, you are the first case where SCP-6743's anomalous abilities have remained, so my team and I aren't entirely certain how to treat you as of now. However, we're working to find anything we can that may help your situation. I encourage you to head down to my office, and we can begin running some tests and interviews that may be of use.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted on 1/14/1999, approximately 159 hours after Dr. Patrick Lyons was exposed to SCP-6743.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 18:42:56>\n\n\nFaheem:\n Good evening, Dr. Lyons. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible due to your\u2026 condition. I'll skip straight to the chase, though. Do you know if you've been affected by any anomalies at any point in your life?\n\n\nLyons:\n No, as long as I remember.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Hmm, I see. Has this been affecting you in any way other than what the files suggest? Perhaps you're a unique case.\n\n\nLyons:\n My symptoms act essentially identical to those in the file. I never believed that it was anything exclusive, at least not yet.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Aren't making this easy, are you? At this rate you may just need to learn sign language\u2026\n\n\nDr. Faheem and Dr. Lyons chuckle.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Well, I think that's all I have for now. We'll need to run some medical tests and continue looking into potential causes, but for now all we can do is wait and hope it either goes away, or hope something turns up. Let's just, uh, hope you aren't the guy in the note.\n\n\nLyons:\n Note?\n\n\nFaheem:\n Yeah, some note recovered with the anomaly just got declassified, they figured it was safe enough to give to everyone else. Here, look.\n\n\nDr. Faheem displays an image of the note on his tablet. Dr. Lyons' expression is notably shocked.\n\n\nFaheem:\n What, heh, worried you might be the guy in the note?\n\n\nLyons:\n Oh fuck\u2026 oh shit\u2026\n\n\nFaheem:\n Lyons\u2026 are you the guy in the note?\n\n\nLyons:\n Oh god\u2026 that-\u2026 Vanessa\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lyons begins sobbing.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Lyons? Are you the one in the note?\n\n\nLyons:\n Ye- yes\u2026 ah hell\u2026 I never should- reported her.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Reported her for what?\n\n\nLyons:\n I messed up\u2026 I revealed the single woman who cared for me as a traitor\u2026 all over a miniscule deviant. Ratted my own girlfriend to the Foundation- for an individual bit of tech.\n\n\nFaheem:\n Oh dear. We'll end this interview here, I don't want you to use up anymore words. I'll keep working to find a cure, Lyons, we'll see how we can fix this. The note says it's permanent, but hopefully it isn't.\n\n\n<End Log, 19:01:32>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/16/1999:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nSubject:\n Updates?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Faheem, please comment if you bear any contemporary information regarding my state?\n\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Patrick Lyons\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Updates?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, my team and I have had no breakthroughs with SCP-6743.

While I'm putting priority into your current issues, I still have to manage several other SCPs and have a lot on my plate. We've discovered some new properties to SCP-6743, but nothing that could fix you yet. I'm sorry.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Ahmir Faheem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 1/20/1999\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following video was recovered from Dr. Ahmir Faheem's office after Dr. Patrick Lyons requested a meeting.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[12:05:37]:\n Dr. Lyons knocks on the door to Dr. Faheem's office.\n\n\n[12:05:39]: FAHEEM:\n \n(yelling)\n Come in, Dr. Lyons!\n\n\n[12:05:42]:\n The door slides open, and Dr. Lyons enters.\n\n\n[12:05:46]: FAHEEM:\n Please, take a seat Dr. Lyons.

As he enters, he jams the door behind him by smashing the control panel.\n\n\n[16:31:59]:\n Dr. Lyons searches for SCP-6743's locker, and upon locating it, opens it.\n\n\n[16:32:02]:\n Dr. Lyons picks up SCP-6743 and studies it.\n\n\n[16:32:30]:\n Security staff, previously tipped off by Dr. Faheem, knock on the locked door.\n\n\n[16:32:34]: SECURITY:\n \n(yelling)\n Dr. Lyons, let us in. Whatever you're planning, it doesn't need to happen like this!\n\n\n[16:32:36]: LYONS:\n Yes, it does. This came about as my wrongdoing.\n\n\n[16:32:45]: SECURITY:\n \n(yelling)\n No, it doesn't!

Keep your hands in the air, Dr. Lyons!\n\n\n[16:33:20]:\n Security personnel begin cutting through the door with a torch. Dr. Lyons looks for an exit, however fails to find one.\n\n\n[16:34:33]: SECURITY:\n \n(yelling)\n Alright, we're coming in! Keep your hands in the air and away from the anomalies!\n\n\n[16:34:39]:\n As security personnel begin entering the room, Dr. Lyons sets SCP-6743 on the floor and smashes it with the hammer. It shatters into several pieces that explode across the room.\n\n\n[16:34:44]: SECURITY:\n Fuck! Keep your hands in the air, Dr. Lyons! Don't reach for anything!\n\n\n[16:34:48]:\n Dr. Lyons begins reaching down, toward his waistline.\n\n\n[16:34:49]: SECURITY:\n Don't do it!
