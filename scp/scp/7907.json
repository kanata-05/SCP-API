Individuals exiting SCP-7907-1 are to be given psychiatric and/or amnestic treatment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7907 is a poltergeist, believed to be PoI-3947, that assumes the form of an emaciated male humanoid wearing a Venetian carnival mask. Direct eye contact with the entity has been known to cause severe cognitohazardous harm including personality alteration, memory loss, and psychosis. SCP-7907 can trigger pseudobulbar affect\n1\n through its cognitohazardous speech. A black book entitled \"Liber Mortis\" (designated SCP-7907-3) is believed to be the source of the entity's cognitohazardous properties.\n\n\nSCP-7907 will manifest itself and a standard-size carnival tent (designated SCP-7907-1) within the United States approximately once per decade, during an SCP-7907-A event. Manifestations last up to two days, during which time the entity and decomposing bodies puppeteered by it (designated SCP-7907-2) perform anomalous and/or anatomically impossible circus tricks.\n\n\nIndividuals can enter and exit SCP-7907-1 during an SCP-7907-A event, though the entity has been known to react aggressively to research and/or rescue expeditions. When an SCP-7907-A event is concluded, the entity and all objects related to it spontaneously dematerialize. Individuals inside SCP-7907-1 during dematerialization have reported falling and remaining unconscious until the next SCP-7907-A event. Promotional advertisements are occasionally left behind following dematerialization, and information from them has enabled prediction of future SCP-7907-A events.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-7907-1:\n SCP-7907-A History and Event Summaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/13/1905\n\n\nMay this letter find you in good cheer, for ours is beyond measure. At long last we've secured a plot in San Fransisco for the traveling circus show. It took every copper, but \"Langmeyer's Laugh Emporium\" will finally be performing for the world. Alton is delighted by the news, and I eagerly await our upcoming debut!\n\n\n-Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough first located in 1934 through an SCP-7907-A event, subsequent research indicates that the entity has been active since 1906, when LoI-3210, a circus tent commonly known as \"Langmeyer's Laugh Emporium,\" disappeared during a 7.9 magnitude earthquake. Surviving records from the deceased PoI-3948\n2\n confirmed the connection between PoI-3947 and SCP-7907.\n\nThe following is a log of all recorded SCP-7907-A events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary: 1934/08/13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7907-1 manifests in southwestern Oklahoma. Local reports of carnival advertisements raining from the skies reach Foundation operatives, though they fail to arrive before the conclusion of the SCP-7907-A event. Several locals went missing and are presumed dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary: 1949/01/29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7907-1 manifests in southern Florida, with advertisements mentioning a famous contortionist act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Summary:\n SCP-7907 puppeteers a decomposing body while claiming to be \"The Great Lombardi,\" and contorts it into anatomically impossible positions. Several jaw muscles appear to have been violently removed, presumably to facilitate easier ventriloquy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary: 1955/03/05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7907-1 manifests in central Texas, with advertisements mentioning a sword-swallower and opera singer. A failed research expedition results in the loss of \nseven\n six staff members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Summary:\n SCP-7907 consumes three scimitars, four short swords, and a halberd during the first act. Impressions of the blades can be seen protruding from the entity's skin. A brief intermission follows, during which time retching and sounds of tearing flesh can be heard. During the second act SCP-7907 is dressed in a full-body gown, and sings \nLibiamo ne' lieti calici\n from \nLa Traviata.\n The entity repeatedly vomits blood during the rendition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary: 1964/09/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7907-1 manifests in southern Illinois, with advertisements mentioning acrobats and a lion-tamer. MTF Mu-13 infiltrates SCP-7907-1 and successfully recovers Dr. Angela Grant, a Foundation researcher who went missing during the previous SCP-7907-A event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Summary:\n Several \"lions\" composed of putrefying organic matter are brought on stage and whipped by SCP-7907 until they stand on their hind legs. The creatures then perform a tightrope balance and attempt to jump through flaming hoops. Several of them collide with the hoops mid-jump and are sliced in half, at which point the flaming halves fall to the stage floor and violently convulse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Summary: 1982/06/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7907-1 manifests in western Vermont, with advertisements mentioning a balloon artist, fire-breathers, and a stand-up comedian.

We found twisted carnival masks, bloody swords, and\u2026 \n[whispering]\n I think there were some props made of \nhuman skin.\n I was photographing pages from this creepy black book when we heard someone coming.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n It was SCP-7907, correct?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n Yes. \n[pauses]\n He was tall and stick-thin, but I couldn't get a good look at the guy because he was covered head-to-toe in fancy circus clothes. The man's outfit was so colorful he looked half-peacock, and his face was covered by a grinning mask. It was leaking some kind of black fluid, and the \nsmell\u2026\n\n\nDr. Grant vomits on the floor of the interview room. Director Novens sends for a janitor and offers a towel to Dr. Grant.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n \u2026You were saying?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n My legs were like jelly, and I barely managed to hide under a table before he came into the room. \"Trying to nab my secrets, eh?\" I heard that hideous mask speak to us, \"A good performer never shares a jot, but methinks \nyou'll\n be sharing things with \nme\n instead\u2026\" I caught a glimpse of his eyes while he was staring at one of my colleagues, and suddenly all I could see was the swirling purple light in the empty eye-sockets of his mask. It felt\u2026 \n[pauses]\n\n\nDirector Novens [quietly]:\n It's alright, you're safe here.\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n It felt like he was stealing thoughts right out of my \nhead.\n I felt ideas, memories, even whole chunks of my psyche being sucked out as if a leech had latched onto my brain.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n Did it try to kill you?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n He didn't see me under the table, at least, I don't think he did. That guy went to each of my colleagues, looking them in the eyes with that same light, and kissed them on the mouth.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n It \nkissed\n them?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n The guy looked more like he was \nsucking\n something out of their mouths, but I didn't get a good view. A few moments later I fell unconscious. The last thing I remembered was hearing someone weeping, \"Sorry. Sorry. So sorry\u2026\"\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n Do you remember anything else?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n I remember waking up under the same table and finding a spot under the stands to hide in. That's where your agent found me.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n Nothing \nelse?\n\n\nDr. Grant:\n No. \n[pauses]\n Can I leave now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Grant is to be referred to a site therapist weekly for physiatric care, and archives of her photographs of SCP-7907-3 are to be assigned level 4/7907 classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/24/1906\n\n\nThe show's earnings were poor this week, and Alton has been acting quite strange as well. He showed me a book of magicks with profane inscriptions, insisting that we use its unholy powers for the show. I told Alton to burn the book before it hexed us all, but he refused to listen. I fear for his soul.\n\n\n-Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Site Director Emery Novens\n\n\nInterviewee:\n MTF Agent Max Maxwell\n\n\nForeword:\n Director Novens questions Agent Maxwell about his version of events during the SCP-7907-A event of 1964.\n\n\n[Written Transcript]\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n Greetings, Agent Maxwell. You'll be pleased to know Dr. Grant is safe and in good health thanks to your brave actions. Shall I schedule a meeting with her?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Yes, and let's get down to brass tacks while we're here. You didn't invite me just for a pat on the back, did you?\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n You are correct, Agent Maxwell, and as direct as ever. Our interview with Dr. Grant was\u2026 \ninconclusive.\n We hope that your account will clear some things up.\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Of course, sir. We first rushed the circus perimeter, and the boys started drawing lots for who'd have to go inside. I offered to take Chip's place when he drew a short straw, and then me and the unlucky fellas entered the tent.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n You \nvolunteered?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Yeah. \n[chuckles]\n Probably a stupid idea in hindsight, but Chip had a baby girl and I didn't want that on my conscience.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n \n[smiles]\n A commendable sentiment, Agent Maxwell. Please continue.\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n The inside was \nhuge,\n ten times bigger than the tent at least, and there were these frankensteined \ncreatures\n prancing around on their hind legs upstage. Some of the other guys were distracted by all that, not to mention the smell of rotting flesh, so I told them to keep their eyes peeled. There were people trapped in this magic building, and we had to rescue them.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n And was that when you found Dr. Grant?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Yes, I found her hiding under these bleacher-type seats\u2026 Well, I suppose \nheard\n her is more accurate, seeing as the woman was babbling like she'd been shell-shocked. I told her that help had arrived.\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n How did she react to that statement?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Laughter. \n[pauses]\n And by that I mean \nlaughter.\n She started laughing uncontrollably and rolling on the floor, to the point where some of the circus-zombie-things started turning and getting angry. I didn't have time to chit-chat, so I hoisted the gibbering woman over my shoulder and high-tailed it out of there. She kept babbling, \"He told a funny! I know a funny!\" as if she'd never heard a joke before in her life, so I knocked her unconscious with an elbow to the head. \n[looks down]\n Couldn't risk attracting more of those circus freaks, you know?\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n I'd say you made the right decision, Agent Maxwell. \n[pauses]\n While we're on the subject of the SCP-7907-2 entities, did any of them try to stop you?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n The little ones did. Their bodies felt like carrion and were about as strong. You think they'd flee after the first few gunshots, but those guys were practically throwing themselves at us saying \"Shoot! Shoot! Don't hold back!\" \n[pauses]\n We didn't, not that it made much of a difference. Even with a dozen bullet holes those bastards still kept crawling towards us. At least the bullets actually slowed them down; no such luck when it came to the other guy\u2026\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n SCP-7907, correct?\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n Yes. He rose and spoke as I was running headfirst out of the circus with my mates. \"Think it's funny to spoil my show, do you?\" He said to us, \"I'll tell you what's \nreally\n funny!\"\n\n\nDirector Novens:\n And what was \"really funny?\"\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDirector Novens begins laughing uncontrollably, making spasmodic motions and crying from both eyes.\n\n\nAgent Maxwell:\n \u2026I still don't get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n All MTF Mu-13 task force members that entered SCP-7907-1 are missing and presumed dead, with the exception of Agent Maxwell. Director Novens remained incapacitated for two hours and continued to suffer from pseudobulbar affect for a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/18/1906\n\n\nForgive me, mother, but I had no choice. Today is our last performance before going broke, and I told Alton that he could use his vile book if it would save us from ruin. I already see a great crowd coming for the show, but I fear the cost of this sorcery. If anything should happen, pray for us both.\n\n\n-Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 4/7907 CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/7907 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0SCP-7907-2\u00a0(1982/06/12)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a0SCP-7907-2\u00a0(1982/06/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Excerpt from Liber Mortis, page 19)\n4\n\n\n\"\u2026direct eye contact to complete the spell.

I'm surprised you even know what that word means, seeing as you've got about as many jokes in your head as you have strands of hair.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell glares at the other field agents. Nobody laughs.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Forty pushups.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell takes roll for the remaining agents: Levin Lossfelt, Terrence Caughron, and Cecilia Wren. He feels his comb-over midway through while nobody is looking.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n I'll cut to the chase so you numbskulls can understand: you're here because a few hours from now this field will have a big tent in it, and we need to rescue the people trapped inside.\n\n\nAgent Vance is staring at her reflection in the helmet's front visor.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n That's an MTF helmet, Agent Vance, not a mirror. \n[turns to other agents]\n Follow my lead, and if shit hits the fan go right for the exit.

Keep moving; our mission is to find survivors only.\n\n\nMTF agents sneak across the back of the audience stands. The fire-breathing entities leave the stage and are replaced by a bloated SCP-7907-2 instance carrying a human lung labeled \"balloon bag.\" Balloon \"animals\" formed by the entity are named after missing persons.\n\n\nAgent Cecilia Wren:\n No survivors here, Commander.\n\n\nMTF agents continue searching under the stands. The SCP-7907-2 instance leaves the stage and is replaced by SCP-7907, which claims to be a \"world-famous comedian.\"\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Copy. \n[pause]\n Regroup and check-\n\n\nSCP-7907 [into mic]:\n Good evening gents! We have some \nspecial\n visitors for tonight's show, \n[spotlights shine on MTF agents]\n but it seems they're a little \nshy.\n Give 'em a warm welcome, everyone!\n\n\nAll SCP-7907-2 instances simultaneously face the MTF agents and begin sprinting after them. Video quality is further corrupted.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Head for the exits!\n\n\nSCP-7907 raises its hands over its head and twists them counterclockwise 180 degrees at the wrist. The circumference of the tent rotates in the same way, placing the exit on the opposite side behind the stage.\n\n\nSCP-7907 [into mic]:\n \nLeave?\n You haven't heard a single joke yet!\n\n\nSCP-7907-2 instances attack from all directions, while MTF agents fight their way towards the backstage doors.

Live feeds from all SCRAMBLE helmets are lost moments later, indicating equipment failure.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Damn piece of junk. \n[smacks helmet]\n How much money did R&D blow on this thing for it to crap out after one mission?\n\n\nCommander Maxwell uses a discarded fly pole to bar the door shut, and motions to the remaining agents.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Our equipment's shot; we need to evacuate right now.

Distant laughter can be heard from upstage.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell [shouting]:\n Sadie! There you are!\n\n\nAgent Vance is in a small room inspecting an enormous black book entitled \"Liber Mortis.\" She looks up from the book and appears startled.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n The hell are you doing here? I told you to follow my lead, remember?\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n I got lost, Commander. \n[pauses]\n I couldn't hear anything.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n What do you mean you couldn't-\n\n\nAgent Vance removes two hearing aids from her pocket.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Oh\u2026 \n[sighs]\n So it's not just the helmets; all our tech breaks in this magic tent.\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n \n\"Our neck breaks?\"\n Sorry, I haven't done lip reading in years\u2026\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Enough chat; we need to leave.\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n Leave?

She declines.\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n Luck?\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Yeah\u2026 luck. I got this job by luck, after bagging a shoplifter who happened to be a \nshapeshifter\n as well. When the Foundation brass showed up they were so impressed they offered to take me on as a field agent.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell chuckles while staring at the ground.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Probably should've said no, but the pay was good. Good enough to support Millie and start a family at least, which was more than I could say about my other options back then. \"We've got aliens, demons, monsters, and people that can turn you into lead,\" they told me, \"You think we're gonna give two shits about the color of your \nskin,\n Max?\"\n\n\nCommander Maxwell flicks his cigarette onto the floor.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Sorry, kid. I didn't mean to unload on you like that.

To end up like her?\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n That's all I ever wanted\u2026 \n[smiles sadly]\n It was mom that first got me this job. She was an MTF legend too. First woman to lead a task force on American soil, and she saved \nthousands\n of lives.

It's MINE!\n\n\nThe entity retracts its hands and returns SCP-7907-3 to its coat pocket.

She retrieves SCP-7907-3 from its pocket, douses the book in paraffin oil, and lights it on fire. The entity is engulfed in purple flames at the same time as the book.\n\n\nSCP-7907 [screaming]:\n THE SHOW MUST GO ON!\n\n\nAs the entity burns SCP-7907-1 and SCP-7907-2 instances ignite and burn with it, leaving nothing behind but the charred corpses of PoI-3947, other missing persons, and Agents Caughron, Lossfelt, and Wren.\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n Show's over.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell awakens.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n \n[coughs]\n Sadie, are you alright?\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n \n[chuckles]\n My therapy bill just skyrocketed, but yeah.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Jokes? \nNow?\n Aren't you rookies supposed to be traumatized after shit like this?\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n I've been training for MTF since I was a kid, Max. \n[smiles]\n And my therapist is the \nbest.\n\n\nCommander Maxwell:\n Great, I can save the tissues and Ben & Jerry in that case.\n10\n \n[pauses]\n So what happened while I was out?\n\n\nAgent Vance:\n You \nsaved\n us.
