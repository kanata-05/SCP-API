All other instances of SCP-2324-A are to be destroyed upon discovery. Site-58 has been equipped with optima-class insecticide dispensers to be used in the event of a containment breach. All crucial personnel at Site-58 are required to receive optima immunization at a separate site - no optima vaccine is to be present at Site-58. If deployment of optima gas proves ineffective to re-contain SCP-2324-A-1, the site's 5-megaton incendiary charges are to be activated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2324 is a phenomenon associated with the western honey bee\n2\n and its parasitic interaction with humans. SCP-2324-A denotes a human infected with SCP-2324. The injection mechanism for SCP-2324 is through a specialized bee sting to a living human.\n\n\nA fully infected SCP-2324-A instance is clinically dead, but maintains life functions under a new, altered consciousness controlled by an unknown means, presumably by bees within the body of the individual instance. The brain of an SCP-2324-A instance is replaced with a new structure superficially resembling a beehive\n3\n, in which regular honey bees produce, nurture, and deploy biologically modified, notably more aggressive honeybees via the nostrils, mouth, and other cavities. SCP-2324-A instances are capable of speech in the host's native language, and an instance will refer to itself as an individual warship belonging to a greater army known by such names as \u201cthe Hive Authority,\u201d \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s Fleet,\u201d and \u201cthe Queen\u2019s Navy.\u201d\n4\n\n\nAddendum - SCP-2324-A-1 Interview, 5/16/15:\n\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nSCP-2324-A-1:\n We have visual on enemy flagship.
