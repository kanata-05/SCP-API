It is further entitled to a personalized healthcare package, tailored to its unique physiology and exclusively to be employed at Foundation clinics.\n\n\nSCP-6355's containment cell has been moved to the edge of the GBENWM-Site-02 Containment Wing, and is retrofitted with the amenities appropriate for an employee of its station. Twice per day, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of a coworker as they take their meals; to this end, at least three employees of the Fire Suppression Department must be on kosher meal plans at any one time.\n\n\nFurther benefits have been provided to SCP-6355:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6355 may make purchase requests, either for its cell, its media library, or as gifts.\n\n\nOn Friday nights, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of brain-dead personnel to attend worship services.\n\n\nOnce per month, SCP-6355 is permitted to travel to a city within 200\u00a0km, provided it occupies a member of, and allows itself to be escorted by, Mobile Task Force Sigma-25 (\"Ghostbusters\") reserve personnel.\n\n\nSCP-6355's use of its anomalous abilities in the process of work will not be counted as breaches of containment.\n\n\n\n\nShould SCP-6355 leave its position with the Fire Suppression Department, see Document 6355-Q for secondary containment procedures.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6355 is an abnormal instance of Spectral Entity Of Interest-040 (\"Mazzikim\"), i.e. an invisible, non-sentient spirit associated with deleterious spectral activity. Unlike baseline instances, SCP-6355 is uniquely sapient and self-directed, irrespective of background Malakhic Radiation.\n\n\nSCP-6355 identifies itself as a remnant of \"Avigail\", a Jewish resident of late 12th-century York. Previously, SCP-6355 resided within Beth Ahm Yisrael, a Conservative Jewish synagogue\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-6355 is capable of inducing physical, mental, and spiritual distress upon sapient subjects. This form of malicious behavior is typical of Mazzikim; however, SCP-6355's sapience allows it far greater control over its ministrations.\n\n\nAt present, SCP-6355 is employed with the Fire Suppression Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ENCOUNTER-6355-A\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENCOUNTER-6355-A\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 24/01/2000\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-6355\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nMTF-\u03a325 and Researcher Cunningham enter Site-6355-A through the north synagogue entryway. The group proceed down the nave, and begin setting up their equipment in the chancel.\n\n\nFootage begins to distort. MTF-\u03a325-01 through MTF-\u03a325-04 slow their work, and become fixated on their own bodies. Gradually, all MTF members begin frantically brushing, waving, and scratching at their uniforms. Researcher Cunningham only stares at their hand.\n\n\nCommand:\n Report. Captain, \nreport\n.\n\n\nMTF-\u03a325-01|Watts:\n Bugs.

Listen to me, you're perfectly-\n\n\nFeed is interrupted by static. Once re-established, feed shows MTF-\u03a325 and Researcher Cunningham covered in welts, blisters, and dark bruises. MTF-\u03a325-03 begins to shake.\n\n\nResearcher Cunningham:\n Fascinating.\n\n\nMTF-\u03a325-01|Watts:\n Command, equipment says this is an SEI Mazzikin.

Move out - I said move out, now!\n\n\nMTF-\u03a325 and Researcher Cunningham quickly evacuate Site-6355-A. Cunningham pauses briefly in the main atrium, looking back. The figure of a young girl is seen hovering over the Altar.\n\n\nResearcher Cunningham:\n Yes.

The blood of a properly slaughtered sheep is poured into a silver chalice, and a Malakhic Entity is called to occupy it. Shortly thereafter, a drop of pig's blood is mixed into the chalice, rendering it ritually unclean; the resulting Akiva vacuum forces SCP-6355 to occupy its place.\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n You insult me.\n\n\nCunningham:\n I'm sorry, Avigail. Truly. We had to ensure our own safety.\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n Ridiculous notion. There's terror to be had. G-d willing, there's terror to be had.\n\n\nCunningham:\n You don't think you've spread enough already, Avigail?\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n I don't. You don't talk quite like them. Your skin's darker. Bet they did to your kind what they did to me. Still, you're with them. You'd set fire to the tower all the same.\n\n\nResearcher Cunningham nods, remaining silent for several seconds while they write something in their notebook.\n\n\nCunningham:\n \n(\u2026)\n So, how does it make you feel?\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n Don't feel anything. Burnt off.\n\n\nCunningham:\n Not literally, Avigail. When you terrorize a human, be it sickness, madness\u2026 any kind of mortal terror, what goes on in your mind? You \ndo\n have a mind, no?\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n I.\n\n\nSCP-6355 pauses, and remains inert for several seconds.\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n Good. Feels good. Feels right. \"\nHashem yikkom damam\n\", I believe they call it.\n\n\nCunningham:\n Excellent.\n\n\nResearcher Cunningham nods, and jots something into their notebook.\n\n\nCunningham:\n So, what if I told you that your terror isn't as much of a problem as the last two weeks might have lead you to believe?\n\n\nSCP-6355's vessel rattles.\n\n\nSCP-6355:\n Should've known.
