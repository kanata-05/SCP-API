SCP-7251 colonies are to be contained within an aquarium kept at 5\u00b0C or less. The aquarium is to be held within a standard containment chamber for high-threat biological hazards. The decontamination chamber within SCP-7251's containment chamber must be kept consistently at 6\u00b0C or higher. SCP-7251 colonies are only to be contained in locations with hot and arid climates.\n\n\nIn the event of an outbreak of SCP-7251 constituting less than 60% of the local population, any organism found to be infected by SCP-7251 is to be incinerated. In the event of an outbreak of SCP-7251 constituting greater than 60% of the local population, uninfected citizens within the area of the outbreak are to be evacuated under the guise of threats of terrorism, subsequently, the area is to be sanitized through the usage of incendiary weaponry. These measures have been put in place following the events described in Addendum-7251-2.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7251 are unicellular fungal organisms similar to Candida Albicans, originating from within the abyssopelagic zone of the ocean. When a sufficient amount of SCP-7251 instances are present, the instances will build colonies resembling the appearance of human veins. The exterior of SCP-7251 colonies is black in hue, while the interior is purple in hue. SCP-7251 colonies can mimic the appearance and function of less complex organisms.\n\n\nIndividual SCP-7251 instances asexually reproduce through cellular mitosis. This method of reproduction usually takes an hour to occur; however, the rate of this process expedites when certain conditions are present. Colonies of SCP-7251 asexually reproduce through the production of spores. Spores produced by SCP-7251 instances will grow solely within biological hosts.\n\n\nWhen coming into contact with biological matter, spores produced by SCP-7251 colonies will excrete a clear liquid similar to cerebrospinal fluid in viscosity. Combining this liquid with any form of biological tissue produces a cooling effect, causing the temperature of the biological tissue to be reduced to approximately 2\u00b0C. However, all biological tissue affected by this phenomenon will be unaffected by the adverse effects caused by the reduction in temperature.\n\n\nUpon entering a host, SCP-7251 instances will begin rapid cellular mitosis. This process will continue until a colony of SCP-7251 instances forms within the host's central nervous system. The colony will then influence the actions of the host to produce a more favourable environment for the survival of the colony. Colonies of SCP-7251 will continue to manipulate the host following their expiration to a limited extent.\n\n\nThere are several symptoms of SCP-7251 infection. These symptoms include the appearance of small colonies of SCP-7251 on the host's skin, a reduction of the host's body temperature, an increase in the aggressive tendencies of the host, an increase in the host's physical strength, an increase in the host's regenerative abilities, a reduction in the host's survival instincts, and abnormal movements from the host.\n\n\nSCP-7251 colonies require a specific environment for survival outside of the host to be possible. When colonies of SCP-7251 are destitute of sufficient amounts of water, extensive necrosis will occur within the colony. Prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 5\u00b0C will also cause extensive necrosis within SCP-7251 colonies.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7251-1: Discovery\n\n\nSCP-7251 was originally discovered after a distress call involving the anomaly was intercepted by Foundation operatives. The call detailed an event where an outbreak of a fungus occurred within a United States marine testing facility.\n\n\nAccording to the individual speaking to Foundation operatives, the fungus, discovered by marine biologists based within the United States testing facility, was presumed to only affect aquatic life after extensive testing on the lifeform displayed extensive necrosis of the lifeform when removed from its natural environment. As the fungus seemed to pose little to no threat, security measures were relaxed around the organism to preserve resources. Due to this, on a notably cold day, a mishap in transportation caused multiple individuals to be exposed to the fungus in sub-zero temperatures, subsequently causing the infection of said individuals.\n\n\nFollowing the call's interception, multiple MTF agents were dispatched to control the situation. Upon arrival, agents found numerous staff to be infected by SCP-7251. Additionally, a large SCP-7251 colony formed at the centre of the facility. The MTF agents proceeded to collect samples of the fungus before quarantining the facility. The facility was later utilized for testing on the anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum-7251-2: Breach\n\n\nProceeding with the Foundation's acquisition of the facility, investigations were launched into the surrounding area. Initially, nothing out of the ordinary was discovered within the area; however, following atmospheric testing, small traces of SCP-7251 spores could be detected. Assumedly, an unknown avian entity became infected with the anomaly, subsequently causing a breach in containment.\n\n\nAfter following traces of SCP-7251 spores, Foundation operatives located the apparent site at which the infected entity had landed. The location discovered resided within a small coastal town with a population of approximately 200 people. Foundation operatives equipped with hazmat suits were then sent into the town under the guise of a gas leak. What appeared to have happened was that the entity flew into a window which subsequently caused the entity's neutralization as there was evidence of an SCP-7251 colony being formed on the window, which the entity assumedly struck. Unexpectedly, however, the colony appeared completely healthy despite the express lack of water; it is assumed that the lack of water in the environment outside of the entity, along with a suitable environment to reproduce and an overall above-average reproductive speed allowed SCP-7251 to evolve a reduced dependency of water. Samples of the evolved fungus were collected for testing; residents of the house were evacuated, and the rest of the fungus was incinerated under the guise of a gas fire caused by the aforementioned gas leak. All SCP-7251 spores were purged from the air via the utilization of heat-based weaponry.\n\n\nTests on the altered fungus displayed a lesser dependency on water, as mentioned previously. An additional attribute of the altered SCP-7251 colony was an increase in survivable temperature for the altered colony. Approximately three days following the containment of the altered colony, the colony began to exhibit rapid and unpredictable movements before morphing into a mimicry of an unidentifiable avian species, assumedly the same as which originated the colony. The altered colony then attempted to break the observation glass of its containment chamber in an attempt to escape; shortly after, on-site security terminated the colony.\n\n\nNote:\n Despite the small-scale consequence of this event, SCP-7251 should be treated with higher amounts of care, given the anomaly's capability for rapid reproduction leading to an enhanced ability for adaptation combined with the anomaly's ability to mimic other lifeforms cumulates into a dangerous combination with the potential to cause a wide-scale outbreak making containment of the anomaly impossible; thus we have decided that, in the cases of outbreaks, the destruction of SCP-7251 instances and colonies should be made the highest priority to mitigate the possibility of an SCP-7251 instance or colony adapting for the infection of terrestrial life.\n\n\nAddendum-7251-3: Communication\n\n\nDuring the containment of an SCP-7251 colony, several changes in the aforementioned colony were noted. At first, the colony began to move sporadically before beginning to mimic what appeared to be eyes in both appearance and function. Approximately six hours after a team was sent in to perform tests on the SCP-7251 colony, the colony mimicked what appeared to have been a human finger before tapping on the glass using the finger. This seemed to formulate a message in Morse code.\n\n\nRecreation of The Taps Through a Telegraph:\n\n\n\n\nTranslation:\n\n\n\n\nYou're attempting to reverse our progress which we worked so hard to attain. Tell us why, why do you hate us so? We are just following our design.\n\n\n\n\nImmediately after, all SCP-7251 instances and colonies currently in containment experienced extensive necrosis. One hour after, extreme seismic activity occurred within the abyssopelagic zone of the ocean for approximately thirty minutes before cessation. A thorough investigation into the possibility of sentience within SCP-7251 colonies is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7251\n\" by TheDrAluminium, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
