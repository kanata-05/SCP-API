Only separate them when required for testing. Instructions for administering the modified Zener cards can be found in \nDocument 7075-A\n, which will be given to assigned personnel. Approve any requests for intelligence-based items (board games, books of riddles, etc.) which may aid in testing. Likewise, deny any requests which may hinder.\n\n\nContainment Update:\n Increase the rate of testing to four times a week with a focus on enhancing emotive and superconscious abilities. Subjects possess suicidal and homicidal ideation, but both state that their desires are manageable. Believe them until proven otherwise.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7075 was an unknown individual who was subject to an occult ritual. This ritual was meant to transform it into a gestalt entity of great psychic influence, but instead split it into two sapient humanoids, designated SCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B.\n\n\nThese two humanoids share a very potent psychological bond. Either one is able to instantly (and often involuntarily) transmit sensory information, ideas, and associations to the other with a ~0.009% accuracy\n1\n. Therefore, by all known metrics, SCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B possess the most powerful telepathic connection ever recorded by the SCP Foundation. Research has shown that their telepathy has some conscious component which can be strengthened through mental exercises and tests of will. Researchers are encouraged to speak to their supervisors regarding the specifics.\n\n\nSCP-7075-A is a 1.80-meter-tall male. It is thin, malnourished, and weak; having performed poorly during every one of its medical evaluations. It has paranoid tendencies and can sometimes fall into uncooperative or even hostile moods during testing, but it has yet to attack a researcher. A common delusion it suffers from is that SCP-7075-B or its caretakers are trying to harm it in some way. To ease this, researchers are encouraged to act more casually with SCP-7075-A than they usually would with SCPs.\n\n\nSCP-7075-A has extensive scarring across its face and torso, which is indicative of ritual scarification. SCP-7075-A will occasionally have episodes where it bleeds from these scars for anywhere from five minutes to two-and-a-half hours. When asked why this happens, SCP-7075-A has stated that it \"does not know and does not care.\" Examination has shown that this bleeding is visual only; it does not suffer any real harm during its episodes.\n\n\nSCP-7075-B is a 1.54-meter-tall female. It appears to be far larger and heavier than SCP-7075-A and its limbs are particularly bloated compared to the rest of its body, lacking coloration in certain spots and sagging at the joints. Little is known about SCP-7075-B's personality since it has refused to speak to many researchers. However, it has shown a liking towards a very select few, the names of whom are included in \nDocument 7075-A\n. It has sometimes spoken to SCP-7075-A when it believes they are not being listened to.\n\n\nSCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B are fraternal twins.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0ASSORTED\u00a0EXPERIMENT/INTERVIEW\u00a0LOGS\u00a002/09/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0-\u00a019/10/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ASSORTED\u00a0EXPERIMENT/INTERVIEW\u00a0LOGS\u00a002/09/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0-\u00a019/10/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nINTERVIEWEE:\n SCP-7075-A\n\n\n\n\nSR.

They go by so fast that I'm only able to catch a few words most of the time. Sometimes I think I get a smell? I get these bits and pieces that are all blended together into this\u2026 soup in my head. It's like if there was a tiger on the other side of the room growling really, really, really low. Sometimes it comes closer and sometimes it goes away, but it's always there.\n\n\nSR.

I thought of doing something like that a while ago with a t-shirt and this kiddie pool, but I got really fuckin' scared at the last second and freaked out. I felt the same here, but everything was a lot more calm. I couldn't feel my face, it was fucking incredible.\n\n\nSR.

When it started, I was like upside down and I was floating and looking down at this black ocean. My eyes were messed up. Like, I knew for some reason that I wasn't looking at the ocean, I was looking at a really big sphere of water, like a floating mass kind of thing. But I saw\u2014I saw a circle. It was this flat circle like a flag, and it made me really scared. I tried to look somewhere else, but I couldn't move my head. My whole body felt limp. And I felt this really loud, distorted roar in my right ear. It was like a lion was screaming through a sp\u2026 No, it wasn't an animal scream.

She thinks she's better than everyone else.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What makes you say that?\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n The way she acts. The way that she thinks. She eats a lot of my food and she's mean to people and she's a really big weight on everything. She used to be nice when we were first created, but now every day is a slog. I hate talking to her. I don't like feeling like that because we're connected, but I do. I'm sorry.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You don't have to apologize, David.

Um\u2026 I think it was the same thing as last time with me on the floor in the kitchen. This time I wasn't looking through my eyes though, I was looking through my mom's. I was saying all the same shit, but now I could feel what she was feeling\u2014what I think she was feeling when I was saying it.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What was she thinking?\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n She wasn't um\u2026 she wasn't really thinking anything at all. I couldn't catch any words or anything, but I knew that she was feeling blue. She was the most blue I'd ever seen. It wasn't like an ocean blue or an aquarium blue, it was a lot more intense. It made me wanna puke. It was so\u2026 burning in my eyes and my stomach.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Maybe it was something medical. You said she had seizures sometimes, didn't you? That could be how she was feeling when it came on.\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n No, no man! It wasn't anything like that.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Alright, sorry \u2014 I'm sorry. What did it feel like?\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n It was so\u2026 sad and cold and lonely. I felt the blue everywhere around me, no matter how much I shut my eyes. My eyelids weren't even black anymore. The longer that I looked at me on the floor the more I wanted to collapse. I wanted to die. I didn't wanna be there anymore. I felt so disappointed in myself and, like, pissed at the world for fucking doing this to me. I had no fucking clue why I of all people was chosen to suffer through this. It was terrifying, it was terrifying.\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n And, um\u2026 I felt really bad when I woke up. I stopped drinking a while ago 'cause of some other shit with one of my friends, but if I could've felt that, I would've stopped earlier. I fucking hate it so much. It fucking disgusts me, man.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What happened with your fr-\n\n\nSCP-7075-A:\n Could you take me back to my room please?

Request was approved.\n\n\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Before we get into this, can I ask why you want to be interviewed all of a sudden? Is there something that happened recently?\n\n\nSCP-7075-B:\n No.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Okay. Do you have a request you'd like to make? Something for your room?\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\nSCP-7075-B:\n I see. Um, okay, I guess I'm choosing to do it now. I don't give a shit anymore. If you need to kill me to do it, I'd like to be drowned or shot in the head. Maybe poisoned, but however you wanna do it is fine. I don't know how David wants to do it, but he feels the same way. Just do it before I change my mind.\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Excuse me?\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\nSR. RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I'm sorry.

I know what you want. I can see his thoughts, dumbass. I know what the fuck you're trying to tell me. I don't care. I'm not gonna run or try and kill one of you or take your guns.

And you have plenty of reasons to live. You still have your brother, don't you? You're just as powerful a telepath as he is. Without you he's useless, he's just another guy walking down the street. Your existence alone makes him one of the most important people in history. You two shatter every rule of science, every rule of psychology, metaphysics \u2014 you shatter everything every day! You two being born is one of the most consequential events in all of human history. Doesn't that excite you? Doesn't that make you happy?\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\nSR.
