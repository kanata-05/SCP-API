limited to census and population data \u2014 all historical public-facing data has been retroactively corrected. No further action is needed at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8843 is a statistical anomaly impacting global population data. All census data gathered after February 10th, 2019 has reported a 0.1-5% discrepancy between projections, simulations, and reported totals, such that the census data is inconsistent with birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates, as well as 2019 census data gathered before February 10th, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nCC:\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG.Afters@scp.int\n\n\nSite-43 Researchers\n\n\nnone\n\n\nSCP-8843 Notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Researchers at Site-43,\n\n\nAs an academically-inclined research site, the Foundation Department of Statistics wanted to ensure that the attached document was distributed, such that all relevant projects can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis is just a statistical anomaly, and should not impact any unrelated fields; if you have additional questions, you may reach out to me directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGage Afters\n\n\nCoordinator, Foundation Department of Statistics\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLil, did you see that email? About the stats thing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I read it. Then I deleted it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think they're wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's new babe? Does this one matter? Does it change anything if an egghead made the wrong conclusion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, yes. It's not just a one-off statistical weirdness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSure, I mean, probably not. When is it ever that simple?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why do we care? We've got a big backlog of M&C tasks piling up that we really should get to. Eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the cut-off date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh. Oh huh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody other than us would realize it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Absence'? Aren't we done with that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, but think about it. It just doesn't make sense. Why would it all happen at \nexactly\n that same time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat proof did they provide that it was just 'a one time thing'. What says that this \nis\n a statistical anomaly, instead of, for example, 'absence' or some other anomaly disappearing people around the world?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if they're wrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod damn it, why are you always right in the worst situations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of my girlish charm? So how do we want to handle this? I can do some more research first?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNah, you're right. I read the email finally and\u2026 I cannot believe what other Sites think they can get away with. I'm going to yell at somebody, this needs a proper review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't want to seem like a dick! Maybe we can be softer about it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'I don't want to seem like a dick'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen, in all the months that I have known you, have you \never\n considered the optics of a situation before you jump in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 Shut up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just\u2026 what if I'm wrong this time? I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing, you know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's stupid. Don't be like that. You're beautiful, brilliant, and irritatingly correct about terrible things that happen in the Noosphere \u2014 if you say this is suspicious, then it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah. I'm going to go Drygioni on their asses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're \nwhat\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to go Drygioni on their asses, keep up babe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRYGIONI PROTOCOL\n\n\nAs per request by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, M&C Section Head at Site-43, SCP-8843's database file has been flagged for authenticity review. As a part of the Drygioni Protocol, the documentation is reviewed by independent researchers, such that a determination can be made. However, due to the minimal length, Dr. Lillihammer requested that additional data and reports be provided alongside the original document, for further review. The following personnel are assigned to assess this phenomena's documentation and associated materials:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer\n\nSection Chair of Memetics and Countermemetics,\n\nR&C Site-43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Heather Garrison\n\nResearcher of Memetics and Anomalous Ontology,\n\nR&C Site-43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n I can't believe this worked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Is this not a thing that happens often?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Heather, you know what working here is like. You think anything gets peer-reviewed in the Foundation? Know of any anomalies that go through the IRB?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Shut up. Let's just start at the top?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8843 is a statistical anomaly impacting global population data. All census data gathered after February 10th, 2019 has reported a 0.1-5% discrepancy between projections, simulations, and reported totals, such that the census data is inconsistent with birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates, as well as 2019 census data gathered before February 10th, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Okay. They say its statistical, but based on what evidence? Did they do anything to rule it out?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n I think they just looked at the numbers and didn't really give a shit. Would you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n I would if it was my fucking job. Did they provide any proof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Let me pull up the associated documents, those \"should explain everything\", according to the Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Discrepancy:\n The following table illustrates the population discrepancy, as caused by SCP-8843.

What argument could they possibly be making right now? Look at all of the evidence; they just ignored it so they could sand down the rough edges on the totals. They are genuinely saying that the disappearance of nearly 10 million minorities is \"statistical in nature, and requires no further intervention\"?\n\n\nDid they investigate that? Did they check for other anomalies? Did they do \nanything\n other than typing numbers into a calculator, and determine an 'acceptable variance'? Did they even fucking try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Okay, let's assume for a second that they are wrong, and there's more to it than just a rounding error. How can you prove that any of this is connected to 'absence'? Why do \nwe\n need to be the ones to fix anything here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Okay, let's review what we know about 'absence'. It's a conceptual entity that deals in perception, information and memories. More specifically, it:\n\n\n\n\nCan abstract, erase or otherwise remove individuals from the Noosphere;\n\n\nTargets information that is irrelevant, unimportant, or neglected, regardless of how or why;\n\n\nIs obsessed with me.\n\n\n\n\nThe data tells us that, out of everybody in the entire country, the biggest demographic, the largest cultural norm has actually benefitted from this. Yes, once again, white people have benefitted from the disappearance of minorities. What a brand new situation.\n\n\nAnd who are the ones most hurt by SCP-8843? The rest of us. The ones who cannot be categorized. The ones who are least relevant to the census. People who wouldn't be missed. People like us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Right. So if we know that 'absence' targets irrelevant information, and that can extend out to people and identities, then, what we're seeing isn't the manifestation of a statistical anomaly.\n\n\nWhat we're seeing is a potential indication that the Noosphere itself is in danger. Think about it, Heath, we know that 'absence' feeds on information, and we know that it's ravenous. We thought that we had dealt with it, but if we hadn't, and it's still lurking, the Noosphere isn't just going to sit around and wait idly. It's going to do \nsomething\n. Self-preservation, no matter the cost.\n\n\nSo what if it starts to prioritize what it deems as relevant information? Some way of minimizing harm, risk reduction, a way to ensure that there is plenty of irrelevant information, while it can preserve the majority consensus, the ideas that are most prevalent, and therefore, the most 'important'.\n\n\nWhat if the missing people are bait? A distraction? Something to keep 'absence' from going after more of the Noosphere, to stop it from erasing the majority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n If we're right? If we're right about this, then we are the only ones who would have been able to anticipate this. We have to get to the bottom of this; nobody else \ncan\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRYGIONI PROTOCOL: INTERIM SUMMARY\n\n\nFollowing review of the SCP-8843 file and associated addenda, Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer determined that there was insufficient evidence included to logically exclude other anomalous factors, such that the only remaining answer is a statistical anomaly. In fact, due to the minimal evidence provided, Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer have initiated an impromptu abnormal procedura\u2014\n\n\nFuck it, this is scuffed as it is, it's not like me breaking clinical tone in this is going to mean anything. Basically, long story short, they gave us fuck-all and seemingly don't give a fuck about the people we are trying to save? So instead of letting this sit in arbitration and debate for a year, we're doing this differently.\n\n\nThis Drygioni Protocol is now a rolling review. Dr. Lillihammer and myself will be leading the investigative research into what was actually done here, and what is actively happening. This is more than just a few number problems; those numbers are \npeople\n, and we're going to find out what the hell happened to them.\n\n\nSo, to rephrase it in clinical tone for all of you pearl-clutching 'traditional' researchers out there \u2014 Drygioni Protocol review will continue \nad nauseum\n, until a determination on the validity of the conclusions can be made, as based on tangible evidence.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8843 \u2014 Initial Drygioni Protocol Follow-Up Meeting:\n Following the determination that the Drygioni Protocol would continue, a meeting was scheduled between the investigative panel, and Dr. Gage Afters, Coordinator for the Department of Statistics.\n\n\n\n\nDrygioni Call #1\n\n\nDate:\n 21 February, 2019\n\n\nInterviewers:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Heather Garrison, Leading\n\n\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer, Assisting\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Gage Afters\n\n\nNote:\n The initial meeting took place through SCP Foundation Intranet Video Calling, and was recorded for Drygioni Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nVideo recording begins once Dr. Garrison joins the call. Her camera is on, and she is sitting in a beige office. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Lillihammer joins the call. Her camera is also turned on, revealing a similar beige office.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n He's late.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Calm down. He won't give us any answers if you jump down his throat as soon as he joins.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I'm sorry, Lillian, but somebody who fucking says that the disappearance of millions of people is a fucki\u2014\n\n\nDr. Afters joined the video call, and interrupts Heather.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Sorry about that, I was having some camera problems. Can you hear me?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer looks off screen and glares. Dr. Garrison narrows her eyes, before smiling.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Yep! Thanks for joining us.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Hopefully this doesn't take too long, after all, it's just numbers, right?\n\n\nDr. Afters laughs, and then pauses. The call is silent for a number of seconds.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Right. Should we get started?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Great idea ba\u2014 Dr. Lillihammer. <\nPause.\n> Dr. Afters, have you read the SCP-8843 file?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Ye\u2014 yes? I signed off on it before submission, and distributed it. Of course I read the document.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n And you agree with the findings?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my employees. Why?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Okay. Wow. Well, have you read \nany\n of the Drygioni documentation that you've received?\n\n\nDr. Afters looks down.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I don't see why you are investigating an anomaly from the Department of Statistics, do you ladies know anything about statistics?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n \nReally?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Heather.\n\n\nDr. Garrison looks away from her camera, at something off-screen.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer says nothing, but arches an eyebrow.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I'm sorry, I think my connection is bad \u2014 what did you say? Are you familiar with advanced statistics?\n\n\nDr. Garrison clears her throat, and looks back to her camera.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Right. To be honest, I don't need to understand statistics to know that 10 million minorities going missing is a \nbit\n more than a rounding error.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n \nExcuse me\n? You signed off on something you didn't check yourself?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n What is this, a disciplinary hearing? For your information, of course I read the document. A variance of +/-5% is notable, but not world-changing \u2014 it's just a statistics issue, isn't it?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You're\u2026 you're going to wish this was a disciplinary hearing. At least those have rule\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Seriously? Are you fucking kidding me? Jesus fuck, you haven't read \nanything\n we've sent you? And on top of that, you didn't even look at the fucking data?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Dr. Garrison, I do not care for your tone. As for the anomaly, I trust my employees to accurately represent their da\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Then you're as stupid as they are. I'm sharing my screen, since apparently we know more about your anomaly than you do.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n While Heather does that, let me just take a moment and straighten some things out for you, Dr. Afters. This is more than just a 'statistical anomaly'; this potentially represents a K-Class scenario that your department was more than willing to sweep under the rug. You are at fault here \u2014 you failed to validate the data, and \nyou\n distributed the information without verifying that the conclusions reached were accurate.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n How dare you\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You can wait your turn. If you wanted to do anything, you should have taken care of it when it first crossed your desk. Let me make this clear \u2014 if Heather and I had not dug deeper, asked for more data, and followed up on our suspicions, you would be directly responsible for the deaths of 10 million people. Now, we don't even know if we will be able to find out what happened\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Hell! You still might be responsible for that!\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n \nBut\n, unless you are willing to work with us and accept that you made a mistake, there is no point to having this discussion. Now, let me ask you a very simple question: are you willing to cooperate with us, or should we escalate this to both disciplinary and ethics?\n\n\nDr. Garrison barks a laugh, as Lillian stares down her webcam, a smug satisfaction visible. Dr. Afters swallows hard, and takes a deep breath.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n <\nQuietly.\n> Is\u2026 is the data ready for me to see?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Great answer. <\nHeather shares her screen, displaying the data of the demographic analysis.\n> So, can you see why we're having this conversation?\n\n\nDr. Afters squints, as he reads the information on screen. As he does, he frowns.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I would just like to give you both my most sincere apologies. Dr. Lillihammer, I'm sure you're sympathetic, as a department head\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Section chair.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Yes, right. As a section chair, I hope you can understand my desire to protect my subordinates.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Sure. That doesn't excuse this.\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Dr. Lillihammer, perhaps we could reach some agre\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison clears her throat.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Dr. Afters, you are aware I am leading this investigation?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n Yes, but Dr. Lillihammer is your boss. Now, if you'll excuse us, Dr. Lillihammer and I were discussi\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I'm done. Expect to see me at your \npersonal\n ethics hearing.\n\n\nDr. Garrison disconnects from the video call, leaving Dr. Afters and Dr. Lillihammer. Dr. Afters appears annoyed, while Dr. Lillihammer is visibly unimpressed.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Feeling good about your choices?\n\n\nDr. Afters:\n I cannot believe that your subordinate would speak to me so disrespectfully, and with her boss here no less! I'm sure that you will be disciplining her accordingly?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer freezes, before letting out a belly laugh. As she does, Dr. Garrison is visible walking behind Dr. Lillihammer, shaking her head and tensing her fists, before slamming the door shut behind her.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Yeah, yeah, no. Not at all. Unfortunately, unlike you, as a section chair, I like to think before I act. Good luck Gage, you're going to need it.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer disconnects from the video call, leaving Dr. Afters, who stares at his camera in confusion.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n So. Are we going to analyze this too?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Oh, without a doubt. Starting with the fact that Afters is a glorified paper-pusher who allowed this document to be published in the first place, despite not verifying the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Yeah. He is definitely at fault here, but it seems like he isn't going to be of much use. I think we're going to need to figure this out on our own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n What's new?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n I feel like I have to address your conduct here. I agree with you, but I think you went a bit too far in your reaction. Now I just need to decide if it is actionable or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Didn't you already punish me? I distinctly remember you reaming me out after the call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Oh. Yes. Right. And as this is official documentation, I will leave it there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrygioni Internal Discussion #1\n\n\nDate:\n 22 February, 2019\n\n\nAttending:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Heather Garrison\n\n\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Following the interview with Dr. Afters, the researchers met to determine next steps. This impromptu meeting was recorded as part of the Drygioni Protocol \u2014 due to this, only an audio transcript is available.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n \u2014we're recording now. Fucking protocol.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n It's fine. Nobody can see what we're wearing, it's just audio. You were saying something, right before we started recording.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Right. I was saying that, given how little information we gleamed from that call, I'm not sure where to go next. The Department of Statistics won't be much help, and there's only so far we can get by staring at numbers, but, how the hell do we even tackle this?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Let's stop, and restart. From scratch, ignoring all of the 'evidence' that was gathered so far, we're going to walk through this and find out what is really going on here. Namely, what the fuck 'absence' has to do with any of this.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Yeah. Okay, so we know 'absence' shouldn't exist, and we know that it destroys and consumes information, including memories. We also, unfortunately, know that it was trying to erase me. But then we erased my memories, and it should have gone away, right?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Why?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n \nFuck.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n We just assumed that 'absence' would be forced out of existence without your memories but\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n But the idea of me is bigger than just my own memories.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Exactly. You exist in the minds of everybody you have ever met, in the minds of people who have heard about you, read your paper, hell, even passed you on the street!\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No, that can't be right. 'Absence' wasn't connected to me, it was connected to the 'Deadname Meme'. It was\u2014 okay wait. Are you thinking the same thing?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Your Deadname Meme was self-replicating and self-reinforcing. It spread, from person to person, whenever they would hear your name, hear about the \nidea\n of you.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Exactly. By now, my Deadname Meme might have infected people all around the world, just because somebody told a story about me. \nFuck\n, why didn't we realize this sooner?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Hey, babe. Stop. Calm down, it's okay.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Don't tell me to calm down babe! This is\u2014 this is my fault.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n It's not your\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No, it \nis\n my fault.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Prove it then.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Fine. I made my Deadname Meme and connected it with 'absence', because I didn't think about the consequences. I brought 'absence' back into our world.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Sure, but so have countless others throughout time? Why does this have to be you\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I wasn't done. I made the meme self-replicating, self-distributing and self-reinforcing. And I put the idea of my deadname into the very core of that. I put 'absence' into that.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n But we destroyed your memories! Babe, did you forget about the fucking mountain of memories you sacrificed to escape 'absence'? We fucking beat it!\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n We didn't though! As far as the story is concerned, hell, as far as the one \nwe wrote\n, we didn't fucking beat 'absence'. We saved me, sure, but once again, I didn't think about the fucking consequences.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n What were the consequences? Other than, you know, you losing 20 years of memories? Which seems like pretty fucking severe consequences, but we knew that when\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n 'Absence' wanted me. We know this. But we made it impossible to get to me, we isolated me. I was quarantined from the idea, and I escaped. But\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n But nobody else did.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n So 'absence' has an eternal, self-propagating, self-replicating gate into our fucking Noosphere, all because I was too fucking lazy to correct somebody who used my deadna\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Stop.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Don't say that. One, we're still being recorded right now. Two, and more importantly, this is not your fault.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n How could it be anybody else's fault, Lillian? Who else broke the world?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Babe. It's the Foundation. Half of the employees here have done what you did, if not worse.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I'm not other employees.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n I know. So what are you going to do about it?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I don't know.\n\n\nSobbing can be heard.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Come here. Hey, it's okay. Just focus on my breathing, alright? In, and out. Inhale, exhale. Listen to my heart \u2014 you hear it beating, right? Listen to that. Like a metronome. Just\u2026 let it wash over you, and just breathe. Breathe, my love.\n\n\nBreathing, quiet crying and whispers can be heard.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I just\u2026 what if this is \nall\n my fault? What if I'm the reason that so many fucking people like us are just\u2026 gone? What if I caused this?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You are not responsible for the deaths of millions of people. We don't even know if 'absence' killed them, or some other anomaly, or maybe even another Foundation site that fucked up. There's no way to know that you are the reason they are dead.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n \nWait.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n What is it?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I\u2026 we didn't reset everything. We missed something.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n We started from the assumption that SCP-8843 somehow killed\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n There! How do we know that?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n What? That SCP-8843 killed the minorities?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No. How do we know that they're \ndead\n?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n It's 10 million \nmissing\n minorities. Fuck.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Yeah. But that's a good thing, right?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Sure, but\u2026 Okay, idea. We've been frustrated because all we know is numbers. We just see raw data, and that means nothing. It's not who they are, it doesn't help us find out how or what happened to them, it just tells us that \nsomething\n happened.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Exactly. We can't rely on the numbers, we need something else. I just wish we could find somebody and talk to them, but\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n We can.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n We can?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Err, maybe. Probably. Maybe? If\u2014 yeah, okay, I have it.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Are you going to share with the class?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n I was getting to it. Just let me grandstand, okay?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I'm all ears, Lilli.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Numbers are abstract, and more than that, they are so far removed from reality that it's practically meaningless. It tells us nothing about the anomaly, or why it's connected to 'absence', if at all. We need to be more specific.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n What? Narrow it does from global, to country, to state, and on and on, until we have a list of the tens of thousands of missing people in Seattle? Actually, no. We won't. Because they don't exist.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n What if we could get a primary source?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Fuck, if we had a primary source, we wouldn't need to keep the Drygioni protocol going, we could actually get to the bottom of this. But, babe \u2014 how the fuck can we get a primary source if they're all fucking missing?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n \nWhen the voiceless and the nameless collide\n\u2026\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Poetic.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Jackass. You wrote it.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n What? I \ndid\n?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Babe, seriously? I know my memory is perfect, but come on. We deleted half of your memories, do you \nreally\n have that much to keep track of?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Shut up. Just remind me.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You wrote that. In the story, the one we made. The prophecy you rewrote.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n So?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n So? Isn't it obvious what that means?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n You know I ha\u2014 oh my god.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You're the nameless.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n It's Heather, in case you forgot.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Shut up. You know what I mean.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Yeah. I'm the 'nameless' because my deadname is lost. So\u2026 if somebody is voiceless\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Then they can't speak?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n What if it's not literal? Voiceless because\u2026 because they're\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Missing.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Those are the voiceless. The millions who are missing, the ones who are affected by SCP-8843.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n But they're not the missing. You didn't write that. You wrote the 'voiceless'.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n So\u2026 if they're not missing then we just\u2026 we can't hear or see them?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n And they're all still here. Just\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Invisible. Ignored. Forgotten.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n But how did they disappear in the first place? 'Absence' would have consumed them entirely and destroyed them, how could they just\u2026 wake up one day, unable to be perceived? What is it about those people that let that happen? It's not your deadname meme, how would it be global and equal? So what could it be?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Ontological. It's an anomaly interacting with the Noosphere. Like you taught me \u2014 it's always the fucking Noosphere.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Do we have to review this? Do I really have to point out that, yes, despite having an emotional breakdown, a mental break, and crying in the recording, the logic is sound and the conclusions are valid?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n I think we do? But also, do you think anything in this renders our conclusion invalid?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Not in the slightest. I know the Foundation doesn't like to say this, but \nyou can have emotions and still be a good researcher\n! Insane, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8843 \u2014 ONTOLOGICAL/MEMETIC ANALYSIS\n\n\nTo identify SCP-8843's influence in the Noosphere, it is critical to define what it is. To define SCP-8843, we need to understand its ontological basis \u2014 effectively, we need to know what it means at a basal level. We need to find it. This is typically accomplished by examining the anomaly itself. However, given the fact that the anomaly is imperceptible, the current priority is in identifying the rules that govern its behaviours. We need to know \nwhy\n it disproportionately impacted minorities, especially mixed-race individuals.\n\n\nTo do this, we need to define the ontological traits of being a minority, compare those with the ontological traits that govern 'absence', and identify where the overlap is. The following table categorizes, defines and contrasts the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nSCP-8843\n\n\n'Absence'\n\n\nSimilarities / Differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat governs how their victims are chosen?\n\n\nIt primary impacts racial minorities.\n\n\nIt exclusively targets concepts that are not considered 'relevant'.\n\n\nBoth appear to impact individuals who are \nabnormal\n and ideas that are \nnot universal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it do?\n\n\nIt appears to erase an individual from perception.\n\n\nIt appears to erase/consume the concept of an individual.\n\n\nBoth cause an individual to \ndisappear\n. SCP-8843 causes them to be \nimperceptible\n, while 'absence' requires that an individual is \nirrelevant\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the range of their impact?\n\n\nGlobal, across all known human populations.\n\n\nGlobal, across all known human populations.\n\n\nBoth impact all of humanity; therefore, we can assume that both exist on the same plane of conception, most likely, \nthe Noosphere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it interact with information and memories?\n\n\nIt appears to prevent certain information from being perceived, thereby causing it to be forgotten.\n\n\nIt consumes information, but only once the information has been forgotten.\n\n\nWhile SCP-8843 causes individuals to be forgotten, 'absence' only impacts those who are not remembered. Therefore, we can assume that \n'absence' does not cause the initial effect\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we stop it?\n\n\nUnknown.\n\n\nUnknown.\n\n\nBoth are unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above ontological comparison, the following conclusion was drawn:\n\n\n\n\nBoth anomalies interact with the Noosphere, however, their method is different. While 'absence' removes information from the Noosphere, SCP-8843 appears to isolate an idea in the Noosphere, and prevent it from being perceived in reality. However, while 'absence' causes an individual to no longer exist, SCP-8843 appears to only cause an individual to be imperceptible. Therefore, while it is impossible to determine the victims of 'absence' following their disappearance, it \nis\n possible to identify the victims of SCP-8843 as based on the evidence they leave behind. Namely, while we cannot perceive those impacted individuals, we \ncan\n perceive the impact they leave on the world.\n\n\n\n\nBased on this, the researchers determined the following plan to isolate and identify a primary source, to fully understand SCP-8843:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify a population group impacted by SCP-8843\n. This has already been done; SCP-8843 disproportionately impacts multi-racial minorities.\n\n\nLocate a database that includes historical and active data regarding populations, resource use, facility use and more\n. This has been identified as the SCP Foundation internal personnel database. Notably, the personnel database also experienced an approximately 1.7% variance.\n\n\nA location is identified, wherein the resource consumption does not equal that of the projected consumption as based on the population\n. Site-72U, near Toledo, Ohio was selected based on the criteria: while the Site has a roster of 15 employees, utility usage and funding suggests that Site-72U has an actual population of 25 employees. In addition, SCP Foundation DE&I records indicate that Site-72U had a 60% rate of racial minorities as of October, 2018. That rate, as of February 24th, 2019, is 33.4% \u2014 therefore, we can assume that there are 10 individuals impacted by SCP-8843 at Site-72U.\n\n\nAn individual that has been impacted by SCP-8843 is identified\n. Due to the nature of SCP-8843, this appears to be impossible, however, SCP-8843 only renders those individuals to be imperceptible. Therefore, we must identify an alternative method of perceiving and identifying those individuals.\n\n\n'Absence' consumes information and individuals that cannot be perceived. If a method of tracking and identifying 'absence' can be created, then hypothetically, \nwe can use 'absence's ontological signature as a method of identifying locations that are less relevant than others\n. Therefore, if we are able to isolate a conceptual space that is significantly correlated with the presence of 'absence', we may be able to indirectly perceive a victim of SCP-8843.\n\n\n\n\nIt is the belief of the research team in charge of the Drygioni Protocol that such indirect perception will negate the effects of SCP-8843, thus, returning said individual to perception. Therefore, given Dr. Garrison's ontological connection to 'absence', their continued involvement is critical; Dr. Lillihammer's ontological stability is also believed to negate aspects of 'absence's anomalous influence, therefore, her continued involvement is needed.\n\n\nAt present time, a request for remote research has been granted, and Drs. Garrison and Lillihammer are to travel to Site-72U at their earliest convenience. Once a victim has been saved, it will be possible to determine the full impact and cause of SCP-8843, thus concluding the Drygioni Protocol investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n Now, \nthat\n is what I call a sound fucking argument. No notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n Agreed. This appears to be the only objective aspect of SCP-8843's documentation thus far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n We just had to show them how it needed to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrygioni SCP-8843 Field Investigation Log #1\n\n\nDate:\n 25 February, 2019\n\n\nInvestigators:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Heather Garrison\n\n\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Staff Present:\n Dr. Jordan Wheeler, Containment Specialist\n\n\nNote:\n Both researchers were equipped with a hands-free recording device to ensure full documentation.

He checks his watch, and fidgets. After a minute, he pulls out his cellphone \u2014 as he does, a sedan arrives, and two women step out, dazzlecoats billowing behind them.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Hi! Are you Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Yes. Out of the way, please.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Lillian. Really? <\nDr. Garrison shoots a glare at Dr. Lillihammer, before turning to face Dr. Wheeler.\n> You're Dr. Wheeler?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Yes! I think we spoke over email a bit. You two are here for some kind of investigation?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Something like that.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler stands awkwardly, as the two women stare back.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Can we go inside?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I just\u2026 <\nA pause.\n> I thought there was something I was going to say but\u2026 I can't remember it.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n <\nFrowning.\n> Lilli, you think?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n At least we know we're in the right place.\n\n\n\n\nThe three researchers stand inside a meeting room within Site-72U. It's a medium size, but bland.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n So feel free to use this meeting room as a temporary office, it's too big for our team. We used to have to meet in here to accommodate everybody but\u2026 <\nHe freezes.\n> Sorry. Never mind. Ignore me.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Hold on, Jordan. Sorry, can I call you Jordan?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler shakes his head, and regains awareness of the situation.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n You can! I'm sorry about that, I don't know what's going on with me. I wasn't like this before, but ever since late last year I've been\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Foggy?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Like the idea disappears while I'm thinking it.\n\n\nDr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer share a look, and frown.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Well I'm Heather, and this lovely lady is my girlfriend, Lillian. Hopefully, we should be out of your hair soon, but if I can ask you some questions, it would really help us out!\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Oh yeah! For sure, I'd be happy to help! We don't really deal with too many anomalies here at Site-72U. Our motto is \"We're Here if They Need Us.\" <\nLaughs.\n> What did you want to know?\n\n\nDr. Garrison gestures to a chair, and the three sit down at the conference room table. Dr. Garrison pulls out a portable terminal, and logs in. She pulls open a spreadsheet \u2014 it has demographic data on it.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n So, Jordan, how many people work at Site-72U?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n We just hired our fifteenth researcher, so we're still small. We do what we can, but we're just a skeleton crew, ma'am.\n\n\nDr. Garrison flinches.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Ha, you got called \"ma'am\", and I'm older than you. <\nShe turns to face Dr. Wheeler.\n> And you're sure about that?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Yes, I just finished their orientation yesterday. We have fifteen employees at the Site.\n\n\nA pause. Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer share a look. A moment later, and Dr. Garrison clears her throat.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Dr. Wheeler, you seem to have a strong understanding of this Site, is that correct?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n I would hope so! I'm the facilities coordinator too. <\nHe smiles.\n> Like I said, skeleton crew. We've all been picking up the slack lately.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer gives Dr. Garrison a pointed stare. She nods in return.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Can you tell me how many dormitories you have?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Our staff tends to live on-site, since it's more convenient, so we built the site with 40 dorms, with room to expand.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n How many rooms are unoccupied right now, Jordan?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Fifteen.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Are you sure? Completely certain?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Positive. We fill them in order, and Dr. Kenneth just moved into room twenty-five.\n\n\nBeat.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Did you hear it?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I did. Did you, Jordan?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Hear what? No?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n By your account, you have fifteen employees. And your fifteenth employee was just placed in room twenty-five. <\nA pause.\n> How can that be right?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n That can't be right. It shouldn't be\u2026 No. That doesn't make sense.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Well shit, Heather, you broke his brain.\n\n\nDr. Garrison lightly slaps Dr. Lillihammer's arm.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Shut up, I didn't break his bra\u2014\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n Is that who you're here for? For\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Your missing ten coworkers? Yeah. That's why we're here.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Now we just need to break a few rules.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Following this exchange, video capture experienced interference and digital corruption. Investigations into the cause were inconclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n By this point, our theory was pretty much confirmed, but we had to isolate an individual to verify our hypothesis. Thankfully, due to our memetics expertise, and unique predisposition towards locating ideas that should not exist, we felt that this would be the easy part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer:\n And when this comes up in review, because I know it will \u2014 Dr. Wheeler was not the problem here. He might be green, or just a small-Site researcher, but \nhe\n is not responsible for their disappearances. He is not responsible for finding them.\n\n\nWe are. The Foundation, as an organization, \nis\n.\n\n\nThe problem is in how little the Foundation prioritizes education, memetics training and continual reinforcement. This wasn't a one-off, we just chose a Site that would be easiest to prove our theory.

It's just a lot to process.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n What are you seeing?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Everything I usually see, but\u2026 strings. Connections.

A few seconds later, they separate, breathing heavily.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Okay. Let's do this shit.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n What do you need from me?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Just help us navigate. What's going on, Heather?\n\n\nDr. Garrison crouches to the floor, reaching out to the concrete below, and grasping at the air.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n There are colored strands everywhere, running like wires throughout everything. They overlap and look like they're pulsing, like a subway map \u2014 Noospheric connections?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Most likely. Anything stand out?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Yeah. There's this one that's different. Most of them, they look like thin wires, colorful strands that pulse with energy, wrapped around each other. Almost delicate, a silk strand that crosses over others, interwoven into a tapestry \u2014 and then there's this one. It's deep purple, almost black. It pulsates, like a worm inching forward with every second. It's thick, strangling, almost like a kudzu vine. <\nShe shakes her head.\n> Yeah. I think this is it?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n What is 'it'?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n 'Absence'. Or at least, it feels like 'absence', feels like\u2026 like it's a part of me.\n\n\nDr. Garrison begins to walk through the hallways, staring at the floor, tracing an invisible rope, as Dr. Lillihammer and Dr. Wheeler trail behind her.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 10 minutes of methodic traversal of Site-72U, Dr. Garrison stops in front of a doorway.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n This is it.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n What's it?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Who lives in this room, Dr. Wheeler?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler looks at the door. It reads, '#21'.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n What? Nobody. This is a storage room.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n It is? Why is a storage room in the dormitory hallways?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler pauses.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n I don't\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n And why would a storage room have a sign that reads 'Knock First'?\n\n\nDr. Wheeler freezes, turning to look at Dr. Garrison.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n I didn't realize. How long have I been ignoring the\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Hey. Don't do that. You didn't know.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You \ncouldn't\n know. You are not to blame. All we can do now is help out whomever we can. Whoever used to live in here. <\nShe turns to Dr. Garrison.\n> Ready?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n I guess so.\n\n\nDr. Garrison scans her keycard and the door unlocks. She pulls it open; the dormitory appears as a standard Foundation-issue personnel dormitory, with unidentified personal effects strewn within. There are no identifying items within the dormitory, however, there are clothes strewn across the room, indicating that a male-presenting individual resided in this dormitory, at some point. Otherwise, the room is empty.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n <\nPanicking.\n> Do you two see that?\n\n\nNeither Dr. Wheeler or Dr. Lillihammer responds.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n You don't see him? Standing right there? A person, in the fucking corner of the room?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n We\u2026 we don't see anybody in there babe.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n The cord, the vine \u2014 it's winding around him, wrapping tight, like a strangling snake, choking him out of existence. Fuck, what am I supposed to do here, Lillian?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n I\u2026 I don't know. Do we want to regroup, and fi\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Hello? Can you hear me? <\nShakes her head.\n> No, they're not responding. It's like they're in some kind of conceptual stasis\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Can you get rid of the influence? Can you remove the vines?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No. I can still feel 'absence'. It was weak, almost like it had forgotten about them too, but now\u2026 it's getting stronger. It's throbbing through the vines and getting tighter and tighter \u2014 god babe, I think 'absence' is coming.\n\n\nDr. Wheeler:\n What's going on?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n One second, Jordan \u2014 Heather, we need to get you out of here. Now.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer moves to grab Dr. Garrison's hand, but is slapped away.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No. I can't. If I leave, then 'absence' is going to come back and who knows what the fuck will happen next. They might not be here any longer, not after\u2026 No, I can't run. Hey! Hey! Hey, fuckhead! Wake up!\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Babe, we need to leave. Now.\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n No, I'm not going to just\u2014\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n That's not a question, that's a\u2014\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Lillian, I can't run away anymore. <\nShe enters the room.\n> Okay, fine. If you can't hear me, I'll drag your ass back into the real world myself. <\nDr. Garrison grabs towards the corner of the room.\n>\n\n\nInterference and static cuts in through all recordings of this moment. The cause is believed to be linked to SCP-8843 or 'absence', though this is unconfirmed. When footage returns, an unknown individual stands, the front of their shirt grabbed in Dr. Garrison's fist.\n\n\nUnknown Individual:\n Who\u2014 who are you?\n\n\nDr. Garrison:\n Funny. We were about to ask you the same question.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Following the conclusion of this recording, the unknown individual was identified as Dr. Winston Cheung-Levitt, an employee of Site-72U. This knowledge retroactively propagated throughout SCP Foundation documentation accordingly, following their redefinition into baseline reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRYGIONI PROTOCOL: CONCLUSION\n\n\nFollowing the completion of the Drygioni Protocol investigation by Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer, a determination was made regarding the validity of the original SCP-8843 documentation. As based on evidence collected during the investigation, namely, the appearance of a missing Foundation researcher that self-identified as mixed-race, it was concluded that SCP-8843 was more than a simple 'statistical anomaly', and in fact, was anomalously responsible for the active disappearance of millions of minorities around the globe.\n\n\nFollowing this review, an updated proposal for documentation was provided by the leading researchers. It is included below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8843\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nSafe\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-8843 is uncontained at this time, and cannot be contained through traditional means. SCP-8843 must be negated at a conceptual level \u2014 development of a solution is presently underway by the lead SCP-8843 Researchers, Dr. Heather Garrison and Dr. Lillian Lillihammer.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8843 is an ontological anomaly existing exclusively within the Noosphere, influencing all information in human consciousness. SCP-8843 causes individuals to attempt to categorize others, as based on major groupings, stereotypes or categories. If an individual cannot be easily categorized, due to existing across multiple groupings, or due to other alternative sources of ambiguity, SCP-8843 causes that individual to 'abstract', and be imperceptible within baseline reality.\n\n\nAs a result, while these individuals may continue to exist for a period of time, they will inevitably conceptually destabilize, either resultant from natural ontological erosion, or Noospheric predation from entities such as 'absence'.\n\n\nAt present time, there is only a single method of reversing the effect of SCP-8843, that is unable to scale to save all impacted individuals. Research into negating SCP-8843, or isolating those individuals from 'absence' is the primary focus of research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrison:\n We are going to figure this out. Even if that takes neutralizing 'absence', I won't give up until I have saved everyone I can.

        "Description: SCP-8843 is a statistical anomaly impacting global population data. All census data gathered after February 10th, 2019 has reported a 0.1-5% discrepancy between projections, simulations, and reported totals, such that the census data is inconsistent with birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates, as well as 2019 census data gathered before February 10th, 2019.",
        "Both anomalies interact with the Noosphere, however, their method is different. While 'absence' removes information from the Noosphere, SCP-8843 appears to isolate an idea in the Noosphere, and prevent it from being perceived in reality. However, while 'absence' causes an individual to no longer exist, SCP-8843 appears to only cause an individual to be imperceptible. Therefore, while it is impossible to determine the victims of 'absence' following their disappearance, it is possible to identify the victims of SCP-8843 as based on the evidence they leave behind. Namely, while we cannot perceive those impacted individuals, we can perceive the impact they leave on the world.",

    "description": "SCP-8843 is an ontological anomaly existing exclusively within the Noosphere, influencing all information in human consciousness. SCP-8843 causes individuals to attempt to categorize others, as based on major groupings, stereotypes or categories. If an individual cannot be easily categorized, due to existing across multiple groupings, or due to other alternative sources of ambiguity, SCP-8843 causes that individual to 'abstract', and be imperceptible within baseline reality.",
