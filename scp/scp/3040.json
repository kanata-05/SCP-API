SCP-3040-1 may file for additional furniture items, which are to be reviewed and approved by site personnel. \nSCP-3040-1 is allowed to move around Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588 as it pleases, as long as it is accompanied by two Level-2 personnel at all times.\n SCP-3040-1 is no longer granted wandering privileges. Any requests for SCP-3040 to be amputated are to be ignored by all Foundation personnel.\n\n\nOnly objects larger than 20\u00a0cm\n3\n are allowed to enter SCP-3040-1's containment unit, in order to prevent the anomalous properties of SCP-3040 from manifesting. This protocol may be suspended for research purposes only. \nWhen allowed to roam the Facility, SCP-3040-1 must be presented with an item\n1\n to hold with SCP-3040. Refusal to do so will result in a suspension of her roaming permission.\n If SCP-3040-1 must leave its containment cell, a 10\u00a0cm\n3\n wooden cube is to be held by SCP-3040. This cube cannot have writing or any methods of conveying information on it.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3040-1 refers to former Agent Sharlene Vangarre, who lost her left hand due to the failed capture of an anomaly in Incident \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u03b1\n\n\nSCP-3040 refers to the area where SCP-3040-1's left hand was. SCP-3040 is not visible on the electromagnetic spectrum, nor is it detectable by chemical means. SCP-3040-1 describes it as a \"phantom limb,\" which it senses at all times despite nothing physically being present. It states it has full control over the limb, yet expresses that the limb causes constant discomfort at all times.\n\n\nSCP-3040's anomalous properties manifest once SCP-3040-1 attempts to grasp an object equal to or smaller than 20\u00a0cm\n3\n with the missing hand. Upon doing so, the object will vanish entirely, and cannot be recovered unless SCP-3040-1 places the object in the precise location it occupied before, relative to the object's surroundings. No more than one object can be held at a time by SCP-3040. If asked to place a held object elsewhere, SCP-3040-1 will express distress and discomfort, claiming that it cannot release the object. Items that disappear appear in SCP-3040-A.\n\n\nSCP-3040-A is an extradimensional void of unknown volume only accessible by items \"held\" by SCP-3040. GPS devices do not work within SCP-3040-A, but electronic equipment does function within SCP-3040-A if running on an internal power source. SCP-3040-A is usually empty, however some objects have been observed within video footage. No object persists for more than a fraction of a second, and the Foundation has yet to interact with one of the objects within SCP-3040-A. All objects visible within SCP-3040-A were at one point placed within SCP-3040-A. \nIt is theorized that SCP-3040-A is a localized time anomaly that can have no effect on the outside world, excluding the act of taking the object in.\n\n\nUPDATE: See Addendum 2-A for information on recently observed properties of SCP-3040-A.\n\n\nAddendum 1-A:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3040-1, Foundation Agent that is the host of SCP-3040\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor May Nathans, medical doctor trained in treating amputees.\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted with SCP-3040-1 after her recovery from the incident, and resulted in the discovery of SCP-3040. Doctor Nathans was assigned to SCP-3040-1 due to her training.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 12:58, 4/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588>\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Hello Agent Vangarre.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n \u2026Hey.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n How're you feeling? Any lingering pains?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Yeah. Still feels like I have my hand, but\u2026I know it's not there.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n I see. So you feel as if you're experiencing a phantom limb, of sorts?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Yes, doc. It's not there, I can't exactly feel an actual limb.\n\n\nDr. Nathans audibly sighs, before speaking again.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Agent, there is no need to be so sarcastic.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Sorry. Just\u2026kinda strained from literally losing a hand, y'know?\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n I understand.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Anyways, why\u2019re you here? I already had a different doc assigned to me.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Well, after you reported discomfort stemming from your amputated limb, they referred me to check up on you. Are you sure everything is okay?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n I'm fine, doc, really. Just some PLS, that's all. That's normal-ish, right?\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n It is, yes. But I need to make sure. Could you show me your arm, please?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1 complies, and lifts her left arm. Dr. Nathans examines it for a few seconds, noting the stump of flesh, and nods.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Everything seems fine visually.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Told you.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n And it\u2019s just a sort of ache where your hand used to be?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n An ache, and I can still feel the hand, kinda. Like an afterimage I can move. That\u2019s what PLS is like normally, right?\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Some experience that, yes. Though it is curious how you\u2019re experiencing this so soon after losing your hand\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Just my body being a bit weird, doc. Nothing big about it. Don\u2019t worry. I just need to recover and I\u2019ll be a-okay and ready for duty again. That mission was botched from the get-go when Duncan\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3040-1 grumbles inaudibly for a few seconds, before Nathans clears her throat.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n That doesn\u2019t matter. Since you\u2019re experiencing some form of PLS, I\u2019ll be sure to refer you to therapy so you can get back on the job soon.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n If they don\u2019t let me go \u2018cause of my missing hand.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n It\u2019s very possible you may retain your position. You are right handed, yes?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n Yeah. I can still shoot with my right hand, and a simple prosthetic could give me support\u2026I just worry, y\u2019know? Especially for Duncan. Even though-\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n This meeting isn\u2019t about Agent Banner.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1 sighs, and nods.\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Now, do you have any questions before I go?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n No, doc. I\u2019m good. Well\u2026\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n Well what?\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n I just\u2026wanna try grabbing something. Just to prove to myself my hand isn\u2019t there. Can you hand me that pen?\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n If you wish. Here.\n\n\nDr. Nathans holds a small, ballpoint pen up, near where SCP-3040-1's hand would have been. A look of concentration crosses her face, before the pen disappears. Both are silent for a few moments, before the pen re-appears and SCP-3040-1 drops her arm.\n\n\nSCP-3040-1:\n W\u2026what the hell?\n\n\nDr. Nathans:\n \u2026I need to report this. I'm sorry, Sharlene, but I have to.\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-3040-1 remained unresponsive until it was transferred to its containment unit. Its phantom limb was then classified as SCP-3040.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1-B:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experimental\u00a0logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1 - 4/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A ballpoint pen\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the ballpoint pen with her missing hand.\n\n\nResults:\n The pen vanished from view once the pen was grasped. Chemical, visual, and physical analysis of the region where the pen had been indicated that the pen was not simply invisible, but no longer present. After the pen was placed down, it reappeared in the identical position and state it was in prior to being lifted.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \"The pen disappeared in all ways. No chemical, physical, or electromagnetic detection was possible. Perhaps the object was teleported elsewhere?\" - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 2 - 4/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A ballpoint pen, with a small GPS tracker attached\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the ballpoint pen with her missing hand.\n\n\nResults:\n Once again, the pen disappeared, leaving no physical or chemical trace. Upon vanishing, the GPS signal immediately winked out. Once SCP-3040-1 released the pen, the GPS signal reappeared.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \"The GPS tracker did not output a signal. Wherever the object is taken, it is either in a location outside of GPS reach, or simply not in this world at all.\" - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 7 - 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A 20\u00a0cm\n3\n block of wood, followed by a 15\u00a0cm\n3\n block of wood, followed by a 10\u00a0cm\n3\n block of wood.\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp each block of wood sequentially.\n\n\nResults:\n All three blocks of wood disappeared.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \"Upper limit is 20\u00a0cm\n3\n, it seems. Previous four tests corroborate that nothing larger than this size can be held. Useful information for future tests. Perhaps cameras can work when no longer visible?\" - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 8 - 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A small GoPro camera.\n\n\nProcedure:\n The camera was set to record, and SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for twenty seconds, then to place it down.\n\n\nResults:\n The camera disappeared, much like the previous objects, and appeared once again once SCP-3040-1 released it. The camera was fully functional afterwards. Please see Addendum 1-C for sustained footage.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \"The location objects go to seems to be devoid of anything, aside from what was introduced before. Unsure if those are physical or incorporeal manifestations, and due to their short manifestation period it is unlikely I will be able to test that. Further testing of how objects behave inside of SCP-3040-A is needed.\" - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 13 - 6/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A mug of hot coffee.\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the handle of the mug, and once the object disappeared, was instructed to pour it out before setting it down again.\n\n\nResults:\n The mug, upon return, was still filled with hot coffee. The volume and temperature of the liquid had not changed at all, despite SCP-3040-1 confirming she tried to pour it out.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \"Objects inside are resistant to being changed in a way that alters them physically. The temperature of the coffee also did not change. Digital thermometers pegged the internal temperature of SCP-3040-A at about -268C\u00b0 as well. The lack in temperature alteration may be due to SCP-3040-A being a total vacuum, or perhaps any physical changes are impossible \u2013 including the loss of heat energy. More video records, and perhaps a digital atmospheric scanner, are needed.\" - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddentum 1-C:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Documentation\u00a0from\u00a0Experiment\u00a08\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nNote: Due to the loss of the original footage, only the textual documentation written by Dr. Klaus remains.\n\n\n\n\nThe recording begins with a short clip of SCP-3040-1. It looks directly at the camera, before reaching out to it with the limb that is host to SCP-3040. After contact with SCP-3040 is made, the video cuts to a seemingly endless and empty white expanse. A quiet hum can be heard through the speakers for the entire duration of the remaining clip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter exactly 8.73 seconds, a ballpoint pen identical to the one used in Experiment 1 appears for approximately 0.25 seconds. After 3.61 seconds, a pen identical to the one utilized in Experiment 2 appears. In the last three seconds of the video, the three wooden blocks from Experiment 7 appear sequentially, exactly one second apart. The video cuts abruptly back to SCP-3040-1, which is looking towards Dr. Klaus. The footage ends there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2-A:\n\n\nFurther testing within SCP-3040-A revealed multiple temporal anomalies affecting the dimension. These anomalies include the following:\n\n\n\n\nAny electronic recording device within SCP-3040-A will have all files related to SCP-3040-A altered if placed into SCP-3040-A more than once. Alterations to the files only consist of changing all past files to contain all objects recently introduced into the time loop. Importantly, this affects any copies of the files as well, regardless of if they were present on the device at the time of re-introduction or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3040-A exists within a persistent minute-long time loop. Any item inserted within SCP-3040-A will appear within all following loops at the precise moment they appeared, and will persist for 0.25 seconds without fail. No observed objects within SCP-3040-A persist for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny and all living organisms will enter a form of stasis. Cells will cease to function temporarily but will not die, and all brain activity ceases as well. Organisms display no ill effects due to this stasis. Any electronic device attached to the organism will continue to function and monitor the organism, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an object is placed within SCP-3040-A, removed, altered, then placed back within SCP-3040-A, all electronic information involving the object will change to have the most recent version of the object present. This does not affect data created before 4/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588.\n2\n\n\n\n\nSee Addendum 2-B for experiments relating to the discovery of these traits.\n\n\nAddendum 2-B:\n\n\nThe following experiments resulted in the discovery of numerous, previously unknown, traits of SCP-3040-A.\n\n\nExperiment 14 - 6/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n The same camera utilized in Experiment 8. All files removed and uploaded to the Foundation database beforehand.\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for twenty seconds, then to place it down.\n\n\nResults:\n The camera disappeared, much like the previous objects, and appeared once again once SCP-3040-1 released it. The camera was fully functional afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording begins with a short clip of SCP-3040-1. It looks directly at the camera, before reaching out to it with the limb that is host to SCP-3040. After contact with SCP-3040 is made, the video cuts to a seemingly endless and empty white expanse. A quiet hum can be heard through the speakers for the entire duration of the remaining clip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 8 seconds, a ballpoint pen identical to the one used in Experiment 1 appears for approximately 0.25 seconds. After 3 seconds, a pen identical to the one utilized in Experiment 2 appears. After approximately three seconds, the three wooden blocks from Experiment 7 appear sequentially, exactly one second apart. Then, after exactly 0.5 seconds, the camera utilized in Experiment 8\n3\n manifested for 0.25 seconds. The objects utilized in experiments 9-13 also appeared at various time points, until a total of twenty seconds had passed. The video cuts abruptly back to SCP-3040-1, which is glancing off to the side. The footage ends there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \u201cFootage from Experiment 14 shows no new anomalies. Comparison with Experiment 8, however, revealed a new trait of SCP-3040-A. All footage regarding Experiment 8 now matches Experiment 14, though it appears to have been shot from a different angle. None of the files show any tampering, and have not been viewed since my original viewing. Further experimentation is required. This is potentially concerning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 15 - 6/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A new GoPro camera of the same make and model used in prior experiments.\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for three minutes, then to place it down.\n\n\nResults:\n Footage from Experiments 8 and 14 was not overwritten. Camera was undamaged and still fully functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording begins with a short clip of SCP-3040-1 much like prior experiments. It looks directly at the camera, before reaching out to it with the limb that is host to SCP-3040. After contact with SCP-3040 is made, the video cuts to SCP-3040-A. A quiet hum can be heard through the speakers for the entire duration of the remaining clip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 8 seconds, a ballpoint pen identical to the one used in Experiment 1 appears for approximately 0.25 seconds. After 3 seconds, a pen identical to the one utilized in Experiment 2 appears. After approximately three seconds, the three wooden blocks from Experiment 7 appear sequentially, exactly one second apart. Then, after exactly 0.5 seconds, two instances of the camera utilized in Experiment 8 and 14 manifested for 0.25 seconds. Both cameras manifested facing each other, approximately three meters apart. The objects utilized in experiments 9-13 also appeared at various time points. After the mug utilized in Experiment 13 vanished, approximately 20 seconds had passed in the video. 48 seconds passed before the manifestations began, once again starting with the ballpoint pen and ending with the coffee mug utilized in experiment 13. This would repeat once again, before the camera was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\n \u201cSCP-3040-A did not cause the data of Experiment 8 and Experiment 14 to change. It is not similar objects that are affected, but the exact same object. Also of note is the length of the observed pattern. All objects persist for the same amount of time, and all objects appear at the same time without fail. This indicates either a time loop, or a constant repetition of patterns. Due to the other temporal traits of SCP-3040-A, I am inclined to believe it is a time loop.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nIncident 3040-1 - 6/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588\n\n\nOn 6/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588, video footage containing the coffee mug utilized in Experiment 13 appeared to change, despite the files being unedited. This coincides with a separate experiment performed by Dr. Klaus, which utilized the same coffee mug without any fluid in it.\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 12:35 in Site-\u2588\u2588 on 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588, numerous researchers can be seen around a table. An empty coffee mug\n4\n is seen on the table, adjacent to numerous papers. One researcher reaches for the papers, and inadvertently causes the mug to fall on its side. All adjacent papers appear to stain, as if coffee was poured on them, despite no coffee being visible in the mug. Researchers scramble, and act as if coffee had been spilled despite no liquid being visible on the video feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 13:56 on 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588, the same mug was seen in the hands of Dr. Klaus. He motions as if he is drinking it, yet no liquid is seen within the mug.\n\n\n\n\nAfter this incident, Dr. Klaus asserted that in both situations, the mug had been full of coffee. He claimed that a similar effect had been observed with earlier testing of SCP-3040-A, but it did not affect non-digital objects.\n\n\n\n\n\"What was once thought to be an isolated dimension now shows that it can literally alter digital history. Memories, physical evidence, and everything else is unaffected. But digital recordings can be completely rewritten, and we may never know. The fact it can rewrite our records without our awareness \u2013 without a trace \u2013 is enough for me to ask for a reclassification to Euclid, and perhaps seek ways to neutralize it. Primarily for the safety and preservation of our data. SCP-3040-1 must be kept under careful observation. Allowing it to wander the facility now may prove too dangerous unless specific actions are taken to minimize the chances of SCP-3040 altering information on our records.\u201d - Dr. Klaus\n\n\n\n\nFurther testing of SCP-3040-A has been suspended to maintain stability and reliability of digital records. SCP-3040 upgraded to \u201cEuclid\u201d. Any requests for amputation of SCP-3040 are to be rejected until further notice.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Such as a coffee mug, ballpoint pen, or any item less than 20\u00a0cm\n3\n.\n\n\n2\n. This is the same date that SCP-3040-1 lost its left hand.\n\n\n3\n. It is important to note that the camera utilized in Experiment 14 and Experiment 8 were the exact same camera.\n\n\n4\n.

        "Interviewed: SCP-3040-1, Foundation Agent that is the host of SCP-3040 Interviewer: Doctor May Nathans, medical doctor trained in treating amputees. Foreword: This interview was conducted with SCP-3040-1 after her recovery from the incident, and resulted in the discovery of SCP-3040. Doctor Nathans was assigned to SCP-3040-1 due to her training. <Begin Log, 12:58, 4/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588> Dr. Nathans: Hello Agent Vangarre. SCP-3040-1: \u2026Hey. Dr. Nathans: How're you feeling?

Even though- Dr. Nathans: This meeting isn\u2019t about Agent Banner. SCP-3040-1 sighs, and nods. Dr. Nathans: Now, do you have any questions before I go? SCP-3040-1: No, doc. I\u2019m good. Well\u2026 Dr. Nathans: Well what? SCP-3040-1: I just\u2026wanna try grabbing something. Just to prove to myself my hand isn\u2019t there. Can you hand me that pen? Dr. Nathans: If you wish. Here. Dr. Nathans holds a small, ballpoint pen up, near where SCP-3040-1's hand would have been. A look of concentration crosses her face, before the pen disappears. Both are silent for a few moments, before the pen re-appears and SCP-3040-1 drops her arm. SCP-3040-1: W\u2026what the hell? Dr. Nathans: \u2026I need to report this. I'm sorry, Sharlene, but I have to. Closing Statement: SCP-3040-1 remained unresponsive until it was transferred to its containment unit. Its phantom limb was then classified as SCP-3040.",
        "Subject: A ballpoint pen Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the ballpoint pen with her missing hand. Results: The pen vanished from view once the pen was grasped. Chemical, visual, and physical analysis of the region where the pen had been indicated that the pen was not simply invisible, but no longer present. After the pen was placed down, it reappeared in the identical position and state it was in prior to being lifted. Analysis: \"The pen disappeared in all ways. No chemical, physical, or electromagnetic detection was possible. Perhaps the object was teleported elsewhere?\" - Dr. Klaus",
        "Subject: A ballpoint pen, with a small GPS tracker attached Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the ballpoint pen with her missing hand. Results: Once again, the pen disappeared, leaving no physical or chemical trace. Upon vanishing, the GPS signal immediately winked out. Once SCP-3040-1 released the pen, the GPS signal reappeared. Analysis: \"The GPS tracker did not output a signal. Wherever the object is taken, it is either in a location outside of GPS reach, or simply not in this world at all.\" - Dr. Klaus",
        "Subject: A 20\u00a0cm 3 block of wood, followed by a 15\u00a0cm 3 block of wood, followed by a 10\u00a0cm 3 block of wood. Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp each block of wood sequentially. Results: All three blocks of wood disappeared. Analysis: \"Upper limit is 20\u00a0cm 3 , it seems. Previous four tests corroborate that nothing larger than this size can be held. Useful information for future tests. Perhaps cameras can work when no longer visible?\" - Dr. Klaus",
        "Subject: A small GoPro camera. Procedure: The camera was set to record, and SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for twenty seconds, then to place it down. Results: The camera disappeared, much like the previous objects, and appeared once again once SCP-3040-1 released it. The camera was fully functional afterwards. Please see Addendum 1-C for sustained footage. Analysis: \"The location objects go to seems to be devoid of anything, aside from what was introduced before. Unsure if those are physical or incorporeal manifestations, and due to their short manifestation period it is unlikely I will be able to test that. Further testing of how objects behave inside of SCP-3040-A is needed.\" - Dr. Klaus",
        "Subject: A mug of hot coffee. Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the handle of the mug, and once the object disappeared, was instructed to pour it out before setting it down again. Results: The mug, upon return, was still filled with hot coffee. The volume and temperature of the liquid had not changed at all, despite SCP-3040-1 confirming she tried to pour it out. Analysis: \"Objects inside are resistant to being changed in a way that alters them physically. The temperature of the coffee also did not change. Digital thermometers pegged the internal temperature of SCP-3040-A at about -268C\u00b0 as well. The lack in temperature alteration may be due to SCP-3040-A being a total vacuum, or perhaps any physical changes are impossible \u2013 including the loss of heat energy. More video records, and perhaps a digital atmospheric scanner, are needed.\" - Dr. Klaus",
        "The recording begins with a short clip of SCP-3040-1. It looks directly at the camera, before reaching out to it with the limb that is host to SCP-3040. After contact with SCP-3040 is made, the video cuts to a seemingly endless and empty white expanse. A quiet hum can be heard through the speakers for the entire duration of the remaining clip.",
        "After exactly 8.73 seconds, a ballpoint pen identical to the one used in Experiment 1 appears for approximately 0.25 seconds. After 3.61 seconds, a pen identical to the one utilized in Experiment 2 appears. In the last three seconds of the video, the three wooden blocks from Experiment 7 appear sequentially, exactly one second apart. The video cuts abruptly back to SCP-3040-1, which is looking towards Dr. Klaus. The footage ends there.",
        "Subject: The same camera utilized in Experiment 8. All files removed and uploaded to the Foundation database beforehand. Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for twenty seconds, then to place it down. Results: The camera disappeared, much like the previous objects, and appeared once again once SCP-3040-1 released it. The camera was fully functional afterwards.",

        "Analysis: \u201cFootage from Experiment 14 shows no new anomalies. Comparison with Experiment 8, however, revealed a new trait of SCP-3040-A. All footage regarding Experiment 8 now matches Experiment 14, though it appears to have been shot from a different angle. None of the files show any tampering, and have not been viewed since my original viewing. Further experimentation is required. This is potentially concerning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Klaus",
        "Subject: A new GoPro camera of the same make and model used in prior experiments. Procedure: SCP-3040-1 was instructed to grasp the camera for three minutes, then to place it down. Results: Footage from Experiments 8 and 14 was not overwritten. Camera was undamaged and still fully functional.",

        "After 8 seconds, a ballpoint pen identical to the one used in Experiment 1 appears for approximately 0.25 seconds. After 3 seconds, a pen identical to the one utilized in Experiment 2 appears. After approximately three seconds, the three wooden blocks from Experiment 7 appear sequentially, exactly one second apart. Then, after exactly 0.5 seconds, two instances of the camera utilized in Experiment 8 and 14 manifested for 0.25 seconds. Both cameras manifested facing each other, approximately three meters apart. The objects utilized in experiments 9-13 also appeared at various time points. After the mug utilized in Experiment 13 vanished, approximately 20 seconds had passed in the video. 48 seconds passed before the manifestations began, once again starting with the ballpoint pen and ending with the coffee mug utilized in experiment 13. This would repeat once again, before the camera was removed.",
        "Analysis: \u201cSCP-3040-A did not cause the data of Experiment 8 and Experiment 14 to change. It is not similar objects that are affected, but the exact same object. Also of note is the length of the observed pattern. All objects persist for the same amount of time, and all objects appear at the same time without fail. This indicates either a time loop, or a constant repetition of patterns. Due to the other temporal traits of SCP-3040-A, I am inclined to believe it is a time loop.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Klaus",
        "At approximately 12:35 in Site-\u2588\u2588 on 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588, numerous researchers can be seen around a table. An empty coffee mug 4 is seen on the table, adjacent to numerous papers. One researcher reaches for the papers, and inadvertently causes the mug to fall on its side. All adjacent papers appear to stain, as if coffee was poured on them, despite no coffee being visible in the mug. Researchers scramble, and act as if coffee had been spilled despite no liquid being visible on the video feed.",
        "At 13:56 on 5/\u2588\u2588/1\u2588, the same mug was seen in the hands of Dr. Klaus. He motions as if he is drinking it, yet no liquid is seen within the mug.",
        "\"What was once thought to be an isolated dimension now shows that it can literally alter digital history. Memories, physical evidence, and everything else is unaffected. But digital recordings can be completely rewritten, and we may never know. The fact it can rewrite our records without our awareness \u2013 without a trace \u2013 is enough for me to ask for a reclassification to Euclid, and perhaps seek ways to neutralize it. Primarily for the safety and preservation of our data. SCP-3040-1 must be kept under careful observation.
