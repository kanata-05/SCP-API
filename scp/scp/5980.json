SCP-5980 does not require sustenance. SCP-5980 is allowed outside of its containment cell once per day for two hours for recreational activities, but is strictly prohibited from entering the cafeteria.\n\n\nFood offered by SCP-5980 should be declined by personnel in order to maintain their mental health.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5980 is the designation given to Ethan Chin, age 33.\n\n\nSCP-5980 is capable of perfect cellular regeneration and is, by definition, biologically immortal. Given the regenerative properties of SCP-5980's cells, research into utilizing SCP-5980 for medicinal treatment is currently underway.\n\n\nExtensive testing of samples taken from SCP-5980's body has revealed that its skin, as well as its organs, nerves, and fingernails, possess a flavour that is universally enjoyed by those that consume it. The flavor of SCP-5980 will vary depending on the consumer. SCP-5980 exhibits a pleasant aroma regardless of the seasoning it's cooked with.\n\n\nSCP-5980 is amicable and will often encourage Foundation personnel to \"have a bite\" of it when they pass by. It is important to note that SCP-5980 does not exhibit any cognitohazardous properties.\n\n\nConsumption of SCP-5980, while safe, is often detrimental to a subject's mental health.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\n\nSCP-5980 was discovered after several complaints were made in an establishment called Cannibal Chin's in northern New Jersey. A food critic claimed to have witnessed SCP-5980 remove its fingers with a kitchen knife before deep-frying them. These were later served as french fries. Several other civilians claimed to have caught glimpses of SCP-5980 self-mutilating in the kitchen moments before serving them food, and a Foundation investigation was instigated.\n\n\nWhen questioned, SCP-5980 claimed to have no idea what it was doing wrong, and insisted that Foundation operatives have a complementary order off of the menu. Its requests were denied by all attending agents except for Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was unaware of SCP-5980's anomalous properties, consumed the entirety of an order of fries, sized large, dipping each fry in a dark green milkshake. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was psychologically evaluated and later requested an amnestic, and for his name to be expunged from the official record.\n\n\nSCP-5980 willingly came into Foundation custody once apprehended.\n\n\n\n\nCannibal Chin's was shut down using \nCover Story 14 (\"Health and Safety Violation\")\n after four years of continuous operation.\n\n\n\n\nInterview 5980.4:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Owen Andrews\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-5980\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Tell me again what you were doing at the restaurant.\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Growing food gets expensive, like, the costs was wayyy too steep man. I wish it 'didn't have to be that way, but when life gives ya lemons.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Right, of course.\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Didja try the Finger Fries?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I'm afraid not.\n\n\nSCP-5980 holds out a finger.\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Tastes jus like chicken, I swear. Mmm mmm mmm! Have a bite, it doesn't hurt.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Umm\u2026 Noo\u2026 Thanks? I had something to eat already.\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Suit yourself, man. You're missing out.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n How exactly did you make the items on the menu?\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Oh, that's easy. I crank up the heat real high if the water's running low, and I keep all my \nspare meat n' shit\n in the cooler. God, I think I'd die if I made every order at once.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n And what did people say to you when they found out that \nyou\n were the source of their meals?\n\n\nSCP-5980:\n Eh, forget about it. I didn't do nothing wrong. They're just a bunch of unappreciative bastards is all.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n That'll be all for now.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5980.3:\n\n\nThe following is a list of items found on the menu of Cannibal Chin's.\n\n\n\n\nMeatburger | Sm - 4.65 | Md 5.96 | Lg 7.82\n\n\nFinger Fries | Sm - 1.99 | Md - 2.99 | Lg 3.99\n\n\nLemonade | 3.99\n\n\nChin's special chocolate | 5.00\n\n\nWater | Free\n\n\nInside-Out Milkshake | Sm 3.99 | Md 4.99 | Lg 5.99\n\n- Available in Chocolate, Mint, Vanilla and Strawberry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5979\n | SCP-5980 | \nSCP-5981\n \u00bb",
