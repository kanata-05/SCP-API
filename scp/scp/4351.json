The adjacent lot has been purchased by a Foundation shell company, serving as a surveillance and security post. Four security officers must remain on site, posing as civilians. Guards are to have a registry of all -A instances.\n\n\nThe assigned agent will have the primary job of turning away any individual who attempts entry into SCP-4351. The guards are to assist only under the following conditions; the assigned agent is unable to turn away the individual safely, the door is answered by a -A instance other than the assigned agent or the door remains unanswered. If an individual attempts to gain access to SCP-4351 and their face and name are in the registry of -A instances, they alone are to be permitted entry. Attempted exit from SCP-4351 by any of the -A instances is to be discouraged.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4351 is a two-story house located on a residential street in Verdun, Quebec, Canada. The house currently has 8 occupants who will be referred to as SCP-4351-A. The anomalous effect of SCP-4351 manifests once an individual achieves entry into the primary structure.\n\n\nEntry into SCP-4351 causes an individual to become a -A instance. SCP-4351-A instances will find themselves unable to leave the property for extended periods of time due to heightened emotional distress. However, -A instances are capable of exiting through the patio door into the patio without triggering the anomalous effect. Attempting to exit the patio in any way, excluding entrance back into the structure, triggers the anomalous effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS ETHICS COMMITTEE CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT ETHICS COMMITTEE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nParts of SCP-4351's anomalous property have not been explained in the previous sections because of Ethics Committee concerns.\n\n\nThe following are logs and interviews of Agent Stephens that provide some understanding of the full nature of SCP-4351.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a04351-1.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nShowing interview 4351-1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Agent Stephens\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Niole\n\n\nForeword:\n After his return from SCP-4351 Agent Stephens was debriefed on the events that occurred in the location.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Agent Stephens, report what you found within the location?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n I entered the house and encountered six individuals.

I was able to walk right out and, having proved him wrong, I headed back here. I don't think there's anything actually anomalous going on here, just some probably mentally ill people squatti-\n\n\n\n\nAgent Stephens suddenly seems confused\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Agent? Is something wrong?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n What just happened? Where am I? How'd you get in here? Where's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? \nDr. Niole's first name\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I'm right here, Agent. Can you tell me what you're experiencing?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Shut up! Wait\u2026 Dr. Niole? Is that you? I can see you, but it's difficult. It looks like I'm back at the house. I'm at Site-\u2588\u2588, right?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Yes, Agent. You're at Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n What?! What are you saying?! You're both speaking at once I can't understand you!\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I'm the only one here. Agent, can you describe what's happening to you?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n It's too much. I have too many hands, too many eyes, too many ears!\n\n\nAgent Stephens became unresponsive to questioning at this time merely gibbering, trying to cover his ears and closing his eyes tightly\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Agent Stephens was escorted to site-\u2588\u2588 medical Ward for examination by Site-\u2588\u2588 medical staff. Further investigation into SCP-4351 is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a04351-2.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nShowing Interview Log 4351-2\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Agent Stephens\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Niole\n\n\nForeword:\n After the events of Interview Log 4351-1 agents were dispatched to SCP-4351 where they discovered Agent Stephens inside SCP-4351. With the assistance of SCP-4351-A-1 Agent Stephens was removed from SCP-4351 resulting in the creation of a third instance as Agent Stephens remained inside SCP-4351. Further attempts to extract Agent Stephens from SCP-4351 were denied and Agent Stephens was brought back to Site-\u2588\u2588. After testing it was determined that placing Agent Stephens in sensory deprivation considerably lessened the mental strain on Agent Stephens. The following interview was conducted under these conditions.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n How are you feeling?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Much better. I can still see too much at once, but as long as I try not to focus too much it's not too overwhelming. The\u2026 me\u2026 at the house is lounging on the patio. There doesn't seem to be a problem with going out there and it's relatively quiet.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Can you tell us what you're experiencing?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n At the moment I can see and hear you, see and hear the patio and the sounds of the neighbourhood and also see and hear absolutely nothing. It's still disorienting and weird, but it's manageable. For now at least.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Can you tell me anything else?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n All of my senses are working in all three versions of me. I can feel, see, hear, smell and taste everything the various versions of me can. It's overwhelming. It's like\u2026 experiencing the sensations of three different people at once.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Can you try to be clearer?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Right now I'm seeing three different things, but not at different times or even switching through them. They're all the same sight. If you were to somehow take three photos and make them one really confusing jumbled photo you'd get an idea of what this is like and it's like that for all my senses.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n That must be very disorienting.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n I can only imagine what it would be like if there were even more of me. If I just kept on trying to leave how many of me could there be? There's a part of me that's morbidly curious, but I can't imagine how awful that would be. I'd probably lose my mind.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n When we're done this interview we'll put this instance of you into sensory deprivation as well. That should make things a lot easier.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Yeah that should be a lot better. Then I can focus on just the one at the house.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n What can you tell me about SCP-4351. You experience anything interesting in there?\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n It's obvious many of the others here are experiencing similar or worse sensations. 4351-A-1 and 4351-A-5 seem to be fine though. I wonder why they're unaffected. Maybe they never tried to leave? I don't know when it happened, but there's a new person here. They seem to have arrived after me. So, I guess we need to update the number of occupants\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Indeed\u2026 There are eight SCP-4351-A instances in that case. You're technically an instance of 4351-A.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Oh, Right. I guess I didn't think of it like that. I'm never gonna be able to leave here am I?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n We're going to try our best to find a way to get you and the others out. Don't worry.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Thanks, Dr. Niole.\n\n\nAgent Stephens suddenly collapses forward crying out in pain\n\n\nSenior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What's wrong?!\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n I'm in pain\u2026 I\u2026 I think I'm dying!\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Agent Stephens lost consciousness and the interview was terminated. Agent Stephens was determined to still be alive. A return to SCP-4351 revealed that The Instance of Agent Stephens inside SCP-4351 had been stabbed in the back of the throat with a standard kitchen knife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a04351-3.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 4351-3\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Agent Stephens\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Niole\n\n\nForeword:\n After an appropriate amount of time spent debating it was decided to return the two instances of Agent Stephens in Foundation Custody to SCP-4351. Once all instances of Agent Stephens were moved through the entrance of SCP-4351, Agent Stephens made a remarkable recovery. A final interview was carried out with the now singular Agent Stephens.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n You seem to be doing well.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n I am. I'm not dying anymore and I'm only experiencing things once. It's great. It's amazing the things you take for granted in this world.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Definitely sounds preferable to the previous situation.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n I haven't forgotten what this means. I'm stuck here forever.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Until we can find a way to get you and the others out.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n It's not the worst place to be stuck. Most of the people here seem pretty nice. Also apparently the fridge restocks itself so we won't starve.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Indeed. That doesn't sound too bad.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n They're putting you in charge here right?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I cannot divulge that, Agent.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n If you do end up in charge then there's something you need to do. Don't let anyone try to escape. Most importantly, there are still other\u2026 \"instances\" out there. You need to find them, and bring them back here.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I'll do what I can.\n\n\nAgent Stephens:\n Well that's all then.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Agent Stephens has remained inside SCP-4351 since his return. The Foundation has managed to recover some SCP-4351-A instances and attempts are continuing to locate and recover the remaining SCP-4351-A instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO RESEARCHERS GIVEN SPECIAL CLEARANCE TO STUDY SCP-4351\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT PROPER CLEARANCE WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a04351-4.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 4351-4\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4351-A-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Niole\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-4351-A-1 suddenly showed up one day at Site-\u2588\u2588 he claimed he had left SCP-4351 for the first time for as long as he could remember, because he had important information.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n How are you here?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n How did you find Site-\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I pressured Agent Stephens into telling me where this place was located. Since as far as he knows we're all stuck inside forever, it didn't take a lot of coaxing.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n That is still quite a breach and we'll have to find some way to take disciplinary action against him.\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n Good luck with that.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n If you left the house shouldn't you be suffering from SCP-4351's anomalous properties?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I am.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n You don't seem to be suffering?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I made sure the version of myself at the house was somewhere he'd be relatively left alone, so I could focus mostly on this version of me.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n You had important information for us?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n Over the years I've had many guests. This is the first time I've heard about The SCP Foundation. The first time I've learned I'm not alone. I thought what you called SCP-4351 was one of a kind and no one would ever understand, but you, your foundation are used to dealing with strange things like this. You might be able to help.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n We do try our best.\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I built SCP-4351 as a log cabin back in the year 1611.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I'm sorry?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n Take your time.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n You look like you're at most 30 and you're saying you're about 400 years old?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n That sounds about right. I haven't really been keeping track. I haven't left the house since I first built it. I've never been a fan of the outside and it was supposed to be my home where I'd never have to leave. I was fairly wealthy so had no requirement to leave my home when I could simply pay others to do things for me.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n People brought you food and other goods?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n Indeed. I don't know when the effect actually started. I only found out about it the first time it happened to someone who had visited my home. A neighbour brought me food she had baked and when she left she was still in my house.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I assume she's still in SCP-4351 then?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n She's still not whole and I believe you refer to her as SCP-4351-A-2. Who knows where the other instance of her is now. After that I became much more careful and tried to prevent anyone else from entering.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n So, you didn't create the anomaly?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I don't know. It worked out well for me though. Food in the house started to restock itself. All my needs were taken care of. The only problem was no way to get rid of Marie-\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1 stops and smiles wanly\n\n\nI mean SCP-4351-A-2.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n You mentioned that it was a log cabin originally. Obviously it's current appearance is much more similar to modern homes. What happened?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n It seems to change itself to match the houses around it. As the type of houses built changed so did it. There were suddenly more rooms, more amenities, but sometimes as it shifted it would lose rooms too. Houses would get smaller and so it would shrink, remove some of it's rooms. At one point there were 9 people in the house, but at one point the house also had a basement\u2026\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1 becomes quiet until prompted by Senior Researcher Niole\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n Thank you for this information. It will undoubtedly be helpful and give us a lot to think about.\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n I had a dream once. In the center of the house there was this strange object\u2026 As it sat in the middle of the house the house expanded. It just kept growing, adding more and more rooms until the entire world was contained within. Everyone safe from the outside. The people all immortal and all provided with the resources we need.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n SCP-4351-A-1?\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n Sorry! I got distracted. It's easy when you're of two minds.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Niole:\n I was just thanking you for the information you provided.\n\n\nSCP-4351-A-1:\n There is one last thing. Those who have stayed within the house for some time start to adapt. They lose the desire to leave. Preferring the ease of existence inside. I don't know if that's important or not, but thought you should know.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-4351-A-1 was escorted back to SCP-4351 willingly. The information supplied is interesting and leads to the suggestion that perhaps much more research into SCP-4351 is required. We cannot rule out the idea the house is intelligent and might even have some sort of goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4350\n | SCP-4351 | \nSCP-4352\n \u00bb",

SCP-4351-A-1: She's still not whole and I believe you refer to her as SCP-4351-A-2. Who knows where the other instance of her is now. After that I became much more careful and tried to prevent anyone else from entering. Senior Researcher Niole: So, you didn't create the anomaly? SCP-4351-A-1: I don't know. It worked out well for me though. Food in the house started to restock itself. All my needs were taken care of. The only problem was no way to get rid of Marie- SCP-4351-A-1 stops and smiles wanly I mean SCP-4351-A-2. Senior Researcher Niole: You mentioned that it was a log cabin originally. Obviously it's current appearance is much more similar to modern homes. What happened? SCP-4351-A-1: It seems to change itself to match the houses around it. As the type of houses built changed so did it. There were suddenly more rooms, more amenities, but sometimes as it shifted it would lose rooms too. Houses would get smaller and so it would shrink, remove some of it's rooms. At one point there were 9 people in the house, but at one point the house also had a basement\u2026 SCP-4351-A-1 becomes quiet until prompted by Senior Researcher Niole Senior Researcher Niole: Thank you for this information. It will undoubtedly be helpful and give us a lot to think about. SCP-4351-A-1: I had a dream once. In the center of the house there was this strange object\u2026 As it sat in the middle of the house the house expanded. It just kept growing, adding more and more rooms until the entire world was contained within. Everyone safe from the outside. The people all immortal and all provided with the resources we need. Senior Researcher Niole: SCP-4351-A-1? SCP-4351-A-1: Sorry! I got distracted. It's easy when you're of two minds. Senior Researcher Niole: I was just thanking you for the information you provided. SCP-4351-A-1: There is one last thing. Those who have stayed within the house for some time start to adapt. They lose the desire to leave. Preferring the ease of existence inside. I don't know if that's important or not, but thought you should know. <End Log> Closing Statement: SCP-4351-A-1 was escorted back to SCP-4351 willingly. The information supplied is interesting and leads to the suggestion that perhaps much more research into SCP-4351 is required. We cannot rule out the idea the house is intelligent and might even have some sort of goal."
