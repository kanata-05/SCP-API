EE-6460 itself has concluded and no similar event, so far as the Foundation is currently aware, has since resurfaced in Nexus Forty-Four.\n\n\nAs to improve relations with the Laputan state, the Foundation has pledged humanitarian aid to help recover losses caused by EE-6460. This initiative, headed by agent Lemieux, is ongoing. Department of External Affairs personnel are to consult Document 6460-Luther with appropriate clearance for further information.\n\n\nDescription:\n EE-6460 was an anomalous planar disturbance that caused the disappearance of several objects and persons in Nexus Forty-Four (\"Flying Island of Laputa\") on December 19th, 1887. It would seem the effects of EE-6460 were limited to the Nexus itself, though the reason for this is unknown. The disappearances were instantaneous, occurring at exactly 4:16 PM, with their victims entirely demanifesting from baseline reality\n2\n. Casualties included:\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated thirty-nine (39) civilian casualties (all Laputan citizens; no Foundation operatives).\n\n\nTwo (2) notable members of Laputan nobility, now designated PoI-6460-A and PoI-6460-B\n3\n.\n\n\nSeveral articles of Laputan paramagnetic levitation technology.\n\n\nA small piece of SCP-68AG (\"The Grand Lodestone\")\n4\n. Its removal led to a brief period of unpredictable and disruptive, albeit relatively minor, gravitational destabilizations across Nexus Forty-Four.\n\n\nAn elaborate necklace comprised of the teeth of \neques malignus infernalis\n (Greenlandic nuckelavee), previously personally belonging to queen Balnibarigoiis VI.\n\n\nSeveral seemingly random buildings and pieces of public infrastructure, resulting in considerable damage to urban centers. Even with the aid of the Foundation, Nexus Forty-Four has yet to fully rebuild.\n\n\n\n\nIt is unknown whether the victims of EE-6460 were entirely erased from baseline reality or somehow transported to an accessory plane of existence. Further research is pending.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\u2014 \nYou are viewing an \narchived iteration\n of this file.\n \u2014\n\n\nYou are currently viewing an outdated iteration (01/01/20XX) of this document.

According to agents Lemieux and Roksolana, who were on a diplomatic mission in Laputa at the time of the event, items and persons subject to EE-6460 completely vanished, even if directly observed.\n\n\n3\n. According to Laputan citizens interviewed by agents, the given names of these individuals were Piranhaargabli Capribligut and Pixbligarbl Argabligutoadie respectively.\n\n\n4\n.
