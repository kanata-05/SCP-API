SCP-5239 is allowed to exit the chamber once a day for exercise in the courtyard, contingent on general compliance. SCP-5239-1 materials should be locked away separately from SCP-5239 and only returned during testing.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances should SCP-5239 be addressed as Abraxas, Dread-Master of Darkness, High Necromancer of Hell, The Seventh Servant of Satan or any similarly thematic names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5239.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-5239 is Blaine Veers, a 17 year old human from Trenton, New Jersey. SCP-5239 is a Type III-Limited\n1\n reality bender, but is only capable of performing anomalous feats when equipped with SCP-5239-1-A through D.\n\n\nSCP-5239-1-A is a hardcover book claiming to be the fictional \nNecronomicon\n from the works of author H.P. Lovecraft.\n2\n SCP-5239-1-A is filled with instructions in poorly-translated Latin claiming to be spells of various facets of necromancy, from divining with spirits to raising the deceased as zombies. When not being used by SCP-5239, the book is entirely non-anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-5239-1-B through E are a black robe, a pair of red eye contacts, a pair of black leather fingerless gloves, and a tube of black eyeliner. SCP-5239 claims the usage of these items during testing enhances its anomalous abilities. However, instances can be swapped out for similar products with little to no change in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nSCP-5239 came to the Department of Spectral Phenomena's attention on 08/11/2019, after numerous police reports of disturbances at a local graveyard. Witnesses reported seeing trespassers dressed as ghosts that vanished upon attempts to apprehend them.\n\n\nUndercover operatives set up hidden cameras throughout the site, noticing SCP-5239 among the spectral entities. Foundation operatives later tracked SCP-5239 to a local bookstore, taking them into Foundation custody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0Interview\u00a028/11/2019\u00a0\u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\u25cb\u00a0Interview\u00a028/11/2019\u00a0\u25cb\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Adrian Bliss\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5239\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nBliss:\n Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Adrian Bliss, I'll be interviewing you today. Do you prefer Mx Veers, or just Ashley?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Call me Abraxas, Necromancer of Hell.\n\n\nBliss:\n \u2026No.\n\n\nSCP-5239\n Uh. Then I guess you can, uh, call me- name's Blaine Veers. You can just call me Blaine. Don't really go by Ashley anymore. Um, sir.\n\n\nBliss:\n Appreciate it, but there's no need to call me sir. Now, I wanted to talk to you about your abilities. Approximately when did you first realize you could reanimate corpses?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n I guess about a few weeks ago? Day or two after my birthday. Didn't feel like sticking around home, so I headed downtown to the library. Wasn't really anything I liked that I hadn't read-\n\n\nBliss:\n \n[taking notes]\n Sorry, what was the name of the place?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n It was just the public library. One on Main and tenth?\n\n\nBliss:\n Oh. \n[Erasing notes]\n Continue, please.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Anyways, wasn't anything I liked. But there was this one thing- They had this weird donated books section, you could go through there for a dollar. Nothing good, but I found this one book, part of some Halloween costume I think. And I was already planning on dressing up for Halloween, thought it'd make a good prop. Went home, flipped through it, then next thing I knew I was talking to the ghost of some Viking dude.\n\n\nBliss:\n How did that go?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Heh, not really that great. He tried to slice me in half, until I found the spell to throw him back. Threw the book under my bed for a while, tried to forget about it. Didn't really want to give my parents an excuse to- never mind.\n\n\nI forgot about it for a while, then eventually pulled it out again. Started small, like roadkill or mice. Things that people wouldn't notice.\n\n\nBliss:\n And then the cemetery ruckus. What exactly were you doing there at 1AM, anyways?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Oh, that. I\u2026 I, um, just needed some fresh air. Thought I'd go to the cemetery to practice.\n\n\nBliss:\n I see. One more thing about your recovery. When our task force apprehended you, you were wearing\u2026 'one black robe, fingerless gloves, a pair of blood-red eye contacts, and one tube of black eyeliner.' A Halloween costume, I'm assuming. Were those included with the book?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Nah, I bought those from a costume shop. It's kinda weird. I tried putting them on, and it seemed to work? Could do some of the more complicated spells. Sounds like bullshit, I know, but it works. Same with the name. Once I started acting like a goddamn goth kid, I had more energy.\n\n\nBliss:\n Interesting. I'll make sure they hold onto those. One more thing: Why'd you continue with the book? I'm not an expert, but I feel like most teenagers would be-\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Scared? Uncomfortable? It's magic. May be necromancy, but it's still fucking magic. Who'd throw that away?\n\n\nBliss:\n Fair enough. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Log\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-5239, equipped with SCP-5239-1, enters the testing room.\n\n\nBliss:\n Good morning, Blaine. How are the new books?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Pretty good, I guess. Any chance I can get the fifth one in the series as well? Think it's come out by now.\n\n\nBliss:\n I'll see what I can do. But for now, we should get on with the testing.\n\n\nSCP-5239 steps forward, looking at the corpse of D-2343 on the table.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Uh\u2026 You didn't kill this guy just for the testing, did you?\n\n\nBliss:\n Of course not, that would be an utter waste. Bad case of appendicitis.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n \u2026\n\n\nBliss:\n Is something wrong, Blaine?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Sorry, I'm just not really used to seeing dead bodies. Like, I usually stuck with ghosts, and most of the skeletons had all their fleshy bits rotted away. A bit hard to look at.\n\n\nBliss:\n If you'd rather deal with a skeleton, we can swap that-\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n No, it's fine, it's fine. I can do this.\n\n\nSCP-5239 takes a deep breath, and then begins reciting a passage from SCP-5239-1-A.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Exurge a mortuis, ex carne homo. Exurge a mortuis, et ambules in sempiternum et egressus de loco spiritus mundi. Et tu iubes!\n3\n\n\nHume detectors record a 20% dip from baseline reality.\n\n\nD-2343's body jerks up.\n\n\nD-2343:\n Uh\u2026.\n\n\nBliss:\n D-2343, can you hear me?\n\n\nD-2343 moans intelligibly, falling off the table.\n\n\nD-2343:\n Brains\u2026\n\n\nBliss:\n D-2343, please respond in the affirmative if you can hear me.\n\n\nD-2343 begins walking around the chamber, arms raised in a stereotypical \"zombie\" pose.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Um, hold on, hold on\u2026. Da mihi absconditorum es cognitor, immortuorum augentes!\n4\n\n\nD-2343:\n Secreta immortuos non vestrum est scire. Cessabunt sive perpetuo versatus est.\n5\n\n\nBliss:\n Hmm. Have you ever held a conversation with any reanimated persons before, Blaine?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Well, kind of? I mean I can tell them what to do; grab that book, open that door, scare off that kid\u2026 I mean I didn't really think about talking to them that much, sorry I should've had this checked out, I'm really sorry-\n\n\nBliss:\n It's nothing. Can you recite the counterspell now?\n\n\nSCP-5239 recites the counterspell, and D-2343 falls to the ground. Hume levels return to baseline.\n\n\nBliss:\n Thank you, that will be all for today.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n ..Sorry. Did I mess something up?\n\n\nBliss:\n What? No, you seemed to have followed the instructions well. We can hardly fault a 17 year-old for not speaking Latin. Marshall, can you show them back to- thank you. See you tomorrow.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhile we've been searching for a solution to our little \nblackroom\n problem, it seems SCP-5239 is not that answer. Rather than bending reality to reanimate the consciousness of the deceased, SCP-5239 instead appears to instead manipulate the body into a crude display of life. Its creations are more fleshy/incorporeal automatons rather than true reanimations.\n\n\nConsidering the costs required to properly maintain our SRAs, and the exceedingly narrow circumstances in which SCP-5239 can even be recognized as anomalous, I'm proposing we amnesticize and release it back into the civilian world. No further value can be gained by its containment. -Doctor Bliss\n\n\nProposal granted. -O5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Interview\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Bliss\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5239\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nBliss:\n Well, looks like I've got some good news today.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n What, you're letting me paint my room black?\n\n\nBliss:\n No, not that. But I've put in a request to my superiors, and it looks like we'll be releasing you soon. There's still a few details left to tie up, but-\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n You're\u2026 you're letting me go?\n\n\nBliss:\n Yes, Blaine. You'll be back home by the end of the week. So it looks like this will be our last interview. If there's anything you want to ask about the process, now's the time.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Can I stay here?\n\n\nBliss:\n \u2026What? You want to stay here, at the Foundation?\n\n\nSCP-5239 nods.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n I mean, I know I messed up the last test, but I can do other things. Like I could make zombies or something for you guys to use. I can be useful. Can I stay?\n\n\nBliss:\n One moment.\n\n\n\n\n[FURTHER\u00a0STATEMENTS\u00a0REDACTED\u00a0AS\u00a0PER\u00a0HIPPOCRATES\u00a0PROTOCOL;\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0REQUIRES\u00a0 ETHICS\u00a0COMMITTEE\u00a0OR\u00a0OVERSEER\u00a0PERMISSION]\n\n\n\n\n[Override\u00a0Granted]\n\n\n\n\nBliss:\n Why on earth would you want to stay at the Foundation? What's this about?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n I, I just wanna stay here. I like it here.\n\n\nBliss:\n Really. And this doesn't have anything to do with your parents?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n You-you talked to them?\n\n\nBliss:\n They attempted to file a missing person's report a few days ago, so we sent some people to collect their statements. They seem to think you ran away from home.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n \u2026Please don't make me go back.\n\n\nBliss sighs.\n\n\nBliss:\n The Foundation isn't a place for kids, Blaine. Believe me, you shouldn't be here voluntarily. I get that there's been issue with your parents, but you need to think-\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n \nIssues?\n Bullshit. You know what they did when I told them I was non-binary? They just laughed and told me to stop making stuff up. Guess what they did when I asked them if I could change my name.\n\n\nBliss:\n I wouldn't presume to know.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n They told me to stop being so ungrateful, and then went through my closet and threw away every pair of pants or jeans I owned. Told me to act how I \"actually\" was, like a girl, or they'd send me to one of those pray away the gay-type of camps.\n\n\nBliss:\n I'm sorry. Truly, I am.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n When I found the book, it just felt freeing. Stupid, I know, but for a moment I wasn't some kid with a crappy life and crappy parents. I was just some badass necromancer with zombies and ghosts.\n\n\nBliss:\n You won't be able to take the book with you, I'm afraid. You reanimating bodies left and right presents an unacceptable risk to normalcy, it stays with us.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n You're still sending me back? I-\n\n\nBliss:\n Listen to me. This, the Foundation, is effectively indefinite suspension without parole. You'll be living in a cell for the rest of your life. Occasionally, if you're lucky, you might be able to take a few walks outside, guards accompanying you every step of the way. You don't get your own clothing, or get to go outside on your own, or have any communication with the outside world. Letting you stay here would not be a kindness, it would be cruelty.\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n But-\n\n\nBliss:\n Trust me. Next week, you'll be dropped off at a youth shelter in Philadelphia. There's some secrecy concerns with dropping you too close to home. From there, you can take a train to Trenton. However\u2026 what you choose to do at that point is entirely up to you. Once you're out of our hands, we have no authority whatsoever over your personal life. Understand?\n\n\nSCP-5239:\n Uh, yes, completely.
