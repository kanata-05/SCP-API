Experimentation with SCP-5318 is prohibited without express permission of \nLead Researcher Juan Martinez and\n Site Director Holman. Staff interested in experimenting with SCP-5318 must undergo ego-examinational evaluations as well as maintain a Level 4 Learinian\n2\n knowledge of the psycho-space. Dosage of SCP-5318 shall never exceed 200\u00a0\u00b5g.\n3\n Persons who have received a dosage of SCP-5318 higher than 200\u00a0\u00b5g are to be terminated immediately, if they have not already been rendered comatose or deceased.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nSCP-5318 refers to a 315\u00a0g\n4\n batch of lysergic acid diethylamide \u2014 specifically, ((+)-LSD));\n5\n hereafter referred to as \"LSD\". Post-delivery, a subject under the influence of SCP-5318 will experience typical auditory and visual hallucinations commonly associated with LSD.\n6\n These effects will continue for a duration of 8 to 12 hours, depending on individual and method of delivery. Between completion of the third and fourth half-lives,\n7\n a subject will enter a catatonic state in which they will remain unresponsive until after the completion of the fifth half-life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll subjects, upon entering this state, report that they find themselves viewing and experiencing a dream-like memory in which they seem to live for a variable amount of time as an agave farmer in the south of Mexico. This person is henceforth referred to as SCP-5318-1.\n\n\nSCP-5318 differs from standard LSD compounds through the addition of an as-of-yet undetermined polypeptide coupling reagent. Current theories and examination of the byproduct of the reagenting processes suggests the use of a polymer, isomeric in chirality to the compound \u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n8\n. Additionally, the anomalous effect of this reagent prolongs the degradation of the compound by several factors.\n9\n\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n\nSCP-5318 was first discovered in November, 1997, after twelve researchers were dosed by a fellow researcher at Site-64. No permanent mental or physical damage occurred, but resulted in all twelve staffers experiencing the anomalous effects now currently associated with SCP-5318. Due to the gross unprofessionalism, the researcher involved in the dosing has since been reprimanded, demoted, and detained as D-Class.\n10\n After interviewing the staffers involved, it was deemed necessary to trace the production and origin of SCP-5318.\n\n\nINTERVIEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Disciplinary Review\n\n\nDiscovery Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsst.

Just thought it\u2019d be fun to see the team let loose and\u2026 I don\u2019t know, just not think about what we do here for a bit. I got the shit off an old acquaintance, and it seemed harmless enough.\n\n\nMiles:\n Well, seeing how no one died, you got off light. Who did you get the compound from?\n\n\nGimbez:\n Old bar buddy of mine, deals in all the crazy shit, hangs out in Portland at z-Bar.

He estado estudiando y trabajando con los t\u00e9cnicos de laboratorio por un tiempo. Casi lo puedo ver. Esos a\u00f1os en una jaula, obligado a nadar por el universo de mi propia mente. Hay secretos all\u00ed, costas vastas y profundas. Puedo conocerlos, anclar en ellos. Si tan solo supiera c\u00f3mo navegar la mente. Navegar por la memoria. Con la mezcla adecuada \u2026 Las cosas que he visto. \u00a1Ay, pap\u00e1! \u00a1Estar\u00edas tan asombrado de la vida que he vivido! En otro mundo, otra realidad. He visto y vencido la muerte. Ya no le temo a la absoluci\u00f3n. Ahora, lo \u00fanico que lamento es no volver a verte, nunca volver a tomar tu mano, nunca sonre\u00edr a trav\u00e9s de los campos. Esas costas secretas tienen una soluci\u00f3n, tienen una respuesta. Si no puedo verte a trav\u00e9s de mis ojos, te ver\u00e9 a trav\u00e9s de los tuyos. Esto puedo hacer. Estoy tan cerca. Puedo alcanzarte, puedo ver el patr\u00f3n, me grita, se despliega, se enrolla y nada como una forma, en lo profundo del agua, envi\u00e1ndome recuerdos como ondas a trav\u00e9s del tiempo, a trav\u00e9s del espacio.

I can almost see it. Those years in a cage, forced to swim through the universe of my own mind. There are secrets there, vast and deep shores. I can know them, anchor on them. If only I knew how to navigate the mind. Surf through memory. With the right mix \u2026 The things I've seen. Oh dad! You would be so in awe of the life I have lived! In another world, another reality. I have seen and conquered death. I'm no longer afraid of absolution. Now, my only regret is never to see you again, never to hold your hand again, never to smile across the fields. Those secret shores have a solution, they have an answer. If I can't see you through my eyes, I'll see you through yours. This I can do. I'm so close, I can reach you, I can see the pattern, it screams at me, unfolds, coils and swims like a shape, deep in the water, sending me memories like ripples through time, through space. This pattern, this shape, this compound, I know \u2026 it's you. I'm sorry dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS SCP-5318\n\n\n\n\nForward:\n\n\nAll proceeding SCP-5318 experiments are conducted in standard therapeutic sessions under the supervision of Lead Reseacher Juan Martinez. Subject is to be given 100\u00a0\u00b5g of SCP-5318 and guided through the experience. 24 hours post session, the subject is then to be interviewed on their experience while in the disassociative state caused by SCP-5318 as SCP-5318-1.

How are you feeling?\n\n\nD-623321:\n Not great. I was groggy for a while and had trouble sleeping last night.\n\n\nEskew:\n Why is that?\n\n\nD-623321:\n Why do you think? You white coats dosed me. My mind was on overdrive all night.\n\n\nEskew:\n Sleeplessness is a side effect of LSD, unfortunately. Would you like to talk about your experience?\n\n\nD-623321:\n Which part?\n\n\nEskew:\n Well, we know that at some point you would have felt like you were living as someone else, most likely around 6 hours into your \u201ctrip\u201c. Could you elaborate on what you saw, what you heard?\n\n\nD-623321:\n Yeah, that was so strange. I woke up, in a field, there were these spiky green plants everywhere. My hands were covered in dirt. A little boy ran up to me as I was working. He called me \u201c\nSe\u00f1or Luna\n\u201d. He started saying things to me, but I couldn\u2019t understand. It sounded Spanish, but I never took more than like\u2026 one or two years of that in high school. But when the boy was talking, I could feel my heart start racing. I ran across the field, following him to a small house on the outskirts of the farm. I felt so scared for some reason.\n\n\nEskew:\n Was something chasing you?\n\n\nD-623321:\n No, it wasn\u2019t like\u2026 a fear of death, but the fear of losing something.\n\n\nEskew:\n So you would say, although you could not understand the language, you could still feel emotional responses to the stimuli around you?\n\n\nD-623321:\n If you want to use big words like that, yeah\u2026 When I arrived at the house I went through the front door, and up to the bedroom, where there was a woman on the bed and another woman next to her holding her hand. She was in the middle of having a kid.\n\n\nEskew:\n How did this make you feel?\n\n\nD-623321:\n I was scared, in love, confused, but felt strong too. The woman said something to me, but I can\u2019t remember. I stayed there for a few hours and eventually she had a baby boy. But she didn\u2019t wake up. I felt so sad, even angry, but as I felt a sharp pain in my chest, I held the baby.\n\n\nEskew:\n And what happened?\n\n\nD-623321:\n All the fear and anger melted away and I felt a kind of love I have never experienced. I haven\u2019t had any kids, but I know now the kind of love that comes from being a parent. An Angel let slip one name out of my mouth, \u201c\nGabriel\n\u201c.\n\n\nEskew:\n And then?\n\n\nD-623321:\n I came back. I woke up. What do I do with this, doctor?\n\n\nDr. Juan Martinez:\n Thank you for your time, D-Class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-687120\n\n\nProfile:\n Male; Age: 43; Origin: Nevada, US\n\n\nDr. Morgan Eskew:\n Good day D-Class, how are you feeling?\n\n\nD-687120:\n Jesus! What more you \nlocos\n want?!\n\n\nEskew:\n Just trying to figure out how you are feeling, D-Class.\n\n\nD-687120:\n I\u2019m as good as anyone who just got through a \npinche\n acid trip!\n\n\nEskew:\n I can understand your frustration, though could you please share with us your experience, especially from around the 5\u20136 hour mark? Did you have an out of body experience?\n\n\nD-687120:\n I felt like I was gone for years!\n\n\nEskew:\n What did you experience in your time out of body?\n\n\nD-687120:\n I was some \nranchero\n in what looked like Oaxaca. I remember visiting some place like that when I was little. I had a little \nmijo\n. A son. I got to watch him grow up. I tried my best. As he got older, I felt that he started to resent me for not saving his mother, like I could have done anything about it. It was hard, but I wanted him to take over the agave farm when I was gone. It had been in my family for generations. But he wanted to do other things.\n\n\nEskew:\n You are speaking in first person like this experience was \nyours\n. Can you elaborate on why?\n\n\nD-687120:\n Doctor, like I said, I felt like I lived whole years in this\u2026 what do I even call it\u2026 a dream? I can hardly tell what\u2019s real anymore. I miss my son\u2026 his son\u2026 whoever\u2019s son! My Gabriel\u2026\n\n\nD-687120 collapses on to the floor, sobbing and hyperventilating, punctuated by cries of \u201c\nMijo\n\u201d and \u201cGabriel\u201d.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Martinez, this interview is over. It is cruel at this point. Please administer the amnestic.\n\n\nDr. Juan Martinez:\n Dr. Eskew, please conclude the interview. D-Class, Thank you for your time.\n\n\nD-687120:\n You\u2019re gonna make me forget? No! Not my son! Please no, Gabriel\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-569003\n\n\nProfile:\n Male; Age: 22; Origin: California, US\n\n\nDr. Morgan Eskew:\n Good day D-Class, how are you feeling?\n\n\nD-569003:\n Nice to see you, Tracy. Little angry today, kinda confused\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n Nice to see you too, JD.\n\n\nLam:\n Dr. Eskew, please use correct designation.\n\n\nEskew:\n I mean, why are you angry, D-Class?\n\n\nD-569003:\n I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\nEskew:\n Do you think it might have to do with your experience yesterday?\n\n\nD-569003:\n Maybe, probably\u2026 or maybe it could be because I don\u2019t belong here.\n\n\nEskew:\n Well, let\u2019s just stick with the experience. Could you tell me about it?\n\n\nD-569003:\n Ugh, I guess\u2026. It just makes me feel so betrayed.\n\n\nEskew:\n What does?\n\n\nD-569003:\n That little shit. \nMerida! Mijo\n! I gave him everything.\n\n\nEskew:\n Who?\n\n\nD-569003:\n My\u2026 his\u2026 whoever that kid was\u2026 my son? Everything is such a blur.\n\n\nEskew:\n You had an out of body experience as another person \u2014 what happened there?\n\n\nD-569003:\n I got in a fight with my son.\n\n\nEskew:\n What happened?\n\n\nD-569003:\n It was time for him to start steering the farm. It was time for him to step up, he was 16 now, and had to be a man. He refused, said he hated me for it. Said he never wanted any of this life. Said he wish he had died in birth and not Olivia, his mother. Said he blamed me for everything. That there was no life here, only death. That he wanted to discover the world, see it. I said I agree with him, that Olivia should have been here, not him. We both said horrible things. Things you can\u2019t take back.\n\n\nD-569003 begins to cry.\n\n\nD-569003:\n \nLo siento, lo siento\n.\n\n\nDr. Juan Martinez:\n D-Class, that\u2019s okay, could you please tell us what happened after?\n\n\nD-569003:\n I woke up the next day, still in at the farm, but Gabriel was gone. Will I ever see him\u2026 what am I even saying? Is he real? Is this real? \nDios Mio\n!\n\n\nD-569003 flies into a fit of hysteria and is sedated.\n\n\nJennifer Lam:\n Martinez, I\u2019ll give you one more, after this we are done. I think we\u2019ve seen enough of what this thing can do.\n\n\nMartinez:\n D-Class, thank you for your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-089644\n\n\nProfile:\n Female; Age: 30; Origin: Nevada, US\n\n\nDr. Morgan Eskew:\n Good day D-Class, how are you feeling?\n\n\nD-089644:\n Not good, to be honest.\n\n\nEskew:\n Why is that?\n\n\nD-089644\n I'm so depressed. I almost just want to die.\n\n\nEskew:\n Whats wrong? Why do you feel that way?\n\n\nD-089644\n I have nothing left\u2026 I miss him so much\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n Who?\n\n\nD-089644\n Gabriel.\n\n\nEskew:\n You are aware that Gabriel is not actually your son, right? That you just experienced time in the life of his father, Se\u00f1or Luna?\n\n\nD-089644\n I gathered that much, but I was there for so long\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n How long was that?\n\n\nD-089644\n I don\u2019t know. Maybe a few decades.\n\n\nEskew:\n What happened?\n\n\nA tear drops from D-089644\u2019s eye.\n\n\nD-089644\n Time\u2026 Time happened. I spent years, waking up, tending the fields, and looking to the sky for answers. Praying to God to bring my boy back to me. But time brought me nothing but hardship.\n\n\nEskew:\n You said years, maybe decades. Can you highlight what transpired or how you felt?\n\n\nD-089644\n It\u2019s so much, like trying to remember the memory of a dream I had a year ago. Really, what stays is the feeling and big events, not much else\u2026 Just a constant sadness\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n Would you care to elaborate? You are our last interview, so there is no pressure. We have enough info for our purposes.\n\n\nD-089644\n I would, actually. Besides being locked in here for however long, I only have this. I just\u2026 I just have to get it out. I feel this is more real and important than any legacy I leave behind as a prisoner of this place.\n\n\nD-089644\u2019s begins sobbing again.\n\n\nEskew:\n Go ahead, take your time.\n\n\nD-089644\n Well, I woke up everyday. I woke up in a bed too big for myself. Within its sheets, I could feel the absence of something meaningful, something important. Early on, as I would go through my day, the house I was in seemed to have a population in the negative, as if so much was missing. I felt constant drain and agony. It went like this for so long. I tried my best to honor my father, his before, and his before, to keep the land as us Three Lunas had. But\u2026\n\n\nD-089644 pauses and looks despondent.\n\n\nEskew:\n But what, D-Class?\n\n\nD-089644\n With no son to carry the farm into the next era, production slowed, a rot took the soil, and the only path was to start selling plots back to the bank. Slowly, the farm and field were bought up by a large company. As the land belonging to my fathers suffered, so did my heath. The encroaching cities, industry and soot, took its toll. My sight started to fade. Shape, forms, color and light soon faded into distant memory, until all that was left was darkness and the sounds of a hospital. The farm, my son, my health gone\u2026. I think I died shortly after. I had nothing left. If the universe ever offered anything besides cold indifference, I felt that the only thing I could ever ask of God was to hold my boy again. I just\u2026 Gabriel\u2026 \nlo siento! Lo siento Gabriel! Mi Gabrielito! Lo Siento\n.\n\n\nD-089644 cries for 46 seconds before becoming completely silent.\n\n\nDr. Juan Martinez:\n D-Class, thank you for your time.\n\n\nPost Interview Note:\n\nD-089644 presented symptoms of extreme depression post-SCP-5318 until amnesticization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Juan Martinez\n\n\nProfile:\n Male; Age: 52; Origin: California, US\n\n\nDr. Morgan Eskew:\n Dr. Martinez. I can\u2019t believe you did this to yourself. How are you feeling?\n\n\nDr. Juan Martinez:\n I\u2019m feeling content. I think I found what I was finally looking for. The Foundation may be satisfied with the experiment results, but given the last D-Class\u2019s recollection, I must have more. If EC won\u2019t let me experiment on more D-Class, I\u2019ll just do it on myself.\n\n\nEskew:\n Well you certainly have outclassed yourself. So, what did you see?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Nothing, it was all black, I could only hear and smell. Sounds of EKG machines, carts rolling on linoleum floors. I could hear doctors and nurses deliberating and debating. I could smell the smells of cleaning supplies accompanied by the rot of newly filled bed-pans and dried blood.\n\n\nEskew:\n How long did this go on for, sir?\n\n\nMartinez:\n It felt like a few months, maybe a year, I couldn\u2019t tell the passage of time very well without sight. It was all just a feeling\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n And what feelings did you have?\n\n\nMartinez:\n I felt remorse, pain and guilt. I felt that all my years without Gabriel were just wasted time. Nothing mattered without him. And that is where I stayed\u2026 waiting for\u2026 wanting the release\u2026 of death.\n\n\nEskew:\n And what happened when it came?\n\n\nMartinez:\n I'm not sure\u2026 I don\u2019t remember\u2026\n\n\nEskew:\n Why not?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Because, before death could take me, an Angel came. He spoke to me in a voice that I knew. It was full of worldliness, wisdom, and love.\n\n\nEskew:\n What did it say?\n\n\nMartinez:\n \nPap\u00e1, estoy aqu\u00ed. Estoy aqu\u00ed. Lo siento mucho. Perd\u00f3n por no estar all\u00ed cuando s\u00e9 que me necesitabas. Necesitaba ver el mundo, pero ahora s\u00e9 que el mundo no importa, solo nosotros. No temas la absoluci\u00f3n que viene. Este no es el fin. Hay un mundo despu\u00e9s de este. Lo he visto, tocado, vivido en \u00e9l, he vuelto con las palabras de nuestros padres. Los Tres Lunas, nuestros padres esperan para darnos la bienvenida a la otra vida. Que sepas que te amo, que estoy aqu\u00ed y que pronto me volver\u00e1s a ver. Como te he visto a trav\u00e9s de tus ojos, pronto me ver\u00e1s a trav\u00e9s de los m\u00edos. Estar en paz pap\u00e1, te amo, perd\u00f3name. Estoy aqu\u00ed\u2026\n\n\nReseacher Martinez begins to cry.\n\n\nEskew:\n What happened after?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Nothingness\u2026 for a long time, nothingness\u2026 then a light started to grow, bigger and bigger, before I could touch it\u2026 I came back. My father was there. His father, and all the fathers before me\u2026 Then Gabriel.\n\n\nPost Interview Note:\n\nIt seems that POI-5318 has returned to his place of origin. Given the perceived timeframe of the previous test statements, it could be assumed that this return has been recent. This has been crucial in the tracking of POI-5318. Lead Reseacher Juan Martinez has been reprimanded for his breaking of testing protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm here. I'm here. I\u2019m very sorry. Sorry for not being there when I know you needed me. I needed to see the world, but now I know that the world doesn't matter, only us. Do not fear the absolution that is coming. This is not the end. There is a world after this. I have seen it, touched it, lived in it, I have returned with the words of our parents. The Three Moons, our fathers, await to welcome us to the afterlife. Know that I love you, that I am here and that you will soon see me again. As I have seen you through your eyes, you will soon see me through mine. Be at peace dad, I love you, forgive me. I'm here\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM (August 7th, 1999)\n\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing experiments with SCP-5318, Dr. Juan Martinez has been classified as \u201cmissing in action\u201d. His last known location was tracked via personnel geolocator to a small seaside hotel in Cancun, Mexico. He was known to be on a Foundation-approved constitutional; however, he has since not returned to his position. The following is a transcript of different CCTV and independent footage from the area:\n\n\nHotel CCTV Surveillance:\n\n\n21:26:\n Dr. Juan Martinez sits at the hotel bar with a female in her late thirties.\n14\n They appear to be close.\n\n\n21:27:\n The bartender places drinks in front of Martinez and his companion. Martinez\u2019s drink contains a piece of paper underneath its base.\n\n\n21:27:\n Dr. Martinez picks up the paper and reads.\n\n\n21:28:\n Dr. Martinez stands up, shakes his guest\u2019s hand, and gives her an undetermined amount of currency. The female looks dissatisfied. Martinez walks out of camera view.\n\n\nCorner Traffic Light Cam:\n\n\n21:40:\n Martinez crosses the intersection of \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 & \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to the \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a small bar in downtown Cancun.\n\n\nPrivate Residential Security Camera:\n\n\n21:42:\n In the alley behind \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Martinez stops walking, two meters from a man in his mid to late 30s, dressed in all black. Martinez looks shocked.\n\n\n21:43:\n The man smiles and walks up to Martinez. Martinez begins crying.\n\n\n21:43:\n The man and Martinez embrace. Martinez holds the man\u2019s face in both hands.\n\n\n21:43:\n Martinez says something indiscernible.\n\n\n21:44:\n The man nods.\n\n\n21:44:\n Martinez and the man embrace.\n\n\n21:45:\n The embrace ends, the man whispers into Martinez\u2019s ear and he hands Martinez an envelope.\n\n\n21:45:\n Martinez looks shocked, but then smiles at the man. The two then part ways.\n\n\nHotel CCTV Surveillance:\n\n\n22:01:\n Martinez walks back in through the hotel bar. The aforementioned female is with another man.\n\n\n22:01:\n Martinez approaches the front desk and hands the now opened envelope to the hotel staff.\n\n\n22:02:\n The front desk agent nods and puts the parcel into a trash bin.\n\n\n22:03:\n Dr. Juan Martinez checks out.\n\n\n22:05:\n Juan Martinez leaves the hotel, and is able to be tracked via various city cameras until disappearing at 22:38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM (August 12th, 1999)\n\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Dr. Martinez failed to show back at Site-64 following his vacation, his pervious whereabouts were tracked. Foundation personnel were ultimately able to find the discarded envelope in the hotel dumpster. On its outside was written \u201cVerdad\u201d.\n15\n Its contents contained an official Death Certificate from El Estado Libre y Soberano de Oaxaca:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol Original\n\n\nEnglish Translation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNombre:\n Angel Luna.\n\n\nFecha de Fallecimiento:\n 16 de Septiembre de 1982\n\n\nEdad:\n 59\n\n\nCausa de Muerte:\n Ataque al Coraz\u00f3n\n\n\nFamiliares M\u00e1s Cercanos:\n Gabriel Luna \nContacto:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Angel Luna.\n\n\nDate of Death:\n September, 16th, 1982\n\n\nAge:\n 59\n\n\nCause of Death:\n Heart Attack\n\n\nNext of Kin:\n Gabriel Luna \nContact:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM (June 6th, 2018)\n\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the lack of any discernible progress in finding and detaining POI-5318 for almost two decades, joint research project \u201cHelping Hand\u201d has been reinstated.
