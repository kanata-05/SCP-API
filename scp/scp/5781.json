PoI-94707 should be monitored for any further suspicious activity.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5781 refers to an event that began on November 26th 1999, wherein multiple buildings spontaneously appeared on the coasts of Florida, United States over a 3 day period. Branding indicates that these buildings belong to \nAlan Investigations\n, a private detective firm which lacks any record of existence prior to the date SCP-5781 began.\n\n\nFollowing these appearances, \nAlan Investigations\n began receiving exorbitant monetary investments from residents in the area, as well as multiple corporate entities globally. Interviews with these investors show that these investments were voluntary, as all were motivated by predictions of the company's future success, as well as \"the founder's charisma\".\n\n\nAlan Ghayter, founder of \nAlan Investigations\n and hereafter referred to as PoI-94707, has denied any suspicion of money-laundering to authorities in the area, and is currently battling various legal disputes.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0with\u00a0PoI-94707\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoI-94707\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 5781-A\n\n\nDate Conducted:\n 03/01/2000\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Trevelyan Veil\n\n\nInterviewee:\n PoI-94707 (\"Alan Ghayter\")\n\n\nForeword:\n Throughout the interview, PoI-94707 spoke with an intense lisp, as well as an accent atypical of a Floridian, in spite of his claims of being raised in the state.
