The apartment building which contains SCP-5480 is to be monitored and the rooms adjacent to it are to be purchased by Foundation agents to minimise the risk of civilians being exposed to the anomaly.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5480 is an apartment in Portsmouth, England, which contains a number of anomalous artifacts. Such items include a series of potted plants made of human bone, a watering can filled with living ox marrow and a fridge which fills up with stomach acid when it is closed.\n\n\nA great number of documents - bills, paychecks, unsent job applications and receipts - have been packed into the bin. The oldest of these records dates back to 1879. They follow a strict chronology, as well. From 1879 to 1942, they are addressed to a \u201cSaarin Llovi\u201d, then \u201cSaally Orock\u201d until 1979, \u201cSandy Nadocks\u201d up to 2017 and from that point forward, \u201cSaara Klaviger\u201d.\n\n\nThere is a photorealistic painting on the bedside table depicting a young woman and an older man, likely in his thirties, standing in front of a field of red grass. A faded inscription on the bottom of the frame reads \u201c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ce \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u201d, translatable from Greek as \u201c\nMe and Ion\n\u201d (sic). Dating of the pigments has revealed it to be around 3,100 years old.\n\n\nSCP-5480 is inhabited by PoI-595, the aforementioned Saara Klaviger. PoI-595 is, according to her passport, a 28 year old female currently employed as a retail assistant of the Aldi brand grocery chain.\n\n\nAddendum 5480.1 - Discovery\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0fileserv:/S:/5480/fileserv/discovery\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\nOn the 15th of May, 2020, two members of GoI-663, \u201cThe Fraternity of Skin\u201d, to whom Foundation agents had attached hidden observation devices to weeks prior, had the following conversation outside of what was later found out to be SCP-5480.\n\n\n\n\nInterlocutors:\n Saara Klaviger (PoI-595), Male 1, Male 2\n\n\n\n\n(\nBegin transcript\n)\n\n\n[Male 1 knocks on Klaviger\u2019s door. Half a minute later, she opens it.]\n\n\nMale 1:\n Good morning, ma\u2019am! It\u2019s so good to see you, it\u2019s hard to find fellow disciples of the flesh.\n\n\nMale 2:\n We represent the Fraternity of Skin, one of the last remaining groups in Europe who champion the original goals of the Grand Karcist.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n Uh huh, and what would those be?\n\n\nMale 1:\n In his words, \u2018the liberation of mankind from the fetters of machinery\u2019.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n He never said that. The actual quote goes: \u2018from the fetters of mortality\u2019.\n\n\nMale 2:\n How would you know?\n\n\nKlaviger:\n You know what, nevermind. What else is your cult about?\n\n\nMale 1:\n Not a cult! Not a cult. We\u2019re a society of revivalists, bringing Sarkicism back to its roots. We worship Yaldabaoth, our deliverer from iron.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n What are you talking about? Ion fought Yaldabaoth, they are- were legendary enemies. Classical N\u00e4lk\u00e4nism rejects the idea of worship of the gods entirely. And \"sarkic\" is a slur, the proper term is N\u00e4lk\u00e4n.\n\n\nMale 1:\n You\u2019re misinformed. Just take a look at our scripture, the Parables of Nadox. We pulled this from the library\u2019s shelves ourselves.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n \nPseudo-Nadox\n. And this isn\u2019t even a copy of the original, what is this? \u201cIon drew forth the seed of his loins and placed it into Lovataar\u2019s gaping\u2026\u201d ugh, this is just an erotica. These aren\u2019t even parables! And I never want to hear about any of Lovataar\u2019s body parts again, gaping or not.\n\n\nMale 2:\n Those are our holy texts!\n\n\nMale 1:\n (Whispering: Shush, we can still recover this). There\u2019s always time to debate the historicity of our practices later. However, I\u2019m sure that you will agree that the spirit of our group, nay, our family, is truly in the vein of the original brand of Sarkicism.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n Oh boy.\n\n\nMale 1:\n Take a look at this. [He produces a clay sculpture packed with cotton.]\n\n\nKlaviger:\n Serpent\u2019s tail, many eyes, is that\u2026 Saarn?\n\n\nMale 1:\n Yes. She is the object of our affections.\n\n\nKlaviger:\n A-affections?\n\n\nMale 2:\n That\u2019s right. You see, as with most Sarkites, we try to keep our bloodline pure. No breeding or marriage with outsiders, we only procreate with fellow members of our community. But we don\u2019t have any proselytes who can carry a child yet so in the meantime we\u2019ve been storing our seed in these clay receptacles.\n\n\nMale 1:\n (Whispering: No! Don\u2019t start with that!) It also serves a dual purpose. We follow in Ion\u2019s footsteps, for just as he laid with Saarn for twelve days and shattered the hills with his passion-\n\n\nKlaviger:\n [Chokes.] Fucking\u2026 no! That didn't happen! Ion was faithful to Lovataar, how did Saarn somehow get roped into a relationship with him? I did \nnot\n want to learn today that effigies of me- I mean Saarn were being violated by a bunch of crusty old men! How come every N\u00e4lk\u00e4n commune is some kind of \ndisgusting sex cult\n!?\n\n\nMale 1:\n It's in following with our founder's principles. Ion\u2019s appetites were legendary, it\u2019s said he fornicated with so many that his phallus spat blood by the time he was thirty!\n\n\nKlaviger:\n [Vomits profusely.]\n\n\n(\nEnd of transcript\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5479\n | SCP-5480 | \nSCP-5481\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5480\n\" by Tiamat Elsen, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
