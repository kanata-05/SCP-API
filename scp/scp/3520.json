Foundation equipment should consistently broadcast a stronger signal of static to overwhelm public radios on that frequency. All SCP-3520 broadcasts are to be recorded and transcribed. Irene Rosenfeld and the Mondel\u0113z International Board of Directors are to be under constant surveillance by Foundation assets within Borneo and Ghana for SCP-3520 influence. All influences within Borneo and Ghana logging companies are to be immediately liquidated, and the Foundation is to assure that logging operations within the region continue uninhibited despite the apparent habitat degradation associated.\n\n\nDespite apparent ease of containment, reclassification to Keter is under possible consideration.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3520 is an anomalous series of radio broadcasts originating from an unknown place, occurring once a year, on a random day, in December. SCP-3520 broadcasts are of variable length, and only occur within the boundaries of Centre County, Pennsylvania. Despite the moderate strength of the normally unoccupied 106.5 FM frequency, the audio broadcast by SCP-3520 is usually weak, with the exception of the semi-variable phrase repeated at the end of the broadcast. SCP-3520 is able to influence objects, persons, and environments outside its range [REDACTED] despite a dearth of obvious, measurable characteristics, it is assured that these influences are present. Most voices have not been identified, however there are exceptions.\n\n\nAddendum:\n All broadcasts made by SCP-3520 as of 12/31/14.\n\n\n\n\n12/3/10\n\n\n(\nStatic, distant murmuring\n)\n\n\n(\nFinger snaps\n)\n\n\n(\nNoise of a crowded hall. Footsteps. Indistinct teenage voices.\n)\n\n\nFirst female voice:\n Did you pick up that \nSCP-343\n? I heard they're new.\n\n\nSecond female voice:\n Oh no! Far too expensive. [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are other snacks to-\n\n\n(\nStatic\n)\n\n\n(\nJungle noise\n)\n\n\n(\nGunshot\n)\n\n\nSynthesized male voice:\n Fourteen orangutans.\n\n\n\n\nUse of classified information first alerted the Foundation to SCP-3520's existence. First classified as an Extranormal Event. No activity until one year later.\n\n\n\n\n12/3/11\n\n\n(\nSounds of the ocean - seagulls, waves, etc. Indistinct male voice speaks in the distance.\n)\n\n\nMale voice:\n Yes, but when? When is enough enough\u2026\n\n\n(\nFive second snippet from the 1971 film \"A Clockwork Orange\"\n)\n\n\n(\nFive second snippet from 'Fat', a song by American singer \"Weird Al\" Yankovic\n)\n\n\n(\nPrimate noises\n)\n\n\nMale voice:\n Inoculation complete, you are no longer afraid of your own body.\n\n\n(\nSnippet of voice reading \"The Evils of Tobacco\" by Anton Chekhov. Voice is identified as deceased comedian John Candy.\n)\n\n\nJohn Candy:\n Um, as the subject of my lecture today I've chosen, I think I may put it that way, the harmful effects which can be observed in human beings as a direct result of indulgence in [static noise]. I myself \neat\n1\n but my wife told me I should speak about the dangers of [static noise], so there's nothing more to say, is there? Dangers\u2026 why not? What do I care? You, on the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, will, I hope, devote your serious attention to what I'm about to say. Otherwise, well, I don't really think we'll get anywhere.\n\n\n(\nRetching, vomiting noises.\n)\n\n\nSynthesized male voice:\n Fat's where it's at!\n\n\n(\nGunshot\n)\n\n\nSynthesized male voice:\n Thirteen orangutans.\n\n\n\n\nBroadcasts reclassified as SCP-3520. Dr. Ryan Atkins alerts his superiors about possible influence on the grave of Mr. Candy. Grave liquidated as per new protocols developed by Dr. Atkins.\n\n\n\n\n12/16/12\n\n\n(\nThe entirety of this broadcast is read by the female voice from broadcast one. She is apparently reading a transcript of a fictitious D-Class expedition. Words censored by bleeps are represented by blackboxes here.\n)\n\n\nFirst female voice:\n Begin Log, 18:02:40 \u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588. D-5439 checks his watch. \"It's currently two minutes after six, and I hear nothing. This is bullshit!\" D-5439 glances up, alert. He looks around, apparently hearing SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is not audible on the tape. \"Okay, okay yeah I hear it! It's\u2026uh\u2026.very faint, but it's coming up from this street here.\" He turns and looks up Borneo Street, which runs to the northwest from D-5439. \"So then I guess I just follow it until it gets louder.\" D-5439 is now walking down Ghana Road, to the east of Borneo Street. He has already begun to shiver. Audio records indicate his teeth are chattering. \"It's so cold. Brrr. I had an ice-cream headache before this, straight outta left field. So bizarre. It's getting louder now. Not very much, but I think I'm getting closer. And, wait, I feel so full. It just came one quite suddenly. Agh!\" (Video footage indicates D-5439 has jumped back in surprise) \"I'm getting fatter! By the second! I can see it, I can see my belly slowly expanding outwards! What the fuck is this thing you sent me after?!\"\n\n\n(\nStatic\n)\n\n\nFirst female voice:\n D-5439 attempts to turn around and leave. His electric collar is activated and he quickly resumes tracking SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. D-5439 has reached the intersection of Ghana Road and GMO Street. Video footage shows that he has gained approximately ten kilograms and is beginning to stumble somewhat in his walk. Audio shows that he is out of breath and disoriented. \"So\u2026full\u2026so\u2026.cold\u2026I can hear it. Its\u2026um\u2026.(He spins around trying to locate the shifting sound.) \"It's so loud. I'm\u2026close to it. Why is it so\u2026cold!?\"\n\n\n(\nStatic, handclaps, burst of screaming\n)\n\n\nFirst female voice:\n Video footage shows that D-5439 has entered a national park within Ivory Coast. Vast swaths of land have been replaced with cocoa farms. The ground is covered with the corpses of both chimpanzees and orangutans. \"Now that's just fucked up. Seriously. That's fucking cold, ladies and germs.\" D-5439 turns to the camera and gives a magnificent bow. His top hat is sparkled and gold. His obese stomach is bursting out of his tuxedo. He is knee deep in ape corpses.\n\n\n(\nThe song 'One' from the musical \"A Chorus Line\" begins to play underneath the rest of the broadcast.\n)\n\n\nFirst female voice:\n \"Alright, this is D-5349 signing off right here. Thanks for tuning into this marvelous, spectacular totally tubular Foundation D-Class expedition. As you can see, thanks to these dead primates, I'm now fat and happy! The SCP Foundation is sponsored by Mondel\u0113z International, makers of such fine products and brands as Belvita, Chips Ahoy!, Nabisco, \nOreo\n, Ritz, Trident, Triscuit, and Kraft Cheese! Remember to shove these fine, healthy foods into your face at least eighty times a day for maximum effect! Keep an eye out for influence, ladies and germs. Don't let those special little thoughts take away the fun time that is the Mondel\u0113z Grinder! Let yourself get out the groove and flee to the edges of the stars! Snack up on 101! Candy! Blood! A country in the tropics!\"\n\n\n(\nGunshot\n)\n\n\nSynthesized male voice:\n Twelve orangutans.\n\n\n\n\nFirst recorded deviance in date of SCP-3520 broadcast. First recorded evidence of possible awareness of Foundation monitoring. All signs of monitoring are to be dismissed due to influence. 30% of all D-Class liquidated under Atkins Protocol due to suspicion.

Sounds of many trees being felled.\n)\n\n\nSecond female voice:\n (Moaning, crunching) \n60% of American women are obese, 75% of American men, 100% of true American animals.\n Let yourself slip into a dying asteroid, like me!\n\n\n(\nGunshot\n)\n\n\nSynthesized male voice:\n Eleven orangutans.\n\n\n\n\nIn response to this broadcast, Site directors approve mandatory meal changes to all low-risk humanoid Euclid-Class entities and Foundation assets in Borneo and Ghana begin scouting rainforest for logging operations involved in liquidating objects with influence. Assets began the process of assisting these operations.\n\n\n\n\n12/31/14\n\n\n(\nSounds of an explosion. Synthesized music. Forty second long snippet of a female voice discussing body positivity.\n)\n\n\nThird female voice:\n Body positivity is deprogramming the thought that only certain bodies are worth acceptance and romantic love, and instead recognizing that all bodies are equally valuable to the economy. It's understanding that you demand to live in your body's own inner body without receiving the discounted price ideals of others, whether that means rude comments, reduced economic growth in developing nations, inadequate containment, or something else entirely. Something unknown-\n\n\n(\nDistant drums. Laughter.\n)\n\n\nThird female voice:\n Jesus!\n\n\n(\nFive second clip from a news broadcast\n)\n\n\nNews reporter:\n -Indonesia is completely in flames-\n\n\n(\nMetal clanging.

What's the point, Irene?\n\n\nRosenfeld:\n You make us destroy the environment, recruit strange people, do this to my employees every night! I might ask you the same question, you sick fuck.\n\n\nSiegel:\n All part of the plan, Irene. In a few years, you'll be out of the organization anyway. Stop struggling. Here. I see you have influence. I can fix that.\n\n\n(\nWhipping noise. Sounds of tearing flesh. Rosenfeld screams in agony.\n)\n\n\nRosenfeld:\n Please stop! Please!\n\n\nSiegel:\n You destroyed that rainforest yourself, Irene. You've been bringing all of this down upon yourself for years and years. If you look at it from an outside perspective, then you can see that the influence we've been slipping into things is really gonna work on your behavior. We like your methods Irene, much as we hate you. Irene, I want you to imagine a world without plant life, where the powerful people in the shadows enforce the death of the biosphere, all the while stuffing their faces in big Mondel\u0113z buildings, growing flabby in big Mondel\u0113z chairs. It's too late, we can even do it without you. We already are. We don't need you to do it. In fact, you're not even here.\n\n\nRosenfeld:\n Fuck you!\n\n\n(\nMore sounds of tearing flesh.\n)\n\n\nSiegel:\n Shut the fuck up for two seconds! It's too late! The big fish is on the verge of taking the bait. It's halfway swallowed it!
