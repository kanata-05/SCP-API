Access to the interior of SCP-257 is restricted to level two containment and recovery personnel and above. Motion-detecting video cameras have been set up throughout SCP-257's exhibits to monitor any new biological specimens that appear.\n\n\nAll biological specimens extracted from SCP-257 are to be examined, logged, and removed from SCP-257. Biological specimens are to be placed in one of Site 93\u2019s temporary holding pens for study and threat classification. If researchers identify specimens they deem worthy of further research, personnel are to fill out Form 257-12 and follow appropriate research protocols. Specimens are otherwise sent to Bio-Site 29 for storage and long-term care.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-257 is an abandoned zoological garden and park located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, United Kingdom. The zoo itself, described as a \"Collection of Curiosities\" is named for a William Woodsworth, billed as \u201cthe greatest explorer and naturalist this side of Reality 12/3.14.\u201d According to promotional materials found within SCP-257, the zoo was founded in 1899 to \u201ceducate the gentlemen and ladies of England about Nature, and the many strange Beasts encountered by Explorers on their Travels.\u201d No permits, building licences, or planning permissions have been found that correspond to the location or appearance of SCP-257.\n\n\nSeveral signs and notices indicate that the zoo has been temporarily closed for maintenance, but the dilapidated appearance of the park and outdated equipment suggests that the park has been abandoned for at least fifty (50) years.\n\n\nAt irregular intervals, animals will appear within the zoo\u2019s confines through an unknown manner. These animals appear in the various enclosures at random intervals. Simultaneously, a hand-written manual appears at the entrance of the zoo inside the ticket booth. These guides detail the proper care and feeding of each organism and sometimes reveal information about its origin and acquisition. The animals vary widely in appearance, behaviour, and classification; many do not appear to be related to any terrestrial animals. There does not appear to be any schedule as to when these animals are delivered. See Acquisition Log W-257 for a complete list of animals delivered in the past \u2588\u2588 years.\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the following typewritten note was discovered pinned to the entrance of SCP-257 along with a guide.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE DESK OF PROFESSOR WILLIAM WOODSWORTH, EXPLORER AND NATURALIST\n\n\nTo the esteemed gentlemen and zoological enthusiasts of the Special Containment Procedures Foundation:\n\n\nAs you are no doubt aware by now, I have decided to entrust you with my zoo and my collection of rare and exotic animals while I take a leave of absence. You are straight-thinking and responsible men of science and you will no doubt be able to look after them. After my travels through\n [REDACTED], [REDACTED], \nand\n [REDACTED], \nI've decided to visit the thirteenth moon of Enouious as the next stop on my safari. Naturalists and learned men such as yourselves will no doubt enjoy studying some of the splendid and vital creatures that I\u2019ve discovered here. The viewing public will appreciate the new additions to my collection- they\u2019re like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen! I cannot write much longer; my indigene guides and I will be up early tomorrow to check the traps.\n\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\n\n- \nRegards, Professor William Woodsworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0SCP-257\u00a0Sample\u00a0Acquisitions\u00a0Log\u00a0Log\u00a0232a\u00a0as\u00a0of\u00a0\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/3/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nElephas\n sp. unknown, possibly \nE. antiquus\n\n\nFive miniature elephants, approximately three (3) feet high.
