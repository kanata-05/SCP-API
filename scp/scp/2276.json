See Document 2276-W for details.\n\n\nInstances are to be logged in civilian databases as small asteroids of equivalent visual magnitude as appropriate, depending on location.\n\n\nWhere possible, instances in orbit of earth are to be de-orbited and any debris recovered; otherwise any available station-keeping fuel is to be reserved for averting collisions with legitimate civilian satellites.\n\n\nSCP-2276 instances may be used for gathering scientific data, however a number of restrictions apply. Use by external researchers or agencies must be approved and requires an appropriate non-disclosure agreement. Note that data pertaining to other SCP objects may have additional restrictions beyond those for SCP-2276. Under no circumstances is the data gathered by SCP-2276 (other than SCP-2276/1) to be released to the public.\n\n\nResearch into orbital debris removal is to be given high priority for funding. Grants may also be given to groups outside the Foundation for research in this area.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2276 is a class of artificial space satellites, orbiting various bodies in pairs. (Each SCP instance designation refers to one pair.) Each pair is an exact duplicate of the original Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites (designated SCP-2276/1) as they existed at 18:04 on June 11, 2002. SCP-2276/1 was originally launched by NASA on March 17, 2002.\n\n\nInstances are functional and will respond to commands transmitted to them. However, transmissions must be aimed directly when commanding instances that have not yet been reprogrammed per 2276-W, to avoid accidentally commanding multiple instances at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrbital plot showing all instances in orbit of Earth as of 2008-12-31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew instances of SCP-2276 will spontaneously manifest in orbit around Earth or another body. The rate at which new instances appeared was initially around one per 8 months. The rate has increased over time since then - around one new instance per day in early 2016 - and is predicted to continue rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2276/3b during inspection, following recovery from orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n991 instances have been discovered to date\n1\n, 347 of which are not in orbit of Earth. Orbits are all circular with varying altitudes, and are isotropically distributed. A complete catalog of SCP-2276 instances is available in Addendum A.\n\n\nSCP-2276/3a and b were recovered from orbit on April 22, 2004. Physical inspection at Area 15 revealed no inconsistencies, and no anomalous phenomena occurred during quarantine. SCP-2276/3 is currently in storage at Site 73.\n\n\nA third satellite was launched into proximity of SCP-2276-1 on January 4th, 2006 to conduct visual inspections of the satellites. No discrepancies have been found between the SCP-2276/1 and the satellite plans to date.\n\n\nA number of collisions occurred between SCP-2276 instances and other artificial satellites in 2007-2009, prompting the addition of the active collision avoidance program to the containment measures. This has significantly reduced the incident rate.\n\n\nWhile the rate of incidents arising from collisions with SCP-2276 remains manageable at the present time, SCP-2276 will likely pose a significant problem for space activities in the future, and may lead to an ablation cascade event\n2\n within the next decade if actions are not taken to avert it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2007\u201101\u201111\n\n\nSCP\u20112276/45\n\n\nCollision occurs disabling SCP-2276/45a, b and Chinese weather satellite FY-1C.
