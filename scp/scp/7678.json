D-81536 expired immediately upon exposure to the memetic agent\n\n\nResult:\n \nFAILURE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 05/17/1993\n\n\nSubject:\n D-97153\n\n\nObservations:\n D-97153 is a supporter of Marxism-Leninism. Upon exposure to the memetic agent, D-97153 began convulsing violently and expired two hours following exposure\n\n\nResult:\n \nFAILURE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 05/31/1993\n\n\nSubject:\n D-44292\n\n\nObservations:\n D-44292 is a supporter of the racial beliefs held by the German National Workers Party. Upon exposure to the memetic agent, D-44292 began mildly convulsing and lost consciousness seven minutes following exposure. D-44292 regained consciousness 13 hours after the test and was diagnosed with retrograde amnesia\n\n\nResult:\n \nFAILURE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 07/05/1993\n\n\nSubject:\n PoI-2852\n\n\nObservations:\n PoI-2852 is a captured member of a radical sect of the Church of the Broken God. PoI-2852 was seemingly unaffected by the memetic agent, but there was a noticeable drop in hostility and a decrease in religious practices in the weeks following the test.\n\n\nResult:\n \nMILD-SUCCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 07/16/1993\n\n\nSubject:\n Senior researcher Arthur Brown\n\n\nObservations:\n Researcher Brown was suspended due to severe violations of the Foundation's code of conduct, including inappropriate sexual conduct with a contained anomaly. In the weeks following exposure to the memetic agent, Researcher Brown adopted a cynical personality unbecoming of him and confessed the extent of his crimes to the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nResult:\n \nSUCCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 07/17/1993\n\n\nSubject:\n Senior Researcher Simon Agler\n\n\nObservations:\n Agler is a biological male who identified himself as female. Two weeks following exposure to the memetic agent, Agler ceased identifying as female.\n\n\nResult:\n \nSUCCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Department tasked with finding and reforming Foundation employees who held beliefs deemed to be problematic or dangerous.\n\n\n2\n.
