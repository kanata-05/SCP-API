Geographic and aerial surveys of the area have been altered to make it appear to be empty desert, with no valuable archaeological or mineral features.\n\n\nOn-site personnel have several tasks:\n\n\n\u2022 To prevent unauthorized observation of, and access to, SCP-557. Despite its inhospitable location, several occult groups including the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appear to be aware of SCP-557 and have shown an interest in it. Unauthorized personnel are to be taken into custody, interrogated, and dealt with appropriately. Anyone attempting to tunnel below Level 5, or disturb the stone block in the floor of Room 501, is to be terminated immediately.\n\n\n\u2022 To continue to attempt translation of the records found in SCP-557.\n\n\n\u2022 To monitor the area for SCP-557-1. SCP-557-1 should be assumed to be Keter-class and is to be captured if possible, otherwise terminated.\n\n\n\u2022 To monitor Room 501 and serve as a strike team should anything emerge from beneath it.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-557 is an Umm an-Nar era tomb estimated to have been built ca. 2400 BCE, on a gravel plain in the \u201cEmpty Quarter\u201d of Northwestern Oman. Investigation of the surrounding area indicates it may be part of the lost city of Ubar. SCP-557 was discovered in 1988, during an inquiry into the disappearance of a geological survey team in the area.\n\n\nUnlike similar structures, SCP-557 includes five underground levels, constructed primarily of sandstone, apparently used as an ancient prison and containment site.\n\n\nAlthough living quarters and weapons for approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 staff/guards exist on Level 1, the facility appears to have been slowly abandoned over the years, and empty since ca. 300 CE. Only two skeletons were found on Level 1.\n\n\nA substantial library of records was found on Level 1, in a number of ancient languages. Only the records in Egyptian and a final note left in Greek have been translated.\n\n\nLevels 2 and 3 are stated in the records to be a prison for \u201cheretics and sorcerers\u201d but appear not to have been used for up to 1000 years before the site was abandoned.\n\n\nLevel 4 is described as \u201ca place for the abnormal.\u201d Skeletons resembling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been discovered locked away in stone cells, confirming the intent of the structure.\n\n\nLevel 5 consists of a 51.2-m-long hallway filled with complex traps and deadfalls, leading to a single large (21.3\u00a0m x 19.7\u00a0m x 5.4\u00a0m) room, designated as 501. Although all of the traps appear to have been sprung or cleared, researchers should exercise caution. The door to Room 501, anachronistically composed of [REDACTED], was found torn down from the inside. Based on the distribution of dust in this area, this event happened only approximately 20 years ago.\n\n\nIn the center of the floor of Room 501 is a partially buried 3.2\u00a0m x 3.35\u00a0m granite block, estimated to weigh 80,000\u00a0kg. The block is covered with untranslated runes. A similar, thinner, block stands in the room and shows evidence that a living being [designated SCP-557-1] was chained to it, using chains from the same material as the door. No evidence of the continued presence of SCP-557-1 has been found. Translated records only refer to SCP-557-1 as \u201cthe prisoner\u201d with the exception of one reference in Egyptian to \u201cthe bastard son of Apep.\u201d\n\n\nAddendum:\n Translation of a note found in the records room:\n\n\n\n\nI will write in Greek, so that any learned man who finds this place will understand. I am the last of the Keepers, and I will be dead soon. The sands are taking this place, and perhaps it is for the best. The prisoner must not escape, and the gateway to the dark must never be opened. I do not think the gate can be moved, but who knows of the prisoner? Not even the Gods could kill it, and it was only with their help that he was secured. Without the rituals, I do not know. Secure the door the best you can, and never move the stone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-556\n | SCP-557 | \nSCP-558\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-557\n\" by Leicontis, rewritten by eric_h, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
