The personnel assigned to SCP-3752 reside and work from Site-1969, situated 205\u00a0m North of SCP-3752. No vital personnel (Researchers, Specialists etc.) are to progress further than 5\u00a0m into Area-3752.\n\n\nCivilians inside Area-3752 are to be detained, questioned and released. Cover-up stories are to be provided, defining Area-3752 as harboring an unstable mine prone to collapsing. Fatalities are to be covered up similarly.\n\n\nFurthermore, personnel assigned to the SCP-3752 project are to take note of these thresholds. However, Class-D personnel are not to be informed of them to at least partially ensure their cooperation during testing. The estimates have been created after Test 3752-T#10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance / Range\n\n\nClassification / Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0-5\u00a0m\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-10\u00a0m\n\n\nDangerous (only Class-D personnel are allowed beyond this point)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\u00a0m\n\n\nLatest possible time of onset of hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12-20\u00a0m\n\n\nUnconsciousness highly likely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21-23\u00a0m\n\n\nExpiration imminent, occurred in 75% of cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\u00a0m\n\n\nShould be considered the barrier of expiration, as 100% of subjects have died to this date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n185\u00a0m\n\n\nInsufficiently shielded drones stop working\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNear basement\n\n\nAt this time, \nall\n drones stop working\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3752 denotes a building situated in Sochi (Russia), which resembles a heavily damaged prison facility. Remains of 28 persons are visible inside Area-3752, 9 of which are Foundation personnel. SCP-3752 is considered the anomaly's core, with Area-3752 exhibiting unusual properties as well.\n\n\nWhen a living organism enters Area-3752 the ambient temperature of 18\u00a0\u00b0C drops by 3\u00a0\u00b0C. Why the ambient temperature inside Area-3752 constantly stays at 18\u00a0\u00b0C and how it is maintained is currently unknown. Research into this matter is ongoing. Proceeding towards SCP-3752 causes the body temperature of the organism to decrease by increments of 0.185\u00a0\u00b0C. The effect is reversed when gaining distance from the center.\n\n\nAddendum 3752-A#1:\n Following the results of Test 3752-T#4, it has been determined that Area-3752 can affect non-organic materials without causing damage by rapidly changing their temperature. Further tests are being conducted.\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a03752-T#1\u00a0:\u00a0Exploration\u00a0of\u00a0anomalous\u00a0properties\n\n\n\n\n<\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a03752-T#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n Class-D personnel D-9742 (32 years, male) sent into Area-3752. Subject ordered to constantly report readings from heartbeat monitor, GPS and temperature sensors attached to thorax and scalp.\n\n\nNotes:\n All reports from D-9742 were concised to redact irrelevant information.\n\n\n\n\n00:00:00:\n Test begun.\n\n\n00:00:43:\n 6\u00a0m inside Area-3752. Core temperature at 35.89\u00a0\u00b0C. Heartbeat slowed (68 BPM).\n\n\n00:00:57:\n \nD-9742 observed shivering. Subject attempts to retract from Area-3752. Subject ordered to continue. Subject complied.\n\n\n00:01:28:\n 14\u00a0m inside Area-3752. Core temperature at 34.41\u00a0\u00b0C. Heartbeat slowed (58 BPM).\n\n\n00:01:33:\n \nSubject was observed to be shivering profusely, but remained on course.\n\n\n00:02:04:\n 20\u00a0m inside Area-3752.

Heartbeat slowed significantly (33 BPM).\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n 6 seconds after the last report, D-9742 collapsed and presumably expired.

Subject equipped with heavy-duty wet suit and insulated protective clothing lined with [DATA EXPUNGED] to keep their body temperatures at an acceptable level.\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n 9 seconds after last report was made and D-10283 crossed the 24\u00a0m threshold, the subject collapsed and reception of readings at Site-1969 ceased.\n\n\nNotes:\n D-11278, a 30 year old male in above-average condition, was sent to retrieve D-10283's body and equipment. The former was not brought back, the latter was.\n\n\nNotes by Project Head Jensen:\n \nWe still don't have a way to protect ourselves from the cold or whatever causes this drop of temperature. If what we gave\n that \nClass-D wasn't enough, we might not be able to go beyond 24 meters. At all.\n\n\nNotes by Technician, inspecting equipment given to D-10283:\n \nThis is interesting. None of the devices have been damaged by the cold. They basically got shock-frozen, but it appears this \"cold\" is different. That's also apparent because after we came back with it and measured the temperature of the parts inside and the casing, we found all of them at a little over 12\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nFollowing the inspection, the Description was updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a03752-T#5\u00a0:\u00a0Exploration\u00a0of\u00a0Area-3752\u00a0using\u00a0drone\n\n\n\n\n<\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a03752-T#5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n Remote-controlled drone, designation RF-882-28-2, controlled from Site-1969, with camera sent into Area-3752.

Sensors immediately registered drop of temperature, both of surroundings and of drone.\n\n\n00:00:07:\n 11\u00a0m in Area-3752. Temperature of drone and surroundings unchanged. This indicates that SCP-3752 does not somehow modify Area-3752 itself, only the organisms inside.\n\n\n00:01:04:\n 70\u00a0m in Area-3752. Sudden temperature drop of surroundings registered, now at -19\u00a0\u00b0C. Drone temperature beginning to drop.\n\n\n00:01:52:\n 114\u00a0m in Area-3752.

Camera feed slowly fading into green, interference visible as well. Once distance was estimated to be 15\u00a0m, camera feed cut out, presumably due to electromagnetic interference.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n No attempt at recovery made. Fate of drone unknown. Possibly destroyed due to falling from the air or simply unpowered due to EM interference.\n\n\nNotes by Project Head Jensen:\n \nIs this disappointing? Yes. Will this stop us from going on? No. The progress we've made with that drone is phenomenal. We might just be able to see into SCP-3752 if that is\n actually \nEMI. With the appropriate shielding, we can get anything through there. Come on, people, let's take Five and then prepare another drone. Use an RF-1027-77-7 this time. It has better resistance against EMI.

        "In the basement of SCP-3752, a series of generators and, as it seems, the source of the EMI. It has been described as a \"rift\", 3\u00a0m wide, 6\u00a0m high and floating 1\u00a0m above the ground. The rim has a dark red tint and is 0.4\u00a0m wide. The inside is black with no other colorations observed. During the observation, approximately 1,400 unknown, black entities have left, 450 have entered the rift, respectively. After leaving it, they seemingly phased through the walls. Observers from Site-1969 could not see them emerging from the ground. Entities entering the rift first left the walls, then directly entered it. Between the entities leaving and entering the rift, no size differences have been observed. It is unknown what these entities do outside what the Foundation assumes to be their universe.",
