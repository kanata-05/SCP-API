A quarter-kilometer buffer zone has been set up and fenced off around it; an \u201cIndustrial Brownfield\u201d cover story has been disseminated.\u2028\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-891 is a 4-acre field located in Tulare County, California. Any edible crop planted within SCP-891 will become, upon harvesting, an instance of SCP-891-1.\n\n\nShould any animal, including a human, ingest any amount of SCP-891-1, a portion of equal shape and volume will disappear from one of their internal organs. Autopsies have revealed bite marks upon the organs of affected animals.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The deed to the property upon which SCP-891 sits was mailed to Site-19 on December 23, 2022, with the following message:\n\n\n\n\nMorning, lovelies.\n\n\nThis deed corresponds to a 8-acre property, which in turn contains a 4-acre plot subject to an anomalous condition. If animals eat anything that grows upon it, part of their organs will be simultaneously consumed.\n\n\nI highlighted the relevant region in red on the attached map, because it never hurts to be helpful.\n\n\nWe got what we needed from it. Then we thought: \u2018tis the season to be generous, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nContain it in good health.\n\n\nYours,\u200e \u200e\n\nIris Dark\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMC&D INTERNAL DOCPORTAL\n\n\nWelcome, MAY DU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading information on \nASSET D-DL-1132\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSURED VALUE:\n\n$0.00 (NO LONGER IN MC&D POSSESSION)\n\n\nEST NET BENEFIT:\n\n$10,500,000\n\nSALE PRICE - $0.00\n\nREAPED BENEFIT - $10,000,000.00 (DL HARVESTING)\n\nOTHER - $500,000.00 (EST SCPF DONATION GOODWILL)\n\n\nINVOLVED RESOURCES:\n\nDU, MAY X1278-1\n\nNIRAN, PETE X7453-132 (LOST)\n\nNIRAN, PETE X7453-133\n\nGILMAN, DUSTIN N/A-N/A (LOST)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying documentation associated with \nASSET D-DL-1132\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing Document 1 (1/3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n May Du (\nmdu@internal.nyc.mcd.co.uk\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n Iris Dark (\nidark@internal.global.mcd.co.uk\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Dreamlight harvest on new asset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay,\n\n\nReaching out about a recently obtained asset. Obviously, it\u2019s D-DL. These days, it seems like I never worry about anything else.\n\n\nStory\u2019s pretty simple. Guy by the name of Dustin Gilman has a field that\u2019s not far from the road. Folks stomp through it, swipe his fruit, whatever. He gets mad. Real mad. And the dreamlight comes and goes through him like a lightning-bolt.\n\n\nThe field\u2019s irrelevant. I\u2019ll probably hand it over to SCPF soon, just to get it off the books. If you eat anything that grows out of it, you wind up munching on your own organs. Pretty bog-standard. Lacks the cleverness of that jail-cell SCPF has filed under \n2701\n, which is, to my mind, the most impressive spite-manifestation we\u2019ve seen. Not especially surprising; losing some apples beats losing a kid, which is what happened to the poor bastard who made \nthat\n.\n\n\nBut I think some of the bolt that went through Dustin is still pulsing in his veins. He\u2019s in a cell in the New York office, waiting for you.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be on facilitation. Use Sump 12, since it\u2019s our most comfortable, and we want him comfortable the whole way through. We\u2019ll need an interviewer, of course, so loop in a dier. You know how it goes.\n\n\nYours,\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing Document 2 (2/3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Peter Niran (\npniran@internal.nyc.mcd.co.uk\n)\n\n\nFrom:\n May Du (\nmdu@internal.nyc.mcd.co.uk\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n New staffing for harvest event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey Pete,\n\n\nHope you\u2019re doing well!\n\n\nSlating you for a harvest event in Sump 12, tomorrow at noon. This is a red-slip, so plan to get yourself aligned by 11. No need to bother making any memories between then and the event.\n\n\nStandard scope-limitation precautions. You\u2019ll get a simplex receiver, so I can facilitate. No video, of course, but we\u2019ll be receiving a live audio feed.\n\n\nIf things get out of control in there, don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll remake you and try again. The sump has a real state-of-the-art psych field, so he\u2019ll get steadily more open once you get the reader going up. Typical premium for annihilation will apply, of course. We can make additional copies if we need to. I\u2019ll make sure someone goes home that night.\n\n\nAlso, good news- we fixed the pump. It should boot to full power automatically and within a half-second. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember any earlier difficulties, but speaking as a friend, I can assure you that this is an improvement you should be extremely excited about.\n\n\nAll best,\n\nMay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing Document 3 (3/3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT OF HARVEST EVENT\n\n\nSUMP 12 | NEW YORK | 11.07.2022\n\n\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n is slumped on a couch. His head is propped up on a large, pink pillow. \nNIRAN\n enters, closing the door behind him. The automatic lock clicks shut. \nNIRAN\n tries the door, ensures that he has no ability to exit, and nods in satisfaction.)\n\n\n(\nNIRAN\n taps \nGILMAN\n on the shoulder.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You must be Mr. Gilman.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n opens his eyes and screams.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Can I help you, sir? Is everything all right?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Where the fuck am I? Who are you?\n\n\n(\nNIRAN\n sits on a nearby wooden chair.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n One question at a time, sir.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n rises to his feet. His gaze sweeps over the room. He notices the door. He does not notice the \nPUMP\n; its reader holds steady at 1.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n If you don\u2019t calm down, sir, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help you.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n runs to the door and attempts to open it.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n It\u2019s a reinforced door, sir. If you try to force it open\u2026\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n jumps into the door, which does not budge. He crumples to the ground.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n \u2026you\u2019ll only hurt yourself. Gosh, that\u2019ll leave a bruise. Well, I guess it won\u2019t; that\u2019d take a few hours, and I actually don\u2019t think we have that long together. But there\u2019s some ice cream in the freezer over there. Why don\u2019t I get that for you, and we\u2019ll apply it to the site of\u2026\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n jumps into the door again.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Yeah, I\u2019d probably do the same. Well, I guess I wouldn\u2019t, because then I\u2019d be doing it right now.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n moans.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n We\u2019re basically in the same boat, Dustin, didja know that?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n How do you know my name?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You\u2019re pretty famous around here, Dustin. I work for a lady who works for a lady who\u2019s been wanting to hear you talk for a while.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n You have a key on you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Dustin, look at the damn door. You don\u2019t see a keyhole, do you? Do you even see a handle?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Listen, I know you have some way of getting out of here.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Would that I did, Dustin. Can I call you Dustin?\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n runs toward \nNIRAN\n and is temporarily incapacitated by his taser.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Golly, Dustin\u2026\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n retches on the ground.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Hey, May, is there a mop in here? This\u2019ll stink up the sump something terrible.\n\n\nDU:\n I can run one in if you want.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Might be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. You\u2019d need a couple guards with you; our boy\u2019s a flight risk. The pump\u2019ll take care of it when it goes, right?\n\n\nDU:\n It assuredly will not. But there\u2019ll be a hell of a lot of cleanup post-activation. A little barf won\u2019t make much difference.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Well, then we\u2019ll let it lie. Sorry to bug ya.\n\n\nDU:\n Don\u2019t you worry.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Dustin. Hey, Dustin.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Fuck you.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You can kill me if you want, Dustin. Just means I get to clock out early.\n\n\n(Reader increases to 2.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n And seems like what you\u2019re doing is working just fine.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Who are you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n My name\u2019s Pete Niran. Good to meet you!\n\n\nGILMAN:\n What do you need from me?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I just need to ask you some questions, Dustin.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Then I\u2019ll be out of here?\n\n\n(\nNIRAN\n whistles.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Why don\u2019t we cross that bridge when we come to it, Dustin. But let\u2019s say that insofar as there is a way out, the only way out is through.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n walks over to the couch, limping slightly, and sits down.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Did you want that ice cream?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Aren\u2019t you taking enough?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I\u2019m sorry?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Don\u2019t condescend to me. Not on top of all this.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience you may have suffered.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I\u2019m not dead, am I?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Nope.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n So why am I here?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Gosh, Dustin, where to start? Why do \nyou\n think that you\u2019re here?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I promise I don\u2019t know. Where is here?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Well, this office is in New York, Dustin. Not too far from the old abode in Clifton.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n You know where I live?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Well, that\u2019s where we picked you up, so I should hope so. But to tell you the truth, this isn\u2019t about New York. Or Clifton. It\u2019s about Tulare County, Dustin. Beautiful, beautiful Tulare. You\u2019ve got a plot out there, right? Your grandma\u2019s? Where you spend a month out of the year?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you fucking psycho.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Don\u2019t start denying now, Dustin, or I won\u2019t be able to trust a thing you say later. And later, I might actually have a thing or two wrong. So you\u2019ll want to be able to correct me if I say something \nwrong\n.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Fine. I\u2019ve got a plot in Tulare.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Good job. So one more time, Dustin\u2014why do you think that you\u2019re here?\n\n\n(Reader increases to 3.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You don\u2019t have to say it out loud. Sounds like you nailed it, though.\n\n\n(Reader increases to 4.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Oh, you \nreally\n nailed it!\n\n\nGILMAN:\n It was \nbizarre\n. It was nothing that could have been real. I would just come back and I don\u2019t know where they came from and then I would go back and it was like a dream in Clifton, you know, it was so far away, and I kind of thought to myself, oh, there\u2019s no way that that really happened all the way over there, or it couldn\u2019t have been me doing it, or they, you know, they can\u2019t have been people.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n It was just you on the lot?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Sure. I guess. And the people who ate the fruit, of course. Not many. Just some. And the vegetation was so thick that I guess they never saw the rest until they themselves-\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You didn\u2019t have a caretaker for the property?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Oh, I- I did. Nice girl. I don\u2019t know where she went, though.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Sure you do!\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I don\u2019t know how many there were.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Oh, we don\u2019t either. We have forty as a low bound. Very, very low bound.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Yeah, that\u2019s too low.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n We knew you\u2019d be worth talking to.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I get angry. I guess I get angry too easy. I\u2026 I would just be sitting there when I was in Jersey and I would think about folks just marching onto my land, taking things that were-\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You once hung up a little wire across a dirt road, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I did. People were cycling across just about every morning. And it bothered me. Maybe they\u2019d scare off the rabbits or something. Maybe they\u2019d see the house through the woods and decide to\u2026 well, it\u2019s a dangerous world.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Sure is.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n And it was mine, wasn\u2019t it? I get to decide what gets done on my land, don\u2019t I? It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a\u2014\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Take your time, sir.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n It\u2019s a man\u2019s \ncastle\n, is what it is.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n But you didn\u2019t put it across your land, did you?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n No. About fifty feet past the cutoff. I figured, if it was on mine then it\u2019d come back to me, and anyone cycling past mine would still\u2026 and they never did find out that it was me. They tried to get the Dunns for it, but they were on vacation at the time and they beat it pretty easy, so all\u2019s well that\u2026\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n pauses.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I felt pretty bad about what happened to the kid, though.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n That\u2019s big of you.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n But he wound up all right.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n pauses.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n He wound up all right.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n pauses.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n And, you know, these days there\u2019s ramps everywhere.\n\n\n(Reader increases to 5.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I was in DC a few months ago for a work trip and they cut a ramp into the Library of Congress. Old, old building and a huge ramp just sticking out of the facade.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n How about that.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I sent a few hundred to the family when they were doing PT. And then an extra seventy just for him. For whatever he wanted to spend it on. It was anonymous, but my return address was on the envelope, and you know what I got back?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n What?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n A note from the kid. Handwritten. It said thank you so much.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n What\u2019d he spend the seventy on?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Some game. Elder Ring or something. Really shocked me. I mean, I had no idea video games had gotten so expensive.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n And that was before the apples in the field turned to\u2026 what they turned to.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n No, no. That was after the field turned. But that was in California, and this was in Jersey. I told you already, it wasn\u2019t the same when I was in Jersey.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Tell me when the field turned.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Well, I was thinking about someone stepping onto the land and grabbing some fruit. Just stomping all over the field. Maybe- maybe hosting a party on it. How would I know? I mean, the caretaker we hired, she was just out of high school herself. Maybe she was inviting people, you know? And it\u2019s the kind of thing it\u2019s fun to be angry about. You want to get angry about it. Not big, just, sometimes life is boring and you get to thinking about-\n\n\nNIRAN:\n What year was this?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n 2016, I think. 2015?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n And when did this effect start?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Well, I wasn\u2019t there at the time, so I didn\u2019t know until I had gotten there myself. But one day I was thinking about it, just getting kind of worked up about it, and all of a sudden I felt like my head had taken a shit, and I knew something big had happened, I just didn\u2019t know what.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n When did you next get to Tulare?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n A couple months later. But I called the caretaker that day. Asked her to head on over and make sure everything was normal about the place.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n And was it?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n She never called back. Just up and quit on me.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Oh?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Well, Christ, as far as I know, right?\n\n\n(Reader increases to 6.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I was burying bodies every time I went up there. They\u2019d been dead a while, usually. I\u2019d put them in sacks and I\u2019d try not to look at their faces.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Why didn\u2019t you cut down the apple trees?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Because that would mean it was real. That would mean that it had always been real, and there was no way it was real. It couldn\u2019t be real.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Also, they\u2019re my apple trees. I mean, why should I cut down my apple trees?\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n sighs.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Yeah, I guess I know why I\u2019m here.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Good job.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n You said that already. So what does that make you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d accept \u2018justice\u2019?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Don\u2019t condescend to me.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I represent a partnership dreadfully interested in the way you made the field turn.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Well, I won\u2019t be much help there. I still don\u2019t know how I did it.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Don\u2019t worry. We know how you did it.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n So why don\u2019t you just do it on your own?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Well, you\u2019re something of a special guy.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Hell, we\u2019re both just people.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Kind of.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n What?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I\u2019m made partially out of burlap. You want to feel?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Don\u2019t fuck with me.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Here. Press into my arm.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Jesus.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Yeah. I can straighten it back out; it\u2019d just take a while.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Are you a robot or something?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n No.\n\n\nGILMAN \n(backing up)\n:\n Then what the fuck are you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Oh, I\u2019m Pete Niran. But there was a Pete Niran before me, and there\u2019ll be one after me. I\u2019m made out of burlap because it\u2019s cheaper that way, and I\u2019m only meant to last for a week or so.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Why would you agree to that? Did you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Kind of! I\u2019m getting paid 80% of the price differential between a flesh clone and a burlap one. All my memories are intact and saved. And when I retire, or we enter a less busy season, then I\u2019ll be back in flesh bodies.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n But you just said you\u2019re going to die in seven days.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n No, I\u2019m going to die in a half-hour or less. But when I say I\u2019m getting paid the difference, I also mean the Pete Niran after me. He\u2019s got a family to go home to. A family that likes the finer things. He also likes the finer things, and he gets triple pay on the days that he dies. I get triple pay on the days that I die.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n backs further away.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I go to a checkpoint. I save my memories. I go out there and die. I get remade, I live for a while, I save my memories, I go out there and die. And the whole time, there\u2019s always a Pete. There\u2019s always someone tucking in the kids. It\u2019s life, you know? Just life.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n How many times have you died?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n I\u2019ve never died, in a way. I was born a few days ago. But I\u2019ve also died over a hundred times, and each time I guess it was fine, because I\u2019m still here.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n That\u2019s not how it works.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Yeah, I\u2019ve heard the argument. It goes: you were born a few days ago for the first time. You lived, for the first time. The memories in your head are someone else\u2019s, not yours. There\u2019s no shared kinship. And then you\u2019ll die, like anyone dies, with nothing after. Or whatever\u2019s after.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n And you\u2019re probably right. But if you are, it\u2019s far too late to change anything.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n We can break out together. The two of us. You\u2019d have a few days out of this\u2026 this facility. You could see the world, a little bit.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Wouldn\u2019t be good for me, Dustin. I\u2019m too much of a family man. And I leave the facility every night, to see them. Then I head back to work.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Do the kids know about the burlap?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n We\u2019ll tell them when they\u2019re old enough.\n\n\n(\nGILMAN\n shakes his head.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n It\u2019s not as big an issue as you think. Hey, May!\n\n\nDU:\n Hey. Pete.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n May, how often do I die screaming?\n\n\nDU:\n Oh, God, really, Pete?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Really.\n\n\nDU:\n Well, it\u2019s your right to know, I guess. (\nDU\n ruffles papers.) Out of terror or out of pain?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Out of terror.\n\n\nDU:\n Only ten percent of the time.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n So only thirteen times.\n\n\nDU:\n Twelve. I rounded up.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I\u2019m never leaving here, am I?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Gosh, Dustin, are you really going to make me say it?\n\n\n(Reader increases to 7.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Yeah. You\u2019re going to keep me around here forever.\n\n\n(\nNIRAN\n shakes his head.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Oh God.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Though you could\u2026 you could make something happen, couldn\u2019t you?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I don\u2019t even know how I did it the first time. I don\u2019t even know what I did. What did I do?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You inadvertently served as a conduit for dreamlight.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I \nwhat\n?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You wanted something so badly that the stuff of dreams channeled through you and made it as you wished it.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I didn\u2019t want that.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You only need to want it for an instant.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Who hasn\u2019t wanted something terrible for an instant? Who hasn\u2019t? Why is it me? Why did\u2026\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Wrong place, wrong time, I figure. It\u2019s a dangerous world. Lots of wrong places.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I\u2019m not responsible for my thoughts.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Didn\u2019t say you were. But you could try to be. You could try to make it happen again.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n You wouldn\u2019t want it to happen again.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Come on now, Dustin. I\u2019d just be clocking out early.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to want it. I mean, she\u2019s dead. The caretaker. You don\u2019t need to tell me she\u2019s dead. I found a whole family there once. I\u2026 I took their car into the barn. I\u2026 look, I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to want to want it. I\u2019m so hungry. What am I supposed to do when I\u2019m so hungry?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n We have some food.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Ice cream. Christ. Don\u2019t condescend to me. I\u2019m trying here. You don\u2019t know how hard I\u2019m trying. I hate you so much. I\u2026 can I rant at you?\n\n\nNIRAN:\n If you\u2019re asking permission, you don\u2019t hate me enough.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n You\u2019re a murderer. You murder others and you murder yourself. You\u2019ve buried more people than I have and you think they were you but they weren\u2019t.\n\n\n(Reader increases to 8.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n And you\u2026 you drag me in here and you tell me\u2026 look, if we\u2019re dying together but you think you\u2019ll wake, or you don\u2019t care, or something, then you\u2019re a void, you\u2019re not even a person, and the idea that you get to go gently and I don\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n(Reader increases to 9.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I\u2019m so hungry. Jesus, I\u2019m so hungry.\n\n\n(Reader decreases to 8.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n They\u2019re in that field by the fucking dozen. They\u2019re never leaving the field. They\u2019re never climbing out and walking again. They\u2019re never going to be under the sun again.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n And I\u2019m in the field, too. If I get out I\u2019ll be the only one to get out of the field.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n But what the fuck am I supposed to do?\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I don\u2019t have it in me to repair that.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I\u2019m so fucking hungry.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Requesting an apple.\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n May, do you read me? Requesting an apple for immediate delivery.\n\n\nDU \n(tentatively):\n Please clarify origin of requested apple, if relevant.\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Not relevant.\n\n\n(Apple is delivered.)\n\n\n(\nNIRAN\n hands \nGILMAN\n the apple.)\n\n\n(Reader increases to 9.)\n\n\nGILMAN:\n Oh, thank God.\n\n\nGILMAN:\n I was so hungry.\n\n\n(Sound of eating.)\n\n\n(Silence.)\n\n\n(Sound of coughing.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n Always a pleasure, May.\n\n\nDU:\n You say that almost every time.\n\n\nNIRAN \n(snickering)\n:\n How about that?\n\n\nDU:\n Always a pleasure, Pete.\n\n\n(Coughing gets louder.)\n\n\nNIRAN:\n You think it's like falling asleep?\n\n\n(Reader increases to 10.)\n\n\n(The \nPUMP\n starts.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS AUDIO REMOVED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The \nPUMP\n finishes.)\n\n\n(\nDU\n retches into a wastebasket.)\n\n\n(\nDREAMLIGHT\n obtained.)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-891\n\" by habaniah, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
