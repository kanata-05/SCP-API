MTF Omicron-4 (\u201cBird Watchers\u201d) operatives are embedded in all major space agencies capable of directly observing SCP-3632 in order to falsify any data that may imply the presence of a biosphere or sapient life; however, it is unlikely that such data could be gathered due to civilian technological limitations.\n\n\nThe Wide Angle Research Telescope at Site-309 will image SCP-3632 every 30 days: staff are encouraged to review these images for reference.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3632 is an irregular planetoid with a mean radius of 440\u00a0km, currently approaching the Solar System from the direction of Alpha Centauri. Estimations of its current velocity indicate that SCP-3632 would not complete this journey for approximately 600 years: however, direct observations have suggested that SCP-3632 is able to anomalously alter its velocity and direction.\n\n\nSince 1998, WART imaging has revealed the presence of Earth-like biota on the near side of SCP-3632, as well as artificial structures resembling Old Kingdom and Ptolemaic architecture.\n1\n\n\nDue to the presence of diagrams strongly resembling SCP-3632, as well as star charts depicting an accurate route from the Sun to Alpha Centauri B, in the historical records of multiple cultures during the Hellenistic period, it has been hypothesized that SCP-3632 has previously interacted with humanity and is associated with a variety of avian religious figures or folk heroes, including Djehuti, Thoth, Garuda, and Lei Gong. However, aside from the perceived similarity of these diagrams, there is no information to confirm nor disprove this hypothesis.\n\n\nSeveral excerpts from contemporary documents that potentially describe SCP-3632 have been included below:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3632\u00a0Historical\u00a0Archive\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Historical\u00a0Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. prize of victory of the men of \nKHEMENNU\n, who devoted their most excellent minds and many years of their labour to the Pyramid\u2026 [illegible] gone from a seedling in the mind of the nomarch MERESANKH to a splendid structure, which towers over the city,\n\n6. and it has been built in the name of DJEHUTI, whom all men of intellect aspire to\n\n[illegible]\n\n9. as it was a structure most ingenious and pleasing to his sight, he took the whole city of KHEMENNU to the wondrous land of BROT KRUMA beyond the Sun,\n\n10. where his chosen followers will live in bliss forever.\n\n\n-Unidentified tablet fragments, dating to the early Third Dynasty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the later years of Huangdi\u2019s\n2\n rule, the god Lei Gong, who could control thunder and rode in a flying city, visited his capital of Xinzheng. The boy Ji M\u01d0n, who was one of Huangdi\u2019s sons, was a great admirer of Lei Gong and called to him, saying, \u201cLook at the canals I have made by the river: they protect the city from flooding. Look at the wooden birds I have made: they carry our people from one end of our kingdom to the other.\n3\n Is this not pleasing to you?\u201d\n\n\nBut Lei Gong was angry and said, \u201cMy people have been travelling for seven thousand years; they have travelled past the Moon and beyond the stars. But you bring them no food and no gifts, not even some workers to ease their burden. Instead you bring me tricks and toys, all of which I have seen before, and think this will please me?\u201d\n\nAnd there was a great storm above Xinzheng, which knocked the palace roof down, and floods lasting for two years.\n\n\n-Redacted passage of the\n Records of the Grand Historian \nby Sima Qian, circa 1st century BC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bird and the Floating Island\n\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a wise old Bird, named Thoth, that greatly desired the miraculous floating island of his neighbours: a miniature world, much like the one we live on now, with all manner of plants and animals. His neighbours, the Pistreans, were monstrous creatures with fins and fangs and rough, scaly skin, and they spread all across the island until the plants were gone and the animals dead. Desperate for aid, they called for help, and Thoth disguised himself as a wrinkled old crane and went to them.\n\n\u201cWise crane,\u201d said Akheilos,\n4\n their leader, \u201cwe have no food to eat and no crops to plant. Our children lie awake in their beds at night, keening with hunger. All we ask for is some bread, to fill our bellies and keep our people alive.\u201d\n\n\nFor this Thoth was glad, for he did not care for Akheilos or his people, and was not overmuch concerned with keeping the Pistreans alive. But because he sensed an opportunity for himself, he opened his crooked beak into a smile and said, \u201cMy friend, your troubles are my troubles; I promise you that your people will never have to go hungry again. But for everything, there is a price.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything,\u201d pleaded the lord of the Pistreans, and Thoth preened his tattered wings and said, \u201cAkheilos, my friend, as much as it pains me to say this, was it not you who led your people into famine? If I do this thing for you, you must leave the Pistreans and be bound outside the Universe, so they do not suffer the same fate again.\u201d\n\n\nWith a heavy heart, Akheilos agreed, and was bound and cast outside the universe. And Thoth was glad, because he knew that this was the only creature that could defeat him in what he planned to do.\n\n\nTo the remaining Pistreans, he said, \u201cHere is a spell that will give you all the bread you shall ever need: not a one of you shall ever be forsaken again.\u201d And giving them the spell, he departed that place as speedily as he could.\n\n\nThe Pistreans, being a trusting people, immediately opened the spell that wise old Thoth had given them, and gave shouts of joy as the few crumbs of bread they had left began to grow in size. But their shouts turned to groans of despair, then screams, as the crumbs continued to grow and grow, filling their plates and then their homes and finally, their entire floating world.\n\n\nWhen Thoth returned to that place, not a single Pistrean was left alive: all were buried beneath the vast, undulating waves of bread that covered the surface of the planet. And seeing this, Thoth began to work his magic. From the bread sprang up something that looked like plants and animals, at least to the untrained eye, and from under the planet\u2019s new crust rose the Pistreans, transformed into a new and terrible form of life. And they built palaces and edifices that were testaments to Thoth\u2019s great power, even if they were not entirely real.\n\n\nOutside of the Universe, Akheilos still lies bound, unaware of the fate of his people. Let the moral that he learns from this tale be thus: \nAn old crane may be very, very wise, but that does not mean he is on your side.\n\n\n-Second-century Italian folk tale, anachronistically attributed to Aesop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Historical\u00a0Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the condition that these documents are describing SCP-3632 and semi-accurate events relating to it, a tentative secondary anomaly has been designated SCP-3632-1. This is assumed to be a sapient being, which may be responsible for SCP-3632's fluctuating architecture and autonomous changes in velocity.\n\n\nExploration:\n Due to recent advances in unmanned superluminal travel, as well as the avian features of many SCP-3632 architectural features and the suspected avian nature of SCP-3632-1, the exploratory probe \nSitchin-1\n was approved by regional O5 Undersecretariat vote (8-3, 2 abstaining). Designed to survive entry and re-entry of both Earth and SCP-3632 atmospheres, it was proposed that it would perform both an aerial flyby and a landing on the anomaly, collect surface samples and image potential avian lifeforms, and return to Earth for additional analysis at Site-309.\n\n\nSitchin-1\n was deployed on 08/15/2016 from the Penalva Launch Site, under the guise of a commercial satellite launch. It is projected to reach SCP-3632 by 01/03/2017.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\u00a0Sitchin-1\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Sitchin-1\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical malfunction reduces Solar Array 3 to 60% power.\n\n\nIncident attributed to faulty wiring.

Despite all parts being in good working order, no data had been transmitted back to Site-309 for the duration of its mission. The following post-mission analysis was conducted by Head Researcher Iqbar and Junior Researchers Kelsey & Bouche, both to determine the causes behind the probe\u2019s mechanical failures and to review the video and audio data collected during the mission.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n00:02\n Hello? This is Dr. Maglan. I\u2019m officially beginning this analysis: the quarantine officers have just finished reassembling our probe, and it looks like there\u2019s no evidence of tampering with any of the machinery, anomalous or otherwise. Our next course of action is to go through the video available to us and determine what, exactly, caused us to lose contact for the better part of two years.\n\n\n00:05:\n \nDr. Kelsey finishes linking\n Sitchin-1 \ninternal audiovisual files to Site-309 database.\n All set up, sir. Should I go ahead and play it, or\u2026?\n\n\n00:05:\n Whenever you\u2019re ready.\n\n\n00:06:\n \nDr. Kelsey activates the video logs.\n Sitchin-1\u2019s \ncameras activate as it achieves low-earth orbit and activates its main thrusters. After some deliberation, Dr. Bouche fast-forwards the video:\n Sitchin-1 \nis engulfed in a micrometeor shower which slightly dents the transmission dish, believed to be responsible for the mechanical failure.\n\n\n00:10:\n Sitchin-1 \nenters weirspace\n5\n uneventfully.\n\n\n00:47:\n \nA minor malfunction in\n Sitchin-1\u2019s \nweirspace stabilizers is hypothesized by Dr. Bouche to cause the anomaly in location readout previously observed, but subsequent testing confirms that this is not the case.\n\n\n01:25:\n Sitchin-1 \nexits weirspace 14 minutes early, appearing directly over SCP-3632. The anomaly is approximately 3\u00a0km from the location it was imaged at by the WART telescope at the same time as the mission, accounting for relativistic differences.\n\n\n01:27:\n This is Dr. Maglan again. The probe appears to be starting its descent towards the\u2026 wait, that doesn\u2019t look right.\n\n\n01:29:\n \nAs\n Sitchin-1 \napproaches the surface of SCP-3632, ripple-like distortions appear in its camera feed. The buildings on the anomaly\u2019s structure are now clearly visible, appearing to self-construct and crumble to pieces over the course of minutes.\n\n\n01:34:\n \nA distortion overtakes\n Sitchin-1, \nand it suddenly appears near the upper atmosphere of the planet. Atmospheric perturbations resembling aurorae are visible overhead.\n\n\n01:36:\n Interesting. That\u2019s\u2026 Dr. Kelsey, can you confirm that quarantine completely sterilized the probe? Yes? Okay.\n\n\n01:48:\n Sitchin-1 \nbegins its descent toward SCP-3632 another 14 minutes early, following its pre-programmed flight path.\n\n\n01:56:\n Sitchin-1 \ninitiates landing maneuvers over what superficially resembles a field of brown grass. Subsequent video analysis, as well as residual matter on\n Sitchin-1\u2019s \nlanding gear, reveals that these are in fact down feathers, apparently still living.\n\n\n02:02:\n Sitchin-1 \ntouches down. A large ibis-shaped monument is visible in the distance, emanating a blue light.\n\n\n02:04:\n That's what we're looking for, right\u2026right there. John \u2013 hey, John \u2013 could we get a focus on that area of the screen?\n\n\n02:05:\n \nTwo avian entities with humanoid faces, approximately 6 meters in height, approach from the direction of the monument. They appear to be softly whispering to each other.\n\n\n02:05:\n Dr. Bouche, you\u2019ve been on the SCP-3632 project since almost the very beginning. Do these entities resemble SCP-3632-1 from the literature? Can we confirm its existence?\n\n\n02:07:\n I mean \u2013 ah \u2013 all the records are so vague, it\u2019s, it\u2019s really very difficult to tell\u2026\n\n\n02:08:\n State your name for the record, please.\n\n\n02:08:\n Oh, sorry, sorry. This is Dr. Bouche. And\u2026 in my professional opinion, I would have to say not. SCP-3632-1 is often described as a bird-headed humanoid with powers of flight, although these creatures could be\u2026 associated?\n\n\n02:10:\n \nThe two entities pause in front of\n Sitchin-1 \nand face the camera. After a pause, they both produce noises reminiscent of throat-clearing.\n\n\n02:13:\n Are they trying to communicate? \u2026Dr. Bouche, port this through to Command.\n\n\n02:16:\n \nThe two entities simultaneously begin producing harmonies, which are elaborated into melodies. Dr. Maglan laughs.\n\n\n02:17:\n They\u2019re singing to us, you see that? Beautiful. Beautiful birds.\n\n\n02:19:\n There are tens of billions of birds in the world, did you know that? Almost 50 birds per person. Now there are birds in space, you see that. We are very, very small.\n\n\n02:22:\n \nBoth entities\u2019 melodies shift a note. Cognitohazard alerts begin to sound.\n\n\n02:23:\n I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here. Bouche, activate the SCRAMBLE filters.\n\n\n02:25:\n \nThere is no response from Bouche. Entities continue to vocalize.\n\n\n02:26:\n Bouche? Bouche, what\u2019s going on? Activate the SCRA\u2026\n\n\n02:27:\n \u2026The scra\u2026\n\n\n02:30:\n \nEntities continue to vocalize.\n\n\n02:32:\n Scra.\n\n\n02:33:\n \nAlerts from Site-507 indicate that \nSCP-3662\n is active and has begun to produce vibrations consistent with the entities\u2019 harmonics. All personnel within a 20-meter radius have begun experiencing symptoms consistent with SCP-3662-1 subjects.\n\n\n02:35:\n Scraaaa.\n\n\n02:38:\n \nReports of SCP-3662-1-like symptoms begin to arrive primarily from regions surrounding Site-507, with exceptions.
