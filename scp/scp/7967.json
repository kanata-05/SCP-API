In light of the data implied by the object's behavior, this file is restricted to Clearance 5/DoTT personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7967 is a device developed by the Department of Tactical Theology in 2003. It was designed to harvest the abnormally high amount of Akiva Radiation that is produced when a human being dies.\n\n\nSCP-7967 functions through the theory that before entering an afterlife, a being tends to worship at greatly increased levels, a result of attempting to enter a \npositive afterlife\n and contemplating one's mortality.\n\n\nThis energy tends to dissipate shortly after the subject's death. SCP-7967 functions by tracking these events and using Wozny-Hellman Worship Sinks to absorb it successfully.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7967 has been deemed to be nonfunctional and has gathered no Akiva Radiation in the two months since its activation. This is believed to be a result of the fact that although during this period approximately 11,000,000 humans have become corpses, none of them have died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7966\n | SCP-7967 | \nSCP-7968\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7967\n\" by NielleiN, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
