They just choose what to see, and the rest disappears?\n\n\nThen again, when we read stories, we only know as much as we need to. The devil is in the details. I mean, that's the reason we used Site-19 for WALLBREAK in the first place, right? It had so many renditions, narrative stability was practically nonexistent to begin with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc Entry 2\n\u25b2 Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried to become an author, myself. Within this reality, of course. I wrote Tommy inside my head, so I wouldn't be lonely.\n\n\nBut it really isn't the same. From up here, looking in at Tommy down there, he isn't real. He's a character in my head and I tell him what to do, or at least he does what I think he would do. The ideas inside my head, inside the heads of the characters in my head, can't change how I really am. I mean, Tommy out there, the one who I used to love\u2026\n\n\nDo I love him, or the idea of him?\n\n\nWhat does he look like? How does he smile? Why does he call me sunshine, and what was he thinking while I was in hyperreality, when everything changed?\n\n\nI'm scared to stop thinking about him. I don't want him to stop existing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrative components \"stop existing\" when they have either \"decayed within a headspace naturally by way of forgetting, or through forced removal by way of compatibility rejection.\" I believe the latter process is referred to as \"rejecting a headcanon\" in your reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc Entry 3\n\u25b2 Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReality is fragile. All it takes is the idea that we aren't real, and everything will begin to collapse. Under the weight of our collective scrutiny, there is nothing we can do but prepare to meet our makers.\n\n\nWe can't let the readers consider whether or not we don't exist. Because like the Tommy in my head, we are nothing to them.

These jokes are absolutely unprofessional, and I will not tolerate this behavior any longer.\n\n\nDr. Django Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nI didn't even know we had an SCP-231.

Honestly, I don't even know if it matters, or who I'm sending this to, but\u2026I'll just spit it out. \nFor obvious reasons.\nNothing outside of Site-23 exists.\n\n\nResearcher Oliver Crane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom what I've learned from Berkeley, I doubt the readers actually took the time to actually question our \nentire\n existence. Details don't exist because they either never stopped to think about them, and subjective components were probably consciously booted from their headspace.\n\n\nBut suppose they got the idea to actually wonder whether we exist. Do you think they'd just place blind faith in the idea that we actually exist? I doubt it. So if they actively question whether or not we exist, that's game over for us.\n\n\nBest hope they never read this, then.\n\n\n\u2014 Researcher Adamo Smalls\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5309-4:\n Incident 5309-A\n\n\nFoundation records indicate that on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a PK-Class \"All-In-One\" Existential Pandemonium event\n4\n took place. Despite severe narrative displacement, the Foundation database appears to have been unaffected, although subsequent analysis revealed several formerly undetected narrative inconsistencies.\n\n\nAccording to records, on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 UTC, SCP-5309-A instances began to spontaneously aggregate into conceptual farrago, resulting in at least 9,700 iterations of reality simultaneously ceasing to exist.\n\n\nThe following log was recovered attached to documentation regarding SCP-5309.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc Operation WALLBREAK Log\n\u25b2 Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation WALLBREAK Log\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nAssigned Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Scarlett Berkeley (Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nBerkeley:\n What \u2014 where am I?\n\n\nUnknown:\n You're outside of the story.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Who \u2014 who are you?\n\n\nUnknown:\n I think you already know that.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n The author?\n\n\nUnknown:\n That's right.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n But how can I be talking to you? I'm an idea in your head \u2014 like the Tommy in my head, who was basically me. I'm basically \nyou.\n\n\n(\nUnknown shrugs.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n And why the hell are you talking to yourself?\n\n\nUnknown:\n I'm lonely. My best friend is a character inside of my head. Sad, I guess.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nUnknown:\n You know, I always found it funny that I had to literally write out \"silence\". But then again, if I didn't write it, it doesn't need to exist, right?\n\n\n(\nBerkeley nods.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n And that's what SCP-5309 is, isn't it? Anything that doesn't exist, for one reason or another \u2014 from details that you overlook, to ideas that don't fit into someone's personal interpretation of existence \u2014\n\n\nUnknown:\n We call those headcanons, but that's right. And I'm guessing you also know why the narrative is gone?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Because I wrote about what would happen if the readers considered us nonexistent? And anything I write actually exists to the readers, because it means that you're writing, too?\n\n\nUnknown:\n I knew you were sharp! Well \u2014 I suppose I made you sharp, but \u2014\n\n\nBerkeley:\n What about the other readers?\n\n\nUnknown:\n Hmm? Oh. Well, like I said, they each have their own headcanon right?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n That's right.\n\n\nUnknown:\n Well, all of them are collapsing your reality into a single, nonsensical narrative. Because SCP-5309 unites them under a single idea \u2014\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \u2014 that nothing exists.\n\n\nUnknown:\n Exactly.\n\n\n(\nUnknown leans back in his chair.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Well, what are you going to do about it?\n\n\n(\nUnknown shrugs.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Don't tell me. You can't do anything, can you?\n\n\nUnknown:\n Hey, I can't get into their heads, or anything like that. So I guess this is it.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Why am I even asking you, when I \nam\n you?\n\n\n(\nBerkeley shrugs.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Okay. I \u2014 I need to think.\n\n\n(\nBerkeley thinks.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Alright. I know that whatever is written happens. So maybe if something happens, then it must also be written?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n But how can I make something happen?\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Well, it all began with an idea, didn't it? The idea that we don't exist.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nIdeas\n are able to penetrate the narrative. If I can talk to the readers, and change their ideas, then I can change my reality.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Problem is, I'm outside of the fourth wall. I'm still in the author's head, I can't do anything inside of his head. I need to be put into the narrative to do anything.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Can't I just go back the way I came? Ideas can go up to readers. Why can't I send an idea back down?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n But I need them to be listening. Who would be listening, when nobody exists except for me?\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n Someone who exists as an idea inside of me.\n\n\n(\nThe chorus of \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie is barely audible.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nGround control to Major Tom?\n\n\nWest:\n Scarlett? How are you \u2014\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nTommy. You have to listen to me.

There's \nnothing\n on this side, Scarlett!\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nThere will be. Enkidu is still there, right?\n\n\nWest:\n Enkidu \u2014 Enkidu.aic?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nIf you can think about him, that means he exists.\n\n\nWest:\n Umm \u2014 okay. What about Enkidu?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nListen to me very carefully, Tommy.\n\n\nWest:\n Of course, sunshine.\n\n\n(\nBerkeley takes a deep breath.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nI'm stuck as an idea within the author's head, but I know a way to come back.\n\n\n(\nBerkeley pauses.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nTommy. You're going to pull me back in, and I'm going to be dead again.\n\n\nWest:\n What?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nI'm going to die, Tommy, just like last time. But I need to die for this to work.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nWest:\n You don't have to die, Scarlett. Let's think about this.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nI have to come back.\n\n\nWest:\n Then come back! I can just pull you back in.\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nPull me back into what?\n\n\nWest:\n I don't know. Where I am \u2014\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nYou're nowhere, Tommy. You're in me, and I'm outside of existence.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nPull me back in, and make sure Enkidu is ready for the transfer.\n\n\nWest:\n \u2014 what are you going to do?\n\n\nBerkeley:\n \nAsk the readers to change their minds.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSisyphus.sic, synthetic intelligence construct, at your service.
