Class-A amnestics are to be administered to personnel with memories of SCP-3485. In the event that the discovery of SCP-3485 is published, false information is to be disseminated flagging it as a hoax.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3485 is an extranormally large specimen of \nHomarus gammarus\n, or common lobster, located seventeen light-years away from Earth. SCP-3485 measures approximately 1.57 x 10\n6\n kilometers from head to tail. For comparison, the Sun is 1.39 x 10\n6\n kilometers in diameter.\n\n\nMultiple major differences have been noted between SCP-3485 and non-anomalous lobsters, aside from its massive difference in size. Firstly, the carapace of SCP-3485 is abnormally resistant to damage. In multiple instances, collisions with exo-planets have left no signs of damage. In addition, SCP-3485 shows no signs of burns or radiation damage from its regular, extended contact with small stars.\n\n\nSecondly, SCP-3485 has a complex digestive system adapted to its esoteric diet. The primary food source of SCP-3485 is residue created by stars during fission reactions, such as leftover hydrogen and helium. SCP-3485 has also been observed to feed on star material by itself; feeding is accomplished using heat-resistant tendons located in its mouth.\n\n\nTo digest this material, SCP-3485 has an extremely efficient digestive system that uses a poorly understood nuclear reaction to process material. This digestive system is capable of complete mass-energy conversion and produces no waste products.\n\n\nThirdly, SCP-3485 has an efficient transportation system that negates the need for nutrients and oxygen. The bloodstream of SCP-3485 does not use blood, but rather a highly conductive gaseous solution to transport electrical energy. In addition to this, multiple high-efficiency recycling systems replace regular respiratory procedures responsible for life. This fluid also heats up during energy transportation, generating enough heat to keep SCP-3485 alive, essentially negating the Square Cube Law\n1\n.\n\n\nFinally, SCP-3485 is capable of instantaneously teleporting itself to other stars to use them as a fuel source. It is unknown how SCP-3485 accomplishes this.\n\n\nAside from these modifications, SCP-3485 has the same systems as a non-anomalous lobster, although scaled up by several orders of magnitude. SCP-3485 is normally very sluggish, due to its large size and the time required for nervous signals to travel across its body. However, it is unknown how SCP-3485 does not collapse according to the rules of gravity, or how it is biologically immortal.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-3485 was discovered by amateur astronomer Ronald \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in 1998. He attempted to publish his findings in a scientific journal, and was met with mass ridicule. The Foundation discovered SCP-3485 after investigating \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's findings in 2001.\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Attachment:\u00a0History\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-3485\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENT LOG\n\n\n\n\n09/08/2001:\n Atmos Telescope is directed towards [EXACT COORDINATES REDACTED]. SCP-3485 is observed to be feeding off of a smaller star. SCP-3485 is classified in the Foundation database.\n\n\n04/05/2003:\n SCP-3485 observed to transport itself to another star. First recorded movement of SCP-3485.\n\n\n06/07/2004:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula. It stays there for 3 hours before returning to its star.\n\n\n09/30/2004:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula once again.\n\n\n08/22/2007:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to another star in the [REDACTED] region, and discovers SCP-3485-1 in orbit of it. SCP-3485-1 appears to be the shell of another specimen of SCP-3485.\n\n\n06/25/2007:\n SCP-3485 transports both itself and SCP-3485-1 to the star it was previously stationed at.\n\n\n06/27/2007:\n SCP-3485 observed to feed star material directly into SCP-3485-1's mouth.\n\n\n08/14/2008:\n SCP-3485 transports itself and SCP-3485-1 to the Crab Nebula.\n\n\n09/01/2008:\n SCP-3485 and SCP-3485-1 return to the previous star.\n\n\n10/12/2008:\n SCP-3485 attempts to initiate mating rituals with SCP-3485-1 and fails.\n\n\n11/12/2008:\n SCP-3485 attempts to initiate mating rituals again, and fails.\n\n\n11/25/2008:\n SCP-3485 uses its claws to create a hole inside of SCP-3485-1, revealing it to be hollow.\n\n\n11/26/2008:\n SCP-3485 incinerates SCP-3485-1 in the star it is orbiting.\n\n\n11/28/2008:\n SCP-3485 reaches into the star, possibly in an attempt to recover SCP-3485-1. Its claws are burnt as a result.\n\n\n12/05/2008:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula, and remains there until 04/12/2008.\n\n\n04/12/2008:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to a third star, and resumes normal behavior.\n\n\n05/06/2014 - 05/13/2014:\n 2014 expedition to SCP-3485 occurs. Data is gathered.\n\n\n09/12/2015:\n SCP-3485 transports itself to an area of space in the [REDACTED] region, despite the lack of stars or any discernable food source.\n\n\n03/03/2016:\n Due to the fact that SCP-3485 has not moved from its area since 2015, and that it might starve itself, the 2016 expedition commences.\n\n\n03/05/2016:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 notes the similarities between the area SCP-3485 inhabits and previous sites of Class C \"Broken Entry\" wormholes.\n\n\n03/07/2016:\n The 2016 expedition ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Research is being conducted to determine if \nSCP-2378\n or \nSCP-3536\n violate the Square Cube Law in a similar fashion.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0by\u00a0notgull\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0by\u00a0notgull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnotgull's Proposal\n\n\nRating: 590\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3733\n\n\nRating: 380\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3095\n\n\nRating: 360\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4804\n\n\nRating: 281\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2785\n\n\nRating: 280\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4800\n\n\nRating: 279\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4348\n\n\nRating: 258\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4048\n\n\nRating: 207\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4688\n\n\nRating: 196\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-579-J\n\n\nRating: 189\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3362\n\n\nRating: 188\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5800\n\n\nRating: 184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4785\n\n\nRating: 176\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3339\n\n\nRating: 168\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3747\n\n\nRating: 165\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4248\n\n\nRating: 161\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4948\n\n\nRating: 158\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-199\n\n\nRating: 133\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7234\n\n\nRating: 124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3296\n\n\nRating: 124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4800-J\n\n\nRating: 121\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4799\n\n\nRating: 120\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3485\n\n\nRating: 112\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5981\n\n\nRating: 109\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4808\n\n\nRating: 103\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3833\n\n\nRating: 98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3748\n\n\nRating: 94\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5054\n\n\nRating: 88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4148\n\n\nRating: 88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5025\n\n\nRating: 87\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1037\n\n\nRating: 77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-093-J\n\n\nRating: 74\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1684\n\n\nRating: 70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5680\n\n\nRating: 65\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4872\n\n\nRating: 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3248\n\n\nRating: 61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6904\n\n\nRating: 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5483\n\n\nRating: 38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6785\n\n\nRating: 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4397\n\n\nRating: 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Robot that Could\n\n\nRating: 349\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Siege of Site-19\n\n\nRating: 169\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Flock\n\n\nRating: 168\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales of the Automaton: The Big Birdocalypse\n\n\nRating: 143\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootage Recovered From a Private Server\n\n\nRating: 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoose on the Loose\n\n\nRating: 77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvian Anthology I\n\n\nRating: 76\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Empire of Birds\n\n\nRating: 63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument recovered from a Parallel Universe\n\n\nRating: 61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Fucknuts Steals The Declaration of Independence\n\n\nRating: 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatz and Dogs\n\n\nRating: 55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Guard\n\n\nRating: 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVacation Opportunity\n\n\nRating: 45\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scent of a Toaster\n\n\nRating: 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurn, Baby, Burn\n\n\nRating: 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing Suns\n\n\nRating: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Feet Under I\n\n\nRating: 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind in the Sails\n\n\nRating: 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shape of Water is Humanoid\n\n\nRating: 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Reckoning\n\n\nRating: 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Feet Under II\n\n\nRating: 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Feet Under III\n\n\nRating: 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForgotten Shrine\n\n\nRating: 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown Through\n\n\nRating: 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInto the Beetle Black Yonder\n\n\nRating: 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperfine\n\n\nRating: 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Knock on Strange Doors\n\n\nRating: 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Calvin's Personnel File\n\n\nRating: 91\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nRating: 83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sphere\" Incursion Log\n\n\nRating: 52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Incursion Log\n\n\nRating: 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cube\" Incursion Log #1\n\n\nRating: 44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cube\" Incursion Log #2\n\n\nRating: 44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-093-J Recovered Documents\n\n\nRating: 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-093-J Blue Test\n\n\nRating: 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-093-J Purple Test\n\n\nRating: 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-093-J Green Test\n\n\nRating: 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 4480-1\n\n\nRating: 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee my \nAuthor Page\n for more information.
