Item requests are to be reviewed prior to approval or denial. The cell is to be monitored, and all regurgitations and/or excretions are to be analysed prior to disposal or storage. SCP-1809-A is to be fed twice daily as per Protocol SF-01. Microscopic analysis is to be conducted within a separate area in which individual instances of SCP-1809-1 may be observed and/or extracted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1809 is a collective of sapient microscopic organisms inhabiting cytoplasms within most permanent and quiescent cell types within a human male, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (referred to as SCP-1809-A). SCP-1809 is a former arborist with no professional links to cellular biology, cellular experimentation or other possible origin for SCP-1809's effect; SCP-1809-A claims to have been entirely oblivious to SCP-1809 inhabitants prior to discovery. SCP-1809 was discovered following SCP-1809-A's apparently unrelated skin cancer resulting in a cellular defect, to which a specialist private cancer treatment facility was referred, healing the impairment; SCP-1809 was discovered during a follow-up microscopic analysis of the affected area, in which the surrounding unaffected cells exhibited anomalies later identified as instances of SCP-1809-1.\n\n\nSCP-1809-1, the individual microscopic inhabitants of SCP-1809-A, resemble exoskeletal crustaceans. Instances of SCP-1809-1 emit intermittent pulsations of light from within an interior source; extensive observation reveals SCP-1809-1 to be constantly communicating via morse code. Topics of conversation primarily consist of the wellbeing of SCP-1809-A (referred to as \"Him\" or \"He\" between SCP-1809-1) and \"quality of life\" between individual instances (see Addendum). Despite this, language analysis has proven difficult due to extensive time taken to emit light pulsations.\n\n\nWhen a cell is selected, SCP-1809-1 will attempt to penetrate the cell membrane, invariably allowing for a safe opening to within, in such a manner so as to prevent lysis. Once inside, SCP-1809-1 will attempt to rearrange all internal subcellular organelles such as nuclei, without physically harming the cell interior. Following this, SCP-1809-1 will remain in a dormant and immobile state unless physically interacted with. Instances of SCP-1809-1 are asexual and do not appear to require sustenance. Further analysis of SCP-1809-1's behavioural patterns is yet to be conducted.\n\n\nAddendum 1809-01:\n Morse translation of a conversation between two (2) instances of SCP-1809-1 inspecting a neuron.\n\n\n\n\n[\u2026]ow is he?\n\nHe's fine. No illnesses as far as I can tell. What d'you think? Is this one to your liking?\n\nVery much so. In fact, this is among the best.\n\nIndeed. And of course, such a fine view of the nervous system from the axon terminals is irresistible, is it not?\n\nI love it.\n\nWhat's your verdict?\n\nI'll take it. I can't resist those dendrites.\n\nSir, you have yourself a deal.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n One (1) instance of SCP-1809-1 included within the above conversation remained within the neuron for three (3) days prior to the appearance of five (5) larger instances of SCP-1809-1, all of which appeared to physically enforce the removal of the first instance from the cell.\n\n\nAddendum 1809-02:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 - SCP-1809-A excreted and regurgitated several scraps of a paper-like substance composed primarily of thinned and dyed muscle tissue. The initial origin and method by which the muscle tissue was altered and transported in such a manner is unknown. Visible on the substance was clear text; individual scraps are included below:\n\n\n\n\nSEMI-ADJOINED LENS CELL, CRYSTALLINE LENS, FOR SALE WITHIN THE LEFT EYE\n\n\nFive cytoplasm beds, natural epithelium shape, constant hot ion/liquid supply and a perfect view of the pupil.

Trichocyte Cells!\n\n\nTrichocyte cells are for the hardest of the hard. Situated within one of the most sought-after toenails in the entire left leg, your supply of amino acids is invariable and secure.
