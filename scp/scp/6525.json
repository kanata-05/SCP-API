An O5 consensus regarding SCP-6525 is underway.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6525 is the designation given to a CK Class Reality Restructuring Event as initially reported by O5-5. Various individuals across the globe report similar experiences and consistently state that SCP-6525 took place on the 25/05/1998.\n\n\nAs of time of writing, the effects of SCP-6525 on our reality are not entirely understood, but is believed to have altered nature and the laws of science significantly.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-6525 Project\n\n\nSeveral days following the emergence of SCP-6525, O5-5 initiated the SCP-6525 Project (named Constantinople) with unanimous O5 approval. The SCP-6525 Project saw the halt of all non-essential Foundation operations and recruited personnel from various departments such as the Temporal Anomalies Department and the Reality Phenomena Division.\n\n\nThe following are excerpts taken from the project proposal.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Attached\u00a0Files\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Attached\u00a0Files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal: 'Constantinople'\n\n\nResearch Team: N/A\n\n\nProject Date: 28/05/1998\n\n\nProposal Statement:\n\n\nTo contain, revert or otherwise neutralize SCP-6525 (see appended documentation).\n\n\nResearch Team Lead:\n O5-5\n\n\nAssistant Leads:\n Senior Researcher Kyoka Tsu, Senior Researcher Epeli Cakau, Containment Specialist Johnathon Walters, Senior Researcher Natalie Geer, Senior Researcher Ronesh Naidu.\n\n\nRequested Resources\n\n\nN/A; resources to be acquired as deemed suitable by Team Lead. See 'Additional Requests'.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n01/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal: 'Constantinople'\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Requests:\n\n\n\n\nAuthority over Mobile Task Forces and GOI Response Initiatives\n\n\nAn immediate halt of non-essential Foundation operations such as research and GOI diplomatic talks.\n\n\nUse of any and all databases as seen appropriate by O5-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal: 'Constantinople'\n\n\n\n\nProject Details:\n\n\nProject Constantinople will encompass nearly all Foundation operations, requiring each Overseer to cooperate and act in unison with the Project Lead, O5-5. Three major areas of concern to Project 'Constantinople' are outlined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nContainment:\n Due to the inherently anomalous and widespread effects of SCP-6525, containment or neutralization must take place imminently. Personnel from varying departments, including the new divisions created as a result of SCP-6525, have been recruited to ascertain the nature of SCP-6525 and devise a method of containing, reverting or erasing SCP-6525 from our plane of reality.\n\n\nInformation Control:\n Personnel of varying departments and levels, along with members of the general public, reportedly maintain their memory of SCP-6525 occurring. Global efforts must be taken to ensure that SCP-6525 remains hidden and forgotten so as to maintain the veil of normalcy. Investigation and interventions of GOI knowledge of SCP-6525 will also take place.\n\n\nResearch:\n In order to aid in the containment sector of Project Constantinople, a separate Research Area has been devised. The purpose of this research team is to investigate and analyze the effects of SCP-6525 on our reality and to ascertain what is anomalous or not - for this purpose, the Site-01 Database and all Deepwell Servers have been unlocked for the research team's use, in order to compare our current state of reality to our prior one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n O5-5 Audio Logs\n\n\nDue to his experience with SCP-6525 and the work from Project Constantinople, the O5 Council assigned Site-93 Therapist Gabrielle Lobachevsky to O5-5. The following is a series of personal recordings made by O5-5 as part of therapy, and was uploaded per his request.
