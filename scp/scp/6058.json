Testing is forbidden.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6058 is a mechanical device capable of producing live specimens of any lifeform, extinct or otherwise, when provided with a valid sample of said lifeform's DNA.\n\n\nThe rate at which SCP-6058 performs this function is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the organism in question. Once completed, SCP-6058 will expel its reproduction through a metal shaft at the base of the object. Further attempts to analyze the interior structure of SCP-6058 have resulted in failure.\n\n\nExperimentation Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nChicken feather\n\n\nSCP-6058 produced a rooster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1 ounce of pork\n\n\nSCP-6058 produced a pig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTarantula leg\n\n\nSCP-6058 produced a tarantula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTarantula cadaver\n\n\nSCP-6058 produced a tarantula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n2 tarantula cadavers\n\n\nSCP-6058 produced two tarantulas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[72 LINES OMITTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\nMammoth fossil\n\n\nSCP-6058 appeared to strain for approximately eight hours, before producing what was later determined to be a deceased wooly mammoth calf.
