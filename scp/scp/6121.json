containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Cliometria.aic is cataloguing all high-profile public events taking place within Canada and projected to feature at least one mascot character. One additional humanoid containment chamber must be prepared at \nSite-43\n ahead of each such event. \nA new chamber must also be prepared prior to each occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.\n MTF Kappa-43 (\"The Mediators\") must be on-hand to capture any SCP-6121 instance which manifests; it must then be remanded to the new chamber.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6121 is a blanket designation for a series of humanoid anomalies resembling human beings wearing mascot character costumes. In actual fact, the costumes are hollow; they are, however, universally capable of movement, vocalization, and apparently limited cognition. Each SCP-6121 instance manifests through unknown means at a large scale public event held within the nation of Canada, resembling said event's official mascot \u2014 though always deviating from the approved design in one or several respects.\n.\nAberrant quadrennial manifestations suggest that whatever force controls the manifestation of SCP-6121 instances considers the Winter Olympic Games to be Canadian, whether taking place in Canada or not.\n Their actions are inexplicable, tending towards the ridiculous, and they universally communicate in extremely loud, flat tones. Their speech is only rarely pertinent, and very frequently incoherent.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6121-1, Partial Inventory:\n A representative sample of SCP-6121 instances retrieved from the Site-43 Network Database (43NET) is reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43NET: Catalogue of SCP-6121 Instances [SELECTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6121-1\n\n\nDate:\n 11/16/1963\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMascot:\n A stylized depiction of a snowy owl in the style of Inuit handicrafts, known as an \"Ookpik.\"\n\n\nDeviations:\n SCP-6121-1 has human proportions. Genuine Ookpik are typically the size of small plush animals.\n\n\nCircumstances of Discovery:\n SCP-6121-1 vandalized the Canadian displays at the 1963 Philadelphia trade fair, which Ookpik had been created to advertise, by ramming into the booth walls and screeching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\nDate:\n 11/16/1963\n\n\nPresent:\n Chief M.

McInnis (Director), Dr. I. Achterberg (Senior Researcher, Archives and Revision), Dr. H. Blank (Researcher, Archives and Revision), Dr. C. Bold (Director, Decommissioning Department), Dr. E. Euler (Visiting Fellow, Memetics and Countermemetics), [REDACTED] (All-Sections Chief), Dr. L. Lillihammer (Researcher, Identity and Technocryptography), Dr. B. Del Olmo (Chair, Memetics and Countermemetics), Chief O. Ready (Security and Containment), Specialist N. Zaman (Hiring and Regulation)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n I have a theory.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n What else is new?\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Well, that's the thing, actually. What if these subjects represent a shift in the pattern of anomaly creation? What if the only thing linking them together is their shared expression of something in the human zeitgeist? You read the first interview logs, right? Strauss was completely baffled by that fucking owl.\n\n\nDir. McInnis:\n It still baffles me.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Yeah, well, you're old.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n Lyle\u2026\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You're old too, on the inside. You need to loosen up. Sometimes a funny mascot is just a funny mascot.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n I think they're funny too! I just don't know if that means they aren't a problem.\n\n\nChief Ready:\n They obviously \nare\n a problem. There's forty-four of the bastards now, and Lord knows how much electricity and paperwork and productivity it's cost us to keep a lid on them.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n And we haven't learned a damn thing in all this time.\n\n\nDir. McInnis:\n It's hard to collect data without performing comparisons. There's still nothing to compare them with.\n\n\nChief Ready:\n And there never will be.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Oh, come on. We don't know that.\n\n\nChief Ready:\n I'm no scientist, Dr. Lillihammer, but I'm fairly certain that nearly four decades of nothing happening is a statistically relevant trend.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You're right.\n\n\nChief Ready:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n You're no scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n SCP-6121 instances ceased to appear at the Olympic Winter Games from this point forward. All other manifestations continued as per usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6121-2, Present Status:\n On the containment of the fiftieth instance of SCP-6121, the Overwatch Council appointed a Special Counsel to discuss this SCP object with the Director, Chairs and Chiefs of Site-43. An excerpt of their meeting is presented below.\n\n\n\n\nDebriefing Log\n\n\nDate:\n 10/09/2008\n\n\nPresent:\n Dr. A.J. McInnis (Director), Dr. A. Clef (Special Counsel), [REDACTED] (All-Sections Chief), Dr. H. Blank (Chair, Archives and Revision), Dr. T. Bremmel (Chair, Research and Experimentation), Dr. X. Du (Chair, Quantum Supermechanics), Chief D. Ibanez (Security and Containment), Dr. E. LeClair (Chair, Health and Pathology), Dr. L. Lillihammer (Chair, Memetics and Countermemetics), I. Mitchum (Chair, Administration and Oversight), Dr. M. Nass (Chair, Theology and Teleology), Chief N. Nascimbeni (Janitorial and Maintenance), Dr. N. Ngo (Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology), Dr. U. Okorie (Chair, Applied Occultism), Chief R. Ullis (Pursuit and Suppression), Dr. E. Veiksaar (Chief, Identity and Technocryptography), Chief N. Zaman (Hiring and Regulation)\n\n\n\n\nDir. McInnis:\n Yes, but that's precisely my point. They aren't dangerous at all.\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Who's talking about danger? Let's talk logistics: they're bleeding you like a stuck pig.\n\n\nDir. McInnis:\n Nonsense. These subjects have never once escaped containment. They're model\u2026\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Model what? Model \nprisoners,\n you were going to say? Because you're not running a prison here, McInnis, you're running an R&C Site.\n\n\nChief Ibanez:\n He's right.\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Hot stuff says I'm right.\n\n\nChief Ibanez:\n Hot stuff can reach your tie from where she's sitting, doctor. But here's what you're right about: in a prison, they let you out of your cell occasionally, to stretch your legs and pursue a hobby. These things are just rotting away in there, because Overwatch is scared to let them out.\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Well, first off: my tie is booby-trapped. Second: they don't rot; if they \ndid\n rot, this wouldn't be as much of a problem! Third: what the fuck would you even do with them? They're gibbering idiots.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n We could make them Special Counsels.\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Cute. No, really, you're v\u2014\n\n\nDir. McInnis:\n We've put in a number of proposals. 6121 instances are completely harmless. Do you know how many of our facilities have on-site daycare? I'm sure children would love to watch one of our fuzzy friends fall flat on its face all day. And on the topic of logistics, what about the D-Class shortage?\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Hm.\n\n\nDr. Bremmel:\n And again, they never rot. Nor do they eat, or sleep, or do anything but clown and caper around like little balls of infinite energy. Put them on a treadmill, for god's sake! Make a perpetual motion machine out of them!\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Enh. None of this is doing it for me. I think you've all gone soft, and you're coddling these things. I'm going to recommend you send the whole kit and kaboodle to Site-19.\n\n\nSilence on recording.\n\n\nDr. McInnis:\n I strenuously object. Do I have any seconds?\n\n\nThe assembled Chairs and Chiefs all raise their hands.\n\n\nDr. Clef:\n Cool. Any of you seconds got Overseer clearance?\n\n\n\n\nDr. Clef successfully petitioned the O5 Council to authorize the transfer of all SCP-6121 instances to Site-19. Upon arrival in containment at that facility, they were placed under his exclusive purview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE!\n\n\nA Security Clearance Level 3+ discussion has been initiated regarding this file!\n\n\n\n\nACTIVATE\u00a0ALL-SITES\u00a0INTERLINK\n\n\n\n\nALL-SITES\u00a0INTERLINK\u00a0ACTIVATED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-Sites Interlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP_Lague_322 (Director Paul Lague) has initiated discussion.\n\n\n\n\nP_Lague_322:\n CAPSLOCK CREW\n\n\n\n\nH_Blank_43 (Dr. Harold R.

    "containment_procedures": "Cliometria.aic is cataloguing all high-profile public events taking place within Canada and projected to feature at least one mascot character. One additional humanoid containment chamber must be prepared at Site-43 ahead of each such event. A new chamber must also be prepared prior to each occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games. MTF Kappa-43 (\"The Mediators\") must be on-hand to capture any SCP-6121 instance which manifests; it must then be remanded to the new chamber.",
    "description": "SCP-6121 is a blanket designation for a series of humanoid anomalies resembling human beings wearing mascot character costumes. In actual fact, the costumes are hollow; they are, however, universally capable of movement, vocalization, and apparently limited cognition. Each SCP-6121 instance manifests through unknown means at a large scale public event held within the nation of Canada, resembling said event's official mascot \u2014 though always deviating from the approved design in one or several respects..Aberrant quadrennial manifestations suggest that whatever force controls the manifestation of SCP-6121 instances considers the Winter Olympic Games to be Canadian, whether taking place in Canada or not. Their actions are inexplicable, tending towards the ridiculous, and they universally communicate in extremely loud, flat tones. Their speech is only rarely pertinent, and very frequently incoherent.",
