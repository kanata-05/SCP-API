Though the anomaly is considered neither neutralized nor explained, it has been deemed inactive. This will soon be filed under SCP-7573-ARC, where it will be kept available for further research.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Alexis Rose, Digitization Department Lead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-7573\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n \nSite-55\n personnel are advised not to open any unmarked mail received from the Site's mailroom, with the exception of Researcher Arthur, the current SCP-7573 research lead.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7573 is a series of letters manifesting within the Site-55 mailroom. Instances are always addressed to a member of staff with no return address. The contents of SCP-7573 will typically contain threats of physical violence against the addressee. When opened by the addressee, additional SCP-7573 instances will begin to manifest within their mailbox. If not opened, SCP-7573 manifestations cease after approximately four to five days, at which point the anomaly will target a new subject. An SCP-7573 instance opened by anyone other than the addressee will spontaneously combust, effectively destroying the message within.\n\n\nAddendum 7573.01:\n Research Log\n\n\nResearcher Arthur was instructed to keep opening any received SCP-7573 instances. At the time of writing, he is the only remaining SCP-7573 target. Attached is an abridged log of received SCP-7573 instances recreated by Researcher Arthur.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 1\n\n\nMessage:\n I'm going to kick your ass, you fuckin poindexter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 5\n\n\nMessage:\n I hope you fall down a well and get stuck down there, crying 'Wah, I'm stuck in a well, someone help me!' But no one ever comes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 14\n\n\nMessage:\n I ought to suffocate you, you little prick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 35\n\n\nMessage:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 52\n\n\nMessage:\n I'm actually running out of threats here, but you know, I'm starting to think you like this, you little weirdo. Do you like this, Arthur? Do you like it when I threaten you? Does that get your pathetic little rocks off?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 65\n\n\nMessage:\n I'm surprised you've made it this far. Most people give up after the first three days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 77\n\n\nMessage:\n Hey, just so you know, I was only joking before. About all that stuff with the threats and whatnot. Are we cool? Just open the next letter if we're cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 78\n\n\nMessage:\n Okay, good. Phew. I'm glad we're cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 89\n\n\nMessage:\n I guess what I'm trying to say is; I'm just so flattered somebody would stick it out despite me being such a dick. You're more patient than anyone I've ever known. Sorry for being so cruel to you. You didn't deserve that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 97\n\n\nMessage:\n N/A\n\n\nNote:\n The SCP-7573 instance contained a single rose. It is unknown how the envelope was able to store the rose, as the object was significantly larger than its container and showed no signs of exterior distortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 105\n\n\nMessage:\n You're the only person I can really talk to without fearing you'll abandon me. I know I acted very mean in the beginning but I guess I was just defending myself from being hurt again. I'm sure you know how it feels to talk to someone only to have them ditch you. I'm sorry about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 113\n\n\nMessage:\n Wanna hear something sad? You're probably the only friend I've ever had. How pathetic is that? But you wouldn't laugh at me over that, I know you wouldn't. You're a good friend, Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7573 Manifestation #:\n 120\n\n\nMessage:\n I'm glad we're friends. I'm glad I have you, Arthur. Thanks for listening to me.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the advent of email in 1978, snail mail fell out of favor as a means of intra-Site communications for the Foundation. For this reason, the Site-55 mailroom was demolished to make way for new SCiPNet servers. SCP-7573's final manifestation occurred on May 8th, 1979, one week prior to the demolition of the mailroom.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
