Groups of three or more instances are to have Mobile Perimeter Beta-C established. Instances that separate farther than 20 meters from groups are to be contained as singular instances. Class-C amnestics are to be used on civilians upon witnessing an instance of SCP-2990, though the total period of exposure may be factored into the amount or type of amnestic given.\n\n\nIf an instance of SCP-2990 moves into a populated area, Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") is to be sent to administer aerosol Class-S amnestics over the area. In the case that an instance remains in the area for longer than a period of 2 weeks, temporary stationing of personnel is authorized for monitoring purposes (See Incident Form-2990-B). Civilians should also be administered the antidote for Class-S amnestics, upon settlement of personnel.\n\n\nSCP-2990-A is currently held in Site-45 storage. No further efforts are currently needed to contain SCP-2990-A.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2990 refers to several intangible, levitating humanoid statues. All instances assume the pose of a human male standing upright. Each humanoid appears to consist of various materials, including wood, marble, concrete, and polymers. Groups of SCP-2990 tend to have instances composed of the same substance as each other, or at least relating to each other. Testing cannot confirm if each humanoid is made of the material they resemble, as each is completely intangible and cannot be interacted with.\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-2990 behave similarly to objects in a vacuum, and are not affected by friction. However, all instances appear to be following Earth's orbit and rotation around the sun. It is currently undetermined if gravity is able to affect an instance's trajectory, or if each instance is purposely following Earth's movement. There are currently 47 logged instances, including 5 that are currently located in isolated or subterranean areas not able to be readily surveyed.\n\n\nOccasionally, instances of SCP-2990 may change in direction and velocity through unknown methods. The changes are usually minor, and physical objects do not appear to have any influence on these changes. Instances of SCP-2990 are also capable of moving through any type of material without resistance. No adverse effects have been found in making contact with an instance.\n\n\nIt is currently undetermined if instances of SCP-2990 are sentient or sapient, though trends in behavior has been noted:\n\n\n\n\nInstances typically move at speeds of 1 to 5 kilometers per hour relative to Earth, though have been measured to reach up to 87 kph.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2990 are capable of traveling underground or above the atmosphere, though only 12 instances have been recorded to do so.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2990 tend to avoid populated areas, such as cities or towns, and remain in natural environments.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2990-A:\n During clean-up of Incident 2990-2, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported they had obtained close-ups of a polymeric instance of SCP-2990, consisting of what appeared to be polyethylene terephthalate granules (PET). Researchers noticed small engravings that were later determined to form two paragraphs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0422\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u044b \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043e \u0432\u0430\u0441.\n\n\n\u0418\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0443\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440, \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e\n\n\nTo those we have freed here, I pray of thee.\n\n\nGo and see a new world, untouched by power.\n\n\nI leave inscribed upon you, your last thoughts.\n -\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\n\n\nMy world is fractured.

All we can do is put faith in the devices we are walking through.\n\nI brought my family and others.

Protect us, Archais. -\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0435\u043d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 2990-1:\n On \u2588/\u2588\u2588/2003, several instances of SCP-2990 were reported to have emerged from Kovalevsky Forest, Russia. Field operatives discovered what appeared to be a single motionless instance of SCP-2990 (hereby referred to as SCP-2990-A), from which several instances were emerging. All agents described SCP-2990-A falling to the ground while making a facial expression of surprise. It appeared to have become tangible, and was transported to Site-45.\n\nResearchers have affirmed that the instance is composed entirely of concrete and aluminum slag. Later analysis revealed that SCP-2990-A's expression had changed to a contented smile from discovery to transportation. Surveillance of its transportation unit also reveals an faintly audible whisper originating from the statue, believed to be transcribed as \"We have (succeeded?) now. We are safe.\" Testing for any other anomalous properties is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2989\n | SCP-2990 | \nSCP-2991\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2990\n\" by Accelerando, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
