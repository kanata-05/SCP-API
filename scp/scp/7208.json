As a result, the disruption of SCP-7208 or any of its constituents is to be avoided.\n\n\nDue to the \nNATURE\nPERSONALITY\n of SCP-7208, it may only be described using inherently nebulous language, such as \nsemiotic pataphors,\n.\nDescriptions that employ concepts of adjacent or fundamentally disparate connotation in order to construct novel concepts with broader implications, or to approximate concepts that \nRESIDE\nFESTER\n outside the N\u00f6osphere.\n terms with many or contradictory definitions, and \nmotifs\n which serve to make \nBRIEFING\nSYMBOLISM\n more ambiguous, but are otherwise \nIRRELEVANT\nNEGLIGIBLE\n to SCP-7208 as a whole.\n\n\nIn general, SCP-7208 may not be \nCONVEYED\nWOVEN\n using concepts that suppose any \nBELITTLING\nSUPPRESSIVE\n connotation, nor may it be \nREFERRED\nALLUDED\n to using any designation other than \u201cSCP-7208,\u201d which inherently expresses no meaningful connotation as to the significance of SCP-7208.\n\n\nInformation about SCP-7208 is limited to personnel with Level 4 Clearance or higher; \nfurther research has been suspended indefinitely.\n\n\nPersonnel are advised to avoid \nDIVINING\nCONCEIVING\n SCP-7208 any unique or specific definition. All personnel directly involved in the \nOBSERVATION\nSUPERVISION\n of SCP-7208 are to be screened biweekly for indications that they have attempted, consciously or unconsciously, to \nUNRAVEL\nFATHOM\n SCP-7208 or any of its elements.\n\n\nPersonnel who understand SCP-7208 are to be terminated immediately.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7208 is the \nRHAPSODY\nTAPESTRY\n of concepts that preside over \nluck\n. SCP-7208 has only been partially analysed, due to its aforementioned \nNATURE\nPERSONALITY\n. The portions known to the Foundation correspond to the concepts of probability, randomness, circumstance, and \nSERENDIPITY\nSYZYGY\n.\n\n\nABIGAIL\nAMELIA\n Weaver\n, director of the analysis of SCP-7208 until its indefinite suspension, is currently held in a standard humanoid containment cell until further notice.\n\n\nFrom the limited portions of SCP-7208\u2019s \nTOPOLOGY\nCATEGORY\n, it was hypothesised that SCP-7208 \nPERMEATES\nDOMINATES\n up to \u25888.14% of the N\u00f6osphere in such a way that it at least partially intersects with human concepts of faith, hope, intention, and \nCREATIVITY\nFREEDOM\n.\n\n\nAs a result, SCP-7208 and its constituents are directly impacted by a subject\u2019s \ninterpretation\n of their meaning. This is somewhat \nALLEVIATED\nREMEDIED\n by SCP-7208's special containment procedures, namely the use of \npataphors,\n which effectively prevent subjects from constructing a coherent mental picture of the \nRHAPSODY\nTAPESTRY\n onto which they may, consciously or unconsciously, suppose their own \nVERSE\nSTITCHING\n.\n\n\nChanges in SCP-7208 or its constituents are directly reflected in baseline reality. One such \nreality restructuring event\n.\n\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n has occurred. (see: Incident-7208-\u03c0)\n\n\nDirector \nABIGAIL\nAMELIA\n Weaver\n is not to be identified using any specific or unique designation other than the duonym which was retroactively \nAPPENDED\nSEWN\n to her \nIDENTITY\nVOLITION\n following the events of Incident-7208-\u03c0 .\n\n\nABIGAIL\nAMELIA\n Weaver\n directed a temporary research team assigned to analyse the portions of the N\u00f6osphere corresponding to human \nCREATIVITY\nFREEDOM\n.
