Once detected, containment and security personnel under the guise of UK national law enforcement are to be dispatched to the site of SCP-3976 to secure a perimeter and investigate the manifestation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3976 is the collective term for a series of manifestations of apparent murder scenes of famous mystery writer Agatha Christie\n1\n. Thus far, every SCP-3976 instance has been located in rural England, and all components of each instance have been limited to a 50-meter radius. Additionally, every instance has appeared between the hours of 22:31 and 08:36, local time, although no records or witnesses of a manifestation event exist.\n\n\nEach SCP-3976 instance consists of the following components:\n\n\n\n\nA copy of the corpse of Agatha Christie\n2\n, designated SCP-3976. In each recorded instance, the corpse shows signs of violent struggle or murder.\n\n\nSeveral items in some way related to murder. For instance, a murder weapon such as a gun or knife, or a personal artifact, such as a piece of jewelry or a diary.\n\n\n\n\nIn no recorded SCP-3976 instance have there been any witnesses to a killing.\n\n\nNotable Recorded Instances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nDate & Location\n\n\nState of Corpse\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3976-1\n\n\nMarch 30, 2001, Stoodleigh. A corpse was found in the kitchen of an occupied two-story house.\n\n\nCorpse had two gunshot wounds, one in the stomach and the other in the chest.\n\n\nA revolver, from which two shots had been fired, laid on the ground next to the body. The corpse had a small piece of paper with the word \"TEETH\" hastily scrawled in what was later determined to be charcoal.\n\n\nFirst recorded SCP-3976 instance. As a result, it was investigated as a murder by local police and later Foundation forensic personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3976-5\n\n\nSeptember 22, 2007, Broad Chalke. A corpse was found in the back room of a local grocery.\n\n\nCorpse contained no visible signs of trauma, but forensic analysis determined that it contained high levels of arsenic.\n\n\nA sandwich with a bite taken out of it was found on the floor next to the corpse. In addition, a small golden ring was found in the sandwich.\n\n\nNews of the manifestation reached local media before Foundation intervention, requiring a medium-scale cover-up scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3976-11\n\n\nMarch 12, 2011, outside Templecombe. The corpse was found in an abandoned tool shed.\n\n\nCorpse was found with a chisel driven into its heart.\n\n\nA cell phone was found next to the corpse, with a contact list filled with various dentists. The window closest to the corpse had shattered outwards.\n\n\nA follow-up investigation into each of the dentists led to no further results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3976-18\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2018, Site 112. A corpse was found in the office of Dr. Sipai.\n\n\nCorpse was wearing a standard-issue Foundation lab coat, and had identification for one \"Dr. Christie\"\n3\n. Its skull cavity was found to be filled with teeth.\n\n\nA trail of muddy footprints leading into a solid wall was found adjacent to the body. The lab coat was found to have a toothbrush in one of its pockets. Security camera footage is missing from 01:23 to 1:25 on the day of the event.\n\n\nIn response to this event, all UK-based Foundation sites have been briefed on SCP-3976.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Christie died of natural causes in 1976.\n\n\n2\n. Christie's corpse was exhumed for comparison and control and has been confirmed to be a separate object from the manifested corpse. However, DNA analysis has shown that the copies are genetically identical to Christie's real corpse.\n\n\n3\n. The ID card was found to have valid level 2 clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3975\n | SCP-3976 | \nSCP-3978\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3976\n\" by junkmail-lt, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
