If you don't stop doing that I'm going to restrict your server access.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n We all know that's an empty threat, Vincent. The only person you've managed to lock out of \nSite-333\n's Scip.net is yourself.\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n By throwing your computer out the window.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n Okay, fair play.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n It literally \nis\n non-anamolous. You're all overreacting!\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n Noah, there is a hole in your fucking head.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Was! There \nwas\n a hole, they patched it up.\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n What is going on here?\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n \nSomeone\n paid to get a hole drilled in their head over the weekend.\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n Wait, is that why Noah's bald? And wearing all that gauze?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n It's called trepanning and it's a real medical procedure. Hang on, I'll find a picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Extraction of the Stone of Madness,\n Hieronymus Bosch, c.1450 \u20131516.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n That man is not a doctor.\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n I'm pretty sure that painting is supposed to be an allegory.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n Where did you even get this done anyway, Noah?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n There's a new place at the strip mall. Next to Tony's Pizzeria. It's the real deal. The guy who did it was Dr. John Clarke, he knew all about this stuff.\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n That man is not a doctor.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n I don't get why you're all giving me a hard time about this. I saw a billboard saying it could help with headaches, went in, got a hole drilled and filled, and here I am. It's an ancient medical practice, thousands of people have done this before.\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n Yeah, and all those people are dead now. You're not. That's what's anomalous.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Oh yeah? Well, are the pyramids anomalous? Stonehenge? The CN Tower? Just because things are old and we don't know how they work doesn't make them an anomaly!\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n Noah, all those things are anomalous \u2014 sure they were built using mundane methods, we do actually know how they built them \u2014 but they're literally all anomalous.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n What did it feel like anyways?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Well, it hurt for a little bit at the start, when they were pulling the skin back. They had put some sort of numbing cream on, but that kinda stopped helping when they brought out the drill. Damn that thing was loud.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n That next bit really hurt. It's kind of like, well it's hard to think of a comparison. Okay, have you ever seen construction workers drilling a hole in concrete? It's like that, but inside your head.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Then it felt \nreally\n good all of a sudden. Like, imagine how good a lake must feel when a dam bursts, and everything just rushes forward and your vision splinters into a thousand little fractals and somehow you can remember things you never could? Like being inside your mother's womb?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Then it hurt a lot, again. I blacked out and when I woke up they were stapling the skin back in place.\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n Hang-on, they were stapling, not stitching, your scalp back on?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Yeah, one of those office staplers; the doctor had it unfolded and was whacking it against my head.\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n Okay, I'm with Vincent. This isn't normal.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n I don't know, I'm kinda with Noah on this one. I mean, the human body can handle some crazy stuff. Who's to say this whole thing is not anomalous?\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Alright, enough Vincent. Yes I'm bald, and yes I have a hole in my head, but I'm not a bowling ball, okay? It wasn't funny the first time, it wasn't funny the sixth. Stop calling me that!\n\n\nLeonora Morales\n:\n What?\n\n\nVincent Bohart\n:\n I never typed that.\n\n\nTony Catalano\n:\n I'm sitting in the same room as him, he didn't even say that out loud.\n\n\nNoah Patel\n:\n Oh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVincent Bohart\n updated the Anomaly Classification System header:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7703\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\npending\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\n{$secondary-class}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7703\n\" by DodoDevil, Rounderhouse, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
