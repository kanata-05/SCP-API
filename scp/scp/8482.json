The glass box must remain locked and accessible only to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Handling SCP-8482 poses no inherent side effects; however, using the device by opening the LCD screen and capturing/recording a living being will trigger its anomalous properties and is strictly prohibited without prior authorization.\n\n\nSCP-8482's glass box can only be accessed with authorization form \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8482 is a silver Sony Handycam camcorder, model DCR-SR47, with no differences from other units of the same make and model. The battery on the camcorder is a non-OEM battery originating from an unknown manufacturing factory. When powered on and the LCD screen is flipped open, the device\u2019s battery life indicator displays \"\nINF\n,\" presumed to mean infinite battery life.\n\n\nSCP-8482's anomalous properties are observable when used to capture living beings. If the subject of the photograph/video is an abiotic object, the device functions as a non-anomalous camcorder, and the date metadata of the photograph/recording remains unchanged. However, when SCP-8482 is used to photograph/record a biotic being, the date metadata of the image changes to correspond with the date of that being's death.\n\n\nThe date displayed does not include a specific time, only the calendar date on which the subject is predicted to die. Rigorous testing of SCP-8482 has confirmed that the camcorder does not provide additional details of the predicted death.\n\n\nSCP-8482\u2019s origin and the mechanism through which it determines the date of death remain unknown.\n\n\nAddendum 1 - May 15, 2017:\n Per request of Site-\u2588\u2588's lead investigation officer Lance \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the finest personnel duo on site has been assigned the duties of testing SCP-8482's anomalous properties. Personnel John \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Parlo \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will be given a deadline of June 1, 2017 to document all testing records into Docket ID #\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum 2 - June 2, 2017:\n Photos of SCP-8482 are unable to updated due to an anomalous effect not anticipated by observers John \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Parlo \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-8482 has developed properties that actively erase all visual representations of itself across every known medium and format. At present, only three photographs of SCP-8482 exist, all taken prior to the testing conducted between May 15 and June 1, 2017.\n\n\nAddendum 3 - June 3, 2017:\n In a quick unofficial trial, two Class D personnel were given generic cameras to test whether SCP-8482 would affect photographs of identical model camcorders of itself. The trial results showed that SCP-8482 only affected visual representations of itself when the subject thought of it at the time of visually capturing it. As expected, identical camcorders could be taken photos of without issues.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Documents\u00a0001\u00a0-\u00a0060\u00a0Summary\u00a0|\u00a0Observers\u00a0John\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0and\u00a0Parlo\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 19, 2017\n\n\nDocument 001 - 010:\n Unicolor wall.

The effects could not be proven during testing. The subject reported high levels of stress when told about their predicted death day. John \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 subsequently sent the personnel back to their cell for minimal interference with testing.\n\n\nObserving Personnel Notes:\n\n\nJohn \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Anders reported extremely high levels of stress after being told about their death day.
