This lighting must be connected to multiple redundant power sources, and in case of total system failure, Mobile Task Force Eta-Seven is to be dispatched to assess the threat.\n\n\nSCP-363 is to be fed twenty (20) lab mice, administered once every forty-eight (48) hours.\n\n\nDescription:\n Ostensibly, SCP-363 are identical to \nScolopendra gigantea\n, or the Amazonian giant centipede. Dietary needs are identical, and DNA inspection has proven no dissimilarities to normal \nS. gigantea\n.\n\n\nSCP-363 is, under normal circumstances, the appropriate size for \nS. gigantea\n. In darkness, (darkness defined here as any level of light under 2 lux) which it actively seeks out, however, SCP-363 will grow rapidly and erratically, to sizes up to and exceeding 10\u00a0m x 2\u00a0m. SCP-363 does not retain the form of a centipede under these conditions. So far, reports have documented: proboscises, tentacles, highly elongated mandibles, an inconsistent number of eyes and legs, and, in one case, [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-363 will revert back to normal size and appearance after 2-3 hours of illumination of a level of at least 50 lux.\n\n\nSCP-363 will attack any animal emitting body heat, and appears to be able to detect and hunt in total darkness. It is assumed it uses other senses to hunt, with vision in a secondary position.\n\n\nReproductive cycle of SCP-363 is similar to that of normal \nS. gigantea\n, with one difference. Rather than in a cluster of leaves and dirt, eggs are laid and fertilized in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cavity of paralyzed [DATA EXPUNGED], followed by death.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Note from Dr. Skalder: \nWe've determined that fire seems to scare or ward off SCP-363. In light of this, we have equipped three of the members of MTF Eta-Seven, \"Creepy Crawlies\", with military-issue M2A1-7 flamethrowers.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n Incident report of breach.\n\n\n\n\nDocument# 363-Alpha: Breach 1\n\n\nPersonnel involved:\n MTF-Eta-7\n\n\nDate: 21-5-2003\n\n\nLocation: Site-\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription: Attempted retrieval of SCP-363 specimen during power failure/containment breach.\n\n\n<Start of audio log>\n\n\nMTF Eta-7 Commander Johnson:\n Perts, any word from Technical on (\ndistortion\n) cameras?\n\n\nContactsman Perts:\n No dice, commander.
