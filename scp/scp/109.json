It should not be removed from the unit except to be transported to a research facility, and then only by personnel with Level 3 security clearance or higher. When replacing SCP-109, personnel should ensure that it is firmly closed and that it is placed on the molded pedestal in the upright position.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-109 is a standard-issue United States Army canteen (circa 1899) made of a tin alloy and fitted with a heavy cotton cover and a black leather strap. When opened, the item is seen to be nearly full of water. A seemingly unlimited amount of water can be removed from the container without changing the water level or the item's mass, which remains a constant 3.16\u00a0kg. Probes of the interior of the container reported an estimated volume of 2.8\u00a0L and a shape consistent with the outside.\n\n\nThe water in SCP-109 is of a slight blue-gray tint, with concentrations of 20 ppm of tin and 170 ppm of other electrolytes. The water remains at a constant temperature of 19\u00b0C but can be heated or cooled when moved to another container.\n\n\nAddendum 109-1:\n Upon the item's delivery to Site-19, it was given the object class of Safe. As tests were conducted on the item, uncertainty surrounding test results prompted Gen. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to upgrade the object class to Euclid.\n\n\nAddendum 109-2:\n Recently, a request was filed and granted by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for permission to water an okra plant growing in his office with SCP-109. Staff should be notified that Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 uses SCP-109 for this purpose for a small time every Friday.\n\n\nAddendum 109-3:\n \n\"It has come to my attention that new Class D personnel are often dared to empty the bottle. Guards are reminded that they are to discourage such activity, and inform them that SCP-109 is bottomless. Chanting 'Chug!' repeatedly is considered unprofessional.\"\n \u2014 Dr. Klein\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n Due to the range of tests conducted on SCP-109, this section has been provided to present test results in chronological order. Dates have been withheld for confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\nTEST 1:\n Subjects imbibed water from SCP-109, reported that it was very refreshing and, despite the metal content, very tasty. Urine samples from subjects were normal.\n\n\nTEST 2:\n Follow-up test to TEST 1 had subjects dehydrate themselves for 1 full day before imbibing water from SCP-109. Test remains unfinished as subjects were unable to provide urine samples.\n\n\nTEST 3:\n Subject bathed in water from SCP-109. Subject reported increased energy and a much improved complexion following the bath.\n\n\nTEST 4:\n Streptococcus bacteria cultured in water from SCP-109 thrived and multiplied quickly. Water from SCP-109 administered to subject suffering from streptococcal infection killed nearly all bacteria and produced a full recovery within 24 hours.\n\n\nTEST 5:\n Blood substitute created using water from SCP-109, given in transfusion to pedestrian hit by a drunk driver. Subject showed no malign symptoms from the transfusion and made a full recovery. Subject's physical therapy concluded six weeks early.\n\n\nTEST 6:\n Water from SCP-109 administered to various plant organisms, all of which remained very healthy and showed no malign symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne proposition for a test which has been discussed for some time has been one involving a combination of SCP-109 and \nSCP-402\n. Due to the risk of losing one or both items or creating a hazardous situation, this test has never been conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-108\n | SCP-109 | \nSCP-110\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-109\n\" by Kain Pathos Crow, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
