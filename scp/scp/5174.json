Instances of SCP-5174-1 are to be stored in standard object containment once decommissioned.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-5174 is a brain-based bot network that is intended to terminate selected hosts in \nOneiroi\n Space\n1\n.\n\n\nThe mechanism of SCP-5174 involves the involuntary exploitation of \"non-dreamers,\" in order to create a specific desired effect; of which the most common are tasks that require significant cognitive function to process.\n\n\nNote that victims of SCP-5174 are not actually accessing Oneiori dream worlds (such a process requires the completion of the Oneiori Joining Technique), rather their mental energy\n2\n is rerouted to a central attacker who then focuses on a Oneiorific node.\n\n\nThe transmission method of SCP-5174 is an autonomous drone (refered to as SCP-5174-1) which emits malicious, infected brainwaves to physically compromised individuals.\n\n\nThe combined mental energy is then collated through SCP-5174-1 which then prepares SCP-5174 for activation. The amount of \"non-dreamers\" that are used for SCP-5174 is limited to the spatial distribution of SCP-5174-1 for that particular instance.\n\n\nIn Oneiroi Space, the botnet manifests in several ways, the most common of which is as millions of SCP Foundation Researchers armed with glitter-guns. The intense cerebral load placed, often, kills the host of the collective and causes critical infrastructure loss for the dream group\n3\n of that particular host.\n\n\nIt is theorized that multiple varieties of SCP-5174 currently operate within Oneiori Space. However, the development of mobile collectives and \"jumping\" hosts within the noosphere in recent decades has made precise identification difficult.\n\n\nThe first and most widespread variation known in Oneiori West\n4\n as the \"TFFS\n5\n brain parasite,\" was dismantled in 2018.\n\n\nBefore deconstruction, the first instance of SCP-5174 is believed to have killed 38 hosts and their associated collectives.\n\n\nThe following is an abridged list of dreamworlds destroyed by this initial version of SCP-5174.\n\n\n\n\nHost Name\n: Imperator Aiaoai Zurchol Oiiit\n\n\nHivemind Name\n: The Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East\n\n\nHuman Population #:\n ~15,000,000\n\n\nPhysical Location\n: Within a trashcan on the beach of Random Island, Canada\n\n\nMetaphysical Description\n: \u201cThe Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East\u201d was a uber-fantasy, low-concept hivemind that was the sister collective to Oneiroi West. Investigation showed that most of this particular collective was constructed of and worshipped the Daevite spirit \"\nHahgwehdaetgan\n.\n\n\nCircumstances Regarding Collapse\n: Imperator Oiiit, the host of \u201cThe Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East,\u201d received a message on 3/1/2018 detailing steps of an ultimatum to either shut down operations or to face complete destruction.\n\n\nAccording to after action reports, the ultimatum was attached to a manifesto describing the \"cowardice of death\" and \"the strength of 'real' flesh.\"\n\n\nOiit ignored the message and later that day the collective was shutdown by SCP-5174.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost Name\n: Real Name Unknown\n\n\nHivemind Name\n: AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH (12\u00a0A's, 6 U's, 5\u00a0H's)\n\n\nHuman Population #:\n ~???\n\n\nPhysical Location\n: Variable. The location of the hivemind would change depending on the visitor. The location would jump to the visitor's mother's brain.\n\n\nMetaphysical Description\n: \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH\u201d was an indetermined, high-concept collective that would alter itself depending on the mind that would enter it. The space within the collective would transform into a space resembling the inhabitant\u2019s childhood. Infamous as a hideout for Daevite pacifists during the Third Occult War.\n\n\nCircumstances Regarding Collapse\n: Real Name Unknown, the host of \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH,\u201d was sent a similar ultimatum by SCP-5174.\n\n\nThe attached manifesto was slightly altered and contained reference to \"the unnatural lengthened lives led by dreamers who hang to their pasts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost Name\n: SCP Foundation Dreamer Azmaray Marwat\n\n\nHivemind Name\n: Sanctioned Site \u221a-2\n\n\nHuman Population #:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nPhysical Location\n: Site-02\n\n\nMetaphysical Description\n: Semi-infinite pink containment planet, often used for non-humanoid mental viruses. For more details, contact Foundation Dreamer Overseer Maider Berezi.\n\n\nCircumstances Regarding Collapse\n: Marwat received a message from SCP-5174, calling for help in their mission to \"kill and destroy everything within all dream-worlds for the benefit of those tempted by its whispers and false bodies. None shall escape physical form.\"\n\n\nAfter Marwat responded with a reaffirmation of Foundation ideology to not harm anomalous entities, SCP-5174 invaded Site \u221a-2 and collapsed the planet.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n: SCP-5174 was brought to the Foundation's attention by the \"All Being\u2019s Collective of \nXiupania\n,\" which sent envoys into the dreams of various Foundation researchers. The message was the following pseudo-limerick.\n\n\n\n\nYou are always a bad group.\n\nBut we need some help, nincompoops!\n\nAn evil thing has come.\n\nAnd will cause us to succumb.\n\nHey dumbass, you will find the culprit in Guadeloupe.\n\n\n\n\nA team of Foundation security personnel was sent to Basse-Terre, the capital city of Guadeloupe. There it was discovered the brains of patients admitted to Vieux Habitants National Hospital were compromised by SCP-5174 and were being co-opted for the purposes of the central brain. The compromised individuals were de-anomalized through a severing of the forced Oneiorific connection.\n\n\nDuring the dismantling of the first SCP-5174 network, a document was found taped to a computer monitor.\n\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED LETTER: DO NOT DISCARD\n\n\nDear \nKarcist Tuuslar\n,\n\n\nThank you for ordering from our organization!
