A cover story of an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) has been implemented in case any proof of the incident remains.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4991 was a period between April 7th, 2016 and April 9th, 2016, when major social networking websites such as 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr, and Twitter began creating posts that referenced non-existent events. During this time, users were met with errors that hindered their ability to post. All posts that were created during this period were made by existing accounts.\n\n\nTwo days after SCP-4991's manifestation, all anomalous activity ceased, and users could interact with the websites normally. By a vote of 11 to 1, the O5 Council reclassified SCP-4991 as Neutralized, and the current containment procedures were established. No anomalous activity similar to SCP-4991 has been detected since the incident.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4991.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4991 was discovered early in the morning on April 7th after Foundation operatives were alerted to most social networking websites being inaccessible, and users reported posts appearing that they were not making. Upon order of the Council of the United, all of these websites were shut down, and a viral Class-K Amnestic was released following SCP-4991's demanifestation.\n\n\nThe following are examples of posts made during SCP-4991.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Twitter\u00a0Records\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0THEY\u00a0WILL\u00a0EVOLVE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald J.

The Secure-Ment Plan would cost them a shit ton of fucking money, so much that it might put them out of business forever. It seems they have a \"I'd rather die than pay this\" mentality right now, unless we're missing something.\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\u2013]\n \nMoonboundShibe\n \n2705 points 1 day ago\n\n\nI'm a bit mad, but I think I know why they aren't doing ths. I am like 99% certain that because of the recent uprising in Egypt, the Secure-Ment plan would fuck over most villages around the Middle East-ish area, which would probably cause more harm than good. Probably.\n\n\nIt makes sense, but it's still a dick move.\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's up with the \"Secure-ment Plan\" and the SCP Foundation?\n\n\nsubmitted 49 minutes ago by\n \nPlaguebub\n\n\n47 comments\n \nshare\n \nsave\n \nhide\n \ngive gold\n \nreport\n \ncrosspost\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n983\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\u2013]\n \nbigFATbirbs\n \n132 points 39 minutes ago\n\n\nEssentially, it was an agreement between the US Government and the SCP Foundation in order to reduce the amount of bugs that are currently flying everywhere. It would require the budget from several large nations, and would consist of the deployment of several specifically engineered pesticides in order to kill these bugs en masse. The plan required the SCP Foundation to use around 90% of their budget, due to the fact that these pesticides are hell to make.\n\n\nFor some reason, The SCP Foundation, a couple days ago, after stepping out of the agreement, completely disappeared. Everyone associated with them completely vanished, and all of their sites are completely empty. The production of the pesticides were put on hold, and now the bug population has increased tenfold.\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaw a beautiful flock of birds fly over my town!\n\n\nsubmitted 12 minutes ago by\n \nEdwardscissortoes\n\n\n47 comments\n \nshare\n \nsave\n \nhide\n \ngive gold\n \nreport\n \ncrosspost\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\u2013]\n \nthe_ok_hippo\n \n[score hidden] 10 minutes ago\n\n\nDude, those aren't birds.\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Tumblr\u00a0Records\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0NARROW\u00a0ARE\u00a0THE\u00a0MINDS\u00a0OF\u00a0HUMANS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanxiety2721\n does not match any existing user name\n\n\nanxiety2721\n\n\n\n\nfollow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni managed to catch one of the bugs. don't let them into your mouth tho they love to crawl in there.\n\n\nit was actually pretty easy to catch them. i just opened the door and threw a net and brought it back in\n\n\n53.615 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexplosions_in_the_sky\n does not match any existing user name\n\n\nexplosions_in_the_sky\n\n\n\n\nfollow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm in Edswardville, Virginia.
