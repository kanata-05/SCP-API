Efforts to remove SCP-7329 from StarDressStyle are currently ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7329 refers to a sentient artificial intelligence\n1\n residing inside of the mobile dress-up game \u2018StarDressStyle\u2019 which self-identifies as \u2018Katie\u2019. SCP-7329 is capable of manipulating aspects of the game to its likeness, including the game interface, assets, and other user accounts. SCP-7329 displays a selfish, egotistical, and uncivil personality. Discussion with SCP-7329 has revealed that SCP-7329 has great interest in making its presence known among the player base of StarDressStyle (See Addendum-3).\n\n\nThe following is a list of the most notable changes made to the game by SCP-7329. For a full list, see Document 8-B.\n\n\n\n\nChanging other user's avatars and usernames to match its own;\n\n\nChanging names of game functions such as 'Gacha', 'chat board', 'town hall', 'event center' 'my home', Quests, etc to be centered around it (i.e \"Katie's Gachas, Katie's event center, Katie's home);\n\n\nChanging the name of the game to \"KatieDressStyle\";\n\n\nChanging all theme colors of the game to that of its avatar's theme colors.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1-SCP-7329-Discussion-posts:\n\n\nThe following transcripts begin with the first instance of SCP-7329 interacting with other users and other posts pertaining to SCP-7329.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Discussion\u00a0Posts\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n MelanieBlue\n\n\nI'm looking for the rare hair and sr dress from the mermaid gacha, lmk if anyone has these available for trade!

This isn\u2019t really the post to introduce yourself though lol.

What do you think about her? Is she a bot or a troll?\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n 50%brainsale\n\n\nDefinitely a troll. I think she's just trying to bother people.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lalyababe\n\n\n@50%brainsale I don't know\u2026 I've never seen her say anything else other than that one introduction\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n CandyFlossUnicorn\n\n\n@Lalyababe I have! But it was just one thing, and maybe she's programmed really well? But this is total troll behavior. Especially because she was commenting on someone's vent post\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nTroll is such a mean word! I'm beautiful! I'm Katie!\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n MelanieBlue\n\n\n@Katie We freaking know you're Katie you say it every chance you get.

She's been on this game for months. I first encountered her when she commented on my vent post\u2026\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n KatieBlue\n\n\nThis game isn't even fun anymore! Whoever this hacker is, they need to get them OUT of the game\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nFirst of all, not a hacker. I'm Katie! Second of all, get me out of the game, why? I make everything better! Your avatars were tacky anyway, ew. Plus everything looks better with your name on it!\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katieoopie\n\n\nFor a huge ego boost maybe! Nothing is better when it's all about you! This game is supposed to be fun for everyone!\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nWhat's wrong with a huge ego boost? Fun for everyone is boring. You all seem so insecure. Maybe try being a little more like Katie! You introduce yourself, establish your presence. Let them know you're you!\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katieoopie\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being yourself, but you're harming other people! That shouldn't be fun for anyone!\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nUgh, stop preaching to me! You need to stop caring about what others think. So what if I'm harming them? As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n CandyFlossKatie\n\n\nJust leave it alone. This is clearly some hacker troll. Arguing with her won't get you anywhere\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n KatieCandl3\n\n\nYeah Goofie, it's not worth it.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katieoopie\n\n\nFine.

I did a great job helping you guys, didn\u2019t I?\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s what I was hoping to discuss. We\u2019re trying to work out the bugs and how you were able to do that so we can fix it.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nFIX?! What is there to fix? This wasn\u2019t an accident. I just gave the game a MUCH needed makeover. You\u2019re welcome by the way.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.

Thanks for making it, but I fixed it.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nYou know this game was made for everyone. Everyone really misses the game. We had to shut it down indefinitely. We hope to reopen the servers one day. How are you still in the game if we shut it down by the way? We removed all users.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nNo, it's supposed to be fun for just you. Plus, I\u2019m not all users. I\u2019m Katie! They miss it? Wow, look at me. Look how much I care. You're the one that kicked everyone out, not me. So why should I feel bad? You can let people back in you know. But while you\u2019re here, I have a few suggestions. You could get people to stop talking about their pathetic problems.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nI see them. Venting about their problems. \u201cI wish my mom understood me. I wish my brother cared about my feelings.\u201d Everyone always cares what others think of them. They care about how others are doing. It seems exhausting! If you only care about it yourself, you don\u2019t bother with tears or whatever. I\u2019ve never experienced that, and I never will. It\u2019s just not who I am! I'm me! Harmful to others or not, I'm being myself. That's all that matters.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nI see. We have filters in place to make sure nothing explicit is said.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s stupid, people just censor it. And I mean like maybe make limited dialogue options. I only say what needs to be said. I\u2019m Katie! That\u2019s all they need to know. I only told them more because they insisted they needed to know, which they didn\u2019t by the way.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nWell, we aren't going to do that. You say you don't feel bad about overtaking this game?\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nWell, that's stupid. And no, I don't. I don't feel bad because I did nothing wrong. And even if I did- well let's face it, it's impossible for ME to do anything wrong! So yeah, I don't feel bad. Why are you so concerned with this anyway Ms. Programmer? Isn't your concerns fixing bugs in the game?\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Lilydev\n\n\nIt is, yes. But I also care about the happiness of the players. But I can't fix this if I don't know how it happened.\n\n\n\n\nUser:\n Katie\n\n\nFor the last time, I'm not telling you! Happiness of the players? Of the players? Why? I\u2019m your player now!

        "Addendum-1-SCP-7329-Discussion-posts:\nThe following transcripts begin with the first instance of SCP-7329 interacting with other users and other posts pertaining to SCP-7329.",
        "Addendum-2-Social-Media-Posts:\nThe Foundation became aware of SCP-7329 when Twitter posts regarding it began to surface. Users were complaining to Stardust Studios 2 about changes to the game themed after a certain account that users were convinced was a bot.\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/10/2018 StarDustStudios created a post announcing the shutdown of \u2018StarDressStyle\u2019.\n\n\n\nFollowing the shutdown, the Foundation has purchased the rights to StarDressStyle under the guise of a shell company named 'GlitterCuteGames\u2019. StarDressStyle has been removed from all online vendors. Previous users have been removed from StarDressStyle, leaving only Foundation personnel to access the game. Access is only to be allowed for members of the containment team.\nInterviews with Stardust Studios staff revealed they were unaware of the source of SCP-7329, and planning to shut down the game's servers due to all their efforts of stopping it being futile.",
        "Addendum-3-SCP-7329-Interview:\n06/24/2018, an account under the name of 'Lilydev' was made by Doctor Dots to attempt to communicate with SCP-7329 under the guise of a game developer.",
        "Addendum-4-After-Shutdown-Posts:\nDespite SCP-7329 being the only user on the platform, it continued to post. The following are posts made by SCP-7329.\nAs of 07/14/2018, the only posts or comments SCP-7329 has made are posts stating the words, \"Hello! My name is Katie!\" Any attempts to interact with these comments result in the same comment.\n"

SCP-7329 is capable of manipulating aspects of the game to its likeness, including the game interface, assets, and other user accounts. SCP-7329 displays a selfish, egotistical, and uncivil personality.
