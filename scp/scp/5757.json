Video output by SCP-5757-A is subject to algorithmic monitoring in order to ensure its accuracy.\n\n\nWildlife agents have secured the perimeter of the Everglades Agricultural Area C-139 Annex with unauthorized persons being refused access under the guise of ongoing restoration work.\n\n\nAny attempt by SCP-5757-affected individuals enthralled by them to exit the C-139 Annex are to be repelled; lethal force is authorized for these efforts.\n\n\nAttempts to recover those affected by SCP-5757 have been discontinued. Lethal force is authorized to enact these procedures, if that becomes necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5757-A is the data for an unreleased and unfinished piece of software. Entitled \"Curse of the Everglade\" it is written with the \nICRDTA\n programming language and is only compatible with original Atari Jaguar hardware.\n\n\nThe game world of SCP-5757 appears to correlate directly to approximately 15,000 acres of land within an Everglades Agricultural Area, hereafter referred to as SCP-5757-B. Actions taken within SCP-5757's game space can and will change the physical landscape, topography, and population of SCP-5757.\n\n\nAny sentient or sapient entities within SCP-5757-B, including humans, will be represented as spherical sprites by SCP-5757-A. Within the game space there is a persistent text bubble displayed above any human-representing sprites, giving information on their status, mood, and occasionally brief transcripts of their vocalizations.\n\n\nHowever, to date, it has proven impossible to play SCP-5757-A directly through the console - instead, it is believed that the game is played remotely by the first individual to gain physical access to SCP-5757-B with knowledge of its connection to SCP-5757-A.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5757-G:\n Supplemental Documentation\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Curse of the Everglade game manual\n\n\n\n\nSociety is ending\u2026\n\nDarkness falling over our cities\u2026\n\nEverglade, mankind's last bastion, is the place for rebuilding civilization!\n\nGather resources, fight fearsome wildlife, and brave the ever-changing jungle!\n\nThe future is up for grabs\u2026 can \nyou\n become the Jaguar King?\n\n\nWell, what else are you doing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Document\u00a0Arcadia-X\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nThe following information was also enclosed with the manual:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \nArcadia\n, we're doing more than satisfying every holey bit where your craving is laying.

Agent Decourcey: One Quarter Junkie, Quebec, uniform, alfa, romeo, tango, echo, romeo\u2026 Agent Davie: ( Interrupting ) Checking in, and Decourcey I'm very proud that you can remember your phonetic alphabet. Agent Jesup: Jesup, checking in. Apparently I'm the only one who can remember his name. HQ: Roger. We hear you all loud and clear. Agent Davie: What's the game showing, command? HQ: You should be clear to proceed with caution. ( Approximately fifteen minutes of silence ) Agent Lent: Careful, Decs. Surprise keeps us alive. Agent Decourcey: Sorry. Didn't see the branch in all the river grass. You think they heard anything? Agent Davie: Command, how's our target looking? Still sitting pretty? HQ: No behavior changes. They still appear to be building. Agent Jesup: Stop. Davey, there's a weird bug on your shoulder. Agent Lent: Squash it. We're going to have to get this stuff dry-cleaned anyhow. Agent Jesup: Squashed. Let's go. ( Approximately one hour of silence ) Agent Lent: Command, we've got a problem. We're at the point, but not seeing any targets. Agent Jesup: Doesn't look like anyone's been here in a hundred, two hundred years. Agent Decourcey: Very scientific. Agent Jesup: Bite me, Decs. I'm trying here. Agent Lent: Shut up. Command, what are you seeing? HQ: You should be able to see their position. What are you seeing? Agent Decourcey: Mangroves, cypress trees, cypress knees, an orchid here, lot of mosquito. Expected fauna, no signs of habitation. Agent Lent: Wait, where's Davie? HQ: Davie, check in. ( Silence ) Agent Lent: Dang it. Dang it. Shit. Fuck. Pull back, this isn't good. Agent Jesup: We have to stay. Agent Lent: Jesps, what're you- Agent Decourcey: We have to stay. <End Log> Radio communications temporarily disabled, cause unknown.",
        "<Begin Log> (Agent Lent enters into an unknown structure within SCP-5757-B. Agents Decourcey, Davie, and Jesup are escorting, all are believed to be affected by SCP-5757.) Subject 5757-1: Bring me the buzzard bait. I wish to parlay with its masters. Agent Lent: Hello Kurt. You- Subject 5757-1: (interrupting) Your information is out of date. Address me as the Jaguar King. (Pause.) Agent Lent: \u2026right. Well, Jaguar King. You want to talk about\u2026 your swamp? Subject 5757-1: You're very arrogant to - Agent Decourcey: (interrupting) - come into my kingdom - Agent Davie: (interrupting) - and make assumptions. (Pause.) Agent Lent: Neat trick. Subject 5757-1: (shouting) No! Agent Jesup: It isn't a some party trick. All Subjects: ( In unison ) Respect in the power of the Jaguar King. Subject 5757-1: Prostrate yourself. (Pause.) Agent Lent: I'll pass. SCP-5757-1: Worm. Shut your mouth. You're not to speak unless spoken to. Agent Jesup: In here, you do what I want, better than you could ever do on your own\u2026 Agent Decourcey: \u2026so what was the point of you even being born outside at all? (Pause.) Agent Lent: That's a big question - I'm not really equipped to answer it. Doesn't make any sense, anyhow. None of this does. Subject 5757-1: I - Agent Lent: (interrupting) These are good boys you've got here, Kurt. Let 'em go, and maybe we can all walk out of here on two feet. (Pause.) (All Subjects begin laughing, continuing for ten seconds before suddenly stopping.) Subject 5757-1: You think so? As if this unit means anything to me. Go ahead. Take a gun and, and, shoot me in the head! See if I care. Agent Lent: I have to admit, it'd be satisfying. But we've still got a mission to do. Agent Decourcey: Oh, I see, I see. Agent Davie: I see. Agent Jesup: I see. Subject 5757-1: I see. What a noble sacrifice. Useless? Also boring. If you've got nothing to parlay, then you'll have to go. Even if you shot everyone here, it's not like this is all I have at my disposal. Did you think that I was that stupid? Agent Lent: Is that a no? Subject 5757-1: Of course I'm not that stupid! Agent Lent: No - my offer. Is that a no? Think carefully. (Pause.) Subject 5757-1: (quietly) Of course it's a no, you stupid shit. Agent Lent: Alright. (Target beacon activates) Eat shell, you sonofabitch. Subject 5757-1: You don't scare- (Feed cuts out.) <End Log> Artillery strike was successfully executed against SCP-5757-B. All Subjects were designated as neutralized. Agent Lent posthumously given the Foundation Star.",
