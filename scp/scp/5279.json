SCP-5279-2 objects produced by SCP-5279-1 are to be destroyed via the use of an incinerator interconnected to SCP-5279-1 if they are deemed untranslatable, if they are translatable they will be transferred to the Foundation Lingual Department for deciphering. Websites are to be monitored for any mention of SCP-5279-2 like documents, which will be dealt with if necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5279-1 is a UX-300 Fax Machine that periodically prints pieces of paper (SCP-5279-2). The vast majority of SCP-5279-2 objects are blank, incomprehensible, or torn apart. However, a small percentage of objects are semi-comprehensible, written in a mix of early Anglo-Frisian and Anglo-Saxon\n1\n. SCP-5279-1 is assumed to be from an alternate universe, due to the contents of SCP-5279-2 documents. No signal is sent to SCP-5279-1 before a document is printed. SCP-5279-1 is able to function without internet access, power, or parts essential to the function of a normal non-anomalous UX-300 Fax Machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-A-1\n\n\nAddendum-A-2\n\n\nAddendum-A-3\n\n\nAddendum-A-4\n\n\nAddendum-A-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5279-1 (along with 67 SCP-5279-2 documents) was discovered in an abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 product manufacturing facility in Hastings, the United Kingdom, on 11/16/2011. The facility in question is coincidentally located where a Anglo-Saxon era church was once located according to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 tapestry.\n\n\nAs the facility was shut down on 05/09/2006, it can be presumed that SCP-5279 was left uncontained for over 5 years. SCP-5279 was brought to the Foundation\u2019s attention when reports of SCP-5279 incidents began to appear on the Internet, gaining an almost mythlike status in the suburb of St Leonards among younger residents. Due to the large period in which SCP-5279 was uncontained, it can be assumed that copies of SCP-5279-2 may have been taken from the building. The following addendums include 4 of the most distinct SCP-5279-2 documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Title:\n N/A\n\n\nAnomalous:\n No\n\n\nDescription:\n A partially written letter addressed to a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588, who at the time, was the mayor of Hastings. The letter seems to be talking of a celebration of an anniversary.

This is because of (\nthe\n) presence of \neye-snatchers\n4\n in the local realm. Though the council has passed the legislature with no votes against, it is the mayor that must make the final decision in accordance with the 1908 decree of Edith the Fifth. It is of the utmost importance that you, with your power in the mayoral position, which was handed to you by your late father, make the decision to call off all celebrations. Though Victory-Day is a pride to the people of the \nvictorious city of Hastings\n, safety is our utmost priority. \nWe must cancel the event outright, we have next year for a celebration\n5\n.\n Let us work with marshal officials to end the threat of eye-snatchers and other abominations before we carry on, the king will be in attendance and he must be safe.\n\n\n\n\nThe following members of the council agree with me on this point, their signatures are below:\n\n(Section cut for brevity)\n\n\n\n\nEND OF ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Title:\n \u16c8\u16da\u16c1\u16cb\u16c4\u16d6 \u16b1\u16d6\u16c8\u16a9 10/03/2005 (\nlit. translation \"Marshal Reports 10/03/2005\"\n)\n\n\nAnomalous:\n No\n\n\nDescription:\n A police report dated 10/03/2005.

The other 2 children are unable to talk due to shock, and still refused to at the time of the last check-in by the marshal section (10/02/2005), however, the children did lead marshals to the area of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage mentioned in report #1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/30/2005\n\nEvents: Resident \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 found in abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588 storage facility. \u2588\u2588\u2588 was missing his jugular, teeth (excluding the canines), genitalia, and eyes.

Remember your training and keep your heads held steady. (8:12)\n\n\nMarshal Stone:\n Yes sir. (Said in unison with Marshal Godwin, 8:12)\n\n\nMarshal Godwin:\n Yes sir. (8:12)\n\n\n(Men descend silently until 8:14, assumed to be around 3/4th of the way down the well.)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller:\n We are nearing the nest mouth, section officer. There appears to be no water\u2026notably, there are red stains upon the mouth walls, common in eye-snatcher nests. (8:14)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller:\n The throat of the nest has been spotted. It is of great size, around 1 elne in height, and 3 feet in width. Team commencing raid now. (8:15)\n\n\nMassacre\n\n\n8:16-8:30PM\n\n(Men enter the \u201cthroat\u201d of the nest, assumed to be a hole in the walls of the well. They do not speak for over 4 minutes as they traverse the throat, either due to interference, or to not alert any \u201ceye-snatchers\u201d. Eventually the silence is broken by Marshal Fuller, shaken at the large amount of eyes they have come across.)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller:\n By god. So many eyes. I cannot find an area where I am not watched by the stolen pearls. This is not normal section officer, we have only just entered the throat. There should be a complete lack of stolen orbs until at least the stomach is reached. (8:16)\n\n\n(Group continues, occasionally speaking, this will be cut out for brevity. After 4 minutes of descent, Marshal Stone reports movement.)\n\n\nMarshal Stone:\n Fuller. Movement ahead, abomination? (8:20)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller:\n Impossible. We have walked now, only 10 minutes. Not once in my 20 years of nest raids have I seen a snatcher this far up. (8:20)\n\n\nMarshal Stone:\n But sir, I swear- (8:20)\n\n\nMarshal Godwin:\n Silence yourself. You are seeing things, it happens to recruits. (8:21)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller:\n I recommend you listen to Godwin. (8:21)\n\n\nMarshal Stone:\n Understood. Apologies sir.\n\n\n(Descent continues for another 6 minutes before another notable event occurs in the \u201cStomach\u201d of the nest. It is assumed that the team has spotted an \u201ceye-snatcher\u201d.)\n\n\nMarshal Stone\n: Sir. Ahead. (8:27)\n\n\nMarshal Fuller\n: What? This isn\u2019t normal. Fire upon it Stone.\n\n\n(Marshal Stone is assumed to have fired upon the \u201ceye-snatcher\u201d. The audio becomes \u201cincomprehensible\u201d according to the transcript writer.

They are watching me as I write this. They aren\u2019t just eyes they must be connected to one of those vile beasts. I hear them move every few minutes, I saw one too. It was above me, its head melting through my ceiling. I know they\u2019re outside, I still hear screaming on occasion from one of their victims. I know I\u2019m safer inside than out.\n\nI know this idea to be incredibly foolish, due to the large-scale attack by the abominations, but I have decided to contact the marshal's office and mayoral office via fax. This is my last call for help.\n\nI feel the eyes moving in my skin.\n\nI feel my own eyes attempting to push themselves from my head.\n\nAnd I feel the hot breath of a snatcher right behind me on my neck.\n\nHelp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober, 13th\n\n\n\n\nMy fingers disappeared today, yet I still feel them tapping away at my keyboard as I write this. But I have no keyboard, I am using my invisible fingers to write on my invisible keyboard. They\u2019re everywhere I look now, I can feel them boring into my skin, creating new orifices every few minutes yet I feel no pain. There is a pile of eyes around a foot high on the ground, they writhe around as if they\u2019re alive, and at this point, I\u2019m convinced they are. I tried leaving the room, only to find a wall made of snatchers. They didn\u2019t do anything but stand in place and stare at me. My windows are blocked in a similar way. Things continued to disappear but I know they are still present, like my bed, which I lay down on still, causing me to float. During the small period of time in which I was able to sleep the snatchers whispered indescribable things to me.\n\nI know I\u2019m talking to no one.\n\nI know that everything is over.\n\nBut if anyone is reading this, please.\n\nHelp me.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nEyes: Gone\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen: Gone\n\n\n\nOutside: Black\n\n\n\n\nArms: Gone\n\n\n\n\n\nFeet: Gone\n\nEverything: Gone\n\nDeath: neverarriving\n\n\n\n\nHowamievenwritinghowamievenwringthisahowhowmabuevwnwritnhhowhowhowhowhowhowbwothisishellthisishellhelphellhelphellphellhelp\n\nHelphelphelphphelphelphelphelphelphelphelplphekplpehlpehlpehlepgelnshsshHelphelp\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This continues for another 25 pages)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5279 is assumed to have warped into our universe during or after this event.
