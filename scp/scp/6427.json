The full extent of its abilities is currently unknown, but it is believed that SCP-6427 is capable of teleportation, abnormal feats of strength, and enhanced agility.\n4\n\n\nSCP-6427 appears to be a pale grey creature approximately 3 meters tall.\n5\n\n\nSCP-6427 possesses irregular body proportions, with some appendages extending over 2 meters further than others.\n6\n\n\nSCP-6427 possesses mild antimemetic properties, which it theoretically uses in order to avoid description.\n7\n\n\nSCP-6427 was discovered after sightings of a hostile force inside Site-324 were confirmed on 12/10/2021. The entity proceeded to engage several members of Site Security, ultimately overpowering them and turning towards nearby personnel.\n8\n\n\nThe entity materialized inside Junior Researcher Michaels' living quarters at approximately 3:56 AM\n9\n and was subsequently restrained accidentally by a file describing it\n10\n, which Michaels had made in an attempt to communicate with any available member of site staff.\n11\n\n\nSCP-6427 is thought to possess an aversion to written descriptions of it, which render it inert.\n12\n\n\nWhen SCP-6427 is actively described in a document, it assumes a fetal position, although a pause longer than a second restores its ability to move.\n13\n\n\n\n\nAlthough SCP-6427 could remain contained indefinitely\n14\n by describing it, this method of containment is unfeasible, in part due to th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[LAST ACTIVE: 560 MINUTES AGO.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PAGE LOCK EXPIRED.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. pending approval.\n\n\n2\n. pending approval.\n\n\n3\n.

As if anyone could describe a single creature for long, especially at this hour. Also: Double-check the meaning of antimemetic later.\n\n\n8\n. This is probably off tone, hopefully, I'll be able to fix it later.\n\n\n9\n. Bastard. \nREMOVE THIS LATER\n\n\n10\n. A miracle, if you take into account the battery left on my laptop.\n\n\n11\n. I will never thank orientation enough after this. We all laughed at \"If you see an entity lunging at you, use your last breath to document it\", but I guess it's not always about being part of an undercover meat grinder with these people.\n\n\n12\n. Verbal descriptions and video logs seem to have no effect since the entity did not stop until I wrote its designation.\n\n\n13\n. Note: I was willing to risk it for science.
