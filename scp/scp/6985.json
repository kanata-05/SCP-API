All advertisements featuring SCP-6985, whether digital or physical, are to be hidden from public eye by any means available. Recovered instances of SCP-6985 are to be stored in a large glass case imbued with insect repellent within Site-19.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6985 is the designation for an unmarked, bright pink spherical object attached to a small round stump approximately the size of a bowling ball. The entirety of SCP-6985 is rounded and smooth, crafted out of an unknown, soft and slightly adhesive material. Attached to a hole in the top of the object is a removable neon tag that reads 'The anti-spider!' in large bold letters.\n\n\nOn 07/7/21, instances of SCP-6985 started spontaneously appearing within the homes of hundreds of seemingly random individuals. Later tests show these individuals all suffer from mild to severe arachnophobia.\n1\n About three days prior to this event, multiple advertisements and pieces of media surrounding SCP-6985 began revealing themselves, visible only to those suffering from arachnophobia. After 07/7/21, they proceeded to become perceivable to all. The individuals who received SCP-6985 had varying reactions, ranging from uneasy to indifferent towards the object's appearance in their homes, and over 80% of these people appeared heavily reluctant to lose contact with it upon notice.\n\n\nThe most detailed advertisement concerning SCP-6985 that was obtained by personnel was a colourful poster picturing SCP-6985 resting on a white table in front of a bright screen. The poster reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n'Let your fears die away! Presenting\u2026..the anti-spider! The anti-spider is perfect for anyone with even a small fear of spiders. Why? Because it's nothing that a spider is and everything a spider's not! Simply take a look to see how not a spider this amazing creation is! And sleep good dreams with this on your bedside table, or anywhere else in your house. Knowing confidently that this is NOT a spider!'\n\n\n\n\nThe back of the poster features a table detailing the numerous differences between instances of SCP-6985 and members of the arachnid family:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpider\n\n\nAnti-spider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs hairy\n\n\nIs not at all hairy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas eight legs\n\n\nHas no legs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas eight eyes\n\n\nHas no eyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas fangs\n\n\nDoes not have fangs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan produce silk\n\n\nCan not produce silk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilds webs\n\n\nDoes not build webs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes eats other spiders\n\n\nDoes not eat, just waits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLays many eggs\n\n\nDoes not lay eggs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLives up to 40 years\n\n\nStays forever\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs easy to kill off\n\n\nCan not be killed, effectively indestructible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs alive\n\n\nIs not alive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEats thousands of insects every year, thus controlling the bug population in households worldwide\n\n\nDoes not do that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
