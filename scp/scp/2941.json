Instances should be provided with four to six hours of direct light from an overhead fluorescent. Each instance of SCP-2941 must be checked at least four times a day to confirm that specimen morale levels fall within mandated guidelines (for more information see Document 2941-M-5). Any measurements of specimen morale levels falling above standard containment parameters should be reported immediately to the current project head. Should standard demoralization acts prove insufficient, please consult Document 2941-DM-1 for Stage B countermeasures.\n\n\nSince Incident 2941-3-2, interaction with SCP-2941 is limited to researchers with Level 3 clearance. Additionally, transport of SCP-2941 instances to and from other Site-103 research wings must be carried out in pre-approved routes free of Foundation personnel traffic.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2941 is the collective designation for an anomalous population of fruits and vegetables. Instances of SCP-2941 only superficially resemble their non-anomalous counterparts, and differ from non-anomalous fruits and vegetables in both behavior and growth patterns. SCP-2941 instances possess limited sensory awareness, are capable of locomotion, and furthermore, some have shown the ability to speak, though how SCP-2941 instances manage to vocalize is currently unknown.\n\n\nUnder optimal containment conditions, the physical size of each instance of SCP-2941 conforms to the average size of comparable specimens in its particular species. However, rapid growth will occur when any instance of SCP-2941 is presented with verbal and/or physical affection as well as any other kind of positive reinforcement. Instances will also exhibit this property when engaging in pleasurable activities. No upper bound of SCP-2941's enlargement has been shown through on-site testing and by Foundation computer modeling. Proper demoralization must be maintained on a regular basis as any instance left alone for a period of between three to five hours will begin growing at a noticeable rate. Foundation researchers have hypothesized that each instance of SCP-2941 has an innate highly positive self-image that must be countered at all times.\n\n\nAddendum A:\n List of currently-contained SCP-2941 instances.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance Designations\n\n\nInstance Specifics\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-1\n\n\nRed Delicious apple\n\n\n(\nMalus domestica\n)\n\n\nPrimary pleasure vector involved rolling around in a circular path within its containment cell until researchers were able to convince SCP-2941-1 that any movement at all will awaken a massive parasitic worm living inside it. It should continue to be made clear that removing the worm from -1 is simply beyond the Foundation's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-2\n\n\nFennel\n\n\n(\nFoeniculum vulgare\n)\n\n\nMain morale boost comes from engaging in the popular children's game \"Peek-a-boo\" by being placed underneath a piece of fabric large enough to completely cover it, and then having the fabric quickly pulled away. Tests have shown that SCP-2941-2's greatest demoralization occurs when the fabric is simply left covering -2 and no attempt is made to assist while it tries to roll free. The longest time to date that -2 has been trapped beneath the fabric is sixteen days which, as test models predicted, coincided with record low morale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-3\n\n\nHoneydew melon\n\n\n(\nCucumis melo\n)\n\n\nIs very quick to notice nearby individuals, and will repeatedly vocalize questions regarding the quality of its roundness. To minimize misunderstanding on SCP-2941-3's part, researchers must be sure to always respond to each query with the statement \"You are a hideous cube.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-4\n\n\nCavendish banana\n\n\n(\nMusa acuminata\n)\n\n\nCompulsively attempts to show off its ability to balance vertically on its stem. SCP-2941-4 should always be contained within a bio-chamber specifically modified with a floor that constantly pivots up and down at random angles and direction, preventing -4 from balancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-5\n\n\nGreen pepper\n\n\n(\nCapsicum annuum\n)\n\n\nRegularly vocalizes concerns about the well-being of the rest of the SCP-2941 instances. SCP-2941-5 is to always be told that all the other specimens have made it clear to Foundation personnel that they wish -5 would mind its own business and that its consideration is unwanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-6\n\n\nPersian lime\n\n\n(\nCitrus \u00d7 latifolia\n)\n\n\nSCP-2941-6's morale has been shown to markedly increase when placed in a silent containment cell. Researchers are to do hourly checks to confirm that the speaker placed within -6's current bio-chamber is functioning correctly and that the audio file chosen by the current head researcher is playing on an uninterrupted loop at a minimum of 90db. At the time of writing, the sound of a knife scraping a glass bottle has been playing for eighty-four days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-7\n\n\nTurnip\n\n\n(\nBrassica rapa\n)\n\n\nHas expressed repeated desire to only be referred to as \"Terry\". Foundation personnel are expressly forbidden from doing so, but if absolutely necessary, they should refer to SCP-2941-7 directly, condescendingly, and repeatedly as any other name besides Terry. Names producing the most severe demoralization vectors so far include \"Ferguson\", \"Wingding\" and \"Budz\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-8\n\n\nButton mushrooms (2)\n\n\n(\nAgaricus bisporus\n)\n\n\nAs this pair has shown to prefer close visual contact, each separate SCP-2941-8 instance should be kept in detached, opaque chambers a minimum of 4m apart. If the situation requires, researchers are allowed to converse with the -8 instances separately, with a sole focus on pointing out how the other member of the pair had been given the opportunity to be placed back together but voluntarily and happily turned it down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-9\n\n\nPeach\n\n\n(\nPrunus persica\n)\n\n\nHas often expressed displeasure with all forms of physical contact by Foundation researchers. Any researcher involved with the study of SCP-2941-9 should mark on Form 9C how many times they were able to flick -9 with their finger throughout their work shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-10\n\n\nCantaloupe\n\n\n(\nCucumis melo\n)\n\n\nHas a predilection for wanting to tell jokes to Foundation staff. Morale reduction has been maximized by initiating Procedure 2941-10-\u03b1, which dictates that SCP-2941-10 be allowed to tell any joke it wishes, but should be addressed immediately afterwards with angrily-delivered comments regarding how poorly the joke was constructed and/or how -10 has profoundly hurt the joke recipient's feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-11\n\n\nEggplant\n\n\n(\nSolanum melongena\n)\n\n\nAs long as SCP-2941-11 has been under the Foundation's care, it has repeatedly vocalized only one sentence, without variation: \"Hoo boo, I love you.\" -11's morale has, through much experimentation, shown to decrease the most when addressed with the carefully enunciated response: \"You should be hurled into the trash.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 2941-3-2\n: Due to a sudden and substantial water leak from Site-103's Antarctic Gardens, one floor directly above SCP-2941-3's containment cell, a decision was made by Junior Researcher Metcalf to temporarily move SCP-2941-3 to an empty research room down the hall. At the same time, testing had just finished for the day with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and ten Class D personnel. As the remaining seven were being led back to the on-site Class D barracks, they passed Metcalf transporting SCP-2941-3 the opposite way down the same corridor. Ignoring established Transport Silence Protocols, D-34987 was later heard from recovered surveillance camera system data to call out loudly, \"Hey baby, those're some nice round melons you got there!\"\n\n\nJunior Researcher Metcalf, the seven Class D personnel, the two Security Officers leading them, and thirteen other nearby Foundation site staff were instantly crushed when SCP-2941-3 underwent the most rapid growth ever recorded by an SCP-2941 instance. Establishing morale levels low enough to re-contain SCP-2941-3 took eight hours and updated containment procedures were immediately put into effect.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
