Their current location remains unknown however, they are responsible for all known instances of SCP-6878-2. Instances of SCP-6878-2 have been discovered globally in Urban Environments. All instances of SCP-6878-2 must follow the Protocol/SCP-6878/1:\n\n\n1. Instances of SCP-6878-2 must be photographed by one D-Class personnel - under no circumstances must they or any Site personnel make unauthorised attempts to read or decrypt instances of SCP-6878-2.\n\n\n2. Photographed Instances of SCP-6878-2 must be transcribed by one D-Class personnel. Please routinely innoculate the D-Class with Class A Amnestics every 13 minutes.\n\n\n3. All Personnel - of all ranking - are to be anesthetised with Class-A Amnestics to erase the visual memory of viewing an instance of SCP-6878-2 within 13 minutes of viewing it.\n\n\nIf any instance of SCP-6878-2 is read by an individual and is not amnestied within 13 minutes, are to be isolated. Euthanasia is permitted if deemed merciful.\n\n\nIt is paramount that any further instances of SCP-6878-2 are reported by field agents. Any new instances are to be reported for testing, or if deemed necessary, immediately destroyed to prevent contamination of Civilians.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-6878-1 is a liquid entity responsible for SCP-6878-2, a series of graffiti located in Urban Environments globally. Valid sightings of SCP-6878-1 have been reported by Personal near instances of SCP-6878-2, but they have evaded capture. SCP-6878-1 appears to be a moving puddle of vividly coloured paint, reportedly seen shifting into a near humanoid shape without a clear purpose.\n1\n It is capable of crawling through any opening greater than that of 4mms and can move at a speed of 33.1\u00a0km/h to evade capture. It has been observed moving at a passive speed of 3.1km/h until intercepted or otherwise disturb.\n\n\nAn instance of SCP-6878-2 painted from a typical Aerosol paint that itself has no abnormal properties. It is unknown if SCP-6878-1 is also comprised of this paint. The instance is typically an unrecognisable word. [WORD]-Expon has remained the only pattern between instances, and no likely translation has been discovered. The grapheme\n2\n used are also poorly constructed to be \nalmost\n illegible. To clarify, the words are written as such that it would take focused attention to read and comprehend what is written.\n\n\nIf viewed and successfully read, the onlooker will within 13 minutes fall victim to the effects of said instance. The effects of each instance are tied specifically to them, and replicating said graffiti does not repeat their abnormal effects. The severity of these effects vary greatly but frequently share a symbolic or even loosely thematic tie to its located country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING COGNITOHAZARD: LEVEL 4 AUTHORITY REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nASSURE CLASS-A AMNESTICS ARE AT HAND.

Within three minutes, D-9099 had become a pile of fresh-cut rosemary.\n\n\nBursa, Turkey. October 21st 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanguis-Expon\n\n\nD-Class-9829 became suddenly idle for 24 hours until becoming alert in a tranquil state. D-9829 believed to be dead, and that they required only blood to sustain themselves. Simple Medical Exanimation disproved this, however, D-9829 has since developed Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) and has struggled to not vomit any substance that is not blood. (Addendum: November 3rd, 1999: D-9829 has since died of starvation.)\n\n\nBra\u0219ov, Romania. August 17th, 1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnuiumm-Expon\n\n\nAll technology created after 1950 ceased to function within 200 Meters of D-8289. The influence began small, with engines stalling or lightbulbs flickering, but within 1 hour, computers crashed, engines failed and all communication devices began to melt. The effects of D-8289 ceased after they were executed via strangulation.\n\n\nNew York, USA. January 1st, 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaecornua-Expon\n\n\nD-9993 suddenly began begging to be executed without given reason. D-9993 described a sensation 'overwhelming danger.' Within an hour, their limbs and extremities began to lengthen and liquify into a red, gelatinous state. They then began to grow a set of large and elongated goat horns. The combination of their gelatinous limbs and the weight of their horns has rendered them immobile. D-9993 was euthanised 4 months later after no further information was discovered.\n\n\nTokyo, Japan. May 2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcci-Expon\n\n\nDoctor Davus May failed to anesthetize themselves before the 13 Minutes elapsed. (Investigation Pending) Their skin was described as if it felt it was 'burning.' Its pigmentation became a gradient of colours, which swirled and shifted as Dr May moved. Dr May's employment status has been placed on hiatus, with a coming demotion for failure to follow set SCP-6878-2 Procedure.\n\n\nJaipur, India. February 8th 2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nOn March 18th 2006, SCP-6878 Containment Specialist Dr Leela Rand found a letter at her home address.\n\n\nThe letter is believed to be from SCP-6878-1 and also contains another instance of SCP-6878-2.
