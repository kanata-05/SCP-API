Daily, a D-Class Personnel must carry a bucket filled with 5\u00a0kg of tomato sauce to SCP-6407's containment cell, which will be given to the entity for absorption.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6407 is a sapient human male, concealed inside a layer of tomato ketchup. This layer covers the entirety of its body, except for the eyes. While its arms are incapable of movement, SCP-6407 can form streams of ketchup. In terms of appearance, these streams are similar to tentacles. SCP-6407 will use them to gain or discharge mass.\n\n\nSCP-6407 has partial control over all the ketchup that constructs its outer layer, effectively letting it separate the tomato sauce from all other substances that might contaminate it. Its internal organs seem to have been repurposed for an unknown function. However, these organs being utilized as means to avoid the spoiling and drying of the ketchup has been hypothesized.\n\n\nSCP-6407 regularly displays high levels of stress and anxiety, thus causing it to behave violently both with its environment and the people surrounding it. The anomaly's stress levels were significantly reduced during the time Dr. Jacob Fletcher was assigned to it.\n\n\nAddendum 6407.1:\n SCP-6407 was retrieved wandering in the woods near Candem, Alabama. SCP-6407 was involved in an incident in the \u201cTip Top\u201d fast food restaurant. SCP-6407, known as Myles Meighan at the time, was present along with three other employees: Simon Luke, Gabriel Collins and Andrew Jones.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the restaurant's security video footage. Access was granted by the restaurant's owner.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0OPEN\u00a0VIDEO\u00a0LOG\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0CLOSE\u00a0\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 04/06/2019\u00a011:03\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nOnly one client is present at the restaurant. Myles is taking their order while his coworkers converse in the kitchen.\n\n\nGABRIEL:\n I'm so bored.\n\n\nSIMON:\n Same. Maybe we could do something after work?\n\n\nANDREW:\n I can't. I have a date with my girl.\n\n\nSIMON:\n Are you bragging about your girlfriend again?\n\n\nANDREW:\n It's not my fault you can't get one.\n\n\nMyles walks into the kitchen and places the order on the kitchen table.\n\n\nMYLES:\n A basic burger with extra ketchup.

Don't get so flustered over a joke.\n\n\nMYLES:\n Fuck you.\n\n\nMyles and Gabriel work on their tasks respectively. Simon signals Andrew to a corner of the room. Unintelligible whispers are heard, followed by Simon and Andrew laughing. Gabriel turns around to look at them.\n\n\nSIMON:\n Gabriel, come here for a sec.\n\n\nGabriel approaches his two coworkers as they whisper something to him.\n\n\nGABRIEL:\n I don't think that's a good idea.\n\n\nSIMON:\n He'll be fine. We'll just help him clean up after, all right?\n\n\nANDREW:\n Yeah, don\u2019t worry so much.\n\n\nGabriel rolls his eyes as Myles finishes cooking the meat and starts preparing the hamburger.\n\n\nMYLES:\n I need the ketchup.\n\n\nSimon and Andrew are heard laughing.\n\n\nANDREW:\n Coming.\n\n\nAndrew grabs a ketchup bottle and gets close to Myles. When Myles extends his hand to grab the ketchup bottle, Andrew sprays his face with ketchup. Myles gasps in shock while his colleagues laugh. Myles punches Andrew and he falls to the floor.\n\n\nSIMON:\n Oh, shit.\n\n\nMyles sits on top of him and grabs the ketchup bottle. Myles puts the ketchup bottle on Andrew\u2019s mouth and starts filling it with ketchup.\n\n\nMYLES:\n How do you like that, asshole?\n\n\nGABRIEL:\n Stop it, Myles!\n\n\nSIMON:\n Dude, you're gonna kill him!\n\n\nMYLES:\n I fucking hate you. You won't make fun of me again.\n\n\nGabriel and Simon approach Myles to stop him when SCP-6407's anomalous traits manifest. The tomato sauce from its face spreads to his whole body, covering it. The bottle merges with him, turning into streams that drown Andrew. The other two step back.\n\n\nGABRIEL:\n What the hell?\n\n\nSIMON:\n Holy fucking shit, call the police!\n\n\nAndrew stops struggling after several seconds. SCP-6407 tries to get away while Simon and Gabriel assist their colleague.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7\u00a0CLOSE\u00a0\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabriel established contact with law enforcement after the incident, and the Foundation intervened after being notified by an embedded agent in the police force.

The cadaver of Andrew Jones was identified and recovered.

The two guards accompanying D-20226 immobilized SCP-6407. D-20226 was able to leave without any major injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019/06/20\n\n\nWhen Dr. Fletcher entered the containment chamber, SCP-6407 had written: \u201cI AM SORRY\u201d.
