Persons responsible for its spread are to be treated with Class B amnestics. Couples that have successfully performed SCP-4747 are to be treated with Class A amnestics.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Theta-6 (\"Witch Hunters\") is to capture and incinerate instances of SCP-4747-1. A single instance is kept for long-term study in Site 56, and is to be contained in a Type-B reinforced containment chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4747 is a document detailing a ritual intended to resolve relationship conflicts. Copies of SCP-4747 are shared primarily through sites such as Facebook and Reddit. SCP-4747 can be performed on a budget of under 100 USD.\n\n\nSCP-4747 takes a single day to perform, and requires the following:\n\n\n\n\nAt least two participants, all of which must be in a romantic relationship with one another, who have not performed SCP-4747 previously.\n\n\n1 meter\n3\n of wood.\n\n\n100 grams of grape jelly.\n\n\n6 candles per participant.\n\n\n1 kilogram of human hair.\n\n\nA hole, at least \u2588.\u2588 meters deep and \u2588.\u2588 meters wide.\n\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\nOn a successful performance of SCP-4747, an instance of SCP-4747-1 will emerge from the hole used in the ritual. SCP-4747-1 is an animate mass of human limbs and hair, approximately 1.5 meters in diameter. All instances of SCP-4747-1 are hostile towards humans, with the exception of individuals who have performed SCP-4747. Examination of SCP-4747-1 indicates that instances are genetically identical to the executor of Step 7.\n\n\nCouples that perform SCP-4747 report higher levels of relationship satisfaction. Long-term observation suggests lower levels of separation and future conflicts in such couples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4746\n | SCP-4747 | \nSCP-4748\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4747\n\" by UraniumEmpire, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
