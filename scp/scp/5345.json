Shipping routes within the Yellow Sea have also been rerouted as to minimize any possible contact. The existence of SCP-5345 is obscured via operatives embedded in space administration institutions with satellite imaging capabilities, and the governments of the Republic and Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5345 is an uninhabited island located in the Yellow Sea at 35\u00b0\u2588\u2588'\u2588\u2588.\u2588\"N, 125\u00b0\u2588\u2588'\u2588\u2588.\u2588\"E. The island contains several heavily damaged structures, believed to have been office blocks and warehouses. Numerous abnormal rock salt formations have been observed to protrude from the floors and walls inside and around these structures. It is noted that a significant amount resemble human beings.\n\n\nThus far, 2 identical sets of thaumaturgic sigils of different sizes have been discovered, one of which had a diameter of 10 meters, and was bleached into the floor of a warehouse from regular usage. The other is approximated to have been several hundred kilometers in diameter, with only a fraction of the set being visible via aerial surveys. No activity was recorded during observation of these sets.\n\n\nIdentified sigils bear marked similarities to those used in known ontokinetic manifestations, thaumaturgical rituals, and temporal alteration incantations for or related to divinity, teleportation, and seances. It is believed they served as ascendance rituals to access afterlife locations, allowing for the transportation of matter and entities. Very few documents have been found that describe the exact methods and resources required to conduct such rituals, and thus they have not been attempted.\n\n\nGeographical surveys indicate the island did not form by natural means, which has been corroborated by evidence of several major thaumaturgic events detected during psychometric analysis. It is currently understood that SCP-5345 was an inland region within a larger landmass that was displaced from consensus reality via thaumaturgic means. It is expected that SCP-5345 will fully collapse into the Yellow Sea within the next 80 years due to a combination of wave erosion and tectonic shifts.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5345 was discovered on 21/08/1987, following the detection of a spike in several energy signatures, including electromagnetic, Humic waves, Akiva radiation, and Elan-Vital Energy, from its current location during routine surveillance from several Foundation satellites. Obfuscation protocols were successfully enacted to obscure SCP-5345's existence from surveillance satellite-capable states. Foundation naval and aerial assets were dispatched to investigate the island and evaluate any potential threats, but found nothing of immediate concern. Expeditions into SCP-5345 were approved shortly afterwards.\n\n\nAddendum 5345.01:\n\nTo date, numerous expeditions into SCP-5345 and its structures have been conducted. Identical insignia found on walls across several structures point towards SCP-5345 being the former site of a complex for an organization. Intact documents and audio recordings from interviews and surveillance recorders have been found in intact filing cabinets and safes. All recovered documents did not use the Hangul script, but instead used a modified version of the \u02bcPhags-pa script.\n1\n Translated excerpts have been attached below.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0Access\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Media\u00a05345-A\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25bd\u00a0Access\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Media\u00a05345-A\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[\u2026] determined geopositioning sigils within concentric manifolds, circling an area large enough to cover the Motherland. It must be stressed once more that any individuals outside [\u2026]\n\n\n[WATER DAMAGE]\n\n\n[\u2026] kilometers of the activation site will not be transported during the process. It is expected that the displacement will be self-correcting, most likely resulting in the integration of the landmass into the underwater continental shelf, widening the Yellow Sea.\n\n\nThe Ritual Committee predicts minimal backlash, and we can expect temporal alterations in basal reality on the order of a few weeks per ton per displacement event. Local SRAs (Scranton Reality Anchors) are currently in use to prevent the Project from erasing itself whenever displacement events occur, currently limited to a 1 kilometer radius. No backlash is expected to occur in this region, and is standard Project Regno protocol. Such contingencies [\u2026]\n\n\n[WATER DAMAGE]\n\n\n[\u2026] not repeat the same mistake the Saudis did.\n2\n Maintenance of SRA synchronicity is of utmost importance, secondary only to development of the displacement processes.\n\n\nDue to factors beyond our control, the bulk of the backlash will be directed eastwards, in the general direction of the Daehan Empire.\n3\n We'll leave it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to figure that one out until we manage to completely displace the nation, after which their problems will be their own.

I know I could contribute to that if only I was put in charge of something tangible.\n\n\nHAE:\n Documents and tapes are tangible, no?\n\n\nKANG:\n One of these days I'm going to receive a disciplinary for throwing a colleague out of a window.\n\n\nHAE:\n In all seriousness though, I've been told the issue is under the jurisdiction of the Ritual Committee, not Testing. Got anything, Ji-Hyun?\n\n\nRYEO:\n It's nothing serious. Geopositioning the ritual can be a hit or miss.\n\n\nKANG:\n So you're saying they keep missing, and that's why we haven't landed in a proper Otherworld yet?\n\n\nRYEO:\n Well uh, we haven't gotten the right sigils down but that's by no fault of our own. We're in the process of amending some parameters though, so we might be seeing something soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT REGNO\n\n\nTRANSMISSION PRINTOUT ID 003528 (14/03/1985-21/03/1985)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow members, it is with great joy that I bring this news to the table. We have successfully sent an unmanned drone into an Otherworld, and had it return with photographs and video footage. You should find them attached to this transmission after the bleep.\n\n\nThere is no greater beauty in this world than the one we share with our ancestors.

The bottom, if there is any, is obscured by thick fog.

Bridge is noted to be empty.\n\n\n[00:00:58]:\n Signs of damage are noted on the bridge, ranging from scratch marks to large crevices. Burn marks are also recorded. Several structures are visible in the distance. Drone proceeds forwards.\n\n\n[00:02:24]:\n Structures are revealed to be 3 tall columns of indeterminate composition protruding out of the fog below. Drone does not possess adequate equipment nor reach to identify the column materials, but it is inferred from visual analysis that they are made of salt.\n\n\n[00:03:46]:\n Drone stops. It is unable to proceed further due to a large section of the bridge ahead being missing. In the absence of the drone's whirring, a very soft low humming sound can be heard.\n\n\n[00:03:49]:\n Drone reactivates to begin return process. Humming sound increases in volume. Audio and video quality begin to noticeably decline.\n\n\n[00:03:52]:\n Humming sound is now louder than the drone.

Wonder what we could've saw coming up behind the drone.\n\n\nRYEO:\n Yeah, about that, the guys at Rituals aren't too sure about what that was exactly. Right now the consensus is that we sent the drone to Chinvat\n5\n or an analogue, only problem is that neither should be having red skies nor damaged bridges. In fact, there should've been plenty of souls and at least 2 guardians there on the bridge, so whatever that was was probably not native to\u2014\n\n\nKANG:\n Be that as it may, this is a crucial moment for the Motherland, and Chinvat isn't even our objective so there's no use ruminating on it. Blacklist those sigils and move on already.\n\n\nRYEO:\n Still, I think it's in our best interests to understand what exactly went on in there. Anyway, Lee managed to plot out some sigils to an otherworld within local cosmology. They'll be formally submitted soon.\n\n\nKANG:\n Things are finally in motion again!

He appreciates the compassion had between faiths to bring about the existence of an endeavor such as Project Regno, but it is the current decision of His Holiness, and by extension the Holy See, to respectfully decline this invitation. His Holiness is of the understanding that such measures of entering Heaven pre-mortem are in opposition to the will of God, as is the Holy See of His papacy. Nonetheless, He is thankful that the Vatican was given such an opportunity.\n\nAssuring that the supplied equipment and machinery are safely returned, and of a remembrance in His Holiness's prayers, I am\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\nMonsignor G.

Please state what you saw upon displacement.\n\n\nSHIN:\n As you know, during the displacement event there was a bright flash of light from the activation site. Once I had recovered from the flash and subsequent disorientation, I found myself floating\u2014 no, more like standing on air, if that makes sense, over a lake valley populated by lotus flowers. It was oppressively calm. I could not find any strength in my legs to move about. I could only sit down and observe. I saw clouds nestled between green valleys and mountains, some of which were not connected to the ground at all. Twin suns straddled the horizon on the eastern and western horizons.\n\n\nKANG:\n One of the Pure Lands\n7\n?\n\n\nSHIN:\n It must be. After some time, the suns fell below the horizon. I saw lights in the distance. Cities, perhaps. There were twin moons as well, rising from the north and south.\n\n\nKANG:\n You've reported discrepancies between the interval of displacement and your perception of the flow of time in the otherworld. Please reiterate your statements for the record.\n\n\nSHIN:\n I understand the displacement interval was set by the Testing Committee to be 10 minutes. In the otherworld, I counted approximately 200 days to pass before I returned.\n\n\nKANG:\n Did you experience any sensations of hunger or thirst, or any overarching emotions during your time in the otherworld?\n\n\nSHIN:\n No. In hindsight, I'd describe the entire trip as 'boring', if not peaceful.\n\n\nKANG:\n I've one more question before I can let you go.

This shouldn't be the case. How many times has that happened throughout the project?\n\n\nRYEO:\n 3 times, all occurring under West Korean supervision. We've never seen anyone in the otherworlds. This might just be something unique to Pure Lands and Asia in general. I'm sure if we get the Etrurians to do it here, they'd get the same results.\n\n\nKANG:\n It doesn't match up to the scriptures. I'm not expecting direct displacement into the courts of Shambhala, but still. Where are all the bodhisattvas? They couldn't have just upped and left, could they? And what about those lights they keep seeing? How the hell do we explain that? \n[Sighs.]\n We're going to be laughing stocks at the next conference.\n\n\nRYEO:\n Ah cheer up. Not every otherworld's got time dilation.\n\n\nKANG:\n Sure, and then what of mobility? Are we going to keep finding otherworlds where we can't even move? The Remenkhemi have already made contact with the inhabitants of their Aatu and mapped out the most of their otherworld as compared to the rest of us. Why must this be so hard?\n\n\nRYEO:\n Objectively, we've already achieved something great by sending Shin to a Pure Land and not one of the potential Hells. I'd suggest taking a day off from work, all this stress can't be good for you.\n\n\nKANG:\n I appreciate your concern, but we have a duty to the Motherland, and I will not achieve that by lying around in complacency.

Fortunately, his works have not been lost to the annals of history. New advances in thaumaturgy have allowed for the confirmation of his texts on Otherworlds, primarily the \nDe Umbris Mundos\n, a primitive but foundational interpretation from a modern viewpoint. Now, it is not only possible to study these Otherworlds, which so vary by geography and culture, but to cross over into them as Man has set foot on the Moon.\n\n\nGOALS\n\n\n\n\nDerive a defined and sustainable thaumaturgical process to breach the \nprimum claustra\n.\n9\n \nDone\n\n\nEstablish a safe process for the displacement of survey and exploratory drones into Otherworlds. \nDone\n\n\nEstablish a safe process for the displacement of individuals into Otherworlds. \nDone\n\n\nEstablish Otherworld communications system (Bifr\u00f6st). \nDone\n\n\nEstablish plausible obfuscation protocol for uninvolved states. \nDone\n\n\nEstablish a safe process for the displacement of a defined area into Otherworlds. \nDone\n\n\nAchieve state transcendence/enlightenment/apotheosis for all project members. \nNot yet done\n\n\n\n\nAFFILIATE MANIFEST\n10\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom of Anglesey-Vesthaven \nDeparted\n\n\nOrder of Aztl\u00e1n \nDeparted\n\n\nRepublic of Basotoland \nDeparted\n\n\nBod \nDeparted\n\n\nFree Republic of Dakotah \nDeparted\n\n\nKingdom of Etruria \nDeparted\n\n\nFederation of Hiva \nDeparted\n\n\nKingdom of the Remenkhemi \nDeparted\n\n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia \nWithdrew\n\n\nRepublic of West Korea\n\n\nVatican City State \nWithdrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI did some digging as you asked.

        "Addendum 5345.01: To date, numerous expeditions into SCP-5345 and its structures have been conducted. Identical insignia found on walls across several structures point towards SCP-5345 being the former site of a complex for an organization. Intact documents and audio recordings from interviews and surveillance recorders have been found in intact filing cabinets and safes. All recovered documents did not use the Hangul script, but instead used a modified version of the \u02bcPhags-pa script. 1 Translated excerpts have been attached below.\n\n\n"

    "containment_procedures": "A perimeter of 5 kilometers around SCP-5345 is maintained by Foundation naval assets posing as Korea Coast Guard to deter any civilian vessels that may come into proximity of SCP-5345. Shipping routes within the Yellow Sea have also been rerouted as to minimize any possible contact. The existence of SCP-5345 is obscured via operatives embedded in space administration institutions with satellite imaging capabilities, and the governments of the Republic and Democratic People's Republic of Korea.",
