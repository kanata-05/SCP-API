It was constructed in 1984 and is in average condition for its age.\n\n\nThe apartment contains the following items:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBedroom\n\n\n\n\nTwin bed\n\n\nBedside table\n\n\nDresser\n\n\nLamp\n\n\nAlarm clock\n\n\nLuggage stand\n\n\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\n\n\nGas stovetop with 2 burners\n\n\nStainless steel sink\n\n\nMicrowave\n\n\nRefrigerator\n\n\nElectric kettle\n\n\nAssorted cutlery, crockery, pots and pans\n\n\n\n\nBathroom\n\n\n\n\nToilet\n\n\nCeramic sink\n\n\nShower\n\n\nWastepaper basket\n\n\n\n\nLounge\n\n\n\n\nTwo-seater sofa\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTelevision stand\n\n\nCoffee table\n\n\nFloor rug\n\n\n\n\nApartment 5919 has no remarkable attributes or properties beyond what would be expected of other apartments in the city.\n\n\nThe last resident of Apartment 5919 moved out in 2018. Since January 2020, it has been owned by a private organisation responsible for managing property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrej Schr\u00f6der.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n On 22/01/2020, a body retrieved from the Main River by Hesse State Police was identified as the Slovak-German artist Andrej Schr\u00f6der, born in Dresden in 1948. Schr\u00f6der had been under intermittent Foundation surveillance since 1985, after his first appearance in Central European anomalous art circles.\n\n\nWhile he enjoyed a distinguished career in sculpture, metalwork and mixed media at his Frankfurt studio, culminating in a 15-year retrospective exhibition (\n\"Schr\u00f6der: Capital, Cognition, Compulsion\"\n) at the Paris AWCY \nMill\u00e9naire?\n in 2000, he became gradually disillusioned with what he perceived as increasing commodification and consumerism within the art world, ceasing his own work entirely in 2009 and moving to his farm in Vogelsbergkreis to pursue gardening and maintaining his large collection of outsider art.\n\n\nSeveral of Schr\u00f6der's acquaintances re-established contact with him in 2015, when he returned to Frankfurt to work on what he described as a final, ultimate work of \"anti-art\", which would \"defy advertisement and marketing,\" although he never divulged any specific details. He reported having completed the project by late 2017, but was unable or unwilling to describe what he had created.\n\n\nSchr\u00f6der had been seen to be drinking heavily for several days prior to the discovery of his body and his death was ruled an accident, although the Hesse medical examiner noted that suicide could not be definitively excluded.
