SCP-5554 has been blocked from accessing or allowing access to the general public.\n\n\nUpdate:\n Following 09/25/2019, interaction using direct message has been proven successful. Researcher Oliver Crane is to message with SCP-5554 every day for the benefit of its mental health. For more information, see Addendum 2.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5554 is an account under the name \n\"Akihikoteddybear\"\n on the social media platform \nInstagram\n. All attempts to trace devices using this account have failed. Any Instagram account that interacts with SCP-5554 in any way (i.e. visiting its profile, viewing its posts) will become an instance of SCP-5554-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of SCP-5554-1 interacting with SCP-5554.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAkihikoteddybear:\n I\u2019m super happy to meet you guys! My name is Akihiko, but you can call me Aki!\n\n\nxxellie42xx:\n Hi Aki! You seem sweet!\n\n\nalwaysavian:\n Hi Aki! You seem sweet!\n\n\nohlawdhecomin:\n Hi Aki! You seem sweet!\n\n\namayas_journal:\n Hi Aki! You seem sweet!\n\n\nrandompixels:\n Hi Aki! You seem sweet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5554-1 are Instagram accounts that, although they had previously been maintained by normal civilians, operate via anomalous means since contact with SCP-5554. SCP-5554-1 instances will only post about and interact with SCP-5554. Separate SCP-5554-1 instances appear to act in coordination, as all such accounts post identical content and comments at exactly the same times. It is unknown at this time if SCP-5554 affects the civilians behind SCP-5554-1 accounts.\n\n\nAddendum 1: SCP-5554 Posts\n\n\nForeword: The following are all of SCP-5554's posts to date.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5554\u00a0Posts\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nPost One:\n I made a cute edit of me ^^\n\n\nPost Two:\n I\u2019m super happy to meet you guys! My name is Akihiko, but you can call me Aki!\n\n\nPost Three:\n I\u2019m pretty surprised that I gained a following so fast. Thank you all!\n\n\nPost Four:\n I love you guys and all, but why are you only posting the same thing in the comments?\n\n\nPost Five:\n Please stop doing that repetitive thing it\u2019s getting on my nerves\n\n\nPost Six:\n You didn\u2019t have to delete all your posts guys :/\n\n\nPost Seven:\n Are any of you still\u2026 there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: SCP-5554 Interaction\n\n\nOn 11/08/2019, SCP-5554 replied to a private message sent by Researcher Crane, who used the account \n\"ColorlessWire\"\n. The following are the results:\n\n\nNote- Researcher Crane programmed the Instagram account used to emulate the effects of a reality sink, leaving said account unaffected by SCP-5554\u2019s anomalous properties, making communication possible.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a02\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nCrane:\n Hello there, Aki.

During the exchange, SCP-5554 came to question its situation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a03\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote - SCP-5554's next reply came two hours following its previous message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nCrane:\n Hey Aki! We've been friends for about a month, and I realized we don't know much about each other.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Oh! I guess you're right! What do you wanna know?\n\n\nCrane:\n Whatever you're comfortable to answering, simple stuff ^^ favorite food, hobby, age if you're okay with it, I'm 20 if that helps. Basically, what you would put on a dating app profile.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Simple enough! I trust you don't have bad intentions. I'm 18, I love dogs, anime, rice, mochi, stuffed animals, bears, and cute things!\n\n\nCrane:\n Cool ^^ I like complex maths, literature, snakes are my favorite animal.\n\n\nCrane:\n In school I always looked forward to English and maths class, I'm a tad bit of a nerd.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Math, I've never liked it\ud83e\udd23 My English class taught me English cause I like in Japan \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\n\n\nCrane:\n That's cool! You speak English really well!\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n :)\n\n\nCrane:\n Can you say something in Japanese for me? That would be cool.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Sure! \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I just said \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"\n\n\nCrane:\n Lad, that was English.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \ud83e\udd14\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n No it wasn't\n\n\nCrane:\n Alrighty, then. Let's pay it no. mind. Hmmm. What else to talk of.\n\n\nCrane:\n Do you have any siblings?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n No\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Do you?\n\n\nCrane:\n I do not.\n\n\nCrane:\n Any pets?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n A dog\n\n\n[SCP-5554 sends a picot of a dog.]\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \ud83d\udc36\n\n\nCrane:\n Very cute.

Most embarrassing childhood memory?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Nothing\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Try again maybe that was a fluke\n\n\nCrane:\n Did you have any friendships that changed your view on society, for better or worse?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I had friends\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I have friends\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I can't think further than that\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Is this some cruel amnesia?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n One more time\n\n\nCrane:\n If your best friend and your mother were about to fall off a cliff, who would you save?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Sorry I.. I'm back.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Dex, why aren't you like the others?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Why are you an actual person?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Or at least a convincing ai\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Suddenly the ai overflow stopped then a handful including you of real people that seem real started to talk to me\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n That\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n That can't be a coincidence\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I'm not sure why I'm realizing all of this now\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Do you know why this all happened\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I feel like you do\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I know you can see this fucking respond\n\n\nCrane:\n I knew the day you found out would be coming soon.\n\n\nCrane:\n I'm afraid you're conclusion is correct. None of that was a coincidence. The details are best left obscured, but I'll explain what's important.\n\n\nCrane:\n You are not a human being as it appears you believe, you only exist through your instagram account.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n What\u2026.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n That\u2026. no\u2026\u2026.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n You never wanted to be my friend?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n :<\n\n\nCrane:\n That part isn't true. I've actually quite enjoyed talking with you, and hope to continue doing so.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n You mean it?\n\n\nCrane:\n I do.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026how can I believe you?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n You lied to me before, you'll do it again. \u2639\ufe0f\n\n\nCrane:\n I wouldn't take time out of my schedule every day to talk to you if I didn't truly enjoy doing so.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026\u2026\u2026.not 100% convinced.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n But I don't really have anyone else to talk to so\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Maybe we'll actually become friends after a bit, now that we actually know more about each other\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I just came on here to make friends\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I didn't mean for any of this\n\n\nCrane:\n I believe you. I've seen weirder.\n\n\nCrane:\n And I believe our friendship wasn't fake. You've just gotta trust, mate. I know it's hard after your trust has been betrayed. But, it can be repaired.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026yeah. Thanks, I guess.\n\n\nCrane:\n No problem. I've gotta split. Take care.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n You too\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Hhhhh\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Wait\n\n\nCrane:\n Yes?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Do you have just a few more minutes\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I still like\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I'm still processing all of this\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n And I don't want to do it alone\n\n\nCrane:\n I have a few minutes to spare.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n What about my friends\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Back in Sapporo\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Do they exist?\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I never even though about the fact that I didn't know their instagram accounts\n\n\nCrane:\n To be honest, lad, I'm not sure.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Every memory I have never happened\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n And I don't have nearly as many memories as I though\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Thinking about it I don't have a childhood\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Why didn't I realize this sooner\n\n\nCrane:\n I believe that asking a question that threatened you identity broke the facade you were functioning under, just an account. It made you realize there is more to life than you thought.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n That makes sense\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I think\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Who amI if not who I thought?\n\n\nCrane:\n Aki, you may not be a human being, but you still have defining qualities, and you are sapient. The things you knew about yourself still define who you are, even if some of those things aren't true, such as where you live. But your opinions could still be true, as long as you can back them up.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I can!! I like dogs cause they are super cute and rice looks like it tastes good\n\n\nCrane:\n It appears your opinions are formed to match that of an average person your age. You probably subconsciously selected them from the internet, and they made you who you are.\n\n\nCrane:\n Humans aren't born with opinions. We collect them from other places as well, just like you did. You just did it in a. bit differently than most. We use experience, while you use data.\n\n\nCrane:\n So you're not human, but you are thinking and feeling.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n So I have stuff in common with humans!\n\n\nCrane:\n You could say that, yes.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I\u2026 I'm still processing all of this. But I think it'll be a little easier now\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Hopefully\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \u2026\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Thank you\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n For talking to me\n\n\nCrane:\n It's no sweat, lad.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n I really do appreciate it. I think the conversations like these are gonna help me grown into who I thought I was\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Or, as close as I can get.\n\n\nCrane:\n I'm happy for you.\n\n\nCrane:\n Gotta split.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n Bye :)\n\n\nCrane:\n Bye, lad. Till next time.\n\n\nSCP-5554:\n \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing statement: Daily communication with SCP-5554 is to continue until further notice.\n\n\nFurther requests to reclassify this anomaly as Euclid are currently not being accepted. This is a sapient AI running on a server that we cannot physically locate, capable of turning any online platform into a party of praise, which would have only continued to expand if we had not interfered.
