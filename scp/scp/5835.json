It is capable of speech and answers to the name \"Mr. Cadmium Charleston Conrad Cole the Canary-Colored Canary, Esquire\", or \"Cadmium\" for short.\n\n\nSCP-5835 appears only when a human subject expresses a desire to no longer see the color yellow. When this happens, SCP-5835 will manifest before the human subject, remove their ability to perceive yellow, then disappear. (The location of SCP-5835 between manifestation events is unknown.) Subjects have described yellow objects appearing to be white or gray.\n\n\nWhile the perception of the color yellow is not necessary for human life\n4\n, SCP-5835 will continue to manifest before the subject, harassing them with facts about the color and its apparent importance. During this time, the subject is designated SCP-5835-A.\n\n\nSCP-5835 will continue its binding to SCP-5835-A until either the apology or death of the subject. Multiple instances of SCP-5835-A cannot exist at the same time.\n\n\nAdditionally, as demonstrated by SCP-5835-13 and corresponding behavioral citations, SCP-5835 is unaffected by blunt-force trauma and gunfire.\n\n\nAddendum: Manifestation Logs for SCP-5835-16\n\n\nFirst Manifestation:\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 7/12/2017\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-59, Testing Room B12\n\n\nTime:\n 09:35 EST\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Mundy:\n Read from the sheet of paper.\n\n\nD-29583:\n Um\u2026 \"I hate yellow.\"\n\n\nDr. Mundy:\n Use the exact wording.\n\n\nD-29583:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Mundy:\n Your cooperation is mandatory.\n\n\nD-29583:\n I said I hate yellow.
