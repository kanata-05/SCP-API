Containment of SCP-3454 individuals is to be enacted immediately. The Lead Researcher of Site-BEES is tasked with:\n\n\n\n\ndetermining what is to be done with individuals who are SCP-3454, and\n\n\nascertaining the best way to introduce the entire population of Earth to the Land of Tall Bees, one person at a time, with Foundation personnel given priority.\n\n\n\n\nResearch is ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3454 is the designation for individuals who don't agree that the bees are tall.\n\n\nThe Land of Tall Bees\n1\n is accessible via a temporospatial tear\n2\n3\n located inside an abandoned Target Canada store in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The bees are very tall.\n\n\nThe portal to the Land of Tall Bees was discovered in 2016 by an individual who understood the bees and their tallness. The portal was brought to the Foundation's attention after numerous SCP-3454 instances contacted the police, outing themselves as anomalies. After securing the location, Foundation personnel were introduced to the Land of Tall Bees\n4\n and the location began operation as Site-BEES.\n\n\nIt is currently unknown why some individuals are SCP-3454. Unfortunately, the only way to determine whether or not an individual is SCP-3454 or not is to send them through the portal. This often upsets the bees. You do not want tall, upset bees.\n\n\nIndications of being SCP-3454 include:\n\n\n\n\nlack of desire to discuss the bees\n\n\ndisinterest in the bees\n\n\nnot stating the bees are tall without being prompted\n\n\ninterfering in Foundation operations at Site-BEES.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3454-01: Testing Logs\n\n\nNote that testing began prior to all Site-BEES staff being introduced to the Land of Tall Bees. Some tonal inconsistencies persist.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 05/08/2017\n\n\nTest Number:\n 1\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n D-0901, age 35, convicted of multiple automobile thefts\n\n\nMethodology:\n Initial record of human interaction with \nSCP-3454\n the Land of Tall Bees.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Subject directed to extend right arm through \nSCP-3454\n the portal to the Land of Tall Bees. Subject does so without adverse effect.\n5\n Doctor Page, \nformer\n Lead Researcher, commences with second test. Subject is tethered and given a camera before being sent bodily through \nSCP-3454\n the portal to the Land of Tall Bees. Exploration lasts three minutes, and subject returns unharmed.\n\n\nNotes:\n Subject was noted to exclaim, \"Dude, it's full of tall bees!\" upon exiting.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 06/08/2017\n\n\nTest Number:\n 5\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n D-0901, D-9310, Agent Cook, Agent Block, Doctor Wessig, Doctor Addams, Junior Researcher Mazn\n\n\nMethodology:\n Find out just how tall the bees are.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Subjects enter the portal to the Land of Tall Bees with measuring tapes. Tapes are not long enough to measure the bees.\n7\n Average bee height confirmed as being greater than 3.6 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nThis test was not authorized. I suspect SCP-3454 is having an adverse effect on my team. I am calling a moratorium on testing until we can get an infohazard response team down here.\n - Dr. Page, \nformer\n Lead Researcher, SCP-3454\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 07/08/2017\n\n\nTest Number:\n 11\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n D-0901, D-9310, Agent Cook, Agent Block, Doctor Addams, Junior Researcher Mazn, Doctor Sawyer, Doctor Sawyer, Junior Researcher Kenzaki, Junior Researcher White, D-10008, Doctor Patel, Agent Weathersby, Agent Conte, Agent Richter, Agent Kimmel, Junior Researcher Chaudhury, Doctor Zhang, Doctor Reeves, Agent Jones-Reeves, Agent Cartham, Junior Researcher Godel, D-8624, SCP-3454-145\n8\n, a claw hammer\n\n\nMethodology:\n Convince SCP-3454-145 that the bees are tall.
