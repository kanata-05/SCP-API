Suicide capsules are to be made available on request. Neutralization orders are to be carried out for all surviving Keter class anomalies wherever possible. Foundation facilities are to independently follow abandon-in-place procedures when staffing reaches 30% or lower, or at the discretion of the facility director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3519 is a memetic contagion carried by multiple vectors in print, visual, and auditory media. It consists of the strong conviction that the world will end on March 5th, 2019 and that suicide prior to the event is desirable.\n\n\nSCP-3519 is transmitted by both media and word of mouth reports of a belief in an impending eschaton. Infection is characterized by credulous adoption of the meme despite the lack of evidence. The specific details of the predicted event show wide variation, including belief in: the advent of a messianic religious figure, catastrophic astronomical event, environmental collapse, technological singularity or reality failure event.\n\n\nNotably, none of these events are associated with any predicted K-class scenarios on this date and the Foundation's assessment of K-class probability on that day is at the nominal rate of .015% after accounting for SCP-3519.\n\n\nFollowing initial infection, hosts show a tendency towards ecstatic revelation, millenarianism, and suicidal ideation. Self-euthanasia is rationalized in the context of the variation of SCP-3519 belief the host has been infected with, as either a prerequisite for transcendence or as preferable to survival through the event.\n\n\nSuicide follows initial infection within weeks in a significant number of cases; due to the difficulty of accurate data collection at this time exact statistics are unavailable. However no known infected person has survived longer than 40 days after wholly adopting SCP-3519 beliefs.\n\n\nAddendum 3519-A, Samples of SCP-3519 Infected Media:\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt From CNN, Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0, 12/29/18:\n\n\nAnderson Cooper:\n So how credible is this prediction?\n\n\nKellyanne Conway:\n The White House thinks this is highly credible. We have multiple sources, reliable sources, that say that the world might end on March fifth.\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson:\n This is pretty silly, I mean it's tragic that those people killed themselves, but there's nothing. Nothing in the skies, nothing on the Earth other than our own threats to our survival from climate change or nuclear war. March fifth is going to be a day like basically any other. This is just like that so-called Mayan apocalypse in 2012, or even the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate people in the 90s.\n\n\nArchbishop Carrera:\n We have recently uncovered evidence that a secret society of Aztec priests continued the work of Mayan prophecy into the modern world and that these had recalculated the apocalypse to be the fifth day of March of next year. We feel this may be in line with the prophecy of St. John.\n\n\nConway:\n Yes, the Church is one of our sources, as is the envoy of the \nGovernment of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in Exile\n, which has been in communication with the President as you've seen from this morning's tweet.\n\n\nScreen shows the President's tweet from that morning \"Aztec envoy told me world ending on 3/5. Terrifying!\"\n\n\nTyson:\n There's no such thing as the \"Government of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in Exile\", it's an urban legend.\n\n\nCarrera:\n Dr. Tyson, surely you must have an open mind about these things.\n\n\nCooper:\n That's all the time we have, but I'm not afraid to admit that I'm scared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitation 02/12/19\n\n\nLast Dance on Earth\n\n\nWhere:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588; on the roof!\n\n\nWhen:\n 02/14/19 from 1\u00a0pm to 1 am.\n\n\nWhat:\n We will be celebrating this last Valentines on Earth. There will be a wet bar and live music! Bring whatever you want to drink or eat. Don't bother with condoms if you don't want because this is the end, haha. If you plan on checking out \nafter\n Valentines, please plan on leaving by midnight. At 1 am you are welcome to join us in the pool when we plan to drop a High Voltage line to carry us electric to Valhalla.

Let's say that we accept his argument that the probability of life being a simulation is one. Looking at what's happening in the world right now, the probability of surviving past the 5th is definitely not one, it's rapidly declining to zero. Even if you do live, what kind of life are you going to be able to have?\n\n\nWhat's the probability of everybody in the world deciding that the world is ending on the exact same day and that you have to, in defiance of the survival instinct and everything, kill yourself before that day? It seems unlikely, but it is happening.\n\n\nWhat would a simulation look like from the inside, right before they switched it off?\n\n\nMaybe they need us offline when we migrate to a new program.\n\n\nI love you so much, Rinna.
