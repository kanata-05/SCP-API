Given the large quantity of instances, containment is not feasible at this time. Embedded Foundation personnel within worldwide communities are to trace the sightings and migrations of SCP-8675 instances globally. Instances captured by Foundation personnel are to be transported to Site-58 for further analysis.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8675 refers to a flock of 6,500 paper birds. Each individual instance is different, but all appear intentionally created. They can be comprised of different types of paper with various designs, colors, or writings on them, and various folding or drawing styles. When exposed to open air or in the presence of other SCP-8675 instances, the entities behave in a pattern much more similar to that of wild birds. This includes migratory and flocking behavior coordinated over long distances. SCP-8675 instances are capable of flying without displaying fatigue and can sustain flight in conditions that would normally be hazardous.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8675-1:\n\n\nOn January 4th, at 10:48 AM, Site-58 experienced a disturbance when a pink SCP-8675 instance flew into the hallway from the office of Junior Researcher Salam Narjeen, who entered the corridor soon after, attempting to capture the bird. These efforts subsisted for 25 minutes, until Junior Researcher Cooper managed to contain the SCP-8675 instance using an empty Tupperware container.\n\n\nNote that the bird was found to possess two names on it. One was the name of Salam Narjeen. The other was a name of a deceased five-year-old, whose name has since been redacted.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Narjeen was escorted to a secure interview room for a debrief.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nForeword:\n Junior Researcher Narjeen is seated at the interview table, her gaze distant and unfocused. She remains unresponsive until Junior Researcher Cooper enters the room and takes a seat across from her.\n\n\nCooper:\n Salam. Are you okay?\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I think so.\n\n\nCooper:\n The bird is safe, by the way. But I have some questions\u2026 if you\u2019re ready.\n\n\nNarjeen nods.\n\n\nCooper:\n Can you tell me who [REDACTED] is? Why was his name on the bird? And\u2026 why was yours?\n\n\nNarjeen:\n A few weeks ago, I stumbled across this website. I should\u2019ve been working, but I\u2026 sometimes I can\u2019t think about anything else. You know what I mean\u2014I\u2019ve told you before.\n\n\nCooper:\n Because of the\u2014\n\n\nNarjeen opens her mouth to interrupt Cooper, but nothing comes out. Instead, her eyes glisten in the fluorescent lighting as tears threaten to spill.\n\n\nCooper:\n Salam? Look, I need you to focus. Please. This is important.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n You know, when you talk with relatives and friends from back home, they ask you what you\u2019re doing. And they say you\u2019re incredibly smart, that you\u2019re going to do something incredible. But the part that goes unsaid is that your family\u2026 got out. You are one of the few hopes your home country has for peace. So you\u2019d better do something incredible, or otherwise\u2026\n\n\nCooper:\n And how does that explain your humanitarian arts and crafts project manifesting anomalous properties? Salam, you need to help me understand this.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I've done \na lot.\n But all I can do for my homeland is sit here and make dumb paper birds. I\u2019ve never even been there. I don\u2019t know these people, or this child, and yet\u2026I feel like I\u2019ve failed them.\n\n\nCooper:\n Failed them? Do you even hear yourself? You didn\u2019t fail anyone. But running yourself into the ground like this? That\u2019s not helping anyone either.\n\n\nNarjeen\n: You cannot begin to fathom the loss and pain that has been felt there for the last fifteen months, although in all fairness, neither can I.\n\n\nThere is a long pause.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I thought, maybe if I can make a bird, it can fly away and tell my people how sorry I am for not dying alongside them. Isn\u2019t that fucked up?\n\n\nCooper:\n It\u2019s not fucked up\u2014it\u2019s human. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s painful, and it\u2019s what we do when we don\u2019t have answers. But Salam, you\u2019re here for a reason. Don\u2019t forget that.\n\n\nCooper walks around the table and places a hand on Narjeen\u2019s shoulder as she begins to cry.\n\n\nCooper:\n Take a minute. We\u2019ll finish this later.\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n The SCP-8675-1 instance created by Junior Researcher Narjeen remains in containment. Global SCP-8675 instances will continue to be monitored for changes. At this time, further questioning of Narjeen did not reveal any additional useful information surrounding the phenomenon.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8675-2:\n\n\nOn January 15th, 2025, a ceasefire was declared along the Gaza Strip after 467 days of conflict. This marked a worldwide change in the behavior of SCP-8675 birds and flocks, including previously inanimate and stored instances. These behaviors were identical to migratory behaviors of real-world birds, coordinated over long distances. Migratory routes were determined to congregate at the Gaza Strip.\n\n\nFollowing the heavily-deliberated release authorization of SCP-8675-1 due to this phenomenon, a field observation was conducted to track its behavior after being freed from containment. The instance was released near the Gaza Strip, and tracked via remote-controlled drone as it joined a larger group of SCP-8675-1 instances. Junior Researchers Narjeen and Cooper were permitted to monitor this event.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nCooper:\n Salam?\n\n\nNarjeen:\n Yes?\n\n\nCooper:\n You mentioned something about a\u2026 a website, I believe, when we first talked about SCP-8675. If you're okay with telling me, I wanted to ask if there was any other thing you felt we should know before we go any further.\n\n\nNarjeen nods slowly.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n Good a time as any, I suppose.\n\n\n\n\n13:04: SCP-8675-1, having been released from containment, joins a group of approximately several dozen other SCP-8675 instances in coordinated flight above a refugee camp located in the northern Gaza Strip. The camp is densely populated with displaced humans and livestock. Below, individuals on the ground appear initially unaware of the presence of the SCP-8675 flock overhead, with many focused on collecting flour that had spilled from their bags onto the streets following recent aid drops. A significant portion of the population is observed in a kneeling position, attempting to gather the scattered supply from the ground, despite its contamination. Approximately fifteen SCP-8675 instances descend and begin pecking at the grain alongside the refugees.\n\n\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I told you before that I can't focus sometimes because all I can think about is Palestine? Well, I stumbled upon this site. And there was a kid on there\u2026 just five years old. And no one else had made him one yet.\n\n\nNarjeen chuckles.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n It was impulsive. I grabbed some post-its from my desk, sketched something quickly, and folded it together. I thought I\u2019d just put it away, but as soon as I finished, I looked away\u2014and it was gone. And you know the rest.\n\n\n\n\n13:06: The flock moves towards a nearby building, now reduced to rubble, with debris dispersed across a large field behind the remains of the structure. No signs of human life are detected in the area. Despite this, seventeen SCP-8675 instances descend and position themselves in rows of five within a small section of the rubble. The remaining instances continue in formation, passing over the site. Subsequent analysis confirmed the structure to have been a former schoolhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCooper:\n Do you have any idea why it came to life?\n\n\nNarjeen:\n Grief, perhaps. Or memories. Just the devastating idea that there was a child who didn't get to grow up to be something other than a genocide statistic.\n\n\nCooper:\n So- your theory is that it was the child's spirit?\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I didn't make the bird as a vessel for some poor, dead kid's soul. Muslims don't believe in ghosts or reincarnation or anything like that. I instead made it as\u2026 as a kindness. You know? The kindness of saying he existed, and his life was precious, and that his story was felt outside the now-cruel corner of the world where they live.\n\n\n\n\n13:09: The flock shifts its flight path again toward a nearby residential area. Several houses are visible, many of which are severely damaged or destroyed. SCP-8675-1 is observed gliding toward one particular house with a collapsed roof. The bird approaches and enters the house through a large broken window on the second floor.\n\n\n\n\nNarjeen:\n Now that I think about it, \nYa Allah\n, it's not even a true kindness\u2014barely an acknowledgment. Just a paper bird with a dead child's name.\n\n\nShe scoffs bitterly.\n\n\nNarjeen:\n And I'm just throwing it out into the world hoping it makes someone feel better!\n\n\nCooper:\n Salam\u2026\n\n\nNarjeen\u2019s eyes well up with tears, though she doesn't cry.\n\n\n\n\n13:12: Inside the house, dust is suspended in the air, slowly settling over the furniture and debris. A thin layer of dust coats every surface, indicating the house has been abandoned for an extended period. Scattered remnants of personal belongings are visible, including disheveled toys, broken picture frames, and fragmented decorations. Exposed rebar is evident in several areas, suggesting structural collapse. The room appears to have been abandoned suddenly. The only recent sign of human inhabitation is the phrase \"\u0644\u062f\u064a \u0623\u0645\u0644\"\n1\n drawn in the dust covering a painting still affixed to the wall.\n\n\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I \u2014 it's not like I know this kid. I don't know any of these kids but it doesn't matter that I don't know them because someone does, someone did and \u2014 I just can't stop thinking about how unfair it all is. And\u2026 that makes me want to imagine a different reality for him, for a little while. A reality where the children went back to their families. Where they stayed in the clouds just long enough and then came back down\u2014to draw on the walls, break vases, and refuse to go to sleep because they were so happy to be home.\n\n\n\n\n13:17: SCP-8675-1 flies into an adjacent bedroom. The room contains two beds, placed at opposite ends of the space. The bird makes several laps between the bedroom and house, inspecting what remains. One bed is visibly damaged, its frame bent and mattress torn, while the other remains relatively intact, with a pillow still positioned neatly at the head. SCP-8675-1 settles onto the intact bed\u2019s pillow and ceases movement.\n\n\n\n\nNarjeen:\n I believe the children are in the clouds. But I know they\u2019re not coming back.\n\n\n\n\n13:39: SCP-8675-1 remains stationary on the pillow, offering no further signs of activity.\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\nAll known SCP-8675 instances returned to specific locations along the Gaza Strip, predominantly school buildings and residential homes. Upon arrival, all SCP-8675 instances ceased movement. A subsequent survey of inanimate SCP-8675 instances conducted by Foundation personnel revealed that the number and distribution of the birds corresponded roughly to the 6,750 Palestinian children who had perished as a result of the Palestine-Israel war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish children didn't die. I wish they would be temporarily elevated to the skies until the war ends. Then they would return home safe, and when their parents would ask them: \"where were you?\", they would say: \"we were playing in the clouds\"\n\n\n- Ghassan Kanafani\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
