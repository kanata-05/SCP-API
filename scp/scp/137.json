SCP-137 is to be fed three meals a day. Under no circumstances are any toys allowed to come within five hundred (500) meters of SCP-137.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-137 is an entity with the ability to possess a toy, gaining the physical properties, size, and shape of whatever it represents; for example, a teddy bear will become an actual bear, and behave accordingly. SCP-137 cannot possess any miscellaneous object, only toys. The observed range of SCP-137's possessive effect is two hundred fifty (250) meters, but until further testing has been accomplished, SCP-137 is assumed to have a maximum range of five hundred (500) meters from its position.\n\n\nSCP-137 was first brought to Foundation attention after a series of bizarre deaths and incidents involving children. The deaths were determined to be too random to be a serial killer, and Foundation agents were sent in to investigate. It was located after an interview with a young girl suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, after a naked man had appeared in her bedroom. It was encountered in the same neighborhood in the form of a gorilla. SCP-137 was then tracked and finally captured when it possessed a stuffed pony doll in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and was chased into the nearby wilderness. SCP-137 was tranquilized, and extracted to Site-19 by helicopter.\n\n\nTesting has shown that SCP-137 takes on the characteristics of the toy it possesses, but only as a child might perceive it. A toy soldier becomes a violent, well-armed man. A toy gun fires bullets. A toy lion attacks and kills humans. However, it lacks true intelligence. It shows no sign of long-term memory, nor any capacity for learning or abstract thinking (See Interview 137-1). For more information, please refer to \nExperiment Log 137\n.\n\n\nIt is currently inhabiting a princess doll, of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 line.\n\n\nAddendum\n\n\nInterview 137-1:\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-137\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview took place to determine what SCP-137 is, and why and how it possesses toys.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Good day.\n\n\nSCP-137:\n Hello! I'm Princess Blossom. Are you my prince?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No. Now, can you please tell me what you are?\n\n\nSCP-137:\n I am a princess! I am the prettiest princess in the whole world!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Where did you come from?\n\n\nSCP-137:\n I live in a castle.
