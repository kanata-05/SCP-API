SCP-7617 is a Caucasian adult male of British-Israeli descent, 161 centimeters in height with brown eyes and short black hair.\n\n\nThroughout recent observations conducted by the Department of Metafictional Research, SCP-7617 has been shown to possess an extremely low amount of pataphysical involvement potential. While baseline individuals have around at least 2 to 5 DMRGs\n1\n, SCP-7617 seems to only possess a reading of -3 at the time of writing, which is extremely unusual and completely unlikely for personnel employed by the Foundation.\n\n\nEssentially, this would mean that any and all developing narratives fundamentally avoid SCP-7617, as he doesn't have the required cynosure to be the focal point of a narrative. As such, he has, at the time of writing, successfully evaded being affected and/or killed by some external story-driven force.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7617-1, Recognized Events:\n The following is a list of events compiled by the Department of Metafictional Research that may have been attributed to SCP-7617's anomalous properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate & Time\n\n\nEvent Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23/4/2018 (1:21 PM)\n\n\nDuring a containment breach caused by an \nSCP-4310\n instance\n2\n, the West Wing of Site-400, which also houses the personal quarters, was put on indefinite lockdown. Unfortunately, most of the Foundation personnel who were present in the Wing were killed by the SCP-4310 instance. SCP-7617, who was also present in the West Wing, was asleep during the breach, and therefore did not exit his quarters and encounter SCP-4310\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13/07/2019 (4:44 AM)\n\n\nIn the midst of a raid conducted by the Chaos Insurgency, SCP-7617 (along with his colleagues from MAUDE) evacuated their workstations as per protocol and attempted to lock themselves within a nearby emergency shelter. However, on his way to the shelter, SCP-7617 was accidentally struck on the head by a fallen pipeline, and was knocked unconscious. His aforementioned colleagues, not noticing his absence, did not retrieve SCP-7617 and proceeded to enter the shelter without him. Thankfully, when Insurgency operatives arrived where SCP-7617 had fallen unconscious, they did not acknowledge him and moved on, possibly thinking that he was already dead. As a result of this, SCP-7617 is one of the few individuals who survived the raid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/09/2019 (11:43 AM)\n\n\nWhile an \nSCP-008\n containment outbreak\n4\n was plaguing the entirety of Site-400, SCP-7617 was safe at home, recovering from a head injury he sustained from the previous Chaos Insurgency raid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7617-2, Incident Log:\n On December 7th, 2020, following ten seconds after the official posting of the above document to the SCiPnet server, SCP-7617, who was having lunch below an opened skylight roof in Site-400's main cafeteria, was struck by five consecutive lightning bolts and immediately died to internal burns and severe organ damage.\n\n\nAnalysis of SCP-7617's corpse revealed that it now possesses a DMRG reading of 1, and is consequently no longer considered anomalous. His remains were subsequently cremated and stored within Site-400's residential columbarium.\n\n\nSCP-7617 has been reclassified to Neutralized as of this incident. Its main document will be updated shortly.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7616\n | SCP-7617 | \nSCP-7618\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7617\n\" by NDHeckfire, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

Later, SCP-7617 reported to on-site security that he was a very heavy sleeper, and thus did not overhear the alarm announcing the breach.\n\n\n4\n.
