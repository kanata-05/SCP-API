Certain privileges have been afforded to SCP-5954 to ensure its future cooperation, including a prerogative over any mundane houseplants possessed by Foundation employees and contractors at \nSite-77\n.\n\n\nControlled release of its gases is performed by \nMobile Task Force Psi-7\n. This process is embarrassing for SCP-5954, and care should be taken to ensure its comfort and future cooperation with containment operations.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5954 is an amalgamation of organic materials taxonomically classified within the Eukaryotic domain and Plantae kingdom. SCP-5954 is sapient, possessing cognitive capabilities comparable to an adult human, and self-identifies as \u201cStakemaster of the Vines, Protector of Potting Soils, defender of Fertilized Civilization, sixth of his name Ferda Lorenzo.\u201d\n\n\nWhile SCP-5954 can incorporate any matter composed of plant cells into its body, it has only attempted absorbing vegetables grown under its supervision. The cells do not need to be alive, and once absorbed typically begin dying after 4-6 weeks. Decomposing plant matter causes flammable gas build-up within SCP-5954, which will ignite unexpectedly and without warning.\n\n\nAlthough capable of communicating with both humans and plants, SCP-5954 primarily communes with the latter. SCP-5954 is disinterested in speaking unless it can talk about plants or \u201cmy medical condition.\u201d\n1\n\n\nSCP-5954 enjoys cultivating plants, possessing the capability to detect their emotional state post-germination. While being willing to listen to Foundation horologists, SCP-5954 habitually dismisses their advice in caring for plants. Generally, SCP-5954\u2019s personality can be described as cooperative but temperamental, preferring things to be done a certain way.\n\n\nHistory:\n Although claiming to have lived for several centuries in \u201cThe Kingdom of Elrich\u201d SCP-5954\u2019s existence only became known to the Foundation following its emergence from the Atlantic Ocean on 09/18/1981.\n\n\nIts explosive by-product was pronounced, causing damage to several civilian structures and multiple casualties before Mobile Task Force Psi-7 could be scrambled in response. Following containment, the damage was attributed to a violent waterspout triggering a gas leak.\n\n\nSurvivors were admitted to Safe Contour Therapy Practitioners, a Foundation front, where they were convinced what they saw was the result of traumatic psychosis. The stigma of mental illness is believed to be enough to ensure their continued silence on the incident.\n\n\n\n\nContainment\u00a0Log\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface:\n Agents of Psi-7 were transported via helicopter to Miami Beach, where police reports of a \u2018bomb-throwing garden shed\u2019 had been reported alongside widespread urban destruction. Transcript begins following their drop-off as they followed the trail of damage and fire to SCP-5954\u2019s location.\n\n\n<Begin log>\n\n\nEkblad:\n Command, this is Commander Calvin Ekblad, we\u2019ve arrived on the beach, over.\n\nCommand: Confirmed. Check in, all agents, over.\n\n\nBjugstad:\n Bjugstad here, looks like a lot of churned-up sand. See a few beach towels, umbrellas, but doesn\u2019t look like there were a lot of people here. Lifeguard stand is toast, over.\n\n\nDam:\n Hannah Dam checking in. Just finished inspecting the surf, there\u2019s a trail of seaweed dragged out of the water and onto the sand. But it stops right by a crater in the sand, like someone buried a grenade after pulling the pin, over.\n\n\nJefferson:\n Blah blah, Chuck Jefferson, over. Dam, you don\u2019t know a damned thing about grenades. For one thing, you wouldn\u2019t have time to bury it after you pulled the pin, not least because the depth you\u2019d need to make the crater this size\u2019d be-\n\n\nDam:\n I wasn\u2019t speaking in any professional capacity on craters or bombs, I think we all know how metaphors work.\n\n\nJefferson:\n Do they? I\u2019ve never heard a metaphor that worked as intended. Similes, on the other hand-\n\n\nEkblad:\n Enough. There\u2019s an arm sticking out of the beach here.\n\n\nBjugstad:\n Anybody attached?\n\n\nEkblad:\n Negative. Only identifying marks\u2026 paint on the remaining nails, with ring tan on a finger. Let\u2019s move out. Nothing more we can do here. We can inspect the scene after the skip is inert. Command, you reading us still, over?\n\n\nCommand:\n Loud and clear. Proceed with the mission. Law enforcement is evacuating the area.\n\n\nEkblad:\n Perfect. Thank you, over.\n\n\nBjugstad:\n Command, we\u2019re heading out to the street. Not as much obvious destruction, apart from scorch marks and what\u2019s left of a fire hydrant, over.\n\n\nDam:\n There\u2019s no remains left, looks like it's losing pressure too.\n\n\nJefferson:\n Char marks smell like methane. Collecting some of the residue.\n\n\nEkblad:\n I\u2019ve got visual contact. Directly ahead of us.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Help! I beseech any listener, won\u2019t anyone provide assistance?\n\n\nEkblad:\n Bjugs, initiate communication. I\u2019ve got you covered.\n\n\nBjugstad approaches SCP-5954\n\n\nBjugstad:\n Do you understand me?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Haven\u2019t I just summoned you? Of course. Recognize your betters, fair sir. Although who can really speak of betters, when one is in crisis? I will accept whatever can be done to assist in mitigating my condition.\n\n\nBjugstad:\n What is your condition?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Oh, the dreadful state of this hovel shouldn\u2019t have come to pass. My sincerest apologies. These eruptions are beyond my control. My arrival here came only after a failed attempt by Royal Gardeners to arrest its perpetuation.\n\n\nBjugstad:\n Can you speak in plain terms? And we\u2019re willing to assist you, if you come with us willingly.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Haven\u2019t I already denigrated my own capacity by speaking in this tongue? In any case, I shall come by my own power with the only caveat being that my medical condition and any related outburst is beyond my control.\n\n\nDam:\n Command, we might need extraction by sea. The anomaly-\n\n\nSCP-5954\u2019s lower body is ruptured by an explosion, scorching a mailbox while incinerating its content, shattering the glass facades of several nearby businesses, and spraying dead seaweed onto the Psi-7 agents.\n\n\nDam:\n \u2026 The anomaly would not be suited for air transport.\n\n\nJefferson:\n I like this one. Can we keep it?\n\n\n</End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Dr. Chelsea Elliot was flown in from the United States following SCP-5954\u2019s containment, as her expertise in anomalous vegetation was relevant to studying SCP-5954. The following transcript is from an interview which took place directly before Incident 5954-H.\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nElliot:\n Good morning, 5954.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n I know it\u2019s protocol, but I still would very much prefer to be called by my title.\n\n\nElliot:\n We can\u2019t rehash this every time I sit down to speak with you. It was difficult enough to convince my higher-ups that to give you the respect of using the title in written communications.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Ah, yes, that consideration is very much appreciated. Has there been any postage from Elra Royal Gardens to inquire as to my condition?\n\n\nElliot:\n You know I can\u2019t tell you that.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Ah, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll hear from the Gardeners somehow. Wasn\u2019t ever good at keeping out of their sight, not even as a bud.\n\n\nElliot:\n Speaking of buds, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re not happy with the plants you\u2019ve been allowed to care for. Is that right, 5954?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n It\u2019s not that I\u2019m unhappy with the allowance, more so that I can feel the pain of so many poor sufferings accumulating throughout this municipality.\n\n\nElliot:\n I sympathize. Sometimes I walk through the cubicles here and wonder what people are thinking, leaving their houseplants half-dead.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n \nRecoiling\n What? You mean to say\u2026 no, you cannot mean that the servants and workers allowed to make residence in this fortification are, forsake me, causing these feelings of pain and torment?\n\n\nElliot:\n Oh, erm, not on purpose. Some of them take very good care of their plants. I know I do.\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Please, Dr. Elliot, please leave me at least until evening. Give me the time to fathom what my understanding has wrought upon emotion.\n\n\nElliot:\n I\u2019m sorry, I really am. I\u2019ll be back to finish up tonight. We can talk about ways to help these plants out, okay?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Very well.\n\n\n</End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident 5954-H\n\n\nOn 04/12/1984, SCP-5954\u2019s containment chamber was checked as part of standard security protocols and found to be vacant. A subsequent search of Site-77\u2019s upper levels found that all houseplants in the personnel work and living spaces had also vanished.\n\n\nBoth SCP-5954 and the missing plants were subsequently re-discovered back inside of its containment chamber.\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Debriefing\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n I still cannot comprehend how you, of all the wisest I have known in this land, could possibly be upset with how this all turned out.\n\n\nElliot:\n You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Ferda, what if your\u2026 medical condition flared up out there? Someone could\u2019ve gotten hurt. What if you\u2019d burned a shrubbery?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n The regimen that your brilliant mind constructed has kept me almost incident-free for several circuits around your great star-orb. If your soldiers hadn\u2019t perchance gazed upon my vacated quarters for another sixteenth-of-an-hour then my rescue of these beleaguered souls would have been unnoticed for a fortnight.\n\n\nElliot:\n You can\u2019t just go taking other people\u2019s things. We were working together to help take care of them, right? What happened to that?\n\n\nSCP-5954:\n Just look at this Hoya! (\nSCP-5954 produces a wilting Hoya plant\n) It\u2019s been given a potting far too restricting for its magnitude, why, I was surprised its roots hadn\u2019t grown in knots given the lack of space!

Another thing, this fern, I found it completely covered in bugs! Even with all of my considerable tenderness and care it may yet be beyond my ability to save.\n\n\nElliot:\n Oh, that poor thing. I\u2019ll see if I can get it some more help. But still. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to come and go as you please.
