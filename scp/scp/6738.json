Task force is to apprehend SCP-6738 no more than 24 hours prior to the new moon lunar phase; if feasible, task force is to bring SCP-6738 to Site-804\n2\n until cessation of anomalous activity. SCP-6738 is to be tagged and released after reverting to its avian body plan.\n\n\nFollowing the termination or natural death of current SCP-6738 instance, MTF Lambda-4 (\"Birdwatchers\") is to be mobilized along coastlines in an expanding radius to locate the new instance. Procedures to expediently identify SCP-6738 outside of the new moon lunar phase are currently infeasible.\n\n\nPer Boring Agreement, avian corpora discarded by SCP-6738 may be donated to GoI-466 ('Wilson's Wildlife Solutions') at discretion of research team, or otherwise stored at Zoological Facility-AV-\u03b3\n3\n. All remaining corpora are to be destroyed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6738 is a \nConsolamentum\n-Type\n4\n therianthropic entity, specifically manifesting with the body plan of a seabird. During a period up to sixteen hours coinciding with the onset of the new moon, SCP-6738 anatomically transmutes from an avian into a human being. This transmutation is not voluntary or controlled.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-6738 has manifested as at least nine separate species of seabird, SCP-6738 always manifests as the same human corpus; identifying as 'Ketill Ketilsson', mid-30s male of Icelandic descent.\n\n\nOnly one instance of SCP-6738 is believed to exist at any point in time. Instances manifest after death of previous corpus and before the next new moon; the species manifested tends to match species with native range near or within the region of previous instance's death.\n\n\nAddendum- List of Corpora\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6738-1, preserved by Dr. Ennis Menzies\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6738-1\n\n\nAcquired:\n 25/06/1968\n\n\nSpecies:\n \nAlca torda\n ('Razor-billed auk')\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6738-1 was identified on 27/04/1968 in the village of North Tolsta, on the Scottish island of Lewis and Harris. An inconsolable human speaking a Nordic language was found by residents of the town, naked and crying on a coastal bluff. Believing him to be the survivor of a shipwreck, a resident welcomed subject into her home awaiting authorities. As police were transporting subject to an interpreter, SCP-6738-1 (who was reported as being distressed during the car ride) reverted to an avian form and escaped out of the car window.\n\n\nThis event would attract minimal Foundation attention after being reported in tabloid newspapers jocularly as a 'were-gull', until a near identical event occurred 25/06/1968; in which SCP-6738 reentered avian form while inside an Aberdeen City Police station and assaulted a constable. Amnestic protocol was administered to officers and object was transferred to containment at Zoological Facility-AV.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Log\u00a0#003\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6738 Log #003, \n26/07/1968\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-6738 has just entered humanoid corpus after a month in Zoo Facility-AV.
