The location of this locker is to be at least 20 meters from any biological laboratories or Foundation gravesites.\n\n\nPersonnel with Level-2 or above security clearance may access SCP-3226 for experimentation. Prior to any testing of SCP-3226, written authorization must be provided by a researcher currently assigned to the object.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3226 is a pair of plastic headphones with a purple matte finish. A yellow graphic of a smiling skull is present on the outside of each speaker. SCP-3226 does not possess any identifiable method of audio input. Power is supplied by a pair of AAA batteries housed in a compartment over the left speaker; an on/off switch is present on this compartment.\n\n\nThe box SCP-3226 was originally packaged in promotes the contents as \"HEADBONES\", subtitled with the text: \"Hear What Your Skeleton Has To Say!!\". No information pertaining to a manufacturer is present. The back of the box is printed with the following:\n\n\n\n\nX-rays let you see bones, but haven't you and your friends always wanted to HEAR them?! Now you can with HEADBONES\u2122, the only way to hear what your skeleton has to say!! Just put them on, flip the switch, and you'll finally live the dream of listening to the AWESOME SOUNDS that all-natural bones make!!\n\n\nYour bones are SPECIAL, because no one else has your bones!! What better way to get that nice, relaxing tingle down your spine than to listen to something you'll ALWAYS have around you?!\n\n\nDon't be a LAZY BONES!! Try on a pair of HEADBONES\u2122 today!!\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-3226 is powered on and worn, its wearer perceives a loud grating sound coming from all moving human skeletal joints within 20 meters, including their own.\n\n\nSounds heard while wearing SCP-3226 cannot be detected with external instruments and seem to exist only in the mind of the wearer. Larger joints (e.g., knee joints) produce louder sounds than smaller joints (e.g., finger joints). The sound has been described by test subjects as akin to \"nails on a chalkboard\" or a \"rusted door hinge\", typically causing distress or mild annoyance but in some cases has resulted in severe nausea and headaches.\n\n\nIf a wearer has worn SCP-3226 consistently for an extended period of time without removal,\n1\n the individual will perceive the motion of any nearby mandible joints (including their own) as shrill speech containing complaints of excess warmth and being smothered. \nSpeech ceases with cessation of mandible movement.\n (Revised, see addenda.)\n\n\nIn several cases, wearers have additionally reported hearing sensual moans and other \"erotic noises\" originating from nearby skeletal remains. When such vocalizations can be heard via SCP-3226, the object will vibrate intensely until worn by a human or distanced from the remains (see addenda for experimental observations).\n\n\nAddendum SCP-3226-1:\n Example experimentation involving SCP-3226 in close proximity to remains of a deceased human individual.\n\n\nExperiment SCP-3226-14 involves a single D-Class personnel member, D-4689, stationed in a cell below a soundproofed single-chamber crematorium oven housing a nonanomalous corpse. During the experiment there are no other personnel within a 20 meter radius of D-4689; the experimental room is monitored via CCTV cameras.\n\n\nD-4689 is fully restrained (bodily and with additional wire support at the jaw) to prevent joint motion except at right wrist. D-4689 is instructed to listen to sounds from SCP-3226, and to raise his right hand upon hearing any recognizable speech. D-4689 does this approximately 2 hours after SCP-3226 is turned on. 30 minutes later, the crematorium oven is remotely activated. After another 30 minutes, SCP-3226 is removed and D-4689 is unrestrained and interviewed.\n\n\nThe following is a portion of the post-experiment interview transcript of subject D-4689.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, skip to 00h-03m-01s>\n\n\nD-4689:\n\u00a0For hours and hours there was just this\u2026 scraping sound. I heard it each time I breathed in or out. I think my ribs felt a little weird then. Kind of shivery and tingly, but not in a great way.\n\n\nDr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\u00a0At approximately two hours in you raised your right hand. What do you recall hearing then?\n\n\nD-4689:\n\u00a0There was this nasty voice all the sudden. Kinda like the scraping noise, but suddenly it was words. Kept saying it was all wrapped up in something\u2026 Christ. And my wrist made an awful scrapey sound too when I moved it.\n\n\nDr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\u00a0Do you remember its exact words?\n\n\nD-4689:\n\u00a0Yeah\u2026 Yeah, it said \"All wrapped up. Let\u2019s take it off.\" Just those two sentences over and over for a few minutes. Sounded really close up, like it was inside my head. Made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Then it\u2026 changed.\n\n\nDr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\u00a0Please continue.\n\n\nD-4689:\n\u00a0It went quiet for a little while. I thought it was over, but then it started again. It still sounded awful, but I think it was\u2026 satisfied? Relaxed? Started saying, \"Oh yeah\" and moaning over and over 'til the headphones cut out. Never said anything else. \n[pause]\n I really don\u2019t want to do this test again.\n\n\nDr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\u00a0Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-3226-2:\n During a transfer from containment at Site-\u2588\u2588 to the recently renovated Site-\u2588\u2588, SCP-3226 was noted to vibrate intensely while the Foundation motorcade passed through the intersection of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The object\u2019s power switch was in the off position at this time.\n\n\nTwo days later, Dr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588 and field agents returned to the intersection with SCP-3226 under the guise of road workers replacing a damaged water pipe. SCP-3226 again vibrated with frequency increasing with proximity to the intersection\u2019s center. Dr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588 donned and activated SCP-3226, upon which vibration ceased and a \u201cflirtatious beckoning\u201d voice was heard instructing Dr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588 to \u201ccome over\u201d and \u201cget naked with me\u201d while moaning intermittently.\n\n\nSkeletal remains of a 30-40 year old man, estimated to have been buried for 20 years, were found approximately 1.5 meters beneath the intersection\u2019s center. After in site analysis showed the remains to be nonanomalous, local police were notified of their presence.\n\n\nUse of SCP-3226 for Foundation recovery missions is pending approval.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-3226-3:\n On 15/04/2013, Dr. K\u2588\u2588\u2588 received the following letter at her personal residence. No return address was present and attempts to identify the sender have thus far been unsuccessful. Of note, the envelope the letter was sent in appeared to be clumsily-handled, with an additional excess of postage stamps.\n\n\n\n\nGreetings valued HEADBONES\u2122 user!!\n\n\nYou\u2019ve used your HEADBONES\u2122 a lot, so we hope you\u2019ve enjoyed them as much as we do!!
