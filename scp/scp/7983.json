SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 are to be kept under remote surveillance at separate, low-staff Foundation facilities away from major population centers. These facilities are as follows:\n\n\nSCP-7983-1\n | \u2588-BLOCK in Res. Site-45, Indian Ocean\n\n\nSCP-7983-2\n | Site-120 Outpost-3, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Poland\n\n\nSCP-7983-3\n | Observation Post Nemo at Point Nemo\n\n\nSCPs are to be contained under a two-factor biometric lock and rotating staff. All other non-essential roles in containment should be highly automated, as outlined under TAK\n1\n Procedures. If access to SCPs-7983-1, 2, and/or 3 is deemed necessary, the relevant Level 4 Personnel will arrange the delivery of a biological sample to arrive within 3-14 business days.\n2\n\n\nSCP-7983 itself provides minor security risk. Radio Frequency (RF) Shielding should be used to prevent dissemination of SCP\u2019s lure via fake radio advert while in containment. Should it manifest, SCP-7983 can be contained in any sealed room tall enough to house it. It is \neither unable or\n unwilling to break through even weak barriers, such as annealed or tempered glass.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7983 is an entity resembling the cereal mascot \u201cClover\u201d from popular kids cereal Magic Munchos. It stands 2.5 meters tall (8 foot 3 inches) when hunched, with misproportioned arms and legs and a tall, broad-brimmed top hat contributing to its height. Its leprechaun mimicry is not incidental, as an update to Clover\u2019s design on Magic Munchos boxes in 2010 prompted a similar change in SCP-7983 in all subsequent manifestations\n3\n. The entity\u2019s dress is in faded imitation of Clover\u2019s, that being: a dirty green swallow-tailed evening coat, red and white striped stockings, and green curled-point poulaine shoes. \nCorroborating accounts from product developer John Holanah and character artist Maysa Jaziri at General Mills disprove the theory that Clover\u2019s original design in 1964 was inspired by SCP-7983, and not vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7983-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to manifestation, cursory tests suggest SCP-7983 occupies base reality in the form of high-compression radio waves\n4\n (the complexity therein having given rise to some form of intelligence). Manifestation is triggered upon the collection of the 3 marking totems (the aforementioned SCPs-7983-1 through 3). SCPs-7983-1 through 3 are miniature plastic \u201cleprechaun\u201d figurines with no anomalous properties, save for their link to SCP-7983. Each figurine has distinctive headwear and facial hair, as well as a \u201cMade in China\u201d sticker on the base, despite no known manufacturer being found. Figurines first appeared in unlabeled Magic Muchos cereal boxes as part of SCP-7983\u2019s \u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d radio lure in 2005 (see \u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d Radio Lure, 2005).\n\n\nUpon manifestation, SCP-7983 will exhibit a hostile ontokinetic response (See Interview Log | LEVEL 0 PERSONNEL). Care should be taken to ensure distance is maintained at all times between the entity and essential Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d Radio Lure, 2005\n\n\nFoundation involvement with SCP-7983 began in March 2005 following reports of an anomalous radio advert for Magic Munchos cereal, airing between the hours of 2:00 and 5:00 AM for 3 consecutive days in select states along the American east coast. The contents of the ad, later denounced by General Mills, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCartoon sound FX. Minor audio distortions throughout.\n\n\nNice try, leprechaun! No Magic Munchos for you! Magic Munchos! Part of a complete breakfast. And introducing the Wee Folk Challenge. Find all three of the leprechaun\u2019s friends in boxes of Magic Munchos and win the biiiiiiig prize.\n\n\n\n\nShortly after airing, reports of SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 appearing in Magic Munchos cereal boxes were investigated with unusual interest by Foundation personnel\n5\n, considering the perceived threat level and lack of information present. These investigations later led to the recovery of footage documenting SCP-7983\u2019s first known appearance.\n\n\n\n\n2005 ROAD FOOTAGE\n\n\n\n\nThe following footage was recovered outside a stalled vehicle on the side of the road in late March, two days after the 2005 lure was broadcast. Recorded on Sony Handycam, its final moments briefly depict SCP-7983 approaching the camera\n6\n. SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 were found in the vehicle\u2019s glove compartment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d Radio Lure, 2020\n\n\nIn 2020, 15 years after the initial lure, a second string of fake radio adverts for Magic Munchos aired over the course of one week in March. The contents of the ad remained unchanged from the 2005 broadcast, again announcing the unsanctioned \u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d and a prize reward. Immediately prior to the 2020 broadcast, SCPs-7983-1 through 3 were removed from containment at Site-\u2588\u2588 without the Foundation\u2019s knowledge, in culmination of a series of unexplained security breaches undertaken by Foundation personnel (see Interview Log | MTFC FINN ELSHER). SCPs were recovered after the one-week broadcast period from the remains of a Foundation technician, after which TAK Procedures were put in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7983 looking at the camera during interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports of SCP-7983 were made by several east coast residents throughout the broadcast week. Most encounters occurred in private residences and left no witnesses, however the actions of an employee at a 24-hour convenience store in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New Jersey resulted in SCP-7983\u2019s manifestation being caught on the in-store security cameras. Mobile Task Force Lambda-8 was deployed on a scrub mission, but faulty equipment left the security system\u2019s backups intact, later causing footage of the incident to leak online. To contain the leak, the Foundation engaged in an extensive disinformation campaign. This in large part consisted of flooding the Internet with spurious firsthand accounts attesting to \u201cevil leprechauns\u201d and related folklore, as well as the dissemination of obviously doctored AIC-generated images. With such a vast quantity of related media, recognition of SCP-7983\u2019s true appearance is unlikely\n7\n.\n\n\nInterview Logs\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0|\u00a0MTFC\u00a0FINN\u00a0ELSHER\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0|\u00a0MTFC\u00a0FINN\u00a0ELSHER\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 20th, 2005\n\n\nInterviewee:\n MTFC Finn Elsher\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Noah Bodin\n\n\nNotes:\n Shortly after deployment of MTF Lambda-6 in the 2005 Road Footage incident, Mobile Task Force Commander (MTFC) Finn Elsher was caught attempting to break into a strongbox containing SCP-7983-2. SCPs-7983-1 and 3 were later recovered from Elsher\u2019s staff locker.

It is presumed SCP-7983 manifested in response to the 3 totems and had just dealt with the technician when the Level 0 Personnel arrived. The worker was alone with SCP-7983 for 3 minutes before help arrived, after which time she showed symptoms indicative of a severe ontokinetic attack.

That response actually suggests some level of comprehension to me. I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big prize?\u201d It responds as if saying, \u201c\nFirst\n, find all three of the leprechaun\u2019s friends.\u201d It makes a kind of logical sense. It could be taking shots in the dark, though.

Hand me the Captain Munch, I\u2019d like to try something, please.\n\n\nDr. Bodin is given an unopened box of Captain Munch cereal depicting the brand\u2019s mascot, Captain Munch. Dr. Bodin refills his bowl. Without alerting Foundation personnel, he throws the box at SCP-7983\u2019s cell. It hits the glass wall and bounces off with no effect. SCP-7983 takes one step back.\n\n\nDr. Bodin:\n Got you.\n\n\nDr. Bodin is disciplined by Containment Team personnel.\n\n\n[SECTION OMITTED]\n\n\nDr. Bodin:\n It doesn\u2019t like Captain Munch. Maybe he\u2019s out there, too. I\u2019m done. How do I turn this off?\n\n\nSCP-7983 (VIA RADIO):\n \nNo Magic Munchos for you! No Magic Munchos for you!\n\n\nDr. Bodin:\n Yeah, yeah\u2013\n\n\nAt this point the hand radio of the Containment Team Leader next to Dr. Bodin goes off, startling both her and the doctor.\n\n\nSCP-7983 (VIA HAND RADIO):\n \nNo Magic Munchos for you!\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-7983-001:\n\n\nA proposal submitted by Dr. Noah Bodin outlining plans for the destruction of SCPs-7983-1 through 3 has been summarily denied following the doctor\u2019s insistence that he personally facilitate the destruction. Along with Dr. Bodin\u2019s repeated requests for less structured interviews with SCP-7983, such insistence falls under his own negative criteria for assessing Foundation individuals who could prove a threat to the containment of SCPs-7983-1 through 3 (see \u201cIn The Event of My Ruin: Reflections & Suggestions Concerning the Compromise of Foundation Personnel\u201d, 2006). Dr. Bodin has been put on watch and transferred to a research position on \nSCP-7037\n prior to its installment in the Overseer Hall.\n\n\nAddendum-7983-002:\n\n\nSCP-7983-2 was removed from containment at Site-120 Outpost-3 without Foundation approval in the early morning of February 26th, 2023. A search is ongoing. Dr. Bodin could not be reached for questioning.\n\n\nAddendum-7983-003:\n\n\nOn March 17th, 2023, a new string of fake Magic Munchos adverts began airing across the United States. These broadcasts again advertised the \u201cWee Folk Challenge\u201d, and lasted for approximately 1 month.\n\n\nRequests for the allocation of more resources to containing SCP-7983 have been denied, on account of all associated personnel insisting more studies of SCPs-7983-1 and 3 be conducted \u201cin-person\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nT\nhrow \nA\nway the \nK\ney; see \u201cSafety Without Numbers\u201d by Dr. Noah Bodin.\n\n\n2\n. It should be noted that the goal of containment for SCPs-7983-1 through 3 is \nnot\n to keep them in, it is to keep compromised Foundation personnel \nout\n.\n\n\n3\n. In March 2010 General Mills made minor cosmetic updates to Clover\u2019s outfit as depicted on boxes of Magic Munchos. Included among these changes was the removal of the character\u2019s green scarf. Subsequent manifestations of SCP-7983 following these changes confirmed the matching disappearance of the entity\u2019s green scarf.\n\n\n4\n. The theory that SCP-7983\u2019s origins can be traced to the storage of a VTG Fonovox radio within a compromised Scranton Box in Site-\u2588\u2588, while not discredited, has fallen out of favor among Foundation researchers.\n\n\n5\n. \u201cThe tenacious and, frankly, unprofessional interest shown by ground personnel in the first 2005 radio lure, and in particular the discoveries of SCPs-7983-1 through 3, was the first sign to me and my colleagues that we were dealing with something that affected our own behavior.\u201d ~ Dr. Noah Bodin.\n\n\n6\n. The driver was reported missing the following morning and declared dead in absentia in 2012.\n\n\n7\n. While the incident has largely passed into urban legend, personnel are obligated to monitor the work of any artists whose representations come \ndisturbingly close\n to reality.\n\n\n8\n. A sense of \u201cnot belonging\u201d is characteristic in those suffering an ontokinetic attack. Local reality is distorted until a certain threshold or \u201ctipping point\u201d is reached, after which the space becomes entirely governable by the entity. Prior to this tipping point, it is not uncommon for a victim to feel like they \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d in local space, as their existence in the entity\u2019s forthcoming reality takes precedence in their mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7982\n | SCP-7983 | \nSCP-7984\n \u00bb",

    "description": "SCP-7983 is an entity resembling the cereal mascot \u201cClover\u201d from popular kids cereal Magic Munchos. It stands 2.5 meters tall (8 foot 3 inches) when hunched, with misproportioned arms and legs and a tall, broad-brimmed top hat contributing to its height. Its leprechaun mimicry is not incidental, as an update to Clover\u2019s design on Magic Munchos boxes in 2010 prompted a similar change in SCP-7983 in all subsequent manifestations3. The entity\u2019s dress is in faded imitation of Clover\u2019s, that being: a dirty green swallow-tailed evening coat, red and white striped stockings, and green curled-point poulaine shoes. Corroborating accounts from product developer John Holanah and character artist Maysa Jaziri at General Mills disprove the theory that Clover\u2019s original design in 1964 was inspired by SCP-7983, and not vice versa.",
