The necessity of terminating the last known carrier of SCP-7477 is currently being debated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7477 is a viral cognitohazard incubating in organisms attempting to determine a solution to a complicated problem or project (as defined by the affected individual). SCP-7477 is capable of infecting organisms who are not working on such a problem, in which case it will latch onto an applicable problem when the organism begins working on it. SCP-7477 has displayed extreme versatility in hosts, able to affect both human and non-human organisms.\n\n\nBased upon what information can be gathered and testimony from the sole surviving carrier of SCP-7477, when a viable solution to the associated problem is reached by an infected carrier, SCP-7477 detonates. At this time, the head of the affected organism will spontaneously explode. The force of the explosion exponentially scales with the size of the affected organism's head; a human head explodes with force roughly equal to a grenade, whereas an affected blue whale's head exploded with force equivalent to 10\u00a0kT of TNT.\n\n\nIndividuals who observe the process of SCP-7477 detonating, interact with the physical remains of a carrier (especially the head) or otherwise interact in a first-hand capacity with the SCP-7477 explosion or its effects become infected with SCP-7477. If information regarding SCP-7477 is significantly distorted, the cognitohazardous properties fade. For example, the ashes of victim's heads do not carry the effect.\n\n\n\n\nLEVEL\u00a05\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nKNOWN\u00a0ACTIVE\u00a0SCP-7477\u00a0CARRIERS\n\n\n\n\nThe final carrier of SCP-7477 is the Gnostic Monad. It was infected as a result of its omniscience upon the initial manifestation of SCP-7477, which it has identified as a malicious plot of the Demiurge and a corruption of the emanations. It has relayed to the Foundation the details surrounding its infection and as a result has been designated as SCP-7477-\u221e.\n\n\nWhile SCP-7477-\u221e is theoretically capable of neutralizing SCP-7477 through its omnipotence, its affected project is the best way to neutralize SCP-7477. Therefore, SCP-7477-\u221e is incapable of determining a method of neutralizing SCP-7477.\n\n\nSCP-7477-\u221e has recognized that it is both temporally transcendent and omnipotent. SCP-7477-\u221e has also recognized that \u2014 being noncorporeal and unassociated with the physical universe \u2014 SCP-7477-\u221e does not have a head which could explode. Despite these factors, SCP-7477-\u221e claims that it remains unwilling to neutralize the anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-7477-\u221e apologizes for the inconvenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7476\n | SCP-7477 | \nSCP-7478\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7477\n\" by stormbreath, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
