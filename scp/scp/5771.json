Personnel must use the decontamination shower before leaving the containment area in order to avoid spore spread. Failure to do this will result in immediate disciplinary action.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5771 is an organic humanoid creature measuring approximately 30.48 meters in height, with a cephalic region resembling a mushroom of the \nAmanita pantherina\n species. The creature possesses a light brown convex cap with raised scales and free, white gills.\n\n\nSCP-5771 has a body resembling that of a human skeleton. Tissue samples have determined that its structure is composed of its own stalk material and the thorax of the creature is composed of the ring of the fungus. The creature also does not appear to have any facial features, however it reacts to visual and auditory stimuli. The means in which SCP-5771 uses to see and hear is currently unknown.\n\n\nSCP-5771 constantly emits white spores. When these spores are inhaled, it results in spontaneous respiratory arrest. Death occurs within 3 minutes in most cases.\n\n\nWhen approached by a human, SCP-5771 will crouch down in front of them. This was originally believed to be a hostile stance, SCP-5771 attempting to get its spores closer to the subject in order to induce symptoms quicker. In reality, this stance is an attempt on SCP-5771's part to appear less threatening to humans by reducing its stature.\n1\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5771-A, Discovery:\n\nSCP-5771 was discovered by the Foundation on 22/02/2020 after being sighted at a National Park in south-eastern California. Any civilians present were immediately administered with class-A amnestics. The 18 discovered civillian victims were reported as suicides to their families and no autopsies took place on the bodies.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5771-B, Test log:\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 29/02/2020\n\n\nTest 5771-001:\n A laboratory mouse contained in a standard barred rodent cage was placed in SCP-5771's containment cell in order to observe the effects of the spores on non-human creatures.\n\n\nResults:\n The mouse was unharmed. An interesting observation, however, is how interested in the animal SCP-5771 appeared to be, not moving its head away from the cage and seemingly watching it intently for the full 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 15/04/2020\n\n\nTest 5771-002:\n D-2304 was introduced to SCP-5771's containment to collect tissue for microscopic analysis. D-2304 was wearing level-2 hazmat gear.\n\n\nResults:\n Due to the sheer amount of spores SCP-5771 produces, some of the saturated air managed to bypass D-2304's hazmat gear. D-2304 suffered respiratory arrest and expired exactly 3 minutes after exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice:\n Following this test, all personnel entering SCP-5771's containment cell must be equipped with level-4 hazmat gear. - Site-95 Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5771-C, Test 003:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0TO\u00a0PROCEED\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 22/06/2020\n\n\nTest 5771-003:\n Dr. Zaretsky has suggested using biodata sonification to observe whether or not microcurrent fluctuations occur in SCP-5771 as they do in non-anomalous living organisms.\n\n\nResults:\n The electrodes to SCP-5771's feet were successfully attached without difficulty. Once the biodata sonification device was turned on, almost immediately, microcurrent fluctuations were detected.\n\n\nHowever, alongside the expected noises that were produced, a deep pitched, slightly static voice was audible. This voice stated the following: \n\"Nature\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026 Nature\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026why?\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5771-D, Interview Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0TO\u00a0PROCEED\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 24/06/2020\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [SCP-5771]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [Dr. Mabel Zaretsky, Senior Researcher and Mycologist at Site-95.]\n\n\nForeword:\n During this interview, Dr. Zaretsky will be in a level-4 hazmat suit. SCP-5771 has been attached to the biodata sonification device without incident.\n\n\n<Begin Log, >\n\n\nZaretsky:\n \n-Is it on?

I have submitted a request to authorize further interviews with SCP-5771. - Dr. Zaretsky\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log 5771-001:\n Upon concluding the interview, SCP-5771 attempted to pick up Dr. Zaretsky. Zaretsky reacted to this with a shriek, which appeared to startle 5771, causing it to release its grip and drop her approximately 5m.\n\n\n5771 did not attempt to do this again and Zaretsky was able to get into the decontamination shower room, where infirmary staff were able to safely retrieve her.\n\n\nZaretsky was treated for a broken left wrist, fractures in her left ankle, left arm and left elbow and some other minor sprain injuries, but was otherwise okay. She is expected to be able to return to work within 6 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 25/06/2020\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [Dr. Danielle Baker, Researcher and Botanist at Site-95]\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [SCP-5771]\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-5771 has sat in the same place in its containment cell since incident 5771-001 occurred. Dr. Baker has been equipped with a device that will emit a sudden noise if SCP-5771 gets within 1m of it.\n3\n\n\n<begin log>\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n 5771, tell me in your own words what happened yesterday.\n\n\nSCP-5771:\n \n\u2026human\u2026where\u2026friend\u2026?\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n In a hospital bed.

She was sat there in the damn bed asking if you were ok whilst they were fixing up her arm. She'll be back after she\u2019s healed, I bet.

As Zaretsky has also stated it seemed unintentional, and SCP-5771 did not attempt the same behaviour again, there is sufficient evidence that this is the case. No further action is needed on this matter. - Dr. Baker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 20/08/2020\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [Dr. Zaretsky, Senior Researcher and Mycologist at Site-95]\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [SCP-5771]\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Zaretsky has recovered from incident 5771-001.

        "Addendum 5771-A, Discovery: SCP-5771 was discovered by the Foundation on 22/02/2020 after being sighted at a National Park in south-eastern California. Any civilians present were immediately administered with class-A amnestics. The 18 discovered civillian victims were reported as suicides to their families and no autopsies took place on the bodies.",

        "Date: 29/02/2020 Test 5771-001: A laboratory mouse contained in a standard barred rodent cage was placed in SCP-5771's containment cell in order to observe the effects of the spores on non-human creatures. Results: The mouse was unharmed. An interesting observation, however, is how interested in the animal SCP-5771 appeared to be, not moving its head away from the cage and seemingly watching it intently for the full 60 minutes.",
        "Date: 15/04/2020 Test 5771-002: D-2304 was introduced to SCP-5771's containment to collect tissue for microscopic analysis. D-2304 was wearing level-2 hazmat gear. Results: Due to the sheer amount of spores SCP-5771 produces, some of the saturated air managed to bypass D-2304's hazmat gear. D-2304 suffered respiratory arrest and expired exactly 3 minutes after exposure.",
        "Notice: Following this test, all personnel entering SCP-5771's containment cell must be equipped with level-4 hazmat gear. - Site-95 Director",
        "Date: 22/06/2020 Test 5771-003: Dr. Zaretsky has suggested using biodata sonification to observe whether or not microcurrent fluctuations occur in SCP-5771 as they do in non-anomalous living organisms. Results: The electrodes to SCP-5771's feet were successfully attached without difficulty. Once the biodata sonification device was turned on, almost immediately, microcurrent fluctuations were detected. However, alongside the expected noises that were produced, a deep pitched, slightly static voice was audible. This voice stated the following: \"Nature\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026 Nature\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026why?\u2026\"",

SCP-5771 has been attached to the biodata sonification device without incident. <Begin Log, > Zaretsky: -Is it on? Sorry, I'm not used to this newer tape recorder\u2026 is it- oh, it's working. Good\u2026 Ahem. Hello, 5771, my name is Dr. Zaretsky and I will be conducting this interview today. Please can you indicate if you understand me? SCP-5771: \u2026understanding\u2026 Zaretsky: Okay, perfect. Can you tell me where you came from? SCP-5771: \u2026Nature\u2026 Zaretsky: um\u2026 I'm going to need specifics\u2026 you were discovered walking around a National Park, and you seemingly popped out of nowhere. SCP-5771: \u2026Nature\u2026 is\u2026 friend\u2026 Nature\u2026 is\u2026 mother\u2026 grew\u2026 from\u2026 mother\u2026 Zaretsky: Right\u2026 so you grew. But why? What we are trying to find out, 5771 is why a 100ft mushroom suddenly appeared and started walking around. SCP-5771: \u2026Why\u2026 hurt\u2026 mother\u2026? Zaretsky: S-sorry? SCP-5771: \u2026Nature\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026 human\u2026dislike\u2026 nature\u2026? Zaretsky: I like nature. Why do you ask? SCP-5771: \u2026Mother\u2026 is\u2026 sick\u2026 Zaretsky: Are you referring to climate change? SCP-5771: \u2026 mother\u2026 is\u2026 changing?\u2026 yes\u2026mother\u2026 is\u2026 sick\u2026why\u2026hurt\u2026mother\u2026?

Are you saying you don't control your own spores? SCP-5771: \u2026correct\u2026 love\u2026 human\u2026 Zaretsky: Okay\u2026 but you just said we hurt nature.. or mother, whichever it is. Why would you love us if we- [SCP-5771 talks over Zaretsky] SCP-5771: \u2026forgiveness\u2026 human\u2026is\u2026friend\u2026 Zaretsky: um\u2026 well yes, of course we're your\u2026 friends. we don't want to hurt you, 5771. In fact, one of our goals is to protect. SCP-5771: \u2026protect\u2026?\u2026 apologies\u2026 human\u2026 failed\u2026 Zaretsky: \u2026 Are you aware of something we don\u2019t know about? SCP-5771: \u2026friend\u2026please\u2026 protect\u2026 mother\u2026 <End Log> Closing Statement: Although SCP-5771's speech is very broken, from what we can decipher it is clear that it does not have malicious intentions as originally thought. I have submitted a request to authorize further interviews with SCP-5771. - Dr. Zaretsky 2",
        "Incident Log 5771-001: Upon concluding the interview, SCP-5771 attempted to pick up Dr. Zaretsky. Zaretsky reacted to this with a shriek, which appeared to startle 5771, causing it to release its grip and drop her approximately 5m. 5771 did not attempt to do this again and Zaretsky was able to get into the decontamination shower room, where infirmary staff were able to safely retrieve her. Zaretsky was treated for a broken left wrist, fractures in her left ankle, left arm and left elbow and some other minor sprain injuries, but was otherwise okay. She is expected to be able to return to work within 6 weeks.",
        "Date: 25/06/2020 Interviewer: [Dr. Danielle Baker, Researcher and Botanist at Site-95] Interviewed: [SCP-5771] Foreword: SCP-5771 has sat in the same place in its containment cell since incident 5771-001 occurred. Dr. Baker has been equipped with a device that will emit a sudden noise if SCP-5771 gets within 1m of it. 3 <begin log> Dr. Baker: 5771, tell me in your own words what happened yesterday. SCP-5771: \u2026human\u2026where\u2026friend\u2026? Dr. Baker: In a hospital bed. And I'd like to know why. Now. SCP-5771: \u2026love\u2026 friend\u2026 held\u2026 friend\u2026 apologies\u2026 Dr. Baker: That's not an explanation, 5771! We want to know, why! Why would you do that to Mabel after talking about love and friends and all that bullshit for h- [Baker is cut off by the supervisor in her ear piece.] Supervisor: Doctor, enough. It's an interview not an interrogation. SCP-5771: \u2026unintentional\u2026! apologies\u2026! apologies\u2026 many\u2026 apologies\u2026! friend\u2026 nature\u2026 loves\u2026! Friend\u2026 forgives? Dr. Baker: [ sighs ] Lucky for you, Zaretsky\u2019s more forgiving than I am. She was sat there in the damn bed asking if you were ok whilst they were fixing up her arm. She'll be back after she\u2019s healed, I bet. So, you're saying this was an accident, correct? SCP-5771: \u2026Correct\u2026 apologies\u2026 human\u2026 Dr. Baker: Good. That\u2019s all I needed. Any final comment before I leave? SCP-5771: Human\u2026 protect\u2026 friend\u2026 please\u2026 Dr. Baker: \u2026 I will. <End Log> Closing Statement: SCP-5771 has stated that incident 5771-001 was an accident and has apologised. As Zaretsky has also stated it seemed unintentional, and SCP-5771 did not attempt the same behaviour again, there is sufficient evidence that this is the case. No further action is needed on this matter. - Dr. Baker",

(This suit isn't the most comfortable\u2026) SCP-5771: \u2026Forgiven\u2026yes\u2026 Dr. Zaretsky: Thank you, now\u2026 last time, you spoke of \"mother\". What do you mean when you say that?

SCP-5771 confirmed our suspicions that \"Mother\" or \"Nature\" is how it refers to Earth, and in turn, the sickness it describes is how it refers to climate change.
