The containment unit must be shielded from the full spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The vault must be outfitted with shock-dampeners to alleviate seismic tremors (refer to Addendum-002 for details). Monitoring equipment inside the containment chamber is not permitted; powerful signal emissions must be avoided near SCP-4388.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4388 is a set of two multi-socket power strips, individually referred to as SCP-4388-1 and SCP-4388-2. The two objects are identical in design, both containing six inline Type-B sockets and an integrated circuit breaker.\n\n\nSCP-4388 manifests the ability to double the power output of any energy source its cord is subjected to. The six (6) sockets are capable of independently producing the same level of power, regardless of current load. As such, SCP-4388 is capable of producing, in total, twelve (12) times the power of any given input. SCP-4388 presents no apparent resistance; acting as a perfect conductor, there is no power loss while energy is traversing SCP-4388. Likewise, there is no apparent limit to SCP-4388's ampacity, it will match the amperage of any source connected to it, without loss or damage to itself.\n\n\nEnergy created by SCP-4388 will always be in the form of electricity. Experiments have shown that the object is capable of transforming the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum. The input connector does not need to be plugged into an object for this effect to occur. For instance, light shone onto SCP-4388's exposed chord pins will produce electrical power proportional to the light-wave's photonic energy. Additional testing has demonstrated that SCP-4388 is sensitive even to kinetic energy, a physical impact generates equivalent joules in electricity.\n\n\nIt is unknown to what extent SCP-4388 reacts to anomalous energy sources as experimentation of this nature is strictly prohibited (refer to Addendum-002).\n\n\nIf SCP-4388's sockets are unconnected, the power they generate is transferred to the surrounding atmosphere. In the absence of atmosphere, SCP-4388 will heat up and will begin emitting black-body radiation. Even under proper containment, it is not possible to fully mitigate interaction from the following natural sources of energy, all of which have been observed to generate small amounts of additional power:\n\n\n\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field\n\n\nCosmic rays reaching the Earth's surface\n\n\nUniversal background radiation\n\n\nRandom quantum fluctuations\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4388 is nearly impervious to electrical damage and heat. The threshold to damage it with electricity appears to be [DATA EXPUNGED] (refer to Experiment- [1/6/1959]). Wear visible on SCP-4388's plastic casing demonstrates that it is capable of sustaining damage from friction and blunt force. No loss of capabilities resulting from this deterioration has been noted by Site-11 since the object's retrieval.\n\n\nElectrical power generation procedure:\n SCP-4388's anomalous properties can be put to use by providing electricity to Site-11, allowing it to remain self-sustaining\n1\n.\n\n\nWithin its containment vault, SCP-4388 is to be connected to superconducting cables leading to high-capacity electrical couplings outside the vault. When in service, the input cables (coupled to SCP-4388's cord) are to be connected to Site-11's power generators. The output cables (coupled to SCP-4388's sockets) are to be connected to Site-11 electrical grid's capacitors.\n\n\nA computer-monitored circuit breaker must be on available to ground the grid if it detects a spike in power exceeding Site-11's specifications. An analog severing mechanism must be ready to cut off the vault in case of emergencies. Remote signals do not function near SCP-4388 while it is under heavy load and, as such, the mechanism must be activated manually.\n\n\nEmergency procedure:\n Under no circumstances should SCP-4388 form a closed circuit. Should this happen, evacuation of Site-11 is initiated immediately. Technical personnel in charge of the containment unit are instructed to remain on-site to ensure SCP-4388's decoupling.\n\n\nFailure to detach the vault within one (1) minute will lead to ignition of aerosolized Chlorine-Trifluoride on the level housing SCP-4388, disabling any circuitry contained therein.\n\n\nEXPERIMENT LOGS:\n\n\n\n\n+Experiment-[7/5/1959]\n\n\n\n\n-Experiment-[7/5/1959]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher:\n Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n D-85322\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4388-1, SCP-4388-2, and D-85322 are located in a monitored blast shelter.\n\n\nThe shelter is isolated from any power grid and is serviced by a gas-powered generator.\n\n\nD-85322 is instructed to plug SCP-4388-2's cord into SCP-4388-1's first socket and to plug SCP-4388-1 into a 120-Volt power outlet capable of outputting a maximum of 2400 Watts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\nPower generated by SCP-4388-1's five unconnected sockets approaches 11\u00a0250 Watts.\n\n\nPower generated by SCP-4388-2 approaches 54\u00a0000 Watts.\n\n\nRoom temperature rapidly increases to 70\u00b0c and the shelter's ventilation system activates.\n\n\nTest is terminated remotely by shutting down the generator.\n\n\nD-85322 suffers mild hyperthermia but recovers normally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher's note:\n The potential benefits of SCP-4388 for the Foundation are obvious.

Usage of SCP-4388-1 was deemed critical as no major power generation solutions could be deployed urgently on Sukhoy Nos. Due to the nature of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, seismic tremors occurred with regularity on the island.\n\n\nShortly after its arrival, an earthquake rated 6.2 hit the area. The seismic shock triggered an energy release of unprecedented scale by SCP-4388-1. The event affected a radius of 8,7\u00a0km, centered on the object. As the kinetic energy absorbed by SCP-4388-1 during the earthquake was minimal, it is unclear why such a disproportionate release occurred.\n\n\nClass-A amnestics were administered to all surviving witnesses, mostly local indigenous populations outside of the blast zone. A coordinated media release was orchestrated, stating that the detonation was caused by an experimental Soviet nuclear weapon. Radioactive material released on the island served to give credence to this version of events.\n\n\nTransfer of SCP-4388 will no longer be allowed outside of Site-11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
