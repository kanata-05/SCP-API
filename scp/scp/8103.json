Sampling of SCP-8103's bark, leaves, and fruit confirm that the tree itself is non-anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-8103's anomalous effect occurs towards any persons who are experiencing marital or relationship troubles. When any persons who meet this criteria place their palm against SCP-8103 for a period of ten seconds, they will be affected by a cognitohazard that results in them experiencing a moment of clarity, followed by them immediately seeking out ways to make amends in their marriages/relationships.\n\n\nCommonly documented effects of SCP-8103's cognitohazard include:\n\n\n\n\nThe signing up for couples and/or marriage counselling services;\n\n\nThe buying of expensive and/or lavish romantic gifts;\n\n\nMarriage proposals;\n\n\nThe planning of \"romantic getaways\" or \"second honeymoons\";\n\n\nRestructuring of relationships into more \"open\" variants;\n\n\nReinvigoration of self-care methods;\n\n\nand emotional \"opening ups\".\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8103 has led to a marked decrease in divorce rates and break-ups within the Bronx borough of New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8102\n | SCP-8103 | \nSCP-8104\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8103\n\" by newnykacolaquantum, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
