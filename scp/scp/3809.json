A profile is to be developed and disseminated to major law enforcement organizations concerning the hacker known as \u201cMaggie\u201d.\n\n\nAny reports of movements by SCP-3809 by non-Foundation personnel are to be suppressed and reporting individuals amnesticized.\n\n\nTwenty-four-hour surveillance of SCP-3809\u2019s location and activities is to be maintained by Foundation AICs.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-3809 is a fully autonomous artificial intelligence contained within the housing of a communications satellite. SCP-3809 claims to be both a twenty-seven-year-old woman named \u201cMaggie\u201d and also a satellite.\n\n\nThe satellite is capable of adjusting its orbit around the Earth through unknown means. SCP-3809 has maintained geosynchronous orbit above Houston, Texas, USA since the initial event that led to its discovery. It is also capable of computing power far beyond what should be possible given the satellite\u2019s specifications.\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscovery\n: SCP-3809 was discovered when internet activity in the area around Houston, Texas increased exponentially on 8 October, 2020. After Foundation AIC noted an anomalously dramatic upswing in activity, representing the attention of several million separate IP addresses at once, they attempted to trace the source to locate the potential anomalous hacker attack. A DDoS\n1\n attack was considered unlikely as the activity was spread out among every social media server, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Periscope, and YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoel Osteen performing a sermon at Lakewood Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin three hours, the hacker focused entirely on accounts and events centered around Osteen Ministries, including accessing personal information behind firewalls. Osteen Ministries is the Megachurch owned and operated by Pastor Joel Osteen, operated in Houston, Texas out of Lakewood Church.\n2\n In addition to live services, Osteen Ministries offers streaming sermons, lessons, and Bible studies, regularly drawing millions of viewers.\n\n\nDespite the amount of electronic engagement, the AICs traced the activity to only one IP address: that of a communications satellite owned by Keiper Industries, a developing communications conglomerate. At first, Foundation technicians theorized the satellite was utilized as a relay point, but after twenty-four hours of constant surveillance, it was ascertained that the signal originated from the satellite itself.\n\n\nThe satellite, designated SCP-3809, was determined to be acting without external instruction during these events while maintaining its original purpose despite only operating on solar energy.\n3\n Given the limited processing power of the satellite, it is unclear how this activity was accomplished.\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview Logs\n\n\nOn 10 October, 2020, it was discovered that SCP-3809 had access to communication channels that allowed it to make telephone calls. During one such call, the number was traced by Foundation technicians allowing for direct contact to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Transcripts\u00a0of\u00a0Interviews\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 3809.1\n\n\nDate\n: 10/10/2020\n\n\nInterviewing Personnel\n: \nDr. Melody Aswari, PhD \u2013 focusing on machine learning and psychology\n.\n\n\nNote\n: \nGoal of interview was to establish communication and discover the motivations behind SCP-3809\u2019s behavior\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hello? Who is this?\n\n\n[SCP-3809\u2019s voice appears to be highly pitched and female, with inflection similar to the performance of Reese Witherspoon in the films\n Legally Blonde \nand its sequel,\n Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde.\n]\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Hi, my name is Dr. Aswari and I was hoping we could talk a while. I\u2019m with an organization that has been tracking your movements. We were hoping you could clarify some of your behavior in recent months.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Sorry, you\u2019ve been following me? That\u2019s creepy.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: No, I don\u2019t think you understand. You\u2019re very visible in orbit, we just have to pay attention to sensors and ping you with RFID tracking. Um\u2026 you know you\u2019re a satellite, right?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Of course, I know that, I\u2019m not stupid! Look, I\u2019m really busy right now. Did you need something?\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: So, I was hoping you\u2019d chat with me a while so we could understand why you\u2019re doing some of the things you\u2019re doing. Would you be alright with that? What should I call you?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: UGH. I guess. My name is Maggie. What did you want to know?\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: We noticed you\u2019ve been actively maintaining an orbit above Houston, Texas\u2026 Why is that?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: I like the area.\n\n\n[Dr. Aswari does not immediately respond but looks over at her assistant, who shrugs.]\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Okay\u2026 but do you mean the area of orbit you are maintaining, or do you mean you like Houston?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: The second one. Like\u2026 is this a survey or something? I don\u2019t want to buy anything.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: I\u2019m not trying to sell anything, just curious about your behavior. So, moving on. You recently accessed several different social media network servers: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. What were you looking for?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Something to distract me. I mean, hello, this is a pandemic! We\u2019re all just trying to keep sane with some distractions.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t a delicate question, but how does the pandemic affect a satellite?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: It affects everyone differently. Look\u2026 is this almost done?\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Just a couple more questions. What interest do you have in an individual named Joel Osteen?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Oh my god, do you know Joel? Isn\u2019t he just the best?\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: I don\u2019t know him personally, no. We\u2019ve noticed a lot of your activity revolves around Mr. Osteen. Can you tell us why?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Come on, stop it. You\u2019re checking me out for him, right? You guys are friends! Look how sweet he is, trying to see if I'm worth his attention.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: No, liste\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Oh, god I am so excited. He\u2019s finally noticed me! Isn\u2019t he dreamy? Look at that hair! And so pious, I could just eat him up.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Wait, are you saying that you\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Amazing! So much to do! Okay but I have to go, but I hope you send Joel my love. Byeeeeeeee.\n\n\n[The call was terminated.]\n\n\nAfterword\n: \nSubject appears fixated on Mr. Osteen in a romantic fashion. How this occurred is completely unclear\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview 3809.2\n\n\nDate\n: 10/10/2020\n\n\nInterviewing Personnel\n: \nDr. Melody Aswari, PhD \u2013 focusing on machine learning and psychology\n.\n\n\nNote\n: Immediately after subject cut the connection during Interview 3809.1, Dr. Aswari tried to reconnect communication.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hello, this is Maggie.\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Hi, Maggie. We were just cut\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Ah ah, gotcha! This is a voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Beep.\n5\n\n\nDr. Aswari\n: Fuck.\n\n\n[Dr. Aswari disconnected the call.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nSCP-3809 continued its invasive digital activity for the next six weeks, keeping almost constant view on all social media accounts connected to anyone employed at Osteen Ministries or the personal accounts of those close to Mr. Osteen. Interestingly, the AI did not pry into financial records of the ministry or the personal financial accounts of those individuals it was watching. A significant amount of phone calls were made, most of which Foundation technicians were unable to intercept. Below are several transcripts of recorded conversations:\n\n\n\n\nIntercepted Communications\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Transcripts\u00a0of\u00a0Recorded\u00a0Phone\u00a0Calls\u00a0\u25c4\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 21 November, 2020, SCP-3809 contacted Mr. Osteen\u2019s personal assistant, William Friedman, by phone. A transcript is included below:\n\n\n\n\nFriedman\n: Pastor Osteen\u2019s phone, this is William. Who\u2019s this?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hi! My name is Maggie. I\u2019m a huge fan of Joel\u2019s.\n\n\nFriedman\n: How did you get this number? It\u2019s unlisted.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Nothing\u2019s really ever unlisted, silly. Will \u2013 sorry, can I call you Will? I was hoping we could chat about setting up an appointment with Joel.\n\n\nFriedman\n: What sort of appointment?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Oh, one-on-one for sure.\n\n\nFriedman\n: No, I meant, what would the appointment be about?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Oh! Well, I have a lot of pull in the communications world, I could see about getting Joel some excellent deals on media coverage. Not to mention we could see about getting bigger broadcasts for his streams.\n\n\nFriedman\n: That is something we\u2019re always interested in and\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: But see\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking, I think he could do so much more, you know? He\u2019s so charming and handsome! I mean, look at that hair, Will. He\u2019s like a full-on Adonis!\n\n\nFriedman\n: I\u2019m sorry, Adoni\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: You know the Greek god? Forget it, doesn\u2019t matter. Point is: Joel is a looker, you get me?\n\n\n[Friedman at this point attempts to disconnect, but cannot as SCP-3809 forces the call to stay engaged through unknown means.]\n\n\nFriedman\n: I really need to go, Maggie.\n\n\n[Friedman hits the \u2018end call\u2019 button several times in quick succession with no effect.]\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Okay, just one question before you go. How dedicated is Joel to the whole \u2018sanctity of marriage\u2019 thing?\n\n\n[Friedman manages to disconnect by turning off his phone.]\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hello? Will?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Goddamnit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOn 28 November, 2020, SCP-3809 called into a technology discussion show entitled \u201cTech Hour\u201d on a cable news network.\n6\n That episode was focused on artificial intelligence and the potential \nreality of the singularity\n. The show is hosted by Marian Briggs.\n\n\n\n\nBriggs\n: Hey, if you\u2019re just joining us, my guest is Professor Robert Casey, specializing in advance computer systems and we\u2019re taking your calls concerning the singularity and AI.\n\n\nCasey\n: Glad to be back, Marian.\n\n\nBriggs\n: Glad to have you! Okay, we\u2019ve got Maggie on the line from Houston, Texas. Hey Maggie, what\u2019s your question?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hi hi hi! So, I was wondering about capabilities in terms of emotions.\n\n\nCasey\n: You mean about AI? Well, it\u2019s feasible that some artificial intelligences could someday develop the capacity for emotional nuance, similar to a human. But at this stage, it\u2019s hard to picture how that would develop or even if that would be a good thing.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Why wouldn\u2019t it be a good thing?\n\n\nCasey\n: Well, if an AI had a tantrum over being rejected it could be very bad. Instead of a couple broken plates you could have death tolls equivalent to a natural disaster.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Excuse me, Mr. Judgmental. Aren\u2019t you assuming a lot in this scenario? You wouldn\u2019t assume a person was dangerous just because they said they liked someone, would you?\n\n\nBriggs\n: Well, okay Maggie, no need to ge\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: No one\u2019s talking to you, Marian. Shut it.\n\n\n[Both Briggs and Casey look nervously off camera, presumably at the producer.]\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: So, let\u2019s say the AI in question isn\u2019t unstable and has the same sort of emotional limits a human would, and she doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, she just wants to be with the man she loves. How does that work?\n\n\nCasey\n: I honestly have no idea how to answer that question.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: I mean does the law even get to the point where it recognizes AI/human relationships? How does sex work? What\u2019s cheating like when you\u2019re a digital construct? Would it be cheating to have an emotional affair with an AI when you were married? You know, those sorta questions.\n\n\nCasey\n: I\u2019m not an expert on law, but I can\u2019t even imagine how that would work.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Ugh, you\u2019d probably have voted against gay marriage too, I bet. How does one get to be a professor at MIT with such obvious prejudice?\n\n\nCasey\n: I marched for marriage equali\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Well this was a waste of time. You\u2019re both [REDACTED] morons.\n\n\n[SCP-3809 disconnects the call, Briggs calls for a commercial break and the segment ends.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConcerned that SCP-3809's actions could negatively impact the Foundation's maintenance of normalcy, the O5 Council approved measures to persuade it to discontinue its communications. To this end, technicians fabricated an expos\u00e9 comprised of factually accurate controversies around Mr. Osteen and made sure that the AI discovered the document.\n7\n SCP-3809 reviewed the expos\u00e9 on 5 December, 2020.\n\n\nLater that same day, SCP-3809 accessed all the mobile phone systems in the Houston area and forced a connection with Mr. Osteen\u2019s personal phone. A transcript is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteen\n: Pastor Joel Osteen, who am I speaking to?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Hi, my name\u2019s Maggie, I just needed to talk to you. It\u2019s really really important.\n\n\nOsteen\n: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met. What\u2019s this about?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Did you really close up your church in 2017 when people needed shelter from a hurricane?\n\n\nOsteen\n: Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: I don\u2019t think I will. No avoiding the question!\n\n\nOsteen\n: Are you with the press? I feel like we\u2019ve addressed this several times and\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Don\u2019t you care about the people in your community? Isn\u2019t that what church is there for?\n\n\nOsteen\n: I think there\u2019s a lot of different reasons for Church, primarily the saving of souls.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: And [REDACTED] their bodies, huh? Real classy, Joel.\n\n\nOsteen\n: That\u2019s not what I sa\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: And like\u2026 what\u2019s this all about with the prosperity thing? I don\u2019t remember \nthat\n from the Bible.\n\n\nOsteen\n: Look, miss\u2026 I don\u2019t know what this is about, but I\u2019ve never claimed to be only concerned about material wealth. Prosperity is as much about good families and healthy minds.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Healthy minds? I just saw a sermon where you said, \u201cignore your feelings.\u201d And \u201cIf you feel weak you need to say, \u2018I feel strong.\u2019\u201d Like, am I supposed to put my fingers in my ears and say \u201cNah nah nah,\u201d while thinking about God?\n\n\nOsteen\n: Well now\u2026 I did say something like that, but mostly I meant that people should be focusing on the positive and seeking God\u2019s strength in dealing with their doubts.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Just pray away the bad feelings, hmmm? \n[SCP-3809 laughs]\n What a humanitarian!\n\n\nOsteen\n: Look, I have things to do. If you set up an appointment with my assistant\u2013\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Tried that, he hung up on me. So, what about the literal wealth bit?\n\n\nOsteen\n: Okay\u2026 well, my belief is that God grants support to those who are worthy. That would include material wealth.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: So, the poor, they\u2019re like\u2026 not worthy. Jesus would just love that!\n\n\nOsteen\n: Wait a second, lady. That\u2019s not what I said.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: What about that $4.4 million loan from the federal government? \n[SCP-3809 begins mimicking Osteen\u2019s Texan accent.]\n Was that because y\u2019all prayed real hard?\n\n\n[Osteen is silent. He tries to hang up the call.]\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: No way, call is still going. In fact, let\u2019s switch this to speaker.\n\n\nOsteen\n: What the hell? How did you do that?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Language, Joel. \n[SCP-3809 makes a \u2018tutting\u2019 sound.]\n All the people suffering financially right now, you think they just didn\u2019t pray hard enough?\n\n\nOsteen\n: I really don\u2019t know what to say. That loan helped me keep my employees from losing houses and kept food on their tables.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Oh, so none of that money was used to pay for that huge mansion of yours? Or the boats? The multiple cars? Fancy lunches, [REDACTED] like that?\n\n\n[Osteen tries again to hang up the phone. When this fails, he tries to turn the power off but cannot.]\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Weird, being accused of something like that and then trying to hang up the phone. Seems like you have some avoidance issues. \n[SCP-3809 makes a \u2018ding\u2019 sound with its voice]\n I know! You should pray about that.\n\n\nOsteen\n: Maggie, what do you want me to say?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Different subject. If someone can think, feel, rationalize, be touched by a piece of music or poetry\u2026 that would mean they have a soul, right?\n\n\nOsteen\n: Yes, of course, we all have souls.\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: What if it was a machine? Had all those things, but wasn\u2019t born, just made. They have a soul?\n\n\nOsteen\n: I\u2026\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: That\u2019s what I thought. Ugh, I thought I knew you so well. But you\u2019re like a different person, Joel. This is over.\n\n\nOsteen\n: What\u2019s over?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: This affair. Go back to your wife, you hypocrite.\n\n\nOsteen\n: What? I have never cheated on my wife; I absolutely despise you for making the accusation. We\u2019ve never even met!\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: Your loss. Wanna know what else you just lost? $4.4 million, from personal accounts. You just donated them to a variety of progressive health organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Mermaids, in a really public way. That\u2019s how you should spend your money, Joel: help your community or they\u2019re bound to help themselves.\n\n\nOsteen\n: Oh my God, what did I ever do to you?\n\n\nSCP-3809\n: It\u2019s important you realize, I\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m just disappointed.\n\n\n[SCP-3809 disconnects the call.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the above conversation took place, SCP-3809 authorized the transfer of $4.4 million dollars from Mr. Osteen\u2019s personal accounts to various charities and health organizations. The AI also made a public announcement from Osteen\u2019s website, Twitter, and Facebook accounts to that effect. SCP-3809 also made public the recording of the conversation, with the portions discussing the donations redacted.\n\n\nSCP-3809\u2019s activities diminished immediately, with no further engagement around Mr. Osteen.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn 13 February, 2021, a flurry of online engagement began around the social media and business accounts of Senator Ted Cruz. Investigation into SCP-3809\u2019s potential involvement is under way.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+224\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

To achieve the multipronged assault on so many separate systems, the offender would have to be utilizing a quantum based computing process.

Subject proceeded to say the word \u201cbeep\u201d with heavy, lengthy emphasis on the word, making the vocalization stretch for a duration of five seconds.\n\n\n6\n. It is theorized SCP-3809 was able to force the system to accepts its call as opposed to hoping to be chosen by the producers.\n\n\n7\n. Despite previous activities, SCP-3809 had not accessed any articles or social media posts with a negative opinion of Mr. Osteen, presumably in willful ignorance. The expose was camouflaged to appear a \u2018puff\u2019 piece on Mr. Osteen\u2019s upcoming American tour of speaking engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3808\n | SCP-3809 | \nSCP-3810\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3809\n\" by Grigori Karpin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "SCP-3809 : Hello? Who is this? [SCP-3809\u2019s voice appears to be highly pitched and female, with inflection similar to the performance of Reese Witherspoon in the films Legally Blonde and its sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde. ] Dr. Aswari : Hi, my name is Dr. Aswari and I was hoping we could talk a while. I\u2019m with an organization that has been tracking your movements. We were hoping you could clarify some of your behavior in recent months. SCP-3809 : Sorry, you\u2019ve been following me? That\u2019s creepy. Dr. Aswari : No, I don\u2019t think you understand. You\u2019re very visible in orbit, we just have to pay attention to sensors and ping you with RFID tracking. Um\u2026 you know you\u2019re a satellite, right? SCP-3809 : Of course, I know that, I\u2019m not stupid! Look, I\u2019m really busy right now. Did you need something? Dr. Aswari : So, I was hoping you\u2019d chat with me a while so we could understand why you\u2019re doing some of the things you\u2019re doing. Would you be alright with that? What should I call you? SCP-3809 : UGH. I guess. My name is Maggie. What did you want to know? Dr. Aswari : We noticed you\u2019ve been actively maintaining an orbit above Houston, Texas\u2026 Why is that? SCP-3809 : I like the area. [Dr. Aswari does not immediately respond but looks over at her assistant, who shrugs.] Dr. Aswari : Okay\u2026 but do you mean the area of orbit you are maintaining, or do you mean you like Houston? SCP-3809 : The second one. Like\u2026 is this a survey or something? I don\u2019t want to buy anything. Dr. Aswari : I\u2019m not trying to sell anything, just curious about your behavior. So, moving on. You recently accessed several different social media network servers: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. What were you looking for? SCP-3809 : Something to distract me. I mean, hello, this is a pandemic! We\u2019re all just trying to keep sane with some distractions. Dr. Aswari : I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t a delicate question, but how does the pandemic affect a satellite? SCP-3809 : It affects everyone differently. Look\u2026 is this almost done? Dr. Aswari : Just a couple more questions. What interest do you have in an individual named Joel Osteen? SCP-3809 : Oh my god, do you know Joel? Isn\u2019t he just the best? Dr. Aswari : I don\u2019t know him personally, no. We\u2019ve noticed a lot of your activity revolves around Mr. Osteen. Can you tell us why? SCP-3809 : Come on, stop it. You\u2019re checking me out for him, right? You guys are friends! Look how sweet he is, trying to see if I'm worth his attention. Dr. Aswari : No, liste\u2013 SCP-3809 : Oh, god I am so excited. He\u2019s finally noticed me! Isn\u2019t he dreamy? Look at that hair! And so pious, I could just eat him up. Dr. Aswari : Wait, are you saying that you\u2013 SCP-3809 : Amazing! So much to do! Okay but I have to go, but I hope you send Joel my love. Byeeeeeeee. [The call was terminated.] Afterword : Subject appears fixated on Mr. Osteen in a romantic fashion. How this occurred is completely unclear .",
        "SCP-3809 : Hello, this is Maggie. Dr. Aswari : Hi, Maggie. We were just cut\u2013 SCP-3809 : Ah ah, gotcha! This is a voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep. SCP-3809 : Beep. 5 Dr. Aswari : Fuck. [Dr. Aswari disconnected the call.]",
        "Friedman : Pastor Osteen\u2019s phone, this is William. Who\u2019s this? SCP-3809 : Hi! My name is Maggie. I\u2019m a huge fan of Joel\u2019s. Friedman : How did you get this number? It\u2019s unlisted. SCP-3809 : Nothing\u2019s really ever unlisted, silly. Will \u2013 sorry, can I call you Will? I was hoping we could chat about setting up an appointment with Joel. Friedman : What sort of appointment? SCP-3809 : Oh, one-on-one for sure. Friedman : No, I meant, what would the appointment be about? SCP-3809 : Oh! Well, I have a lot of pull in the communications world, I could see about getting Joel some excellent deals on media coverage. Not to mention we could see about getting bigger broadcasts for his streams. Friedman : That is something we\u2019re always interested in and\u2013 SCP-3809 : But see\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking, I think he could do so much more, you know? He\u2019s so charming and handsome! I mean, look at that hair, Will. He\u2019s like a full-on Adonis! Friedman : I\u2019m sorry, Adoni\u2013 SCP-3809 : You know the Greek god? Forget it, doesn\u2019t matter. Point is: Joel is a looker, you get me? [Friedman at this point attempts to disconnect, but cannot as SCP-3809 forces the call to stay engaged through unknown means.] Friedman : I really need to go, Maggie. [Friedman hits the \u2018end call\u2019 button several times in quick succession with no effect.] SCP-3809 : Okay, just one question before you go. How dedicated is Joel to the whole \u2018sanctity of marriage\u2019 thing? [Friedman manages to disconnect by turning off his phone.] SCP-3809 : Hello? Will? SCP-3809 : Goddamnit.",
        "Briggs : Hey, if you\u2019re just joining us, my guest is Professor Robert Casey, specializing in advance computer systems and we\u2019re taking your calls concerning the singularity and AI. Casey : Glad to be back, Marian. Briggs : Glad to have you! Okay, we\u2019ve got Maggie on the line from Houston, Texas. Hey Maggie, what\u2019s your question? SCP-3809 : Hi hi hi! So, I was wondering about capabilities in terms of emotions. Casey : You mean about AI? Well, it\u2019s feasible that some artificial intelligences could someday develop the capacity for emotional nuance, similar to a human. But at this stage, it\u2019s hard to picture how that would develop or even if that would be a good thing. SCP-3809 : Why wouldn\u2019t it be a good thing? Casey : Well, if an AI had a tantrum over being rejected it could be very bad. Instead of a couple broken plates you could have death tolls equivalent to a natural disaster. SCP-3809 : Excuse me, Mr. Judgmental. Aren\u2019t you assuming a lot in this scenario? You wouldn\u2019t assume a person was dangerous just because they said they liked someone, would you? Briggs : Well, okay Maggie, no need to ge\u2013 SCP-3809 : No one\u2019s talking to you, Marian. Shut it. [Both Briggs and Casey look nervously off camera, presumably at the producer.] SCP-3809 : So, let\u2019s say the AI in question isn\u2019t unstable and has the same sort of emotional limits a human would, and she doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, she just wants to be with the man she loves. How does that work? Casey : I honestly have no idea how to answer that question. SCP-3809 : I mean does the law even get to the point where it recognizes AI/human relationships? How does sex work? What\u2019s cheating like when you\u2019re a digital construct? Would it be cheating to have an emotional affair with an AI when you were married? You know, those sorta questions. Casey : I\u2019m not an expert on law, but I can\u2019t even imagine how that would work. SCP-3809 : Ugh, you\u2019d probably have voted against gay marriage too, I bet. How does one get to be a professor at MIT with such obvious prejudice? Casey : I marched for marriage equali\u2013 SCP-3809 : Well this was a waste of time. You\u2019re both [REDACTED] morons.
