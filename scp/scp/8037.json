Routine feeding and plant care is performed by Containment Technicians when SCP-8037 is not involved in active testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8037 is an instance of the Venus flytrap\n1\n plant. It is significantly larger than typical examples of the species, and exceeds the natural limits of energy and movement for flora of its kind. It has four of the distinct leaves, in addition to several vine-like tendrils which it controls with exceptional strength and precision. SCP-8037 is capable of autonomous movement, utilizing its features to manipulate objects and move itself around in its environment. It is rooted in soil held by a planter pot made of alumina ceramic.\n\n\nSCP-8037 is capable of speech. The leaves move in sync with the expressed vocalizations, despite impossibility of the floral physiology producing such sounds. SCP-8037 primarily speaks in a distinct manner characterised by lyrical verse and vocal harmonies of barbershop music.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddedum-01: Discovery\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n \nRoutine Foundation Normalcy Monitoring Systems detected a potential disturbance at the premises of Green Al's Garden Kingdom in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. An SCP Field Asset Team was deployed to investigate further.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Agent Polk and Agent Rodney walk across a parking lot and enter the store.]\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n So what exactly are we looking out for?\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n We don't know \nexactly\n what we're looking for, that's \nwhy\n they send us here to look out.\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n How do we keep getting calls like these? Just once, I'd like to be in the second wave of response and know what I'm walking into beforehand.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n By then all the fun could already be over.\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n Yeah, yeah\u2026 all the \"fun\". Okay, you sweep that way, I'll head past the gardening tools here; we'll meet up again at the greenhouse area in back.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Roger that.\n\n\n[The agents separate and proceed to search the store, section by section.]\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n It's quiet.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Aren't you going to say \"too quiet\"?\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n Too quiet for what? It's a hobby shop on a Wednesday afternoon, of course it wouldn't be busy.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n But I haven't seen any employees around either.\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n Huh. Good point.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Aha! Here we go\u2026 Are you close to the greenhouse yet? Join me in aisle 8, if you could, please.\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n What's the deal?\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Oh, you'll want to see this for yourself.\n\n\n[Agent Rodney approaches from behind a small group of people gathered in one aisle.]\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n Sure I will\u2026 Be there in a minute.\n\n\n[Agent Rodney maneuvers to the front of the crowd.

It then attempts to embrace the cactus, entangling itself among the limbs and skewering itself upon the spines.]\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Uhh\u2026 Eddie! The damn thing malfunctioned again!\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n Oh? Umm\u2026 Right. I'm on top of it, boss.\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Sorry for this, folks! I'm afraid our promotional display isn't working properly at this time.\n\n\nAgent Polk:\n But do be sure to watch \"World of Wondrous Plants\" on your streaming services at home!\n\n\nAgent Rodney:\n Eddie, hush!

Is love in the air? Dr. Reed: Is it actually responding to you? Researcher Humphrey: I think by now we have some rapport built up between us; don't interrupt now. SCP-8037: singing (in harmony with itself) Oh how long it's been, Since last we have seen, A sweetheart to love tender and true It's a sad lonesome scene, Behind our leaves red and green, On the inside we're feeling so blue [Researcher Humphrey reveals the mundane plant to SCP-8037 and places it on the table.] SCP-8037: Get a gander at this gorgeous gal! Researcher Humphrey: (Using a higher pitch voice) \"Well how do you do, sweetie pie!\" SCP-8037: singing (in harmony with itself) I must be looking at the finest, Beauty of the Carolinas, This darling is a masterpiece so rare (She's oh so rare) Much more than just a raggy weed, She's everything I'd ever need, If only her and I could be a pair (Oh what a pair!) Well I hope that it's not too soon, But we could get married in June, I feel that's where our fate's heading (Where fates are heading) Into my vines you would swoon, We'll dance in the light of the moon, Just you and I on the night of our glorious wedding! (A big grand wedding!) [SCP-8037 maneuvers itself closer to the mundane plant. SCP-8037 pulls the plant into a close embrace, and then ceases further activity.] Dr. Reed: What's happened to it? Researcher Humphrey: Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it was just acting out because it felt lonely before now? Dr. Reed: That's speculative. Resesrcher Humphrey: Speculation is pretty much all we can do in a case like this, isn't it? And now we've gained more data to speculate on. Dr. Reed: Yes, I suppose we have. Researcher Humphrey: This seems like the end of today's interview here; can we wrap it up? I'd like the extra time to ensure Test Chamber 6 is correctly prepped for the session in there. Dr. Reed: Very well. I'll page the Containment Technicians to come return 8037 to the greenhouse. [Researcher Humphrey exits the chamber.] [END LOG] Afterword: Upon subsequent review of video recorded between the time when Researcher Humphrey left the room and when Containment Technicians entered to transport SCP-8037 to its chamber, the leaves of the mundane plant appeared to slowly curl into a grin.",

It is significantly larger than typical examples of the species, and exceeds the natural limits of energy and movement for flora of its kind. It has four of the distinct leaves, in addition to several vine-like tendrils which it controls with exceptional strength and precision. SCP-8037 is capable of autonomous movement, utilizing its features to manipulate objects and move itself around in its environment. It is rooted in soil held by a planter pot made of alumina ceramic.",
