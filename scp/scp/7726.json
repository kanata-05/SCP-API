Everwood is expected to attempt suicide sometime this week. As per LUCKY HARE protocol, SCP-7726 has been left in an easily accessible location to Everwood under the guise of it being a non-anomalous firearm left behind by a careless security guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThank you for working so hard for me. Seeing as you're the most hardworking person in our department, I'm confident your promotion will be swift. But more importantly, thank you for your friendship. You made working here that much more fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7726\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7726.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-7726\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-7726 is to be kept in a standard anomalous object lockbox in \nSite-55\n. Fire Suppression Department personnel are permitted unrestricted access to the object.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7726 is a standard Beretta 90two semi-automatic pistol. When fired at a human subject, SCP-7726's mechanism will jam and fail to fire regardless of the status of the object. SCP-7726 will fire as normal when aimed at any other target. Additionally, SCP-7726 will not fire if doing so would result in it damaging a human subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI can't live with this guilt any longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLUCKY HARE PROTOCOL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW:\n\n\n \nLUCKY HARE protocol's stated purpose is the prevention of unnecessary loss in suicidal personnel.\n\n\nThis is achieved by informing the target personnel of their overwhelmingly good fortune. The process involves showing the target personnel affection and positive affirmations while ensuring to downplay their negative emotions as fruitless. This results in the target personnel feeling more pleased with life in 60% of cases.\n\n\n38% of further cases require a combination of more intense therapeutic efforts as well as medication. The Fire Suppression Department utilizes a unique drug to further rehabilitate personnel who fall into this bracket of LUCKY HARE protocol.\n\n\nThe final 2% of personnel who fall into LUCKY HARE protocol require more direct measures. They will often require overwhelming evidence of their good fortune, and as such, the use of anomalies has been approved to improve morale. Anomalies approved for use in LUCKY HARE protocol's 2% procedures are typically unassuming in appearance and can be mistaken for non-anomalous objects, which lends the project credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD\u00a0MORE\n\n\n\n\nREAD\u00a0MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish, I guess.\n\n\n- \nJay Everwood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-7726XP\n\n\n \n\n\nUPDATE\n\n\n \n\nEverwood was found in their office by a passing guard at approximately 0000 hrs on 26/07/2022 after hearing shots coming from the direction. SCP-7726 was recovered by disguised guard personnel. Everwood was unharmed and is currently undergoing extensive psychotherapy treatment with Dr. Von Thunen.
