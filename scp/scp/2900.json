They are to be stored in large storage locker 23233. They must be placed at least one meter from the walls of the storage locker. All are to be handled using 1.5 meter long manipulation arms. All personnel on Site-19 are to be informed of what an SCP-2900 instance looks like and any personnel receiving an instance are to be tested weekly for 3 months after receiving said instance for any anomalous effects. Currently SCP-2900 has shown no adverse anomalous effects. Site-19's current monitoring system is enough to prevent the effect from spreading exponentially.\n\n\nAll SCP-2900 instances are to be tagged and given back to their initial recipients, provided said recipients are Foundation personnel assigned to Site-19. Instances are allowed to be put on display in researchers' offices. All recipients will be provided with a glass case meeting containment standards for SCP-2900. No instances are allowed to leave Site-19 to prevent spreading of its anomalous effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2900 is an anomalous effect that spreads via SCP-2900 instances. SCP-2900 instances are a variety of trophies, certificates, and medals denoting performance in the recipient's chosen field of work. It has been noted that not all SCP-2900 instances denote exemplary performance, as seen in several SCP-2900 instances. SCP-2900 itself affects all sapient beings who pass within a 1 meter radius of any given instance. SCP-2900 manifests by anomalously creating an SCP-2900 instance for said sapient being, hereby referred to as the recipient. This instance appears when one of the recipient's places of storing/showcasing other awards or accolades, or a prominent place solely used by the recipient, goes unmonitored for 5 minutes. SCP-2900 seems to prioritize places of work for this effect, and does not seem to be able to place an SCP-2900 instance in a location over 1\u00a0km away. This effect persists for one hour after the recipient has passed through the area of effect, and fades if suitable conditions cannot be found. SCP-2900 instances can be recognized by the Achievement Co logo on the bottom/back of all instances.\n\n\nSCP-2900 was first discovered at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It came to the Foundation's attention after multiple reports of the appearance of \"Participation Awards\" from multiple students. Hundreds of instances were discovered in an unused corridor of the school. Fortunately, the effect was not yet widespread and a containment team was able to track down all instances.\n\n\nAddendum: 7/15/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n SCP-2900 instances began manifesting for multiple security personnel. Testing revealed that the SCP-2900 area of effect had increased to 2 meters. The next day this area of effect had increased to 3 meters. Return of SCP-2900 instances to their Foundation recipients stopped the SCP-2900 effect completely for a month. After this all SCP-2900 instances' areas of effect returned to normal. SCP-2900 seems to add about one instance per week, provided there are monitoring lapses, which are generally caused by the breach of other SCPs. After another instance is added, provided the recipient continues to display their instance, all instances will cease their anomalous effect for a period between 2 days and 3 months, varying instance to instance. Containment procedures revised.\n\n\nPartial Instance List:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance #\n\n\nType of Accolade\n\n\nAccompanying Text\n\n\nRecipient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nGold medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nYou walked half a 5K!\n\n\nStudent at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nGold medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nYou graduated 9th grade!\n\n\nStudent at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72\n\n\nGold medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nYou haven't hurt anyone in 24 hours!\n\n\nStudent at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125\n\n\nGold trophy with depiction of mop and bucket\n\n\nBest female janitor under 160 pounds!\n\n\nJanitor at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\nPaper certificate\n\n\nBest containment crew member!\n\n\nContainment crew member responsible for collecting SCP-2900 instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n136\n\n\nBronze medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nSite-19's burglary of the year!\n\n\nAssistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \nNote:\n This instance manifested after Assistant Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 broke into Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office and stole several classified documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n137\n\n\nGold medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nGood job saving the world again!\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\nPaper certificate\n\n\nYou did your best\n\n\nAgent Howard(DECEASED) \nNOTE:\n This certificate was discovered inside of Agent Howard's casket prior to burial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n144\n\n\nGold trophy with standard gold chalice\n\n\nBest containment procedures\n\n\nDoctor Yang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n145\n\n\nGold medal with blue ribbon\n\n\nIt wasn't your fault they didn't make it.\n\n\nSecurity guard \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n163\n\n\nBronze trophy depicting Agent Yadav holding a pocket watch\n\n\nNobody knows what you did but you.
