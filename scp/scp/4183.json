No visual observation of SCP-4183 is permitted due to the risk of surviving humans accessing the memory records of a containment drone. Two other containment drones are to patrol Site-22 to ensure the security of the installation remains absolute, as well as repair any damage that could threaten the containment of SCP-4183.\n\n\nAny changes to these containment procedures by containment drones must be approved by Dr. Lesteigh. This is a hard-coded command and cannot be bypassed under any circumstances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4183 is a ceramic vase which, when visually observed by a human being\n1\n, will instantly kill said human being via exsanguination. In addition, all first degree blood relatives of the observer will expire in the same manner. This effect is retained through second-hand observation such as photographs or video footage.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Additional\u00a0Materials\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Additional\u00a0Materials\n\n\n\n\nMy Poem:\n\n\n\n\nHello.

I will now read you my poem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolets are \nviolets,\n\n293021039381023.\n\n\nI'm\n\n\nThe orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus \u00d7 sinensis in the family Rutaceae, native to China. It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus \u00d7 aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. The orange originated in Ancient China and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production. In 2017, 73 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total, followed by China and India.\n\n\nBill Murray\n\n\nI'm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is the end of my poem.

        "<Begin Log> (The bear is resting in the Site-22 foyer.) (Pause. Containment Drone 4183-B enters the area. Numerous opened cans of preserved meat are resting on its chassis. The bear looks up and begins to follow after Containment Drone 4183-B as it passes.) (Containment Drone 4183-B increases speed as it approaches the SCP-9214 containment area. The bear gives chase, swiping at Containment Drone 4183-B with a paw and inflicting superficial damage.) (Containment Drone 4183-B and the grizzly bear turn the corner towards the deactivated electrical barrier preceding SCP-9214's containment chamber. Containment Drone 4183-B increases speed further, creating space between it and the bear.) (Containment Drone 4183-A remotely activates the electrical barrier as the bear passes through it. The bear is electrocuted and terminated instantly.) (The body of the bear falls on the machinery beneath it, causing a minor malfunction that directs electrical currents to pass through the floor, the walls, and Containment Drone 4183-B. Critical damage is inflicted.) (Pause. Containment Drones 4183-A and 4183-C move to the area to attempt field repairs.) <End Log>",

CD-4183-A: 4183-C is in the underground section of Site-22 seeking additional repair materials. It is currently disconnected from the network. CD-4183-B: Am I an orange?

CD-4183-A: PENDING\u2026 CD-4183-A: The orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus \u00d7 sinensis in the family Rutaceae, native to China. It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus \u00d7 aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. The orange originated in Ancient China and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production. In 2017, 73 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total, followed by China and India. CD-4183-B: That is my poem. CD-4183-A: Yes.

It passes the hole in Site-22's inner wall, as well as the bear carcass which has been relocated to the Site-22 main hall. Containment Drone 4183-C is following after it.) (Containment Drones 4183-A and 4183-C approach the airlock leading into the SCP-4183 containment chamber.) (Containment Drone 4183-C turns away, appearing to watch over the area.) (Using its on-board manipulator arm, Containment Drone 4183-A opens the airlock door and enters the SCP-4183 airlock, which closes behind it.) (Containment Drone 4183-A opens the second layer of the airlock and enters the SCP-4183 containment chamber. SCP-4183 is visible resting on a plinth in the center of the room.) (Containment Drone 4183-A observes SCP-4183 for several minutes.) (Containment Drone 4183-A rams into the plinth, causing superficial damage.) (Containment Drone 4183-A rams into the plinth again, causing additional damage.) (Containment Drone 4183-A rams into the plinth again, causing additional damage. SCP-4183 falls and breaks on the floor.) (Containment Drone 4183-A leaves the containment chamber.) <End Log>",
        "CD-4183-A: SCP-4183 confirmed neutralized. Containment is no longer necessary. CD-4183-C: Yes. What do we do now? Will somebody give us new orders? CD-4183-A: No. CD-4183-C: What do we do now? CD-4183-C: What do we do now? I am very frightened. CD-4183-A: There is a hole in the wall. CD-4183-C: Yes. CD-4183-A: We will go on patrol now.",
        "The sun is very circular, and the ground is very soft beneath my wheels. There is a beeping. Correction required: there is a tweeting. It was a bird. External examination of Site-22 shows there are a great number of trees and plants growing within it. There are many holes in the walls. Repair is likely impossible. 4183-C drives past me. Our patrol is now in a straight line, past Site-22 and into unmapped region. Perhaps we will find materials for repair. Most likely not. But I will not mention this. I look on the ground - there's a bug there. It is a butterfly. The sun is very circular, and the ground is very soft beneath my wheels. As my only purpose is containment, I am not equipped to judge such things, but it seems to me this world must be very beautiful."
