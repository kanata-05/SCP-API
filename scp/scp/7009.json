Research will continue in collaboration with the Beijing Institute of Anomalous Science.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7009 is a universal probabilistic phenomenon associated with Ancient Rome.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009 Instance\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-004\n\n\nThe collective designation for 31 individual incidents wherein a random text generator fully produced \nThe Aeneid\n.\n.\nAn epic by the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro.\n Scans indicate that no thaumaturgic or ontokinetic activity was involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-018\n\n\nA 3:2 replica of the Roman theatre of Dougga\n.\nAn ancient theatre in what was the B\u00e9ja Governorate of Tunisia. It was the location of the annual Dougga International Festival until 2025, when local Lethe Events made event organization impossible.\n that was discovered on Mars. It appears to have naturally formed from the surrounding rock through erosion. No thaumaturgic or ontokinetic activity was detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-095\n\n\nA meteorite in the shape of the \nVelletri Sarcophagus\n.\nAn ornately sculpted Roman sarcophagus from 140\u2013150 CE.\n that was discovered on the surface of Pluto. Analysis suggests that its collision with the surface of the dwarf planet damaged it in such a way as to result in its current shape. No thaumaturgic or ontokinetic activity was detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-146\n\n\nThe Lingua Phehma.\n.\nThe primary language of the Phehmat, an alien species that communicates by expelling gas from the joints of its exoskeleton.\n Despite the Phehmat's vastly different mode of communication, the Lingua Phehma's written form is functionally indistinguishable from Classical Latin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-264\n\n\nA 4.3\u00a0km by 0.9\u00a0km Roman victory column on the planet TRAPPIST-1e. It appears to have previously been a mountain that underwent extreme seismic activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-338\n\n\nOmicron Ceti.\n.\nA red-giant pulsating variable star that is approximately 200\u2013400 light-years from the Sun. It is part of the Earth constellation Cetus.\n Its irregular shifts in brightness are, when viewed across multiple centuries, able to be read as Morse code, translating to \"VENI VIDI VICI\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7009-509\n\n\nThe alien civilization that formerly existed on the planet Kepler-753b, which was founded by a species of animate coral. Its culture and much of its known history is nearly identical to that of Ancient Rome. Kepler-753b underwent an XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario approximately 1.2 billion years ago when its largest supervolcano erupted. Evidence of life on Kepler-753b only exists due to the thick layer of volcanic ash that has since coated 83.1% of the planet's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-7009 appears to be a form of \"convergent probability.\" In the way that convergent evolution is the developmental phenomenon of unrelated species reaching analogous results, convergent probability is the causal phenomenon of unlike causes having the same effects.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEver since I was a child, I've been obsessed with trying to make sense of the universe. Having entered my adolescence shortly after the Veil was dropped, I grew up entrenched in the ensuing cultural craze over anomalies. It was inevitable, in hindsight\u2014 to be an eleven-year-old girl and learn that magic was real? It captured my every waking moment. How could it not?\n\n\nTo my young mind, it was at once captivating and terrifying to peer behind the Foundation's shroud, to discover that the world was so full of things that couldn't be explained or even described. It was a waking dream and an inescapable nightmare. I couldn't tear myself away. The more I learned, the more I understood how little I would ever know.\n\n\nWhen I started my tenure at the Beijing Institute of Anomalous Science, I began to find some relief from this existential horror in chaos theory. The world is unpredictable and unfathomably strange, yes, but it all still operates on a complex system of fundamental laws. Consider the second law of thermodynamics; despite everything, one can at least trust that the universe will always progress towards a state of lower energy. Entropy provides a sort of bleak comfort in its absolute certainty.\n\n\nThese philosophical concerns weren't far from my mind when I began studying SCP-7009. Once again, I faced a universe that made no sense. SCP-7009 shouldn't be possible without some degree of reality alteration\u2014 but wherever we found it, Hume levels remained stable. No trace of thaumaturgic or ontokinetic activity was ever found.\n\n\nSCP-7009 is merely the child of random chance\u2014 but \"random\" doesn't really exist. Chaos is the result of immeasurably complex laws. And so, as I stare into this abyss of utter improbability, I find myself revising my old mantra:\n\n\nThe universe will always progress towards a state of lower energy. Roads will always lead to Rome.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014Dr. Xiu Huang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMontagueETC's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-8066\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7701\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE.
