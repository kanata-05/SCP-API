It is not visible through conventional means, including direct observation via telescope or other non-anomalous equipment. SCP-6695 is composed of several orbiting panels that collectively have a total area of 50\u00a0000\u00a0000 square kilometers. SCP-6695 is inhabited by an alien civilization focused on both religious and economic interests. Most members of this civilization identify themselves as followers of the \nOrtothan Religion\n.\n\n\nSCP-6695-A, also known as \"Tomorrow Diamonds\", refers to a manufactured product built from the resources of BPM-37093. SCP-6695-A instances are being sold across civilizations in the Milky Way by an extraterrestrial business known as PARAGON.co. This company is comprised of several Ortothan merchants devoted to a deity known as Yorun-leusan. SCP-6695-A instances are charged with high amounts of nuclear energy without any successful estimated measures.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 6695.1:\n On 1994/05/03 at 15:23, the IAU received an anomalous radio signal originating from a distance of 50 light-years, within the Centaurus Constellation. No delay was perceived despite the distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\u00a0\u205d\u00a0TRANSCRIPT\u00a0OF\u00a0INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\u00a0\u205d\u00a0TRANSCRIPT\u00a0OF\u00a0INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER(S):\n\n\n\n\nDr. Edna Kowal\n\n\nDr. Otto Warner\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECT(S):\n\n\n\n\nPARAGON.co representative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Warner is at his office, performing his regular assignments. His radio is tuned to a music radio station when the signal is intercepted and replaced.>\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n This is PARAGON.co, do you read me?\n\n\n<Dr. Warner ignores it, mistaking it for a song gimmick.>\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n This is PARAGON.co speaking to the Interstellar Anomaly Unit of the SCP Foundation, do you copy?\n\n\n<Dr. Warner grabs his microphone and adjusts the frequency to match the radio.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Yes, I can hear you.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Excellent. We request to discuss business with you.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Hold on, slow down. Who am I speaking with, exactly?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n My apologies. I am the representative of PARAGON.co, a business that aims to help Yorun-leusan defeat the Voruteut once and for all. We sell our products to every corner of the galaxy.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Um, right. Can you hold on for a minute?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Of course.\n\n\n<Dr. Warner covers the microphone with his hand.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Edna! I need help here!\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal enters the office in a hurry.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Otto? What\u2019s wrong?\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n We have\u2026 um\u2026 a visitor.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Ah, Edna Kowal. I\u2019ve heard about you.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Who is this? How do you know me?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Let\u2019s just say we have been keeping an eye on you and the Foundation. Are you perhaps familiar with Ortothans, miss?\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n That\u2019s doctor to you. I have met some believers but I know little about the religion itself.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n I\u2019ll give you two an abridged version, for the sake of business. We, Ortothans share admiration for the Koru-teusa who defend us against the terrors of the Voruteut. We sacrifice our blood to keep Yorun-leusan and Rakmou-leusan alive and healthy.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n (mumbling) What the hell?\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n You sacrifice your blood?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n The Koru-teusa have ascended to godhood but they\u2019re still mortal like us. They need blood to survive, we provide it to them.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n If this is true, why are you contacting us?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n We simply wish to discuss business, of course. We seek knowledge that you possess and we offer our product in exchange for it.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Can you be more precise?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Absolutely. I have prepared a document with all the information you need. Presented in terrestrial fashion, of course. Expect it in the next few days.\n\n\n<Communication with PARAGON.co ends abruptly.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Terrestrial?\n\n\n<There is no answer.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Hello?\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n I think the connection has been lost.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Damn it. What\u2019s up with that guy?\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal shrugs.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n We should locate where this signal came from.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n What about protocol?\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Otto. You of all people should not give a shit about protocol.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Don\u2019t apologize. We are still the directors of this department, we decide how we do things.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Yeah, I know\u2026\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 6695.2:\n Three days after, the following document is received and printed through Dr. Warner's fax machine.\n\n\n\n\nAre you tired of living a hollow, meaningless life? Do you dread waiting for the day a Voruteut will consume you? Do you ever wonder if you could do something for the universe? Well, wonder no more. Just say the word and we can make that dream a reality. Just by sharing the knowledge you possess on the approaching terrors that are soon to cause our demise, we'll give you an incredible total of TEN THOUSAND TONS worth of \nTomorrow Diamonds\n every time your planet completes a revolution around Sol.\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? The clock is ticking, call now before the opportunity vanishes for good, just like all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOMORROW DIAMONDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn The Sky With Diamonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA product brought to you by \nPARAGON.co\n.\n\n\n\n\nYour knowledge on the Voruteut will be used for the betterment of \nPARAGON.co\n and the glory and health of The Koru-teusa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe IAU directors decided to establish communication with PARAGON.co to further understand and potentially contain this anomaly. On 1994/05/07, a transmission is re-established using the same frequency PARAGON.co had hijacked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\u00a0\u205d\u00a0TRANSCRIPT\u00a0OF\u00a0INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\u00a0\u205d\u00a0TRANSCRIPT\u00a0OF\u00a0INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER(S):\n\n\n\n\nDr. Edna Kowal\n\n\nDr. Otto Warner\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECT(S):\n\n\n\n\nPARAGON.co representative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n We've been expecting you.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n We have considered your offer.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Oh? So you're interested in our exclusive \nTomorrow Diamonds\n?\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Well, we'd like to ask some questions first.\n\n\n<Line remains quiet for a second.>\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Go ahead.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n We don't quite yet understand what these \nTomorrow Diamonds\n are.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n \nTomorrow Diamonds\n are the most valuable resource available in the entire galaxy. They're imbued with great amounts of energy which can be applied to many uses. For example, it is used to power the entirety of the Aeris Outpost, our center of operations.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Why should we be interested in them?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Glad that you asked. \nTomorrow Diamonds\n are also utilized to fuel rockets and spaceships, if used right they can reach FTL\n2\n speeds.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal turns at Dr. Warner who has a wide grin on his face.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Alright then, you asked for us to give us your knowledge on a thing. A Voruteut?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n I believe you are familiar with it, one of your kind was able to change its course.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Are they talking about-\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n What is it like?\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n It hides in plain sight, takes unconventional appearances and consumes light and life.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n That's definitely \nSCP-6240\n.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal shushes Dr. Warner.>\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n It has been a trouble for us and currently, it's threatening our outpost. We've been able to hide for a while but it's bound to eventually find us.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Please give us a second.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal mutes the microphone.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n We can't just give them what we have on 6240.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Consider this, Edna. We could build devices that surpass our current technology.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n I don't trust them, there's something off about them.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Don't we kind of owe it to them? We were the ones who redirected the thing towards them.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n They seem to be doing well on their own.\n\n\n<Dr. Warner looks at the ground for a few seconds then back up at Dr. Kowal.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Well\u2026 As a co-director of the IAU, I think we should do it.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal sighs.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Fine. But let's test the waters first.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal turns on the microphone again.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Could we have a sample first, before agreeing to anything.\n\n\nPARAGON.co:\n Of course, of course. Very smart of you. We are proud of our product and its quality. Expect its arrival soon.\n\n\n<Connection is terminated.\n>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Thank you, Edna.\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApproximately 36 hours following the previous interview, an unidentified object entered Earth's atmosphere and landed on the entrance to the IAU's offices. The object was suspected to be the equivalent of a cargo vehicle in the form of a spacecraft. It left a 0.6 cubic meter box composed of an unknown type of wood before leaving our planet. Each side of the box had \"PARAGON.co\" written over it.\n\n\nInside the box, there was an SCP-6695-A instance with a weight of 10 kilograms. Analysis of the SCP-6695-A instance confirmed the presence of high amounts of nuclear energy with it.\n\n\n\n\nA photomicrograph of SCP-6695-A.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOnce the analysis was finished, PARAGON.co's offer was forwarded to the O5-Command.\n\n\n\n\nIs PARAGON.co's offer to be accepted?\n\n\n\n\nCouncil vote summary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\nNAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus: \nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6240's classified document was forwarded to PARAGON.co.

No new information on the anomaly was able to be given to PARAGON.co on any attempt.\n\n\nThe following document was received through fax on 2000/07/02.\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry to inform you that the next batch of \nTomorrow Diamonds\n will not be arriving on time.

Connection with FLUV-1 is lost.>\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n \nFLUV-1\n! No!\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Shit, what do we do now?\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n I don't know.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal stares at the screen's static before turning it off.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Maybe we should just wait until their war ends, getting involved seems to be a bad choice.\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n Makes sense.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal looks at Dr. Warner>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Wait, \nFLUV-1\n? Did you name the drone after Doug?\n\n\n<Dr. Warner nods.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n That's sweet.\n\n\n<Dr. Warner stands up and hugs Dr. Kowal.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Um, Otto?\n\n\nDr. Warner:\n You're a good friend.\n\n\n<Dr. Kowal smiles.>\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n You too.\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeven months afterward, the following document was received through the IAU's fax machine.\n\n\n\n\nWe apologize profusely for the delay.
