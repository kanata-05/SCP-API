Every November, on the 11th at midnight, all SCP-8892-1 instances demanifest, and in their place are humanoid entities now designated as SCP-8892-2.\n\n\nSCP-8892-2 entities appear as soldiers wearing uniforms indicative of WWI, WW2, and modern military uniforms; some entities have been identified as men and women who have served in the British Army and died during battle or after leaving military service.\n\n\nEvery November, on the 11th day, new SCP-8892-2 instances will manifest in place of SCP-8892-1 instances. SCP-8892 appears to be cycling through all deceased British servicemen and women. SCP-8892 cognitive hazardous properties are neutralised during this time.\n\n\nSCP-8892-2 instances will stand shoulder-to-shoulder until midnight when they all simultaneously salute and demanifest once the new day begins.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDiscovery Log\n\n\nDiscovery type:\n Incidental\n\n\nResponding Team:\n RRU\n2\n Sloan Wulves: Roberts, Pearse, Taylor and Wilson\n\n\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"We were just on our way back to Site-71 when we came across what seems to be a poppy field. And well, people are just standing in the field, slumped over, staring at the ground; some are out of focus and don't react when spoken to.\"\n\n\nRoberts walks over to Agent Taylor, standing at the edge of the field.\n\n\nTaylor:\n \"Where am I?\"\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"Taylor?\"\n\n\nTaylor:\n \"Who's\u2026 Taylor?\"\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"You're Taylor; you are Agent Nathaniel Taylor. You work for the Foundation.\"\n\n\nTaylor:\n \"Can I have some water? My head hurts.\"\n\n\nRoberts picks up a SCP-8892-1 instance and drops it immediately.\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"Fuck\u2026 Taylor, come on buddy, move.\"\n\n\nRoberts drags Taylor away from SCP-8892.\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"Pearse, Wilson, come in, do not approach the flowers, I repeat, do not approach the flowers.\"\n\n\nPearse:\n \"What? I don't know. Wh-who?\"\n\n\nWilson:\n \nSilence\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"Pearse, Wilson, get away from the flowers now! This is an order.\"\n\n\nAgents Pearse and Wilson continue to walk in a stumbling motion deeper into the field of SCP-8892-1 instances.\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"Site-71, this is Roberts, captain of RRU Sloan Wulves. We require immediate medical attention and evacuation. I'm sending the coordinates.\n\n\nHelp Desk:\n \"Please describe the nature of your emergency.\"\n\n\nRoberts:\n \"We came across a field of flowers. A group of civilians are standing in the field, unresponsive. One of the flowers touched Agent Taylor's foot, and he didn't know who he was. Now Pearse and Wilson are standing in the field. I can't approach them; we need a helicopter to get them out.\n\n\nHelp Desk:\n \"Confirmed; sit tight, Agent Roberts; help is on the way.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of regiments identified through SCP-8892-2 instances.\n\n\n\n\nWW1:\n\n\n\n\nBorder\n\n\nKing's Own (Royal Lancaster)\n\n\nBuffs (East Kent)\n\n\nNorthumberland Fusiliers\n\n\nCameron Highlanders\n\n\nRoyal Warwickshire\n\n\nCameronians (Scottish Rifles)\n\n\nRoyal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\n\n\n\nWW2:\n\n\n\n\n3rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Reconnaissance Regiment.\n\n\n13th Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)\n\n\n43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment.\n\n\n50th Reconnaissance Regiment.\n\n\n61st (City of Edinburgh) Signal Regiment.\n\n\n\n\n2000-Now:\n\n\n\n\nRoyal Regiment of Scotland\n\n\nSpecial Reconnaissance Regiment\n\n\nMercian Regiment\n\n\nCayman Islands Regiment\n\n\nYorkshire Regiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAfter Action Report\n\n\nAll individuals afflicted with SCP-8892-1's memory-altering effects are currently receiving treatment.
