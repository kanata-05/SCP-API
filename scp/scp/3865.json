Level-3 clearance is required in order to enter SCP-3865.\n\n\nUPDATE: SCP-3865 are not to be entered under any circumstances. SCP-3865 are to be monitored by armed security personnel at all times for any irregular activity. SCP-3865 are to be kept from filling to capacity with barley grains through the regular removal and incineration thereof.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3865 are a pair of concrete stave tower silos located within \u2588\u2588 square kilometers of abandoned farmland in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Idaho. SCP-3865 are in a state of dilapidation, with heavy rusting and structural damage indicating sustained neglect. SCP-3865 are always filled with variable amounts of barley (\nHordeum vulgare\n) grains. These grains do not decay, and will replenish themselves if removed.\n\n\nAny individual who is fully submerged in SCP-3865\u2019s grain supply will emerge in an alternate and far less dilapidated version of SCP-3865\n1\n within an extradimensional location designated SCP-3865-1. Individuals may exit SCP-3865-1 and renter baseline reality through the same process. SCP-3865-1 is composed mostly of farmland and has a total surface area of \u2588\u2588 square kilometers, beyond which is an impenetrable white mist. The entirety of SCP-3865-1\u2019s farmland is dedicated to growing barley. SCP-3865-1 is inhabited by two species, designated SCP-3865-2 and SCP-3865-3.\n\n\nSCP-3865-2 are humanoid organisms resembling \"scarecrows\". SCP-3865-2 vary from 1.4 to 2.2 meters in height, and are outwardly composed of dried barley and cloth. SCP-3865 are sentient, sapient, and capable of speech\n2\n, communicating in American English with pronounced midwestern accents. SCP-3865-2 have not been observed to age or expire, and do not regularly eat, drink, or sleep, instead dedicating most of their time toward the communal effort of harvesting barley grains and depositing them within SCP-3865-A\n3\n. Due to the constraints of their pre-industrial farming tools, the number of acres available, and the seasonal growth patterns of barley, this accumulation of grain is slow and gradual. \nSCP-3865-2 are generally friendly toward Foundation personnel, and can thus be approached without incident.\n (See Addendum 3865.2)\n\n\nSCP-3865-3 instances are physically identical to American crows (\nCorvus brachyrhynchos\n). Like SCP-3865-2 instances, SCP-3865-3 instances do not require sustenance or sleep in any form. While they are not believed to be sapient, SCP-3865-3 instances are intelligent enough to understand and obey verbal commands from both SCP-3865-2 instances and Foundation personnel. Like SCP-3865-2 instances, SCP-3865-3 instances are primarily oriented toward the task of growing and harvesting barley.\n\n\nAddendum 3865.1:\n \nInterview Log 04/22/2016\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Jorgensen (Head Researcher of SCP-3865)\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-3865-2-24 (referred to by other instances as \u201cFarmer Jeck\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jorgensen:\n Excuse me, I was wondering if you would be able to answer some questions for me.\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-24:\n Sure thing, just hang on a sec. [SCP-3865-2-24 steps out of the barley field and places its pitchfork on the ground]\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-24:\n Alright, ask away.\n\n\nDr. Jorgensen:\n Why do you and your people harvest barley and store it in those silos? [Dr. Jorgenson points at SCP-3865-A] You don\u2019t seem to use it for food, so what purpose does it serve?\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-24:\n Why, we\u2019re saving it all for the Harvest Festival! It should be coming up real soon, y\u2019know.\n\n\nDr. Jorgensen:\n I see, and what exactly is this \u201cHarvest Festival\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-24:\n Why, it\u2019s only our oldest and most important tradition! Every couple of hundred years or so, when we\u2019ve collected enough grain to fill the silos, we celebrate by throwing an enormous party. You and your science friends should come, it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll want to miss. There\u2019ll be singing and dancing and more food than you know what do do with! [laughs]\n\n\nDr. Jorgensen:\n That sounds interesting. When will it be?\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-24:\n Probably later this year. The last few harvests have been a little low, with this cold spell and whatnot, but one more yield should do the trick. You\u2019ll get a more formal invitation once it\u2019s all planned out. Hope you can make it!\n\n\n[END TRANSCRIPT]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3865.2:\n \nIncident Report 12/09/2016\n\n\nOn 12/02/2016, a handwritten note emerged from SCP-3865, inviting Dr. Jorgensen and any other willing personnel to attend the \u201cHarvest Festival\u201d, which was to occur a week later at 5:00\u00a0pm\n4\n.\n\n\nHead Researcher Dr. Jorgensen, intending to study the cultural practices and significance of the festival, entered SCP-3865 at 4:55\u00a0pm, accompanied by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 emerged from SCP-3865 the following morning in a heavily disheveled state. Dr. Jorgensen was never recovered.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of footage recovered from Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s body camera.\n\n\n\n\n4:55:47\u00a0pm:\n Dr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 emerge from SCP-3865-A\n\n\n4:56:09\u00a0pm:\n Dr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are greeted by several SCP-3865-2 instances, and are lead to an open field.\n\n\n5:03:20\u00a0pm:\n An SCP-3865-2 instance can be seen playing a banjo while several other instances perform a dance resembling the hoedown. Dr. Jorgensen is encouraged to participate, and eventually obliges after writing some precursory observations in his notepad. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 watches, and is not approached by any SCP-3865-2 instances.\n\n\n6:45:13\u00a0pm:\n SCP-3865-2 instances cease dancing, and move toward a distant barn. Dr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 follow.\n\n\nDr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 enter the barn, where a large table can be seen holding several edible dishes\n5\n. The origin of these dishes is unknown.\n\n\n6:46:31\u00a0pm:\n Dr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 sit at the table, along with the SCP-3865-2 instances. They are offered food, but politely decline. SCP-3865-2 instances can be seen inserting food into gaps in their cloth exterior. How or if this food is digested is unknown.\n\n\n7:58:53\u00a0pm:\n Dinner concludes. Dr. Jorgensen and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are lead back into the open field, along with all the SCP-3865-2 instances. They sit in a circle of wicker chairs that have been placed around a pile of dried barley approximately 3 meters in diameter.\n\n\n8:00:04\u00a0pm:\n An SCP-3865-2 instance, hereafter designated SCP-3865-2-58, climbs on top of the barley pile and blows through an object resembling a cornucopia, producing a low, guttural tone.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-58:\n Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and congratulations on another successful harvest! [applause] We\u2019ve put in a lot of hard work over the last several decades, through the good times and the bad, all for this one special night. Now, as much as we all enjoy the music and the dancing and the enormous feast that comes with each Harvest Festival, it is important to remember what this celebration is really about. It\u2019s about friendship, kinship, and family. It\u2019s about all of us coming together as a community to celebrate our roots, and to reap the outcome of our labor. With that in mind, I would like our honored guest for this evening, Dr. Jorgensen, to come up here and join me. [gestures to Dr. Jorgensen]\n\n\n\n\n8:01:37\u00a0pm:\n Dr. Jorgensen politely declines at first, but is eventually lead onto the barley pile.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3865-2-58:\n Dr. Jorgensen, on behalf of all of us, we humbly thank you for your contribution to the Harvest.\n\n\n\n\n8:02:05\u00a0pm:\n SCP-3865-2-58 wraps its arms around Dr. Jorgensen's neck and squeezes violently. Several other SCP-3865-2 instances climb onto the barley pile to assist in restraining Dr. Jorgensen.\n\n\n8:02:07\u00a0pm:\n Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 draws his firearm and shoots several SCP-3865-2 instances. An unidentified red liquid can be seen leaking from their wounds, but they appear unfazed.\n\n\n8:02:46\u00a0pm:\n Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's is separated from his gun, and is overpowered and restrained shortly thereafter by the crowd of SCP-3865-2 instances.\n\n\n8:03:29\u00a0pm:\n Dr. Jorgensen ceases movement, and is presumed to be unconscious. SCP-3865-2-58 and the other SCP-3865-2 instances lay him down on the barley pile and walk out of view.\n\n\n8:03:51\u00a0pm:\n SCP-3865-58 returns with a burning clump of barley stems, and throws it onto the barley pile, igniting it along with Dr. Jorgensen. Audience applauds.\n\n\n8:04:38\u00a0pm:\n Black smoke begins to rise from the burning barley pile, congealing into several thousand SCP-3865-3 instances, which then fly out of view.\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, a large number of SCP-3865-3 instances were seen emerging from SCP-3865. Security personnel were ordered to terminate as many instances as possible, but were largely unsuccessful. Terminated instances each held a single barley grain in their beak. SCP-3865 were empty following this event.\n\n\nAddendum 3865.2:\n \nAftermath of Incident 12/09/2016\n\n\nOver several months following Incident 12/09/2016, numerous anomalous phenomena were reported across the western and midwestern United States. These occurrences are presumed to be related to Incident 12/09/2016. Following these phenomena, Class-A amnestics were administered to all civilians involved, and SCP-3865's containment procedures were updated.\n\n\nThe following is a list of reported phenomena:\n\n\n\n\nFeathers resembling those of \nCorvus brachyrhynchos\n were found in approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 bedrooms on 12/10/2016. All bedrooms belonged to or were currently being inhabited by females between the ages of 13 and 45.\n\n\nIn the months following 12/09/2016, approximately \u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 females reported excreting variable amounts of barley fibers, cloth, and foreign human tissue during menstruation. Genetic sequencing of tissue samples revealed portions of DNA matching that of Dr. Jorgenson.\n\n\nBetween 08/11/2017 and 10/19/2017, approximately \u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 females unexpectedly entered labor, each birthing a single SCP-3865-2 instance shortly thereafter. Birthed SCP-3865-2 instances measured between 46\u00a0cm and 56\u00a0cm, and were fully mobile. Once birthed, SCP-3865-2 instances traveled along the shortest possible route toward the location of SCP-3865, only deviating from said route when faced with an obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nThrough the use of incendiary devices, all birthed SCP-3865-2 instances were successfully incapacitated and/or terminated before reaching SCP-3865. Autopsies later revealed that captured instances each contained a stillborn human fetus beneath their barley exterior.\n\n\nAddendum 3865.3:\n \nRecovered Note Transcript 11/26/17\n\n\nOn 11/26/17, approximately one month after the enactment of updated containment procedures, an envelope emerged from SCP-3865. Within the envelope was a handwritten note, along with a slightly charred head of barley. The note read as follows:\n\n\n\n\nGreetings scientists,\n\n\nIt appears a plague of vermin has wiped out our most recent harvest. A plague that continues to hinder our growth by stealing our supply of seeds. Now, you folks may be men of science, but we know a thing or two about the Earth, and how to tame and cultivate its soils. We will do everything in our power to eliminate these vermin, until all that remain are their fertile ashes, from which we will reap our most bountiful harvest yet.\n\n\nSee you next Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Designated SCP-3865-Alternate or SCP-3865-A\n\n\n2\n. The mechanism with which they accomplish this is unknown.\n\n\n3\n. A change in SCP-3865-A\u2019s grain supply correlates with an equal change in SCP-3865\u2019s grain supply.\n\n\n4\n. Pacific Standard Time\n\n\n5\n. Breadsticks, mashed potatoes, and an unidentified form of cooked poultry are all visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3864\n | SCP-3865 | \nSCP-3866\n \u00bb",
