Tensions between the Foundation and the United States government are not conducive to containment operations in civilian areas. Efforts are currently focused on maintaining Foundation control over critical installations, and preparing for a potential definition of Tiamat-class Special Containment Procedures targeting the United States of America.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances should personnel approach or interact with SCP-8082. Statistical analysis indicates a mean time of eight minutes to breaching of one of the conditions for a nomenclature mutation event in SCP-8082's presence. These conditions include, and are not limited to, referring to SCP-8082 with a name, responding to a name SCP-8082 bestows on you, lying to SCP-8082, denying SCP-8082 food when admitting SCP-8082 to an abode.\n\n\nIt is likely that SCP-8082's hazardous effects are not under SCP-8082's conscious control.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8082 is the designation for an nomenclative-kinetic eigenweapon. The exact capabilities of this eigenweapon, as well as its status and whether it is at large or in American custody is not yet known.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8082 was developed by Site-46 in an effort to combat an anomaly that was causing the widespread disappearances of children throughout the continental United States (to date, approximately two hundred thousand (200,000) children have become casualties). Though such a weapons project had been suggested by various Foundation staff, the O5 council chose not to pursue it due to concerns that the process to create the weapon was insufficiently understood. Site-46 began its own initiative in secret, labeled Project Erlk\u00f6nig.\n\n\nSurvivor testimony from the fall of Site-46 indicates that the procedure to create SCP-8082 took place on 9/27/2024 at 12 AM, which correlates with the disappearance of all but two progeny of Foundation staff, inflicting a critical blow to organizational morale, and sparking widespread defections to US government allegedly in an attempt to seek retribution against the Foundation as a whole for being complicit in Site-46's actions.\n\n\n\n\nRecovered\u00a0Project\u00a0Erlk\u00f6nig\u00a0Documentation\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature note:\n On Dr. Valera's instructions, all references to D-8185 are to exclusively use its D-class designation instead of its name, including logs predating its D-class processing.

Audio feeds unavailable due to unresolved cyber-attack that occurred during the specific window of their conversation, cause undetermined. Additionally, both participants frequently covered their mouths, hindering efforts to discern content of speech from lip movements.\n\n\nLocations:\n\nD-8185: D-8185's containment chamber.\n\nE-8321: Dr. Valera's office (it is unknown how E-8321 gained access to Dr. Valera's quarters)\n\n\nDescription:\n Conversation begins acrimoniously, with both participants seen in varying levels of distress. E-8321 is walking in a loop around the perimeter of the office, lunging at the desk from time to time when screaming at D-8185. D-8185 remains mostly static for much of the conversation, except when throwing objects and punch surfaces around the chamber. At one point, D-8185 and E-8321 seen to remove matching jewelry from the fourth proximal digit of each of their left hands and hurl them across their respective rooms. Forensic analysis of both subjects' visual indicators indicate highly elevated distress state consistent with trauma response and possible dissociation, though D-8185 shows the most external indicators of distress (e.g. touching its own hair and face, aforementioned striking of physical surfaces, crying), whereas E-8321 shows indications of alexithymia; such as lack of emotional responsiveness, save the occasional scream whenever D-8185's physical reactions cause a loud noise.\n\n\nThirty minutes into the confrontation, both participants appear to cease communicating, although frames from footage indicate E-8321 is whispering to D-8185. Forensic analysis of neurochemical markers indicate that both participants were able to co-regulate during that window of time.\n\n\nBoth participants retrieve their jewelry and replace them on their respective fingers. D-8185's digit is mutilated above the knuckle. E-8321's corresponding digit is tattooed black along a surface area roughly corresponding to the extent of D-8185's deformation.\n\n\nConversation becomes copacetic. Both D-8185 and E-8321 express lower intensity emotional distress, until D-8185 says something that causes E-8321 \nto hyperventilate\n to laugh. E-8321 has stopped pacing and lies prone on her back on the desk, positioned so communication device is next to her head. D-8185 has relaxed in bunk with phone next to his head. After twenty minutes of banter, E-8321 says something that correlates with a sexual arousal response in D-8185. D-8185's reply has the same effect on E-8321. E-8321 starts to unbutton [their] shirt and D-8185 reaches for [its] pants in motions that have been confirmed to be non-anomalously synchronized. [EXPUNGED BY PERSONAL REQUEST OF PROJECT LEAD]\n\n\nConversation terminates when Level 5 security personnel detect unauthorized communication, and extract E-8321 from office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\nParticipants:\n Dr. Anthony Valera, Miss Baba Yaga (pseudonym chosen by high ranking member of Foundation leadership-all further information classified on penalty of summary termination and/or nerve stapling)\n\n\nBackground:\n Discussion of contents of video log of unauthorized phone conversation\n\n\nDr. Anthony Valera:\n \"How did that [E-8321] get into my office?\"\n\n\nMiss Baba Yaga:\n \n<Smiles>\n \"Yellow card.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"Fine.

I simply let nature take its course.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"But \nwhy\n?\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Because [D-8185] is almost there. He just needed a reminder of what [D-8185] stands to lose. [E-8321] has ardor, but [E-8321] didn't realize that just by letting [D-8185] hear [E-8321]'s voice again, imagining what [E-8321] had to do to make it happen, [E-8321] made up [D-8185]'s mind. A push.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"What push? Why? I don't know if you saw the same footage I did, but it sounded like [E-8321] whipped the initiative out of [D-8185] entirely! How would that emotional roughness motivate [D-8185] to anything more than further incessant wallowing?\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"You ought to know, Dr. Valera, and yet you're clueless. The ontico-ontological paradox in a nutshell. I always knew you were right man for this project.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"And are you going to tell me who among my staff are so limp-wristed that they can be finessed by a [E-8321]?\"\n\n\n<Miss Yaga chuckles as she rises from her seat.

Miss Yaga instead stares at him.>\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Red Card.\"\n\n\n<Miss Yaga's left fist makes contact with Dr. Valera's temple in a swift hook movement. The blow causes Dr. Valera to immediately lose consciousness and collapse into a prone position at Miss Yaga's feet. Miss Yaga checks Dr. Valera's vitals, searches for broken bones, and performs rudimentary checks for concussions and other related head injuries. After signaling for medical staff to retrieve Dr. Valera for immediate eval and treatment, she wipes her hands on his shirt, and then leaves the room>\n\n\nPostscript:\n No disciplinary actions were filed against Miss Yaga.

He also fast-tracked D-8185's registration as D-Class as per standard Foundation procedure regarding test subjects in High Intensity Experimentation Environments.\n\n\nGuards with orders from Miss Baba Yaga had transferred D-8185 to a room allocated for D-8185 and E-8321's meeting, when Dr. Valera and a scratch formation of five MTF soldiers forcibly assumed custody of D-8185. D-8185 was then brought to Dr. Valera's office, which had been cauterized from the surveillance network shortly after E-8321's break-in. As a result, it is unclear what transpired into that room, although Dr. Valera alleges any physical injuries on D-8185's person were purely the result of the containment breach. Dr. Valera permitted D-8185 to make a single phone call to E-8321, who was rushed to a site checkpoint in order to take the call.\n\n\nDue to Dr. Valera's improvised precautions, only audio from E-8321's side of the conversation was able to be traced and logged.\n\n\nE-8321:\n \"[D-8185], what's going on?\"\n\n\nE-8321:\n \"You said yes?

Does [D-8185] sound like the kind of person to fuck with his wife at a time like that? So, by the time [D-8185] gets frogmarched to D-Class, we're scrambling \neveryone\n to contain three different Keter breaches at three different parts of the site at the same time, and at the exact moment the sirens go off, [D-8185] plunges a letter opener he stole from Dr. Valera's office into the femoral artery of one of my fucking troops and guns it in the direction of the sirens. At the same time, [E-8321], wearing an MTF uniform provided to her by a contact who is now in custody, runs in his direction. They managed to get within a meter of each other before Foundation staff managed to restrain and gag them both before [D-8185] could leak sensitive intel about the Project, such as he knew.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"Who gives a \nfuck\n about that? We got him, didn't we? And when I last checked, there weren't any actual breaches. They were all false alarms, set off by saboteurs in \nyour\n team-\"\n\n\nKingfish:\n \"Because of the containment breach scramble, the personnel on the scene weren't able to rush him to the infirmary in time, and the soldier bled out before we could get him fixed up.\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"In addition, you may have terminally compromised Project Erlk\u00f6nig. I specifically said [D-8185] was to agree to participate of his own volition.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"He signed the paperwork, didn't he? It's not my fault the little shit was too dumb to ask for his end upfront. It's yours for making him think the Foundation particularly cares about its pawns.\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"The nature of the\u2026catalyst\u2026is rather picky about niceties like this. I'm sure I can still make this work\u2026it's just I'm unsure of what it considers 'damages'. Just know whatever happens next, it's on \nyou\n.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"I couldn't be less interested in what you think. My name is on this project, not \nyours\n. You are a fixer, a bag woman, and I have a paper trail implicating you in every shortcut you asked me to make. And even if that weren't the case, you're a dead woman walking!\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \n<She grins, this time with teeth>\n \"Good catch. I underestimated your ability to make friends, it seems.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"It's easier to make friends when the turncoats are trying to leave a sinking ship.\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"You've overestimated your ability to make \nuseful\n ones. Your grasp of the facts is incomplete. You see, we're \nall\n dead.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\nKingfish:\n \"Bullshit.\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"We're all dead. In the process of our work, with all the sacrifices-personal and literal-the scads of innocent people sent to their deaths in painful ways, this latest imminent atrocity-we've racked up quite the rap sheet.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"But those Ethics Committee wavers-\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Were forged.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"But the O5s-\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Expressly voted against me continuing this project. Do the math. The Foundation has been getting a very warped account of events on the East Coast. I was able to explain away the irregularities as a result of rampant malware attacks from our angry counterparts at Langley, but recently they've begun to trace a few of those cyberattacks to IPs associated with me.\"\n\n\nKingfish:\n \"If what you're saying is true, it is my duty to place you both under immediate confinement as per Foundation regulation-\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"You'll do no such thing, considering your subordinate is the one who set off the breach alarms.\"\n\n\nKingfish:\n \"What did you just say?\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"[E-8321] didn't know it, but she was my mouse-trap. I had all of your squad's interactions with her recorded through my own private surveillance system, one you had no way of knowing about or sabotaging. If it's any consolation, I'm sure her mother would have followed through on all of the promises she made on her behalf. Or maybe you helped her because your conscience cried out against what Dr. Valera was doing. Or maybe you just really didn't like Dr. Valera. The distinctions won't matter to a Foundation courts martial.\"\n\n\n\"Do the math. Do you think it's a coincidence I let a bleeding heart, traumatized war criminal be in charge of containing hundreds of achingly innocent civilians, all sullen looking reminders of the single greatest failure of your entire life? Where do you think your staff came from? Why do you think I encouraged your most compassionate tendencies, and let [E-8321] have such a loose leash? Now, thanks to that containment breach, all of your morally outraged bedfellows are implicated in treasonous endeavors against Foundation security for the many \nmonths\n that you let that girl manipulate you. You were a fiddle, and I watched someone play you.\"\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"You\u2026you \nbitch\n.\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Yellow card, Anthony.\"\n\n\n<Dr. Valera flinches, as Miss Yaga rises to her feet>\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"What you two do next is up to you. Dr. Valera, you can \ntry\n to throw yourself on the mercy of the O5s for both the crimes you actually committed, and the crimes I committed under your name, \nand\n convince them that you were genuinely the biggest idiot in the history of the Foundation. Kingfish, you \ncould\n follow your conscience, arrest us both, yada yada yada\u2026and then promptly throw the rest of your beloved squadmates onto the sword the O5s make you fall on for this. \"\n\n\n\"Your only hope of a reprieve is that Project Erlk\u00f6nig is a success and pulls the Foundation's ass out of the fire-because only a Foundation that owes you \neverything\n will forgive you betraying \neverything\n they pretend to represent. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to make preparations for a fate worse than death.\"\n\n\n<Miss Yaga walks to the door>\n\n\nDr. Valera:\n \"Why\u2026why\u2026?\"\n\n\nMiss Yaga:\n \"Oh, why'd I pick your son? He's utterly unremarkable. \nYou\n were the secret ingredient, because you were the only researcher in your field willing to torture your own flesh and blood to the extent I needed you to. I had a theory that the safety a subject feels for their parent draws the attention of the phenomena. Over the course of six months, you did an exquisite job killing any remaining belief your son had that his father was anything more than an incidental sperm donor. You secured my test subject and tested my 'vaccine' by aggressively killing his love for you. And if you want to salvage your life and career from this, you'll continue killing it until I give you the signal to make the screaming stop.\"\n\n\n<Miss Yaga opens the door>\n\n\n\"Gentlemen, I'll see you in hell.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Erlk\u00f6nig: Research documentation\n\n\nIrrelevant. It has already begun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of image undetermined\nAnother addendum, my friends: There are two of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n \nThe dream glade without Names\n\n\nThe young god of death\n was fused to a tall alder tree. A weird unlight gloamed from the streams of sweet-tasting ichor flowing down his face and arms into the olive carpet of grass beneath him. Each blade in the field is stiff and though he hears a gentle breeze, every blade remains stuck in place. They were like mossy cactus spines. His neck feels stiff where his spine was pierced by the jagged heartwood.\n\n\nHe saw a vague silhouette emerge from the dark and move towards him. As his eyes continued to adjust, he saw she was tall, dressed in a black three piece suit, with two matching Foundation pins in each lapel. In one pocket, a silver chain dangled, likely the tail of an ornate pocket watch. He couldn't make out her face. He saw her bare feet crush the swampy grass, but heard no sound of crunching vegetation, or rustling clothes. He saw the grass behind her turn to straw and wilt, and then turn red.\n\n\nThe fatherless son amidst bastards\n saw what she saw with his other eye. He saw himself; a bloodless, blank-featured corpse protruding from a tall, leaf-less alder tree, his face frozen in a wide-eyed scream. Two streaks of sap flow from his eyes and drip from his jaw onto the mossy green grass; the only other part of him sticking out from the crease-less bark is his left arm, hand grasping at air.\n\n\nShe of the sanguine tears\n: \"This won't do.\"\n\n\nHe saw her reach into the pocket with the silver pocket-watch chain, saw her pull out the combat knife it was connected to. She stopped inches away from him, and then, grabbing the handle of the knife with both hands, she thrust it straight into the tree's trunk, inches below his jaw where his neck would be. She yanked the knife earthwards, and the wood rent where the blade moved like she's stripping the flesh from cooked meat. The gaping wound she creates expels a mist of flies and gold, and \nthe man with tattoos of winged things\n sloshed onto the ground, dressed in a Foundation D-class uniform, writhing in a viscous pool of amber fluid.\n\n\nAs the vision of what she sees vanishes from his other eye, he is finally able to see her face, and every nerve in his body fires a 'run, run right now' message to every limb he has. His jaw started to ache, and he realized he was voicelessly screaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer jaw and cheeks and flowing dark hair were human enough, except for the rivulets of blood streaming over her chin, down her neck and into her suit. Then there was what the top half of her head was covered with. To say it was merely a mask was understating it. Someone might as well have ripped a giant rabbit's head off and smashed it onto her head. The blood spilling down her front was pouring from under meat veil. She stared at him with wet red eyes.\n\n\nHe realized those weren't eyes. Instead furry skin stretched where there normally would have been sockets, soaked through with twin shapeless patches of blood.\n\n\nHe wheezed, coughed up more sap, and found his voice again.\n\n\nThe man with the missing finger\n:\n \"They got to you too?\"\n\n\nThe unsung savior of all mankind\n:\n \n<Chuckling, yet shaking her head, as though pitying a confused child>\n \"They got to me a long time ago.\"\n\n\nThe friendless child amidst the ruins\n:\n \"You\u2026you weren't really a therapist, were you?\"\n\n\nThe harbinger of a new era\n:\n \"No, I suppose we've never properly been introduced. Let's fix that, shall we?\"\n\n\nShe waved her arms, and dispelled the glittering, pestilent mist. She leaned her head into the jagged, weeping tear in the now-sagging tree, and he heard her whisper something inside of it. She walked back over to him and grabbed his hair, and he shrieked in surprise as she dragged him away from the tree seconds before it burst into flame.\n\n\nThe heat licked his feet and warmed his cheeks. All at once, the expanding air popped and he heard and felt a strong breeze move over him, move \nthrough\n him\n\n\nShout in Whispers\n:\n \"Wha-what did you just do?!\"\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \"I gave you a Name, so you can return to the Real.\"\n\n\nShout\n:\n \"And what about you?\"\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \"I guess I will, too.\"\n\n\nShe extended a hand to Shout, and he accepted her help standing up. Now that his sense of sight and depth perception had fully returned to him, he realized O5-06 was quite a bit taller than he was. At six foot five, with a stature closer to a weight lifter than an administrator, she looked like she could easily pick him up and fold him like a chair. She spoke with a low contralto, and what Shout could only describe as a tender growl. She sounded shockingly human.\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \"Home is this way, Shout. Come with me.\"\n\n\nShout\n:\n \"I have no home. Where's my wife?\"\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \n<Laughs>\n \"I know you don't. Now, come and see.\"\n\n\nIn no time at all, she led him to a large well. When he stared at the surface of its water, instead of a reflection, he saw his wife from behind running from something, racing down the Level 5 hallway at Site-46. He could hear the sound of gunfire echo from the well. He saw her kick open a door, slam the door shut, and hold a scientist at gunpoint.\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \"She's more tenacious than I expected. We will have to move quickly.\"\n\n\nShout\n:\n \"The hell do you mean?\"\n\n\nO5-06\n:\n \"Wake up, Shout. Let your instincts guide you and your wife to safety. And always remember, I will always be with you, even after everyone else abandoned you.\"\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8000-3:\n On 9/27/2024, the Foundation initiated Project Erlk\u00f6nig to produce an eigenweapon capable of combatting the anomalous threat. This resulted in the disappearance of all but two progeny of Foundation staff. The parents discovered needles in their uniforms stained with blood belonging to the vanished children. The two exceptions were nomenclatively mutated individuals \nShout in Whispers\n and \nNever Fades Away\n.\n\n\nThis inflicted a critical blow to organizational morale, sparking widespread defections to US government. Posited reasons include dissatisfaction with Foundation leadership, fatalism regarding the organization's future, perception of recklessness in Project Erlk\u00f6nig, and indications the government has acquired undetermined leverage against high ranking members of Foundation staff. Security architecture of Foundation is significantly compromised, and nerve stapling has been authorized as a disciplinary alternative to termination for staff retention purposes.\n\n\n\n\nTraceback: 804 \"Secret Handshake\" Exception: current authenticated user invalid\non null in\nStack trace:\n#0 /home/wp_9w2zak/mydomain.com/wp-includes/class-wp-hook.php(303):\nerce_shi...')\n#4\n/home/wp_9w2zak/mydomain.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-shipping.php(114):\n\nDeploying malware...\nInstalled; running 'JANUS.exe' \n\n\"We see you too, assholes\"\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Infiltrator AI:\n\n\nClient annotations enabled\n\n\nTime:\n Two hundred hours;\n\n\nAddress: Langley, Virginia.\n\n\nEntity of interest:\n \"Data-fortress Motherwill\": US government cyberwarfare nexus responsible for offensive operations against Foundation infrastructure.
