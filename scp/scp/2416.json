If SCP-2416-21 dies for any reason, Mobile Task Force Omicron-8 \"Send In The Clowns\" is to be placed on high alert, and the replacement instance is to be apprehended and contained in the same manner as soon as possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2416 refers to multiple instances of a 35-year-old Caucasian human male named Joseph Grunderson-Pike. Despite having unextraordinary brain activity and no history of neurological disorders, SCP-2416 displays diminished intellectual capacity and a high likelihood of getting into a lethal accident.\n\n\nOn 1/14/2006, SCP-2416-1, the original\n1\n instance, was killed after walking onto an expressway in Chicago. This was not believed to have been suicide; shortly before it was struck by a speeding minivan, its last words were reportedly \"Hey, this isn't State street!\" SCP-2416-1 had funeral services, was cremated, and its death was reported in multiple Chicago newspapers.\n\n\nOn 3/15/2006, a living instance of SCP-2416, SCP-2416-2, was stabbed to death in Omaha after it tied a convicted murderer's shoelaces together for a prank. SCP-2416-2 was determined by law enforcement officials to be an outsider with no friends or relations in Omaha and was buried.\n\n\nIt is unknown how a new instance of SCP-2416 appears after the death of a previous instance. The latest instance always claims to have no recollection of having died at all, and has passed multiple polygraph tests while giving this testimony. The origin point of a \"reincarnated\" instance has never been successfully located, and all sightings of SCP-2416 instances have been after-the-fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nCause of Death\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-3\n\n\nOverconsumption of pepper sauce.\n\n\nWitnesses report that SCP-2416-3 was attempting to become \"the spiciest\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-4\n\n\nHead split in half with a table saw.\n\n\nLast words were reportedly \"gimme a kiss\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-5\n\n\nMauled by a puma.\n\n\nHad covered self in uncooked bacon in a zoo puma habitat on a dare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-6\n\n\nRattlesnake bite.\n\n\nLast words were reportedly \"gimme a kiss\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-7\n\n\nSlept in the center of a freeway.\n\n\nWas \"tired\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-8\n\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\nThe badgers suffered only minor injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-9\n\n\nShot by Chilean anarchists.\n\n\nLast words were reportedly \"gimme a kiss\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-10\n\n\nSubjected to voluntary human experimentation by Church of the Broken God scientists; ultimate cause of death was cranial hemorrhage.\n\n\nCorpse was discovered by the Foundation in a raid on the CotBG compound; Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported corpse's resemblance to an urban legend about a man who comes back from the dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-11\n\n\nAttempted to climb the side of the Chrysler Building without proper equipment.\n\n\nReports of death confirmed anomalous properties; Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 orders the capture of SCP-2416.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-12\n\n\nCocaine overdose.\n\n\nBelieved it would alleviate sinus congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-13\n\n\nAlcohol poisoning.\n\n\nBelieved it would \"lubricate\" a broken arm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-14\n\n\nExsanguinated after shoving a foot into a blender.\n\n\nCircumstances unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-15\n\n\nShot by Site-59 security personnel for accessing a STURM-class infohazard.\n\n\nThis iteration was the first to come under Foundation custody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-16\n\n\nChoked on food rations at Site-59.\n\n\n\"Really liked\" oatmeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-17\n\n\nHead fracture from slamming own head on wall of its cell.\n\n\nWas attempting to swat a fly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-18\n\n\nClimbed into Site-59 incinerator.\n\n\nWas looking for a bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-19\n\n\nGained access to a lethal cognitohazard.\n\n\nWas \"just curious.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2416-20\n\n\nOverdose of Acetaminophen at Site-59.\n\n\nSee below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-2416-20\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Ichinose\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Ichinose:\n Please state your name for the record, SCP-2416-20.\n\n\nSCP-2416-20:\n Joe Grunderson-Pike.
