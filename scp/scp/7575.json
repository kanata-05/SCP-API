Subsequent events led to the conclusion of several indirectly observed/confirmed sentient entities being unaccounted-for personnel.\n8\n\n\nThe Foundation became aware of additional anomalous properties following the semi-accidental discovery of an Extra-Reality Data Cache (ERDC-7575) by Dr. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n, now known as \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n, with assistance by \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\n, and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.\n\n\nStored inside the cache was a database of over 247,000 entries detailing mundane actions and activities carried out by a collective team of 12 supposed Foundation personnel, led by \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .
