Throughout all the investigations, none of the SCP-8333-1 instances exhibited anomalous properties following confiscation, even those returned to their original owners for experimental purposes. -Dr. R. Mercer\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8333 is an anomalous phenomenon that affects handmade clothing, particularly miniature garments used to adorn dolls, stuffed animals, or other similar objects. Items affected by SCP-8333 are designated SCP-8333-1.\n1\n\n\nSCP-8333\u2019s primary effects are believed to be protective; testing has been ineffective (see appended document SCP-8333-12-2) in determining precise abilities. Attributes tentatively associated with SCP-8333 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8333 manifests when a passphrase is spoken by the creator, usually when the SCP-8333-1 instance is completed or gifted.\n2\n The passphrase is, \u201cThus do I dress the loves of my life.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8333 imbues the affected instance of SCP-8333-1 with anomalous durability, presumably a resistance to dust buildup, wear-and-tear, and staining. This longevity can allegedly be maintained by speaking another passphrase, which is currently unknown.\n\n\nSCP-8333 will only manifest if the creator makes a wish on the instance of SCP-8333-1.\n\n\nOwners of SCP-8333-1 instances consistently claim that they experience more restful, uninterrupted sleep when near an instance of SCP-8333-1 that belongs to them. This statement has been identified across interviewees of various backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of information compiled regarding SCP-8333\u2019s effects comes directly from Serpent\u2019s Hand associates, in place of empirical trials carried out by Foundation scientists. This is indicative of a lack of consistent anomalous activity; furthermore, research teams assigned to SCP-8333 have been unable to use recovered SCP-8333-1 instances to replicate the civilian-observed effects in laboratory settings. -Dr. R. Mercer\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8333 initially came to Foundation attention following the publication of myriad news articles featuring a \u201cFairy Ring Sewing Circle\u201d group. The group\u2019s various social media accounts drew high amounts of internet traffic due to coverage of its charity endeavors involving local hospitals. Specifically, the Foundation was spurred to intervene when the group\u2019s largest charity event coincided with the sudden formation of multiple smaller \u201cfairy ring\u201d sewing circles also participating in the donation events\u2014the toys with handmade clothes contributed by many of these new groups were consistently described by recipients as \u201cmagical\u201d, and \u201cindescribable\u201d.\n\n\nAction was authorized after field agents discovered that many members of these new groups were associated with the Serpent\u2019s Hand group of interest.\n\n\n\n\nThe field agents in question didn\u2019t need to engage in any sort of sophisticated questioning to obtain the information regarding involvement of Hand associates. Interview logs (see extended files SCP-8333-4) indicate that the sewing circle members simply stated \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they were familiar with the Serpent\u2019s Hand. None of the interviewees were taken into custody, as all of them were, for all intents and purposes, normal civilians. Followup investigations into these potential persons of interest revealed no unusual behavior or predisposition for anomalous abilities. -Dr. R. Mercer\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8333-1:\n Due to a lack of viable data obtained from laboratory trials involving SCP-8333-1 instances, the Foundation attempted to contact members of the \u201cFairy Ring\u201d hobbyist groups for further information regarding their anomalous crafts. Dr. Riven Mercer, acting as an ambassador between the Foundation and the Serpent\u2019s Hand, was granted a series of interviews with one such group under the condition that the contents of the interviews not be released to the public.\n\n\nAn excerpt of the second interview in the series is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Interview-8333-2:\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. R. Mercer\n\n\nInterviewees:\n Members of the \u201cGathering Godmothers\u201d sewing circle, offshoot of the original \u201cFairy Ring\u201d group. Aliases \u201cBee\u201d, \u201cMagpie\u201d, \u201cLioness\u201d, \u201cEwe\u201d, and \u201cTuna\u201d are used in place of the individuals\u2019 legal names.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Thank you again for agreeing to this interview.\n\n\nLioness:\n Thank you for keeping your promise about the sewing kit. I trust the pattern is simple enough to follow?\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n I\u2019ll try my best. I\u2019ve only ever done simple embroidery and some mending, so it might take me a few tries to get the hemming down. And I\u2019ll practice the buttonhole stitch on mockups like you suggested.\n\n\nMagpie:\n That\u2019s an important one, you know, can\u2019t have the arm holes fraying after you put the coat on the bear! And it\u2019s much easier to sew thread around an opening than add a tiny tiny sleeve onto a tiny coat. Sleeves are the literal devil, mind you, but you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about sleeves.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n I\u2019ll keep that in mind. Can you tell me a little more about these bears? And their clothes?\n\n\nBee:\n Well, the bears we just get on the cheap. Drug stores, grocery stores, big box stores with small displays. Usually near greeting cards. Lots of sales after holidays. Mind your scissors dear, they\u2019ll fall off your lap.\n\n\nEwe:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n I see. And what about the clothes?\n\n\nTuna:\n It all started with a friend of ours. Someone\u2019s great-aunt or somesuch, twice removed, what have you. We all just called her \u201cAuntie\u201d. Nice lady. Moved away at some point, no one knows where she went. I miss her.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n And this \u201cAuntie\u201d, she taught you the patterns?\n\n\nMagpie:\n Nope! She gave us some bears she made cute clothes for, though. And it all sort of snowballed from there, you see. All of us had something or other that was really bothering us, but for some reason\u2026 having that bear around, just felt nice, you know? Like someone was thinking of you. Looking out for you. Saying they were on your side, even if you didn\u2019t even know if you were on your own side or not. We didn\u2019t even ask for the bears, she just gave them out because she had spare time or something. I don\u2019t know if she had any other hobbies, I just always saw her sewing. Seemed happy doing it, especially when we brought her old clothes we outgrew and she could cut up for scraps.\n\n\nBee:\n I couldn\u2019t sleep during nursing school. Slept better when the bear from Auntie was by the pillow. Always slept well since. You dropped your pincushion.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Oh, thank you. Was there anything special about how she made clothes for the bears?\n\n\nTuna:\n Isn\u2019t anything made by hand these days inherently special in some way? It\u2019s so hard to find time in one\u2019s day to do something nice for yourself, let alone think about someone else in these hectic times.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n So the bears are entirely ordinary?\n\n\nTuna:\n Well, I didn\u2019t quite say that, hmm? I\u2019ll have you know that \nmy\n bear got me through a nasty breakup, better than any food or TV show or sleep medication ever did.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Can you tell me more about that process?\n\n\nLioness:\n Careful.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Sorry if I overstepped.\n\n\nLioness:\n We will let you know which questions we will answer. So far as the bears go\u2026 would you consider something made with care \u201cordinary\u201d?\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Maybe, compared to something made with care that has, say, magical properties.\n\n\nTuna:\n Oh, and what would you consider magic, science man?\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Something that science can\u2019t explain?\n\n\nBee:\n Why do people carve their initials into trees? Why do people snap love locks to fences and throw away the keys? Is that magic?\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Please elaborate.\n\n\nTuna:\n It\u2019s all a matter of perspective, really. Would you consider the Mona Lisa magical because she can make people cry, or smile, or contemplate life, all just by looking at her?\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n I suppose not. In that same vein, does that mean you just find the bears soothing to be around, because Auntie made them specially for you?\n\n\nMagpie:\n I think you\u2019ll need to sit with the circle a few more weeks before we start talking about the super secret details of our past lives, silly. Your mockups have been looking better compared to last time, though, doctor. Huh, huh, what do you think?\n\n\nEwe:\n He is improving. Better than the last newcomer.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n I\u2019ll try my best. Will there be other novices joining me in later sessions?\n\n\nMagpie:\n Ah\u2026 no. Most likely not. Fewer and fewer people ask us to teach them, when they happen to find us. And most of those who do try to learn, don\u2019t keep up with it. And of course, right around the corner are people who say handmade crafts are for old grannies who need to give up and whiny babies who need to grow up.\n\n\nDr. Mercer:\n Is that why you\u2019ve all continued making these bears? To prove a point?\n\n\nLioness:\n We work with our hands to convey our hearts. Perhaps someday, you too will have a wish you would like to manifest in the same way.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-8333-2:\n As of three years following the initial classification of SCP-8333, Facility Oversight has agreed to review the proposal put forth by Dr. Riven Mercer, co-director of Kiryu Laboratories at Site-17, to re-classify SCP-8333 as a low-tier Unexplained Phenomenon. A panel will be convened for Dr. Mercer\u2019s team to present their findings.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0follow-up\u00a0documentation\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0follow-up\u00a0documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimen of SCP-8333-1 generated by Dr. R. Mercer. Currently stationed at Site-17 per standing agreement with the Serpent\u2019s Hand \u201cWishweaver\u201d faction, to be entrusted to the custody of Dr. Mercer\u2019s godson for further analysis. Empirical observation may continue if deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOversight\u2019s decision is acknowledged. Kiryu Labs will officially begin the transfer process effective immediately. Corresponding documentation will be updated to reflect the new non-SCP designation, and any remaining items in storage will be moved to low concern locker vaults, or restored to their original owners.\n\n\nThe second passphrase is, \u201cWith the dearest of wishes my heart can weave forth.\u201d -Dr. R. Mercer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \u201cTeddy bear\u201d toys are the most commonly observed instances of SCP-8333-1.\n\n\n2\n.
