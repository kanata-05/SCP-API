        "Following the indirect neutralization of SCP-6978, as of 11th of March 2021 five additional anomalies similar to SCP-6978 were found in an alternate dimension. All of those dimensions fulfil the standard necessary for \"Exempla\" classification, and by that are meant the following criteria: Extremely high similarity in the current state of the planet Earth, including existing people, events, locations and objects. Similarity of outcome of broadly defined high-dimensional/hyperreal structures and entities. Proximity of actions of known groups and individuals to our reality; groups can be expected to act in similar ways to our universe counterparts. It is unknown whether the discovery of all SCP-6978 instances occurred in Exempla universes due to specific traits of those realities, or whether it is a coincidence.",
