Testing of SCP-4815's remains are not permitted in line with current humanoid EC protocols.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4815 is a 56 year old woman named Theresa Miller. SCP-4815 claims that in the future she will experience a temporal phenomenon which will allow her to telepathically communicate with herself at previous points in her life. SCP-4815 claims that the voice communicating with her is 85 years old. This voice, or the instance of SCP-4815 that exists in the future, is referred to as SCP-4815-1.\n\n\nSCP-4815 is capable of predicting events that she will experience, although this accuracy is entirely dependent on information that SCP-4815-1 has chosen to relay to her. SCP-4815 states that SCP-4815-1 is not always honest regarding events that will occur.\n\n\nSCP-4815 experiences behavioral and emotional difficulties relating to SCP-4815-1's influence, experiencing obsessive behaviors and thoughts stemming from severe anxiety. Information relayed to SCP-4815 from SCP-4815-1's is sometimes inaccurate or malicious. Further information and personal accounts can be found in the attached addenda.\n\n\nSCP-4815 claims to have heard this voice since early adolescence. SCP-4815 has otherwise lived an unremarkable life, only coming to the Foundation's attention after checking herself in to a local mental health center, and demonstrably proving her precognitive abilities to the medical staff [After which medical records in the area were parsed and containment protocols were enacted by staff at Site-18].\n\n\nSCP-4815-1 is not known. SCP-4815 claims SCP-4815-1 is in a coma, or a place where \"she's not awake\".\n\n\nRelated Materials:\n Written Accounts from Theresa Miller's Journal\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a04815-PE-1\u00a0Text\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n2/25/2000\n The Old Me\n\n\n\n\nI've been hearing from her since I was little. It seems like she doesn't ever shut up. She tells me what to do, where to go, how to get out of this and that. How I'm supposed to be, you know? I tell her that if I just did it my way it might turn out different, but she says she knows better since she already went through it. The longer I've been listening to her the less I think that's really true. I think it's a self fulfilling prophecy; if I hadn't heard from her I woulda' been fine, really. What she's doing, living vicariously.\n\n\nShe fucked up at one point is what I think what it was. Not me. I don't think I'm really her, not really. When she tells me not to do something, it's because she didn't do it right the first time. I wised up to that quick. If she didn't do it the way I did, she's not me.\n\n\nI think I'm her second chance. If I ever run into this woman, if I really do hit 85\u2026 If I start seeing me back when I was young, then I'm going to lay down and die right there, or at least I hope you'll put me to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n3/26/2002\n Trust\n\n\n\n\nI was 19, I think. I was walking away from the bus stop. I hear tires screeching, some asshole cut around the bus and almost slammed headlong into a truck. Old Theresa told me to run, \nseconds\n before I heard the noise, and this dumb-ass flies past me into a streetlight. Clipped my arm on his mirror passenger side mirror.\n\n\nI had so many \"near misses\" that I wouldn't have gotten through without Old Theresa, and that's what really got me thinking about her. Seemed like every other week, there was my mortality lurking around the corner. No one is that unlucky, not in this part of the world, not even for me, not even in the neighborhood I grew up in would someone run into that kind of trouble so often.\n\n\n\n\n1/15/2008\n Agency\n\n\n\n\nI think everyone is going to hurt you, some people just aren't as good at it.\n\n\nI was my parents more than they were. I taught myself the basics. I didn't have much choice though. Old Theresa taught me because they didn't, I think. I heard a saying that you have to be the adult you needed when you were a kid, and I think she took that to heart.\n\n\nThe problem is I never did it \nmy\n way. I couldn't. Old Theresa will flood my head with noise if I don't think the right thing. I went to therapy. They teach you this technique where you can categorize thoughts, pick the ones that aren't of any use to you, and you can put them in a mental bin. Works for a lot of bad cases, lots of people go in wrecks and come out even.\n\n\nBut me\u2026 I have an old woman flooding my head with noise, I have a sealed globe attached to my neck filled with swirling sound. I can't toss that out. She wakes me up when I'm sleeping. I hear her in my dreams free associating about what's happening. The stupid bitch.\n\n\nHave you ever heard of trepanning? I looked into it.\n\n\n\n\n12/12/2012\n Why I Haven't Won The Lottery\n\n\n\n\nIf I am old Theresa, then old Theresa doesn't deserve the good life.\n\n\nShe says that's a self fulfilling prophecy. The audacity.\n\n\n\n\n1/29/2014\n I Hate\n\n\n\n\nOld Theresa heard the voice \u201cWhen she was younger\u201d, and she still does. She\u2019s just running out of creative ways to fuck with me.\n\n\nWhen I meet her I'm going to kill her.\n\n\n\n\n5/12/2016\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to meet her soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum A:\n SCP-4815 was considered a neutralized object as of 02/15/2017. On the morning of 12/15/2016 SCP-4815 experienced a psychotic episode and began attempting self injury. SCP-4815 was sedated up until this point, after which she passed due to natural causes.\n\n\nSCP-4815 is referenced as the civilian Theresa Miller on future archival records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4814\n | SCP-4815 | \nSCP-4816\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4815\n\" by faminepulse, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
