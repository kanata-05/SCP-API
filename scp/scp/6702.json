Constant moderate rain falls on the area covered by the lake; however, the water level of the lake does not rise as a result as would be expected.\n\n\nWhen a human subject enters SCP-6702, an optical phenomenon will appear within the rain, mostly forming a clear image. These images can be captured by photographic devices. The existence of the events depicted in these images, as well as the links to the experimental subject, are currently being researched.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-6702 Photography Record\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-0321\n\n\nObserved image:\n The subject and an elderly woman sharing a reunion dinner\n1\n\n\nNotes:\n The woman in the image has been confirmed to be D-0321's mother.

The wooden floor collapses and the audience is visible through the hole. At the same time there is a lot of cash spilling from the ceiling.\n\n\nNotes:\n D-5202 was formerly a musician.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Bruce\n\n\nObserved image:\n The subject is being married.
