Do not give \nSCP\n-4893-A any device that allows him/her to write \ntext\n40\n in any way (handwriting, typing, etc.). All communication with \nSCP\n-4893-A shall be conducted by voice recording only.\n\n\n\nAs of \n1960\n41\n, \nSCP\n-4893-A will have a microchip with GPS and vital detection in the left clavicle subcutaneous tissue.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n42\n:\n \nSCP\n-4893 is a humanoid that causes \nsynesthesia\n43\n44\n in the reader where stimulation by \ntexts\n written by \nSCP\n-4893 produces visions of synonymous flowers in the floriography. The person who \nsees\n45\n the \ntexts\n written by \nSCP\n-4893 will acquire the same \nanomaly\n46\n as \nSCP\n-4893 (\nSCP\n-4893-A).\n\n\n\n\nSCP\n-4893 was discovered with an \nanomalous\n \npoetry book\n47\n(\nSCP\n-4893-1) in \n1550\n when the rumor that a flowering \nbook\n was \nfound\n in a village outside \nMaastricht, The Netherlands\n48\n, caught \nthe Foundation\n's interest. \nThe Foundation\n initially \nviewed\n \nSCP\n-4893-1 as the cause of the \nanomaly\n, but the \nformer\n49\n owner of \nSCP\n-4893-1(\nSCP\n-4893-A-1) confessed he created \nSCP\n-4893-1. As a result SCP-4893-A-1 was found to be the main cause of the \nanomaly\n.\n\n\n\nWhen an individual \nreads\n an instance of \nSCP\n-4893, they become an instance of \nSCP\n-4893-A, and the instance's writings acquire the properties of \nSCP\n-4893 \nuntil death\n50\n. Prior to \n1758\n, \nD-class\n51\n were exposed to \nSCP\n-4893 in order to maintain at least one extant instance of \nSCP\n-4893-A, but repeated \ncontainment\n52\n breaches led to the adoption of current \ncontainment procedures\n53\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ For SCP-4893 Head Researcher's eyes only\n- To my successor\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, \n54\n on the promotion.\n\n\n\nFrom today, you are the \n55\n researcher of \n56\n-4893, and thus \n-4893 itself. It'll be very difficult for you to \n57\n this \n58\n, but you'll get used to it soon.\n\n\n\nWell, you might be wondering. Why do I have to become \n-4893? Why not use \n59\n?\n\n\n\nIt was like that at first when \n-4893 was \n. In fact, \n-4893 has been \n60\n for many years by \n61\n, young \n. But there is something very different now: the literacy rate. Now many people can read and write \n in \n62\n and \n63\n countries. Inevitably, the possibility of exposure to \n-4893's \n64\n has increased. Any \n written or typed by \n-4893 is a source of infection. There have been cases in which a \n who have \n \n-4893 in the past carved \n on the wall and made many of the \n65\n become \n-4893.\n\n\n\nOur \n66\n67\n is \"\n68\n, \n69\n,\n70\n\". It is not good enough to just \n and \n any \n. It is therefore best to choose \n-4893's \n from among \n71\n72\n73\n personnel who can understand the \n's \n and carry it out. \n what we have \n and \n. And someday you will \n74\n the \n75\n to someone else. \n76\n\n\n\n\n77\n \n-4893 \n Researcher\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \"superstition\"\"animosity\"\n\n\n2\n. \"deceit\"\n\n\n3\n. \"danger\"\"caution\"\"beware\"\n\n\n4\n. \"strength\"\n\n\n5\n. \"danger\"\n\n\n6\n. \"you are special\"\n\n\n7\n. \"I am your captive\"\n\n\n8\n. \"protection\"\n\n\n9\n. \"confidence and shelter\"\n\n\n10\n. \"look at me\"\n\n\n11\n. \"message\"\n\n\n12\n. \"rich knowledge\"\n\n\n13\n. \"pastoral poetry\"\n\n\n14\n. flower emblem of the Netherlands\n\n\n15\n. \"enchantment\"\n\n\n16\n. \"imagination\"\n\n\n17\n. \"time\"\n\n\n18\n. \"I surmount difficulties\"\n\n\n19\n. \"wisdom\"\n\n\n20\n. \"a good education\"\n\n\n21\n. \"protection\"\n\n\n22\n. \"resignation and good-bye\"\n\n\n23\n. \"memories\"\n\n\n24\n. \"oblivion\"\n\n\n25\n. \"death\"\n\n\n26\n. birth flower of December\n\n\n27\n. \"secrecy and silence\"\n\n\n28\n. \"superstition\"\"animosity\"\n\n\n29\n. \"truth\"\n\n\n30\n. \"danger\"\"caution\"\"beware\"\n\n\n31\n. \"strength\"\n\n\n32\n. \"caution\"\"beware\"\n\n\n33\n. \"you are special\"\n\n\n34\n. \"I am your captive\"\n\n\n35\n. \"protection\"\n\n\n36\n. \"confidence and shelter\"\n\n\n37\n. \"I surmount difficulties\"\n\n\n38\n. \"wisdom\"\n\n\n39\n. \"a good education\"\n\n\n40\n. \"message\"\n\n\n41\n. \"time\"\n\n\n42\n. \"rich knowledge\"\n\n\n43\n. \"enchantment\"\n\n\n44\n. \"imagination\"\n\n\n45\n. \"look at me\"\n\n\n46\n. \"mystery\"\n\n\n47\n. \"pastoral poetry\"\n\n\n48\n. flower emblem of the Netherlands\n\n\n49\n. \"resignation and good-bye\"\n\n\n50\n. \"no change till death\"\n\n\n51\n. \"sacrifice\"\n\n\n52\n. \"I am your captive\"\n\n\n53\n. \"protection\"\n\n\n54\n. \"celebration\"\n\n\n55\n. \"importunity\"\n\n\n56\n. \"superstition\"\"animosity\"\n\n\n57\n. \"look at me\"\n\n\n58\n. \"message\"\n\n\n59\n. \"sacrifice\"\n\n\n60\n. \"continuance\"\n\n\n61\n. \"healthy\"\n\n\n62\n. \"pioneer\"\n\n\n63\n. \"arrear\"\n\n\n64\n. \"anathema\"\n\n\n65\n. \"companion\"\n\n\n66\n. \"ambition\"\n\n\n67\n. \"chivalry\"\n\n\n68\n. \"confidence and shelter\"\n\n\n69\n. \"I am your captive\"\n\n\n70\n. \"protection\"\n\n\n71\n. \"I surmount difficulties\"\n\n\n72\n. \"wisdom\"\n\n\n73\n. \"a good education\"\n\n\n74\n. \"I offer you my all\"\n\n\n75\n. \"promise\"\n\n\n76\n. \"good luck\"\n\n\n77\n. \"resignation and good-bye\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4892\n | SCP-4893 | \nSCP-4894\n \u00bb",
