Of Anomalous Communications and Relations\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis project is in current collaboration with the Dept. Of A.C.R, and the Director Dr. Cole Thereven has been made the current anomaly project director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDr. Bright, accompanied by his handler at an Anomalous Victims Meeting. Dr. Bright was and currently is suffering from Multiple Semi-Personality Overlap.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The corpse of SCP-6170 is stored in a Cryogenic Biovault at Area-34. Personnel are allowed access with permission from the SCP-6170 Project Head and one member of the O5 Council. Under no circumstances is the corpse of SCP-6170 to be dissected, modified, or otherwise desecrated. \n.\nDraugr-Class Objects are considered Neutralised or Decommissioned, but ongoing anomalous phenomena originates from them.\n\n\nAnomalies affected or created by SCP-6170-A are to be catalogued underneath a SCP-6170-B designation, but still retain a main database slot. If at all possible, SCP-6170-B instances are to be decommissioned.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6170 refers to a sentient entity that, until an incident in mid-2016, existed within \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ohio. SCP-6170 demonstrated stabilizing effects on anomalous phenomena, not just in its general vicinity but throughout reality. Objects with anomalous traits brought close to SCP-6170 would have these properties diminished, or in some cases, outright nullified.\n\n\nIn mid-2016, due to circumstances outside of the Foundation's control, SCP-6170 was fatally wounded via gunshot wound. At first, no negative effects from its death were recorded and SCP-6170 was classified as Neutralised. However, recent analysis indicates that this incident has resulted in an increased amount of anomalous activity\n.\nFor context, the amount of SCPs classified per year in \n1976\n was 3,406. In 2010 it was 5,231, in 2015 it was 5,754, and in 2017 it was 19,233.\n. Some preexisting anomalies have exhibited drastic changes in their nature, further deviating from normalcy. This ongoing event has been classified as SCP-6170-A.\n\n\nOn top of the above proliferation of the anomalous, reality has also begun to show signs of deterioration and collapse. The Average Hume Level for Earth and the surrounding space had decreased by 0.02Hm between 2016 and 2017, a stark difference from the previous annual decline of 5\n-12\nHm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6170.1\n\n\nDEATH OF SCP-6170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nThis section of the file is Level 5/6170 classified, thus unavailable at your security level.\n\n\nPLEASE CONTINUE TO THE NEXT SECTION.\n\n\n\n\n6170\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6170.2\n\n\nEFFECTS OF SCP-6170-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the increased rate of anomalous activities noted above in the Description, a sharp increase in what could be considered \"negative\" events has occurred. This has ranged from the installation of dictatorships in third-world countries to an up-mark in the amount of annual natural disasters. On top of this, many preexisting anomalies have shown alterations to their anomalous properties. In many of these cases these alterations have resulted in properties that either pose a greater risk to human life or actively attempt to break the Veil. Below is a non-exhaustive list of anomalies affected by SCP-6170-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\n\nOBJECT CLASS\n\n\nIMAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-682\n\n\nKETER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a containment breach two weeks after the death of SCP-6170, SCP-682 managed to escape into a local mountain range. After a month of searching, SCP-682 was discovered to have turned into a fleshy, stationary structure resembling a dead tree. Instead of fruits, SCP-682 bears small, reptilian-like organisms. The organisms demonstrate the same adaptability and regenerative ability as SCP-682. While they regenerate at a much slower pace and have shown to be capable of being terminated, they still pose a considerable threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\n\nOBJECT CLASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-963\n/Dr. Jack Bright\n\n\nEUCLID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"minds\" SCP-963 had previously overridden have all simultaneously resurfaced, causing irreparable damage to the psyche of Dr. Jack Bright. While it was originally believed that the individuals SCP-963 were completely destroyed, this development has revealed that the amulet stores them in a similar fashion to \nSCP-3663\n. This has resulted in a condition similar to Multiple Semi-Personality Overlap, in which more than one individuals attempt to co-exist within the same body and exert control over the others.\n\n\n\nCracks have begun to show on the ruby in the amulet's centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\n\nOBJECT CLASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4999\n\n\nKETER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4999's anomalous ability pattern has completely reversed, appearing at birthings, handing the father a cigar, and holding the newborn child. SCP-4999 has made itself known to the public, sometimes appearing on the news. However, one trait is retained, SCP-4999 does not speak. SCP-4999 has become an icon, becoming the subject of many birthday cards, and gaining nicknames such as \"Giver of Life\" or \"Father Birth\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\n\nOBJECT CLASS\n\n\nIMAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2000\n\n\nNeutralized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore its neutralization, SCP-2000's BZHRs had begun to malfunction.

A myriad of animal civilizations formed throughout the world, most of which follow a social order similar to SCP-1845. A majority of these feudal civilizations follow a denomination of Christianity which states that Adam and Eve were in fact two \nprokaryotic cells\n given life by God. Their beliefs also postulate that all non-hominoids are the true inheritors of the Earth, and that humans are merely a roadblock put there by the Devil. While a majority of these civilizations have yet to show active hostility towards humans, some of the pre-established ones (such as SCP-1845 and SCP-3932-\u0394) have declared war on humanity at large.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 02/12/2101:\n Species within the Arthropoda phylum and Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes classes have begun to show signs of sapience and active hostility towards humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\n\nOBJECT CLASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5441\n\n\nKeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe character \"Dave\" within SCP-5441 had become aware and attacked amnestics distributers during the monthly amnestic procedures with a pepper spray canister taped underneath his desk. \"Dave\" then informed the other inhabitants of SCP-5441 of their current situation.

Discussion among the O5 council resulted in an attempt to revive SCP-6170 via anomalous technology.\n\n\nOn 23/11/2021, in an attempt to alleviate the effects of SCP-6170's death, Project Attis attempted to revive the entity via the usage of other anomalies and paratechnology.\n\n\nThe revival was considered a success. Despite this, no noticable changes in Hume levels and reality were observed. The now revived SCP-6170, seemingly distraught by its resurrection, went on a rampage, escaping its containment chamber and fatally wounding 5 Foundation personnel. Before further damage could be done, Mobile Task Force Beta-7 was dispatched and successfully terminated SCP-6170. Among those killed in the breach was Dr. Cole Thereven, a prominent member of the anomaly's research team.\n\n\nProject Attis was a failure. Hume levels continue to decrease at an ever-increasing rate, and the amount of anomalies detected on a yearly basis continues rising at a steady rate.

This would exempt the portions of the body that suffered massive damage, and extreme blood loss. The head was the only portion of the body that avoided mass trauma. Foundation forces were stretched thin as a result of SCP-6170-A, so finding personnel to fill Thereven's role was a waste of resources.\n\n\n \n\nMaterials included in Thereven's revival were:\n\n\n-\n Anomalous preserving brine,\n\n\n-\n Water conducted wires embedded within Thereven's brain,\n\n\n-\n A base, allowing Thereven to attain new memories.\n\n\n-\n Speakers, allowing Thereven to communicate.\n\n\nThe surgery was considered a success, reviving Thereven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6170.7\n\n\nGENERAL UPDATES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 05/12/2021\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n6999\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.03hm each 6 months\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n304,504\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n \nProject Attis has been decommissioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/06/2025\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n7865\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.05hm\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n552,212\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/06/2030\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n10,343\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.065hm\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n1,543,754\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/06/2040\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n60,534\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.1hm\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n1,540,100\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n The Veil has officially been declared as broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/06/2050\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n789,964\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.25hm\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n1,500,332\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n Multiple third-world countries have collapsed due to the increase of anomalous activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAUT0MATED UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/06/2070\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \nRUN-TIME ERROR '6': OVERFLOW\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.37\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n1,453,342\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMANUAL UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 25/11/\n2080\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n \n>10,000,000\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n \n0.5\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n \n~1,100,000\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMANUAL UPDATE\n\n\nDATE:\n 2090\n\n\nAMOUNT OF ACTIVE SCP SLOTS:\n Too fucking many.\n\n\nANNUAL DECREASE IN HUME:\n The Foundations are crumbling.\n\n\nNUMBER OF ACTIVE FOUNDATION PERSONNEL:\n I think everyone quit.\n\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n Society has collapsed.
