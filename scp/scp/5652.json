For feeding purposes, an \narchaeon\n (provided by the biological research facility) is to be placed into SCP-5652's petri dish daily.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5652 is a microscopic entity resembling an adult female hammerhead shark\n1\n with an approximate 4 \u03bcm body length. Its intelligence appears to be higher than an average non-anomalous member of its species. SCP-5652's primary diet is composed of various microorganisms but it notably prefers \nbacteria\n and \narchaea\n.\n\n\nSCP-5652 was discovered in Budapest within the bloodstream of Joseph Hem\u00e9r, a local architect. Hem\u00e9r recently arrived in Budapest from a Caribbean business trip\n2\n when he reportedly started to feel mild pain/discomfort in his cardiovascular system. Later during a medical examination, SCP-5652 was discovered and retrieved by the embedded Foundation agents, but the pain was still present.\n\n\nTwo days after SCP-5652's discovery, the source of the pain was found. 10 heavily damaged humanoid automatons of similar sizes to SCP-5652 were discovered embedded in the walls of Hem\u00e9r's blood vessels. The automatons are noted to have disproportionally large hands.\n\n\nFurther research revealed that the automatons were remote-controlled and a small symbol depicting a modified version of the \nFoundation's sigil\n was found printed on the chest of each automaton.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nSphyrna mokarran\n\n\n2\n.
