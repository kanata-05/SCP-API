Other than such requests, no people or coherent information may enter or leave the chamber. Two slats have been built into the structure which are used for delivery of food and waste. Any additional D-class must first be administered Grade-Z (permanent) dosages of \nClass-H and Class-I amnestics\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nRecovery Log:\n Foundation AICs flagged an unusual series of civilian and police deaths linked to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Preschool in New York, NY. \nMobile Task Force Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\")\n was sent in to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate/Time\n\n\nActions\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a014:21\n\n\nMTF-Pi-1 arrives at the location and establishes a perimeter.

Two members expire, one self-terminates. Operation aborted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the existence of a visual cognitohazard was suspected, Mobile Task Force Pi-1 was recalled and \nMobile Task Force Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\")\n was deployed. All windows and other openings were boarded up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate/Time\n\n\nActions\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a018:12\n\n\nMTF-Eta-10 is briefed on previous recovery attempts.\n\n\nTask force devises several plans for locating the anomaly. Members report minor head pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a018:15\n\n\nMTF-Eta-10 attempts to enter the building. Note that members are blind.\n\n\nMembers report intense migraines and blood loss.

After being equipped with external oxygen supplies and ear protection, they re-enter the building.\n\n\nMembers report minor head pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a019:04\n\n\nMTF-Eta-10 attempts to explore the building.\n\n\nThree members report head pain, two report nausea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a019:13\n\n\nMTF-Eta-10 arrives in the kitchen.\n\n\nThree members expire, remaining members are in critical condition. Operation aborted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal staff attempted to question the recovered toddler. The child was unaware that the preschool had no other living people. When asked about the behavior of preschool caretakers, the child began crying and bleeding profusely. Some staff present experienced nausea and blood loss. Medical staff administered Class-A amnestics and hospitalized those affected.\n\n\nCommand authorized the use of D-class personnel to contain the anomaly. All personnel were given sensory deprivation helmets with an external oxygen supply. Because of suspected anomalous effects, personnel were not briefed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate/Time\n\n\nActions\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a019:29\n\n\nD-87624 enters the building.\n\n\nD-87624 reports entering the kitchen. They have only minor tinnitus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a019:34\n\n\nD-87624 exits the building. D-87624 and D-11560 are equipped with plywood and wood glue, and then enter the building. Command instructs them to build a container.\n\n\nD-class personnel enter the kitchen. They report successfully marking out an area for the container, but also complain of haziness and lack of focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a019:48\n\n\nD-36710, who has past construction experience, enters the building with additional supplies.\n\n\nThey repeatedly attempt to assist, but say \"[their] mind feels like it's full of cotton\". No construction progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a020:17\n\n\nD-09714 enters the building. Due to interaction with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 they have minimal sensitivity in their limbs and frequently lose awareness of them. D-09714 is equipped with a flamethrower and instructed to incinerate any cadavers.\n\n\nD-09714 reports success and noted an intuitive understanding of their surroundings despite the helmet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a020:34\n\n\nD-09714 exits the building following cleanup. They are [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nTwo staff members expire, five are hospitalized. Security personnel terminate D-09714 and incinerate the remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a021:18\n\n\nD-22809 enters the building. Their file notes they were previously an entertainer, and are generally regarded as affable.\n\n\nPersonnel report that D-22809 is hurting morale. However, personnel also report D-22809 has been successful in constructing two container walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a021:32\n\n\nD-57702 is administered Class-I amnestics, equipped with thick mittens and given 80\u00a0cm stilt shoes,\n3\n and enters the building. They have prior brain damage.\n\n\nDespite difficulties entering the building, D-57702 reports clarity of mind while working on the task and claims to be very productive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/11\u00a022:50\n\n\nPersonnel request several items. D-41562 is administered 50mg Class-I amnestics and sent into the building with the requested supplies.\n\n\nApparently making use of said materials, D-11560 reports that preliminary containment had been achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe building was condemned by agents within the NYC Department of Buildings and was rebuilt as Provisional Site-597. During this process a standard humanoid containment chamber was built around the former kitchen area. The site was then acquired by Foundation front company Sunny Childcare and Preschool. The special containment procedures were formalized, and Dr. Archibald declared SCP-3597 contained.\n\n\nAfterwords, all personnel not inside the containment chamber were amnesticized and transferred to different projects. Guards with no knowledge of SCP-3597 except for its containment procedures were stationed within Provisional Site-597. To date there have been no breaches.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Both coroners who attempted autopsies suffered from internal hemorrhaging before being able to communicate cause of death. No further autopsies have been attempted.\n\n\n2\n. Upon examination, child appeared to be in normal condition. However, medical staff complained of head pain.\n\n\n3\n. D-57702 has no previous experience using stilt shoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naismallard's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5871\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1047-J\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4781\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5900\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5502\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5134\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4853\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4447\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4322\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7558\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8998\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4838\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4339\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5446\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1294-J\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nStealing Something Else\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pumpkin Mystery\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrunch Time\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heart of the Beast\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\naismallard's personnel file\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet The Staff\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3596\n | SCP-3597 | \nSCP-3598\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3597\n\" by aismallard, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
