As of now, no special containment procedures; standard containment enclosure.\n\n\nDescription:\n Appearing as a normal, varied-ethnicity/omni-racial human male, SCP-8207, Damien King, would seem like the farthest thing from an anomaly needing to be contained within the Foundation. However, their anomalous nature is revealed upon them even existing on the Foundation\u2019s grounds. They appeared as an employee one day, seemingly as if they had worked there all their life, and no one could discern where they came from and when. The real meat of their nature was made evident when they, along other D-Class personnel were made to clean the enclosure of SCP-0096, The Shy Guy. A-C-class personnel are aware of the effects and risk of 0096, but these D-Class and 8207 were not made aware. However, when one of the personnel laid eyes on the face of 0096, it simply turned around and its expression changed from a docile one to one of confusion, then of unease. This was completely unexpected and required further testing on 0096 as well as the D-Class personnel present at the time, which resulted in more casualties as testing went on. When 8207 was sent into the enclosure of 0096 alone, it was discovered that 8207 was the culprit, as the same situation occurred, 0096 simply regarding 8207 as a source of unease, even when they looked it directly in the eyes. After copious testing and examination, it was discovered that 8207 has the innate passive ability to either reverse or effectively neutralize the anomalous effects of other entities that they interact with, either outcome occurring on a case to case basis. Notable examples are that of 0096, 0999 and 0049, all of which are effectively neutralized, and 0173, whose effect is reversed in an interesting way. As long as 8207 is within the theoretical eyesight of 0173, 0173 cannot move, even if 8207 were to blink. The effect seems to affect 0173 the same way the effect of 0173 would affect normal personnel. More cases are being recorded and discovered and will likely be added in later addendums.\n\n\nAddendum:\n 0914 and 1471 have been found to be neutralized cases, the former not accepting 8207 as suitable matter. The effect of 8207 concerning 1471 is interesting as all instances of 1471 are rendered completely inactive within 40 meters of 8207, effectively disabling the program entirely.\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n Unsure, further determination needed, likely Dark\n\n\nRisk Class:\n Unsure, further determination needed, likely Notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8206\n | SCP-8207 | \nSCP-8208\n \u00bb",
