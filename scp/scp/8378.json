I guess it\u2019s just my first time dealing with anart, but AO-408005 really stuck out to me. It doesn\u2019t fit under the normal profile of items the Foundation *needs* to sell, but it still seems like it would be very beneficial to the Foundation\u2019s money-making activities. In essence, I don\u2019t think it should be stuck as merely an anomalous item. I know this message may seem out of the blue, but something about it just *speaks* to me (I have had it checked by Cognitohazards).\n\nAdrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Prop\n\n\nJunior Researcher, Distribution and Liquidation Subdivision, Procurement and Liquidation\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nCC:\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.Perrault@scp.int\n\n\nA.Prop@scp.int\n\n\nnone\n\n\nre-AO-408005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian,\n\n\nListen kid. In the course of this job you\u2019re going to find items that stick out to you, that just mesh with you in a way you can\u2019t describe. This attribute isn\u2019t necessarily anomalous (always check!) but the most important thing with regard to these items is that you don\u2019t get too attached. It\u2019s part of the reason we don\u2019t often let staff from our department keep the items we\u2019ve received. People would get too consumed with promoting and experimenting with their pet items, and we\u2019d stop getting things done. You can write out the 106NET document, but after that, forget about this thing, understood?\n\nAdeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdeline Perrault\n\n\nAssistant Director, Procurement and Liquidation\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are grouped in designation based on lead width. The widths range from those commonly found in consensus reality, to those with inherently anomalous widths. The first SCP-8378 was discovered in the cataloguing of items recovered in a Foundation raid of a GoI-0267 (\u201cAre We Cool Yet?\u201d) safehouse, and was initially catalogued under the designation of AO-408005.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Relevant\u00a0Documentation\u00a0-\u00a0B\n\n\n\n\n-hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nCC:\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.Prop@scp.int\n\n\nA.Perrault@scp.int\n\n\nnone\n\n\nAO-408005-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Perrault,\n\n\nThis is getting absurd. I know when I first talked to you about this, you said to stop thinking about this item, but the amount of things that have been falling under the classification is getting out of hand. We\u2019ve already had to cook up unique containment procedures for many of them, and after everything that\u2019s trickled down about the aftermath of the Site-19 incident\u2026\n\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this many times in the years since I first emailed you, but consider this my official offer to write up the SCP proposal for AO-408005.\n\nAdrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Prop\n\n\nResearcher, Distribution and Liquidation Subdivision, Procurement and Liquidation\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nCC:\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.Perrault@scp.int\n\n\nA.Prop@scp.int\n\n\nnone\n\n\nre-AO-408005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian,\n\n\nOffer accepted especially with regard to Site-19 and the founding of the Department of Surplus, and you can consider the proposal rubber-stamped as soon as it gets to my desk. You\u2019ll likely be moving out and up from Procurement and Liquidation when it goes through, and it\u2019ll be a shame to see you go, but for the good of the Foundation, it\u2019s a worthy sacrifice.\n\nAdeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdeline Perrault\n\n\nAssistant Director, Procurement and Liquidation\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore were discovered in subsequent years in other raids on \"Are We Cool Yet?\" safehouses. Given the growing number of items falling under this designation, the designation entered review shortly before \nIncident-MAMMON\n4\n, and the Foundation\u2019s subsequent severe financial difficulties. During the founding of the Department of Surplus, SCP-8378 was designated for possible use, and gained its current designation and containment procedures.\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Relevant\u00a0Documentation\u00a0-\u00a0C\n\n\n\n\n-hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nCC:\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.Prop@scp.int\n\n\nV.Danai@scp.int\n\n\nnone\n\n\nre:Pencil Proposal post Site 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinicios,\n\n\nI dunno, I just feel conflicted\u2026\n\n\nI\u2019ve been pushing the goddamn pencil for years, refining my argument over and over as times gone on and incidents have piled up and the sheer number of pencils has just \ngrown\n.\n\n\nLook, nobody loves the Foundation but we\u2019ve all got loyalty, and most of us have some amount of empathy, and for the final push getting her to agree to be Site-19 being fucking gone and 7 thousand people dead\u2026\n\n\nI don't know what to think anymore\u2026\n\nAdrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Prop\n\n\nResearcher, Distribution and Liquidation Subdivision, Procurement and Liquidation\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8378-1:\n\nOn 13/02/25, an unsealed SCP-8378-5 package was found during a Foundation raid on a GoI-0267 (\u201cAre We Cool Yet?\u201d) safehouse, with the following warranty text in a small slip of paper inside the package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Warranty Document\n- hide block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur highest goal at Darke\u2019s Extra-ordinary Implements is that you never need to re-buy one of our products, or something of use with it.
