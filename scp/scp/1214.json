No testing is to be performed on SCP-1214 without the authorization of the Senior CSD Administrator, Dr G. Wilson.\n\n\nAs per Standard Anomalous Computer Equipment Regulation 4324-B, 1214-L1 must under no circumstances be connected to a network of any kind.\n\n\nDescription:\n 1214-L1 is a standard Dell XPS Ultrabook laptop computer including power supply and mouse. Software installed includes the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system and Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.\n\n\nSeveral coding projects can be found in the \"Documents\" folder of user \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Most of these are programming exercises in the C# programming language. SCP-1214 is a project, also written in C#, with the name \"random_number_test\".\n\n\nThe program consists of approximately 60 lines of code. The program generates random numbers in the range 48-90, which are then interpreted as ASCII character codes. This gives the possibility of generating the characters in Table 1, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1, possible characters generated by SCP-1214 algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0-9, A-Z (alphanumeric, upper case)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon (:)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemicolon (;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nless-than(<)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequals (=)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngreater-than (>)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquestion mark (?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat sign (@)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe characters are assembled into lines of 50 characters each. One (1) such line is printed to a text window every second while the program is running.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Sample\u00a0of\u00a0program\u00a0output,\u00a0time\u00a0elapsed\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0minute\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Sample\u00a0of\u00a0program\u00a0output,\u00a0time\u00a0elapsed\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0minute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQGZ33I=9F@?AQQGPK6SGN?NLW;=JMP>GWBM=S5FIMPRXFE=9RO\n\nDSL?RAT>7R<MGP1RD?49XEK:TYGQ5BY4SY<EVGJ;DEYN<Z92VN\n\n0Y5IRZ8BFTU38OT7UICGWXOSOBFXXTODUABZZ:6==C1QAA=9T4\n\n5JJ?R2:<T?C:DL4@8Q=U8KB69DVXA>5<3SO5UFJ?PM@QU2Z@M0\n\n8FWZWE7C6=7<VE:67KXZEM6Y4F:L<6DF;@5J@3W:XA@<7CQUGN\n\nV>CMEF?XU@:F7ZTL0E@KP3NN24=UQLO?5H;63IUI:B9GZA9@CF\n\nC;EVXRJPKA9E79LUAJONHBKQ@=U7NKUWA:9CU9JCF>XC?P;ZV5\n\n0JKPX0KNFKWC10G<4W0807Z;7:E7AK2V<IK:;K<8R6NZG3<XV3\n\nL>ZM4SJ@HMFD=UH16C?=0CJR@TD0O4YH;>ZNVJDRJV2IM>TSAE\n\nWSHI28N7=;>JKCOY8YVU5GZGM5@1410LJ:85ZM<QZN<8D0;JUO\n\n6VWF?@T0WWSM3;;MZA;IYFL5UB:Q3LUQ6?V5O3UR<YP?Y<K1XQ\n\n1T>;QJ9QLX52X:21GN@6YWFC=ZP=7HQ9S=K0BVI<VXBXM91E=W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-1214 can be hard to detect at first.

Probability for characters A, F, L, O and Y has dropped to 0, or near 0. They do not appear in the output again during 1214-TR14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3 continues as described with no further variances. The longest test to date has been 1214-TR27, where SCP-1214 was run for \u2588\u2588 days, and showed a \u2588\u2588 percent reduction in the character set during Phase 3.\n\n\nStopping and restarting the SCP-1214 program results in a repetition of phases 1 through 3, with slight variations in program output as well as the lengths of the respective phases.\n\n\nThe current theory is that the diminishing probabilities observed during Phase 3 will continue until only one (1) character remains in the output. Calculations show that such a result would require the program to run for somewhere between \u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588 days.\n\n\nAdditional: After the occurrence described in Addendum 1214-3, SCSDA G. Wilson ordered testing of SCP-1214 to be suspended until further notice.\n\n\nAddendum 1214-1:\n\nStandard Electronic Contamination Tests (SECT) have proved negative. SCP-1214 does not appear to be able to infect other computers, and copies of the SCP-1214 program will not exhibit anomalous properties.\n\n\nAddendum 1214-2, acquisition log:\n\n1214-L1 was retrieved by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from the campus dorm of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 University, after a persistent rumor had circulated among the students that there existed an experimental program that \"behaved funny\" if executed over a period of several days. The rumors were exaggerated and ranged from speculations about \"rogue government AIs\" to \"impossible patterns seen in 'The Game of Life'\".\n\n\nFortunately, the owner of 1214-L1 appears to have shunned the attention this was generating, and exposure was therefore kept to a minimum. After acquiring the item, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 deployed a Class-IV Worm in the university network to monitor data traffic for further indications of SCP-1214, or similar activity.

However, at \u2588\u2588\u2588 minutes into Phase 2, the following words, quite different from the Phase 2 data acquired up to this point, appeared in SCP-1214's output:\n\n\n\n\n0?C9HWIHURTSHURTS9?PLEASE STOP=:::::::::::::::::::\n\n::::::::::SIGNAL::TRACE::COMPLETE::WE::RESPOND::IN\n\n::KIND:::::::::::::::::::::::::::DWW30PLEASEPLEASE\n\n\n\n\nApproximately five (5) seconds after this point in time, Dr H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appeared to be caught by a seizure lasting for 13 seconds. She then fell unconscious and dropped to the floor.\n\n\nAfter a period of 17 seconds, Dr P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 followed the Emergency Protocol and hit the cutoff switch, terminating all power to Test Lab 1214-2.

She revived after 34 hours, at which point further examination revealed that she had undergone a uniform 23% loss of visual, auditory, tactile and gustatory acuity. Olfactory acuity was unaffected. (See Reports 1214-345 through 1214-347 for speculation on this discrepancy.)\n\n\nDr H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 remains under medical supervision until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1213\n | SCP-1214 | \nSCP-1215\n \u00bb",
