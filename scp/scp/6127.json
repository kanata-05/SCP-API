Until this occurs, all interactions with the entity must be overseen by a staff member of level 4 clearance or above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph of SCP-6127, prior to containment, taken by a civilian cameraman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Special Containment Procedures:\n Efforts to track and recontain SCP-6127 are ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6127 resembles an adult female Common Raven (\nCorvus corax\n) of an average size and weight, and an undetermined age. Despite its initially unremarkable appearance, SCP-6127 possesses strength and intelligence well beyond that of the average \nCorvus corax,\n and has demonstrated levels of strength and intelligence superior to that of an average human. SCP-6127 claims to have an inherent knowledge of all languages, and does not speak via direct mimicry, but rather the vocal formation of original thoughts and sentences.\n\n\nSCP-6127 was discovered after Boston Animal Control received multiple phone-calls regarding a \"Demonic Bird\", which was vocalizing in Latin and attempting to deface Christian iconography. Mobile Task Force Lambda-4 (\"Birdwatchers\") were tasked with capturing the entity after Animal Control failed to do so. Lambda-4 managed to contain the entity, but not before it did approximately 9,000 dollars of property damage across seven separate properties.\n\n\nAddendum 6127.1:\n Interview Logs\n\n\nDuring its temporary containment at Site-55, Dr. Madison Tyler conducted several interviews with SCP-6127, to better ascertain the nature of the entity.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview log SCP-6127.01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6127\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Madison Tyler\n\n\nForward:\n \nThe following interview was conducted shortly after SCP-6127 arrived at Site-55. Dr. Tyler and SCP-6127 were separated by a layer of bullet-proof glass.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Hello, SCP-6127. Are you able to\u2026 Understand me? You can nod your head or-\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Yes. I understand you.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Oh! So you can speak English as well. Other than English and Latin, do you understand any other languages? Also, where did you learn to speak a dead language?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I can speak every language. And I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Uh, could you be more specific when you say \u201cevery language?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I can speak every language.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Uh\u2026 huh.\n\n\nDr. Tyler jots down notes on their notebook.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n So\u2026 who are you, where do you come from?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Do you have a name?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I don\u2019t know. Who are you?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n You can call me Dr. Tyler. Do you\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n No. You and the people who took me here. Who are you?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Oh, right. We\u2019re part of an\u2026 Organization which protects entities such as yourself. Things that are out of place. We just want to make sure that you\u2019re safe. Sorry for the rough welcome, we would have been a lot more diplomatic about it if we knew you were sapient..\n\n\nSeveral seconds pass.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Right. I\u2019m Dr. Tyler. Do you mind if I call you SCP-6127? At least until you can remember your name?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n That\u2019s ok.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n If you\u2019d like me to call you something else, just let me know, ok?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Thank you, Dr. Tyler.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n So\u2026 Is there anything you can remember?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I remember\u2026 Falling. Falling away from a tall light. And I remember how I was feeling. Anger, frustration, betrayal. That was a day ago, I think.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n You seem to have targeted your anger at Christian iconography. Do you remember why?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n It felt cathartic. I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly why, though. It\u2019s like\u2026 It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue. Just out of sight.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Well then, I would suggest trying to get some rest. It might help you focus.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Ok. Rest sounds good.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.02\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview log SCP-6127.02\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6127\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Madison Tyler\n\n\nForward:\n \nThe following interview took place the day after the initial interview.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Hello SCP-6127! Have you remembered anything you\u2019d prefer to be called- A name, or a nickname, or something?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I haven\u2019t. Sorry.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Oh there\u2019s nothing to apologize for. Before we start talking, do you mind if I run a test?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n What\u2026 kind of test?\n\n\nDr. Tyler holds up a stack of index cards.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Just something to test your claim that you can understand every language. I have a few phrases written on notecards in a few different languages. I just want you to read them out to me, and tell me what language they are. In English, so I can understand. Is that ok?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n I\u2019m alright with that.\n\n\nDr. Tyler holds up the first card.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n \u201cI saw a fish at midday.\u201d It\u2019s Swahilli. I\u2019m not sure which dialect, though.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Very good.\n\n\nDr. Tyler holds up the next card.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n German. \u201cThe bus flew away from the scene of the crime.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Tyler nods, and holds up the final card.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n That\u2019s\u2026 Mescalero-Chirichuan, I think. Uh, something like \u201cYour clouds were not allowed in my home.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Very impressive. Thanks for humoring me. Do you\u2026 Know how you know all of this?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n No. No idea who I am, where I came from- Why didn\u2019t you tell me I was a raven yesterday?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n You\u2019re not typically a raven?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Well\u2026 No, I don\u2019t think so. It's familiar, though. I\u2019ve been a raven before. It\u2019s just not my natural form. I think.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Maybe you were some kind of shape-shifter?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n No, no. That\u2019s not quite right. I could take different forms, but it wasn\u2019t \u201cshape-shifting.\u201d It was something else. I got stuck like this because I\u2026 Lost something.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Any idea what that might be? Or how you lost it?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n It was\u2026 taken from me. That\u2019s why I fell, I think. I don\u2019t know what it is but I can\u2026 feel it. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s nearby. Before I was brought here it felt like a tug in the back of my mind, but now that I\u2019m here it\u2019s much stronger. Much more tangible.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n So it\u2019s a physical thing? Something that fell with you, maybe?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n It\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Well, as far as I know, we haven\u2019t found any celestial objects since we picked you up. Even if we did, I doubt I\u2019d be able to tell you. But we can certainly look! Is there anything else that you could tell me? To help us find whatever it is?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n No, I'm sorry. But my memory\u2019s beginning to return. I might be able to recall what I lost if you give me some time.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Of course. Is it ok if I leave, then?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Yes. Thanks for coming to see me.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.03\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-6127.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview log SCP-6127.03\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6127\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Madison Tyler\n\n\nForward:\n \nIt was decided that SCP-6127 should be permanently contained at Site-225, due to its zoological nature, and the fact that Site-55 was not built to properly contain sapient non-humanoids for long periods of time. Dr. Tyler was sent in to alert SCP-6127 of the decision shortly after transportation to Site-225 was confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Hello SCP-6127. How are you doing today?\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Good! Good to see you again Dr. Tyler!\n\n\nSCP-6127 tilts its head. Dr. Tyler appears uncomfortable.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Is something wrong?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Oh. no. Why do you ask?\n\n\nSCP-6127 ruffles its feathers.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n You\u2019re lying to me. What\u2019s upsetting you?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Well I\u2019m not upset, per se, it\u2019s just\u2026 Well, that this is probably going to be the last time I see you.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n What\u2026 Do you mean?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n You\u2019re being moved to permanent containment at Site-225 tomorrow. They\u2019re better at taking care of wildlife. We just don\u2019t really have the tools to keep you healthy here.\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Well\u2026 You can still visit me there. Right?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Site-225 is in Nevada. It\u2019s thousands of miles away. Sorry, but-\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n Thousands of miles away?? But my memories- There\u2019s something here I need to find!\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Well I-\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n And I\u2019m not an animal! This form is\u2026 It\u2019s temporary, It\u2019s wrong, I told you!\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Yes, and-\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n You told me you were here to protect me. You- How is moving me far away from the only thing which might be able to fix me \nhelping\n me? How does It keep me safe?\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Please-\n\n\nSCP-6127:\n You lied to me, Dr. Tyler. I can see it in your face. You took advantage of my broken mind and you \nlied\n to me.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Listen- I don\u2019t have any control over this. I\u2019m not happy about it either. But if your memory keeps returning, maybe I can find your anchor. We can still help you recover your memories and return to your original form.\n\n\nSCP-6127 flies off the table, and faces away from Dr. Tyler.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n SCP-6127?\n\n\nSeveral seconds pass. Dr. Tyler sighs.\n\n\nDr. Tyler:\n Fine. Have it your way.\n\n\nDr. Tyler slams the door behind them, as they exit the interview room.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6127.2:\n Containment Breach\n\n\nFive hours after SCP-6127's final interview, SCP-6127 managed to escape Foundation custody. Dr. Tyler's credentials were used to trigger an Alpha-Level Immediate Evacuation Procedure to breach containment. While this typically would not have allowed an entity to fully escape containment, SCP-6127 was able to escape through Site-55\u2019s air vents, which had not been designed with intelligent non-humanoid entities in mind.\n\n\nWhile Dr. Tyler is being investigated for malfeasance, it is currently theorized that, rather than SCP-6127 having an inherent understanding of all languages, the entity utilized a low-level psychic field in order to gather information.\n\n\nAn email with the following contents was sent to Site-55 staff through Dr. Tyler's SCiPNET account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\u00a0Goodbye\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\u00a0Goodbye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t give everything up just to end up without self-determination again.\n\n\nGoodbye.\n\n\n- Mariangela\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6126\n | \nSynthPanda_\n | \nSCP-6128\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6127\n\" by SynthPanda_, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
