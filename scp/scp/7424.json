Access to SCP-7424 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Cannabis products are strictly prohibited on the containment floor.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7424 is a blue gardening spade measuring 20 centimeters in length with a wooden handle and a metal blade. The words \"WEED-B-GONE\" are written with a black permanent marker on the left side of the handle.\n\n\nSCP-7424's anomalous properties activate when brought within a 10-meter proximity to any tissue, materials, or combustion byproducts derived from plants of the genus \nCannabis\n (commonly known as marijuana). These properties also encompass any items associated with the recreational use of marijuana as a psychoactive drug.\n\n\nUpon activation, SCP-7424's blade exerts a gravitational force on these materials, attracting them and subsequently absorbing them into itself. No trace of the absorbed objects have ever been found. Afterwards, SCP-7424 proceeds to launch itself at a velocity of approximately 30 meters per second towards any individual(s) who last made use of the aforementioned items, often resulting in serious injury. In case no such individual is present within its 10-meter activation radius, the anomaly will target the next individual to enter its effective range.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\nSCP-7424 came to the Foundation's attention following a series of disruptive events at a marijuana dispensary in Denver, Colorado, USA. Local authorities reported that an individual identified as Reece Stoneman had entered the establishment wielding SCP-7424. Individuals involved in the incident were hospitalized and amnesticized. After further investigation, the following online chat logs have been recovered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+See:\u00a0SCP-7424\u00a0-\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Materials\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmptySausage\n\n\n12:01\n\n\n\n\nGuys.
