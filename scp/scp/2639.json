Access to SCP-2639-C is limited to Level-4 personnel; testing is currently prohibited.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2639 refers to a phenomenon that manifests as a 1 kilometer cubic volume wherein anomalous entities and objects (designated SCP-2639-A and SCP-2639-B, respectively) materialize, then dematerialize approximately 1-2 hours later. An imperceptible barrier around SCP-2639 prevents instances of SCP-2639-A from leaving this area of effect.\n\n\nSCP-2639-A are 3 humanoid entities equipped with anomalous weaponry and armor. Each entity exhibits superhuman speed, strength, endurance, resistance to injury, and perceives no pain or discomfort. When an instance is destroyed, an undamaged copy of this instance will appear somewhere within SCP-2639's area of effect.\n\n\nSCP-2639-B consists of 22 distinct 'types' of intangible objects dispersed throughout SCP-2639's area of effect. Each instance hovers 0.1 meters above ground and rotates on a horizontal axis at a set rate. When instances of SCP-2639-A make contact with an instance of SCP-2639-B, the object will typically vanish, conferring a beneficial effect on the entity. Observed effects have included (but are not limited to) new anomalous weaponry, increased resistance to injury, and higher overall damage output.\n\n\nOne particular type of SCP-2639-B ('Ammo Pack') is noted to only appear when either an instance of SCP-2639-A or a non-anomalous human expires.\n\n\nSCP-2639-C is a customized desktop computer. The computer runs without a discernible power-source, and has been hosting a heavily modified online Quake\n2\n death-match since 1997. The session's participants are connected to the host machine via anomalous means, and have been identified as three teenagers\n3\n missing since 18/06/1997. Until the discovery of SCP-2639-C in 2010, they were unaware that they had been playing for over a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2639 INCIDENT DATABASE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemains of \nMadonna di Siena\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT #:\n 231\n\n\nDATE:\n 18/08/2009\n\n\nLOCATION:\n Siena, Tuscany (Italy)\n\n\nREPORT:\n SCP-2639 occurred on the outskirts of Siena, Tuscany at 04:23 UTC; the anomaly was centered around a small church (\nMadonna di Siena\n). Local police officers responded to the anomaly, leading to an escalation which ultimately culminated with the collapse of the church. All anomalies associated with SCP-2639 dematerialized at 05:41 UTC.\n\n\nCASUALTIES:\n 96 (54 fatalities, 12 critical injuries, 30 minor injuries)\n\n\nCOVER STORY:\n A tanker truck carrying 9000 gallons of petrol was overturned and ignited, resulting in a massive explosion. The ensuing fire exacerbated structural weaknesses in the church, causing it to collapse on the congregation inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nINCIDENT #230\n | \nINCIDENT #231\n | \nINCIDENT #232\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2639.1:\n Chat Logs\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/2639/files/chatlog001.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] haha\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] totally blasted your face with my science gun :>\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Oh you blasted my face alright\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Not with science tho\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] >:D\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] <3\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] <3\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] picking next map\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] deathmatch again?\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] yes\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Pardon me.\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] uh\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] hello?\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] gtfo\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Be nice\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] hey sorry but this is a private server\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I understand, and I apologize for the intrusion.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] But I need to speak with the three of you.\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] boot him\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] load next map\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] wait how did you even access this server?\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I'm accessing it from a computer we found.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I believe it belongs to one of you?

So, like \u2014 I'm not saying I understand. But I sympathize. I imagine what I'd think if something like this happened to him, and\u2026 I don't know. The fact that it CAN happen, terrifies me.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I don't think any of you are evil. I think\u2026 what happened to you is unfair. Beyond unfair.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] But I also don't think just hiding in the dark is going to help.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] You need to talk to us.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Not just for our sake. But for yours.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Okay, I'm done. Sorry for rambling.

But.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] The number we're getting is a lot lower than it would have been, if it weren't for all of you.\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] ok\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] good I mean\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] look I want a straight answer here\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] I think I already know the truth so\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] if you lie to me i'll know it, and we'll go back to being quiet again\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] so answer the next question truthfully.

Aside from myself and two others, everyone in the area you manifested in was already dead.\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] ok\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] that's what we figured, too, I just\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] wanted to be sure\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] You said you all talked a lot. About what?\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] think we've come to a decision\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] A decision?\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] yeah\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] you've been running tests on us for like IDK how long now\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] and we're still stuck in here\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] you won't let us talk to our families\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] and all you do is have us do stupid pet tricks for you\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I understand. I'm sorry. I wish I could let you speak with your families, particularly given the fact that you just saved my life and the lives of everyone in this facility. But your situation is complicated.\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] yeah\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] we know\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] but like the point here is\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] fuck you\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] fuck you and fuck your tests\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] thats the point\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] put more civilly, I don't think we're ever getting out of here\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] are we?\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] ?\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Sorry, was thinking.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] We were exploring solutions before you stopped coming out for tests. We don't honestly know what to do. We've examined the computer you're communicating to us through, but we haven't figured out a way to retrieve you from it.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Nothing indicates to us that your 'minds' are even inside it. It's more like you're connecting to it from some outside source. We've discussed forcing the game to shut down, but we're fairly certain that would just mean we'd lose contact with you \u2014 and you'd lose contact with each other.\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Yeah, we figured\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Which means we're stuck in here\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Just letting you run your tests while we wait for the computer to finally break down\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] And when that happens, we'll be alone\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] We won't even have each other\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] Just an eternity of darkness\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] wow ok there emo kid\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] *flip hair in front of eyes* :>\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] You know you love it\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] haha\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] <3\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] <3\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] So\u2026 how can we help?

We can't fix it, or reverse it, or even, like\u2026 well I guess we could just, tell you to shut the computer off\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] and sit in the dark, alone, as atonement\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] but that's going to happen some day ANYWAY\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] so, meanwhile\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] So, meanwhile, maybe we can actually save lives.\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] \u2026how?\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] omg are you fucking serious\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] how do you THINK you fucking moron\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] we are unstoppable nigh-immortal digitized death-gods who have spent 10+ years practice-killing each other in endlessly looped murder-orgies\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] so now we're ready for co-op\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] we just have one condition\n\n[\nBOOGER\n] No people.\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] we will not kill people. ever. period. end of discussion\n\n[\nWTF_STFU\n] only monsters\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] I'm going to have to talk to my superiors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0RESTRICTED\u00a0SCP:/2639/files/chatlog554.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0[LEVEL-4/2639\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0VERIFIED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] Hello?\n\n[\nGRRGRL\n] yo\n\n[\nJBREINER\n] They said yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0RESTRICTED\u00a0SCP:/2639/files/notice.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0[LEVEL-4/2639\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0VERIFIED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF Omega-9 (\"The Scrubs\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Force Mission:\n Mobile Task Force Omega-9 consists of 3 anomalous entities available for near-instantaneous deployment into extreme circumstances requiring the delivery of overwhelming force.
