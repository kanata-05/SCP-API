Access is to be granted to Level 2 personnel or higher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6215 refers to an anachronistic cotton shirt, recovered in a tomb outside of Tepi, Ethiopia during an unrelated archeological dig. While carbon dating has placed the age of SCP-6215 at 282,000 years old, the style and manufacturing of SCP-6215 is in line with modern day industry practices.\n\n\nOn the front of SCP-6215 is an image alongside text. The image depicts a stylized cartoon snake coiled around the base of a date palm tree, whose leaves are noticeably wilted. The text is written in a previously unknown proto-Sabaean language. Translation efforts are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum.1:\n Since initial containment on 01/11/1974, several objects of similar age and anachronistic properties have been identified by the Foundation, including near-identical copies of SCP-6215. A selection has been presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nLocation of Recovery\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6215-1\n\n\nTemplo Mayor, Mexico\n\n\nSeveral plastic rings molded together to form a ball. Small aluminum half-spheres are embedded in each ring. When left unattended, SCP-6215-1 will float one meter above the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6215-21\n\n\nDead Sea, Jordan\n\n\nA stuffed plush snake with plastic eyeballs. When squeezed, SCP-6215-21's eyes will bulge out of its body, emitting a hissing vocalization through unknown means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6215-78\n\n\nYangtze River, China\n\n\nA single-use plastic cup in the shape of a half-bitten apple. Analysis of the item's interior have detected trace amounts of a liquid identical to that of Coca-Cola.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation estimates the number of these items to be approximately 1,400. Containment efforts are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6214\n | SCP-6215 | \nSCP-6216\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6215\n\" by Trotskyeet, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
