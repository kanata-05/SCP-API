SCP-753 is to be provided with five (5) litres of each primary color of paint each day, along with twenty-four (24) standard painting canvases. All paintings created by SCP-753 are to be recorded by research staff.\n\n\nIn the event that SCP-753 attempts to destroy itself, security personnel are to restrain SCP-753 and await further orders from Research Staff present.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-753 is a highly advanced automaton approximately ten (10) centimeters across, six (6) centimeters wide and eight (8) centimeters tall. SCP-753 possesses two (2) pincer-like limbs protruding from its main circular body, which it uses to slowly move itself across the ground. This is likely due to SCP-753's locomotive functions having been damaged at an unknown point in its history.\n\n\nAt the center of SCP-753's body is a red sensory organ similar in structure to that of the human eye. SCP-753's eye appears to be organic, but it is likely artificially produced. This eye is also damaged, leaving SCP-753 partially blind. A 'Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd.' logo has been engraved on SCP-753's back.\n\n\nInterior analysis of SCP-753 shows that it moves using a rudimentary nervous system, coordinated by an extremely small spherical 'brain'. Above SCP-753's body is a small 'receiver', the purpose of which is currently unknown. SCP-753 appears ignorant of its surroundings, and does not recognize the presence of personnel.\n\n\nSCP-753's primary purpose appears to be the creation of paintings. Paintings produced by SCP-753 are highly realistic and often do not correspond to real locations. Recently, paintings created by SCP-753 have mostly involved, in some way, SCP-753's death. SCP-753 was initially returned to Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd by one of their clients, who complained that it was 'broken'. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a Foundation mole within the organisation, was able to retrieve SCP-753 before incineration.\n\n\nSCP-753 usually produces one (1) painting per hour. When SCP-753 is not provided with adequate paint or painting canvas, it appears to enter a dormant state, shutting down for a minimum time length of one (1) week. As this heavily impedes research, SCP-753 is to be kept stocked with paint and canvases at all times. SCP-753 does not appear to be concerned about completed paintings, and generally ignores them after they are finished.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0...\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPainting Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n\nPainting produced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01:00 AM\n\n\nImage of an ocean.

Closer inspection reveals that SCP-753 is being crushed in its jaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02:24 AM\n\n\nImage of a lit furnace. Unidentified red humanoid is climbing out of the furnace. SCP-753 is visible inside the furnace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03:14 AM\n\n\nImage of a human eye against a starry background. SCP-753 is drifting towards the eye, which is observing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04:21 AM\n\n\nImage of a city. City appears to be constructed from web and populated by giant spiders. SCP-753 is visible trapped in a web, with a spider moving towards it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05:11 AM\n\n\nImage of a nuclear explosion. Silhouette resembling SCP-753 is visible in the explosion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06:02 AM\n\n\nImage of SCP-753's containment area. SCP-753 appears to have shut down. Research Assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is inspecting SCP-753. Closer analysis shows that Research Assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 lacks eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06:59 AM\n\n\nImage of Sector-28 disposal facility.

Notably, SCP-753 appears to be absent from the painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11:02 AM\n\n\nImage of a forest. Indistinct human figures are no longer hanging, but are on the ground, looking directly forward. One is holding a crushed SCP-753 in its fist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12:29 PM\n\n\nImage of an indistinct human face, holding SCP-753 forward.
