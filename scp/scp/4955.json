Materials aren't anomalous, it's just a wood handle and a stainless steel blade. Sharpness isn't anomalous. No thermodynamic anomaly, absolutely nothing. I even used the Hume-Dawkins-Scranton gauge; nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\n\nThe only anomalous bit I can even think of is that I've been told jack shit about this and nobody remembers anything being in P-0055. Hell, I don't think I've met anyone who knows about this thing. So maybe its effect is being just\u2026 really, really forgettable, huh?\n\n\nAnyway. I guess I'm gonna go report my findings now. What a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a02\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/2\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a02\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/2\n\n\n\n\nSo. I went to my supervisor. I confirmed with her that, yes, I've been assigned to 4955, and yes, 4955 is in P-0055. I told her it was just a normal knife with no anomalous properties, and she just\u2026\n\n\nStared at me. For a while. I asked her if she was alright, and she said she was waiting for me to give the report on it.\n\n\nThe report I had just given.\n\n\nThis went on two more times before I excused myself, saying I needed to revise it because I'd realized something new. She waved me off, asked me to shut the door behind me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nNo D-Classes is a pain, but I managed to convince Researcher Smalls to step in for five bucks. We stepped in, I picked up the knife, raised my hand, and asked point blank if he could see it.\n\n\n\"See what?\"\n\n\nI stepped closer, and Smalls put on a small smirk. I raised the knife in my hand again, this time asking if he could see that my hand was raised.\n\n\n\"Are you paying me five dollars to waste my time?\"\n\n\nAnother step closer. I wound back and slapped him as hard as I could with the broadside. He staggered for a sec before standing straight up and looking at me just the same as he did before.\n\n\nI asked if he felt that.\n\n\n\"Harry, all I feel is \nbored\n.\"\n\n\nI paused for a moment, thinking a bit, and raised it to his cheek, slowly drawing it back to give a shallow cut, and put the knife into my pocket.\n\n\nThis managed to get a wince out of him, but even then, with blood leaking down to his jaw, he just looked at me with a hesitant smirk.\n\n\nI let him go after making plans to get dinner later. If there's still blood at the end of the day, I'll know for sure just how far it goes. For now, however, I'm going to check that my hunch is correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4955\n KNIFE's anomalous properties manifest by rendering all subjects other than Junior Researcher Harris unable to verbally (and, often, entirely) acknowledge the existence of \nSCP-4955\n KNIFE. \nEdit 2055/1/7:\n This effect does not apply to any object designated SCP-4955, as the slot has been replaced by another object. Following this, all instances of SCP-4955 in this document have been replaced with \"KNIFE\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a04\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a04\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nWhen I met Smalls for dinner, he still had a thoroughly bloody cheek, even if it was dry. Folks kept asking about it and Smalls kept saying it was nothing, and everyone seemed to buy it. But\u2026 only after looking at me. So they seem to know things I do with the knife, at least.\n\n\nI'm probably going to hell for this, but while Smalls wasn't looking I slipped a Class-W mnestic into his drink to check if that had any effect. Ten minutes after he'd finished it I presented the knife and the same basic questions, and he was still clueless as ever.\n\n\nOn Class-W mnestics.\n\n\nI'm not going to pursue this further, if only for the fact that I can't ask if we've got stronger antimemes, but I'm going to run it through the antimeme machine just to double check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a05\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a05\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/3\n\n\n\n\nI'm at the end of my damn rope here.\n\n\nI decided to give my own cheek a cut to see how folks reacted to it. On the way back, a few people asked, and every time I said I cut my cheek with 4955, and every time they walked away without another word. A few of them covered their mouth with their hands as they walked away for reasons I can't quite place.\n\n\nIf that wasn't enough, I ran it through the antimeme machine and it gave nothing.\n\n\nZilch.\n\n\nIt's not an antimeme that mnestics can touch or that the QNTM machines can detect.\n\n\nBut\u2026 Why?\n\n\nThere's no chance that everyone \ncan\n see it, right? There's no way this isn't an antimeme. Smalls wouldn't take the shit I pulled without decking me, and there's no reason for him to not wash off.\n\n\nSo what the fuck?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanics of this antimeme are currently unknown; mnestic treatment does not prove effective at counteracting the effects, nor do QNTM analyzers show any antimemetic properties.\n\nThis antimemetic effect perpetuates to actions and results thereof by \nSCP-4955\n KNIFE upon any subject other than Junior Researcher Harris learning of \nSCP-4955\n KNIFE's relation to the actions or results thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a06\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/7\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a06\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/7\n\n\n\n\nMy supervisor has continuously pressed me for the documentation of 4955.\n\n\nI asked her, \"What 4955?\" and she really didn't like that. She didn't like that one bit. She said to stop fucking around and do my job.\n\n\nSo, I took the paper she gave me the job on, I took the knife, and I cut it to ribbons in front of her.\n\n\nI asked again.\n\n\nShe stared at me for a moment.\n\n\nShe brought her hand up to her mouth.\n\n\nAnd\n\n\nshe started \nlaughing.\n\n\n\"What 4955 indeed? We don't have a 4955. Say, you aren't working on anything, are you? I could use someone on \n3309\n.\"\n\n\nI sliced into my finger and flicked the blood right at her face and she didn't even blink. She just left it there, still giggling. She wasn't even looking at me.\n\n\nWe don't have a 4955. We don't fucking have a 4955, sure, alright. Whatever.\n\n\nFuck this job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a07\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/10\n\n\n\n\nLog\u00a07\u00a0-\u00a02055/01/10\n\n\n\n\nThe joke should've been finished already but it isn't.
