Once bonded, this personnel is not permitted off-site. Their primary duties as Foundation staff will not be affected by this arrangement.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7960 is a koala (\nPhascolarctos cinereus\n) that demonstrates average human intelligence. While SCP-7960 is biologically indistinguishable from an ordinary koala, the entity is capable of vocalization and comprehension of the English language. SCP-7960 is remarkably durable, as all attempts to harm the entity do not result in any observable damage.\n\n\nSCP-7960 bonds itself to a single individual, clinging to their body. While SCP-7960 can be physically removed from the individual\u2019s body, the entity will reappear on the host's body, necessitating the outlined containment procedures.\n\n\nOnce bonded, SCP-7960 will bombard the host with deprecating remarks. It has stated that its grand objective is to \u201cimprove\u201d the host through negative reinforcement. The Foundation has observed that SCP-7960 is largely ineffective.\n\n\nSCP-7960 will remain bonded to a host until their death, upon which a successive host can be named. If no host is named, SCP-7960 will bond itself to the nearest individual.\n\n\nAddendum.7960.1:\n History\n\n\nSCP-7960 came into the Foundation\u2019s possession after the discovery of a mail-order advertisement in a June, 1957 issue of RIFLEKID: FUN WITH GUNS, an American comic book released by now-defunct publisher Odyssey. A transcript of the ad has been replicated below.\n\n\n\n\nTHAT\u2019S NOT A MONKEY ON YOUR BACK, KIDDO, THAT\u2019S\n\n\nSELF-IMPROVEMENT KOALA\n\n\nDID YOU KNOW YOU\u2019RE THE PROBLEM? PREPARE TO BE REMINDED.\n\n\nONCE HE\u2019S ACTIVATED, NO MORE LITTLE BOY. IT\u2019S TIME FOR A LITTLE MAN!\n\n\nTHERE\u2019S ONLY ONE SELF-IMPROVEMENT KOALA. HE IS FOREVER.\n\n\n$2000!\n\n\n\n\nThe mailing address listed alongside the advertisement was made out to the offices of GoI-323, \"Better-Youth\", a known distributor of occult goods. SCP-7960 was purchased by the Foundation, and immediately bonded with Area-179 Sanitation head Paul Duffy, who was closest to the entity when it was being removed from the wooden crate it was shipped in. Duffy served as the containment specialist for SCP-7960 up until his death in 2022. Ian Wu, an intern who served under Duffy, had willingly volunteered to become SCP-7960\u2019s next host. Wu was fully briefed on the specifics of SCP-7960's containment prior to acceptance.\n\n\nSelected logs of Wu\u2019s interactions with SCP-7960 have been included below.\n\n\nAddendum.7960.2:\n Logs\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n First interaction between Wu and SCP-7960.\n\n\n\n\nWu sits at his terminal, editing a document. SCP-7960 slowly crawls into the room, and begins to climb Wu\u2019s body.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Oh, hey, buddy. Hi!\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at your job.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n (\nLaughs\n) Yeah, I\u2019m trying.\n\n\nWu resumes typing.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at your job.\n\n\nWu is not deterred. He continues to type, and then pauses.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n The average American types at 90 words per minute. Your typing speed is 30 words per minute.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Hold on, I\u2019m thinking.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Wu is presenting a report before a panel of researchers.\n\n\n\n\nWu stands in front of a slideshow. SCP-7960 clings to his back.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n And so, the crux of Dr. Carlton\u2019s research here states that every anomalous event can be fit into a versatile model, named the\u2014\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at public speaking.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Um, named the Four-Point Way Module.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Eliminating filler words such as \u2018um\u2019 and \u2018uh\u2019 from your vocabulary will make you a better person. You are still an intern because you are naturally uncharasmatic.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n The first variable that needs to be obsessed is underlying chance.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Assessed.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Which\u2014 which states that\u2014 underlying chance refers to grander metaphysical implications surrounding an anomalous\u2014 an anomalous event.\n\n\nWu is silent for several seconds. He closes his eyes, and exhales before continuing.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n (\nWhispering\n) Please, stop\u2026\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at convincing me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Wu is using a microscope to aid in the research of an experimental, artificial microbe.\n\n\n\n\nWu leans over the microscope. SCP-7960 sits on the counter beside him. The entity turns the microscope off.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Don\u2019t use this.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Turn it back on, don\u2019t do this now.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at seeing.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Fuckhead, turn it on.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Prehistoric men with bad eyesight would not have been able to detect predators in the distance. You and your bloodline would have died.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Please? Seriously, turn it back on.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Men used to go to war. Now they wear glasses.\n\n\nWu angrily grabs SCP-7960, lifting it.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Weak men kill animals. Do better.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Fucking pointless. I can\u2019t do this shit.\n\n\nWu calls over a lab assistant to analyze the microbe, moving away from the counter. SCP-7960 materializes on his back. It points to the assistant.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n She is good at science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Wu is watching television inside his dorm.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n (\nSighs\n) At what?\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Everything.\n\n\nWu lunges from the couch, attempting to strangle SCP-7960. The entity hisses and claws, scratching him.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n You motherfucker, you scratch now?\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n If a woman saw you lose a fight against a koala, she would lose all interest in you, sexually. You would no longer be able to function as a man. If you had sex, I would make comments and refuse to leave the room. This is why you're afraid to approach women.\n\n\nWu moves into the kitchen, gasping as he washes out his wound.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n What the fuck is with you and the\u2014 the sexism?\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n I am good at understanding the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Wu is attempting to study for an exam intended to gauge his competency as Foundation staff, with potential to be given a promotion upon completion.\n\n\n\n\nWu flips a page, and types out a note.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are going to fail.\n\n\nWu increases the volume of his headphones.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are going to fail.\n\n\nWu reaches towards his ear. SCP-7960 rips off his headphones, breaking them.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me? Those were hundred dollar headphones, and I\u2019m trying to study so I can get ahead in my career! Wouldn\u2019t you want that? Do you want me to fucking fail? I\u2019m trying to improve myself, you\u2019re literally the problem!\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n There are people younger than you that make more money, have more sex, and are more successful. You already failed.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Did you do this to Duffy? Serious.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n Yes. But he was bad at self-improvement. That\u2019s why he died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Wu is waiting for the computer to process the results of his assessment test.\n\n\n\n\nWu stands outside of the exam room. SCP-7960 sits on his shoulder.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Thanks for being quiet in there. I really, really appreciate that. I'll get you some\u2026 sticks or whatever the fuck.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n I wouldn\u2019t want to disturb the other test-takers. That would be impolite since they studied hard.\n\n\nAn exam proctor opens the door.\n\n\nProctor:\n Please remove your exam cards now. If the color of the circle in the center of the paper is green, proceed to room 2A in three hours for your results. Congratulations, you passed. If there is no color in the circle, thank you for your continued efforts.\n\n\nWu removes his exam card. There is no color in the circle.\n\n\nSCP-7960 stares at Wu, smiling. Wu places his hand on his mouth, quivering.\n\n\nResearcher Wu:\n Just say it. Say it. It's true. Whatever you're going to say is true.\n\n\nSCP-7960 is silent. It continues to smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollowing this, Dr. Wu climbed to the top of Area-179\u2019s helipad and threw himself from the roof, a fall of 75 feet. He was given immediate medical attention, resulting in the treatment of over three dozen broken bones and severe head trauma. Wu sustained a stable, neurologically intact condition, but was placed on medical leave until further notice.\n\n\nThe following log occurred shortly after Wu's condition was stabilized.\n\n\n\n\nWu lays in the hospital bed, wearing a full body cast. He slowly regains consciousness.\n\n\nSCP-7960 sits at the foot of the bed.\n\n\nSCP-7960:\n You are bad at killing yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7959\n | SCP-7960 | \nSCP-7961\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7960\n\" by J Dune, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
