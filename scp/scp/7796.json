If any further additional copies of SCP-7796 are discovered, they are to be destroyed and those who are in possession of the instances are to be amnesticized.\n\n\nMetatron.AIC will scan online records of film archives, film discussion boards and social media platforms for any mention of SCP-7796. Such records are to be scrubbed and individuals responsible for the posts are to be amnesticized.\n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-7796 is an archived television show entitled \nEvenings with Don Cavatelli\n. The show was produced by GOI-5889 (\u201c\nVikander-Kneed Technical Media\n\u201d) starring \nSCP-5697\n,\n1\n was modelled after late night television talk shows, and ran for seventeen seasons from 1955 to 1972.\n2\n There is no record of SCP-7796 being broadcast on any of the major networks, despite the high quality of the set, the budget of the production, and notable guests throughout the seventeen-season run.\n\n\nWhen an individual watches an episode of SCP-7796, a soporific effect has been observed, lulling the individual into a state of sustained hypnagogia. Individuals in this state are highly suggestible, especially to the advertisement breaks which always promotes products by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media, resulting in the delusion that the GOI\u2019s media products are the most popular media in the world.\n3\n\n\nOther temporary anomalous effects include:\n\n\n\n\ntooth rot,\n\n\nmyopia,\n\n\nanosmia,\n\n\nageusia,\n\n\nand alopecia\n4\n\n\n\n\nRecordings of SCP-7796 were discovered on 20 August, 2023, in the University of California Los Angeles\u2019 Film & Television Archive by Dr. Lillihammer during a trip wherein she was researching the entertainment industry for better understanding of VKTM\u2019s operations. The archivists present did not acknowledge her questions about SCP-7796 and would not admit to having it. Additionally, all online records of the archive fail to mention the existence of SCP-7796. After containment and shipment to Site-43, Dr. Lillihammer confirmed that every single similar archive in the United States, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, contained a complete copy of the entire run of SCP-7796. None of the archivists had any knowledge of the existence of the recordings either. Dr. Lillihammer dispatched other members of MTF-Kappa-43 (\u201cThe Mediators\u201d) to retrieve and contain the additional copies of SCP-7796.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 1 \u2013 Episode 63, 03-10-1955\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli stands in front of velvet curtains with a freestanding microphone, performing his nightly monologue used to open the show. He is smoking a cigar.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Crowds have been streaming into cinemas to see the latest animated feature, Lady and the Tramp. But all I can say is there\u2019s one scene I could have used some warning about. I don\u2019t know about you folks, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had a romantic fantasy about being chomped to death by two mutts in an alleyway.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: This is racist against Pastamericans everywhere!\n\n\n[Audience laughter is heard off camera.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Heyo! I gotta million of em, folks. Now, stick around after this break for my interview with James Dean.\n5\n He\u2019s here to promote his new film, Rebel without a Cause, which critics are calling an accurate portrayal of teenage angst. Personally, I call that Friday night with the kids while the missus goes to book club, amirite?\n\n\n[Applause followed by a fade to black and commercial break.]\n\n\n[The commercial break consists of an ad for \nSCP-5897\n, but overlaid onto the audio Cavatelli\u2019s voice can be heard.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: \n[Coughing violently]\n Fuck you, Jerry, I can smoke if I want to.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: \n[Still coughing]\n Because it\u2019s my show. You\u2019re just the producer. I\u2019m the talent, so go produce me up a guest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 3 \u2013 Episode 90, 15-05-1957\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli sits opposite actor, Ronald Reagan.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: So, what do you have for the folks tonight?\n\n\nReagan\n: Hey thanks, Don. I\u2019m here tonight to promote my new film, Hellcats of the Navy.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: First thing I gotta say is that is one dumb title. Whatta you guys doing in that movie? Fighting demonic felines?\n\n\n[Cavatelli ashes his cigar into the ash tray, knocking a few embers onto the floor and Reagan\u2019s suit leg causing it to ignite slightly along the hem.]\n\n\nReagan\n: \n[Patting down his pant leg frantically.]\n It\u2019s about a mission against the Japanese war effort onboard a submarine and the struggle of the crew to maintain professionalism during the crisis.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Man, I must\u2019ve fallen asleep fifteen minutes in.\n\n\n[The audience laughs.]\n\n\nReagan\n: \n[Looking up from his now extinguished pant leg.]\n Sorry?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: I gotta tell you, Ronnie, you\u2019re a piss poor actor.\n\n\n[Audience applause.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 5 \u2013 Episode 31 , 20-03-1959\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli stands over the body of Rod Steiger, who is bleeding and curled into a fetal position]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: That\u2019s for portraying the Italian American like a fucking gangster!\n6\n Not every Italian has that sorta criminal demeanor, Rod! What do you think about those of us with a pasta heritage, huh? Vaffanculo!\n\n\n[Cavatelli kicks Steiger in the stomach before turning back to the camera, wiping blood from his knuckles with a handkerchief.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Stick around folks, I\u2019m gonna teach this chooch some manners while yous watches a very special message from our sponsors.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Hey Jerry, get me a rubber hose, I need it for something.\n\n\n[Applause followed by a fade to black and commercial break.]\n\n\n[The screen brightens steadily until it is roughly 300% brighter than any cathode ray television was capable of producing. The white light fades to a rich blue, then soothing music starts.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: Sick of your ordinary social media? Sick of the same old drudgery and nonsense from out of touch billionaires ruining your fun? Me too. That\u2019s why I switched to Viber. The social media platform from Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. When enough\u2019s enough, it\u2019s time to Vibe.\n\n\nUnknown male voice\n: \n[Speaking rapidly.]\n Side effects include: headaches, nausea, anal protrusions, a suffering of self-worth, dizziness, your mother\u2019s resurrection from the netherworld, dental plaque, and many more! Ask your doctor if Viber is right for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 9 \u2013 Episode 147 , 23-11-1963\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli is smoking a cigar and sitting next to his guest.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: And do you think that target is still achievable?\n\n\n[The corpse of John F. Kennedy\n7\n lays slumped over the other chair, face up and tilted over the back of the chair. Blood and brain matter drips from the man\u2019s head to the stage floor.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Landing on the moon by 1970? Come on. We can barely get people up into orbit. Doesn\u2019t that promise stink of amoral optimism in the face of the significant struggles the American people already face? Unemployment, wealth discrepancy, failure of the American Dream everywhere we look, and you want to land a couple rocket jockeys on the ball of rock that orbits the planet?\n\n\n[The corpse starts to slide down the chair.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Alright alright, no politics! Who wants to listen to that, I know! Sorry, Mr. President. I just thought as you\u2019re the leader of the free world, politics was a subject you\u2019d be comfortable talking about.\n\n\n[The corpse slips to the floor, its head striking the seat of the chair on the way down, causing more brain matter to slide out.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Jerry, get me a wet wipe or something, the President needs a moment to clean himself up.\n\n\n[Cavatelli ashes onto the stage floor into the ever expanding pool of blood and brain matter.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Sorry, what was that, Mr. President?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: \n[Laughing.]\n When you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, Mr. President. The show must go on, and this \nis\n an entertainment show. We wouldn\u2019t want to bore the audience with things that actually threaten their livelihoods, they have the newspaper for that! So, new subject, seen any good movies lately?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 10 \u2013 Episode 86 , 14-04-1964\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli sits opposite folk singer, Bob Dylan.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: More and more the public is responding to your music, do you have any insight into your sudden popularity?\n\n\nDylan\n: I don\u2019t have anything to say about my music, I just write it all down, and then I sing it. What else you want from me, man?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Well, some say that the youth are drawn to your music because of the frantic politics of our time.\n\n\n[Cavatelli puts one hand to the side of his head.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Come on Jerry, what\u2019s the point of having a talk show if you can\u2019t talk politics? Shut up.\n\n\n[Cavatelli lights a cigar.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Sorry about that, Mr. Dylan. Like I was saying, things are tense in America right now. Rising tensions in Southeast Asia, not to mention horrible conditions for blue-collar workers here at home.\n\n\nDylan\n: I\u2019ll tell you what, man, it's all about talking to people. Get to know the working man, and you\u2019ll be able to speak to him. Talking is where it\u2019s at, man. Everything in the news is talking \nat\n us, not \nwith\n us. You dig?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Oh, I dig.\n\n\nDylan\n: I just took a road trip across America. Got in those bars, talked to them miners, other folk. Shit ain\u2019t good out there, man. I\u2019m just telling it like it is.\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Think you could do a song for us tonight, Mr. Dylan?\n\n\nDylan\n: Hell yeah, man. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n\n[Dylan raises an acoustic guitar, begins to strum, and then launces into The Times are a-Changing, his newly released single. Afterwards, he puts the guitar down.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Damn, you\u2019re a terrible singer. Can\u2019t carry a note at all, can you?\n\n\nDylan\n: \n[Laughing]\n Not a bit. You like the song, Don?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: I\u2019ll tell you when my ears stop bleeding!\n\n\n[Audience laughter.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: But tell me, Mr. Dylan, what made you license out that song for the superhero movie?\n8\n\n\nDylan\n: Oh man, the money. Obviously, the money. What else is there, man? What\u2019d you expect?\n\n\nCavatelli\n: A better movie.\n\n\n[Audience laughter.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 11 \u2013 Episode 102 , 14-09-1966\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli sits across from Ronald Reagan, who was appearing on the show as part of his 1966 California gubernatorial election campaign.]\n\n\nReagan\n: I think I\u2019m a better choice for the California people, especially when compared to my opponent, Pat Brown. This administration has wasted our State\u2019s resources, creating one of the worst deficits in our history while still raising taxes. Worse, Brown is lax on crime, refusing to crack down during the riots in Watts a few years ago, and allowing radicals to congregate on our State\u2019s great university campuses like UC Berkeley. My opponent needs to be held accountable for his failures in the State capital. Sure, my opponents have called me a radical, accusing me of bigotry because I opposed the Civil Rights Act and supported the appeal of the Rumford Act, but I\u2019m here to tell you that there\u2019s not a lick of bigotry anywhere in my person. I just want a simple government to address our simple problems. I\u2019m a political outsider, and that\u2019s what we need in California, someone who can take his experience in the world beyond the capital and apply it to problems for those in the state that care about our success as a society.\n\n\n[Cavatelli smokes his cigar for a moment, then places it on the ashtray seated between them, and dusts off his hands theatrically.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: I can think of quite a few good counters to your points here tonight, Ronnie. Point out the racially insensitive language you\u2019re using, point to the similarities in your speeches to fascist propaganda\u2026\n\n\n[Reagan starts to speak but Cavatelli holds up his hand.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: But mostly, I just want to say you\u2019re a shitty actor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 16 \u2013 Episode 57 , 16-04-1971\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cavatelli stands in front of velvet curtains with a freestanding microphone.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: The 43\nrd\n Academy Awards were televised last night and Best Picture went to \nPatton\n over the comedic and politically conscious goldmine of \nM*A*S*H\n, going to show you that once again the most popular thing is often much less important than the pieces it wins over. God knows, we need a film glorifying the idiocy of the American Military Industrial Complex over commentary about our nation\u2019s military imperialism in Southeast Asia. So, thank you Francis Ford Coppola for writing such an insightful drama about the blubbering idiocy that was George Patton. Can\u2019t wait to see what trash you bring us next!\n\n\n[Audience laughter.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: But that\u2019s enough from me, you didn\u2019t tune in to hear me gab, let\u2019s welcome our first guest, shall we?\n\n\n[Audience applause.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Please welcome Francis Ford Coppola!\n\n\n[The curtains split and roll away, revealing Coppola standing there with his mouth agape. Cavatelli walks to the chairs and sits, patting the empty chair. Coppola stiffly walks to the chair to increased applause from the audience.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: So, tell me, what\u2019s it like to be a complete hack? I know, I know. Patton even compared the American political system to the Nazis, and you made sure that stayed in the movie. Good job! You\u2019re not a buffoon, blind drunk on nationalism and in love with the myths of the American military superiority at all, are you Frank? Bravo!\n\n\n[Cavatelli blows smoke from his cigar into Coppola\u2019s face, who blinks rapidly, coughing.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Before my producer starts bitching at me for being mean, let\u2019s drop the pretense. I\u2019m just playing around. Tell us something about what you\u2019re working on next.\n\n\nCoppola\n: \n[Coughing]\n I\u2019m working on a screenplay based on a bestselling novel, depicting the rise and fall of a fictional organized crime family in the years after World War II named Corleone.\n\n\n[Cavatelli puts the cigar down on the ashtray, pulls out brass knuckles and affixes it to his right hand, making a fist.]\n\n\nCavatelli\n: Oh really? Tell me more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+87\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
