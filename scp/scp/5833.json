As such, removal and relocation of the anomaly is deemed impossible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5833 is the designation given to a poorly constructed carnomantic anomaly situated within the hayloft of the Bijela farmstead, located on the outskirts of \u010cazma, Croatia, Yugoslavia.\n\n\nThe bulk of SCP-5833 is a large, misshapen lump of human flesh that has become fused with the hay bales and wooden decking of the barn. A pair of appendages are visible at the base of the structure, emerging from beneath the hayloft itself; these appendages resemble a pair of entwined legs. High concentrations of \n\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c\n1\n, a narcotic substance produced by \nGoI-0432 (\"The Hunter's Black Lodge\")\n, were found within the anomaly's bloodstream.\n\n\nDespite being biologically deceased, SCP-5833 has been observed performing limited motor functions such as muscle spasms and writhing movements beneath the skin. Unverified accounts of unintelligible vocalisations have been reported by a select number of individuals exposed to SCP-5833.\n\n\nAddendum 5833.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-5833 was discovered on July 13th, 1963 by Tomislav Kova\u010d, the former owner of the Bijela farmstead, upon hearing sounds originating from the hayloft. He later described these sounds as resembling human grunting and moaning noises.\n\n\nOn July 12th, 1963, Maria Kova\u010d, aged 16, had disappeared, believed by her father and the local community to have eloped with Vuk Bogumil, a Yugoslavian male, aged 18. Vuk Bogumil was wanted by the Yugoslavian police in connection with suspected narcotics trafficking.\n\n\nYugoslavian police investigations into the disappearance are on-going as of writing.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
