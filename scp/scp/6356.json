Maintenance activities, involving three D-Class personnel in hazmat suits, are scheduled biweekly for cleaning purposes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6356 is a large, vaguely spherical amalgamation of organs, bones, and flesh approximately 3 meters in height. SCP-6356 appears to be sentient, frequently moaning in apparent pain. SCP-6356's only discernible, fully functioning organ is a phallus.\n\n\nSCP-6356 occasionally speaks through unknown means in a masculine voice, often followed by sobbing. It appears to not respond to outside stimuli. While communicating, SCP-6356 exudes a thick fluid composed out of blood and semen.\n\n\nSCP-6356 was originally discovered in the personal room of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Greenfield, currently aged 25.\n1\n She reported it appearing within her closet, sobbing and covering her clothing in a variety of bodily fluids.\n\n\nSince initial containment, SCP-6356 has been repeating only the following line, interjected with sobbing:\n\n\n\n\nI won't ever be her. I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTroutMaskReplica's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6718\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6160\n \n(+81)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8790\n \n(+137)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6825\n \n(+91)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7345\n \n(+133)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6289\n \n(+131)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7640\n \n(+46)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6862\n \n(+81)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7362\n \n(+40)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7230\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8420\n \n(+87)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8380\n \n(+88)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8221\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1305\n \n(+86)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5315\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nFreefall\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaisies, Death, and Dysphoria\n \n(+75)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin her arms,\n \n(+35)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Son You Love\n \n(+51)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscatterbrained.\n \n(+54)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeny, Delay, Depose\n \n(+92)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading Off to Bed\n \n(+37)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoonlight, My Dear\n \n(+13)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Water\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPEN LETTER TO US GOVERNMENT\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVILE\n \n(+39)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Hundred And Fifty Thousand\n \n(+67)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt Will All Be Okay\n \n(+39)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nChristmas Industries (Art Exchange)\n \n(+17)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBohart's Life and Death\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJawn Proposal (Fanart!)\n \n(+23)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoy Un Perdedor\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA timely death.\n \n(+19)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrout's EPIC Authorpage\n \n(+169)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtExchange 2024 For UberGoober\n \n(+28)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
