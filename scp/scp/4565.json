The war was instigated by Pope Innocent III, whose aim was to obtain the \"keys of the Kingdom of Heaven\n2\n\" which were believed to be in the possession of the five main houses of Carcassonne.\n\n\nThe houses of Carcassonne were led by Duke Raymond V who was headquartered in the former province of Languedoc. The war concluded with the deaths of Viscount Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter V of Aragon and the destruction of South Languedoc.\n\n\nIt is theorized that SCP-4565-1 was obtained by the Knights Templar\n3\n, however, with the group's dissolution in 1312, its current location remains unknown.\n\n\nThis campaign is especially significant due to the conception of various anomalous military organizational techniques that would be recreated by Foundation pre-cursors in later years. The most significant of these would be the concepts of efficient team-based anomaly suppression groups and the utilization of anomalies to combat or suppress other anomalies.\n\n\nThe former would later eventually develop into \"\nRixantes Luce Sacra\n\" groups\n4\n and the latter would later be used as historical precedence for the acceptance of the \"Thaumiel\" object class.\n\n\nThe purpose of SCP-4565-1 has yet to be discovered.\n\n\nDocumentation\n: All primary and secondary source documentation and evidence regarding this SCP was obtained from the Vatican Holy Office for Secrets and Prophecies (\nSecretorum Camerus Prophetias\n). The veracity of all information about SCP-4565 has yet to be corroborated by any third party reference.\n\n\nThe sources from which the information is provided are written in Middle English or Latin and have been translated to English. The \"\ns\u00e6fernm\u00fa\u00f0a edl\u00e6can\n5\n\" has been translated from Old French to English.\n\n\n\n\nLetter\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Archbishop\u00a0of\u00a0Narbonne\u00a0Gebhart\u00a0Kosmas\u00a0to\u00a0Viscount\u00a0Raymond\u00a0VI\u00a0of\u00a0Toulouse\u00a0regarding\u00a0SCP-4565-1\n\n\n\n\nLetter\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Archdiocese\u00a0of\u00a0Narbonne\u00a0to\u00a0Viscount\u00a0Raymond\u00a0VI\u00a0of\u00a0Toulouse\u00a0regarding\u00a0SCP-4565-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the most friendly, the most humble count of Carcassone, Raymond V of Toulouse, son of Raymond IV, son of Aquitaine III, House of Trencavel, by the grace of God and the blessings of God onto the entire House.\n\n\nFrom the follower of his holiness, the executor of God's Will, the leader of Narbonne, Archbishop Gebhart Kosmas.\n\n\nGood tidings to you, o' friend of God. You will hereby be aware that the highest office has come to be aware of the illness that pervades the lands of Languedoc.\n\n\nThe call of heathenism and blasphemous ideology has scourged and spread through Toulouse. The benevolent, Pope Innocent the Third, has come to find a solution and as such, I advise to follow the steps that have come to you.\n\n\nListen 'o Count, the Council of Cardinals has learnt of many faithful items of which all shall be taken in God's name. The first of which is the Grail, which has been found in Jerusalem. The second is the Ark, which has been found in a new land to the West. And the third is the key, which has been found rumored to be in Languedoc.\n\n\nThat key, which Saint Peter held to his corpse when the sun swallowed the land and all of God's children wept, is said to with you.\n\n\nThe call of the divine is upon you, o' great sir. We fear that the key will be stolen by those pagans that plague the land, as the once-great churches lay bare. Already, the five great cathedrals have been usurped by the heretical sects.\n\n\nWe advise at once to follow his holiness's message to at once deliver the keys which will grant us passage to the highest level. Sainthood and Kingship await, once it has been delivered.\n\n\nIn hopefulness, respect, faithfulness, and God-given duty, the Bishop Aphex, Duke of Auvergne, was present and witness to the writing of this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViscount Raymond VI (pictured center, sitting on lap) instructing his army\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following information is taken from the original transcript of \"\nThe Cathar Crusades: A History of Genocide and Magic\n\" by Severus Iona, 1854.\n\n\nChapter 3: Old Bonds Burn and New Relations Sprout from the Ashes\n\n\n\u2026Raymond V denied the notion that he owned the key to Heaven and accused Archbishop Kosmas of slander against his governorship.\n\n\nThe period in which this letter was sent was the height of Cathar conversion in southern France and simultaneously occurred while the tensions rose between the Church and local leadership. By this point, five provinces had already been mostly converted.\n\n\nDue to the anti-priesthood tenet of the sect, the area was in direct opposition with the Catholic Church. In 1201, the archbishop of Milan listed Catharism as an \"enemy of Catholicism\" and this was used as an excuse for the incoming Crusade.\n\n\nIn 1203, plans for the Albigensian Crusade began when various barons of southern France called for independence from King Phillip II. At the same time, Raymond V married Beatrice Alba, the granddaughter of King Peter V of Aragon, to secure a military alliance in time for the oncoming conflict.\n\n\nPlans were established by the Catholic Church to utilize various occult technology stolen from Constantinople and Jerusalem during the Fourth Crusade which ended five years prior in 1202. In 1204, the Council of Cardinals announced the start of the Crusade and called for volunteers from Northern France.\n\n\nDue to the rather low amount of initial Crusaders, Pope Innocent III permitted the use of psyche-altering machinations that persuaded more individuals to join the conflict\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomalous Methods of Combat Overview\n\n\nCorpse Fiends\n\n\nAngel Men\n\n\nAnimal Soldiers\n\n\nBread Doubling\n\n\nDaemons\n\n\nAnti-Anomaly Crusader Teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous thaumaturgic and magical combat varieties were used during the entirety of the conflict. It is unclear on which exact groups employed anomalous weaponry and to the extent that such means were used in relation to contemporary weaponry.\n\n\nIt is known that utilizing anomalous methods during the conflict became normalized by at least 1217, according to letters from Raymond VI to occult magicians and the \"\nRexa Mundi\n Internal Declaration\n6\n\" that was passed by Bishop Iona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnights encountering manipulated corpses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is believed that Cathars used thaumaturgic magic to revive beheaded prisoners of war and force them to fight. The exact amount of dead soldiers used is unknown but it is estimated to be about 1,000-5,000.\n\n\nRecords of these anomalous entities date to 1212 when they were first used in the Siege of Carcassone. It is generally thought that they were quite ineffective in battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrusader with wings attached\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed in the Battle of Minerva in 1218, so-called \"Angel Men\" were Crusaders that were manipulated to fly using large wings. In the letters of Joshua the Clean\n7\n, these type of \"abominations\" would carry a scythe and sweep down \"from the black skies into the red fields.\"\n\n\nIn order to combat these entities, Cathar groups would develop the precision stone-trebuchet which would later go on to be used in other non-anomalous conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattle of Termes, 1226\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the large loss of Cathar soldiers during the fall of Carcassone, Raymond VI decided to utilize animal life in Languedoc as replacements for infantry soldiers. Other animals used include snails, dogs, and rats.\n\n\nThe skulls of these entities are, occasionally, found in farm fields in modern-day Occitanie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeasants eating during a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFruit trees and wheat fields blessed with thaumaturgic magic that would heavily increase the output of available food was used throughout the war by Cathar groups.\n\n\nIt is known that consuming such magically-amplified food resulted in deleterious effects but the exact outcome is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriest summoning various unknown entities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic-linked churches and institutions in Languedoc would begin work on summoning extra-versal entities in 1207. For more information on containment, please refer to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassacre of Biggore, 1228\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams of 6-8 specially trained Crusader knights would be segmented and sent into areas of extreme anomaly concentration to eliminate all life.\n\n\nThe members of the team would have specific spells, kinetoglyphs, and charms that would facilitate mass death. These teams would be used extensively during the last few years of the campaign to clear the land for occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Destruction, Creation, Combining it All\n\n\n\u2026Raymond V was assassinated in the sacking of Bogomil in 1220. In the same year, his 3-year-old son, Raymond VI, a reality manipulator, summoned various \"demonic\" entities that caused a rebellion through the ranks of the Church's army.\n\n\nIn a final bid, to steal the key of Heaven from Raymond VI, Pope Innocent decided to siege the capital of Languedoc, the city of Toulouse\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\u00e6fernm\u00fa\u00f0a\u00a0Edl\u00e6can\u00a0#12\u00a0Log\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\nS\u00e6fernm\u00fa\u00f0a\u00a0Edl\u00e6can\u00a0#12\u00a0Log\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Unknown, likely 11/3/1228, the Siege of Toulouse\n\n\nLead Speaker:\n Richard Le Grant\n\n\n\n\nRichard Le Grant:\n This beest Richard Le Grant, high constable of his baroness Raymond the sixth of the once most wondrous Carcassone.\n\n\nWe hereby name oursleves within this most wondrous hall, warriors of the five edged eye, and with this tool yond the gods has't did grant us, shalt we maketh the divine true.\n\n\nMonk Gawyne:\n And i beest, Monk Gwayne, son of Arthur, son of Ancelot.

And we shall liveth, and all shalt beest valorous on this earth.\n\n\nMonk Gawyne:\n Hush dear sire, the dead men approach and the whispers of death weigh the air. Maketh ready the spears and fire.\n\n\n(\npause for 5 minutes\n)\n\n\nRichard Le Grant:\n We has't hath reached the walls of Toulouse and the armies of Yaldabaoth and church await us. We hath brought the key and we shall make great haste towards God's child, Raymond.\n\n\nHe hath sent word the war shall beest ov'r lief and the dead men shalt wend back to hell and the harpies shall fly hence and the occult shalt once again leaveth this land.\n\n\nMonk Gawyne:\n 100 men art hath left and we shall die forth the land. This is our home and yet the sky hast did turn black and the travelling lamp hast did turn red with fury. The last day is upon the land and I desire yond in limbo at which hour all our dead, god shalt chooseth us from the many.\n\n\n(\npause for 5 minutes\n)\n\n\nRichard Le Grant:\n We beest in the midst of fighting and i shall drop this tool anon. The key hast been given to Raymond but they has't overrun god's city. Praise beest to Peter, Raymond, and all who is't square in god's name. Five keys, five counties, they will die in threes, but we die in fives.\n\n\n(\npause for 3 minutes\n)\n\n\nUnknown Crusader #1:\n What is this? Likely some tool of the damn'd.\n\n\nUnknown Crusader #2:\n Leaveth knave. Hell is upon us, the sky hast did turn black and some fire is gathering in the sky. Square while thee can and die now, while Heaven is near.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12: The End and Its Consequences\n\n\nDuring the siege of Toulouse in 1228, Viscount Raymond VI obtained the key from its storage place in Lastour. Later, when the siege ended, a massive blast engulfed Toulouse and many other neighboring cities.\n\n\nThe true cause of the blast is unknown, but it is theorized that it was caused by the magician Jeronium Malgerious, the acting Archbishop of Catalonia.\n\n\nAfter the full defeat of Raymond VI and Peter V, the French King Phillip II occupied the region. The Catholic Church oversaw the rebuilding effort, especially of the city of Toulouse, in which they assigned the Knights Templar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Head\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Knights\u00a0Templar,\u00a0Christian\u00a0Debois\u00a0to\u00a0Pope\u00a0Innocent\u00a0III\n\n\n\n\nLetter\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Head\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Knights\u00a0Templar,\u00a0Christian\u00a0Debois\u00a0to\u00a0Pope\u00a0Innocent\u00a0III\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo his holiness, Pope Innocent III\n\n\nFrom the follower of God, head of the army of Heaven, Christian Debois\n\n\nThe grail has been taken from the \nflesh\n in Jerusalem, the ark has been extracted from the far west (with many deaths), and the key has been obtained from the \nfive houses of France\n.\n\n\nSoon we will begin construction. \nHe is no longer broken\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
