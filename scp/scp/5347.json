Photographic and visual evidence of SCP-5347-1 has been discredited due to its resemblence to a \nFata Morgana\n1\n, and entry to SCP-5347-1 has been deemed impossible by any means outside of SCP-5347-2.\n\n\nSCP-5347-2 is known only to occult groups and thus requires no special containment procedures.\n \nThe proliferation of an unrelated non-anomalous meme has made a part of SCP-5347-2's procedure a common phrase in certain communities, and as such has led to an exponential increase in victims of SCP-5347-2 since May 2020.\n New information regarding the procedures of SCP-5347-2 should be reported to the SCP-5347 Research Head.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5347-1 is a partially-submerged island off the coast of \nHy-Brasil\n. Due to the transitive nature of Hy-Brasil itself, SCP-5347-1 has appeared at multiple locations, usually appearing approximately 3 nautical miles off the coast of a calm and temperate beach. Attempts to approach SCP-5347-1 by any form of non-anomalous travel has been deemed impossible, as despite attempting to approach SCP-5347-1, any vehicles or persons appear to move in place approximately 1 mile from SCP-5347-1. SCP-5347-1 will maintain its position for exactly 3, 5, 13, or 17 days before disappearing under heavy fog.\n\n\nSCP-5347-1 uniformly manifests with identical topology and size. Slight shifts, such as felled trees, fishing nets, and small signal or cooking fires indicate individuals sent to SCP-5347-1 remain active between manifestations. Sub-surface imaging has revealed \nlarge cocoon-like pods\n attached to the island's coast.\n\n\nSCP-5347-2 is a series of thaumic rituals and triggers which, when enacted properly, teleport an individual to SCP-5347-1. The current specifics of SCP-5347-2 are unknown, though certain aspects and phrases have been identified in \nDocument Hayforth-ESHU\n.\n\n\nFindings of Document Hayforth-ESHU\n was a book obtained from college student and amateur occultist Vanessa Hayforth following her 1966 entry to the \nPseudonymous Timberland\n. It described several occult rituals, including some mentions of SCP-5347-2. Much of the document's mentions were unclear, but the following mentions could be gleaned:\n\n\n\n\nThe subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be painted with ceremonial tattoos and markings. This is believed to be a purely ceremonial aspect of the ritual, as no victims of SCP-5347-2 have been known to have been painted with such markings.\n\n\nThe subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be of fae bloodlines, or have had their ancestors sworn to a fae blood pact - due to the proliferation of fae geneology during the first occult war, approximately 70% of humans alive today are believed to have trace amounts of fae blood.\n\n\nThe subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be within \n\"three times five times 13 times 17 Deisc\u00e9im\"\n2\n of the current manifestation of SCP-5347-1.\n\n\nThe subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be told the exact phrase \"\nYou are going to Hy-Brasil\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a typical SCP-5347-2 triggering image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n In early 2020, a non-anomalous image macro was proliferated around the internet with unfortunate similarity to the specific trigger phrase of SCP-5347-2. Due to this, an on-going coverup campaign is in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
