Four guards from TF-Xi-629\n1\n are to be stationed at the entrance of Greenback at all times, armed with amnestic agents in the event of a breach. All individuals entering Greenback must have a clearance level of at least three, a minimum Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV)\n2\n of 10.0, and direct approval from the current lead researcher.\n\n\nShould TF-Xi-629 receive any notice of the anomaly spreading via SCP-6365-2, they are to become mobile and be dispatched to contain the anomaly. TF-Xi-629\u2019s mobile assignment is to obtain any instances of SCP-6365-2 outside of Greenback and bring all occurrences of SCP-6365-2 to Site-529. If anyone has consumed SCP-6365-2 by the time TF-Xi-629 has arrived, they are also to be brought to Site-529. Additionally, those near where the new instances of SCP-6365-2 should be monitored for any changes in technology usage and/or behavior.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6365 is a mind-altering anomaly affecting the suburban town of Greenback, New York. The anomaly began on July 10, 2016 (a Sunday), when SCP-6365-1 manifested on every doorstep in the town simultaneously at approximately 9:00 AM.\n\nSCP-6365-1 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.98 meters in height wearing a black and white uniform resembling those common to mid-20th century milk delivery services, with brand markings for a nonexistent \"Milk on Sundays Co.\". Upon manifestation, SCP-6365-1 produces six glasses of a liquid presumed to be milk and then disappears after placing the glasses on the doorstep. SCP-6365-1 has not been observed to do any activities other than this.\n\n\nThe glasses of milk (designated as SCP-6365-2) resemble glasses used in milk deliveries prior to 1950. SCP-6365-2 creates a strong desire for anyone near the liquid to consume it, but this effect can be nullified with enough concentration from the observer. However, tests showed that some subjects still are not able to resist SCP-6365-2, and may need to be physically halted from getting to SCP-6365-2. After consumption of SCP-6365-2, anomalous effects begin to manifest to whoever consumed it.\n3\n Listed below is a timeline that shows the anomalous effects of SCP-6365-2 after being consumed.\n\n\n\n\n1 day: The person who consumed SCP-6365-2, who will further be referred to as Subject-6365-A, begins to use modern-day technology less.\n\n\n2 days: Analogous items from Subject-6365-A\u2019s house that were not used pre-1950s begin to disappear and may be replaced depending on the item. This occurs slowly starting with small objects before moving on to bigger objects.\n\n\n3 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s personality, dialect, and in rare cases, accent shift. Dialect often switches to being always happy, language use becomes more professional and interjections have been observed to be used more, and accent transforms into transatlantic.\n\n\n5 days: The process of modern-day items disappearing and/or being replaced is finished. All possessions of Subject-6365-A have disappeared or been replaced with analogous items historically accurate to the 1940s. How exactly this is performed is unknown, but due to the sudden disappearance of large objects, it seems to be through reality-altering methods.\n\n\n7 days: Subject-6365-A begins to paint their house grey. Additionally, any photos taken of Subject-6365-A or photos taken in their vicinity will come out black and white.\n\n\n14 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s memory begins to be affected, as they begin recalling events that never happened in their life. This includes, but is not limited to: interactions with others that never occurred, getting on a high school sports team, and getting high-ranking occupations. Subject-6365-A also may begin forgetting events that happened to them, most often traumatic events.\n\n\n30 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s memory is reset every day, forgetting what happened the previous day. However, Subject-6365-A still can recall some events in their life, whether real or fabricated. Subject-6365-A still functions as a humanoid being, and these effects seem to have not caused any issues in their life.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The anomaly\u2019s mind-altering capabilities seem to alter the mind of Subject-6365-A to believe the current era is the 1940s. This effect is aided by the changes in their household.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anomaly was discovered when many members of Greenback reported SCP-6365-1 to their police station for suspicious activity. By the time the Foundation arrived, the entire town of Greenback had consumed SCP-6365-2; the town will from this point on be referred to as SCP-6365-3. SCP-6365-3 has changed its social structure immensely, and the entire town has started to discuss different political matters. The citizens talk about how strong central government has become, and how corporations have posed a threat to the American lifestyle. Many residents talk about what seems to be a war, which is assumed to be World War II due to the mentions of fascist leaders.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the people of SCP-6365-3 seem content with their lives and lifestyles, and show no desire to leave their town. They seem to have not noticed anything different about themselves or others, however, testing has shown that when someone wears clothing with the appearance of the post-1950s era, the citizens\u2019 attitude shifts. This includes, but is not limited to: verbal abuse; apathy; viewing the person wearing such clothing as inferior; physical assault; and stalking.\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a06365-1\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6365-1\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Lillian Row, a citizen of SCP-6365-3\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Richard Kochev\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted 16 days after SCP-6365-2 was consumed by Mrs. Lillian Row.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Good morning, Mrs. Row. How are you feeling?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n I am feeling great! But I feel that \u201cMrs. Row\u201d is a bit too formal, so you can call me Lillian.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Well then Lillian, have you noticed anything different about you or other town members?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n This is the most excitement we\u2019ve had in years! Being interviewed by\u2014 wait, what are you guys again?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n We are just some scientists from the government taking surveys, no need to worry. So, before this interview, I heard you discussing with your neighbor about some sort of \u201cmilkman?\u201d\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Yep! You see, every Sunday Ben puts our milk on our doorsteps for the week. We don\u2019t have any way of keeping it cold, unfortunately.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Can you tell me more about this Ben? Perhaps some of his employment history, where he lives, stuff like that.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n That Ben is like a son to me! He\u2019s been our milkman for nearly 6 years now, at least I think. He hasn\u2019t been working for too long, but he really seems to like his job! Always shows up at 9 AM exactly! He works for \u201cMilk on Sundays\u201d I think, I\u2019m not entirely sure, to be honest. Oh! And he\u2019s about 28! His birthday was a few weeks ago.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n How long has he been working for Milk on Sundays again?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n (Laughs) I just said that: 12 years. He\u2019s really good at his job you know! Milk always comes at exactly 9\u00a0o\u2019clock. I don\u2019t know how he does it.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n You have said he\u2019s worked for a little bit, 6 years and 12 years. You said he\u2019s like a son to you, but he\u2019s 3 years older than you. Additionally, you never told me where Ben lives.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Oh that Ben! He\u2019s so whole milk that you would think he only does his job to get those children the nutrients and not for any money! It seems like that too. He hasn\u2019t even asked for a raise yet! Isn\u2019t that crazy?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Whole milk?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Oh you know! When someone\u2019s really kind! Have you never heard that before?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n I have not. However, you still have not answered any of my questions about Ben.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Yes I have! I\u2019ve answered all of them! You sure are one lousy policeman, aren\u2019t you! (Laughs) I\u2019m just kidding around; I could never do what you do!\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n (Silence)\n\n\nLillian Row:\n It\u2019s a wonderful day out, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Well Lillian, I believe that\u2019s all I have to ask you currently. You may go now if you would like.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Thank you! Have a great rest of your day, Mr.\u2014 oh I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think I ever caught your name.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n It\u2019s Dr. Bradley.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Well, you go and have a great day Dr. Bradley! And let me know if you need anything else! Even if you\u2019re just hungry! (Laughs)\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Even after further questioning, any information about this \u201cBen\u201d constantly changed, except his name, occupation, and place of work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore interviews showed similar results: subjects were constantly contradicting themselves and continued despite attempts to point out these discrepancies. The whereabouts of SCP-6365-1 after manifestation are unknown, but Foundation staff have seen the entity and confirmed its existence. Few interactions have occurred between Foundation personnel and the entity, but SCP-6365-1 continued as if the staff member was not present. Listed below is an interaction staff had with SCP-6365-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a06365-1\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 6365-1\n\n\nForward:\n The following log is from a video camera put on Agent David Bushe\u2019s vest when going to interact with SCP-6365-1.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Bushe walks toward SCP-6365-1.\n\n\nAgent Bushe:\n Excuse me, sir?\n\n\nSCP-6365-1 showed no signs of hearing Agent Bushe.\n\n\nAgent Bushe:\n Ben, is it?\n\n\nStill no reply from SCP-6365-1.\n\n\nAgent Bushe:\n Hey, buddy\u2014\n\n\nAgent Bushe attempted to tap SCP-6365-1 on the shoulder, but his index finger when straight through SCP-6365-1. He quickly pulled it away from SCP-6365-1.\n\n\nAgent Bushe:\n Fuck! (Talking to radio) What do I do now?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n (From radio) See if a more static object can phase through it, like a stick.\n\n\nAgent Bushe grabbed a stick from a nearby tree and it as well phased through SCP-6365-1. Roughly 3 seconds later, SCP-6365-1 demanifested as its task was finished.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n (From radio) Well that\u2019s certainly interesting. Come back to the Site.\n\n\nAgent Bushe then exited SCP-6365-1.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n From the log, it has been concluded that SCP-6365-1 is a type-\u03a0 spectral entity\n5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6365-1:\n On July 10, 2017, exactly one year after the anomaly began, the town of SCP-6365-3 started to air on TV. This was discovered by Agent Claudia Lind of TF-Xi-629 when she was watching television to pass the time. While changing channels, she paused on the channel that showed SCP-6365-3. Lind was a guard for Interview 6365-1, so she recognized the interior of Lillian Row\u2019s home and immediately reported it to the Foundation.\n\n\nAnything that occurs in Greenback is televised onto this channel. The town does not seem to have any awareness of this fact. The program seems to be a sitcom set in the 1940s, filmed with grainy cameras and laugh tracks. Due to the fact that it seems to just be a normal sitcom, the public is unaware of what is truly going on. However, due to the need for further interviews and testing, Dr. Logan Andrews has been assigned to the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebriefing\u00a0with\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Andrews\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebriefing Records 6365-1\n\n\nLead Researcher:\n Dr. Richard Kochev\n\n\nNewly Added Researcher:\n Dr. Logan Andrews\n\n\nForeward:\n Prior to this debriefing, all that Dr. Andrews knew was he was being assigned to a new SCP. Additionally, as Dr. Andrews suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he was permitted to bring a fidget.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n You know, somehow I knew you\u2019d be the one debriefing me \u2018Chev.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n I\u2019ll let that slide as a nickname, but just this once. Dr. Andrews, you have recently been assigned to a new anomaly, correct?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. Why would I be here if I wasn\u2019t?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Well, here is your new assignment: SCP-6365. I will give you this file to read. Please let me know when you\u2019ve finished.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Why don\u2019t you just give me a little storytime?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n (Silence).\n\n\nDr. Andrews began reading, but then stopped about halfway through the article.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n You know, it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve worked together. Last time I remember seeing you was when you\u2014\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Logan, just read the damn file.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n (Laughs)\n\n\nDr. Andrews finished reading a few minutes later. The further he got into the article, the more he began to fidget.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I\u2019m finished.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Thoughts?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n This certainly is strange, but in our line of work everything is. Why am I being assigned to this?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Because this small little town is now being broadcast to the world, and we would like to keep testing it. Additionally, you needed a new assignment, and given your skill with improvisation, we thought you would be a good fit.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I\u2019m sorry, but what did you mean by \u201cbeing broadcast to the world?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n It\u2019s on television. It\u2019s like some weird sitcom, and we have no idea how to stop it. The channel it\u2019s on doesn\u2019t even have any trace of ever existing.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n There are so many more researchers who could do this! Why don\u2019t you pick any of them?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Didn\u2019t you read the file? You need to have a high CRV level, of which you have an abnormally high level. We have no idea what will happen out there, but you\u2019ll be able to handle it.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Oh yes, I remember that now. (Pauses) Huh, what do you know?\n\n\nAt this point, Dr. Andrews stopped fidgeting and began to wave his index finger while talking.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I remember you always used to talk about how you wanted to get to level four clearance. Now, here you are in charge of an anomaly. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to get that promotion.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n A promotion would be nice, but it\u2019s not like I need it.\n\n\nThere is a minute-long silence, accompanied by the noises of clicking from Dr. Andrews\u2019 fidgeting.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n So, what do you say? Any questions?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I mean, I guess I have to.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n I\u2019m glad you\u2019re joining us.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven these new circumstances, new measures have been taken: secondary class has now become conscientia\n6\n; the Department of External Affairs (DEA) is now involved in the anomaly; any changes to the special containment procedures must be authorized by the DEA; any testing ideas must be authorized by the DEA. The DEA is involved due to its objective of obscuring anomalies to the public.\n\n\n\n\nHow we proceed with SCP-6365 being broadcasted is very important. We need to be very careful with our testing from now on. Obviously, we have Dr. Andrews to help with that, but at the end of the day, he is human. He could make a mistake, and just one slip up might require amnestics for the whole world, which we don\u2019t have the supplies for. He seems ready for the change of pace though, so I, along with the DEA, officially approve further testing of SCP-6365. Best of luck, Andrews. - Dr. Kochev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a06365-1\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum Testing Log 6365-1\n\n\nResearcher:\n Dr. Logan Andrews, while being supervised by other Foundation personnel watching through a television.\n\n\nTesting Subjects:\n Lillian Row, Fred Row, and Jill Row\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Andrews walked up to the doorstep of Lillian Row, her husband Fred, and their daughter Jill. The entire scene is being broadcast on television, so it is crucial Andrew remains in character.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Andrews knocks on the door, which is heard on the television. The citizens seem slightly confused but open the door.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Good morning! My name is John, and I'm traveling through town for a few days, care to show me around?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Why, hello! I'm Lillian Row. We don't get many visitors, come in and take a seat!\n\n\nFred Row:\n Hello there! I'm Fred, and that over there is my daughter Jill. Welcome into our quaint little town. Can I get you anything to drink? How does some milk sound?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n No thank you, I've already had some milk for breakfast this morning.\n\n\nDr. Andrews raises his index and middle finger, a sign to researchers watching that there were no cameras or abnormalities in the room.\n\n\nFred Row:\n Well it sure is a good thing you're drinking milk! I swear you should look at the kids who don't.\n\n\nJill Row:\n Once this kid at my school didn't drink milk for a whole week, then he got stuck in a tree. We don't even know how he got there! It sure was funny to watch!\n\n\n(Laugh track)\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Really? Well, that\u2019s interesting because-\n\n\nFrom this point on, any conversation recorded is from Dr. Andrews' memory. For the first time since SCP-6365 started airing, a commercial appeared. The commercial was for Milk on Sundays, though it never listed any ways of contacting them.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n -I had many friends who didn't drink milk when I was your age and they turned out just fine.\n\n\nLillian, Jill, and Fred Row simultaneously:\n Would you like some milk?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I'm not thirsty.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n It's good for you.\n\n\nJill Row:\n It's right here.\n\n\nFred Row:\n Just one little sip.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Well, would you look at the time! I have to go, but it was nice meeting you!\n\n\nFred Row:\n Stay.\n\n\nDr. Andrews begins to leave, but Fred and Lillian Row pin him to the ground. Jill begins to walk towards the milk on the table in the other room.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Well, uh, this is awkward! I\u2019ll just see myself out.\n\n\nJill Row:\n Open wide!\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Son of a bitch!\n\n\nDr. Andrews attempted to throw Fred and Lillian off of him, but they did not move at all. He punched Fred in the stomach and Lillian in the face, and then he ran out of the house towards the exit of SCP-6365-3.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Just after Dr. Andrews left SCP-6365-3, the show resumed as if nothing had happened, however, Lillian appeared to have a black eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a06365-1\u00a0Discussion\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum Testing Log 6365-1 Discussion\n\n\nForward:\n Immediately following Dr. Andrew\u2019s statement of what happened during the testing log, this interaction occurred in Dr. Kochev\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n \u2014and then I ran back here.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Why did you do that?\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n What do you mean \u201cwhy?\u201d I almost became some zombie-like thing. I feel like that\u2019s a pretty good reason.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Do you know what your job is? You need to research this anomaly, not run away from it!\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n I can\u2019t research the anomaly if I can\u2019t remember who I am!\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Don\u2019t speak to me like that, I am your superior and\u2014\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Listen to me, you little shit. Just because you\u2019re higher up than me doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right. And maybe I shouldn\u2019t talk to you like that, but you shouldn\u2019t just yell at someone for something that isn\u2019t even their fault! I did what I needed to do to survive.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n And now people are wondering why their favorite character has a black eye!\n\n\nDr. Andrews began to appear visibly distressed.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n Well, their favorite \u201ccharacter\u201d assaulted me.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Get the hell out of my office.\n\n\nDr. Andrews:\n We both know I did absolutely nothing wrong, and we both know this is because you\u2019re worried about that stupid little promotion of yours. Fuck you and your promotion!\n\n\nDr. Andrews then stormed out.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Andrews was put on paid leave by Dr. Kochev for disrespecting a superior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, since he did end up making a mistake, we are now down one researcher. I will take full responsibility for the next few tests. I will do what Andrews did, but \nbetter\n. - Dr. Kochev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a06365-2\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Addendum Testing Log 6365-2\n\n\nResearcher:\n Dr. Richard Kochev, while being supervised by other foundation personnel watching through a television. Foundation personnel also spoke with Dr. Kochev through an earpiece telling him what to say.\n\n\nTesting Subjects:\n Lillian Row\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Kochev walked up to the doorstep of Lillian Row. Dr. Kochev was told to be officer Bradley, who was just following through on an investigation.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Take two.\n\n\nDr. Kochev then knocked on the door, which was answered by Lillian Row. She opened the door to her house a few seconds after.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Why this sure is a surprise! Dr. Bradley, right?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n That\u2019s right! Mind if I come in? Just need to ask you a few more questions.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Come on in!\n\n\nDr. Kochev then stepped into the house and was visible on camera. As soon as he did, he showed signs of distress.\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Dr. Bradley, are you okay?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n (Grunts) Yeah, my ear is just ringing a bit.\n\n\nFoundation personnel tried to communicate with Dr. Kochev, but he did not show any signs of understanding. Kochev then moved his hand to his right ear and deactivated his earpiece.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Do you mind if I take a seat?\n\n\nLillian Row:\n Of course! Would you like a glass of water?\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Oh, yes, please.\n\n\nDr. Kochev then took a seat and seemed to show signs of confusion. Lillian then gave him water, which he quickly started to drink.\n\n\nDr. Kochev:\n Wait a second, this isn\u2019t\u2014\n\n\nAnother commercial for Milk on Sundays played, the second one since air.

        "Addendum 6365-1: On July 10, 2017, exactly one year after the anomaly began, the town of SCP-6365-3 started to air on TV. This was discovered by Agent Claudia Lind of TF-Xi-629 when she was watching television to pass the time. While changing channels, she paused on the channel that showed SCP-6365-3. Lind was a guard for Interview 6365-1, so she recognized the interior of Lillian Row\u2019s home and immediately reported it to the Foundation.\nAnything that occurs in Greenback is televised onto this channel. The town does not seem to have any awareness of this fact. The program seems to be a sitcom set in the 1940s, filmed with grainy cameras and laugh tracks. Due to the fact that it seems to just be a normal sitcom, the public is unaware of what is truly going on. However, due to the need for further interviews and testing, Dr. Logan Andrews has been assigned to the anomaly.\nGiven these new circumstances, new measures have been taken: secondary class has now become conscientia 6 ; the Department of External Affairs (DEA) is now involved in the anomaly; any changes to the special containment procedures must be authorized by the DEA; any testing ideas must be authorized by the DEA. The DEA is involved due to its objective of obscuring anomalies to the public.\nDr. Kochev is now considered terminated by the Foundation though it is acknowledged that he has not ceased life function. He has been on television multiple times, and has been seen responding to \u201cDr. Bradley\u201d. He now is employed in a previously non-existent lab in SCP-6365-3 called \u201cMOS 7 Labs\u201d which is a popular location for children in the town.

        "1 day: The person who consumed SCP-6365-2, who will further be referred to as Subject-6365-A, begins to use modern-day technology less. 2 days: Analogous items from Subject-6365-A\u2019s house that were not used pre-1950s begin to disappear and may be replaced depending on the item. This occurs slowly starting with small objects before moving on to bigger objects. 3 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s personality, dialect, and in rare cases, accent shift. Dialect often switches to being always happy, language use becomes more professional and interjections have been observed to be used more, and accent transforms into transatlantic. 5 days: The process of modern-day items disappearing and/or being replaced is finished. All possessions of Subject-6365-A have disappeared or been replaced with analogous items historically accurate to the 1940s. How exactly this is performed is unknown, but due to the sudden disappearance of large objects, it seems to be through reality-altering methods. 7 days: Subject-6365-A begins to paint their house grey. Additionally, any photos taken of Subject-6365-A or photos taken in their vicinity will come out black and white. 14 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s memory begins to be affected, as they begin recalling events that never happened in their life. This includes, but is not limited to: interactions with others that never occurred, getting on a high school sports team, and getting high-ranking occupations. Subject-6365-A also may begin forgetting events that happened to them, most often traumatic events. 30 days: Subject-6365-A\u2019s memory is reset every day, forgetting what happened the previous day. However, Subject-6365-A still can recall some events in their life, whether real or fabricated. Subject-6365-A still functions as a humanoid being, and these effects seem to have not caused any issues in their life. Conclusion: The anomaly\u2019s mind-altering capabilities seem to alter the mind of Subject-6365-A to believe the current era is the 1940s. This effect is aided by the changes in their household.",
        "How we proceed with SCP-6365 being broadcasted is very important. We need to be very careful with our testing from now on. Obviously, we have Dr. Andrews to help with that, but at the end of the day, he is human. He could make a mistake, and just one slip up might require amnestics for the whole world, which we don\u2019t have the supplies for. He seems ready for the change of pace though, so I, along with the DEA, officially approve further testing of SCP-6365. Best of luck, Andrews. - Dr. Kochev",
        "Well, since he did end up making a mistake, we are now down one researcher. I will take full responsibility for the next few tests. I will do what Andrews did, but better . - Dr. Kochev",

Four guards from TF-Xi-6291 are to be stationed at the entrance of Greenback at all times, armed with amnestic agents in the event of a breach.

    "description": "SCP-6365 is a mind-altering anomaly affecting the suburban town of Greenback, New York. The anomaly began on July 10, 2016 (a Sunday), when SCP-6365-1 manifested on every doorstep in the town simultaneously at approximately 9:00 AM.\nSCP-6365-1 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.98 meters in height wearing a black and white uniform resembling those common to mid-20th century milk delivery services, with brand markings for a nonexistent \"Milk on Sundays Co.\". Upon manifestation, SCP-6365-1 produces six glasses of a liquid presumed to be milk and then disappears after placing the glasses on the doorstep. SCP-6365-1 has not been observed to do any activities other than this.",
