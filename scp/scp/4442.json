All previous residents have been given Class-B amnestics and relocated, and all geographical records of the area since 1963 have been wiped or destroyed.\n\n\nThe town was converted to a Foundation facility\n1\n in 1976 after Incident Digamma-874, and is currently used as an MTF barracks and training facility. All contact with SCP-4442 and its immediate vicinity is monitored closely by site staff. Up to 150 personnel can be on staff at one time, with the town functioning as a location to teach Tier I-III Defensive Driving courses.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-4442 is a four-way traffic stop in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Florida. It is of standard construction for the time period.\n2\n It uses one Crouse Hinds \"D\" type 4-way signal, with its signature \"Smiley Face\" lenses hung over the center of the intersection. Span wire is attached diagonally across the street to two utility poles six meters in height.\n\n\nSCP-4442 continues to function as a normal four-way traffic light, in spite of it no longer having access to a power supply or the regular maintenance a unit of its age would require. SCP-4442's anomalous effects are triggered when a manned street legal vehicle passes directly underneath the signal; the driver of this vehicle will be designated SCP-4442-A for the duration of SCP-4442's effect. For the next 30 days, any moving violation to which SCP-4442-A is at fault will result in subjectively appropriate vandalism to SCP-4442-A's primary vehicle, designated SCP-4442-B. SCP-4442-B may not be the vehicle used to initiate the initial event, or even the vehicle currently registered to SCP-4442-A; rather, SCP-4442-B appears to be the vehicle to which SCP-4442-A is most emotionally attached at the time of crossing SCP-4442.\n\n\nAny text produced by SCP-4442 is printed as matte black\n3\n 576-point Impact font directly on the outer body of the vehicle. Testing has shown that the severity of the vandalism is proportionate to the severity of the moving violation; additionally, statements manifested are personalized to the driver.\n4\n For details, see addenda.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0I:\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a03\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0 Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 4442-003:\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n D-10959\n\n\nSCP-4442-B:\n White 1969 Ford Bronco Sport\n\n\nResearcher:\n Dr. Draper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolation\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLocation of Writing\n\n\nApproximate Time to Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft turn on red\n\n\n\"A good way to get T-Boned, Jackass.\"\n\n\nWritten across the driver's side of the vehicle.\n\n\n15 Seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging lanes without signaling\n\n\n\"Please Body Check Me\"\n\n\nWritten along the passenger's side of the vehicle, notably the side facing the rest of the available lanes.\n\n\n11 Seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrake-checking\n\n\n\"How's My Driving?

When interviewed, D-99406 disclosed that they had committed all 15 murders over the course of seven years. As they were never convicted for the murders,\n10\n D-99406 was given the option of federal incarceration or extended service as D-class personnel. D-99406 was subsequently transferred to Biological Containment Site-66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Site-4442.\n\n\n2\n. The town had been last updated for traffic security in 1959.\n\n\n3\n. SCP-4442 will not change the color of its text, even if the vehicle in question is black.\n\n\n4\n. How SCP-4442 sources this personal information is currently unknown.\n\n\n5\n. D-10959's mother's home phone number.\n\n\n6\n. D-80994 was initially incarcerated for Vehicular Homicide.\n\n\n7\n. Agent C. Trauss\n\n\n8\n. Florida officially recognized passing on the right as a moving violation in 1999.\n\n\n9\n. SCP-4442 had not originally detected this as a moving violation; Agent Trauss was noted as standing in the middle of the intersection and speaking aloud, with SCP-4442's replies appearing in a smaller font alongside the passenger side door.\n\n\n10\n. Due to this fact, researchers concluded that SCP-4442's ability to detect past and current offenses does not function by anomalously accessing legal records, but rather by wholly unknown means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4441\n | SCP-4442 | \nSCP-4443\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4442\n\" by Kitsun3, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
