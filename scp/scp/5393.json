The area around SCP-5393 and surrounding areas have been turned into Provisional Site 34.\n\n\nThe information campaign 5393.34 \u201cHigh Radiation Levels\u201d has been initiated and expeditions into the Mariana Trench around Provisional Site 34 from unauthorised personnel have been prohibited. There is to be constant surveillance on the entities in SCP-5393 in the case of abnormal behavior.\n\nExperiments regarding SCP-5393-A have been denied following statements from the Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5393 is the designation given to an area approximately 4000m below sea level, located near the Mariana Trench. Sightings have reported large structures made of osseous matter in SCP-5393, as well as the several animate endoskeletons of various fish, sharks, whales and humans.\n\n\nFollowing \nnotes\n written by Elizabeth Crane\n1\n, SCP-5393 entities seem to be controlled by an infectious microalgae, designated SCP-5393-A. This microalgae has the ability to travel and secure itself onto organic matter. After first contact has been made, SCP-5393-A will decay the cartilage and muscle around the body, eventually reaching the desired endoskeleton. It will then reanimate it, and transport it to SCP-5383.\n\n\nAddendum 53.35\n\nThe following email correspondences are between Senior Researcher Dr. Michael Lynx and Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Employee Elizabeth Crane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted.\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!\n\n\n\n\nRe:\u00a0Inquiry\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0behavior\u00a0of\u00a0Davy\u00a0Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nSubject:\n Inquiry on the behavior of Davy Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nI\u2019m emailing to ask about the behaviour and wellbeing of the specimen in your care, \u2018Davy Bones\u2019. I believe you were given the documents on the anomaly. I would like to ask a little bit more from you, to further our research and understanding of the situation.\n\nDo you have any more information on the origins or workings of the microalgae that you might have missed? Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nFrom:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Inquiry on the behavior of Davy Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey Lynx! :)\n\nThanks for showing interest in Davy!! He\u2019s dead and well at our center. Behaviour-wise, he\u2019s as energetic as ever and loves pets (we have been careful, as we realise the awareness needed around the algae) but if you\u2019re wondering about the origins of Davy Bones, I have been looking into it.\n\n\nDespite Davy\u2019s skeleton being millions of years old, analysis on the microalgae has shown it to be active only in recent times, around 1989-present . I believe it\u2019s completely natural. The algae must have been dormant for a while, probably frozen. Davy Bones\u2019 siblings also seem to be fairly old. My best guess is that the microalgae and it\u2019s hosts were originally from shallow waters, but had frozen over and sunk below during an unprecedented time. Hope this helps! Ask me if you need anything else. - Bessy :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Inquiry on the behavior of Davy Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nThank you for your hypothesis. I ask this because we have been recording the site, and have noticed some things that are\u2026concerning. Mostly an influx in the amount of endoskeletons being linked with submarine disappearances. It\u2019s out of the blue, I know, but I believe the behaviour you saw meeting Davy is just a taste of something much more sinister.\n\nHas Davy become more isolated, or aggressive? I have a thought at the back of my mind. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nFrom:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Inquiry on the behavior of Davy Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s strange. More skeletons? I\u2019m not sure what to think. On your point, Davy Bones hasn\u2019t changed in terms of behavior, but he does enjoy \u2018staring\u2019 at the employees! It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re studying each other haha. Maybe we should focus primarily on the big bone buildings, didn\u2019t the pictures sortof make them look like castles? As well as the animals chosen\u2026eels, sharks, whales, humans\u2026 It\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t know what to make of it, but I\u2019d like to know what your thoughts are. Let me know! I\u2019d love to hear more about the \u2018bone kingdom\u2019 (That\u2019s the name I\u2019m giving it!) - Bessy :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nSubject:\n Re: Inquiry on the behavior of Davy Bones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nIt is indeed strange. I reason the whales are due to whalefalls, but the rest I am uncertain of. We have been keeping constant surveillance on the\u2026kingdom, and I expect you to do the same with your specimen. Best of luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 53.36\n\n\nA note inside a glass bottle was recovered at Provisional Site 34.\n\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEYES EVERYWHERE.

It seems related to the anomaly. Did you receive anything? How's Davy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Michael Lynx, Senior Researcher\n\n\nFrom:\n Elizabeth Crane, Wilson\u2019s Wildlife Solutions Aquatics Team\n\n\nSubject:\n Re:Urgent: Bone Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really, no. Davy's been his usual self, except he's been doing his funny little 'staring' quirk a lot more now! I can see why this is concerning, taking the note's subtext into account. For now, we may consider covering up Davy's enclosure. But, our best interest is our critters safety and well being in our sanctuary, remember, 'where all critters are welcome'!\n\nI wonder what it means by 'cavalry'? There's no horses, only sharks, whales, a couple fish. It's confusing. We don't even know who wrote it.\n\nEither way, I wish you the best luck! Let me know more about the situation as you go along. - Bessy :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Employee on the Aquatics Team.
