While no other anomalous organization had a substantial aerial presence, SCP-8086 was created preemptively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP-8086-1 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral anomalous technologies were used in SCP-8086's construction to strengthen it. Among these was SCP-8086's weaponry, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-1, which was purchased from \nHunter Industries\n.\n2\n\n\nInitial testing revealed that SCP-8086-1 instances were substantially more effective than nearly every mundane alternative, as well as many more expensive anomalous alternatives.\n\n\nSCP-8086's anomalous properties emerged approximately two months after the SCP-8086-1 instances were installed. (See Addendum 2)\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n Surveillance footage of SCP-8086 gaining its anomalous properties\n\n\n\n\n00:31:40\n - Red fog begins slowly seeping out of the SCP-8086-1 instances.\n\n\n00:32:10\n - The fog begins seeping faster.\n\n\n00:32:52\n - On the ground of the hanger near the cockpit of the SCP-8086-A instances, the feet of several SCP-8086-\n\udb86\udd7d\n instances begin manifesting.\n\n\n00:34:02\n - The SCP-8086-\n\udb86\udd7d\n finish manifesting and climb into the cockpits.\n\n\n00:34:45\n - All of the SCP-8086-A instances take off, except for one.\n\n\n00:34:53\n - The remaining SCP-8086-\n\udb86\udd7d\n instance takes a moment to inspect the cockpit before putting on a pair of aviator goggles and taking off.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3:\n Meeting Transcription\n\n\nAs Dr. Maslov T. Manferd had recently manifested back into baseline reality and due to his knowledge of other universal planes, he was brought on to the SCP-8086 research team. The following is a meeting between him, the Senior Commander of MTW Kappa-15, and Foundation Mobile Air Force's Operations Commander.\n\n\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Maslov T. Manferd, SCP Foundation Site-470\n\n\nSr. Comdr Am\u00e9lie Loguidice, MTW Kappa-15\n\n\nOps. Comdr Amadeus F. Kayser, Foundation Mobile Air Force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSr. Comdr Loguidice and Ops. Comdr Kayser are both sitting on opposite ends of the table. Kayser glares at Loguidice for a moment before sighing and looking away. Loguidice is looking at her lap.\n\n\nBoth look towards the doorway as Dr. Manferd enters the room, holding several folders. He pulls a chair out and sits down.\n\n\nManferd:\n Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Traffic was a nightmare.\n\n\nManferd:\n (\nclaps his hands together\n) So!\n\n\nHe turns and stares at Loguidice as his expression falls.\n\n\nManferd:\n Mind telling me exactly why you decided to purchase weaponry from an organization with a reputation for trying to trick us?\n\n\nKayser chuckles.\n\n\nKayser:\n This'll be good.\n\n\nManferd shoots a glance at Kayser before returning his gaze towards Loguidice and tilting his head slightly.\n\n\nLoguidice:\n Okay, \ntechnically\n I did not buy the guns from Hunter Industries. I bought the guns from someone else who bought them from Hunter Industries.\n\n\nManferd:\n That's not really much better. Regardless, you should have\u2014 hold on.\n\n\nManferd rummages through one of the folders before taking out a packet.\n\n\nManferd:\n Did you even look over this agreement you signed? Look, it says right here\u2014\n\n\nManferd:\n (\npauses\n) Huh. Okay\u2026 admittedly there's not much that's incriminating here.\n\n\nLoguidice:\n See! How was I supposed to know?\n\n\nManferd flips through pages before he pauses and raises an eyebrow.\n\n\nManferd:\n Wait, hold on. What's this?\n\n\nManferd detaches a sticky note, which is digitally recreated below, from the page and unfolds it, reading it out loud.\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: The purchased guns have a \nslight\n problem where constant usage allows for demon spirits to emerge! Hunter Industries didn't do enough stress testing, it seems.\n\n\nYou're welcome for the warning!\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManferd buries his face in his hands as Kayser begins laughing.\n\n\nManferd:\n \nRight\n, you mean to tell me you supposedly looked over this whole packet and you didn't notice a sticky note?\n\n\nManferd:\n It doesn't even say who it's by, it just says \"love\". Who am I meant to feel loved by, hmm? Not you, clearly, as you seemingly don't love any of us here enough to look over the manual given for anomalous weaponry.\n\n\nManferd turns to face Kayser.\n\n\nManferd:\n And you're not off the hook either, so you can quit your cackling. As operations commander, you outrank her, so you really should've, at the very least, looked over her proposal for the weaponry. It's your responsibility to make sure everything in the Air Force runs smoothly.\n\n\nKayser:\n Well\u2014\n\n\nManferd holds his hand up.\n\n\nManferd:\n Look, we've done enough bickering. The privilege to keep doin' that belongs to your direct supervisors. What I'm here to do is to help come up with a solution to our SCP-8086 problem.\n\n\nKayser:\n Surely we can just shoot them down? We do it over an unpopulated area, no harm no foul, right?\n\n\nLoguidice clears her throat.\n\n\nLoguidice:\n Actually, uh, that's not an option.\n\n\nKayser:\n And why is that?\n\n\nLoguidice:\n I did some digging after SCP-8086 began exhibiting anomalous properties. Apparently \nwe can't intervene in the case of Hunter Industries and its interests.\n\n\nManferd:\n Well, some research is better than none, but she \nis\n correct.\n\n\nKayser:\n What? Why?\n\n\nManferd:\n Some Site Director a while back was really dumb and got hypnotized and tricked into signing a blood pact.\n\n\nKayser:\n Ugh, okay. So, if we can't do anything, then how are we supposed to do something about SCP-8086?\n\n\nManferd:\n \nWe\n can't do something, but that doesn't mean that someone else can't do something for us.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4:\n List of Proposed Organizations\n\n\nThe following is a collection of various Foundation-allied/aligned organizations that were considered for aid in containing SCP-8086.\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n Global Occult Coalition\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n An arm of the United Nations and a major player in the anomalous world. Is more willing to outright destroy anomalous threats to normalcy.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Denied.\n\n\nNote:\n We don't need an anomalous Washington Naval Treaty.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n Wilson's Wildlife Solutions\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n An anomalous wildlife service centered around Boring, Oregon. Has an agreement with the Foundation to handle Safe and Euclid Class fauna-based anomalous in the region.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Denied.\n\n\nNote:\n You guys are lucky that these submission forms are anonymous. Unfortunately for us, Tim can't send an army of pigeons to fight SCP-8086.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n A member of the GOC's Council of 108 and also the foremost insurance provider for the anomalous world. Has a number of outstanding contracts with the Foundation.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Approved.\n\n\nNote:\n Unfortunately, they looked over the specifics of the blood pact and there isn't a legal loophole that we haven't tried already. Fortunately, getting someone else to act on our behalf \nis\n an available loophole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n SCP Foundation, Site-666\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n A Foundation site that lies within Undervegas, a city within the Fourth Circle of Hell. It primarily deals with the Tartarean entities within the region, also known as demons.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Approved.\n\n\nNote:\n We sent them the documentation and they rejected us, saying something about how \"these are a different kind of demon\" or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n Unusual Incidents Unit\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n The occult branch of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations. Has a collaboration treaty with various anomalous organizations, including the Foundation, in the Southern United States.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Denied.\n\n\nNote:\n The chances that we can guide SCP-8086 towards the Southern United States without being shot down first is minuscule. Similarly to the Coalition, we don't want them trying to make it so that we can't expand our air force more than necessary. Perhaps we need to expand our horizons on this search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n \nImperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study (IIPES)\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n The national normalcy organization of the Third Antarctic Empire located within SCP-1483. Its alliance with the Foundation is tenuous at best and is more akin to tolerance.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Denied.\n\n\nNote:\n Not only will it be impossible to get the IIPES's aircraft out of the cave portal, but SCP-8086 vastly outperforms anything they can get in the air. Besides, they probably wouldn't help anyway. Regardless, I like where your head is at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Name:\n \nZhujihui\n\n\nOrganization Description:\n The successors to the Foundation in SCP-CN-1997.\n4\n It is also a strong ally to the Foundation.\n\n\nFinal Decision:\n Approved\n\n\nNote:\n Just who we need.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5:\n Meeting between Dr. Maslov T. Manferd and Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet\n\n\nDue to Dr. Manferd's personal ties with Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet of the Zhujihui, he was chosen to negotiate their aid with SCP-8086.\n\n\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nDr Maslov T. Manferd, SCP Foundation Site-470\n\n\nEsteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet, Zhujihui\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Manferd sits in the corner of a \nHong Shing\n coffee shop, The Phases' Brew. He looks down at his watch before looking back up, smiling as he sees Es. Sch. Scarlet enter the building. He sits down across from Manferd.\n\n\nScarlet:\n Maslov! What a pleasure it is to see you.\n\n\nManferd:\n It's nice to see you too. Unfortunately, I'm here on official business today.\n\n\nManferd takes a folder out of his bag and slides it across the table.\n\n\nManferd:\n Through a series of unfortunate events, we've got some possessed planes we're not allowed to directly interfere with. That's where you guys come in.\n\n\nScarlet picks up the folder and begins looking through the pages inside it.\n\n\nManferd:\n I was hoping that you guys could send some aircraft to duke it out with 'em. Some wyvern-ships would work wonders. Dunno if they'd fit but maybe you can get them through the \nRumsey Line\n?\n\n\nScarlet flips to another page.\n\n\nScarlet:\n I believe that X Chamber of Commerce\n5\n set up a Way in the water around Hong Shing. If it's big enough to fit container ships, it should be able to fit some wyvern-ships and dragon-ships.\n\n\nManferd:\n So you'll help?\n\n\nScarlet:\n Ah, not me specifically. I've got some \nZhujihui business to take care of in Proy Bria.\n Regardless, I'll try and get a task force sent out.\n\n\nManferd:\n Thank you! You're a real lifesaver.\n\n\nScarlet:\n Say, while you're here, some friends and I were gonna take a trip to Bong Shing.\n6\n Would you want to come along?\n\n\nManferd:\n Appreciate the offer, but I'm okay, thank you.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral days after this meeting, the Zhujihui sent its Omega-31 Task Force to intercept SCP-8086 as it was flying above an uninhabited portion of Siberia. After a several-minute-long dogfight, Omega-31 emerged victorious, only suffering the loss of one wyvern-ship. Reclassification of SCP-8086 to Neutralized is ongoing.\n\n\nAfterward, several Mobile Task Force squads were dispatched to recover the wreckage. All aircraft were recovered, except for two SCP-8086-A instances and Omega-31's wyvern-ship.\n\n\nIt is currently unknown where these aircraft are and how they disappeared, as the closest inhabited settlement to the crash site is 250\u00a0km away.\n\n\n\n\nA new version of this page is available.
