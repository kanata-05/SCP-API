Foundation web-crawlers will scan all portions of the web for the phrases \"dado juice\" and \"dado juice energy drink\". Upon detection of either phrase, MTF Alpha-4 (\"Pony Express\") is to be deployed with the primary mission of containment of SCP-3238. Secondary mission protocols are to detain PoI \"dado\" for Foundation questioning. Testing of SCP-3238 is suspended at this time.\n\n\nIn the instance of an active incident involving SCP-3238, all civilian personnel are to be evacuated from the affected area. All survivors, witnesses, and emergency responders to an SCP-3238 incident are to be administered Class-C Amnestics and undergo false memory implantation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3238 is a collection of 132 aluminum canisters, each containing 236 ml of an unknown anomalous fluid. Each canister has the words \"dado juice\" written in black marker. There are three variations of SCP-3238, each denoted by a different image, also crudely drawn on the aluminum container in black marker: fire, an international radiation symbol, and a sphere with trailing motion lines. The fluid itself is iridescent red in color and displays the same viscosity as water.\n\n\nWhen SCP-3238 is ingested by a human subject, one of three anomalous effects will occur to the subject, in relation to the symbol on the canister, shown on table 1A.\n\n\nTable 1A- Anomalous Effects of SCP-3238\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire\n\n\nSubject core body temperature begins to rise rapidly within 60 seconds following ingestion. After 2 minutes, subject's body starts rapidly releasing Oxy-dicyanoacetylene gas as if pressurized. The gas will then spontaneously ignite, burning at ~4,990\u00a0\u00b0C, in a 1 meter radius around the subject.\n\n\n\nAs the gas contains both fuel and oxidizer, it has proven extremely difficult to extinguish the resultant fire, even if completely submerged in water. The resultant cadaver continues to emit Oxy-dicyanoacetylene gas and burn for up to 5 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadioactive\n\n\nSubject begins to sweat excessively within 60 seconds of ingestion. Within 3 minutes, subject begins to emit electromagnetic radiation in the form of gamma rays, measured in excess of 800 roentgens/min. The subject will succumb to this exposure within no more than 5 minutes, displaying all symptoms of acute radiation poisoning.\n\n\n\nOther living beings within a radius of 20 meters of the subject may absorb a lethal dosage of gamma rays within minutes. Within a radius up to 100 meters, other living beings may absorb lesser amounts of radiation, dependent upon range and time of exposure. The cadaver may emit fading amounts of radiation for up to 5 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSphere in motion\n\n\nSubject begins to become excessively nervous and jittery within 60 seconds of ingestion. Within 2 minutes, subject begins accelerating rapidly upwards, reaching a velocity of 11.186\u00a0km/s within 30 seconds. Subject will experience forces in excess of 50 G during the course of this acceleration.\n\n\n\nAny objects impacted by subject will not stop or alter the course or speed of the subject. The outcome of any such collision is both the immediate liquefaction of the subject, and severe damage or destruction to the object. Subject will escape earth orbit and continue to accelerate away from Earth at a speed of ~11.186\u00a0km/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine instances of SCP-3238 were discovered following a suspected terrorist attack on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, 06/14/18. The remainder were recovered from the north Las Vegas Amazon Fuilfillment Center.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nIRC Logs- Recovered 06/17/18\n\nFoundation agents recovered a laptop from the 06/14/18 Las Vegas incident. The laptop was unusable, but the hard drive was recoverable using forensic software. On the hard drive, Foundation technical staff found IRC logs with evidence pertaining to SCP-3238.\n\n\n\n\n<NickServ>:\n Password accepted - you are now recognized.\n\n/join #dado\n\n\nhttp://dadolaundryandtan.net/chat\n\n\nTopic:\n sry caps key broke\n\nTopic set by \ndado\n on Fri Jun 01\u00a02018\u00a010:12:34 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)\n\n\n<multizig>:\n Hello\n\n\n<multizig>:\n uhhhh\n\n\n<multizig>:\n helllooooooooo?\n\n\n<dado>:\n hello yes this is dado\n\n\n<multizig>:\n You're the guy that does the research chemicals, right?\n\n\n<multizig>:\n You there?\n\n\n<dado>:\n i do fine pharmaceutical and yes sry dado type slow\n\n\n<multizig>:\n Cool, cool\n\n\n<multizig>:\n So look, I need something special\n\n\n<dado>:\n i am do very special for all clients\n\n\n<multizig>:\n Awesome.

Thanks\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Prime Page- 6/18/18\n\n\nFoundation web-crawlers discovered the existence of an Amazon item that fit the description of SCP-3238. This led to the mobilization of MTF Alpha-4 to the north Las Vegas Amazon Fulfillment Center. The operation led to the successful seizure and containment of 17 instances of SCP-3238, and the interception of 112 more instances that were en route to potential victims. The item has since been removed from Amazon by the directive of [NAME REDACTED]. A copy of the item listing has been archived in the Foundation logs, seen below:\n\n\n\n\nThe product reviews are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1-Star- Would not order again.\n\nGave me tons of energy for my upper sept-tentacle workout, but had a horrid aftertaste.
