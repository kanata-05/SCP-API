On December 15 I personally examined every member of staff at Area-21 at my clinic, and determined that no such exposure occurred. However, routine physical workups revealed discrepancies in the biology of two individuals, who were determined to have been exposed to a rare dormant strain of \nSCP-6425\n, requiring immediate quarantine.\n\n\nOn January 3\u00a02023, after a lengthy interrogation of captured insurgent SCP-6721, which I oversaw in my capacity as CMO, Director Kijek determined that it was responsible both for releasing the pathogen and precipitating the containment breach. Under my advisement, the Director has therefore ordered Area-21 locked down until further notice.\n\n\nCase updates will be promptly made available, and I am available to discuss the matter at any time via the SCiPnet messaging system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb ACCESS: ABRIDGED PERSONNEL FILE J_KIJEK_A21\n\n\nFetching file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia Kijek\n\n\n\n\nAcroamatic Abatement Group\n\n\nDiplomat\n\n\nSecurity Clearance Level: 4\n\n\nPost:\n Area-21 (April 2019-present)\n\n\nOffice:\n A-101\n\n\nEmail:\n \nten.12A|kejik_j#ten.12A|kejik_j\n\n\nPresent Assignment:\n Director, Treatment Area-21\n\n\nDirector Kijek is a veteran of the SCP Foundation's diplomatic corps.

She is able, via intense concentration and thaumaturgical stimulus, to observe energy vortices surrounding living subjects. These vortices correspond to vital elements of their personhood and disposition; after two decades of research, Dr. Astrauskas is able to judge the implications of each aura with precision accuracy.\n\n\nThe auras Dr. Astrauskas has identified are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nMood: a colour gradation between red and violet flowing from the crown of the head to the upper legs, mapping reliably to sixteen distinct emotional states;\n\n\nHealth: a series of discrete emissions from each organ or system, ranging from deep grey to bright white, indicating their relative strength and the presence or absence of sickness or disease;\n\n\nIntent: a glow in the eye sockets corresponding to the honesty of a subject's statements or their disposition towards the target of their attention;\n\n\nIdentity: a specific and highly detailed fluctuation in a colour which does not map to the known light spectrum, vibrating in unique patterns which allow for the positive or negative identification of individuals the auramancer has already encountered despite disguises, memetic intervention, or behavioural cues.\n\n\n\n\nThe extent to which Dr. Astrauskas is capable of perceiving each aura is defined by the state of her other senses. The mood aura produces distinct tastes; the health aura has an olfactory component; the intent aura is audible; the identity aura is tactile, and can be confirmed beyond any shadow of doubt through direct physical contact. When these senses are dulled or disabled, their respective auras are dimmed or made invisible.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas was trained in thaumaturgy at Site-43, and held tenure at Area-21 for many years. In 2003, her auramancy was instrumental in the thwarting of an \nattempted containment breach\n by hostile operatives. She has been involved in multiple research and containment projects since \u2014 often in overseas collaboration with her longtime friend and colleague Dr. Udo Okorie, Chief of Applied Occultism at Site-43.\n\n\nCurrent Research:\n Dr. Astrauskas is advancing a long-term Level 5 Classified collaborative project with Dr. Lillian Lillihammer; she is presently offsite on a related research sabbatical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppend this file?\n\n\n\u00bb Y END\n\n\nAlerts sent, and full session transcript appended.\n\n\nThis prompt has been idle for five (5) minutes.

Auramantic readings of all employees at each facility in descending order of urgency will be carried out as soon as is feasible.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6721 is a group of entities of unknown number who are capable of assuming the identities of extant human individuals, to the point where neither medical science nor most forms of anomalous identity confirmation can detect the irregularity. The effect is at least partially memetic; while a complete bodily transformation is possible, SCP-6721 instances have demonstrated the capacity to convince other individuals in their immediate proximity that they possess identities which diverge substantially from their physical appearance.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6721-1, Discovery:\n SCP-6721 was discovered at Area-21 on 01/03/2023 by Foundation thaumaturge Dr. Roz\u00e1lie Astrauskas. Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical to various European facilities, seeking consultations for a classified project related to her auramantic capabilities. On entering Area-21, she quickly discovered that the following individuals in the facility's command structure were in fact impersonators:\n\n\n\n\nDirector Julia Kijek;\n\n\nChief of Security Renata Ulman;\n\n\nChief Medical Officer Dr. Anthony Culp;\n\n\nSenior Researcher Dr. Kendra Oliver;\n\n\nJunior Researcher Catherine Wilt.\n\n\n\n\nShe was able to relay this discovery to two colleagues, Dr. Benjamin Salazar and Agent Heinrich Jacobi, before the SCP-6721 instances orchestrated her capture via Area personnel unaware of their true identities. Dr. Salazar and Agent Jacobi were subsequently neutralized via unknown means. As a containment breach alarm was set during Dr. Astrauskas' flight from security personnel, in order to maintain the illusion of Area-21's compliance with Foundation protocol and deflect outside scrutiny, a tentative SCP file was created describing Dr. Astrauskas as an enemy mole for GoI-5054 (the \ngiftschreiber\n) and curating the details of her capture to support this contention. Dr. Astrauskas was subjected to memetic reconditioning by Dr. Culp in order to generate a false 'confession' that she had entered Area-21 as a saboteur, which was then appended to her SCP file as an interrogation transcript. Stalling for time to ensure that Dr. Astrauskas had not communicated her suspicions offsite, Area-21 was immediately locked down on the pretence of \"ensuring information security and the containment of a potentially lethal pathogen.\"\n\n\nDr. Udo Okorie of \nSite-43\n had already filed a missing persons report on Dr. Astrauskas when she failed to respond to SCiPnet messages after leaving Site-91; as the elapsed time was low and Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical, this report was not given a high priority. Engaging multiple other staff members to bolster her security clearance level, Dr. Okorie correctly guessed at her friend's destination and remotely accessed A21NET on 01/04/2023. After examining multiple files relating to the unpublished SCP-6721 database entry and identifying multiple discrepancies in the narrative as presented, she alerted the Germanophone Branch and MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") that Area-21 was compromised. While Nu-7 was immediately mobilized, MTF DE-\ud835\udd0f (\"Die Inquisition\") was able to reach the Area within eleven minutes, and after covert infiltration engaged the interlopers.\n\n\nThe SCP-6721 instances impersonating Director Kijek and Junior Researcher Wilt evaded capture and escaped the Area, though wounded. The instance impersonating Chief Ulman committed suicide via cyanide capsule. After barricading themselves in the medical clinic, the instances impersonating Dr. Culp and Dr. Oliver used the medical waste disposal tunnel to enter the Large Solids Liquefaction Chamber in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-1. They then liquefied themselves.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas was released from containment. Memetic deprogramming was successful in restoring her cognition unimpaired, and she was remanded to the medical wing for treatment and interrogation. A transcript is appended below.\n\n\n\n\nDebriefing:\n Dr. Roz\u00e1lie Astrauskas, Site-91\n\n\nDate:\n 01/04/2023\n\n\nOfficer of Record:\n Acting Director Dr. Njeri Kamau, Area-21\n\n\n\n\n<Log begins.>\n\n\n<Dr. Astrauskas is lying in a hospital bed. Acting Director Kamau is sitting next to her on a plastic chair.>\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n I realize you must be very tired, so we will be brief. How did you figure it out?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n I'm an auramancer. I can read, among other things, identity auras. I worked at Area-21 for years; I know most of the people here.\n\n\n<Dr. Astrauskas suddenly begins to weep.>\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n You've been through a lot. I understand.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n No, it's not\u2026 never\u2026 never mind. Ah\u2026 I know most of the people here. I\u2026 I could tell that\u2026 I saw what I expected to see. But I met your boss, Kijek, at an AAG conference a few years back, and Oliver too of course \u2014 everyone in AcroAbate knows Oliver. I could tell as soon as I saw them that something was wrong.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n With your auramancy?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Yes, though I couldn't\u2026 tell you specifically why, I'm afraid.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n I see. So, once you had your suspicions, you contacted a few of your friends?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Yes. What happened to them? Heinrich and Ben?\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n They're marked as deceased in the personnel roster. We don't know how. Presumably the insurgents killed them.\n\n\n<Dr. Astrauskas sighs.>\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n And they would have killed me, too, once they knew I hadn't told anyone else, if not for\u2026 hmm.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n Yes?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n They must have slipped up, right? Who figured that out?\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n A friend of yours.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Udo Okorie.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n How did you know?\n\n\n<Dr. Astrauskas smiles.>\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Can I talk to her?\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n Of course. She's still at 43, because she kept digging while Hammer Down and Die Inquisition were \nen route\n, but your SCiPnet messaging permissions have been reinstated.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Hammer Down was coming?\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n That's right. They still are, in fact; they'll need to refuel here for the flight home. Dr. Okorie didn't know how badly compromised the Area was, and with the lockdown she assumed the worst.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n I see.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n Is there anything else you need to tell me? Did you detect any other insurgents?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n No. No, I think you got them all. Except the ones that got away, I hear.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n We'll catch them. I suspect your auramancy will be in high demand in the next few months. That research project you were working on is going to be badly delayed, I'm afraid.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n Mmm.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n What was it, if I may ask?\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n It's classified, sorry. Call ETTRA and ask, if you're feeling lucky.\n\n\nActing Director Kamau:\n I'll pass. Alright, you're going to be held here for observation for twenty-four hours, then released. Quarantine procedure says nobody in or out of this room during that period, but your tablet is on the table there if you want to contact your friend.\n\n\nDr. Astrauskas:\n I very much do.\n\n\n<Log ends.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb RUN: SCIPNET MESSAGING SYSTEM, CHECK MESSAGES\n\n\nExecuting.

No restrictions on her person are required. Directives issued by SCP-6721 are backed by the authority of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6721 is Dr. Roz\u00e1lie Astrauskas, a Level II registered thaumaturge with a speciality in auramancy. Through experimentation with synaesthesia in collaboration with memeticist Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, Dr. Astrauskas has discovered an ability unknown to the present state of anomalous science. By 'crossing the wires' of her senses of smell and touch, and the related auras of 'Health' and 'Identity', she is able to visualize a fifth aura tentatively identified as \"Origin.\" Brief experimentation with extradimensional biological entities transferred from Site-DE6 suggests that this aura pertains to a subject's relationship to baseline reality; individuals from alternate timelines or alternate universes 'read' differently in subtle but recognizable patterns.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6721-1, Discovery:\n On 01/03/2023, Dr. Astrauskas demonstrated this new talent by identifying the entire working population of Treatment Area-21 as being of extradimensional origin. Attempts to silence and terminate her after this discovery were thwarted by a combination of her own efforts and those of Dr. Udo Okorie of Site-43, via remote terminal. On 01/04/2023, MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") reclaimed Area-21 by terminating one hundred and twelve interlopers acting in the guise of SCP Foundation employees. The facility's original staff is presumed deceased, their remains subjected to acroamatic abatement processes by their replacements and liquefied in December of 2022.\n\n\nAnalysis of the insurgent cadavers is ongoing. Tentative identification suggests that they represent a formerly unattested sect of GoI-5054 (the \ngiftschreiber\n), cryptomantic cultists engaged in surreptitious warfare with the SCP Foundation. Their ability to defeat auramantic detection (as it was understood before Dr. Astrauskas developed her new capabilities) may originate from outside of baseline reality, as they do.\n\n\nTwo additional members of staff were terminated by the interlopers after contact with Dr. Astrauskas; review of their personal effects suggests they may have been covertly associated with GoI-6382 (the \nschriftsteller,\n) rivals of GoI-5054. Their presumed cryptomantic capabilities would explain why they were not neutralized and replaced until the insurgents were forced to move quickly to avoid exposure.\n\n\nIn recognition of their long service, the extraordinary performances outlined above, and their utility for persecuting the aforementioned conflict with GoI-5054 in the future, both Drs. Astrauskas and Okorie were promoted to Security Clearance Level 4 on 01/05/2023. Dr. Astrauskas has been granted one mandatory week's leave to recuperate before her new duties begin: conducting a schedule of random, unannounced examinations of all Foundation facilities to uncover any further insurgencies, adjunct to \nOperation FIREBREAK\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb RUN: SCIPNET MESSAGING SYSTEM, CHECK MESSAGES\n\n\nExecuting.

        "Addendum 6721-1, Discovery: SCP-6721 was discovered at Area-21 on 01/03/2023, spreading an infectious infohazard to active personnel. Earlier acts of sabotage have been retroactively attributed to the subject. An abridged transcript of the final altercation is appended below.",
        "Addendum 6721-2, Interrogation: The following interrogation was conducted five hours after detainment, once the subject's mental and physical assessment by Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anthony Culp was complete.\nSubsequent to this interview, Director Kijek ordered Dr. Culp to conduct a detailed pharmopsychological workup for SCP-6721. Dr. Culp confirmed that the subject possessed no additional information, and evidenced no medical intervention which could explain its loss of memory. He advised Director Kijek that in his professional opinion, the subject would at no point become a valuable intelligence asset. Security Chief Renata Ulman therefore recommended that the subject be terminated at once.",
        "Addendum 6721-1, Discovery: SCP-6721 was discovered at Area-21 on 01/03/2023 by Foundation thaumaturge Dr. Roz\u00e1lie Astrauskas. Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical to various European facilities, seeking consultations for a classified project related to her auramantic capabilities. On entering Area-21, she quickly discovered that the following individuals in the facility's command structure were in fact impersonators:\nShe was able to relay this discovery to two colleagues, Dr. Benjamin Salazar and Agent Heinrich Jacobi, before the SCP-6721 instances orchestrated her capture via Area personnel unaware of their true identities. Dr. Salazar and Agent Jacobi were subsequently neutralized via unknown means. As a containment breach alarm was set during Dr. Astrauskas' flight from security personnel, in order to maintain the illusion of Area-21's compliance with Foundation protocol and deflect outside scrutiny, a tentative SCP file was created describing Dr. Astrauskas as an enemy mole for GoI-5054 (the giftschreiber ) and curating the details of her capture to support this contention. Dr. Astrauskas was subjected to memetic reconditioning by Dr. Culp in order to generate a false 'confession' that she had entered Area-21 as a saboteur, which was then appended to her SCP file as an interrogation transcript. Stalling for time to ensure that Dr. Astrauskas had not communicated her suspicions offsite, Area-21 was immediately locked down on the pretence of \"ensuring information security and the containment of a potentially lethal pathogen.\"\nDr. Udo Okorie of Site-43 had already filed a missing persons report on Dr. Astrauskas when she failed to respond to SCiPnet messages after leaving Site-91; as the elapsed time was low and Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical, this report was not given a high priority. Engaging multiple other staff members to bolster her security clearance level, Dr. Okorie correctly guessed at her friend's destination and remotely accessed A21NET on 01/04/2023. After examining multiple files relating to the unpublished SCP-6721 database entry and identifying multiple discrepancies in the narrative as presented, she alerted the Germanophone Branch and MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") that Area-21 was compromised. While Nu-7 was immediately mobilized, MTF DE-\ud835\udd0f (\"Die Inquisition\") was able to reach the Area within eleven minutes, and after covert infiltration engaged the interlopers.\nThe SCP-6721 instances impersonating Director Kijek and Junior Researcher Wilt evaded capture and escaped the Area, though wounded. The instance impersonating Chief Ulman committed suicide via cyanide capsule. After barricading themselves in the medical clinic, the instances impersonating Dr. Culp and Dr. Oliver used the medical waste disposal tunnel to enter the Large Solids Liquefaction Chamber in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-1. They then liquefied themselves.\nDr. Astrauskas was released from containment. Memetic deprogramming was successful in restoring her cognition unimpaired, and she was remanded to the medical wing for treatment and interrogation. A transcript is appended below.",
        "Addendum 6721-1, Discovery: On 01/03/2023, Dr. Astrauskas demonstrated this new talent by identifying the entire working population of Treatment Area-21 as being of extradimensional origin.
