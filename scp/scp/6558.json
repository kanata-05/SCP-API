Do not close this file.\n\n2. Return to the infected file you were redirected to here from.\n\n3. Make a copy of all text relating to this file.\n\n4. Delete all text in the infected document referring to this file.\n\n5. Incinerate all electronics connected to your computer since you opened this file.\n\n6. Finish reading this document.\n\n7. Update Addendum 6558.1 with the text from the infected document.\n\n8. Incinerate the device you are using to read this file.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6558 is a phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages\n1\n. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations\n2\n. All references to SCP-6558 vary wildly. Using context from the infected files, SCP-6558 has been described as a toy plane, green moss, a sound frequency, a time-traveling jester, a dog, and the feeling of love.\n\n\nAlthough descriptions manifested by SCP-6558 have been overall incoherent, since its discovery, the descriptions have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant.\n\n\nIt is not fully known how SCP-6558 is able to spread. However, it has been determined that the higher the number of documents and devices containing info relating to SCP-6558, the quicker it spreads. Currently, all documents infected by SCP-6558 have been confined to the SCiPnet servers.\n\n\nAddendum 6558.1 Instance Archive:\n\nThe following are recorded instances of SCP-6558 before their removal\n3\n\nFrom the logs of \nSCP-2941\n4\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance Designations\n\n\nInstance Specifics\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2941-6\n\n\nPersian lime\n\n\n(\nCitrus \u00d7 latifolia\n)\n\n\nSCP-2941-6's morale has been shown to markedly increase when placed in a silent containment cell. Researchers are to do hourly checks to confirm that the speaker placed within -6's current bio-chamber is functioning correctly and that the audio file chosen by the current head researcher is playing on an uninterrupted loop at a minimum of 90db. At the time of writing, the sound of a knife scraping a glass bottle has been playing for eighty-four days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-\u25ac\u25ac-#\n\n\nTomato\n\n\n(\nSolanum lycopersicum\n)\n\n\nA spotlight is to be constantly shone into the containment cell.

Foundation personnel are expressly forbidden from doing so, but if absolutely necessary, they should refer to SCP-2941-7 directly, condescendingly, and repeatedly as any other name besides Terry. Names producing the most severe demoralization vectors so far include \"Ferguson\", \"Wingding\" and \"Budz\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt found in \nSCP-6556\n5\n:\n\n\n\n\nTy Rex:\n Wazzaaap Jurassic junkies!

A mountain range can be seen in the distance in the background of the shot. Dr. Grant pauses the video and zooms into the mountain range before beginning to speak.\n Contacting of Ty Rex is being attempted to have him remove all footage of SCP-SAAN. It Must Go Away.
