SCP-8732 is to be checked and cleaned on a monthly basis.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1 is to be given a monthly standard physical and mental health evaluation. It is mandatory for SCP-8732-1 to attend therapy sessions twice a week.\n\n\nBoth are to be screened for possible reinstatement of anomalous properties monthly.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-8732 is a worn 3x3x3 meter box composed of an indeterminate metal with a single plain door of similar composition on one face.\n\n\nPrior to neutralization, the interior dimensions of SCP-8732 were significantly larger than the exterior, measuring approximately 200x200x200 meters\n1\n. In the center of the room was a standard metal hospital bed with a plain mattress covered in traces of blood and cerebrospinal fluid and multiple tall candles which did not melt and could not be put out.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1 is a 164cm, 47kg woman with several large laceration scars visible on her forearms, thighs, and abdomen. Prior to neutralization, SCP-8732-1 was capable of involuntarily transmitting and receiving radio signals at certain frequencies and did not require any form of sustenance. SCP-8732-1 was contained within SCP-8732 and was incapable of exit prior to Foundation attempts at retrieval.\n\n\nAfter neutralization of anomalous properties, SCP-8732-1 was reintegrated into society and is currently living in Foundation employee housing with Researcher Mina Hargrove under the legal name Gabrielle \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Hargrove.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum-8732-1: Discovery\n\n\nSCP-8732 was discovered in a forest near Site-228 on 11/28/2024 after Site-228 monitoring equipment began to detect unusual radio signals. After pinpointing the location of SCP-8732, a significant aberration in Hume levels was detected in the area surrounding the anomaly. SCP-8732 was subsequently brought to Site-228 and placed in a temporary containment unit for initial research efforts.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum-8732-2: Interview Logs\n\n\nSoon after containment, SCP-8732's monitoring equipment began to receive radio signals with the voice of a young woman whispering unintelligibly. Researcher Mina Hargrove was selected as Research Head and attempted to conduct a radio interview with SCP-8732-1 shortly afterwards.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview 8732-1\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12/1/2024\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Mina Hargrove\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8732-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hello?

SCP-8732-1 remained completely silent for 15 hours after the interview, before continuing to whisper.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter an 8-day period of inactivity, SCP-8732-1 was heard repeatedly saying \"Hello? Miss Researcher?\" Researcher Hargrove was promptly informed and brought to SCP-8732's containment chamber.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview 8732-2\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12/9/2024\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Mina Hargrove\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8732-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hi, you wanted to speak to me?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Don't flatter yourself.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n We just wanted to ask some questions, if you're fine with it, of course.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Sure.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Okay then, I'll be referring to you as SCP-8732-1, is that okay?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Whatever.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Okay, then let's begin. First and foremost, could you tell us what you are exactly?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n \n[After a short pause.]\n A\u2026 woman? What else?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Well\u2026 what exactly is this box then?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Box? Like\u2026 the thing I'm in?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Maybe. Could you describe what you see, SCP-8732-1?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I can only see the floor, it's made of a weird dark metal, covered in black rust. There's a shitty hospital bed in here with me and some candles around it, nothing else.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hmm\u2026 It's definitely possible that I'm looking at the same thing you're inside of. Are there any other things you can tell me about it?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Well\u2026 the candles never melt or go out and it's echo-y as fuck\u2026 it's also kinda cold?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I see. Well, 8732-1, do you remember anything that happened before appearing in the room you're in?\n\n\n[Both remain silent for a few minutes.]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hello?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Ca-\u2026 I\u2026 I think I'm done talking.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Is everything fine?\n\n\n[Both remain silent for several moments, SCP-8732-1 is heard quietly sighing.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I'm\u2026 Yeah, I'm fine.

It'll make helping you out a lot easier.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I feel awful, I just hate being here all the fucking time, it's so awful. I hate being like this, being stuck like this. I just want to be happy.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I see. Well, is there anything I can do to help, 8732-1?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Can you cut the number shit, please?

How've you been keeping track?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n My period.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Oh\u2026 well, since you still menstruate, how do you stay fed and hydrated?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I don't, I haven't needed to eat or shit or anything since showing up here, I haven't needed to drink at all either. I can sleep sometimes but the bed's too uncomfortable and gross and I don't really get more tired than I already am. My hair is so fucking greasy. I hate it here. I just want out. I just want to- \n[SCP-8732-1 pauses briefly before letting out a long sigh.]\n Sorry. I'll stop raving.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Don't apologize, Gabby, it's fine. Do you still want to talk?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I think I'm fine. Thank you. I need to lay down for a bit.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Then get some rest.

Have you not seen it before?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n No, I've\u2026 I've been too scared to get far from the bed, it's really dark and quiet in here. I took one of my candles and tried just walking in one direction a while back, but the further I walked the more scared I got. I started to feel like shit and almost collapsed after a while so I ended up just turning back. I tried a few more times but it was all just the fucking same. I hate it in here.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I see. Well, I'll try to convince the higher-ups to let someone in. If you don't mind, of course.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Why would I? Just please get me out of here. Please.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Well, we'd most probably send in a remotely controlled drone before actually trying a rescue mission, for safety purposes. We could send a few items with it if you'd like? Just until we can fully get you out.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Oh\u2026 then I guess\u2026 a nightgown and some underwear would be nice. Pads, a hair brush, wet wipes, and\u2026 I'm not really sure what else\u2026 a couple books, I guess?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I doubt they'll deny such simple things so I'll see what I can do, I'll probably be busy for a few days while dealing with the logistics, so\u2026 just hang in there, Gabby.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Alright, thanks Mina. Do you think you'll be able to come in here at all? I miss seeing people.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Depends on the Director. We're pretty friendly, though, so I'm sure he'll hear me out if I buy him enough drinks.\n2\n\n\n[SCP-8732-1 and Researcher Hargrove laugh quietly together.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I hope I can see you soon, then.

Permission was granted, the drone and other requested items began delivery shortly afterwards.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4 days after Interview 8732-4, the drone, controlled by Researcher Hargrove and with a box of the requested items, was prepared in front of SCP-8732's door and the containment unit was sealed. A hydraulic system was installed to open the door remotely. Researcher Hargrove spoke to SCP-8732-1 during the delivery, SCP-8732-1 was informed of the drone's entry beforehand.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview 8732-5\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12/18/2024\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Mina Hargrove\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8732-1\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[The drone's camera is turned on.

Proceeding into SCP-8732.\n\n\n[The drone begins to lift off the ground and move forward slowly and the light is turned on as it enters. A floor with a similar appearance to the exterior of SCP-8732 is visible stretching into the distance, the light is incapable of illuminating any walls. The drone's radio begins to receive speech from SCP-8732-1 as it continues to move through the darkness.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Is that the drone? Mina?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hey Gabby, could you just tell me what you see exactly?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n There's just this bright light off in the distance, it scared the shit out of me. It's moving closer, I think?\n\n\n[Researcher Hargrove begins to flash the light.]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Do you see what I'm doing?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Flashing the light? Cut it the fuck out, it hurts.\n\n\n[Researcher Hargrove stops flashing the light]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Sorry, sorry, just makin' sure. I think I see a few dim spots of light a little further ahead. The drone's recording video footage so be careful.\n\n\n[The drone reaches a small hospital bed with a dirty mattress surrounded by tall, white candles which illuminate the surrounding area. An underweight woman is sitting on the bed covering her chest and squinting up at the drone; her legs are covered in dried blood. The drone ceases movement, deactivates the light, and slowly lowers onto the ground in front of SCP-8732-1. SCP-8732-1 stares into the camera.]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Hi there, Gabby.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Hey. So\u2026 this is my stuff?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Yeah, it should have everything you asked for.\n\n\n[SCP-8732-1 is silent for a moment before beginning to cry quietly.

Thank you.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Don't worry about it, dear. I'm always here to help. Need anything else before I leave?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n I think I'm good for now. Thank you, Mina. I'll see you soon?\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Most probably after some initial testing, just to make sure of all the stuff we can't properly detect through the drone.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Okay then. Bye, Mina\u2026 Thank you.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Don't mention it dear, I'll see you soon.\n\n\n[The drone begins to lift off the ground as SCP-8732-1 is seen waving at the camera. The drone pans around, activates the light, and begins to move back towards the entrance. Upon reaching the door and landing, the camera is deactivated.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShortly after the interview, SCP-8732-1 requested permission to speak with Researcher Hargrove outside of interviews. A psychiatric evaluation was performed on SCP-8732-1 and her request was permitted shortly after in order to provide her more social contact. SCP-8732-1 also requested multiple items between Interview-8732-5 and all proceeding interviews prior to neutralization.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter a D-class test, SCP-8732 was deemed safe for human traversal and Researcher Hargrove was granted permission to interview SCP-8732-1 within SCP-8732.

SCP-8732-1, are you ready for the questions?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Yep, ready when you are.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Alright then. First and foremost, could you tell us about before you ended up like this? It seems to be touchy based off our earlier interviews so you don't have to be specific, you don't have to answer either, okay?\n\n\n[SCP-8732-1 lets out a long sigh.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Okay.

I was a shitty 26-year-old art graduate, made most of my living doing, like\u2026 commissions and shit. I didn't usually have much of a reason to go out so I rarely talked to people outside my little high school friend group and randoms online. They eventually started moving on, getting partners, jobs\u2026 growing up. I got, uh\u2026 I got really lonely and relapsed into\u2026 well, a lot of things. I\u2026 I, um\u2026 I\u2026 woke up here after\u2026 offing myself.\n\n\n[Both remain silent for a short moment before sniffling is heard. Researcher Hargrove is heard standing up and walking to the opposite side of the table, verbally and physically comforting SCP-8732-1; muffled sobbing is heard for several minutes. Researcher Hargrove is heard moving her seat nearer to SCP-8732-1 after the cessation of SCP-8732-1's sobbing.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Sorry, it's been a while since I've been able to cry like that.

We can continue.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Okay then. Remember, you don't have to answer anything if you don't want to, okay? So, do you remember coming into contact with anything abnormal before ending up here?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Not particularly. Things were pretty normal leading up to it\u2026 Just working on commissions, sleeping 12 hours a night, talking to lesbians on Discord. Loser shit.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Well, was there anything odd about you physically or mentally before waking up here?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Again, not really, I guess all the mental and physical illnesses? But I've had those for a while so I can't really see how they'd do\u2026 all this.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I see. Well, could you give us more details about your stay here?\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Well, not much has happened, it was mostly static and random noises while I sat in this shithole and rotted. Now it's mostly just the sounds of mugs and you shits bumbling around your offices. No offense.\n\n\n[Researcher Hargrove is heard chuckling at SCP-8732-1's remark.]\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n None taken. Can you tell me about your experience trying to leave? We're currently approving getting you out of here, so say anything you find important.\n\n\n[SCP-8732-1 remains silent for a moment.]\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Yeah\u2026 well, I just started to feel really shitty and decided to turn back around, that's about it. A really bad headache, dizziness, weakness, just generally shit.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n I see. Well, do you wanna try again? I'll have to wait for approval but we're expecting it pretty soon.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n Yeah, I think I'd like that, it's been way too long since I've actually done anything worthwhile.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove:\n Okay, good, those're all the questions we have for now. I can still stay a bit longer if you'd like though.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1:\n That'd be nice.

        "Addendum-8732-1: Discovery\nSCP-8732 was discovered in a forest near Site-228 on 11/28/2024 after Site-228 monitoring equipment began to detect unusual radio signals. After pinpointing the location of SCP-8732, a significant aberration in Hume levels was detected in the area surrounding the anomaly. SCP-8732 was subsequently brought to Site-228 and placed in a temporary containment unit for initial research efforts.\n",
        "Addendum-8732-2: Interview Logs\nSoon after containment, SCP-8732's monitoring equipment began to receive radio signals with the voice of a young woman whispering unintelligibly. Researcher Mina Hargrove was selected as Research Head and attempted to conduct a radio interview with SCP-8732-1 shortly afterwards.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove waited for a response for several minutes before ending the interview. SCP-8732-1 remained completely silent for 15 hours after the interview, before continuing to whisper.\n\n\nAfter an 8-day period of inactivity, SCP-8732-1 was heard repeatedly saying \"Hello? Miss Researcher?\" Researcher Hargrove was promptly informed and brought to SCP-8732's containment chamber.\n\n\n\nSCP-8732-1 remained silent for 4 days before repeatedly calling for Researcher Hargrove, who was promptly brought to SCP-8732's containment chamber.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove requested permission to inform SCP-8732-1 about the door on SCP-8732 following the interview, permission was promptly granted by Director Cren.\n\n\nSCP-8732-1 requested Researcher Hargrove's presence the morning following Interview-8732-3.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove requested that a remotely controlled research drone be sent into SCP-8732 to perform scans of the interior and attempt to deliver the requested items to SCP-8732-1. Permission was granted, the drone and other requested items began delivery shortly afterwards.\n\n\n4 days after Interview 8732-4, the drone, controlled by Researcher Hargrove and with a box of the requested items, was prepared in front of SCP-8732's door and the containment unit was sealed. A hydraulic system was installed to open the door remotely. Researcher Hargrove spoke to SCP-8732-1 during the delivery, SCP-8732-1 was informed of the drone's entry beforehand.\n\n\nShortly after the interview, SCP-8732-1 requested permission to speak with Researcher Hargrove outside of interviews. A psychiatric evaluation was performed on SCP-8732-1 and her request was permitted shortly after in order to provide her more social contact. SCP-8732-1 also requested multiple items between Interview-8732-5 and all proceeding interviews prior to neutralization.\n\n\nAfter a D-class test, SCP-8732 was deemed safe for human traversal and Researcher Hargrove was granted permission to interview SCP-8732-1 within SCP-8732. Researcher Hargrove was fitted with a microphone and on-site staff assisted her in carrying a small table and two chairs into SCP-8732 in order to make the interview more comfortable for SCP-8732-1 and Researcher Hargrove.\n\n\nResearcher Hargrove remained with SCP-8732-1 for 2 hours following the interview.\n\n\nPermission to attempt retrieval of SCP-8732-1 from SCP-8732 was granted 9 days after the interview. A series of LED lights were placed in a path from the entrance of SCP-8732 to the location at which SCP-8732-1 was located, in order to assist the exit process.\n\n\nSoon afterwards, SCP-8732-1 was taken to the medical wing to run basic tests. Which yielded no anomalous results. As the reintegration process began, amnestics were administered to the relevant parties and her previous identity was reinstated. Researcher Hargrove offered to care for SCP-8732-1 during the reintegration process; Director Cren promptly accepted the proposition upon SCP-8732-1's insistence. SCP-8732 began to slowly lose its anomalous properties after SCP-8732-1's exit, eventually becoming completely inert with all the items inside disappearing. SCP-8732 was re-classified from Safe to Neutralized shortly afterwards.\nSCP-8732-1 and Researcher Hargrove were married 2 years after neutralization and continue to live in Foundation employee housing together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
