Once identification has been made, retention is considered a low priority. Redundant instances will be decommissioned as biological waste.\n\n\nDepending on the results of MTF Kappa-28's investigation, SCP-7492-B instances will either be amnesticized and released under long-term surveillance, or handed over to mundane authorities for prosecution. Reports shall be suppressed using Standard Cover Story 843 (\"Tell-Tale Heart\") or discredited via SCS 986 (\"Collegiate Tomfoolery\").\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7492 refers to the spontaneous manifestation of human body parts\n1\n (designated instances of SCP-7492-A) in residential properties across the United States. Each anomaly is fresh and bloodless, with no signs of lividity, rigor mortis, or defensive wounds. Following discovery, SCP-7492-A will decompose at a natural rate. Other characteristics vary.\n\n\nSCP-7492-A are always found among the possessions of a post-secondary student\n2\n (designated SCP-7492-B). SCP-7492 events take place during periods of heightened stress, often coinciding with major changes in SCP-7492-B's life. Documented stressors include academic performance, financial stability, housing security, health, and liability.\n\n\nAmong cases known to the Foundation:\n\n\n\n\n63% of SCP-7492-B contacted local authorities to report SCP-7492-A.\n\n\n31% unsuccessfully tried to conceal or destroy SCP-7492-A. Under questioning, one-third of subjects blamed their actions on external factors, such as social, financial or legal consequences.\n\n\n6% claimed recognition of SCP-7492-A and expressed a desire to keep it.\n\n\n\n\nTo date, every instance of SCP-7492-A has been a perfect biological match to the SCP-7492-B, despite the absence of corresponding injuries.\n\n\n\n\nTable 01.
