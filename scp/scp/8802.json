STEEP IT IN THE FECES OF UNWANTED SPANISH TAILORS. SUTURE ITS EYES TOGETHER SO IT CAN BEAR WITNESS TO ITS UNDENIABLE UGLINESS FIRSTHAND. MORE SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES TO FOLLOW!\n\n\nNaismith:\n Just a brief aside for the recording team, this is why I want \"please state your name for the record\" removed from our interview protocols, and\u2014\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \n(Hisses with incoherent rage.)\n\n\nNaismith:\n The sooner you calm down, the sooner you can go back to your solitary confinement.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nTHE TERMS ARE NOT YOURS TO DICTATE. WRENCH ME \nNOT\n FROM THE PALE BLACK LIGHT AT THE END OF THE INTESTINE. I AM SO CLOSE. I AM SO CLOSE.

RE-READ YOUR MISSION STATEMENT! BEG THE FOUNDATION ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR THE ABSOLUTION YOU ILL DESERVE!\n\n\nNaismith:\n And after much deliberation, that Ethics Committee has determined that removing you from the squalor you crave would be a simple revocation of a non-essential privilege.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nMADNESS! ACTION WITHOUT PURPOSE! \nHRRRRNNNGHH!\n PLATONIC MASTURBATION! WHAT HAVE YOU TO GAIN?! WHAT HAVE I TO OFFER?!\n\n\nNaismith:\n You have plenty to offer in the way of information.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nCEASE YOUR FLATTERY! A SAGE CHAMBERPOT YET EXISTS FOR A SINGLE PURPOSE.\n\n\n(Naismith pulls up the documentation for SCP-8802.)\n\n\nNaismith:\n For starters, I'll need you to tell me everything you know about Oscar the Grouch\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscp8802.rtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
