Test subjects assigned to SCP-4552 have authorization for access, but must notify the Site Director before accessing SCP-4552 and must record all activity related to it.\n\n\nCivilians visiting the area are permitted to take pictures of the site, but trespassing of the chain-link fence is strictly prohibited.\n\n\nNo imagery of the Foundation is to be kept on site, as the public may take note of the Foundation\u2019s existence. All personnel assigned to SCP-4552 must be wearing an official Irish Army uniform as opposed to the standard Security Officer uniform.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4552 is the remains of a sandstone castle located around 12 kilometers west of Dingle, County Kerry, Ireland. The site is officially recognised as \u201cMinard Castle\u201d by the Republic of Ireland. The ruins consist of a rectangular tower house, constructed from roughly dressed sandstone blocks secured by a strong adhesive. All four corners of the castle's base were blown off during a siege led by Oliver Cromwell, former Lord Protector of the British Commonwealth. All occupants of the castle were either killed or forced to retreat, leaving the site in a state of disrepair.\n\n\nThe lives of those that inhabited the castle remain mostly undiscovered to the Foundation and local historical societies, other than four diary entries (SCP-4552-01 through SCP-4552-04) written by a domestic servant who had previously helped maintain the premises (See Addendum 4552.1).\n\n\nAny personnel who enters the tower house of SCP-4552 will begin to hallucinate a dense fog, cutting them off from the outside world. The voice of a deceased loved one will then call out to them, often attempting to apologise or comfort the subject (If the subject hasn't lost an acquaintance in the course of their lifetime, no hallucination will occur). A vision of the loved one will approach the subject, often placing a hand on their shoulder or embracing them. The individual can interact with and speak to the vision for approximately 1 minute, after which the vision and fog will fade. Before the hallucination ends, it has always delivered the following verse:\n\n\n\n\nAllies have come and gone.\n\n\nSome leave with or without choice,\n\n\nOthers remain in the world behind me.\n\n\nWe are the same.\n\n\nToo mournful of the past,\n\n\nToo terrified of the future.\n\n\nWelcome to my sandstone Hell.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n These hallucinations will not activate if two or more personnel enter SCP-4552 at a time. Additionally, those who do not enter the tower house are unable to see or hear the hallucinations, but can still hear the subject within SCP-4552.\n\n\nAddendum 4552.01:\n The following diary entries were recovered from within SCP-4552, found in a partially rotted chest within the castle's cellar. They have been translated from a form of Munster Irish to English.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4552-01\u00a0(Request\u00a0Permission)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday was exhausting.\n\n\nSomething appeared to be on Master\u2019s mind. He seemed\u2026 Distressed? Jumpy? The Mistress was summoned by her parents recently, but she\u2019ll be back by tomorrow evening, right?\n\n\nApparently Master had requested the number of guards be doubled (or at least, that\u2019s what Leonard told me). I\u2019ll be damned if anyone here besides Master knew why. Golly, so much seemed off today; I hardly know what to write about!\n\n\nI\u2019ve also been wanting to get back into poetry for quite some time now. I was planning on writing some this evening, but supper had taken quite a bit more time than I was expecting. A shame\u2026 I\u2019ve had puffins on my mind all day. So carefree, so happy, so filled with life and joy for their brothers and sisters\u2026 quite a good subject for a poem if you ask me.\n\n\nI envy puffins.\n\n\n~Aurnia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4552-02\u00a0(Request\u00a0Permission)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's the day!\n\n\nI\u2019ve been meaning to tell Leonard how I\u2019ve felt about him for awhile now.

Imagine our cute little garden, growing the finest herbs in all of Munster! What a happy day that will be; two puffins raising their happy little chicks.\n\n\nThe Mistress returned home today, but Master still seemed so on edge. I don\u2019t have time to worry about them, I\u2019m much too happy to bury myself in his attitude.\n\n\nFrom the burrow you rise,\n\n\nDressed in the black of desire\n\n\nDressed in the white of innocence.\n\n\nYour beak is your mighty sword that will free us both\n\n\nFrom this sandstone Hell.\n\n\n~Aurnia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4552-03\u00a0(Request\u00a0Permission)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah?\n\n\nHannah, of all people?\n\n\nI didn\u2019t find her much too interesting when I started my life here, but really?\n\n\nFunny, I suppose\u2026 Hannah was supposed to be our kid\u2019s name.\n\n\nWhy must you take everything from me?\n\n\n~Aurnia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-4552-04\u00a0(Request\u00a0Permission)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been told that Lord Cromwell\u2019s Army is on their way, and that everyone on the estate must hold their ground.\n\n\nHannah is gone.

In each test, a D-Class personnel who had lost at least one acquaintance during their lifetime was told to enter SCP-4552 and report any encounters with hallucinations.
