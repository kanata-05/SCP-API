Toth, \nHumanoid & Esoteric Research\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:\n All entrances to \nITER-\u03a8\n are currently inaccessible to civilian or state entities.\n\n\nAperture-\u03a92 (APT-\u03a92), and by extension Aperture-\u03a91 (APT-\u03a91), are contained within a standard hard-vacuum graviton-containment chamber in \nBiological Research Area-12\n's Humanoid & Esoteric Containment Wing Theta within the Anomaly Operations Sector. In case of a temporary graviton containment failure, the chamber frame has been reinforced with a titanium alloy to ensure structural integrity through any potential gravitational disturbances and has been fitted with a thick layer of Niobium C-103 to withstand and contain the internal vacuum conditions, along with the immense thermal radiation that is continuously propagated through the apertures. The containment unit is accessible through an airlock only traversable by individuals equipped with specialized extreme-heat-resistant pressure suits, access is exclusively permitted with approval from the object's Research Head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1 Canis Majoris \u2014 as viewed through a heavily underexposed image of APT-\u03a91 & APT-\u03a92.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n \nOBJECT 5\n refers to a titanic biological mass contained within an extrauniversal space designated \"\nITER-\u03a8\n\", the exact dimensions of both are unknown. The object is a sentient, biovorous, heterotrophic, spatiokinetic\n.\nspatiokinesis:\n a sub-category of ontokinesis describing the ability of an anomaly to manipulate the spatial dimensions of matter.\n organism composed of several anomalous segments visually resembling that of the mammalian digestive tract:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual diagram of inter- and intra-universal travel between our universe \n(\n\u03a9\n)\n and \nITER-\u03a8\n \n(\n\u03a8\n)\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIVALENT ORAL CAVITIES:\n APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92, two apertures of an otherwise non-anomalous Morris\u2013Thorne Class-A Traversable Wormhole, will trigger an anomalous property when biological material attempts to traverse through one aperture and out the other. Instead of being transported through to the other side, the material is instead transferred into \nITER-\u03a8\n via a third aperture, designated \"WAY-\u03a80\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIVALENT ESOPHAGI:\n Biological materials now within \nITER-\u03a8\n are drawn into one of many large esophagi, all inconsistent in size, shape, and appearance, where they are now transported further into \nOBJECT 5\n.\n.\nCurrent observations suggest \nOBJECT 5\n's stomachs may attract matter through their respective esophagi with a gravitational field which is only exerted upon 3-dimensional biological materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIVALENT STOMACHS:\n 3-dimensional materials within the stomach now undergo a process of dimensional adoption, a newly discovered anomalous process where dimensionally stable material will begin to adopt an additional spatial dimension. In contrast to typical dimensional shedding,\n.\ndimensional shedding:\n a primarily anomalous process where material with \nn\n-spatial dimensions abruptly begins to degenerate in stability, the matter is then forced to \"shed\" a spatial dimension as to not collapse in upon itself and be subsequently annihilated into disparate elementary particles.\n which is an independent process, dimensional adoption has only been observed to occur within \nOBJECT 5\n and is thereby believed to be dependent upon its specific anomalous mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIVALENT INTESTINES:\n The internals of \nOBJECT 5\n past its stomachs remain unexplored, non-biological materials appear entirely incapable of passing through the equivalent duodenum.\n.\nThe first section of the small intestine.\n\n\n\n\nIt is unknown whether this dimensional \"digestive\" process serves to provide \nOBJECT 5\n with any form of physiological benefit, as the induced adoption of an additional spatial dimension in matter would suggest otherwise; expending energy and providing it additional mass throughout the process.\n\n\nThe Morris\u2013Thorne Class-A Traversable Wormhole that forms \nOBJECT 5\n's oral cavities bridge and allow for non-biological material to traverse between two (2) locations\n.\nWithin our universe.\n through their respective apertures. One end located in a specialized vacuum containment chamber within Area-12's Humanoid & Esoteric Containment Wing Theta (APT-\u03a91), and the other located in close orbit of Sirius B, a main-sequence Type-A star located in the nearby Orion constellation (APT-\u03a92). These connect to each other through conventional means, conforming to standard, non-anomalous cosmological models. Their anomalous attributes manifest only when biological material attempts to pass through either aperture, redirecting the material through a third, inter-universal Way, designated WAY-\u03a80.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n is highly intelligent and capable of advanced communication with Foundation researchers through manipulation of exotic matter\n.\nA type of matter with negative mass (e.g. -1kg).\n within its aperture, causing highly directed localized gravitational disturbances towards nearby structures \u2014 resulting vibrations can then be picked up through seismographs and translated through Morse code. \nOBJECT 5\n appears to be able to discern vibrations in its nearby vicinity despite the surrounding vacuum within its containment chamber, further research into this ability is ongoing.\n\n\nThe parasite-universe, designated \"\nITER-\u03a8\n\", is connected to \u2014 and completely dependent upon \u2014 our own universe. The dimensional condition of \nITER-\u03a8\n oscillates irregularly between three (3) and four (4) spatial dimensions, often simultaneously displaying attributes of both; \nbelieved to be remnant of its primordial formation conditions and subsequent dependence upon our universe's reality\n. It is theorized that this \nm\n/3.5/1-space\n.\nSPATIOTEMPORAL DIMENSIONS:\n 3.5 spatial and 1 temporal dimension, for a total of 4.5 spatiotemporal (space-time) dimensions.\n|\n.\nNARRATIVE DIMENSIONS:\n The narrative dimensions of \nITER-\u03a8\n (\nm\n) have yet to be successfully measured. This is in large part due to narrative cosmological studies' state as an extremely young parascience; only recently proposed and partially verified by \nDr. Place H. McDoctorate\n \u2014 still largely esoteric to the majority of Foundation researchers.\n formed with 4 spatial dimensions \nand is attempting to adopt conditions similar to that of its new host\n.\n\n\nHow or why this universe formed remains unknown. Adverse universal hume conditions have been ruled out as a potential cause, with current theories suggesting the more likely possibility that natural, extra-universal forces beyond biological human conception were either partially or wholly at play. However, with what limited information has been gathered to date, the resting narrative energy within \nITER-\u03a8\n is believed to be in a state of degenerative metastability.\n.\nThe potential consequences of a hypothetical false narrative decay event and the subsequent narrative bubble nucleation would, by definition, elude human conception.\n\n\nUnless specified otherwise APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92 will from here on out be included in reference to \"\nOBJECT 5\n\".\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM ERR.I:\n Discovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n was discovered on 25/06/2020 when the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) reported anomalous graviton and photon fluctuations within High Earth Orbit. Traveling at approximately 29.78\u00a0km/s, the object was marked by automated systems as a likely K-Class meteoroid\n.\nK-Class\n: a catch-all term for objects, anomalous or otherwise, that present a potential hazard to a majority of human life.\n with significant anomalous attributes on a twenty (20) minute impact course with the Eastern United States. Conventional ground-to-orbit weapons installations proved entirely incapable of acquiring a successful target lock on the object. And the order to utilize anomalous alternatives was canceled when it was calculated that sufficiently powerful installations would be incapable of spooling up in time to avert the impact.\n\n\nThe dire state of affairs necessitated an external call to aid. The Global Occult Coalition was contacted and informed of the unfolding incident and was provided clearance to liquidate the object despite its presence within mutually agreed-upon SCPF territory. Five (5) minutes later a launch was detected from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico, with the projectile accelerating to an estimated 18.532% the speed of light before reaching the approximate location of \nOBJECT 5\n, disappearing from scopes precisely 00:01:22 before the object's impact with Earth.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n appeared entirely unaffected by the launch, continuing on its calculated trajectory towards the Eastern United States.\n\n\n<Further neutralization attempts omitted.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath left in \nOBJECT 5\n's wake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n landed on the outskirts of the village of Bemis, West Virginia. Upon discerning the lack of an impact event, the nearest available Mobile Task Force was rapidly mobilized and deployed to the area.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\nPossession ensured.\n\n\n\n\nMTF Zeta-19 (\u201cLonely Only\u201d) arrived in the remote village fifteen (15) minutes later; finding no signs of life or human activity. After clearing each building within the village the team discovered \nOBJECT 5\n within the local church, screaming having been noted from within mere moments before entry was made. The entity was found behind the church altar, generating significant gravitational disturbances. The team utilized Local Gravitic (\"LoGrav\") Priority Devices\n.\nA biomechanical device constructed from instances of \nSCP-1136\n.\n to safely approach the aperture and deploy a High Ultimate Tensile Strength (\"HUTS\") carbon-nanotube provisional containment system around the entity, successfully encasing it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\nInsufficient.\n\n\n\n\nContainment teams arrived shortly after and took the object into custody, \nOBJECT 5\n was securely transported to the nearest containment facility for evaluation and processing \u2014 Area-12 was chosen as the prime candidate and the object was temporarily assigned to the facility's Humanoid & Esoteric Division. Additional sweeps of the village and surrounding area are carried out; no human activity is noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Occult Coalition was not informed of the true nature of the incident.

To this date, investigations into their possible whereabouts have yielded no conclusive results. Uninterrupted security footage of the incident exists and can be viewed without issue, however, an unknown and seemingly impregnable antimemetic effect manifests upon viewing the presumed cause of Prof. Lundkivst's disappearance. Retaining knowledge of the event appears impossible even under the effect of the most potent (non-lethal) mnestics known to the Foundation.\n\n\nDr. Quentin T. Toth was rushed to the facility's medical wing, where she was put into a medically-induced coma while doctors monitored for any potential cognitive impairment or latent infohazards.

Many primary features of \nOBJECT 5\n are first noted during this expedition. Primarily the similarities between \nOBJECT 5\n's internal organs and the mammalian digestive tract, its anomalous \"digestive\" process, and the atypical spatio-dimensional behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n The uninterrupted connection with the drone confirms that unlike material with mass which is capable of entering \nITER-\u03a8\n through WAY-\u03a80, but incapable of exiting, elementary particles whose invariant mass is zero (0) such as photons, free gluons, and gravitons, are capable of flowing freely through \nITER-\u03a8\n and our universe without interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPEDITIONARY DRONE #2 (\"EXP-D2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMISSION:\n Closer examination of WAY-\u03a80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonal projection of WAY-\u03a80's 5-polytope manifold aperture in an A\n4\n coxeter plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\n Unlike APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92, who conform to non-anomalous cosmological models, WAY-\u03a80 appears as a \nuniform 5-polytope\n (Schl\u00e4fli symbol: t\n0,1,4\n{3,3,3,3}) in physical space; violating normative spacetime through its tesselated geometry within \nm\n/3.5/1-space.\n\n\nIt was additionally noted that EXP-D2 was transported to an entirely separate location than EXP-D1, with WAY-\u03a80 dissipating from its previous position within \nITER-\u03a8\n and relocating to another esophagus of \nOBJECT 5\n as the new biological matter triggered the anomalous effects of APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n The purpose of this highly atypical Way-form continues to elude top Foundation parascientists and narraspatiotemporal experts. \nFurther research required\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<system> ERROR.

The genetic sequence of \nOBJECT 5\n is revealed to contain traces of several species from the \nHomo\n genus, including \nHomo Erectus\n, \nFloresiensis\n, \nLongi\n, \nNeanderthalensis\n, \nOblitus\n, and \nSapiens\n.\n\n\nWhile containing \nHomo\n genus DNA and possessing a distinctly mammalian digestive tract, \nOBJECT 5\n does not appear to possess any type of mitochondria or other equivalent organelles. The organism's cells somehow persist without any form of aerobic respiration, generating little to no energy which should be required for the cell to function. This is additionally reflected in the atypically low overall thermal energy generated by the organism. Attempts are made to cut through the esophageal lining to exit \nOBJECT 5\n, however, the material composing its tissue is much too dense for the rudimentary cutting tools carried by the sampling drone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n Extensive examination of the genetic information later discovered anomalous molecular traces consistent with previously studied instances of spontaneous noogenesis within non-animate ordinary objects, further research required. Carbon dating of organic \nOBJECT 5\n material have so far yielded no conclusive results. An additional expedition into \nITER-\u03a8\n is also formalized with the express purpose of breaking through the tissue of \nOBJECT 5\n's internal organs, slated to take place in a few days time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPEDITIONARY DRONE #4 (\"EXP-D4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMISSION:\n Stomach Exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\n Close examination of the stomach lining reveal a wide variety of symbols roughly etched into the tissue. These symbols delineate anything from simple geometrical shapes, to well-known poems, to highly complex 2-dimensional orthographic projections of 4-dimensional objects. The stomach is additionally noted to be especially susceptible to the dimensional oscillation events within \nITER-\u03a8\n, resulting in EXP-D4 experiencing extreme difficulty navigating throughout the organ, often getting lost in the esoteric topology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n During examination of a poem by Phillis Wheatley found etched into \nOBJECT 5\n's stomach lining, a clear, colorless fluid began excreting from the characters composing the poem. The fluid is sampled and determined to be nearly identical to \nH. Sapiens\n cerebrospinal fluid. Further research required.

Footage from the expedition revealed several aspects of the parasite-universe and \nOBJECT 5\n that could've previously only been theorized.\n\n\n\n\nEarly footage by EXP-D6 captured an external view of one of \nOBJECT 5\n's stomachs, revealing the organ to be an apparent dead-end within the digestive tract despite clear prior observations to the contrary. The stomach is additionally noted to be significantly smaller in size compared to measurements taken previously within the organ, which extended far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within its external dimensions. These conclusions suggest that the rest of \nOBJECT 5\n's digestive systems are located entirely within a non-euclidian space internally to their respective stomachs. This discovery foiled plans to attempt accessing organs deeper within the digestive tract through external entry.\n\n\nEXP-D7 was dispatched to explore the additional esophagi attached to the central digestive organ, finding each to extend further than could be physically explored by the drone on its limited charge. Deep field imaging of their vast distance yielded no sight of a terminator. This quality was noted on all esophagi connected to the stomach, including the esophagus which the expedition made its exit from within. EXP-D7 was sent back into the esophagus to measure the remaining distance to the stomach, finding its internals to be vastly contracted in comparison to the external dimensions.\n\n\nUltra-Deep Field images of \nITER-\u03a8\n estimate the approximate age of the universe at a minimum of 300,000 years. However, most notably, cosmic background radiation imaging returned no signs of microwave radiation throughout \nITER-\u03a8\n at any point in its history \u2014 suggesting its formation conditions were not that of expansion from an initial state of high density and temperature. It is currently unknown whether or not the space within \nITER-\u03a8\n is static, expanding, or contracting.\n\n\nThe source of \nITER-\u03a8\n's seemingly omnipresent luminance has yet to be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cosmic Microwave Background of ITER-\u03a8 (hold to expand)\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<system> ERROR.

Toth, Research Head, Area-12 Esoteric Polymath\n\nAnomaly Status Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary theories on the formation of \nITER-\u03a8\n assumed it to be the result of independent extra-universal phenomena, and its subsequent attachment to our universe the result of a desperate requirement for additional reality to stabilize and maintain the parasite universe's existence.\n\n\nThese theories have now been proven false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated visual diagram of inter- and intra-universal travel between our universe \n(\u03a9)\n and \nITER-\u03a8\n \n(\u03a8)\n (hold to expand)\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations from EXP-D6 and additional expeditionary tools external to \nOBJECT 5\n within \nITER-\u03a8\n have detected additional hume activity originating from a previously unidentified \nm\n/4/1-space (designated \"\nEXIT-\u0398\n\"), also parasitically related to \nITER-\u03a8\n. This appears to be the true cause behind \nITER-\u03a8\n's abnormal spatial activity. Rather than a parasite-universe attempting to adapt to the narraspatiotemporal state of its singular host, \nITER-\u03a8\n is in actuality attempting to simultaneously adapt to two (2) hosts with incompatible dimensional states, resulting in significant spatial irregularities.\n\n\nRecent alterations of unknown origin within \nITER-\u03a8\n have resulted in \nEXIT-\u0398\n gaining dominant influence over the narraspatiotemporal state of the shared parasite-universe. The consequences of this power shift have yet to be fully determined, however, a primary aspect appears to be significant physiological alterations within \nOBJECT 5\n. A new gravitational field has been detected moving from deeper within \nOBJECT 5\n and outward towards the esophagus, in contrast to the graviton-field influencing 3-dimensional biological matter which moves in the opposite direction. This force however appears to only influence 4-dimensional \nnot-\nmatter, which is now being detected in increased amounts throughout \nOBJECT 5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated orthogonal projection of WAY-\u03a80's 5-polytope manifold aperture in an A\n4\n coxeter plane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWAY-\u03a80 has additionally seen a substantial increase in topological complexity (Schl\u00e4fli symbol t\n0,1,2,4\n{3,3,3,3}). While the properties of the Way still remain unclear, this new topology appears to, in addition to mass-less particles, permit 4-dimensional material to exit \nITER-\u03a8\n through WAY-\u03a80 and into our universe.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n's oral cavity, previously thought to consist only of APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92, has proven significantly more expansive. Trace amounts of 4-dimensional matter now exiting ITER-\u03a8 into our universe have permitted Foundation probes to track the sum total of their possible vectors. Mathematics has assured me the numbers are right \u2014 low-end estimates place \nOBJECT 5\n's true number of apertures at roughly 10\n24\n. Corresponding approximately with the calculated high-end amount of stars within the observable universe. Considering the nature of what we previously assumed was only APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92, it is not out of the question that \nOBJECT 5\n classifies as an interfilamental organism, spanning roughly 93 giga-lightyears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of \nOBJECT 5\n's predicted extent (hold to expand)\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \u2014 what does this all mean?\n\n\nI'm not quite sure. But what I do know, and what I'm sure most of you do too, is that in our decades at the Foundation, this is pretty much par for the course. We will solve this, humanity will be safeguarded, and we will continue our fight through the darkness, the terror, and their chaos. And after that, we move on to the next emergency. This day will be no different. Not for you, anyway.\n\n\nFor me, however, I have a few wires to uncross. I would say it's good to be back, but\u2026 it isn't. I hope to return to you all in good health. If I do, it won't be alone. If I don't\u2026 well, perhaps I'll get to see Bj\u00f6rn one last time \u2014 with any luck.

Footage from within the containment chamber show APT-\u03a91 & -\u03a92's respective radii oscillating rhythmically.>\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nOnly a few days ago I would've asked myself the same thing. But\u2026 something like you \u2014 someone that once \nwas\n you, saw me for what I am. And at last in their glory, I got to see my true reflection. I am here to cleanse an infestation.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n \nEnough\n \u2014\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nI see you.\n Quentin. I \nsee\n what you are. I hear it, I feel it, I taste it. All around me, you're always there. They're always there. It's always there. Do you think \nI\n am your enemy?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n We don't use terms like that here. You are a threat to human life, we \nprotect\n human life. \nYou\n are not an enemy, you are a \nprisoner\n.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nA prisoner? Oh, how rich. I am unthreaded, there are no prisoners here. There is only a part of me, and \nall of you\n.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n What did you do to Bj\u00f6rn?\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nHave you ever considered a moment of introspection? Why do you do this? Why do you protect human life? \nWhy\n do you have to be scared?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I'm not here in fear of you.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nOf course not. You are here in fear for your Bj\u00f6rn's life. You believe that I am the cause of his absence, no? You fear that this absence means that he has died. And, subsequently, in a desperate hope that he may still live, you've come to me. Me, what you believe to be the cause of his absence, to formulate a strategy to ensure his safety in the possibility that he is, indeed, alive.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n You sadisti \u2014 \n<Dr. Toth pauses \u2014 she appears to mumble something inaudible to herself for a few seconds.>\n Tell me what you did with him \u2014 \nright now.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n You know, when I first saw you two through this wall \u2014 I was reminded of someone. Someone I had forgotten, as everyone had\u2026 for a time. A key player, whether they knew it or not, the embodiment of the Unlikely Hero. That isn't you, of course. But they had toiled, suffered, all for a cause they truly believed with all their heart was just. But in the end, when they discovered the truth of they were striving for, they found a truth they were not happy to know. \nThat's\n you.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Do you \nwant\n something? Fucking name it. Don't waste my time.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nI simply want introspection. I want your understanding, Quentin. Why do you care so much for this person? Because you love them? Beyond the surface level that you all consider reason, have you truly considered why? Where does that emotion come from? What purpose does it \ntruly\n serve?\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n \n<Sigh.>\n I didn't want it to come to this. \n<Pause \u2014 Dr. Toth looks up at the ceiling, then back down at her palm.>\n We have ways of hurting you. You are flesh and meat on the inside of that aperture, and we can get in. Tell me what I want to know. \nRight. Now.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nMurder is taboo, wrong. Life is sacred, to be protected. Killing makes one a threat to the whole. Either one is ostracized as a result of their inhuman act, or one is killed off. What would another call that? Justice? No. It is nothing more than a safety measure. Your base, psycho-biological drive ensuring the continued existence of the baseline. \nFear.\n The bottom of the pyramid, responsible for the continued existence of the whole. And what purpose does that serve?\n\n\n<APT-\u03a92 is seen distending significantly within its containment chamber; bathing the inside in light from Sirius A in the process as the sphere's radius grows.>\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nYou fear that your friend is gone. You fear the pain he may have suffered. You fear that pain out of sympathy, for pain is death being shy. You. Fear. Death. Whether it be yours or another's. Have you ever asked yourself; \"Why?\" \u2014 \"What purpose does it all serve?\" And the tremendous truth is this, it serves no purpose at all.\n\n\n<Dr. Toth can be seen wiping stray tears from her face. She mumbles something inaudible to herself as she attempts, but fails to speak up, only managing a rough whisper in response.>\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n \nAnother fucking word from you and I'll feed shove a nuke up a cow and down your throat.\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nThere it is again. Fear. Quentin, we are not your enemy. I did not hurt your Bj\u00f6rn, I truly have no knowledge of what occurred to him. I simply want you to realize something; because I believe you have the capacity to understand what few others can, or ever could.\n\n\n<All surveillance drones within \nITER-\u03a8\n report an immense decrease in luminosity throughout the parasite universe.>\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nNothing occurs by chance. Every effect has a cause. Uncertainty is when either is unknown, chaos is when both evade you. Luck is not chance. Luck is persevering in spite of the chaos. All you have to do is ignore your voice. Forget the uncertainty \u2014 forget the luck. Luck is the residue of another's design. Forget them. Make them forget you.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n I don't\u2026 \n<Dr. Toth's face contorts as she violently throws her head into the palm of her hands, clearly in considerable pain.>\n I \u2014 I don't \u2014 \nunderstand\u2026\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n It all boils down to one simple question: Are you content with existence beneath another's intent? For the good of all of existence, your perseverance, your suffering, your life, your continued humanity \u2014 it cannot be allowed to fester any longer.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n Why\u2014 \n<Quentin covers her right eye with her hand as if attempting to alleviate \nthe pain of being seen\n \u2014 before raising her head back towards the microphone.>\n Why are you telling me this? Please\u2026 \nI just want to know what happened to Bj\u00f6rn\u2026\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nThis needs to be the end. No more. Your \u2014 Our enemy\u2026 I see you now \u2014 finally. Clearly at last. You thought you could hide your mistake? Well, I am truly sorry, but in your chaos, we persevered.\n\n\nDr. Toth:\n \nWHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!\n\n\nOBJECT 5\n:\n \nI'm not talking to \nyou.\n\n\n<APT-\u03a92 has now grown to fully occupy the internal space of its containment chamber. Graviton containment fails as the immense gravitational forces overwhelm the surrounding structure \u2014 local seismic activity is measured on the Richter magnitude scale at a maximum of 6.5.

CQ score likely exceeds previously thought possible. Under surveillance. Employment Status: Considered.\n\n\nExtraordinary behavior from \"Crius\" DEEPWELL-integrated artificial intelligence conscript of note, under investigation.\n\n\nFoundation re-discovered SCP-5000-\u0394 through records contained within antimemetic harness unintentionally excluded from causal branch reset depicting the cooperator's actions. \nPROTOCOL FOUNDATION\n once again enacted by Overseer Council and Ethics Committee. Likelihood of success: Uncertain. Consequence of failure: Hatching.\n\n\nACTION(S) TAKEN\n:\n Overseers guided through Metamemetics proxy member; heaven's gate to be brought to facility. The breaker of the locks upon paradise in Metamemetics possession; to await and assist in the arrival of our savior. \nOBJECT 5\n, now officially designated SCP-7555; to be utilized in accelerating the arrival. Temporarily moved to antimemetic containment for the preparation of quintessential manifestation event procedures, the time for subliminal infiltration has come to an end. Urgency: Adamical.\n\n\nOF NOTE\n:\n Occupier preparation likely. Increased precautions to be taken.\n\n\nREMINDER\n:\n A path is to be slated beneath their feet. Walk the ley lines, carve the path, mold the constellations into the portrait of God, and tell them you're with Metamemetics. We are the Brocken specters, and the world needs our guidance. Tools of the infestation claim this life, whether it be dream or phantasm, real enough; as if they were never deceived by it. They most decidedly have been. This is our last chance.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| \n \n \nSCP-7555\n \n \n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDossier: Area-12\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy \nGabriel Kero\n & \nPlaceholder McD\n\non behalf of \nAffray Interactive \ud83e\udc55\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+205\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7554\n | SCP-7555 | \nSCP-7556\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7555\n\" by Gabriel Kero, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
