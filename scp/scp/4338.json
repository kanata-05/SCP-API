Image taken during EVENT DN-4338-33, 09/04/1974.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n 6 FHT Class Security Frigates, along with Aquatic Research Vessel \nHerron\n will maintain a seven-point blockade around Moaha Island.\n1\n At the beginning of each lunar month\n2\n, a varied assortment of food must be deposited into this island's volcanic crater, including:\n\n\n\n\n40-50kg vegetables (e.g., cassava, taro, sweet potato, purple yam).\n\n\n30-40kg fruits (e.g., mango, pineapple, cherimoya, jackfruit).\n\n\n50-80kg fish (e.g., tuna, salmon, marlin, dorado).\n\n\n40-80kg assorted nuts, herbs, and seaweed.\n\n\n60-80kg pork, shredded/smoked.\n\n\n\n\nThese provisions, based on the staple foods of a Pacific/Oceanian native society, have a 78-83% chance of being accepted by SCP-4338. Should a deposit be rejected, the appointed \"leader\" should proceed to an isolated location to avoid destruction of Foundation property and additional loss of life. For more details, see \"4338-DN Event Overview\" below.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating, 2.3km\n3\n sphere of volcanic rock inhabiting the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral traditions reference this entity as \"\u014csobiue\", \"Irn'acha\", or \"God of the Burning Ocean\": a central figure in the creation myths \u2014 and extinction events \u2014 of some 19 early oceanic cultures.\n\n\n\n\n4338-DN\u00a0Event\u00a0Overview\n\n\n\n\n4338-DN\u00a0Event\u00a0Overview\n\n\n\n\nA 4338-DN Event, also known as a \"rejected offering\" event, will be signaled by a large-scale eruption of Moaha Volcano. Soon after, SCP-4338 will emerge from the magma conduit, travelling towards the leader of the closest human social group. SCP-4338 is acutely aware of group hierarchy; use of D-class personnel as decoy leaders has proven ineffective. While in transit, SCP-4338's exterior shell will fracture and dislodge large tendrils of molten rock and metal ore. These appendages are used mainly for demolishing obstacles encountered in SCP-4338's pursuit, which will not stop until either:\n\n\n(A)\n 3-5 live, healthy persons are dropped into the volcanic crater\n3\n or\n\n\n(B)\n the \"leader\" is dead.\n\n\nCause of death is inconsequential, but typically occurs when SCP-4338 ensnares its pursuant in one of its tendrils. SCP-4338 will then absorb this individual's corpse into its core body, and withdraw. Within 20 minutes, a mote of lava will fall from SCP-4338 containing a duplicate of the deceased. While visually identical, this duplicate will be fully inorganic, and contain a core of animated, super-heated minerals. Once this process is complete, any previous proxy will collapse into shards of volcanic glass. These entities act as a consciousness vessel and communication vehicle for SCP-4338, who will only converse with the next \"leader\" once they have formally declared themselves.\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a009/03/2018\u00a0|\u00a04338-DN-41\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a009/03/2018\u00a0|\u00a04338-DN-41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENT DN-4338-41. Still taken from the body cam of Security Officer Masters, deceased.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time in its 73 years of containment, SCP-4338 emerged halfway through the lunar month. Current \"leader\", Director Morgan Rowell, was already on the island collecting soil samples at the time. Including Director Rowell, 3 Foundation personnel were lost during this event.\n\n\nA proxy emerged only 14 minutes later. In another unprecedented act, Rowell / SCP-4338 were the ones to open communications, demanding to speak to a new \"leader\" without delay. Given the need for expediency, Head Researcher Amelia Thornborrow volunteered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log\u00a009/03/2018\u00a0|\u00a0Morgan\u00a0Rowell\u00a0/\u00a0SCP-4338\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a0Morgan\u00a0Rowell\u00a0/\u00a0SCP-4338\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n (Acting) Director Amelia Thornborrow.\n\n\nForeword:\n Rowell / SCP-4338 immediately began presenting the trademark \"cracking\" appearance past proxies have only shown after 4-8 months.

As per protocol, Ms. Rowell was restrained with 8cm thick tungsten cuffs around the wrist and ankles.\n\n\n\n\nThornborrow:\n Tell me why you attacked us.\n\n\nRowell / 4338:\n SUCH IMPUDENCE.
