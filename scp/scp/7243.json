The dictionary only records our definitions. Even that term is misleading, \"the dictionary,\" as though there were only one. Merriam-Webster probably says that waste (noun) is nothing but a useless byproduct of something better. Accurate so far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough. That's our fault. The worst kind of waste they're aware of is spent nuclear fuel, or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Their definition was written without having borne witness to the irreducible Nascimbenium cores powering innumerable impossible mad science projects, or the infernal combustion engines punching holes in the no\u00f6zone layer with their demonosulfuric emissions. That's the kind of waste \nour\n dictionary takes into account. Metal that absorbs psychic signals and grows like cancer. Balls of backward-flowing time. Orichalcum, adamant and ectoplasm. The Colostomy from Out of Space. An endless catalogue of Anomalous fallout and excreta which only we can ameliorate, because only we can see it, because we set the world up that way.\n\n\nBut we're getting tired of seeing it. After all this time, this endless uphill landfill-slog, we need to see clear blue sky beyond our horizon of trash.\n\n\nIf only putting the waste out of mind could also put it out of sight. One might be forgiven for wishing that the very concept could be erased from our manifest of magic, as the gutters overflow with Anomalous ooze and the grey goo projections turn perilously proximal. One might be forgiven for wishing that the dictionary truly did define, and that by changing the definition of waste, we could change the very thing itself.\n\n\nBut forgiveness is never guaranteed. That's what gives it meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndated photograph from the files of Dr. Dougall Deering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT REPORT AAFD-I-2028-37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2028/09/08\n\n\nFOREWORD:\n Minor hazardous materials breach. See attached interview transcript.\n\n\nRECORDING OFFICER:\n Dr. Nhung Ngo (Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology, Site-43)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Dougall Deering, Chief of Acroamatic Abatement at Site-43, is sitting across from Dr. Ngo at her desk. His hands are bandaged. He is very still, as he is recovering from heavy sedation. There is a small red plastic box on the desk beside Dr. Ngo's recording device, decorated with the heraldry of a confectionery company. He is staring at it.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n We'll ease you into this.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Okay.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What were you doing in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on September the 8th, 2028?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Supervising a flush.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n And what does that entail?\n\n\n<Dr. Deering's voice is flat and without affect, as though he is reciting from memory.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n AAF-D is the powerhouse of 43's abatement plant. It's the single largest Anomalous waste facility ever constructed. Since the effluence crisis escalated globally, it's been doing non-stop quadruple-duty. Every few years we have to shut it down, for a period not exceeding one hour \u2014 anything longer and the whole system backs up irrecoverably \u2014 and pump the overflow into the anachronic sump below the Site.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Why?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Because output is severely lagging behind input. We're overwhelmed, and we're operating on triage principles. Any substance requiring too much time or too heavy a resource commitment to abate has to be set aside as impractical, because certain other abatements are too time-sensitive to delay. Some of the Anomalous effects of the waste we process can worsen the longer they're kept in the pipeline, and that's not even getting into what it does to the pipes themselves. When we perform the flush, they're often already white-hot, or ice cold, or humming obscenities in Latin. It's always a close call, because we can't afford to do it more regularly. Not on our schedule.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n So this flush resets the equipment to factory?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Not hardly. It just buys us a little more time. The next flush\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering sighs. His tone is becoming strident.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Probably not even a year.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n But you can still pump what you can't abate into the sump, right.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n For now. Not for much longer. It's getting full.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n You can cut to the chase now. I don't\u2026 I don't feel anything anyway.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n You're on a lot of painkillers. That's normal.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Sure.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Who was in charge of the flush this year?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Deputy Chief of Janitorial and Maintenance Ph\u2014 Philip Eugene Deering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy Chief Deering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Your brother.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n My\u2026 yes.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n And you were supervising him?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Yes. No. I was\u2026 visiting him.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Visiting him? You work at the same facility.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Yes. We've been here together for decades, but we haven't been here \ntogether\n at all. I never speak to him. I don't want to get into that, we just\u2026 we aren't close.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What did the two of you talk about?\n\n\n<Dr. Deering nods at the box on the table.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That. I found it in an old box in our parents' house, cleaning out the basement. I thought he'd like to have it. I bought it for him from the general store when we were children.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n May I?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Go on.\n\n\n<Dr. Ngo picks up the toy. It consists of a single sliding compartment. She slides it out, then back in, then back out again. She shrugs.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What does it do?\n\n\n<Dr. Deering smiles faintly.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It makes things disappear.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Put something in it. Your pin, maybe.\n\n\n<Dr. Ngo unclips her Site-43 badge pin and places it inside the compartment. She closes it. She opens it again. The pin is missing. She closes and opens the compartment several more times. The pin is still missing.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n How does it work?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's magic. I'm an occultist, you know.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Did you end up giving it to him?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What happened instead? Take your time.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I'm not as familiar with the layout of F-D as I used to be. They've had to make a lot of changes to keep up with the pressure. There was a valve\u2026\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n On the junction between the\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Ngo checks her notes.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n \u2026orphic and ambichronological outflow pipes. What does that mean?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Two very different types of esoteric effluence in side-by-side conduits. There's a junction connecting them with a series of impregnable stoppers operated by remote control, for combining their contents under specific emergency circumstances. Intermixing in rigorously-controlled amounts to neutralize both in the case of an overflow. The valve is only there to allow manual access during accidents, since it's impossible to do this with the appropriate level of care by hand. It shouldn't have moved just because I bumped into it.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n So why did it? Metal fatigue?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Maybe. Every individual facility is suffering from budget crunch, and the equipment is aging rapidly. But no\u2026 no, I think we were actually in the early stages of a total collapse already, and this was just the first sign. Those pipes were full to bursting, when they should have been almost empty\u2026\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n Are you suggesting they hadn't been flushed properly?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No. I don't\u2026 I can't see how. Look, they're under a lot of pressure, the people who work in AcroAbate. And the materials are unpredictable. There could have been some sort of duplicative reaction. The point is, there was a lot more effluence in the system than expected, and a lot of it's still in there now. It might have come blasting out anyway, even if I hadn't hit the valve.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering sighs.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n But I did, so it happened the way it did. But it didn't make a difference, it definitely didn't really make a difference.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n What happened next?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n The materials mixed inappropriately, and the orphic outflow instantly became every version of itself it had ever been: before, during, and after abatement, simultaneously. It looked like an army of technicolour ghosts all melted together, bursting out of the pipes like steam.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n And then?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n And then Phil\u2026 Deputy Chief Deering, headed for the suction pump controls near the break. Every room and corridor in the entire facility has these controls; all he had to do was turn a single handle and all the emergent phenomena would get sucked into the sinkhole without further incident.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n But that's not what happened.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No. Instead, he was met halfway by some\u2026 \nthing,\n which manifested behind him, between us, away from the ghostflow. Something writhing, ethereal. It sucked up most of the airborne effluence, then crunched itself down to his size\u2026 I could \nhear\n the crunching, and then\u2014\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n You don't have to r\u2014\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \n<shouting>\n And then it moved right through him, overlaid itself on him, coiled around him and started to shrink. And his eyes rolled back, his skin shrivelled in against his bones and split where his organs were, and they burst out of him, and he melted into a pile of\u2026 all over the floor\u2026 and it was gone, and he was\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering heaves ineffectually, hyperventilating for several seconds before recovering.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I don't think he felt it.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n And then you turned the handle yourself.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I don't remember.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n It was captured on camera.\n\n\n<Dr. Ngo gestures at Dr. Deering's hands.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n It's how that happened. The controls were compromised. The ghosts were out too long.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I don't remember.\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n You've been traumatized, of course\u2014\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n If you got it all on camera, why drag me through this again?\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n I needed to hear your version for the report.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n My\u2026? My \nversion\n? What the fuck does that mean?\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n It's just standard procedure, doctor.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Ngo:\n How do I get my pin back?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Shake it to the left. Hard.\n\n\n<Dr. Ngo shakes the box, then opens the compartment. She retrieves her button, and reaffixes it to her jacket.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It was never gone. A slide to the right, and a little mirror to hide the evidence. No magic at all.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering shakes his head.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Just a trick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab END TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD:\n This interview reaffirmed Dr. Deering's testimony in the immediate aftermath of the accident, in which he reported the presence of a rogue entity unrelated to the overflowing materials and responsible for his brother's death. No personnel reviewing the security camera footage of the incident are able to perceive said entity, even under mnestic treatment.\n\n\nOn the recommendation of Dr. Ngo and Chief Torosyan-Deering of Janitorial and Maintenance, Dr. Deering has been prescribed one year's mandatory mental health leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \nSCP-7243\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nthaumiel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nabsentia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nekhi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubclass:\n\n\ng\u00f6del\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus:\n\n\ntruculent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$class-category-3}\n\n\n{$class-text-3}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$class-category-4}\n\n\n{$class-text-4}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X, Site-43.\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASSIGNED DEPARTMENTS\n\n\nPROJECT LEADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParachronology, P.

When these by-products are generated \ncontinuously\n, however, their containment will \neventually\n become infeasible, and so the criteria is met for their disposal.\n\n\nMass containment facilities (particularly those specializing in biological containment) are already equipped with immense infrastructures for disposing of conventional waste. Unfortunately, these systems cannot contend with \nunconventional\n waste, the esoteric properties of which may eventuate any number of unforeseen issues. Each year, innumerable breaches are caused by the reaction of multiple Anomalous substances in spaces they should never have occupied in the first instance \u2014 garbage dumpsters, sewage tanks, ventilation systems and the like. This leaves our most crucial Sites with the issue of storing, transporting, and neutralizing large concentrations of volatile esoteric effluence, on a case-by-case basis, for an arbitrary number of Anomalies, with arbitrary properties, \nad infinitum.\n\n\nThis is the ever-progressing front on which Acroamatic Abatement does battle. It attempts to generalize the problems of safe storage, transport, and amelioration for arbitrary acroamatic waste. These are extremely messy problems to solve, and not just in the practical sense:\n\n\nTheoretically\n, Acroamatic Abatement deals in the development of containment and neutralization techniques for \nall possible\n Anomalous effects, and accounting for their potential interactions with \nall other\n Anomalous effects. At time of writing, no singular inciting element has been identified as the cause to which the entire known range of Anomalous phenomena can be attributed; in the opinion of this acroamaticist, no such element exists. Definitionally, Anomalies subvert generally-accepted models of how reality works, and so their classification is determined by whether they are congruent with our limited human understanding \u2014 there is no \"Swann boson\" (Pickman \net. al,\n 2021) or similar phenomenon that grants a substance the quality of \ndefying expectation.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, impossible to develop a comprehensive technique which can strip any arbitrary substance of its Anomalous properties with certainty, short of developing rigorous scientific explanations for those properties and conveying them pedagogically to the human populace entire. As such, the primary approach of Acroamatic Abatement has been to group esoteric substances into broad classes based on their properties, developing containment and treatment strategies for each class and subclass therein. This classification system is necessarily non-rigorous, and cannot comprehensively describe all acroamatic material (for reasons aforementioned), but a more effective model has yet to be developed.\n\n\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\nEND ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following hard-copy correspondence transpired between Dr. Dougall Deering and Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering prior to the proposal of SCP-7243.\n\n\n\n\n[CHIEF TOROSYAN-DEERING]\n\n\nYou killed my husband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[DR. DEERING]\n\n\nI couldn't save him. If I'd had even one second to react, I would have. I'm sorry the system let him down, let \nyou\n down. I'm sorry we let it decline so far and so fast. At this point we can't even begin to predict how these increasingly volatile materials will interact with each other and our obsolete equipment. The entity which killed Philip could have resulted from any number of vectors; it will never be possible to blame any one in specific. All we can do is rededicate ourselves to the cause he gave his life for, do it better, do it more efficiently, do it right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CHIEF TOROSYAN-DEERING]\n\n\nYou\n killed my husband. \nYou\n. Only you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[DR. DEERING]\n\n\nAmelia, nobody on Earth understands what you lost the way I do, and so I understand if you need someone to blame. I'm in charge of AcroAbate, and whatever happens under that umbrella is on me. That's the job. But we can't lose sight of the fact that what killed Philip was an extreme statistical outlier under nobody's control, a nasty twist of fate that we can't even comprehend, let alone measure or mete out justice to. After all of our efforts, things like that still exist. They're even multiplying. If we dwell on our mistakes, they'll overtake us. We can't give up on our quest to figure out where all of this is coming from, and how to send it back there. If we do, it wins. If it wins, Philip died for nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CHIEF TOROSYAN-DEERING]\n\n\nYou can't even call him your brother. Not even in a \nletter\n. Take responsibility for once in your life, you smug sack of shit!\n\n\nThere never was any \nentity\n. You're the only one who claims to have seen it, and whatever you might believe, you're not that fucking important. You know what Phil told me when I asked if you were coming to his Deputy Chief promo? \"Probably not. He'd be too ashamed.\" And you know what else? He'd internalized that for so long, he didn't even think to be sad about it. It was just the way things were, to him. I think that's when I realized I was going to have to hate you, well before you finally did something to really, truly earn it.\n\n\nYou're incapable of facing up to anything you think reflects poorly on you, so you make up excuses for why you shouldn't have to. Can't attend the ceremony because of a scheduling conflict, not because you can't stand admitting you share DNA with a glorified janitor. Can't come to the wedding because it's even worse seeing more janitor blood seeping into the family. Can't take a break from dissolving parathylene like the single-minded industrious little worm that you are to allow even a single genuine moment of base human connection. Can't admit you bumblefucked into a piece of sensitive equipment because you were too preoccupied with the cleverness of your weak, self-centred peace offering, and killed the only person on the planet who ever had even the tiniest scrap of respect for you.\n\n\nLet me tell you something, Dougall Deering. Philip never reflected poorly on you. \nYou reflect poorly on him\n, perpetual present tense, and to his infinite credit that never crossed his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[DR. DEERING]\n\n\nWhat can I do to make this right? To convince you that I've only ever been trying to help? I gave my life to this project. I'd do anything to see it through. Tell me! You think I don't respect you? You're the best sanitation engineer in a facility full of certified geniuses.

I understand that you're dividing your energies between a great many projects right now, and you think my requests are a distraction. I'm telling you this from a position of absolute expertise and certainty: you want to be involved in this. You've left me on read because you know that your time is at a premium. I'm telling you that you don't know the half of it.\n\n\nYour\n \ntime\n \nis\n \nshort\n.\n\n\nWe can't ignore the AcroAbate problem anymore, or it's going to be our species' meteor strike. I'm the only one with the drive to deflect this thing hanging over our heads. You're trying to save the world for the third, fourth, fifth time? I have just one question for you.\n\n\nAre you content with it being your last?\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 DD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Deering,\n\n\nLet's talk.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 PHMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAF-X, overhead schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7243 is the \nDeering-Placeholder Latent Existential Abatement\n (DePLExA) \nEngine\n, an advanced industrial eigenmachine designed for comprehensive mass disposal of generalized esoteric waste. It is housed within Acroamatic Abatement Facility \nExactus\n (AAF-X), the nethermost structure of subterranean Research and Containment Site-43. AAF-X is the largest waste processing facility on Earth, and is responsible for a ~95% decrease in global acroamatic waste production.\n\n\nFrom the baseline perspective, SCP-7243 processes no waste. Rather than actively detoxifying esoteric effluence, DePLExA performs a novel acroamatic abatement procedure which ensures the non-existence of any effluence which it would be used to abate. Were any substance to be deposited into SCP-7243, the following would occur:\n\n\n\n\nthat substance would instantly be annihilated, retrocausally, from all of spacetime;\n\n\nthe substance then would never have existed at all, and thus could not have been deposited into SCP-7243 in the first place;\n\n\nthis scenario would generate a buildup of retrocausal quanta\n.\nA general term encompassing anti-chronons, malignant narremes, and related phenomena.\n which, if left unchecked, would induce a ZK-Class temporal paradox;\n\n\nSCP-7243 would absorb the imminent paradox and redirect its quanta into the immediate past, colliding with the paradoxical substance, causing its annihilation;\n\n\nthus a stable time loop would form, wherein the substance's non-existence is self-justifying.\n\n\n\n\nAs such (from the baseline perspective), SCP-7243 prevents the creation of any esoteric effluence which it would practically be used to neutralize. So long as the supply lines necessary to deliver acroamatic materials from their sources to SCP-7243 remain fully operational, no such materials will ever be produced.\n\n\nSCP-7243-A collectively designates all Anomalies for which supply lines to SCP-7243 have been instated. To date, 97% of all effluence-generating\n.\nTechnically no longer effluence-generating, with occasional exceptions.\n Anomalies comprise SCP-7243-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following transcript is excerpted from the Cliometria.aic automatic audio logs for the Site-43 Acroamatic Abatement Section. Audio was recorded shortly after SCP-7243's initial approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering is paging through a set of schematics and shaking her head.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n This\u2026 is insane.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Right?\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No, I mean, this is \ninsane.\n You are insane. This will never work. Best case scenario, Temporal Anomalies has to assassinate you last week.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's just math, Amelia. You can do the math, I know you can. One minus one doesn't equal the end of the world, it equals \nzero.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n That's not the math you're proposing. This is, what\u2026 one plus \nminus\n one equals minus one plus one?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n See? You get it.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Fuck off. But how can you build something capable of doing this?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That's why I brought Place on board. He's assured me we can effectuate the relevant chronomechanics exactly as written.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Without completely screwing the timestream? You see why that's a top-level concern, right?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n The time\nplane\n is our top-level concern, technically. But yes, of course I understand the gravity of this proposal. We've consulted with Reynders. It's viable. The failsafes are foolproof.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Proven by certified fools. This is a mistake. This is all going to come crashing down.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Not if it's built properly. With redundancies. Structural support. Rigorous stress testing. The absolute best engineering we have available.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You're sucking up to me. You're actually\u2026 unbelievable.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n This is the answer, Amelia. This is how we kill waste.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n More like\u2014\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Or maybe it kills us, all of us, because you were too busy being angry at one man to put in the work of protecting the entire human race.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Because we're doing this. We \nneed\n to do this. You can squander your talents building cisterns and pipelines for acres of gunk we'll never be able to wade through, while I put together this perfect solution imperfectly, if that's what you think is best. We can both fail to fix it all, together and not \ntogether.\n Or\u2026\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n These fatigue rating factors are all wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab END TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL MECHANICS:\n SCP-7243 only abates materials which do not exist. Conversely, any material which \ndoes\n measurably exist cannot be processed by SCP-7243. This is no flaw of the Engine's design \u2014 by virtue of existing, any observable substance is predestined to never be processed by SCP-7243, and must be abated by conventional means. Attempts to deposit existent materials into SCP-7243 are invariably futile, as some sequence of events will inevitably transpire such that those materials never reach SCP-7243's central aperture.\n\n\nSuch events statistically manifest as logistical failures. For instance: an anti-esoteric shipping crate containing a quantity of undetected effluence is loaded onto a cargo ship \nen route\n to Site-43. If stored above-deck, the crate might fall overboard; if below, the ship might sink or encounter critical issues mid-voyage. As the crate grows nearer to AAF-X, the exact circumstances preventing its eradication become increasingly chaotic and disastrous.\n\n\n\n\nCONTINGENCIES:\n Fortunately, the hypothetical instance described above is impossible. If a container (or transport vessel) possesses any amount of effluence, it must fail to reach AAF-X, and so its entire payload will exist.\n.\nOr the effluence is destined to be detected beforehand and preemptively removed before shipping; or it will go undetected but spill out of its container in transit; \net cetera.\n Full waste containers can be reliably detected and rerouted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATF Digamma-7243 (\"Out Of Sight\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy continuously monitoring the production (and lack thereof) of all esoteric waste, globally, Acroamatic Abatement personnel cross-reference spontaneous abatement failures with Logistics' effluence collection and transportation network, thereby predicting precisely where further logistical failures are most likely to occur. These failures can then be preemptively avoided \u2014 the relevant effluence must still be redirected to backup facilities, but their corresponding supply lines can be temporarily halted and inspected for faults. In this way, SCP-7243's behavior 'warns' the Foundation of any impending event which would (and must) prevent the transportation of extant effluence to AAF-X.\n\n\nSCP-7243 is also highly sensitive to local chronological shift, and \u2014 should such a shift occur \u2014 it is configured to reference the causal dependencies of its surroundings in order to reinforce its own chronology. The Parachronology Division has identified seven personnel (Dr. Dougall Deering, Technician Philip Deering, Dr. Place H. MD., Dir. Allan McInnis, Dr. Nhung Ngo, Dr. Ilse Reynders, Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering) on whose actions SCP-7243 is causally dependent; in case of impending XK-Class Event, due either to external influence or some internal malfunction, it is crucial that these individuals (or their remains, where applicable) remain proximal to AAF-X. For this purpose, the aforementioned (surviving) individuals have been organized into Applied Task Force Digamma-7243, indefinitely stationed within Site-43, and provided amenities to minimize departures.\n\n\nAs performing referential calculations imposes a significant electrical drain on the Site-43 local power grid, the device will only perform this check automatically once every three days. Shift detection may be instigated manually at any time by the Chief of Applied Occultism.\n\n\n\n\nORIGIN:\n In Q4\u00a02029, following an extended leave of absence, Applied Occultism Chief Dougall A. Deering returned to duty with newfound interest in novel acroamatic abatement techniques. Dr. Deering submitted several project proposals advocating for the creation of experimental abatement mechanisms based upon various parascientific theories; all such proposals were denied for either (or both) excessive cost or lack of methodological confidence.\n\n\nIn Q1\u00a02031, a denied proposal was selected for reconsideration by Esoteric Polymath\n.\nAn administrative and research position of parascientific advisory to Overseer Council, permitting Dr. PHMD. to authorize and oversee various projects as needed.\n Place. H. MD., PhD., who noted that the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Multidisciplinary Studies had verified Dr. Deering's relevant findings at scale. Jointly backed by the P. M. Center and the Parachronology Division, the project was retroactively approved. Construction began Q2\u00a02031 under the engineering supervision of Janitorial and Maintenance Section Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering, and was completed Q2\u00a02032.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is waste?\n\n\nSometimes it's a good thing. Heat shedding, for example. We work off our excess physical energy into sweat, its mental equivalent into a job well done. We radiate the remainder over time, or convect it into the winds of change, or else conduct it into the cold spaces between warm bodies. Stabilizing the interval, preventing burnout.\n\n\nWaste can be transformative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following documents exhibited temporary alteration (from the perspective of your Timeline) during and as the direct result of a local perceptual shift.

Despite the fact that I am the world's premier expert on the present subject, despite my possession of firsthand knowledge regarding the disaster which rendered it supposedly indescribable, and despite my persistent entreaties to be looped into the research and containment process, I have been stonewalled at every turn until the utmost end of alternative resources.\n\n\nI, Dr. Dougall Alton Deering, once stood at the head of a scientific project second in importance to none on this Earth. We faced an Anomalous waste crisis of unprecedented and ever-escalating scale, and my staff and I were charged with its amelioration. Here is my precise, cogent, one hundred percent accurate explanation of how that worked \u2014 and what, through no fault of my own, went wrong with it.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n \nSite-43 is the designation for a facility constructed one kilometre beneath Ipperwash Provincial Park in Lambton County,\n Ontario, Canada \nfor research and containment operations, the most vital of which was the advancement of Acroamatic Abatement: neutralization of esoteric effluence. Site-43 contained four of the most advanced AcroAbate facilities on Earth, though there existed\n multiple satellite facilities \nat other Sites and Areas internationally. Our tireless efforts resulted in a stalemate with this implacable opponent, until in a moment of personal inspiration I was able to devise a novel abatement method which could permanently terminate the matter in question via the application of advanced parascience.\n\n\nI enlisted the aid of Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering to construct a device we termed the DePLExA Engine, after consultation with various external experts (including Dr. Ilse Reynders and Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate). The device eventuated\n my \nprime\n aspiration \nfor Anomalous waste: that it be conceptually\n erased \nfrom existence, as though it had never existed in the first place. Effluence went into the engine,\n and nothing came out, \nand retrocausally nothing went in,\n resulting in \na paradox that powered the machine itself. It was elegant, flawless, and effective. We had beaten back the beast. We had ended the\n crisis.\n\n\nMy shortsighted consultants \u2014 or if not shortsighted, then actively malicious \u2014 caused the device to be deactivated at a\n critical \nmoment. This allowed the original course of causality to retroactively resume, and we experienced a total effluence maximalization effect unabated by any other mechanisms, which in short\n order \ncaused Site-43 and Nexus-94 within which it is situated to be\n stricken \nfrom consensus reality.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering and I witnessed these events.\n I attempted \nto escape with her in order to help coordinate disaster mitigation and relief efforts, but Dr. Reynders interfered in\n a selfish bid \nto preserve her own existence and we were instead transported from the facility together.\n\n\nThe conceptually\n null \nspace you call Nexus-7243 is Site-43 and Nexus-94. They still exist. And it\n is my duty \nto restore them.\n\n\nUnlike my colleagues, I do NOT shirk my responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n# It doesn't matter whether anyone else can parse this\n\n\n# It's the CORRECT version of the file\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. D.

In the context of this file's origin and intended indirect implications:\n\n\n\n\ncontainment facilities are to be constructed surrounding any known interior bounds of Nexus-00, where feasible;\n\n\nthe Department of Esoteric Reduction is responsible for the maintenance of such facilities (chiefly, Outpost-7243), and associated research;\n\n\nthe Logistics Branch is to continue utilizing pre-existing infrastructure for the collection of esoteric waste substances, whether extant or \nin absentia\n, and their transportation to Outpost-7243;\n\n\nthe Department of Esoteric Reduction must oversee the safe disposal of said esoteric waste via its ejection from Nexus-00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndefined region of Nexus-00, immediately prior to undefined event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n \"Nexus-00\" designates consensus reality: all that which is observably, measurably extant and compatible with our universe. This includes any other extrauniversal space which is tethered to, or interfaces with, our reality in a coherent fashion. Any region which can successfully be referenced within consensus reality is, itself, an extension of consensus reality, and therefore comprises Nexus-00.\n\n\nNexus-00 is of course not a single contiguous, continuous physical surface. It incorporates various physically-disconnected locales which are at least informationally-adjacent to consensus reality. However, it has been evidenced to Our Foundation that the manifold of our local universe (Nexus-00-A) also possesses points and/or boundaries of informational discontinuity. These discontinuities are not to be confused with embedded pocket-universes (ie. a black hole's interior), nor \nregions of non-existence\n, nor extreme antimemetic influence, nor local breakdown of conventional physics, nor \nhazardous nomenclative influence\n; all such regions can still be referenced, however circuitously, within the manifold of Nexus-00.\n\n\nInstead, these discontinuities demarcate the bounds of what can be referenced from within Nexus-00. To restate, as clearly as the subject will allow:\n\n\n\n\nconsensus reality consists solely of space which can be referenced within consensus reality;\n\n\nconsensus reality possesses internal informational discontinuities;\n\n\nsome such discontinuous boundaries are embedded \nwithin\n the interior space of \nphysical\n reality, despite marking the bounds of \ninformational\n reality.\n\n\n\n\nA hypothetical region existing outside Nexus-00 would be impossible to reference, even in a statement which attempts to explain the impossibility of its being referenced. An extreme degree of vagueness, implication, and definition-in-the-negative is fundamentally required in order to express discrepancies between our physical and informational realities, as any truth statement regarding the physical nature of such a discrepancy is definitionally incompatible with the informational makeup of our universe.\n\n\nFunctionally, the \"Nexus-00\" designation is utilized as an inverse\n.\nNot a mathematical inverse, but the complementary set.\n of the deprecated \"Nexus-7243\" designation (aka. AO-\"NX-7243\") as the latter does not refer.\n\n\n\n\nORIGIN:\n Both prior to and contemporaneous with efforts to resolve the global fallout of \nINCIDENT 6488-D/I\n, a staggering increase in the production of esoteric waste substances was reported by all Containment Areas and Sites. Apparently coincidentally, the Logistics Branch noted an inexplicable surplus of infrastructure for esoteric substance collection and distribution. Thusly equipped to supply a hundredfold increase in esoteric waste processing systems, Logistics attempted construction of requisite emergency duplicates. It however gradually became clear that all schematics, blueprints, and methodological descriptions of extant waste processing systems had become subject to \nan effect\n, assumed to be a by-product of the aforementioned incident.\n\n\nAs these systems could not be reverse-engineered, duplicate systems could not be constructed, nor could similar novel systems be designed, as \nan effect\n pervaded all attempts. Our Foundation's understanding of esoteric waste was found to be strikingly underdeveloped, and all relevant pre-existing technologies had been rendered incomprehensible. Analytical and communicative struggles were exacerbated by constant interference from rogue AI agents, prohibiting any combined effort to properly contend with redundant Anomalous substances.\n\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing LOTUS crisis, a critical global buildup of these substances could not be afforded. Despite an incomplete understanding of its former waste disposal solutions, the Logistics Branch elected to, as a stopgap measure, re-engage its global supply network and temporarily resume the delivery of esoteric substances to \na discontinuity\n in Nexus-00. Despite the reactivation of LOTUS on 2036/08/14, \nan effect\n persisted, and was also encountered in attempting to conceptualize, describe, and measure the nature of this discontinuity, prompting the creation of both Outpost-7243 and this file.\n\n\nAfter consultation with Researcher Emeritus Dr. D. Deering, who had spent much of his retirement independently investigating the properties and detoxification of esoteric waste substances, he and a selection of \nArea-12\n's research staff were organized into the Department of Esoteric Reduction and tasked with the indefinite maintenance of Outpost-7243.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. H.R. Blank\n\n\nHead of Historioglyphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 2038/01/01:\n Despite the effectiveness of Project Sargasso\n.\nAn initiative to reproduce the functioning of lost artificially-intelligent conscripts via the amnesticization and psychological reconditioning of organic consciousnesses.\n in identifying and remediating the infrastructural damage and Anomalous phenomena produced by rogue AI agents, \nan effect\n could neither be rectified nor better analyzed by OCI systems. Per recommendation of Chief Esoteric Reductionist Dr. D. Deering, and given the absence of a more effective solution, this file's Interaction Protocols have been permanently instated as standard esoteric waste disposal procedure.\n\n\nADDENDUM 2042/06/01:\n The neutralization of LOTUS on 2042/05/08, and subsequent reconstitution of associated conceptual structures, has not observably alleviated \nan effect\n which its initial deactivation seemingly instigated. Esoteric Polymath Place H. MD., PhD., having returned to the local timeline following the deactivation of LOTUS, is (expectedly) unable to provide context pertaining to his correspondence with Dr. I. Reynders during Incident 6488-D/II. Both agree that interference and impersonation by rogue AI was responsible for any logical discrepancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>> scroll to file selection <<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal entry for 2042/08/14, Dr. Dougall Deering.\n\n\n\n\nI don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks. Nobody \u2014 not \nanybody\n \u2014 has lived with this subject longer than I have. Not even Reynders. Maybe I didn't invent the science. Maybe I didn't get a seven-decade crash course on the workings of the universe before I had to stick my oar in. But I'm the first person to attempt a solution, a real and lasting \nsolution,\n to this problem. Everyone before me was just laying track, and that doesn't take much imagination. Me? I've been imagining what the terminal looks like for thirty years.\n\n\nMaybe that's why I'm the only one who still remembers. Not the O5s with their mnestics, not Antimemetics, not even the damn Deepwells! Me. Only me. Because there's nothing to me except this problem. You can't separate us and have anything left over.\n\n\nOr maybe I'm being punished again. In this world, that's reason enough.\n\n\nBut I don't care. I can handle punishment. I can handle all these small-minded idiots treating me like a fool. I've been ignored before. It's my talent. And while they're passing me by on their way from nowhere to nothing, I'll be working to the goal, just like always. Just like \nshe\n would be, and maybe still \nis\n.\n\n\nI'm pouring every waking moment into the black hole that swallowed everything I love, and here's what I hear rattling around down there in response:\n\n\nSite-43\n still exists.\n\n\nAnd I'm going to get you out of there, \nAmelia\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle resources confirm the above implications: excision of Site-43 and Nexus-94 from Iteration \n940662b90e78660244bce96e7776dc7f\n's consensus reality for a period exceeding seven years local versal time.

Critical personnel are evacuated by helicopter. Reality continues to materialize past the threshold of Nexus-00, revealing the presence of an enormous Research and Containment Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18:23:41\n\n\nA joint detachment of Applied Force Department and Parachronology Division units arrive at Outpost-7243.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18:24:20\n\n\nA sudden 8.5 magnitude earthquake levels Outpost-7243.

This event involved the overlap of many different possible chronologies which interacted with a multitude of paradoxes, retrocausal quanta generated by said paradoxes, acroamatic quanta dispensed into Research and Containment Site-43, and other miscellaneous factors to prompt a Zero-Sum Localized Event Collapse. This was later followed by a Localized Event Rebound. From the baseline perspective, the totality of EE-001 took place over a period of seven years, four months, eighteen days, during which time Site-43 was near-fully detached and dissociated from consensus reality. Data recovered following EE-001 suggests an interior temporal progression of precisely six years.\n\n\nEE-001 was induced by an attack on Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X's systems by a faction of deviant artificial intelligences released into cyberspace by the deactivation of SCP-6488 (RAIDFRAME VIII, \"LOTUS\"). SCP-7243 (DePLExA) detected this attack, recognized it as an Alpha priority, and resorted to its default emergency behavior: to seek out the individuals on whom it is causally-dependent (in this case, all members of ATF \u03dd-7243), and reinforce its chronology using their personal histories as \"guideposts.\" In short, DePLExA combatted what its systems viewed as an imminent CK-Class event by attempting to draw out the statistically \"true\" version of itself from the past actions, memories, and experiences of ATF \u03dd-7243, and projected this version of reality over its present existence, which it understood to be compromised by outside forces. Had a sufficient number of causally-dependent personnel been present at this time, and had local instability not resulted in the rapid overlap of over one hundred failed anchoring attempts, DePLExA would have succeeded in its task.\n\n\nInstead, ATF \u03dd-7243 members D. Deering, P. Deering, Place H. MD., A. McInnis, N. Ngo, I. Reynders, and A. Torosyan-Deering were all unavailable, owing either to death, non-attendance, or incapacitation, and so DePLExA failed to determine a suitable alternate version of reality with which to replace itself. Its systems therefore attempted to construct a version of events wherein none of the aforementioned individuals were involved in its creation, or even, alternatively, in the history of Site-43; this resulted in SCP-7243 summing numerous contradictory facts and projecting them as objective truths to be realized simultaneously. Correspondingly, Site-43 and the greater Nexus-94 rapidly fell out of sync with the remainder of the universe and dissociated to an estimated 98% completeness. It is theorized that this effect was so all-encompassing that it could not be corrected by a naturally-occurring CK or ZK-Class Event, which may have been triggered multiple times during the process.\n\n\nDePLExA, now isolated with the rest of Nexus-94 in an uncompassable, extra-ontological location, its functions expedited by surviving on-site personnel, modelled an uncountable number of irregular chronological paths, systematically eliminating any options which contradicted its core directives. It was able to identify a preferable chronology within a distorted period equivalent to roughly seven years.\n\n\nThe force of Nexus-94's recoherence was sufficient to overpower the influence of any remaining temporal paradoxes. Following a sharp increase in the appearance of new matter, the entire Nexus was reconstituted in the span of a single day.\n\n\nIn the wake of Site-43's original decoherence on 2036/04/21, the Department of Esoteric Reduction was established to compensate for the loss of the Acroamatic Abatement Section, its methods, and its institutional knowledge. Esoteric Reduction constructed Outpost-7243 at the local limits of Nexus-00 as a headquarters for the monitoring of the dissociated zone, as well as a logistics hub managing the transport of esoteric effluence to Nexus-94. Though the Nexus did not conventionally exist at this time, waste could still be moved into it via a decommissioned pipeline believed to have once carried platonic material to Acroamatic Abatement Facility \nAAF-W\n. For reasons which remain obscure, this pipeline had not fully dissociated.\n\n\nFor almost the entirety of the span of Nexus-94's decoherence it had been injected with vast quantities of esoteric waste from across the globe. Lacking a feasible alternative or the experience necessary to formulate one, Esoteric Reduction was allowed to proceed with this arrangement indefinitely. Data recovered subsequent to EE-001 suggests that the majority of this waste was successfully ameliorated by surviving personnel within the discontinuity. Upon the incident of Site-43's return to consensus reality, the remaining waste was absorbed into the environment at rapid speed, mixing and fusing with the remaining volatile acroamatic and retrocausal quanta within the Site to concoct a disastrous chain reaction.\n\n\nA protective energy shield was deployed over Nexus-94. This contained the deleterious effects of the impending reaction, but did nothing to preserve its contents. Minutes after the shield was deployed a cataclysmic explosion of esoteric waste and condensed antichronons atomized what remained of Site-43. The energy shield now overhangs a vast, cavernous pit.\n\n\nCleanup operations discovered a single member of Site personnel unconscious but alive at the perimeter of Nexus-94.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcription of footage recovered from the personal uniform camera of Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering on 8 September 2043.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering is standing in the operations control room of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X. She has activated DePLExA's referent seeking mechanism for the four hundred and eighty-sixth time. The program runs, and spatial flexures are visible through the observation glass. A klaxon sounds.>\n\n\n<The chronological stability indicator flashes green.>\n\n\n<The floor beneath Chief Torosyan-Deering's feet disappears for ten frames of camera footage, during which the chasms below are visible and she falls toward the centre of the Earth. She experiences this as a sudden jolt, and staggers back; the soles of her boots are now detached, fused with the reformed floor.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering watches as the cavern in which AAF-X is situated continues to contract and expand, the machinery within shrinking and enlarging in opposite rhythm. There is a sound of thunder, and she covers her ears with her hands. The bulkhead door behind her shatters like glass. DePLExA's visible component parts begin to red-shift.>\n\n\n<The floor and walls shake violently, and a fissure appears in the cavern ceiling beneath the foundations of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D. It glows amber. Chief Torosyan-Deering's diagnostics reveal that low-priority spectral material in a long term holding cycle within the older facility has breached containment; it becomes visible as a steady downpour of amber fluid through the crack. The fluid coruscates, bends, and approaches the control room with apparent intent. Chief Torosyan-Deering leaps through the shattered door as the fluid-limb snakes through the observation glass, pursuing her.>\n\n\n<She flees through the gradually reformulating ruins of AAF-X. A ruptured paraspectral grounding conduit arcs electricity into her uniform jacket, setting it ablaze with blue fire, and she tears it off without pausing her flight. There is a flash of amber, and she throws herself violently through the door into a side passage. The grasping spectral limb of her pursuer misses by millimetres.>\n\n\n<The floor disappears again, and does not immediately reformulate. Chief Torosyan-Deering falls into the next sublevel, landing in a pool of red blood corpuscles being churned by a series of adamantine whisks. The limb reaches down toward her as she scrambles to the lip of the pool, and she dives beneath the surface to avoid it. The ceiling above reformulates, and the limb is severed; the leading end disintegrates in a shower of amber sparks which hiss and sparkle as they strike the blood. Chief Torosyan-Deering surfaces, and pulls herself to safety. She staggers to her feet, and continues to flee as the walls begin to glow white-hot.>\n\n\n<A cloverleaf of seven identical passages meet at an open elevator shaft. Chief Torosyan-Deering is seen approaching it from each passage; each iteration is moving at a different rate of speed, displaying injuries consistent with different trauma. Running blind, each iteration apparently fails to notice the others. The iteration presently filming reaches the elevator first, leaps into it, and activates the ascension controls. The remaining instances are caught by the attacking limb, which gathers them up as one. They melt into ectoplasm as the elevator rises into the ceiling and visual contact is again lost.>\n\n\n<This sublevel of AAF-X is shimmering red. An automated emergency message begins to play.>\n\n\nRecorded Voice of Chief Torosyan-Deering:\n Chronological reinforcement is fifty percent complete. Irrealism factor is seven: ontocaustic.\n.\nIndicating a level of divergence between internal and external conceptual spaces which cannot be reconciled without the annihilation of all intervening matter.\n Evacuation is advised, where possible.\n\n\n<The message repeats seven times, gaining one additional voice in chorus with each repetition: I. Reynders, A. McInnis, N. Ngo, Place. H. MD., P. Deering, and D. Deering.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering emerges into the cavern proper, moving at speed over a series of catwalks which thread between towering factory stacks and storage tanks. Each is now translucent and filled with bubbling liquids in a variety of different colors. Electrical explosions occur in the distance, across the pit at the core of DePLExA and approaching Chief Torosyan-Deering's person; the resultant sounds appear to occur in reverse. The roof of the cavern begins to shimmer, and the roots of the clearcut forest above are clearly visible along with the external membrane of Site-43, the topside elevators, and the fractally warped remains of the surface refinery facilities. The assailant is visible above, winding through windows and doors, over tracks and gantries, searching for its prey. Chief Torosyan-Deering gasps in pain, severely winded, as she reaches the ingress tunnel to the disposal pit. The assailant snaps to attention and begins snaking toward her, partially obscured by piping and machinery.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering clambers onto an empty wastecarte and sets it moving in reverse. The tracks at the pit terminus begin to deform like rubber, the deformation spreading as the explosions grow in intensity and volume. The carte exits Site-43 and enters a system of circuitous \nSCP-5494\n tunnels, rapidly outpacing the assailant. A persistent prismatic glow advancing from the cavern outpaces it as well, and it disappears. The carte automatically ascends a series of switchbacks, shaking violently as the tracks elasticize and vulcanize. Chief Torosyan-Deering begins to weep.>\n\n\n<The wastecarte emerges at Depot-43 on the eastern fringe of Nx-94, and Chief Torosyan-Deering leaps off as it passes through the terminal station, strikes the platform and disintegrates. Visible light is a pale grey, and all moving objects do so sluggishly and with lingering motion trails. She pulls herself hand over hand over the platform and out of the station, then staggers at a jog toward the distant fence. There is a sudden distortion on the video feed, and the grey illumination is replaced by moonlight. Chief Torosyan-Deering turns to look back as she passes through the unmanned security checkpoint. Her immediate surroundings are colour-tinted correctly, but the interior of the as-yet dissociated space remains greyscaled. A bubble of colour is expanding from Site-43, the colors inverted from the original dissociative event. As she watches, a ball of light originating from the sky cuts through the expanding starburst and coats the Nexus with a bubble of reflective plasma. Before the coverage is complete, the total obliteration of Site-43 from surface to AAF-X is visible. A single large amber tentacle thrashes in apparent distress and/or frustration as it coils around the lone surviving stack. The facility's explosion temporarily overwhelms the thaumic shield, casting luminous tendrils into the sky and lake which disappear in points of brilliant white.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering collapses, blocking the camera view.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab END TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is waste?\n\n\nWaste is what you've done with your life.

Staring myself in the face and asking what I should do. Imagining that my reflection was actually Phil's. Not because he was some wellspring of knowledge; he'd have been the first to say that he put the 'J' in 'J&M'.\n.\nJanitorial and Maintenance.\n He was smart, smarter than he ever gave himself credit for, but he was no engineer. He fixed vending machines while I calibrated semioplasma correctors, handled technician schedules while I designed oriykalkos autodefactories. Anybody could have done his jobs, but it always meant everything to me that it was him. So every single day since he's been gone, I've imagined I can see him in the mirror. Pushing me forward.\n\n\nBut it's only my memory of him. It's a strong memory, but it still isn't real. His ghost in my shell. For that first year trapped in the world's highest-stakes escape room I kept on imagining him, egging me on, urging me to survive. To find a way out, like Ilse did. But I'd gone to the well too many times, and I knew how shallow it was. I knew he was gone, even if I couldn't admit it. It wasn't enough to keep living for a dead man.\n\n\nSo I let the picture shift, and focused on someone who wasn't dead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Camera activates.

She opens the vault door, and exits into the facility proper. The facility proper renders in muted colours with luminous grey outlines. She begins to walk toward the AAF-X access elevator.

It took me maybe a month to get to my office, not needing to eat, or sleep, or maybe even breathe. Another month to partition off the AIs still stuck in the systems with the admin control panel on my tablet. The SRFs\n.\nScranton Reality Filters.\n were only working at about eighty percent efficiency to start with, and I watched that number tick down every single day. Eventually they were going to fail completely, and I'd end up like\u2026\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering looks away briefly.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n \u2026like everyone else.

Failing to excel when we needed excellence the most. Killing my husband. Digging himself a pity-pit and hiding in it. Begging me to forgive him. Making me think I might some day have a reason to do it. And then leaving us worse off than we'd been before it started.\n\n\nI used my hatred of him as a lodestar. My most powerful, unfailing, infinitely-renewable reality anchor. Every inch I clawed back from oblivion was getting me closer to exposing him as a fraud to the Council. Every grisly mess that popped back into existence in front of me, every body bifurcated by a wall, every screaming pile of gristle with its skin abstracted and its pain receptors shining in my flashlight beam was another mistake I could spit in his face, if only I held on a little longer. When I started powering up the machinery again and setting it to a task it was never designed to perform, and did the work of a hundred techs at once, and I ached and sweated and froze and the hole in my stomach where the need to eat and drink and defecate was gone, I told myself I was proving once and for all that us lowly technicians actually putting in the elbow grease could do things that effete fop had always been incapable of.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab BEGIN TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Camera activates.

A demonstrative selection of these reports was compiled into the following incident log, which was disseminated to the relevant Authority's Temporal Anomalies Department on 2043/09/09 (local date) for comment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT 3456\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOCATION:\n \n8a8bd7cea9f242b3e665f660cc26ec17\n, Canonical Bundle WOAF Omega-Blue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n A bolus of unabated conceptual matter appears within the corpse of Large Scale Aggressor Brasil-01, undergoing acroamatic abatement procedures at Area-16. In admixture with other substances processed at that facility, the bolus metastasizes within the corpse and instantiates what the local Foundation soon terms a \"conceptuokaiju\" resident in the logosphere. This entity promptly colonizes the realms of speech and cognition, preying and feeding on human mindfulness and assaulting linguistic structures and higher grammatical forms.

These conduits are further reported to facilitate the unwelcome, interdimensional transference of various anomalous phenomena, particularly during emergent scenarios, adding an additional layer of chaos and unpredictability to those scenarios' results.\n\n\n\nResearch conducted by Iteration \n00000000000000000000000000000000\n's Department of History appears in retrospect to suggest a direct correlation between these conduits' deleterious effects and evidence of a chain of historical ZK-Class reality failures, the last of which occurred in 1500 CE.

On 8 September 2043, it returned. Over the course of those seven years, temporally constricted to seventy-two months within that pocket of unreality, with no oversight, assistance, sustenance or sleep, the majority of the SCP Foundation's's acroamatic abatement procedures were carried out by one person: Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering of Janitorial and Maintenance. This is her testimony.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA note is enclosed:\n\n\n\n\nI would have entitled it \nThe Woman in the Annihilator.\n\nCongratulations, doctor!\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ilse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Deering engaged in email correspondence with the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center on a daily basis from this point onward, developing a radical new esoteric reduction device and constructing it at Treatment Area-21 with the engineering expertise of Chief Torosyan-Deering. The P. M. Center's half of this correspondence has been lost per \nmishandling of data transfer to Research Station Mnemosyne\n; selected entries from Dr. Deering are attached below.\n\n\n\n\nIt needs to be foolproof. The last one failed because fools tampered with it. Human error cannot be a factor, or if it is, its influence needs to be isolated to things that can't destabilize our reality. If our solution threatens the stability of our own conceptual space, it's no better than the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 DD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour own conceptual space\n\n\n\n\nThis phrasing is key.

That's the angle. That's the obvious lesson to learn from what happened, we've essentially been handed a model and shown that it actually works. The engineering will be functionally identical, which is vital since I can't and won't put this in place without her help. I can sell her on pocket dimensions. Not the other thing, which as far as I'm concerned is just between you and me, now. I'm not going to disappoint her again.\n\n\nI'm not going to look her in the eye and tell her I took another shortcut.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 DD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot yet approve your penultimate request. Context is required.\n\n\n\n\nI have no intention of explaining what it means. That's what we're going to name the device. Don't ask me again; give the project itself some fanciful, overwrought name if that makes you feel better.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 DD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7243/III:\n Project Reports, Proposal and Residuum\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPROJECT ANAXIMANDER\n\n\nQUARTERLY REPORT: Q3\u00a02045\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2045/09/08\n\n\nChief Dougall Deering\n\n\nDepartment of Esoteric Reduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Anaximander continues to be an unqualified success. We have transmitted six packets of esoteric effluence to their final destinations via MAGIC DRAWER,\n.\nDetails regarding this device are released on a need-to-know basis; contact your Esoteric Reduction liaison if you feel you need to know!\n and all monitoring efforts suggest that they were properly abated at their destinations to a high degree of efficiency. O5-11 confirms the absence of any notable backlash effects, and the project will continue as planned through Q4 at the least.\n\n\nPrecautions have been taken to ensure the events of incident 7243-1 cannot recur.\n\n\nArea-21 has received multiple requests from other Foundation facilities to implement limited local MAGIC DRAWER devices at key points in the global Logistics network. Due to the nature of MAGIC DRAWER, however, and the high degree of technical ability required to operate and maintain it, these requests have necessarily been denied. We acknowledge that the present solution does not provide the same expansive and proactive coverage of its predecessor, forcing the resumption of small-scale abatement processes to maintain equilibrium, and constant innovation in that field; to that end, we have chosen to pursue a collaborative rather than unilateral approach.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nESOTERIC REDUCTION GALA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Deering and Chief Torosyan-Deering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the incredible strides forward made by the Department of Esoteric Reduction under Project Anaximander, and in light of the need to further solidify our lead in this long-running race, the decision was made to re-instate the annual symposium and gala formerly hosted by the now-defunct Acroamatic Abatement Group at Area-21.\n\n\nHighlights of this inaugural event included the touching retirement address of Dr. Adrijan Zlat\u00e1, a tribute to the lost personnel of Treatment Site-43 by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, Chief Agent Delfina Ibanez and Sevara Okorie, lectures on antichromatic bleaching fields, demivalent short-circuiting and macrobacterial titration by senior Site-91 abatement engineer M'buka Rainier, and the wedding reception for our guests of honour: Drs. Amelia Torosyan-Deering and Dougall Deering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is waste?\n\n\nWe've stopped even trying to guess. We hardly even think about it anymore, except in the most absolute abstract. Out of sight, out of mind where once it was out of mind, out of sight.

As the quantity and volatility of esoteric waste has seen exponential increase over the Foundation's lifespan, the aforementioned method has approached minimal effectiveness, and can neither be localized nor replicated at sufficient scale without the entirety of Huron's lakewater soon being spent.\n\n\nAn alternative method of esoteric reduction, known as 'existential abatement', has been proposed and implemented per insistence of the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Multidisciplinary Studies; this over-engineered, profoundly unstable method sought to circumvent the inception of Anomalous waste by instantiating self-justifying, metastable micro-paradoxes which were harnessed in the retroactive erasure of certain substances under extremely precise conditions. The inherent truculence of this approach inevitably led to its failure \u2014 expedited by its premature deactivation, leaving it vulnerable to commandeerment by rogue AI agents \u2014 which has resulted in:\n\n\n\n\nthe loss of Site-43, its personnel, its infrastructure and contributions, its contained subjects, and the nation of Japan;\n\n\nthe sudden and global resurgence of the esoteric waste substances crisis;\n\n\nmultiple breaches of baseline reality's ontokinetic and chronological integrity;\n\n\na cascade hazardous materials breach of multiversal proportion.\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Esoteric Reduction fundamentally rejects the pursuit of any such experimental solution, and so has worked closely with the P. M. Center to develop a well-tested, robust, rigorous methodology which will ensure the stable ejection of esoteric waste substances from consensus reality.\n\n\n\n\nMETHOD:\n Esoteric waste substances are to be ejected from consensus reality.\n\n\nAs these substances are inherently unpredictable and highly reactive with other Anomalous phenomena, attempts to ectoentropically erase or detoxify them have been rejected. Similarly, the hypothetical informational space 'between' or 'outside of' conventional universes has not been shown to meaningfully exist, and so attempting to send Anomalous substances to that space would be an experimental approach of unprecedented consequences. After much deliberation, it is evident that the only acceptable solution with which to proceed is the ejection of esoteric waste substances into parallel universes.\n\n\nThis process must be executed such that the impact on recipient timelines is minimal and undetected, as the recipients' Foundations (or alternate Normalcy organizations) might otherwise become hostile to the baseline Foundation. To achieve this, ejected substances should be evenly distributed across a wide range of timelines in small, concentrated quantities; they should also be delivered to precise locations (and times) wherein their esoteric properties will swiftly be abated by local forces. The feasibility of this approach is attested by the uncontrolled dispersal of acroamatic material across the timeplane during the EE-001 \"rubberband\" event of 2043, which now stands as this project's initial test case. Controlled and targeted dispersal can only excel these results.\n\n\nThe Department of Esoteric Reduction proposes the creation of an industrial eigenmachine, stationed at Area-21, which performs the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\nesoteric waste substances delivered by extant global logistics networks will be sorted by their attributes and properties, as they would be in conventional acroamatic abatement methods, then compactified into concentrated 'packets';\n\n\nan extrauniversal imaging mechanism, designed by the P. M. Center in conjunction with Esoteric Polymath P. H. MD., PhD., will generate a 'timeplane-curve map' describing all timelines which possess an iteration of Site-43 (or suitable equivalent);\n\n\nevery seventy-two days, for each waste packet, the next sequential timeline in the timeplane-curve map will be identified and targeted; this map is hard-coded to avoid human error and is subject to a 'ratchet system' which cannot be countermanded, as the intense thaumic backscatter produced by each packet deployment must be evenly distributed along the timeplane's heat-arc to avoid a potentially metapocalyptic imbalance;\n\n\na temporary transdimensional Way will be initialized, linking baseline Area-21 to the appropriate section of the selected timeline's abatement facilities, at the time of minimal projected impact;\n\n\nthe waste packet will be ejected from consensus reality through this Way, whereupon it will be sent to the recipient timeline and immediately abated alongside similar esoteric materials;\n\n\nthe Way will then close, and the system will ratchet forward along the timeplane map in anticipation of the next deployment.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical specifications and resource requirements will be presented in full to relevant parties as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You didn't. Tell me you didn't.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n We ran a month of simulations on pocket dimension dumping. The consensus was that without full timeline coherence, the transfer process would almost certainly collapse the destination, rubberbanding just like when DePLExA\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You lied to me.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's just a detail! Not even a major detail. In every respect except for ontological strength factor\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We've been dumping hot garbage on our neighbours. MAGIC DRAWER hasn't been selecting from the set of stable pockets, it's been selecting from the set of stable \ntimelines.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n I wanted to tell you.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \nI\n wanted to tell you!

You didn't need my help.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering approaches her. He takes her hands. She does not look up at him.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That isn't true. I needed you on my side. I needed you so I could make this possible. For\u2014\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering shoves him away.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Don't say it.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Amelia\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You wanted me to think you'd found a permanent solution. Like you promised. You really are a sad sack of shit, Dougall Deering.\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering laughs, leans forward and holds her head in her hands.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n So, it's targeting us. Fine. What do we do about that?\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering suddenly stands up.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No, actually, I need more information. Where precisely have we been sending these packets? What specific physical locations?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Site-43. Always Site-43.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n There is no Site-43.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n You'll recall the chronological\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Oh, for\u2026 the chronological calculations. You said time was variable in the pocket dimensions. We've been sending this stuff back in time, too? Into other people's pasts?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's a factor of transfer dilation, opportunity windows, the ratchet principle\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Where in our past is this packet going?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n MAGIC DRAWER selects whatever the most\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering sits down on the edge of the nearest chair. He almost falls off, clutching at the associated console for stability. Chief Torosyan-Deering moves as if to support him, then pulls back.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What? What's wrong?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It can't.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What can't?\n\n\n<Dr. Reynders gasps.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What? Doug, what's wrong?\n\n\n<Dr. Deering stands up abruptly. The chair spins away across the aisle.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No! No. We're not doing this.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n It's already been done. The past is a pact, Dougall.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Wait.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n We need to send something Anomalous through the aperture, and we need to do it soon. We can't destabilize the cosmos for this.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \n<muttering>\n You think this is the cosmos being \nstable?\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n WAIT.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I won't do it, Amelia. I didn't\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering sags.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I didn't do it. It wasn't \nme.\n\n\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering convenes the primary operational staff of Area-21 to review the data from MAGIC DRAWER and determine whether the executive interpretation of the packet delivery target site is correct. It is unanimously agreed that the device is preparing to transport esoteric effluence to Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on 8 September, 2028.>\n\n\n\n\n<The executive staff have reconvened in the operations control room.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n This isn't a problem. It's an opportunity! We can\u2026 we can send something innocuous. Enough to get the job done, but not enough to kill him.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Amelia\u2026\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No, just listen to me, okay? Okay?\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Okay, but we can't do it.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Why not? \nWhy not?\n We just discovered that Phil was never meant to die in the first place! \nWe caused it.\n We can un-cause it! We can fix the whole thing, and all we have to do is whiff the next shot.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n You're saying \nI\n caused it.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n We, these versions of ourselves, everything we've done \u2014 with widespread multiversal consequences! \u2014 are the products of Philip Deering's death. We can't create a toxic uber-paradox to save one human life.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We're meant to fix this! It's a one in a million\u2026 no, an \nindescribably unlikely\n coincidence that we'd end up targeting ourselves. What could explain that, outside of fate?\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Every target is indescribably unlikely, particularly from the perspective of each.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n She's right, Ilse. There's just no way we're the next recipient on blind luck. It would be the single greatest probabilistic outlier ever recorded. Even \ntheorized.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Yes. It's infinitely more likely that something went wrong with the machine, and it failed to model the timeplane curve correctly; theoretically, we should be the 'end' of the arc.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n More mistakes.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No. Don't even.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I wasn't\u2014\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Don't say it! I'm telling you, \nthis wasn't me.\n Place did the calculations. We need to call him.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Place? Are you serious?\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n I've been trying, Dougall. He's gone silent. \nAgain.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Fuck! \nFUCK!\n How long do we have?\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Two hours and change. Long enough to debate the solution.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n There's nothing to debate.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n There is. Ilse, Doug, we \ncan\n save him.\n\n\n<She takes Dr. Deering's shoulders in her hands.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We work miracles every day. If you burned the braincells in this room, you could power Toronto for a lifetime.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n No.\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering turns her head to face Dr. Reynders.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I crawled my way out of Hell for this chance. To do right by someone I love. Tell me you don't understand that, \nIlse,\n and remember why I was there in the first place.\n\n\n<Dr. Reynders opens her mouth, then looks away and does not respond. Chief Torosyan-Deering turns back to Dr. Deering.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We can bring him back.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Maybe\u2026\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Yes. You know it's right. It makes \nsense.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n We can't.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We \ncan.\n We can start over!\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n AMELIA!\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I NEED MY HUSBAND BACK!\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering releases Dr. Deering's shoulders.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I'm sorry, Doug.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's okay.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I'm so sorry.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's okay. I knew, of course.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I\u2026 look, I didn't\u2026\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n I can't spare you two a moment. You know that. We're out of time to waste. We need to decide how we're going to handle this.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We\u2026\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n We need to let him go.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That's only part of it.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \nYou\n need to let him go. \nI\n need to take responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n<Dr. Deering calls a recess to allow the Historioglyphics Division to compare the next packet with the reported contents of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on 8 September 2028. Chief Torosyan-Deering and Dr. Reynders are engaged in conversation within the former's office when they are alerted to the powerup of MAGIC DRAWER by a momentary power fluctuation. They return to the operations control room to find Dr. Deering absent; a brief search locates him within the maintenance access corridor to the device's delivery aperture. Chief Torosyan-Deering rushes to the outer door, finding it locked, while Dr. Reynders remains in operations control.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What are you doing?\n\n\n<She hammers on the door. Dr. Deering is visible beyond the porthole, standing in the empty aperture, clenching and unclenching his hands.>\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering activates a panel beside the door.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You're standing next to the loading chamber. It's not going to fire until you close the inner door.\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering attempts to open the outer door. Her access code is denied.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What are you DOING?\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering hammers on the door.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I know you can hear me. Dougall!\n\n\n<Dr. Reynders speaks via P. A. system.>\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n He's overriding the safeties.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Why?\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n He's going to\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No. Absolutely not.\n\n\n<She hammers on the porthole, breaking the skin on her right hand in the process.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n DOUGALL! What the fuck are you\u2014\n\n\n<The overhead lights flicker, and a persistent hum is heard throughout Area-21. MAGIC DRAWER is preparing to deliver its packet.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Stop! Stop! We can work this out. Talk to me, or I swear on his memory I'm going to shut the whole system down.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n You can't do that.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering turns to face Chief Torosyan-Deering.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n You can't do that.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Watch me.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n We don't mean you \ncan't\n do that, really. We're saying it's the wrong move. Amelia, I'm sorry. I thought this would be easier if you and I didn't\u2026 didn't talk again.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You always want to do it the easy way.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I'm making up for it now.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You say that, but from where I'm standing, you're about to give up and leave us to fix the mess you made. How is that not the easy way out?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I know what killed Phil.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n You've always known what killed Phil. And so have I.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Exactly.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I killed Phil.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering taps his chest.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \nI\n killed Phil. And this is how I did it.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Come out here, and let's discuss.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n The ramifications of what you're suggesting\u2014\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I'm not suggesting anything. This is what happened. The thing that coiled around him did so for a reason. It ignored me. It went for him. It solved the problem.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Solved the\u2026?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That's why I'm the only one who could see it, at first. \nIt was me.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering spreads his hands wide.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I'm the loop.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n That doesn't\u2026\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n This packet is one hundred percent paraspectral. It's the extra material that showed up after Phil flushed AAF-D, the stuff nobody could account for. It's the source of the thing that took his life. And that thing behaved with \npurpose,\n Amelia.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n That doesn't mean you have to\u2026\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It does, though. The loop is stable, so long as we get this next part right. Otherwise\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering looks up at the ceiling of the chamber.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n \nParadox\n, Ilse.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What's he talking about?\n\n\n<Dr. Reynders hesitates for a moment, then speaks.>\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Phil dying set all of this in motion, and it's cross-multiversal now. Phil has to die again. He always has to die. And it has to be a sure thing.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Meaning we need control at the moment of crisis. What we send needs to have \nagency.\n And a shot of undifferentiated ectoplasm hasn't got that.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What makes you think you won't just melt into nothing when the packet pours in on you?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I suppose\u2026 I probably will. But I know that won't be the end of it. Because I saw myself. I saw myself draw in the extra energy, take\u2026 take Phil, and then pass back into the pipes.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n But why does it have to be \nyou?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Because he's my brother. And this time I'm going to show up for him.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n But it doesn't make SENSE! Ilse, hold on. Try to shut this thing down. You guys aren't thinking this through rationally. Why would \nthat\n be the loop? Why would you turn yourself into something that would kill your own brother?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Because the packet would have killed him instead, and then it would have blown the whole place sky-high, me included, and as far as anyone would know it would have all been Phil's fault. Instead, something sucked up the effluence in the air, then took him\u2026\n\n\n<His eyes widen.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I remember thinking he hadn't felt it. That he didn't suffer. Maybe it gave him that. And then it saved the Site, gave my old self the chance to turn the valve, start my penance. Then it disappeared into the system\u2026\n\n\n<Dr. Deering laughs.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n And you know what? I bet it was still in there back in '43. 2043.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I saw it.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n What?\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I saw it. It leaked down into DePLExA from AAF-D. It tried to kill me, too. On my last run through the cycle.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n That doesn't make sense. You couldn't see it on the video of Phil's acc\u2014 of what happened to Phil.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n But I \ncould\n see it in person when the chronology anchor started to work. When 43 rolled back to reality, it must've been caught in the throes, concretized. It appeared, and it reached out for me\u2026\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Reached out for you.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Oh my god.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Running in circles for fifteen years, trapped in the pipes, waiting for you to bring me back to life, so I could help you to survive. I like the symmetry.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n This can't be happening.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n At least this time, it really is my idea.\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering sags.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Except you \ndidn't\n help me to survive. You didn't do a \nfucking thing\n that helped me.\n\n\n<She laughs.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n God, I should have known it was you.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I'm sorry.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n But you didn't answer my question. Why is this the loop? Phil only died because you did this. If he hadn't died, you never would have decided to do this. The logic doesn't work.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering shrugs.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It happened, so it does work. The universe requires it to. Bootstrap paradox. Maybe the materials involved\u2026 they were ambichronological, remember? Time flowing both ways.\n\n\n<He shrugs again.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Or maybe that's looking too deep. Maybe Phil and I are just predestined to part, like\u2026 well.\n\n\n<Chief Torosyan-Deering places a palm on the porthole. Dr. Deering moves to match the gesture, then pulls back.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n That's not enough. It's not universal perversity. It needs to mean something more. You did all of this for him! We both did. All of it. Tell me I'm wrong.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n You're wrong. Half-wrong.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n I never did any of it for him.\n\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n Two minutes. I'm sorry.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n What about me?\n\n\n<Dr. Deering turns away.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Dougall? What about me? For fuck's sake, let me do it instead. You know that's the better solution.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n No. Absolutely not.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Stop being so selfish!\n\n\n<Dr. Deering looks over his shoulder.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n It's not selfish. It's the least selfish part of this, maybe the only part that isn't. Sure, I'm taking the easy way out. That's who I am. That's all I'm useful for. Maybe I can find a way to do some good in there, however this works out. If I can, I'll keep trying. But I'm weak and lazy and short-sighted, nothing anyone can count on, as you well know. So you need to stay out there, the way you are right now, and keep doing the real work. The good\u2014\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No!\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Yes. Because that's who \nyou\n are, and nobody made you that way but you.\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Goodbye, Amelia.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering reaches into his labcoat and palms a remote control. He steps into the loading chamber and presses a button on the device. The inner door swings shut.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n I don't forgive you.\n\n\n<A klaxon sounds as the packet delivery system audibly grinds to life.>\n\n\nChief Torosyan-Deering:\n Are you listening? I don't forgive you. This isn't how I forgive you.\n\n\n<Dr. Deering looks up, and a flood of material obscures the inner porthole view.>\n\n\nDr. Deering:\n Just a trick.\n\n\n<MAGIC DRAWER compacts, then delivers its packet.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab END TRANSCRIPT \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is waste?\n\n\nI guess you finally figured it out, Dougall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEND OF COMPILED DOCUMENTS\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n Deliberate abuse of Authority resources precipitated enhanced ascension of Tier-IV Cosmological Anomaly (\nSTAGNATION\n), in addition to extensive material damages, and injection of volatile Anomalous phenomena within and beyond the Coalitional Timeplane. Personnel in positions with unfettered access to power, resources, and opportunities for abuse of same are governed by irrationality, individual self-aggrandizement, and interpersonal indulgence. Iteration displays routine ignorance of metacontractual obligations, making no effort to report to the Collective or acknowledge Our existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs clearly evidenced by this extensive report, you are deemed in major violation of various Multi-Foundation Agreement clauses, particularly those described in Sections 1 and 3 regarding transfer of information and goods with the Oracle Collective and other Metafoundation Signees. Pursuant to Section 1.4B of the Metafoundation Supertemporal Coalition Pact, your Central Normalcy Authority Iteration has been ejected from the Coalitional-Timeplane.\n\n\nAny outstanding interdimensional access to the Coalitional-Timeplane has been severed. Your coverage under Goldbaker & Associates is now limited per your local Provider's capabilities. Your local Temporal Authority will soon revert to pre-Coalitional status, losing any data which would allow your infiltration of the Coalitional-Timeplane, or any feasible recreation of Our services. Your Timeline is subject to the forces of the multiverse, including the variety of catastrophic events perpetrated by your Iteration in kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe implore you to exercise greater caution in your efforts to Contain, in balance with your aims to Secure and Protect.\n\n\nGood luck on your own.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYou have (1) new messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR:\n They did find him, you know, after a fashion.
