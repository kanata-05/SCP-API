The object induces a hallucinatory effect causing observers to see SCP-7547 as the head of a close loved one.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 14/07/2019, the Boston police department was notified that a murder had taken place. The victim's head, SCP-7547, was displayed in front of the Reality Church of Boston, with their body lying nearby. Upon the discovery of the head's anomalous properties, jurisdiction over the investigation was transferred to the SCP Foundation. Adam Engle was chosen as investigator.\n\n\n\n\n[AUDIO LOG]\n\n\nLocation:\n Adam Engle\u2019s office\n\n\nDate:\n 16/07/2019\n\n\nTime:\n 17:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\n(The sound of a door opening and closing.)\n\n\nEngle:\n Oh, hey.\n\n\nVoice:\n1\n Just one of those days, huh?\n\n\nEngle:\n I won\u2019t say I disagree.\n\n\nCho:\n Got some more files for you.\n\n\n(The sound of a stack of papers impacting the desk.)\n\n\nEngle:\n Thanks.\n\n\nCho:\n So what\u2019re you thinking? Anart piece? Some kind of ritual?\n\n\nEngle:\n Well, Forensics haven\u2019t gotten back with the victim\u2019s identity, so could be anything, really. It might be a crime of passion, if the anomalous properties are anything to go by.\n\n\nCho:\n Oh, yeah, makes it a pain in the ass to deal with. I keep seeing\u2013 \n(coughs)\n I keep seeing people in Forensics having to step away, tears in their face. And I mean I don\u2019t blame them, like, I know it\u2019s fake, but doesn\u2019t change the fact it looks like my fianc\u00e9\u2019s severed head on a pike. Say, what does it look like to you?\n\n\nEngle:\n \u2026I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\n\n\nCho:\n Fair enough. Sorry for bringing it up.\n\n\nEngle:\n It\u2019s fine.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nCho:\n Welp, I\u2019m gonna head back. See you later, man.\n\n\nEngle:\n Bye.\n\n\n(The sound of a door opening and closing.)\n\n\n(Shuffling papers. Engle mumbles something unintelligible in a sing-song tone.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Office phone rings. Engle picks it up)\n\n\nEngle:\n Hel-\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n2\n The ball has been set in motion.\n\n\nEngle:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n Listen well, we won\u2019t repeat this twice. 14/07/2012, Portland, Maine. Remember it? It should be fresh in your mind.\n\n\nEngle:\n \u2026What is this?\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n Trust everyone and no one. It is perpetual motion run amok, but the flight plan can be adjusted. Find a map.\n\n\n(The phone line disconnects, playing a dull tone.)\n\n\nEngle:\n \u2026\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I/VII) --->\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
