The first 100m have had lighting installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-1986\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n As SCP-1986 is immovable and located in a heavily travelled public building, security must be maintained covertly in order to prevent the general public from becoming aware of its existence. Guards posing as library staff are to be employed. Only non-lethal measures have been approved.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1986 is a cylindrical tunnel ~2m wide lined with volumes of books. Although the full extent of the tunnel is unknown, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) has established a minimum depth of 274,700\u00a0km or nearly 1 light-second (expeditions have confirmed a depth of at least 4,441\u00a0km). The conjecture has been advanced that the tunnel may be infinite.\n1\n\n\nThe volumes lining the tunnel often resemble known works, though with substantial alterations as to style, character, plot and subject matter. Authors are occasionally authentic ones, though often they are wholly unknown. The works range from being somewhat unusual to completely nonsensical, though nominally at least intelligible (see the section \nRecovered Works\n). All languages currently extant as well as extinct ones are represented. In no case has any volume borne any publication information. Dating techniques have established that the volumes originate from the era they would otherwise appear to, based on semantic and linguistic considerations. No discernible pattern\n2\n has been found to the arrangement of the volumes.\n\n\nThe walls of the tunnel are made of ordinary limestone. Attempts at breaching them have shown that the tunnel is non-Euclidean i.e. to excavate through the floor is to emerge from the ceiling (topologically,\n3\n it can be likened to a 3-torus). Attempts at reaching the tunnel at an angle have proven futile as the tunnel is absent unless approached from its entrance.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n\nSCP-1986 was discovered in 1989 by a librarian\n4\n in an unused basement of \nLa Biblioteca Nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina\n located in Buenos Aires. Foundation personnel administered class B amnesics to those who had been made aware of its existence and cordoned off the basement under the guise of performing emergency structural repairs.\n\n\nRecovered Works:\n\n\nThe following is a list of selected works recovered from SCP-1986.\n\n\nShould other noteworthy samples come to light, please contact the archivist in charge for appraisal and possible inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nThe Gospel of Eve\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nnone\n\n\nLanguage\n: Aramaic, \ncirca\n 1100 BCE\u2013200 CE\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 75m\n\n\nDescription\n: A section of Biblical \nApocrypha\n purporting to be an account of Eve's life after her exile from The Garden of Eden.

A search of 20th century fiction has uncovered this to be an imaginary work central to the plot of the real novel \nThe Man in the High Castle\n by Philip K. Dick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nA Lapful of Severed Tongues\n\n\nAuthor\n: Lisa Palladino, Ph.D.\n\n\nLanguage\n: Braille, archaic \ncirca\n 1850 CE\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 44m\n\n\nDescription\n: A collection of essays on the American Suffragette movement.

The novel contains the frame narrative of a university professor using the story in a lecture to illustrate a thought experiment concerning fate vs free-will. This narrative is interrupted by the appearance of the Ucalegon, and his setting fire to the lecture theatre. The story ends in mid-sentence as the professor and his students are attempting to flee the building. An introduction points out allusions in the narrative to classical myth, the life of Mary Shelley, computational physics, the Oxford comma and the heat-death of the Universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nHattard\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nDarius Jackson\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, non-standard\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 12,447m\n\n\nDescription\n: A dramatization of a purportedly true story that occurred during the Great London Earthquake of 2007. It follows the story of the Hattard triplets, residents of London at the time, and their successful attempt at reaching a refugee camp after two weeks of wandering the fallen city. The triplets institute an extra-judicial court to deal with looters caught during the calamity, acting as the prosecutor, defense counsel and judge. In the afterword, the author writes that the three sisters were treated as national heroes and awarded the Damehood by King Albert III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nJe Sais Que Vous L'avez Fait\n (trans: I Know You Did it)\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nMiriam Cotillard\n\n\nLanguage\n: French\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 1,083 meters\n\n\nDescription\n: A novella written in the first person in which the author spends the entire story accusing the reader of having stolen her shoe. The novella is divided into twelve (12) chapters, each themed after one of the Zodiacal signs. An overarching theme throughout the text is the 'Seven Stages of Dying', with the writing style reflecting said stages (e.g. pages in the anger sections have been printed in boldface). An epilogue by the author is an \napologia\n where she confesses that she has since found her shoe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nThe Last Words\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nDutch Schultz (as channeled by Talaimal Langeshlem, Ph.D.)\n\n\nLanguage\n: Hindi\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 41,285 meters\n\n\nDescription\n: Purports to be the lengthy record of a s\u00e9ance performed over 40 days between a self-styled clairvoyant and the late 20th century crime-figure Dutch Schultz (whose dying words were in fact transcribed by a police stenographer while he lingered between life and death from a gun-shot wound to the head). The text is identical to the words actually transcribed, but with the addition of considerable material, rendering it intelligible. This \"unexpurgated\" version recounts in heroic form the history of Man from the Bronze age to the beginning of the 21st century. The epilogue chastises the use by other authors of the \"false\" transcript in what it terms to be \"derivative and heretical\" works (notably, the author William Burroughs and the authors Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+History\n\n\n\n\n-History\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nThe Annotated Diaries of Woodrow Wilson, Volume 2\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nEdited by Dr. T.K.L. Conyer\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, Modern\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 1,331m\n\n\nDescription\n: The second of an unknown number of volumes of the private diaries of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, detailing the political battle for Thailand's statehood, his thoughts on the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (granting citizenship to \"The Afflicted\"), and his personal doubts about being named Presbyter of the Imperial States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nMartian-Terran Relations: A Literary Approach\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nSheila McDonald, Ph.D.\n\n\nLanguage\n: Afrikaans\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 1,203,117m\n\n\nDescription\n: A historical review of the history of Earth-Mars relations. Begins with Galileo Galilei's initial observation in 1601 of artifacts on Mars and the Church's reactionary attempts to dismiss and then suppress the discovery. Follows with a survey of the speculative writing of the last four centuries, notably by Descartes, Voltaire, and Mark Twain. Details first contact in 1890 when Mars successfully landed a craft off the coast of South Africa and reaction at the time. Covers the impassioned championing of tolerance by Ray Bradbury and Dr. Martin Luther King, as well as H.G. Wells' xenophobic writing and the House Un-American Activities Committee's influential publication, \nThe Red Menace\n. Concludes with a personal account of the inauguration of the first Martian to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, its subsequent assassination, and the President's historic eulogy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nCannibalism and the Free Market\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nSamuel Clemens\n\n\nLanguage\n: Spanish\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 157m\n\n\nDescription\n: A transcript of the 1968 U.S. Presidential debates between Barry Goldwater and Adlai Stevenson presented as a series of Socratic dialogs. Concerned primarily with the economic costs and benefits of instituting the political programs outlined in \u201cA Modest Proposal\u201d by Jonathan Swift i.e. eating the poor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Language\n\n\n\n\n-Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nAn English-Cetacean Phrasebook\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nVarious\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, Dolphin (presumed)\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 191,214m\n\n\nDescription\n: A short publication consisting of English phrases alongside undeciphered symbols. An examination of the (hypothetically) Cetacean portions have suggested it to be an agglutinative, highly morphologically-rich language devoid of conventional grammatical structure. The English phrases are couched in unusually deferential language reminiscent of feudal Japanese (suggesting that human beings play a subservient role or hold a position of diminished authority).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nThe Joy of Cooking the English Language\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nIrma Sanduski\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, modern\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 101 meters\n\n\nDescription\n: A cookbook describing the proper preparation and cooking of words and phrases in a wide variety of meals. Details include precooking blanching techniques for 'crispy' prepositions, recipes for suffixes (described as a 'fun' treat for children), and a modified adjectival meal sufficient to feed eight. The last chapter of the book is devoted exclusively to what is described as 'gourmet words' (e.g. 'inhospitable', 'tertiary', 'periphery', etc\u2026).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Literary\u00a0Criticism\n\n\n\n\n-Literary\u00a0Criticism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nGrote Werken en Human Leugen\n (trans: Great Work in Human Fiction)\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nGregori Beauchamp\n\n\nLanguage\n: Dutch\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 8,884\u00a0m\n\n\nDescription\n: An encyclopedic analysis of what the author describes as 'the most important' works in fiction. Entries include: Winnie the Pooh, Beowulf, the lyrics of John Lennon, World War 1, Jimmy Carter, Atlantis, and the work of Isaac Newton. In addition, the author devotes a section of the book detailing certain revealed truths hidden within these 'great fictions'. Such revelations include: that Nazi Germany did not win WW2 as is commonly believed, that Polio is a disease and not an imbalance of humors as is currently thought, and that the Moon landing in 1969 was in fact a hoax perpetrated on a sound-stage located on the surface of the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nAhnung Ishskwaday: symbolism of the flame in the poetry of Running Bird Soosaaw'kway\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nDr. Running Bird Soosaaw'kway\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, Ojibwe\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 1,242m\n\n\nDescription\n: The book begins with analysis and praise of the author's own poetry. The short literary critique ends abruptly after several pages and is followed by hundreds of seemingly random illustrations. They range from detailed sketches of indigenous artifacts to unintelligible graphs. At the conclusion of the book, there is a diagram labeled \"Chinoodin Niboowin\" (\"Big Death Wind\"). It depicts a series of dots that resemble the Orion constellation. The left-most star on Orion's belt is circled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n-Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nPrincipia Mathematica II\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nLudwig Wittgenstein (Text), Salavdor Dali (Illustrations)\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, middle \ncirca\n 1250 CE\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 16,357\n\n\nDescription\n: A 1200-page 'sequel' to the three-volume Principia Mathematica written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published in the early 20th Century. The work is an attempt to extend the logical system of the original into a theory of \"surrealist mathematics\" wherein arithmetic can be applied to various heterogeneous objects (134 pages are devoted to the proposition that \"a Yardstick is neither a yard long, nor is it -not- a yard long\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nA game-theoretic analysis of n-dimensional hyperchess and the effect of en-passant rules\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nPaul Spenceton\n\n\nLanguage\n: English, modern\n\n\nDepth of Recovery\n: 574m\n\n\nDescription\n: A generalized analysis of multidimensional chess, proving that Black has a winning strategy involving en passant when the number of dimensions n (n>1) is given by the formula \n$n_x = \\sum_{r=0}^{x} (r^2 - r + 1), \\; x \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n (which includes the case where n=2, i.e. conventional chess). The book does not go so far as to provide the winning strategy, instead only demonstrating that one must exist (i.e. a pure existence proof).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n-Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: \nDe Existentia Divinum Deos\n\n\nAuthor\n: \nErasmus Rutler\n\n\nLanguage\n: Latin, Renaissance\n\n\nDepth of recovery\n: 809,542m\n\n\nDescription\n: A rigorous 2,119-page ontological proof of the existence of God, embedded in the formalism of Number Theory and Set Theory. Assumes the truth of the Riemann hypothesis and the falsity of the continuum hypothesis (both currently undecided). It follows from God's existence that: He would be omniscient; that there is no more powerful being than God; that God cannot act contrary to His own will; and that God and the Devil are disjoint 'sets'. Note: no errors in reasoning have yet been discovered by Foundation mathematicians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. SCP-1986's discovery was occasioned by a librarian trying to identify the source of a draft. Measurements indicate that the tunnel consumes roughly 400m\n3\n/h (i.e. a pressure differential of 25Pa (N/m\n2\n) and a draft velocity of 10cm/s). Where the air is being drawn to is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n2\n. One researcher has put forth the evocative comparison that searching the tunnel for a recognizable book is like traversing the real number line in search of the rational numbers.\n\n\n\n\n3\n. The 3-torus is a three-dimensional compact manifold with no boundary. It can be obtained by gluing the three pairs of opposite faces of a cube. (After gluing the first pair of opposite faces the cube looks like a thick washer, after gluing the second pair \u2014 the flat faces of the washer \u2014 it looks like a hollow torus, the last gluing \u2014 the inner surface of the hollow torus to the outer surface \u2014 is physically impossible in three-dimensional space and can only be accomplished in at least four dimensions.)\n\n\n\n\n4\n. Before the librarian who discovered the artifact was (voluntarily) administered an amnestic, he brought to the attention of Foundation personnel a story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges entitled \"The Library of Babel\". It is noteworthy that Borges worked at the same library. He was unable to be interviewed as he died in 1986. The following is an excerpt from that story:\n\n\n\n\u2026These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1985\n | SCP-1986 | \nSCP-1987\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1986\n\" by Requitefahrenheit, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books\u2026\"",
