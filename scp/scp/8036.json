However, SCP-8036 has agreed to willingly remain in the city of Puerto Montt, Chile, near Site-53, on the conditions that it receives a regular audience and remains open to the public. Bi-weekly attendance to SCP-8036 is mandatory for all Class-C and Class-D personnel at Site-53.\n\n\nSpecial Task Force Zeta-C2 (\"Film Buffers,\") formerly assigned to observe, research, and propose potential long-term containment measures for SCP-8036, has been formally disbanded. In the event that SCP-8036 relocates away from Puerto Montt, Field Agent Marcela Reale must be dispatched within seven days to negotiate its return. SCP-8036 is expected to demand additional patronage during negotiations, and the Foundation has authorized patronage demands to be met unconditionally. If further demands are made, Site Director Caroline Vasquez must report to the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8036 is a 29,000-square meter, two-story, 1880-guest capacity modern movie theater, operating under the name \"Living Pictures Theater.\" It is comprised of one lobby, two concession stands, an arcade space with four games, two restrooms, and eight auditoriums\n1\n. Notably absent are any employee-only areas, kitchens, storage areas, or access points to upstairs projection rooms. SCP-8036 has remained in one fixed location since August 9th, 2016. However, prior to Foundation intervention, the theater would spontaneously de-manifest every Tuesday at exactly 12:00\u00a0A.M. relative to its initial location's time zone, re-manifesting in a new, seemingly random location and changing its film and concession offerings in the process. Following Foundation intervention, while SCP-8036 has not yet re-located, its films and concessions still change along the same schedule.\n\n\nWhile SCP-8036 typically shows at least one film per week in line with other international theaters\n2\n, it primarily shows films which are otherwise non-existent, unfinished, or cancelled.\n\n\nHumanoid entities acting as \"employees\" of SCP-8036 exist throughout the building. These entities have not been observed cycling through shifts, entering, or exiting, and appear to spontaneously manifest and de-manifest as needed. \"Employee manifestations\" freely admit to being mere components of SCP-8036, as opposed to independent actors in their own right. By speaking through these \"employees,\" SCP-8036 has demonstrated itself both sentient and sapient. Generally, SCP-8036 is compliant and amicable, but it has demonstrated extreme resistance to explaining its own anomalous properties or to undergoing extended observation.\n\n\nThe first stage of Foundation intervention took place from June 7, 2016 to July 11, 2016. Initially, a single tracking beacon was planted behind a trash can in SCP-8036's front lobby, both to see whether SCP-8036's change in location could be effectively tracked and to see whether items left in the building remain after a relocation event. When this experiment proved successful, Foundation agent Marcela Reale was tasked with repeatedly staying in one of SCP-8036's lobbies overnight during relocation events, tracking its movement, interviewing its \"employee\" manifestations when possible, and documenting its film and concession offerings. The results of this experiment can be seen in Report 8036.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Report\u00a08036-A:\u00a0Week\u00a0One\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK ONE: JUNE 7 - 13\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Vancouver, Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilms Available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\n\nNormative; Action/Adventure Comedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Through the Looking Glass\n\n\nNormative; Fantasy Adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse\n\n\nNormative; Superhero/Action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day the Clown Cried\n\n\nUnreleased/Cancelled; Historical Drama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForest House:\n\nThe House is a Forest\n\n\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Comedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPill Bug Penny\n\n\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapid Onset Parachute Failure\n\n\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Horror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcessions:\n Buttered Popcorn, Hot Dogs, Nachos, Soft Drinks, Chocolate-Covered Raisins, Fruit-Flavored Candies, Frozen Broccoli Florets, Baked Beans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript: Audio Log 8036-A-A\n\n\nDate:\n June 7, 2016\n\n\nAgent on Scene:\n Marcela Reale\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8036 - \"Box Office Employee\" Manifestation\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Hi, there! What can I get for you today?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n Hello, I was actually wondering if you could answer a few questions for me?\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n \u2026I suppose so, since there's no line.\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n Thank you. First and foremost, could I get your name?\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Right now, I'm Living Pictures Theater Vancouver.\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n \nYour\n name. Not the name of the theater.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Living Pictures. I, ah, am the theater. Who else would I be?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n An employee.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n I mean, I \nhave\n employees. They're how I hand out popcorn and talk to people and stuff. \u2026Hey, look at what this one can do!\n\n\nHeavy thud.\n3\n \nAgent Reale stifles a laugh.\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n I see. And\u2026 who was this employee of yours \nbefore\n it\u2026 started working for you, as it were?\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n What? Nobody. I made it myself. I'm sorry, did you think I \nabducted someone?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n Oh. \u2026I apologize. I think I just made some incorrect assumptions.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Do most theaters you go to kidnap people?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n Most theaters I go to aren't alive.\n\n\nBrief silence.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Then how do they know what movies to show?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n \u2026Right. On that topic, I have a few questions about this theater in specific. You mentioned that, \nright now\n, you're Living Pictures Theater Vancouver.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n That's what it says on GPS.\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n But, yesterday, you were located in Brazil.\n\n\nBrief silence.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n How did you know about that?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n I'm a traveling film student. I've heard word about a magic movie theater, and I've been trying to cross paths with it for a while.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n \nA film student!\n Of course! It all makes sense now. And you've heard of me?\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n I have. I know you move in the middle of the night once a week, but I don't know how or why.\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n The \nhow\n is a bit personal, if I'm honest. The \nwhy\n, though\u2026 I just haven't found an audience to call home. I try to go where the people are, but nothing's stuck yet.\n\n\nAgent Reale:\n I suppose that makes sense. In that case, could I just get one ticket to \nThe Day the Clown Cried\n, please?\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n You really are a film student, aren't you? That'll be in Auditorium Six!

First, this movie theater is \none sapient entity,\n or at the very least behaves like one. There's no way for me to be sure, of course, but I honestly don't think it's lying to me about anything - it seems to be pretty upfront about what it is, even if it's disappointingly hesitant to answer the \"how\" question. Maybe that'll get better with time?\n\n\nThe good news is, it buys my cover story completely, and it's probably not going to be very difficult to get it to talk in the near future. The bad news is, there's no way I'm going to be able to sleep in the lobby Tuesday night without it realizing what I'm doing. I'm going to have to figure out some way to spin that.\n\n\nI've got seven days before this place jumps again, and I want to try to watch all seven of its current movies in this time. So far, I've seen \nThe Day the Clown Cried\n, which made \nme\n cry, and \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\n, which there was nothing wrong with. Nothing the Foundation would be interested in, I mean. It's a \nbad\n movie.\n\n\nTouch back soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Log: Marcela Reale\n\n\nJune 10, 2016\n\n\nHey, it's Marcela again. New info on the theater: the thing's a \ntotal dork.\n I don't think it's very used to repeat visitors, and everything it knows, it knows through movies. I'm having a lot of fun.\n\n\nI've now watched two of the titles we can't find anywhere else - \nPill Bug Penny\n and \nRapid Onset Parachute Failure.\n Both were\u2026 charmingly amateur? I don't know how else to say it; they felt like they were made by somebody who really loves movies but hasn't had any formal schooling in the craft. The edit was sloppy, the dialogue a bit stiff, but everything came across \nearnest.\n Really funny, too. I think the theater might be making them on its own, somehow.\n\n\nI'm halfway to Tuesday. I think I'm just going to have to be straightforward with it; let it know I want to stay the night and travel with it. I'll touch back with you then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript: Audio Log 8036-A-C\n\n\nDate:\n June 13, 2016\n\n\nAgent on Scene:\n Marcela Reale\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8036 - \"Box Office Employee\" Manifestation\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-8036:\n Marcela!

This is the easiest mission I've ever done, and I get to do it from \nItaly.\n Practically a vacation!\n\n\nLiving Pictures Theater's still affable, and at this point I think it's safe to say it poses absolutely no danger of any kind whatsoever. A few of its concession offerings are \nweird\n, but they've all tested safe for human consumption so far. I've been having popcorn for lunch for three days.\n\n\nSo, yeah, harmless, but I'm also not sure exactly how we're going to contain the thing. Haven't been able to get it to share how it teleports around yet, and at this point I feel sorta rude for asking, so I'm going to give it a rest for a while. Also, I'm pretty sure the building exterior is \nactually indestructible.\n All the wear and tear seems entirely cosmetic, and I haven't been able to so much as pick up a rock by the front door. It's like it's glued in place. I'm not going to test that any further, though; someone else can handle that. But please don't.\n\n\nI've measured the thing, too. 29,000 square meters; pretty small for a theater. Thing is, Living Pictures \nnoticed me doing it\n, and asked what was up. I panicked, and said I wanted to draw it. So\u2026 now I gotta go out and get some nice sketch paper and pencils. I don't even really know where to \nstart\n with that, but I'm writing it off as an expense of the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Log: Marcela Reale\n\n\nJune 17, 2016\n\n\nI did the drawing! I'm not an artist, but I think Living Pictures appreciated it anyways.\n\n\nStill no ideas on containment measures, but relations are going real well. I've decided that this theater is my friend now. Maybe we could get it to stay at Site-53 willingly? I'm sure it would understand if I asked!\n\n\nIn the meantime, though, don't worry, I have a cover story and I'm still sticking to it.

And yet, the longer her proposed \"Object Relations Procedures\" have sat at my desk, the longer I have found myself wondering who or what we are actually meant to be protecting.

And why is it so difficult to accept that there may be a difference?\n\n\nSCP-8036's anomalous properties pose no clear threat to itself, the Foundation, or humanity. With that in mind, all containment procedures are now unauthorized. I understand some may question my authority to make this decision.

    "description": "SCP-8036 is a 29,000-square meter, two-story, 1880-guest capacity modern movie theater, operating under the name \"Living Pictures Theater.\" It is comprised of one lobby, two concession stands, an arcade space with four games, two restrooms, and eight auditoriums1. Notably absent are any employee-only areas, kitchens, storage areas, or access points to upstairs projection rooms. SCP-8036 has remained in one fixed location since August 9th, 2016. However, prior to Foundation intervention, the theater would spontaneously de-manifest every Tuesday at exactly 12:00\u00a0A.M. relative to its initial location's time zone, re-manifesting in a new, seemingly random location and changing its film and concession offerings in the process. Following Foundation intervention, while SCP-8036 has not yet re-located, its films and concessions still change along the same schedule.",
