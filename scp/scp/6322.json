Personnel conducting testing on SCP-6322 must do so inside a specialized chamber rated at Sound Transmission Class 50 or higher, and are required to wear protective active noise canceling equipment and to cover skin when handling the object, even in its inactive state.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6322 is a sphere of unidentified gemstone measuring 10cm in diameter. When SCP-6322 comes into contact with human skin for longer than 3 minutes, the object emits a 115 decibel ringing sound. Organic creatures in a .5km radius of the object who hear this sound without protective equipment experience rapid lung consolidation\n1\n and die after 1-5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0unread\u00a0message\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's it.

Foundation operatives successfully rerouted the package containing SCP-6322 to Sloth\u2019s Pit, Wisconsin, where it was to be recovered by Unit 87 of Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (\u201cPony Express\u201d) and returned to Dr. Franklin Hays, head of the SCP-6322 project. Captain Daniel Byrne of Mobile Task Force Delta-5 (\"Front Runners\") was sent to oversee transport of SCP-6322 back to Site-19. Unit 87 was chosen as the first point of contact due to Site-87 being the largest and closest Foundation site, as well as the Sloth's Pit postal warehouse being specially equipped for similar scenarios.\n\n\nAttached Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText\u00a0messages\u00a0between\u00a0Captain\u00a0Byrne\u00a0and\u00a0Delta-5\u00a0Agent\u00a0Tim\u00a0Miranda\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKill me.\n\n\nok\n\n\nMiranda, you would not believe these people\n\n\nare you at 87\n\n\nI'm at 87 babysitting Alpha-4\n\n\nwhy\n\n\nBig MCD thing coming in.

At 5:10pm, the warehouse is evacuated under pretext of a minor gas leak. MTF Alpha-4 U87 agents Baxter, Buckley, Singh and Little are stationed inside the warehouse alongside MTF Delta-5 Captain Byrne. Agent Baxter advises Capt. Byrne to stand in the center floor of the warehouse. Capt. Byrne is the only agent equipped with a firearm and full tactical armor. Six Chaos Insurgency agents, Designated Agents A-F, arrive at the warehouse at 10:42pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Transcript]\n\n\nCamera 1\n\n\nInsurgency agents infiltrate the warehouse and begin to search the building.\n\n\nInsurgency squad leader (designated Agent A) sees Capt. Byrne and engages. Byrne ducks behind cover and returns fire.\n\n\nWhile Byrne has the Insurgency agents distracted, Agents Baxter and Little lock and bar all exit doors. The main floor of the warehouse has no windows.\n\n\nAgent Singh turns off lights and activates the warehouse conveyor belt system.\n\n\nGunfire slows, Byrne and Insurgency agents express confusion.\n\n\nBaxter and Little climb onto the moving conveyor belts.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 2\n\n\nInsurgency squad leader instructs others to equip headlamps. Byrne does the same.\n\n\nAgent C approaches one of the ramp belts in search of Byrne or other Foundation agents.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nAgent Buckley rolls a ball of steel wire across the floor of the warehouse.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 2\n\n\nByrne exchanges fire with Agents D and F and does not notice Agent C\u2019s approach.\n\n\nBaxter jumps to a lower conveyor belt behind Agent C and hits him in the back of the head with a wooden baseball bat.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, B, D, E, F]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nSingh catches the rolling ball of steel wire.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 2\n\n\nBy the time Byrne sees Agent C collapse, Baxter has already jumped to a new conveyor belt.\n\n\nBaxter pulls a fire extinguisher off a wall mount and drops it onto a horizontal conveyor belt before disappearing into the upper section of the warehouse.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nAgents B and E search the warehouse floor for the package.\n\n\nSingh and Buckley pull the wire taut, tripping both.\n\n\nAgent E regains their footing and Agent B drops their primary firearm.\n\n\nAs Agent B reaches for the gun, Little jumps off a conveyor belt above them and lands directly on their back.\n\n\nKeeping one foot on the back of Agent B\u2019s neck, she kicks Agent E in the chin.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 2\n\n\nByrne fires from behind cover and hits Agent D in the shoulder. Agent F reloads.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 1\n\n\nAgent A has disengaged and is searching the warehouse.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nLittle wrenches Agent E\u2019s gun from their hands, kicks it away across the warehouse floor, and lifts Agent E fully off the ground.\n\n\nLittle slams Agent E, now unarmed, onto a horizontal conveyor belt and jumps on after them.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 2\n\n\nByrne runs for cover closer to Agents D and F\u2019s position while F is reloading.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nAgent B stands up and draws a pistol, aiming at Singh.\n\n\nBuckley throws a loop of steel wire around Agent B\u2019s neck and squeezes.\n\n\nSingh grabs the fire extinguisher off a nearby conveyor belt and sprays it into Agent B\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D, E, F]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera 1\n\n\nAgent A finds the storage room containing SCP-6322. He aims at the lock.\n\n\nByrne hears Agent A blow the door open, but cannot pursue as Agent F begins firing again. Agent D draws a pistol in their left hand.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 4\n\n\nAgent E and Little fight barehanded on the conveyor belt.\n\n\nLittle lands a punch to Agent E\u2019s stomach. Agent E retaliates with an elbow.\n\n\nLittle swings again, Agent E blocks and headbutts her.\n\n\nShe stumbles back. Her nose is bleeding. Agent E steps back onto another ramped conveyor belt, gaining higher ground.\n\n\nLittle wipes her face and follows.\n\n\nAgent E draws a large tactical knife from their belt.\n\n\nLittle suddenly hits the deck, dropping flat onto her stomach.\n\n\nThe conveyor belt carries them underneath the platform of another belt, the back of Agent E\u2019s head impacting the metal.\n\n\nAgent E is knocked off the conveyor belt and falls to the concrete floor below.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D, F]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera 1\n\n\nByrne shouts something.\n\n\nBaxter, seen walking on one of the upper belts, shouts something else and laughs.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nBuckley and Singh leave Agent B tied up, and disperse in separate directions.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 1\n\n\nAgent A spots Baxter and fires.\n\n\nBaxter dodges, looking around for an escape route.\n\n\nAgent A fires again, opening the storage room door behind him as he does.\n\n\nAgent A ducks into the storage room and closes the door behind him.\n\n\nBaxter shouts down to Byrne, who points to Agents D and F, who are still pinning him down.\n\n\nBuckley yells across the warehouse to Baxter, producing a baseball from her jacket pocket.\n\n\nShe winds up and throws the ball hard.\n\n\nBaxter swings his bat, and Agent F\u2019s head snaps backward. Agent F collapses.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D]\n\n\n\n\nAs Agent D tries to rouse Agent F, Byrne closes the distance and hits him with the butt of his gun.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: A]\n\n\n\n\nBaxter shouts and points toward the storage room door.\n\n\nBaxter pauses to insert earplugs as Byrne takes position to kick in the door.\n\n\nByrne kicks the storage room door open.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 5\n\n\nInside the storage room, Agent A is holding SCP-6322 in one bare hand, the other aiming his pistol at Byrne.\n\n\nByrne raises his gun.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 3\n\n\nIn the warehouse, Singh activates the ceiling sprinklers and begins rapidly flickering the lights.\n\n\n\n\nCamera 5\n\n\nAgent A fires and misses.\n\n\nByrne fires and misses.\n\n\nSCP-6322 nears its active state.\n\n\nBaxter and Little run past Byrne into the storage room.\n\n\nBaxter swings his bat and knocks Agent A\u2019s pistol from his hands.\n\n\nLittle bodyslams Agent A, tackling him backwards into the wall.\n\n\nAgent's A's mask is knocked off, revealing him to be Delta-5 agent Tim Miranda.\n\n\nSCP-6322 flies out of his hand.\n\n\nBaxter catches SCP-6322 and immediately throws it to Buckley, who stands in the doorway holding a cardboard box full of packing peanuts.\n\n\nBuckley catches SCP-6322 in the box and folds it closed.\n\n\nLittle headbutts Miranda twice, knocking him unconscious.\n\n\n\n\n[Remaining Insurgency Agents: none]\n\n\n\n\nByrne sits down on the floor and rubs his hands down his face.\n\n\n[End Transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n All six Insurgency agents remanded to Foundation custody.

Dangerous object, possible\u2026 violent intervention? Baxter: \u2018Course we are! \u2018S why I wore my heavy duty gear! Byrne: Your heavy duty- now? You\u2019re wearing it right now? Baxter: Sure am, guy. 2 Byrne: That? That\u2019s your gear? Baxter: Steel toe shoes. And listen! [Agent Baxter raps against his chest. It makes a hollow knocking noise] Baxter: Get to use my fancy bulletproof vest. Even though we don\u2019t really like guns. Byrne: You don\u2019t like guns. Of course you don\u2019t like guns\u2026 Baxter: No guns. We try to get everybody out alive, enemies too. Byrne: That's insane. You realize that's insane, right? I'm gonna kill some CI's if I have to. Baxter: Not so long as I'm still honorary Captain, you're not. [Captain Byrne and Agent Baxter stare at each other.] [Agent Baxter smiles.] Baxter: But I\u2019ll tell ya, really looking forward to working with ya! We\u2019ll get that box taken care of, yes sir. [Captain Byrne says nothing for several seconds] Byrne: Baxter, listen. I\u2019m gonna be honest with you. I\u2019m from Delta-5, based out of Site-19. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of us. We deal with REAL issues. We solve REAL problems. When it comes to leading your team, I\u2019m not gonna tell you what to do, just know that if need be, we can have a backup team of\u2026 better prepared agents to help out. Baxter: \u2018Preciate it, but between you and me, we\u2019ve never needed more than the five of us. Four of us now, I suppose. Pretty capable when it comes to the post. Little's a real heavy hitter, Buckley throws a wicked fastball, and Singh might be small but she knows the warehouse like the back of her hand. Byrne: What does pitching a fastball have to do with- with anything? Baxter: Comes in handy sometimes. Byrne: Alright, Agent Baxter. This has been\u2026 informative, but I have other business I need to attend to. I\u2019ll be in touch. Baxter: \u2018Djeet? Byrne: \u2026I beg your pardon? Baxter: It\u2019s 6:30, wanna go for some food? A beer? Byrne: I think I\u2019m just going to go back to my hotel. [End Log]",
        "I'm becoming increasingly certain that every last one of these poor fucks is going to die. oh no theyre not that bad are they They barely have armor. They don't even use guns. yikes I'm going to have to carry this operation myself or it's going to be easy money for the Insurgency how many on the team? Five counting me. no guns? really? Their weird leader says they \"don't like them\" well the insurgency does",
        "[Begin Log] Byrne: Alright, Baxter. I think we need to talk strategy. Baxter: Oh, no worries, bud! We\u2019ve got a real good one already. Byrne: Do you? Because I haven\u2019t heard anything about that. Baxter: \u2018S because it ain\u2019tcher job, is it? You\u2019re here to get it back to Nineteen, aren\u2019t ya? Byrne: Yes, but it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re going to need all the help you can get. Baxter: Oh-kay, if you really want to help so bad, you\u2019re welcome to come on by. So long as you don\u2019t get in our way, \u2018s a horse apiece to me. Byrne: I\u2019m trying to save your lives, you folksy bastard. The Insurgency aren\u2019t polite and they don\u2019t play nice. You don\u2019t even have armor. Baxter: Whoa there, guy. No need for name calling. We don\u2019t need armor, it slows ya down. Gotta keep \u2018er movin\u2019 in our line of work. You\u2019ll see. [Agent Baxter pats Captain Byrne\u2019s shoulder] Baxter: We might not be so much like other Task Forces, but we know what we\u2019re about. And things don't work the same here as they do where you're from. Byrne: Elaborate. Baxter: Let's say we've got quite the home field advantage in our neck of the woods. 'Specially in that warehouse.

        "VIDEO TRANSCRIPT Date: 3 November 2012 Note: The package containing SCP-6322 arrived with the last shipment at approximately 4:30pm. At 5:10pm, the warehouse is evacuated under pretext of a minor gas leak. MTF Alpha-4 U87 agents Baxter, Buckley, Singh and Little are stationed inside the warehouse alongside MTF Delta-5 Captain Byrne. Agent Baxter advises Capt. Byrne to stand in the center floor of the warehouse. Capt. Byrne is the only agent equipped with a firearm and full tactical armor. Six Chaos Insurgency agents, Designated Agents A-F, arrive at the warehouse at 10:42pm.",
        "[Begin Transcript] Camera 1 Insurgency agents infiltrate the warehouse and begin to search the building. Insurgency squad leader (designated Agent A) sees Capt. Byrne and engages. Byrne ducks behind cover and returns fire. While Byrne has the Insurgency agents distracted, Agents Baxter and Little lock and bar all exit doors. The main floor of the warehouse has no windows. Agent Singh turns off lights and activates the warehouse conveyor belt system. Gunfire slows, Byrne and Insurgency agents express confusion. Baxter and Little climb onto the moving conveyor belts. Camera 2 Insurgency squad leader instructs others to equip headlamps. Byrne does the same. Agent C approaches one of the ramp belts in search of Byrne or other Foundation agents. Camera 3 Agent Buckley rolls a ball of steel wire across the floor of the warehouse. Camera 2 Byrne exchanges fire with Agents D and F and does not notice Agent C\u2019s approach. Baxter jumps to a lower conveyor belt behind Agent C and hits him in the back of the head with a wooden baseball bat. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, B, D, E, F] Camera 3 Singh catches the rolling ball of steel wire. Camera 2 By the time Byrne sees Agent C collapse, Baxter has already jumped to a new conveyor belt. Baxter pulls a fire extinguisher off a wall mount and drops it onto a horizontal conveyor belt before disappearing into the upper section of the warehouse. Camera 3 Agents B and E search the warehouse floor for the package. Singh and Buckley pull the wire taut, tripping both. Agent E regains their footing and Agent B drops their primary firearm. As Agent B reaches for the gun, Little jumps off a conveyor belt above them and lands directly on their back. Keeping one foot on the back of Agent B\u2019s neck, she kicks Agent E in the chin. Camera 2 Byrne fires from behind cover and hits Agent D in the shoulder. Agent F reloads. Camera 1 Agent A has disengaged and is searching the warehouse. Camera 3 Little wrenches Agent E\u2019s gun from their hands, kicks it away across the warehouse floor, and lifts Agent E fully off the ground. Little slams Agent E, now unarmed, onto a horizontal conveyor belt and jumps on after them. Camera 2 Byrne runs for cover closer to Agents D and F\u2019s position while F is reloading. Camera 3 Agent B stands up and draws a pistol, aiming at Singh. Buckley throws a loop of steel wire around Agent B\u2019s neck and squeezes. Singh grabs the fire extinguisher off a nearby conveyor belt and sprays it into Agent B\u2019s face. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D, E, F] Camera 1 Agent A finds the storage room containing SCP-6322. He aims at the lock. Byrne hears Agent A blow the door open, but cannot pursue as Agent F begins firing again. Agent D draws a pistol in their left hand. Camera 4 Agent E and Little fight barehanded on the conveyor belt. Little lands a punch to Agent E\u2019s stomach. Agent E retaliates with an elbow. Little swings again, Agent E blocks and headbutts her. She stumbles back. Her nose is bleeding. Agent E steps back onto another ramped conveyor belt, gaining higher ground. Little wipes her face and follows. Agent E draws a large tactical knife from their belt. Little suddenly hits the deck, dropping flat onto her stomach. The conveyor belt carries them underneath the platform of another belt, the back of Agent E\u2019s head impacting the metal. Agent E is knocked off the conveyor belt and falls to the concrete floor below. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D, F] Camera 1 Byrne shouts something. Baxter, seen walking on one of the upper belts, shouts something else and laughs. Camera 3 Buckley and Singh leave Agent B tied up, and disperse in separate directions. Camera 1 Agent A spots Baxter and fires. Baxter dodges, looking around for an escape route. Agent A fires again, opening the storage room door behind him as he does. Agent A ducks into the storage room and closes the door behind him. Baxter shouts down to Byrne, who points to Agents D and F, who are still pinning him down. Buckley yells across the warehouse to Baxter, producing a baseball from her jacket pocket. She winds up and throws the ball hard. Baxter swings his bat, and Agent F\u2019s head snaps backward. Agent F collapses. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: A, D] As Agent D tries to rouse Agent F, Byrne closes the distance and hits him with the butt of his gun. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: A] Baxter shouts and points toward the storage room door. Baxter pauses to insert earplugs as Byrne takes position to kick in the door. Byrne kicks the storage room door open. Camera 5 Inside the storage room, Agent A is holding SCP-6322 in one bare hand, the other aiming his pistol at Byrne. Byrne raises his gun. Camera 3 In the warehouse, Singh activates the ceiling sprinklers and begins rapidly flickering the lights. Camera 5 Agent A fires and misses. Byrne fires and misses. SCP-6322 nears its active state. Baxter and Little run past Byrne into the storage room. Baxter swings his bat and knocks Agent A\u2019s pistol from his hands. Little bodyslams Agent A, tackling him backwards into the wall. Agent's A's mask is knocked off, revealing him to be Delta-5 agent Tim Miranda. SCP-6322 flies out of his hand. Baxter catches SCP-6322 and immediately throws it to Buckley, who stands in the doorway holding a cardboard box full of packing peanuts. Buckley catches SCP-6322 in the box and folds it closed. Little headbutts Miranda twice, knocking him unconscious. [Remaining Insurgency Agents: none] Byrne sits down on the floor and rubs his hands down his face. [End Transcript]",
