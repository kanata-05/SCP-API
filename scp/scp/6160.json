No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-6160 under any circumstances. The guest bedroom door and the basement have been sealed shut with concrete.\n\n\nAny personnel who enter the basement are considered lost. No efforts to retrieve them will be made.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6160 is a two-story residential home located in Hexgan, Nevada. Although the property itself does not showcase inherent anomalous properties, it has been documented as being a hotspot for non-descriptive\n1\n anomalous phenomena to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContextual imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6160's non-descriptive anomalous properties manifested shortly following the purchase of its residing property by its owner, Agatha Blythe. Beneath SCP-6160 is an underground tunnel believed to extend several kilometers into the earth. The full extent of SCP-6160 has not been measured, as all personnel who enter it are eventually lost.\n\n\nThe corpse of Agatha Blythe was found near the entrance of the basement. Her body exhibited signs of extreme weakness, malnutrition, and dehydration, suggesting death via continuous, non-stop overexertion.\n\n\nThe initial investigation of her death by authorities led to the discovery of the tunnel system beneath SCP-6160. After several officers were lost, Foundation agents embedded within law enforcement reported the anomaly, prompting the implementation of containment procedures.\n\n\nAgatha Blythe's mobile device contained several dozen audio files, many shared with her close family. Notable excerpts have been listed below, having been scanned and cleaned by both the Department of Infohazards and the Department of Tactical Theology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n11:23\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nHey mom! Got that new place we were talking about. I know you've been annoying me about my old neighborhood, so I finally managed to move out.\n\n\n \n\nYeah, it's not exactly in the best state. But, I see a boatload of potential that more than makes up for it!\n\n\n \n\nIt's two bedrooms, one bathroom. Then obviously the kitchen, living room/dining room area, backyard, and a pretty big lawn!\n\n\n \n\nIt's perfect. No idea why the previous owners sold it. Again, great neighborhood, a bit spacious, and not that far of a walk from the store.\n\n\n \n\nGotta be ghosts.

After a week of my own renovation, I finally managed to make the kitchen look great, the wallpaper you suggested really makes it pop.\n\n\n \n\nAfter that, I went ahead and cleaned up the bathroom, and then started on the basement. This damn- \ndarn\n place was neglected for way too long, the drywall is chipping, some of the floorboards in the guest bedroom are dented.\n\n\n \n\nPlace used to have some bad termites.

The past tenants really messed this place up. Carved some stuff into the floor, had a ton of wooden figures, which, I just want to say, look really valuable to just leave behind, and this incredibly gross looking meat pile, I'm gonna send a pic real quick\u2026\n\n\n \n\nThere we go.\n2\n It felt super fleshy, almost made me throw up. Picked it up with some gloves, then immediately chucked it in the bin. I would've called you earlier, but\u2026 yeah, you know why.\n\n\n \n\nIf people did actually think there were ghosts here, I might have to actually hire a priest. Even through my gloves, it felt just\u2026 gross. Disgusting.

Found this book under it, the last people who lived here were absolute lunatics, I tell you.\n\n\n \n\nTossed it in the trash as well, tied up that bag and chucked it into the dumpster without a second thought. I'm not a skeptic, but it's like\u2026 you know? Just weird. Just \nweird\n.\n\n\n \n\nContacted the dudes who sold it to me, they can't tell me about the last people who live here. Either they can't, or they don't want to admit they had a bunch of crackheads in this place until I came along. Hope that I scared them off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n08:52\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nUh, hey mom\u2026 alright, so\u2026 I had a weird dream last night, and I'm sending this to you right as I woke up, can't remember it but I just heard something.\n\n\n \n\nI can't remember what it said, but I just\u2026 felt it, you know? Like\u2026 (Pause) I don't know. I don't know\u2026\n\n\n \n\nHope that I'm not losing my mind\u2026 I need to get my carbon monoxide detectors checked, Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n11:44\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nProbably was just a weird fever dream, I didn't hear anything last night, which is certainly a low bar.\n\n\n \n\nIn other news, uh\u2026 I went down into the basement again, realized I have so little room, and the walls are incredibly thin. Got some approval to extend it. Even if I've got another two years until that degree with engineering finishes, I'll be sure to put what I have to use.\n\n\n \n\nDidn't actually \ntell\n you about the dream, it's starting to come back a bit.\n\n\n \n\nIt was uh, dark. Dark, wet, and\u2026 some part about it just broke me to my core. I think I was\u2026 somewhere? How on earth do I describe an emotion\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n19:55\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nAfter chipping away from the walls, I heard that damn voice again. It felt like it was so weak, I couldn't help but feel bad for it. I can barely remember what it looked like, though. Maybe I'll take some lucid dreaming exercises\u2026\n\n\n \n\nI'm planning on working upstairs some more, but as it turns out extending a basement is a lot of work. Will keep you updated.\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the following audio clip, Agatha is crying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n03:12\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nOh god, oh god\u2026 I heard it, it was what I wanted, but\u2026 but\u2026 it felt so \nreal\n.\n\n\n \n\nI\u2026 I was sitting, in\u2026 in a cave. It was so dark and damp, only light was a single, dying lamp. I saw \nit\n standing right in front of me; it was a rotting, dirtied corpse. thinking about it still makes me want to throw up. Worms were writhing out of its face and arms, god\u2026 I saw holes in its skin and legs, peeling away and filled with soil. Before I could even say anything it spoke to me, I swear I can still hear it ringing through my head.\n\n\n \n\n(Pause.)\n\n\n \n\n\"Every waking hour, bugs, worms, all sorts of pests crawl into my every orifice and chew away at my flesh. When they are finished, it grows back hours later. I have no way to stop this. Please, please.\" It begged. Every goddamn word that came out was followed by a pained whistling as a giant hole was gaping in its throat.\n\n\n \n\n\"They left me here to rot. They buried me within the earth as, they hated me. They thought I would grant them wishes when I was powerless. Please, help me.\" It extended a skeletal hand, roaches falling off of it and onto my feet. I was just paralyzed, and all I could do was raise my own. The second we touched, I woke up.\n\n\n \n\nI knew it was just a dream, but it felt too real to not mean something. I'm going to work on the guest bedroom. I love you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n17:13\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nWent to expand on the walls a bit. Realized that I could spend the time I'm already down here to make a panic bunker.\n\n\n \n\nSure, it's going to be a bit more money. But, think about how much I'll save in the event of an apocalypse when I'm sure the big bunker industry will start charging everyone else tooth and nail for a bunker in their house.\n\n\n \n\nHaven't had a dream about him for a few nights. Maybe it means I'm overworking myself. After hollowing out a wall a little bit, I realized that this just feels\u2026 natural? Yearning for the mines, hah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30/OCT/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n09:51\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nH.O.A. got on my ass again. This time because, \"I've been blessed with a beautiful lawn, but I'm letting it turn into a jungle.\" when it's grown barely a few fucking inches. Had to tell them I was busy fixing up the place.\n\n\n \n\nSeems I've been neglecting that part, though. I'll give it a trim later. Just need to finish this bunker.\n\n\n \n\nFucking H.O.A., man. Oh wait- is this thing on?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/NOV/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n17:31\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nAnother night, and I saw him again. It's been hours but I can't get him out of my mind. Woke up at seven, and its\u2026 its four. Fuck.\n\n\n \n\nI was in that same cave again. And he stood in front of me. I- I fell to my knees, staring into his empty eye-sockets. Even in this broken, rotting state, he was still able to cry. His tears were red, small maggots fell out of it and into my mouth. I couldn't throw up, they wriggled and squirmed around, going down my throat. Eventually, he spoke once more.\n\n\n \n\nHe gagged, and then said, \"The soil around me has been forced into my lungs. I cannot breathe; fungal colonies have sprouted within my bones, their spores are infecting my flesh, my every organ.\"\n\n\n \n\nAfter that, he coughed, spores fell onto my face, and almost immediately they started to grow. I felt as if I was him, every inch of my body was rotting against my will.\n\n\n \n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\n \n\n(Pause.)\n\n\n \n\nThen my alarm went off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/NOV/2003\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nDepartment of\n\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n7:13\n \nlalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala\n \nTactical Theology\n\n\n\n\nSorry for the sudden call last night, I was just\u2026 I'm having a hard time falling asleep, I keep worrying that I'll close my eyes and see him again.\n\n\n \n\nWorking more on the house, and then some more on the bunker. Forgot it should be a bit deeper, fitting all the necessary commodities. I'll call you in the morning, I love you.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The rest of the following transcripts were not sent to any persons.

The past tenants really messed this place up. Carved some stuff into the floor, had a ton of wooden figures, which, I just want to say, look really valuable to just leave behind, and this incredibly gross looking meat pile, I'm gonna send a pic real quick\u2026 There we go. 2 It felt super fleshy, almost made me throw up. Picked it up with some gloves, then immediately chucked it in the bin. I would've called you earlier, but\u2026 yeah, you know why. If people did actually think there were ghosts here, I might have to actually hire a priest. Even through my gloves, it felt just\u2026 gross. Disgusting. Washing this place to hell and back.",

Found this book under it, the last people who lived here were absolute lunatics, I tell you. Tossed it in the trash as well, tied up that bag and chucked it into the dumpster without a second thought. I'm not a skeptic, but it's like\u2026 you know? Just weird. Just weird . Contacted the dudes who sold it to me, they can't tell me about the last people who live here. Either they can't, or they don't want to admit they had a bunch of crackheads in this place until I came along. Hope that I scared them off.",

I can't remember what it said, but I just\u2026 felt it, you know? Like\u2026 (Pause) I don't know. I don't know\u2026 Hope that I'm not losing my mind\u2026 I need to get my carbon monoxide detectors checked, Christ.",

In other news, uh\u2026 I went down into the basement again, realized I have so little room, and the walls are incredibly thin. Got some approval to extend it. Even if I've got another two years until that degree with engineering finishes, I'll be sure to put what I have to use. Didn't actually tell you about the dream, it's starting to come back a bit. It was uh, dark. Dark, wet, and\u2026 some part about it just broke me to my core. I think I was\u2026 somewhere? How on earth do I describe an emotion\u2026",

It felt like it was so weak, I couldn't help but feel bad for it. I can barely remember what it looked like, though. Maybe I'll take some lucid dreaming exercises\u2026 I'm planning on working upstairs some more, but as it turns out extending a basement is a lot of work. Will keep you updated.",

I\u2026 I was sitting, in\u2026 in a cave. It was so dark and damp, only light was a single, dying lamp. I saw it standing right in front of me; it was a rotting, dirtied corpse. thinking about it still makes me want to throw up. Worms were writhing out of its face and arms, god\u2026 I saw holes in its skin and legs, peeling away and filled with soil. Before I could even say anything it spoke to me, I swear I can still hear it ringing through my head. (Pause.) \"Every waking hour, bugs, worms, all sorts of pests crawl into my every orifice and chew away at my flesh. When they are finished, it grows back hours later. I have no way to stop this. Please, please.\" It begged. Every goddamn word that came out was followed by a pained whistling as a giant hole was gaping in its throat. \"They left me here to rot. They buried me within the earth as, they hated me. They thought I would grant them wishes when I was powerless. Please, help me.\" It extended a skeletal hand, roaches falling off of it and onto my feet. I was just paralyzed, and all I could do was raise my own. The second we touched, I woke up. I knew it was just a dream, but it felt too real to not mean something. I'm going to work on the guest bedroom. I love you.",

Realized that I could spend the time I'm already down here to make a panic bunker. Sure, it's going to be a bit more money. But, think about how much I'll save in the event of an apocalypse when I'm sure the big bunker industry will start charging everyone else tooth and nail for a bunker in their house. Haven't had a dream about him for a few nights. Maybe it means I'm overworking myself. After hollowing out a wall a little bit, I realized that this just feels\u2026 natural?

It's been hours but I can't get him out of my mind. Woke up at seven, and its\u2026 its four. Fuck. I was in that same cave again. And he stood in front of me. I- I fell to my knees, staring into his empty eye-sockets. Even in this broken, rotting state, he was still able to cry. His tears were red, small maggots fell out of it and into my mouth. I couldn't throw up, they wriggled and squirmed around, going down my throat. Eventually, he spoke once more. He gagged, and then said, \"The soil around me has been forced into my lungs. I cannot breathe; fungal colonies have sprouted within my bones, their spores are infecting my flesh, my every organ.\" After that, he coughed, spores fell onto my face, and almost immediately they started to grow. I felt as if I was him, every inch of my body was rotting against my will. \"Please.\" (Pause.) Then my alarm went off.",
