The topic of these videos discuss questions SCP-2089-1 failed to respond to, references to other blogs, and subjects pertaining to SCP-2089's followers. In 48% of recorded videos, SCP-2089-1 will attempt to commit suicide, with only 11% of those attempts being successful. Following videos indicate no physical harm inflicted onto SCP-2089-1.\n\n\nAny follower who regularly views content related to SCP-2089-1\n1\n becomes an instance of SCP-2089-2. All instances of SCP-2089-2 re-post and create new content related to SCP-2089-1 whenever possible. Instances of SCP-2089-2 are noted to post content indicating a marked prejudice against SCP-2089-1. Some of the content includes:\n\n\n\n\nComments expressing dislike towards SCP-2089-1\n\n\nFan art depicting SCP-2089-1 being physically harmed\n\n\nEncouraging SCP-2089-1 to commit suicide.\n\n\n\"Anti-Blogs\" established by followers to expose others to SCP-2089-1 related content.\n\n\n\n\nAs of 9/25/20\u2588\u2588, SCP-2089 has 10,872 followers.\n\n\nInterview Log:\n\n\nThe following is an interview of a subject (referred to as D-90327) conducted by Junior Researcher Roger \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The subject was exposed to SCP-2089-1 related content for two weeks. Note that the subject has expressed disliking towards explicit content prior to exposure.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher:\n Hello, D-90327. I will be interviewing you today.\n\n\nD-90327:\n Ok.\n\n\nResearcher:\n How do you feel about SCP-2089-1?\n\n\nD-90327:\n [shrugs] Don't like him.\n\n\nResearcher:\n What is it that you particularly don't like about him?\n\n\nD-90327:\n I told you. I don't like him.\n\n\nResearcher:\n Ok, fine. Why do you think others might dislike SCP-2089-1?\n\n\nD-90327:\n For shits and giggles, mainly.\n\n\nResearcher:\n What would you say is the motive behind this hatred?\n\n\nD-90327:\n [chuckles] For fun. It's more like a \u2026 well, I guess like a high, right?\n\n\nHead Researcher:\n Interesting. Why do you think\u2026\n\n\nD-90327 takes out a piece of paper from the back of his pocket. Words are written on the paper. Half of it is written is ink, while the rest appears to be written in blood.\n\n\nD-90327:\n Hold that thought, doc. Check out what I made.\n\n\nD-90327 hands over the paper. Upon closer inspection, it is a poem titled \"Fuck John\".\n\n\nResearcher:\n Huh. [holds the paper up to the light] Did you write this in blood?\n\n\nD-90327:\n Oh, yeah. I didn't have a pen, so I just picked at this scab on my arm. [rolls up sleeve] Can you believe it's been there for three weeks? Anyways, considering how many times I picked at this thing, it probably took me three days to make that. I think I can even post it online. What do you think?\n\n\nD-90327 glares at the researcher. A smile slowly spreads across his face.\n\n\nResearcher:\n Uhh \u2026 I'll think about it.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nConclusion:\n The paper was confiscated from D-90327 after the interview. Approval to test if the paper exhibits the same effects of other SCP-2089-1 related content is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2089-01:\n The following is an excerpt recorded from a video posted by SCP-2089-1.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Video\u00a0excerpt\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 is facing the camera\n\n\n\n\nHey guys, it's John here. And today marks our 10,000th follower special. To celebrate, we're going to first ask some questions by some of my fans. First question.\n\n\n Asked by Anonymous: Have you drank bleach today? \n\n\nGood question, anon. I'll get back to you on that later. Next question.\n\n\n Asked by ExplodingPopTart: Hi. I really love your blog. I'm just wondering: How do you deal all the haters? \n\n\nOh, my haters. Should I even call them that? How about fans? I live for them. But I really know they \nlove\n me. Next question.\n\n\n Asked by Anonymous: How do we know you're not an attention whore? \n\n\nHi again, anon. I promise I'll answer you later. Next question.\n\n\n Asked by Aryanne: Disgusting as fuck. I want to kill all of you. And nuke whoever decided to make this shithole of a god damn blog. \n\n\nI agree with you on a lot of things. Don't kill everyone, though. You can kill me, and I'll be ok with it. [chuckle] Next question.\n\n\n Asked by Anonymus: Why are you a faggot? \n\n\nYou know, now that I think about it, I've always been a faggot. Not a bundle of sticks, but rather a legitimate, internet faggot. To answer your question, I owe my faggotry to my amazing followers.\n\n\nBut I would especially like to thank anon. Thanks anon. I can always rely on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2089-02:\n The following is a list of notable SCP-2089-1 related content taken down by Foundation Agents.\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-2089-I-374\n\n\nDate Posted:\n 06/14/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n A video recorded by SCP-2089-1 featuring itself using a circular saw to cut off its left arm. SCP-2089-1 proceeds to hold its severed limb with its remaining arm and waves towards the camera. This continues for 33 seconds until SCP-2089-1 passes out, presumably from blood loss.\n\n\nNotable Comments:\n\n\n\n\n MrBRASIL: What kind of idiot uses a circular saw? \n\n\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-2089-I-789\n\n\nDate Posted:\n 07/23/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n A piece of art painted by an instance of SCP-2089-2.

I drove my car all the way upstate to reach the foot of Bitch Mountain. Bitch. Freaking. Mountain. I'm not even kidding you. Search that shit up right now. \n\n\n I'm not even mad. WP, BRASIL. \n\n\n\n\nNotable Comments:\n\n\n\n\n MrBRASIL: I killed John already. I stuck my rod into him, then cut off his balls. Done. \n\n\n Aryanne: Send me a pic. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: Snapchat me. \n\n\n Aryanne: iight \n\n\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-2089-I-1297\n\n\nDate Posted:\n 08/02/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n An image of SCP-2089-1 and another person, presumably an instance of SCP-2089-2. A caption underneath the image reads:\n\n\n\n\nWhoo! Met one of my fans yesterday in person! We were craaaazy, but we had a lot of fun.\n\n\n\n\nNotable Comments:\n\n\n\n\n MrBRASIL: The fuck is this? John, how the hell do you do this? I have your testicles in a jar, and you're here all smiling and shit? Maybe I need to come over there and teach you another lesson. \n\n\n John_\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588_Is_Here: haha you're saying I don't have balls. #iceewutudidthare \n\n\n Aryanne: BRASIL, you fail. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: I'll show you the things right now. Give me a sec. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: Wait, what the hell? They're not here. The jar is here, but it's empty. \n\n\n Aryanne: Blame OP. \n\n\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-2089-I-1339\n\n\nDate Posted:\n 08/04/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n An image of an instance of SCP-2089-2. The person is standing in front of a mountainous landscape. A caption underneath the photo reads:\n\n\n\n\nWent to the address again. And it's Bitch Goddamn Mountain.\n\n\n\n\nNotable Comments:\n\n\n\n\n Aryanne: I don't know what place you went to. I told you it's Bitch Mountain. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: I'm telling you, it was a real place. I found a house. One of those fancy two stories. I barged in and found John cornered up in his room, tapping away on a mac. A fucking mac of all things. \n\n\n Anyway, I came in, did my thing. I cut off his nuts, let him bleed to death. I washed off his nuts and placed them in my jar. Then I drove away. No one said a thing. Aryanne, You have the pic I sent you? \n\n\n Aryanne: Yeah ... I forgot to save it when you sent it to me. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: You dense motherfucker. \n\n\n Aryanne: Whatever. It was John, anyway. I don't want that cluttering up my computer. inb4 I told you so. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: Remind me how John is still breathing? \n\n\n Aryanne: Beats me. Maybe he wants to stay alive? \n\n\n MrBRASIL: I don't get what your saying. \n\n\n Aryanne: John is an entertainer. We can't have him dead. Balls bleeding, yeah. But dead? You'd have to be dense. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: Suppose you have a point. \n\n\n Aryanne: Can you be sure if it actually happened? \n\n\n MrBRASIL: Are you ed? I sent you a pic \n\n\n Aryanne: Nope. Don't have it. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: I'll send the pic. \n\n\n MrBRASIL: I ... lost the pic. \n\n\n\n\nRecovery Log:\n On 09/26/20\u2588\u2588, Foundation Agents used the address obtained from SCP-2089-I-1026 in an attempt to locate SCP-2089-1. Personnel arrived at Bitch Mountain, located in Chesterfield, New York. To date, SCP-2089-1 has not been found.\n\n\nPersonnel recovered several items surrounding the area. Among these items included:\n\n\n\n\nA hooded jacket similar to the one worn by SCP-2089-1\n\n\nKnives, needles and other sharp objects coated in blood. DNA analysis proves that it is from a Caucasian male, estimated to be 18-20 years old.\n\n\nAn unfinished painting of a male figure. Inscribed in blood are the words \"Never die\". DNA analysis confirms that it does not match with the blood found on other objects.\n\n\n\n\nNote from Agent Thompson: To this day, it still baffles me that we were given a concrete address. Our GPS satellites confirmed that the address is in fact, a two story house like the user \"MrBRASIL\" stated. As we drove there the surroundings began to shift from an interstate highway to a dirt road lined with trees. No one even noticed it. When we arrived at Bitch Mountain, it was disheartening.\n\n\nWe received news that the Foundation sent a Mobile Task Force to the same address. A small team was dispatched on a helicopter. However, the same thing happened to them. An Agent reported seeing the landscape change from dense woods to rocky mountains right before her very eyes. To this day, we don't know why this occurs.\n\n\nWe may be dealing with a fad. But it is clear that whoever is behind it doesn't want anyone to interfere.\n\n\nAddendum 2089-03:\n The following is an excerpt of a recorded video posted by an instance of SCP-2089-2.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Video\u00a0excerpt\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 is seen facing the camera inside a dimly lit room. SCP-2089-1 then diverts its attention away from the screen. Note that SCP-2089-1 is wearing a mask in place of its traditional hooded jacket. An unidentified male voice speaks:\n\n\n\n\nYou know what to do?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089 -1 nods. It faces the camera again.\n\n\n\n\nHey everyone. It's John here. By popular request, I will be performing a bit of \u2026 fan service, if you will. [pause] Do I have to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, give me.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 receives a piece of wire tied into the shape of a noose. SCP-2089-1 then walks towards the ceiling fan located the center of the room. A chair is below the fan, allowing SCP-2089-1 to climb up and attach the noose to the fan. SCP-2089-1 then places its head inside the noose. SCP-2089-1 kicks the chair beneath it, allowing itself to hang.\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 is heard gagging and gasping for several seconds. The fan holding the noose breaks, and SCP-2089-1 falls to the floor with the fan on top of it. A male figure is seen approaching SCP-2089-1.\n\n\n\n\nYep. That'll do.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure tosses the fan to the side to look at SCP-2089-1. Closer observation indicates several cuts on the neck of SCP-2089-1, presumably from the wire. SCP-2089-1 continues to gag, coughing up blood as it speaks.\n\n\n\n\nI \u2026 I did it.\n\n\n\n\nThe unidentified male turns SCP-2089-1's head over, revealing a fracture in its skull.\n\n\n\n\nWow. A clean break. I'm saving this.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure pulls out a mobile device and takes a picture of SCP-2089-1.\n\n\n\n\n[cough] Are you pleased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Very.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I'm [cough] p-p-pleased.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure picks up SCP-2089-1 and places it into a chair. The figure then pushes the chair towards the camera so that the viewer can get a closer image of SCP-2089-1.\n\n\n\n\nThis is John. Say hi, John.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi. [cough]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 coughs up blood. A splatter stains the upper left corner of the screen.\n\n\n\n\nJohn is an entertainer. You followers expect torture, rape, castration, suicide. And John gives you exactly that. Isn't that right, John?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2089-1 nods. The figure spins the chair around to reveal the back of SCP-2089-1's head. The camera zooms in on SCP-2089-1's skull fracture.\n\n\n\n\nWe keep John alive. Because he is an entertainer. The closer to the brink of death, the better. But we keep him alive. [pause] Now, don't get me wrong. We laugh, joke, have fun. But a dead entertainer is not an entertainer at all. Allow me to demonstrate.\n\n\n\n\nThe camera lens zooms out. Shuffling is heard in the background for about a minute. SCP-2089-1's head is struck with a blunt object, furthering opening up its wound. SCP-2089-1's brain is exposed. Blood is seen pouring out of the wound.\n\n\n\n\nExciting, isn't it? Don't worry, he's very much alive. Just give him time.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure pushes SCP-2089-1's body off the chair and proceeds to sit on it. The figure glances at the body lying on the floor.\n\n\n\n\nThank you, John. I'm honestly sorry for you having to deal with that amateur. I promise you won't get hurt again.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure faces the camera. The camera zooms in so that the figure's face occupies the screen.\n\n\n\n\nAnd in case you haven't realized it, this is directed towards you, MrBRASIL. Bitch Mountain is where he stays. \nHe belongs to me.\n\n\nI told you so, didn't I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a comment in response to the video:\n\n\n\n\n ExplodingPopTart: What the hell is wrong with you sick, demented people? You're telling me you ENJOY seeing an innocent person get brutally murdered? \n\n\n Aryanne: \n\n\n >Follower of John's Blog \n\n\n >Offended by Content \n\n\n Get a load of this guy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
