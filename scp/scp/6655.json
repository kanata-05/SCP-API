Information regarding SCP-6655 is to be restricted to Site-55, which has undergone noospheric quarantine and placed under lockdown until further notice.\n\n\nArchived Description:\n SCP-6655 is a highly contagious, infohazardous concept discovered by Memetics Researcher Morgan Riley on 3/10/2017. While the specifics are still under active research, SCP-6655 is extremely antithetical to conventional human thought. For further details, consult the testing log.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Archived Testing log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 1\n\n\nSubject:\n D-43724\n\n\nProject lead:\n Researcher Morgan Riley\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject introduced to SCP-6655 infected media and quarantined under standard information censor practices.\n\n\nResults:\n Within 6 hours, D-43724's communications became a vector for SCP-6655. After 24 hours, subject's behavior showed major deviations from known personality, including:\n\n\n\n\nDecreased empathy\n\n\nIncreased proclivity for violent acts\n\n\nNegligible attempts at self-preservation\n\n\nIncomprehensibility\n\n\n\n\nAfter 48 hours, D-43724 was sedated and the test was terminated.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTest Log 2\n\n\nSubject:\n D-43724\n\n\nProject lead:\n Researcher Morgan Riley\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject amnescitized to determine possible countermeasures to SCP-6655 infection.\n\n\nResults:\n Conventional targeted amnestics failed to purge SCP-6655 symptoms from D-43724. Likewise, general amnestics capable of removing all memories after SCP-6655 infection also resulted in failure.\n\n\nAfter extensive testing, a mixture (hence referred to as RMD-6655) of Class D Amnestics, Class X Mnestics, Chlorpromazine and Lithium salts was successful in purging SCP-6655 from D-43724, although long term side-effects including severe photophobia, difficulty forming new memories, confusion, and insomnia make this inpractical as a treatment. The makeup of RMD-6655 can be requested by members of the Memetics Department.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTest Log 3\n\n\nSubject:\n Researcher Morgan Riley\n\n\nProject lead:\n Researcher Morgan Riley\n\n\nProcedure:\n Impromptu test.

I watched as she walked into the blood-lined testing wing and carried out acts I heave at the thought of. I watched for the tiniest sliver of hope until I couldn't bear it anymore. I shouted at her. Begged her, screamed at her to remember - herself, me, anything. Just a glimmer of her outside what They want her to be.\n\n\nThere isn't.
