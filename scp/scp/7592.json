SCP-7592 instances are denoted by their use of multi-colored text, large images, and distinct grammar and spelling issues. While resembling the style of some Foundation notices, a majority of the information presented had no correlation to Foundation workplace safety or procedure. SCP-7592 instances vary widely in subject matter, ranging from nonsequiturs to extremely limited knowledge of the SCP Foundation's operations.\n\n\nAfter a period of 24 hours, SCP-7592 instances will alter in appearance, often with a unique font, text colors, related image, and a new \"fact.\" SCP-7592 instances began manifesting in the lobbies of all Foundation Sites on December 20th, 2022. with all Sites receiving the same signage.

Pending Ethics Committee approval, a major addition would be made to the containment procedures of this anomaly. This update would require all personnel who come into contact with an SCP-7592 instance to ensure they read and fully comprehend the text of the respective instance. This would theoretically guarantee permanent containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7591\n | SCP-7592 | \nSCP-7593\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlaguePJP's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5787\n \n(+282)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8000\n \n(+986)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8598\n \n(+162)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7590\n \n(+153)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5364\n \n(+90)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5593\n \n(+107)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6594\n \n(+122)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7596\n \n(+131)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7593\n \n(+210)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8596\n \n(+274)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5595\n \n(+556)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5596\n \n(+161)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5591\n \n(+131)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7599\n \n(+194)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8590\n \n(+144)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nHOGSLICE Makes A Friend\n \n(+168)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nPLAGUEPJPAGE\n \n(+204)\n \n\u2022",
