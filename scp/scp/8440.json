These include:\n\n\n\n\nCooperation with NASA on a coverup regarding degenerate stars and supernovae within 1000 light years of the Solar System.\n\n\nFull knowledge sterilization at all major space agencies and astronomical institutions,\n1\n including amnesticization of staff and introduction of artificial aversion traumas towards extinction-level events.\n\n\nSeize and replace all instrumentation readings showing the presence of degenerate stars or soft gamma repeaters in Earth's stellar neighborhood\".\n2\n\n\nThe following false narratives must be promoted through the usual channels:\n\n\n\nCatastrophic star collapse activity in the Milky Way (e.g. Gamma-Ray Bursts\n3\n) is both rare and poses no threat to Earth in the near-term future.\n\n\nEarth was last impacted by a Gamma-Ray Burst 445 million years ago.\n\n\nThe consensus understanding of astrophysics is largely accurate and can be relied on to predict stellar phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated 3/31/2022:\n The shuttlecraft that carried the RTM-1 crew that was previously declared MIA must be intercepted once landed. Any survivors recovered must be interned, questioned, nerve-stapled, and given identity-reassignment amnesticization, as per Foundation \"Closed Casket\" protocols.\n\n\nUpdated 4/2/2022:\n All documentation produced regarding SCP-8440 is sealed under Level-5 Classification. Pending further review.\n\n\n\nAs per Ethics Committee guidelines, personnel with insufficient clearance attached to the project before 4/2/2022 will be offered significant financial incentives for accepting voluntary amnesticization.\n\n\nPersonnel found in possession of SCP-8440 materials without authorization are subject to disciplinary action, including amnesticization and summary nerve stapling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources have been directed toward off-planet colonization efforts in the event SCP-8440 \nfails\n to occur.\n4\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8440 is an unknown, astronomical entity that is in between Earth's stellar neighborhood and catastrophic core-collapse phenomena of failed stars. The extent of SCP-8440\u2019s capabilities is unknown, even based on [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSCP-8440-1 refers to degenerate stars located within Earth's stellar neighborhood possessing a rotational axis facing Earth, indicating a GRB targeting Earth had previously occurred. The frequency of SCP-8440 manifesting is estimated based on the discovery of stars matching this description.\n\n\nSCP-8440-2 refers to stars in Earth's stellar neighborhood that possess several key characteristics. These include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n\nTerminal stage stellar behavior.\n5\n\n\nIndications of imminent core collapse behavior.\n6\n\n\nAccelerated progression through stellar lifecycle.\n\n\nObserved, possibly anomalous discrepancies between estimates of stellar mass and gravitational behavior of star.\n\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-8440-2 undergoes a core collapse sequence, it will discharge a stream of energy along a lightyear-wide band with various projected effects on Earth. This ranges from destroying Earth\u2019s biosphere to vaporizing the crust entirely. When this occurs, SCP-8440 will manifest to neutralize the incoming ejected energy.\n\n\nThe nature of core-collapse activity makes it impossible to detect a GRB before its effects have impacted Earth. Manifestations of SCP-8440 have been understood to detect incoming GRB activity aimed at Earth\u2019s stellar neighborhood.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n \nRESTRICTED TO LEVEL 5 PERSONNEL\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0WARNING!\u00a0UNAUTHORIZED\u00a0PERSONNEL\u00a0WILL\u00a0BE\u00a0EXPOSED\u00a0TO\u00a0A\u00a0MEMETIC\u00a0DEFENSE\u00a0AGENT+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0VERIFIED\u00a0-\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002, SCP-8440 was encountered by NASA's satellite repair crew Commander Carlson Vilchez, Pilot Jon Duan, Mission Specialist Adam Yarrow, and Mission Specialist Pearl Makil. In their Repair Telescope Mission, NASA lost communication with the RTM-1 crew which was deemed MIA. In 2022, the RTM-1 shuttle suddenly returned and NASA received its signals and messages, along with one survivor, Carlson Vilchez.\n\n\nThe Foundation intercepted Vilchez before word of his return could be officially released to the public. After enacting a disinformation campaign, the Foundation took Vilchez in custody. Vilchez was unresponsive during the first interview. After 4 months of aided recovery, Vilchez was still unable to disclose anything regarding RTM-1. As of now, he is still in Foundation custody as a Person of Interest.\n\n\nThe Foundation managed to recover any recorded data that the RTM-1 shuttle contained and wiped it from NASA soon after.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1: RTM-1 Recording Logs\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG - 1\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n This audio log reflects the last transmission of the Space Shuttle Hyperion before contact was lost with the vehicle. The transmission was intercepted by Foundation satellites. Source audio was used to generate forgeries to aid in cover-up efforts.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nGROUND CONTROL (Ground officer Tom Priest):\n GC, Hyperion, your air-to-grounds are enabled for the landing count. \n[NOTE: Hyperion had not reentered the atmosphere, and there's no evidence of transmission at this time from Ground Control.]\n\n\nHYPERION (Commander Carlson Vilchez):\n Hyperion to Ground Control, think you've skipped ahead in the script.\n\n\nFLIGHT:\n Flight, Hyperion. Not quite following. No such transmission from GC occurred.\n\n\nDuan:\n What's GC's malfunction?\n\n\nMakil\n: Hey Jon, maybe they're just excited to see you flying in action, What was it you said?\n\n\nDuan\n: Oh, you know what.

Do you mind staying professional until I'm done figuring out how far up shit's creek we are?\n\n\nVilchez:\n You say \nfour\n?\n\n\nYarrow:\n Confirmed. Up is down; north is south; pressure readings could only be higher at the bottom of the ocean. Hell, if the temperature's accurate, we're bathing in the Sun.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Makil, stop jackjawing with Duan and help Yarrow. Duan, I want you in the cockpit ready to make moves in case things get hairy. Hyperion, Flight.\n\n\nFlight:\n Go ahead, Hyperion.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Getting some bugged readings on our end.\n\n\nFlight:\n Bugged?\n\n\nYarrow:\n Flight, MMACs.

I- \n(she halts and lightly chokes until she exhales.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Just take some deep breaths, guys. It's okay. We're okay.\n\n\n(A minute has passed.)\n\n\nVilchez\n We should inform ground control.\n\n\n(Vilchez is heard making her way to the communication receiver.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Hello? Ground control, this is commander Carlson Vilchez. Do you read us, over?\n\n\n(No response.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Makil, what do the instruments say about our CO2 levels?\n\n\nMakil:\n Sir, we \nhave\n no instruments.\n\n\nVilchez:\n \u2026Okay. Color me a born-again believer, Pearl. \n(Forced attempt at laughter.)\n\n\nPearl:\n I-uh\n(clears throat).\n Fuck, what was that? \n(She huffs.)\n At least the life support systems are still functioning, yeah?\n\n\nDuan:\n No, they're not. The power's completely out. Even the lights are off.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Jon, that's \nbullshit.\n What are we breathing? How is this place still lit?\n\n\nDuan:\n Commander, I don't think we're finished with this yet.\n\n\nVilchez:\n What now?

He\u2019s rubbing his eyes while slouching forward.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n This is Commander Vilchez of the RTM-1. Respond, ground control.\n\n\n(Static.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Keep trying. I almost got it.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Ground Control, this is RTM-1. Please, respond.\n\n\n(Static.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Come on.\n\n\n(Vilchez and Makil continue their attempts to communicate to ground control. After a few minutes, Makil hammerfists the panels a few times which startles Vilchesz.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Makil!\n\n\nMakil\n Sorry, I just-\n\n\n(Makil halts her speech suddenly and grips on her chest. She has quick and hoarded breathing while she quivers in her seat. Vilchez hastily leans forward to her and rests his hand on her shoulder to keep her still.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Breath! Breath, Pearl.\n\n\nMakil:\n It hurts- my skin hurts. \n(She groans.)\n Ah! I can\u2019t see! Carlson?! Jon!\n\n\n(From below deck, Duan hears shouting from above. He rushes to the ladder and climbs to the cockpit entrance. Upon seeing Makil\u2019s episode, he gets closer to the pair and stares down at her.)\n\n\nDuan:\n What\u2019s happening?!\n\n\nVilchez:\n I-I don\u2019t know! She keeps saying she\u2019s hurting but I don\u2019t see injuries.\n\n\n(Duan grabs one of her hands. She grips on his hand to the point where Duan grits his teeth. Despite this, Duan lays another hand on top of it.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Pearl? Talk to me.\n\n\nMakil:\n My eyes\u2026 They\u2019re melting! God, help me, please!\n\n\nVilchez:\n You can hear us, right? We\u2019re right here. We\u2019re holding your hands. We\u2019re not going anywhere. You are okay.\n\n\n(Makil screams and thrashes from her seat that she bangs on the panels and even on Vilchez and Duan. Duan goes behind the seat to press down on her shoulders while Vilchez does his best to retrain her wrists next to her legs. She kicks, screams and swears for 2 minutes and 15 seconds until she passes out. Vilchez and Duan slowly remove their hands on her while they are shaking and breathing heavily.)\n\n\nDuan:\n I\u2019ve never seen her like this\u2026ever.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Just keep an eye on her, Jon.\n\n\n(He pats his back and slumps back on his seat. He covers his face with his hand and remains still for about a minute before going back to leaning forward and grabbing the microphone, adjusting knobs and switches from the receivers himself.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I\u2019ll have to figure this out.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 3\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Makil sits alone in the cockpit while she works on the receivers. Duan enters the flight deck and floats behind Makil, sitting on the right seat behind her.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Vilchez is sleeping.\n\n\nMakil:\n Okay.\n\n\n(He silently remains while he watches Makil work.)\n\n\nMakil:\n You need something, Jon?\n\n\nDuan:\n You\u2019ve been working on that for days. Have you eaten anything?\n\n\nMakil:\n I\u2019m not hungry.\n\n\nDuan:\n Not even tired?\n\n\nMakil:\n Nope.\n\n\nDuan:\n Do you at least wanna take a break?\n\n\n(She stops what she\u2019s doing and turns herself to face Duan.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Jon. I appreciate the concern. But unless you\u2019re gonna help me here, let me focus. Please.\n\n\n(Makil readjusts herself and returns her attention to the receivers. The pair sit in silence for a few minutes until the shuttle rumbles. They brace themselves, Duan moving up a seat next to Makil and looking out the window to see what may be causing the turbulence.)\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the front exterior of the shuttle. The frame shows a vague shape of a human male that is covered in an illuminating, white aroma.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Holy- Adam?\n\n\nMakil:\n What?\n\n\nDuan:\n I swear to God, that\u2019s him. Look at the face!\n\n\n(Makil leans closer to the window.)\n\n\nMakil:\n That can\u2019t be.\n\n\n(\u201cAdam\u201d walks to the shuttle, despite there being no surface to walk on. He gets close until he stops 6 meters away from the front of the shuttle. He sits and gently sways his body and his arms low.)\n\n\nDuan:\n The Hell is he doing?\n\n\n(\u201cAdam\u201d halts his movements and extends his arms as if for an embrace and stays in that pose.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Why are you giggling?\n\n\nDuan:\n That\u2019s not me.\n\n\n(A low-pitched noise blares but Duan and Makil do not react to it and continue to stare out the window. The noise steadily gets quieter and the footage captures small trails of red, orange, yellow, blue, and white lights converging above \u201cAdam\u201d. These lights then swirl and orbit one another, then converge little by little. A red dwarf zooms past the shuttle, leaving a streak of fiery red behind as it draws to the convergence. Several more giant stars rush past them and the collection of stars creates this rough-shaped sphere of light. Suddenly, the collection of stars vanishes, as does \u201cAdam\u201d.)\n\n\nDuan:\n My eyes don\u2019t feel cold anymore.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 4\n\n\n\n\n(\nDuan is in Mid Deck, slipping his legs into the bottom half of the space suit.

Mind helping me putting the rest on.\n\n\nMakil:\n For what?\n\n\nDuan:\n I wanna get a better look outside. There\u2019s something out there.\n\n\nMakil:\n Jon, that\u2019s a horrible idea.\n\n\nDuan:\n We can\u2019t stay here forever. And you saw Adam too, right? I think maybe he can help us out.\n\n\nMakil:\n We don\u2019t know if that was even him. Hell, we don\u2019t even know where we are.\n\n\nDuan:\n I can at least help comms. Maybe get something on the exterior.\n\n\n(Vilchez climbs down the ladder and notices the pair. He approaches them.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n What\u2019s happening here?\n\n\nMakil:\n Carlson, help me out here.\n\n\nDuan:\n Commander. I need to go check outside. Get a better idea of what\u2019s out there.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I saw the footage from the other day. And\u2026 I\u2019m going to have to agree with Pearl, here. Something is wrong here. Wherever \u201chere\u201d is.\n\n\nDuan:\n I will literally be right back. I got the cord, you guys can reel me back in if anything happens.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Jon. You\u2019re brave. Always have been. But don\u2019t be stupid.\n\n\nDuan:\n Commander, with all due respect, I\u2019m losing my mind in here. And I can\u2019t just sit around and do nothing. Just- let me try to get some new comms working.\n\n\nMakil:\n Even if it might work, which it won\u2019t. It\u2019s still suicide.\n\n\nDuan:\n It could help us.\n\n\nMakil:\n I\u2019m not gonna lose my fucking friend!\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nMakil:\n And as your friend, Jon. I\u2019m begging you.

I won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\n\n\nVilchez:\n \u2026 You get 10 minutes. Then I\u2019m reeling you back\n\n\nDuan:\n Thank you.\n\n\nMakil:\n You guys suck, you know that?\n\n\nDuan:\n \n(Chuckles.)\n Maybe I\u2019ll go and bring back Jesus and you tell me who\u2019s hotter.\n\n\nMakil:\n Not funny.\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the exterior port side of the shuttle. Duan climbs out from the payload shaft and hooks himself to a reel. He observes his surrounding space with nothing of note happening for 2 minutes. \u201cAdam\u201d manifests in front of him and approaches him with an embrace. Duan does his best to embrace the entity in return.)\n\n\nDuan:\n How are you alive?\n\n\n(\u201cAdam\u201d uses his right arm to cut the cord and vanishes with Duan in a flash of light for the remaining 8 minutes.

He meets up with Makil and Vilchez in the cockpit.)\n\n\nDuan:\n That has to be an elliptical galaxy. It\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\nMakil:\n Scootch. \n(Camera shutters.)\n\n\n\n\n[IC 2006]\n\n\nMakil:\n Got it.\n\n\nVilchez:\n There\u2019s more on our way.\n\n\nMakil:\n Wait what?\n\n\nDuan:\n Take it! Take it!\n\n\n(Makil hastily moves around the cockpit as she tries to take as many photos as she can.)\n\n\n\n\n[NGC 4111]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[NGC 4347]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[M87]\n\n\n \n\n\nMakil:\n This is all I got. We\u2019re moving too fast. \n(Pause)\n Who\u2019s laughing?\n\n\n(The shuttle rumbles again with the low pitch sound blaring. Lights from the interior of the shuttle flicker. The camera glitches and audio distorts for 3 minutes until everything has ceased.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Everybody okay?\n\n\nDuan:\n Good here.\n\n\nMakil:\n Check.\n\n\n(Vilchez turns and looks out the window.)\n\n\nMakil:\n What\u2019s happening?\n\n\nVilchez:\n This can\u2019t be real.\n\n\n(Duan and Makil make their way with them and peer out.)\n\n\n( Footage cuts to the front exterior of the shuttle. Multiple galaxies stretch and twist from their original forms. They collide and are split apart repeatedly to the point where they are more akin to a large, irregular galaxy.)\n\n\n(The new irregular galaxy is stretched once more. Along with several more nebulas with gradience of yellows, blues, greens, reds, purples and whites. All bleeding into one another with the added glittering stars.)\n\n\n(Four, wing-like appendages pressed through the array of colorful stardust. They stretch across through space with no seeming end. The wings leave behind a dust trail while they soar through the cosmos until it dissipate and can no longer be seen.)\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the Flight Deck. The crew are left with an astonished expression. They remain silent for about 4 minutes.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n That was\u2026\n\n\nDuan:\n Fantastical.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 7\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Makil is once again at the Spacelab, however she is not working on the receiver. Instead she is still. Duan approaches behind her and taps her shoulder, startling her.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Oh! Hey Jon.\n\n\nDuan:\n You alright?\n\n\nMakil:\n No, yeah. Just thinking about what happened.\n\n\nDuan:\n Wasn\u2019t that amazing?\n\n\nMakil:\n \n(Chuckles)\n It\u2019s insane is what it is.\n\n\nDuan:\n It\u2019s also a gift.\n\n\nMakil:\n \n(She turns her head.)\n Huh?\n\n\nDuan:\n It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime moment for us. But maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be. Can you imagine what else the little one can do? What he can be?\n\n\nMakil:\n God, maybe.\n\n\nDuan:\n Oh?\n\n\nMakil:\n I\u2019m sorry. Just just slipped out.\n\n\nDuan:\n No, no I think you got the right idea. Why not, right? He saved us from that hellfire. He healed me from those episodes. Showing us wonders in this universe.\n\n\n(Makil remains silent. Duan gets on both his knees and lays his hands on her thighs as he looks up.)\n\n\nDuan:\n You\u2019re still suffering, Pearl. Don\u2019t you want it to stop?\n\n\nMakil:\n I do.\n\n\nDuan:\n Then let me help you. Like you helped me.\n\n\nMakil:\n I didn\u2019t help you.\n\n\nDuan:\n You did, by being there. You were always there.\n\n\n(Duan holds both her hands.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Please, let me do this for you.\n\n\nMakil:\n \u2026Okay. I\u2019m trusting you.\n\n\nDuan:\n You know I have your back.\n\n\n(Sometime later, Duan and Makil ready their suits and exit the shuttle. After 26 minutes, they return to the craft with their suits off.)\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the pair sneaking to the Flight Deck hatch as they try not to wake up Vilchez. By the time they got there, they help each other slip on their space suits and crawl through the hatch.)\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the exterior port side of the shuttle. Duan is the first to exit from the hatch, then Makil. They both wait for a minute until \u201cAdam\u201d manifests in front of them. The entity embraces them both and vanishes in a flash of light. 26 minutes later, Duan and Makil return, this time without their space suits. \u201cAdam\u201d releases the pair and disappears, leaving them to return to the shuttle.)\n\n\n(Footage cuts back to the Flight Deck as Duan and Makil laugh and they make their way back in. Makil bumps their head and Duan helps her out and rubs on the bump. She laughs harder now but Duan tries to shush her. She lays her head on his shoulder while he hugs her.)\n\n\nDuan:\n I told you everything was going to be okay.\n\n\nMakil:\n \n(Giggles)\n Yeah.\n\n\nDuan:\n So how do you feel?\n\n\nMakil:\n My eyes can breathe.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 8\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Vilchez is once again working on the panels. Makil floats and sits onto the seat next to him.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Hey commander.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Pearl? You look better.\n\n\nMakil:\n I feel better.\n\n\nVilchez:\n That\u2019s good. That\u2019s really good. You need something?\n\n\nMakil:\n Just checking up on you. You still have those episodes?\n\n\nVilchez:\n \n(Chuckles)\n Yeah. But what can you do about it right?\n\n\nMakil:\n There is something, actually.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Hm?\n\n\nMakil:\n Duan showed me Adam. And the little one.\n\n\nVilchez:\n You went outside?! Why?! Why did either of you do that?!\n\n\n(Makil\u2019s keeps her relaxed expression.)\n\n\nMakil:\n Carlson, listen to me. When Jon and I were walking on the little one's body, Adam brought me to an angel. She was like the sky, warm and beautiful. She came to me and whispered a verse. \u201cWhen you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you.\u201d\n7\n And look. I\u2019m not burned. The Lord is with us.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Pearl. I don\u2019t know why Jon told you, but I don\u2019t think you're in the right headspace right now. Just\u2026 rest for a bit. We\u2019ll figure out a way back home soon. Promise.\n\n\nMakil:\n Hm. \n(She smiles)\n We\u2019re already home, commander.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Pearl, just stop! I don\u2019t know what Jon put in your head but you- AH!\n\n\n(Vilchez jumps back into his seat. He grabs onto his face and thrashes his body while he screams. Makil\u2019s smile quickly drops as she crouches over to him. )\n\n\nVilchez:\n NO, NO, NO! I\u2019M BURNING! I\u2019M BURNING! HELP ME, GOD, HELP ME!\n\n\nMakil:\n Commander-\n\n\n(Vilchez hits her in the face and she retreats. Covering the spot where it was struck.)\n\n\nMakil:\n \n(Shouts)\n JON! JON GET OVER HERE NOW!\n\n\n(Duan hastily makes his way from Mid Deck to Flight Deck. He goes to Vilchez and does his best to hold his arms and torso down. Makil goes to the back holds back his shoulders on the seat.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Carlson! Listen to me! You\u2019re okay, just listen to my voice.\n\n\n(Vilchez\u2019s screams grow louder and his body gets more erratic.Duan and Makil do their best to hold him down but Vilchez manages to arch his back further up and his breathing gets short and jagged. A Minute later in that position, Vilchez stops his screaming and movement. He slowly returns to consciousness with slow, heavy breathing.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Did- did it happen again?\n\n\nMakil:\n Yeah. You okay?\n\n\n(The crew gets off from Vilchez and he tries his best to collect himself. Vilches slouches forward and covers his face with both hands.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I hit you.\n\n\nMakil:\n It\u2019s okay.\n\n\nVilchez:\n No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\n(The trio stay silent.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I just need a minute.\n\n\nDuan:\n Take all the time you need.\n\n\n(After some time, the crew goes and scatters to different spaces of the shuttle. Vilchez is left alone in the cockpit.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Fuck. \n(Sighs)\n I can do this. I can push through.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 9\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Duan and Vilchez are at their seats, watching the trailing stars passing by them.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Check it out. Another cluster.\n\n\nVilchez:\n I see it.\n\n\n(Both remain silent for 13 seconds.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Do you miss home?\n\n\nDuan:\n Huh? What do you mean?\n\n\nVilchez:\n I mean what I mean, do you miss Earth?\n\n\nDuan:\n Calm down, sir.\n\n\nVilchez:\n \n(Raises voice)\n Why are you telling me to calm down? I am.\n\n\nDuan:\n Okay, okay. Sorry.\n\n\n(They sit in silence again.)\n\n\nDuan:\n Are you okay?\n\n\nVilchez:\n I think I\u2019ve seen enough stars. And these machines. I\u2019m tired, man. I wanna wrestle with my brother, hug my mom, kiss my girl.\n\n\nDuan:\n Mm.\n\n\nVilchez:\n You don\u2019t?\n\n\nDuan:\n To be honest, I got nothing but problems back at home.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Okay, but don't we all? You can always find somewhere else to move.\n\n\nDuan:\n Trust me when I say that there\u2019s not a lot of places for me to go. I\u2019ve looked.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Sorry to hear that.\n\n\nDuan:\n It\u2019s fine. But, I wouldn\u2019t mind staying here.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Here? Jon, what are you gonna do out here?\n\n\nDuan:\n Anything I want. There's freedom. And I always have something to look forward to.\n\n\nVilchez:\n That thing out there?\n\n\nDuan:\n He\u2019s not \u201ca thing\u201d.\n\n\nVilchez:\n Right there. You\u2019ve been obsessed with it since you came back. I hear the things you say from time to time.\n\n\nDuan:\n And?\n\n\nVilchez:\n I\u2019m worried for you. We\u2019ve all been through a lot since it took us and I think\u2026 I think you just wanna see what you wanna see. And you, somehow, convinced Pearl to cope in the same way.\n\n\nDuan:\n And what about what you\u2019ve seen?\n\n\nVilchez:\n I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I don\u2019t know anything. But what I do know is that we\u2019re gonna make it back. And that I want you to both know I\u2019m looking out for both of you.\n\n\nDuan:\n I know. I\u2019m with you too. Thanks.\n\n\nVilchez:\n You're welcome. Just don\u2019t be feeding Pearl any more fantasies.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG - 10\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(Duan is seen with Makil in Mid Deck. He repeats the conversation he had with Vilchez.)\n\n\nDuan:\n That\u2019s what he told me.\n\n\nMakil:\n Are you serious?\n\n\nDuan:\n Yeah. Can you blame him? If anything, it's our fault that he thinks that way.\n\n\nMakil:\n How is it our fault? He chooses to just sit there all day and continue to fix those stupid comms and it's getting him nowhere. And did he forget that he just had an episode?\n\n\nDuan:\n Maybe it gives him something to do. But you\u2019re right. We\u2019re leaving him in pain. How can we call ourselves a team if we\u2019re not going to help each other?\n\n\nMakil:\n Then let\u2019s show him our little one. Heal him like he\u2019s healed us. He won\u2019t have to worry about anything, anymore. We can just be.\n\n\nMakil:\n I agree\u2026 Be honest with me, what do you think will be back for us on Earth?\n\n\n(Makil remains silent for 14 seconds.)\n\n\nMakil:\n A life of constant waiting. A dull, cold life. But for Carlson\u2026 I feel like he\u2019s going to be living a life much worse than ours.\n\n\nDuan:\n Then let\u2019s save our commander.\n\n\n(The pair make their way up to Flight Deck. And go behind Vilchez who is busy with working the receivers. Suddenly, they wrestle with Vilchez in the cockpit as they try to pull him out.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Fuck is wrong with you guys?!\n\n\n(Vilchez kicks Duan in the stomach, but Duan grabs his shirt and yanks him close. Vilchez tries to shove his hands against Duan\u2019s face but he is thrown to the side panels. Makil takes the opportunity and grabs Vilchez\u2019s kicking legs and both carry him out of the cockpit.)\n\n\nVilchez\n Stop! Please!\n\n\nDuan:\n Everything will be alright, Carlson.\n\n\n(Makil lets go of the legs and goes by the hatch to unlock it for them. She quickly makes her way back and helps Duan shove Vilchez through but he scrambles and flails his body, making it difficult for them to hold their grip. Vilchez manages to escape and retreat to the cockpit. Cornered, the duo approaches him.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Why are you guys doing this?!\n\n\nDuan:\n You\u2019re suffering, Carlson. We don\u2019t want that for you anymore.\n\n\nVilchez:\n What?\n\n\nMakil:\n The little one can heal you. From every pain to every discomfort. Anything that would make you feel worse, he can wash it all away. His ancient innocence can keep you warm.\n\n\nDuan:\n Carlson. This is our life now.\n\n\nVilchez:\n No, it\u2019s not! I\u2019m not gonna let that fucking thing take me!\n\n\nMakil:\n The little one just made us feel better. And don\u2019t talk to him that way, he hears you. You\u2019ll make him cry.\n\n\nVilchez:\n I don\u2019t give a fuck, you two need to wake up! What about all your other friends and family? What about your lives?! Does none of that matter now?!\n\n\nDuan:\n You matter to us.\n\n\nMakil:\n We love you, Carlson. Don\u2019t make this harder than it needs to be.\n\n\nDuan:\n Just let it all go. Let the little one hold you as it held us.\n\n\n(Vilchez shakes his head.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n This is crazy. You\u2019re crazy!\n\n\n(Duan and Makil pounce and grab him once more. Vilchez does his best to put up a fight but to no avail. They move him near the hatch again and Makil goes to open it and exit first to help Duan by taking one of Vilchez\u2019s legs and pulling it to her. Duan quickly moves to Vilchez and they both push Vilchez through the hatch.)\n\n\n(The trio exit the shuttle while Vilchez continues to scream until the hatch behind them closes.\n\n\n(Footage cuts to the exterior of the shuttle. Duan pulls Vilchez up, who seems to have ceased. Makil helps push him out while also grabbing onto his pants. They both hold onto Vilchez while waiting for \u201cAdam\u201d to manifest. Once he does, he pulls them all for an embrace and they vanish.)\n\n\n(40 minutes later, Vilchez manifests alone and crawls back through the hatch and into the shuttle. Footage cuts to the Flight Deck as Vilchez opens the hatch and crawls through the interior hatch. Vilchez rests his back on the wall. A white light beams through all the windows, enveloping the interior with light, followed by a low-pitch sound.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n I see you too.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/08/2022, Carlson Vilchez finally agreed to speak to Foundation personnel to disclose any additional information about SCP-8440.\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW - 1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Tyson Gabriel\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Carlson Vilchez\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nGabriel:\n So Carlson, are you feeling better?\n\n\nVilchez:\n Yes. I think so.\n\n\nGabriel:\n Right, then. Can you tell me what happened to your crew in \u201802?\n\n\n(Vilchez laughs.)\n\n\nGabriel:\n Did I say something amusing?\n\n\nVilchez:\n Oh, everything is.\n\n\nGabriel:\n What do you mean?\n\n\n(Vilchez sways his body.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n Everything. Life. It\u2019s so beautiful. More beautiful than what you can imagine. I didn\u2019t get it at first. But I understand now.\n\n\nGabriel:\n What did you understand?\n\n\nVilchez:\n You. Me. Everyone. There\u2019s a spark in us. A glow that none has ever seen before. It\u2019s something that many want but never quite seem to grasp. And there are some that can harness it. Those are the ones that defy reality.\n\n\n(Vilchez stops swaying and fails to contain his laugh. After 4 minutes, he calms down.)\n\n\nVilchez:\n The little one sees it in us too. I think that\u2019s why he undid the Gamma-Ray that hit us, why he chose my crew. I wouldn\u2019t put it past you if the little one just thought of us as pretty-looking bugs it wanted to play with, and maybe that\u2019s true. He\u2019s still so young after all. But those eyes. They said something different.\n\n\nGabriel:\n What was it that you saw?\n\n\nVilchez:\n A dragon, a butterfly, a nebula, a four-pointed star. And yet, he was none of them. It\u2019s hard to remember the details.\n\n\nGabriel:\n Can you tell us what happened to your crew?\n\n\nVilchez:\n The little one helped them let their glow out. They burned.
