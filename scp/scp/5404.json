No making words about boom-boom words on computers or not-computers.\n\n\nIn the time that is now, we are not having smart-knowing about which words go boom-boom. To keep everyone being safely alive, please make not normal \ntalk\n style.\n\n\nWords and bunches of words that are in red are known to go boom-boom. Remember to never ever assemble them.\n\n\nRemember to always make \ntwo\n \"boom-boom\" with an in-between hyphen. Other styles of making this meaning will go boom-boom.\n\n\nNew Thing:\n Sometimes safe is made to not be safe. Always test with boom-boom computer.\n\n\nWhat It Is:\n \"Boom-Boom \nwords\n\" (\"letter-clusters\") is a thing that makes some bunches of letter-clusters make a boom-boom when you put some letter-clusters by other letter-clusters, but only when the thing you are making about is boom-boom letter-clusters themselves. Sometimes just a single cluster of letters will go boom-boom.\n\n\nOnly when making mouth sounds or making symbol mouth sounds will letter clusters go boom-boom. Reproducing old before-times mouth sound records is safe, but only goes \na certain amount\n of safety. All Foundation computer-symbol letter-clusters are saved right at the time of making, so if you see red bunches of letter-clusters, it means mistake happened.\n\n\n\n\nTrying-Things-Out Log:\n We have computer arms make button-hits on computer letters to try out what makes boom-boom. What you can look at under this is just a small bunch for example to show how not-safe boom-boom letter-clusters are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to make happen\n\n\nHappened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecial containment procedures\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns pec ial conta inment proced ures\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$p3cial c0ntainm3nt pr8cedure5\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspesh cont pro\n\n\nGood\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\necialspay ontainmentcay ocedurespray\n\n\nBad\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexplosive\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nword\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsentence\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetonate\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboom\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboom-boom\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe careful\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe making safe\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nword\n\n\nBad\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Thing:\n\n\n\n\nBoom-boom letter clusters made by don't-like-us group.
