As a result, potential containment vectors are entirely unknown, both due to the scarcity of known incidents, the inability to reproduce said incidents, and the random nature in which these incidents are triggered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Elephant Seal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8599 is the anomalous phenomenon leading to the manifestation and subsequent, often violent, death of an elephant seal (\nMirounga angustirostris\n).\n\n\nWhile the exact parameters that trigger a successful SCP-8599 event are inconsistent and not fully understood, the following has been proven regarding this phenomenon:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8599 solely affects Foundation personnel;\n\n\nThe elephant seal involved in an SCP-8599 event is non-anomalous;\n\n\nThe elephant seal involved in an SCP-8599 event is created by the anomaly, as in, it is not being teleported from the active population;\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8599 events are triggered just before the death of exactly one member of the Foundation's personnel. It is believed that the appearance of the elephant seal is an attempt to stop the incident from transpiring, however, these deaths will still occur regardless of the hapless seal's manifestation. SCP-8599-activating events range from incredibly mundane to extremely anomalous, and attempts to replicate exact parameters in order to reproduce the phenomenon have unilaterally failed.\n\n\nAs of documentation, no discernible force or entity has been identified as the source of SCP-8599. The leading hypothesis by Site-17 researchers posits that this phenomenon is a form of failed divine intervention.\n\n\nThe following is an abridged record of notable SCP-8599 events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nCause of Death/SCP-8599 Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ. Researcher Kelly Graham\n\n\nSmoke inhalation after an elephant seal blocked an exit during a fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kevin Grossman\n\n\nAn elephant seal landed on him at a top speed of 440\u00a0m/s, protecting the corpse from a falling piece of debris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanitor Orlan Di Leonardo\n\n\nStruck by a truck. An elephant seal materialized between the vehicles and was reduced to a fine, red mist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSattelite Technician Isaac Lowry\n\n\nVacuum Exposure after his spacesuit unexpectedly depressurized and the torso section burst open when an elephant seal manifested within the suit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Marianne Warren\n\n\nDrowned after being caught in a riptide and being held underwater beneath an elephant seal, which also drowned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot Garrett Bench\n\n\nCrushed to death when an elephant seal manifested atop him, extinguishing an ongoing cockpit fire. The jet subsequently crashed in a residential area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDir. Grover Morris\n\n\nBlood loss resulting from the shrapnel of a crashed fighter jet piercing through Morris' window, an elephant seal, and Morris' upper body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Lloyd Jones.\n\n\nLaunched into a brick wall at high speed by an elephant seal. The seal was then shot by the bullet meant for Jones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Javier Martinez\n\n\nBlunt force trauma resulting from an elephant seal performing CPR, consisting of it repeatedly slamming its head on Martinez's chest, after he began choking on a peanut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8598\n | SCP-8599 | \nSCP-8600\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlaguePJP's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nPlague's Proposal\n \n(+373)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8594\n \n(+125)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8592\n \n(+177)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5591\n \n(+131)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5364\n \n(+90)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7595\n \n(+214)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6596\n \n(+306)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6594\n \n(+122)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8590\n \n(+144)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7592\n \n(+224)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7599\n \n(+194)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8597\n \n(+180)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5594\n \n(+101)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5592\n \n(+102)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8591\n \n(+139)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nHOGSLICE Makes A Friend\n \n(+168)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nPLAGUEPJPAGE\n \n(+204)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8599\n\" by PlaguePJP, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
