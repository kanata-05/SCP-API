Signal strength and structure are to be continuously measured through sensors with available bandwidth at Site-57, with embodied receivers at Site-12 transcribing contents at medically allowable intervals. When the source of SCP-8375 is identified, all responsible parties are to be detained pending containment procedure updates. Cranial stasis facilities may be utilized if SCP-8375 broadcasts prove biological in origin.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8375 is a psychic broadcast accessible by ~98% of baseline humanity and is interpretable via specialized equipment or minor neurosurgical procedures. SCP-8375 transmits across the N\nz\n-band (typical of spillover, although other qualities appear manufactured), with its frequency having undergone minor fluctuations since first broadcast in 2018.\n1\n Broadcast strength has similarly fluctuated over time, but modern samples, collected worldwide, remain within the 30.1-30.5 dBp range. Unlike signals replicable by Foundation technology, SCP-8375 is unaffected by shielding materials or nulling techniques.\n\n\nThe contents of SCP-8375 resemble a traditional numbers station when processed through conscious receivers, combining numerals, words, and phrases of varying theme and complexity. All receivers report these sequences as being spoken in their own voice. No cryptography linked to known groups of interest has been identified within SCP-8375, although a correlation between spikes in its complexity and significant geopolitical events existed until 2039. Such events include:\n\n\n\n\n2019 - Library Doorstep Incident\n\n\n2025 - Lemnos Hostage Crisis\n\n\n2026 - BITTER BLOSSOM, BITTER PILL, BITTER ALE incidents\n\n\n2028 - Beginning of the Korean Reunification War\n\n\n2029 - United Nations Lunar Withdrawal\n\n\n\n\nAdditional events can be found in FARSCIM product FRD-0161239-12E.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8375-A (Original Discovery):\n SCP-8375 originally came to attention via Parawatch, a forum for enthusiasts of paranatural phenomena. The below excerpt is from a thread titled \"Getting Strange Interference\" which contained 983 individual posts before being closed by moderators. User \"LentiL\" was identified, interviewed, and subsequently employed by a Foundation front organization in light of their unique methodologies.\n2\n\n\n\n\nkenning7\n 06/03/2036 (Sun) 23:01:55 #39514043\n\n\n\n\nUSER WAS BANNED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLentiL\n 06/03/2036 (Sun) 23:07:06 #39511597\n\n\n\n\nYou're a dumbass.\n\n\nDo you even listen to modern stations? Not any Cold War snoozes that are somehow still running, not plain-sight nonsense (hi, Twitch \"bots\"), I mean real shit. You're probably thinking \"sure I boot up my sneaky spook computer and goof around on the dark web all the time.\" That's why, I reiterate, you're a fucking dumbass.\n\n\nHave you opened your third ear, bro? Have you sat in a deprivation tank and held your breath until passing out? Have you obliterated your ego with more than cleaning supplies huffed in daddy's basement? Have you (and I know the answer is no) stared at the sun until it burns away what people don't need to see? Nope. That's why you're wasting time lecturing people who know better. CIA? DIA? NSA? Are three-letter agencies your favorite because four would be too many to spell? The \nIlluminati\n? Grow a pair and build \nthis\n.\n3\n\n\nSet it up in the emptiest field you can reach. Eat about an ounce of cockroaches (raw is best, but you'll probably blend them), smoke some weed, and start working the connector into your sinuses. Go up your nose, around through your throat, whatever. It's deep enough when it feels like it's prodding behind your eyes. You'll hear the words soon after.\n\n\nThen again, you might as well keep bragging about whatever baby bitch toy you bought on mommy's card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkenning7\n 06/03/2036 (Sun) 23:20:03 #39514043\n\n\n\n\nUSER WAS BANNED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLentiL\n 06/03/2036 (Sun) 23:27:00 #39511597\n\n\n\n\nwah wah wah\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8375-B (Signal Analysis):\n Evaluations of SCP-8375 within the Foundation's Psychic and Psychological Community of Practice have identified distinct elements within the signal, with tests able to recreate its structure in human-receivable form. The following table breaks down a typical strain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment\n\n\nClassification\n\n\nSize\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQAG-G\n\n\nOpen Channel\n\n\n0.5%\n\n\nPrimes top-level receptors for individuals able to process SCP-8375.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQAG-P\n\n\nOpen Channel\n\n\n3%\n\n\nPrimes second-layer receptors with key information (incoming signal size, density, repeat frequency, trauma capacity, polarity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQOF-A\n\n\nMessage Packet\n\n\n6%\n\n\nMain body of the SCP-8375 \"numbers station\" broadcast.

No major geopolitical events were noted within the time frame where a relationship to SCP-8375 complexity is typically observable, nor has a relationship been identified since. Whether this was an accidental shift, a deliberate one, or a transfer between responsible persons of interest remains under debate.\n\n\nFollowing concerns over information returned in the RIN-P packet from Foundation employees, a task force was established in 2042 to evaluate potential leaks of classified information.
