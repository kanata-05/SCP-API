Photo by \nDr. Takeshi Yamada\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-075\n\n\nObject Class\n: Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures\n: SCP-075 is contained in a 1\u00a0m x 1\u00a0m x 1\u00a0m Level-4 corrosion-resistant container, which must be contained in a secure chamber with equal corrosion resistance. The absolute humidity of the chamber may not exceed 1% at any time. Medicinal-grade desiccants must be available at all times in order to maintain this level of humidity. If the humidity of SCP-075's chamber ever exceeds 1%, all personnel are to be evacuated immediately and the site will be locked down until the humidity is reduced to acceptable levels.\n\n\nAll personnel who enter SCP-075's containment chamber must wear MOPP Level 4 protection. Injection tests, as well as any test which involves an aqueous solution, are strictly forbidden. If any such solution comes into contact with SCP-075, the area will be immediately locked down and flooded with desiccant until the humidity is brought back to acceptable levels. Evacuation of personnel remaining in the area is prohibited.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-075 resembles a large snail 20\u00a0cm in length, 13\u00a0cm in width, and 15\u00a0cm in height, with a muscular foot resembling a six-fingered, clawed hand. SCP-075 is exceptionally heavy, with a mass of approximately 860\u00a0kg, a property that is not understood. Desiccation is the only known means of containing SCP-075, as it will enter a dormant state when nearly completely dry.\n\n\nWhen not desiccated, SCP-075 moves at incredible speeds for its size and mass. It adopts the behavior of a predator, jumping at and drenching its prey in a highly caustic base solution secreted from pores on its foot. These secretions are more corrosive than any substance known to terrestrial science. Due to SCP-075's aggressive behavior when active, this compound cannot be harvested. No material completely resistant to its corrosive power has been found.\n\n\nAddendum 075-F:\n Attempts to harvest SCP-075's secretions must be approved and supervised by all on-site Level 4 personnel. However, approval of said personnel cannot override the standing order to not introduce any liquid solution to SCP-075, including its own secretions.\n\n\nAddendum 075-G:\n A cup of SCP-075's secretions was successfully harvested by using \nSCP-294\n. Testing is underway to determine what substances, if any, are immune to its corrosion. Testing is also underway to determine why the cup provided by \nSCP-294\n is immune to the substance's effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-074\n | SCP-075 | \nSCP-076\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-075\n\" by Unknown author, rewritten by Aelanna, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
