Personnel wishing to access SCP-2208 must obtain permission from the Site Director. Instances of SCP-2208-A are to be cataloged and placed in non-hazardous storage.\n1\n Full-body protection must be worn at all times when testing SCP-2208.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2208 is a 2-quart \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-brand stainless steel saucepan. The inside is coated in a nonstick polymer believed to be polytetrafluoroethylene.\n2\n The handle has been modified to include a USB standard-A receptacle, \nthe purpose of which has yet to be determined\n investigation of which is pending.\n3\n SCP-2208 does not transfer heat as a stainless steel saucepan should, and heat testing up to 2,300\u00b0C has been unable to warm its surface.\n\n\nWhen a human subject makes skin contact with any part of SCP-2208, there is a 29% chance the subject will be transformed into a saucepan (SCP-2208-A) in a process that takes ~0.8 seconds. Instances of SCP-2208-A match SCP-2208's appearance, apart from the lack of USB receptacle; they are otherwise non-anomalous. Subjects unaffected by initial contact with SCP-2208 are able to safely handle it thereafter.\n4\n A predictive pattern of SCP-2208's effects has yet to be determined.\n\n\nInterview 2208-01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Nu\u00f1ez\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Alvarez-Monta\u00f1a\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-2208 was recovered from the home of J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Nu\u00f1ez of Westway, Texas, USA, along with 145 other saucepans believed to be instances of SCP-2208-A. The home was raided after a four-month federal investigation into the disappearances of more than \u2588\u2588\u2588 individuals from the area. Foundation agents embedded with the FBI were alerted to SCP-2208's anomalous properties after 3 federal and 1 Foundation agent were converted into instances of SCP-2208-A. The object was recovered by a federal agent immune to its effects, and Ms. Nu\u00f1ez was questioned by the Foundation. Interview translated from Spanish.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Alvarez:\n What can you tell us about the saucepan we recovered from your home? The one that transforms people.\n\n\nMs. Nu\u00f1ez:\n God created man in His own image.\n\n\nAgent Alvarez:\n I don't understand.\n\n\nMs. Nu\u00f1ez:\n God does not make mistakes.\n\n\nAgent Alvarez:\n I don't know what you mean. Maybe you can explain why you haven't been changed? I'm sure you've touched it. Is there a reason why some are changed and some aren't?\n\n\nMs. Nu\u00f1ez:\n You and I, we are unworthy. I brought more and more faithful to him, yet still am I forsaken. \n[begins to cry]\n Why am I not worthy?\n\n\nAgent Alvarez:\n Make sure you tell the Bureau about that later. \n[pauses]\n Are you sure you don't know anything more about how it works, or why?\n\n\nMs. Nu\u00f1ez:\n God does not make mistakes, Mister Agent. If God were to change, His image would change, also.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Ms. Nu\u00f1ez was remanded to FBI custody after a standard containment period and administration of amnestics. She cooperated with authorities in locating the remains of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 individuals not accounted for by SCP-2208-A instances and was charged in their deaths.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2208-02:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, while performing routine testing on SCP-2208's USB receptacle, Junior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588 was simultaneously recharging an MP3 player via USB on the test computer, in violation of testing procedures. After testing was complete, Junior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588 discovered a new file on his device, named \"un_w721g.mp3\" and remanded his MP3 player to custody for study. A transcript of the audio file follows.\n\n\n\n\n[File begins with 4 seconds of white noise, followed by a surprised feminine voice.]\n\n\nOw! What? What's this? Hello? Is that you guys? Listen, I haven't had anything to work with in like two months. Is that why you missed my last couple paychecks? It's been a while. I'm not a charity here! I've got expenses! And all these other people you sent in, they're starting to smell. It's been a while. Look, either you get me some new material, you pay me, or you find yourself a new employee. Once I figure out how to get out of here, anyway. It's been a while.\n\n\n\n\nContainment procedures are currently under review.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
