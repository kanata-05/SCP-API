A research team led by Dr. Azure Waters is to prioritize study of the \u201ccore\u201d of SCP-7986\u2019s anomalous effects, and ways to counteract it.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7986 is an underwater city, aesthetically similar to a modern town found in Greece when viewed with remote cameras, however details on its structure beyond the superficial appearance are unclear.\n\n\nSCP-7986 appears to house several humanoid creatures; however, closer viewing is not achievable due to SCP-7986\u2019s primary anomalous effect. When a human being comes within a 400 kilometer radius of SCP-7986, they will be overcome with the distinct urge to swim to SCP-7986, which will result in the subject drowning themselves in an attempt to reach it. At present, only one individual has been retrieved from this state, and was only able to remark that \u201chumanity should have never left the sea,\u201d even when pressed by researchers to disclose more information. This individual was subsequently amnesticized and released.\n\n\nInformation gathered from expeditions using remote viewing devices have revealed that the center of SCP-7986 holds a large temple-like structure. Hume readings around this area drop noticeably. The source of this appears to be a large, silver orb that spans approximately 20 feet in diameter, located inside of SCP-7986\u2019s temple.\n\n\nBased on several Hume readings taken throughout SCP-7986, it is theorized that this object, hereby known as SCP-7986-1, is the source of SCP-7986\u2019s properties, including its dangerous cognitohazardous effects. It potentially holds the ability to grant the group that cares for it incredible \u201cluck,\u201d including the insurance of a safe travel through the ocean, and an increased likelihood for unlikely, positive outcomes.\n\n\nDisturbingly, SCP-7986\u2019s radius of effect seems to have increased in the past few years, prompting a reevaluation of containment procedures and overall approach.\n\n\nRetrieval of SCP-7986-1 is to be considered a priority.\n Retrieval of SCP-7986-1 would not harm its current caretakers, and would potentially stop SCP-7986\u2019s anomalous effect from spreading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0You\u00a0have\u00a0one\u00a0new\u00a0message.\u00a0Show\u00a0message?\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0message?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Azure Waters (\noif.PCS|sretaWeruzA#oif.PCS|sretaWeruzA\n)\n\n\nTo:\n Agent Xavier James (\noif.PCS|semaJreivaX#oif.PCS|semaJreivaX\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n Expedition help\n\n\nBody:\n\n\nI need to do an expedition on SCP-7986 very soon research isn\u2019t going as fast as people want and it\u2019s scary.

That\u2019s not too terribly suspicious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Azure Waters (\noif.PCS|sretaWeruzA#oif.PCS|sretaWeruzA\n)\n\n\nTo:\n Agent Xavier James (\noif.PCS|semaJreivaX#oif.PCS|semaJreivaX\n)\n\n\nSubject:\n RE: RE: RE: RE: Expedition help\n\n\nBody:\n\n\nYour first reaction to seeing me without my disguise does not give me confidence. Even if I was to slowly reveal what I know, they would catch on. You humans are smarter than I believed.\n\n\nI will see you soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM:\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/07/2025, Dr. Azure Waters led MTF Gamma-6 to SCP-7986 for retrieval of SCP-7986-1. Agents had undergone two weeks of cognitohazard resistance training in order to resist SCP-7986\u2019s effects, and entered SCP-7986\u2019s area of effect already equipped with specialized diving suits. However, once personnel dove into the water, an entity,\n1\n seemingly composed of seafoam, manifested between MTF Gamma-6 and SCP-7986\u2019s entrance. For archival purposes, a transcript taken from Agent Xavier\u2019s body camera is below.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Alright, weapons concealed, you guys, try not to scare the locals.\n\n\nAgent Briggs:\n Since when have you ever cared about the locals? If we spook \u2018em too bad, we\u2019ll just put some amnestics in the water, no big deal.\n\n\n(Agent Briggs laughs and swims towards the entrance to SCP-7986, moving ahead of the group.)\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Hold it\u2014! Don\u2019t move ahead of us. I don\u2019t want you losing focus.\n\n\n(Agent Briggs freezes. Xavier calls to him, but he does not respond. In front of him, a humanoid shape begins to form out of swirling water and seafoam. A beeping noise emits from Agent Xavier\u2019s suit, indicating that his Kant counter has detected a severe change in surrounding Hume levels.)\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Briggs, move!\n\n\n(The entity stretches out an appendage, knocking Agent Briggs backwards. Agent Xavier calls for medical attention, and orders another agent to bring Agent Briggs back to the surface to be examined.)\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Alright, screw it. Grab your weapons, guys\u2014 and you\u2014 what are you?\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n Humans\u2026 hate\u2026 humans.\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Join the club, a lot of things hate us.\n\n\n(Agent Xavier gestures for his team to back up and retreat. Just as he turns, a dome of swirling water surrounds them. Agent Xavier attempts to swim through it, however he is unable to pass through, as though it is solid. Agent Xavier glances up, and sees Dr. Azure Waters swimming towards them. She approaches the dome, and places her hands onto it. Gills are visible on her neck, and her skin and hair have taken on a more greenish hue.)\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n Xavier! How much oxygen is left in your tank?\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Enough. What is that thing?\n\n\n(The sound of gunfire can be heard in the background. Dr. Azure glances upwards, and winces.)\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n That is the god of the sea. In days past, sailors used to pray to her to guide them through the waves. But as time passed, and man began to believe the ocean was theirs, she grew bitter. We in this town have managed to keep her appeased by caring for her broken heart.\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Awesome, so this is one of those \u201cmankind sucks\u201d issues\u2026 Do bullets work?\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n No. Her spirit is the ocean. To kill her would be to kill the ocean. I will attempt to calm her. Her grievances are not with me.\n\n\n(Dr. Azure swims around the dome, approaching the entrance to SCP-7986. She lowers herself to the seafloor, and pounds on the dome, yelling to SCP-7986-3. SCP-7986-3 continues to attack MTF personnel with its appendages.)\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n Ocean! I beg of you, please, stop!\n\n\n(SCP-7986-3 lowers its appendages, and turns to look at Dr. Azure.)\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n You\u2026 you\u2026 are with the humans?\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n To protect you. Do you not remember?\n\n\n(Dr. Azure raises her left hand, pushing down her lab coat sleeve so that her bracelet is visible.)\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n You bestowed upon me the same luck you gave to the sailors.\n\n\n(Agent Xavier orders MTF Gamma-6 to cease firing, and to remain silent. SCP-7986-3 does not appear to notice.)\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n You said you wanted revenge for what they\u2019ve done to you. I understand. Many things want revenge for what the humans have done.\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n Humans\u2026 hurt me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Azure:\n I know. What will it take for you to forgive humans?\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n I want\u2026 damage to\u2026 stop. I want\u2026 apologies for treachery.\n\n\n(Dr. Azure looks over to Agent Xavier. Agent Xavier begins to shake his head, but he sighs, and slowly approaches SCP-7986-3.)\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Ocean\u2026 on\u2014 uh\u2014 on behalf of all humans, we are sorry..? We are trying to be kind to you\u2026 Please forgive us for\u2014 uh\u2014 hurting you?\n\n\n(SCP-7986-3 looks back at Agent Xavier, and stares at him. Agent Xavier noticeably shivers.)\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n This is not\u2026 how things are meant to go. Should go. But\u2026 you are friendly to one of my people\u2026 and I can feel that your intentions are\u2026 kind. It is enough.\n\n\n(The barrier trapping MTF Gamma-6 dissipates. SCP-7986-3 gestures upwards.)\n\n\nSCP-7986-3:\n Will not\u2026 cut off the ocean from\u2026 humanity. Will not spread\u2026 my anger. But\u2026 you do not own the ocean. My heart\u2026 is not for you. It is for everyone. Do not forget that. I will make you remember.\n\n\nAgent Xavier:\n Thank you. Come on, let's move out!\n\n\n\n\n(MTF Gamma-6 begins to ascend to the surface. Agent Xavier follows, but briefly looks back down. SCP-7986-3 has disappeared. Dr. Azure Waters waves to him, and says something inaudible.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMO FROM SITE DIRECTOR DR. RICHARD\n\n\nMake no mistake, SCP-7986 was a spectacular disaster. The entire retrieval operation was hijacked by a third party, and Agent Xavier should probably be terminated for agreeing to go along with it when he \nknew\n the order was given by false personnel. \u201cDr. Azure\u201d was a coward who had the gall to enter our ranks as nothing more than an average underwater citizen.\n\n\nShe\u2019s since been fired, of course. We can\u2019t reasonably contain her, unless we want the wrath of the sea upon our backs. However, Agent Xavier is still with us, and he\u2019s to be placed under supervision for the next two months. Now, that\u2019s a pretty soft punishment. I\u2019m sure you all are looking at me like I\u2019ve lost my reason. I\u2019ll tell you, my reasoning is perfectly sound.\n\n\nSimply put, Xavier did his job. He went against the grain, and somehow managed to defuse a situation that could have escalated into us being in conflict with yet another god\u2014 because he just so happened to be the kind of guy who would go against every bit of training we gave him, just to do a nice thing. The fact that we managed to send that kind of person, specifically for this mission, that did not initially call for such a gentle approach\u2014 that takes an incredible amount of luck, something we desperately need around.\n\n\nMy biggest take away from this entire thing?\n\n\nWe need to work on anti-luck technology. I mean, seriously\u2014 a woman named Dr. Azure Waters, being assigned to SCP-7986, an aquatic anomaly? \nI\n was the one who assigned her, and I didn\u2019t even think twice about it! Whatever method she was using, it was strong.\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
