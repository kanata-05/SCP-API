Such listings are to be shut down and all those with working knowledge of the tapes are to be amnesticized.\n\n\nInvestigation into the origins of SCP-5904 is given high priority, in order to stymie production of the anomaly.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-5904 is the collective designation for a series of instructional VHS tapes entitled \u201cHuman Resources Orientation,\u201d produced and distributed by \nVikander-Kneed Technical Media\n (GoI-5889).\n\n\nCurrently three instances are known to the Foundation, designated as SCP-5904-A through -C. SCP-5904\u2019s anomalous effects are only triggered when an instance is played for at least one individual. Subjects who watch an instance of SCP-5904 develop increased suggestibility and are amenable to following any instruction that would not endanger their lives. The effect is cumulative; the more content an individual watches, the more open to suggestion they will become.\n\n\nAdditionally, subjects who watch the entire series of tapes report insomnia, apathy, lack of appetite, and an increase in anxiety.\n1\n\n\nThe suggestibility and other psychological effects fade with time, but recollections of the content of an SCP-5904 instance are highly resistant to amnesticization.\n\n\nThe content of SCP-5904 instances cannot be copied through any known technology, whether digital or analog. Any attempts to duplicate an instance will produce only static.\n\n\nVarious items of information concerning the viewing subject will be incorporated into the content contained within an instance of SCP-5904. The host of the series (designated SCP-5904-1) is never completely shown on camera but appears to be male. At most the bottom fifty percent of SCP-5904-1\u2019s face will be visible on camera at any given time, his eyes are never visible. SCP-5904-1 self-identifies as Charlie Fiero, senior Vice President of GoI-5889\u2019s human resources division.\n\n\nDiscovery\n:\n\nSCP-5904 was discovered after an individual in Everett, Washington, purchased the tapes at a rummage sale. Ms. Martha Gutierrez, a student at University of Washington, age 20, claims no memory of the location or event of the purchase. Foundation personnel were made aware after posts on Parawatch.net were discovered by dedicated AiCs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMGparanoid\n 13/06/16 (Thu) 20:17:52 #6749253\n\n\n\n\nSo, the other day I bought these videotapes at a rummage sale in my parents\u2019 neighborhood. I got them so I could show my AV class, basically as a joke. But there was some drama right after I started the tape \u2013 my girlfriend wanted to get her sweater from my dorm and my roommate wouldn\u2019t let her in (b1tch) \u2013 so I left for a few minutes. When I came back, my classmates were all staring at the screen. The VHS had stopped and the old CRT was just static.\n\n\nScrewed up thing? Here\u2019s this group of six people, totally independent college students, various issues and intellectual abilities, right? They just start following orders. I tell them to fuck off \u2013 because they didn\u2019t pause the tape for me \u2013 they all get up and start leaving. I tell them to \u201cwait a minute!\u201d \u2013 they all turn around and look at me. It was fucking eerie!\n\n\nI figure they were pulling a joke on me\u2026 but the next day, I found one of them watching another of the tapes in the AV lab and she was freaking out. Turns out, the video was addressed to someone with her name (Emily isn\u2019t that strange of a name, I think she was being a bit extra)\u2026 so she\u2019s having a full on panic attack (she\u2019s normally really chill). I tell her she needs to calm down, and she sorta does. Like, I could see in her eyes that she was still freaked but she stopped pacing and stopped cursing up a storm. She just listened immediately.\n\n\nThey\u2019re just HR training videos, wtf?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Gutierrez was interviewed but she failed to provide any information concerning the origins of SCP-5904. She was amnesticized along with her classmates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nReading transcripts of the video files contained within SCP-5904-A through -C has the same effect as viewing the videos themselves. The following excerpts\n2\n should present minimal anomalous effects, but this is not guaranteed. Please have emergency anti-cognitohazard agents present while reviewing these transcripts.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher William Wettle performed the initial anomaly review and produced the below transcripts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTape\u00a0#1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing is a transcript of one section of Human Resources Orientation tape #1\n:\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 takes off a suit coat, starts rolling up its sleeves. The setting is a classroom with a large blackboard. Written on the blackboard are the words: \u201cInterviews: Framing the Narrative.\u201d]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: The thing is, you don\u2019t really ever want them to be too comfortable. Make it a little too hot, a little too cold, something. Get \u2018em antsy. Establish who\u2019s in charge early on. If they want those health benefits, they\u2019re gonna have to impress you. William impressed his interviewer when he came to work there, that\u2019s how he got this important job. Isn\u2019t that right Willie?\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 waits for thirty seconds.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: Right right, still\u2026 it \nis\n a funny joke. Then again, I wasn\u2019t really listening. \nThat\u2019s\n the other thing: only half listen to the interviewee. You don\u2019t get to make the call if they\u2019re hired or not, so what does it matter what they say? Besides, you don\u2019t want to set a precedent\u2026 If you started listening to people when they came to your office, they\u2019d probably start coming a lot more. Who wants that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTape\u00a0#2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing is a transcript of one section of Human Resources Orientation tape #2\n:\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 is sweeping a pile of bloody rags and human organs off the table in front of it and into a trash can. The trash can is overflowing with bones, viscera and other biological material.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: And that\u2019s the end of the Conflict Resolution chapter.

It turns and gestures towards a bed containing Researcher Wettle. SCP-5904-1 adjusts the blanket on top of Researcher Wettle so the blanket covers his shoulders. It turns to the camera and brings a finger to its lips. The entity gestures the camera away and walks over to Wettle\u2019s open closet, before standing in front of it and facing the camera.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: Now, let\u2019s talk about hostile work environments. How do you make them? And how to escalate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately ten minutes cut for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 is standing in front of Researcher Wettle\u2019s open refrigerator. It is bending over and looking inside, its upper body entirely hidden behind the open appliance door. The entity noisily rummages while continuing to speak.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: See, what we need to do is make sure that when someone complains of a hostile working environment, we don\u2019t solve the problem. If HR solved hostile work environments, what would the labor attorneys do for money? No, our job is different and has three parts: minimize the complaint, alienate the worker complaining, and make sure the one guilty of creating the hostile environment benefits in some noticeable way.\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 throws a jar of pickles out of the refrigerator.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: We\u2019re not \n[chewing noises]\n conflict resolution managers. We\u2019re human resources, we manage the humans. I always say, keep your goal reasonable and keep your role in the company firmly entrenched in your mind. Otherwise, you\u2019re just filling out forms and solving problems for employees every waking hour. That\u2019s not helping anyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately twelve minutes cut for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[The entity has moved to Wettle\u2019s living room and sits in a Lay-Z-Boy recliner, foot dangling off the right arm of the chair. SCP-5904-1 is smoking a cigarette and ashing onto the shag carpeting of Wettle\u2019s home. It is also drinking directly from a bottle of wine taken from Wettle\u2019s cabinets.]\n3\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: Now let's cover the most challenging aspect of your HR career: medical benefits questions. What a pain in the butt, right? The secret is, don\u2019t read the documents. Always say \u201cI\u2019ll have to look into it\u201d when someone comes to you with questions and then, if possible, don\u2019t get back to them. If they\u2019re persistent, find a way to ruin their day, just a little. Who are they to ask such questions? What, are medical benefits a human right?\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 inhales a long drag from the cigarette and then exhales.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: What is this, Cuba? They should be fucking happy we give them benefits. Read your own damn documents. It\u2019s 1992, this ain\u2019t a fantasy story, people should be content with what they get.\n4\n\n\n[The entity rises from the recliner, grinds out the cigarette into the carpet, and drains the mostly full bottle of wine in twenty seconds. SCP-5904-1 turns its back to the camera and approaches a potted ficus tree in the corner of Wettle\u2019s living room. The sound of a zipper and then a stream of liquid hitting plastic leaves is audible on the recording.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: What else\u2026 what else? Oh, I know. Sexual Harassment. The best subject. Not because of sex, don\u2019t look at me that way, Willie. I mean because of the harassment. People being unhappy is my thing.\n\n\n[The sounds of liquid cease and the zipper is heard again. SCP-5904-1 walks to Wettle\u2019s sliding glass door leading to a small, enclosed backyard. The entity opens the door and walks through, the camera following.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: So, part of our job in HR is to take complaints and file them with the appropriate people, when an employee makes a complaint of sexual harassment. This is especially important because we don\u2019t want the corporation sued. The bottom line is literally your god, we didn\u2019t get into HR because we were humanitarians, am I right? \n[SCP-5904-1 chuckles softly.]\n So, make sure you tell the boss and the appropriate steps are taken when such a complaint is made. I might like it when people are miserable, but abusers can take a long walk off a short pier, you get me?\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 stretches and yawns, looking up at the night sky. As it turns around to face the camera again, the view is shifted down so only the bottom 50% of the entity\u2019s face is visible. Blood starts to run down its face in twin rivulets, presumably from the area of its eyes. The blood stains the entity\u2019s shirt and continues to flow as it speaks.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: Right well, that\u2019s about all the time we have today. Don\u2019t forget to write those letters with any questions to Vikander-Kneed Technical Media Human Resources Orientation at the address provided in tape number one. We\u2019re here to help\u2026 well, not the employees obviously, but otherwise we\u2019re here to help. You know what I mean. Say Goodnight, Willie!\n\n\n[SCP-5904-1 starts waving in an animated fashion and continues for fifteen seconds.]\n\n\nSCP-5904-1\n: Thanks, Willie!

        "MGparanoid 13/06/16 (Thu) 20:17:52 #6749253 So, the other day I bought these videotapes at a rummage sale in my parents\u2019 neighborhood. I got them so I could show my AV class, basically as a joke. But there was some drama right after I started the tape \u2013 my girlfriend wanted to get her sweater from my dorm and my roommate wouldn\u2019t let her in (b1tch) \u2013 so I left for a few minutes. When I came back, my classmates were all staring at the screen. The VHS had stopped and the old CRT was just static. Screwed up thing? Here\u2019s this group of six people, totally independent college students, various issues and intellectual abilities, right? They just start following orders. I tell them to fuck off \u2013 because they didn\u2019t pause the tape for me \u2013 they all get up and start leaving. I tell them to \u201cwait a minute!\u201d \u2013 they all turn around and look at me. It was fucking eerie! I figure they were pulling a joke on me\u2026 but the next day, I found one of them watching another of the tapes in the AV lab and she was freaking out. Turns out, the video was addressed to someone with her name (Emily isn\u2019t that strange of a name, I think she was being a bit extra)\u2026 so she\u2019s having a full on panic attack (she\u2019s normally really chill). I tell her she needs to calm down, and she sorta does. Like, I could see in her eyes that she was still freaked but she stopped pacing and stopped cursing up a storm. She just listened immediately. They\u2019re just HR training videos, wtf?",
