It does not necessarily reflect the views of the SCP Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-7268\n\n\nLevel 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nPublic Domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEta Cassiopeiae Ab. SCP-7268 is, according to observation, centered on this planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Travel to and from the Eta Cassiopeiae system is explicitly off-limits, as ordered by the SCP Foundation, the UN, the SCA, and the ISA. Any ships in violation of this quarantine will be subject to immediate termination and decommissioning.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7268 is a field of indeterminate nature emanating from Eta Cassiopeiae Ab. While this field is not detectable by current instrumentation, its effect can be observed. In the presence of SCP-7268, high-complexity organic molecules utilizing phosphorus (i.e., phospholipids, RNA, DNA) cannot form, though simpler organic molecules, such as amino acids, have been observed.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-7268 was discovered and described by Dr. Rosalind Carson, a non-Foundation scientist, during the Viracocha mission to Eta Cassiopeiae. The file was authorized by the UN, overriding an O5 vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n James Gould\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Daniel Ogonowski\n\n\nDate:\n August 13, 2247\n\n\nTime:\n 4:38 p.m.\n\n\nSubject:\n Sorry about this\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of those good news/bad news things, and I\u2019ll start off with the good. Your job is fine. Though the \nmushroom project\n is suspended for now.\n\n\nNow for the bad. These are orders from the O5 Council itself, so there\u2019s literally nothing I can do. Effective Dec. 15, you will be serving a 3-year stint on Swayambhu Station, in orbit around 55 Serpens d, both as an exobiologist and as a representative of the SCP Foundation, to confirm the presence of SCP-7268. But you know the deal with Swayambhu. You know who\u2019s in charge. She asked for you, and since you\u2019re the only exobiologist we have, we can\u2019t send a substitute.\n\n\nDr. Carson suspects SCP-7268 is present on d, same as on Eta Cassiopeiae Ab. We could argue the point, since the whole point of 7268 is that it only exists at Eta Cassiopeiae, but it's quicker to send you. Arguing with her via 6-month gaps would take a long time. And just between us, I think the Council is hoping you can confirm the Foundation's stance on 7268. Get humanity over the hump so we can move forward as a species. And we need the push. I saw a poll a while back; apparently more than half of Americans still believe extraterrestrial life is out there. I've got a bridge to sell those people.\n\n\nSome more good news: You\u2019ve got 4 months to get everything in order, and we managed to get you a 30% increase on the normal field pay rate. Over 3 years, that\u2019ll be a hefty sum. Hoping it\u2019s enough to cover the initiation fee to that famous golf course on Crystal Lake you\u2019re always raving about when you get back. Crystal Downs, right?\n\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m so, so sorry to spring this on you, especially since you won\u2019t see the email until Monday. Hell of a thing to walk into after a beautiful weekend like we\u2019re supposed to have.\n\n\nDr. Ogonowski\n\nHead of Site 78\n\nTraverse City, Mich.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55 Serpens d, from orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Jan. 6, 2248. 4:11 p.m., station time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Gould is unpacking in a small, metal-lined bedroom. He is visibly unhappy, and occasionally massages his scalp. A chime plays on the intercom, and he looks at the door.\n\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d he says.\n\n\nThe door opens, and a short, middle-aged woman in her 80s enters. She smiles, but keeps her distance. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, James. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d\n\n\nHe turns away, digging into his bag. \u201cDr. Carson.\u201d\n\n\nShe frowns. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to call me Auntie Rosie anymore, but doctor?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\n\nShe sighs. \u201cHow was the trip?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t remember a thing. Suppose I\u2019m relieved I even woke up at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJames, don\u2019t be- as long as the artificial coma process is correctly administered, there\u2019s 0% chance of developing HID.\u201d\n1\n\n\n\u201cI know how hyperspace travel works.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course you do, I \u2026\u201d she trails off, tapping her fingers on the adjacent wall. \u201cOh, we cleared out a space for that golf simulator you brought. The dimensions aren\u2019t exactly what you asked, but in terms of volume, it\u2019s actually bigger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it work.\u201d\n\n\nShe smiles. \u201cI\u2019d have never taken you for a golfer when you were growing up, but you caught the bug bad, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you know it, big green open spaces appeal to me. Shame I won\u2019t be seeing any of those for 3 goddamn years.\u201d He groans and turns around. \u201cLook, the gravity here\u2019s screwing with my head, I haven\u2019t been on a spin station in a very long time. I need-\u201d\n\n\nShe holds a hand up. \u201cI understand. You\u2019re not the only one. Get yourself to the medbay as soon as you can. We\u2019ll start tomorrow at 9. Sound good?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould nods and Dr. Carson exits. He rummages through his bag and pulls out a bottle of vodka. He unscrews the lid and drinks straight from the bottle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Jan. 7, 2248. 1:53 p.m., station time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Carson and Dr. Gould enter a lab. Computers and desks cluster in the center of the room, with a series of large chambers lining the walls. \u201cAnd this where the magic happens,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cNot literally of course. I know that\u2019s the Foundation\u2019s domain, and your Merlins get real persnickety when us normal people step on their toes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey might be nicer if you kept the slang away from them,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cThaumaturges, doctor, they prefer the term thaumaturge. Maybe if you\u2019d indulged them you could have convinced one to maintain a grav generator here. I feel like my shoes have lead in them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo offense, James, I understand why you joined the Foundation, but I want as little to do with those xenophobes and control freaks as I can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet this is the second time you\u2019ve called on them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn't my first choice,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cAnyway, welcome to the life lab. This is where we\u2019ll be working. Since we haven\u2019t found any native life yet, we\u2019ve modified the holding chambers to induce abiogenesis utilizing native Manu-Yemoan\n2\n material.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTry to induce.\u201d Dr. Gould walks over to a window, filled with a cloudy slurry and sparking with miniature bolts of plasma, and taps on the glass. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\n\nHer smile remains firm. \u201cOf course. Actually, I had some materials shipped from Earth along with you; we\u2019re going to run the Urey-Miller-Fatima\n3\n process on that to provide a proper control sample.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe should mix materials too,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cSome from Earth, some from D. Deuterium label\n4\n the Earth sample to keep them straight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea!\u201d Dr. Carson moves to place a hand on Dr. Gould\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou seemed out of it this morning, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming around.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould glares at her until she drops her hand. \u201cIf you wanted a na\u00efve PhD student to butter up with faint praise, you missed the boat by 10 years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says. She stammers for a moment, then regains her placid smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I leave you here so you can catch up on everything we\u2019ve learned so far? I should go check in with the geology department, apparently they found some interesting crystal formation near a volcano on the northern continent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, aren\u2019t you going to explain how these computers work?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI understand that you\u2019re upset about being here, and that our past gives you leeway, but I expect you to maintain some level of professionalism while on the job, Dr. Gould.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine. Professionalism. You got it.\u201d Dr. Gould sits at a computer and links the drone to download data. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m jealous. I get homework and you get to learn something new from people who aren\u2019t wasting their time on a dead rock.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big planet, and we\u2019ve only been here 2 years. We\u2019ll find something. Maybe life, maybe another instance of your SCP-7268. Who knows, and I\u2019m excited to find out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t help cheerleading, can you?\u201d Dr. Gould asks. \u201cYou sound like the damn Luna Tourism Board. Come to Luna, it\u2019s not just an airless, radiation-blasted rock, we swear. First stepping stone to the stars my ass, the Apollos are not worth the trip.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I was-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, biology student by day, cheerleader by night, I\u2019ve heard the story a million times. Your old professors never stopped talking about you. No one who knew you could. Must be how you\u2019ve convinced half the System to keep funding you, since it certainly isn\u2019t your results.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour definition of professionalism leaves something to be desired.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould snaps to attention with a full salute. \u201cApologies, ma\u2019am! I shall endeavor to fulfill the assignment given to me with the utmost of my abilities!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod, that Foundation turned you into a real ass.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cBut you\u2019re working for the good guys now. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife survey 1 (Feb. 25, 2246)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\n\n\n45.9\u00b0 S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongitude\n\n\n134.6\u00b0 W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment type\n\n\nHydrothermal vents on near-surface mid-ocean ridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElevation\n\n\n\u2013240 meters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMass spectrometry detected numerous organic molecules, including but not limited to 54 separate amino acids, sterols, fatty acids, and sugars such as ribose.

Atmosphere within chamber matches that of 55 Serpens d, pressurized to 5 bar. Rock bed is igneous, consistent with hydrothermal vents, and superheated water filled with sulfides is constantly cycled through, in addition to constant 600\u00a0V stimulation of chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1: Control (all materials sourced from Earth)\n\n\nResult: Amino acids and lipids form in 11 days. Basic RNA is detected 74 days after experiment start. Proto-membranes form 3 days later. RNA forms basic ribosomes at day 98. Cell mitosis begins at day 113. Cells are basic chemolithotrophic prokaryotes, oxidizing sulfur to grow and reproduce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 2: All materials sourced from 55 Serpens d\n\n\nResult: Amino acids and basic lipids form in 15 days. Various sugars, including ribose, also appear in this time period. No other activity has occurred as of day 133.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 3: Materials sourced from both Earth and 55 Serpens d at a 50/50 mix. Approximately 5% of water from Earth utilizes deuterium rather than hydrogen-1.\n\n\nResult: Amino acids and basic lipids form in 17 days. Various sugars, including ribose, also appear in this time period. No other activity has occurred as of day 133.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf nothing else, Dr. Carson is remarkably meticulous and thorough with her research. It's taken a month to catch up. Twenty comprehensive life surveys and months of UMF experiment observations. Any other field and I'd be mired in catch-up reports for years. But exobiology, I know the answer ahead of time. Thousands and thousands of pages of negative everything. Every damn day drives the point home a little bit harder.\n\n\nI don't want to do this for 3 years.

The sides are steep and massive rocks jut out at every opportune angle. The center of the lake boils and is obscured by a thick wall of steam.\n\n\nDr. Gould raises an instrument out of the water. \u201cTemperature, 350 Kelvin; pH, 4.2. Not exactly a prime spot for life here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t call \u2018em extremophiles for nothing,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cLife can always find a way.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould sighs. \u201cLet\u2019s get the next monitoring station set up at sector 5. I\u2019d like to get out of here as quick as I can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on, James, we spend so much time up on the station, staring at computers, letting robots do all the exploring for us. We should enjoy our time down here.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould stops and glances around. \u201cPutting aside the poisonous atmosphere, a boiling lake on a dead planet isn\u2019t exactly my idea of a vacation spot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt used to be.\u201d Dr. Carson says as they resume walking. \u201cHow many summers did you spend with me when you were young, gallivanting around the Solar System? That\u2019s why I came with you today, I thought maybe we could \u2026 this is just like the old days, you know?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould waves another instrument around. \u201cHume levels at 0.95. Little low, but still within normal. Atmospheric conditions probably the cause, but still, worth recording.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you remember how excited you were when your parents finally let you go with me on one of my trips to the field? There you were, still shorter than me back in those days, with your backpack positively bursting at the seams, knocking on my door at 6 in the morning. You were too excited to sleep, you\u2019d spent your entire life on Lovell Station, and finally you were going to step foot on real solid ground. Oh, the crew at Tharsis base were so confused at first, what\u2019s a kid doing here, he\u2019s gonna get in the way, but you proved them wrong, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs I recall, I helped catalog inventory for most of the trip.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause you wanted to check every rock for life! You were sorting faster than they could bring them in by then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLooking back, I\u2019m pretty sure some child labor laws were violated. The Martian Research Association definitely owes me a month\u2019s wages, and they\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, James, don\u2019t be like that, it was a great learning experience! I wish you could go back and see your younger self, I think he\u2019d have a thing or two to say to you now.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould stops, dropping the tools. \u201cFine, but I can talk to him too, and I\u2019d tell him he was a damn idiot for getting caught up in your bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I was the perfect little student back, what did you expect? I was a little geek growing up, no friends, no social life, and my parents? They didn\u2019t \u2026 they tried, but they weren\u2019t what I needed. And then one of the most famous scientists in the System moves in next door? Finally someone who understands, someone who indulges me. I worshiped you, hung on your every word, and I bought into your whole goddamn fantasy world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy what?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould glances down, and picks up his instruments. \u201cYou really do believe it, don\u2019t you? That we\u2019ll find life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I do. In an infinite cosmos, the odds of Earth being the only inhabited planet \u2026 it\u2019s impossible. The universe doesn\u2019t work like that. It doesn\u2019t do anything just once. It may not be here, it may not exist in this galaxy, but we are not alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got a lot more faith than I do.\u201d Dr. Gould looks over his Kant counter and smacks it. \u201cApparently we\u2019ve moved into a section of extreme reality. 45 Humes is nothing to sneeze at. They send me a hundred light years out, but they can\u2019t give me decent equipment. Typical.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson sighs deeply. \u201cIf you ever want to talk, you know where to find me.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould hits the counter again, then takes out the battery and plugs it back in. He shakes the devices and flicks the screen. \u201cBack to 0.96. It was exciting while it lasted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife survey 28 (May 24, 2248)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\n\n\n55.6\u00b0 N\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongitude\n\n\n32.1\u00b0 W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment type\n\n\nFlooded fumarole.

The O5s are welcome to scour the data if they want, but they\u2019ll be wasting their time. I\u2019m also including the footage from my drone, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend that either.

Alarm was activated because of an altercation between Dr. James Gould and Dr. Luiz Guimar\u00e3es. When security arrived, Dr. Gould had been restrained by two other scientists, and Dr. Guimar\u00e3es had been knocked out. Dr. Guimar\u00e3es awoke shortly afterward and was escorted to the medbay by Nurse Duale. Concussion likely. Dr. Gould was escorted back to his quarters. Breath scans showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Dec. 3, 2248. 9:30 a.m., station time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nThe door to Dr. Gould\u2019s room slides open, and Dr. Carson storms in. Dr. Gould is still asleep, and she shakes him awake.\n\n\n\u201cJesus, what the hell?\u201d Dr. Gould asks, wiping his eyes. \u201cNo one\u2019s done that to me since I was a kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Dr. Carson snaps. \u201cYou\u2019ve acted like one.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould slowly crawls up, wiping his eyes and wincing when he applies too much pressure to his right hand. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast night coming back to you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn my defense, Tobias should have known not to give me that last Long Island. He\u2019s served me enough the past year, he knows when I\u2019m at my limit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blaming Tobias? James, you punched a man in the face. You knocked him out! You\u2019re not going to take any responsibility?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knocked- listen, if nothing else, you gotta be impressed, I am no one\u2019s idea of an athlete, but damn, all those swings have bulked up my arms something fierce.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy god, James, I brought security personnel along because I had to, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need them to stop an actual assault.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWhat the hell is going on with you? Has there been a single night in the past few months you haven\u2019t gotten drunk?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything else for me to do,\u201d he says. \u201cWake up, stare at a computer screen while it flashes negative results at me, then go to bed. Exciting. Great use of my time.\u201d\n\n\n\"You know perfectly well that science is 90% negative results.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, I could deal with 90%. I would kill for 90%. It's every damn test. Every fucking test. Do you understand, \ndoctor\n? It's hopeless! Both of us, we're wasting our lives chasing ghosts! No, not even ghosts, that would imply life existed and died. We don't even get that satisfaction. We're chasing a fantasy. A joke.\"\n\n\n\"I thought you were better than this, buying into your O5 Council's absurd idea that we're living in a dead universe.\"\n\n\n\"Follow the evidence, doctor! There's plenty of proof on their side, and a whole lot of nothing on yours.\"\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. This is not the passionate young man I met 30 years ago. What did you do to that James?\u201d\n\n\nHe grumbles and lays back down. \u201cYou knew me once. I\u2019m not that person anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s going to be some sort of punishment. Not sure what the laws are like in another solar system, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got something up your sleeve.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWith this attitude of yours, I\u2019d like to throw you in the brig,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re the only one qualified to use the Foundation equipment. But if this happens again-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOff to the stockades? Gonna stick me in the city square so passing peasants can lob rotten fruit at me?\u201d\n\n\nShe takes a deep breath. \u201cIt goes without saying that you are officially cut off. You will not be served any more alcohol, so if you have a stash around, you\u2019d better make it last. And if you so much as look at someone the wrong way again, I\u2019m turning your simulator room back into storage.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson visibly stiffens and steps back slightly.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cNow, I\u2019d appreciate it if you let me sleep off the rest of this hangover. The pills do nothing for me these days.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson moves to speak again, then throws her hands up in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s like talking to a damn brick wall,\u201d she mutters as she leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage sent:\n Dec. 13, 2248\n\n\nMessage received:\n Jan. 8, 2249\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Daniel Ogonowski\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. James Gould\n\n\n\n\nSo, I've got some good news and bad news for you. Yes, again. This time I'll give you the bad news first: The O5s want you to stay there. There's no way they can arrange transport for you, not again, not so soon after you got there. It took too much to get you there. I'm afraid you're there for the full 3 years. Blame your higher brain functions.\n\n\nNow for the good news, and wow, is it some of the best news we've ever had. We've been sitting on it for almost 8 months now, and after the tone of your first message back, we regretted not telling you right away. But we wanted to be sure, and we didn't want to tease you with incomplete data.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be wondering what\u2019s in the conspicuously blank storage container the cargo ship brought along, and why it\u2019s locked. It\u2019s only programmed to open once you\u2019ve gone through all the documents we\u2019ve sent along, because we don\u2019t want the surprise ruined prematurely. You\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll say: Have fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Farmer, a Drill, and the News of the Century: The Story Behind the Discovery of Native Martian Life\n\n\nThirty years after the last serious attempt to find native Martian life, a humble farmer drilling for a new water source makes the accidental discovery of the century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cluster of Martian \nArchaeans\n under an electron microscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 21, 2248 \u2013 Shi Lei Zhou isn\u2019t the sort of person who set out to change the course of human history. To have his name recorded in the history books for the rest of time.\n\n\n\u201cI came to Mars to provide for my family back home in Shanghai,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one I knew had ever been off world, had never owned land.\u201d\n\n\nMr. Zhou and his wife, Mei Lan, both 43, were lured to the Red Planet 10 years ago thanks to the UN\u2019s Martian Homesteader Act. The deal is simple: Promise to farm 500 acres of hardscrabble Martian soil, and in return receive machinery, a generous yearly salary, and the full support of the Martian Research Association. Ever since the Act\u2019s passage in 2215, about a million people have taken the deal, transforming an area the size of Mexico into useful, arable land. That\u2019s enough food to feed a billion people.\n\n\nMr. Zhou\u2019s task on March 28th was simple. A noticeable vein of liquid water sits deep underneath his farm in Aonia Terra, buried below a kilometer of rock. Drilling took nearly a year, but by getting to it, he\u2019d both relieve his reliance on the grid, saving him money, and earn some extra on the side by distributing any spare water to his neighbors. The water had reached the surface the day before; all he needed to do on the 28th was check for contaminants. Of course, Martian water requires a significant amount of filtration to be usable, but Mr. Zhou wasn\u2019t expecting anything out of the ordinary ammonia and salts.\n\n\nAs a matter of formality, the scanning system the MRA provided Mr. Zhou included a bio-sensor; there have been multiple instances in the past where Martian water sources, previously tapped by human activity, have been contaminated with Earth-based microbes. But this lake was pristine.\n\n\nMr. Zhou was out in the fields, tending to his corn, when the scanner pinged him with results. The usual contaminants were present, as he expected, but there was something more. The bio-sensor had returned a positive reading. Microbes were present in the sample he\u2019d collected.\n\n\nHe and his wife are not biologists, but they knew this result was out of the ordinary.\n\n\n\u201cWe searched for native Martian life for over 200 years,\u201d says Nicola Ghini, PhD, head of the MRA\u2019s department of agriculture. \u201cWe scoured this planet from top to bottom. The last great expedition was 30 years ago, and it came up empty-handed. When Shi Lei called and told us that he\u2019d gotten a positive on the bio-sensor, we thought we\u2019d given him a faulty unit. Either that, and not to sound harsh, we assumed he\u2019d done the test wrong.\u201d\n\n\nA team was sent out to Mr. Zhou\u2019s farm with a second scanner. They retrieved another sample. They ran it through their bio-sensor. Same result. Positive. The team ran the test once more. Also positive.\n\n\n\u201cI was on the other side of the planet when they called,\u201d Dr. Ghini says. \u201cMeeting with the Assembly\u2019s agriculture subcommittee on the odds of passing a new water allowance bill. They called my personal device, which is strictly off-limits for business.\n\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019d heard about Mr. Zhou by then, rumor travels fast. But I didn\u2019t think much of it. Dr. Pasaphan [Chalita Pasaphan, PhD, was in charge of the team sent to Mr. Zhou\u2019s farm] is a friend, she had my personal number. When she called, I was in the middle of negotiations, and a little upset about being interrupted. But before I could get wound up, she stopped me. I\u2019ll never forget what she said. \u2018It\u2019s real. Martian life is real.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur for everyone in her department. \u201cObviously, we had to be 110% certain about our results,\u201d Dr. Pasaphan says. \u201cThere have been so many false starts in the past. So we checked and double-checked and triple-checked that lake, using our most sensitive equipment. We broke down the genomes of these Martian \nArchaeans\n, and the only similarity is that both use RNA. Everything else about them, their genetic code, their single-layer cell membrane, the lack of virtually any organelle \u2013 they\u2019re so primitive and unrefined, there\u2019s no way it could have come from us.\u201d\n\n\nIndeed, the five species identified so far consist of nothing more than various types of primitive RNA wrapped inside a lipid membrane. All they do is feed on the various organic molecules available to them and replicate. It is perhaps a stretch to call them alive; even the viruses we know and tolerate feature far more genetic material then the Martian cells.\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n, responsible for walking pneumonia, a milder form of the disease. While controversy still rages over viral status as living creatures, \nM. pneumoniae\n is indisputably alive, but one of the simplest organisms we know, containing just 700 genes with 700,000 base pairs. That sounds impressive, but humans have 25,000 genes and 3 billion base pairs. Earth life has lived for 4 billion years, and in that time even the simplest of cells has had the opportunity to specialize and diversify.\n\n\nThe most complex of the Martian species, for comparison, has just 300 genes and 20,000 base pairs. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the Martian lifeforms developed recently,\u201d Dr. Pasaphan says. \u201cTheir cellular and genetic makeup is so simple. I would be shocked if they had developed any longer than a million years ago. And when it comes to biological scales, that\u2019s essentially yesterday.\u201d\n\n\nObviously, much work remains for Dr. Ghini and her department. \u201cWe were confident enough in our findings to declare these microbes as definitively Martian, but there\u2019s so much we still don\u2019t know. How much more life is there in the lake? How many more species? And is it possible we missed life somewhere else on this planet? And what about the rest of the System?\n\n\n\u201cNo one here is strictly an exobiologist, and it\u2019s unfortunate that the System\u2019s two dedicated exobiologists are 100 light years away, but we\u2019ll do our best. We\u2019ve got an entire planet to recheck, and I think we\u2019re all more excited than we\u2019ve ever been. This is the sort of extra work we\u2019re glad to have.\u201d\n\n\nThe Interplanetary Space Agency recently announced on April 18 that it would devote approximately 100 billion over the next 5 years both building and operating new life-seeking space probes and manned laboratories, as well as reactivating old operations. \u201cHumanity has waited nearly 300 years for this news,\u201d Alfonso Lacanzo, CEO of the ISA, said in a news conference after the announcement. \u201cIf there\u2019s more life out there in the System, we\u2019ll find it. This is the most important project our species has ever undertaken. Finally, after so long, we have proof: We are not alone.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile, back on his farm, Shi Lei Zhou and his wife are adjusting to their new reality. \u201cWe\u2019ve had nonstop requests for interviews ever since the news first broke,\u201d Mr. Zhou says. \u201cAnd the MRA has promised to cover the costs of a new farm, so that they can take over this property to set up as a preserve, plus a stipend for our families back home.\u201d\n\n\nAnd what about his inevitable place in the history books? \u201cIt is funny, I drill a hole, and everything changes,\u201d he says. \u201cI am simply happy to have provided humanity with a great gift.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Martian Herald\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2248\n\n\n\n\nThirteen Unique Species Discovered in Subsurface Spring Near North Pole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2248\n\n\n\n\nPrimitive Life Discovered Floating in Venusian Clouds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Atlantic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug. 14, 2248\n\n\n\n\nHead in the Clouds: New Life Drifting Deep Within Jupiter\u2019s Atmosphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 3, 2248\n\n\n\n\nCount of Unique Martian Species Passes 100, Shows No Sign of Slowing Down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 11, 2248\n\n\n\n\nTitanic Discovery: Strange Methane-Based Life Discovered on Saturn's Moon, Unlike Anything Seen Before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory: Special Biocontainment Chamber\n\n\nLiving and deceased samples of 105 Martian \nArchaeans\n\nLiving and deceased samples of 12 Venusian \nArchaeans\n\nLiving and deceased samples of 8 Jovian \nArchaeans\n\nLiving and deceased samples of 15 Titanian \nArchaeans\n\nOrganic/inorganic materials for UMF testing from the following planets/moons:\n\n\n\n\nMars\n\n\nVenus (clouds)\n\n\nJupiter (clouds)\n\n\nTitan\n\n\nLuna\n\n\nCeres\n\n\nEuropa\n\n\nEnceladus\n\n\nTriton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Jan. 9, 2249. 9:31 a.m., station time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nThe door to Dr. Gould's room slides open, and Dr. Carson walks in. \"James, you're 30 minutes late. You've been doing so well, if you've been drinking again, I'll be so disappointed.\"\n\n\nDr. Gould is sitting in front of his personal computer. On screen is the message from Dr. Ogonowski. He turns, his face expressionless. \"You're never going to believe what they found.\"\n\n\n\"Does it have something to do with the mystery container from the Foundation taking up half of our main cargo bay?\" Dr. Carson asks. \"I'm only the station commander, what do I need to know? I swear, the Foundation has no respect-\"\n\n\n\"It's alien life,\" Dr. Gould says, his voice barely more than a whisper. \"About 150 species of microbes from Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Titan.\"\n\n\n\"What did you just say?\"\n\n\n\"The O5s were wrong,\" Dr. Gould says. \"I was wrong. Extraterrestrial life exists. We found it. We have it.\"\n\n\nHe winces as Dr. Carson screams. \"I don't believe it!\" She jumps up and down. \"All these years, and we finally found it! You're not, this isn't a joke, right? If it is-\"\n\n\n\"No joke,\" Dr. Gould says. \"I'll send you everything the Council sent me.\"\n\n\nDr. Carson paces back and forth, grinning from ear to ear. \"I can't, I can't stay still, I feel so-\" Tears well up. \"I spent so many years dreaming of this moment. So many years, so many negatives. There were times, times when I doubted. Dark times. But I never lost faith. And now you're telling me we have actual living alien organisms in our cargo bay?\"\n\n\n\"That's what I said, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\"Jesus, try to contain your excitement. You're acting like \u2026 I don't know what this is. Isn't this everything you wanted? Proof you made the right choice, becoming an exobiologist?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. \"It is. You were right all along. You were right, and I was wrong.\"\n\n\n\"No, no, not wrong. You were following the facts that you had. You were being a good scientist. I can't fault you for that.\"\n\n\nDr. Gould turns away from the computer. \"You were a better scientist.\"\n\n\n\"Honestly, I wasn't. Not even close,\" Dr. Carson says. \"If I'd followed the science, I'd have given up the search long ago, like everyone else before me. But sometimes science isn't everything. Sometimes you need a little faith.\"\n\n\n\"I was so sure I was right.\"\n\n\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\" Dr. Carson asks. \"You haven't been drinking, have you?\"\n\n\n\"What? No, no, you can test me-\"\n\n\n\"That's not necessary,\" Dr. Gould says. \"Actually, I've been thinking about bringing this up for a few days. You've been sober for a month, you've passed every test with flying colors. I'm willing to allow you a limited allowance at the bar again. Do you understand? Limited. A couple servings every other night or so. I think you can handle that.\"\n\n\nDr. Gould nods. \"Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your faith in me. Seems like you have faith in everyone and everything.\"\n\n\n\"I never lost my faith in you. I knew you were in there all along, hiding beneath a thick blanket of Foundation cynicism. A few more months in the light, and you'll be the bright-eyed student of knowledge I knew 20 years ago.\"\n\n\n\"You believe in me more than I do.\"\n\n\n\"You lost your way a little bit, that's all. It happens. We're only human. Now come on, get out of that chair, we have some serious work to do. Oh, we're going to be like kids in a candy store today! Where will we even start?\"\n\n\nShe exits, leaving Dr. Gould alone. \"I should be excited,\" he says, glancing at the now-empty door. \"This is good news.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days of listening to her crow about how she never gave up.

As he collects his golf ball to hit his next shot, the door slides open. \u201cI figured I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Dr. Carson says.\n\n\n\u201cNot exactly the mystery of the century,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cThe golfer\u2019s out on the course, what a shock.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is when there\u2019s a party going on,\u201d she says. \u201cI give you permission to drink again, and you\u2019re out here by yourself? You can have a good time tonight. With all the news, I think you deserve to cut loose. Come on, we only discover extraterrestrial life for the first time once, let's celebrate!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever been one for parties,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cAnd the feeling\u2019s mutual on their part.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson sidles fully into the back of the room. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blocked in here, so I don\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here a year. Have you actually made a friend in that time? Had a meaningful conversation with another human being? Anything other than drunkenly flirting with half the women on the station and getting into fist fights with everyone else?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould slings his club over his shoulder. \u201cPoint me in the direction of someone worth being friends with, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, everyone here is good and kind, and they\u2019d-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t. They\u2019re not outwardly malicious, and no one\u2019s said anything deliberately unkind. But they don\u2019t respect me, and I don\u2019t blame them. I\u2019m a goddamn clown. Story of my life at this point.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something on your mind, James, and I wish you\u2019d talk to me about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you though?\u201d Dr. Gould asks. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather set me up, then ship out to the other side of the damn galaxy at the last moment, right when I need you most?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson recoils, as if she\u2019d been physically struck. \u201cWhat are you- Are you talking about Eta Cassiopeiae? It was the opportunity of a lifetime, and you were all eager to go off to college. Then when I came back \u2026\u201d she drifts off. \u201cYou\u2019d changed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYou taught me too well. I bought into everything you said, I had ironclad faith that life was out there, we just hadn\u2019t found it yet. That I was making the right choice, following in your footsteps.\n\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen all at once, by the way. No one was ever deliberately cruel. I could shake off the first snide remark, the tenth subtle putdown, the hundredth condescending \u2018oh, good for you, pursuing your dream! I hope it works out.\u2019 It was all meant in good fun. Hell, I laughed with them at first. I know a joke from an insult. But that\u2019s the thing. It came from everywhere. The professors, the students, my parents, my friends, they all \u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe pauses for a moment, clenching his fist and looking away. \u201cJust one person. That\u2019s all I would\u2019ve needed. One person to believe in me. A kind word, an affirmation every once in a while. Someone to say: \u2018Hey James, you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u2019 I needed the person who set me on this path. I needed you, and you weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Carson\u2019s lip trembles, and her eyes are moist. \u201cJames, I didn\u2019t- I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the worst part too. I\u2019m not even angry at you. Not really. It was your job, of course you went. And I was still the eager, voracious apprentice. I had faith. There was no reason for you to worry about me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, I should\u2019ve done more than send you a few impersonal letters,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever even asked how you were doing. I was so focused on the job. So excited about seeing a new solar system, a new world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you should have been! For the first time, humans were leaving our solar system. A true interstellar mission. You helped make history. You were so strong. You are so, so strong.\u201d He looks at the ceiling. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not. You\u2019ve been searching for 60 years, and you\u2019ve never wavered. Never flinched. Halfway into my PhD I was ready to throw in the towel. If it hadn\u2019t been for the Foundation \u2026 I know they\u2019re heartless bastards. But it was something. They gave me a purpose. Something to believe in. They were there when you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019re better than I am,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cJames, I can\u2019t turn back the clock, make things right between us, but I can do this.\u201d She steps forward with her arms out. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\n\nHe laughs. \u201cGoing for the clich\u00e9 move, I see.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason it\u2019s clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould slowly walks over, and Dr. Carson wraps her arms around him. Tears stream down her face, and well up in his. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, James,\u201d she says.\n\n\nHis arms move around her. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers.\n\n\nA moment later, they split apart. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cThat had no business working as well as it did.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing beats a good hug.\u201d Dr. Carson laughs. \u201cHey, if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d actually love to see how this golf thing works. Never played, but if you\u2019re so invested, it must be good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the party miss you? You\u2019re the station commander, after all. Seriously, you don\u2019t have to stay. Golf\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to, James. Tell me about it. What am I looking at right now? I see a lot of brown grass and yellow bushes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFun fact, this is actually one of the most famous holes in golf. The 14th at Royal Dornoch. It's called Foxy, and it\u2019s unique since it\u2019s incredibly tough, but has no bunkers or quote-unquote real hazards. It\u2019s up in the very northern tip of Scotland, and-\" he trails off. \"I'm not going too fast, am I?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, you're fine. It's good to hear you talk like this again. I missed it.\"\n\n\nDr. Gould smiles faintly. \"I missed it too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Analysis of Titanian Methane-Based \nArchaeans\n\n\n\n\nJames Gould, PhD\n\n\n\n\nIt was enough of a surprise finding life on Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. But for all the novelty, it is essentially life as we know it. RNA wrapped inside a phospholipid membrane, utilizing water as a solvent. Nothing complicated yet, these cells clearly developed recently, but in a couple billion years, they\u2019ll likely end up as something recognizable.\n\n\nWhile we have always dared to dream of life on Titan, the reality of experimentation seemed to limit our search to subsurface oceans and cryovolcanoes. Methane has benefits and drawbacks as a replacement to water, but chief among the downsides is the temperature at which methane is liquid. 90\u00a0K at the coolest, 110 at the warmest (A far narrower band than water). Neither temperature is particularly hospitable, especially when it comes to life. Metabolism would be incredibly slow, and development would be expected to be equally slow. UMF experiments in a laboratory setting have always been unsuccessful, even when given years.\n\n\nAnd yet, here we are, staring at organisms doing what a fair number of biologists argue is impossible. Cells using methane as a solvent instead of water. Cells thriving at a temperature and environment that would almost instantly kill all but the hardiest Earth organisms.\n\n\nWhile we could never make it work in a lab, Titanian organisms look pretty similar to what scientists have theorized for 200 years. Instead of utilizing phospholipids, which simply can\u2019t form at such low temperatures, to form a cell membrane, these cells use acrylonitrile (CH\u2082CHCN) to achieve something almost identical, a cell membrane\u2013like structure tentatively referred to as an azotosome. They consume hydrogen, acetylene, and ethane and exhale methane. Needless to say, we\u2019ve repurposed a mostly unused room to deal specifically with the Titanian microbes. The smell is not pleasant.\n\n\nBeyond the methane, though, these little critters aren\u2019t actually all that different from Earth life. They were found near a cryovolcanic vent in Kraken Mare, nearly a kilometer below the sea\u2019s surface, in a remarkable mirror of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, feeding off nutrients and energy spewing out of the interior. The energy is crucial; the Titanian surface is too cold to allow acrylonitrile to form azotosomes. But they have RNA, same as the other \nArchaeans\n, and they feed and replicate just as everything else we\u2019ve found, and just as Earth methanogens do.\n\n\nI have no idea how life would continue to develop in such a place, and we won\u2019t find out in any of our lifetimes, but these things have found a niche in a strange environment, and we\u2019ll be studying them for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of UMF experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of materials\n\n\nPresence of life at day 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenus (clouds)\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupiter (clouds)\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitan (water-based)\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitan (methane-based)\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not the result I expected. And unless we get some news, it's the opposite of reality. Shows that we really don't understand how methane-based life operates. Obviously, it works somehow, but we've got a long way to go.\n\n\n\u2013JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of materials\n\n\nPresence of life at day 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuna\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeres\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropa\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnceladus\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriton\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting that we had success with Luna and not Enceladus or Europa.

And yet, the positive is there, while two of the most dynamic, interesting moons in the System give us nothing. What's the difference? What's the variable?\n\n\n\u2013JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't been myself the past few months. Rosalind is such a force of nature, and it's been so good having real, tangible data to work with, I've been following her leads without question. But I'm not just an exobiologist. I'm not just her student. I'm a researcher with the SCP Foundation. And we clearly need a new approach. Science as we know it isn't giving us the answers. I need to think on things for a bit.\n\n\n\u2013JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n June 28, 2249. 4:33 p.m., station time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Gould walks into the biology lab, a ream of papers in hand, where Dr. Rosalind Carson awaits, along with Dr. Intan Utami and Dr. Matija Vinkovi\u0107 of the chemistry department, who have been assisting in the analysis of all samples received from Earth.\n\n\n\u201cTell me the good word,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cPlease. Give us something.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould tosses the paperwork haphazardly toward her. \u201cCan\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill nothing in the Europa or Enceladus tests?\" Dr. Utami asks.\n\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\n\u201cWe're running around in circles,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cMonths of testing, and we know about as much as the people back home.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOn the bright side, I\u2019ve been reciting Martian codon sequences in my sleep,\u201d Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 says. \u201cMy wife is not thrilled about this development.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Dr. Gould collapses into his chair. \u201cEveryone back home will be expecting some grand revelation, but we\u2019re just stuck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the next cargo delivery will be full of new samples,\u201d Dr. Utami says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019ll be a good thing. More data is good, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need it,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cI\u2019m sure we won\u2019t receive anything truly new. More species, but nothing more complex. Just the same basic single-cell organisms.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMore evidence to suggest life developed very, very recently, in other words,\u201d Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 says.\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rosalind stands, pacing across the room. \u201cOkay. We spend all our time buried in genetic sequences and UMF trials. As Matija made clear, we now know an unhealthy amount about these organisms. Let\u2019s take a moment and back up. View this problem from orbit. What\u2019s the big picture?\u201d\n\n\nThe room is silent for a moment. \u201cCome on people, give me something!\u201d Rosalind waves her arms. \u201cTalk to me, basic summary. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess at its heart, our data and our hypothesis don\u2019t match,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cThe data suggests life developed on multiple and disparate worlds extremely recently. Not within the past few million years, or even a few thousand, but in the span of a human lifetime. Maybe even in the past few years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. All right, good!\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat leads us to one conclusion,\u201d Dr. Utami says. \u201cAlien biogenesis is directly connected to human activity and contamination. But there\u2019s a problem with that hypothesis.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Rosalind asks.\n\n\n\u201cThe alien life doesn\u2019t match Earth life,\u201d Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 says. \u201cThere\u2019s no common ancestor, no indication that they\u2019re related in any way. They're too primitive to have adapted from Earth life. Even viruses are light-years ahead , genetically speaking, and they\u2019re clearly not descended from viruses. Everything we\u2019ve found has been autotrophic, and viruses aren\u2019t autotrophs.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd where does that leave us?\u201d Rosalind stops in the middle of the room.\n\n\n\u201cIn a catch-22,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cAlien biogenesis must be related to human interference, but the evidence says it can\u2019t be. Like you said, we\u2019re running around in circles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGoddamn circles,\u201d Rosalind throws up her hands. Silence covers the room.\n\n\n\u201cI do have an idea,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cBeen stewing on it for a few days. But you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt this point, I\u2019d take divine intervention,\u201d Rosalind says, retaking her seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemember you said that,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve been researching for months, and we\u2019ve done so using the most thorough and advanced scientific tools and methods we have. Correct?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExhaustively thorough,\u201d Dr. Utami says.\n\n\n\u201cSo either we\u2019re colossal idiots overlooking the obvious, or the answer lies beyond science as we know it.\u201d\n\n\nRosalind groans. \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell me-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt has to be an anomaly. SCP-7268. But not the skip the Foundation negotiated with the government and the ISA. The real 7268.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Utami and Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 steal furtive glances at Rosalind. Her face alternates between anger and resignation. \u201cI suppose this is what I asked for,\u201d she says. \u201cI called for a Foundation researcher, and the Foundation researcher found an anomaly. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur basic premise is correct. It\u2019s Earth. It has to be. All these instances of biogenesis happening at once, it can\u2019t be a coincidence. And 7268 is correct in one regard: The anomaly is all about complex organic acids. But it\u2019s the opposite of what we thought. SCP-7268 doesn\u2019t prevent the development of DNA and RNA, it allows them. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re spreading. Panspermia. We spread life wherever we go.\u201d\n\n\nAn awkward silence fills the room as Dr. Utami and Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 shift in their seats. \u201cThat\u2019s a bold claim,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cAnd it does explain everything quite elegantly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anthropocentric to an extreme degree. We spent thousands of years believing Earth was the center of the universe, no scientist is going to accept a theory where mankind is central. It's bad science. Not without some serious data to back you up.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI suppose you did imply divine intervention was involved.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to call it that. Call it luck, fate, fortune, whatever,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cThe point is, we exist, and now, on planets and moons where we\u2019ve been, alien life also exists, where it didn't before. It\u2019s the only way to square all the data we have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about Jupiter?\u201d Dr. Utami asks. \u201cNo human\u2019s ever set foot there, not that there\u2019s even a surface to land on. It\u2019s only ever been probes in the upper atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not humans. It\u2019s Earth. SCP-7268 is intrinsic to the very planet. We take a rock, chuck it into space, it lands on the right planet, life will form there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d Dr. Vinkovi\u0107 asks. \u201cAnd why all at once? We first touched down on Mars nearly 300 years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, think about it like this,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cWhere have we found alien life? Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Titan. We visited those places a long time ago. All four were in the 20th century.\n5\n Now, we haven\u2019t found life on Europa or Enceladus. Two moons with massive subsurface oceans and geothermal energy to spare. Hydrothermal vents spewing out the ingredients of life. They\u2019re ideal fits, more so than any of the four places with life. I mean, methane-based life? We can't get it to work in a lab setting, and yet here we are, seeing it with our own eyes.\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is, we didn\u2019t get to those places until the tail end of the 21st century. Maybe it hasn\u2019t been long enough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I see where you\u2019re going with this,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cThe effect isn\u2019t instantaneous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly! It\u2019s almost like \u2026 the skip is a virus, and life is an infection. Weird way to put it, I know, but that\u2019s the most apt metaphor. You catch a virus, the infection doesn\u2019t start right away. It has to build up in the body, enough for the immune system to react to it.\u201d\n\n\nRosalind leans forward, clasping her hands in front of her. \u201cAs much as I hate ascribing anything to magic anomalies, it makes sense. But we\u2019ll need evidence. Lots of it. No half-measures this time. No guessing. No lying. We do this the right way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe right way,\u201d Dr. Gould says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Daniel Ogonowski, the O5 Council\n\n\nMessage sent:\n July 7, 2249\n\n\nMessage received:\n Aug. 3, 2249\n\n\n\n\nI know this is going to be problematic, but I have to ask: I need a Mark V Scranton Reality Anchor as soon as possible. Preferably before the next scheduled cargo transport.\n\n\nI'm sure you know everything I do when you read this, so hopefully this request won\u2019t come as a huge surprise. In order to prove my theory, I need time, and now that the Mark Vs incorporate a \ntime-acceleration module\n, they can give me all the time I need. I know they\u2019re barely out of the prototype stage and you\u2019re not ready to acknowledge their existence to the public, but they would accelerate my research (pun not intended, but unavoidable) to the remaining duration of my time on this station. It\u2019s either that or wait a few decades for life to generate on Europa or Enceladus \u2013 or a few centuries for 55 Serpens d.\n\n\nAlso, I figure you owe me one. After all, you did send me out of the System a couple months before the biggest discovery of my life. Not that I\u2019m bitter, but it would have been nice to have my name on a few of these newspaper articles.\n\n\n\u2013JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. James Gould\n\n\nMessage sent:\n Aug. 9, 2249\n\n\nMessage received:\n Sept. 15, 2249\n\n\n\n\nYou're being very thorough. We like it when our scientists are thorough.\n\n\nPlease note that we've disabled the vast majority of the device. The Mark V is \nnot\n something to be trifled with. Even in its limited state, failure to properly operate it could result in a runaway temporal disruption. We can't send an expert along, so do be sure to read the manual. And if you attempt to override our modifications \u2026 well, you won't live long enough to regret that decision. The Mark V is powerful enough to override \nnothingness\n, we cannot allow it to be improperly used.\n\n\nNo offense to you, of course, but you're a biologist, and this is far outside your normal purview. We wouldn't normally allow this, but we're as curious as you are. Your research and your notes have us intrigued.

While phosphorus can bind to simpler organic molecules, such as amino acids, it cannot form nucleic acids (RNA, DNA, etc.) or phospholipids, which are crucial for the development of cell membranes in most ecosystems.\n\n\nSCP-7268 is native to SCP-7268-1, otherwise known as the planet Earth. While research is ongoing, SCP-7268 does not appear to occur naturally on any other planetary or lunar body. However, it can be introduced to any celestial body via interaction with any material, probe, person, etc. sourced from a location where SCP-7268 is present. A sample including phosphorus is not necessary.\n\n\nOnce SCP-7268 is introduced to a new environment, native life \u2013 biologically and genetically distinct from SCP-7268-1 life \u2013 will develop within a period of 100-500 years. SCP-7268 will not create life on celestial bodies lacking in suitable organic materials and/or limited available energy. While SCP-7268 is known to form carbon-based life utilizing liquids other than water as a solvent (for example, methane), it is unknown whether it can form life based on non-carbon elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Aug. 23, 2250. 10:29 a.m., Eastern Standard Time\n\n\nThe following is a curated video transcript from James Gould's personal drone:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Gould and Rosalind Carson stand outside the O5 Council chamber at Site 17, surrounded by grimly drab gray halls. Dr. Gould breathes in deeply, and exhales slowly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to be this nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was easier being snarky with them when I was a hundred light-years away\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust remember, they\u2019re people, as much as they\u2019d like to pretend otherwise,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cThe anonymity shtick was rather gauche when they \u2026 what\u2019s the phrase they used, dropped the veil? When the Foundation went public. But now it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just as scared of them as I am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, more so. At least you\u2019re one of them. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill me.\u201d\n\n\nA dull tone echoed through the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you now,\u201d said a voice, so modulated by machinery that it came out as a monotone.\n\n\nThe door opens, and a guard escorts them in. It slams shut again, and for a brief moment the pair are entombed in complete darkness. Then a light flickers on, shining down from the ceiling, illuminating a silhouette in the form of a person. O5-1. Then another, and another. Thirteen lights in all. \u201cDr. Gould, Dr. Carson, welcome,\u201d the light over O5-1 turns red. \u201cYou have a rather bold proposal for us. We\u2019ve reviewed it, and we\u2019re willing to give you a chance to speak on its behalf. Convince us. Why should we enact this Project Panspermia?\u201d\n\n\nThirty minutes later, Dr. Gould and Dr. Carson finish their presentation. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d Dr. Gould asks.\n\n\n\u201cI have no issues with your proposal to time accelerate 55 Serpens to study the course of evolution,\u201d O5-3 says. \u201cSCP-7268 is present there, and nothing can be done about that. But I do have a concern regarding Project Panspermia. A simple one too. I just need a reminder. What does the C stand for in SCP?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew they\u2019d bring that up,\u201d Dr. Carson mutters.\n\n\n\u201cI heard that!\u201d O5-3 says. \u201cAnd in case our guest doesn\u2019t know, it stands for contain! We contain anomalies here, we don\u2019t throw them out into the universe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure about your classification here,\u201d O5-4 says. \u201cIf your file is correct, the absence of life is not anomalous. Life itself may not be anomalous, but SCP-7268 isn\u2019t containing anything. Technically, it\u2019s not Thaumiel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSomeone can\u2019t accept the inevitable progression of language,\u201d O5-12 says. \u201cThaumiel\u2019s been a byword for beneficial for a very long time. And I like your proposal, I do, but is this a job for the Foundation? Our budget is limited, and isn\u2019t the ISA already doing the job for you? According to you, so long as it comes from Earth, it can spread 7268. As you put it in one of your logs, all it takes is throwing a bit of rock at the right planet. An atmospheric probe is enough, correct?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cIn 40 years of interstellar exploration, we\u2019ve only been to 140 stars. That\u2019s 0.000000001% of the stars in this galaxy. Even the great Foundation can\u2019t expect to keep humanity going long enough to visit all 100 billion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about devoting the sum total of humanity\u2019s resources to this project,\u201d O5-7 says. \u201cA million autonomous interstellar probes, each programmed and fueled to visit thousands of stars, never to return home. And that\u2019s your minimum proposal. Minimum!\n\n\n\u201cAnd it would take thousands and thousands of years to seed the galaxy, and if life develops as it did on Earth, billions of years before we\u2019d see any tangible return. It\u2019s a project humanity would never see the end of.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that never should have been conceived,\u201d O5-3 says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what our feelings are about a dead universe, this is the way it is, and this is how it should remain. What was, shall be. What shall be, was.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow can you be so short-sighted!\u201d Rosalind cries out. \u201cWe\u2019ve already spread this thing, and we\u2019re going to keep spreading it, unless you\u2019re saying what I think you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to contain anomalies,\u201d O5-3 says. \u201cAnd humanity carries an anomaly. We can\u2019t take it back from the worlds we\u2019ve already infected, but we can ensure it won\u2019t get any further. It is not our right to play god with this universe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd speaking of anomalies, the rest of the universe doesn\u2019t have them, but we sure as hell do,\u201d O5-9 says. \u201cWho\u2019s to say this seeding project wouldn't bring all new skips for us to worry about?\u201d\n\n\nO5-1\u2019s light illuminates for the first time since the start of the meeting. \u201cDr. Gould, you\u2019ve been rather quiet. Perhaps you are formulating some wise words of counsel. Or an inspiring speech.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould and Dr. Carson exchange bemused looks.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this a long time. We know hopeless romantics when we see them,\u201d O5-13 says. \u201cYou won\u2019t be the first or the last.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing, Dr. Gould,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould steps forward. \u201cThree, you asked me a simple question, now let me ask you an equally simple question. Who was it that discovered life on Mars? His name is known across the System, I am sure you can remind me.\u201d\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\u201cHis name, since you seem to have forgotten, is Shi Lei Zhou, a humble farmer, lured to Mars by the promise of good wages. Millions have immigrated to the Red Planet to turn a dead, barren world into a bountiful garden. Mars now produces nearly 20% of the System\u2019s wheat, 15% of its corn, 30% of its soy \u2026 need I go on? Three, do you think we played God with Mars? After all, we brought life to a dead planet. We interfered with the natural order. Did you speak out against the Martian Homesteader Act?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone of us did,\u201d O5-11 says. \u201cThe benefits were too great. By moving agriculture off world, we\u2019ve restored nearly half of Earth\u2019s farmland back to its native condition, especially in the Amazon. Carbon dioxide\u2019s fallen more in the past 30 years than in the century before the Act passed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is something we did for selfish reasons,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cWe\u2019re transforming Mars because it benefits us. Project Panspermia would not benefit us all. It is purely selfless. We receive nothing but the knowledge that life will continue on after the last human dies. Would you be willing to risk the existence of life in this universe on the few planets we\u2019ve already visited? What if something happens? Something like an asteroid or gamma ray burst? Nature can be cruel.\n\n\n\u201cI am asking for a lot, I know. A million interstellar vessels, all autonomous and with enough fuel to visit thousands of systems each, capable of operating for hundreds, if not thousands of years. We would require the resources of not just our own Solar System, but dozens around us. The mining operations alone \u2026 the cost is staggering. I know. But how can you put a value on this? This project- we\u2019d be ensuring that our children, so to speak, our legacy, they won\u2019t be alone. The Milky Way would become a garden, thanks to us, just like we\u2019re making Mars into a paradise. It is such a beautiful universe too. What a shame it would be if, after humanity dies, there would be no one left to stare up at the stars. No one left to dream.\u201d\n\n\nO5-2 laughs. \u201cMake me a promise, doctor, don\u2019t ever try politics. Not with that speech. If there\u2019s one thing people don\u2019t like to hear, it\u2019s that their money is no object.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt would create a lot of jobs,\u201d O5-13 says. \u201cAnd we could use a few more na\u00efve visionaries in the UN. Be an excellent change of pace.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe conversation has drifted,\u201d O5-1 says. \u201cIf there is nothing else, the Council will deliberate and vote on your proposals, Dr. Gould. Thank you for your time.\u201d\n\n\nThe door opens, and light spills in. A guard approaches, and Dr. Gould and Dr. Carson are escorted out. As soon as they exit the chamber, the door slams shut again. \u201cThat could have gone better,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould slumps against a wall, rubbing his forehead. \u201cI knew they\u2019d be brutal, but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d- I never thought they\u2019d say no.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t said no,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cIt just has to be a majority, right?\"\n\n\n\u201cSo many spoke against us though,\u201d he says. \"Even if it does pass, unless the Council speaks with one voice on this, there's no way the UN or SCA will go for it. We need them too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cNo matter what they say or what happens next, you\u2019ve made this old woman proud. It\u2019s been a joy and a pleasure, working with you again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he says. \u201cPast couple years have \u2026 I\u2019ve felt like a complete person again. I needed this. I hope they don\u2019t take it away.\"\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done all we can. Now it\u2019s up to the politicians.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod help us all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal: Utilize Mark V Scranton Reality Anchors to accelerate time around 55 Serpens d until complex multicellular life emerges (i.e., \"Cambrian explosion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay\n\n\nO5-1, 05-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-7, O5-8, O5-9, O5-10, O5-11, O5-12, O5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNay\n\n\nO5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal: Endorse Project Panspermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay\n\n\nO5-1, 05-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-6, O5-7, O5-8, O5-9, O5-10, O5-11, O5-12, O5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n James Gould\n\n\nFrom:\n O5-3\n\n\nDate:\n August 24, 2250\n\n\nTime:\n 9:12 p.m.\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t often apologize in this job, but I feel I owe you one.

Waves beat against the rocks. Two figures, clad in environmental pressure suits and wearing large packs, exit the craft, walking amongst low-lying fern-like plants. They are quickly accosted by numerous miniscule flying arthropods.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kinda glad we\u2019re in the suits now,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the flies would be this bad. Almost as bad as Michigan in the summer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re curious,\u201d Dr. Carson says. \u201cThey\u2019ve never seen anything like us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBenefit of growing up on Lovell,\u201d Dr. Gould says. \u201cNothing there beyond the necessities for a functional ecosystem. No flies, no mosquitoes, nothing flying around that you didn\u2019t like having flying around.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey are beautiful,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cAn absolute marvel.\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould laughs. \u201cFirst time anyone\u2019s ever said that about a fly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on, James, we had to call in so many favors to get this trip down to the surface, you should-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say I should enjoy myself, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m enjoying myself plenty. It\u2019s a beautiful planet we\u2019ve made here.\u201d\n\n\nRosalind leans down, running her gloved hand along the fronds of a nearby plant. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I dreamed it would be. Do you know how long I\u2019ve wanted this moment? To walk on a new planet, awash in strange new life? To feel the wind on my face, the gentle softness of a leaf against my skin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe have to wear the suits. The risks of cross-contamination are too great. It\u2019s not just for the planet\u2019s protection, who knows-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am well aware of the risks. But I\u2019ve lived a long life. I\u2019m willing to chance it. I have to know.\u201d\n\n\nShe seals off her suit at the wrist, and twists her glove off. Her hand reaches for the plant again, and the long, green leaves slip through her fingers. \u201cMuch better,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know you want to, James. The Foundation will never know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind breaking one rule, but two? That\u2019s too much for my conscience.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\nDr. Gould drops his pack and rummages through it. He pulls out a folded metal rod, a rubber tube, and the head of a golf club. An 8 iron. He unfurls the metal pole and twists the clubhead on, then slips the rubber onto the other end. He retrieves a trio of golf balls, and drops them.\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\u201cYou hypocrite,\u201d Rosalind says. \u201cYou said Luna was an overrated tourist trap, riding off Apollo, and what do you do? You rip off the Alan Shepard Golf Experience! Even I know how overpriced that place is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even swing right because of the low gravity,\u201d Dr. Gould says as he takes a few slow practice swings. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the suit, but at least I\u2019ll stay properly planted.\u201d\n\n\nHe steps up to the first golf ball and takes a stilted swing. The ball barely makes it over the cliff\u2019s edge, tumbling down the rock face and into the churning sea with an unceremonious plop. \u201cPathetic,\u201d Dr. Gould mutters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a better swing than that.\u201d\n\n\nThe second shot is a low, scything hook, starting left and swinging ever further left. \u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he says. \u201cShould\u2019ve brought more than three. One of these has got to be decent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Dr. Carson says, reattaching her glove. \u201cYou can do this. I believe in you. Show that thing who\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\n\nThe backswing is slow and methodical. He pauses for the briefest moment at the top, and his body turns through, with the club dropping behind. The head strikes, clipping the ball and the ground a millimeter later. The golf ball sails far and high, hanging in the air for several seconds before landing in the ocean with a barely visible splash 150 meters distant.\n\n\n\u201cWas that-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dr. Gould says, posing with his makeshift club on his shoulder. He moves back toward Rosalind with a swagger. \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n\nShe holds her arms open. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh geez, Auntie Rosie, it wasn't that \u2026 oh fuck, did I-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my god, you did!\u201d Rosalind claps her hands against her helmet. \u201cOh, I\u2019m never going to forget this. My day has been made.\u201d\n\n\nShe rushes over and hugs him. \u201cBut the alien plants,\u201d he says. \u201cAren't they a bigger deal-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot even close.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course not. At least no one was around to hear it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
