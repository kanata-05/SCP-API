The area affected by Incident-Selmsdorf is not to be reforested.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7055 was the collective term for two trees\n1\n separated along the Inner-German Border from 1971 to 1990, designated SCP-7055-W (West) and SCP-7055-E (East). SCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were sentient, and able to communicate via Morse code (by making \u201ctapping\u201d noises\n2\n).\n\n\nSCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were ideologically similar to the nations they presided in, with SCP-7055-W being western aligned, and SCP-7055-E being the opposite. This ultimately ended up causing political strife between the two trees, which culminated in Incident-Selmsdorf, following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Incident-Report\u00a0Selmsdorf\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Incident-Report\u00a0Selmsdorf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n This devolved into \"war\", in which, via unknown means, both SCP-7055 instances were set aflame. Following roughly 10 minutes of burning, both instances violently exploded. Altercation was logged and decoded by personnel assigned to SCP-7055.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n It seems the Russians have finally grown brains.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n No, they were simply uprooted by a Treedovik scrooge.\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n The Communist treembles before Western might, unable to escape from the bark ages and follow modern treends.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Treed carefully Capitalist.\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n No. This will be a domino treeffect, soon your treeacherous government will fall too.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Is that a threeat?\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n Also no. It's a promise if you continue your treespasses against me.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Look friend, you're barking up the wrong tree right now. You are also violating our treety, so let's leaf this all behind, yeah?\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n Concidering recent treevents, that treety is void.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n It's finally time for this treechery to end, Communism is a parasite, and there is only one treetment for parasites. I have mobilized all branches of my militree. Today, the Boreal Wall will fall!\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Treetorous Westerners, you lot always betreey those different from you. If it's a war you want, it's a war you're gonna get.\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n This is it: World War Tree. The newest entree to the ultimate treelogy of histree\u2026And I can guarantree you it will be a Western victree. Another oakellant victory to end the centree- and another pineful failure for communist scum.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Oakay, how about we teak a step back\u2026We can solve this quarrel if we simply eliminate the root of the problem at hand.\n\n\nSCP-7055-W:\n Stop with the flattree, I'm done attempting to negotiate with someone who has such extreemist beleafs.\n\n\nSCP-7055-E:\n Prepostreeous! You're just another fascist, another weak sap from Austreeia, a fool! I walnut stand by as you corrupt the people! As you refuse to discuss aldernatives, you leave me no choice!
