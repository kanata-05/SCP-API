No maintenance of SCP-8202 is necessary. There are several pending requests to have the object destroyed in order to reverse-engineer its components.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8202 is an extraterrestrial spacecraft of unknown origin, measuring 70 meters in length, and having a wingspan of 55 meters (both pairs of wings). The anomaly has a neon-green canopy and a metallic, gray exterior, and lacks any exterior armaments. \nIts purpose is unknown.\n\n\nInside SCP-8202, several highly-secured chambers have yet to be accessed. Entering these chambers is an ongoing process, since a consensus was reached to cause minimal damage to the object, and forcibly opening them would likely cause considerable structural damage to SCP-8202.\n\n\nSince its initial descent toward Earth was undetected\n1\n, Foundation researchers have speculated that the ship may be capable of teleportation or other theoretical means of instantaneous travel.\n\n\nThe crew of the spaceship, belonging to an uncatalogued species, has perished. They were humanoid, organic lifeforms with Reptilian characteristics.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On August 3, 2029 at 19:00 EST, NORAD\n2\n detected an unidentified object over Lake Superior, moving at Mach 1.25 toward the vicinity of New York City. SCP-8202 continuously transmitted an encrypted message through multiple radio frequencies upon its detection, which has yet to be deciphered.\n\n\nAt approximately 19:12 EST, a squadron of F-35s\n3\n were scrambled to intercept the target along its flight path. At 19:15 EST, the F-35 jets launched a barrage of 25 air-to-air missiles\n4\n, which impacted SCP-8202 and caused it to crash land in Northern Michigan. One of the aircraft's four wings were blown off, but the fuselage suffered minimal damage.\n\n\nSeveral minutes after the ship crashed, its hull was breached through a gap caused by the missile strikes, \nwhere the spaceship's crew of 4 was found deceased\n. US military personnel\n5\n conducted a thorough search of the spacecraft and seized its contents, which included crates constructed from a titanium alloy.\n\n\nAddendum 8202-A/Video Log:\n\n\n\n\nHidden Bodycam Footage captured by Agent Howard Roberts\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n The following interaction took place between Agent Howard Roberts and Dale Walker, a SRPNT\n6\n representative.\n\n\nDate:\n August 6, 2029\n\n\n\n\n[START VIDEO]\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We need those crates.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n It's impossible, agent. We already handed over the UNES to your people.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Excuse me, UNES? Is that another acronym?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Unidentified Extraterrestrial Spaceship. Get with the program.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Anyways, we need to know what was inside of that ship. Merely having the ship tells us little about its purpose.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n No need: its purpose was obvious. It violated our airspace and disregarded numerous warnings to land, therefore making it a hostile alien entity. That's all.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n That's a huge leap to assume it can understand human language. And we can't just assume it was \"hostile.\"\n\n\nDale Walker:\n It was headed toward the most populous metropolitan area in our nation at high velocity. Don't be naive.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Please. \"High velocity.\" It was barely supersonic, and we have hypersonic aircraft. More importantly, did it cause any damage to any infrastructure or assets? Military or civilian. Did it engage anything whatsoever?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n That's irrelevant, but no. Nevertheless, its refusal to stand down justified its destruction. We won't compromise our national security to satisfy your hunger to collect alien pet projects.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We need to be more careful with these matters before we go to war with a technologically superior civilization. That's all I'm saying. Get it through your head.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n DARPA\n7\n is in possession of several of the ship's components, including a fully-intact engine. We can reverse-engineer it, harness this technology, and fight back when they return, turning their own weapons against them. I have no doubt that's what your people are doing as well, so spare me the theatrics.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n I'll ask you directly: what was inside of those crates?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Beyond classified. Pending disclosure.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We have agreements in place, you know this. Not only are you obliged to tell us, ethically and legally, but the Foundation has the means to get whatever we want. Don't play this game.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n The Foundation doesn't exist on paper. I cannot disclose information to a non-existent entity, now can I? Besides, what will you do? Force us to tell you?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n You people are so short-sighted. To hell with it.\n\n\n[END VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-B/Video Log:\n\n\n\n\nHidden Bodycam Footage captured by Agent Howard Roberts\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n August 9, 2029\n\n\n\n\n[START VIDEO]\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n So?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Exotic fruits and vegetables as well as dried meat belonging to an alien species.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n What else?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n What appeared to be medical supplies. All the crates were full.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n You idiots. What if the ship was on a diplomatic outreach mission? What if those were medics? That's why you don't just blow them out of the damn sky without an ounce of consideration!\n\n\nDale Walker:\n There is no indication that's true. At the same time, perhaps reconnaissance, or establishing a colony was their goal. Food supplies for the crew, that's all.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Don't you take me for a fool. There were hundreds of those crates, which were unopened. That's way more food than a small crew would need.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Use common sense, Howard. Travel between worlds would take an unfathomable amount of time.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Listen to yourself. They made it all the way to our world without opening a single crate. It couldn't have been that long. Why aren't you even open to the possibility that this species isn't hellbent on exterminating us? What if this was their way of cross-cultural exchange? Us humans love exchanging food and technology, don't we?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n \n(Long silence.)\n Your people dissected the alien specimens. What did you discover?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n I'll send you the full autopsy report\u2026 Their physiology isn't so different from ours, relatively speaking, including their metabolism. Wherever they came from, it isn't far from here. Or at least, it doesn't take long for them to reach Earth considering their stomachs were almost full.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Experimenting with these creatures has taken a toll on your mind. You're sounding like a sympathizer for the invaders. If the Foundation sides with these otherworldly savages when they arrive, the consequences will be dire for you. Remember that.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Oh, shut up. Don't even go there. \n(Pauses.)\n We discovered something else. You're not being honest with me, or you were deceived.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n I sense a rather sinister implication?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n It's not in the file you'll receive. But, our extraterrestrial visitors didn't die from head trauma like the initial report stated; the aliens likely survived the impact.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n And?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Ten gunshot wounds matching 5.56 NATO\n8\n. The bullets were extracted and there was a sloppy attempt to make it seem like shrapnel. Judging by the trajectory of the entry wounds and blood samples inside the ship, the crew was shot as they crawled toward the soldiers, completely unarmed. No attempt was made to even rescue them or give them a chance to be interrogated. Mr. Walker, they were murdered in cold blood.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n I see\u2026\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n I hope so.\n\n\n[END VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-C/Video Log:\n\n\n\n\nHidden Bodycam Footage captured by Agent Howard Roberts\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n August 11, 2029\n\n\n\n\n[START VIDEO]\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We breached one of the ship's chambers. It took our network of supercomputers 72 hours to crack the combination, only to discover that it was unique to a single door.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Don't keep me in suspense.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We discovered\u2026 what appear to be torture devices, along with some melee weapons and magnetic restraints.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Ah, no surprise there. And who do you think those devices were intended for?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n They ranged from very sophisticated to anachronistic wooden contraptions. It's senseless to speculate. Perhaps they wanted to torture humans, but it could also be a museum display of sorts. Maybe in the past, they were a violent and barbaric society and wanted to warn humans against following that path? There are millions of possibilities.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n You can't be that naive, agent.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Whatever. So, how did negotiations go?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n The Foundation will allow the US military to conduct some tests with the mysterious cylinders so long as DARPA is totally transparent with its findings regarding the other components. Regarding the engine, it was transferred to an undisclosed site near Nevada.\n\n\n[END VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-D/Test Log:\n\n\n\n\nTest Log: SCP-8202\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n Three cylindrical devices were retrieved from SCP-8202, which were transferred to a nuclear testing site in the Southwestern United States. Each machine was connected to a node that fed it with a high voltage electrical current. The following log records the results of the experiment, which was meant to determine the objects' function and destructive capability.\n\n\n\n\nCylinder A\n\n\nResult:\n After the node was triggered, the cylinder glowed brightly, reaching a temperature of 750,000 Celsius before disintegrating. The entire process occurred in 37 milliseconds.\n\n\n\n\nCylinder B\n\n\nResult:\n The cylinder briefly illuminated before shooting out sparks and deactivating. Attempts to reactivate it were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\nCylinder C\n\n\nResult:\n The cylinder immediately triggered an explosion. A bluish sphere of undetermined energy rapidly expanded from the origin point at a rate of 3 kilometers per second, vaporizing everything in its path for 0.5 seconds. However, no harmful fumes or radiation were produced by the event. 5 people died, including a Foundation field agent.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-E/Video log:\n\n\n\n\nHidden Bodycam Footage captured by Agent Howard Roberts\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n August 19, 2029\n\n\n\n\n[START VIDEO]\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Looks like your alien buddies weren't so friendly after all.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Just because someone has weapons, doesn't mean they intend to use it in an offensive capacity. Self-defense is a thing, you know.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n It was headed directly toward a major population center. What a coincidence. If those bombs went off in downtown Manhattan, it could've killed millions.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n If this species had the capability to travel across the stars, wouldn't they have invented missiles or another delivery system? If they wanted to, they'd already have destroyed those F-35s let alone New York.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n What if it was a strategic bomber of sorts? Perhaps the alien scum underestimated us.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n It wasn't.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n How can you be so sure?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n The Foundation breached the final chambers. It was determined that they were prison cells. Furthermore, our engineers concluded that the ship was not designed to deploy any military payload. We managed to power up the ship's control console and our language AI network decoded their language. The ship has a database of intergalactic criminals and the procedures for capturing or terminating them. There are millions of entries, including some linked to our planet.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n What\u2026?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n At worst, if this species has a warmongering military doctrine, what we did constituted a completely preventable act of war. But regardless of the consequences, in all likelihood, we destroyed a prison ship.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n See you next time. \n(Switches off microphone and enters a moment of contemplation.)\n This isn't on record, but I agree with you. We're handling the situation atrociously. Beyond atrociously. I need your help to avert a crisis that would mark the darkest chapter in human history. Let's meet again, please.\n\n\n[END VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-F/Video log:\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial Bodycam Footage captured by Agent Howard Roberts\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n Unknown\n\n\n\n\n[START VIDEO]\n\n\n(The two men meet in the middle of a dark, underground tunnel, with each scanning their surroundings as they approach.)\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n What the fuck is happening? This is getting way out of hand.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Don't be so loud.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n The CIA detained about forty of our agents and researchers. Two facilities in the Midwest were surrounded by a task force of National Guard and US Army soldiers. Were you aware of this?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Yes. Detained, nothing more. The distrust is mutual. No one was killed at least, and we both know your people will be quickly returned.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n The Foundation has legal guarantees from every major institution in the US government and is supposed to operate unimpeded. These are rogue elements completely overstepping their authority. Where's the chain of command?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n \n(Leans in to whisper.)\n SRPNT. They want to supplant you. Furthermore, they've been discreetly spreading fraudulent reports insinuating some of your personnel are collaborating with hostile alien species under the guise of research. They claim you're contacting the enemy in secret, that's why you won't disclose your operations.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n That's ridiculous.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Obviously. I hate to admit it, but you were right.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n The signal?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Yes, we decoded it. However, SRPNT's High Command wiped all digital traces of the alien transmission. This paper is the only existing copy. \n(He hands a sheet to Roberts.)\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n \n(Reading silently.)\n Damn it. We suspected this all along\u2026 But those bastards couldn't help themselves, could they?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n I know, I know. Unfortunately, it gets worse.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n How could it possibly get worse?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Did you bring the photos we discussed?\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Yes, these are the off-world fugitives corresponding to Earth. \n(Hands Walker a large file.)\n\n\nDale Walker:\n There are hundreds of them\u2026 \n(Perusing through the papers.)\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Damn right. Hiding somewhere here.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n I know where. Look. \n(Gives Roberts a collection of small photos.)\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n How the hell did you get your hands on this? Have you been spying on us?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Yes, but that's now how I acquired these photos. Ah, here it is. \n(Shows Roberts one of the pages from the file.)\n Look familiar? Compare it to the photo in your hand.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Yeah, it's a perfect match to Subject 56773\u2026 So?\n\n\nDale Walker:\n If I ever return to SRPNT, I'll be detained without question and convicted of treason for showing you this. I'm requesting that the Foundation can grant me protection.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n Not a guarantee, but I'll see what I can do.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Very well. Those photos were captured from CCTV cameras within SRPNT's headquarters. There have been several incidents like this, but no one knows outside of the organization. That photo you're holding: that's the head of SRPNT. He's using a device coated in an adaptive nanomaterial to transform his appearance, making him seem human.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n SRPNT is headed by a fucking space fugitive? That explains everything\u2026 The entire bureaucracy must be infested with them.\n\n\nDale Walker:\n Precisely. That's what I suspect. It's been compromised from within.\n\n\nAgent Roberts:\n We have a lot of work to do\u2026 First, let's get out of here. Follow me.\n\n\n[END VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8202-G/Initial Signal Translation:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe come (in peace), with no desire for warfare. But we shall return what we receive.
