A tricky one, this. But fear not, dear reader! We have devised the most effective of schemes to rid of this plague on our minds. All it takes is a nifty addition to your morning routine, which fits right in before breakfast and just after teeth affixation:\n\n\nIn your designated bathroom mirror, rattle your head like the bobble you are until you can feel his name resting on your tonsils. Rinse your mouth (however you please) until you've got his name on the tip of your tongue. Feel free to pluck him from your frontmost tastebuds, and flick him in the bin.\n1\n\n\nThat's all it takes! We thank you so much for your cooperation, and hope this stratagem can bring some smiles to that face. We know how tough this must be for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n As SCP-7757 is, at present, limited to Site-\u2318 staff, no major containment initiative within baseline reality has been deemed necessary. The spread of information about SCP-7757 is to remain limited to Site-\u2318 personnel exclusively. Any individual outside of Site-\u2318 found to be under the effect of SCP-7757 is to be detained at the site.\n\n\nPer the stipulations of the SM4 Pact of 2015, the Department of Surrealistics has requested the aid of the Foundation in suppression of an ongoing containment situation apparently related to SCP-7757. A body known as the SCRC\n2\n is to be created for this purpose, which is to implement all primary containment operations for the object and also enact broader reforms on Site-\u2318 as a whole. These policies are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of \nagnostic\n-sober employees, which are to be supplied by the Main Foundation for the purposes of enacting the following rules and protocols;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of Main Foundation-trained counselors and therapists, which are to be provided to staff upon request;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn increase in communication with \nMain Foundation liaisons\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prohibition of excessive agnostic usage by Surrealistics Department personnel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifts to the Site-\u2318 administrative hierarchy for the purpose of mitigating inefficiencies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prohibition of access to Site-\u2318 Wing Four.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, \"Steven Y. Hayes\" is to remain on the Telecommunications Monitoring Office's list of keywords. Any request by non-Site-\u2318 personnel seeking the meaning of this term are to be denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7757 is the formation of a crack. It is a small splintering at our base, slowly eating away at our non-concrete like a vulture feasting on the carcass of a vole. It is a fragment of a memory which has been siphoned from our crania. It is a name and a face engraved on a plaque we all know of but cannot prove, hoisted high on the wall of some far off corridor. It is the absence of anything beyond an image and a name.\n\n\nSCP-7757 is Steven Y. Hayes. It is someone once held dear. It is someone who worked with us and worked like us and worked very, very hard. It is someone who most certainly did none of those things, nor anything at all. It is a blank spot on our receipts, a career of solely absence. It is someone who was certainly worth keeping around.\n\n\nSCP-7757 is a new sort of dementia, and a lie all the same. It is an ardent longing for a sense of wholeness that we can only assume once existed. It is the absence of mortar between our bricks, leaving us flimsy and growing ever flimsier. It is the knowledge that we could\u2019ve done something, but out of ignorance and blindness chose not to. It is the fact of our powerlessness to do anything at all.\n\n\nSCP-7757 is a silent, creeping mold. It is the rot beneath the loose floorboards of Fourfold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7757 is the general consensus among staff at Site-\u2318 that a researcher by the name of Steven Y. Hayes, henceforth referred to as SCP-7757-1, was at some point employed by the Foundation, despite no record of any person under that name. Site-\u2318 staff under the influence of SCP-7757\n3\n4\n will typically attribute the following characteristics to this supposed entity:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7757-1 is male;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is of above average height;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has short brown-gray hair, blue eyes, and pale complexion;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe originates from Sofia, Bulgaria;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was Site-\u2318's director of Intangible Anomalous Applications (IAA);\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was hired by the Foundation in the late 1990s;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is quite reclusive;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe enjoys chess, though is not particularly good at the game;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe mysteriously disappeared at some point in mid 2019.\n\n\n\n\nOther details are typically included as well, though with significantly less consistency, often contradicting one another both between separate accounts and occasionally within the same account. Recounting memories created or augmented by SCP-7757 is almost universally a difficult and often psychologically taxing process for Site-\u2318 staff. Since the onset of SCP-7757 in early 2020, Surrealistics Department Personnel have reported lower morale and significantly reduced productivity.\n\n\nAmnestic and mnestic agents have been shown to have no effect on SCP-7757. The existence of SCP-7757 likely precludes the possibility of SCP-7757-1 having been actually erased from baseline reality retroactively by a CK-Class Event, as such widespread presence of lingering memories regarding pre-restructuring iterations of reality would constitute a significant statistical anomaly, compared with data from known CK-Class Events.\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDetecting Two (2) Appended Files.

Randall\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Gob Wilkins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n I have a meeting at 1:00 so we're gonna have to get through this quickly okay?\n\n\nWilkins:\n Works for me.\n\n\nRandall:\n What can you remember of SCP-7757-1?\n\n\nWilkins:\n Eh? Sorry, I don't really do the whole numbers thing.\n\n\nRandall:\n Steven Hayes.\n\n\nWilkins:\n Oh yeah\u2014yeah, I know him. What ever happened to him?\n\n\nRandall:\n [mumbling] \nDoes nobody here fucking read any-\n\n\nWilkins:\n I got bad ears, kid. Speak up.\n\n\nRandall:\n SCP-7757-1 does not and has never existed.\n\n\nWilkins:\n Since when?\n\n\nRandall:\n Since ever, presumably.\n\n\nWilkins:\n Eh, damn shame.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nRandall:\n So. What can you tell me about \"Hayes?\"\n\n\nWilkins:\n Hayes? I thought he never existed?\n\n\nRandall:\n Yes but- [sigh] just relay any memories you have, regardless of their source.\n\n\nWilkins:\n Well I can't say too much about him. Far as I can tell from what little I got up here [gesturing to his forehead], he was always holed away in his office. Would barely see him around the site unless he was grabbin' something from the porti-pantry down by the lodge. What else, eh, he was a lankier guy. Good teeth, good smile. Brown hair, but you could tell it wouldn't be brown too much longer. Had that grayish-grey feel to it.\n\n\nRandall:\n Would it be fair to say he was a recluse?\n\n\nWilkins:\n Sorta? He was sociable though, pleasant fella whenever we'd talk. Just\u2026 busy, I guess.\n\n\nRandall:\n What was he doing in his office?\n\n\nWilkins:\n He was the IAA Director.\n\n\nRandall:\n Meaning?\n\n\nWilkins:\n I don't really do the letters kid, couldn't tell ya. I just know\u2014or don't know, I s'pose\u2014that his office was practically empty whenever I went in there to clean, so I don't know how much he was getting done. Room nineteen-and-a-half,\n8\n9\n it was, on the second real floor. Two seats and a chessboard, that's all he kept in there.\n\n\nRandall:\n Is that standard for employees here?\n\n\nWilkins:\n Nothin' is standard for employees here.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nWilkins:\n What really \ndid\n happen? Disappearance or otherwise.\n\n\nRandall:\n Classified.\n\n\nWilkins:\n I'm a fuckin' Janitor! My clearance definitely supersedes yours, kid.\n\n\nRandall:\n The employee hierarchy has been restructur-\n\n\nWilkins:\n Who gave you that fuckin' authority? Was it Sequita', eh? He tryna' cozy up with those main Foundation fucks after all the cracks started showin'? That's what this is 'bout, ain't it. Irv was tryna get this old fuck outa my head so down stays down and up keeps at its horseshit but now I've got your stupid mouth telling me I ain't the boss here? Telling me I can't clean \nWing Fo-\n\n\nRandall:\n Excuse me.\n\n\nWilkins:\n -The \nfuck\n are\u2026 did I say I was done talking? Did my teeth stop churning? I want some fuckin' answers or I'm-\n\n\nRandall:\n \nExcuse me.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n Are we going to get through this, or do you want to go back to cleaning up that fractal in the hallway?.\n\n\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n That's what I thought.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nWilkins:\n Am I getting another question or are you just gonna make me sit here? Cuz' I got meetings too, ya know.\n\n\n\n\n[B. Randal flips through a small notebook.]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n Okay, what's the last memory you have of SCP-7757-1?\n\n\nWilkins:\n That still Steve?\n\n\nRandall:\n I- yes, we've gone over this.\n\n\nWilkins:\n I told you, I don't do the numbers! Christ on a candlestick. Whatever. Left Brain's sayin' I bumped into him just outside his office a few years back. He was just was standing there, staring at the ceiling fan. He had\u2026 there were almost tears in his eyes, I reckon. He seemed less sad than scared though. I asked what was up and he said\u2026 what was it? He said \"Nothing.\" Yeah that's right. It wasn't dismissive or nothing though, he seemed genuine. Right Brain ain't sayin' shit.\n\n\nRandall:\n Okay, that should be enough. Now go clean up that fractal. I nearly fell into it this morning.\n\n\nWilkins:\n Oh, one quick thing, Right Brain got a question: who the fuck is \"Steven Y. Hayes?\"\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n B. Randall\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Thomas Evans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n As soon as you heard we were organizing these you requested this interview, is that correct?\n\n\nEvans:\n Yes.\n\n\nRandall:\n Why is that?\n\n\nEvans:\n It's very\u2026 hmm, \"hush hush\" around here. This has been a sort of a taboo ever since we started noticing it.\n\n\nRandall:\n SCP-7757?\n\n\nEvans:\n Yes.\n\n\nRandall:\n What's your personal experience with the phenomenon?\n\n\nEvans:\n I think, must have been 2020, maybe a bit before though, my thoughts just started clouding. Stratocumulus, cirrus, no real rhyme to it. Just smoke up my ears, in one and out the other and then off the west.\n\n\nRandall:\n Is\u2026 do you mean that literally?\n\n\nEvans:\n What?\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n Never mind. Just continue.\n\n\nEvans:\n Yeah so, I started feeling like I'd lost something. There were gaps in my memory. Spaces in my head I couldn't visit, these strange patches of gray and white sewn over what had been.\n\n\nEvans:\n Slowly and all at once, and maybe some point in between, some alien force had flung itself into the fog. Not filling the gaps, just sitting next to em. In half my goddamned memories there was this man all the sudden, self inserted. Someone I've never met, trying to convince me that he'd been in my office, in the break room, at my fucking wedding. But I've checked! I mean\u2026\n\n\n\n\n[Evans grabs a cellphone, which has been dangling from the ceiling. He proceeds to swipe through several files before pointing the screen at Randall.]\n\n\n\n\nEvans:\n See this? This was a fishing trip. Dave set it up, you know how he does. Team building or whatever, but\u2026\n\n\n\n\n[Evans scrolls to another photo, displaying four people. None match any given description of SCP-7757-1.]\n\n\n\n\nEvans:\n This was everyone that went. I \nknow\n that this was everyone that went. But every time I think back to it there's a fifth man between me and Dave: brown hair and a tad taller than I. And to the left of all us there's another blank space, another whiteout smudge. I want him out of my fucking head.\n\n\n\n\n[The smartphone disintegrates into a pile of gray dust, which Evans promptly puts in his coat pocket.]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n When you try to conceptualize SCP-7757-1, what can you gather about it?\n\n\nEvans:\n Tall? Brown hair, I think. He was Eastern Europe- no, not \"was.\" He wasn't \nanything\n. Fuck, it's so\u2026 it's like my brain is automatically assuming its existence. Trying to force me into accepting it. Like, every time I catch it in a memory, my immediate instinct is to smile. Something wants me to acknowledge that this\u2026 thing was friendly, that it had a good work ethic. I think part of me wants to as well.\n\n\nRandall:\n Hmm. You mentioned work ethic. What job would SCP-7757-1 have done?\n\n\nEvans:\n Intangible Anomalous Applications. No one really knows what it's for, but the division's been around for at least a decade now. Something to do with reverse engineering stuff before it exists. Or, that might be the other way around. I don't know, it sounds kinda stupid to me.\n\n\nRandall:\n Got it. Marcel informed me there's been a productivity decrease at the site since this started?\n\n\nEvans:\n Yeah, it's been slow. Still trudging along but\u2026 it's all just so wrong. It doesn't feel\u2026 it's so hard to put it into words. This, I just know this whole thing isn't right. Something's missing and something that really shouldn't be here at all is clinging to the Mayfly like a nematode. It's hard to work when you know the work's not working and something's gone amok.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nEvans:\n Could we take a breather, for a bit? I'm feeling heavy headed and the fog is\u2026 it's very\u2026\n\n\nRandall:\n I think that's enough for today, actually.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n B. Randall\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Irving N. Gat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n Irving, can you tell me a little bit about what you know of SCP-7757-1?\n\n\nGat:\n I'm not sure. I haven't tried.\n\n\nRandall:\n Talking about SCP-7757-1?\n\n\nGat:\n Not to you I don't think. And there's a big difference between \"telling\" and \"talking.\" Note that for the record.\n\n\nRandall:\n This will all be going on the record.\n\n\nGat:\n Well isn't that exciting!\n\n\n\n\n[Irving Gat smiles. B. Randall does not.]\n\n\n\n\nGat:\n So, you want to hear about Hayes?\n\n\nRandall:\n For formality's sake, we're gonna be sticking to SCP-7757-1 going forward.\n\n\nGat:\n No, but that wasn't his name. Steven. Steven, Steven, Even Steven Hayes. I think I'd remember, he was my\u2026\n\n\nRandall:\n Your\u2026?\n\n\nGat:\n We were colleagues. I think. Or, well, maybe not something that\u2026 personal. We were certainly friends. Nothing more than that, though I'd've been open if he was ever up for a ball game and knew how to pitch, if you can catch that drift. But that's beside the point\u2014just a little to the left of it. What I mean to say is that I'm familiar with the good fellow.\n\n\nRandall:\n \nSure.\n Are there any more\u2026 specific details you can piece together?\n\n\nGat:\n You like to get to the point, I can see. I like that in you. Drive! My old Pee-Pap called it moxie. Steven\u2026 he was a smidgeon shorter than I am now, but I'm still growing, if you haven't noticed. He had\u2026 er, blue eyes. Un-bald. He, hmm.\n\n\nRandall:\n 77- \nwhatever\n. Personality wise?\n\n\nGat:\n He liked to keep his distance, mentally and physically. Used to just kind of stare off, I suppose. \"Aloof,\" as the kids say. He was\u2026 there's something else. He\u2026 I'm sorry sir I just keep drawing blanks.\n\n\nRandall:\n I don't think you're alone in that.\n\n\nGat:\n He was quite bright, I think? Knew two things or three, that's for sure. But\u2026 I feel like I should know something I don't. Or I do know something I won't? I just, it's not coming up clear.\n\n\nRandall:\n Would it be fair to say that SCP-7757-1 hasn't fully embedded itself in your consciousness?\n\n\nGat:\n You speak so very funny, Mr. B.! I don't think I know what you mean.\n\n\nRandall:\n I mean, the memories created by SCP-7757 haven't fully realized.\n\n\nGat:\n No, no. This blight does not create, it destroys. Nips at our gray cells till there's nothing but stem. You've missed the mark somewhere, I fear.\n\n\nRandall:\n All evidence points to the nonexistence of SCP-7757-1, and so that's the stance the Foundation has taken on the issue. SCP-7757 is a fabricatory phenomenon.\n\n\nGat:\n I thought this was a serious interview.\n10\n11\n\n\nRandall:\n I am being fully serious.\n\n\nGat:\n Zounds, sir! Pardon my French, but\u2026 by gosh, he's sat in that same damn chair you've claimed! The man was an institution!\n\n\nRandall:\n That's verifiably false.\n\n\nGat:\n Nothing, Mr. B., is verifiable, and even less is anything false!\n\n\nRandall:\n Irving, the staff here have tried your\u2026 \nmethods\n. And clearly something wasn't working. It needed fresh eyes, a new lens. So we're trying something new.\n\n\nGat:\n But my plan \nwas\n working! His name was coming loose and dripping straight down to the can! The cracks were smoothing out and \nWing Four\n was finally healing!\n\n\nRandall:\n Irv-\n\n\nGat:\n It almost felt right, it was so, so close. It just needed time, and I was giving it that time but Marcel went and swept that sand right out my glass and into yours; now we're stuck here being foolishly certain and most \ncertainly\n incorrect.\n\n\nRandall:\n What exactly was it you were doing, Irving? I read your old procedures. They were practically chickenscratch.\n\n\nGat:\n The mourning process is tricky to lay out on paper.\n\n\nRandall:\n What is there to mourn?\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nRandall:\n Are we going to have to continue this another time? Or are you going to cooperate with me on this.\n\n\n\n\n[Gat sits up from his seat.]\n\n\n\n\nGat:\n You horseweed-huffing prick.\n\n\nRandall:\n Hmm.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above findings have been determined inconclusive.
