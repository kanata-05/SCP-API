No less than four armed guards should be stationed within the nearby Foundation Site-7 at a time to monitor the area and ensure Senior Researcher Regan Morgan is not interrupted during her research on SCP-7570. Anyone caught trespassing on the site should be captured and questioned on their knowledge of the anomaly. A majority of trespassers are lost locals who should be amnesticized and placed back into society according to standard procedure. Members of any GOI should be brought directly to the O5-Council for questioning.\n\n\nThe erasure of SCP-7570-1 is the highest priority of the Foundation. Senior Researcher Regan Morgan has been given a temporary extension on her clearance due to her relationship with SCP-7570-1. Any anomaly she thinks might be beneficial to her research will be provided to her after review of the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7570 is a machine housed within an abandoned lumber mill near Milam, Texas. SCP-7570 is a temporal displacement device capable of transmitting a constant projection from any point in the past back to the present. The device can simulate the past with no apparent limit; as the furthest point reached by Senior Researcher Regan Morgan was well beyond the creation of our universe.\n\n\nThe Foundation first became aware of SCP-7570 after the minuscule town of Milam, Texas was discovered to be consuming power equivalent to that of Chicago. Foundation Agents investigated the abnormality and discovered the dead body of Francis Connery laying against SCP-7570. Connery was a NASA scientist and known procurer of anomalous technology. The Forensics Department ruled this death a suicide due to the self-inflicted gunshot wound. Forensic investigators stated that the incident happened weeks before SCP-7570's discovery. The function of the anomaly was soon discovered along with Connery's journal\n1\n which was wholly destroyed excluding its last page. Regan Morgan\u2019s journal\n2\n contains all information gathered from the notes Connery destroyed.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: Francis Connery\u2019s Journal\n\n\n\n\nWhy did God create the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? He created the world down to the last atom; he knows everything that has and will happen so why did he create the tree, knowing the serpent would seduce Eve into defiance? Why did he create humanity, knowing of their coming betrayal? Why did he deny Cain\u2019s offering, knowing of the coming fratricide? Why did he give Samson a critical weakness knowing it would be exploited? Why did he make David see Bathsheba bathing on the roof knowing of the blood soon to be spilled? Why did he sow the wind knowing he\u2019d reap the whirlwind?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: Senior Researcher Regan Morgan\u2019s Journal\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0FILE:\u00a0Entries\u00a01-6\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 1\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m being relocated today. I wasn\u2019t told much but I don\u2019t really think it matters anyway. Our funding has been running low for months and Lonnie told me yesterday we\u2019d likely be thrown to random anomalies soon. Can\u2019t say I was too surprised when I got the email today. In fact, the only emotion I felt was anger. Some random Mekhanite piece of trash in backwater East Texas is apparently much more important than our work here. So important they only sent a Junior Researcher to investigate and conjure up the report.\n\n\nIt\u2019s times like these that I wonder why we do this job. Yes, I know, secure, contain, protect\u2014but what does that mean at this point? The majority of people here consider the Foundation a prison but that\u2019s not true\u2014prison offers a chance at rehabilitation. The Foundation is a tomb, we lock up things and leave them to rot. Endlessly labeling and categorizing inconveniences before throwing them in a tomb and locking them away. Lonnie was going to change that, Lonnie was going to offer rehabilitation for humanoid anomalies, we were going to change the way the Foundation operated forever. Then they cut our funding and stole our researchers in order to continue labeling and organizing inconveniences for them.\n\n\n\n\nAmelia. I do it for her. After I do this I\u2019ll try to regroup with Lonnie, see if we can salvage the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 2\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve learned a bit more about the anomaly I\u2019m assigned to and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not excited. It\u2019s incredible they\u2019re letting such a low-level operative work on such an anomaly. Though, in all honesty, I don\u2019t think the Site Director really understood the impact this thing could have. Okay, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, let me try to explain what it is.\n\n\nAs far as the MTF could tell, it was a time machine. A big globe-shaped monstrosity that allows you to observe any time in the past. It doesn\u2019t travel forward, but that doesn\u2019t take away from how incredibly important this thing is. Any mystery that history has forgotten can be completely clarified. Cold murder cases? Solved. Speculating about dinosaurs using only their bones? A thing of the past. The birth of humanity? You can watch it like a movie. I\u2019m shaking thinking of the possibilities. My job is to find out how it works, write a report, and they've given me a week to do it. A full week. Fuck that, I'm exploring now,\n\n\n\n\nI ship out tomorrow; they gave me two MTF agents to be my guard dogs. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be able to stick around before they realize what this can do but I hope it\u2019s long enough to hit some of my highlight areas, I\u2019m going to write ideas here while I\u2019m traveling:\n\n\n-Dinosaurs.\n\n\n-What happened with the whole \u201cCroatoan\u201d thing.\n\n\n-The first humans.\n\n\n-The audience's reaction to Vader in \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d on opening night.\n\n\n-Give Laika a pat on the head.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come up with more but right now that\u2019s all I have. I\u2019m in Milam now, we\u2019re set up in this cabin a few miles out from the machine. I got my own room and the two MTF guys are sleeping together, I offered to take the couch but they seemed to prefer being together. I tried to strike up a conversation but the guys mostly kept to themselves. That\u2019s fine, I might actually enjoy that more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 3\n\n\n\n\nThe machine is more complex than I originally anticipated. I\u2019ve been here all day and have only now started to understand how it operates. I\u2019ll do my best to transcribe that here, but in all honesty, it's equivalent to a mouse explaining how an air fryer works. When I got here I went through the motions of setting up a desk and laptop outside of the globe. With my battle station ready, I looked through the journals and files that the original owner left behind. I was doing my best to understand the tatters of writing and diagrams but it seemed like the notes were useless jargon even before they were ripped apart. There are, however, a bunch of mentions of something called a \u201cwrist-pad\u201d, from what I can tell it\u2019s what controls the machine. I need it in order to operate SCP-7570 properly and until I find the device our time machine is nothing more than a hunk of unhelpful garbage. After an hour of searching with no luck, I approached the MTF guys to see if they knew anything about it.\n\n\nWhen I stepped outside the smell of cigarette smoke hit my breath, the guards appeared to have made themselves at home. They sat on two worn folding chairs facing the yellow forest ahead. As I approached I watched them pass the dart back and forth with stories following close behind. I asked them about the wrist-pad much to their annoyance. Apparently, they knew about something found on the previous owner that could be described as a \"wrist-pad\" but it was off the nearest site, still attached to the dead guy. Annoyance made a reappearance when I told them I needed the device. I impatiently watched a game of rock, paper, scissors that felt like it had a few too many ties, but eventually the guy named Adam lost. The MTF agent grumbled as he called the guys transporting the body and left to meet up with them for the wrist-pad. After that, the other guy, Joseph, got bored and joined me in the lumber mill.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph took an interest in the machine that I didn\u2019t expect from him. At the moment I was studying the wiring and he started asking questions, a lot of questions. To be honest I couldn\u2019t answer most of them as I didn\u2019t really know what I was looking at myself. I spent my early career working on SCP-217 so I knew the Mekhanite signature. Yet, this didn\u2019t match any tech from the church. The more I looked the less the machine made sense, at times appearing to be a random assortment of parts. Wires seemed to create loops back into themselves while some didn\u2019t seem to connect to anything at all. Whatever was holding this thing together seemed to be thaumaturgical in nature rather than mechanical.\n\n\nUpon telling Joseph it was a time machine he seemed to latch on to the idea. He began to attack me with questions, asking about things in history we had never figured out. The zodiac killer, JFK, was the moon landing faked, the tank guy from that one video. I couldn\u2019t show him any of these things without the wrist-pad but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t turn the machine on. You see, the wrist-pad controlled SCP-7570 but it didn\u2019t activate it. While tinkering that the inner workings I discovered the simulation automatically activates when someone steps inside. The only time it could show was a bit grim but Joseph was insistent we check it out. With nothing more I could really gather from the outside, I relented and led him in.\n\n\nThe interior was a sight to behold. As the two of us stepped inside we stared up at the giant dome looming twenty feet over us, the walls lined with an assortment of lenses and screens. The floor was soft and gave a bit when you stepped on it, not unlike a trampoline. There was little order in the chaos on the walls but that didn\u2019t take away from the grandiose feeling gathered from stepping inside. It carried the same aura as a throne or cathedral. I led Joseph inside and shut the hatch behind us. The machine activated and almost instantly the dome started to fill with green smoke. I wasn\u2019t sure what the smoke was but when it slithered up my body I could smell the distinct aroma of roasted chestnuts. I stepped out into the middle and waited until all I saw was green and then watched the lenses activate.\n\n\nThe green curtains fell away as light started to shine through the clouds. Eventually, we saw shapes slowly form around us until we were no longer in the dome. We were standing outside the lumber mill, birds were singing, and the morning sun was peeking over the horizon. Joseph was in amazement, asking me how it worked.\n\n\nI explained as best I could, telling him that the lenses simulate the environment onto the smoke around us. The entire machine basically acts as a projector that shows exclusively the past, we aren\u2019t actually taken back through time, only shown it. The reason we were able to walk around was due to the floor acting as a kind of treadmill, when I stepped forward the floor would move back, keeping me in the middle and moving the simulation accordingly.\n\n\nI watched him reach out and touch a tree only for it to vanish into green smoke, he laughed, obviously in pure awe. I felt a smile creep across my face, the thought crossed my mind that Amelia would like this. Joseph reminded me of her in a lot of ways, there was a spark of light in his eyes that filled me with bittersweet nostalgia. Eventually, I pushed the thought from my mind and stepped forward, leading Joseph into the lumber mill.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cThe right question is-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that joke!\u201d Joseph said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it in every time travel movie for the past decade.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a pause for a moment before I quickly blurted out, \u201cWhen are we!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMotherfucker.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut to answer your question we\u2019re a few weeks before our current time, it\u2019s the last time the machine was powered on with a wrist-pad inside of it.\u201d\n\n\nJust as I finished speaking a man burst from the machine, he was older and looked to be covered in a thin layer of grime. He seemed frantic, like a feral animal, stumbling and breathing heavily. This was Francis Connery, another aspect of the mission that Joseph was uninformed on, referring to him only as \u2018dead guy\u2019. I found it strange that MTF agents weren\u2019t told so much about the missions they were assigned to. It seemed the Foundation's lack of resources in the previous months had affected more than just us researchers.\n\n\nI explained Connery to him using the information that came with my files. He was a NASA scientist and very skilled at his job. So skilled, in fact, that he learned about the anomalous world and evaded amnesticization. It took the Foundation one week to decide he wasn\u2019t worth the resources and gave up on the search. Joseph found this tale unbelievable as he considered the Foundation pretty ironclad in its operations. This isn't an uncommon belief, but the truth is that this happened a lot more than most people probably think. Sometimes we can\u2019t find the person or the situation is so crazy that witnesses sound insane to any normal individual. Most of the GOIs consist of these civilians who ran from the Foundation and had nowhere else to turn. Connery was one such person who took a keen interest in anomalous tech he could purchase from MC&D.\n\n\nJoseph listened to my lengthy explanation with bated breath while Connery took his time shredding and burning years of research around us. I found Joseph\u2019s fascination endearing, his curiosity and eagerness to learn would have made him a brilliant researcher in another time. It also led him to his next question.\n\n\n\u201cWhat made him go all crazy and shit?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo idea, whatever he saw he didn\u2019t write about.\u201d I answered, \u201cOr maybe he did and just shredded it. The only thing I\u2019ve found that\u2019s legible is the short paragraph he\u2019s about to start writing right\u2026 now.\u201d I said as Connery picked up the book and wrote wildly.\n\n\nJoseph stood at his side, watching him write and reading it aloud, when Connery finished Joseph asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I lied. \u201cSeems to me he just went crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t have any idea, theory, or anything like that?\u201d he said, calling my bluff.\n\n\n\u201cWell, there is one theory.\u201d I said, \u201cHe was a very religious man from what I\u2019ve been told. First one in the pew every Sunday type. From how he\u2019s writing, it sounds like Francis is listing inconsistencies he\u2019s noticed but never acknowledged till now. My guess is that he found something that didn\u2019t align with his religion. It was too much for him and he\u2026\u201d we both fell silent as Connery retrieved his gun and killed himself with no hesitation.\n\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Joseph said, \u201cThat\u2019s depressing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you religious?\u201d I asked, unsure I could provide any comfort if he said yes.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d he thankfully replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s many in our line of work that can be. I\u2019ve seen things happen to men that the cruelest gods wouldn\u2019t allow. But I was, and I think it still has a hold on me in ways I don\u2019t realize. When I think of things like the past and future I picture scripture without even thinking about it. I guess I\u2019m like him in a lot of ways, you commit so much of your life to something that it\u2019s hard to let go.\u201d\n\n\nJoseph seemed deep in thought and I experienced the all too familiar feeling of not knowing what to say when someone spills their heart out to you. Eventually, I went with the old classic, \u201cIt be like that.\u201d\n\n\nWe eventually left with the bitterness of the situation still residing inside of us. As we stepped outside Joseph offered me a cigarette to help with the grimness. I took it and talked with Joseph until Adam returned. I probably shouldn\u2019t be writing all this non-vital information here but it\u2019s kinda therapeutic. Might make this my personal journal and have another strictly for work. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\n\n\n\nWith the wrist-pad, traveling through time is now possible but I still haven\u2019t been able to do so. The device itself is a tablet attached to a brace meant to clamp around the user\u2019s forearm. I wasn\u2019t delighted to see the numerous needles lining the inside of the brace, likely meant to create some neural connection. I really don\u2019t get paid enough for this but I bit down on a piece of wood I found and latched the device into my forearm. The pain is really impossible to describe so I won\u2019t try to. Just know Joseph found be passed out on my desk because of it.\n\n\nWith that done I attempted to operate the machine and there\u2019s a few changes I\u2019ve noticed since I acquired the wrist-pad. The first being that the simulation seems much more vivid than before. On my previous explorations the world looked clear enough but there were complications. Some places looked more blurry than others, not unlike my eyesight without glasses. Since I\u2019ve acquired the wrist-pad that issue is completely resolved and I\u2019ve discovered that I no longer require glasses within the dome at all. This is likely the neural connection filling in the blanks that the smoke and lenses couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve also discovered that I can\u2019t as easily phase through objects conjured within the simulation. Now, when I touch a tree I feel resistance and the texture of the bark; yet with enough effort, I can still push through.\n\n\nAs for the tablet itself I\u2019ve found several functions but none that allow me to \u201crewind\u201d or \u201cfast forward\u201d. The hud is fairly bare housing only a bar meant for typing coordinates and 10 cells which I believe are meant to be \u201cbookmarks\u201d. The bookmarks saved do seem to work but don\u2019t take me anywhere I know. They just seem to be black voids, possibly a glitch?\n\n\n\n\nI managed to accidentally rewind; I don\u2019t know how I did it but the simulation is now traveling in reverse. I didn\u2019t even click anything on the tablet, I simply reached for my lab coat and noticed it was now moving backwards. Once this happened, a dial appeared on the wrist-pad, displaying the time, date, year, and either BC or AD depending on the era you\u2019re in. I don\u2019t know how to stop it or make it go faster so I\u2019m just typing in coordinates, usually large cities, to explore the daily lives of people from a different point of view .\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s weird, walking the streets of New York as a ghost. People march through me as if I\u2019m not there, which now that I think of it, is actually pretty normal. The only real difference is that I can follow strangers and get a small glimpse of their lives without them knowing. At first, it felt like an invasion of privacy and in a lot of ways it still does, but it\u2019s something that has bothered me less and less the more I\u2019ve explored. Nothing really crazy happened apart from that time I saw a robbery in reverse making it look like a nice man was handing a store clerk handfuls of money.\n\n\n\n\nThe guys said it\u2019s getting dark so we should probably hit the road. The way these two talk about deer makes me think they\u2019ll be actively attacking our vehicle. There's still so much I want to explore but, as they say, there\u2019s always tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 4\n\n\n\n\nI think I figured out the controls for the machine. While going through the piles of shredded paper, an activity I\u2019m starting to get used to, I found a tattered remnant that mentioned ASL. Another look at my notes told me that Connery was fluent in ASL due to the fact his child was born deaf. I think when I reached into my coat yesterday I accidentally made the sign for \u201crewind\u201d. I'll test my theory first thing in the morning. Oh, I also wrote up the file for SCP-7570. It was surprisingly easy, not sure why they gave me a week to do it.\n\n\n\n\nI'm back at the lumber mill now, ASL dictionary in hand and ready to go. So far I've figured out the controls for forward, backward, and pause. These were easy enough since they were essentially direct translations. Unfortunately, I have hit a roadblock trying to find the bookmark command. I've searched for about an hour yet haven't found a suitable translation at the moment, but it\u2019s something I can toy with later. Other than that, I discovered I can speed up the simulation\u2019s rewind by simply making the sign again. With all these commands in my toolbelt, I can finally start my vacation in time.\n\n\n\n\nTook half the day before I could rewind to the dinosaurs. It's hard to realize how much history there actually is until you're watching the years regress before your eyes. The experience of watching the world change over centuries is hard to describe. The speed I had the simulation rewinding was condensing decades into seconds rendering any details apart from city construction and destruction impossible to comprehend. After about four hours I actually made it to the Cretaceous Period at 100,000,000 BC. If I could talk to Connery I\u2019d tell him to change the BC and AD labels to one that showed the period instead. I saw the dial hit 100,000,000 BC and stopped it, hoping to see fields of dinosaurs but meeting a much more familiar sight instead. I was in New York and it looked completely normal. Needless to say, I was extremely confused and checked the dial nearly a thousand times in an attempt to find an explanation. When that didn't work I set about wandering the streets again. It looked extremely similar to the New York I remember living my early life in. The fashion and tech people used were foreign to me but other than that I found myself feeling at home, something strangely disturbing 100,000,000 years ago.\n\n\nI started moving forward again but at a much slower pace. I was watching, waiting patiently to find any explanation and it wasn't long before the calamity reared its head. I was staring at the city skyline for a second and in the next moment it was gone, a barren field having taken its place. Stopping and rewinding revealed something biblical, a cloud flew over New York millennia ago and descended upon the mega-city, eating everything within a day. Locus. Locus that ate through metal, stone, and men all the same came and erased New York from existence. That is before I traveled forward and saw it rebuilt exactly the same a few million years later. Eventually, I found out what I was witnessing. You hear a lot of rumors and ghost stories when you work at the Foundation, one of which was the story of a machine in the heart of a national park capable of resurrecting the world. Apparently, this was more than a legend and it had been used before, possibly more than once. This event would make navigation of time a little more difficult than I realized. Depending on how many apocalypses earth had seen I\u2019d have to adjust my dates by possible eons. After contemplation, I decided I\u2019d start with dates closer to the present and move back from there. This would limit my complications till I hit the first end-of-the-world scenario. Before I left I did find out how to bookmark by signing the word \u201csave\u201d. I placed a bookmark on locus day and continued my exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe CROATOAN thing was actually a lot more interesting than anticipated. I was expecting it to be the settlers pissing off the natives but it was a lot more complicated than that. The settlers were minding their own business one day when one of them decided to cut down the wrong tree. The moment the ax hit the bark the pine started to bleed and shake violently, I watched as the tree fell away into dust and revealed a large black pentagon floating in the air. It started singing in a language I didn\u2019t understand and when it flew close to the settlers they turned to poppy seeds. Eventually, the entire town was gone and the natives came. The spiritual leaders cornered the shape in a circle with various spices before conducting a ritual. The anomaly thrashed but in the end, the natives won, trapping it within another tree that they then marked with the phrase CROATOAN. Interesting to say the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 5\n\n\n\n\nFirst humans is a hard one. After returning to my bookmark on locus day, I continued back, trying to pay attention as the world shifted around me. In my effort to find the birth of humanity, I instead found two more apocalypses. One involved monsters killing millions and a massive rift opening up before the Foundation flooded it. The other was a simple asteroid that leveled the earth. There's a weird simplicity to a big rock hitting our planet that makes me wonder how many times we've died out. Each of these events are massive catastrophes, killing billions of people each time. That's an impossible number to comprehend, but the number becomes even more unfathomable when you realize how many times these events have happened.\n\n\n\n\nI fell asleep rewinding. I guess I should have listened to Joseph when he told me to head back to the cabin. I denied the offer as something in me felt as if I wouldn't be able to sleep without finding my goal. Obviously, I was wrong as I passed out watching another apocalypse. When I woke up, the earth was gone and I was floating in space, watching as stars spun around me, slowly moving toward each other. I think I went past the creation of earth. I\u2019m interested where this will lead me so I'll head back as far as I can.\n\n\n\n\nI had to sign rewind for what felt like an eternity until I finally saw the universe moving at an acceptable speed. The numbers on the wrist-pad no longer fit on the screen but I\u2019m not paying much attention to that because the most incredible display of light and energy dances around me. As I rewind more matter comes into view and I watch as everything in our reality crashes and collides into the cosmos. Brilliant shades of unimaginable colors spread across the stars. It\u2019ll happen soon. The beginning.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, I made it. I watched everything that is, compress down into nothing and then it was dark. I stopped the simulation, hoping to watch the big bang in real time but in that moment I noticed something. This darkness was familiar to me, a blank emptiness like nothing my experience on earth could compare to. The bookmarks Connery left on the cells, it was here, in the void before time. I stared around me in realization before the bang happened and I saw everything spawn from nothing, endless amounts of matter flowing past me and spiraling into the void. It was beautiful. I tried to rewind to watch it again when I made the discovery.\n\n\nThe universe compressed down. There was the void. Then I was on earth.\n\n\nI nearly jumped at the sudden familiarity. I was in a city, people and cars sped past me, moving like the endless amount of traffic I knew from New York. I stared at the people, all of them wearing and operating clothing and tech that barely resemble anything on earth. I stopped the simulation and made it run in real time, searching for an explanation. People walked around me, minding their own business, living their lives. Then, without warning, the void. I rewound again, I think a part of me was hoping I was seeing things, imagining the situation but I was met with the same sight. A city, an earth, and a universe predating our own. I checked the dial to ensure I hadn't accidentally clicked a bookmark and found numbers filling the screen. Finally, I accepted what I was seeing and started to understand what that meant. They were erased, turned to nothing before the universe. We exploded from a point and replaced them. I spent a few hours searching for a cause but there seemed to be nothing, like a random button was pressed and everything was reset.\n\n\nAfter a moment I started to think about what that meant for myself. I had made a discovery, a massive discovery that brought seemingly infinite intrigue and dread. On one hand, I've found time beyond time. I was talking in my last entry about how much history there is in \nour\n universe but now with this, that amount of knowledge and experience is practically doubled. An unfathomable amount of time, events, life, and death was hit with a multiplier by this discovery. It's enough to make us feel smaller than we already were but the dread doesn't stop there. Something killed them, without warning and without mercy. Billions lived on that planet and countless more potential people beyond the stars and they were all vanquished in the blink of an eye. That's bad enough but the Foundation has seen its share of universe destroyers. What worries me is the ease at which it not only destroyed everything but destroyed it so completely that nothing remained after. I don't mean just matter either, concepts such as time, gravity, and reality seem to cease entirely making a void so empty that it doesn't even look black. It's hard to describe but when I look out there I don't see darkness, I just don't see. There's nothing. Infinite nothing. I can't help but wonder if, with our universe's similarities, can something like that happen again?\n\n\nI need to document this thoroughly and look at it from every angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 6\n\n\n\n\nI found a Foundation that is equivalent to ours, though not as secretive. Well, they still are but it's a completely new landscape with the general public knowing about the Foundation and its anomalies. It's definitely a lot different here as a few of the doctors, some of which I actually recognize, act as celebrities and sometimes even go on talk shows. It\u2019s interesting but not why I\u2019m writing this. I followed a doctor to a Foundation site and explored. It seemed a lot of them knew that the erasure was coming and were attempting to find a way to pass over into the next universe. They made a machine I couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend and activated it. Not everyone got in before everything collapsed, only a handful of doctors. I wonder what happened to them.\n\n\n\n\nI followed a random doctor before the erasure of reality. I was curious and wanted to see what people were doing before the collapse, see if that gave me any kind of insight. This girl was ordering coffee at an on-site shop and used her last moments to sit alone near a window overlooking a courtyard. She sipped her drink and stared out at the empty garden. The bags under her eyes told me she had pulled a few all-nighters and the coffee with extra espresso likely meant she\u2019d be pulling more. I joined her at the table, studying the features of her face as she looked out the window. Her hair was a brilliant shade of red and hung down to her shoulders. It was tangled and nappy as she likely didn\u2019t have time to brush it in between appointments. Even so, I felt something for her. Perhaps I saw myself behind the tired, ember eyes. I stared into those eyes until the void swallowed them.\n\n\nI rewound again, watching her take a sip of her coffee and vanish. I had felt dread before this, but now this small-scale scenario put an ache inside me. The girl had a life, friends, and family. She likely had plans after this coffee and was thinking about them at that very moment. There were sparks of life in her eyes that reflected the sun, a will inside of her that drove her to follow her ambitions. Yet the void didn't care. As I watched her eyes be swallowed by the nothing I felt everything follow behind. History, dreams, ambitions, the future, the past, every person, every land, everything that ever was and ever had the chance to be was gone. Revealing only the fact that nothing mattered. Every war these people fought and every advance they made seemed completely pointless knowing that they were essentially placing a walkway toward the mouth of non-creation. What was the point?\n\n\n\n\nIf it can happen to them, it can happen to us. I haven\u2019t slept and I feel like everything around me could stop at any moment. I can't bare this burden on my own. I need to tell someone about what I've found. About everything I've found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3: O5 Audio Log #7570-01\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7570 Conference 01:\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nO5-10\n: Okay, is that it? I was working on something before this that I\u2019d like to get back to.\n\n\nO5-1\n: Yeah I think that\u2019s pretty much\u2026 Nope, wait we got one more scheduled today regarding SCP-7570.\n\n\nO5-7\n: Can it wait till tomorrow, I\u2019m actually kinda busy too.\n\n\nO5-1\n: Um, let me read the description the site director sent me\u2026 \n(CLICK TONGUE AND WHISTLES AS HE SCANS THE DOCUMENT)\n\u2026 Okay, it says we\u2019re meant to have a conference with Junior Researcher Reg-\n\n\nO5-8\n: Junior Researcher?\n\n\nO5-1\n: Eight, can you please hold off \u2019til I\u2019m done, please? Thank You. Where was I? Uhhh, Junior Researcher Regan Morgan regarding something she discovered concerning SCP-7570. Site director says it\u2019s a matter of utmost importance.\n\n\nO5-9\n: Guess that means we have to do it.\n\n\nO5-8\n: Can we go back a bit? Junior Researcher? Why is this coming to us? Are we taking every request that comes to our door now? What even is 7570?\n\n\nO5-3\n: Item Number: SCP-7570. Object Class: Safe-\n\n\n(O5-3 CONTINUES RECITING THE DOCUMENT AS THE OTHERS DISCUSS.)\n\n\nO5-8\n: Welp, I heard safe. Sounds like it\u2019ll be able to wait till tomorrow.\n\n\nO5-9\n: She\u2019s apparently already on the line, she\u2019s just waiting for us to accept the call.\n\n\nO5-8\n: And? She can stay there till tomorrow.\n\n\nO5-3\n: \n(FINISHES READING THE DOCUMENT)\n I think we should talk to her.\n\n\nO5-8\n: Jesus Christ.\n\n\nO5-1\n: Guys, come on, it\u2019s been a long day for all of us but can we not bicker, for once, please? Okay, Three, why do you think we should hear her out?\n\n\nO5-3\n: As the document said, SCP-7570 is a machine able to create simulations of the past. Not only is it worrying that the researcher assigned to said machine is trying to contact us, I find it strange that such a low-level operative was assigned to this task at all.\n\n\nO5-1\n: Worrying how?\n\n\nO5-3\n: As a junior researcher, most of the info we have is withheld from her. But if she\u2019s been using SCP-7570, she could\u2019ve discovered lots of sensitive material.\n\n\nO5-10\n: Jesus Christ, who the fuck assigned her to this?\n\n\nO5-11\n: We\u2019ve been understaffed for months now, something like this was bound to happen. What matters now is that we nip it in the bud, get her amnestisized and reassigned.\n\n\nO5-3\n: What about hearing her out?\n\n\nO5-11\n: No point, she\u2019s likely going to bring up one of our many end-of-the-world scenarios and we just went over those an hour ago. You guys wanna talk about them again? You wanna go over the petal people first or the time the sun broke?\n\n\nO5-1\n: And if it\u2019s something else? Look, guys. I know we\u2019re tired but let\u2019s just get this over with. If it\u2019s like you say Eleven, it\u2019ll be a ten-second conversation.\n\n\n(JUNIOR RESEARCHER REGAN MORGAN IS ADDED TO THE CONFERENCE CALL.)\n\n\nO5-1\n: Hello, Miss Morgan?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Hello? Yes? Sorry, I was waiting a while. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\n\n\nO5-1\n: It's not a problem Miss Morgan, now it says here you were referred to us by your site director regarding something you discovered within SCP-7570, is that correct?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Yes sir, that is correct, I\u2019ve found something troubling in our past that I\u2019m afraid this council is not aware of.\n\n\nO5-1\n: And what might that be, Miss Morgan?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Well\u2026 this requires some background. While writing the report for SCP-7570, I was experimenting with its functionality and accidentally went back to the beginning of time when-\n\n\nO5-10\n: Hold on, the beginning of time? I was reading the report, I didn\u2019t realize this machine would see dates past the creation of earth.\n\n\nMorgan\n: Yes, it\u2019s a common underestimation that my site director also fell for. The truth is that there seems to be no limit to the amount of time the machine can accurately simulate. And because of this, I found something.\n\n\nO5-1\n: What?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Seven minutes before the big bang took place I found another universe. One with a very similar world containing humans and even an SCP Foundation.\n\n\nO5-1\n: A universe predating our own?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Yes, but the thing that brings me here to you isn\u2019t that the universe was there, it\u2019s that it isn\u2019t there anymore. Something, I'm not sure what, a reality eater, anomaly, universal law, or whatever but something erased their universe and replaced it with our own seven minutes after.\n\n\nSILENCE HANGS IN THE ROOM FOR 30 SECONDS\n\n\nMorgan\n: Hello?\n\n\nO5-10\n: You\u2019re certain of this, I mean how much of this universe could you see?\n\n\nMorgan\n: I spent a day exploring the streets and living their lives. I am positive that this place not only existed but that it was frighteningly similar to our own. They were shaped like us, talked like us, thought like us, I saw Doctor Clef on a talk show! This place was real and something killed it without warning.\n\n\nO5-10\n: Research for this could be game-changing. If it was an advanced civilization like she says we could find solutions to problems they managed to crack but we haven\u2019t. We need researchers on this, good researchers. I will personally-\n\n\nMorgan\n: Wait. I had more to say.\n\n\nO5-7\n: Do not interrupt her.\n\n\nO5-10\n: No, Seven, it\u2019s fine. What else was there, Miss Morgan?\n\n\nMorgan\n: It wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\n\nO5-10\n: I beg your pardon?\n\n\nMorgan\n: That world, that universe. It wasn\u2019t the only one that was replaced. I kept going back and I found more and more and more.\n\n\nO5-1\n: How many?\n\n\nMorgan\n: I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t reached the end, there could be hundreds more-\n\n\nO5-7\n: Hundreds more? How many have you encountered so far?\n\n\nMorgan\n: Not counting our own, I have counted 786 unique universes destroyed and replaced.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the conference O5-1 and O5-10 were transported to SCP-7570 where Regan Morgan demonstrated the machine. O5-1 declared that discovering the nature of the universe erasure, now referred to as SCP-7570-1, was the highest priority of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4: SCP-7570-1 Investigation\n\n\nLIST OF NOTABLE ERASURE EVENTS\n\n\n\n\nFormer Universe-0027 \u201cOmelas\u201d\n: FU-0027 appears to be a universe housing mostly dead worlds apart from two. A similar earth and a distant, powerful, macro-civilization. The earth planet is fairly mundane but research into the alien world revealed an impossibly advanced civilization. Much of their technology seemed to be derived from a thaumaturgical source they harvested with a strange ritual. A select amount of the population was exiled to the planet's neighboring moons which acted as a malignant probability sink.\n\n\nERASURE EVENT\n: FU-0027 was aware of SCP-7570-1 and were actively attempting to stop it via conceptual attacks they targeted at the idea of circles. All efforts failed, however, as two years after their retaliation, their EE took place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Universe-0048 \u201cRadiant Dreams\u201d\n: FU-0048 was a space-faring empire that used highly advanced thaumaturgy to cross great distances in very short amounts of time. While completely passive, the empire was not looked upon kindly by other worlds as induction into their ranks often meant the destruction of native cultures and religions in favor of those held by the empire. This inevitably led to their destruction as a race of insect-like humanoids turned their backs on a very real deity that retaliated by infecting the dreams of all who knew its name.\n\n\nERASURE EVENT\n: FU-0048 was completely under the control of the dream god at this point and formed a hive mind spanning countless worlds. They made no attempt to fight back when their EE came.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Universe-0292 \u201cDeath\u2019s Death\u201d\n: FU-0292 was a civilization extremely similar to our own, even housing a Foundation equivalent. Nearing the century before their EE, a Foundation Operative managed to kill the avatar of death, rendering every living thing in reality unable to die. Society collapsed due to overpopulation and anomalies eventually broke from their cells, one of which, SCP-610, managed to infect every cell of biological matter on the planet. Earth became a giant macro-organism capable of navigating space and invading other planets. Eventually, everything in the universe was absorbed and created cobwebs of flesh spanning across planets and stars throughout the universe.\n\n\nERASURE EVENT\n: FU-0292 was in a dormant state until twenty-four hours before their EE. At that moment the flesh-spanning worlds stirred and sank into itself forming a giant deity that used its reality-warping capabilities to reach out of the universe. The entity appeared to be pleading for its life before the EE occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Universe-SNOW \u201cSNOW\u201d\n: Before there was snow the world suffered through infinite impurities, anomalies, and filth. After the introduction of snow there was only snow and only ever was snow. Infinite suffering turned to snow, cultures turned to snow, words-s cre-sn-ate-ow-ed to spr-snow. Snow. snowsnowsnowsnow.\n\n\nFU-SNOW is a self-sustaining conceptual purifier attached to the idea of snow. This anomaly has the ability to alter any information that discusses it leaving this report open to unavoidable alterations. Navigation of FU-SNOW proved to be unique as times and events seemed to change the moment an infected date was observed, that date being when SCP-3799 was created. Very quickly the simulation of the universe became only snow.\n\n\nERASURE EVENT\n: We were left in our purity for seven minutes before we realized our foolishness. We haven't succeeded, despite sprinkling our purity across every world and every idea there was One who exceeded our reach. We couldn\u2019t see It, only feel the conceptual magnitude of Its existence. We heard a yawn and stopped being snow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Universe-2786 \u201cUtopia\u201d\n: Unlike other worlds, FU-2786 experienced an EE extremely early in its lifetime and has so far been the only monitored universe that didn't experience an industrial revolution. In this universe humanity never split away from each other creating a single nation that expanded across Africa, no other continents seemed to contain any human life.\n\n\nERASURE EVENT\n: FU-2786 seemed completely unaware before the EE took place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5: SCP-7570-1 Discovery and Classification\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0FILE:\u00a0Entry\u00a07\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY 7\n\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t updated this in a while and in all honesty, there\u2019s not been much to report. Just more of the same. I\u2019m honestly surprised I\u2019m still on the project at all. They tried phasing me out at first but I work the machine better than anyone else. The last researcher they tried to give the wrist-pad to accidentally erased the bookmarks. We wasted a good two weeks of work having to rewind back to where we were before. They haven\u2019t let anyone else touch the wrist-pad after that. I prefer it that way, I feel like I think better when I work alone.\n\n\nI\u2019m not really here to write about work. It\u2019s just more dead universes, I stopped describing them at the 1,000 mark, and stopped counting at somewhere around 80,000. I don't mean to downplay the scale of this, in all honesty, this event is impossible to fully comprehend. To describe the sheer magnitude of destruction, imagine this. If you took every atom that makes up earth and turned them into their own universe you wouldn't equate to 1% of the universes we've recorded. The speed that the simulation is rewinding condenses around one hundred Erasure Events in a single second and we've had it on for months. The amount of destruction is incalculable. Yet I feel nothing at this point. All I do is sit in the simulation and watch the universes fly by around me. None of them too different, none of them too similar. I thought I\u2019d find a pattern or something that showed what happened right before it all went dark. Something each of them did that activated the erasure but there\u2019s nothing. In a lot of worlds, everyone is dead so they can\u2019t even activate anything.\n\n\nBut like I said, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\n\n\nI had a dream about Amelia last night. I haven\u2019t thought of her in a while and decided to take a second to remember her face. After bookmarking where I was I went back to my universe and watched our last meeting. I forgot how small she was, I remembered us being the same height but despite being twins we looked pretty much nothing alike. She was in a Foundation cell and I was visiting. I remember this conversation exactly as I dream about it almost every month. We talk about my work and what I do because we can\u2019t do the opposite. She\u2019s an anomaly, her days consist of sitting in her cell, watching TV, and occasionally reading a book. She didn\u2019t mind much though because I always had great stories about what crazy thing I was working on. There was so much wonder in her eye, so much joy in her laughter, so much life in her. After we talked I told her we\u2019d both be moved as this Site was being abandoned due to residual Hume corruption from a dimensional anomaly. The last thing I said to her was, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\n\nSomeone lost a folder, forgot to send a memo, or just couldn\u2019t be bothered to care and because of that one anomaly was left at Site-7. One. It could have been an inanimate object or a vicious monster or even another poor soul but no. It was Amelia. It was almost a month later, after the stress of my move, that I realized I'd never heard where she was taken. They found her right where they locked her up, laying in her bed.\n\n\nAnd from my spot in the eternity observatory, I sat there, watching the whole thing. I watched her try to lick the condensation off the walls and eat the roaches on the floor, praying every night that someone would find her. I saw her share her dreams every night even though she knew there was no one nearby for miles.\n\n\nIt\u2019s weird that one death affects me more than the infinite sea of corpses I\u2019ve witnessed solely because I knew her my whole life. Whatever I find there, at the end of time, I\u2019ll ask how it felt. Creating the matter that makes every person, watching every life play out only to erase them all the same.\n\n\n\n\nI pressed my bookmark and was once again met with the black void, I signed rewind and heard something completely foreign to me. It reminded me of a buzzer when a contestant got a question wrong on a game show. It was loud, annoying, and emanating from my wrist-pad. I looked down at the screen and saw the text displayed.\n\n\nMAXIMUM LENGTH REACHED\n\n\nI looked up again, now realizing where I was. The beginning of it all, the first void, the start of the countless deaths that would follow for countless eternities. I stared into the void, watching in real-time as within the blackness there was a spark of light.\n\n\nSuddenly I felt different, something had changed. There was a void with a single spark in the distance but now it felt foreign. It took me a few seconds to realize I could no longer smell roasted chestnut.\n\n\n\u201cStep forward.\u201d\n\n\nI looked up, my attention drawn to the disembodied voice that boomed and whispered into my ear with a billion voices. I watched silently, waiting for something to happen.\n\n\n\u201cStep forward. Regan Morgan.\u201d\n\n\nMy blood ran cold, I felt a gasp escape my mouth as I stumbled backward, staring at the spark in complete shock. It could see me! I was in a time trillions upon trillions of generations before my universe was even conceived. Why did this thing say my name at the beginning of time?\n\n\nI choked out an answer, \u201cYou can see me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can. Step forward.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStep,\u201d I felt myself stiffen as if every atom in my body froze and awaited their commands, \u201cForward.\u201d\n\n\nI did as It said, walking to meet It in the darkness, a golden spark that flickered with being and existence. Within the light I saw the billions of universes before mine, all dead and all remembered. This wasn\u2019t the simulation, I was somewhere else, It had taken me here. Where was here, It\u2019s home, another dimension, did It erase my world? Was I in the void awaiting to be replaced?\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d The spark asked impatiently.\n\n\nI stood there, unsure how to respond, eventually, I found my voice, \u201cWell, what?\u201d\n\n\nIt laughed at me, \u201cRegan, how many times has someone knocked on your door, and when you opened it, they asked you what you wanted?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cYou came looking for me.\u201d It replied, \u201cYou watched the entire history of our reality to the beginning, just to meet me. You\u2019ve come all this way, you must have a question in mind. I hope I'm not sounding hostile to you, that's the last thing I want, Regan Morgan. Because despite your clear inferiority I've grown quite attached to you. No one has done what you accomplished, for you, I'll answer anything. Ask to your heart's content.\u201d\n\n\nI watched it for a moment, thinking carefully of what to say, eventually settling with, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m SCP-7570-1. Is that not the name you assigned me?\u201d It asked in a mocking tone, \u201cOr would you prefer \u2018reality eater, anomaly, universal law\u2019? You\u2019ve given me many names and I\u2019ve received many more from many others. But my favorite has been I AM. It\u2019s poetic as I am the first thing to ever be. Therefore I AM.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cI AM\u2026 why-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first.\u201d I AM said, interrupting me, \u201cTo find Me, I mean. There was another before you. An older man, I was as surprised then as I am now. I mention Francis Connery because he asked the same question you are about to ask. Why did I create, erase, and replace billions of worlds billions of times.\u201d I stood silent, getting the feeling It would talk without my input, \u201cYou know what happened to him, are you sure you want to know?\u201d\n\n\nI took a deep breath, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d I AM said, a smile audible in Its voice, \u201cI never get the chance to talk, to you, it\u2019s normal, to Me it\u2019s a delicacy. Your question requires a story. At the beginning of what is, I realized I was. This separated Me from what you see around you, the void of voids. I spent My time crafting My will into existence. Void is a substance without form, a willess anti-creation, all realities and stories are created with the emptiness. With void, I created My first world. It was beautiful, I made creatures, thinking things that could operate and struggle all their own. I sat above them at the pinnacle of our reality and watched as they lived, crafted, explored, birthed, died, repopulated, expanded, conquered, consumed, and experienced all on their own. I felt such love for them. Even for something like Me the feeling, the rush, it's impossible to put into words. I only knew the void but suddenly I could watch their war, their love, the beauty of life and death and rebirth.\u201d\n\n\nIts voice shook as It explained, if I didn't know what this entity was I would have believed It actually loved Its creation. There was a wonder in Its voice I have never heard in another living being before or since, it was manic. If this thing had a face It would likely weep tears of joy explaining this to me. Even so, I knew it couldn't be real.\n\n\n\u201cThen why erase them?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cErase?\u201d It laughed at me, \u201cNo, do you have any idea how hard it is to create consciousness, it took Me billions of eons to craft the unique minds of those people. I couldn\u2019t just throw them away when they expired. No, repurposed is the right word, you plunge a consciousness in a void for a few eons and they forget everything they were. Leaving only empty minds to place within the next group, good as new.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cConvenience?\u201d I asked I AM, a hint of hatred in my voice I felt It notice, \u201cYou destroyed and replaced those worlds out of convenience?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d It answered, \u201cI did it out of boredom.\u201d\n\n\nThe answer hung in the air for a moment, the weight of what I AM was saying finally starting to reach me.\n\n\n\u201cYou get it,\u201d the entity said, \u201cYou\u2019re understanding what I'm telling you. You see all of these worlds start out so engaging, so entertaining, but eventually, every tale hits its climax. Be honest with yourself, Regan, how many books have you read past their resolution? How many movies out there show what happens after they all lived happily ever after? How many people complain in your universe alone about how \nThe Walking Dead\n or \nThe Simpsons\n have gone on for way too long? You might not want to admit it but you know, Regan, on some level, somewhere in your mind you understand. That's half the reason that I love you so much because you can understand this, it killed Connery but you, Regan Morgan, get it. Eventually, someone needs to pull the plug and make something new.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d I felt my heart climbing my throat and my face burning red, \u201cYou killed-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRepurposed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStripped away, the thoughts and being of all these souls, these universes because You got bored!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d I AM answered, glee in Its voice \u201cIt\u2019s different every time. Sometimes everyone dies, sometimes the world achieves eternal peace, sometimes every anomaly is contained. A billion endings for a billion stories and a billion more lying ahead! I\u2019ve seen so much Regan, so many things have kept my attention glued below but to be honest, recently I\u2019ve lost interest. Nothing surprised me, when you live as long as Me you realize how quickly you see everything. I've seen every story's every iteration, and I've seen every person's different choices play out to completion. I've seen it all and burned it all. Sure exploration and wars were still fun but what was the point when I knew what they\u2019d find or who would win? I was just about to pull the plug and start again but then you and Connery found Me. No one has ever found me before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t your game,\u201d I said behind a glare.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I AM said, not as a form of belittlement, but as a form of correction, \u201cYou are, I created every atom that makes up every cell in your body, I put every thought in your head, I tattooed your morals and ideals inside your mind, I\u2019ve seen every person you\u2019ve ever been. Which makes it so incredible that this doubt exists in my head. Why can something like you, existing beneath Me, find Me, contact Me, understand Me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not beneath you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, you are! I own you as much as you own the books in your library,\u201d I AM did a twirl in the air, \u201cBut still you\u2019ve changed something within Me, affected Me, I\u2019ve never been more excited to see what comes next!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI kill you.\u201d I said, deadpan, \u201cThe next thing that will happen will be me killing you.\u201d\n\n\nSilence floated in the air once again before I AM laughed, \u201cKill Me? Regan, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, you\u2019re starting to bore me. We both know you have no way of doing that, everything that exists in this reality, all the tools at your disposal are made by Me. Why would I create an item that could harm Me? The only thing you have benefitting you, Regan, is my attention, other than that you\u2019re nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I said pointing at the spark, rage boiled inside of me, I felt the collective pain and suffering every soul experienced due to this thing\u2019s attention span, \u201cI found You, out here in the void. I don\u2019t care that You see me as lesser, as beneath You, as nothing. I didn\u2019t live my life for Your benefit, my struggles weren\u2019t meant for Your entertainment! I didn\u2019t find my sister\u2019s dead body and mourn to keep Your attention! I am! I am a person. A thinking, feeling, thing and I\u2019ll be the reason You die.\u201d\n\n\nI AM stared at me, It could have killed me a billion times over, taken me apart atom by atom, and splay what was once me across the stars. It could have but I knew it wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cYou amaze me like no other.\u201d I AM said with a smile, \u201cThis has me so immersed. I will spend every second of My time with My eyes on you. Regan Morgan, I can\u2019t wait to see what you do next.\u201d\n\n\nI woke up in the machine and wrote this down. I should call One, he\u2019s going to want to hear this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0FILE:\u00a0SCP-7570-1\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE\u00a0FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n7570-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nketer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\napollyon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\namida\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ncritical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto taken of SCP-7570-1 from within SCP-7570\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures\n: To effectively limit SCP-7570-1\u2019s influence on reality certain measures must be taken to ensure the entity's attention is held. The Foundation will expend all resources necessary to stoke global conflicts, fund space exploration, limit anomaly capture, and keep Foundation opposition operational. Screenings show that without Foundation interference world peace could have been achieved on three separate occasions and anomalous activity could, and still can be, resolved entirely. Above all else, however, Senior Researcher Regan Morgan must be kept safe and continue her research on SCP-7570-1.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-7570-1 is an all-powerful, immortal, deity that resides within our reality, observing from afar. Despite being far beyond us in power, SCP-7570-1 seems to have a similar attention span and mannerisms with that of a normal human being, albeit one that suffers from severe narcissism and lack of empathy. Because of this, SCP-7570-1 has the potential to erase the current universe if It loses interest. SCP-7570-1 has demonstrated this ability numerous times and it is believed that the only reason the current universe is still here is because of SCP-7570-1\u2019s fixation on Senior Researcher Regan Morgan.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\n: I think I found something: [REDACTED].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-7570 is currently contained within an abandoned lumber mill, 40\u00a0km east of Milam, Texas. No less than four armed guards should be stationed within the nearby Foundation Site-7 at a time to monitor the area and ensure Senior Researcher Regan Morgan is not interrupted during her research on SCP-7570. Anyone caught trespassing on the site should be captured and questioned on their knowledge of the anomaly. A majority of trespassers are lost locals who should be amnesticized and placed back into society according to standard procedure. Members of any GOI should be brought directly to the O5-Council for questioning.",
    "description": "SCP-7570 is a machine housed within an abandoned lumber mill near Milam, Texas. SCP-7570 is a temporal displacement device capable of transmitting a constant projection from any point in the past back to the present. The device can simulate the past with no apparent limit; as the furthest point reached by Senior Researcher Regan Morgan was well beyond the creation of our universe.",
