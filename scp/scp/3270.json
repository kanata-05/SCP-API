The psychological effects of SCP-3270 listed above have dissipated at this point. Instances of SCP-3270-1 will have the lifespan of an average human, though are able to be terminated by normal means.\n\n\n\n\nInterview-3270-1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Doctor Allison, An Instance Of SCP-3270-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Glenrowan\n\n\nForeward:\n Doctor Allison willingly viewed SCP-3270.
