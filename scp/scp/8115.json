Monthly check-ups are to be made on SCP-8115 to establish that its quality has not deteriorated. In case of deterioration, a report is to be filed to the physically nearest researcher in charge of SCP-8115.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-8115 is a medium-sized hardcover book.\n1\n The cover is ruined to the point where no information can be retrieved from it. If opened, the first person to witness the pages of the book will experience their consciousness relocating to SCP-8115-01.\n\n\nSCP-8115-01 is the realm connected to SCP-8115 and is an anchor point for the memories that the affected individual will see. The realm replicates the initial location the affected individual existed within and eventually de-materializes after SCP-8115-02 has introduced itself. After this, SCP-8115-01 will become a vast and empty desert-like landscape. After a few seconds within SCP-8115-01, a large orb manifests, varying in size. Upon entering the orb, the affected individual will be in a specific memory to which they have a strong emotional connection.\n\n\nSCP-8115-02 is an entity within SCP-8115-01 that manifests as an object the affected person has a close connection with. The entity will introduce itself and act as a guide for affected persons through SCP-8115-01. The entity will attempt to engage in conversation with affected persons for the duration of time in which they are in contact. The effect will cease when the book is closed or the session with SCP-8115-02 is concluded. SCP-8115 can only be used once every approximately 24 hours. Anyone looking at the pages under this duration will be able to read the session as a story. After this, the contents get removed through unknown means.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-8115A\n\n\n \n\n\nOverview\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJake Granger is a leading senior researcher in the study of multiple Thaumiel anomalies and has contributed to breakthroughs for their application. His mental health has been deteriorating for a long time, and due to this, his productivity has stagnated to a concerning degree. Now, the FSD considers it imperative to handle the situation so that he is persuaded to work more efficiently. Thus, he will partake in three separate experiments with SCP-8115.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \ntni.TENPiCS|regnargekaj#tni.TENPiCS|regnargekaj\n\n\nFrom:\n \ntni.TENPiCS|rotubirtsidtnemngissa#tni.TENPiCS|rotubirtsidtnemngissa\n\n\nSubject:\n Experiment: SCP-8115\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have been reassigned to SCP-8115 as a test subject. There will be three separate experiments in the next three days. Report down to Sector E, Room E-6, tomorrow at 0900. Access to the following document about SCP-8115 has been granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 8115.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did they have to do this so early?\n I asked myself as I walked down the empty, sterile, and lifeless concrete walls. The lamps on the roof blinded me as I continued past, reminding me of how hostile and devoid of life this place felt. For years I had worked here, and only in the beginning did I not have this feeling. My stomach kept on churning, and a slight pain crept over me. It felt strange that I was re-assigned on such a random notice. I didn't want to protest, though, and besides, it'd probably be stupid to do that. I saw \"E-6\" inscribed on a door and knocked three times on it. It quickly opened up, and an older man stood in front of me.\n\n\n\"So, you're the test subject, right?\"\n he asked as he crossed his arms.\n\n\n\"Yeah, that's me.\"\n\n\n\"Come on in.\"\n\n\nI wandered past the threshold of the door, looking over to a chair that sat in the middle of the room. The man sat in his own chair, and I followed suit. He leaned over towards a camera that stood in the corner, and clicked on it before he spoke.\n\n\n\"This is experiment nine of SCP-8115. We are testing to see if anything occurs to the human body during the state of relocation.\"\n\n\nHe paused, and after a short moment, he grabbed onto an old, ruined book and held it before me.\n\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\nI quickly breathed in, and stared at the book.\n\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\nThe man opened the book, and as I looked into it, my body immediately felt as if it had been lifted up into a world of eternal bliss and an unrelenting calm. It was only for a short moment, though, and as this feeling slowly vanished, I looked around to see that the man was sitting in the same place, and so did I, as if nothing happened.\n\n\n\"No unusual events are occurring; the subject's consciousness has presumably been relocated.\"\n\n\nI stood up and waved my hand in front of his face. He only sighed though as he looked down at his lap. I stopped leaning over him, looking around the room instead. It was certainly the same room as before, but it felt different. My body had naturally stopped feeling tense. I breathed out and looked around more.\n\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\nThere was a voice that echoed throughout the room. It was soft and smooth while constantly whispering. I scanned the room, trying to locate where the voice came from whilst responding to its question.\n\n\n\"I'm uh\u2026 Jake Granger.\"\n\n\n\"Greetings, Jake Granger. For what reason are you here?\"\n\n\n\"Uh\u2026 I don't know.\"\n\n\n\"Let me ask you some questions.\"\n\n\n\"Sure, I guess?\"\n\n\n\"How are you feeling right now?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know. I'm not too sure at all.\"\n\n\n\"Did you arrive here voluntarily?\"\n\n\n\"No, not really.\"\n\n\n\"What is your favorite color?\"\n\n\n\"What??\"\n\n\nThere was nothing here except me, this room, and a disembodied voice that wasn't showing itself. A voice that just now asked me what my favorite color is. I shrugged and responded.\n\n\n\"I guess, like, Lime?\"\n\n\n\"Strange, very strange.\"\n\n\n\"Wh- Where are you?\"\n\n\n\"Hm, it will have to do.\"\n\n\nA strong gust blew throughout the room, and eventually something small flew down from the roof. There was a shimmer surrounding it until it had reached the bottom of the floor, where it showed itself to be a teddy bear. It stood on the ground for a moment, looking up at me before it spoke.\n\n\n\"Pleased to meet you; I will be your caretaker throughout this journey.\"\n\n\nAs the caretaker spoke, everything around us had chipped away. It was as if it had never existed in the first place, and around us was an empty world. A light breeze could be felt and heard as it whirred around us. The ground was hilly and looked like sand, and above me was a darkness filled with blue and green streaks, lighting up the ground and the sky around us. It was like an aurora. Eventually, as I stopped looking up, I saw a large orb, over 9 feet tall. It shone a yellow light upon everything. I was mesmerized by it, but I didn't want to go closer, or maybe I did.\n\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\nI asked the caretaker as we stood there, looking over at it.\n\n\n\"It is where your memories reside. Follow me.\"\n\n\nThe guide started flying towards it, and I followed after, slowly and cautiously. Eventually, though, my hand had slowly grasped into the orb, and the rest of me followed after. It was a strange and unnatural feeling, as it enveloped me for only a second until we had reached some other place. The sun was shining around us; children were running around, screaming and laughing. There was a large house next to the children as they ran around the yard. My eyes quickly lit up. I breathed in the air, and I felt how the wind blew on my clothes and how the cut-grass smelled. How delicious all of the food smelled\u2026 I stretched as I stood there and then walked towards a table. I rubbed it and felt the distinct feeling of wood. I let out a surprised \nhuh\n.\n\n\n\"Does it not feel strange?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah\u2026 It kind of does.\"\n\n\nI kept on touching it. For some reason I had become so curious about something as simple as a table.\n\n\n\"I assume this to be a celebration of sorts.\"\n\n\n\"Wh-? Oh, yeah, it's a birthday party. It's a celebration of your birth and aging, if you know what that is. I think it's for me.\"\n\n\n\"Do you recall anything about it?\"\n\n\n\"I'm not sure\u2026\"\n\n\n\"I understand; memories are easy to forget, more so with time. Nonetheless, we are here for a reason.\"\n\n\nWe stood there and looked around. To see younger me laughing as he ran around while he played tag was sweet. Not only that, but he held onto a small, fluffy, and brown teddy bear with googly eyes and a smile made of some yarn. A small smile grew on my face, and my eyes lit up more.\n\n\n\"Time for the cake!\"\n a female voice shouted.\n\n\nShe had clear dimples and light brown hair flowing in the wind as she brought a cake to the outside table. It was pretty big and had different animals standing on top of it. For the moment, I had forgotten about all my worries. I felt like a boy who just wanted to have fun, and get a piece of cake for my birthday from my mom.\n\n\n\"I take it that it is your mother.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\n\"Have you conversed with her recently?\"\n\n\nMy stomach got an uncomfortable feeling as the caretaker asked, and my expression had turned to my regular one.\n\n\n\"No. I haven't.\"\n\n\n\"For what reason is that?\"\n\n\n\"I uh\u2026 I don't want to talk about it. Besides, why do you want to know?\"\n\n\n\"It is in my duty to understand and help. I get nothing from it. But if you wish not to speak of it, then you are not forced to.\"\n\n\n\"I\u2026 I'm not sure I want to explain it. So please, not right now.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker didn't pry further, which I appreciated. A part of me didn't trust it. A stranger, a thing I hardly knew of; or maybe I just didn't want to explain it.\n\n\n\"Shall we leave this memory?\"\n\n\n\"Give me one more moment, please; I want to be able to remember this again.\"\n\n\nI felt the tightness build up more in my chest. I didn't truly want to leave this place.\n\n\n\"Of course. Inform me when you are ready to leave.\"\n\n\nI looked at my parents as they gave me the widest smile they could ever give. It was so long ago that I had talked to any of them, especially my father. We should probably talk more, but it's been difficult. My job has made me forget to do these things, or maybe it was just me.\n\n\n\"Now, make a wish!\"\n My mother exclaimed.\n\n\nThe younger me closed my eyes and blew out the candles, and after a short moment, my parents gave me a piece of cake. A warmth could be felt within me, and my eyes lit up again as I looked at my parents. We stood there for a good moment until I went out of the memory with the caretaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 8115.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the second day of experiments, and I felt slightly better. Yet again, it was the same room, the same person, but not the same time. It was later in the morning, and people were walking to the cafeteria as I was walking the opposite way. I reached E-6, and shortly thereafter, the experiment commenced. The feelings from yesterday took me over again. I sat still for a half a minute, until a strong light went down through the roof, and the caretaker introduced itself again.\n\n\n\"Welcome back.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker calmly said. It swung around in the room.\n\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\n\"I assume you have returned so we can continue?\"\n\n\n\"I have. It wouldn't hurt to try again, I guess.\"\n\n\nAnd yet again, everything around us turned into the same place as last time. The lights were as pretty as they were yesterday, and I couldn't help but gasp. After a moment, there was another light that lit up to the side of us. This time, it was an orb that shimmered blue and was much larger compared to the orb from yesterday. I stood in front of it, breathed in for a long time, before reaching into it with my hand, and after that, I was inside of it. As I looked around, I could see rows of chairs and desks. The lamps from the roof let out a warm and comfortable light that complimented the walls. It felt nice and more relaxed than what I had grown so used to within Foundation walls. A strong wind blew on the outside, and there were students sitting by the desks, whispering to each other while some looked over at a man standing by a podium as he spoke.\n\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\n\"This was the old college I went to.\"\n\n\n\"To do what?\"\n\n\n\"To study- Why do you want to know? Why would something like this be relevant to what we are doing?\"\n\n\n\"Yet again, it is in my duty to understand and console. I am only your guide, and these are your own memories. I am merely pushing you to speak about them, to remember; should you choose to do so.\"\n\n\nI let out a loud sigh and started speaking.\n\n\n\"I went here to study for my future. In the beginning, I struggled \na lot.\n But after a while though, it got better- like a lot better. I felt more motivated and excited to study. I was making new friends, got invited to things, and I felt happy. I had mostly forgotten how it was, but sometimes it comes back to me.\n\n\n\"Memories can easily be forgotten. Though you might think they are gone from your mind, they are hidden, deep inside of you. On a lonely day, or two, you might experience them again, and it was as if you had never forgotten at all.\"\n\n\n\"That thing on the wall over there-\"\n\n\nI pointed at the screen projection, showing an organelle, and the caretaker turned around, looking over at it, though it was not focused on the projection.\n\n\n\"That is what I studied. Biology. It's the study of living organisms. It is only a part of the subject, but it still is biology.\"\n\n\n\"Do you remember it well?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I remember it well enough.\"\n\n\n\"Was there a reason you studied this?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I had a reason for it. It was something that my parents always taught me, and it was something that became very interesting to me. It even helped me get a job where I am right now. I did a lot of good as well, until my uh\u2026 until my mother passed, and then my motivation kind of just vanished. I still kept on working though, just with less energy, or something.\"\n\n\nWhat made you stay?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know. A lot of work still needed to be done, and maybe I felt like I was too far in. And besides, what if something happened and I couldn't find any new jobs? Technically, I didn't even have any experience. You can't tell an interviewer that you worked for a secret organization since you'd have no real proof. You would also, you know, be considered insane.\"\n\n\nA weak chuckle came out of me, thinking that my remark was funny. The caretaker was silent before it spoke again.\n\n\n\"May I once again inquire about what happened to your mother?\n\n\nA frown fell over me. I still didn't really want to answer its question; it felt too personal for me. My voice got quieter as I responded.\n\n\n\"I- I don't know\u2026 I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you about it-\"\n\n\n\"I am aware that I am not a human. I share no emotion, no care, and no judgement for human life or actions. It is for nothing more than my duty, and that is to console and understand. Thus, it is why I am once again inquiring about what happened to your mother.\"\n\n\nI sighed heavily, rubbing my face as I started to tell the caretaker.\n\n\n\"Fine, if you say so. My mother died due to a degenerative nerve disease. It gradually shuts down your nerves over time, and it was terminal for her. I tried to save her, but I was never able to, or maybe I was. I wish I was able to, one way or another.\"\n\n\n\"My condolences about this. But why feel guilt for something that is out of your control?\"\n\n\n\"I's just\u2026 I loved her. I wish I could have saved her.\"\n\n\nA rupture appeared in the memory, showing me myself as I sat by a desk looking at reports. Another memory showed me sitting by another table, studying anomalies in some hope that it could somehow save her. My endeavors still helped the Foundation- but all they cared about was the research. All I cared about was that I did it for my mom, even if it was all for nothing.\n\n\n\"If I only had some more goddamn time\u2026\"\n\n\n\"The time you had was finite; you did all you could. No matter how much time you devoted to your efforts, it still might've not been possible.\"\n\n\n\"Maybe. It just- It hurts, and I still wish I could've saved her\u2026\"\n\n\n\"Also, best not to think of other memories in the process of witnessing one, it can ruin this world that I exist within.\"\n\n\n\"I'll try to do that.\"\n\n\nWe had reached down to the man, as he still spoke about organelles. He seemed so passionate about the subject. It was inspiring, in a way, and I felt excited to hear about it. After a moment, there was a phone that rang, and a student stood up and asked if he could take a call. The professor responded with a yes, and I realized that it was me. I ran after myself and followed as the younger me went out of the classroom.\n\n\n\"Hey Dad, what's up?\"\n Muffled speaking could be heard on the phone, but I knew what it was about. \n\"Wh\u2026 When did she get put into the hospital?\"\n the younger me asked, my hand noticeably shaking. \n\"Yeah, of course. I'll have to ask the teacher,\"\n I said, ending the call.\n\n\nPast me opened the door and asked if he could leave class early. A faint \"yes\" could be heard, and so the younger me packed up and ran out of the school.\n\n\n\"This is unfortunate.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker said in a sad tone. My body ached to the point where it became unbearable, and I felt lightheaded. It felt wrong that I had to see this. I didn't want to remember this again. More ruptures appeared in the memory, and it showed my mother and how I saw her become more frail and weak as it got worse and \nworse and\n \nWORSE\n.\n\n\nEventually, it was decided that she would get put down. She could barely do anything at the end of it all, but I couldn't believe it; I didn't want to. Maybe if I had more time I could have saved her, and maybe if I tried harder it would actually be possible. But, in the end, there was nothing I could do. It was devastating for me. I felt myself tremble, and soon I crumbled down to the ground.\n\n\n\"Thi- This is\u2026\"\n\n\n\"Do you need a moment?\"\n\n\nI could hear it ask, but it felt like my mouth couldn't open up. It was as if it had frozen up. All I could do was mutter out some letters and feel myself crash down. My breathing turned more frantic, and I sat there, curled up into a ball.\n\n\n\"Take a few minutes; try to breathe in and out slowly.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker stopped flying and sat down next to me. Its voice echoed weakly throughout the corridors, and made it all feel more empty and void. The wind roared as it struck the building, and it could easily be felt and heard. My body ached on as the dizziness became more unbearable. I tried to stand up, but quickly stopped and sat down on the ground again. Everything was overwhelming me. Yesterday my parents were congratulating me on my birthday and slicing up cake, and now I had to remember when I heard about my mother's illness. It all felt so wrong\u2026\n\n\n\"Please, can we leave this memory??? I don't want to be here anymore\u2026\"\n\n\n\"Yes, we can.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker told me as it flew up into the air again. I gained some strength and stood up, slowly walking after it, my legs wobbling as we went out. Eventually, we reached the outside of the orb, and I felt myself reach down for the ground again, looking over at the orb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 8115.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last time,\n I thought to myself as I walked towards sector E, room E-6, again. I felt sour, and it felt like my body ached again. It was as if I had returned to dhow I originally felt before all of this. I went into room E-6 and saw that it was the same researcher. Eventually, he opened the book in front of me, and yet again, an indescribable calm fell over me as I went back to the realm of SCP-8115. As with the other times the caretaker went down through the roof and introduced itself.\n\n\n\"Hello again, Jake.\"\n\n\nThe guide said to me in a tone that was as emotionless as any other time. I stood there and looked over at them.\n\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\nI slightly sneered at the caretaker.\n\n\n\"If you are angry due to yesterday, then forgive me. But I cannot dictate what memory is to be shown. I am only here to accompany and help you as you explore your memories.\"\n\n\nThe caretaker had stopped swinging around, staying completely still.\n\n\n\"A\u2026 Alright, I just- never expected to see that again. Can we go on to the next memory or something???\"\n\n\n\"Yes, we can.\"\n\n\nAnd so, the world unraveled in front of us again. Though I had been here two times before, the beauty of this world was still awe-inspiring, and as I looked around, a new orb could be seen. It was the largest out of the three. Though its shimmer was much more mixed and dull compared to the others. It felt depressing. As we went inside, I saw that we were in the very place I had felt was lifeless for so long. A strong feeling of bitterness struck me.\n\n\n\"For what reason are we in this place?? Out of any, and I mean any place, why here???\"\n I flared up at the caretaker.\n\n\n\"I have no knowledge of why we are here. Follow me.\"\n\n\nAnd I did follow; for some god awful reason I followed. My legs kept on walking after, and I knew that it was me walking, but I didn't truly want to. But we wandered through the sterile and void corridors, our steps echoing out throughout the site. It felt awful. I asked the guide something, just to try and keep my focus on something else.\n\n\n\"What's it like to be inside of here?\"\n\n\n\"I\u2026 it is an empty existence. I have seen many things since my beginning. I have seen many tragedies and have seen things that make me wonder. But my duty remains as is.\"\n\n\n\"So, you've helped everyone that has come here to deal with their memories and their past?\"\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\n\"Not everyone. I don't remember coming here; it is an immortal memory I haven't been able to access. But, eventually, as the souls passed through here, I felt a desire. A desire to help those who came across me and to guide them, changing from my original existence to what is now my purpose. For a long time I laid dormant, waiting for a soul to find me. This gave me time to think, to define my duty.\"\n\n\n\"Jesus, that must've been awful.\"\n\n\n\"It took me a long time to get used to the death of a year, but eventually I grew accustomed to it. When no one came, I only had my own memories to wander through, and there is a lot for me to remember. But, when travelers arrive, these memories vanish, and I try to help the ones that have arrived.\"\n\n\n\"I understand. And have you succeeded?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know if I have. No one that I have tried to help has returned.\"\n\n\nEventually, we had reached an office, or more specifically, my own office. The caretaker flew through the wall, and I followed along reluctantly, my body slowly going through the thick concrete. The office was dark, and it had nothing in it except a small fake plant on my desk, as well as a lamp that stood next to it. The only thing that lit up this room was a computer screen. And sitting in a chair was me, with my face lying on the desk. He groaned as he laid there, his arms lying on the keyboard. A noise could be heard from the computer, and he only turned his head and slightly straightened up to look at what it was. It said.\n\n\n\n\nHello Jake. Unfortunately, we cannot let you take a week off from your job. You are a valuable asset, and your current project can not wait for this long, even if your reason is very understandable. We apologize for this and hope no hard feelings will come across.\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPast me could be seen as he started sobbing, slamming the table with his fist. The room didn't echo, and yet it felt deafening.\n\n\"They didn't let me take a week off for a fucking funeral. Apparently, the project I was working on was more important than my own goddamn mother!\"\n\n\nTears fell down my cheek, my hands clenched tightly together. It took at least a month for the funeral to be set up, the response from human resources came fairly early. And yet, I still didn't get to see her last moments above ground. My father had to be there at the funeral without me. I hated the thought of that, and yet I was so complacent with the decision. Why? Why was I so goddamn complacent?? Tears were streaming down more and more as I stood there, and I put my hands to my face, as the tears kept on falling.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about this.\"\n\n\nI tried to speak clearly, but the sobbing made it difficult.\n\n\n\"Almost everything this book has shown me has been just- shitty memories! The only one that made me feel better was the first one. Why the fuck would it do that!?\"\n\n\n\"The book always has reasons to show these memories. Somewhere in your mind, you must know what this place has done to you. You worked here to try and save your mother, but you never succeeded. The only ones that benefited were the Foundation. This place did not let you see her when she got buried\u2026 Why are you still here, working for this place?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know why! I probably should've left when they told me that I couldn't go to the funeral, but for some sick and goddamn twisted reason I didn't\u2026\"\n\n\nTears had stopped welling out of me, and now I only stood there sniffling, my hands cleaning up the tears that were still on my cheeks.\n\n\n\"What have I done to myself? Why have I done this to myself??\"\n\n\n\"I am unable to give you an answer to that\u2026 But I don't think you should be here anymore.\"\n\n\n\"Probably.

You have so much to give to this world, and you do not have to spend the rest of your life here, trying to do anything at all.\"\n\n\nI breathed out, sitting on the table to gain some stability.\n\n\n\"Yeah\u2026 I'll think of something\u2026\"\n\n\n\"You have your father as well. He surely misses you.\"\n\n\nA very faint smile came across me.\n\n\n\"He definitely does. Just not sure how he'd react to seeing me after so long.\"\n\n\nI cleared the tears from underneath my glasses. The room was silent. Past me had stopped crying, or maybe he still was, and I just couldn't hear it. Eventually the caretaker asked.\n\n\n\"Shall we leave this place?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, we probably should.\"\n\n\nAnd so we did. We went out of the office, and then we went out of the orb. We looked at each other.\n\n\n\"Farewell, Jake Granger.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-8115A\n\n\n \n\n\nResult and assessment\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSCP-8115 has been deemed partially successful.

We have the best healthcare in the world, as you know, and this could massively help your father.
