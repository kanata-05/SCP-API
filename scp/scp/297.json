Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure. Personnel wishing to utilize SCP-297 for experimental or field purposes must fill out a Form-32 and submit it to the head of Research and Containment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-297 is a transparent plastic vibrator, approximately 30\u00a0cm in length, 5\u00a0cm in width. Examination has determined that the internal structure has been heavily altered, and that the standard 6\u00a0V power supply has been converted into what appears to be a micronized nuclear reactor powered by a small quantity of plutonium.\n\n\nIn addition, the standard power/intensity controls have been altered from the normal on/off switch with secondary intensity dial, to a single five-stage selector switch. The bottom four intensity levels (off, low, medium, high) appear to be within normal parameters for such a device, and can be used safely for such purposes if so desired.\n\n\nWhen turned to the highest intensity setting (labeled \"suicide\"), SCP-297's vibration frequency swiftly increases to upwards of 200,000\u00a0kHz. If the upper portion of the device is touched to any solid material, SCP-297 will change frequency to one that causes a positive harmonic feedback loop in the object, causing the object to lose cohesion within sixty seconds of continual contact. This invariably kills organisms that it is exposed to.\n\n\nExperimentation has determined that SCP-297 can disintegrate a 1 meter cube of concrete into powder within ten seconds. The time required for other objects varies, based on the density and harmonic properties of the material. Due to the similarities between the effects of SCP-297 and \nSCP-1012\n, investigation into whether both effects are variations of the same phenomena are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Circumstances of Retrieval: SCP-297 was retrieved from the third basement of the parking structure of a thirty-story apartment building in Los Angeles, California, on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. According to eyewitnesses, the device bored a vertical hole through the entire building's northwestern corner, starting from the 30th floor and proceeding, floor by floor, through the entire structure, until a maintenance worker neutralized the device by turning it off. All witnesses were detained and administered Class A amnestics, and the device was retrieved by Foundation personnel. A large quantity of organic slurry (later identified as a liquefied human body) was found on the thirtieth floor, at the upper limit of the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\u00a0popular\u00a0works\u00a0by\u00a0this\u00a0author\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2317\n\n\nRating: 2754\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-231\n\n\nRating: 2510\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Clef's Proposal\n\n\nRating: 2464\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-048\n\n\nRating: 1676\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-447\n\n\nRating: 924\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-016\n\n\nRating: 848\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4960\n\n\nRating: 699\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-823\n\n\nRating: 670\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-953\n\n\nRating: 651\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-572\n\n\nRating: 598\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-450\n\n\nRating: 525\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPC-1764\n\n\nRating: 483\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-668\n\n\nRating: 468\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-297\n\n\nRating: 401\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-807\n\n\nRating: 338\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1949\n\n\nRating: 296\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-233\n\n\nRating: 198\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8009\n\n\nRating: 185\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-031\n\n\nRating: 182\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2461\n\n\nRating: 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-784-ARC\n\n\nRating: 133\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8109\n\n\nRating: 113\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales, Canons, and Hubs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of Dr. Clef's seminar, \"Reality Benders and You: How to Survive When Existence Doesn't.\"\n\n\nRating: 1590\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Multiverses and Dandelion Wine\n\n\nRating: 492\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDa Capo al Fine\n\n\nRating: 449\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination_Order\n\n\nRating: 437\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation \"Camp Granada\"\n\n\nRating: 365\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChowderclef\n\n\nRating: 321\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of a lecture given by Professor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on Applied Thaumatology.\n\n\nRating: 303\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRascal One Actual\n\n\nRating: 295\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's In A Name?\n\n\nRating: 289\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Hell\n\n\nRating: 287\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript of a lecture given by Professor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on Aetheric Energy and Aspect Radiation.\n\n\nRating: 284\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts from PHYSICS Division Field Manual 13: Special Circumstances, Humanoid Threat Entities\n\n\nRating: 278\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Report 239-B-192\n\n\nRating: 277\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContingency\n\n\nRating: 274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. . . the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known.\n\n\nRating: 273\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird Date\n\n\nRating: 252\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flesh That Mates\n\n\nRating: 249\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Zero -
