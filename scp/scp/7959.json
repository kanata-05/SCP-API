Thankfully, the nature of the anomaly ensures some level of self-containment. Should this no longer be the case, containment efforts are to be reassessed. Investigation of the anomaly can then recommence, to whatever degree this is possible.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7959 refers to TL-7959, a Foundation timeline discovered during routine indexing of the local canonical bundle that displays atypical properties when compared to adjacent timelines, an anomalously improbable behavior.\n\n\nTL-7959 is inaccessible through all possible efforts; Any attempt to assess the properties of this timeline invariably fail, through a variety of factors such as data corruption, equipment failure, cerebral hemorrhage, SCP-7959-A, etcetera. If there exists some means of understanding this timeline and its eligibility for existence within the Database, it has yet to be discovered.\n\n\nSCP-7959-A is a universally received result during observatory efforts of TL-7959, which manifests as a singular message of uniform nature, despite medium or language.\n\n\nThe contents of SCP-7959-A have been recorded below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7959-A TRANSCRIPT LOG\n\n\nFOREWARD:\n Record of message from measurement of TL-7959, delivered by one party, labeled POI-7959.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>\n\n\nPOI-7959:\n Hello.\n\n\nPOI-7959:\n Thank you for your interest in our dimension.\n\n\nPOI-7959:\n Regrettably, I must inform you that the Prime Timeline is closed.\n1\n Please return during normal hours, where we will be more than happy to assist you.
