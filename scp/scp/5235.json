All transmissions are to be logged and scanned for mentions of \"the Foundation\" or \"Thaddeus Xyank\".

This broadcast was picked up by a Foundation monitoring station in Portland, Oregon. The contents of the transmission are located below.\n\n\n\n\nIf you see this, it's Xyank. We fucked up.\n\n\nSomething\u2026 else, found us somehow. Some kind of predatory entity. We're pretty much done for; the world is warping and tearing around us as I type this. Things from the Other Place are pushing their way through the gaps in reality. The First Hytoth wants its space back, and we're in the way.\n\n\nBy the time you see this, we will be gone. Dead probably, depends if I can find a way out of the causality mess. Both timelines seem to be ripping themselves apart.\n\n\nIf this happened to us, it can happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following attached file requires 05 clearance.
