Removal of SCP-4207-A from SCP-4207-B is prohibited. Personnel should monitor SCP-4207-B for any changes in audio activity.\n\n\nAt least one Level-2 personnel or higher is to converse with SCP-4207-C for a maximum of ten minutes daily. This should be done in an internally soundproof environment to prevent external influence and other auditory disturbance. Conversations are to be recorded in full with the designated audio recording device provided on-site. These conversations are to be submitted to the acting Senior Researcher on duty.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4207 is a TDK SA90 Type II audio cassette (SCP-4207-A) inserted in a Type EL 3302 cassette player (SCP-4207-B). Removing SCP-4207-A from SCP-4207-B and playing it in any other device does not eliminate its anomalous properties. Attempts to pause, rewind and overwrite SCP-4207-A through SCP-4207-B's piano keys have so far been ineffective.\n\n\nThe tape inside SCP-4207-A is constantly moving at a speed of 7.2\u00a0cm/s (from left to right) despite the absence of any obvious power source, and maintains this movement even after removal from SCP-4207-B. Since initial containment, SCP-4207-A's continuous playback has been calculated to a length of at least 21,000 kilometers, or approximately 120,000 hours of playtime.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram of SCP-4207-C during 01/28/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen in proximity of an individual's effective hearing range, SCP-4207-B commences the audio of an entity designated as SCP-4207-C. Removing SCP-4207-A from SCP-4207-B prohibits this anomalous effect. SCP-4207-C will then attempt to communicate with the individual verbally, usually through a distorted woman's voice. Surveillance shows that SCP-4207-B is mostly passive outside the proximity of any individual, playing unintelligible noises of various composition. However, there are certain occasions SCP-4207-C plays indistinct vocalizations within the background. Despite resembling English, auditory analysis from these vocalizations has been inconclusive due to the severely distorted quality of audio when recorded to another media.\n\n\nSCP-4207-A appears to record any conversation and auditory phenomena within its area of effect, even after withdrawal from SCP-4207-B. In most cases, after two or more interactions with the same individual, SCP-4207-C has been observed to replay recorded audio in order to justify its position in discussion, preserving a sense of continuity. These includes transcripts and/or excerpts from various conversations and other acoustic phenomena such as electronic noises, indistinct chatters, etc. The process by which SCP-4207-C is able to access these recordings through SCP-4207-A despite variations in time stamps and physical restrictions is currently unknown.\n\n\nAddendum 01:\n On 01/14/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an estimated 95 false killer whales (\nPseudorca crassidens\n) beached themselves on a remote mangrove beach in mainland Monroe County, Florida, in the western Everglades National Park. Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588 initially anticipated the event due to an unidentified auditory anomaly triangulated throughout the region. Site-113 Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was subsequently advised to immediately send personnel on the location.\n\n\nUpon arrival, Simoun Hayder and two other Foundation agents discovered a 17 year old female named Mia Burke at the scene, in possession of SCP-4207-B. Burke was in a state of panic and distress. Since the location was remote and the event too coincidental, Agent Hayder contacted Site-113 and reported the incident. After confirmation, Agent Hayder immediately detained Burke and confiscated the object.\n\n\nFoundation agents returned to the location after approximately twenty minutes and found that most of the whales had disappeared, with the exception of three expired specimens. Autopsy revealed that all of the specimens had auditory impairment which might have led to their beaching.\n\n\nThe following interviews were conducted after the initial designation of SCP-4207:\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a04207-01-A\n\n\n\n\n\u25c0\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Graeme Vinycomb\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-4207-C\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview conducted two hours after acquisition of SCP-4207-A and SCP-4207-B. \nNOTE: Italicized text are recordings.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-4207-C:\n HELLO [pause] HELLO\n\n\nGraeme:\n Oh, greetings.\n\n\nSCP-4207-C:\n HOW ARE YOU\n\n\nGraeme:\n I'm okay.

I'm going to ask a few questions. Please answer them as honest as possible. This is a serious matter.\n\n\nMia:\n Okay. Go on.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How did you acquire the tape and the player?\n\n\nMia:\n Oh, the player is mine.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Okay. So, where did you get the tape?\n\n\n[Unresponsive for five seconds]\n\n\nMia:\n I found it on a beach. About a few miles near the place where I was found.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How, exactly?\n\n\nMia:\n Beside a dead whale or something. I was intrigued, so I decided to take a closer look. That's when I saw the tape.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How did you first met the entity?\n\n\nMia:\n I decided to take it home and try it. I mean, who wouldn't take a tape moving on its own? It didn't play anything at first though. Just static and noises. Then, after a few minutes, it spoke. She spoke to me.\n\n\n[Unresponsive for three seconds]\n\n\nGraeme:\n Interesting. Do you still remember your exact words when first heard her speak?\n\n\nMia:\n My exact words? Well, \n\"Whoa! Is this for real? Oh my god. This is unbelievable. How can you talk to me? Do you know what you are?\"\n She laughed. It was creepy but after a while I laughed too.\n\n\nGraeme:\n You seem to be close to her.\n\n\nMia:\n Yeah. She seems to like me a lot.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How did the tape speak at first?\n\n\nMia:\n How can I explain this. Like it was recorded, I guess.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How so?\n\n\nMia:\n It's like she's not speaking but obviously she is. It's hard to believe.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Why did you decided to take that tape from the beach? Did you hear her or something?\n\n\nMia:\n I just got curious. Hey, is she gonna be okay? She never did anything bad.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Of course. But you need to tell me more about her.\n\n\n[Unresponsive for eight seconds]\n\n\nMia:\n [sigh] She's sweet, mostly. She's been like a six year old sister to me for the past three months. She'll occasionally play these conversations from people. Sometimes, it's just clicking sounds or something. Other times, it's just rain and sound of the ocean. Every time I'm upset, she just makes me hear these sounds which I guess please her.\n\n\nGraeme:\n So she just plays these sounds?\n\n\nMia:\n Yup. Sometimes it's weird though. She will play conversations of me talking with my Mom and my friends at school. Sometimes she even plays certain conversations that I don't remember I ever said. Like the one where I promised to keep her safe.\n\n\nGraeme:\n How did you know you didn't say that then? And how are you sure it wasn't you?\n\n\nMia:\n Because it's my voice. I felt it.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Do you always bring her with you?\n\n\nMia:\n No. She never gets out of my room. She'd creep out everyone else, obviously. The thing with the whales? That's the first time we ever went out together.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Why did both of you come there in the first place?\n\n\nMia:\n She told me her big friends were coming. That she would introduce me.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Friends?\n\n\nMia:\n Yeah. It's weird because, you know, she's a tape, and she doesn't even know what the word \"friend\" actually means.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Did you asked her about who these \"friends\" are?\n\n\nMia:\n No, I didn't.\n\n\nGraeme:\n So, what happened after? Please continue.\n\n\nMia:\n After we arrived, we waited for about fifteen minutes. Then, those big dolphins came and just kept stranding themselves. It was so scary.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Does anybody know about the tape?\n\n\nMia:\n No. Just me.\n\n\nGraeme:\n Okay. I guess this is enough for now. Thank you for your time, Mia.\n\n\n[Unresponsive for six seconds]\n\n\nGraeme:\n We'll have to keep you here for the next few days for more interviews.

Two killer whales (\nOrcinus orca\n)\n2\n attacked and killed three personnel attempting to sedate them. Site Director Scarlet Winters decided to [REDACTED] so that the whales could be sent back as swiftly as possible to prevent public attention. The incident was successfully neutralized after three hours, with the Foundation experiencing three casualties and six other minor injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram of SCP-4207-C in 03/21/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 03:\n For six days, SCP-4207-A was not returned to SCP-4207-B, which consequently affected the behavior of SCP-4207-C. From all the interviews taken, SCP-4207-C was entirely unresponsive. While mostly in a continuous play of white noise, there were certain occasions in which recordings of \"waves\" and \"rain\", along with other inaudible noises, were played for several hours at random intervals. On 03/21/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a series of \"clicks\" and \"pulses\" were played for approximately thirty minutes. Auditory analysis suggests a cetacean origin, specifically in the \nDelphinidae\n family, although this is highly speculative due to insufficient spectrographic data. This behavior and audio activity continued until SCP-4207-A was finally returned to SCP-4207-B on 03/23/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum 04:\n On 04/02/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a pygmy killer whale (\nFeresa attenuata\n) was found stranded on the coast of New Caledonia, \u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometers from Site-113. The specimen expired two hours later due to parasitic encephalitis caused by nematodes. A cassette physically identical to SCP-4207-A was retrieved from the specimen's digestive tract.

I'm going to ask a few questions. Please answer them as honest as possible. This is a serious matter. Mia: Okay. Go on. Graeme: How did you acquire the tape and the player? Mia: Oh, the player is mine. Graeme: Okay. So, where did you get the tape? [Unresponsive for five seconds] Mia: I found it on a beach. About a few miles near the place where I was found. Graeme: How, exactly? Mia: Beside a dead whale or something. I was intrigued, so I decided to take a closer look. That's when I saw the tape. Graeme: How did you first met the entity? Mia: I decided to take it home and try it. I mean, who wouldn't take a tape moving on its own? It didn't play anything at first though. Just static and noises. Then, after a few minutes, it spoke. She spoke to me. [Unresponsive for three seconds] Graeme: Interesting. Do you still remember your exact words when first heard her speak? Mia: My exact words? Well, \"Whoa! Is this for real? Oh my god. This is unbelievable. How can you talk to me? Do you know what you are?\" She laughed. It was creepy but after a while I laughed too. Graeme: You seem to be close to her. Mia: Yeah. She seems to like me a lot. Graeme: How did the tape speak at first? Mia: How can I explain this. Like it was recorded, I guess. Graeme: How so? Mia: It's like she's not speaking but obviously she is. It's hard to believe. Graeme: Why did you decided to take that tape from the beach? Did you hear her or something? Mia: I just got curious. Hey, is she gonna be okay? She never did anything bad. Graeme: Of course. But you need to tell me more about her. [Unresponsive for eight seconds] Mia: [sigh] She's sweet, mostly. She's been like a six year old sister to me for the past three months. She'll occasionally play these conversations from people. Sometimes, it's just clicking sounds or something. Other times, it's just rain and sound of the ocean. Every time I'm upset, she just makes me hear these sounds which I guess please her. Graeme: So she just plays these sounds? Mia: Yup. Sometimes it's weird though. She will play conversations of me talking with my Mom and my friends at school. Sometimes she even plays certain conversations that I don't remember I ever said. Like the one where I promised to keep her safe. Graeme: How did you know you didn't say that then? And how are you sure it wasn't you? Mia: Because it's my voice. I felt it. Graeme: Do you always bring her with you? Mia: No. She never gets out of my room. She'd creep out everyone else, obviously. The thing with the whales? That's the first time we ever went out together. Graeme: Why did both of you come there in the first place? Mia: She told me her big friends were coming. That she would introduce me. Graeme: Friends? Mia: Yeah. It's weird because, you know, she's a tape, and she doesn't even know what the word \"friend\" actually means. Graeme: Did you asked her about who these \"friends\" are? Mia: No, I didn't. Graeme: So, what happened after? Please continue. Mia: After we arrived, we waited for about fifteen minutes. Then, those big dolphins came and just kept stranding themselves. It was so scary. Graeme: Does anybody know about the tape? Mia: No. Just me. Graeme: Okay. I guess this is enough for now. Thank you for your time, Mia. [Unresponsive for six seconds] Graeme: We'll have to keep you here for the next few days for more interviews. Just tell the personnel what you need. [Subject nods] <End Log>",
