All reindoctrination research results should be notified to the Lead Project Parapsychologist.\n\n\nSCP-4694-L instances (see Figure 1) should be recovered where possible and secured in sight/sound-proof containers at the site most local to recovery.\n\n\nThere are no plans to contain the Cherished Leaders.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4694 is an emergent para-dimensional phenomena manifesting in this reality as a multi-level marketing company (MLM).\n\n\nSCP-4694 is characterized by an extreme personality cult built around the \u201cCherished Leaders,\u201d an as-yet unidentified collective who direct and control members (known as \u201cAssociates\u201d) through both mundane peer pressure, cult programming and anomalous positive/negative reinforcement.\n\n\nThe primary purpose of mundane MLMs is the generation of revenue through the recruitment of new members. SCP-4694\u2019s primary purpose is unknown, although recovered media and promotional material suggests the importance of belonging and family values.\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0PryMaid\u00a0Media\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0PryMaid\u00a0Media\n\n\n\n\nInfomercial:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript: Female Voiceover: \n\"PryMaid: the Generation of Happiness.

None describe their experiences within SCP-4694 as out of the ordinary or unusual. In December 2016 field agent Aaron Zachary successfully infiltrated the organisation by befriending a known female Associate (codename \"Autoship\"); following is an extract of his outbound communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate/Time:\n\n\nComms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-10-18\u00a010:17\n\n\nNow FB friends with \nAutoship\n.

Write down nine things I want PryMaid to help me achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-12-01\n\n\nChallenge #4, write down 27 things I don't like about myself. Share on PrySpace.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-12-25\u00a019:11\n\n\nChristmas. \nAutoship\n has irons in her kitchen, her bedroom, her bathroom. No TVs, just irons where the TVs should be. Her Nativity Scene? Three Wise Men overlooking an electric iron in a manger. An electric iron Baby Jesus. Go figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-04-27\u00a006:30\n\n\nWe have a Recognition Day in June. I'll become a fully fledged Associate. God bless America. This week's challenge: Post a video about the top eight hundred things you hate most about the non-PryMaid authority figures in your life. Done and done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-06-29\u00a002:35\n\n\nFinal challenge this week: find all skin care products in the house and bury them. Random, but done. Recognition Day tomorrow.

A female self-identified as Janey Goodwill is addressing the audience. Zachary turns to take in a panorama shot; there are approximately eight thousand people in the crowd.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n How are you all today?\n\n\nCheers from the audience\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Are you making money today?\n\n\nCheers from the audience\n.\n\n\nAutoship:\n This is amazing! I always \n(indistinct)\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Do you know why you're here today?\n\n\nMany indistinct responses from the audience.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n You're here because you're winners. You're here because you're PryMaid's newest stars - and talking of stars \u2013\n\n\nThe auditorium lights brighten and a large projection screen displays the words \"Is The Sky The Limit? NO SIR!\"\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n A whole load of science tells us that we are born of stars and suns and galaxy dust. We come from the \nstars.\n Isn't that something?\n\n\nAudience cheers and claps.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Where do we come from?\n\n\nAudience responds with shouts of \"We come from the stars!\"\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Everything, from the tiniest flea to the biggest whale, comes from the stars. There are so many exciting business opportunities right now!\n\n\nAudience claps and cheers. The screen displays the phrase \"All Life Is The Same.\"\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n All life is the same. All life is the same. Our message goes out to everybody, and everybody and everything responds to that message. Everybody loves us. If they don\u2019t, they just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\n\nApplause\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Or\u2026 \n(lights dim)\n Maybe there are those who really \ndon\u2019t\n love us. They know about belonging, but they \ndon't\n belong. They know about love, but they \ndon't\n love. They. Don't. Love. Do you want someone like that in your life?\n\n\nAudience boos and catcalls\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Negative thinkers? Cut them out. Just cut them out. They don't exist. They don't exist. Doesn't matter if it's your husband, your wife, your daughter, your pastor - even Jesus Himself. They will try to drive a wedge between you and PryMaid \u2013 between you and everything you \nlove\n, everything you \nbelong\n to, and they will bring you down. They will bring you down.\n\n\nAudience jeers and catcalls enthusiastically\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n It's so important to fill your life with positivity. Positive people, positive messages - because \nnegativity\n grows like a cancer, like an old man's cancer that spreads from a photograph taken at a wedding reception when he didn't even know he \nhad\n cancer, and it engulfs everything. The people in the photograph, the photograph itself, the photo frame, the mantelpiece it sat on, the arthritic pet dog that moved too slow to escape the metastasis as it overtook the room\u2026 And then the walls, the roof\u2026 \nThe whole house\n\u2026 Eventually the whole world. Eventually the whole \nuniverse\n. All riddled with cancer. All bloating and blossoming and bubbling away. And then who knows where.\n\n\nLights dim. The screen displays the message, \"Apostasis - Downlines - Eternity\"\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Positivity is a living thing. And when you lose positivity, it dies. Goes to an awful place, a terrible place, and it dies. If I showed you that place - you would know. You would \nknow\n how important it is to follow our path.\n\n\n\n\nThe screen displays the message, \n\"V-SC LC B7-M988-T935-H537 Welcomes New Guests Helena Jeffers, Abeo Akintola and\n \n[REDACTED]\n\"\n\n\nAutoship:\n That's me! Why's my name up there? I don't -\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n - want that negativity in my life. Do you?\n\n\nAudience murmurs; words are indistinct\n.\n\n\nAutoship:\n What does that mean? Why's my name up there?\n\n\nAgent Zachary:\n Special recognition? Maybe \n(indistinct)\n.\n\n\nAutoship:\n No. I don't - no, this doesn't feel right. This - can we - I want to go home. I want to go home.\n\n\nJaney Goodwil:\n Truth is, some are already there.\n\n\nAutoship:\n \nI want to go home.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n You turn away from PryMaid and all bets are off. All bets are off.\n\n\n\n\nAutoship:\n Three point one four one -\n\n\nFor the next ninety six hours Autoship accurately recites Pi to 300,000 places. Janey Goodwill continues to present to the audience (details lost due to noise interference from Autoship). Neither Autoship's behaviour nor the time taken is acknowledged by Goodwill, Zachary or any other attendees at any point. After ninety six hours Autoship's vocalisations cease abruptly.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n \n(audio recording becomes clearer)\n - but that's why you're here right now. You're here to be recognised. You're here for Recognition Day.\n\n\nApplause\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n You'll recognise - and be recognised by - other Recognised Associates. Today, you and your descendant/ascendant genetic material contemporaries will be forever bonded with the PryMaid family. It's like carrying a photograph of your wife or husband in your wallet or purse, but it's with you all the time. It's kinda like a secret handshake\u2026 But don't just take my word for it\u2026 Because\u2026\n\n\nAudience hushes\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Because\u2026\n\n\nAudience becomes silent\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Because\u2026 I have three very very \nvery\n special guests here right now\u2026 I think it's fair to say I idolise these amazing, caring, generous guys. I think you will too. Thing is, they're kinda shy. Can you do something for me?\n\n\nAudience cheers\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n I need all cell phones, all cameras, all recording equipment turned off. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't.\n\n\nNoise as a large number of cell phones are switched off\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Thank you all. Now if you've taken any analgesics today, prescribed or otherwise, please make your way to the back of the auditorium where a designated helper will be able to assist. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't.\n\n\nNoise as a number of the audience move to the back of the auditorium\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n Okay guys\u2026 Are you ready to meet them?\n\n\nLights in auditorium start to dim. Audience erupts into applause and cheers\n.\n\n\nJaney Goodwill:\n I said (shouting) \nare you ready to meet them\n? They've come a long, long way to be with us here today. So please, please, please give it up for the Cherished Leaders! Come on, make some noise! Let them know you love them!\n\n\nAudience responds rapturously, including Agent Zachary\n.\n\n\n96:56:06\n \nAll lights in the auditorium switch off. Multiple spotlights switch on and \"sweep\" over the audience whilst the screen rises away; behind the screen are revealed three 9 meter tall SCP-4694-L instances facing out towards the audience. The audience cheers. Video is lost from this point.\n\n\nVoiceover:\n And now, a personal message from the Cherished Leaders\u2026\n\n\nThe following abridged file contains 68 seconds of audio. The full recording continues for a further 131 hours. At the \n227:26:02\n mark, Autoship can be heard pleading for two minutes. The remainder of the audio consists of prolonged vocalisations of distress over repeated bursts of sibilance.\n\n\nThe audience applaudes throughout.\n\n\nThe recording ends at the \n368:21:44\n mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nAgent Zachary has made no further attempt to contact Autoship, and Foundation operatives have been unable to reinitiate surveillance.\n\n\nWithin three weeks Zachary had recruited his wife, three children and extended family into the PryMaid organisation. On 2017-10-30 Zachary was amnesticized to remove sensitive Foundation knowledge and taken into Foundation custody.\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a series of interviews relating to his experiences within PryMaid.\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Interview\u00a0w/Agent\u00a0Zachary\u00a0#034\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0w/Zachary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2017-11-11\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-83\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Lead Project Parapsychologist Dr Jacob Bufirst\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Agent Aaron Zachary (redesignation pending)\n\n\nNotes:\n Zachary believes himself to be undergoing a self-funded post-Recognition Day orientation workshop.\n\n\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Hi Aaron. Today I'd like us to go through a typical day.\n\n\n\n\nZachary:\n Great. What day is it today?\n\n\nDr J Bufirst:\n Wednesday.\n\n\nZachary:\n Yeah, Wednesdays are special. Wednesdays we perform the Family Blessings.\n\n\nDr J Bufirst:\n Explain it like I\u2019m new.\n\n\nZachary:\n I call it \"Brand Loyalty.\" Cyndie thinks it's in bad taste but whatever. Wednesdays are like mini Recognition Days but just for us - myself, Cyndie, the kids. We use the basement. I put an icebox in and we were good to go.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Why the basement?\n\n\nZachary:\n Easiest to soundproof.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Soundproof?\n\n\nZachary:\n The Family Blessings really help us gel as a family \u2013 but you don\u2019t get that without a few tears along the way. You know what five year olds are like.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n You mentioned an icebox?\n\n\nZachary:\n Yeah that\u2019s for \nafter\n the Family Blessings - after we've used the Likenesses.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n I don't follow. How do you - ?\n\n\nZachary:\n Easiest if I show you.\n\n\nZachary stands up and starts to unbutton his shirt.\n\n\nZachary:\n We all have the Likenesses in our homes. They watch over you in the kitchen, in the car, in the shower. Sometimes though that isn't practical. Can\u2019t go swimming with a Likeness (laughs). \nThis\n way the Cherished Leaders are always with you, always. Damn buttons.\n\n\nZachary fumbles with shirt and exposes torso, chest, shoulder and upper arms.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n You look normal enough.\n\n\nZachary:\n Yeah. I have to \nwant\n you to see or you won't. After Recognition Day, you can see - you can \nrecognise\n other Associates everywhere - you see it all over them - it's like we're taking over. You starting to see? Looks beautiful on the kids. You remember \u201dBrand Loyalty?\u201d Well this bit's \u201cBrand awareness.\u201d Emphasis on \nbrand.\n\n\nSilence for seven seconds.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n \nJesus God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Zachary\u00a0Aftercare\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Zachary\u00a0Aftercare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Zachary post-containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZachary has requested access to an SCP-4694-L instance to continue the Family Blessings. Request is currently pending approval from the Ethics Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 2018-11-27 Zachary disappeared from his containment unit. He reappeared six hours later in a state of extreme distress; in his possession was a \nTelevono\n Telefex Vivisect 4 smartphone, which he states he had been given to take video footage of a PryMaid \"Learning Camp\" at an unknown location. His disappearance was allegedly an unscheduled reward from PryMaid for \"services rendered.\" He was unable to confirm the nature of his breach.\n\n\nThe following audio clip was recorded at the Learning Camp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript: \nFactory noise. Female Voiceover: \"All life is the same. All life is the same. Work towards Freedom. Advanced Warning! Limb pruning in Sector 8-8-3-7-3-6-3. Please leave all surplus skin in the green receptacles.

So what exactly is \n\"Learning Camp V-SC LC-B7-M49-T957-H777\"\n?\n\n\nZachary:\n It's a prison factory. A massive prison factory.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Housing who?\n\n\nZachary:\n Everybody. Every\nthing\n. Dead Associates making Likenesses forever. That's where we all go. I saw a girl - I didn't know her, she said her name was [REDACTED]. She said she knew me. I'd never set eyes on her before. She'd been there all her life. Her and her children. Begged me to help them.. She said, \"\nAll life is the same.\n\"\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Meaning?\n\n\n\n\nZachary:\n I saw \npigs\n there. \nPigs\n with iron burns all over their bodies, trying to make the Likenesses with their trotters. Fumbling, dropping them. Shitting themselves in fear. \nChrist.\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n Anything else?\n\n\nZachary:\n I don't know how to say this\u2026 Do you recall Recognition Day? The talk Janey Goodwill gave about family?\n\n\nDr Bufirst:\n \n\u201cYou and your descendant/ascendant genetic material contemporaries will be forever bonded with the PryMaid family.\u201d\n\n\nZachary:\n \n(nods)\n They gave me the phone to show you \"\nthe future that already exists.\n\" They told me to say, \"\nYou, your wife and unborn twins say hi.\n\"\n\n\nAt this point Dr Bufirst removes the phone from its portable unit, reviews its contents and becomes distressed. He is unable to continue and the interview is terminated accordingly.\n\n\nZachary is still in containment and still regularly requests an SCP-4694-L instance to perform the Family Blessings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n \nI have a theory that no one else believes but I'll write it down here. Maybe it'll get reviewed and wiped, maybe it won't.\n\n\nI think - I believe maybe whatever PryMaid is, it's huge. Vast. It spreads its thoughts, its feelers into the aquarium of our reality and taps the glass and watches as we skitter and dart back into the fake plastic seaweed like frightened little fish. And maybe we can leap up and out of one and into the next, but PryMaid are there too.\n\n\nMaybe all the different realities are simply different fishtanks, side by side, some below, some above, some filled with water, some with blood. Some with fire, some with cement. I don't know. But PryMaid - or whatever they manifest as - is in all of them, or above or around them, and the weight of their unreality pushes, pushes down on ours.\n\n\nI think the phone and the cancer anomalies - SCP-2982 and 2962 - hell maybe\n all \nthe anomalies we've ever known - are just signs of SCP-4694 seeping in as all the fishtanks start to crack. And you know what? Sometimes those signs are horrific, blasphemous, soul-destroying; but sometimes they're not.\n\n\nI guess that's the best I can hope for now, because Lisa rang me earlier today and told me I'm going to be a father. And one day my children will have children, and they will become PryMaid Associates and we will all end up in a Learning Camp forever, one big happy family.\n\n\nSo I guess I must take my comfort where I can. Take solace as all the Things That Cannot Be come squirming uninvited into our world and invite us to insanity. Sometimes the signs are horrible, inhuman, grotesque; but sometimes the signs fail in their purpose; sometimes instead of offering horror and grief, they offer compassion. Instead of hate, hope.\n\n\nSometimes they wipe our faces in their shit; but sometimes, just sometimes, they raise us out of it just long enough to know that our frightful, damaged little human lives are beautiful and noble and undefeatable.\n\n\nThat's my hope: that even though the vast majority of the things we see are nightmarish, sometimes they're not. \nSometimes they're not.\n.\n\n\nTo my grandchildren.\n\n\nDr Jacob Bufirst.\n\n\n23rd December 2018\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

All life is the same. Our message goes out to everybody, and everybody and everything responds to that message. Everybody loves us. If they don\u2019t, they just don\u2019t know it yet. Applause . Janey Goodwill: Or\u2026 (lights dim) Maybe there are those who really don\u2019t love us. They know about belonging, but they don't belong. They know about love, but they don't love. They. Don't. Love. Do you want someone like that in your life? Audience boos and catcalls . Janey Goodwill: Negative thinkers? Cut them out. Just cut them out. They don't exist. They don't exist. Doesn't matter if it's your husband, your wife, your daughter, your pastor - even Jesus Himself. They will try to drive a wedge between you and PryMaid \u2013 between you and everything you love , everything you belong to, and they will bring you down. They will bring you down. Audience jeers and catcalls enthusiastically . Janey Goodwill: It's so important to fill your life with positivity. Positive people, positive messages - because negativity grows like a cancer, like an old man's cancer that spreads from a photograph taken at a wedding reception when he didn't even know he had cancer, and it engulfs everything. The people in the photograph, the photograph itself, the photo frame, the mantelpiece it sat on, the arthritic pet dog that moved too slow to escape the metastasis as it overtook the room\u2026 And then the walls, the roof\u2026 The whole house \u2026 Eventually the whole world. Eventually the whole universe . All riddled with cancer. All bloating and blossoming and bubbling away. And then who knows where. Lights dim. The screen displays the message, \"Apostasis - Downlines - Eternity\" Janey Goodwill: Positivity is a living thing. And when you lose positivity, it dies. Goes to an awful place, a terrible place, and it dies. If I showed you that place - you would know. You would know how important it is to follow our path. The screen displays the message, \"V-SC LC B7-M988-T935-H537 Welcomes New Guests Helena Jeffers, Abeo Akintola and [REDACTED] \" Autoship: That's me! Why's my name up there? I don't - Janey Goodwill: - want that negativity in my life. Do you? Audience murmurs; words are indistinct . Autoship: What does that mean? Why's my name up there? Agent Zachary: Special recognition? Maybe (indistinct) . Autoship: No. I don't - no, this doesn't feel right. This - can we - I want to go home. I want to go home. Janey Goodwil: Truth is, some are already there. Autoship: I want to go home. Janey Goodwill: You turn away from PryMaid and all bets are off. All bets are off. Autoship: Three point one four one - For the next ninety six hours Autoship accurately recites Pi to 300,000 places. Janey Goodwill continues to present to the audience (details lost due to noise interference from Autoship). Neither Autoship's behaviour nor the time taken is acknowledged by Goodwill, Zachary or any other attendees at any point. After ninety six hours Autoship's vocalisations cease abruptly. Janey Goodwill: (audio recording becomes clearer) - but that's why you're here right now. You're here to be recognised. You're here for Recognition Day. Applause . Janey Goodwill: You'll recognise - and be recognised by - other Recognised Associates. Today, you and your descendant/ascendant genetic material contemporaries will be forever bonded with the PryMaid family. It's like carrying a photograph of your wife or husband in your wallet or purse, but it's with you all the time. It's kinda like a secret handshake\u2026 But don't just take my word for it\u2026 Because\u2026 Audience hushes . Janey Goodwill: Because\u2026 Audience becomes silent . Janey Goodwill: Because\u2026 I have three very very very special guests here right now\u2026 I think it's fair to say I idolise these amazing, caring, generous guys. I think you will too. Thing is, they're kinda shy. Can you do something for me? Audience cheers . Janey Goodwill: I need all cell phones, all cameras, all recording equipment turned off. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't. Noise as a large number of cell phones are switched off . Janey Goodwill: Thank you all. Now if you've taken any analgesics today, prescribed or otherwise, please make your way to the back of the auditorium where a designated helper will be able to assist. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't. Noise as a number of the audience move to the back of the auditorium . Janey Goodwill: Okay guys\u2026 Are you ready to meet them? Lights in auditorium start to dim. Audience erupts into applause and cheers . Janey Goodwill: I said (shouting) are you ready to meet them ? They've come a long, long way to be with us here today. So please, please, please give it up for the Cherished Leaders! Come on, make some noise! Let them know you love them! Audience responds rapturously, including Agent Zachary . 96:56:06 All lights in the auditorium switch off. Multiple spotlights switch on and \"sweep\" over the audience whilst the screen rises away; behind the screen are revealed three 9 meter tall SCP-4694-L instances facing out towards the audience. The audience cheers. Video is lost from this point. Voiceover: And now, a personal message from the Cherished Leaders\u2026 The following abridged file contains 68 seconds of audio. The full recording continues for a further 131 hours. At the 227:26:02 mark, Autoship can be heard pleading for two minutes. The remainder of the audio consists of prolonged vocalisations of distress over repeated bursts of sibilance. The audience applaudes throughout. The recording ends at the 368:21:44 mark.",
        "Date: 2017-11-11 Location: Site-83 Interviewer: Lead Project Parapsychologist Dr Jacob Bufirst Interviewee: Agent Aaron Zachary (redesignation pending) Notes: Zachary believes himself to be undergoing a self-funded post-Recognition Day orientation workshop. Dr Bufirst: Hi Aaron. Today I'd like us to go through a typical day. Zachary: Great. What day is it today? Dr J Bufirst: Wednesday. Zachary: Yeah, Wednesdays are special. Wednesdays we perform the Family Blessings. Dr J Bufirst: Explain it like I\u2019m new. Zachary: I call it \"Brand Loyalty.\" Cyndie thinks it's in bad taste but whatever. Wednesdays are like mini Recognition Days but just for us - myself, Cyndie, the kids. We use the basement. I put an icebox in and we were good to go. Dr Bufirst: Why the basement? Zachary: Easiest to soundproof. Dr Bufirst: Soundproof? Zachary: The Family Blessings really help us gel as a family \u2013 but you don\u2019t get that without a few tears along the way. You know what five year olds are like. Dr Bufirst: You mentioned an icebox? Zachary: Yeah that\u2019s for after the Family Blessings - after we've used the Likenesses. Dr Bufirst: I don't follow. How do you - ? Zachary: Easiest if I show you. Zachary stands up and starts to unbutton his shirt. Zachary: We all have the Likenesses in our homes. They watch over you in the kitchen, in the car, in the shower. Sometimes though that isn't practical. Can\u2019t go swimming with a Likeness (laughs). This way the Cherished Leaders are always with you, always. Damn buttons. Zachary fumbles with shirt and exposes torso, chest, shoulder and upper arms. Dr Bufirst: You look normal enough. Zachary: Yeah. I have to want you to see or you won't. After Recognition Day, you can see - you can recognise other Associates everywhere - you see it all over them - it's like we're taking over. You starting to see? Looks beautiful on the kids. You remember \u201dBrand Loyalty?\u201d Well this bit's \u201cBrand awareness.\u201d Emphasis on brand. Silence for seven seconds. Dr Bufirst: Jesus God.",

Dr Bufirst: You've had quite the adventure. So what exactly is \"Learning Camp V-SC LC-B7-M49-T957-H777\" ? Zachary: It's a prison factory. A massive prison factory. Dr Bufirst: Housing who? Zachary: Everybody. Every thing . Dead Associates making Likenesses forever. That's where we all go. I saw a girl - I didn't know her, she said her name was [REDACTED]. She said she knew me. I'd never set eyes on her before. She'd been there all her life. Her and her children. Begged me to help them.. She said, \" All life is the same. \" Dr Bufirst: Meaning? Zachary: I saw pigs there. Pigs with iron burns all over their bodies, trying to make the Likenesses with their trotters. Fumbling, dropping them. Shitting themselves in fear. Christ. Dr Bufirst: Anything else? Zachary: I don't know how to say this\u2026 Do you recall Recognition Day? The talk Janey Goodwill gave about family? Dr Bufirst: \u201cYou and your descendant/ascendant genetic material contemporaries will be forever bonded with the PryMaid family.\u201d Zachary: (nods) They gave me the phone to show you \" the future that already exists. \" They told me to say, \" You, your wife and unborn twins say hi. \" At this point Dr Bufirst removes the phone from its portable unit, reviews its contents and becomes distressed. He is unable to continue and the interview is terminated accordingly. Zachary is still in containment and still regularly requests an SCP-4694-L instance to perform the Family Blessings."
