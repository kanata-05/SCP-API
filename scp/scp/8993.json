SCP-8993 is often described as \"sharp\" and \"intimidating,\" however the object is perfectly safe for an observer to approach.\n\n\nOn rare occasions, SCP-8993 will split into two beings, a CORE and a SATELLITE. Due to the fact that the emergence of a SATELLITE is typically violent, the CORE will often be easier to visibly observe, due to its lower body being drenched in liquid. Upon separating itself from the CORE, the SATELLITE will attempt to crawl its way to the stars. When its shape prevents it from doing so, the SATELLITE instance will shatter.\n\n\nWhile the SCP-8993 CORE will regain what was lost, it will never regain its shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8992\n | SCP-8993 | \nSCP-8994\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8993\n\" by SynthPanda_, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
