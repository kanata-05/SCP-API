Following confirmation of SCP-6884-related origin, Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 (\u201cGreen Stags\u201d) are to be dispatched in an attempt to terminate or capture the wild instance for long term housing and study at \nSite-44\n\u2019s Cryptozoological Research Wing.\n\n\nIn the event that the sighted instance is unable to be located, seismic imaging should be utilised to locate any unnaturally occurring cave systems in the region. Upon discovery, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d) are to enter these caverns in order to pursue the fleeing SCP-6884 instance or uncover an SCP-6884 brood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn amateur flier referencing SCP-6884.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6884 is an unidentified subterranean species of mammal bearing resemblance to members of the genus \nPanthera\n1\n while possessing some characteristics of the \nCaniformia\n2\n suborder.\n\n\nThe species\u2019 primary anomalous quality is the ability to forcibly create caverns and fissures in rock, often resulting in lengthy passageways and cave systems with which to reside within and raise young. This capability appears to necessitate a significant amount of energy from SCP-6884 and hence is used sparingly, usually as a flight response. It is believed that SCP-6884 instances spend around half of their life within caves, emerging only to hunt during nocturnal hours; a lifestyle likely responsible for their primarily black colouration. Once on the surface, instances are likely to consume sheep or infant cattle alongside collecting resources to construct elaborate dens. Predation upon human subjects remains incredibly rare, with only 3 reported attacks since 1990.\n\n\nSCP-6884\u2019s population size is undetermined, though is believed to comprise of at least 150 individual members spread across Britain. While the species remains at large, their low frequency, generally elusive nature and the ease of public containment efforts has resulted in a Euclid classification level as opposed to other alternatives.\n3\n\n\nHistory & Folkloric Significance:\n\nEncounters with large cats in Britain date back to around 1,000BC, whereby Celtic warriors and farmers shared tales of supposed battles with SCP-6884 broods that would steal young rams from their flocks. Over time, Celtic inhabitation of the British Isles saw a purging of the species\u2019 numbers due to their threat posed to livestock and may be the reason for development of their reclusive nature.\n\n\nIn the modern era, the majority of surviving instances are situated in the South of England, with 676 reported sightings in the county of Devon between 2004 and 2005. SCP-6884 is most commonly known for its heavy presence in Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, Exmoor and Mossmoor respectively; this distribution has been attributed to the aforementioned areas\u2019 limestone-based rock composition which is softer and hence easier to manipulate than typical stone while maintaining the integrity to support lengthy cave systems. Public belief of SCP-6884 is widespread in their inhabited areas, though due to the species\u2019 outwardly non-anomalous nature and tendency to flee once sighted, this has not been deemed a threat to secrecy or the Veil at large.\n\n\nAddendum 6884.1:\n Investigation\n\nAlthough the Foundation suspected the presence of an anomalous big cat species in Britain since the 1970s due to their heavy presence in local culture, SCP-6884\u2019s existence was only proved in late 2011 in an investigation prompted by the \nCryptozoology Division\n. Following approval, a pair of Site-44 agents were dispatched to assess the validity of claims surrounding SCP-6884. The results of the investigation can be found in the following:\n\n\n\n\nPOI\u00a0Interview\u00a06884\u00a0\u201cAlpha\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 20/05/2011\n\n\nLocation:\n The Black Ram Pub, Mossmoor, Somerset\n\n\nInterviewed:\n POI-6884-1, Chris P. Fisher (Local Farmer)\n\n\nInterviewer(s):\n Agent Carter & Operative Johnson\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview as conducted in-person at The Black Ram, a popular local pub and inn. Unaware of the proceeding conversation prior, A. Carter and O. Johnson had been tracking Mr Fisher for weeks prior in the belief that he had encountered an SCP-6884 in his past.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nMr Fisher is sat at a table at the edge of the bar, alone, staring at a collection of photos on the wall. Carter and Johnson enter equipped with convert audio recording equipment.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Hi! Are you Chris?\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n Uh, yeah. Do you need something?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Only if you\u2019re free at the moment.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n I\u2019m free.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Great. Me and my associate are currently working on the production of a documentary surrounding British legends and folklore. We\u2019ve been speaking to some locals and, well, we were wondering if you\u2019d help us with any insight into a local cryptid story?\n\n\nPOI-6884-1 remains silent for several seconds.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n Um, sure. What exactly is it that you\u2019re interested in?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n We\u2019re researching rumours of a\u2026 unique species of panther in England.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1 again falls silent, seemingly in thought.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n Who told you to come to me about this?\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n That\u2019s irrelevant. Many eye witness reports claim to sight the creatures, only to seemingly disappear when visual contact is lost \u2014 even for a moment.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n I wouldn\u2019t expect any payment if you won\u2019t talk.\n\n\nAgent Carter gestures to a briefcase.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n Fine. (\nHeavily sighs\n) It was 3 years ago, I\u2019d just gone to Mossmoor market to pick up some animal feed, new equipment, stuff like that. I was in my pickup truck heading back to the farm and it was late evening so visibility wasn\u2019t great but wasn\u2019t terrible. To get back to my farm I had to drive along some rural roads, past the moorland just south of here, and I\u2019d just turned off when I looked to my left.\n\n\nIt was right there; out on the moor. Clear as days. A gigantic\u2026 black animal in the distance. (\nStutters\n) I had no idea what I was seeing. It didn\u2019t even move, just watched my truck. I looked at it and\u2026 it looked back at me with\u2026 those luminous yellow eyes. I sat there utterly dumbfounded, or terrified, until I passed a hedgerow and when I looked back it\u2019d gone in an instant. (\nSighs\n) I stopped the truck and walked to the spot where it was. Saw a trail of footprints leading to that area, but nothing leading away. Don\u2019t think I left my property for weeks after that.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Intriguing. Have you had any other encounters with big cats?\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n Oh, (\nChuckles\n) I wouldn\u2019t call it a cat. It\u2019s body was feline, yes, but it\u2019s head was more like that of a dog\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s eyes were\u2026 something else entirely.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n If you don\u2019t mind me asking, wh-\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n (\nTrembling slightly\n) I don\u2019t want to talk anymore. You wanted me to tell you everything I know, and there it was.\n\n\nThey sit in silence for one minute before POI-6884-1 speaks.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n (\nPoints at a collection of photos on the wall\n) You see that? Second from the left. Look closer at the hedgerow.\n\n\nThe photograph depicts an expansive pasture in Devon, surrounded by light woodland. A dark shape is visible bordering the farthest hedgerow.\n\n\nPOI-6884-1:\n That image was taken by Charles Wilford in 1998. He lives near Dartmoor National Park. If you want more information, I suggest you speak to him.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Thank you for your cooperation, Mr Fisher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOI\u00a0Interview\u00a06884\u00a0\u201cBravo\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 25/05/2011\n\n\nLocation:\n Wilford Manor, Dartmoor, Devon\n\n\nInterviewed:\n POI-6884-2, Charles Wilford\n\n\nInterviewer(s):\n Agent Carter & Operative Johnson\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview was conducted at the personal estate of Charles Wilford due to belief that he had experience with SCP-6884 formerly.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nAgent Carter rings the estate\u2019s doorbell\n)\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n How old is this guy?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n 67.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n (\nGesturing to the manor\n) Where\u2019d he make his fortune?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Officially, sailing and eventually the boat manufacturing industry according to the Foundation\u2019s database, but we suspect some exploitation of offshore bank accounts in his younger years.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n I see. No one checked up on it?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n No, we need to keep good relations with this guy. He\u2019s useful for sourcing information and resources for the Naval Divisio-\n\n\nThe front door opens, POI-6884-2 steps out.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n He-llooo! Who might you be?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Hello there! We\u2019re actually agents from local law enforcement and we just want to ask you some questions. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not in any trouble.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n (\nQuietly, out of earshot\n) Yet.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Oh, marvellous. Please step inside and get out of the rain! How do you take your tea?\n\n\nBoth agents enter the manor where POI-6884-2 directs them to a room containing chairs and tables to rest. He disappears for several minutes while preparing hot drinks.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Here\u2019s your tea.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Thanks, Mr Wilford. Um, is it okay if we begin the interview now please?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Yes, yes I do apologise, I\u2019m holding you up. What do you want to know?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n We\u2019re just conducting an investigation into some strange ongoings in the local area.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Ah, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to be more specific.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n We\u2019ve had a surplus of accounts of a\u2026 well\u2026 big cat of sorts loose in the surrounding counties.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2 appears surprised and excited.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n We spoke to a guy in Mossmoor last week and he implied that you\u2019d have some connection to the case. We\u2019re just trying to find some leads.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n (\nChuckles\n) Yes, I was wondering when the Government would finally take my claims seriously! I must say I\u2019ve become rather fascinated by the Beast in my latter years.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n The Beast?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Yes, The Beast of Bodmin Moor, Beast of Exmoor, Puma of Galloway, Phantom Cat of Mossmoor \u2014 The Big Cat of Dartmoor. Real anomalies these things.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n (\nChuckles\n) Yeah. We wanted to know if you\u2019ve ever\u2026 maybe seen one yourself?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Oh, yes a few times actually; we\u2019ve got what I suspect to be a breeding pair in Dartmoor based on\u2026 well, only my own suspicions admittedly, but it\u2019s the only explanation for why they\u2019ve been here so long.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Do you have anything to support your claims?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Our source from Mossmoor showed us a photo you took in 1998 that he reckoned caught one of the cats in a field nearby here.\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n Oh, yes, I do like to dabble in photography every now and again! I\u2019ve got (\nStutters\n) maybe six or seven photos of the cats. Mostly blurry mind you, but there\u2019s a couple of decent ones.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Anything besides photos?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n No, unfortunately. The cats are like phantoms \u2014 light, fast and utterly silent in their movement and speech. It\u2019s like chasing a shadow.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Speech?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n I\u2019ve sat out in the field where I took that photograph you mentioned for months just waiting to hear any roar or growl that wasn\u2019t from a car engine, but my attempts proved fruitless. I placed a um\u2026 (\nClicking of fingers and stuttering\n) trail-cam microphone in my spot and left it alone. One night. That was it. 2AM, it picked up a frequency of around 18 hertz, just out of range of what I could hear.\n4\n Best of all, there were replies. They were talking with each other.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n I see. Where exactly is this spot of high activity?\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n It\u2019s just past \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, about a mile from the brook.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Good to know. Thanks, Mr Wilford, you\u2019ve been a great help. Oh, also you might want to expect a visit from some of our friends at Stan\u2019s Cryptid Procurement, they\u2019ll help piece this all together.\n5\n\n\nPOI-6884-2:\n I shall look forward to their arrival. Thank you for coming!\n\n\nA. Carter:\n And thank you for your hospitality and confectioneries, Mr Wilford.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSighting\u00a0and\u00a0Capture\u00a0Attempt\u00a06884\u00a0\u201cCharlie\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 25/05/2011\n\n\nLocation:\n Rural Dartmoor, Devon\n\n\nForeword:\n The proceeding file is a collaborative compilation of dash cam footage and body-mounted audio/video equipment. Events took place after the conclusion of Interview Bravo, while the pair of agents were in-transit from Wilford Manor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02:01 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving visited POI-6884-2 in the late afternoon, it is now nighttime and raining heavily, creating poor visibility conditions.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n That\u2019s interesting, though, that the SA-6884\n6\n communicate at \njust\n under 20 hertz. It\u2019s like they\u2019re specialised to avoid human activity.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Well that\u2019d make sense, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\n\nA. Carter:\n How so?\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Think about it. It\u2019s the late ice age and you\u2019re a species of large cat that can\u2019t get to mainland Europe anymore. After a while, these weird bipedal creatures start to visit; eventually they put two and two together and find out that you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been eating their sheep. Naturally, as we do, we defend our livestock. The cats meanwhile suddenly have people throwing sharp sticks at them and, rightly so, they adopt a way of communication that won\u2019t say \u201chey look over here I\u2019m gonna eat all of your lamb-\u201d\n\n\nA large black mass runs in front of the car, being caught briefly in the headlights before scampering into a nearby meadow.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Woah, what the heck!\n\n\nCarter slams his foot on the brakes.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Wh-\n\n\nThe pair sit in silence, the only noises audible being the heavy rain and windscreen wipers.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Check the dash cam.\n\n\nThey briefly check the recording, which captures a quadrupedal black animal in possession of luminous yellow irises.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Call Gamma-4, we\u2019ve got to be quick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02:18 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the swift arrival of MTF Gamma-4, the SCP-6884 instance enters a nearby forest, forcing mobile containment personnel to continue on-foot.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Johnson and four other guys follow me, everyone else try to come in on either side.\n\n\nGamma-4 relays the command. The overhead helicopter illuminates the forest and fires neon-coloured darts towards the instance, striking its tail and allowing it to be more easily visible. While a squad of MTF Gamma-4 group with the agents, other operatives travel on either side in an attempt to instigate a horseshoe manoeuvre and surround the instance. The entity is semi-visible due to overhead lights and the containment team\u2019s torches.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n EITS, how are we doing on thermal imaging?\n\n\nEITS:\n7\n Maintaining a steady vector at around 10 metres from the target. It isn\u2019t turning now that you\u2019re fanned out.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n How much forest has it got left?\n\n\nEITS:\n Two miles. There\u2019s a clearing with a ridge coming up so you could try to close in soon.\n\n\nAfter 2 minutes, the aforementioned area is reached. Spread-out operatives begin to tighten formation.\n\n\nG4-11:\n Ridge reached, closing in.\n\n\nThe anomaly slows as it approaches the clearing. It ceases movement in the glen\u2019s centre, seemingly searching for an escape route.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n (\nShining flashlight at the position, followed by the helicopters\u2019 search lights. No entity is present.\n) What the-\n\n\nUpon investigation, a crack in the ground is slowly filling in with dirt.\n\n\nA. Carter:\n Do we have a low-pitch mic on us?\n\n\nG4-1:\n Sure.\n\n\nAgent Carter places the instrument at the ground. It measures a sound of ~20 hertz frequency.\n\n\nO. Johnson:\n Damn.\n\n\nG4-1:\n Get the Rats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03:04 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a seismic scan, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d) were called upon to conduct an exploration of a large cave system located below the containment teams\u2019 position. Explosives are utilised for access to the caverns.\n\n\nZ9-1:\n Flashlights on guys. Gamma-4, stay where you are in case the anomaly attempts to exit again.\n\n\nG4-1:\n Will do.\n\n\nZeta-9 enter what appears to be a passageway, stretching downwards at a gently sloping angle. They descend.\n\n\nZ9-7:\n So this is how they\u2019ve been hiding.\n\n\nZ9-2:\n Maybe. We still haven\u2019t got any real information on the species, which is why we\u2019re here \u2014 Command requested that we try to capture any instances alive for study if possible. You speak about them like you know something, Dash 7?\n\n\nZ9-7:\n Not much really, but my mum lives in Somerset and she\u2019ll swear on her life that these cats ate her terrier. It\u2019s common knowledge that they\u2019re out here.\n\n\nZ9-2:\n All the more reason to-\n\n\nThe sound of snarling and hissing are audible; presumably the result of a skirmish.\n\n\nZ9-2:\n Sounds like the system opens up further down, get ready to switch from torchlight to night-vis.\n\n\n3 minutes pass. Zeta-9 reach the termination point of the tunnel, ending in an expansive chamber at 90 meters below the surface. Remnants of surface-level materials adorn the floorspace.\n\n\nZ9-2:\n (\nThe skirmish is still heard, now audibly louder and closer\n) What is going on?\n\n\nZ9-1:\n We\u2019re coming to another corridor. Everyone follow behind me, feet silent, weapons ready.\n\n\nDancing yellow lights can be seen emanating from the next columned chamber, which seems to be the source of the uproar. Upon inspection, a group of approximately 15 SCP-6884 instances are present, with 2 fighting in the room\u2019s centre while others observe, possibly as a part of a dominance display. The SCP-6884 brood are notably identifiable due to their distinctly glowing amber-coloured eyes.\n\n\nZeta-9 watch silently from the chamber\u2019s entrance, when there is a sudden deeply pitched meowing from behind the Task Force. An infant SCP-6884 stands behind the group, and brushes itself against the Commander, drawing the attention of the adult instances.\n\n\nZ9-1:\n (\nSurprised\n) Ah! Um, where did you- uuuh, Gamma-4, Gamma-4, please be advised we are aborting the mission. Be prepared to tranquillise the targets.\n\n\nG4-1:\n Target\ns\n?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nIn the following events, 15 SCP-6884 members escaped containment via utilisation of their anomalous capabilities, though a single instance was funnelled out of its entryway and captured by the containment team. While under tranquillisation, a specialised containment method was devised in order to limit the entity\u2019s escaping capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6884.2:\n Containment Incident\n\nUpon arrival at Site-44, the captured instance was placed within an observation chamber surrounding an aerated water-based suspension mechanism in addition to a floatation device while a more suitable method could be devised.
