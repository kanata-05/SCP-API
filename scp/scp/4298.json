Only level 2 or higher foundation staff are allowed to enter SCP-4298-A when it is active, if given permission by the Project Director Dr. Romagnoli.\n\nNo experiments are to be taken place without the supervision of the Project Director, Researcher Luciana Amati or Field Researcher Dr. Robin Texas Walker.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4298-A is the former door and doorframe of containment cell #546 in Containment sector-87\n1\n of Site-446 located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Italy. The containment cell was used for what was formerly cataloged as SCP-4298, a Type-Green entity, neutralized after the 04/02/19\u2588\u2588 breach via two gunshots to the cranium and declassified on 17/06/19\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-4298's effect occurs between 3:32 and 3:33 PM, wherein it will unlock and open automatically.\n\nAttempts were made to keep SCP-4298 closed for one day without human interaction, resulting in total failure. Subjects cannot enter the door through the side facing the interior, instead, encountering a smooth, black wall of unknown material that prevents entry and observation into SCP-4298.\n\nAn event can be stopped by closing the door and locking, or automatically when it is 3:33 PM local time. Autonomous drones are reported to stop working when nearby SCP-4298-A, but audio and camera equipment mounted on experimental subjects can pass through unaffected.\n\n\nWhen entered through the side facing chamber exit, the subject (referred hereby on as SCP-4298-B) will observe an exact duplicate of Site-446, identical in details, of the 04/02/19\u2588\u2588 breach, including Foundation personnel (SCP-4298-C). All copies of personnel within SCP-4298-C will perceive the subject as the former SCP-4298 upon entrance. This will incite the staff to attack SCP-4298-B, although the subject displays resistance to this damage. During the time spent in SCP-4298-C, the subject will always kill five researchers and three security guards, in addition to injuring eight more security guards and destroying the site's cafeteria. These incidents occur either out of self-defense\n2\n or through unintentional means, recreating the casualties, damages and events of the 04/02/19\u2588\u2588 breach.\n3\n\n\n45 minutes after the beginning of the event, SCP-4298-D, recognized as a replica of then Senior Security Officer Attila Szab\u00f3, will appear and shoot SCP-4298-B in the head twice, effectively \"neutralizing\" SCP-4298-B. No recorded case has ever outlasted the 45-minute limit, either dying preemptively or being caught by SCP-4298-D before the time limit.\n\nAfter being incapacitated within SCP-4298, SCP-4298-B will step out of SCP-4298-A, with one of the three events occurring:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4298-B will have no recollection of the event. However, SCP-4298-B will report the sensation of being hunted or followed, lasting from 30 minutes to ten days.\n\n\nSCP-4298-B will retain all the memories and details of the event, including the layout of Site-446, faces of personnel, and actions taken during the event.\n\n\nSCP-4298-B will exhibit memories, personality traits, or abilities from SCP-4298-N, in which case the subject is to be terminated unless testing is permitted.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4298 was discovered 5 years after the breach after Dr. Annabella Milani was reported missing at 3:33 PM on date 17/04/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Dr. Milani was reported to enter cell #546 to retrieve an object she had left there and was reported found at 4:18 PM outside cell #546, shaking in fear and paranoia, with difficulties in describing what happened. Interview logs with Dr. Milani initially suggested that SCP-4298 was the entire containment cell.\n\nThe cell was cataloged as the anomaly until further testing concluded that the cell's door and door frame to be the cause of the anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum-4298-1:\n On 26/03/20\u2588\u2588, knocks were heard from behind SCP-4298-A, along with a voice, asking in Italian \"Is anybody there?\". Is uncertain how the door was capable of emitting sounds of its own, as is not attached to any room. Object upgraded to Euclid Class in case a specimen of SCP-4298-C somehow breaches containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4298-N\n\n\nLevel 3/4298\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nSafe\n Neutralized\n\n\nDeclassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage of Site-446 Cafeteria's kitchen by the breach.\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-4298 has been considered neutralized after the 04/02/19\u2588\u2588 containment breach. SCP-4298 is henceforth referred to as \"SCP-4296-N\".\n\nThe document is set to be decommissioned on date 17/06/19\u2588\u2588 by order of the O5 council. Former containment procedures of SCP-4298-N are listed below.\n\n\n\n\nFormer\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0prior\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a004/02/19\u2588\u2588\u00a0breach\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-4298, special containment procedures are not needed. However, for safety precautions, at least two (2) Senior Security officers are to be located nearby cell #546 in Containment Sector-87 of Site-446, place where SCP-4298 is reported to be located. If any change happens to SCP-4298, it must be reported to Project Director Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to discuss further containment procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4298-N was a 1.87 meter tall humanoid, androgynous figure with reality-bending abilities.\n4\n Much of what the Foundation knew about SCP-4298-N prior to the 04/02/19\u2588\u2588 breach was lost due to a fire created during SCP-4298-N's rampage. The majority of this document was compiled from recovered fragments of the document, eyewitness accounts, and expeditions into the current SCP-4298 and research into the alternate dimension's documentation of the entity. All of the information from the current SCP-4298 appears to not contradict the recovered information the Foundation has compiled so far.\n\n\nThought to be what was inside Security Cell #546, SCP-4298 appears to have features similar to [REDACTED], is capable of complex speech mimicry to the point of mimicking existing Foundation personnel's voice, has limited chronal and spatial abilities\n5\n, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and, although being relatively physically human, has an enhanced resistance to blunt damage in all areas of the body except the cranium, which is abnormally soft, and often compared to the fontanels of an infant's skull.\n\nSCP-4298-N has been shown to exhibit extremely high intelligence, charisma, and very high hostility towards Foundation personnel.\n\n\nTermination:\n SCP-4298-N was terminated by Senior Security Officer Attila Szab\u00f3 at 4:18 PM local time after a containment breach which lasted forty-five minutes and killed eight personnel, including Junior Researchers Killian Havendoll and Carolina Manini, Senior Researcher Pietro Gabbani, Researcher Assistant Yves LeBlanc-Gandolfi, Medical Researcher Dr. Annalisa Fiammini, and Senior Officers Anthony Ermani, Adamo Mastrosimone, and Daniele Celauro.\n\n\n\n\nFormer\u00a0description\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-4298\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4298 is an unspecified entity of unknown origins or containment procedures history that is located in Standard Humanoid Security Cell #546 in Containment Sector-87 of Site-446.\n\nSCP-4298 has been described to be an unspecified entity by thermal scanners, even if mounted video surveillance tools inside the cell haven\u2019t been able to confirm the nature of the entity due to an internal malfunction. Attempts have been made to enter the cell, repair and retrieve the video surveillance equipment, encountering failure in the process of opening the door of the cell itself.\n\nSCP-4298 has been noted to produce multiple human noises such as speech in the English language, suggesting the subject or the subjects inside are humans or humanoid in nature. Voices do appear to be identical to the one of Assistant Researcher Dr. Romagnoli, Assistant Researcher Luciana Amati and an unidentified voice referred by the two other voices as Field Researcher Dr. Robin Texas Walker, all talking about opening the door of cell #546, despite attempts were done to open the door containing the entities.\n\nSCP-4298, due to the nature of the entity being unknown and the cell being unable to be opened, even for basic maintenance, cannot be given essential human treatment such as food or water.\n\nSo far, no requests have been reported from the entity, besides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log\u00a04298-4-6\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 4298-4-6\n\n\nInterviewed\n: Dr. Romagnoli\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Williams\n\n\nNotes: Assistant Researcher Dr. Romagnoli\u2019s voice has been heard being produced by SCP-4298 while in containment, and has been a witness during SCP-4298\u2019s containment breach, being one of the survivors after SCP-4298 destroyed Site-466\u2019s cafeteria. The interview is translated from Italian.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n Please, identify yourself for the sake of this interview, and state the current date.\n\n\nDr. Romagnoli:\n My name\u2019s Dr. M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Romagnoli, and I am an Assistant Researcher of Site-446. Today's date is June 4th, 19\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n Dr. Romagnoli, do you have any clue why SCP-4298 was imitating your voice as well as Dr. Amati\u2019s voice? Have you been around cell #546 before the containment breach?\n\n\nDr. Romagnoli:\n I honestly have no clue, nor any idea why SCP-4298 was imitating my voice, as I have never been in Containment Sector-87. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I are assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which is in Research Sector-21, pretty far from Containment Sector-87. I wasn\u2019t even aware of the existence of SCP-4298 until the breach happened. I cannot even answer why, by what you tell, that thing was mimicking Dr. Amati's voice, I barely know that doctor.\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n SCP-4298 was conversing alone calling another voice Dr. Robin Texas Walker. Do you have any relation with such person the entity was claiming to speak to?\n\n\nDr. Romagnoli:\n I haven\u2019t heard of anyone named that in my entire life. As I stated, I haven\u2019t been to Containment Sector-87, nor I ever was near cell #546. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 always told me not to go to Containment Sector-87 alone, as it is not fit for new assistant researchers and Dr.[REDACTED] never went there.\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n Is it true that you were in the cafeteria when the breach happened? What were you doing in the cafeteria? What do you remember about SCP-4298?\n\n\nDr. Romagnoli:\n Well, I was taking a break along with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as it was my birthday. Dr. Gandolfi was with me when that\u2026 thing entered the cafeteria. And I remember its look. How angry it looked, and was trying to say something, but all I understood were words like \u201cstop shooting me\u201d in an angry manner to the nearby Security Guard\u2026 I saw that thing just [DATA EXPUNGED] to Dr. Gandolfi. It was gruesome. I saw my friend Yves get eviscerated in front of me with my very eyes. I was hiding, but I saw him and the still-living Dr. Gandolfi both become immobilized. It was like Dr. Gandolfi saw a ghost, and the same feeling would have been what that thing experienced, seeing as both were immobile for a few seconds. After killing him, that thing moved away, I do not know where. Seeing the body of my closest friend lying on the ground, with his head detached from the rest of the body, in a burned, devastated cafeteria place where your birthday was happening, placed upon the table where I was sitting along with him was\u2026 I do not know how to describe it. Terrible? I have no idea.\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n Do you remember how SCP-4298 looked like?\n\n\nDr. Romagnoli:\n I do. I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Dr. Milani, and its voice was in between a male one and a female one, even if very monotone. I cannot exactly remember its features correctly, but I can definitely say it was a-\n\n\n[DATA CORRUPTED]\n\n\nDr. Williams:\n Thanks for your collaboration, and my condolences towards Dr. Leblanc-Gandolfi.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
