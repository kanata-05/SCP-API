SCP-6599 are present across 68% of all websites that allow for account creation, though activity is centered on hobbyist message boards, with the oldest recorded instance dated to 1999. SCP-6599 accounts are somewhat knowledgeable about the topic of the website they are posting to, as well as extremely active, posting upwards of 100 times a day across all accounts in the form of responses to other users. Accounts have been observed to post contemporaneously with one another, though typing pattern analysis, coupled with SCP-6599's anomalous effects, indicates that the likelihood of SCP-6599 being multiple individuals or an organized effort is remarkably low.\n\n\nSCP-6599 accounts are English-speaking, and communicate in a hostile, argumentative pattern consistent across all instances, insulting users and making boastful statements about themselves. This behavior often prompts action by site moderators, who will most likely implement a ban on the account. To date, there have been no recorded instances of an SCP-6599 account attempting to circumvent a ban.\n\n\nIf an individual engages an SCP-6599 account in a combative way, such as insulting the instance or provoking a response from SCP-6599, an ALT-F4 Event is likely to occur. These events result in a hostile entity, designated SCP-6599-1, manifesting near the individual's present location a short time after the argument. Analysis of SCP-6599 activity has determined only 40% of engagements result in the appearance of SCP-6599-1.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 is a humanoid entity resembling professional wrestler Scott Rechsteiner\n1\n. SCP-6599-1 is sapient, sentient, with an estimated intelligence similar to that of an average adult human, and anomalously enhanced strength and durability. After manifesting, SCP-6599-1 will locate the individual it had engaged in an argument with online, and proceed to verbally berate and physically batter them to the point of hospitalization. SCP-6599-1 will then demanifest from its target's location. While no fatalities have resulted from an ALT-F4 event, SCP-6599-1 frequently causes damage to the surrounding area during its assault.\n\n\nAddendum.6599.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-6599 was discovered on March 28th, 2008 on Parawatch.net.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregTheCarp\n 03/28/2008 (Mon) 16:54:32 #74439151\n\n\n\n\nFavorite Cryptid thread?\n\n\nBig fan of the Squonk personally. It's a little pig-looking thing from Pennsylvania that cries because it's so ugly. People track it by looking for a path covered in tear stains. When people find it dissolves itself by crying.\n\n\nWonder if it's saying something that I like it\u2026\n\n\nWhatever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOGSLICE\n 03/28/2008 (Mon) 17:08:43 #19288745\n\n\n\n\nWHAT KIND OF BETA MALE PUSSY SHIT IS THAT?????

A police report that was filed by Kaplin described a humanoid entity that appeared, attacked him, and disappeared from his home. WALDO.aic's anomaly detection software was triggered and then prompted Foundation investigation. Following confiscation of relevant materials, discussions on how best to contain SCP-6599 were held at Secure Facility Area-179.\n\n\nAddendum.6599.2:\n Notable Examples\n\n\nNotable examples of SCP-6599 behavior have been catalogued below.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2010/12/12\n\n\nWebsite:\n \nMuppet Central\n - A forum dedicated to discussion of Jim Henson's \nThe Muppets\n and associated works.\n\n\nDescription:\n Incident occurred in a thread posted by user 'Thog_Life'.

An acquaintance of mine has located the singing ship from the \u201cIn The Navy\u201d sketch. Owner is a relative of a former Henson prop engineer, and is debating either auctioning it off, or donating the item to an archive of Muppet memorabilia.\n\n\nImage album here.\n\n\nWhat say you, Muppet Central? Any takers?\n\n\n\n\nReply | Share | 19 Replies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOGSLICE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, NO ONE WANTS THIS SHIT, CANDYASS.

OR PUT MY FIST UP YOUR ASS LIKE A REAL MAN AND ADMIT YOU USE PUPPETS.\n\n\n-HOGSLICE\n\n\nSENT FROM MY IPHONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath:\n Thread developed into an argument between SCP-6599 and other Muppet Central users concerning the purpose, popularity, and production of \nThe Muppet Show\n that lasted for 7 pages of posts before disciplinary action was taken by a moderator.\n\n\nHours following the ban, Georgia resident Jamal White, operator of the 'Thog_Life' account, reported SCP-6599-1 entering his residence via detaching the front door with its hands. Entity brandished a banjo and delivered a rendition of \"Rainbow Connection\" with lyrics lampooning Henson and the Muppets, while assaulting White with the object to the point of unconsciousness. An excerpt of these lyrics, which SCP-6599-1 repeated unceasingly throughout the incident, have been transcribed from a recording of the assault and included below.\n\n\n\n\nSOMEDAY I'LL FIND IT\n\n\nA REASON TO GIVE A SHIT\n\n\nABOUT HENSON, THE MUPPETS\n\n\nAND YOU\n\n\n\n\nUpon SCP-6599-1's exit, White's wife filed a police report and admitted him to the hospital, where he was treated for blunt trauma, a fractured carpus, and internal bleeding in the brain. Following treatment, standard Veil retention protocol was enacted, and amnestics were administered to the White household.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2011/4/28\n\n\nWebsite:\n \nMoneyBeetle\n - A Japanese message board for insect fighting enthusiasts to congregate, bet on competitions, and discuss the sport. The website had recently come under scrutiny from law enforcement after the murder of a hobbyist following a dispute over winnings from a tournament.\n\n\nDescription:\n Incident occurred in a thread posted by user 'PrizeCricket'. Exchange has been transcribed below. Messages have been translated from Japanese, with the exception of posts made by SCP-6599.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrizeCricket\n \n5h\n\n\nMEGATHREAD: DISTRICT 11 COMPETITION\n\nI'd like to thank everyone for participating in the District-11 semi-final competition yesterday!

That's a great beetle, but we have a specific thread for showing off our prized pets. This is a commemoration for a tournament, which you did not participate in. Besides, this is not an English-speaking forum. Please use a translation service, they are incredibly easy to use and we would love to talk with you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOGSLICE\n \n4h\n\nMOTHERFUCKER YOU ARE MAKING ME BREAK MY SHIT\n\n\n\u2014HOGSLICE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath:\n Thread was then flagged by Foundation .AICs and removed from public view. Nakatosa resident Seo Hirotada reported SCP-6599-1 entering his residence via emerging from underneath the floorboards, despite the home being built on flat ground. Entity assaulted Hirotada with punching gloves, repeatedly asking if the victim had ever seen \"Rocky\". When the victim fell to the floor, SCP-6599-1 unlocked multiple cages containing exotic insects, and poured them atop Hirotada's body. SCP-6599-1 leapt in the air, and drove its elbow into his chest. SCP-6599-1 demanifested, and Seo contacted law enforcement and was later admitted to a hospital with a shattered rib cage. Standard Foundation Veil retention protocol followed.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6599.3:\n Containment Log\n\n\nFollowing a period of data collection related to SCP-6599, attempts to contain the anomaly were authorized by Area-179's Containment Authority under the direction of Researcher Coates. Attempts are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. Subdue SCP-6599-1 with tranquilizer darts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6599 account engaged on a forum related to scrimshaw. SCP-6599-1 manifested, battered its way into Area-179's Testing Chamber \u03b1-4 and immediately attacked D-662833. Tranquilizer darts were unable to penetrate SCP-6599-1's skin and effectively sedate it. D-662833 survived with a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, and a broken tibia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. Test Chamber \u03b1-5 will be refitted with conductive flooring and wall panels. These will be electrified until SCP-6599-1 is subdued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6599 account engaged on a board related to square dancing. The door to Test Chamber \u03b1-5 was left open and a path was cleared. Upon SCP-6599-1 entering, the chamber was electrified; this was ineffective, as SCP-6599-1 was able to withstand the voltage, remarking that the feeling was \"weak as shit\". D-109682 was grabbed by SCP-6599-1 and thrown at the opposite wall, electrocuting them. D-110465 suffered 3rd degree burns on 60% of his dermis and two broken arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Containment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. With approval from O5-5, Agent Woodcock, wielding \nSCP-5175\n, will then be implanted into Test Chamber \u03b1-6 to confront SCP-6599-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident-6599-029. See Addendum.6599.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6599.4:\n Incident-6599-029\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel Dossier - Agent Woodcock and SCP-5175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Woodcock, performing a parlor trick with SCP-5175\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5175\n is an ornate Moroccan knife harboring an incorporeal entity, designated SCP-5175-1, which claims to be the spirit of a Japanese samurai named Kuroitanken Hanzo. When wielded by its host, Agent Woodcock, SCP-5175 is capable of removing any form of life from baseline reality upon laceration. Due to a specific set of circumstances related in the crosslinked file, SCP-5175-1, and by extension SCP-5175, is intrinsically linked to Agent Woodcock, and the two share a connection that would lead to Woodcock's employment with the Foundation.\n\n\nAgent Damien Lawrence Woodcock, Captain of Mobile Task Force \u03a9-5 \"Damien's Angels\", is stationed at Area-179 for the purposes of wielding SCP-5175, as the object has proven successful in the neutralization of dangerous anomalies. While Woodcock has demonstrated immaturity and character unbecoming of a Foundation Agent, most likely attributed to his unconventional background, his effectiveness in various neutralization, decommissioning, and tactical efforts has proven him a valuable asset to the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 appears outside Test Chamber \u03b1-6 and punches through the plexiglass viewing area, shattering the plastic. The entity climbs into the chamber through the window. The interior lights have been turned off.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n WHO THE FUCK TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS? I DON\u2019T LIKE THE DARK UNLESS I\u2019M HAVING SEX, WHICH I\u2019M NOT, SO TURN THE LIGHTS ON.\n2\n\n\nAgent Woodcock, who is levitating via the use of SCP-5175-1, kicks SCP-6599-1 in the stomach before darting back into the shadows. SCP-6599-1 groans, then frantically looks around the chamber, attempting to find the source of the blow.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n HEY, WHAT THE HELL? WHY DON\u2019T YOU COME OUT AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN? PISS CLOWN. SCUM FISH.\n\n\nThe lights flicker, and eventually stabilize\u2014 revealing Agent Woodcock, crouching against a corner of the chamber and holding SCP-5175 outward in a defensive position. SCP-5175-1 hovers above him. Woodcock wears a modified SICA\n3\n suit, which is capable of enhancing his performance on the field.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n Holy shit! Scott Steiner! That\u2019s so badass! Do the math promo!\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n SHOULDN'T YOU BE MANAGING A GAMESTOP, VIRGIN?\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n Is that a\u2014 Whoa! That\u2019s a skull tattoo, the one on your bicep. I have one just like it, but with more flames and there\u2019s also a snake coming out of the eyes. There\u2019s a banner underneath it that says \u201cNo Gods, No Ma-\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 sprints towards Woodcock, lining itself up for a spear tackle.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock slides under the entity's legs. SCP-6599-1 attempts to tackle SCP-5175-1 instead, but phases through the specter, colliding with the wall.\n\n\nWoodcock reorients himself towards SCP-6599-1, readying SCP-5175, and leaps at the entity. SCP-6599-1 quickly turns, catching Woodcock midair over his shoulder, before slamming the agent into the floor, cracking the linoleum.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n SHUT THE FUCK UP.\n\n\nWoodcock spits out a wad of blood.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n Finally, a worthy opponent! Control, play my music!\n4\n\n\nWoodcock\u2019s armor begins blaring the song \u201c96 Quite Bitter Beings\u201d by music collective CKY. Woodcock demonstrates approval at the song, squealing in glee.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n Hanzo, it's time for our training to pay off. Prepare to be vanquished by DEATH KNIFE, bitch!\n\n\nSCP-5175-1 appears above Woodcock. It then flies towards SCP-6599-1, who once again attempts unsuccessfully to punch the entity. While SCP-6599-1 is distracted, Woodcock unholsters shurikens from his armor and slings them at SCP-6599-1. The entity quickly punches through a wall, ripping out a large chunk of concrete, and uses it as a makeshift shield.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 launches the concrete at Woodcock. Before it makes contact, SCP-5175-1 appears in front of the agent and diverts the rock to a wall. SCP-6599-1 grabs Woodcock by the throat, throwing him into the air, then grabbing his legs and slamming the agent into the ground, shattering the tile.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 does not release his grip and instead tosses the agent into the air again by his legs. As Agent Woodcock begins to plummet, SCP-6599-1 cocks his fist and connects with the agent's chest, sending him soaring into the opposite wall.\n\n\nSCP-5175-1 manifests under Agent Woodcock, orienting the agent to allow him to spring from the wall. Woodcock flies over SCP-6599-1, who attempts unsuccessfully to grab the agent midair, and bounces again off another wall and onto SCP-6599-1's back. SCP-5175-1 punches at SCP-6599-1's legs, attempting to take it off balance.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 begins to thrash as Woodcock's grip tightens. Woodcock is unable to stab SCP-6599-1, as his knife hand is firmly in the grip of SCP-6599-1. SCP-6599-1 runs backward into a wall, jumping and slamming Woodcock into the concrete, who finally releases his grip.\n\n\nWoodcock lands on his feet, and surveys the chamber as SCP-6599-1 appears to be catching his breath.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n You\u2019re pretty good!\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n NOT SO BAD YOURSELF, DIPSHIT.\n\n\nThe two run at each other. Woodcock tosses SCP-5175 into the air, catching it and stabbing at SCP-6599-1, who dodges each attempt. All attempts to punch Woodcock made by SCP-6599-1 are deflected by SCP-5175.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING\u2014\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n JoJo reference?!? He\u2019s kind of like a stand actually if you th\u2014\n\n\nSCP-6599-1\n I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. HE\u2019S A SKELETON THOUGH, THAT\u2019S FUCKING COOL, BROTHER.\n\n\nSCP-5175-1 grabs SCP-6599-1 and throws it to the ground.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n You had enough yet?\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n ME? I\u2019M JUST GETTING STARTED.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n You ever dance with the devil in the, uh, under the, in the moon?\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n THE JOKER SAID THAT. I FUCKING LOVE THE JOKER. HELL YEAH, BRO.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 leaps to its feet and readjusts its sunglasses, which are now visibly cracked. The entity charges forward, but Woodcock counters with a punch from SCP-5175-1, who now stands in front of the Agent. The two exchange blows for a period of time, fighting to a stalemate.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n I\u2019m thinking of getting a portrait of the Joker on my thigh.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n THAT\u2019D BE SICK. WAIT, I\u2019M FIGHTING YOU. STOP DISTRACTING ME.\n\n\nSCP-6599-1 goes to punch Agent Woodcock, but is once again deflected by SCP-5175-1. Angered, SCP-6599-1 begins to target SCP-5175-1, as Agent Woodcock slides under the entity's legs and towards the chuck of concrete left on the floor.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n \nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto.\n\n\nWoodcock runs at the concrete, using it as a springboard. He leaps towards a wall, bounding off of it towards SCP-6599-1, driving the blade into SCP-6599-1\u2019s back and pulling the knife out. SCP-6599-1 falls to a knee.\n\n\nAgent Woodcock:\n \nTsuki no ringo dakedenaku, meiyo o motte korosu. Watashi no petto o say\u014dnara.\n5\n\n\nSCP-6599-1:\n GODDAMNIT.

However, SCP-6599 accounts resumed activity the following day, though a number of changes in posting behavior were noted. SCP-6599 began writing opening posts instead of responses, seemingly inviting communication from others. Secondly, SCP-6599 accounts began posting exclusively on websites related to psychology, therapy, anger management, self-improvement, and life advice at a rate less frequent than its previous activity levels. Below is an abridged list of examples.\n\n\n\n\nWebsite:\n \nFlowersGalore\n - A website dedicated to advice and do-it-yourself \"life hacks\" regarding personal gardens.\n\n\n\n\nFLOWERS GALORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOGSLICE\n \n08/23/2020\n\nHELLO DOUCHEBAGS.\n\n\nSOME ASSHOLE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO TOUCH GRASS AND WHEN I DID I REALLY LIKED IT.

DOES THE GRASS LIKE BEING CUT OR IS IT A BITCH?\n\n\nI WANT TO HAVE THE MOST GODDAMN GRASS THIS SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. HOW MUCH GRASS IS THAT. I ALSO WANT ENOUGH TO SHOVE UP THAT FUCKER WHO TOLD ME TO TOUCH GRASS'S ASS\n\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU\n\n\n-HOGSLICE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite:\n r/selfimprovement - A subreddit dedicated to self-improvement and helping others in the community grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT I LIKE TO DO\n\n\nsubmitted 7 months ago by\n \nHOGSLICE\n\n\n191 comments\n \nshare\n \nsave\n \nhide\n \ngive gold\n \nreport\n \ncrosspost\n\n\nWHEN I GET MAD SOMETIMES I GO OUTSIDE AND PRETEND I'M A CHUCKHOG.

On 2012/6/11, all SCP-6599 accounts ceased activity, and went offline.

        "Addendum.6599.1: Discovery\nSCP-6599 was discovered on March 28th, 2008 on Parawatch.net.\nThe operator of the 'GregtheCarp' account, Oregon resident Gregory Kaplin, was discovered later the same day with a fractured skull, two broken femurs, and a shattered humerus. A police report that was filed by Kaplin described a humanoid entity that appeared, attacked him, and disappeared from his home. WALDO.aic's anomaly detection software was triggered and then prompted Foundation investigation. Following confiscation of relevant materials, discussions on how best to contain SCP-6599 were held at Secure Facility Area-179.",
