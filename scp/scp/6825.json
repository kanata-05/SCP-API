Foundation Site-92 has been constructed around SCP-6825 for this exact purpose. Until it can be further understood, the primary objective for this site and SCP-6825 containment vector is the decommisioning of SCP-6825.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6825 is a large, biomechanical device currently located in Greenland.\n\n\nUpon each dawn,\n1\n SCP-6825 initiates the emission of a substantial energy beam directed towards the sun, measured to be several meters in length, and visible from dozens of kilometers away. Subsequent to this discharge, an indistinct source produces an audible howling sound.\n\n\nLocated several kilometers below SCP-6825 is a large mass of flesh, with texture similar to candle wax, designated as SCP-6825-1. The full mass of SCP-6825-1 has not been measured, although it is believed to stretch several miles into the earth. Notably, SCP-6825-1 exhibits signs of sapience, albeit its mode of communication is limited to agonized groans and gurgles.\n\n\nSCP-6825 is composed of three primary components: SCP-6825-A, SCP-6825-B, and SCP-6825-C.\n\n\nSCP-6825-A represents the principal surface structure of SCP-6825 and bears a resemblance, albeit vague, to a cannon, featuring multiple components orbiting its central shaft. SCP-6825-A possesses the capability for full 360\u00b0 rotation.\n\n\nSCP-6825-B refers to a substantial reservoir that serves as a direct energy conduit to SCP-6825-A. The contents of this vat consist of an unidentified substance derived from SCP-6825-1, often displaying observable handprints on the interior of its glass enclosure. SCP-6825-B is directly below SCP-6825-A, several meters underground.\n\n\nSCP-6825-C encompasses an extensive network of tubing and conduits responsible for the extraction of an unknown liquid from SCP-6825-1. This process induces a state of dormancy and silence in the corresponding section of SCP-6825-1. Approximately 86% of SCP-6825-1 remains in this dormant state.\n\n\nBased on radiocarbon analysis, both SCP-6825-1 and SCP-6825 are thousands of years old, with the former predating the latter.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Several months following the initial containment of SCP-6825, it exhibited an instance of coherent communication, contrasted with its past sounds of pained moaning.\n\n\n\n\nBEGIN LOG.\n\n\n\n\n[The sound of creaking machinery is heard, followed by a soft humming. The recording starts mid-conversation.]\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n \u2026sacrifice of souls, offered to \nSOL.\n A macabre dance of light and death beneath the eternal gaze of the sun.\n\n\nUnknown Voice 2:\n What have we wrought? The fires that cleanse are the same that consume.\n\n\n[There is a pause, and the humming grows louder.]\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n Yet it is our only hope. A union of metal and spirit, crafted to discipline the sun's furious light.\n\n\nUnknown Voice 2:\n And when the stars align, it shall release its sorrowful gift, bathing the earth in the tears of those who rest below.\n\n\n[The humming intensifies.]\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n It is both our salvation and our doom. To appease \nSOL\n, we offer lives extinguished but never forgotten, those torn asunder by its wrath in a forgone era.\n\n\nUnknown Voice 2:\n The light\u2026 it shall carry their essence. The souls, bound within the luminous flow.\n\n\n[A distant rumbling can be heard. SCP-6825 fires a beam into the sun.]\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n As the celestial dance reaches its crescendo, it shall stretch its fingers toward the heavens, beseeching for her forgiveness.\n\n\nUnknown Voice 2:\n And the heavens shall answer, without unknown radiance and tendrils of unrelenting illumination.\n\n\n[The rumbling grows louder, punctuated by the whirring of gears.]\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n Pray that this contraption of our design, this fusion of man and machine, will continue to hinder her endless wrath for this home.\n\n\nBoth voices:\n For in this unholy alliance, we find both our deliverance and our damnation.\n\n\n[The rumbling reaches a deafening crescendo, and the recording abruptly ends. The sound of the machine's mechanisms can still be heard faintly, gradually fading away.]\n\n\nEND LOG.\n\n\n\n\nRecently, SCP-6825 have been firing even without access to the sun, often multiple times each day.\n\n\nThe precise function and purpose of SCP-6825 remain undetermined.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\n\nDon't \nyou remember?\n \nDo you want to be\n with us, love?\n\n\nThank you for \nletting us reunite\n with \nhum\nani\nty\n\n\nI'll \nshow you what\n they don't \nwa\nnt to see.\n\n\nEven your \nguardians\n relish the \nlight's touch.\n\n\nit hindered us for \ntoo long\n\n\nthe cruel thing was\n \njust to stop you \nfrom reach\ning peace\n\n\ncome.\n\n\nthe ancient\n ones have finally fallen. \nyou're unsh\n ackled and f\nree to \nenter the\n \nlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0addendum?\n\n\n\n\nWelcome,\u00a0O5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEGIN LOG.\n\n\n\n\nUnknown Voice 1:\n The gears faltered, the binding broke.
