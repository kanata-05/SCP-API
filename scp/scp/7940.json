Due to its low potential for disruption and record of loyalty to the Foundation, it is allowed to freely leave its containment cell to access common areas of Site-403 and areas relevant to its position as Senior Researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7940 refers to Senior Researcher Ryan Tegen, a 30-year-old humanoid male. Its anomalous effect occurs when it attempts to bring its hand 45 centimeters above its head. This will cause an invisible ceiling to manifest above SCP-7940's hand. This ceiling will block the upward movement of SCP-7940 and inanimate objects it is holding, but is completely intangible to other living beings.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7940 was discovered on 2/16/2023 when it reported its anomalous properties to its supervisor. It claimed that these abilities might have existed intermittently throughout its life but only became permanent recently. SCP-7940 believed that its diary entries reveal a reason as to its manifestation of anomalous properties. Relevant entries are shown below, with surrounding entries included for context.\n\n\n\n\nDay 1:\n First day at the Foundation. I can\u2019t say I was expecting to be hired by the shadow government straight out of college, but it pays better than any other job. I don\u2019t know anything about these \u201canomalies\u201d, but the trainers are saying I\u2019m picking up the science very quickly. I'm excited to start real work here!\n\n\nDay 3:\n I finished their basic \u201cWhat Is An Anomaly?\u201d training course and they\u2019re having me help out with tests. Honestly, I have no clue what I\u2019m doing. College prepared me for real stuff, not a flower that blooms when you speak purple around it. How the hell does that even work? Well, I guess this is real stuff. The point is, I was doing tests like they asked me to, but I don\u2019t understand what the tests are actually doing. Hopefully it will make sense soon, but I\u2019m not sure if it ever will.\n\n\nDay 4:\n Not the best day today. One of the tests went wrong because I mixed up the equipment. The senior researchers didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell they weren\u2019t happy. Right after that, when I was putting the test materials away in the high cabinets, I think I bumped my hand on something and dropped a bunch of glassware. If they weren\u2019t disappointed earlier, they certainly are now.\n\n\nDay 5:\n They said they weren\u2019t mad and it's expected for my first week, but that doesn\u2019t change much. I\u2019m not picking this up as fast as I normally pick things up. There\u2019s still a huge wall between me and competence.\n\n\nDay 6:\n I bumped my hand when putting equipment away again, dropping all the test tubes I was holding. I really need to be more careful. I didn\u2019t even see what I hit. What if they decide I\u2019m too clumsy for this job? I can\u2019t do this.\n\n\nDay 8:\n They said I\u2019m doing good work. They\u2019re just being nice though. I understand what these tests are measuring for, but I don't understand anything about \nwhy\n they are designed this way.\n\n\nDay 20:\n I think I\u2019m starting to get the hang of this. It feels like I managed to get through something holding me back. I\u2019m able to help out the other new junior researchers who are struggling on testing their assigned anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 180:\n The senior researchers assigned me to design a test procedure for an anomaly myself. How the hell do they expect me to do this? I\u2019m not there yet; I still need to improve before I know how to design a test myself. I just know the basics of testing procedures. I\u2019ll do my best, but I\u2019m probably not going to do very well.\n\n\nDay 185:\n I hit my hand on the ceiling earlier and bruised it. Stupid low ceilings. And something\u2019s not right with the test. The Hume readings should not be fluctuating this much around the anomaly. The fluctuations don't seem to be affecting it though. Is there something wrong with the test? I\u2019ll need to recheck the design.\n\n\nDay 186:\n I rechecked the test design and I can\u2019t find anything wrong. Did I double check it right? Is it something wrong with me? Fuck, I could get fired. Why couldn\u2019t I get it right the first time?\n\n\nDay 188:\n I hit my hand on something when doing the tests again, and I\u2019m not even sure what it was this time. I was just climbing the ladder to get to the test aperture, and I hit something where I bruised it. I almost fell down the ladder. Fortunately I was able to finish the test, but things are still looking grim though. The test still has major Hume fluctuations. I\u2019m not going to be able to complete this, am I?\n\n\nDay 189:\n Another obstacle is gone. It turns out there was a malfunction in the reality anchor, which caused the Hume fluctuation. The senior researchers said the test I designed was fine, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still room for improvement. There always is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 806:\n They promoted me to senior researcher and assigned me my own anomaly to study. I should be glad, but I\u2019m not qualified for this. I\u2019ve only been here around two years so far. I told the other senior researchers I wasn\u2019t ready, but they insisted that I\u2019m the right person for the job. Let\u2019s hope I don\u2019t mess this up too badly.\n\n\nDay 808:\n I\u2019ve assigned some of the junior researchers to various tests on the anomaly. One of the tests was to see the chemical output\u2019s reaction to iron, but the researcher grabbed the aluminum instead. Not a huge mistake, but it cost us an hour or two to reset the test. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do it right tomorrow though.\n\n\nDay 813:\n The tests are going slowly. It\u2019s not the fault of the junior researchers; I just designed the tests they\u2019re doing inefficiently. We need to finish up these research tasks so the containment specialists can get the right conprocs out.\n\n\nDay 815:\n I tried to change a lightbulb today, but something was preventing me from reaching the outlet. I\u2019ll figure it out and tell someone later though. This damn anomaly takes priority. It\u2019s just not doing what it's expected to, and it\u2019s my fault and I need to focus on it.\n\n\nDay 825:\n Why did they make me senior researcher on this project? I'm just a failure. I need to do better on this project but there\u2019s something about me that I just can't change. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s something anomalous preventing me from changing the light bulb. I have too many things to worry about.\n\n\nDay 830:\n There\u2019s been a breakthrough, and we are finally making progress. I\u2019m going to host a congratulatory party for Bob, Jane, and Sally; they did excellent work on the tests.\n\n\nDay 840:\n We finally got our research to a point that the higher ups consider satisfactory. They said it was completed significantly faster than was expected, but I think that\u2019s bullshit. It could have been done better. At the very least, I learned something from the experience, and I\u2019ll be able to do better next time.\n\n\nAlso, I finally changed that light bulb. I\u2019m not sure what was preventing me from doing it, but it seems to be gone now. I logged it as a minor extranormal event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2054:\n Over the past few years, it\u2019s become clear to me I have some sort of anomalous property. I\u2019m going to report it, but my supervisors will probably remove me from my position since I\u2019m an anomaly. And honestly? I think it\u2019s for the best.\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned at this job, it\u2019s that I\u2019ll never be \ngood\n at it. Or at least, I\u2019ll never be as good as I want to be. Have I improved since I first came here? Yes, certainly. But it\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m still fucking up. I\u2019m still making stupid mistakes. This stuff can get people killed if I keep like this. If they decide I stay as a researcher, I need to improve. I need to get past whatever\u2019s stopping me.\n\n\nMaybe one day I\u2019ll reach those heights I never could.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is believed SCP-7940\u2019s anomalous effects became permanent shortly after the final entry was written. Due to SCP-7940\u2019s record of high quality work, it was considered that strict containment procedures would only serve as a detriment to Foundation operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7939\n | SCP-7940 | \nSCP-7941\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7940\n\" by ParallelPotatoes, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
