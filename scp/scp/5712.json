Any significant nomenclative divergence in word association games played by SCP-5712-A is to be reported to the item's acting Lead Researcher, currently Dr. Alistair Dankworth.\n\n\nPersonnel monitoring games played by instances of SCP-5712-A are to regularly undergo psychological evaluation. Assigned personnel are to be amnesticized immediately should they display any of the following:\n\n\n\n\nInability to recall the rules of word association games played by SCP-5712-A\n\n\nSymptoms typical of exposure to anti-ideatic anomalies\n\n\nKnowledge regarding GoI-005 (\"\nFifth\nism\")\n\n\n\n\nShould SCP-5712-A cease transmitting new words for any reason, including winning or losing its word association game, SCP-5712 is to be reclassified as neutralized.\n\n\nShould SCP-5712-A begin displaying concepts associated with the Foundation, SCP-5712-B is to be exorcised by an ordained Catholic priest and completely submerged in sulfuric acid until dissolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-5712 is a metastatic meme complex\n4\n currently occupying the linguistic aspect of the noosphere. SCP-5712 develops through the subsumption of English lexemes humanly associated with concepts already appended to its ideatic mass. The process by which SCP-5712 associates concepts can be controlled through interactions with SCP-5712-A in the form of word association games.\n\n\nSCP-5712-A is the Foundation supercomputer \nPeirce\n, constructed in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for the purpose of analyzing ideatic and conceptual anomalies within the noosphere. SCP-5712-A's anomalous properties demanifested following the disappearance of SCP-5712-B (See \nAddendum V\n).\n\n\nSCP-5712-B is an experimental thaumaturgical component infused with the Tartarean entity commonly referred to as Belial (TE-0068). SCP-5712-B formerly manifested within SCP-5712-A due to thaumaturgic processes conducted by Dr. Nadia Amari.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum I:\n\n\nProject Belial\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt of the project proposal for Project BELIAL, a collaborative effort by several independent Foundation departments to construct SCP-5712-B by infusing Tartarean entity TE-0068 into a thaumaturgical processor compatible with Foundation supercomputer \nPeirce\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Project\u00a0Proposal\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccult Studies Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject BELIAL\n\n\nDr. Alistair Dankworth, Dr. Nadia Amari, et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sigil of TE-0068 utilized in invocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nFoundation supercomputer \nPeirce\n has proven itself to be incredibly effective at exploring the noosphere. However, \nPeirce\n's usefulness is significantly limited due to its inability to identify antimemes, which are inherently incompatible with human consciousness and only exist within the larger infosphere. Through the application of a thaumaturgical component infused with TE-0068, \nPeirce\n's reception can exceed the entirety of human perception, enabling it to percieve antimemetic anomalies in the infosphere.\n\n\nUtilization:\n\nThe BELIAL component is in essence an amplifying component for \nPeirce\n. The actual development involves complex thaumaturgical procedures, including the binding of the massive Type I Tartarean entity TE-0068. The aforementioned entity was selected due to its affinity for ideatic manipulation, which is attributed to a direct connection to the infosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Project\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio/Visual Transcript\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-63\n\n\nInvolved:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Nadia Amari\n\n\nDr. Alistair Dankworth\n\n\nTE-0068\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nAmari is kneeling before a large sigil drawn on the floor in chalk.

SCP-5712 (which \nmay or may not be the only one of its kind\n) appears to be a predatory meme that devours other concepts. What actually occurs to its prey is uncertain, but in all known cases thus far, subsumed concepts effectively develop antimemetic properties and are either erased or replaced within the noosphere. I suspect they are absorbed into the mass of SCP-5712.\n\n\nThe infosphere is a hostile environment that we feeble humans should never have sought out. But only now can we see through an open window, and the waters of this ocean of ideas are flooding our submarine. \u2014 Dr. Alistair Dankworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum III:\n\n\nTransmission Log\n\n\nFollowing Incident 5712-001, a complete diagnostic of the \nPeirce\n systems recovered no malfunctions, excluding the BELIAL component, which, while still emitting noticeable levels of Tartarean Resonance Energy, no longer contained TE-0068.

The best we can do right now is try to slow it down, and even then, its complete subsumption of all concepts is inevitable. The fact of the matter is, we are fighting a losing battle; Murasaki.aic has already had to resort to several high-risk, compromising maneuvers to limit the transmission of SCP-5712.\n\n\nFurthermore, the effects of \nevery\n transmission of SCP-5712, whether beneficial in the long term or not, has to be dealt with by the Disinformation Bureau. During my inquiry with the regional Disinformation Bureau liaison, Xavier Solera, he sent me the following list of recent Disinformation Bureau operations regarding SCP-5712:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficially renaming the Arab Republic of \nEgypt\n\n\nReplacing all copyright records of \njelly\n with \npreserve\n\n\nUnofficially aiding multiple billion-dollar restaurant franchises in rebranding their primary product, the \nhamburger\n\n\nRedefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with \naxis\n\n\nRedefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with \nprojection\n\n\nDeveloping an alternative American history without the existence of Abraham \nLincoln\n\n\nAdministering mnestics to all Foundation personnel to ever have worked on GoI-005 (\"\nFifth\nism\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the impacts of SCP-5712 correspond with that of an uncontained anomaly, and as of writing, no effective containment procedures have been developed. As such, I am officially requesting a Keter-classification for SCP-5712 with a strong recommendation for decommissioning if at all possible. I've already submitted my official proposal to the Decommissioning Department.\n\n\nJacqueline Sydney\n\n\nClassification Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Decommissioning\u00a0Proposal\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecommissioning Proposal Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5712\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nThaumiel\n Redesignation Pending\n\n\nHead Researcher:\n Dr. Alistair Dankworth\n\n\nSupporting Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Nadia Amari representing Occult Studies Division\n\n\nJacqueline Sydney representing Classification Committee\n\n\nXavier Solera representing Disinformation Bureau\n\n\n\n\nPlease check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:\n\n\u2611 Excessive Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n\n\u2610 Excessive Danger\n\n\u2610 Expense\n\n\u2610 Ethical Concern\n\n\u2610 Legal Concern\n\n\u2610 Potential to Decommission Apollyon-Class Object\n\n\u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s)):\n\n\u2611 Other (please state): Invasive anomaly under TYR Protocol\n6\n and theoretically uncontainable without neutralization.\n\n\nSummary:\n Containment of SCP-5712 is unsustainable. Assuming continuation of current containment procedures, Murasaki.aic estimates that SCP-5712 will subsume 100% of the noosphere within 12 years, resulting in unknown and likely undesirable memetic effects. Furthermore, SCP-5712 has already demonstrated considerable likelihood in resulting in a Lifted Veil scenario due to difficulty of proliferating disinformation regarding SCP-5712. Lastly, SCP-5712 has been officially designated an invasive anomaly, technically justifying neutralization under TYR Protocol. All things considered, it is in the best interests of the Foundation to decommission SCP-5712.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum V:\n\n\nDecommissioning Log\n\n\nFollowing approval of the decommissioning proposal for SCP-5712, Dr. Nadia Amari developed a procedure based on the Principles of Tartarean Infusion to dispel TE-0068 from \nPeirce\n and potentially sever SCP-5712's connection to the noosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Decommissioning\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio/Visual Transcript\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-63\n\n\nInvolved:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Nadia Amari\n\n\nDr. Alistair Dankworth\n\n\nTE-0068\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAmari:\n I'm still don't see how exorcising TE-0068 will solve this whole issue.\n\n\nDankworth:\n Because that's SCP-5712's only access into the noosphere.

Often referred to as \"ideatic cancer\", metastatic meme complexes are essentially overgrown predatory ideas.

Eventually, a metastatic meme will consist mostly of absorbed concepts, to the point where the original meme is unidentifiable. It is at this point that it is considered a complex. (Calloway, A.

        "SCP-5712-A is the Foundation supercomputer Peirce , constructed in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for the purpose of analyzing ideatic and conceptual anomalies within the noosphere. SCP-5712-A's anomalous properties demanifested following the disappearance of SCP-5712-B (See Addendum V ).\nSCP-5712-B is an experimental thaumaturgical component infused with the Tartarean entity commonly referred to as Belial (TE-0068). SCP-5712-B formerly manifested within SCP-5712-A due to thaumaturgic processes conducted by Dr. Nadia Amari.",
        "Addendum I: Project Belial\nThe following is an excerpt of the project proposal for Project BELIAL, a collaborative effort by several independent Foundation departments to construct SCP-5712-B by infusing Tartarean entity TE-0068 into a thaumaturgical processor compatible with Foundation supercomputer Peirce .",
        "Addendum II: Incident 5712-001\nFollowing the addition of SCP-5712-B and several updates and reconfigurations, Foundation supercomputer Peirce successfully permeated the infosphere; however, this resulted in the appension of Peirce into the greater SCP-5712.",
        "Addendum III: Transmission Log\nFollowing Incident 5712-001, a complete diagnostic of the Peirce systems recovered no malfunctions, excluding the BELIAL component, which, while still emitting noticeable levels of Tartarean Resonance Energy, no longer contained TE-0068. Analysis of the ideatic composition of TE-0068 revealed that TE-0068 as a concept had been subsumed by SCP-5712.",
        "Addendum IV: Impact Analysis and Decommissioning Proposal\nThe following impact analysis report was compiled after Incident 5712-001 for redesignation purposes as per Classification Committee protocol.",
        "Addendum V: Decommissioning Log\nFollowing approval of the decommissioning proposal for SCP-5712, Dr. Nadia Amari developed a procedure based on the Principles of Tartarean Infusion to dispel TE-0068 from Peirce and potentially sever SCP-5712's connection to the noosphere.\nFollowing this, SCP-5712's designation has been officially upgraded to Keter. A contingent of Foundation semioticians and linguists have been organized and officially established as STF \u03c3-14 (\"Wordsmiths\") to deter the development of SCP-5712 through the creation of superfluous lexemes for feeding purposes.\nAlthough Foundation supercomputer Peirce no longer displays any anomalous properties, it is still referred to as SCP-5712-A in relevant documentation for archival purposes.\nAs of writing, neither SCP-5712-B nor Dr. Nadia Amari have been recovered."
