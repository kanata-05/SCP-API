Due to the current shortage of viable personnel within our organization, The Department of Analytics has been tasked with identifying civilians to facilitate ongoing containment of SCP-7676. Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\") is responsible for the procurement of these civilians. All conscripts are to be granted Level-5/7676 clearance for the duration of their tenure.\n\n\nDue to the virulence of SCP-7676 and its related phenomena, contact between Zulu-9 and the outside world is to be mediated through Artificially Intelligent Constructs. The delivery of requested materials, as well as general resource replenishment, must remain fully automated.\n\n\nWaste materials from Zulu-9 will periodically arrive at Site-19 within black body bags. Personnel at Site-19 are to make no attempts to identify their contents, and are not permitted to interact with them beyond facilitating their incineration.\n\n\nNull Engram Disqualifiers:\n The following is a list of attributes which disqualify a candidate for Null-Engram status:\n\n\n\n\nFormer participation in after-school clubs or extra-curricular activities, including as an organizer or educator.\n\n\nFormer inclusion in any concert band, marching band, or any musical ensemble during adolescence.\n\n\nPrior attendance of any form of summer camp.\n\n\nHaving completed an upper-secondary education at an American high school or equivalent institution.\n\n\nAttendance to any Homecoming dance events within such a facility, regardless of context.\n\n\nBeing born or conceived prior to December 31st, 1976.\n\n\n\n\nFurther information is classified 5/7676.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following document contains information and images of a sensitive nature, and may not be safe for viewing.
