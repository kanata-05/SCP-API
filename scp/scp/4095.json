Experimentation further requires written consent by two (2) senior researchers having prior experience with SCP-4095.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4095 is a Valentine's day card measuring 15cm by 10cm when closed and printed on vellum cardstock. The face of the card is primarily sage and depicts a cartoon owl perching on a branch with the text \"Guess \nwhoooo\n<sic> loves you?\" above it. Thousands of cards of this model were printed by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Greeting Card Company in 2002, but only SCP-4095 displays anomalous properties.\n\n\nThe anomalous effects of SCP-4095 are manifested when a human, hereafter SCP-4095-1, opens SCP-4095 to view its contents. For each person, SCP-4095 will contain a different handwritten list of names. SCP-4095-1 will become convinced it is a list of people who love them. In the great majority of cases, SCP-4095-1 is not surprised at the contents of the list as it regularly contains family members and romantic partners. In the remaining cases, SCP-4095-1 will firmly believe one or more names are missing. Because of the subjective nature of love, it cannot be said with certainty whether or not SCP-4095-1 is justified in their belief. \nSCP-4095 does not exhibit any other anomalous properties.\n Research into the extent of the anomalous powers of SCP-4095 is ongoing, and may include decreased mental stability of SCP-4095-1 in the aforementioned cases.\n\n\n\n\n+Log\u00a0of\u00a0Notable\u00a0Experiments\n\n\n\n\n-Log\u00a0of\u00a0Notable\u00a0Experiments\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-A - 1/20/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. DeForest\n\n\nProcedure:\n Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4095 listed Dr. DeForest's family members, wife, and children \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 DeForest, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 DeForest, and \u2588\u2588\u2588 DeForest. SCP-4095 also included Dr. DeForest's own name.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n SCP-4095 recognizes platonic love as well as romantic.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-A1 - 9/2/10\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. DeForest\n\n\nSpecial Note:\n Dr. DeForest's father, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 DeForest, died on 8/15/10, shortly before the test.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4095 contained the same names as in Test 4095-A, with the exception of the name of his father \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 DeForest. Researchers conclude SCP-4095 will not manifest the names of the dead.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-B - 2/1/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Drs. DeForest and Walsh\n\n\nProcedure:\n Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095 and, without closing it, gave it to Dr. Walsh.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4095 only displayed the names as in the test 4095-A, Dr. DeForest's family and wife. Researchers conclude that, while open, the names on SCP-4095 do not change. It is only when closed and reopened does a transformation occur.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-C - 2/15/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nProcedure:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 showed great distress that the list on SCP-4095 did not contain his wife of 16 years. Without being instructed to by researchers, he opened and closed SCP-4095 multiple times rapidly, to see if this issue would be corrected. On 3/3/07, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was apprehended while attempting to expose his wife to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 with intent to kill her, a major breach of Foundation protocol. \nMr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 remains under Foundation psychological evaluation.\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was found to be mentally stable and properly ejected from the Foundation for morally reprehensible behavior. Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was administered Class A amnestic and contains no recollection of the event - the Mr. and Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 divorced on 4/21/07. Evaluation of the lengths of mental instability SCP-4095 can create is underway.\n\n\n\n\nNotice:\n Following the events of Test 4095-C, protocol to gain permission to experiment on SCP-4095 have been tightened. These entail that the only subjects of experiments with SCP-4095 must either be Class D, or have passed extensive psychological evaluation.\n\n\nTest 4095-D - 3/2/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSpecial Note:\n Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is blind.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n The list on SCP-4095 continued to manifest as handwritten pen and not as braille, a behavior exhibited by SCP-1195. Notably, the list contained the name of Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's seeing eye dog, whom she claimed to have a close relationship with.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-E - 3/5/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-2386, convicted of patricide and arson.\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-2386 subject opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n In an extremely unique case, the text within SCP-4095 read \"No One!\". Subject lacrimated profusely and asked to be terminated, a request which was denied. D-2386 later acted in intentionally dangerous and disobedient ways during testing, apparently with intent to terminate himself. He succeeded on 3/12/07.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-F - 4/23/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-1995\n\n\nSpecial note:\n D-1995 was admitted to the Foundation alongside his wife D-1996, both convicted of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-1995 opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4095 contained the names of D-1995's close family, and the name of D-1996.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-F1 - 4/23/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-1995\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-1995 was asked to cross out the name of D-1996 on SCP-4095 with a pen provided by researchers. Afterward, D-1996 was asked about her romantic feelings towards D-1995, who was situated in another room and did not know of the test.\n\n\nResults:\n D-1996 did not claim any change in her emotions towards D-1996. When SCP-4095 was closed and reopened, the marks made inside SCP-4095 by D-1995 did not return.\n\n\n\n\nTest 4095-F2 - 4/24/07\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-1995, D-1996\n\n\nProcedure:\n Over a period of many hours D-1996 was carefully administered Class-E amnestics and implanted with false memories with the intent of causing D-1996 to forget about D-1995. D-1995 was not informed of this procedure. Following this, D-1995 opened SCP-4095.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4095 contained the same names as in Test 4095-F, with the exception of D-1996's name. D-1995 expressed confusion and asked researchers if D-1996 had died. D-1995 also requested a pen to write D-1996's name into SCP-4095: this request was denied. D-1995 made this request repeatedly for 3 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4094\n | SCP-4095 | \nSCP-4096\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4095\n\" by twinb27, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
