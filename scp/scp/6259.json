Captured instances are to be contained in reinforced anomalous containment habitats with a large water basin which is to be cleaned and refilled weekly. Failure to do so may result in the destruction of the containment chamber and possibly the site.\n\n\nNo flammable and/or explosive material is to be allowed within the containment chamber outside of testing purposes. Personnel should wear flameproof and protective clothing when interacting with SCP-6259.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6259 is a species native to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, with small flocks present in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Marshlands of Florida. They are amphibious creatures that are of similar size and shape to a human eyeball with a single orifice where the human pupil would be and a tail resembling the optic nerve to aid in locomotion underwater\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-6259 instances are required to moisturize their outer body, otherwise it will dry and begin to crack after about 3 days. Its anomalous abilities include the ability to levitate through unknown means, and fire concentrated bursts of plasma from its orifice.\n2\n SCP-6259 instances are generally docile creatures and only fire plasma when threatened or as a release of excess material within their body.\n\n\nThe most notable anomalous property of SCP-6259 is a sustained process of nuclear fusion contained within each instance through unknown means without energy exiting the system. This is theorised to be the main source of all other anomalous properties present in SCP-6259 instances. They are able to feed on plasma, ambient heat, and gas to replenish the nuclear fusion reaction after releasing plasma, but given a stable rate of fusion and release of energy from the system, it is calculated to last from 20 to 50x10^3 years.\n\n\nAddendum 6259.1: Attempt at dissection and Incident 6259-A Report:\n\nAfter medical staff restrained and performed the opening incision, the SCP-6259 instance released large amounts of heat and energy in excess of 3 x 10^4\u00a0J. This resulted in the immediate destruction of the western block of the site and the death of 5 on-site personnel.\n\n\n\n\nNote: My heart and blessings go out to the staff lost in this incident. Based on incident 6259-A, breaching the outer shell of SCP-6259 instances is deemed an inefficient method of extracting energy from said instances. Not only due to the safety concerns but the resources needed to harness energy from such an explosive manner would be a waste of Foundation resources. It would be like trying to produce energy from a nuclear bomb rather than a nuclear power plant.\n3\n\nSenior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6259.2: Project \"Eyes on you\" request approval:\n\nResources and funding will be provided for Project \"Eyes on you\" with the goal of finding a renewable energy source through the study of SCP-6259. The prospect of solving the ongoing energy shortage for the Foundation, while being able to breed said energy, showed promise to the O5 Council and was thus approved.\n\nListed below are the project-leading staff.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Benjamin Oach: Project Lead, specialising in Nuclear Physics and Electrical Engineering\n\n\nResearcher Kaci Chong: Asst Project Lead, specialising in Cryptozoology\n\n\nAgent James Taylor: Security IC trained in Animal Handling\n\n\nAddendum.6259.3: Experiment Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nA juvenile instance of SCP-6259 hereby referred to as SCP-6259-1, 16g compressed carbon dioxide gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n16g of carbon dioxide gas released into the chamber by Agent Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNo effect/change in behaviour.\n\nEnergy output: 0\u00a0J\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nWhile SCP-6259 instances were observed to consume swamp gas in the wild, nothing happened in this test. We can conclude that the consumed gas must have some kind of explosive yield.\n\n-Senior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-1, 16g compressed methane gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n16g of methane gas released into the chamber by Agent Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-1 consumed the gas.\n\nEnergy output: 4000\u00a0J for 2 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOur previous hypothesis proved correct. The focus now should be to look for ways to increase the energy yield.\n\n\nI must also comment on Agent Taylor's unprofessional conduct. He had wasted time releasing the gas around SCP-6259-1 to lead it in a circle until he ran out of gas while also calling it a \"good boy\" and has named it \"Billy\". I should emphasise that we are dealing with anomalous \nobjects\n and there's a reason why we use their numerical designation and not give them names. Besides, with research into their reproductive cycle, we should be able to create more instances than we can name.\n\n-Senior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-1, 16g compressed hydrogen gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n16g of hydrogen gas released into the chamber by Agent Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-1 consumed the gas at a slower pace.\n\nEnergy output: 6000\u00a0J for 2 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nDifferent gases do in fact affect the level of energy release. What factors in the gas composition affects the yield is yet to be tested.\n\n\nCuriously, the fact that SCP-6259-1 finished consuming the gas slower could imply that SCP-6259 instances have a preference for gas or a possibly a sense of taste. Tests relating to the level of sentience might be required. Methane gas seems to be its preferred fuel so I believe we should use it as the standard moving forward unless testing the effects of other gases.\n\n-Researcher Chong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-1, 32g compressed methane gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n32g of methane gas released into the chamber by Agent Taylor in intermittent bursts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-1 consumed the gas.\n\nEnergy output: 6000\u00a0J for 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nThe energy released seems to scale proportionally to the amount of gas fed at once. We should calculate the type of progression to see how the amount of gas relates to the energy output.\n\n\nWhile this would be a standard experiment, it was noted that SCP-6259-1 levitated and flew in a circular pattern upon gaining visual contact with Agent Taylor. I am formally requesting behavioral examinations to determine the level of sentience in SCP-6259 instances.\n\n-Researcher Chong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-1, 96g compressed methane gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n96g of methane gas released into the chamber by Agent Taylor in intermittent bursts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-1 consumed the gas.\n\nEnergy output: 18,000\u00a0J lasting 9 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nProgress is going smoothly in regards to the results. However, I am now concerned about the attitude of Agent Taylor as he may have become too attached to SCP-6259-1 and continued to refer to it as \"Billy\".\n\n\nI need not remind my staff that in the Foundation, we encounter many dangerous creatures that we cannot afford to share our sympathies with. If this behaviour continues, it may impede progress or threaten the safety of this project.\n\n-Senior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-1, 160g compressed methane gas canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n160g of methane gas released directly into the pupil of SCP-6259-1 by Agent Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-1 consumed the gas and released a burst of plasma measured before ceasing to levitate and rescussitating after 7 minutes following medical examination.\n\nEnergy output: 32,000\u00a0J for 10 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, this seemed inevitable given that SCP-6259 are biological creatures with limits. Agent Taylor in this test had proven to me that he is incredibly rash and too emotionally attached to SCP-6259-1. He will be relegated to a less proactive role within the project and I am requesting more animal handling staff.\n\n\nLuckily SCP-6259-1 is just one of the 24 instances we currently have in containment with more coming soon. Testing should continue smoothly and the short period of inactivity for the subject should not be of any concern. The minimum recovery of SCP-6259 instances should also be recorded to see if we can re-use them.\n\n-Senior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6259.3: Incident 6259-B Report:\n\nAgent Taylor attempted to access the containment habitat of SCP-6259-1 without permission before it was reported to site security by Researcher Chong. Further review of security footage has revealed that Agent Taylor had been entering the habitat of SCP-6259 regularly with small canisters of methane gas and \u201cfeeding\u201d it to SCP-6259-1. Agent Taylor was charged with unauthorised entry and was suspended for 1 month. Researcher Chong reported that SCP-6259-1 had entered a docile state and had become unresponsive 1 week following Agent Taylor\u2019s suspension and should be excused from testing and kept under observation by Researcher Chong for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nAddendum 6259.4: Experiment Logs cont:\n\nTesting logs involving SCP-6259-2 through 273 expunged for brevity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT 274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nSCP-6259-274, 200g of compressed mixture of \u2588\u2588% Hydrogen Gas, \u2588\u2588% of Hexane and \u2588\u2588% of Nitrous Oxide Mixture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n200g of gas mixture released directly into the pupil of SCP-6259-274 by Handler Schmit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSCP-6259-274 consumed the gas and released a burst of plasma measured before ceasing to levitate and rescussitating after 5 minutes following medical examination.\n\nEnergy output: 50,000\u00a0J for 9 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nAfter rigorous testing, I believe we have done it. This seems to be the optimum output of energy with a mortality rate of only 20%. At the current rate of artificial breeding efforts, we have a potent but sustainable and renewable energy source for the Foundation and possibly the world.\n\n\nThe fact that we are literally harnessing the power of living stars cannot be understated. Most of the high-maintenance projects within the Foundation require so much energy that we have resorted to interdimensional, thaumaturgic and even fictional energy. The project that I have led could leave a massive impact on the Foundation's resources and costs.\n\n-Senior Researcher Oach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6259.5: Incident 6259-C Video Log:\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 04/06/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nNOTE:\n 8 days after Agent Taylor's suspension at 0146 hrs, the automatic containment breach alarm system was activated near the SCP-6259 containment area. The following is a transcript of the Incident 6259-C footage.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n01:45:05:\n Agent Taylor exits his resting quarters and makes his way to the SCP-6259 containment area.\n\n\n01:57:07\n Agent Taylor attempts to use 2 keycards to access the chamber\n4\n but is unsuccessful.\n\n\n01:59:44:\n A red glow is seen from Agent Taylor's left eye followed by a burst of plasma similar to those of SCP-6259. This destroys the locking mechanism for the chamber, allowing him access to the chamber. At this point, the alarm is triggered and site security is alerted to the containment breach.\n\n\n02:00:55:\n Using canisters of methane gas, he lures all the SCP-6259 instances across the hall away from oncoming site security.\n\n\n02:07:38:\n Agent Taylor stops outside Researcher Chong's office where she is waiting outside.\n\n\n02:08:09:\n Agent Taylor fires another burst of plasma at the camera which ends the video feed. From security eyewitnesses, Researcher Chong and Agent Taylor enter the office with all instances of SCP-6259 save for SCP-6259-1 which is still unresponsive in its enclosed observation chamber.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Researcher Chong's office was then breached but site security did not find Agent Taylor, Researcher Chong, or any of the SCP-6259 instances. The post-incident investigation confirmed that a Way within her office was used to escape\n5\n.\n\nUpon further investigation, the creature presumed to be SCP-6259-1 was in fact a non-anomalous human eyeball with DNA testing confirming that it belongs to Agent Taylor. How he had managed to swap out SCP-6259-1 and surgically remove his eyeball is still currently under investigation.\n\n\nIt was revealed during the post-incident investigation, on Researcher Chong\u2019s hard drive that Senior Researcher Oach had omitted most of Chong\u2019s notes and other information that would have indicated a higher level of sapience. It is presumed that he did this to sway the opinion of the Ethics Committee and increase the likelihood of the project\u2019s approval. The results of Senior Researcher Oach\u2019s trial are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. This could imply the existence of fresh liquid water on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
