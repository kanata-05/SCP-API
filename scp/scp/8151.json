She was just another statistic, a face in a sea of dead bodies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+93\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8151\n\n\nObject Class:\n Thaumiel\n1\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Any external manifestations of SCP-8151 are to be recorded and sent to the Temporal Anomalies wing at Site-34. Foundation personnel who witness manifestations of SCP-8151 may \nnot\n, regardless of clearance level, receive amnestic treatment until after the events portrayed either come to pass or are circumvented. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in mandatory amnestic treatment.\n\n\nD-Class assigned to SCP-8151 locations are to be provided adequate provisions as per Document 422341-CA\n2\n. Staff assigned to monitor SCP-8151 locations must be given bi-weekly psychiatric evaluations. Any staff obtaining lower than a 50 on the D\u00fcren-Henderssohn Psychological Stability Scale\n3\n must be reassigned.\n\n\n\n\nThe previous procedure is under review by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nPersonnel assigned to official SCP-8151 locations must comply with all Delphi event regulations, including cooperation with the GOC in disseminating only relevant and necessary information to participating world governments. Due to the often time-restrictive nature of SCP-8151, Foundation emergency response teams are to remain on standby 24 hours a day.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8151 is a standard single-hung 24\" x 36\" domestic window. SCP-8151 can manifest in any enclosed, windowless room up to 15 sq meters in size. It will not manifest in rooms that are not of a standard (rectangular or circular) shape.\n\n\nManifestations of SCP-8151 are labeled as \"Delphi\" events. During Delphi events, SCP-8151 will materialize on a wall within the room, displaying vague, foggy patterns and shapes on the window for approximately five minutes. If a sentient being is not present within that time, the window will de-manifest and the Delphi event will cease. If a sentient being is present, the image outside the window will spontaneously shift to depict a current or near-future tragedy, typically of anomalous origin.\n4\n Depictions are highly detailed and graphic, often involving catastrophic loss of life and/or severe harm to human persons.\n\n\nPrior to 2013, the disasters depicted during Delphi events were determined to be roughly 50% ongoing crises with no possibility for Foundation or GOC intervention that could mitigate damage. The implementation of thaumaturgic spatio-temporal focusing rituals, developed by Dr. Tilda Moose, allowed Foundation thaumaturgists to filter out ongoing disasters and only depict future ones. This also allowed for Foundation thaumaturges to specify certain locations where Delphi events were exponentially more likely to occur. There are currently 18 Sites, with Site-34\u2019s Temporal Anomalies wing being the central location, designated for Delphi events under Foundation control.\n\n\nAddendum 1 - Preliminary Trial of SCP-8151:\n\n\nBefore deployment as a full Thaumiel-Class anomaly, SCP-8151 was set to undergo a series of preliminary testing to determine its efficacy and ease of use. Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were promoted to Senior Researchers and tasked with helping to oversee the trials. They were selected for their naturally very high psychological and cognitive resilience.\n\n\nParameters for testing were selected to show low potential for loss of life with moderate to severe structural and financial damages. Volunteer D-Class were used as subjects for viewing SCP-8151 during Delphi events.\n\n\n\n\nTest 1:\n\n\nEvent:\n Monsoon flooding on Tioman Island, Malaysia\n\n\nExpected Losses:\n 15 dead, 7 missing, $3,000,000 USD\n\n\nResults:\n Island and surrounding areas were evacuated fully, protective seawall and storm borders reinforced. Damages not expected to exceed $100,000 USD.\n\n\nComments:\n\n\nPolletta: Finally some recognition around here. About time we started doing something actually useful.\n\n\nCross: Just hope that this promotion doesn\u2019t lead to all that extra paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 2:\n\n\nEvent:\n Very late season tornado striking Columbia, Missouri, US\n\n\nExpected Losses:\n 3 dead, $500,000 USD, 1 Foundation Auxiliary Site\n\n\nResults:\n Foundation weather drones deployed. Unexpected cold front dispersed before severe weather could form.\n\n\nComments:\n\n\nCross: Huh. Wonder why we don\u2019t do that kind of thing more often. It could certainly help a lot of people.\n\n\nPolletta: Ozzie says the devices are extremely expensive and work in an extremely short range over an extremely short period of time.\n\n\nCross: Well that sounds a bit-\n\n\nPolletta: I swear to God.\n\n\nCross: Can\u2019t I have a little fun every now and then?\n\n\nCross: Ok, fine. You know, if we keep doing this well, maybe the Foundation will start deploying more drones like these. We could really start saving lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 10:\n\n\nEvent:\n Minor eruption of Mauna Kea, Hawaii\n\n\nExpected Losses:\n 9 dead, $10,000,000 USD, 2 Foundation research outposts, 1 GOC base\n\n\nResults:\n Preemptive negotiations with local thaumaturgic flora and fauna resulted in a redirection of lava flow away from settled areas.\n\n\nComments:\n\n\nCross: I think we\u2019re starting to get the hang of this.\n\n\nPolletta: Even the D-Class are getting into it. I heard one of them talking about setting up a schedule so everyone gets a fair share.\n\n\nCross: Was it Attleburgh? D-438249?\n\n\nPolletta: \u2026maybe. Hey, listen, just because he\u2019s weird doesn\u2019t make it invalid!\n\n\nCross: Sure, sure.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a series of successful trials, SCP-8151 was approved for deployment as a Thaumiel-class anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2- Record of Major Delphi Events:\n\n\nFollowing the ratification of the Treaty of Athens, a research hub was established at Site-34. Senior Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were named as Project Co-leads. The following is a record of major disasters predicted by SCP-8151 at Site-34 up to December 31st, 2017. (Note: this list does not encompass every disaster predicted, only those with high potential for loss of life)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription of Event\n\n\nNotes From Project Leads\n\n\nPredicted Losses\n\n\nActual (Estimated) Losses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-21-13; 2 hr prior to event\n\n\nSeveral people are shown being swept away into floodwaters contaminated with heavy and dangerous debris.

No one really ever dies there, it\u2019s just an excuse for the Foundation to hole-punch the hell out of your brain and ship you off somewhere more useful.

I knew pretty much exactly what I would find there. The front door was probably open, but I didn\u2019t feel right just barging in. I had to knock on the side door three times. The first one she probably didn\u2019t hear, the second she probably thought was a hallucination. I didn\u2019t even finish the third before the door opened.\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t really see her well in the dark, but she sounded worse than the last time we\u2019d spoke.\n\n\n\"Can I come in?\"\n\n\n\"What are you, a fuckin\u2018 vampire?\" Her voice curdled in irritation. \"Sorry, sorry. It\u2019s been\u2026\"\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\"Watch out for boxes n\u2018 shit.\"\n\n\nOnce my eyes adjusted, I got a better look at the inside of Meredith\u2018s house. It looked almost identical to mine. The windows had all been taped over, empty pill bottles on the floor. Neither of us left a lot of trash, since we hadn\u2019t had much of an appetite lately, but she had more bottles lying around than I did. She lit another candle, and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the light or if her skin really had become that yellow.\n\n\n\"Well? You\u2019re here for a reason, right?\"\n\n\nI nodded and took a breath. The candles didn\u2019t do much to mask the smell of someone rotting away.\n\n\n\"Council\u2018s voting again.\"\n\n\nShe stared at me with somehow less emotion than she had before.\n\n\n\"That might be the biggest waste of breath you\u2019ve ever used.\"\n\n\n\"I just thought you deserved to know. They might shut it down this time.\"\n\n\nA flicker of rage crossed her eyes.\n\n\n\"So?? What the fuck do I care? Is that gonna fix me? Fix you? Fuck the council.\" She stood up and walked to her kitchen, her back to me. \"Why are you here, David?\" The brief flash of emotion dissipated almost as quick as it had arisen.\n\n\nWhile her back was turned, I pulled a container from my bag and slapped it on the counter.\n\n\n\"If I turn around that better be drugs or a gun.\" She turned. \"Huh, what do you know. It is drugs.\"\n\n\n\"Amnestics.\"\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"You really are fuckin\u2018 stupid.\"\n\n\nHer expression shifted from disdain, to confusion, to intrigue as I pulled out one container after another.\n\n\n\"Where did you get all these?\"\n\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s enough to forget.\"\n\n\n\"Forget what?\"\n\n\n\"Everything. Site-34, the Foundation, everything. We start over, completely. Or it kills us. Either way, we\u2019ll be free.\"\n\n\nI started to divide up the pills. Meredith looked like she was about to cry.\n\n\n\"Really?\" Her voice cracked.\n\n\n\"Wanna find out?

        "Addendum 1 - Preliminary Trial of SCP-8151:\nBefore deployment as a full Thaumiel-Class anomaly, SCP-8151 was set to undergo a series of preliminary testing to determine its efficacy and ease of use. Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were promoted to Senior Researchers and tasked with helping to oversee the trials. They were selected for their naturally very high psychological and cognitive resilience.\nParameters for testing were selected to show low potential for loss of life with moderate to severe structural and financial damages. Volunteer D-Class were used as subjects for viewing SCP-8151 during Delphi events.",
        "Following a series of successful trials, SCP-8151 was approved for deployment as a Thaumiel-class anomaly. Addendum 2- Record of Major Delphi Events:\nFollowing the ratification of the Treaty of Athens, a research hub was established at Site-34. Senior Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were named as Project Co-leads. The following is a record of major disasters predicted by SCP-8151 at Site-34 up to December 31st, 2017. (Note: this list does not encompass every disaster predicted, only those with high potential for loss of life)\nD-14790 received psychiatric treatment and was removed from the project. D-53458 was selected as a replacement. At least 4 research personnel are now required to be directly on-site as mediators and observers during a Delphi event. The Ethics Committee recommends the retirement of SCP-8151 sites. D-H Score: Senior Researcher David Cross: 93 Senior Researcher Meredith Polletta: 95\nD-Class are no longer permitted to view Delphi events. Site staff will now rotate to maintain around-the-clock monitoring of SCP-8151 locations.

He had apparently been watching Delphi events for 17 hours straight. He was given 3 week mandatory leave following this event. Researcher Polletta was directed to take over as Research Lead.\nD-H Score: Senior Researcher Meredith Polletta: 69\nA series of resignations at Site-34's Temporal Anomalies wing led to a large number of entries into the events log to be missed. Senior Researcher David Cross extended his leave for personal reasons. Research Lead Meredith Polletta\u2018s biweekly psychiatric evaluations were rescheduled to weekly.\nLead Research Polletta was reprimanded following this use of SCP-8151 for improper procedures and use of amnestics. She was given the mandatory mnestic treatment and given the clear to return to duty.\nD-H Score: Senior Researcher Meredith Polletta: 57\nThe Ethics Committee has called for an emergency vote by the O5 Council to suspend activity at SCP-8151 locations.\n\nD-H Score: Senior Researcher Meredith Polletta: 17\nResearch Lead Meredith Polletta was found unconscious in her office with several empty liquor bottles. Polletta has been taken off the project and Senior Researcher David Cross has been reinstated as Lead Researcher.\nD-H Score: Senior Researcher David Cross: 0\n12-20-14 My mother died. She was mostly alright, healthy, but got really sick really quickly. I guess that happens when you get older. When I went to visit her, she looked\u2026horrifying. Not at all like the person I knew. Skin stretched taut in some places and sagging limply in others. Sores and splotches and other symptoms of a disease I couldn\u2019t fathom. I thought I should have been repulsed, but I wasn\u2019t because it\u2019s my mother. When she died, everyone was in tears. My sister, my father, my whole family. But I felt no sorrow, no anger. She was just another statistic, a face in a sea of dead bodies.\nThis job is going to kill me.\nThe anomaly isn\u2019t the window or the visions or anything like that. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s become me. How can anyone do this every day and still call themselves human? D-H Score: Senior Researcher David Cross: NULL The Ethics Committee has placed an indefinite stop order on the usage of SCP-8151.
