I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<A long silence. Dr. Mimko retrieves files from under her chair and deposits them onto the table. The files are detailed files on \nDr. Alto Clef\n.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n O5-11 \nwas\n \nSCP-8870\n. Agent Duvall suspected me, \nrest his soul\n, and when O5-11 saw our little struggle, he tried to swat both flies in one go.\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Then he killed himself. Whether voluntary or not, the coroner\u2019s suspect that O5-11 saw his own reflection in the screen he was overwatching us from, and subsequently killed himself.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence. The others shift uncomfortably in their seats.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n So the case is done?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n They\u2019re searching for possible accomplices. But our involvement with the anomaly is long done.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n I can\u2019t believe 11 was 8870. Why?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Well, \n(clears throat)\n I suspect that he saw the division as an opportunity to take down both the Foundation and the Coalition to gain custody of his \ndaughter\n. This seems to be the most likely case at this moment.\n\n\nSCHNEIDER:\n So the division\u2019s done?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n \n(pauses)\n I\u2019m afraid so.\n\n\nCAVOLLO:\n Now what?

Local authorities were dispatched to the scene to apprehend the subject, but called in the Foundation when the subject began emitting a faint orange glow from within its chest.\n\n\nEvacuation procedures on the location were enacted. A detachment of the Foundation\u2019s \nGerman branch\n was sent in to handle the threat; Mobile Task Force Delta-2 (\u201dDachshunde\u201d).\n\n\nThe transcript has been translated from its original German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<Members of MTF Delta-2 converge around SCP-8780\u2019s location.

Of note is the presence of four metallic cuboid objects of various sizes. Mimko eyes the objects extensively.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIMKO:\n What are these?\n\n\nJ\u00d6RGEN:\n \n(gulps down sandwich)\n What, those? Let me show you!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Coroner J\u00f6rgen hurries over TLA Model #3465,\n1\n and prepares it.

Once the TLA decharges again, she looks back onto the cube.>\n\n\n<The cube emits a faint blue glow, which eventually dissipates. Temperature recording equipment does not indicate a change in temperature.

With us covering their butts for their 2023 scandal, I doubt they\u2019d be willing to break that partnership.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<J\u00f6rgen retrieves another ham-chicken sandwich from a nearby tray.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJ\u00d6RGEN:\n I am so excited! \n(takes bite)\n Sorry, I eat a lot when I\u2019m excited.

When the public first gazed into the darkness?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n Yes.\n\n\n073:\n Do you know\u2026 why?\n\n\nMIMKO:\n A rise in raids on Foundation installations occurred worldwide. They grabbed whatever they could get their hands on and turn them into weapons.\n\n\n073:\n No\u2014 yes. But that\u2019s not what I meant.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n073:\n When people first found out about me, they rejoiced. I was happy\u2026 but then man did what it could do best. \nKill.\n\n\n073:\n They killed in the name of their religion. In the name of \nme\n. Thousands of innocents died. Why? Because I restored a little faith in the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n073:\n That\u2019s why I \ncannot\n help you.
