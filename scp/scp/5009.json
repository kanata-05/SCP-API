SCP-5009 exhibits a \nVedas\n1\n-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5009. This eventually renders observation of the interior of SCP-5009 impossible.\n\n\nSCP-5009 was the first Foundation building to be commissioned by the Administrator. However, it never entered full operation. Records show that it was completed on 1898-12-01, at which point its anomalous properties appeared to have manifested.\n\n\nSCP-5009's date of completion is noted as roughly coinciding with the approximate time period of the Administrator's disappearance.\n\n\n5009-Ishvara events are moments of causality that occur inside of SCP-5009. Due to the antimemetic nature of SCP-5009, little information on 5009-Ishvara events is known. What is known, however, indicates that:\n\n\n\n\n5009-Ishvara events may affect any individual at any time.\n\n\n5009-Ishvara events consist of the subject's (hereafter designated SCP-5009-1) spontaneous disappearance and subsequent reappearance inside SCP-5009.\n\n\n5009-Ishvara events result in the inevitable employment of the SCP-5009-1 instance at the Foundation 1-2 years following its occurrence.\n\n\n\n\nIt has been confirmed that 100% of Foundation employees of the past, present, and future have experienced or will experience a 5009-Ishvara event.\n\n\nThe synthesis of the latent mnestic drug M-48195, codenamed \"Turkic Red\", has allowed limited exploration of the interior of SCP-5009 and the subsequent discovery of SCP-5009-A. SCP-5009-A is a crack approximately 5.6m in length and 1.2m in width, running along the floor of the central room of SCP-5009. A light emanating from an unknown source can be seen glowing at the bottom of the crack, and intermittent metallic screeching can be heard from inside. Nothing that has entered SCP-5009-A has ever been recovered.\n\n\nSince its discovery, the size of SCP-5009-A, the brightness of the light source coming from within SCP-5009-A, and the loudness and frequency of the metallic screeching have all increased at a non-linear rate. No methods of slowing or reversing these processes are known.\n\n\nSCP-5009-\u0394 designates the existence of the SCP Foundation. Due to the role of SCP-5009 in its inception and continued existence, the SCP Foundation must be classified as an anomaly.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. see also Carson F, Sanchez R 2018, 'Devising a Preliminary Antimemetic Classification System', \nFoundation Science Publishers\n, vol. 42. \"A seemingly paradoxical hybrid of memes and antimemes, Vedas-class antimemes conceal themselves from conscious recollection and observation but exert a significant effect on the informational substrate of the universe.

It's because of you. You've always been there. In the dark. In my dreams. And now that we're staring each other in the eyes, it's like a cloud's been lifted on my mind. I see everything so clearly now. And you've always been there. Whispering in my ear. Planning my every move. Like a puppetmaster. [00:00:37] Metallic screeching.

SCP-5009 exhibits a Vedas1-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5009. This eventually renders observation of the interior of SCP-5009 impossible.",
