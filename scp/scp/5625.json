Contact tracing is in progress to recognize and address civilian contraction of SCP-5625. In the event of an outbreak, Curable Anomalous Disease Protocol 3 should be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEM micrograph of SCP-5625\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5625 is a human-contractable negative-strand RNA virus that attacks the central nervous system of its host. Individuals infected with SCP-5625 typically display unfamiliarity with basic concepts, as well as a slight cough. An antiviral regimen has been proven to halt the progression of SCP-5625 infection and is currently in the final phase of testing.\n\n\nSCP-5625 infection was initially diagnosed in Jason Nemo, an Anomaly Registration Agent assigned to Processing Facility 6. Agent Nemo was apprehended while attempting to register his own nose as an anomalous growth. After confirming that his lack of recognition was genuine, Agent Nemo\u2019s cough led site management to preemptively institute a quarantine for fear of a contagious anomalous phenomenon. To date, 187 Anomaly Registration Agents based in Processing Facility 6 have been diagnosed with SCP-5625 infection.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following operational announcement has been logged due to its relevant content as required by RAISA Statute ID9807-E.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION NACIREMA\n\n\nThe average Anomaly Registration Agent identifies and registers about one anomaly every two weeks, on average. Considering that there is no known origin or initial date of infection for SCP-5625, there could be years\u2019 worth of non-anomalous materials and organisms in our system. An overhaul is imperative. An ad-hoc Task Force has been formed for this purpose:\n\n\nAssistant Researcher Alma Cortez \u2013 Quality Assurance Agent\n\nAssistant Researcher Satomi Yamamoto \u2013 Quality Assurance Agent\n\nDr. Sullivan Boru, DDS \u2013 Remote Administrative Liaison\n\n\nThe core action item for this Task Force is to reconsider all objects and entities registered by agents with known cases of SCP-5625 infection. Erroneously registered entries will be processed at the discretion of Dr. Boru, with all relevant documentation automatically uploaded to SCP-5625's file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5625-1:\n The following reports have been logged by Operation Nacirema's Quality Assurance Agents as instances of erroneous registration as anomalous living entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegID:\n ENT006-539424\n\n\nAgent ID:\n ANREG86134072\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistration Description:\n Rat with overly hairy tail.

As long as you explain what it is, I can get it out of our system and into the proper channels. I think this little guy\u2019s going to end up in the park.

In the future, please make sure you back up your data regularly.\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE READING THIS AND YOU ARE NOT ME: Ignore the name of the file, okay? I'm not writing wedding vows. That's an insane thing to do. This isn't for Alma, anyway, this is for me. I figure, Future Me, you've been with Alma for so long that maybe she's become something different to you than what she first was to me. Not because she's going to change, but like how sometimes you look at an optical illusion and it's a bunch of blobs and colors and then it comes together, and it's beautiful, but it was another kind of beautiful before in a way that you can't see anymore because your eyes have adjusted. You can't forget something like that, right?\n\n\nStream of consciousness. Rambling. Sorry, Future Me. Let's focus on the goal here: give you nice little memory tidbits that you can whip out at the altar to one-up Cortez. Since you and I both know that she's going to fucking kill it on the vows. She's disgustingly articulate.\n\n\nOkay, first slideshow image: first day on Team Non-Anom. Past Me was wearing heels, because that was the vibe I got from the briefing. Alma was at her desk, already checking emails. Her hair was still long then, and she had it up, and she was wearing one of her trademark blue buttondowns. And she looked up, and she made eye contact with Past Me, and Past Me said hi and then we both went to work. And Past Me thought she was cute but with kinda scary vibes, like the goth kid with the septum piercing in high school. Got it? Good. Moving on.\n\n\nNext up, first time she smiled at Past Me. We were grabbing a working lunch in-office because we were waiting on a phone call with the references for some dude in containment. I had PBJ, she had a whole set-up because she's Alma and she lives to be extra. I think there was salmon in some kind of sauce? Anyway. I told that one joke about the blonde putting up her car for collateral that Dad really likes, since it was the one joke I could remember that wasn't super NSFW. And I hit the punchline, and there was the patented heart-stopping Alma smile. You know the one. There was a little bit of sauce on her lips. And that's when Past Me knew.\n\n\nMoving on.\n\n\nI'm not going to describe the first kiss, obviously. It's burned in my mind's eye, except I don't just see her but feel her and smell her and yeah. You can't paint over a wall on fire. If you can't remember that moment, Future Me, you shouldn't be writing vows in the first place.\n\n\nIt's getting close to the end of the day now. We're planning to grab food on the way back. There's a new food truck near our apartment (\nOUR\n apartment! I fucking love it! \nOUR\n, \nOUR\n apartment!!!). So just to cap this off, let me tell you what she's doing right now. Alma's bent over the keyboard, eyes way too close to the screen. You know, the Working Position. She's wearing her bootleg X-Files t-shirt and jeans, and her hair's in that little ponytail to keep it out of her eyes, and she is a fucking goddess. I look at her and it's like seeing through time, seeing every smile and touch and person she's ever been, like layers on layers of the same beautiful person. And I can't fucking wait, Future Me, to know how I see her in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5624\n | SCP-5625 | \nSCP-5626\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5625\n\" by Sonderance, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "IF YOU ARE READING THIS AND YOU ARE NOT ME: Ignore the name of the file, okay? I'm not writing wedding vows. That's an insane thing to do. This isn't for Alma, anyway, this is for me. I figure, Future Me, you've been with Alma for so long that maybe she's become something different to you than what she first was to me. Not because she's going to change, but like how sometimes you look at an optical illusion and it's a bunch of blobs and colors and then it comes together, and it's beautiful, but it was another kind of beautiful before in a way that you can't see anymore because your eyes have adjusted. You can't forget something like that, right? Stream of consciousness. Rambling. Sorry, Future Me. Let's focus on the goal here: give you nice little memory tidbits that you can whip out at the altar to one-up Cortez. Since you and I both know that she's going to fucking kill it on the vows. She's disgustingly articulate. Okay, first slideshow image: first day on Team Non-Anom. Past Me was wearing heels, because that was the vibe I got from the briefing. Alma was at her desk, already checking emails. Her hair was still long then, and she had it up, and she was wearing one of her trademark blue buttondowns. And she looked up, and she made eye contact with Past Me, and Past Me said hi and then we both went to work. And Past Me thought she was cute but with kinda scary vibes, like the goth kid with the septum piercing in high school. Got it? Good. Moving on. Next up, first time she smiled at Past Me. We were grabbing a working lunch in-office because we were waiting on a phone call with the references for some dude in containment. I had PBJ, she had a whole set-up because she's Alma and she lives to be extra. I think there was salmon in some kind of sauce? Anyway. I told that one joke about the blonde putting up her car for collateral that Dad really likes, since it was the one joke I could remember that wasn't super NSFW. And I hit the punchline, and there was the patented heart-stopping Alma smile. You know the one. There was a little bit of sauce on her lips. And that's when Past Me knew. Moving on. I'm not going to describe the first kiss, obviously. It's burned in my mind's eye, except I don't just see her but feel her and smell her and yeah. You can't paint over a wall on fire. If you can't remember that moment, Future Me, you shouldn't be writing vows in the first place. It's getting close to the end of the day now. We're planning to grab food on the way back. There's a new food truck near our apartment ( OUR apartment! I fucking love it! OUR , OUR apartment!!!). So just to cap this off, let me tell you what she's doing right now. Alma's bent over the keyboard, eyes way too close to the screen. You know, the Working Position.
