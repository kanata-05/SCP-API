Further misinformation has been spread about the content platformed on SCP-7830 concerning the untrustworthy nature of the information contained within.\n\n\nBackdoor exploits have been placed in those databases so that Metatron.AIC can access and delete any updates to the application. As the process by which SCP-7830 is uploaded is completely unknown, containment will be focused on mitigation and deletion at the distribution point.\n\n\nSeveral working smartphones with SCP-7830 uploaded will be maintained for research purposes at Site-43.\n\n\nAll known search engines have been attacked with a virus designed by Foundation technicians, the sole purpose of which is to redirect away from the website hosting SCP-7830.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst post on SCP-7830.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-7830 is a social media platform titled \u201cViber\u201d published and maintained by GoI-5889 (\u201c\nVikander-Kneed Technical Media\n\u201d).\n1\n On 22 July, 2023, SCP-7830 was launched on the URL www.viber.vktm. No hosting service currently houses the .vktm domain name, and as far as Foundation researchers and technicians can ascertain, it does not exist. Shortly after the service debuted on the website, an application was released and forcibly downloaded on every smartphone active within the United States through unknown means.\n2\n\n\nFormatting on SCP-7830 concerning image and text placement is wildly inconsistent. When asked about this feature on the platform, Mari MacPhaerson noted that \u201cViber uses the proprietary formatting technology 'Visionary', which exemplifies the high standard for graphical design always on display with Vikander-Kneed Technical Media products.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7830\u2019s anomalous effects include a cognitohazard that creates a compulsion to check an affected user\u2019s feed of content on the platform. Affected individuals will refresh their feeds dozens of times a day, spending a large percentage of their free time focused on the social media platform. Failure to refresh the feed can lead to elevated feelings of anxiety, and a general sense of impending doom. Additionally, information contained within posts on SCP-7830 is retained in an affected individual\u2019s memory even with amnestic therapy.\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-four hours after SCP-7830 first debuted, a post was uploaded that announced the platform would be undergoing a change.\n\n\n\n\nWithin moments of the above post, a press conference was livestreamed to YouTube on the channel VKTM Insights.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVKTM Viber Press Conference Transcript\n\n\n23 July 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[A humanoid individual wearing a silk blouse and a bandage around her eyes sits behind a folding table with numerous microphones set up in front of her.\n4\n Blood can be seen dripping down her face and splattering the table throughout the stream. Behind her is sitting a large stylized V made up of disconnected lines against a black background.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: Good morning, my name is Mari MacPhaerson. Until this morning I was the Vice President of Public Relations at Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. But now, I reveal myself to the world as the new owner of Viber, the social media platform that is taking this country by storm.\n\n\nUnknown male voice\n: Can you tell us more about this new logo, Mari?\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: You bet your sweet patootie, I can. Thanks for the question, Jim. By the way, if you interrupt me again, I\u2019ll have your tongue cut out on camera.\n\n\n[An obvious laugh track can be heard.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: But enough jokes. You want to know about the logo. Who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s swell isn\u2019t it? Very cool. Way cooler than a little birdie or some other cutesy thing, right? I know I\u2019m right, because I designed it. That\u2019s right, she\u2019s not just an entrepreneur ladies and gentlemen of the press, she\u2019s got brains too. The secret to VKTM graphic design, you\u2019re looking at her.\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: But you want to know more. Well, who wouldn\u2019t love those simple lines? That stark white on a black background? Like the symbol of a freedom fighter spray painted on the walls of the dictatorship that oppressed them. That\u2019s what the V stands for, people \u2013 Victory, Valiant, Veracity. We are the ones telling you the truth while those other social media platforms are filled with the maniac drivel of billionaires, the lies told by Washington, the misinformation by religious leaders. This is the new age, get used to it.\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: I am become meme, destroyer of bullshit.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAfter the press conference, MacPhaerson sent out three posts to SCP-7830 in short succession:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe tone of MacPhaerson\u2019s posts (and that of any official media for SCP-7830) began to change over the next twenty-four hours. In the brief period prior to the rebranding, the official account of the platform and MacPhaerson focused on updates concerning Vikander-Kneed Technical Media products. After the rebranding, the posts seemed to cover a variety of subject from MacPhaerson\u2019s personal opinions.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMetatron.AIC began cloning its consciousness to monitor and contain any posts on SCP-7830 that threatened to sabotage normalcy. Numerous posts in the following week involved MacPhaerson\u2019s apparent obsession with false identities and bot accounts. During this period, several thousand accounts were suspended for \u201cbot activity\u201d despite zero indication of such activity taking place. In fact, not one of the accounts used by Metatron.AIC was suspended for \u201cbot activity\u201d and Mari MacPhaerson even sent a private message on the platform to one of these accounts with the body of the message consisting solely of a \u201cwinking smiley face\u201d emoji.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs before, within moments of the above post to the platform a press conference was livestreamed to YouTube on the channel VKTM Insights.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV Press Conference Transcript\n\n\n30 July 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The broadcast begins directly in the middle of MacPhaerson answering a question. As before she is sitting in front of a large stylized V logo, but this time on a blue circular background representing the Veracity mark.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: \u2013 I don\u2019t give a shit, who owns this company? I think I know the right way to run my company, Jim.\n\n\n\u201cJim\u201d\n: \n[Mumbles unintelligibly.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: Well, that\u2019s to be expected without your tongue. Now, can I continue my press conference?\n\n\n\u201cJim\u201d\n: \n[Mumbles unintelligibly.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: Thank you. Like I was trying to say, the service we offer with the Veracity mark is to prove that you\u2019re who you say you are. And once you can do that, we can offer you so many benefits. This is a service, like any other! Millions of people will pay for the right to earn creator monetization, send longer Vs, and get preferential messaging! The feed will prioritize veracity-d accounts, isn\u2019t that worth the price?\n\n\n\u201cJim\u201d\n: \n[Mumbles unintelligibly.]\n\n\nMari MacPhaerson\n: \n[Sighs]\n Yes. We do take credit cards.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous posts on the platform complained about preferential access to information, the cluttering of the feed with accounts with the Veracity mark, and the questionable verification process that any accounts deciding to get Veracity would go through.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7830 Research Debrief \u2013 Department of Memetics\n\n\nSite-43 office of Lillian Lillihammer \u2013 31 July 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Lillihammer is staring at her smartphone.]\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer\n: Do you think Clef really joined this stupid site?\n\n\nDr. Blank\n: I mean\u2026 he\u2019s basically an idiot. But he\u2019s also a trained assassin, so he\u2019s got to be competent in something. Even money I\u2019d say.\n\n\n[Lillihammer laughs.]\n\n\nBlank\n: How\u2019re you doing?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Fucking peachy.\n\n\nBlank\n: Come on, it can\u2019t be that bad. It\u2019s just social media posts. You\u2019d already be doing that.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I guarantee I wouldn\u2019t be. I don\u2019t even own a smartphone, Harry.\n\n\nBlank\n: You mean you didn\u2019t used to own one.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Yes. Fuck. Look at this shit!\n\n\n[Dr. Lillihammer holds out the smartphone for Dr. Blank to see. He shields his eyes.]\n\n\nBlank\n: Nope! No way! Not gonna happen.\n\n\n[Lillihammer relents and puts the smartphone face down on the desk.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: This is the worst SCP ever.\n\n\nBlank\n: You volunteered for it! I\u2019m sure Wettle could have done it. I\u2019ve read the reports, it\u2019s mostly summarizing.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I thought it would be interesting! I thought there would be memetics. Well\u2026 there \nare\n some memetics but just enough to burn every post you see into your forebrain.\n\n\nBlank\n: Don\u2019t forget the compulsion.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Compulsion anomalies! What amateur crap. I spend hours looking at that damn thing, scrolling and scrolling. All of it up here.\n\n\n[Lillihammer taps her temple forcibly.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: And all I see is another CEO being a moron for everyone to see.\n\n\nBlank\n: You haven\u2019t learned anything?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Not a goddamn thing on that site is worth reporting.\n\n\nBlank\n: So, a lot like any other social media platforms.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I hate VKTM.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the launch of the Veracity campaign, users found that they could not open their phones without first logging into SCP-7830.\n7\n Many thousands of users reset their devices to factory settings, only to discover that SCP-7830 would still be uploaded to the device and would still require login to open the phone. Within twenty-four hours, the login process changed to allow for push advertising immediately after opening the phone. Notifications from SCP-7830 were co-opted for these advertisements, forcing users to click through several dozen promos \u2013 originally ads from established corporations and business interests, but gradually receding over the first few days until all promos were of VKTM products \u2013 before utilizing the application or using the phone for other reasons.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt was noted quickly that individuals who paid for the Veracity service in order to impersonate a celebrity began to change in appearance and behavior to a surface level approximation of that celebrity. This was further complicated by the fact that a user who tried to impersonate a corporation or brand began to change in appearance such that they would look inhuman or display anomalous attributes such as pupils in the shape of trademarked iconography.\n\nSite-43 Director McInnis mobilized several dozen task forces to deal with this problem, amnesticizing or containing individuals who had begun to resemble corporate mascot or logos. Within three days, over three thousand suddenly anomalous entities were in containment across the continental United States\n8\n and many thousands were amnesticized.\n\n\nIn the midst of this containment activity, Foundation informants revealed that several Hollywood production companies and studios were attempting to utilize this anomalous effect to their benefit. Several individuals who had been altered to resemble actors of note were hired by Universal, Sony, Warner Bros. and the like to serve as backup actors for the actual celebrities. This prompted another mobilization by Foundation forces to detain any employees involved in or aware of this plan, contain SCP-7830 users that had become doubles of celebrities, and amnesticize any witnesses. The Department of Procurement and Liquidation was preparing a proposal to buy out the control of any studio or production house utilizing this technique, in order to assist in the containment of SCP-7830\u2019s side effects, when verification anomalies suddenly ceased to manifest. Individuals who had been changed were returned to their previous locations and appearances without any memory of the events, even those in containment.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Director Allan J.

Engagement numbers released by the official V account stated that user numbers had only ever grown since the service's debut. Background observation of smartphone usages by Metatron.AIC showed that by 1 October 2023, only ten million accounts were active on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Harry Blank\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Lillian Lillihammer\n\n\nSubject:\n Look at this shit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know there\u2019s only ten million active accounts!

Posts were made about MacPhaerson\u2019s weightlifting and nutrition routines, about her training regimen, and how she would eventually celebrate her win. Videos were uploaded showing MacPhaerson lifting weights and sparring with boxing professionals. But on 10 October, 2023, MacPhaerson uploaded the following:\n\n\n\n\nMacPhaerson\u2019s posts became frantic over the next few hours, full of contradictions and outlandish promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFollowing the above messages, and multiple others not reproduced here, MacPhaerson\u2019s account went silent for three days. In the previous eighty-five days of existence, MacPhaerson had never failed to post at least one daily update.\n\n\nOn 19 October, 2023, the following message was posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Dr. Lillian Lillihammer\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Harry Blank\n\n\nSubject:\n Hallelujah!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree at last!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAfter an outburst\n12\n in the Site-43 third sublevel main cafeteria, Dr. Lillihammer was detained and put on administrative leave with pay for a period of no less than two weeks. The monitoring of SCP-7830 will be reassigned to Dr. Wettle.\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+101\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The format of posts is similar to Twitter or Tumblr, two popular well established social media platforms.\n\n\n2\n. This included phones that were incapable of running the software, forcing many thousands of owners to reset to factory settings.\n\n\n3\n. This channel did not exist prior to the stream session, but nevertheless over three hundred thousand users watched it live.\n\n\n4\n. No logos of existing news services are evident on the microphones and Foundation personnel have not found any evidence of any news service attending this event.\n\n\n5\n. Attempts to have this channel removed from YouTube have failed, as the corporation does not even recognize the channel identifier or admit that any such channel is in existence.\n\n\n6\n. Verification process through Veracity only requires an acceptable payment form. No attempt is made by the process to actually verify any information about the user.\n\n\n7\n. The details of this process cannot be verified, as no change in programming can be detected that would lead to this result.\n\n\n8\n. This anomalous effect did not manifest for users from other countries utilizing the Veracity service in this way.\n\n\n9\n. The expenditure of resources to mount the containment of the individuals noted above was well above ten million Euros.\n\n\n10\n. It is unclear how MacPhaerson was able to send a message directly through SCiPNet.\n\n\n11\n. VKTM is not a registered corporation in any of the fifty United States of America, or in any other nation so far as Site-43 researchers can establish.\n\n\n12\n.
