An area with a radius of five meters around Junior Researcher Shepherd is to be monitored at all times. When SCP-4091-1 manifests, it is to be intercepted by Foundation security personnel and kept in containment until demanifestation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4091 is a phenomenon involving the spontaneous manifestation of a single \nCanis lupus familiaris\n1\n, designated SCP-4091-1, within a five meter radius of Junior Researcher Shepherd. The time between SCP-4091 occurrences varies greatly, with the longest recorded time being three months, and the shortest recorded time being one hour.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1 is sapient and capable of speech. Upon manifestation, SCP-4091-1 will attempt to locate and converse with Junior Researcher Shepherd. SCP-4091-1 will demanifest following the conclusion of this conversation, or if it is unable to locate Junior Researcher Shepherd within 30 minutes of manifestation.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Recorded conversation between Junior Researcher Shepherd and SCP-4091-1.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Oh, it's you. How have you been?\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n Pretty good.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n That's good. So, has anything interesting happened since I left?\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n Not really. We've all just kinda been hanging out.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Yeah, I figured. Nothing really happened while I was there, either.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n That's not true. Remember how pissed Mike's mom was when he slipped and got mud all over his new jeans? We were laughing about that for years.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Heh. Yeah, that was good.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd stares at the floor. SCP-4091-1 and Junior Researcher Shepherd remain silent for 40 seconds.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n I miss you, dude.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Yeah, I know.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n Will you ever come back?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n I don't know if I can.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n Why's that?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n I work here.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n What's work?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n You wouldn't get it.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n So, think you can come back later?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Probably not.\n\n\nSCP-4091-1:\n Damn, that's a bummer.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Shepherd:\n Yeah.\n\n\nFoundation security personnel arrive. SCP-4091-1 demanifests.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nWhen questioned, Junior Researcher Shepherd refuses to elaborate on his conversation with SCP-4091-1.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
