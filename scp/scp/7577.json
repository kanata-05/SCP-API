As a precaution, at least one Scranton Reality Anchor is to be placed at least thirty meters from SCP-7577.\n\n\nIn accordance with \nProject Orpheus\n1\n guidelines, SCP-7577 is to be visited on a daily basis by its head researcher (currently Doctor Kassandra Angelos). This is to ensure interviews are regularly conducted with the subject to stimulate as much brain function as possible during its containment.\n\n\nIn line with this, several cranial lead wires are to permanently be attached to SCP-7577\u2019s brain to study its brain activity, with special attention being paid to the effects that its condition has on its mental state.\n\n\nDue to immense rarity of SCP-7577's condition\n2\n and its equivalently immense value to Project Orpheus, no attempt is to be made to remedy its current state. Likewise, due to the fact that the longevity of all records of SCP-7577\u2019s existence outside of the Foundation database is limited, all research notes pertinent to the object are to be displayed within SCiPNet.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7577 is a forty-three year old human male formerly known as Alex J. Gomez, who worked as a maintenance staff at Area-13. Based on traditional classifications of reality bending entities, SCP-7577 is considered as a class five reality bender\u2013 however, due to its prevailing metaphysical condition, SCP-7577 is not able to voluntarily use its abilities.\n\n\nInstead, SCP-7577\u2019s reality bending properties are focused upon itself in a rare condition known as autometaphysical erasure (AME), causing its body to involuntarily exhibit sudden violent changes to its hume levels\n3\n. This leads to a state where reality actively abhors the existence of SCP-7577, causing it to slowly begin to phase out of being.\n\n\nIn order, the following stages take place following a subject first being affected by AME:\n\n\nStage 1:\n The incremental loss of the subject's memories\n\n\nStage 2:\n Disassociation of the subject's identity from itself\n\n\nStage 3:\n The loss of all human memory of the subject\n\n\nStage 4:\n The erasure of all physical (and written) evidence of the subject\n4\n\n\nStage 5:\n The sudden disappearance of the subject from reality.\n\n\nThough all physical evidence of the subject will normally be purged from existence following Stage 5 of AME, the Foundation database will still continue to reliably display the information of those affected by the condition, including SCP-7577. This information will then be kept independent of written records outside of the database or the human memory of SCP-7577\u2019s researchers.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, SCP-7577\u2019s condition is terminal. Due to its academic utility to Project Orpheus and the Foundation as a whole, no efforts are currently being made to research a cure for its condition.\n\n\n\n\nContribution made November 10, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7577.1:\n The following logs detail transcriptions of selected interviews with SCP-7577 deemed to be most pertinent to its utility to Project Orpheus, along with accompanying researcher notes\n5\n.\n\n\n\n\nContribution made November 10, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 1\n\n(dated November 11, 2014)\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7577\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Kassandra Angelos, Head Researcher\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos enters SCP-7577\u2019s containment cell. She is holding a tablet, which is seen displaying several documents. SCP-7577 sits up in a bed opposite her, with several cranial leads attached to its head. Bandages cover the previously exposed hole in its skull. As Angelos enters, SCP-7577 smiles.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Hey, doc.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos quietly takes a folding chair leaning on the wall of the room and sets it down. She sits on it soon after, crossing her legs and placing her tablet on her lap. She smiles at SCP-7577.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Hello, Alex. How are you doing?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 chuckles to itself, before moving its hand up to touch the back of its head.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I\u2019m fine. Didn\u2019t feel a thing during the operation, don\u2019t feel a thing now. You guys always know how to treat us right.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos smiles.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Of course.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos continues to sort through documents on her tablet. Eventually, she flips to the topmost sheet and looks up.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Alright, shall we start?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah, doc. Sure.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos begins to read from her tablet, looking up at SCP-7577.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n What\u2019s your name?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Alex Jones Gomez.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos retrieves a stylus from her pocket and draws a small check on the document displayed on the tablet.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Your age?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I\u2019m forty-three.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Occupation?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Maintenance staff at Area-13.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos visibly pauses, before making another check on the sheet of paper.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Place of birth?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Daly City, San Mateo County, California.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos nods to herself, before setting the tablet aside.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Alright, that should be it.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos smiles warmly at SCP-7577.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n How\u2019s the meds we\u2019re giving you, Alex? Do you feel anything, anything at all?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Nah, nothing really. The wires make it hard to sleep sometimes, but it\u2019s alright. Is it alright if you tell me what they do?\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n They\u2019re how we provide medicine to your brain. They\u2019re harmless, really.\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Ah\u2026 great, thank you. You guys got any leads on what I have yet?\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos' smile hardens.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n No, we uh\u2026 we don\u2019t.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 is silent for one second, before chuckling again.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah, figures. I know you\u2019ll see me through, though. You always do.\n\n\n[A silence intervenes for several seconds as Dr. Angelos types on her tablet.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n It\u2019s uh\u2026 what I have won\u2019t kill me, will it?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 visibly swallows.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos stares at SCP-7577 for several seconds.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n No, no\u2026 No you won\u2019t. We promise.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos returns to making notes on her tablet. SCP-7577 awkwardly looks around.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n It\u2019s just that\u2026 my family, you know. I already filed the next two weeks for my vacation leave, wanted to uh\u2026 head back to the States.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos continues to make notes, not looking up from her tablet.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Not that Greece isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just not\u2026 home.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 looks out the window of its room. Like all windows in Area-13, the glass has been blurred, only letting light in.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I miss home. Haven\u2019t been there for a few years.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 looks at Dr. Angelos. Dr. Angelos is still typing on her tablet.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Thank you.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos stops typing. She looks up from her tablet.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n For helping me out. Most places I\u2019ve worked at would never have tried to help out a little guy like me.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 chuckles again. Dr. Angelos looks at him with pity.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Of course. We look out for our own.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Notes:\n AME does not seem to be currently affecting SCP-7577\u2019s memory or mental faculties. Object is responding well to containment, and, thankfully, continues to remain unaware of its status as an anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribution made November 12, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview 4\n\n(dated November 15, 2014)\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7577\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Kassandra Angelos, Head Researcher\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n[Extraneous transcript removed]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Age?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Forty-three.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Occupation?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Maintenance, Area-13.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Place of birth?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Daly City\u2026\n\n\n[SCP-7577 pauses.

I can\u2019t really say how worried I was that-\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n That\u2026?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n That\u2026 you know, I\u2019d caught something bad.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Why do you think so?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I don\u2019t know\u2026 bad feeling? Can\u2019t really describe it.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I mean\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Please be honest.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 is silent. Its lips are pursed.]\n\n\n[After a few seconds, he shakes its head and smiles.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Nah, nevermind, doc. I\u2019m alright.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos looks at SCP-7577 questioningly, before looking back down as she starts typing on her tablet once again.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Were you able to write those letters I told you about, to your family?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah, I got them here.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 retrieves three folded pieces of paper from the table next to its bed.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n One for my wife,\n\n\n[SCP-7577 gives the letter to Dr. Angelos.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n One for my daughter,\n\n\n[SCP-7577 gives the next letter to Dr. Angelos.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n One for my dad.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 gives the last letter to Dr. Angelos.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos receives the letters.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Did you make sure there\u2019s nothing suspect inside these letters?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 chuckles.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Trust me, I\u2019ve sent my fair share back from when I was still in Site-79.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos looks at the letters in her hand before looking up at SCP-7577]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Is it alright if I check?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 looks at Dr. Angelos. After two seconds of looking at her, he nods.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah, sure.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos slowly opens one of the letters in her hand. She starts to slowly read it.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n This is to your daughter?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah.\n\n\n[SCP-7577 smiles. There is a hint of sadness in its expression.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n She\u2019s seventeen. Turning eighteen.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Oh?

I can't access our records right now.\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Twenty.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos stops to note down SCP-7577\u2019s response.

You\u2019ve seemed quiet for the past few days.\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I\u2019m alright, you don\u2019t need to worry about me.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos stares at SCP-7577\u2019s face.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Alex?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yes?\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Is it alright if I ask you a question?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 smiles at Dr. Angelos.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Yeah, sure. I\u2019m an open book.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n To date, you\u2019ve never applied for promotion, and you\u2019ve always complied whenever you were transferred. Why did you ever stay with the Foundation for so long?\n\n\n[SCP-7577 stares at Dr. Angelos for several seconds. It continues to make a slight smile.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n I mean\u2026\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Why wouldn\u2019t I, right? You treat me well.

Would you be willing to answer a few questions?\n\n\n[\nSCP-7577\n continues to stare blankly forward.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos clears her throat.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Name?\n\n\n[\nSCP-7577\n does not answer.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos types on her tablet.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Age?\n\n\n[\nSCP-7577\n does not answer.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos types on her tablet.]\n\n\n[As she finishes, she looks up.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n You\u2019re not going to speak, are you?\n\n\n[\nSCP-7577\n stares blankly at the wall.]\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos sighs.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Occupation?\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Maintenance staff at Area-13.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos looks visibly surprised.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Al\u2026 alright.\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos types in the response on her tablet.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n That should be it, SCP-7577.

However, she is interrupted as \nSCP-7577\n speaks again.]\n\n\nSCP-7577:\n Will anyone remember me?\n\n\n[Dr. Angelos stops. \nSCP-7577\n continues to look at her.]\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n Due to the advanced state of \nyour\n condition, we may not for much longer. The only records of \nyour\n existence will be within our database.\n\n\nDr. Angelos:\n In short\u2026 very little will remain of \nyou\n. You won\u2019t live on anywhere but here.

We still don't know why it happens, or where the afflicted go. We don't even know what counts as \"physical evidence\", and what gets to be erased.\n\n\nPlease no.\n\nStill, we know much more about AME now than we did decades ago. As Project Orpheus reaches its final stage, I believe I have fair reason to doubt that, out of the hundreds of reality benders we\u2019ve found to have AME, this article brings something new.\n\n\nPlease.\n\nFile this away with the others.
