All abnormalities between flight manifest at time of take-off and at time of landing are to be investigated for the presence of SCP-6737-A. Upon acquisition of SCP-6737-A, MTF Tau-14 will bring subject to Anthropoid Site-48 for assessment. By Order of the Ethics Committee, eligibility for Reintegration Protocol is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; See \nReintegration Protocol #6737\n for further details.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6737 is a recurring anomaly affecting flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS). Within a weekly 24-hour timeframe, a varying number\n1\n of individuals (designated SCP-6737-A) will appear within AMS or onboard any number of wide-body aircraft (designated SCP-6737-B) inbound to the airport. Each instance of SCP-6737-A possesses a simulacrum of the identity of an individual who has gone missing and is presumed dead prior to manifestation. SCP-6737-B typically either departs from or has a layover at the international airport nearest to SCP-6737-A's last known whereabouts or the potential location of their remains.\n\n\nSCP-6737-A subjects do not recall the immediate circumstances of their disappearance and react with unease when informed of traumatic experiences. Instances of SCP-6737-A display intricate false memories which create the belief of having lived a normal life leading up to the decision to board SCP-6737-B. This belief may be superficially supported by personal effects manifested with SCP-6737-A.\n\n\nAddendum- Discovery:\n The first three SCP-6737-A instances manifested on 02/05/2014.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines 2610 departed from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KVG) at 06:40 EST, arriving at AMS at 12:20 CET. SCP-6737-A-001 identified as Lee Ellison, age 18 at time of acquisition. SCP-6737-A-001 was the subject of a missing persons investigation since 19/02/2009, declared a homicide 03/04/2009. Murray Souza would be convicted of her murder and two others in the Cincinnati area; although blood evidence was crucial in the trial, Ellison's remains were never located. SCP-6737-A-001 sent the following text messages to the mother of Ellison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\njust landed mom\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nwho is this???\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlee lol\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nbrb i gotta look for jenny. probably at a bar. you know they let us drink here?? and you can't stop us lol\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nwhoever the fck u are this isnt funny. fck you\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncalm tf down it's just a drink. are you alright?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nsick bstard impersonating my dead child. do i know u? havent seen jenny in years bitch\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nare you the one drinking? call me.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<SCP-6737-A-001 has a correspondence with the mother over video call, prompting her to alert media and authorities.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 18:30 CET, KLM 838 arrived from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) carrying SCP-6737-A-002, identified as Min Jiang, age 38. Jiang was last documented 15/02/1999. Subject allegedly ceased contact with her parents in Suzhou, China due to an interpersonal dispute, and abandoned her apartment intact, her family never receiving correspondence until after appearance at AMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 19:10 CET, Aeromexico 553 arrived after layover at Cancun International Airport (CUN). SCP-6737-A-003 identified as Roman da Silva, age 27, a Brazilian national who went missing on 05/06/2013 during a vacation trip to Mexico. During a recreational scuba diving excursion in the Gulf of Mexico, subject was separated from his diving group and never found. After manifestation at AMS, SCP-6737-A-003 began posting to social media images of himself at various locations in the city and was inundated with incredulous messages asking his whereabouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \nreplayed your story.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDude, wtaf??\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nkkkk i know, amsterdam girls go crazy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMate, they said you were dead.

Information released by and in relation to each subject has been suppressed. The following week, 12 SCP-6737-A instances manifested within a 24-hour period on 09/05/2014 and 10/05/2014.\n\n\nAddendum- Site-48:\n Acquired from Schiphol Group 10/04/1998, Transit Facility-48 (LEY) has been retrofitted from inert Safe-class storage to a site dedicated to humanoid containment. Facility is to be operated under the front group Schiphol Crown Passenger Flights and serve as the primary nexus for the Orientation/Reintegration of SCP-6737-A. Flights with confirmed SCP-6737 activity are permitted to land directly at Site-48 under extenuating circumstances. Approved 25/06/2014. \nSCP-6737-A instances are to be contained for purposes of research for no more than 3 days before receiving D-Class orientation\n amended by Order of the Ethics Committee; see \nReintegration Protocol #6737\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExterior of Site-48 (LEY)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLEVEL\u00a03\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendums\n\n\n\n\nAddendum- Instance Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nSCP-6737-A\n\n\nSCP-6737-B\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/01/2015\n\n\nPaula, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mercado, Ages 38 and 32; Their three children, Ages 12, 10, and 9; A-313 - 317\n\n\nIberia 3341; Marrakesh Menara Airport (RAK)\n\n\nLast seen in Casablanca 26/02/2014, vehicle was found 10/03/2014 offroad in Atlas Mountains, presumed foul play.

They pulled back on all of us. I saw those \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 pull him under the dirt. Nothing we could do for them then. It isn't right for you to leave people in the dust like that. It'll come back to you.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n You want us to go dig up a mass grave?\n\n\nA-6794:\n I mean it.

I believe this operation is both ongoing and funded from research allocations.\n\n\n\n\nI can provide testimony and evidence to the Ethics Committee to support this accusation.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nAwaiting your response,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nResearcher Taner Osman\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher was brought before the Ethics Council one hour after submission.\n\n\n\nCouncillors Present:\n E-2; E-7; E-9; E-12; E-19; E-40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin transcript, 14:00>\n\n\n\n\nE-2:\n This hearing of the Ethics Council is in session.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Hello, Councilpersons. I thank the Committee for their expedience in this matter. I believe the ethical violations I will uncover for the Committee are grave, and it would be an unconscionable blemish on my service to the Foundation to let it continue without remark.\n\n\nE-2:\n State for the record your qualifications and a description of your research assignment.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Researcher Osman, Criminalistics, 14 years experience at the Foundation in forensic profiling.\n\n\n<\n14:01\n Researcher Osman gives a truncated summary of anomaly, activity relevant to containment, and his induction into research team.>\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n \u2026 I think by the third time someone showed up at A-M-S who's already been on a missing persons case we were interested in, that's when they started to listen to me. I insisted that three days wasn't enough to properly vet these people\u2014\n\n\nE-7:\n Researcher, are these people? Some of these subjects certainly died. Will you provide evidence that whatever shows up at A-M-S are not simulacra of the deceased?\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Yes, I will. I insisted we needed more time to vet the subjects. That we could lose so much insight to our cold cases by shipping them off to sites unknown less than a week after intake. That we already had the space in Wing D. I successfully campaigned for a few to have their sentences suspended, temporarily. But it was always about the costs of living space, of food and services, that we couldn't keep them for long. In the back of my mind, the numbers didn't parse. The cost of amnestics, the turnover rate on our facilities. Didn't add up.\n\n\n<\n14:14\n Researcher Osman provides a log of instances to the recordkeeper.>\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Last week, I learned that a majority of subjects labeled 6-7-3-7-A aren't even being taken to Site-48. They get shipped off to black sites, redacted or labeled as auxiliary sites. To my knowledge, these sites do not officially exist. I asked Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 about this. He brushed it off as standard protocol. Said it's been done this way for ten months, said that we're overcapacity. He's since dismissed me from all ongoing research projects. But I can assure you, those numbers on the record that say, for example, seventy instances this week, ninety the next week, I can testify that only a small fraction of those instances were ever seen by the S-C-P-6-7-3-7 Research Team.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n I've used my clearance to go through the logs while I still can. I've collected standouts for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Intake Log 6737.2953>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17/04/2016\n\n\nGalina Perikoc, Age 43; A-2953\n\n\nEurowings 2977 (ZAG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Subject Identified at AMS taxiway 01:12.

One of the boys said.\n\n\nIntake Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Should we get \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to talk to her?\n\n\nC.O. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No, we already got her.

Last seen in 2009.\n\n\nIntake Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Alright, I'll get together the paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n 19/04/2016 Subject was transported to Site-\u2588\u2588 on request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n According to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, this is acceptable; standard procedure, even. I speak enough Croatian to know that this woman wasn't Galina Perikoc. She's Croatian, blonde, brown eyes, in her forties, like Galina Perikoc. The passport upon intake said Galina Perikoc. But she's not Galina Perikoc.\n\n\n<\n14:17\n Research Osman produces a Europol notification for missing Croatian woman Julja Emera, dated 17/04/2016.>\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n I contend that the woman identified as A-2-9-5-3 was never Galina Perikoc, and she wasn't missing until we got involved. She was Julja Emera. Last seen onboard Eurowings 2-9-7-7.\n\n\n<\n14:17\n Research Osman produces further items of interests for the record.>\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n I contend, A-1-4-4-4, Mehmet Adallisid, misidentification. A-2-8-9-6, Nikosa Adoyev, not found anywhere close to A-M-S. A-4-1-4-7, Ingard Boyeson, a complete fabrication. Job security for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 meant sweeping in more subjects for their scheme. All human lives, subjects of greater forces, shipped and sold across our facilities.\n\n\nE-12:\n Researcher Osman, what estimation of these instances do you contend are false imprisonments?\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n The real anomalies are still coming in on schedule. Maybe even at an accelerated rate. I've spoke to them. But if the researcher team never sees most of the inductees, then what facts can I go on? The itineraries of the victims leads me to believe the operation runs around the clock.\n\n\nE-9:\n I don't doubt your sample, Researcher, but we'll make that assessment after our own audit.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Beyond that, I believe there are further examples of egregiously misdirecting the research team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Research Log 6737.314.3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/01/2015\n\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mercado, Age 32; A-314\n\n\nIberia 3341 (RAK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nPrior:\n Subject was administered Class-Z mnestics and interviewed.

I've been requesting more mnestic testing for some time, always shot down. Instead, more and more of my subjects came already dosed up on amnestics, already prepped for orientation. There was no intention to investigate them anymore. They must have assumed that everyone had already reduced these people to numbers in their minds. We'd all turn our noses down when looking at these people because of their jumpsuits. But I noticed.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n I submit this evidence for evaluation by the Ethics Council. I believe that the behavior of the 6-7-3-7 team is an unacceptable and malicious violation of the rights of the public and an indefensible use of Foundation resources.\n\n\nE-2:\n Researcher Osman, the Ethics Council will make a determination of the evidence presented. Your appeal to the Council is heard and you may be called upon in the future for examination of and by the accused.\n\n\nResearcher Osman:\n Thank you, Councillor.\n\n\nE-2:\n If there are no further inquiries, this council is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n<End transcript, 14:24>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeal:\n \nGRANTED\n- By consensus of the Ethics Councillors present and without Veto by \nE-1\n, it has been commanded that the activities of MTF Tau-14 and the SCP-6737 research team are to be immediately audited for ethical violations.
