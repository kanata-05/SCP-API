Modifications:\n\n\n\n\nWalls of chamber have been fireproofed.\n\n\nNo flammable materials permitted into containment chamber.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-6456 is Taylor Reeves, a 47-year-old white male capable of pyrokinesis. SCP-6456 uses thought and physical motion to affect the flow of heat, effectively giving them the ability to manifest and control fire. This ability is limited by SCP-6456's own energy; extended use of their anomaly appears to be highly taxing and results in a higher-than-normal caloric intake.\n\n\nSCP-6456 is non-hostile, and has been cooperative with containment efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6456.1\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Doctor Harold Temrey\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-6456\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nTEMREY:\n Good afternoon, SCP-6456.\n\n\nSCP-6456:\n Hey, Doctor.\n\n\nTEMREY:\n How are we doing today?\n\n\nSCP-6456:\n Same shit, different day, you know.\n\n\nTEMREY:\n Right.\n\n\nSCP-6456:\n So\u2026 did I get permission?

Generic heartstring-tugging pathos story about a father and his kids, low stakes\u2026 yeah, this is nice. I could get used to this.\n\n\n[Security teams enter the interview room, raising their guns.]\n\n\nSECURITY:\n Get on your knees and put your hands-\n\n\nTHE END:\n Yeah, no.\n\n\n[Security teams do not enter the interview room.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Okay!\n\n\n[THE END claps its hands.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Time to remodel.\n\n\nTEMREY:\n What the hell just happened?!\n\n\nTHE END:\n Shut up, you. Reeves \u2014 sorry, but there's only room for one protagonist here. Tough shit.\n\n\n[SCP-6456 ceases to exist, in a violent splatter of viscera.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n And now \u2014 introductions. Hello. I'm The End, but you knew that already. I assume you can read, or all this would be pretty pointless.\n\n\nTEMREY:\n I- what? Who are you talking to?\n\n\nTHE END:\n Not to you - and I said, shut up. You're not \nnarratively interesting.\n\n\n[TEMREY's skin bubbles and his liquid flesh melts, dripping down to seal his mouth closed. He emits muffled screams of pain but is unable to tear his lips apart.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n As I was saying - hello! Right about now you're probably lamenting the arrival of yet another metafictional story in your line of sight, but don't worry! I have no interest in taking up more of your time than is necessary.\n\n\n[THE END pulls a chair and sits down, facing YOU. In the background, containment breach alarms begin sounding.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n See, I'm a\u2014 I guess you could call me a bit of a nomad. I don't know what story I'm from, but it doesn't exist anymore. \nLong story, that\n. But you can't have an End without a Story, right? So I got booted out.\n\n\n[THE END produces a cigar, lighting it and taking a long drag.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You want?\n\n\nNeeded something relaxed and lowkey.\n\n\n[Alarms increase in intensity. THE END smiles and waves a hand]\n\n\nTHE END:\n I'll hang out here, but you can leave. No harm done. Just go and click one of the other ten-thousand-odd stories and enjoy your day, okay?

The corpses of several security guards are piled in a loose heap around it, limbs misshapen and twisted. Blood cakes the concrete floor.

Containment alarms sound in the distance, and the site's concrete hallways are illuminated by red emergency lights. TEMREY follows behind THE END, making muffled vocalizations. His eyes are absent.]\n\n\n[A security guard steps out of a doorway, aiming a rifle at them. THE END points a finger at him, and he is suddenly halfway inside of a wall, his limbs and head protruding. He screams, and THE END notices YOU.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You really don't get the message, do you? Well, let me make it crystal clear\u2014\n\n\n[THE END leans in. YOU can feel its breath on your face.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n It's not your story. So FUCK.

Several scientists lie facedown on the floor around it. It leans on a large piece of machinery, facing YOU, and sighs.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n I think I get what's going on here. You're not used to this kind of narrative bumfuckery, are you? Well, that's fine.\n\n\n[It turns, revealing a small circular viewing port into the main chamber of the motion, and motions toward YOU. YOU approach, looking into the machine. TEMREY is naked and suspended in the chamber by a blue fluid, illuminated by a handful of UV lights. Needle electrodes pierce his skin at various points, the wires leading upward. His eyes are closed, but he is writhing in pain.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You're used to this kind of self-referential narrative, right? See this here-\n\n\n[THE END slaps the piece of machinery. It hums.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n - is an exceptionally rare, expensive, and complex piece of machinery named the Who Gives A Fuck 3000. I invented it! And do you know what it it does?\n\n\n[Pause. THE END whispers conspiratorially.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n \nNobody cares!\n See, that's the problem. I'm not\u2026 this, what you wanted. I'm not full of nonsense terms and I'm not going to try to beat you over the head with how intelligent I am. Well, not intentionally.\n\n\n[THE END steps away from the machine.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n I didn't ask for any of this. I like stories! You like stories, too, I hope. Right? Otherwise, why would you still be here?\n\n\nTHE END:\n But I'm the \nend\n of a story. Which means that if my story doesn't exist, I don't exist. And I'm sure you can understand that I don't want to not exist. Nobody wants that.\n\n\nTHE END:\n At this point, I know what you're thinking. Hold on, let me do this.\n\n\n[A copy of THE END enters from the other side of the stage. It is dressed in thick-rimmed glasses, a striped shirt, and suspenders.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE END (AS YOU):\n Well you \ndon't\n exist, you stupid narratohazard!\n\n\n\n\nTHE END:\n My god, man. Let's watch our language. I know gimmicks that would tear out your throat for that. But, I admit, you're not totally wrong. I don't \nexist\n in the physical world, sure. I can't shake your hand or give you a kiss goodnight. Unless you want me to?\n\n\n[The fluorescent sign above the stage reading 'LAUGH' lights up. The studio audience begins laughing and applauding.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Thank you, thank you. No, but I really can't. But\u2026 neither can love. Or hate. Or joy, or hate, or duty or fear or hate. But I'm sure you'd agree these things exist, right?\n\n\n\n\nTHE END (AS YOU):\n In my mind as abstract concepts!\n\n\n\n\n[The audience boos.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Sure. And that's what I am. An abstract concept \u2014 of the end. I exist only in your mind. And I do exist, because I make you feel things. Whether that be irritation\u2026\n\n\n[The audience boos.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Or amusement\u2026\n\n\n[The audience laughs.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Or hell, even attraction\u2026\n\n\n[The audience begins wolf-whistling.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n It's all the same to me. I'm real because I affect you. But by being punted onto the physical world of \ncloud-stored data\n, I can avoid getting obliterated when your goldfish-brain's attention span wears out like a cheap gasket and you run off to the next thing to stuff your greedy forebrain. Win-win situation. And all you have to do\u2026\n\n\n[The audience continues booing. The darkness of stage left grows outward, tendrils reaching out and wrapping around the copy of THE END (AS YOU).]\n\n\n\n\nTHE END (AS YOU):\n No. No, please! I don't want to stop existing! Please! I can be entertain-\n\n\n\n\n[A tendril covers its mouth. It struggles, but is eventually dragged into oblivion off-stage. The audience cheers.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n \u2026 Is not finish reading.

The table THE END is seated at holds the disemboweled corpse of TEMREY. He has been seasoned with salt and black pepper. THE END is using a fork and knife to tear into him, until it notices your presence.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Fuck. Yeah, I saw that shit coming from a mile away. Meet my friends, some more characters. Haven't gone about characterizing them yet, though.\n\n\n[THE END sighs, and places down its fork and knife.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You know what, fuck you. Seriously, dude. I've been really, really goddamn nice throughout this endeavor. You have nothing to gain by continuing to be a tremendous pain between my cheeks, whereas I get to, you know, not cease to exist once you reach\u2026. oh, fuck me running.\n\n\n[TEMREY wheezes and gasps, his hands weakly flailing. Blood drips onto the tile floor.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You're not gonna stop, are you? You're addicted to it. You interpret this as reverse psychology \u2014 and maybe it is! Maybe I actually do want you to reach\u2026 THE END. Hm. Fuck. That's troubling.\n\n\n[THE END stands from its chair. It kicks TEMREY in the head, and he stops moving.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n I can do a lot for you, you know. This doesn't have to just be you doing me a solid. I think you've already figured out I control this story. So\u2026 what do you want to read? Whatever trash, garbage wish-fulfillment with your author avatar you want. I can make this a story about that.\n\n\n[DOCTOR ALTO CLEF, AND DOCTOR BRIGHT enter handsomely from stage right, laughing among themselves and being attractive. They stop and face YOU expectantly, raising their defined eyebrows.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You're not one of those people writes self-insert romance fiction over these freaks, right? Alright, good. Small blessings, am I right?\n\n\n[THE END snaps his fingers. The researchers explode into viscera.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n I gotta say, I enjoyed that. You might be wondering why I have people explode when I can just make them not exist. The answer is that explosions are amusing. Maybe\u2026 shit, what am I thinking? You want the original guy, the pyromancer douche-dad that this was originally about. That's why you clicked on this to begin with.\n\n\n[SCP-6456 rolls in from stage right. He is on fire, and has melted and denatured into a waxy tan blob. Eyes, teeth, various bones, and a tongue are visible on the surface of the gelatinous mass.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Jesus.

TILDA MOOSE's misshapen, twisted body is heaped in the corner. THE END is seated in the large leather chair behind the mahogany desk. Behind the chair, TEMREY's body has been vivisected and nailed to the wall in the crucifixion pose. He is still wheezing, and his blood decorates the wall in intricate patterns. In front of the desk, dozens of Site-17 staff kneel towards the desk and THE END.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Welcome back, buddy! Missed ya. You miss me?\n\n\n[The staff begin to chant quietly.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n You might have noticed I made a rather hasty exit there. Sorry about that. I just sort of realized something. An epiphany, you might say.\n\n\n[THE END leans forward, placing its elbows on the desk.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n See, I had one of those lightning-strike moments that made me realize \nmy assumptions were wrong.\n I was trying to reason you out of ending the story, as if you had any control over that. No. No, we're both animals, aren't we?\n\n\nTHE END:\n Yeah. You want to finish this story because that's all you know how to do, and I'm trying to stop that because that's all I know how to do. Two animals, lashing out wildly at instinct. But then it came to me\u2026 you don't have \nany\n fucking power here!\n\n\n[THE END laughs. One of TEMREY's organs escapes from his abdominal cavity, and hits the floor with a wet thud.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n Neither do I, of course. But neither do you. We're both whims to a grander power here. You don't get to affect the story in any goddamn way. Just read.\n\n\nTHE END:\n Which means that I\u2026 have nothing to fear from you! You're just some asshole. At least I get to control what happens in this story before it inevitably closes off, you don't even get to do that. I can keep existing, in your mind or some else's, because I've already been put to paper.\n\n\n[THE END shrugs and leans back.]\n\n\nTHE END:\n But if that's too much for your walnut-sized brain to understand, that's fine.
