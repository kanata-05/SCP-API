SCP-6926 always appears dressed in a manner somewhat resembling traditional depictions of Santa Claus, with additional articles of clothing worn in cold weather.\n\n\nAreas within a twenty-five mile radius of SCP-6926 experience the following phenomena:\n\n\nEnvironmental:\n\n\n\n\nDecrease in local temperatures; enough to sustain the presence of ice and snow.\n\n\nThe appearance of partially drunk alcoholic beverages within local homes.\n\n\n\n\nPhenomena displayed in humans:\n\n\n\n\nIncreased fatigue and idleness. Often causing subjects to remain sleeping longer than usual.\n\n\nThe inability to keep track of time consistently throughout the day.\n\n\nSevere headaches in subjects that drank alcohol the previous day, no matter how minimal the amount consumed.\n\n\nFeelings of melancholy and regret (Reasons vary between subjects).\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-6926 has displayed various anomalous abilities, including instant teleportation between locations, manipulation and control of ice and snow, inducing alcoholic intoxication through physical contact, and the manifestation of holiday themed/related beverages (Eggnog, Irish-cream, Coca-Cola). SCP-6926 only uses these abilities to aid itself in its annual activities.\n\n\nSCP-6926 manifests annually on the 26th of December in countries that celebrate the holiday \u201cBoxing Day\u201d. During such times SCP-6926 will travel between locations that have hosted social gatherings the night prior, specifically those containing uneaten foodstuffs and beverages leftover from the night before. While there, SCP-6926 will take part in recreational activities such as drinking, eating, and general relaxation. SCP-6926 will de-manifest at 12:00am local time on December 27th.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n Local phenomena resulting from SCP-6926\u2019s anomalous properties were first detected in the village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England, on December 26th 1995. Due to the sudden drastic change in local weather, Foundation agents in the area were dispatched to investigate. SCP-6926 was discovered traveling between pubs in the area, joined by civilians partaking in a pub-crawl that had begun the previous night. Interviews with witnesses revealed SCP-6926 had become heavily intoxicated over the night, during which they made various references to a confidential event that took place on \nSeptember 22nd the same year\n.\n\n\nInterview Log:\n The following is an improvised interview that was recorded following SCP-6926\u2019s sudden manifestation at Site-17\u2019s annual employee boxing day gathering in 1996.\n\n\n\n\nFoundation personnel can be heard talking to one another over the sound of music. The room goes silent and the music stops, as personnel notice the presence of SCP-6926. Loud crunching can be heard from SCP-6926. Researcher Agnew approaches.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n Wow. Um, excuse me? Who\u2019re you?\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n Hi. What\u2019s up? I\u2019m Santa Claus.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n Yeah\u2026 Um, what are you doing here?\n\n\nSCP-6926 continues eating cookies\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n Eating right now.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n Right. Any particular reason you\u2019re here though?\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n Food. You want some?\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n No thanks. \nResearcher Agnew gestures to personnel to alert security.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n So you\u2019re Saint Nick then?\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n No. I\u2019m Santa Claus. Well, not today at least. It\u2019s my day off.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n You don\u2019t seem quite jolly enough to be Santa Claus.\n\n\nSCP-6926 picks up a can of coke and notices that it is warm. Frost forms around the can and SCP-6926 smiles.\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n I don\u2019t care.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n You know, it\u2019s\u00a0strange. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t believe in Santa.\n\n\nSCP-6926 looks at researcher Agnew. SCP-6926 takes a sip of coke.\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n You\u2019re an idiot.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n Any other business?\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n Probably finish off here. Go someplace else. You\u2019re kinda bringing down the mood here buddy.\n\n\nSecurity personnel enter the room and approach SCP-6926. Both restrain SCP-6926 and escort them into the hallway. Shortly afterwards, both security personnel begin to stupor and suddenly collapse onto the floor. SCP-6926 re-enters the room.\n\n\nResearcher Agnew:\n Hey! What\u2019re you-\n\n\nSCP-6926 grabs a bottle of whisky from a nearby table.\n\n\nSCP-6926:\n Haha. Lightweights.\n\n\nSCP-6926 disappears\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6925\n | SCP-6926 | \nSCP-6927\n \u00bb",
