Both SCP-1144 and SCP-1144-1 require cleaning once a week, using disinfectant towels. Do \nnot\n use water to clean either SCP-1144 or SCP-1144-1. Do not press any of the buttons in the process of cleaning SCP-1144. The foot-locker itself does not require maintenance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1144 resembles an Orion HR-120 Analytical Balance, a common brand of precise weighing scales. Like the HR-120, SCP-1144 is a box-like structure, measuring 21.3cm x 32.0cm x 30.2cm, consisting of a base, which presumably houses the electronic components of the device, and a transparent cage. The base itself comprises an LCD display, as well as several buttons for adjusting the scales. [Note: These buttons appear to have no effect on the functioning of SCP-1144, or the results it provides.]\n\n\nSCP-1144 is permanently active; the display will show no signs of being on until an object is placed upon the scales, at which point, the display will activate, providing a reading for the observer.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the reading SCP-1144 provides is not a measurement of the object\u2019s mass; repeated testing seems to suggest that both mass and weight are entirely irrelevant. Ongoing testing has yielded no indication of what exact objective quantity SCP-1144 is able to measure, although tenuous patterns have been established. For example, two similar objects will tend to produce similar readings. Under \u2018normal\u2019 conditions, SCP-1144 provides its data to 3 decimal places.\n\n\nDuring initial testing, each object was \u2018weighed\u2019 three times, and each time similar readings were produced. This was taken to be evidence that SCP-1144 is in fact weighing a particular quantity, which varies in magnitude amongst a given set of objects. The source of the fluctuations are still unknown.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\u00a0I\n\n\n\n\nTesting\u00a0I\n\n\n\n\nExperimental data log, involving Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Junior Researchers \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

With approval from Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the cage was disassembled with relative ease, and the components were placed in a large brown envelope, to be labeled SCP-1144-1. SCP-1144-1 does not appear to have any extraordinary properties. However, it remains to undergo further investigation.\n\n\nWith SCP-1144-1 removed, SCP-1144 continued to function as before, albeit without the constraint of the shielding, allowing much larger objects to be measured.

I positioned two non-descript white sugar pills on the measuring pad. The reading was -0.320. I introduced myself to the individuals \u2014 a man and a woman \u2014 and told them that the pills on SCP-1144 were able to grant 100 extra years of longevity on ingestion. Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 noted that the reading changed from -0.002 to -0.031. I proceeded to take one of the pills and dry-swallow it. The reading changed from -0.031 to 3.503. The D-Class personnel were dismissed afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1143\n | SCP-1144 | \nSCP-1145\n \u00bb",
