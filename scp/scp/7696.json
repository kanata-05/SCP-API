The anomaly is to be sealed in an opaque container. A label explaining the anomaly\u2019s effects is to be attached to the front of the locker, and to be periodically checked to ensure legibility.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7696 is a copy of the August 1986 issue of the erotic magazine \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Written in black marker on the magazine's front are the words \"OH YEAH BABY\". When any of the magazine\u2019s content (including the cover) is read by an individual, they experience a permanent increase in neurotransmitters associated with sexual libido. Individuals affected by 7696 report an increased desire for sexual activity, as well as an increased frequency of sexual thoughts.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Incident 7696-1\n\n\nWhile ensuring that no anomalies were damaged in transit after a transfer of several dozen Safe-class anomalies from Site-134 to Site-459, Dr. Ariana Johanssen was accidentally exposed to 7696\u2019s effects. She did not report this incident at the time, and Foundation awareness was only brought to the incident after she submitted several journal entries detailing the effect 7696 had had on her psyche over the course of a day.\n\n\n\n\n1/10/00\n\n\nIt\u2019s six in the morning, and I\u2019m alone in my office. My phone has five missed calls, all from her. I slept two hours last night.\n\n\nI dreamed in those two hours. I woke up from said dream soaked in sweat. I don\u2019t want to write what the dream was about except for that it involved her and that the feeling of nausea was too strong to even think about falling back asleep.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to tell her how we need to break up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10/00, cont.\n\n\nDave shook me awake on the breakroom couch at 1\u00a0pm. Dipshit that he is he joked about smelling jack on my breath. Asked me two questions and like the idiot that I am I folded and told him everything.\n\n\nHe asked me if Melissa knew, and that\u2019s when I started sobbing and begging him not to report it. He locked the door, and just sort of held me for half an hour and told me it was going to be okay. Didn\u2019t really make up for the jack joke but it was nice to have a moment of genuine human contact. And it helped confirm that I\u2019m still not attracted to guys, anomalous mag or not, which is a small mercy to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10/00, cont II.\n\n\nDave did make him not reporting the incident contingent on the fact that I Faced The Problem Head-On, which he said in this sort of stern Midwestern fatherly tone that was hard to ignore. By this point I had fifteen missed calls, and he also raised the valid point that she was probably going to file a missing persons report if I let the whole thing go on any longer.\n\n\nI parked outside of our apartment a half-hour later, and just cried in the car for god knows how long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10/00, cont III.\n\n\nI called her from the parking lot. Told her that whatever she did do not look out the window or come down. The idea of actually looking at her is terrifying to me. That\u2019s when it\u2019s really gone for good. The self I\u2019ve built. The identity I clawed from thirty-five years of relentless self-doubt and self-hatred. The identity she showed me was perfectly fine and real and valid to have.\n\n\nKnowing yourself for the first time is a strange sort of happiness. It\u2019s a kind you\u2019ve always glimpsed through broken mirrors and midnight thoughts, but denied yourself because the world told you that just isn\u2019t how you can be and you believed the lie.\n\n\nAnd now the lie is the truth and I don\u2019t know what to do with myself any more.\n\n\nShe was like alright I just want to know you\u2019re safe. And I was like yeah I\u2019m safe don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m safe. And she said I love you. And I said I love you too and hated myself for how I meant it now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10/00, cont IV.\n\n\nDave rung me. I told him I was at a Motel 6 for the night, and he sighed. He said that if I didn\u2019t call him back from home by eleven he was going to submit his report to the Site Director, and audibly typed for about half a minute before I took his point. God what an asshole he is.\n\n\nItemized list of Why We Broke Up:\n\n\n\n\n1: Because I was drunk outside her door at 9:32 PM.\n\n\n2: Because I\u2019d gone radio silent for the past 38 hours and then lied about my reason for going radio silent, and, contingent to that:\n\n\n3: Because knowing what I work with she was worried and for very good reason. And I\u2019d subjected her to that pain for no good reason.\n\n\n4: Because I was on a combined 4 hours of sleep and couldn\u2019t think right at all.\n\n\n5: Because it then just sort of all poured out of me. The thoughts. The god-fucking-awful drive or whatever it is they call it. How when she put her hand on my shoulder it gave me the most terrifying feeling in the world and I just about barreled past her to go hurl.\n\n\n6: Because then, when she spoke to me as my head hung over the toilet, she asked why I hid this from her.\n\n\n7: Because, I said, because the reason you love me in the first place is because I\u2019m ace too. Because you helped me find that out about myself. Because you told me that as we sat by a lake in the freezing November cold underneath a blanket that didn\u2019t really do much to help that you could love somebody without liking them like that and that would be what I felt towards you, maybe?\n\n\n8: Because I do love you like that, I said, between sobs on the cold linoleum of the bathroom\u2019s floor. Because I don\u2019t like you like that even if I got these fucking awful thoughts and feelings now that disgust me and that trust me I would \nnever\n want to act on, dear god.\n\n\n9: Because that was who I was now, though. Because I wasn\u2019t myself anymore. Because I wasn\u2019t the person who she loved and because I wasn\u2019t the person that I knew.\n\n\n\n\nItemized list of Why We Stayed Together:\n\n\n\n\n1: Because, she said, bending down on her knees, that didn\u2019t really matter all that much to her. So what if that was who I was now. I was still myself, irregardless of whatever random bullshit may have happened to my neurotransmitters or whatever the fuck. She wasn\u2019t going to leave me just like that.\n\n\n2: Because you still want to make this work, right? To which I enthusiastically nodded yes.\n\n\n3: Because we can make it work, then. And even if it doesn\u2019t work out\u2013 even if we don\u2019t end up being the perfect pair now\u2013 that will be alright. That will be fine.\n\n\n4: Because I still love you very much. And that\u2019s all that matters.\n\n\n\n\nI rung Dave, told him to go fuck himself, and told him that I\u2019d be filing my own report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7695\n | SCP-7696 | \nSCP-7697\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7696\n\" by Long Arm Larry, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
