Samples removed from the container are not to exceed 100\u00a0g. A detailed log must be kept of all SCP-7357 that is produced, complete with accurate records of what has been used to feed it and how much of the sample was subsequently destroyed via incineration.\n\n\nAll new SCP-7357-A instances are to be incinerated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7357 denotes a mixture most similar to \"friendship cake\" starter; a batter that can be \"fed\", then have portions of it split off to be cooked or shared for as long as people continue to \"feed\" it. While chemical analysis of the batter yields no exact details on its ingredients, the overall makeup remains constant regardless of the ingredients mixed in. Investigations into the extent of this property are ongoing.\n\n\nSCP-7357-A denotes any cake produced using quantities of SCP-7357 as an ingredient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe delivered SCP-7357-A instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 14/04/2010, Site-157 received an unmarked package containing the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP-7357-A instance;\n1\n\n\nA Tupperware container of SCP-7357;\n\n\nA note reading: \"Please Feed Herman\".\n\n\n\n\nShortly after these objects were catalogued, they were transported to a secure locker for temporary storage. Upon arrival, it was found that a slice had been cut from SCP-7357-A. This slice has not been located, and the relevant security footage pertaining to this time period was found to have been misplaced. Investigations are underway to locate the individual responsible.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7357-1:\n\n\nDate:\n 15/04/2010\n\n\nSubject:\n 50 grams of all-purpose flour.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Mixed with 50 grams of SCP-7357.\n\n\nResult:\n Identical to initial SCP-7357.\n\n\nNote:\n 50 grams returned, excess incinerated. - Abbi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log 7357-1\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following footage was taken in the Site-157 break room shortly following the submission of Experiment Log 7357-1\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nThe feed starts, showing Director Mastus alone in the break room eating lunch at a table. The door opens, and Researcher Tabernaq enters.\n\n\nMastus gives Tabernaq a small wave with one hand as he bites into his sandwich. Tabernaq returns the wave as she walks over to the refrigerator, takes out her own lunch, and joins him.\n\n\nThe two sit and eat in silence for 2 minutes.\n\n\nMastus:\n Y'know what Abbi?\n\n\nShe grunts what sounds like \"what\" through a mouthful of sandwich.\n\n\nMastus:\n With that new arrival on the mind, I've been thinking it'd be cool to do an office sourdough starter.\n\n\nTabernaq rolls her eyes, still chewing.\n\n\nMastus:\n We'd all pass it around -bring in bread- it'd be fun!\n\n\nShe shakes her head firmly.\n\n\nMastus:\n What?! I think it's a good-\n\n\nTabernaq raises her finger, stopping him, and swallows.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n No.\n\n\nMastus:\n Really? It would be great for bringing everyone together! Like a project-\n\n\nTabernaq:\n I've got enough projects.\n\n\nMastus:\n But-\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Enough \nsourdough\n projects, more specifically. One. Thanks for that, Steve.\n\n\nTabernaq takes another bite of her sandwich.\n\n\nMastus:\n Ah yes\u2026\n\n\nMastus finishes off his own sandwich and stands, collects his garbage, and begins walking over to the trash can.\n\n\nMastus:\n 7\u2026 357\u2026\n\n\nHe walks back over to the table and leans toward Tabernaq.\n\n\nMastus:\n How's that going, by the way?\n\n\nTabernaq leans away from him.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Woah, personal space, Steve! Just read the reports.\n\n\nMastus:\n Oh, but Abbi I'm so busy\u2026\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Busy my ass. Still haven't found out who snuck the slice of that cake.\n\n\nMastus's expression drops.\n\n\nMastus:\n That's not my job.\n\n\nTabernaq raises her eyebrows.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n And your job is?\n\n\nMastus excited expression returns.\n\n\nMastus:\n Community building! So back to the-\n\n\nTabernaq:\n No.\n\n\nMastus lets out an artificially exasperated sigh and begins to walk towards the door.\n\n\nMastus:\n \nWell anyway.\n Don't come crying to me when you want in on the dough!\n\n\nTabernaq:\n I can assure you-\n\n\nThe door slams shut as Mastus exits.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n \u2026I won't be.\n\n\nShe sighs as she takes another bite of her sandwich.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 7357-2:\n\n\nDate:\n 16/04/2010\n\n\nSubject:\n 50 grams of sliced tomatoes.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Mixed with 50 grams of SCP-7357.\n\n\nResult:\n Identical to initial SCP-7357.\n\n\nNote:\n 50 grams returned, excess incinerated. - Abbi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log 7357-2\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following footage was taken in the Site-157 break room shortly following the submission of Experiment Log 7357-2\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nThe feed starts, showing Tabernaq sitting at a table covered with notes.

Mastus follows behind her and rests the tray on the table.\n\n\nTabernaq looks at the Cake on the tray. Her face goes blank.\n\n\nShe stares for a few seconds.\n\n\nMastus:\n Is there something wrong? Wait- no. Have you decided you want a slice? Just a second\u2026\n\n\nMastus turns toward the kitchen. Tabernaq looks back and forth between him and the Cake.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Fuck\u2026\n\n\nMastus:\n Did you say something?\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Oh\u2026 uh. Yeah! Thing is, Steve, I'd actually really like a slice\u2026\n\n\nMastus turns around. A kitchen knife slices through the air in his grip. His face is alight with glee.\n\n\nMastus:\n You'd like some?\n\n\nHe glides over, stops, then plunges the knife into the cake.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n I would love some, but\u2026\n\n\nMastus stops cutting, grasp tight on the knife. His gaze fixes on Tabernaq.\n\n\nMastus:\n But what?\n\n\nAn exaggerated apologetic expression works its way onto her face.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n I have to come clean\u2026\n\n\nMastus:\n Come clean?\n\n\nTabernaq:\n The real reason I've been refusing you\u2026\n\n\nTabernaq's eyebrows scrunch up.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Is that\u2026\n\n\nA heavy silence fills the room.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n It'll give me the shits.\n\n\nMastus:\n The shits?\n\n\nMastus's hand relaxes on the knife.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Yeah! Diarrhea! The shits!

The disposal room is empty.\n\n\nAfter a moment, the door creaks open, and Tabernaq enters holding both the container of SCP-7357 and the initial SCP-7357-A instance in her hands.\n\n\nShe walks toward the furnace, leaving the door to close itself.\n\n\nIt shuts with a deep thud.\n\n\nShe reaches the furnace and undoes the latch. The panel swings open, revealing a dark, empty hole.\n\n\nThe objects fall from her hands, landing in a clatter of plastic against metal against Cake.\n\n\nAfter a pause, she closes the furnace door, and once more secures its latch.\n\n\nShe looks over her shoulder and sighs.\n\n\nThe room is silent.\n\n\nShe steps over to the furnace control panel, and after a few button presses, the furnace whirs to life.\n\n\nA creak.\n\n\nTabernaq's head turns to the far door.\n\n\nMastus stands in the frame.\n\n\nThe furnace roars and pulses.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n Hey Steve.\n\n\nMastus's face falls into a frown.\n\n\nMastus:\n I checked your medical records, Abbi.\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nTabernaq:\n That's a gross-\n\n\nMastus raises his hand.\n\n\nMastus:\n I know.\n\n\nHe takes a step forward.\n\n\nMastus:\n It doesn't matter.\n\n\nA pulse emanates from the furnace.
