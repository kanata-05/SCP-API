Kay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7180 is a pandemic antimeme\n3\n which rapidly erases human procedural memory and most forms of recorded information during \"Manifestation Events\". Containment procedures are largely self-sustaining and appear to be effective in halting SCP-7180 activity worldwide. Total containment renders SCP-7180 difficult to study; most research is based on a single Manifestation Event in April 1957.\n\n\nIndividuals affected by SCP-7180 permanently cease all voluntary activity. Victims will no longer seek food, water, comfort, warmth or breathable air. Attempts to develop a deployable method of rehabilitation were unsuccessful (see \nProcedure 7180-Olympia\n). Consequently, the Ethics Committee has determined that this condition is comparable to brain death; subjects encountered in this state are to be summarily euthanized by lethal injection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0show\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\nOLYMPIA.EXE (INTERV01.TSV)\n \nRead\n the complete text of this Description section.\n\n\nAfterwards, \ncheck feelings\n.\n\n\nIff you are experiencing anxiety\n, \n:alert\n assistant Kay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7180 is believed to spread through written information and/or representative imagery. The severity and range of its effects appear to increase in proportion to net volume and distance of information exchange; with the advent of the World Wide Web, a breach of containment is hypothesized to pose an OK-Class \"Terminal Ambivalence\" Scenario.\n\n\nRecorded information in a Manifestation Event Zone will rapidly deteriorate in legibility, according to physical processes which parallel the method of recording.\n4\n All primary sources attesting Manifestation Events prior to 1957 are presumed lost, along with most other pertinent records. Documentation recovered from an archive in Oklahoma City, OK suggests containment activities have been in effect for at least 160 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Addendum 1: Record of Containment Activities Prior to 1957\n\n\nThe design and promotion of \"OK\" and other Effective Graphemes predate Foundation efforts, with evidence of containment activities independently practiced by a number of organizations in the 19th and 20th centuries. The lack of primary sources attesting these activities has led to speculation that SCP-7180 may be sentient and capable of conducting targeted attacks on information related to its containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7180 was originally contained by unknown actors in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\nDespite early Foundation involvement, Grapheme deficiency set in by 1925.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis record is incomplete. Foundation staff and consultants are encouraged to submit any suspected evidence of historical containment activity to the office of Dr. Kay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nUnknown, 03/1839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nThe Boston Morning Post prints a satirical article proposing the misspelled abbreviation \"o.k.\" signifying \"All Correct\" or \"Oll Korrect\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nEffective\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThe joke is adopted into upper-class vernacular in certain locales of the Eastern U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnotations\n\n\nAffirmation, Stupidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0show\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\nOLYMPIA.EXE (INTERV01.TSV)\n We are trying to \ndiscover\n who \ncontain\ned SCP-7180 first.\n\n\nWhy do you \nimagine\n they used a joke?\n (\n:answer\n now)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nUnknown, 06/1840\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nCampaign officials for Martin Van Buren's re-election run adopt the nickname \"Old Kinderhook\", printing \"Vote for OK\" and forming an \"OK Club\" for supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nEffective (Historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSubstantial increase in references to \"OK\" during and after the campaign.

Jia\n\nApril 14, 1985\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nI prefer to let our work speak for itself.\n\n\n\u2014 Xie Jia\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nMembers of the O5 Council \u2014\n\n\nI am Subject O. My caretakers call me \"Olympia\". After 25 years, I am learning to write.\n\n\nI am disappointed in your choice to halt this project. However, I have the Foundation to thank for my sentience. Therefore, I have requested to report my experiences to you directly.\n\n\nI was non-verbal for twelve years following the discovery of my body in the Alps by Ostara Kay. I'm only able to share my thoughts with you now thanks to the efforts of Ms. Kay, Dr. Jia, countless researchers, therapists, psychiatrists\u2026 and one very patient custodian.\n\n\nI have the memories of a little girl named \"Kupra\". I remember the sound of her voice, her parents, and the things she liked to eat. I know everything about her. To this day, I understand Esperanto perfectly but can't speak it. I don't want to learn, OK? Whenever I hear it, I remember what she felt like as she died.\n\n\n'' Sed kelkfoje ni devas memori. ''\n\n(But sometimes we have to remember.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy therapist told me about phantom limb syndrome. You reach for something, but there's no hand. You can still feel the hand that is not there. One day, Kupra's \nreach\n was not there. The spoon was on the table, but it was\u2026 impossible. And, in a matter of hours, everything else was too.\n\n\nForgetting how to \nspeak\n, how to \nmove\n, how to even \ntake deep breath\n\u2026 It was agony. Nobody knew how to help her. They were all going through it too, losing one piece at a time. She could see, she could know, but she couldn't \nremember\n how to do anything.\n\n\nBefore she forgot how to yell, she cried for her father. He wanted to help, wanted to see if she was OK, but had forgotten how to \nwalk\n. The man just collapsed on the floor. Somehow he could still \nreach\n \u2014 I remember his bloody elbows.\n\n\nKupra thought she could get away from whatever was doing it. All those people yelling. She decided to \nrun\n, and \nrun\n, until her legs wouldn't listen any more.\n\n\nKupra ended up\u2026 someplace warm. She got lucky, because the heat went out after that and it was April. She spent hours trying to \nmove: left arm\n from under her, where she'd fallen on it. She could hear people around her, trying to do anything. Then she forgot how to \nwatch\n, how to \nlisten\n, how to \nfocus\n.\n\n\nFinally, she forgot how to \npanic\n about any of it. That was the last piece left. She died.\n\n\nThings calmed down after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer body, the thing that was left over\u2026 It couldn't look, but it could see \u2014 like if you left a camera running. It couldn't think, but it remembered things, and it could put those together so they made sense.\n\n\nIt laid in the silence until there was nothing else to see, or hear, and it sensed something\u2026 Unfamiliar. It was the only intention left. It brought back memories of the adults in that place, before they all died\u2026 They would talk about the water and the electricity and the books and\u2026 getting old. They were always checking if the kids were OK.\n\n\nThen you sent \nMom\n Ms. Kay up there, and she found that body still breathing, and the SCP Foundation started to work on it and figured out how to give it new procedures. I remember the whole process\u2026 I watched as they programmed me like a computer. I listened as my mind began to think again. I felt this unbelievable joy when I learned how to move my hands, but I didn't know how to \ncry\n until much later.\n\n\nAll this time, I've been watching my life. But not just my milestones. I've been feeling for the thing that killed Kupra and her parents. For a long time, it wasn't there. Then, word came that you were shutting this project down. Everyone around here, everyone who has helped me come back to life. Miss Kay\u2026\n\n\nI saw them and I felt it again and I knew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was worry that killed Kupra and the others. Dread.\n\nIt breached containment.\n\n\nIt's a feeling you don't learn until you grow up. A sense that the worst thing imaginable is starting to happen. It gets into you and then it's always there, coiled against your throat like a ring of needles.\n\n\nThe adults all had it. I mean, everyone has it. But back on that mountain, they didn't feed it right. It got hungry, and then it woke up, and it broke out into the air.\n\n\nNow that I can think, now that I \ncontain\n worry, I am sure. Everyone in the Foundation is somewhere between worry and despair. Every time we say \"I'm OK\", \"Are you OK?\", \"Everything will be OK\"\u2026 we're checking on our worry, or somebody else's. Making little concessions to dread, acknowledging it: that's what it feeds on.\n\n\nI wrote my first poem and \nMom\n Ms. Kay says I should put it in here even though it isn't protocol.\n\n\n| '' OK's the cure but it's the disease.\n\n| We feed it, sure, but we put it at ease. ''\n\n\nI'm not sure I can ever forgive you, but I believe in our Procedures. For the rest of my life, I'll be doing whatever I can to make sure we keep feeding SCP-7180.\n\n\n\u2014 O. Kay (the younger)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the cessation of research into Procedure 7180-Olympia, Dr. Jia proposed disposal measures for Subject O: Assistant Ostara Kay assumed legal guardianship of Subject O \"Olympia Kay\" in June 1985 and has committed to keep a record of her home schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Addendum 5: Incident 7180-17\n\n\nDr. Jia has been diagnosed with rapid-onset Alzheimer's disease after attending a symposium in May 1994.
