The containment unit is retrofitted with hydroelectric turbines, a high-grade generator, and a liquid dissipation unit. All maintenance of the containment unit will be enacted through automated systems; duplicate equipment is to be maintained in preparation for critical malfunctions. Power generated through SCP-5412 is utilized as the main power source for sublevels two through four.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe keg prior to becoming SCP-5412.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5412 is a beer keg currently influenced by a thaumaturgic process that sustains a recurring cycle of beer production. At a rate of approximately 65,708 liters per minute, SCP-5412 manifests the beer within its keg spear with a pressure of approximately 413,000\u00a0kPa. Though well beyond baseline keg parameters, SCP-5412 is capable of sustaining this volume and pressure indefinitely without incurring damage.\n\n\nSCP-5412 was created using a rudimentary thaumic dance ritual used by ancient nordic sei\u00f0ma\u00f0r. The ritual was originally created to refill beer or mead casks while supplies were low. It is theorized that incorrect movements and wording caused a deviation from the intended purpose of the ritual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\nVideo still frame of the ritual used to create SCP-5412.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5412 was created and activated by three students within a dormitory at Montclair State University on 2020/03/22. The Foundation was contacted by assets within the New Jersey State Police after approximately 60% of the university property was flooded with beer. After locating the source of the flood, the Foundation containment team successfully recovered SCP-5412. A concealment team subsequently enacted a cover story involving malfunctions at a local beer production plant causing a backflow into the local water supply. The following transcript was recovered from a video file depicting the creation and activation of SCP-5412:\n\n\n\n\n\u274f\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u2750\n\n\n\n\nDate | Time:\n 2020/03/22 | 05:36 GMT\n\n\nFeatured:\n Kyle Henning, Greg Moriarty, Phillip Henry\n\n\nForeword:\n The three students are located within their dormitory at MSU. Several hours of party footage has been removed for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[The camera is focused on SCP-5412, the cameraman's hand is holding the keg spout.]\n\n\nCameraman:\n Yo, Greg, we're out of beer!\n\n\n[Greg Moriarty enters the frame and takes the spout from the cameraman.]\n\n\nGreg:\n Shit, you right.\n\n\nCameraman:\n Store's probably closed by now too.\n\n\nGreg:\n Yo, Phil, let's do the thing.\n\n\n[The camera pans to shows Phillip Henry and Kyle Henning sitting on a couch.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n What's the point, everyone left, it's just us.\n\n\nGreg:\n Okay puss-puss, I guess you're tappin' out than.\n\n\nKyle:\n \n[Laughing]\n I'm with Greg, we're already fucked, no point in stopping now.\n\n\nPhillip:\n Fuck off, weren't you puking your guts out, like, an hour ago?\n\n\n[Kyle slouches onto Phillip's shoulder.]\n\n\nKyle:\n See yo\u2013 you don't got it right, man. I wasn't puking\u2013 I was just making some room for round fuckin' two!\n\n\n[Kyle begins laughing but abruptly stops, he runs over to a garbage can and vomits into it before slouching to the ground.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n Yeah, and I'm the pussy.\n\n\nGreg:\n Come on guys, suck up your broginas and let's get fucked up! We can go get breakfast after\u2013 my treat.\n\n\n[Phillip slaps his knees and sighs exaggeratedly as he stands up.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n Fine, let's do this shit.\n\n\n[Kyle jumps up from the floor next to tithe garbage can.]\n\n\nKyle:\n Fuck yeah, let's do it!\n\n\n[The two men stumble over to Greg.]\n\n\nCameraman:\n Uh, what are y'all doing anyway?\n\n\nKyle:\n Phil's parents are into all this occult shit, we learned some old Norse mojo from the junk they keep in their attic.\n\n\nCameraman:\n \n[Laughs.]\n Geez, y'all must be drunk.\n\n\nGreg:\n \n[Gesturing to the cameraman.]\n You, uh, you're gonna wanna step back.\n\n\n[The three students surround SCP-5412.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n Okay, on three. One\u2026 Two\u2026 Three!\n\n\n\n\nInitiation of the ritual.\n\n\n\n\n[The three students enact the ritual; their dance and incantations last for approximately nine minutes. The cameraman is laughing throughout the ritual.]\n\n\nKyle:\n Christ, all that spinning makes me wanna hurl again.\n\n\nGreg:\n That's cause you did it too fast, shit head.\n\n\nCameraman:\n I gotta say y'all, that was some of the downright gayest shit I've ever seen! \n[Continued laughter.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n Well, I guess you won't have to drink any than.\n\n\nCameraman:\n Drink what, my dude? That shit's tapped.\n\n\n[Phillip leans over and grabs the spout.]\n\n\nPhillip:\n Oh yeah?\n\n\n[Putting the spout to his mouth, Phillip activates it. The stream immediately removes his lower jaw, spraying blood on SCP-5412 and the other two students.]\n\n\nCameraman:\n Holy fuckin' shit.\n\n\nGreg:\n Phil!\n\n\n[Greg rushes to Phillip as he collapses to the ground, his grip loosens on the spout and the tube begins to whip erratically due to pressure. The stream hits Greg and bisects him from the groin to left shoulder.]\n\n\nCameraman:\n Watch out!\n\n\n[The camera drops as the cameraman runs out of the room; beer is now flooding the floor. As Kyle runs towards the door the stream intersects his right leg and severs it at the knee. Kyle falls to the ground and struggles to crawl towards the door; blood flows from his dismembered leg. The stream hits him in his posterior; the pressure ripping through his jeans, disintegrating his genitals and perineum. His mangled body slams into the wall, breaking his neck and spine.]\n\n\n[The room continues to fill with beer for 16 minutes, at which time the camera ceases operation.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe identity of the cameraman as well as the parents of Phillip Henry are currently under investigation. Cover Story W-5512 (\"Accidental Drowning\") was enacted to explain the deaths of the three students involved in the creation of SCP-5412.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5411\n | SCP-5412 | \nSCP-5413\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5412\n\" by DrAkimoto, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
