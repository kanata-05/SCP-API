Engineers are in the process of reworking or disabling all systems at risk due to SCP-7668. Scranton Reality Anchors are to be employed for situations where either becomes unfeasible.\n\n\nPersonnel from Site-94 are asked to wear warmer clothing for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7668 is a phenomenon currently affecting the entire interior area of Site-94, causing these spaces to invariably remain at exactly -1 degrees Celsius. Efforts to manually change this through non-anomalous measures have all failed.\n\n\nSCP-7668 exudes an ambient Hume level noticeably higher than average. Because of this, SCP-7668 has been found to be reliably dispellable with the application of Scranton Reality Anchor units. However, as these devices are both limited in quantity and are known to cause several hazardous health effects in personnel, their employment has been heavily regulated.\n\n\nAs such, Site Director Velkes has opted to leave all non-essential sections of Site-94 under the effects of SCP-7668 until further notice.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7668 manifested on 13/6/1990, shortly following an interview between a researcher and POI-7668, a known Ontokinetic that, at the time, was believed to be Class-I. It was quickly reclassified to Class-II.\n\n\nAttached below is an interview that took place with the researcher regarding this incident.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Senior Researcher Arnold Piedmont.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Guy California.\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\n[Senior Researcher Piedmont is seated in his office. He is visibly shivering, holding and rubbing both of his arms.]\n\n\n[Senior Researcher California enters the room.]\n\n\nCalifornia:\n Arnold. How are you doing today?\n\n\nPiedmont:\n I've been better, I can tell you that much. It's supposed to be the summer! I had to drag this coat out from the lost and found at my local church.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n Hmm. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\n\nPiedmont:\n Yeah, yeah, now what did you want?\n\n\nCalifornia:\n I wanted to talk to you about this whole\u2026\n\n\n[Piedmont ducks down and reaches under his desk, unplugging a portable heater. The temperature remains at -1\u00b0C as the device ceases blowing cold air out.]\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \nOrdeal\n, regarding what happened in that room. With the bender.\n\n\n[Piedmont mumbles to himself.]\n\n\nPiedmont:\n Just a - misunderstanding\u2026\n\n\nCalifornia:\n Excuse me?\n\n\n[Piedmont takes a deep breath before sitting back up.]\n\n\nPiedmont:\n It was all going normally - well, as normal as you could get. We had it all under control. \nEverything was just peachy\n.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026 Then what happened?\n\n\nPiedmont:\n It complained about the temperature. Said that it was too hot - it was a bit warm, really - in the room. I said that there was little I could do about it; oh, it didn't like that.\n\n\n[California peeks his head out from the small office and into the hallway, looking at a wet floor sign atop an iced-coffee matted floor.]\n\n\nCalifornia:\n So it turned the entire facility into a\u2026 winter wonderland out of revenge?\n\n\nPiedmont:\n Of course not! Or, at least it wouldn't have, had I kept my mouth shut.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n Elaborate, Arnold.\n\n\nPiedmont:\n Fine. It didn't like my response. Said I wasn't very kind. So, all I did was bring up the motto of the Foundation in how we treat our humanoids.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n You mean the five-by-five by-\n\n\nPiedmont:\n No, about our attitude towards our anomalies?\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026 what?\n\n\n[Piedmont inhales sharply.]\n\n\nPiedmont:\n I said that the Foundation is cold and uncompromising. There.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026\n\n\nPiedmont:\n \u2026\n\n\nCalifornia:\n That's it?\n\n\nPiedmont:\n Yep. That's, that's it.\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026\n\n\nPiedmont:\n \u2026\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026\n\n\nPiedmont:\n \u2026\n\n\nCalifornia:\n \u2026\n\n\nPiedmont:\n \u2026\n\n\n[California turns and exits the room, taking four seconds to do so.]\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n Junior Researcher Piedmont has been promptly demoted without amnestic treatment in accordance with standard Ethical Foundation protocol. As such, he has not been reassigned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7667\n | SCP-7668 | \nSCP-7669\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7668\n\" by Roufhous, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
