Thorley does not appear to notice.\n\n\nSCP-7195 rubs against Thorley's legs, purring.\n\n\nThorley:\n How'd you get in here?\n\n\nSCP-7195 purrs, meows, then continues purring.\n\n\nThorley recognizes the cat.\n\n\nThorley:\n Kitty cat?\n\n\nSCP-7195 ceases purring, meows, then jumps into Thorley's vacant lap.\n\n\nThorley:\n Oh! Ok.\n\n\nSCP-7195 resumes purring. Thorley gingerly pets the cat, and returns to work.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\nNotes: SCP-7195 remained on Alex Thorley until they stood up, at which point SCP-7195 exited from view and vanished.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7195.3:\n Third Encounter, \nSite-58\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nThorley is about to eat a microwaved salami and cheese sandwich. The ingredients used to make the sandwich have not yet been put away.\n\n\nAs they are about to take a bite, a meow is heard.\n\n\nThorley:\n Hey kitty.\n\n\nSCP-7195 sits on the floor near Thorley, looks up expectantly, and meows.\n\n\nThorley:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-7195 meows an extended meow which dips into a lower pitch before returning to normal.\n\n\nThorley:\n Food? I don't have cat food\u2026 Salami?\n\n\nThorley rips a tiny piece of salami from the salami package, and feeds it to SCP-7195. SCP-7195 eats the salami.\n\n\nThorley picks their sandwich back up, readying to bite it.\n\n\nSCP-7195 meows in the same manner as previously.\n\n\nThorley sets down the sandwich.\n\n\nThorley:\n I'm sorry.\n\n\nThorley stands up.\n\n\nThorley:\n I'll go get some. Be right back.\n\n\nThorley exits the office, glancing back at SCP-7195 as they do.\n\n\nOnce Thorley has exited, SCP-7195 jumps onto their desk.\n\n\nSCP-7195 sniffs their sandwich, then the component ingredients.\n\n\nSCP-7195 begins chewing on a bag of bagels.\n\n\nSCP-7195 breaches the bagel sack, taking a single bite of every bagel, then exits from view.\n\n\nThorley returns with a bag of cat food.\n\n\nThorley notices the lack of a cat.\n\n\nThorley:\n Kitty?\n\n\nThorley fails to find SCP-7195, but notices the bitemarks on their bagel, consistent with a feline of SCP-7195's size.\n\n\nThorley throws away the damaged bagels.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\nNotes: Following this encounter Liaison Thorley purchased cat food, a food bowl, a water bowl, a litter box, cat litter, and cat toys in anticipation of the next encounter.\n\n\nLiaison Thorley also received pet care tips from the Department of Zoological Studies Vice Chair Dr. Faran Caraway and was able to subsequently determine that SCP-7195 was male and had been neutered.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the previous log SCP-7195 began to visit Alex Thorley's office more frequently, and for longer durations, often eating, playing, or keeping Liaison Thorley company.\n\n\n[7 logs redacted for brevity]\n\n\nAddendum 7195.4:\n Eighteenth Encounter, \nSite-87\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nThorley is emptying a box. SCP-7195 is grooming himself nearby.\n\n\nThorley has emptied the box. SCP-7195 investigates the empty box, walking inside.\n\n\nThorley playfully shuts the box. Meowing is heard.\n\n\nThorley opens the box. SCP-7195 is no longer visible.\n\n\nThorley is visibly confused.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\nNotes: Liaison Thorley has been unable to usher SCP-7195 into a cat carrier for veterinary check-ups or anomaly testing, as SCP-7195 will become impossible to locate. However, visitors have observed no difference between SCP-7195 and a healthy baseline cat.\n\n\nThorley has similarly been unable to equip SCP-7195 with a collar or tracking chip, though SCP-7195 has allowed the administration and application of medical care by Thorley when needed.\n\n\n\n\n[5 logs redacted for brevity]\n\n\nAddendum 7195.5:\n Twenty-third Encounter, \nSite-18\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nThorley is asleep in their quarters.\n\n\nThe sound of glass breaking is heard. The sound wakes Thorley.\n\n\nThorley:\n \"Kitty?!\"\n\n\nThorley investigates and finds the freestanding mirror fell over and shattered. Thorley requisitions a broom and sweeps up the mess.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\nNotes: SCP-7195 appeared the following day unharmed.
