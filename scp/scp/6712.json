Sigma-42 is also tasked with amnesticizing witnesses and discrediting evidence of the manifestation events. Stationary Task Force Epsilon-12 (\"Settlers\") is to play only one legal turn of SCP-6712 before returning it to Universe #UA-90B-6712 and preparing for another manifestation event. Under absolutely no circumstances is Epsilon-12 permitted to cheat.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6712 is a copy of the multiplayer boardgame \nCatan\n that randomly manifests on Earth after being returned to Universe #UA-90B-6712. Upon manifestation, one turn of the game will have been completed by the \"opponent.\" The tiles and wooden pieces of the game have been hot glued to a sheet of cardboard while the cards and leftover pieces remain in the box. A sticky note reading \"Site-89 Break Room\" has been placed on the box.\n\n\nDuring a manifestation event, a small orb of blue-white plasma emitting arcs of electricty will appear at a point on Earth. The orb will remain for approximately 30 seconds, illuminating the surrounding area and scorching any nearby material, before dissipating. In its place will be SCP-6712.\n\n\nAs of 14/7/2021, the game is at too early of a state for a winner to be properly predicted. The score is currently predicted to be 5 Victory Points to 3, opponent leads.\n\n\nAddendum 6712.1:\n Creation\n\n\nWhile researching the efficacy of extrauniversal travel at Site-89 in West Virginia, a faulty generator caused the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Apparatus to become overactive. In the process of shutting the Apparatus down, the entire East Wing of Site-89 including the break room was lost. Located in the break room was a copy of \nCatan\n used by personnel for entertainment.\n\n\nApproximately three days later, SCP-6712 spontaneously manifested in Moab, Utah where it was recontained by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\"). All witnesses were amnesticized.\n\n\nSCP-6712 initially manifested with one white road and one white settlement piece placed on the board. Due to the interest in researching extrauniversal entities capable of extrauniversal travel, a blue road and blue settlement piece were placed and returned to #UA-90B-6712. SCP-6712 continously remanifested until its current game state.\n\n\nAddendum 6712.2:\n Notable Events\n\n\n19/4/2021:\n A \"7\" was apparently rolled by the opponent and a card was taken from Epsilon-12's hand upon manifestation in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\n12/5/2021:\n Epsilon-12 traded resources for a \"Development Card\", obtaining a \"Year of Plenty\" card.\n\n\n14/5/2021:\n The opponent obtained the \"Longest Road\" card upon manifestation in Perth, Australia. Opponent leads 4 Victory Points to 2.\n\n\n31/5/2021:\n SCP-6712 manifested in Shenzen, China with a handwritten note reading:\n\n\n\n\nTwo wood for one brick?\n\n\n\n\nOne \"brick\" resource card was placed with the note before being returned. SCP-6712 then manifested in Manila, Philippines with two \"wood\" resource cards in Epsilon-12's hand. This is the only time the opponent has communicated in relation to the game mechanics.\n\n\n2/6/2021:\n Epsilon-12 replaced one of their settlement pieces with a city piece. Opponent leads 4 Victory Points to 3.\n\n\n29/6/2021:\n A \"7\" was apparently rolled by the opponent and a card was taken from Epsilon-12's hand upon manifestation in Jardin, Colombia. The opponent also traded resources for a \"Development Card\". Opponent possibly leads 5 Victory Points to 3.\n\n\n1/7/2021:\n Epsilon-12 handwrote a note asking to trade one \"sheep\" resource card for one \"stone\" resource card before being returned. Upon SCP-6712's manifestation in Amsterdam, Netherlands, the cards were traded from Epsilon-12's hand.\n\n\n3/7/2021:\n Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 took a resource card from the opponent's hand much to the dismay of his colleagues, in which he responded with offense. When SCP-6712 was returned, Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's skull spontaneously exploded, terminating him. SCP-6712 manifested a few hours later in Site-01 with only one road piece placed and a handwritten note reading:\n\n\n\n\nPlease don't do that. :(\n\n\n\n\nThe stolen card was immediately placed back in the opponent's hand, and Epsilon-12's turn was passed as a gesture of goodwill. SCP-6712 has yet to remanifest.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6711\n | SCP-6712 | \nSCP-6713\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6712\n\" by Dr Asteria, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
