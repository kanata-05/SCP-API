Although this action initially appears as irrational, it will result in numerous anomalous effects beneficial to the subject (hereinafter referred to as SCP-7052-1). These effects typically manifest within five to ten minutes after the insertion. The anomalies vary, although the following effects are always present:\n\n\n\nIncreased sexual attraction towards SCP-7052-1 affecting people of gender based on SCP-7052-1's sexual orientation\n1\n\n\nImprovement of SCP-7052-1's physical and mental abilities\n\n\nSudden healing of SCP-7052-1's wounds, infections, and carcinomas\n\n\nVarious ontokinetic effects that result in the enhancement of luck in SCP-7052-1's life - such as higher probability of winning lotteries and other chance-based competitions\n\n\nImprovement in mood\n\n\n\n\nThe intensity of these effects depends on the depth of the insertion, as well as the number and size of spoons inserted. The most intense effects, reported at 12 standard silverware spoons, had strong ontokinetic properties. This instance, referred to as SCP-7052-1-9, was formerly a D-class member known as D-952674 (see Addendum-2).\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n List of known instances of SCP-7052-1 (excluding D-class personnel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of discovery\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/08/2015\n\n\nMoscow\n\n\nMonitored; a successful Russian wrestler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/22/2016\n\n\nSite-19\n\n\nAn adult film actress; contained due to apparent anomalies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/19/2018\n\n\nSite-19\n\n\nA researcher at Site-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/20/2018\n\n\nSite-19\n\n\nA researcher at Site-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/15/2020\n\n\nPortland, OR\n\n\nMonitored; an American bus driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/15/2022\n\n\nOsaka\n\n\nMonitored; a Japanese billionaire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/27/2022\n\n\nSite-83\n\n\nA criminal; contained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/01/2022\n\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n\nA former researcher at Site-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2:\n\n\nIncident Iota\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n D-952674\n\n\nProcedure:\n Experimentation with high-intensity SCP-7052\n\n\nResults:\n D-952674 had to be terminated due to extreme anomalies.\n\n\nReport:\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lorenz:\n You will enter this room.
