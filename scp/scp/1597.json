If possible, the object\u2019s active state should be observed solely by camera recording, due to its aversion to humans. When personnel successfully manage to start conversation with the object, they are to utilize casual tone. Research is currently underway to discover methods by which SCP-1597 can be forced into its active state.\n\n\nIf the object resists interaction, testing, or attempts to escape, it is to be doused with water. Paperweights have been placed directly outside of the object's containment area in order to immobilize it during testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1597 is a wool blanket measuring 2m by 1m. The object can be used comfortably as a non-anomalous blanket; however, if used for more than approximately ten (10) minutes at a time, a high pitched crying will emanate from the object and continue until SCP-1597 is able to enter into an active state.\n\n\nSCP-1597\u2019s active state consists of the object becoming animate and autonomously moving through levitation. During this active state, SCP-1597 displays signs of sapience and an aversion to most subjects that are older than approximately ten (10) years of age and will often cease animation if such a subject approaches it. However, through repeated exposure and tactfulness, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been successful in gaining SCP-1597\u2019s trust and communicating with it. For the purposes of coaxing the object into conversation, the aforementioned personnel are allowed to refer to the object with its stated name, Zoey, as well as maintaining a slightly more casual tone when addressing it.\n\n\nInterview Log-1597-Alpha:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-1597\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hello, Zoey.\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n \n[laughs]\n Hello, Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588!\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How are you doing today?\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n \n[Object moves in a circular formation approximately 1m off of the ground before returning to Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.]\n That\u2019s how I feel today.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That\u2019s excellent, Zoey. Are you ready to talk about why you don\u2019t usually like grown-ups today?\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n \n[Object remains stationary for approximately thirty (30) seconds before vocalizing.]\n Maybe just a little. I don\u2019t like them \u2018cause they took me away. They\u2019re bad people.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Took you away from what, sweetie?\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n Everything, mo\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I mean Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s okay. What did they do?\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n \n[Object once again remains stationary for approximately two (2) minutes.]\n I don\u2019t know, I shut my eyes because it was scary. All I saw were a buncha people in coats like yours that were all around me, and then I just shut my eyes, and I think I fell asleep. I heard a lotta whispering though, and a lot of cold, metal things kept touching my arms and legs. I woke up and I couldn\u2019t see myself no more. All I had was my blanket.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n Hey\u2026 you guys wouldn\u2019t do anything like that to me, would you?\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Of course not, Zoey.\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n I\u2019m glad.\n\n\nDoctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Well, I think that\u2019s all for today. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\n\n\nSCP-1597:\n Okay. I love you.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reportedly preemptively powered off the recording device due to the fact that she believed the session to be over, and nothing of importance occurred after the cessation of the log. These statements were confirmed by the security personnel present.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher\u2019s note: Due to the risk of causing SCP-1597 to become completely unresponsive and mistrustful towards all Foundation personnel, including myself and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I hereby request no unnecessary testing other than interviews take place at the current time.\n - Doctor Adelaide \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSite Director\u2019s note: Granted.\n - Site Director Roger Langley\n\n\nAddendum-1597-Xi:\n Doctor and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were confirmed to be dead as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588 when SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 breached containment.

Through trial-and-error, it was determined that liquids, especially water, were effective in disrupting the object's ability to levitate.
