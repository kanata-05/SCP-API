A radius of 1.5\u00a0km has been established as an exclusionary zone around the area, and a 3-meter-tall fence lines the circumference. Security personnel are to patrol the perimeter on a bi-hourly basis, with cameras constantly surveying the surrounding area.\n\nSCP-8423 is to be contained within a 5m x 5m x 5m steel cube, with 2.5 meters above and below ground level. The containment chamber is to be fitted with a six (6) door air lock system, with incineration capabilities in each of the six (6) individual chambers. Should any single airlock fail at any point, the chambers shall undergo decontamination as described in document 8423- F-31c:\n\n\n\n\nAll airlocks will initiate incineration sequence for a period of thirty (30) minutes, regardless of personnel located within.\n\n\nAirlocks will be flooded with Hydrogen Peroxide, which will sit for a period of no less than twenty-four (24) hours before draining.\n\n\nAirlocks will be flooded with boiling salt water for no less than twelve (12) hours before draining.\n\n\nAirlocks are flushed with boiling, soapy water.\n\n\nHazmat teams will enter airlocks and decide whether decontamination is sufficient. Regardless of decontamination status, hazmat teams are to incinerate all clothes worn into airlocks after exiting.\n\n\nThis process will be repeated at least two (2) times, with further decontamination at the discretion of area staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea-87 Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny personnel who enter SCP-8423\u2019s containment chamber are required to wear IDLH certified self-contained air supply SCBA respirators and level A hazard totally-encapsulating hazmat suits. Personnel returning from interaction with SCP-8423 must quarantine for two weeks in a room with a monitoring camera, closed airflow system and incineration capabilities. If any personnel are suspected of disregarding any one of these directives they are to be terminated immediately by incineration.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8423 is a fungus similar in appearance to \nPsilocybin Semilanceata\n1\n. SCP-8423 growths average around 3.0\u00a0cm in diameter; growths have been recorded to grow up to 3.4\u00a0cm. Growths are notable for their conical bell-shaped cap with a small white spot on the peak. The colour of the growth ranges from brown to a rust-like colour. The stipes appear long and slender, some recording up to 10\u00a0cm in height, however, most range from 5-7\u00a0cm on average. Stipes range from dirty white to light brown. The lamella\n2\n to stipe is adnexed\n3\n, with the lamella changing from white to black as they mature. Spores are completely transparent. Foundation mycologists estimate the spores to be roughly 10.5-11.5 x 6.5-7.0 micrometers and ellipsoid in shape. SCP-8423 exhibits saprotrophic ecology and can grow without access to sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsilocybin Semilanceata\n. Images of SCP-8423 are classified under protocol GT-83d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8423 demonstrates high resistance to extreme cold and heat, with research indicating it is capable of withstanding temperatures as low as -\u2588\u2588\u02daC and as high as \u2588\u2588\u02daC.\n\n\nSCP-8423 is not biologically related to any other documented fungi, and is theorized to be native to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Growths spread through the use of airborne spores. Infection by SCP-8423 occurs when a subject, referred to as SCP-8423-1, inhales spores emitted by SCP-8423 or SCP-8423-1 instances. SCP-8423 spores then enter the brain, where they begin to grow and feed implanted in the brain cavity. Infection from SCP-8423 occurs in seven (7) identifiable stages:\n\n\n\n\nSubject inhales spores of SCP-8423.\n\n\nSpores enter the subject's brain cavity, latching on. Subject is now considered SCP-8423-1.\n\n\nSubject will begin to feel smarter, stronger and clear-headed for a period of 1-3 months. Notably, patients with dementia and Alzheimer's report being completely cured of all affliction. Cognitive scans confirm that Alzheimer's and dementia symptoms cease.\n\n\nSubjects begin to become obsessive with the preservation and spread of SCP-8423.\n\n\nSubjects will begin to exhibit [REDACTED].\n\n\nSubjects will root into the ground and emit SCP-8423 spores into the air, with a range of up to \u2588 kilometers.\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the lifecycle for SCP-8423-1 instances is roughly 6 months. SCP-8423 first came to Foundation attention when reports coming out of the [REDACTED] province began reporting [REDACTED] on local wildlife, and increasingly aggressive territorial behaviour from the affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 4/8423 CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/8423 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Enter\u00a0valid\u00a04/8423\u00a0credentials\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\nCredentials\u00a0validated\u00a0-\u00a0Welcome,\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Operation Closed Canal\n-Hide Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisors Note\n\nBelow are a transcription of the video logs from the late Dr. Edward Zhang during his initial research into SCP-8423.

The current date is June 6th, 2022. We are currently in the town of [DATA EXPUNGED] regarding reports of wildlife exhibiting anomalous behaviours.\n\n\nDr. Abarca hands Dr. Zhang a file folder. Dr. Zhang removes a sheet of paper from the folder and begins to read it.\n\n\nZhang:\n Yes, that's right. Okay. Foundation operatives had begun receiving reports of wildlife exhibiting anomalous behavior, namely that most local wildlife has begun exhibiting signs of, quote unquote, 'large fungal growths and increasingly aggressive and territorial behaviours, so much so that local townsfolk cannot enter the surrounding rainforest without risk of assault by wildlife.' And we're here to see if this stuff is anomalous, or, you know, just fungus.\n\n\nDr. Abarca:\n Yeah, and to add to that, Edward, the main thing we're here to do is to see if whatever this is can affect humans. So far, only signs of animal infection are present.\n\n\nZhang:\n Right. We'll be interviewing the local population, as well as taking blood samples, and, if needed, body scans. We are to operate under the guise that we're medical staff from the [REDACTED] government sent as a temporary hospital set up. We're way out in the fucking sticks here, so if any of these country bumpkins suspect anything I'd be shocked. Anyhow, there's plenty of work to be done here. I'll keep the log updated periodically.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log 02 Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 07/06/2022\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8423\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Edward Zhang\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Dr. Manuel Abarca, Agent Jarron Hellebuyck, Agent Lupita Rodriguez\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Zhang can be seen sitting at a table, with a middle aged man, dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt sitting across from him.

Water, coffee, tea?\n\n\nS:\n I'm fine.\n\n\nThe subject appears to be incredibly uncomfortable, shifting in seat and glancing around\n\n\nS:\n Jesus, what's that smell? It smells like death.\n\n\nZ:\n that's just the smell of sterilization, I believe, we have to keep things clean here, you know? Don't want any germs getting around.\n\n\nS:\n Um, yeah, makes sense.\n\n\nZ:\n So, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, how are you feeling? Any sickness, aches, mental fog?\n\n\nS:\n Believe it or not, no. I mean, I know I look rough, but, I feel great. Amazing actually.\n\n\nZ:\n Really? Would you care to elaborate on that?\n\n\nS:\n That's not enough for you? Christ, are you city hacks dim? I feel great, end of story.\n\n\nZ:\n Apologies for pressing, sir.

I just need a blood sample from you. it'll just be a prick on the finger.\n\n\nThe subject appears to be alarmed by the request.\n\n\nS:\n Fuck, um, yeah, sure. Just be quick.\n\n\nDr. Zhang walks across the room, grabbing the necessary equipment and returning to seat with the subject. He pricks the subjects finger, taking a small blood sample. A drop of blood falls on the table. Dr. Zhang grabs a Lysol wipe to remove the spot.\n\n\nS:\n [Screams]\n\n\nThe subject jumps up, sprinting out of the room.

Zhang and Abarca can be seen sitting at a table, with an elderly woman sitting across from them. The womans posture and demeanor appear far more youthful than his age would indicate. Please note that this log has been transcribed from [REDACTED] into English.\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, correct?\n\n\nSubject:\n That's right, dear.\n\n\nZ:\n Now, we talked to your granddaughter, and-\n\n\nS:\n Oh, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588! Such a beautiful young woman, isn't she? I still remember how she used to-\n\n\nDr. Abarca:\n Ma'am, not to be rude, but we're not here to discuss your granddaughter.\n\n\nS:\n Oh dear me, I'm sorry doctors! Forgive an old woman her ramblings.\n\n\nZ:\n No need to apologize Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Now, as I was saying, your granddaughter tells us you previously were suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease until about three months ago. Is that correct?\n\n\nS:\n Oh, yes dear, yes. Truly awful thing, but then one day not three months ago, I woke up and poof! Gone! I could walk, talk, think and felt like I was 30 years younger. God truly is good.\n\n\nZ:\n Interesting. Now, could you tell us what happened before this seeming miracle happened? Anything out of the ordinary in the days leading up?\n\n\nS:\n Oh, nothing, nothing. I just went on my walks as usual, and had tea with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as per usual.\n\n\nZ:\n Where did you take these walks?\n\n\nS:\n Just out in the forest, on the path. Found some interesting little mushrooms out there, I did. Never seen the likes of them out there before. But, can't go in the forest no more because of the animals going crazy. Let me tell you\u2026..\n\n\nThe subject proceeded to go on a fifteen minute rant about how the younger generations are screwing everything up and are too soft. Attempts at cutting the subject off were unsuccessful. After the interview, Agents Hellebuyck and Rodriguez were sent into the rainforest to collect samples of fungus. During this time, they would also recover a half-eaten bird, which displayed symptoms of infection from SCP-8423.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Days 4-8\n- June 09 - June 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log 04 Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 13/06/2022\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8423\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Edward Zhang\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Dr. Manuel Abarca, Agent Jarron Hellebuyck, Agent Lupita Rodriguez\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Zhang can be seen taking a seat at a desk. He pulls a file folder out of a drawer. Dr. Abarca enters frame, sitting next to him.\n\n\nDr. Zhang:\n Lots of new developments since the log was last updated. The samples Jarron and Lupita collected were interesting, to say the least. The samples we collected we initially thought were Psilocybin Semilanceata-\n\n\nDr. Abarca:\n You mean shrooms.\n\n\nBoth researchers laugh briefly.\n\n\nZ:\n Sure, whatever hippie shit you want to call them. Shrooms, magic mushrooms, whatever. Anyway, the point is they were not Psilocybin Semilanceata, testing shows they're a whole new thing. We checked the data against the foundation database, and these little shits aren't related to any other fungi that anyone has found. Hell, they're not related to any plants either. They don't appear to produce spores, either - not that I've seen at least, unless they're transparent, which I'm not ruling out. Now Manuel will report on the human and animal side of things.\n\n\nA:\n Right. Well, after running blood samples and the like, we've determined that this fungus can infect humans. We tested the samples of the fungi against samples of the blood we collected, and oh boy, is it ever there. We've been wearing respirators since, which we hope is enough. As for that bird that Hellebuyck and Rodriguez found, what a scare. The things organs, brain, basically the entire body was covered in fungus. The thing was more fungus than animal. Anyway, we've been running brain scans on patients, and this thing is impressive. On average, this thing is increasing cognition rates by [REDACTED] percent. We also scanned the old woman's brain, Mrs\u2026. well, I forget now, but the old woman who had Alzheimer's. No signs of it at all. The most worrying part is\u2026 well, Edward, you can say if you'd like.\n\n\nZ:\n Sure. This thing is in people's brain. Scans are showing that the fungus plants itself into the brain and slowly spreads. People at around the three month mark have around ninety percent of their brain covered in the fungus. These patients who are further along also have begun showing fungal growths themselves, usually in the damper and darker areas of the body - think the armpits and groin area - however some people demonstrate growths around the face, particularly the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. For an unknow reason, no one in the town seem to point this out, or notice at all. Our current theory is those infected simply ignore the fact that the growths are happening - which would mean this entire damn town is infected. I've sent reports off to site command to close down this whole area if possible. If this thing spreads out of here, I don't know what we'll be able to do. But, we'll keep at work. Secure, contain, protect and all that shit.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Days 9-11\n- June 14 - June 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Log 05 Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 15/06/2022\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8423\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Edward Zhang\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Dr. Manuel Abarca, Agent Jarron Hellebuyck, Agent Lupita Rodriguez\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Zhang can be seen sitting in his room, appearing disheveled.

A radius of 1.5\u00a0km has been established as an exclusionary zone around the area, and a 3-meter-tall fence lines the circumference. Security personnel are to patrol the perimeter on a bi-hourly basis, with cameras constantly surveying the surrounding area.\nSCP-8423 is to be contained within a 5m x 5m x 5m steel cube, with 2.5 meters above and below ground level. The containment chamber is to be fitted with a six (6) door air lock system, with incineration capabilities in each of the six (6) individual chambers. Should any single airlock fail at any point, the chambers shall undergo decontamination as described in document 8423- F-31c:",
    "description": "SCP-8423 is a fungus similar in appearance to Psilocybin Semilanceata1. SCP-8423 growths average around 3.0\u00a0cm in diameter; growths have been recorded to grow up to 3.4\u00a0cm. Growths are notable for their conical bell-shaped cap with a small white spot on the peak. The colour of the growth ranges from brown to a rust-like colour. The stipes appear long and slender, some recording up to 10\u00a0cm in height, however, most range from 5-7\u00a0cm on average. Stipes range from dirty white to light brown. The lamella2 to stipe is adnexed3, with the lamella changing from white to black as they mature. Spores are completely transparent. Foundation mycologists estimate the spores to be roughly 10.5-11.5 x 6.5-7.0 micrometers and ellipsoid in shape. SCP-8423 exhibits saprotrophic ecology and can grow without access to sunlight.",
