The anomaly may be downloaded but after that the computer must be entirely quarantined.\n\n\nMETATRON.aic is to scan the internet for instances of SCP-7756, taking down any posting that includes the anomalous file. Given the nature and content of the anomaly, this represents a significant threat to Normalcy and the continued operation of the Foundation behind the Veil Protocol.\n\n\nSCP-7756 must only be accessed by those with a high rating of memetic resistance; any researchers wanting to perform tests or access the anomaly must rate at least 4.9 on the Cognitive Resistance Value scale.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-7756 is an online digital security seminar produced and distributed by GOI-5889 (\u201c\nVikander-Kneed Technical Media\n\u201d) entitled \u201cThere\u2019s No Place Like Home\u2026 Land Security.\u201d The anomaly has been found linked to a number of posts on Reddit and other social media sites in the context of digital security. An account with username of VKTMNarrator has responded to numerous comments and posts on social media with links to the anomaly. The storage of SCP-7756 has been difficult to locate, even with the use of AICs \u2013 the link appears as \nhomelandsecurity.vktm.org\n, but no such website exists.\n\n\nThe content of the seminar includes sensitive data and images concerning the nature of the Veil in general and the SCP Foundation in specific. More importantly, those who access the link and participate in the seminar are subject to a significant memetic compulsion to do as the seminar instructs. Usually this results in completing the seminar without incident, but in one notable case it led to the arrest of a man in Detroit, Michigan for murder.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nADDENDUM 7756.1 \u2013 Testing Log\n\n\n\n\n[Dr. Lillihammer\n1\n turns on the dedicated laptop and activates the link to SCP-7756, downloading the file, and then engaging the security protocols to air-gap the device from SCiPNet. As soon as the laptop is secure and disconnected from outside sources, the starting screen of SCP-7756 flashes open in a window without any input by Lillihammer.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Great, off to a good start.\n\n\n[The screen is suddenly overlaid with persistent weak static, but the cursor continues to operate as per normal. Lillihammer clicks on the image, starting the security presentation.]\n\n\n[On the screen a video appears of a computer monitor wrapped in barbed wire and set against the backdrop of a burning apartment building. A voice begins speaking on the recording.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: Welcome to \u201cThere\u2019s No Place Like Home\u2026Land Security,\u201d Vikander-Kneed\u2019s newest excursion in media excellence!

And clearly you can hear me, Mari!\n\n\nNarrator\n: Let\u2019s get started with the seminar!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Also, the sound isn\u2019t coming from the laptop. It\u2019s just surrounding me.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Please click on the next slide!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: That won\u2019t work on me.\n\n\nNarrator\n: \n[Sighing]\n Okay. What do you want to continue?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Admit who you are.\n\n\nNarrator\n: There\u2019s No Place Like Home\u2026Land Security.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: We can do this all day, or you can play it straight with me. Up to you.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Fine.

How do you even know these things?\n\n\nNarrator\n: No idea what you\u2019re talking about. Look, I don\u2019t have all day and we\u2019ve got at least forty-five more minutes left in this presentation before the quiz. Can we get started?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: There\u2019s a quiz?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Of course, there\u2019s a quiz! How else are we supposed to know if you\u2019ve learned the lessons of digital security? Anything else? Or can I start?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Go ahead.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Thank you. \n[Clears throat.]\n In order to reinforce the primary concepts of Digital Security, we\u2019re going to cover six areas where we think \nyour\n company\u2019s practices can be improved\u2026\n\n\n\n\nFifteen minutes of footage are omitted for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[When prompted, Lillihammer clicks through to the third slide.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: What just happened?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Time moves when we\u2019re having fun!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: It took you a quarter hour to read less than a hundred words!\n\n\nNarrator\n: Next slide!\n\n\n\n\n[Lillihammer sighs. She begins to tap her fingers against the surface of the desk in a rhythmic fashion. Several minutes pass.

Jesus, what time is it? Where am I?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Are you going to read the slide?\n\n\nNarrator\n: You can read this time.\n\n\n[Lillihammer\u2019s fist clenches on the desk next to the laptop.

What do you do instead?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Classified.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Oh, come on, tell me. We\u2019re girlfriends! Spill!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: We. Are. Not.

Next slide!\n\n\n\n\n[The Narrator reads the slide without editorializing.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: What does that have to do with digital security?\n\n\nNarrator\n: What do you mean? You shouldn\u2019t reveal company secrets, that\u2019s the simple baseline of all digital security.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: It\u2019s actually possible to divulge secrets without using any technology, you know?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Sounds like someone who has some experience in divulging company secrets!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I repeat, what does this have to do with digital security? I swear to god Mari, I will shut this laptop down and go home.\n\n\n[The Narrator whispers something unintelligible.]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: What was that?\n\n\nNarrator\n: \nThis was a contract gig.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Is this almost over?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Nope! Next slide!\n\n\n\n\nApproximately ten minutes omitted for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[The presentation proceeds through half a dozen slides concerning the identification of phishing emails. Throughout the presentation, the internal Site-43 SCiPNet message system is utilized as visual examples.]\n3\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I\u2019m a memeticist, I know how to spot a fucking phishing email. This presentation is literally killing me.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Can you describe the pain you\u2019re experiencing? On a scale from one to ten, how bad is the pain?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Next slide!\n\n\n[Several slides are moved through in silence, explaining the process by which one should dismember and hide the remains of a human body. Neither the narrator nor Dr. Lillihammer speak during this period. The slides contain the following information: \u201c1) Wrap the body in plastic tightly, several layers of food plastic wrap would be best.\n4\n 2) Using a serrated cutting implement, disconnect the feet, hands and head.\n5\n 3) Place the wrapped bundles in a bathtub or large plastic vat, pour hydrochloric acid over the top.\n6\n 4) Take the leftovers and mix with lye, then bury in your neighbor\u2019s back yard. 5) Repeat.\n7\n\u201d]\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Jesus, was that a threat?\n\n\nNarrator\n: What do you mean?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: You\u2019re using comatose or dead Foundation personnel of note as examples of how to dismember a fucking body. So, is that a threat?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Those were actors, VKTM makes entertainment not snuff films!\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I\u2019ve met Clef, that was Clef. Granted, he\u2019s unpleasant but this feels targeted.\n\n\nNarrator\n: No no no. Come on. You\u2019re suspending your disbelief a little too intensely, Lillian.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: What are you talking about?\n\n\nNarrator\n: I\u2019m going to the next slide.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: No, explain what you meant.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Special effects! That\u2019s what I meant.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Special effects?\n\n\nNarrator\n: Squibs! CGI! That sorta thing.\n\n\n[Lillihammer sits silently.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: I\u2019m moving onto the next slide.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Whatever.\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Come on! What about that?\n\n\nNarrator\n: We are pretty scared of PETA.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I hate this assignment.\n\n\nNarrator\n: It\u2019s ok, because it\u2019s time for that quiz!\n\n\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Wasn\u2019t there another section left?\n\n\nNarrator\n: I don\u2019t think so.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Yeah, \u201cKeeping your systems up to date.\u201d\n\n\nNarrator\n: Do you keep your computer updated?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Yes.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Great! I\u2019d say that\u2019s a lesson learned. Ready for a quiz?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: Just get it over with.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Love that energy.\n\n\n\n\nNarrator\n: What do you think? Pick the most correct answer.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: \u2026\n\n\nNarrator\n: Well?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: \u2026\n\n\nNarrator\n: Jesus, come on. Aren\u2019t going to guess?\n\n\nLillihammer\n: It\u2019s D!\n\n\nNarrator\n: Oh, I\u2019m sorry! But we would have accepted any of the answers A, B, or C. D is obviously the wrong answer.\n\n\nLillihammer\n: I know.\n\n\nNarrator\n: Next Question!\n\n\n\n\n[Lillihammer gets up from the computer, turns out the light in the testing chamber and exits the room.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: Well, what do you think?\n\n\n[Roughly thirty seconds pass.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: Come on, Lillian. It\u2019s the last question!\n\n\n[Roughly thirty seconds pass.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: Lillian?\n\n\n[Roughly thirty seconds pass.]\n\n\nNarrator\n: Hello?\n\n\n\n\nEND OF LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+100\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Highly resistant to memetics, Dr. Lillihammer has been assessed with a Cognitive Resistance Value so high that she is practically immune to memetic effects.\n\n\n2\n. During the presentation Wettle\u2019s password is revealed to be 321passowrd! \n[sic]\n The Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43 issued Dr. Wettle a citation for mandatory password strength training. Afterward, his password was changed to 456letshitthebricks@$$. This was found to be acceptable.\n\n\n3\n. At one point, an email by Site Director Allan McInnis is shown being written in real time through use of a video file embedded in a slide. Dr. Lillihammer paused the test to contact the Director and confirm the contents of his email. Those sections of the recording have been omitted from the official record as well as from this transcript.\n\n\n4\n. A video of a comatose Dr. Alto Clef slowly being wrapped in thin sheets of plastic then bound in duct tape plays in this slide.\n\n\n5\n. A pair of hands grip the body and places a \nhacksaw\n against the left ankle and then begins to saw back and forth until the limb is detached from the leg. The video then plays through a montage of further cuts until both feet, hands and the head are detached.\n\n\n6\n. The video plays at ten times speed as the body parts are slowly dissolved.\n\n\n7\n. A line of bodies is panned over, including Dr. William Wettle, Director Sophia Light, Dr. Dan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7756\n\" by Grigori Karpin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
