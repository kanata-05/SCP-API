SCP-6629-A is to be kept in an electronically-timed safe in Director Hammond\u2019s office. Personnel are forbidden from accessing either object outside of testing.\n\n\nAddendum_6629-01:\n As of 08/15/2024, inquiries to the Ethics Committee or the Decommissioning Department on the pursuit of the total cessation of SCP-6629\u2019s production have been paused. Until a conclusive O5 vote is reached, all information regarding SCP-6629\u2019s origins have been restricted to personnel with level 4 clearance and above. Those aware as of the date of this addenda without clearance are to be amnesticized to prevent a loss of efficiency in their duties.\n\n\nAddendum_6629-02:\n Fast-tracked funding initiatives for the creation of programs intent on splintering members of GoI-012\n1\n into MTF Sigma-66 (\u201cSixteen Tons\u201d) and MTF Mu-3 (\u201cHighest Bidders\u201d) are currently awaiting approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6629 refers to the collective designation of 205 known instances of black, humanoid-shaped automatons and the singular device used to power them, SCP-6629-A. Each SCP-6629 instance is composed entirely of standard commercial-grade porcelain and contains a single spherical crystal (SCP-6629-1) that levitates within the chest cavity. SCP-6629-A is a silver box with a singular golden button on its face that contains a closed circuit inside of it.\n\n\nAll SCP-6629-1 instances possess a randomized number of microscopic typographical characters corresponding to the Latin script carved on their surfaces. \nAnalysis of these characters has not yet revealed a connection to any known cipher, work of literature, or pataphysical algorithm. Due to this, it is theorized that SCP-6629-1\u2019s markings may have been created using techniques which harness anomalously pure randomness.\n \nSee Addendum_6629-\u0394.\n\n\nThe function of SCP-6629-1 is to power each of SCP-6629\u2019s mechanisms via SCP-6629-A. When powered on, all SCP-6629 instances within a 50m radius will animate and attempt to locate the user. If an SCP-6629 instance cannot find an unblocked path towards the user, it will deactivate after half an hour of attempts.\n\n\nHowever, in the presence of a visible user, SCP-6629 entities will not deactivate until they have been given a task or command and then fulfills the request to the user\u2019s unspoken standards of what such a service entails. There is no way to force SCP-6629\u2019s inanimation in this state outside of removing SCP-6629-1 from itself.\n\n\nThe capacity for physical tasks which can be performed by SCP-6629 match exactly that of which can be executed by the average baseline parameters of consensus humanity. The processing power it possesses for mathematical tasks falls within the perfect center of a Gaussian distribution based on data collected from \nglobally balanced samples\n persons living within the United States of America. Asking SCP-6629 to fulfill a task which would normally harm or put strain on a human being will result in similar \u201cinjuries\u201d displayed on its body\u2014these include, but are not limited to: cracks in key joints, weakness of automotive limbs, and the complete and total loss of animation, analogous to \u201cdeath\u201d.\n\n\nAs of 06/02/2024, 121 of the collected 205 entities have entered a \u201cdeath\u201d state.\n\n\n\n\nLEVEL\u00a04\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nCLEARANCE\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-6629 and -A were recovered on three separate occasions during raids of what were believed to be residences belonging to PoI-012-01\n2\n, taking place in 2003, 2008, and 2014. MTF Upsilon-10 (\u201cNo Secret Money\u201d) initially stumbled upon SCP-6629 in inert decorative states, believing the objects to be of the typical, low-hazard anomalous paraphernalia encountered during the rest of their mission. This was until fifty instances became active and attacked them, resulting in two casualties, and all fifty SCP-6629 instances being forced into a \u201cdead\u201d state in the ensuing skirmish. MTF Upsilon-10 believed all objects to be neutralized until thirty-five inactive SCP-6629 entities were found in a secret, signal-barricaded chamber of PoI-012-01\u2019s master study. SCP-6629-A was also collected here.\n\n\nBelow are documents amassed across all operations, relating to SCP-6629\u2019s commissioning and use by PoI-012-01.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Show Relevant Documentation\n- Hide Relevant Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS ITEM COMMISSION FORM No. 98257\n\n\nDATE DRAFTED:\n 07/07/1995 | \nDATE STAMPED:\n 08/07/1995\n\n\nREQUESTEE:\n PERCIVAL A.

Iris has broken over half of the in-use supply at my London estate, citing that they had \u2018terrible manners\u2019 during her imaginary tea parties, along with using them to conduct \u2018experiments\u2019 with gravity after learning about it from her tutoring. I am under the impression she merely wished to see them shattered all over the kitchen floor, but who am I to stop her? If that\u2019s what she wants with these, then so be it. These are some of the cheapest objects we currently have in production, so we should have no issues on any front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Note No. 1\n\n\n\n\nIris, I love you so much. I really hope you know that. I will never stop loving you, ever.\n\n\n \n\nThat being said, please ask before you take my suits to dress up your mannequins. I was late to one of the most important meetings I was to have all year because you scattered them everywhere all over their bodies.

The mere thought makes me shudder.\n\n\n \n\nRemember, if you want something, I will buy it for you. You don\u2019t need to raid my closet to get what you want.

I am in need of another round of these apparatuses. Iris has taken quite a liking to practicing her fencing with them, although they make subpar tutors, in my most qualified opinion. It\u2019s such a shame how much the human body is integrated into their movements, because often I find myself yearning for a more superior strength. But I suppose it\u2019s not worth fixing at this point due their supplier\u2019s\u2026unfortunate liquidation. Tell Silas that I am grateful for his help in cleaning that up, and his unparalleled knowledge in translating the acquired blueprints. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen his face since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc. Note No. 2\n\n\n\nDearest Iris,\n\n\n \n\nBy the time you wake up to read this, I will be on a plane to Beijing. I am dreadfully sorry that I cannot be there to comfort you more, as time controls both the flow of capital and the road upon which my (and one day your) business travels. When you\u2019re older, and create your own heir long after I am gone, you will understand what I mean and how I feel.\n\n\n \n\nAll of that which has happened\u2026it is difficult to put pen to paper the depths of my sorrow that you were involved in such a terrible situation. It is a tragedy of the greatest magnitude, a grieving attended to by even Death herself\u2014and yet, this is what you will learn to manage one day. This is merely the beginning of birthing pains, of the leviathan irritations you must endure. Where there is abundance, there is vermin, and where there is vermin, a plague will follow.\n\n\n \n\nSuch is the nature of the eyes we attract as those who hold the world in our hand. Entitled prats will see our spoils as something that belongs in a cell, or meant to melt under the yolk of a white flame. They will raze our facilities in the name of \u2018ethics\u2019, as if ants have any right to judge the clouds for bringing hail; they will come to detain your advisors as if a queen cannot demand total loyalty of her subjects by both magic and money.\n\n\n \n\nYour enemies are numerous, even though you are not yet an adult. I wish there was some other manner of which to have been able to expose you to the truth; if there was, believe me, believe me so thoroughly\u2014believe me in all of the power and opulence I have never held back from you\u2014I would have found the path a long time ago. I would have killed millions to see to it your life was a pinnacle of existence, to be envied by all of mankind; free from both pain and suffering, the true seat of glory you deserve.\n\n\n \n\nBut I cannot stop the cycle, so you must bear the weight of the world, and bear witness to what we must endure to maintain that. You must weather the storms brought by those born from the dust, who do not understand we hold the reins of all that exists and is to exist.\n\n\n \n\nRest assured, I will take care of the recalcitrant ones soon. I will be swift to put them in their place for their transgression\n3\n against you in ways even Hell will long to cover its face from.\n\n\n \n\nThese are my orders to you thusly: Do not go anywhere without Althea\u2019s approval until further notice. Cover your face whenever you think you are being watched, and keep my associates Amos and Ruprecht on speed-dial. You have my full permission to use any gun and pistol in the house in the case of an emergency\u2014do not worry about breaking anything valuable. I can replace treasures, wonders and archived knowledge, but you, my dear heir\u2014\nyou are the one thing my money cannot buy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWith the highest love,\n\n\n \n\nPercival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nP.S. If you are still having nightmares, there are some white tablets in my nightstand you can have. Take only one per day. If your head still hurts, indulge in some of my cigars.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEMO No. 65199\n\n\nDATE:\n 21/06/2014\n\n\nTO:\n AMOS H. MARSHALL AND RUPRECHT S. CARTER\n\n\nPENNED BY:\n PERCIVAL A. DARKE\n\n\nAmos, Ruprecht. It is imperative that we find some time within the two weeks to meet together, in person, at the London office. I understand the both of you have high-profile clients on your dockets, but I am ordering you to hand those assignments over to your assistants. We just received intel that the Foundation, in collaboration with the G.O.C, is planning to launch one of the largest raids on our American suppliers in the company\u2019s history. The losses will be disastrous if we allow them to continue their preparations\u2014billions are on the line, along with all of our New World investments. We need to discuss what is to be done; do not disobey me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEMO No. 65200\n\n\nDATE:\n 25/06/2014\n\n\nTO:\n SILAS KING\n\n\nPENNED BY:\n PERCIVAL A. DARKE\n\n\nYou have my dearest thanks (and the most generous of raises) for managing to relocate so many of our suppliers at the last minute, Silas. I\u2019m still in shock and awe at how you achieved such a Herculean task\u2014I\u2019d like the details sent in copy to me so that I can use them as a teaching tool for Iris. I know you\u2019ll be still be alive by the time she officially takes on her title as second in charge of the Designated Sextet\n4\n\u2014but this is a rare opportunity. It must be learned from fully.\n\n\nAlso, how shrewd of you to find such a convenient spot for our new source of cores for the automated servants. I was skeptical of sourcing from China, but the lack of G.O.C and Foundation proxies there make it more perfect than I ever imagined. It\u2019s no less than monumental luck that they have so little idea of what goes into these; and I intend for it to stay that way. I almost pity that there is no less\u2026unfortunate way to power their mechanisms, but I seriously do not see the value of spending time and money on that. If the materials are free, they are free. No need to mess with the number zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum_6629-\u0394:\n The following contextual correspondence has been included in this file for posterity as of 08/28/2024:\n\n\n\n\n|\nTo:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets#ten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets\n\n|\nFrom:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets#ten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets\n\n\nTIME RECEIVED:\n 07:23PM CST 07/21/2024\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-6629 Cores\n\n\nDr. Bruntsworth, Director Hammond here. I hope you\u2019ve been having a wonderful day. I\u2019m emailing you about SCP-6629, as I believe we\u2019ve made a breakthrough about the -1 components. I know Site-106 has been itching to lend these things out to other branches of the Foundation because of how convenient they are, but I think you should reconsider that for now.\n\n\nSo, as you know, Site-74 has been running under budget for quite some time. I\u2019m extremely proud of myself, no need for applause, but I nearly mucked that achievement up trying to reverse engineer this dang thing and its cores\u2019 scribblings.\n\n\nThat\u2019s when a few of my colleagues suggested we try cross referencing the letters with random assortments of data. Maybe Darke was pulling from exotic sources to make these things work, because once they die, the letters fade away, so there has to be a relationship between what\u2019s on them and why they can locomote.\n\n\nIgnore the email sent to you earlier about the letters corresponding to taxonomic classifications of currently named species\u2014the actual randomizations seem to line up with names from US census records ranging from 1995 to 2014. It\u2019s weird, and insanely specific, but at least we\u2019re one step closer to figuring this out.\n\n\nForward the files attached in this email to the Analytics Department and let me know when they\u2019re done. Everyone\u2019s a bit confused about the \u2018why\u2019 here, but this can\u2019t be anything that major, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\nTo:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets#ten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets\n\n|\nFrom:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets#ten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets\n\n\nTIME RECEIVED:\n 08:01 AM CST 07/22/2024\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Resend those files\n\n\nDear Site-74 Director Lakely Hammond,\n\n\nI don\u2019t mean to alarm you, but Analytics is requesting a second copy of those files. They\u2019ve run three batches of logistics on them already, and they want to be 100% sure they\u2019re making the right correlations here.\n\n\nIn lieu of that, O5-02 and O5-07 have put in commands for your presence at their desks next week. There\u2019s nothing I can do to change their minds this time.\n\n\nDr. Bruntsworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\nTo:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets#ten.dnuofpcs|ahsenat.htrowstnurbrd_601ets\n, \nten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets#ten.dnuofpcs|dnommahrtcrd_47ets\n\n|\nCC:\n \nten.dnuofpcs|setaeksnaejrtcrd_601ets#ten.dnuofpcs|setaeksnaejrtcrd_601ets\n, + 26 others\n\n|\nFrom:\n \npics.dnuofpcs|20_HAESAreesrevo#pics.dnuofpcs|20_HAESAreesrevo\n\n\nTIME RECEIVED:\n 06:37 AM CST 07/27/2024\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n An Important Announcement About SCP-6629\n\n\nTo everyone receiving my email, you will want to sit down.\n\n\nI understand that there have been rumors flying between the Analytics Department, Site-74, and Site-106 about the nature of SCP-6629 and its -1 components. I am here to quell and properly explain to each of you the truth of what we have uncovered so that panic does not indiscriminately spread to other sites and the Ethics Committee. To those who have already filed requests on our current plans of action regarding Percival A. Darke, please know that we will be addressing them at the next O5 Council meeting.\n\n\nSo\u2014as discovered by Site-74 Director Hammond, the characters engraved into SCP-6629-1 are indeed not random as we once previously believed. They correspond one-to-one with the names of missing persons in the United States who possessed legal entries within the US census database. As of the time of this email\u2019s sending, all individuals whose names we have managed to recover have been declared legally dead by local, state, and federal authorities. Not a single person\u2019s body with a name on one of those cores was ever found, dead or alive.\n\n\nWhat this means is that we have found an answer which the United States found itself lacking nearly three decades ago. As you all know, the rate of missing persons in the US doubled from roughly six hundred thousand per year to 1.2 million starting in 1995, with the decade of 2002-2012 seeing the highest growth of this trend, peaking at 3.4 million in 2006.\n\n\nThe mass social panic caused by this crisis was unprecedented. Initially the Foundation thought the disappearances to be the work of many heated, but ultimately ordinary factors: communist and French influences wreaking havoc within the G.O.C, Russian spies encouraging the defection of civilians with far-right beliefs to its satellite countries, the Sovereign State of Hawai\u2019i serving as an isolationist haven for all manners of asylum seekers, etc. All of this greatly stifled our ability to investigate wide-reaching phenomena, both anomalous and not.\n\n\nWhat we, the O5 Council, now understand is that we should have never permitted any of that to stop us. For the past decade, China has been undergoing the same problem\u2014and now we know why. Each instance of SCP-6629-1 has thirty thousand names inscribed on it. We currently possess 205 of them, but based on insider information obtained by MTF Mu-3, about 700 total were produced in America.\n\n\nThere is no other conclusion we can come to except that Darke has somehow committed one of the greatest anomalous atrocities under the Veil, and for a period of time that no one thought possible for an entity like MC&D. Over twenty million people have been silently, unabashedly extinguished from existence because of her mercurial whims, and we are currently powerless to stop this death march.\n\n\nNow, before alarm bells begin ringing, understand that the O5 Council is in a bind despite the clear danger here. Because Darke has somehow managed to tweak whatever creates SCP-6629-1 (hereby referred to as SCP-6629-\u03a9) to specifications so insanely meticulous\n5\n, we are currently at a stalemate of how to not just procure SCP-6629-\u03a9, but how to utilize it as well.\n\n\nI do not need to tell the more tactician-minded among you of how a perfectly silent, under-the-Veil killer of this scale and precision would be of extreme benefit to the Foundation. It would save the lives of countless MTF members and civilians threatened by keter-level humanoids, along with providing us with unlimited leverage over any government which dares to roadblock us. Perhaps we could even alter it to neutralize non-humanoid anomalies which cannot be feasibly contained.\n\n\nBut this is also a dangerous, dangerous thing. This needs to be kept out of the hands of other GoIs at all costs, especially those more politically motivated like ORIA and the Chaos Insurgency. Should this fall into the hands of anyone else but us, we can expect little but to be wiped off the map when we inevitably piss off the wrong people, followed by everything we know collapsing without our stability keeping it in place.\n\n\nWe find ourselves therefore as Atlas in this situation. The burden of the world has too been thrust upon our shoulders, and there is no easy solution or agreement about what should be done. The O5 Council understands that SCP-6629-\u03a9 is an active threat, but the Veil must be maintained at all costs, and we will need time to craft a plan that will preclude any possibility of Darke destroying SCP-6629-\u03a9 permanently, or worse, turning it against us. The lives we can save by obtaining it, rest assured, shall make up for what we have currently suffered.\n\n\nIf you have any family or friends in China you\u2019re worried about, we advise you to have them contact us for a job here. We will offer them work-visas and places to stay. That is the best protection we can offer on that front for now.\n\n\nWith all authority,\n\nO5-02\n\n\n\n\nAddendum_6629-03:\n On 09/12/2024, a hidden compartment was found on an SCP-6629 instance during a regularly scheduled maintenance check. It was cracked open and contained the following note.\n\n\n\n\nMy beloved Iris, has it been eighteen years already? Goodness. I cannot believe how fast the time has flown by; I feel as if it was only yesterday when I swaddled you in my arms and watched your little mouth bubble over with the remnants of your inheritance rites. It still surprises me to no end how lithe you grew up to be given how fat you were as an infant. I miss being able to squish your cheeks!\n\n\n \n\nIrregardless of my hopelessly maternal nostalgia, I hope you enjoy your present. I eavesdropped from Victoria that you were finally seeking to buy your own properties (in Monaco and Geneva no less!), so I put an order in to prevent your opulent abodes from being sullied by unworthy feet. You probably don\u2019t remember these, but I\u2019ve kept the blueprints on file because they\u2019re so useful. You loved them so much when you were younger!\n\n\n \n\nHopefully now you will appreciate the value they have as house-staff, instead of as toys, but if you still wish to roughhouse with them, well, I\u2019m not going to stop you. We can always make more, easily.\n\n\n \n\nHappy birthday, my dearest heir. I cannot overstate how proud I am of you. You are poised to inherit the universe and all of its glories, riches, and wonders\u2014and I will be there to see to it that nothing will ever stop that. I will be there to see to it that Death will not lay a hand on you until the contracted day comes; I will be there to see to it that no mountain, man, abstraction or group will ever possess the means to put a stop to your ambitions. MC&D is my eternal benefaction to you, and so long as you maintain a steady course with its dance, it will provide unto you all that of which you desire.\n\n\n \n\nSee you in London!
