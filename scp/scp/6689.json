As such, the complete isolation of SCP-6689 and SCP-6689-affiliated constructs within the noosphere is inadvisable. To ensure containment of SCP-6689 while retaining conceptualization of the aforementioned constructs, the entity has been sequestered in a \nmulticursal,\n metaphysical, labyrinth within the noosphere. This containment construct is established through the use of an adapted \nTrismegistus-Engine Totemic Signifier\n \u2014 designated \nTETS-L\n \u2014 and utilizes SCP-6689's relation(s) to the Foundation and \nself-referential\n conceptualizations of containment to perpetuate the labyrinth, in accordance with principles founded upon the work of \nDr. Vivian Elmwoods.\n\n\nThus far, this construct has successfully prevented SCP-6689's expansion throughout the noosphere and halted its assimilation of distinct concepts into its meta-construct, while enabling the continued conceptualization of SCP-6689-affiliated data points. To ensure SCP-6689 cannot breach containment, targeted \nantimemes\n have been conceptually applied to the labyrinth's 'exit:' disallowing conceptual egression by entities within the construct, while still enabling the continued existence of extant lines of relational connection between the entity and the broader noosphere.\n\n\nThe potential application of a rhizomatic labyrinthine containment construct to replace the currently employed multicursal labyrinth is under investigation.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREMOVED FOR EFFICACY OF CONTAINMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6688\n | SCP-6689 | \nSCP-6690\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6689\n\" by DodoDevil, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
