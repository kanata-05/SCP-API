The object class may be spoken aloud, but not typed into the SCiPnet database to prevent the effects of SCP-5148 from manifesting.\n\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-5148, the anomaly itself and any SCP objects of the same object class are not to be tagged as \nthe topmost of the Sephirot\n, and are instead designated as Malchut. Use of object class \nthe most hidden of things\n is still to be utilized in standard Foundation databases outside of Site-19.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5148 is a digital anomaly affecting the Site-19 SCiPnet database. When an SCP object is tagged and designated as \nthe coronal object class\n, SCP-5148 will manifest and change all uses of the word to 'Peter', as well as replace any attached image files with crudely drawn images of a character wearing green pants and a white button-up shirt.\n\n\nSCP-5148 was originally discovered by Alexandra.aic when the construct detected multiple unauthorized edits on hundreds of SCP files hosted on the Site-19 SCiPnet database. Alexandra.aic initially attempted to revert edits on the affected articles, but was unable to do so and alerted Foundation personnel to the problem. To date, all attempts to train AIC to edit files affected by SCP-5148 have failed.\n\n\nAddendum 5148.01:\n Recovered Chat Logs\n\nThe following chat logs were found in an abandoned GoI-5869 'Gamers Against Weed' chatroom by a Foundation webcrawler and are believed to be relevant to SCP-5148. The document has been edited to follow Procedure 5148-Alpha.\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nTakeovermetal:\n anyone want to play a modded doom level?\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n hey guys\n\n\nBingledorf:\n \nTakeovermetal\n me\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n i just got done reading a new york times article on how the foundation classifies the things they contain\n\n\njockjamsvol6:\n Ping!\n\n\nbluntfiend:\n Ping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Takeovermetal\u00a0has\u00a0uploaded\u00a0file\u00a0battleofrbikinibodoom.exe\u00a032mb\u00a0\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0battleofrbikinibodoom.exe\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLAD FILE?\n\n\n-\u00a0battleofrbikinibodoom.exe\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBingledorf:\n sweet will play now\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n hey guys you're just in time for my kvetching\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n so like i was saying, the foundation right. they use these things called object classes to designate how dangerous things are.\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n get this\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n they use safe, euclid, and \nthat which sits above Tiferet.\n\n\nbluntfiend:\n OK, and?\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n \nregal crown of the sephirot\n as in like the kaballah\n\n\nbones:\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n thank you \nbones\n <3\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n so like this matters because \nthat with 13 attributes\n is reserved for the most dangerous one\n\n\nbluntfiend:\n Makes sense, I see it means crown on the wikipedia page.\n\n\njockjamsvol6:\n But what does this all mean?\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n idk but isn't it a little sus that a fascist organization is appropriating the kaballah?\n\n\njockjamsvol6:\n I see what you mean.
