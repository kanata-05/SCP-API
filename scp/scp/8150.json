Any deaths caused by SCP-8150 are to be reported as casualties of the publicly-accepted concept of \"dust storms\". research efforts are also postponed indefinitely, due to the high amounts of casualties taken during Incident SCP-8150-I. The publicly-perceived notion of the Dust Storm is to be upheld, as to avoid the true nature of SCP-8150 from being discovered. While containment efforts have been abandoned, damage control and evacuation efforts related to SCP-8150-1 instances are to be handled by MTF-Rho-10 \"Dust Devils\".\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8150 is the collective name for the phenomena publicly known and accepted as \"Dust Storms\". In reality, \"Dust storms\" are an anomalous species of sentient storm systems, hereby referred to as SCP-8150-1. SCP-8150-1 instances vary widely in size, depending on the amount of Elan Vital Energy (EVE) absorbed. The largest documented SCP-8150-1 instance, publicly known as the \"Black Sunday Storm\" reached 800 miles long and 400 miles wide. The exact method and reasoning to how SCP-8150-1 instances form is unknown, as it is impossible to predict when and where they will, and there is a lack of living witnesses to SCP-8150-1 forming events. SCP-8150-1 instances \"pull\" the EVE out of an organism before dispersing it into its cloud. Fatalities from SCP-8150-1 instances can only be avoided by donning protective equipment with full CBRNA protection.\n\n\nA full log of notable SCP-8150 related incidents can be found below.\n\n\nIncident SCP-8150-A:\n Publicly known as the \"Dust Bowl\", a large uptick in SCP-8150-1 activity during the 1930s led to severe ecological devastation, along with over 7,000 dead. These included several Foundation researchers and agents, but consisted mostly of civilians. The largest of these instances was the Black Sunday storm, or SCP-8150-1C. The size of SCP-8150-1C was due to the amounts of EVE absorbed by it and its contributing storms. Over its lifespan, multiple people were killed, but due to the lack of Foundation resources at the time, containment efforts were not pursued.\n\n\nIncident SCP-8150-D:\n Publicly known as the \"Great Bakersfield Dust Storm\", in 1977 an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested near Bakersfield, California, before moving into the area to harvest EVE. In total, 25 people died, however Foundation agents were able to suppress the knowledge of 20 of these deaths, leaving the publicly accepted tally at 5. While not a particularly significant event, this incident directly lead to the founding of MTF-Rho-10.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0SCP-8150-F:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOverview:\n On November 29\u00a01991, an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested around 43 miles north of Coalinga. Having received notification from US Government assets at Naval Air Station Leemore, and due to the storm's close and rapidly closing proximity to Interstate 5, MTF-Rho-10 was quickly scrambled and dispatched to attempt containment efforts.\n\n\n\n\nIncident SCP-8150-F Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n November 29, 1991\n\n\nExploration Team:\n MTF-Rho-10 \"Dust Devils\"\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8150 | Interstate 5, California, United States\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Lieutenant Arnold Holmes | R10-1\n\n\nTeam Members:\n\nSergeant Amy Lawson | R10-2\n\nSpecialist Barry \nKeyestone\n | R10-3\n\nSpecialist Alexi Borodin | R10-4\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRho-10 exits utility vehicle at edge of Storm\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Alright, Dust Bunnies! Masks on, masks on!\n\n\nTeam dons protective equipment.\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Alright! Alexi, you stay here, try and stop the flow of civvies into the storm.\n\n\nSpc Borodin:\n Sir.\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n Alright, LT! What's the play here?\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Get in, assess the size of a possible pile up, and try and rescue any civvies still in their cars.\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n Readings just came in off the kit! We have several distinct EVE signs in the cloud. At least 13 dead.\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Chirst, well we should get moving before it spikes up.\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n Roger that Dust Rabbit.\n\n\nTeam proceeds further into SCP-8150-1 instance\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n Up ahead! We got a car. Shit, side windows open.\n\n\nSgt Lawson moves around the side of the vehicle.\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n Yeah- we got a civvie in here. Dead, showing no residual EVE signs.\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Nothing we can do. Let's keep moving.\n\n\n[4 Minutes of extant audio and dialogue removed]\n\n\nSpc Borodin:\n Shit, Dust Rabbit! A car got through! Silver SUV, headed north!\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Alright, everyone off the road! We'll follow em when they pass!\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n Christ almighty, I can barely tell what is and isn't road!\n\n\nLt Holmes and Spc Keyestone move off of the road. Due to low visibility, Sgt Lawson cannot determine her location.\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n There's the car! Amy! Two! Get out of the road!\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n I can't tell where i'm-\n\n\nThe vehicle hits Sgt Lawson. The impact breaches her CBRNA protection. SCP-8150-1 begins to enter her suit.\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n [Audible gasping]\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Barry! Stop that fucking car! I've got Amy!\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n Aye Sir!\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Fuck, Amy! Pop a flare, I can't fucking find you!\n\n\nSgt Lawson:\n [Gasping increases in intensity]\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n Sir! I found the cars! We've got an enormous pileup here!\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n Shit, alright, okay- you can secure the civs, I can handle her!\n\n\nSpc Keyestone:\n She's fucking dead, Holmes. Now unless you want these civilians dead too, I need your ass over here NOW!\n\n\nLt Holmes:\n You- You're right.\n\n\nLt Holmes moves to assist Spc Keyestone.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nAfter Action Report:\n\nAfter Rho-10 evacuated a total of 12 civilians from I-5, additional Foundation assets set up a perimeter to prevent further loss of life. After the SCP-8150-1 instance dissipated, Foundation S&R teams moved in to assess damage. A total of 104 cars had piled up, with 17 having died from collisions. A further 46 people had died from SCP-8150, including Sergeant Amy Lawson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident SCP-8150-H:\n On January 4th, 2002, an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested several miles west of Las Vegas, Nevada. MTF-Rho-10 was scrambled under personal orders from then Captain Arnold Holmes, and they successfully prevented the instance from growing by terminating wildlife in the area and preventing any civilian entry. Due to their professionalism and efficiency in this mission, Captain Holmes was promoted to Task Force command, with Lieutenant Barry Keyestone now taking command of Rho-10. Due to the lack of casualties, this incident was hidden from the public.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0SCP-8150-I:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOverview:\n On August 19th, 2021, a large SCP-8150-1 instance manifested dangerously close to the village of Makhunik, Iran. Due to the proximity to a population center, MTF-Rho-10 was immediately tasked with evacuating the populace, with assistance from MTF-Sigma-9 \"Valkyries\" and a Farsi translator from MTF-Epsilon-6 \"Village Idiots\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of MTF-Rho-10 during Incident SCP-8150-I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n January 4th, 2021\n\n\nExploration Team:\n MTF-Rho-10 \"Dust Devils\"\n\n\nSupporting Personnel:\n MTF-Sigma-9 \"Valkyries\", MTF-Epsilon-6 \"Village Idiots\"\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8150 | Makhunik, Iran\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Lieutenant Barry Keyestone | R10-1\n\n\nTeam Members:\n\nSergeant Alexi Borodin | R10-2\n\nSpecialist Sarah Le'groux | R10-3\n\nSpecialist Daniel Harper | R10-4\n\nSenior Operative Hayet Rios | Epsilon-6 Translator.

Team Disembarks.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Alright! All transports stay where you are. We're gonna need pilots out of their seats to help the villagers settle in. 2, 3, and 5 with me. We're taking east. Harper, you take some of the Valkyries and search the west side.\n\n\nSpc Harper:\n Roger!\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n No rest for the wicked gentlemen, techs from HQ say we've got about 4 hours before the cloud heads over here. Pass out gas masks as you go, it's gonna take a few trips to get everyone out of here.\n\n\nEvacuation proceeds as intended for 2 hours. 264 civilians have been evacuated, out of the 580 total.\n\n\nSigma-9 Pilot:\n We're away, that's another 24!\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Copy that, we'll have more when you're back.\n\n\nRho-10 Dispatch:\n All personnel, all personnel. High priority notification from mission control. The storm is moving far faster than expected. It seems to be moving more directly towards the village than prior instances. Recommend checking your EVE sensors for any abnormal readings.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Alexi, get on that!\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n Yessir.\n\n\nSgt Borodin takes out EVE detection equipment, begins scanning environment.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Command, what's the ETA on that cloud?\n\n\nRho-10 Dispatch:\n 10 minutes.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Ten fucking minutes?! EVERYONE! SPEED UP! WE NEED EVERYONE IN TRANSPORTS AND MASKS ON THOSE WHO AREN'T!\n\n\nRho-10 Dispatch:\n It's picking up speed! 7 minutes!\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n 1, sir! You're gonna wanna see this!\n\n\nSO Rios:\n [Directing civilians into transports]\n\n\nTwo more transports begin to touch off. Scattered shouting and rushing wind audible.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Valk 3! You're moving too close to the dust storm! Bank right!\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n SIR!\n\n\nSigma-9 Pilot:\n SHIT! We're in the cloud! The shit's getting inside!\n\n\nValkyrie-3 begins spinning out as pilot loses consciousness.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n FUCK! All transports, GO GO GO! Get the hell out! Dust Bunnies, Mount up, we're leaving!\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n GOD FUCKING DAMMIT BARRY LISTEN TO ME!\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n WHAT?\n\n\nCloud begins to enter area. Interference from wind audible. The remainder of Rho-10 enters the Osprey. Lt Keyestone is stood at the bottom of the ramp.\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n It's you, Barry! The storm is going for you! Your EVE is all over the place.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Roger that. Sigma-9. Touch off. We've done what we can.\n\n\nSigma-9 Pilot:\n Understood.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n I know what I need to do.\n\n\nLt Keyestone steps off the ramp. The remaining aircraft begin takeoff.\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n Sir? What are you doing?! SIR GET ON THE OSPREY!\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n It's too late Alexi. I'd only be taking the storm with me. It's been an honor, Dust Devils. Keystone signing off.\n\n\nSgt Borodin:\n Solid copy boss. Die well.\n\n\nRemainder of Foundation assets exfil with a final total of 360 civilians evacuated. SCP-8150 fully settles in the area, concentrating around Lt Keyestone.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Shit\u2026 something special about me, huh? That's news.\n\n\nStorm intensity peaks.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Guess I'd better get my affairs in order huh? Well, if anyone hears this, get it to my son.\n\n\nLt Keyestone removes headcam, and places it facing him.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n I love you kid. I always have. I wish I could've seen you more, but it's too late for that. Stick with your mom, stick with your brother. You're good people Atlas. I love you.\n\n\nKeyestone stands up, and walks away from the camera.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n I don't know what you things are. Hell, I doubt you know you're hurting people.\n\n\nStorm continues to rush around Keyestone.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Enough pretense. I know when I'm not welcome.\n\n\nKeyestone takes a bow, and draws his sidearm.\n\n\nLt Keyestone:\n Et in Arcadia, Ego.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nAfter Action Report:\n\nLieutenant Barry Keyestone was posthumously awarded the Task Force Medal of Valor\n2\n.
