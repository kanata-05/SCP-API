No persons, civilian or otherwise, are to enter SCP-6431.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6431 is an extradimensional space located underneath the Morning Call Cafe in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n\nSCP-6431 is accessed through a sinkhole in the back room of the cafe. Radar scans have revealed the space to be predominantly empty with only infrequent, unidentified movements detected within.\n\n\nExploration Log 6431-01:\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n Mobile Task Force Rho-23 (\"Vinyl Scratchers\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-6431\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Provisional Captain P23-02 - Granite\n\n\nTeam Members:\n P23-03 - Basalt, P23-04 - Pumice, P23-05 - Slate\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nGranite:\n Mic check.\n\n\nBasalt:\n Check.\n\n\nPumice:\n Check.\n\n\nSlate:\n Check.\n\n\nGranite:\n Alright, proceed.\n\n\nThe team descends into SCP-6431.\n\n\nHouses with varying architecture span throughout SCP-6431. The space appears open. A sunrise is visible, giving SCP-6431 a red tint.\n\n\nPieces of trash are scattered across the ground. Multiple roads fork off from the entry point, and pieces of furniture sit on the sidewalks.\n\n\nPumice:\n The fuck? Why's it so red in here?\n\n\nSlate:\n I don't think we're inside.\n\n\nSlate gestures upwards.\n\n\nBasalt:\n Weird-ass neighborhood.\n\n\nSlate:\n No kidding. What's with the furniture everywhere?\n\n\nBasalt:\n The furniture? What about the houses?\n\n\nGranite:\n I mean, it's a space under New Orleans. Isn't that already weird?\n\n\nPumice:\n Why's that weird?\n\n\nGranite:\n You really don't know?\n\n\nPumice:\n Oh, right, water\u2026\n\n\nA slight breeze pushes a cup across the street.\n\n\nGranite:\n Let's get going.\n\n\nThe team proceeds along the left road for approximately 21 minutes. Various houses of no discernible pattern line both sides. The road branches after every 4-8 houses.\n\n\nThe sound of a closing door is heard, causing Basalt, Pumice, and Slate to stop. Several vaguely humanoid figures briefly appear in the windows of the surrounding houses.\n\n\nSlate looks around.\n\n\nSlate:\n Where'd that come from?\n\n\nPumice:\n I don't think we're alone.\n\n\nBasalt:\n Let's investigate. What do you say, Granite?\n\n\nBasalt:\n Granite?\n\n\nPumice:\n Shit, he's still moving.\n\n\nBasalt, Slate, and Pumice run to catch up with Granite.\n\n\nBasalt:\n You good?\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nBasalt:\n Granite, are you alright?\n\n\nGranite:\n Oh, yeah, I'm fine.\n\n\nBasalt:\n And you'll tell us if something's wrong.\n\n\nGranite:\n Mhm\u2026\n\n\nThe team continues walking for ten minutes. Granite turns on multiple roads before stopping. and turning around.\n\n\nGranite:\n Hey, why do you guys keep following me?\n\n\nPumice:\n You're the team leader.\n\n\nGranite:\n What're you talking about? Team?\n\n\nPumice:\n Y'know, the exploration?\n\n\nGranite:\n Just- stay away. Stop following me.\n\n\nSlate:\n You-\n\n\nGranite:\n Go!\n\n\nBasalt looks around.\n\n\nSlate:\n What do we do now?\n\n\nBasalt:\n Let's go\u2026 right.\n\n\nThe team, with the exception of Granite, turns to the right and continues walking.\n\n\nSlate:\n We're not seriously gonna leave him, are we?\n\n\nBasalt:\n No. We'll turn on the next block.\n\n\nThe team takes the next turn and walks for six minutes.\n\n\nBasalt holds her head.\n\n\nSlate:\n You okay?\n\n\nBasalt:\n Yeah, just kinda dizzy\u2026\n\n\nSlate:\n Why don't we take a break?\n\n\nBasalt:\n No, we're almost there.\n\n\nSlate:\n You heard from Granite?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSlate:\n Basalt, did you hear from Granite?\n\n\nPumice:\n I don't think that's it.\n\n\nSlate:\n No shit, Sherlock.\n\n\nPumice:\n No, I mean-\n\n\nAn unidentified female voice cuts in.\n\n\nFemale:\n Where have you been? I told you to be back before dinner.\n\n\nGranite:\n I was out with some friends.\n\n\nSlate:\n The fuck?\n\n\nFemale:\n I was worried about you.\n\n\nGranite:\n Sorry, Mom.\n\n\nPumice:\n Granite, you okay there?\n\n\nFemale:\n Come on, let's get you cleaned up.\n\n\nPumice:\n Granite, come in.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSlate:\n Granite?\n\n\nPumice:\n We lost him.\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nSlate:\n Basalt, where are you taking us?\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nSlate:\n Basalt, where are you going?\n\n\nPumice:\n Let's just follow her.\n\n\nThe team continues walking for five minutes before Basalt stops and stares up at a house.\n\n\nSlate:\n I\u2026 I don't like this.\n\n\nA vaguely humanoid figure briefly appears in a window before moving out of sight.\n\n\nPumice:\n Did you see that?\n\n\nBasalt begins to walk towards the house.\n\n\nPumice:\n Oh, no, you don't!\n\n\nPumice forces Basalt to the ground.\n\n\nPumice:\n What's gotten into you?\n\n\nBasalt:\n Who- who are you? What do you want?\n\n\nPumice:\n Basalt?\n\n\nPumice's hands begin to sink through Basalt.\n\n\nBasalt stands up, leaving Pumice on the ground.\n\n\nSlate:\n Oh god.\n\n\nBasalt tilts her head slightly before removing her headset.\n\n\nShe opens the door and walks inside.\n\n\nPumice:\n Shit.\n\n\nSlate:\n What now?\n\n\nPumice:\n Head back before it happens to us.\n\n\nSlate:\n I\u2026 guess.\n\n\nPumice turns.\n\n\nSlate:\n They're gone, aren't they?\n\n\nPumice:\n Probably.\n\n\nPumice and Slate walk silently for ten minutes.\n\n\nPumice:\n Hey, Slate?\n\n\nSlate:\n Hm?\n\n\nPumice:\n What was your family like?\n\n\nSlate:\n Why do you ask?\n\n\nPumice:\n I think\u2026 I understand now.\n\n\nSlate:\n Understand what? What're you talking about?\n\n\nPumice:\n I just wanna know.\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nSlate:\n I didn't have one.\n\n\nPumice:\n Well, you're lucky, I guess.\n\n\nSlate:\n Lucky? How is that lucky?\n\n\nPumice:\n You'll understand eventually.\n\n\nPumice:\n I think I'm gonna go home now.\n\n\nSlate:\n You're not making any sense.\n\n\nPumice turns to the left. Slate follows.\n\n\nSlate:\n Pumice, where are you going? This isn't the right way.\n\n\nPumice:\n I told you: I'm going home.\n\n\nSlate grabs Pumice's wrist and attempts to pull him in the opposite direction. He continues walking, pulling Slate along slowly.\n\n\nSlate:\n You're coming back with me. Come on!\n\n\nPumice:\n It'll be over soon.\n\n\nSlate:\n Yeah, because we're going back up! Snap out of it already!\n\n\nPumice's wrist passes through Slate's hands, causing her to stumble.\n\n\nPumice:\n You need to leave.\n\n\nSlate:\n I'm not gonna lose you, too!\n\n\nPumice:\n You've already\u2026\n\n\nPumice stops and walks into a house. Slate follows him inside.\n\n\nThe camera feed cuts out.\n\n\nTwo unidentified voices begin to speak.\n\n\nSlate breathes heavily.\n\n\nChild A:\n Nate! You're back!\n\n\nPumice:\n Hey, Syd.\n\n\nSlate:\n Pumice, whatever that thing is\u2026\n\n\nChild B:\n Look, look, my tooth fell out!\n\n\nPumice:\n Don't forget to put that under your pillow.\n\n\nSlate:\n Get- get away from it!\n\n\nSlate screams.\n\n\nThe camera feed begins again, showing Slate running from the house. She continues running towards the entry point for 32 minutes.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nConcluding Statement:\n Slate was successfully extracted following the mission; however, she refused to speak about the events that occurred inside the house. Of note, the sun did not move from its initial position during the exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6430\n | SCP-6431 | \nSCP-6432\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6431\n\" by NebulousStar, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
