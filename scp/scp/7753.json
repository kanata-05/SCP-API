Poems ideated during manifestation events were often descriptive in nature, and when subsequent manifestations were confirmed, were seen to describe the location of the manifestation immediately prior.\n\n\nSCP-7753 manifestations were recorded anywhere from minutes to days after one another and were incredibly short, meaning subjects were regularly incapable of processing the projected poem in full. Due to this, a majority of subjects processed SCP-7753 manifestations as brief mental images, collections of phrases, or forgot them entirely.\n\n\nInternational Foundation personnel employed the use of mild mnestics\n.\nAgents that recover memories.\n to monitor SCP-7753 manifestations for irregular contents. Poems uncovered from this process can be found in Addendum 7753.1.\n.\nPoems collected internationally were translated to English, original interpretations are available upon request.\n\n\nAddendum 7753.1:\n Abridged Manifestation Log\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Manifestation 7753/11 marks the first successful use of mnestics to recover SCP-7753 poems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifestation 7753/11\n\n\n\n\nArea of Effect:\n Kenilworth, Illinois, USA\n\n\nDate:\n 26JUL2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprigs that reach into the open sky\n\nand vines that whorl round to a choke\n\nbetween them in the underbrush\n\na bird.\n\n\nRiding on unsettled air\n\naround the beasts that drive\n\na road breaking through\n\nthe woods.\n\n\nScent thick because they're always here\n\nbut never quite the same\n\nfor each has set a mark somewhere far\n\nto reach.\n\n\nOn a path with no end\n\nfeel artificial winds awaken\n\nwhere another bird catches tailwind\n\nand soars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n 81 Manifestations omitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifestation 7753/93\n\n\n\n\nArea of Effect:\n Th\u00fcringen, Austria\n\n\nDate:\n30SEP2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hall of many faces\n\noften shed and built anew\n\none more chance to start\n\nthe beating heart\n\nof patrons passing through.\n\n\nUpon sheets of grey linoleum\n\nunder lights that never fade\n\nwhat strange discovery\n\nhid within\n\na solemn treasure of an age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n 164 Manifestations omitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifestation 7753/258\n\n\n\n\nArea of Effect:\n Heyfield, Victoria, Australia\n\n\nDate:\n 26MAR2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no pool deeper\n\nthan the reach of the sky\n\nwhere the stars lay drowning above.\n\n\nThere is no night blacker\n\nthan the deepest of depths\n\nwhere all mysteries freely reside.\n\n\nBut still the fronts meet\n\na paradoxical feat\n\nAn achievement just on the horizon.\n\n\nBond formed in a ring\n\njust further than all things\n\nwhere all fades in awe of blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n SCP-7753 manifestations halted for approximately 3 months following Manifestation 7753/258.
