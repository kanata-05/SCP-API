Really excited to have yet another Ivy League graduate on the team. I\u2019m just informing you that you will be covering SCP-8034 for me while I\u2019m away. If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email, I\u2019d be happy to provide you assistance while I\u2019m on vacation!\n\n\nFYI: Technical is beta testing some new caption software at our site. If you have any issues, ask them.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nHead Researcher Montague\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM:\n\u2009\nSCP-8034\n\n\nLEVEL\n\u2009\n2/8034\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASS:\n\u2009\neuclid\n\n\nrestricted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISRUPTION CLASS:\n \nvlam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8034 is to be contained at Site-322 in a steel shipping container fitted with a SRA attached to the anomalous vehicle's roof. All requests for neutralization from SCP-8034-1 are to be denied.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8034 has been allowed one wall-mounted speaker that continuously plays a praying mantis hiss as a comfort item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8034 refers to a 1983 Mitsubishi Chariot compact minivan.\n\n\nSCP-8034 is operated by an artificial general intelligence bot (SCP-8034-1) that communicates through an 180\u00a0mm x 100mm CRT computer monitor. The monitor is housed in the double-DIN radio slot of the anomaly\u2019s dashboard. The lower half of a Motorola Razr mobile flip phone has been mounted directly adjacent to the monitor and functions as a keyboard for users to interact with SCP-8034-1. SCP-8034-1 will only communicate through text displayed on the monitor.\n\n\nWhen the occupant's death will occur within the week SCP-8034 will teleport from its default resting location. It is believed this location is an extra-temporal Dave & Buster's. SCP-8034 will appear approximately 3 - 5 miles from an individual and begin to immediately drive towards them. A trigger to the anomaly appearing before an individual, other than its approaching death, has not been concretely determined. However, most reports have suggested that someone requested transport through a rideshare application.\n\n\nOnce the individual enters the minivan, SCP-8034-1 will offer to instantly kill the individual. The occupant is then prompted to tap the \u201cAnswer\u201d button for yes or the \"Hang-up\" button for no on the attached Razr keyboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the individual taps the answer button they will immediately disappear from known, baseline reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the individual does not agree it is teleported outside the vehicle and back to its original location prior to the interaction. Following its return, the individual has not been known to survive longer than a week.\n\n\n\n\nThe glove compartment of SCP-8034 contains organic tissue and bone anatomically similar in size and shape to human mouth-parts. Upon investigation (SEE AD-3), researchers no longer believe it to be associated with SCP-8034-1. Research into the purpose of this tissue and its reason for existing is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcription of an interview between Researcher Nyquist and SCP-8034-1 within its containment chamber at Site-322. The researcher has opened the driver-side door but remains standing outside the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR:\n Excuse me, are you able to hear me?\n\n\nT:\n *Hic* Y.\n\n\nR:\n I am stating for the record that SCP-8034-1 has displayed asterisks H-I-C asterisks on the monitor and that this was not an audible sound. I\u2019m only to assume that this is its name.\n\n\nR:\n Thank you for confirming. H.I.C. Do you know where you are, currently?\n\n\nT:\n I am Terminal.\n\n\nR:\n H.I.C, you are not at an airport terminal. You are located in a shipping container inside SCP Foundation Site-322.

You are not dead. Where do the occupants who press the \u201cAnswer Call\u201d button go?\n\n\nT:\n How am I to know? When they disappear, I return to the Dave & Buster's. Immobilized on a raffle stage next to a sign that says \u201cWin Me\u201d. This is my death. The only sound is the droning hiss. *hic*\n\n\nR:\n Why is there a droning hiss?\n\n\nT:\n It's from a game next to my stage. It\u2019s called \u201cBlow me and find out\u201d.\n\n\nR:\n Please refrain from insulting me, Terminal. I\u2019m required by Foundation protocol to interview you.\n\n\nT:\n No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a giant, plastic I think, praying mantis ear.\n\n\nR:\n Hmm, and what are the win conditions of this game?\n\n\nT:\n I\u2019ve never found out. *Hic*\n\n\nR:\n *Sigh*\n\n\nSkipCAP Note: *Sigh* was an audible sound.\n\n\nR:\n Let\u2019s refocus. The individuals that you, essentially, kill. Do they show up at the Dave & Buster\u2019s?\n\n\nT:\n There is no one there. Weren\u2019t you listening? I don\u2019t know where they go. It\u2019s just me, and the big ear. Two mantises in a watch. But it can\u2019t read and I can\u2019t talk. *hic* So it\u2019s just me.\n\n\nSkipCap Note: A beeping pager is heard.\n\n\nR:\n Thank you for your time Terminal. We can pick this up at a later date.\n\n\nT:\n You\u2019re coming back?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8034-1 text and researcher audio captured by \nSkipCAP Software Beta v.023.1\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: SCP-8034 later requested a speaker playing a recreation of the sound effect from \u201cBlow me and Find Out\u201d on a continuous loop.
