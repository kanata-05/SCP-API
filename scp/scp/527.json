No other containment procedures are necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-527 is a male humanoid, 1.67m in height, which is biologically non-anomalous, with the exception of its head, which is that of a \nPuntius semifasciolatus\n, or gold barb fish.\n\n\nSCP-527 displays no other anomalous qualities. The head of SCP-527 functions the same as the head of any other non-anomalous human. SCP-527 is capable of typical human speech. A tattoo reading \"Mr. Fish, from Little Misters \u00ae by Dr. Wondertainment\" appears on the bottom of its left foot.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-527 was discovered in Boston by Foundation agents in 2002, and was moved to Site-19 in 2004.\n\n\nAddendum 527.1:\n Initial Interview\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n Thank you for your cooperation thus far, SCP-527. We're just using this interview as a way to gauge any potential anomalous behavior we might not expect.\n\n\nSCP-527:\n Alright.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n To begin, are you capable of breathing underwater?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n Are you capable of communicating with other fish, or with other sea-based lifeforms?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n I see. When did you first discover your condition? Were you by any chance attacked or bitten by a fish you did not recognize, or experience an encounter with a sea-based deity of some kind?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n Uh\u2026 well, then you've been like this since birth?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n Yep.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n I\u2026 alright. Do you know of any other anomalous traits you might exhibit?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n Sure don't. Like I told the other guy, this is all it is. You're looking at it. Lie, Stripes, Hot, Sweetie, they got all the good stuff. I'm just the guy with a fish head.\n\n\nDr. Baker:\n Do you\u2026 have any idea why your creator might have fashioned you in this\u2026 way?\n\n\nSCP-527:\n Fuck if I know.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 527.2:\n Recovered Document\n\n\nNote: When asked, SCP-527 was able to produce the following document.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow!\n You've just found yourself your very own Little Mister, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment!\n\n\nFind them all and become Mr. Collector!!\n\n\n01.
