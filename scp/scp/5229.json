Bi-weekly filtration of the containment chamber\u2019s water is to be accomplished with chlorine tablets\n1\n being inserted into the chamber until SCP-5229 is visibly clean.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5229 is an anomalous human skeleton, with the notable structural difference of SCP-5229\u2019s foot bones, hand bones, facial bones, and cranial bones being fused together into solid plates. Due to the particular structure created by the fusion, SCP-5229\u2019s extremities resemble fins, and SCP-5229\u2019s skull resembles an open-circuit diving helmet\n2\n. The faceplate of the skull is composed of keratin, giving SCP-5229\u2019s \u201cvisor\u201d the approximate appearance of a fingernail.\n\n\nDespite being heavily abnormal in structure and appearance, SCP-5229\u2019s anomalous qualities will only manifest in the event that any portion of SCP-5229 is not in direct contact with liquid. When SCP-5229 becomes active, it will proceed to animate, move towards the nearest source of water, and submerge itself, becoming inactive.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5229 was recovered from Pyramid Lake, Nevada after witnesses described a \u201cliving skeleton\u201d to local news outlets. The following log details the initial shipment of SCP-5229 to Area-14 for investigation:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-5229\u00a0Retrieval\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[CLOSE\u00a0FILE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 1:07 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Security Officer J. Sommer\n SCP-5229 was stored within the truck without issue. Seeing as it responds to lack of water, we\u2019ve left it in a standard cooler that\u2019s filled with the water from the lake. Given the distance, we\u2019ll be providing hourly updates on the situation as we make our way to Area-14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 2:15 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Security Officer H. Sommer\n Nothing to report. We made our way along Interstate-80 and are currently near Star Peak. Slight rattling where we\u2019re keeping SCP-5229, but Jean checked, and the bones are just bumping up against the side of the cooler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 2:32 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Jean Schott\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST\n Something happened with the cooler. We got a flat, and that must have knocked off the cooler cap, and before we knew it, the thing launched out and went inside Sommer. It tunneled right into his stomach. Sommer\u2019s dead for sure, there\u2019s blood everywhere, and I can\u2019t see 5229. It must still be in there, for all I know. We\u2019re all terrified, but the situation is stable, and we\u2019re trying to get the tire replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 2:43 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Jean Schott\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST UPDATE\n Just a few minutes after we fixed the tire, there was this squelching, and 5229 slid out of the hole it bore into Sommer. We all ran out of the truck and away from it, and the skeleton somehow swam into the truck itself. It\u2019s probably in the fuel tank now, and nobody\u2019s going near the truck anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 2:57 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Alex Switzer\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST UPDATE\n Jean\u2019s dead. 5229 exploded through the truck like a bullet, twisted her head off like a fucking bottle cap, and crawled down her throat. Micah and I are the only ones left. I just realized that we never told you where we were before, I can only hope that you get to Winnemucca in time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 3:11 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Alex Switzer\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST UPDATE\n I think that God just saved us. 5229 started sprinting towards Micah at what must have been faster than 30 mph, and a few inches before what would have turned Micah into a vessel, it went into a cactus just a little to the left of him. It must be going after the nearest water source, and leaving when it\u2019s tired. We\u2019ve distanced ourselves from it, and there\u2019s a few other cacti, so I can only hope that we make it out of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 3:24 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Alex Switzer\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST UPDATE\n The skeleton\u2019s just darting between cacti now, and we\u2019ve gotten to the point where everything nearby is just more cactus. I wouldn\u2019t call it stable, and I think it\u2019s a stretch to call us safe, but Micah isn\u2019t crying anymore, and that at least means something\u2019s better. I think Micah was brave enough to cry before it could have happened. Sommer didn\u2019t even flinch, Jean looked pissed, and I screamed because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of dying with tears. Only Micah had the strength to try and go out on his own terms, but it never happened, and he\u2019s still here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n\nTime of Retrieval:\n 1:00 PM, PST\n\n\nCurrent Time:\n 3:52 PM, PST\n\n\nTravel Details:\n \nProvided by Maintenance Staff Alex Switzer\n \nURGENT BACKUP REQUEST UPDATE\n MTF support just arrived. We\u2019re safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor their unwavering support and sacrifice for the Foundation, Maintenance Staff Alex Switzer and Micah Wegley have been promoted to a joint Security Supervisor position of the Foundation Nevada Department.
