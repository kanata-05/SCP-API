The temperature of the containment unit is to be maintained within a range between 2 \u00baC to 4 \u00baC. SCP-2372-A's requests for its detachment from SCP-2372 are to be denied. SCP-2372-A is to be told that it will be slated for experiments to detach it from SCP-2372 in exchange for its cooperation in translating for SCP-2372.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2372 is the preserved corpse of Chen \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, impervious to decomposition. Grains of powdered jade and silk threads are found embedded into SCP-2372's subcutis, evenly distributed throughout its body. Scarring and stitching found on SCP-2372 are indicative of amateur surgical procedures.\n\n\nSCP-2372 can produce a groan-like sound from its mouth despite the inability for its vocal folds to vibrate, which functions as its method of communication; see Paragraph 4 of \nDescription\n. In addition, it generates a fog from its umbilicus. Analysis of water droplets in the fog has identified trace amounts of pre-ejaculatory fluid.\n\n\nSCP-2372-A is an incorporeal humanoid entity which manifests from the fog generated from SCP-2372, which resembles Chen's upper torso. It is sapient and identifies itself as Chen \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588. Through vibration of its constituent water particles, SCP-2372-A is capable of speech and demonstrates equal proficiency in Cantonese as Chen \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSCP-2372-A is the only known individual which can comprehend sounds made by SCP-2372, regularly conversing with it. From SCP-2372-A's perspective, it and SCP-2372 have an apparently antagonistic relationship. While SCP-2372's perspective on its relationship with SCP-2372-A cannot be enquired independently, it is found to occasionally secrete pre-ejaculatory fluid from its urethra while interacting with SCP-2372-A.\n\n\nSCP-2372 was recovered from the Victoria Public Mortuary in Hong Kong on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1987, when SCP-2372-A manifested during SCP-2372's autopsy. After retrieving the corpse, the incident was dismissed as a hallucination on the coroner's part. An urn filled with ashes of cremated animals was presented to the kin of Chen \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum 2372-1:\n Selected Interviews with SCP-2372 and/or SCP-2372-A\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02372-A-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2372-A and SCP-2372\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Ocean Park\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview is originally conducted in Cantonese.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Park:\n Hello, please state your identity.\n\n\nSCP-2372-A:\n Chen \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.

In the original transcript, SCP-2372-A uses the term \"\u7389\u8863\" (pinyin: y\u00f9 y\u012b; literally \"jade suit\"). It refers to the \"jade burial suit\", a ceremonial burial suit composed of jade, traditionally utilised for the burial of Han Dynasty royalty. Jade burial suits were believed to delay the decomposition of the bodily soul (or \u9b44; pinyin: p\u00f2).\n\n\n2\n. Said individual was not found in the address given by SCP-2372-A during a Foundation-led raid on the Kowloon Walled City.
