No object which uses mechanical fasteners\n1\n to connect its discrete elements is to be brought within four meters of SCP-6046's container.\n\n\nUntil uncontained SCP-6046 instances are recovered, maintenance staff are to report any weak mechanical connections found on-site to Dr. Emiel Rozmun.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6046 is a set of 12 marbles, each of which cause mechanical connections within a radius of 3.4 meters to weaken. Experiments have shown them to be capable of reforming the tails of rivets as well as loosening bolts, nuts, screws and nails. SCP-6046 has no effect on adhesives.\n\n\nAddendum 6046.1:\n Incident 6046.1\n\n\nDr. Annise Silverman, the researcher formerly responsible for SCP-6046, experienced a psychotic episode following exposure to a \ncognitohazard\n2\n.\n Before Dr. Silverman was diagnosed and detained for treatment, she removed four instances of SCP-6046 from containment, none of which which were found on her person or in any of her work spaces when searched. Responsibility for SCP-6046 has been delegated to Dr. Rozmun until such time as Dr. Silverman recovers.\n\n\nAddendum 6046.2:\n Incident 6046.2\n\n\nA space heater mounted to the wall of a staff break room became dislodged, striking Researcher Simon Colbert when it fell. Colbert survived the impact, however it caused severe damage to his frontal lobe which has resulted in a number of antisocial behaviors. An uncontained instance of SCP-6046 was discovered in the same break room during the subsequent investigation.\n\n\nAddendum 6046.3:\n Archived Correspondence\n\n\nThe following recommendations from Dr. Rozmun are being considered for implementation pending review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Director Zeig Skannon\n\n\nFrom:\n Doctor Emiel Rozmun\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-6046\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the incidents these have been involved in, I thought it appropriate to move them from the \nanomalous items log\n to an official database entry. I also have some suggestions regarding their containment:\n\n\n\n\nTake a more proactive approach to recovering missing instances\n\n\nIncrease the frequency of my psych evals\n\n\nGive SCP-6046 a Euclid containment class until we're certain it doesn't manipulate circumstances to cause mental instability\n\n\n\n\nI know the evidence is only circumstantial, but I can't be the only one concerned that the thing linked to people losing their minds is a set of lost marbles which make screws come loose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
