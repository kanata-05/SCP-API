The chamber has been constructed within the habitation ring's central support structure. It can be decoupled in case of emergency and ejected from the station, after which it will remain in stable Sol orbit for later retrieval by STF-Majoris-\u03b1\u200f\u200f\u200e (\"Orion's Dogs\"),\n2\n who are temporarily stationed on Mercury until barracks on Laniakea Station finish construction.\n\n\nUnder O5 Command:\n Any physical exposure to, observation of, or communication with SCP-6686 is expressly forbidden to all staff of any clearance level.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6686 is a sentient, humanoid entity of average human height and build, composed exclusively out of QCD matter;\n3\n believed to be the densest matter in existence and theorized to only exist within the core of especially dense neutron stars.\n4\n This matter remains perfectly stable within SCP-6686, despite lacking the extreme gravitational forces that would typically be necessary to produce and maintain it, it instead only exerts the gravitational influence of an average human. Similarly, its internal and external temperature has been measured at an unchanging 30\u00b0C across its entire body, despite QCD matter in its typical environment being measured around 10\n12\n \u00b0C\n\n\nSCP-6686 emits light at an average of 860,000lm\n5\n/m\n2\n when unexposed to foreign stimuli. Through exposure-reduced footage, the only detail that can be distinguished is an oscillating image stretching across its facial topography. The image delineates a distance and angle conformal map of the celestial neighborhood of the Solar system, depicting 22 of the most proximate star systems with a notable exception of Sirius. The oscillations repeat every 8.6 seconds and begin in the center of the image where Sol is located, dimming depicted star systems systematically by proximity until each fades out fully, at which point it repeats again from the center.\n\n\nSCP-6686 possesses no internal nor external organs and is incapable of hearing or speech. However, through anomalous means, it is capable of registering visual stimuli, allowing for communication through visual morse code. Additionally, SCP-6686's luminosity sporadically fluctuates in intensity when exposed to foreign physical stimuli; reactions can range from light to extremely bright fluctuations.\n\n\nDespite having no components capable of doing so, SCP-6686 is able to receive and transmit free-space optical (FSO)\n6\n communications. This was discovered after an image captured shortly following its discovery revealed an unauthorized transmission narrowcast towards SCP-6686 originating from a Foundation-subsidiary operated satellite in Earth orbit; which received a return narrowcast from SCP-6686 shortly after. No logs of either message or their contents could be found in the SatCom database. The event is currently under investigation. For further information on the discovery of SCP-6686, see addendum below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst image of SCP-6686 captured by SOHO's LASCO C3 Lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum /// Discovery:\n SCP-6686 was discovered on 16/05/2092 through images captured by NASA's SOHO\n7\n Satellite; initially thought by astronomers to be a comet from the Kreutz Sungrazer family.\n8\n A few hours before estimated contact with the corona, the object drastically altered its trajectory without external influence; instantly decelerating into a perfectly stable heliostationary orbit of the northern polar region at a distance of 40,000km. Despite the extreme proximity to the corona, it exhibited no signs of deterioration. At this point, the Foundation is alerted by Agents embedded within NASA and the anomaly is placed under surveillance. Direct witnesses are amnesticized and a cover story is formulated; blaming the event on faulty satellite instruments due to advanced age and use far past its original service life.\n\n\nDue to its proximity to the event, Laniakea Station was ordered to temporarily monitor the object while STF-Majoris-\u03b1 was re-tasked and commanded to retrieve it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6686 mid-fusion event. Image from\n\nSTF-Majoris-\u03b1, now in deceleration burn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum /// Fusion Event:\n After remaining in heliostationary orbit for approximately 12 hours, SCP-6686 begins to deform; attaching itself to the photosphere\n9\n in the process. Over the course of 8 minutes and 36 seconds, 99.86% of its mass is absorbed into Sol, with the final 00.14% remaining perfectly\n\nstable in orbit. Laniakea Station probe LNK-SOLSAT-71 confirms\n\nremaining SCP-6686 mass to be humanoid in shape, the\n\nSTF-Majoris-\u03b1 Containment Cruiser \"Scipio Aemilianus\" is\n\nordered to approach.\n\n\nFirst recorded movement of SCP-6686 is detected at a separation of 8.6km; exiting a fetal position to gesture down towards the photosphere. Its location in orbit has now been confirmed to be directly opposite that of \nSCP-179\n. Due to atmospheric conditions, LNK-SOLSAT-71 is unable to observe any precise motions. Though after extensive review they appear to be dismissive in nature. At a separation of 0.86km, SCP-6686 returns to its fetal position and is apprehended by STF-Majoris-\u03b1 without incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nNOTICE\n\n\nRecent addenda addition lacking mandatory review by a minimum of two Level 3 Researchers.

That bootlicker of a \"Station Director\" licked it up and blindly expected there to be a good reason for it, transferred all of us to work on this\u2026 thing. Took him a month to get them to source us people to re-staff the now derelict departments.\n\n\n \n\n\n150 million\n kilometers away from Earth\u2026 what were they gonna do if we left a couple of researchers to monitor the Lookout and the \nsun?\n Noooo, there \nmust've\n been a good reason for it right?

To communicate with SCP-6686 interviewer Dr. Miriam utilizes a florescent light to transmit visual morse code which SCP-6686 responds to by altering its own luminosity.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n (\nSpeaking.\n) Alright, communication attempt #32. Here we go.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Hello, my name is Dr. Miriam and I speak to you on behalf of the SCP Foundation. Do you understand me?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n (\nSpeaking.\n) Oh, shit.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n You know English. Do you speak any other languages?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I believe so.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Would you care to elaborate?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I did. (\nPause.\n) Or maybe I didn't yet. In any case, I do.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n How did you learn these languages?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I already told you, I- (\nPause.\n) Ah, my apologies. Time, too much time. (\nPause.\n) Or maybe none at all. In any case, I've always known.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I see. Do you have a name, anything you would like me to call you?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Hm. (\nPause.\n) SCP-6686?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Oh. Huh, alright.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n A bit impersonal.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n How do you know these things?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I already told you, time. With enough time you begin to understand a lot of things, all things even, like you've always understood them (\nPause.\n) because you always have. With enough time, you need no time at all.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I don't- (\nPause.\n) Nevermind. Tell me about the fusion event. You arrived in the solar system and entered a heliostationary orbit of Sol, then proceeded to lose a significant amount of your mass into the photosphere, what happened?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Mass accumulated throughout a long voyage, and a tool for the next.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I\u2026 see. Would you mind me asking where you originate from?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n From a linear perspective, the same place as you. Same place as anyone or anything else.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Are you talking about the Big Bang?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Now that's a personable designation, yes.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n What do you mean exa-\n\n\n \n\n(\nSCP-6686 turns towards the Eastern wall of the chamber currently facing Sol and begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I would like to see. (\nSCP-6686 lifts its arm and points to the wall\n) There.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n The Sun?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes, thank you. You've been very helpf- (\nPause.\n) Oh, my apologies. You've yet to agree to my request.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n If you're asking for a window, we can't do that. There are no windows on this station, aside from being a risk to structural integrity it's a radiation hazard as well.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I'm well aware, a camera feed would suffice.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Before I decide on your request, I'd like you to clarify a few things.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n How you are able to see and register visual stimuli? You say you want this feed to \"see\", you possess no ocular organs yet you are able to see this fluorescent light which I am using to communicate with you, could you explain this?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I understand that you're naturally curious, but sometimes a question simply doesn't have an answer. I've had time, all of time, always known everything I will ever know, everything I have yet to learn, to understand. But I'll never find an answer to your question (\nPause.\n) because I don't have one right now.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n You don't k-\n\n\n \n\n(\nSCP-6686 begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I apologize, Dr. Miriam. It's been pleasant speaking to you, but I have responsibilities and a limited time frame. Although, in the end, I know I'll always be on time.\n\n\n \n\n(\nSCP-6686 proceeds to brighten significantly, forcing Dr. Miriam to vacate the interview room as the light overwhelms the photochromic glass. It does not respond to any further communication attempts and the interview is subsequently terminated.\n)\n\n\n \n\n[END LOG]\n\n[INTERVIEW DURATION: 28:08]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG - 28/06/2092\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Head Researcher Dr. Miriam\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-6686\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following interview is likewise translated from morse code. SCP-6686 has remained unmoving and unresponsive since the previous interview.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Good morning. How are you today, SCP-6686?\n\n\n \n\n(\nNo response.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n SCP-6686?\n\n\n \n\n(\nNo response.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I'm sorry but unless you comply and answer my questions my superiors will not be granting your request for a camera feed.\n\n\n \n\n(\nNo response.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n This is your last chan-\n\n\n \n\n(\nSCP-6686 begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n My apologies. (\nPause.\n) Tell me, Dr. Miriam, (\nPause.\n) how clearly can you see what's to come?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Well\u2026 You never know what's around the corner, not in my line of work. I'm surprised that you asked me a question, here I was assuming you'd already know the answer.\n\n\n \n\n(\nSCP-6686 turns away from the wall to face Dr. Miriam.\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes. (\nPause.\n) I must apologize again, this part consistently proves strenuous.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I have a few more questions for you, and if you answer them my superiors would be more than happy to provide you with a live camera feed of the sun.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Did I not- (\nPause.\n) hm, go ahead.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Let's discuss my question from our previous interview, how you're able to see. I've gathered that you don't fully understand the functions behind it, but I was hoping you could at least expand on it a bit in some capacity.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Naturally curious, yes. What I do know is that I don't see, per se. (\nPause.\n) But I feel. I feel the space between things. The space between these walls, the space between you and me, the space between the molecules of that bulb, and the space between its photons and their waves. When you are capable of processing that, gathering a mental image is not difficult. You could speak and I will understand you (\nPause.\n) but I believe this is a more apt form of communication.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n (\nSpeaking.\n) So you can understand this?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes. But let us stick to what we know, shall we?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Alright. Next question then, again I'd like you to expand on something from the last interview. You said that you originate from the Big Bang, could you elaborate?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I apologize, Dr. Miriam. But this is a sensitive topic for me and I would rather not discuss it further than that.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n SCP-6686, if you don't cooperate I can't guarantee that your request will be approved. In fact, do you not already know the outcome?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I (\nPause.\n) don't know.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n You don't know what, the outcome?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I know I'll (\nPause.\n) miss (\nPause.\n) something. (\nPause.\n) But I can never see what.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n You need to be more unambiguous.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I had made a mistake and was on the path to correct it. From the first moment, I saw clearly. I understood all I would understand (\nPause.\n) up until a certain point. At each point in my path that I couldn't clearly see past, I met a civilization. Some brilliant, others dull, some belligerent, others cooperative, but all were sentient. The only constant at each point (\nPause.\n) sentience. Each civilization like a filter smudging the details of what I will do next.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n You seem pretty sentient to me.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Out of necessity, I presume. When you're provided vision like I (\nPause.\n) it's redundant (\nPause.\n) or rather, it should've been. But when a filter is faced (\nPause.\n) it proves useful. Before each filter is torn down I always hope to finally see an answer on the other side. Each time I find myself discouraged, but I continue to do what I must. To make up for my mistake (\nPause.\n) the universe is not infinite, after all.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Excuse me, torn down?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Yes, Dr. Miriam. Curious as you are I am surprised you never asked why I was here, now you know.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I don't, actually. You're not speaking very clearly, SCP-6686.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n Hm. I suppose you're right. It is about time anyway, I can no longer see a reason to hide my intentions from you.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n And why have you?\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n To keep it simple. You seem like a highly motivated individual, and while under no means am I threatened by you, it would be counterproductive to take needless risks with such (\nPause.\n) erratic individuals. Your organization is one of great means and power clearly, and fortunately, your superiors are of more reasonable and predictable mind. Through aberrational means they could see the ripples in my wake, but in the process, they also saw there was nothing that could prevent what will come (\nPause.\n) and so they stepped out of my way.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Forgive me if I am misunderstanding you, but this sounds very much like a threat.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I've known the precise location, momentum, the past and future values of each primeval atom since the beginning of time. All that, for a thing like sentience to impede my perception. It's an aberration I can't allow to linger if the universe is to be returned to its intended state.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I'm disheartened to hear that, SCP-6686. But I can assure you these \"superiors\" you speak of won't allow you to carry out whatever it is you're doing, no matter how ancient you are. You're severely underestimating our capabilities.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n You try to understand what can't be understood, you try to apply reason to what cannot be reasoned, you try and you fail. (\nPause.\n) But at the end of the day, I am to blame. For allowing the universe to exit a state of perfect equality, for not letting us all be at peace without space for aberrations.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n Your threats will not be returned in kind.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n I feel the space between things, the space between me and that wall, the space between you and me, the space between the stars. There is so much of it, so much of the space, space that should have never been there, space that should never have separated us. I can assure you I will correct my mistake. The islands of light will be dispersed across the sea of nothing (\nPause.\n) equally.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Miriam:\n I believe that's enough for today's interview, let's try again tomorrow. Maybe you'll be in a less antagonistic mood.\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6686:\n The sun hasn't risen tomorrow, Dr. Miriam.\n\n\n \n\n[END LOG]\n\n[INTERVIEW DURATION: 58:41]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u1405\u00a0Addendum\u00a0///\u00a0Attachments\u00a0\u140a\n\n\n\n\n\u1405\u00a0Close\u00a0\u140a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\n\nprof.kdresden@scp.int\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n\n\nLaniakea-Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\nRegarding Transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n\n\n23/05/2092\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing SCP-6686's arrival in the solar system and its subsequent containment on the Station, anomalous mass-fluctuations within Sol's core have seemingly begun moving outwards towards the photosphere.\n\n\n \n\nHowever as much as I would like to keep an eye on these events, due to the sudden demand for engineering and research positions in containment of SCP-6686 under Overwatch orders, the Solar Sub-Coronal Monitoring Department and the COEWS-179 Sub-division will be shutting down until additional personnel can be sourced.

        "Addendum /// Discovery: SCP-6686 was discovered on 16/05/2092 through images captured by NASA's SOHO 7 Satellite; initially thought by astronomers to be a comet from the Kreutz Sungrazer family. 8 A few hours before estimated contact with the corona, the object drastically altered its trajectory without external influence; instantly decelerating into a perfectly stable heliostationary orbit of the northern polar region at a distance of 40,000km. Despite the extreme proximity to the corona, it exhibited no signs of deterioration. At this point, the Foundation is alerted by Agents embedded within NASA and the anomaly is placed under surveillance. Direct witnesses are amnesticized and a cover story is formulated; blaming the event on faulty satellite instruments due to advanced age and use far past its original service life.\nDue to its proximity to the event, Laniakea Station was ordered to temporarily monitor the object while STF-Majoris-\u03b1 was re-tasked and commanded to retrieve it.",
        "Addendum /// Fusion Event: After remaining in heliostationary orbit for approximately 12 hours, SCP-6686 begins to deform; attaching itself to the photosphere 9 in the process. Over the course of 8 minutes and 36 seconds, 99.86% of its mass is absorbed into Sol, with the final 00.14% remaining perfectly stable in orbit. Laniakea Station probe LNK-SOLSAT-71 confirms remaining SCP-6686 mass to be humanoid in shape, the STF-Majoris-\u03b1 Containment Cruiser \"Scipio Aemilianus\" is ordered to approach.\nFirst recorded movement of SCP-6686 is detected at a separation of 8.6km; exiting a fetal position to gesture down towards the photosphere. Its location in orbit has now been confirmed to be directly opposite that of SCP-179 . Due to atmospheric conditions, LNK-SOLSAT-71 is unable to observe any precise motions. Though after extensive review they appear to be dismissive in nature. At a separation of 0.86km, SCP-6686 returns to its fetal position and is apprehended by STF-Majoris-\u03b1 without incident."

        "INITIAL INTERVIEW LOG - 21/06/2092 INTERVIEWER: Head Researcher Dr. Miriam SUBJECT: SCP-6686 NOTE: This interview has been translated from morse code. To communicate with SCP-6686 interviewer Dr. Miriam utilizes a florescent light to transmit visual morse code which SCP-6686 responds to by altering its own luminosity. [BEGIN LOG] Dr. Miriam: ( Speaking. ) Alright, communication attempt #32. Here we go. Dr. Miriam: Hello, my name is Dr. Miriam and I speak to you on behalf of the SCP Foundation. Do you understand me? SCP-6686: Yes. Dr. Miriam: ( Speaking. ) Oh, shit. Dr. Miriam: You know English. Do you speak any other languages? SCP-6686: I believe so. Dr. Miriam: Would you care to elaborate? SCP-6686: I did. ( Pause. ) Or maybe I didn't yet. In any case, I do. Dr. Miriam: How did you learn these languages? SCP-6686: I already told you, I- ( Pause. ) Ah, my apologies. Time, too much time. ( Pause. ) Or maybe none at all. In any case, I've always known. Dr. Miriam: I see. Do you have a name, anything you would like me to call you? SCP-6686: Hm. ( Pause. ) SCP-6686? Dr. Miriam: Oh. Huh, alright. SCP-6686: A bit impersonal. Dr. Miriam: How do you know these things? SCP-6686: I already told you, time. With enough time you begin to understand a lot of things, all things even, like you've always understood them ( Pause. ) because you always have. With enough time, you need no time at all. Dr. Miriam: I don't- ( Pause. ) Nevermind. Tell me about the fusion event. You arrived in the solar system and entered a heliostationary orbit of Sol, then proceeded to lose a significant amount of your mass into the photosphere, what happened? SCP-6686: Mass accumulated throughout a long voyage, and a tool for the next. Dr. Miriam: I\u2026 see. Would you mind me asking where you originate from? SCP-6686: From a linear perspective, the same place as you. Same place as anyone or anything else. Dr. Miriam: Are you talking about the Big Bang? SCP-6686: Now that's a personable designation, yes. Dr. Miriam: What do you mean exa- ( SCP-6686 turns towards the Eastern wall of the chamber currently facing Sol and begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam. ) SCP-6686: I would like to see. ( SCP-6686 lifts its arm and points to the wall ) There. Dr. Miriam: The Sun? SCP-6686: Yes, thank you. You've been very helpf- ( Pause. ) Oh, my apologies. You've yet to agree to my request. Dr. Miriam: If you're asking for a window, we can't do that. There are no windows on this station, aside from being a risk to structural integrity it's a radiation hazard as well. SCP-6686: I'm well aware, a camera feed would suffice. Dr. Miriam: Before I decide on your request, I'd like you to clarify a few things. SCP-6686: Yes. Dr. Miriam: How you are able to see and register visual stimuli? You say you want this feed to \"see\", you possess no ocular organs yet you are able to see this fluorescent light which I am using to communicate with you, could you explain this? SCP-6686: I understand that you're naturally curious, but sometimes a question simply doesn't have an answer. I've had time, all of time, always known everything I will ever know, everything I have yet to learn, to understand. But I'll never find an answer to your question ( Pause. ) because I don't have one right now. Dr. Miriam: You don't k- ( SCP-6686 begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam. ) SCP-6686: I apologize, Dr. Miriam. It's been pleasant speaking to you, but I have responsibilities and a limited time frame. Although, in the end, I know I'll always be on time. ( SCP-6686 proceeds to brighten significantly, forcing Dr. Miriam to vacate the interview room as the light overwhelms the photochromic glass. It does not respond to any further communication attempts and the interview is subsequently terminated. ) [END LOG] [INTERVIEW DURATION: 28:08]",
        "INTERVIEW LOG - 28/06/2092 INTERVIEWER: Head Researcher Dr. Miriam SUBJECT: SCP-6686 NOTE: The following interview is likewise translated from morse code. SCP-6686 has remained unmoving and unresponsive since the previous interview. [BEGIN LOG] Dr. Miriam: Good morning. How are you today, SCP-6686? ( No response. ) Dr. Miriam: SCP-6686? ( No response. ) Dr. Miriam: I'm sorry but unless you comply and answer my questions my superiors will not be granting your request for a camera feed. ( No response. ) Dr. Miriam: This is your last chan- ( SCP-6686 begins to transmit a message, interrupting Dr. Miriam. ) SCP-6686: My apologies. ( Pause. ) Tell me, Dr. Miriam, ( Pause. ) how clearly can you see what's to come? Dr. Miriam: Well\u2026 You never know what's around the corner, not in my line of work. I'm surprised that you asked me a question, here I was assuming you'd already know the answer. ( SCP-6686 turns away from the wall to face Dr. Miriam. ) SCP-6686: Yes. ( Pause. ) I must apologize again, this part consistently proves strenuous. Dr. Miriam: I have a few more questions for you, and if you answer them my superiors would be more than happy to provide you with a live camera feed of the sun. SCP-6686: Did I not- ( Pause. ) hm, go ahead. Dr. Miriam: Let's discuss my question from our previous interview, how you're able to see. I've gathered that you don't fully understand the functions behind it, but I was hoping you could at least expand on it a bit in some capacity. SCP-6686: Naturally curious, yes. What I do know is that I don't see, per se. ( Pause. ) But I feel. I feel the space between things. The space between these walls, the space between you and me, the space between the molecules of that bulb, and the space between its photons and their waves. When you are capable of processing that, gathering a mental image is not difficult. You could speak and I will understand you ( Pause. ) but I believe this is a more apt form of communication. Dr. Miriam: ( Speaking. ) So you can understand this? SCP-6686: Yes. But let us stick to what we know, shall we? Dr. Miriam: Alright. Next question then, again I'd like you to expand on something from the last interview. You said that you originate from the Big Bang, could you elaborate? SCP-6686: I apologize, Dr. Miriam. But this is a sensitive topic for me and I would rather not discuss it further than that. Dr. Miriam: SCP-6686, if you don't cooperate I can't guarantee that your request will be approved. In fact, do you not already know the outcome? SCP-6686: I ( Pause. ) don't know. Dr. Miriam: You don't know what, the outcome? SCP-6686: I know I'll ( Pause. ) miss ( Pause. ) something. ( Pause. ) But I can never see what. Dr. Miriam: You need to be more unambiguous. SCP-6686: I had made a mistake and was on the path to correct it. From the first moment, I saw clearly. I understood all I would understand ( Pause. ) up until a certain point. At each point in my path that I couldn't clearly see past, I met a civilization. Some brilliant, others dull, some belligerent, others cooperative, but all were sentient. The only constant at each point ( Pause. ) sentience. Each civilization like a filter smudging the details of what I will do next. Dr. Miriam: You seem pretty sentient to me. SCP-6686: Out of necessity, I presume. When you're provided vision like I ( Pause. ) it's redundant ( Pause. ) or rather, it should've been. But when a filter is faced ( Pause. ) it proves useful. Before each filter is torn down I always hope to finally see an answer on the other side. Each time I find myself discouraged, but I continue to do what I must. To make up for my mistake ( Pause. ) the universe is not infinite, after all. Dr. Miriam: Excuse me, torn down? SCP-6686: Yes, Dr. Miriam. Curious as you are I am surprised you never asked why I was here, now you know. Dr. Miriam: I don't, actually. You're not speaking very clearly, SCP-6686. SCP-6686: Hm. I suppose you're right. It is about time anyway, I can no longer see a reason to hide my intentions from you. Dr. Miriam: And why have you? SCP-6686: To keep it simple. You seem like a highly motivated individual, and while under no means am I threatened by you, it would be counterproductive to take needless risks with such ( Pause. ) erratic individuals. Your organization is one of great means and power clearly, and fortunately, your superiors are of more reasonable and predictable mind. Through aberrational means they could see the ripples in my wake, but in the process, they also saw there was nothing that could prevent what will come ( Pause. ) and so they stepped out of my way. Dr. Miriam: Forgive me if I am misunderstanding you, but this sounds very much like a threat. SCP-6686: I've known the precise location, momentum, the past and future values of each primeval atom since the beginning of time. All that, for a thing like sentience to impede my perception. It's an aberration I can't allow to linger if the universe is to be returned to its intended state. Dr. Miriam: I'm disheartened to hear that, SCP-6686. But I can assure you these \"superiors\" you speak of won't allow you to carry out whatever it is you're doing, no matter how ancient you are. You're severely underestimating our capabilities. SCP-6686: You try to understand what can't be understood, you try to apply reason to what cannot be reasoned, you try and you fail. ( Pause. ) But at the end of the day, I am to blame. For allowing the universe to exit a state of perfect equality, for not letting us all be at peace without space for aberrations. Dr. Miriam: Your threats will not be returned in kind. SCP-6686: I feel the space between things, the space between me and that wall, the space between you and me, the space between the stars. There is so much of it, so much of the space, space that should have never been there, space that should never have separated us. I can assure you I will correct my mistake. The islands of light will be dispersed across the sea of nothing ( Pause. ) equally. Dr. Miriam: I believe that's enough for today's interview, let's try again tomorrow. Maybe you'll be in a less antagonistic mood. SCP-6686: The sun hasn't risen tomorrow, Dr. Miriam. [END LOG] [INTERVIEW DURATION: 58:41]",
