She swallows a pill with some coffee.\n\n\n< 01:04 > Researcher Doyle is asleep at her workstation.\n\n\n< 01:19 > Researcher Doyle wakes up. She rubs her nose with considerable effort. Camera footage is unable to determine if there is blood on her finger.\n\n\n< 01:20 > Doyle forcefully opens a desk drawer and begins searching through its contents.\n\n\n< 01:22 > After throwing the majority of the drawer's contents to the ground, Doyle retrieves a metal key. She is unable to hold the key between her fingers, accidentally dropping it into the drawer and onto the floor several times. Doyle puts the key in her palm and balls her hand into a fist. She appears to yell.\n\n\n< 01: 23 > Doyle gets out of her chair, placing her hand on the desk to support herself. She shuffles into the hallway with considerable effort. Yelling continues. Doyle begins to move towards the wall-mounted alarm system at the other end of the hallway, leaning against the wall for support.\n\n\n< 01:25 > Doyle loses her balance and falls onto the linoleum floor, dropping the key. It comes to a stop at the center of the hallway. Doyle appears to momentarily pause and yell. She crawls along her belly and retrieves the key before crawling back to the wall.\n\n\n< 01:26 > Doyle reaches the alarm system. A button is encased in clear plastic, which can be removed using her key. She holds the key with both hands, propping herself against the wall with her head and left shoulder. With great difficulty, she attempts to insert the key into the keyhole. Due to hair falling over her face, camera footage is unable to determine if she is sobbing.\n\n\n< 01:27 > The key is partially inserted into the lock. Researcher Doyle is no longer yelling. Researcher Doyle has stopped moving.\n\n\n< 01:35 > Researcher Doyle's left shoulder twitches.\n\n\n< 01:41 - 01:49 > Starting from the head and continuing down the body, several muscles tense and release in succession. Doyle does not lose balance.\n\n\n< 01:49 > Doyle steps back from the wall, maintaining her balance. Her body language no longer appears distressed. She retrieves the key from the lock, returning to and reorganizing her workstation.\n\n\n< 01:50 > Doyle returns to work, occasionally pausing to wipe tears off of her keyboard. Her eyes briefly glance towards an ant crawling along her monitor.\n\n\n< 01:58 > Doyle clocks out and exits Provisional Site-188.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Doyle's whereabouts following this event are unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRI scan of a deceased SCP-7455-1 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately quarantining civilians at Provisional Site-188 has become unsustainable. To help preserve space, civilians who have been quarantined for over 3 days and exhibit no symptoms of SCP-7455 infection are to be quarantined together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Crooner, an SCP-7455-1 instance, has been frozen alive at Provisional Site-188 for further research. Crooner was identified as an SCP-7455-1 instance after he was arrested for entering a hospital while holding a bloody paring knife in his right hand. While the reason \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 guided Crooner to the hospital is unknown, it was likely to treat the multiple lateral cuts which had removed almost all of the skin on his left arm. These cuts exposed 160 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Crooner's blood vessels to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 out of open wounds.\n\n\nMichael Crooner's health records do not indicate a history of self-harm prior to this incident. However, they do state that Crooner is a diagnosed insomniac.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersons in or near Valdez, Alaska who become suddenly and unexpectedly mute are to be considered SCP-7455-1 instances and immediately terminated via fumigation. Persons in or near Valdez who suddenly experience formication\n1\n will inevitably become SCP-7455-1 instances, and are to be terminated via fumigation. Corpses of persons who exhibited either of the above symptoms prior to death are to be fumigated. Persons sleeping in the same household as a fumigated person/corpse are to be separately quarantined in Provisional Site-188 until further notice.\n\n\nDue to Valdez's small and isolated population, Foundation monitoring of Richardson Highway and Port Valdez has been effective in controlling travel in and out of the township thus far. However, this is subject to change over time as Valdez's population increases and its city limit continues to expand.\n\n\nFoundation personnel are additionally reminded that SCP-7455 is of no significant threat to Provisional Site-188's current status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral carpenter ants were found within Provisional Site-188 after two consecutive days of heavy rain. It is unknown whether this was coincidental or related to SCP-7455. Attempts to seal Provisional Site-188 are still ongoing. Foundation monitoring of local stores has also detected a dramatic increase in insecticide purchasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Foundation security systems have flagged \np.doyle@psite-188.scp\n for suspicious activity.

While the initial incident was handled by local authorities, the following camera footage was provided to Foundation officials several months afterward.\n\n\n\n\n[21:29 - BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[SOURCE: Briarwood Apartments official security system]\n\n\nCamera perspective overlooks Hallway 1B. Ray Anderson arrives upwards from the hallway's sole staircase. He is holding a bouquet of mixed flowers in both hands.\n\n\nAfter nearly a minute, Anderson turns left from Hallway 1B and into Hallway 1E. Camera perspective changes to view another corner of the complex. Anderson stops after turning the corner to recuperate and breathe. He is visibly distressed, wiping sweat from his brow before continuing through the hallway.\n\n\nAnderson stops midway through Hallway 3E as Door 113 opens. An older woman steps out carrying food items and additional assortments. They converse briefly before Anderson disengages conversation. He rubs his left shoulder as the two leave.\n\n\nAnderson takes another left turn and continues walking.\n\n\n[SOURCE: Private home security devices belonging to Amanda Anderson]\n\n\nCamera perspective changes once more to Door 119\u2019s home security doorbell camera. Anderson stands directly in front of the doorbell. He stares at the camera momentarily before ringing.\n\n\nNobody comes to greet Anderson. He presses the button again.\n\n\nAnderson paces at the door. He waits for several minutes before checking his nearby vicinity. After confirming that he is alone, Anderson turns the doorknob. The door is unlocked.\n\n\nCamera feed changes to view the dark interior of Apartment 119 via home security devices. Anderson quietly makes his way inside from the front door, touching along the left wall to presumably locate a nearby light switch. He is successful, activating a ceiling fan light hanging above the living room, which is noticeably clean.\n\n\nAnderson speaks to determine if anyone is inside the residence, but nobody comes. After searching the Living Room and nearby Dining Room, he crosses an opening to access the kitchen. Anderson notices a line of ants spanning the tile floor and some used medical equipment.\n\n\nAnderson then searches the kitchen and locates nothing of interest. He places the bouquet on a nearby countertop and exits to the hallway.\n\n\nAnderson walks towards a closed door along the hallway. He knocks, announcing himself, before entering the room. The camera perspective changes again to view the interior of a bedroom.\n\n\nAnderson enters the bedroom to see a corpse laying atop a black mound on the bed. Several opened pill bottles containing a mix of over-the-counter medications and prescribed heart medication are also present. Miscellaneous wiring and other equipment is connecting to the corpse, feeding into a monitor display reading \u201cERROR!\u201d The black amalgamation underneath the corpse shifts. Anderson yells. It squirms. Black ants can be seen exiting the corpse from its mouth, tear ducts, ears, and crotch, crawling along medical equipment and the bed frame. Several ants are carrying eggs or larvae.\n\n\nAnderson runs out of the room. The corpse\u2019s skin and muscles begins to deflate and deform. Ants continue escaping from open orifices, occasionally tunneling out open veins and rupturing the skin from the inside.\n\n\nThe bugs disperse into open crevices along the floor and walls as authorities arrive on-scene.\n\n\n[22:04 - END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Local and Foundation authorities would later locate Amanda Anderson, age 45, deceased in her bedroom. Cause of death was determined to be sudden heart failure, which occurred before Ray Anderson\u2019s arrival.\n\n\nFoundation personnel were not aware of SCP-7455\u2019s existence prior to this recording.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Charles Wadeson (\npcs.881-etisp|nosedaw.c#pcs.881-etisp|nosedaw.c\n)\n\n\nTo:\n Jason Ridely (\npcs.hctawrevo50|yledir.j#pcs.hctawrevo50|yledir.j\n)\n\n\n \nCC:\n SCP-7455 Research Team (\npcs.881-etisp|5547#pcs.881-etisp|5547\n);\n\n\nSubject:\n RE:RE:RE:RE: Database Alarm/Documentation Update (\nIMPORTANT!\n)\n\n\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nSorry for not replying.
