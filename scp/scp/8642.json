That\u2019s not an unusual occurrence for auditors at the biggest site in the SCP Foundation; you\u2019ve run all over the place tracking down the various expenses of this or that department, all in the name of keeping spending down and productivity up. Today was unusual, though, because you\u2019re the third auditor to try and find this particular department. Your two predecessors are convinced that the department doesn\u2019t exist, but the boss made it clear that failure wouldn\u2019t be tolerated a third time. So here you are, clipboard in hand, running around like a chicken with no head, making wrong turn after wrong turn, hitting deadend after deadend\u2026\n\n\nAnd then you find it.\n\n\nTwo inconspicuous wooden doors at the very end of the most out-of-the-way hallway in the entire Foundation, one of which bears a small nameplate reading:\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation\n\nof Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 which tells you absolutely nothing about what this department actually does. You\u2019re pretty sure the Foundation doesn\u2019t even decommission SCPs anymore. Below the nameplate is a sticky note with \n\u201cWelcome to the Deadend!\u201d\n scribbled on it. You take a deep breath, hoping that this is not, in fact, a deadend, and\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou knock on the door.\n\n\n0\n\n\nYou don\u2019t knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0to\u00a0jump\u00a0to\u00a0any\u00a0page!\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\u00a0Page\u00a0List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0) Home Page\n\n\n(1) Don't Knock\n\n\n(2) Don't Knock 2\n\n\n(3) Don't Knock 3\n\n\n(4) Failure Ending\n\n\n(5) Knock\n\n\n(6) Ask Questions 1\n\n\n(7) Ask Questions 2\n\n\n(8) No Other Questions\n\n\n(9) Sit and Wait\n\n\n(10) Accept Coffee - Romance Ending\n\n\n(11) Decline Coffee - Long Wait\n\n\n(12) Investigate the papers\n\n\n(13) Ask Trio\n\n\n(14) Boring Ending\n\n\n(15) Ask about Reality Anchors\n\n\n(17) Investigate Double Doors\n\n\n(18) Dead Ending\n\n\n(19) Insist\n\n\n(20) Escape Double Doors\n\n\n(21) Comp1\n\n\n(22) Comp2\n\n\n(23) Loop1\n\n\n(24) Loop2\n\n\n(25) Loop3\n\n\n(26) Meta Ending\n\n\n(27) Q1\n\n\n(28) Q1.5\n\n\n(29) Q2\n\n\n(30) Q3\n\n\n(31) Q4\n\n\n(32) True Ending\n\n\n(33) Article\n\n\n(34) Investigate\n\n\n(35) Investigate Computer\n\n\n(36) Stay Standing Here\n\n\n(37) Not a Gamer\n\n\n(38) Epic Gamer Ending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8642\n\" by TopHatBionicle, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
