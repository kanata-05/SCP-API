assigned to the Surrealistics Department, the Antimemetics Division, and the Department of Unreality are to be monitored for inconsistencies in temperament. If any members of staff display signs of persistent anxiety, they are to be granted counselling. In order to maintain current working capacity, resigning employees are to be immediately replaced.\n\n\nDue to the outflow of staff in these jurisdictions, all funding aimed towards the three departments is to be redirected towards the maintenance and containment of already established and studied department-specific anomalies. Assets and funding intended for independent departmental research and investigative operations are to be frozen for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nPending the approval of their assigned therapists, members of staff are allowed Class-C targeted amnestic treatment at request.\n.\n \nEparch-class anomalies are non-anomalous in nature but relate to anomalous or potentially anomalous phenomena.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-6763 is a series of correlated phenomenon currently affecting members of staff within the Foundation's Surrealistics Department, the Antimemetics Division, and the Department of Unreality. Though SCP-6763's exact parameters are not fully understood, it is believed to involve a mass exodus of Foundation employees from all three departments.\n.\n \nAs of 19 July 2025, the Surrealistics Department is at 38% capacity, the Antimemetics Division is at 20%, and the Department of Unreality's capacity is inconclusive.\n The motives behind these resignations are unclear, with most members of staff being vague in their descriptions and reasoning behind their departures.\n\n\nPsychologists stationed within \nSite-\u2318\n,\n.\n \nIs this even possible?\n Site-41, and \nSite-0\n.\n \nNo, it isn't.\n reported increasing levels of stress within collective staff, data which positively correlates with the rapidly increasing rate of staff resignations from the previously stated departments.\n\n\nSCP-6763-1 is the high likelihood that individuals participating in the mass exodus from the stated departments will develop acute agoraphobia in regards to open spaces.\n\n\nADDENDUM 6763.1:\n Staff Interviews\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Sequitur,\u00a0Marcel:\u00a0Head\u00a0of\u00a0Surrealistics\u00a0Dept.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0file.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment Head Marcel Sequitur enters the room. He is visibly apprehensive as he crosses the threshold of the open doorway.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Dr. Sequitur, thank you for attending. I understand you're quite a busy man in your line of work, and appreciate you giving us your time today.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Masonet stands, reaching out to shake Sequitur's hand. Sequitur concedes.\n\n\n\n\nSequitur:\n I do understand, but is this truly necessary?\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n I'm afraid so.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Masonet seats himself on the opposite side of the interviewing table.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n The Foundation recognizes the rather unusual yet necessary tactics of your department, and when we picked up on this trend, we became rather concerned over its quite rapid acceleration.\n\n\nSequitur:\n Well, I wouldn't say that there's much to be worried about; we all drop eventually - we are flies after all, borne and spawned and swarming before we turn ourselves inside-out into the ground beneath our feet.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Yes, yes, how very true that is.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Dr. Sequitur, I wanted to highlight this attendance discrepancy with you. You must already know about it, especially since those that enter Site\u2026 Site\u2026\n\n\nSequitur:\n Site-\u2318.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Thank you, I don't believe I've taken the agnostics required to properly pronounce it. Now, I was\u2026 yes - you must already be aware of staff attendance discrepancies, especially since employees under your jurisdiction and Site are the only individuals explicitly willing to engage with such cognitive patterns, this combined with how you and your employees are the only ones able to feasibly enter and exit the facility.\n\n\nSequitur:\n Well, of course - I was very much aware of this. I would \nlike\n to say that it began with Ms. Noa, but if I try to recall it, it appears more like Mr. Guiomar. One of them - or both - were talking about potentially detatching from the main mass to pursue alternative psychoscientific routes, ones that could be considered \"safer.\" I remember sitting them at my desk and trying to calm their anxieties, but Noa or Guiomar told me that they didn't feel so comfortable anymore, working on the precipice of a bisected plane. I tried telling them that we were truly at the \npeak\n of this new engagement, what with the new Site Director, but they\u2026 I didn't fully grasp their intentions until later.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Their intentions, Dr. Sequitir?\n\n\nSequitur:\n Oh, Director, it's out of fear. They're afraid.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n What could they be afraid of?\n\n\nSquitur:\n It's not\u2026 It's not \nlike that,\n I would say, instead it's more\u2026 It isn't something that falls under our sphere of influence, and we'd rather not talk about it in-depth due to it not being under our sphere of influence.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Ok\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDirector Masonet pinches the bridge of his nose.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Well, if it's potentially memetic, I understand your precaution. We will just have to do more analysis.\n\n\nSequitur:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n One last thing; Dr. Sequitur, how come your employee registry appears to be \ngaining\n staff despite registry plummetting?\n\n\nSequitur:\n It's standard practice that on their way out, before they cast away their badges and chitter'd teeth and hurl themselves into the endward chasm, they replace their names with the names written in their throats, regarding dead memories or forgotten dreams or childhood nostalgia. These lies help keep the positions filled, though temporary, until they as employees are replaced with the standard requirements required to fulfill the job. We haven't actually been \ndeparting\n from Site-\u2318, though - we find that semantic associations tend to ricochet quite unhealthily and quite obtuse if depressurizing precautions are not met.\n\n\n\n\nSequitur lets out a forced, nervous laugh.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Marcel.\n\n\nSequitur:\n Yes, Director?\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Why are your people afraid?\n\n\nSequitur:\n Well\u2026 If I must be honest, it's because we feel safer in \nthere\n than out \nhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Heath,\u00a0Lilian:\u00a0Chief\u00a0Head\u00a0of\u00a0Anitmemetics\u00a0Div.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0file.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Antimemetics Division's chief, Lilian Heath, enters the room. She appears worn-out. There are prominent dark circles underneath her eyelids.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Ms. Heath, thank you for arriving on short notice.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Masonet stands to shake her hand.\n\n\nHeath sighs and reciprocates.\n\n\n\n\nHeath:\n Well, when the Foundation calls, you have to answer for something.\n\n\n\n\nHeath sits down, almost slumping into her chair. Director Masonet seats himself as well.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n We understand that your department is under a great amount of stress; for the record, how long have you been in your position?\n\n\nHeath:\n I was assigned chief head of the Antimemetics Division on the 3rd of September, 2023.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n And when was your department formed?\n\n\nHeath:\n 28th of July, 2023.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Fledglings, really.\n\n\nHeath:\n Well, we needed \nsomething\n to investigate them, didn't we?\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Of course, of course\u2026 now, Ms. Heath, how many members of staff were under your wing at the beginning of the department's formation?\n\n\n\n\nHeath pauses, her gaze drifting up towards the ceiling.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Ms. Heath?\n\n\n\n\nHeath's expression falters for a moment, a quick flash of anxiety crossing her face.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Ms. Heath, I don't want to as-\n\n\n\n\nHeath focuses, turning back to Director Masonet. Her expression shifts, hiding the momentary flash of fear.\n\n\n\n\nHeath:\n Yes, yes, I'm sorry\u2026 uh\u2026 I don't think\u2026 I haven't fully acclimated to mnestic treatment yet. Where were we?\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n I was just asking you ab-\n\n\nHeath:\n About staff numbers, yes\u2026 Well, off the top of my head, we had about 200 members? It was mostly Level 2 and 3 researchers, nothing too out there. Then, after about a year, we uncovered the remains of several mass-forgotten events, leading to more funding and more assigned staff. So that would make it that by early 2025, we had around\u2026 1500 members? And it was growing.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n And the drop?\n\n\nHeath:\n That\u2026 that occurred around\u2026 I'd like to say this past April. It kind of cascaded without anyone fully realizing. It didn't really concern me until some of my best researchers essentially fled the premises. All that they did to notify me was basically sending one-sentence reassignment emails before running to Employee Logistics. It was fast - \nis\n fast. I think some of them even quit mnestics cold turkey.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Did they give any reasoning whatsoever into why they resigned?\n\n\nHeath:\n Well, we all were aware of something within the division - we had started a new trial of experimental mnestics, and they were working pretty well but their side effects were mostly inconclusive.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n How so?\n\n\nHeath:\n Extensive use resulted in rising levels of anxiety, sometimes resulting in panic attacks.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Did any of your employees mention what happened during those panic attacks?\n\n\nHeath:\n Somewhat - they would feel a sense of vertigo followed by the drug's actual effects kicking in. Though, throughout its influence, they kept reporting that something felt wrong. Nobody could accurately put it into words, though.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Ms. Heath, did \nyou\n participate in these tests?\n\n\n\n\nHeath's shoulders tensen.\n\n\n\n\nHeath:\n Of course I did. They're my employees, and they're mine to protect.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Are there any side effects that you can tell us right now? Anything of note?\n\n\n\n\nHeath hesitates.\n\n\n\n\nHeath:\n If I listen carefully, I can hear something. It's faint, but it's there. Like hearing an air raid siren from miles away.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Can you elaborate?\n\n\nHeath:\n No, I don't think I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Thorley,\u00a0Alex:\u00a0Reality\u00a0Liaison\u00a0to\u00a0Unreality\u00a0Dept.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0file.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Alex Thorley does not enter the interviewing room. They have no need to enter the interviewing room, because they are already inside.\n\n\nDirector Masonet, caught off-guard, momentarily struggles to stand.\n\n\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Mx. Thorley! I didn't - I, uh, I wasn't expecting you to be so punctual.\n\n\nThorley:\n It happens. It just happens more often in my line of work.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Yes, it appears so. In regards to your department, I -\n\n\nThorley:\n I know. You won't be able to really wrap your head around it, but yes. There's somehow \nless.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Excuse me? \"Less?\"\n\n\nThorley:\n Yeah. There's less. Department files are completely wiping themselves clean, and not in the usual sense. Entire files of empty, hidden, \nvaluable\n data just -\n\n\n\n\nThey reach their hand out in front of them in a large, sweeping motion.\n\n\n\n\nThorley:\n Gone.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n And you believe that this is because\u2026?\n\n\nThorley:\n I'm not sure. My office is inactive, though. The door just leads to a blank wall now.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n If you require assistance in relocating, we'll be more than happy to -\n\n\nThorley:\n With all due respect, Director, I am fine, thank you, but there's one last thing I need to bring up.\n\n\nDir. Masonet:\n Go right on ahead.\n\n\nThorley:\n Doe told us that we weren't allowed to look up at the sky.\n\n\n\n\nThorley abruptly exits. The door remains untouched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6763.2:\n Internal Pharmaceutical Investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-17's storage facility for Class-A amnestics and Class-W mnestics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons of the three departments led to agents discovering that their common vector is the recurrent partaking of differing yet similar Foundation-standard medications in order to facilitate sufficient insight and comprehension in each respective field:\n\n\n\n\nagnostics:\n pharmaceuticals that promote semantic dissociation and non-linear thinking patterns.\n\n\nmnestics:\n pharmaceuticals that allow stronger perception, memory recall, and perceptual reinforcement in viewing antimemes.\n\n\nunmnestics:\n purpose as-of-yet not fully understood.\n\n\n\n\nThis combined with Lilian Heath's testimony led to a thorough investigation on the exact properties of each individual medication. This also lead to the discovery that the upgraded mnestics being tested by the Antimemetics Division were not approved by the Pharmaceutical Department, though they were still unknowingly disseminated amongst sub-departments as the basis for their own various pharmaceutical tools.\n.\n \nThe invention of the \"mnestic\" drug in 1873 lead to a vast expansion of cognitive-altering substances, as doctors and scientists were able to reverse-engineer specific qualities they wanted the drug to enhance.

        "Department Head Marcel Sequitur enters the room. He is visibly apprehensive as he crosses the threshold of the open doorway. Dir. Masonet: Dr. Sequitur, thank you for attending. I understand you're quite a busy man in your line of work, and appreciate you giving us your time today. Director Masonet stands, reaching out to shake Sequitur's hand. Sequitur concedes. Sequitur: I do understand, but is this truly necessary? Dir. Masonet: I'm afraid so. Director Masonet seats himself on the opposite side of the interviewing table. Dir. Masonet: The Foundation recognizes the rather unusual yet necessary tactics of your department, and when we picked up on this trend, we became rather concerned over its quite rapid acceleration. Sequitur: Well, I wouldn't say that there's much to be worried about; we all drop eventually - we are flies after all, borne and spawned and swarming before we turn ourselves inside-out into the ground beneath our feet. Dir. Masonet: Yes, yes, how very true that is. There is a pause. Dir. Masonet: Dr. Sequitur, I wanted to highlight this attendance discrepancy with you. You must already know about it, especially since those that enter Site\u2026 Site\u2026 Sequitur: Site-\u2318. Dir. Masonet: Thank you, I don't believe I've taken the agnostics required to properly pronounce it. Now, I was\u2026 yes - you must already be aware of staff attendance discrepancies, especially since employees under your jurisdiction and Site are the only individuals explicitly willing to engage with such cognitive patterns, this combined with how you and your employees are the only ones able to feasibly enter and exit the facility. Sequitur: Well, of course - I was very much aware of this. I would like to say that it began with Ms. Noa, but if I try to recall it, it appears more like Mr. Guiomar. One of them - or both - were talking about potentially detatching from the main mass to pursue alternative psychoscientific routes, ones that could be considered \"safer.\" I remember sitting them at my desk and trying to calm their anxieties, but Noa or Guiomar told me that they didn't feel so comfortable anymore, working on the precipice of a bisected plane. I tried telling them that we were truly at the peak of this new engagement, what with the new Site Director, but they\u2026 I didn't fully grasp their intentions until later. Dir. Masonet: Their intentions, Dr. Sequitir? Sequitur: Oh, Director, it's out of fear. They're afraid. Dir. Masonet: What could they be afraid of? Squitur: It's not\u2026 It's not like that, I would say, instead it's more\u2026 It isn't something that falls under our sphere of influence, and we'd rather not talk about it in-depth due to it not being under our sphere of influence. Dir. Masonet: Ok\u2026 Director Masonet pinches the bridge of his nose. Dir. Masonet: Well, if it's potentially memetic, I understand your precaution. We will just have to do more analysis. Sequitur: Thank you. Dir. Masonet: One last thing; Dr. Sequitur, how come your employee registry appears to be gaining staff despite registry plummetting? Sequitur: It's standard practice that on their way out, before they cast away their badges and chitter'd teeth and hurl themselves into the endward chasm, they replace their names with the names written in their throats, regarding dead memories or forgotten dreams or childhood nostalgia. These lies help keep the positions filled, though temporary, until they as employees are replaced with the standard requirements required to fulfill the job. We haven't actually been departing from Site-\u2318, though - we find that semantic associations tend to ricochet quite unhealthily and quite obtuse if depressurizing precautions are not met. Sequitur lets out a forced, nervous laugh. Dir. Masonet: Marcel. Sequitur: Yes, Director? Dir. Masonet: Why are your people afraid? Sequitur: Well\u2026 If I must be honest, it's because we feel safer in there than out here.",
        "The Antimemetics Division's chief, Lilian Heath, enters the room. She appears worn-out. There are prominent dark circles underneath her eyelids. Dir. Masonet: Ms. Heath, thank you for arriving on short notice. Director Masonet stands to shake her hand. Heath sighs and reciprocates. Heath: Well, when the Foundation calls, you have to answer for something. Heath sits down, almost slumping into her chair. Director Masonet seats himself as well. Dir. Masonet: We understand that your department is under a great amount of stress; for the record, how long have you been in your position? Heath: I was assigned chief head of the Antimemetics Division on the 3rd of September, 2023. Dir. Masonet: And when was your department formed? Heath: 28th of July, 2023. Dir. Masonet: Fledglings, really. Heath: Well, we needed something to investigate them, didn't we? Dir. Masonet: Of course, of course\u2026 now, Ms. Heath, how many members of staff were under your wing at the beginning of the department's formation? Heath pauses, her gaze drifting up towards the ceiling. Dir. Masonet: Ms. Heath? Heath's expression falters for a moment, a quick flash of anxiety crossing her face. Dir. Masonet: Ms. Heath, I don't want to as- Heath focuses, turning back to Director Masonet. Her expression shifts, hiding the momentary flash of fear. Heath: Yes, yes, I'm sorry\u2026 uh\u2026 I don't think\u2026 I haven't fully acclimated to mnestic treatment yet. Where were we? Dir. Masonet: I was just asking you ab- Heath: About staff numbers, yes\u2026 Well, off the top of my head, we had about 200 members? It was mostly Level 2 and 3 researchers, nothing too out there. Then, after about a year, we uncovered the remains of several mass-forgotten events, leading to more funding and more assigned staff. So that would make it that by early 2025, we had around\u2026 1500 members? And it was growing. Dir. Masonet: And the drop? Heath: That\u2026 that occurred around\u2026 I'd like to say this past April. It kind of cascaded without anyone fully realizing. It didn't really concern me until some of my best researchers essentially fled the premises. All that they did to notify me was basically sending one-sentence reassignment emails before running to Employee Logistics. It was fast - is fast. I think some of them even quit mnestics cold turkey. Dir. Masonet: Did they give any reasoning whatsoever into why they resigned? Heath: Well, we all were aware of something within the division - we had started a new trial of experimental mnestics, and they were working pretty well but their side effects were mostly inconclusive. Dir. Masonet: How so? Heath: Extensive use resulted in rising levels of anxiety, sometimes resulting in panic attacks. Dir. Masonet: Did any of your employees mention what happened during those panic attacks? Heath: Somewhat - they would feel a sense of vertigo followed by the drug's actual effects kicking in. Though, throughout its influence, they kept reporting that something felt wrong. Nobody could accurately put it into words, though. Dir. Masonet: Ms. Heath, did you participate in these tests? Heath's shoulders tensen. Heath: Of course I did. They're my employees, and they're mine to protect. Dir. Masonet: Are there any side effects that you can tell us right now? Anything of note? Heath hesitates. Heath: If I listen carefully, I can hear something. It's faint, but it's there. Like hearing an air raid siren from miles away. Dir. Masonet: Can you elaborate? Heath: No, I don't think I can.",
        "Researcher Alex Thorley does not enter the interviewing room. They have no need to enter the interviewing room, because they are already inside. Director Masonet, caught off-guard, momentarily struggles to stand. Dir. Masonet: Mx. Thorley! I didn't - I, uh, I wasn't expecting you to be so punctual. Thorley: It happens. It just happens more often in my line of work. Dir. Masonet: Yes, it appears so. In regards to your department, I - Thorley: I know. You won't be able to really wrap your head around it, but yes. There's somehow less. Dir. Masonet: Excuse me? \"Less?\" Thorley: Yeah. There's less. Department files are completely wiping themselves clean, and not in the usual sense. Entire files of empty, hidden, valuable data just - They reach their hand out in front of them in a large, sweeping motion. Thorley: Gone. Dir. Masonet: And you believe that this is because\u2026? Thorley: I'm not sure. My office is inactive, though. The door just leads to a blank wall now. Dir. Masonet: If you require assistance in relocating, we'll be more than happy to - Thorley: With all due respect, Director, I am fine, thank you, but there's one last thing I need to bring up. Dir. Masonet: Go right on ahead. Thorley: Doe told us that we weren't allowed to look up at the sky. Thorley abruptly exits. The door remains untouched.",
