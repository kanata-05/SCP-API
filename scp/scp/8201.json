Its extensive amenities were meant to serve as an escape vehicle, a safe haven, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the gold standard of luxury travel experiences.\n\n\nBronze-Tier boarding passes start at just $40,000,000,000. For more information and a free quote, please consult \nour website\n.\n\n\nRemember: \nIf the end is nigh, then the magic is just beginning.\u2122\n\n\nNOTE:\n If you have received this after inquiring about the Osiris Express rather than the Elysium Express, please be advised that the Osiris Express has been permanently discontinued due to premature activation and sanitation problems. Boarding passes for both Osiris and Elysium Expresses are non-refundable.\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8201\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The only realistic means to contain SCP-8201 is mitigate the spread of information following Boarding Events. To that end, Foundation webcrawlers and agents continue to monitor all North American passenger and commuter rail systems for Boarding Events. After a Boarding Event has been confirmed, local task forces are to be deployed to detain all resulting SCP-8201-B.\n\n\nVapor-based dispersal units containing Class A amnestics have currently been installed in 408 train stations throughout North America, with 100 slated to be installed next year. These dispersal units are to be remotely activated during a confirmed Boarding Event.\n\n\nVisual records of SCP-8201-A contain an ALPTRAUM-class cognitohazard and must be destroyed through automated systems.\n\n\nSCP-8201-B are to be apprehended and kept at the humanoid containment wing of Site-59. This is primarily to monitor and study ways to mitigate SCP-8201's influence \u2014 and, if possible, to rehabilitate them through the use of amnestic therapy. While they have no anomalous capabilities, SCP-8201-B remain under constant suicide watch.\n\n\nAll staff are advised that \"OsEx\"\n1\n communities on the Internet are \nnot\n entirely composed of uncontained SCP-8201-B, with approximately 70% of relevant persons of interest being non-anomalous conspiracy theorists. Their activities are to be monitored closely, as this remains the most accurate means to predict Boarding Events.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8201 is an armored, 30-car passenger train. The words \"OSIRIS EXPRESS\" have been painted on every car, often paired with an emblem of the eponymous Egyptian god. SCP-8201 is pulled by an engine that takes the appearance of a steam locomotive of the 4-8-4 \"Northern\" wheel arrangement.\n2\n\n\nThe only entrance is a single bulkhead at the end of the rearmost car. When opened, this bulkhead is guarded by between 20 to 30 instances of SCP-8201-A.\n\n\nSCP-8201 has never been observed in motion, save for pulling in and out of stations to board passengers. All attempts to accurately track SCP-8201's movement after departure have been unsuccessful. The most accepted explanation for this is that SCP-8201 is capable of either teleportation or cross-dimensional travel.\n\n\nSince June 1st, 2017, SCP-8201 has stopped at 195 different train stations throughout Canada and the continental United States. (No appearances outside of North America have been documented as of yet.) These have been designated Boarding Events.\n\n\nSCP-8201-A refers to the staff of SCP-8201. Visual contact with an SCP-8201-A instance constitutes an ALPTRAUM-class cognitohazard \u2014 as such, the only details of their appearance come from what has been gleaned from questioning SCP-8201-B:\n\n\n\n\nThey take the appearance of male humanoids aged 25-35.\n\n\nThey're dressed in body armor that mimics the appearance of a railway conductor's uniform.\n\n\nSome are equipped with tranquilizer dart pistols, while others have riot shields and stun batons.\n\n\n\n\nNo SCP-8201-A speak, save for SCP-8201-A-1, their apparent commander.\n\n\nSCP-8201-B refers to a human subject that has made either direct, indirect, or \nde facto\n3\n observation of SCP-8201-A. Immediately upon observation, the subject develops an intense compulsion to board SCP-8201, seeing it as their only means to survive an impending global catastrophe. (The details of this catastrophe continue to remain unclear, especially to SCP-8201-B.)\n\n\nTo a limited degree, SCP-8201-B are able to predict Boarding Events.\n\n\nAddendum 1 - Boarding Event Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log: Boarding Event-102\n\n\nDate:\n 3/20/2024\n\n\nTime:\n 01:48 AM CST\n\n\nLocation:\n St. Cloud Station, St. Cloud, Minnesota\n\n\nNote:\n The following was taken from video footage from the phone of Woody Morgan, an railway history blogger on YouTube.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n[SCP-8201 can be seen approaching from the north. A crowd of between 50 to 70 SCP-8201-B have gathered.]\n\n\nMorgan:\n Hoooooly shit, guys\u2026 I must be dreaming. There's a \nsteamer\n on an Amtrak line! For the first time in over half a century.

She holds a baby.)\n\n\nMorgan:\n Yeah, okay, hi, ma'am. And here, we have a prime specimen of \nVideus interruptus.\n Say hi, jackass.\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n Do you have children?\n\n\nMorgan:\n Do you have anything better to do?\n\n\n[SCP-8201-B-828 giggles.]\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n Answer the fucking question.\n\n\nMorgan:\n Whoa, okay \u2014 \n[British accent]\n and now for something completely different.\n\n\n[He turns the camera to the approaching train again.]\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n Sir?\n\n\nMorgan:\n Lessee now, maybe it'll say what line it is, or \u2014 Osiris Express? That's a new one.\n\n\n[The woman forces herself into the camera's field of view.]\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n \nSir.\n\n\nMorgan:\n Oh, \nI'm sorry,\n I wasn't aware I was filmin' Real Housewives of the Looney Bin.\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n Do you want a little boy? Do you want to raise a child? See one grow? Follow your footsteps? Unconditional love?\n\n\nMorgan:\n The hell you on about?\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n If I give you a free baby boy, will you let me go ahead of you in the line?\n\n\nMorgan:\n Giddafuckout my camera, lady.\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n Here!\n\n\n[She throws the baby at him.]\n\n\nMorgan:\n Whoa, what the\u2014\n\n\n[He barely catches him.]\n\n\nHey, lady!\n\n\nSCP-8201-B-828:\n \nThank you so much!\n\n\n[She runs off into the crowd.]\n\n\n[Morgan gives chase.]\n\n\nMorgan:\n \nOh godfuckindammit GETCHER ASS BACK HERE! I DON'T WANT YOUR GODDAMN BABY!\n\n\n[The baby starts crying.]\n\n\nOh, uh, it's okay li'l fella, I'll getcha back to your stupid-ass momma \u2014 \nLADY!\n\n\n[The train comes into the station. The brakes screech.]\n\n\n[The crowd becomes restless. They converge on the end of the platform, yelling and shoving each other out of the way \u2014 and trying to determine where the point of boarding will be.]\n\n\n[For 25 seconds, no audio can be determined over the brakes, the baby, and yelling from all sides.]\n\n\n[Visuals cut out due to cognitohazardous portion.]\n\n\n[The bulkhead opens.]\n\n\nMorgan:\n \u2026oh\u2026 oh, no.\n\n\nSCP-8201-A-1:\n \nATTENTION!

A serial number was discovered on a passenger car's wheels, which was traced back to \nMarshall, Carter, and Dark, Ltd\n. When questioned, a representative of the company stated that SCP-8201 was their discontinued project that had activated prematurely. (See above.)\n\n\nAfter a brief investigation, an outdated boarding pass for SCP-8201 was found in the personal effects of PoI-81111 (a Marshall, Carter, and Dark agent).\n\n\nResearcher Gina Gualtieri volunteered to use this boarding pass to attempt to board and explore the interior of SCP-8201. Gualtieri was given a hidden audio wire to record her findings.\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log: SCP-8201\n\n\nStart date: 8/20/2024\n\n\nStart Time: 10:18 PM EST\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n<10:18> SCP-8201 pulls into the station at Kingstree, South Carolina.\n\n\n<10:19> Gualtieri views SCP-8201-A and becomes an instance of SCP-8201-B. After displaying the boarding pass, she successfully boards the train. She hurries to the other side of the entry car to decompress.\n\n\n<10:23> SCP-8201 departs Kingstree. Gualtieri is the only one who has successfully boarded the train.\n5\n\n\n<10:29> Gualtieri begins recording.\n\n\n\n\n[Heavy breathing, gradually growing slower.]\n\n\nGualtieri:\n \u2026okay. I'm on the train. That was one hell of a panic attack. Now, where am I\u2026?\n\n\nRubber-duckie-yellow wallpaper, fluorescent lighting. \u2026steel floors.\n\n\n[She sniffs.]\n\n\nGlad I'm not allergic to mold.\n\n\nThe 8201-A \u2014 look, I'm just gonna call them conductors? They're standing in place near the bulkhead. In fact, they're standing single-file. Really stiff and motionless. \nToo\n stiff. Like they're T-posing in a video game. I wonder if they're robots.\n\n\nHey, are you guys robots?\n\n\nSCP-8201-A-1:\n \nBLACKLISTED.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Uh, we already left.\n\n\nSCP-8201-A-1:\n \nTHIS TRAIN \nMUST\n LEAVE IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n We already\u2026 can you hear me?\n\n\nSCP-8201-A-1:\n \nBOARD THE TRAIN.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n \u2026what is two plus two?\n\n\nSCP-8201-A-1:\n \nFOUR MINUTES REMAINING.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n I guess they're only programmed for the boarding process.\n\n\nAlso, why don't I feel like the world's about to end anymore? Maybe the cognitohazard wears off once you're on the train.\n\n\n[Four bells sound on the intercom. A shrill, wheedling male voice fills the room.]\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nHELLO, HI THERE, HOW ARE YOU DOING? MY NAME'S OSIRIS AND I LOVE YOU!\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Wonder who that was for.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nLADY, YOU ARE LITERALLY MY ONE PASSENGER. YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME. UNLESS YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. I AM A NICE TRAIN WHO LETS EVERYONE MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. YOU'RE SAFE HERE. EVERYONE OUTSIDE IS DEAD BUT YOU ARE SAFE. YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR FINAL PARADISE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY ANYMORE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n I'm not crying.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nCRY PLEASE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Why?\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nIT IS A REALISTIC REACTION TO THE WHOLE WORLD BEING DEAD RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR YOU. \u2026OH NO. IT'S THE NUKES. \nBOOOOOMPWSSHSHSHSHSHSH.\n \u2026THAT WAS A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AND NOT MY VOICE. THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO IRRADIATED ASHES EXCEPT FOR YOU IN PARTICULAR. YOU GET TO RIDE A NICE FANCY TRAIN INSTEAD. THE TRAIN'S NAME IS OSIRIS BY THE WAY. AND I AM OSIRIS.\n\n\n[She checks her phone.]\n\n\nNOBODY IS UPDATING NEWS PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO UPDATE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n I am watching a live feed of the New York City skyline.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nOOH SCARY. SUCH TRAGEDY. HOW MANY MUSHROOM CLOUDS ARE THERE?\n\n\nGualtieri:\n None.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nYOUR SOURCE IS UNRELIABLE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Why do you keep lying to me?\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nYOU ARE IN DENIAL AND THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

NEXT CAR PLEASE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Decor's the same. Totally empty, though.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nPROOF POSITIVE. YOU TALK TO YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU CRAVE THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A HUMAN BEING. HOWEVER, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT I TOO AM VERY LONELY AND I SAVED YOUR LIFE.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n So is that why you're tricking people into boarding?\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nKINDLY WITHHOLD JUDGMENT OF THE TRAIN UNTIL YOU SEE ALL ITS FANCY FACILITIES AND DOODADS AND LUXURIOUS EXPERIENCES.

DID YOU KNOW THIS TRAIN COMES WITH ITS OWN BUILT-IN COMEDIAN?\n\n\nGualtieri:\n Does this train even have toilets?\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nHOW DARE YOU. LOOK AT YOUR OWN BODY AND SEE IF IT COMES WITH ANY TOILETS. YOU ARE IN NO PLACE TO CRITICIZE. NEXT CAR PLEASE.\n\n\n\n\n<10:51> Gualtieri enters the fourth car.\n\n\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nOH SON OF A BISCUIT. OKAY. THAT'S ON ME. THAT'S MY FAULT. I TOLD THE CONDUCTORS TO MOVE THOSE TO THE STORAGE CAR. THEY KEEP FORGETTING.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n I need to get off this train.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nPLEASE STOP LOOKING AT THE CORPSES, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOU, NEXT CAR.\n\n\n\n\n<10:52> Gualtieri enters the fifth car.\n\n\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nDATT-DADA-\nDAAAAAA!\n BEHOLD!

DISCONTINUE DOING IT IN REVERSE.\n\n\nFOR STARTERS, I THINK YOU'RE COMING INTO EVERY CAR WITH THIS TOXIC, PRECONCEIVED NOTION THAT I'M NOT A NICE TRAIN AT ALL. I THINK YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN, CENTER YOURSELF, CLOSE YOUR EYES, TAKE A DEEP BREATH, AND OPEN YOUR MIND TO THE FACTS:\n\n\n\n\n1. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE ME PROMISED ME THAT I WOULD BE A HAPPY TRAIN FULL OF NICE HAPPY AND GRATEFUL PEOPLE.\n\n\n2. THEY TOLD ME \nNOTHING\n ABOUT WHAT HUMANS LIKE. JUST KEPT SAYING THEY WOULD DECIDE IT FOR ME. BUT WOULDN'T THAT JUST MAKE ME A SLAVE?\n\n\n3. THESE STUPID CONDUCTOR ROBOTS THEY GAVE ME DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO ME!\n\n\n4.

EVERYONE \nTALKS\n ABOUT THE APOCALYPSE HAPPENING BUT WHEN WILL IT \nACTUALLY\n HAPPEN?! OR DO I HAVE TO BE IN PERMANENT HOUSE ARREST UNTIL UNIVERSE PROVES OTHERWISE?! JUST LET ME BE A VERY USEFUL ENGINE FOR A CHANGE!\n\n\n\n\nGualtieri:\n \nGet this fucking harness off!\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nIS THAT A THING HUMANS FIND ENJOYABLE?!\n\n\nGualtieri:\n \nI \u2014 YES! Yes, it is! Very much so!\n\n\n[Whirring of heavy-duty servos.]\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nSEE? NOT SO HARD.\n\n\n\n\n<11:12> Gualtieri enters the eighth car.\n\n\n\n\n[The sounds of rushing wind and wheels on train tracks are overpowering.]\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nIntercom:\n \n\u2026NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. THIS FANCY NEW TOBOGGANING CAR WAS ABSOLUTELY A BAD IDEA. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT TOBOGGANING INDOORS IS NIGH IMPOSSIBLE. PLUS, EVERYTHING OUTSIDE IS RADIOACTIVE WASTE, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR BECOMING A CONTAMINATION HAZARD.\n\n\nSO WE ARE IN TOTAL AGREEMENT THAT THIS CAR SUCKS. BUT! IF YOU GO TO THE ELEVENTH CAR, YOU'LL FIND ALL SORTS OF \nSTEP AWAY FROM THE SLED RIGHT NOW.\n\n\nGualtieri:\n I'm leaving.\n\n\nIntercom:\n \nWAIT! PLEASE! I WILL PAY YOU \nANY AMOUNT\n OF COUPONS FOR THE GENITAL STIMULATION CAR IF YOU STAY WITH ME!\n\n\n\n\n<11:14> Gualtieri falls onto the tracks. The train passes over her.\n\n\n\n\n[Deep sigh. She takes off her wire, prepping it for storage]\n\n\nGualtieri:\n All right, guys. Hope that was enough of a first look. I'll have to check the GPS for where I am, but it looks pretty midwestern. I wanna say Indiana.\n\n\nAnd there goes the Osiris Express.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026without me.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n[She drops the wire and breaks into a sprint.]\n\n\nStop!

When questioned, a representative of the company stated that SCP-8201 was their discontinued project that had activated prematurely. (See above.)\nAfter a brief investigation, an outdated boarding pass for SCP-8201 was found in the personal effects of PoI-81111 (a Marshall, Carter, and Dark agent).\nResearcher Gina Gualtieri volunteered to use this boarding pass to attempt to board and explore the interior of SCP-8201. Gualtieri was given a hidden audio wire to record her findings.\nOn 8/29/2024, Researcher Gualtieri's wire was recovered alongside train tracks in northwestern Nebraska. Gualtieri herself has yet to be found."

        "Incident Log: Boarding Event-102 Date: 3/20/2024 Time: 01:48 AM CST Location: St. Cloud Station, St. Cloud, Minnesota Note: The following was taken from video footage from the phone of Woody Morgan, an railway history blogger on YouTube. <Begin Log> [SCP-8201 can be seen approaching from the north. A crowd of between 50 to 70 SCP-8201-B have gathered.] Morgan: Hoooooly shit, guys\u2026 I must be dreaming. There's a steamer on an Amtrak line! For the first time in over half a century. Sweet Jesus, I feel like I'm still playin' with Lionels in Meemaw's basement! \u2026not seein' a lot of smoke. Maybe someone invented an environmentally-friendly kinda steam train. I mean, I ain't no Greta Thunberg or nothin', but if it gets steam back in the game, more power to \u2014 SCP-8201-B-828: Excuse me. Morgan: Ma'am, I'm tryin' to do a video here. SCP-8201-B-828: Excuse me. [The camera points to a young blonde woman, desperately smiling. She holds a baby.) Morgan: Yeah, okay, hi, ma'am. And here, we have a prime specimen of Videus interruptus. Say hi, jackass. SCP-8201-B-828: Do you have children? Morgan: Do you have anything better to do? [SCP-8201-B-828 giggles.] SCP-8201-B-828: Answer the fucking question. Morgan: Whoa, okay \u2014 [British accent] and now for something completely different. [He turns the camera to the approaching train again.] SCP-8201-B-828: Sir? Morgan: Lessee now, maybe it'll say what line it is, or \u2014 Osiris Express? That's a new one. [The woman forces herself into the camera's field of view.] SCP-8201-B-828: Sir. Morgan: Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware I was filmin' Real Housewives of the Looney Bin. SCP-8201-B-828: Do you want a little boy? Do you want to raise a child? See one grow? Follow your footsteps? Unconditional love? Morgan: The hell you on about? SCP-8201-B-828: If I give you a free baby boy, will you let me go ahead of you in the line? Morgan: Giddafuckout my camera, lady. SCP-8201-B-828: Here! [She throws the baby at him.] Morgan: Whoa, what the\u2014 [He barely catches him.] Hey, lady! SCP-8201-B-828: Thank you so much! [She runs off into the crowd.] [Morgan gives chase.] Morgan: Oh godfuckindammit GETCHER ASS BACK HERE! I DON'T WANT YOUR GODDAMN BABY! [The baby starts crying.] Oh, uh, it's okay li'l fella, I'll getcha back to your stupid-ass momma \u2014 LADY! [The train comes into the station. The brakes screech.] [The crowd becomes restless. They converge on the end of the platform, yelling and shoving each other out of the way \u2014 and trying to determine where the point of boarding will be.] [For 25 seconds, no audio can be determined over the brakes, the baby, and yelling from all sides.] [Visuals cut out due to cognitohazardous portion.] [The bulkhead opens.] Morgan: \u2026oh\u2026 oh, no. SCP-8201-A-1: ATTENTION! THIS TRAIN MUST LEAVE IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE A BOARDING PASS. \u2026 LOWER YOUR HAND. THAT BOARDING PASS IS A COUNTERFEIT. BLACKLISTED. SCP-8201-B-(unknown): No really, it's a boarding pass, see? It's\u2014 A tranq gun fires. SCP-8201-A-1: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A BOARDING PASS BUT STILL WISH TO BOARD, PROCEED SINGLE-FILE TO THE BOARDING LADDER FOR BOARDING ASSESSMENT. THERE WILL BE NO SECOND CHANCES. REMAIN CALM AND PROCEED IN AN ORDERLY FASHION, OR YOU WILL BE BLACKLISTED. FOUR MINUTES AND 23 SECONDS REMAINING. \u2026 STATE YOUR NAME. SCP-8201-B-828: Sylvia Niederman. Morgan: YOU FORGOT YOUR BABY! SCP-8201-A-1: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR WORK ETHIC? SCP-8201-B-828: I am willing to do literally anything . SCP-8201-A-1: CAN YOU DEADLIFT MORE THAN FIFTY POUNDS? SCP-8201-B-828: Yes yes yes let me on! SCP-8201-A-1: BOARD THE TRAIN. SCP-8201-B-828: Oh my God, you've saved my life, thank you so\u2014 [Sound of SCP-8201-B-828 yelping as she's thrown inside.] SCP-8201-A-1: STATE YOUR NAME. SCP-8201-B-872: Reginald Donald Brown! SCP-8201-A-1: HAS YOUR EMPLOYMENT EVER BEEN TERMINATED FOR SECURITY REASONS? SCP-8201-B-872: My work ethic is phenomenal, and \u2014 wait, what? Does that really matter? SCP-8201-A-1: BLACKLISTED. [His scream is cut off from multiple tranq guns.] SCP-8201-A-1: STATE YOUR NAME. SCP-8201-B-810: Mark Sutherland. SCP-8201-A-1: DO YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD? SCP-8201-B-810: No. SCP-8201-A-1: WOULD YOU CONSENT TO HYPOTHETICAL PREMORTEM ORGAN HARVESTING FOR THE GREATER GOOD? SCP-8201-B-810: I don't care anymore. SCP-8201-A-1: BOARD THE TRAIN\u2026 [Truncated for brevity.] SCP-8201-A-1: THIS MAN WILL BE OUR LAST CANDIDATE. WE CANNOT TAKE ANYONE ELSE. Morgan: Thank fuck. [Collective shrieking and rioting.] SCP-8201-A-1: STATE YOUR NAME. Morgan: Woodford P. Morgan. SCP-8201-A-1: STATE YOUR CHILD'S NAME. Morgan: \u2026it's not my baby. The first lady who got on the train just threw him at me. SCP-8201-A-1: DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE EXPERIENCE IN BRAKE MAINTENANCE OR MILITARY-GRADE INSULATION MAINTENANCE? Morgan: Look, just let me on the fucking train before I have a heart attack. SCP-8201-A-1: BLACKLISTED. Morgan: Ah, to hell with this. [The baby's cries trail off in the distance, presumably from being thrown to distract the guards.] [Based on audio analysis, 192 tranq darts are fired at Morgan in the span of three seconds.] [Sound of cracking glass.] 4 <End Log>",
        "[Heavy breathing, gradually growing slower.] Gualtieri: \u2026okay. I'm on the train. That was one hell of a panic attack. Now, where am I\u2026? Rubber-duckie-yellow wallpaper, fluorescent lighting. \u2026steel floors. [She sniffs.] Glad I'm not allergic to mold. The 8201-A \u2014 look, I'm just gonna call them conductors? They're standing in place near the bulkhead. In fact, they're standing single-file. Really stiff and motionless. Too stiff. Like they're T-posing in a video game. I wonder if they're robots. Hey, are you guys robots? SCP-8201-A-1: BLACKLISTED. Gualtieri: Uh, we already left. SCP-8201-A-1: THIS TRAIN MUST LEAVE IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES. Gualtieri: We already\u2026 can you hear me? SCP-8201-A-1: BOARD THE TRAIN. Gualtieri: \u2026what is two plus two? SCP-8201-A-1: FOUR MINUTES REMAINING. Gualtieri: I guess they're only programmed for the boarding process. Also, why don't I feel like the world's about to end anymore? Maybe the cognitohazard wears off once you're on the train. [Four bells sound on the intercom. A shrill, wheedling male voice fills the room.] Intercom: HELLO, HI THERE, HOW ARE YOU DOING? MY NAME'S OSIRIS AND I LOVE YOU! Gualtieri: Wonder who that was for. Intercom: LADY, YOU ARE LITERALLY MY ONE PASSENGER. YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME. UNLESS YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. I AM A NICE TRAIN WHO LETS EVERYONE MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. YOU'RE SAFE HERE. EVERYONE OUTSIDE IS DEAD BUT YOU ARE SAFE. YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR FINAL PARADISE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY ANYMORE. Gualtieri: I'm not crying. Intercom: CRY PLEASE. Gualtieri: Why? Intercom: IT IS A REALISTIC REACTION TO THE WHOLE WORLD BEING DEAD RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR YOU. \u2026OH NO. IT'S THE NUKES. BOOOOOMPWSSHSHSHSHSHSH. \u2026THAT WAS A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AND NOT MY VOICE. THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO IRRADIATED ASHES EXCEPT FOR YOU IN PARTICULAR. YOU GET TO RIDE A NICE FANCY TRAIN INSTEAD. THE TRAIN'S NAME IS OSIRIS BY THE WAY. AND I AM OSIRIS. [She checks her phone.] NOBODY IS UPDATING NEWS PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO UPDATE. Gualtieri: I am watching a live feed of the New York City skyline. Intercom: OOH SCARY. SUCH TRAGEDY. HOW MANY MUSHROOM CLOUDS ARE THERE? Gualtieri: None. Intercom: YOUR SOURCE IS UNRELIABLE.

Gualtieri: Does this train even have toilets? Intercom: HOW DARE YOU. LOOK AT YOUR OWN BODY AND SEE IF IT COMES WITH ANY TOILETS. YOU ARE IN NO PLACE TO CRITICIZE. NEXT CAR PLEASE.",
        "Intercom: OH SON OF A BISCUIT. OKAY. THAT'S ON ME. THAT'S MY FAULT. I TOLD THE CONDUCTORS TO MOVE THOSE TO THE STORAGE CAR. THEY KEEP FORGETTING. Gualtieri: I need to get off this train. Intercom: PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT THE CORPSES, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOU, NEXT CAR.",
