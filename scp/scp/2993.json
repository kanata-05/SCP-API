Access to SCP-2993 is available only to staff Level 2 and above. Any personnel wishing to use SCP-2993 must contact the current leading researcher assigned to SCP-2993.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2993 appears to be an unremarkable pair of aviator sunglasses with no visible markings or logos. The durability of SCP-2993 is unremarkable and without proper care may be damaged in a way similar to its non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n\nWhen viewed from the front, SCP-2993 is opaque and acts as a mirror. No form of radiation is able to pass through SCP-2993, including visible light. Replacing parts of SCP-2993 while preserving its original function is possible as long as more than 50% of the original mass is present. The most notable feature of SCP-2993 occurs when it is viewed from behind: SCP-2993 shows exactly six hours behind the period of time the user is wearing them (see Addendum SCP-2993-1).\n\n\nAddendum SCP-2993-1:\n A Junior Researcher under Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 compared security footage to the view through SCP-2993 while searching for any abnormalities that lead to the containment breach of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Security footage showed the researcher writing on a piece of paper \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the alphabet. Six hours later, the researcher (using SCP-2993) noted that the sentence read, \"A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent,\" a sentence that also contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.\n\n\nFurther testing has revealed that the past as viewed through SCP-2993 contains many minor changes. Examples include Junior Researcher B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's hair as shoulder-length instead of neck-length, an Agent's first name spelled as Hannah instead of Hanna, and the color of Dr A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's favorite pen appeared green instead of red.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-2993-2:\n Due to differences in details found when viewing the past while wearing SCP-2993 (detailed in Addendum SCP-2993-1), Dr A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 used SCP-2993 to look over notes he had taken on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 six hours before. The notes on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appeared to be minimally different, excluding ten millimeter differences in length of the steel bars keeping SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in containment. Although this difference appears negligible, the difference in length would normally lead to a security breach by SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAlthough these dimensions should have caused a containment breach for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, no such breach occurred. Approximately three hours later, when Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 used SCP-2993 to observe the containment area of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 did not break free of containment, and the differences in measurement observed by Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 while wearing SCP-2993 were non-existent when he performed measurements of the containment unit himself.\n\n\n\n\nMemo from Dr: A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: \"Is what SCP-2993 shows us consistent? We know that it maintains at least some level of accuracy in regards to reality, at least nominally, as noted in Addendum SCP-2993-1. Is SCP-2993 selectively altering information? I can't help but wonder what mechanisms influence the effects of SCP-2993.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment-Log\u00a02993-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\nAt 23:54, 5/11/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed notes on SCP-2993. Exactly six hours later, Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 donned SCP-2993 and viewed himself looking over his notes. Content of the files appeared completely unchanged other than a select testing log that had been appended. The log contained tests that Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had never conducted.

Although differences between recordings of the interview and Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's observation were minimal at first, the end of the interview observed by Dr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was different than the recording.
