Image captured in 1946.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-1542\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the unknown nature of SCP-1542 manifestations, no direct containment procedures have been devised. Research into SCP-1542 has been assigned to the Spectral Division.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1542 is the designation of a spectral phenomenon that manifests in the underground levels of Site-34. Subjects who witness SCP-1542 manifestations claim to have observed one or several feline entities in the distance, which flee when approached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-34 under construction, image taken 1941.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHistory:\n Following the construction of Site-34, several staff members submitted reports of feline entities roaming the Site. Despite various sightings, no physical proof of their presence could be provided, and as such, they were assigned an SCP designation in 1947.\n\n\nFour months after initial SCP designation, a foul odor was reported in the boiler room of Site-34. Initially believed to be the result of a burst pipe, investigation revealed a corpse of an SCP-1542 instance in the corner of the room. The remains were handed over to the Spectral Division for investigation.\n\n\nA necropsy was performed on the corpse in an attempt to understand the anomalous nature of SCP-1542. Several partially digested pieces of food were found in the corpse's stomach, which matched the food served in the cafeteria at Site-34 during the days before its death, as well as one partially digested rodent. Furthermore, the body showed bite marks from scavenging rodents.\n\n\nFollowing these discoveries, SCP-1542 was assumed to be a phenomenon resulting in the manifestation of feline entities and investigation of the anomaly was reassigned to the Ectoentropic Division.\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \"Ectoentropic\" is a term used for anomalies that challenge thermodynamic entropy. Typically, this manifests as an anomaly that generates matter from nothing.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVIEW THE MOST RECENT SCP-1542 FILE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1542\n\" by Uncle Nicolini, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
