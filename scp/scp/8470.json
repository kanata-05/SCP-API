At approximately 12:45PM, every October 10th, Doctor Sophia will spontaneously combust. A minute post-combustion, Doctor Sophia will reform without any memory of the event, and continue her activities for the day as if nothing has happened. Attempts to inform her about the event have resulted in responses denying the ability of a human to spontaneously combust.\n\n\nIncident Log:\n 10/10/2024\n\n\n\n\nPRESENT:\n Dr. Lilyann A. Sophia, Dr. Winston K. Boyle\n\n\n\n\n(\nBoyle leads Sophia into a room with an airtight valve door, which is propped open by two large bricks.\n)\n\n\n(\n12:43PM.\n)\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n Oh, you didn't have to book a room for me.\n\n\nBOYLE:\n I assure you, I did.\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n Well, I appreciate it. Who's gonna come?\n\n\nBOYLE:\n I think Own and Draws are gonna bring people.\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n That's great. I love them. Make sure you bring some alcohol, it's my birthday after all.\n\n\nBOYLE:\n Mhm. Will do.\n\n\n(\nBoyle begins walking toward the door.\n)\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n Hey, uh, where are you going?\n\n\nBOYLE:\n Gotta pick up the cake. You know. The cake.\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n (\nNodding.\n) I got you! Sorry to hold you up, Winston.\n\n\n(\nBoyle leaves, kicking the bricks out of the way as the door slams shut.\n)\n\n\n(\nDr. Sophia twiddles her fingers, whistling a tune.\n)\n\n\n(\n12:44PM.\n)\n\n\n(\nShe stands up, exhaustedly stumbling around the room. She stops in front of a large sign on the wall, reading \"EXPLOSIVE PROOF'D\".\n)\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n Huh. I don't think that's how you spell proofed.\n\n\n(\nShe grunts, kicking a bit of dust on the floor.\n)\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n Yeah. Absolutely not. I should call someone about this typo.\n\n\n(\nShe looks at the ground and sighs, before looking back up at the sticker.\n)\n\n\nSOPHIA:\n And why the Hell does this room have to be explosive proo\u2014\n\n\n(\n12:45PM.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8469\n | SCP-8470 | \nSCP-8471\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8470\n\" by DoctorLilithSophia, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
