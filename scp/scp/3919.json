The full name of SCP-3919-A and access to any document in which this is recorded is restricted to a single member of Level-1 personnel at all times. Under no circumstances should any item, object, location or concept be referred to by terminology relating to the personal details of SCP-3919-A.\n\n\nEach instance of SCP-3919-B requires an exclusion zone of variable size, with appropriate cover stories prepared for SCP-3919-B in public spaces. Outside of controlled testing circumstances, interaction with SCP-3919-B instances should be conducted remotely, with appropriate mechanisms in place to retrieve personnel from within SCP-3919-B's area of influence in case of accident.\n\n\nA Foundation initiative to remove references to SCP-3919-A from public records and amnesticise civilians with knowledge of SCP-3919-A operates in the Czech Republic and international academic settings. As of 2009, all known references to SCP-3919-A in public records have been redacted, with original documents archived by the Foundation. Works by SCP-3919-A have been reattributed and \u2588\u2588 amnesticised individuals with previous knowledge of SCP-3919-A remain under surveillance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3919 is a memetic-semantic anomalous phenomenon related to Jan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (SCP-3919-A), a Czech modernist architect who lived from 1905 to 1973. While SCP-3919-A exhibited no known anomalous properties while alive, following his death an anomaly manifested in which eponymous objects, or items understood to be 'his' by multiple individuals, were converted into instances of SCP-3919-B. Instances of SCP-3919-B induce visual and auditory hallucinations in humans in their vicinity. The specifics vary between each instance but consistently reflect memorable scenes from SCP-3919-A's life. While these hallucinations are not inherently harmful, they loop continuously and prevent perception of reality at maximal intensity, making it significantly difficult for individuals to remove themselves from the area of effect.\n\n\nSCP-3919 was not observed until 1993, when Charles University in Prague renamed a lecture theatre in its architecture faculty the 'Jan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Theatre', converting it into an instance of SCP-3919-B. While this affected a number of persons and led to Foundation intervention, this was initially thought to be an isolated anomalous location. Combined with uncertainty about SCP-3919-B activation conditions, this allowed for the creation of further SCP-3919-B instances between 1993 and 1998 until current containment procedures were implemented.\n\n\nThe semantic component of SCP-3919 relies on common understanding. The most straightforward condition for activation of SCP-3919 and conversion of an object into an SCP-3919-B instance involves officially naming an object after SCP-3919-A and documenting this fact. This property is relatively straightforward to monitor and control. However, a significantly more dangerous activation of SCP-3919 occurs when references are made in informal usage with the understanding that they refer to SCP-3919-A and the acceptance of this between at least two persons (eg. SCP-3919-B-4). This property is not limited to buildings and has been confirmed to apply to other objects, beings and actions. Testing on abstract concepts is forbidden due to the risk of a CK-class reality restructuring scenario.\n\n\nA general knowledge of SCP-3919-A's identity (full name, nationality, occupation, and 20th-century existence has been found to be sufficient) is required for an individual to activate SCP-3919's anomalous properties. Beyond this, there are no known limits to the application of SCP-3919, if two individuals cooperate with one another, hence the importance of the information security procedures surrounding SCP-3919-A in the public sphere. Works by SCP-3919-A have been reattributed to other Czech architects and the academic literature altered accordingly.\n\n\nAmnesticisation of SCP-3919-A's personal contacts was previously standard practice but is no longer relevant as of 2014.\n\n\nAddendum 3919-1:\n Selected SCP-3919-B instances, with associated events transcribed and translated\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3919-B-1\n\n\nItem:\n The Jan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Theatre in the former School of Architecture building of Charles Universty in Prague\n\n\nBackground:\n See above.\n\n\nEvent Date:\n c. 1916\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3919-A, his mother Eva \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (PoI-39191) and father Rudolf \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (PoI-39192) are in the living room of their residence in Brno, SCP-3919-A's childhood home.

Of course it was worse for me in Germany, but you must still be worried. If you do not come here, there is plenty of work going on in our circle in America -\n\n\nSCP-3919-A:\n \n(in German)\n Thank you for the offer, Walter, but with Karol\u00edna's pregnancy, it is simply impossible for us to travel.

This was traced to a flaw in the automated system responsible for cataloguing SCP-3919 documentation, where a text string referring to the Head of SCP-3919 Research (then Dr Bal\u00e1\u017eov\u00e1) led to the replacement of SCP-3919 with 'Jan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' in a number of documents.
