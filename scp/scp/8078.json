Interviewers and researchers are strongly cautioned not to make use of jokes, sarcasm, or any potentially ambiguous statements in its presence. Any attempts by SCP-8078 to offer aid in any non-official capacity are to be politely refused.\n\n\nAll personnel are to be reminded that though SCP-8078 cannot easily detect lies, it is not incapable of lying in order to appease its masters, especially if it feels threatened or coerced. Personnel are therefore strongly discouraged from attempting to impose any subjective beliefs they may have concerning 8078's identity or behavior on it, as 8078 will readily agree with them if it feels pressured to do so.\n\n\nStaff members suspected of any inclination to use SCP-8078 for personal reasons or recreational purposes are to be shown video file MPT-101 as a first and final warning, with any actual offenders to be punished with reassignment or demotion, depending on the severity of the offence.\n\n\nDescription:\n In its default state, SCP-8078 is a 200-litre mass of viscous black fluid, similar to molten tar in consistency and striated with luminous metallic gold veins. SCP-8078 commonly shapes this matter into an abstract humanoid figure when it wishes to communicate.\n\n\nSCP-8078 is polymorphic in nature and can perfectly replicate human beings, animals, objects, and other liquids after sufficient observation. However, SCP-8078 reports that becoming smaller than five millimetres or taller than three metres in height is extremely painful, and testing has determined that it cannot mimic gasses or combustible substances.\n\n\nSCP-8078 is difficult to permanently damage, as its body reforms as soon as it is disrupted. Extreme heat temporarily disables its regenerative properties, making fire the most viable form of deterrence in the event of critical miscommunications.\n\n\nSCP-8078 is sapient, but intellectually limited. It has demonstrated a general intelligence roughly comparable to a child, most prominently in its inability to comprehend the notion of permanent harm or death, as it cannot understand why deceased test subjects have stopped moving and are never seen again after being removed from its presence. It also interprets any information it receives literally, and therefore cannot process sarcasm, humour, irony, satire, innuendo, or obvious lies, and can only recognize fiction with prior coaching.\n\n\nIn addition to its dysfunctional initiative, SCP-8078 also exhibits compulsive obedience: whenever provided with an order, it will obey without question. Combined with its literal-mindedness, this has resulted in numerous attempts to accommodate any desire voiced in its presence, no matter how vague.\n\n\nPsychological analysis suggests that SCP-8078 was subjected to extensive psychological conditioning during its earliest stages of development, indicating that its obedience is not an intrinsic trait, but was instead deliberately engineered in order to ensure it would remain cooperative with its previous keepers.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-8078 was first discovered on 01/10/2022 at Site 83, following a month-long period of unexplained thefts and gifts in the administrative offices, presumably its attempts to accommodate the conflicting desires of the staff.\n\n\nAs a result of its polymorphic traits, it was not revealed to Foundation staff until a frustrated secretary loudly demanded that whoever stole her stapler \u201cstand up and confess to it.\u201d Capture and containment followed immediately thereafter, which SCP-8078 made no attempt to resist.\n\n\nSCP-8078 claims to not remember anything prior to gaining full consciousness at Site 83. As no signs of gestation were found in the facility and no perimeter breaches were reported, it is currently unknown how SCP-8078 gained access to the facility, though it is theorized that it was either unwittingly brought to the Site by a staff member before it achieved consciousness or was created there in secret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8078\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Lina Raznakovic\n\n\nForeword:\n This was the first interview of SCP-8078 once it was properly contained. Though it had already been interrogated after capture, it was hoped that additional questioning could uncover any information it had not previously included, but SCP-8078's compulsive need to appease its keepers by any means (including lying) prompted an end to further interviews.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 01:00 PM, 01/02/23)>\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Good afternoon, 8078. How are you?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m fine, Dr Raznakovic. I\u2019ve been learning a lot today and making myself extra helpful. Security Officer Lin has been teaching me about clothes.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n (\npause\n) How so?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I used to think that people just had fur and scales like other animals, but then I saw Security Officer Lin take off his jacket this morning. I was \nso\n scared \u2013 I thought he\u2019d hurt himself! But he showed me he was okay, and it\u2019s not really fur or scales. So now I\u2019m learning how to make real clothing when I make myself into people. This is my scarf. Do you like it?\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Where did you copy that from?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I saw Research Assistant Pelion wearing it a little while ago.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Remind me to have a word with him about uniform regulations: he\u2019s not supposed to wear that in the lab.\n\n\nSCP-8078\n: You\u2019re to have a word with Research Assistant Pelion about unif-\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Not \nnow,\n 8078, later.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Sorry. Um, is there anything else I can do for you?\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n I have a few official questions for concerning your personal knowledge. First, what are you? How do you see yourself?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Well, I learned how to make a mirror from my arm last week, so I guess I can just loo-\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n (\nsighs\n) What do you think you are? What do you believe yourself to be compared to human beings?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m not sure, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m whatever anyone needs me to be, though.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Do you recall how you arrived in Site 83\u2018s offices?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n No. I think I woke up in one of the air vents, so I might have gotten in that way, but I don't remember anything before that.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n Very well, then. Onto the next question: do you know how you shapeshift?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Yes, Dr Raznakovic, like this. (\naudibly transforms, producing sounds of flowing water\n)\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n No, no, I mean\u2026 (\nunder breath\n) Who the hell wrote these? (\naloud\n) How does your shapeshifting ability actually work? do you understand how you spontaneously generate and subtract mass - if that's what you actually do? Or are you drawing it in from another dimension?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Don't you already know? You change every time you move, so you must be shapeshifting too.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n (\nconfused\n) \u20268078, I don't shapeshift.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Then how do you walk? Your legs don't stay exactly the same shape when they move, so they have to change so they can move. Isn't that how that works?\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n \u2026well, yes - technically. Muscles do have to change shape in order to move, but not in the same way that \nyou\n change.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Oh. Is there anything else you'd like to ask me?\n\n\nDr Raznakovic:\n (\naudibly leafing through papers\n) Nothing for now, thank you. I think it might be for the best if we postpone this interview while I edit these questions for clearer syntax\u2026\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Early\u00a0Disciplinary\u00a0Issues:\u00a015/02/23\u00a0-\u00a002/03/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report (15/02/23):\n During an interaction test with a D-Class, D-8809322 became argumentative and mockingly ordered SCP-8078 to \u201cshow us your tits.\u201d SCP-8078 appeared confused by this \u201crequest,\u201d but shaped itself into a flock of small birds from the Paridae family.\n1\n\n\nResearch Assistant Pelion, having asked D-8809322 to be quiet for several minutes to no avail, was heard to ask, \"is there anything that can shut you up for a minute?\" SCP-8078 answered in the affirmative, whereupon Research Assistant Pelion sarcastically encouraged it to show him how.\n\n\nSCP-8078 then sprouted a gland that launched an adhesive gel at D-8809322\u2019s face, leaving his lips effectively sealed shut until the gel dissolved exactly one minute later. D-8809322 was shaken but unharmed. Research Assistant Pelion was reprimanded for carelessness.\n\n\nMichael Pelion's Diary (15/02/23)\n2\n\n\n\n\nLosing composure too easily. Don't mean to say these things, but I do - still too soon after the containment breach to bottle it up.\n\n\nNeed to keep writing.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report (20/02/23):\n In a test of its ability to memorize new shapes, SCP-8078 was ordered to mimic a Foundation staff member who wasn\u2019t currently present at the Site and opted to become Research Assistant Pelion (on sick leave at the time). SCP-8078\u2019s mimicry, dated Friday of the previous week, was pale, unshaven, appeared to have been crying, smelled strongly of vomit, and walked unsteadily.\n\n\nMichael Pelion's Diary (20/02/23)\n\n\n\n\nSo stupid of me. Waited until midnight, picked a blind spot in the cell to self-medicate, didn't even notice that 8078 wasn't asleep yet. Now everyone's all over me like fucking shingles. Just like the day after my divorce, only worse.\n\n\nNeed to keep writing.\n3\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report (01/03/23):\n During a test of SCP-8078\u2019s polymorphic traits, Dr Raznakovic provided a loaded 9mm handgun and instructed 8078 to mimic its shape. 8078 obeyed, replicating the firearm so accurately that Dr Raznakovic was able to disassemble and reassemble it\n4\n\n\nFollowing the test, Pelion began discussing alternate methods of firearm testing they could try, concluding by jokingly suggesting \"The Cobain\"; he then mimed committing suicide by gunshot, unaware that SCP-8078 was still awaiting orders.\n\n\nSCP-8078 then attempted to assist with testing by reverting to its default humanoid form and shooting itself in the head with the sample handgun. SCP-8078 was left in considerable pain, and a large quantity of its biomass soiled the wall behind it, though no lasting harm was inflicted.\n\n\nResearch Assistant Pelion was reprimanded for carelessness. In light of recent behavioural incidents, the Site Psychiatrist recommended that Pelion undergo a full psychiatric evaluation and possibly be placed on unpaid leave. However, Dr Raznakovic cited the need to maintain a full staff complement for the following three to four weeks of experimentation, and this was reduced to mandatory counselling for the next month.\n\n\nMichael Pelion's Diary (01/03/23)\n\n\n\n\nI'm fine. I'm still writing in this diary, so I'm fine. I'm fine.\n\n\nI don't need any help. Even if I did, nobody cares enough to listen. This job isn't meant to be about me.\n\n\nJust need to get through the day, then I can go home and watch \nDogville.\n At least \nDogville\n has a happy ending.\n\n\nI'm fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 11:13 PM 02/03/23\n\n\nNOTE:\n While Research Assistant Pelion was checking the instrumentation in SCP-8078's cell just before leaving the building, Site 83 suffered a minor containment breach, resulting in SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 damaging the Site generator and causing site-wide power failure.\n5\n Consequently, CCTV cameras and audio receivers were disabled for the duration of the incident, though backup recording devices in SCP-8078\u2019s cell remained online. However, it was claimed that the backup audio file suffered data corruption during the incident, and it was not until 10/10/23 that an intact copy was uncovered.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nstatic\n) -for a minute? I\u2019m trying to concentrate o-\n\n\nLoud rumbling sound; comparative analysis confirms that lights across the site have gone offline.\n\n\nPelion:\n Jesus!\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Are you alright, Research Assistant Pelion?\n\n\nPelion:\n I\u2019m alright. I\u2026 I\u2019m okay. (\ncoughs\n) Just hold on a sec. (\npause\n) There we go, we\u2019ve got emergency lighting online at least. Door\u2019s still not opening, though. Not a good sign. We\u2019re sealed in, so that must mean the emergency overrides are in place, which means-\n\n\nMuffled explosions, followed by distant roars and screams.\n\n\nPelion:\n Oh God. Oh no, oh god, oh shit, it\u2019s happening again. Another breach.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Can I help?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ntaking very deep breaths\n) I really, really doubt that, 8078. I mean, unless you can force open a reinforced security door with your bare hands or claws or tentacles or whatever else you can manage.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019d be more than happy to try if you\u2019d like me to. (\npause\n) Are you sure you\u2019re alright, sir? If you need something to help you calm down, Dr Raznakovic says my vocal reproduction of the Goldberg Variations is almost perfect-\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nalmost screaming\n) I\u2019m fine! (\nquieter\n) I mean, I\u2019m fine, 8078. Besides, (\nlaughs mirthlessly\n) it\u2019s not as if you could do much to help while we\u2019re trapped in here.\n\n\nSounds of tearing metal and shattering glass can be heard outside.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ngasps for breath\n) Or if we\u2019re being honest, while \nI\u2019m\n trapped in here and everything anomalous in this site is roaming free.\n\n\nMuffled sounds of gunfire can be heard nearby.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nincreasing pace\n) But who cares? All we can do is clean up the mess when it\u2019s over, and then go right back to keeping our little collections locked away and not doing anything with them except waiting for them to break out and kill us again! (\nvoice cracking\n) Yeah, that sounds totally reasonable!\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Sir?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nthrough gritted teeth\n) Just leave me alone.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n \u2026I\u2019m sorry, sir, the door hasn\u2019t opened yet and there\u2019s nowhere else I can go. If you like, I can make myself as small as I can, and you can pretend that I\u2019m not here. (\npause\n) Is there anything else I can do for you?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nalmost hyperventilating\n) 8078, please, \nstop helping\n.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nhysterically laughing, possibly crying\n) Yeah, because it\u2019s never \nyour\n fault, is it? It-it-it\u2019s never you who has to pay the price when someone gets hurt: you get nice cozy cells with all the free food and entertainment you can ask for, and you get doe-eyed idiots like us to fawn over you and die in agony the moment you get bored with us, and \nnothing ever changes!\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Sir, I\u2019m not sure I understand what-\n\n\nPelion:\n This is my second containment breach this year! Do you know what those \nthings\n did last time? Do you know how many of my friends died?! And Christ, it\u2019s never going to fucking change! All the items, all the creatures, all the things \u2013 we\u2019re never gonna get anything out of them! We\u2019re not their jailers, we\u2019re slaves to them \u2013 to \nyou!\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nPelion:\n Well?! Say something! You were full of questions a minute ago, so say something! Say something! FUCKING \u2013 SAY \u2013 SOMETHING!\n\n\nSounds of Pelion repeatedly striking SCP-8078, followed by the sounds of liquid splashing across the cell floor.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ngasping for breath\n) Oh God\u2026 oh \nshit\n. God damn it\u2026 I-I shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n (\ngroans in pain as it reforms\n) Is\u2026 is there anything else I can do for you? (\npause\n) Do you want to hit me again, sir?\n\n\nTwenty-second pause.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nastonished\n) I\u2026 I can hit you again if I want to?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Of course, sir.\n\n\nPelion:\n You mean I have your consent \u2013 your full, knowing consent?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Whatever you want, sir.\n\n\nPelion takes a deep breath, then continues attacking. Over the course of this assault, Pelion can be heard emitting harsh, gasping vocalizations; it is not clear if he is laughing or sobbing. Thirty seconds later, the beating stops.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\npanting\n) I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I'm sorry. I\u2026 I wasn't genuinely trying to hurt you, okay? I just\u2026 I just needed to vent for a minute. You understand, right?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n (\npained\n) Yes, sir.\n\n\nPelion:\n Good, good. I\u2026 I didn't mean anything by what I said, either. I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone, not really. I was just upset. I was just\u2026 just\u2026\n\n\nA faint humming can be heard, indicating that main power is being restored.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nspeaking quickly\n) 8078, listen carefully. What we did tonight - it was just a game. If anyone asks what happened, \nit was all just a game.\n Got it?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Of course, sir.\n\n\nFifteen seconds later, main power is restored, deactivating the emergency surveillance backup.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's Diary (02/03/23)\n\n\n\n\nLost it again.\n\n\nFeeling guilty, but not for breaking the rules. Something about 8078\u2019s eagerness to please makes me want to set things right somehow\u2026 but there\u2019s also something about it that makes me think of new possibilities.\n\n\nWhat if all this time, I\u2019ve had the greatest prize in the Foundation\u2019s history under my nose and never noticed until today?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Pelion-Raznakovic\u00a0Agreement:\u00a002/03/23-08/03/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 5:00 PM, 02/03/23\n\n\nNOTE:\n The following recording was one of a series of files found in Research Assistant Pelion's safe. Based on the content of the interview, it can be inferred that Pelion knew that his assault had been discovered and was trying to blackmail Dr Raznakovic via a recording device concealed in his clothes.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n There had better be a good explanation for what happened last night.\n\n\nPelion:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Allow me to rephrase that: give me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t forward the backup audio from SCP-8078\u2019s cell to the Site Director.\n\n\nFive-second pause\n.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Well?\n\n\nPelion:\n If you\u2019ve actually heard the recording, you\u2019d know I was under a lot of stress that night \u2013 and there was a containment breach going on outside, in case you forgot.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n In case \nyou\n forgot, we\u2019re supposed to be researching these things, not using them as pinatas! Besides, you weren't in any immediate danger, so-\n\n\nPelion:\n For Christ\u2019s sake, I didn\u2019t know if I was going to live through the night! I was just barely hanging on to my sanity \u2013 and yeah, it was a bit Two Minute\u2019s Hate, but it was literally all I had to keep me from losing my mind.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Not remotely an excuse, Michael. You know what \nI\n do to maintain sanity when I'm not in immediate danger? I meditate. I listen to Bach. I write in my diary.\n\n\nPelion:\n Oh, so you went to the same therapist as me?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n This is \nnot\n the time to get cute, Michael. Why shouldn\u2019t this recording go straight to the Disciplinary Committee?\n\n\nPelion:\n Because I\u2019ve seen your notes \u2013 long enough to take photos, at any rate. If you send the recording to them, I\u2019ll send them proof of your experiments.\n\n\nFifteen-second pause.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n How long have you known?\n\n\nPelion:\n Ever since I saw you swabbing down the wall after 8078's Cobain incident. You were collecting samples for cell replication testing, am I right? You\u2019re running your own off-the-books experiments on 8078, and something tells me the O5s wouldn\u2019t approve.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n For baseline cellular tests under strict lab controls? I\u2019m just advancing our timetable by a few months, dodging an arbitrary waiting period; at worst, I\u2019d get away with a slap on the wrist. \nYou\u2019d\n be fired for what you\u2019ve done.\n\n\nPelion:\n That \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d could do a lot of damage to your career, Lina. Oh, and while we\u2019re on the subject, why didn\u2019t you go straight to the committee if you\u2019re such a stickler for the rules?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Because I thought you deserved a chance to prove to me that I hadn\u2019t made a mistake by sticking my neck out for you! I was listening when you said you couldn\u2019t afford the unpaid leave. But apparently, that wasn\u2019t enough for you, was it?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nhesitant\n) Look\u2026 maybe this doesn\u2019t have to be unpleasant. Maybe we could help each other out, get something good out of this.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Explain.\n\n\nPelion:\n You were conducting a few tests ahead of schedule, and I was\u2026 well, you know. But what if we\u2019ve been settling for less? What if we could aim higher? We\u2019ve got a test subject that follows all orders, won\u2019t get violent unless we say so, and will lie for us without even knowing it\u2019s lying. So why should we let arbitrary regulations hold us back? Why aren\u2019t we learning to put 8078 to good use?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n And what makes you think I\u2019d be interested in that?\n\n\nPelion:\n Because that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re conducting these secret tests. I\u2019ve seen your research proposal: you want to see if 8078 can be used in Foundation security, but the pen-pushers are holding up the combat testing with paperwork and waiting periods, am I right?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n It\u2019s standard procedure, Michael, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. They aren\u2019t going to take unnecessary risks wi-\n\n\nPelion:\n And that\u2019s the problem! 8078 isn\u2019t a threat to anyone unless we give the order, and we\u2019re still being tied up in red tape. This could be the biggest win we\u2019ve seen in decades, but the bean-counters aren\u2019t going to let it work without years and years of bureaucratic horseshit! What if you could cut that short?\n\n\nFive-second pause.\n\n\nPelion:\n Think about it. All we need is a good excuse for keeping the security cameras off, some test subjects who won\u2019t spill our secrets, and we\u2019re all set for our own experiments. This way, we\u2019ll know for sure if SCP-8078 can be put to good use, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, nobody else needs to know.\n\n\nRaznakovic\n And if it \ndoes\n work out, how are we supposed to prove it without revealing that we\u2019ve broken the rules?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ntakes a deep breath\n) We trigger a containment breach.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n We \nwhat?!\n\n\nPelion:\n Hear me out! We trigger a breach \u2013 a minor one, or maybe some rioting D-class personnel \u2013 and then we send 8078 in to save the day. We won\u2019t need documented proof of our experiments: it\u2019ll prove itself in the field, and we\u2019ll both end up looking like heroes. You might even earn the pay rise you\u2019ve been angling for.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Even if your offer is genuine \u2013 that\u2019s not an admission of interest \u2013 I don\u2019t trust your motives.\n\n\nPelion:\n Why not?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Because you haven\u2019t told me what those motives are. More importantly, you still haven't explained how you\u2019ve pivoted from beating 8078 senseless to putting it to use for the good of the Foundation.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n This wasn\u2019t a spur-of-the-moment idea, was it? You\u2019ve been planning this for a while.\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026That night in 8078\u2019s cell was the point where the penny twigged, but I think I\u2019ve been building up to it for most of my career.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n And why is that?\n\n\nPelion:\n Because I\u2019ve never once felt like I was changing anything for the better. We\u2019re supposed to be preserving humanity, learning how the monsters tick, making the world a better place\u2026 but we \nalways\n settle for less. The research almost never pays off, the world is always fucked, and by now we\u2019re all resigned to suffering, so we carry on locking things away in the hope they don\u2019t break out and kill us all.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Hardly an objective point of view. We have a great many nonlethal items and entities in storage, Michael; we even \nemploy\n a few of them.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nscoffs\n) Sure, every once in a blue moon, we get something halfway useful that doesn\u2019t end up turning on us, but even then, it barely seems to make a difference \u2013 usually because of some arbitrary ruling on ethical treatment, as if \ntheir\n rights outweighed ours. We\u2019re not heroes: we\u2019re the fucking bellboys of a glorified hotel service for monsters. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time we made one of these things work for us instead of the other way round?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n You\u2019re an idealist, then? Tell me you\u2019ve at least written a manifesto.\n\n\nPelion:\n You can be as sarcastic as you want, but I know for a fact that you want this as much as I do, doc, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have bothered with those tests in the first place. (\nsigh\n) And I don\u2019t know what I am anymore. I just want to know that it\u2019s \npossible.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n It\u2019s\u2026 not impossible. We have several delusional schizophrenics among the D-class population who won\u2019t be believed if they talk, and I can think of a few official excuses for disabling the cameras.\n\n\nPelion:\n You\u2019re in, then?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n In the sense that I recognize 8078\u2019s potential for unimpeded research? Yes. I\u2019m in. But it\u2019ll have to be done carefully, discreetly, and above all else, \nprofessionally\n: no more thoughtless remarks, no more using 8078 as a punching bag.\n\n\nPelion:\n You have my word: I\u2019ll be completely professional with 8078 from now on. Give it enough time, and we\u2019ll be the best of friends. (\ncoughs uncomfortably\n) Um, speaking of which\u2026 what are you going to do with the recording?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n I think I\u2019ll hang on to it.

The fact that these ones are mentally ill doesn\u2019t change a thing: they had a chance to seek treatment before they turned criminal, and they blew it. Then again, it\u2019s not as if we have to \nkill\n them.\n\n\nOne really makes me want to vomit \u2013 D-99942. Her bio says it all: she thought her baby was a demon, drowned him in the tub, wasn\u2019t even caught until she tried to have a priest consecrate the bathwater.

At least in here, she\u2019s making the world a better place.\n\n\nAllowed 8078 to have some fun with her in all the forms I could suggest - even let it fall on her as a bookshelf. Pretty sure it was grateful for the exercise.

Once he was satisfied that we wouldn't be able to get our hands on Amnestics without it ending up on record, he gave the go-ahead. The idiot was \nshockingly\n casual about it, didn't even seem to care that this was all his fault.\n\n\nI'd ask why this guy wasn't fired after his last psych eval, but then, I was the idiot that helped him dodge the evaluation.

She\u2019d cry sometimes when she looked at it, so I tried to cheer her up by becoming him for a while: she liked that.\n\n\nIn the background, Pelion takes several deep breaths; the bottle can be heard rattling against the glasses as Pelion pours, suggesting that his hands are shaking.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n She\u2019d hold me in her arms while you were away from the control booth, call me \u201cLiam,\u201d and tell me how sorry she was.

I know, I know, that was thoughtless of me. I should have known you might have a bad reaction to your first proper drink. But, well\u2026 I\u2019m not as bad as I used to be, but I\u2019m still trying to be a better person, and I don\u2019t always get it right. So, I\u2019m sorry.

The good news is that Our Friend\n8\n has made it very easy to request emergency budgets.\n\n\nBuying the necessary software for the exit will be pricey and require a bit of creative bookkeeping, but I can guarantee that there will be interested parties - one good thing I learned from the CIA. I just need to find one that won't kill me as soon as the sale is complete.\n\n\nMeanwhile, MP is somehow even less helpful than usual: he refuses to assist with cleanup, instead just listening to that terrible Georgia Gibbs song \"Kiss Of Fire\" on his phone.\n\n\nHow is it that I've ended up as research partner to a man with his head jammed so far up his ass he could probably lick the underside of his own brain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Fraternization\u00a0Data:\u00a002/05/23-31/08/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (12/05/23)\n\n\n\n\nNoticed the strangest thing this evening: Sam talks in \nits\n her sleep.\n\n\nWhen she's dormant in her bath, she keeps muttering words and sentences, most of them pretty nonsensical: \"the search,\" \"in his father's footsteps,\" \"the begotten,\" \"the house on hope street,\" \"what we leave behind,\" etc\u2026\n\n\nHowever, one thing made sense - a name: \u201cAristaios.\u201d\n\n\nI know him: a researcher from Site 44, disagreeable snob - what the folks there like to call \"Oxbridge.\" I remember he once got into an argument with Archives about accessing materials on Memetic control, wanted to apply them to Pavlovian techniques. Scuttlebutt is that his research was being conducted under O5 supervision, so had to be something pretty impressive.\n\n\nHe was badly injured in cargo plane crash about seven months ago, left comatose. Still recovering in physical therapy, last I heard.\n\n\nFunny thing: all the stuff from his plane went straight to our Site. Can't be a coincidence.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary 16/06/23\n\n\n\n\nGetting the impression that Sam feels something for me.\n\n\nBeen calling her a friend for a while now, but it\u2019s only now I've realize I\u2019ve been feeling the same way for her. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone I can be so open with or anyone who trusts me so completely.\n\n\nI'm not like the others: she doesn\u2019t obey because she\u2019s compelled to. With me, she obeys because she likes me \u2013 because she knows that I feel the same way about her.\n\n\nNever thought I\u2019d write this, but I\u2019m a better person around her: self-medication, rage, anxiety, despair \u2013 it's all smothered into silence when I'm with her. Like draping a blanket over a birdcage.\n\n\nWith about two hours left after every experiment and Raznakovic not interested in sticking around, I'm regularly sharing the time with Sam, just to make a change from the usual entertainment she usually has to put up with. She seems to like listening to me read aloud, especially \nTrilby\n and \nLa Philosophie Dans Le Boudoir\n.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking I should find a way to watch some movies together. After all, she\u2019s helped me; it\u2019s time I helped her. After all, what are friends for?\n\n\n\n\nLina Raznakovic's diary (31/06/23)\n\n\n\n\nMP is acting very oddly - more than usual.\n\n\nHe arranged a movie night for himself in Our Friend's room this evening, even shared a bucket of popcorn with them\n9\n. Because my hidden camera was angled away from the screen, I couldn't tell what they were watching, but judging by the sound effects, it was one of the animated kids' films that we've been using to teach Our Friend about fiction.\n\n\nMP would not shut up: he kept asking if Our Friend used to be like the main character, if they could give themselves pink hair and fangs, even if they would save the day by turning into \"a pink cereal-mascot dragon,\" whatever the hell that means.\n\n\nThen he started rambling on about the Lars Von Trier films he likes, about his ex-wife's collection of Pixar DVDs, about the importance of unlocking Our Friend's true potential \"like any good friend would\". I'm not even sure if he's calling Our Friend by name anymore, though I couldn't hear precisely over the TV noise.\n\n\nThen he touched them - actually put his bare arms around Our Friend, even after all the warnings over potential biohazards. Our Friend clearly didn't know what to make of it, and seemed a little unsettled, though MP kept saying that it was \"just something friends do.\"\n\n\nAnd as if that wasn't strange enough, he also asked Our Friend if they would be willing to model itself on something they saw in \"a different kind of movie.\" And he seemed \nvery\n excited when they said yes.\n\n\nExit strategy planning is well underway, and just as well, because with the way MP's been acting, I'm not sure how much longer we can maintain secrecy. Thankfully, the Dark Web continues to offer dividends\u2026 along with one extremely insistent potential buyer: Tegid Foel.\n\n\nOdd alias, but at least the owner seems marginally less tightfisted than MC&D.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (09/07/23):\n\n\n\n\nNow certain it\u2019s more than just friendship between us. This kind of closeness isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can fake.\n\n\nI think Sam might be falling in love with me.\n\n\nCrazy as it sounds, I'm already in love with Sam. Don\u2019t know what else could have made me hug her the way I did that night, or why I took her dancing an hour later.\n\n\nYes, dancing. Actual dancing, with music playing and everything. Sam knows my rhythms so well, like we\u2019ve been together for years. Waltz, tango, polka, she can follow on without missing a single step. How could this be possible if there wasn\u2019t a connection between us?\n\n\nKnow I should be focussing on next experiments, but can only think what happens afterwards: the movies, the dancing, the shared drinks, even some of the nicer meals I can sneak in. All I can think of is\u2026\n\n\nGuess there\u2019s no better word for it than romance.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (31/08/23):\n\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t felt close to anyone in the last two years: no nights out at the movies, no candlelit dinners, no dancing, no anniversaries.\n\n\nNow that I\u2019ve finally found someone that I can be almost normal around, it\u2019s a shapeshifting blob of oil and gold. And yet, she means more to me than any ordinary human being, because she can \nbe\n any human being and yet so much more.\n\n\nLast few nights, I\u2019ve been sneaking an air mattress into the cell so I can catch up on some sleep. Not sure how that evolved into letting Sam sleep next to me (in one of her human forms), but somehow it did. Last night, I held her in my arms, just to see if she was truly comfortable around me; not only did she let it happen, but she hugged me back.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m certain we\u2019re meant to be together. Whatever conditioning Dr Aristaios forced on her, it doesn't apply to us: she doesn't listen to me because of the brainwashing - she listens to me because she loves me.\n\n\nI need to tell her how I feel.

We\u2019d known each other since college, and I thought we had something together\u2026 and I was so proud of getting that offer of recruitment, I thought I'd celebrate by proposing on the same day I joined the Foundation.

Three years at the Foundation was enough to kill the marriage. After the divorce, I couldn\u2019t stand to try again; I mean, how could I put my trust in anyone after the Foundation showed me just how rotten everything really was?

In the end, decided that I liked Sam best in the first form I taught her: I'm a better person now, don't need to be with anyone else but her.

He claims to be in love, even insists that \"she\" loves him back independently, and clearly doesn't realize that this is impossible.\n\n\nI did a little digging, and according to personnel records, \"Samantha\" was the name of MP's ex-wife, another sign this project was doomed from the start: he's always had too many personal issues tangled up in what should have been purely objective.\n\n\nI warned him about maintaining emotional distance, but all he said was \"so you\u2019d like me to go back to treating Sam like a punching bag, is that it?\" I tried to discuss the physical hazards, but he just said, \"I\u2019ve found true love, and all you can think is how unprofessional it is.\" And when I told him that Our Friend didn't really love him, he called me a soulless cunt and stormed off.\n\n\nThis can only end in tears.\n\n\nThank God the exit strategy is well underway: I've already received several generous responses, but I've still got to consider my own safety and the risk of getting caught. So far, only one buyer - Tegid Foel - seems to cover both issues, and conveniently enough, this one seems to understand my offer the best. Whoever they are, they are very anxious to meet Our Friend\u2026 and might be the best placed to pay top dollar for it.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (08/09/23)\n\n\n\n\nRaznakovic disapproves of everything, glacial streak of joyless puritanical piss that she is. No big surprise there, but it's not like she can stop me, not with the dirt I've got on her.\n\n\nOne worrying thing: I keep getting the feeling that someone's watching me when I'm alone with Sam\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDr Raznakovic's diary (017/09/23)\n\n\n\n\nMP's been cooing over Our Friend more aggressively than usual, insisting on plenty of peace and quiet so they can \"recover from all the stress.\" Apparently, they've been suffering from disturbed sleep, even nightmares, and MP seems to think it's because we've been working them too hard.\n\n\nHe's wrong. Our Friend \nis\n suffering from disturbed sleep, but it's almost certainly due to MP himself, judging by the \nsounds\n that Our Friend has been making in their sleep: verbatim mimicries of everything MP has said during coitus.\n\n\nEven worse are the sounds afterwards, performed in Our Friend's default voice: they're \ncrying\n.\n\n\nMP still doesn't realize what he's doing. He's not a psychopath - psychopaths can and will remain uncaring. A psychopath wouldn't be so attentive to 8078's feelings. He still has a semblance of empathy.\n\n\nSo how can he not know what he's doing to them?\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (25/09/23)\n\n\n\n\nNow convinced someone's watching me. Need to find out who and why. Sam's too precious to be at risk; project's too close to completion to be risked\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDr Raznakovic's diary (028/09/23)\n\n\n\n\nGoddamn MP and his endless talk of being watched is getting on my last nerve. Worse still, his paranoia is starting to rub off on me. While I was taking out the trash last night, I could have sworn someone was watching me out there in the darkness, but when I went to look beyond my fence, all I found was an owl in a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Staff\u00a0Assault\u00a0Incident:\u00a029/09/23-04/10/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (30/09/23)\n\n\n\n\nFinally caught the motherfucker spying on us: janitor, supposedly. Snooping perve was watching me and Sam together when we noticed him.\n\n\nKnew we couldn\u2019t let him leave. Don\u2019t know if he was just nosy or working for O5s, but couldn\u2019t have him blabbing, not when we\u2019re so close to finishing the project.\n\n\nSo\u2026 Sam and I played a new game.\n\n\nHad to leave soon after: cameras were about to switch back on, couldn\u2019t afford to get caught in the same room. Sam was really upset about the whole thing, as all I could do was coach her through a half-assed excuse before getting the hell out of there \u2013 will have to make it up to her soon.\n\n\nAt least I\u2019ve got an alibi for the night. Think I\u2019m coming down with a cold, so I can just pretend to be too sick to have stayed for long after the experiment ended.\n\n\n\n\nIncident report (30/09/23):\n At 3:00 AM, reactivated security cameras detected human remains in SCP-8078\u2019s cell; close examination found that the victim had been constricted and crushed beyond recognition.\n\n\nAn ID card and fingerprint analysis confirmed that the victim was Edward Stevenson, one of the janitorial staff. SCP-8078 claimed to have no memory of what Stevenson was doing in the cell or how he died, through traces of SCP-8078\u2019s biological matter on the body confirmed that it was responsible.\n\n\nIn light of this unprovoked attack on a member of Foundation staff, all experimentation relating to SCP-8078 has been postponed until more effective safety precautions can be utilized.\n\n\nDr Raznakovic's diary (30/10/23)\n\n\n\n\nidiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot!!!\n\n\nOkay.

Dr Raznakovic? What\u2019s going on?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ncoughing heavily\n) Nothing\u2019s wrong, Sam, just another game. You go back to your tub now, sweetie: you don\u2019t need to hear what we say next. (\nquieter\n) Okay, what was that for?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n You know damn well! You\u2019ve fucked us! You\u2019ve fucked \nme!\n\n\nPelion:\n Wha- Me? What did \nI\n do?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Did murdering a janitor slip your mind?\n\n\nPelion:\n I had to! If I\u2019d let him get away, he\u2019d have told everyone about me and Sam! I was just taking the same precautions as you!\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Not remotely the same thing, Michael! Putting aside the fact that dead janitors raise way more questions than dead D-classes, none of this would have happened if you\u2019d kept your dick in your pants.\n\n\nPelion:\n I could really do without the smartass commentary, Lina.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Commentaries are all we\u2019ve got left! Experiments are cancelled until security's been upgraded, and once the new measures are in place, we won\u2019t be able to access 8078 after hours without tripping at least a dozen silent alarms, so we can pretty much kiss your big plan goodbye. Congratulations.\n\n\nPelion:\n But- (\ncough\n)\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n And I guarantee you that it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before we\u2019re reassigned for failure.\n\n\nPelion:\n You\u2019re joking.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Does it \nsound\n like I\u2019m joking? We\u2019ve already got a new research assistant being transferred over from Essex, some simpering bimbo with \u201cprevious experience working with polymorphic entities.\u201d Rumour has it she once spent five hours sobbing in a bathroom over some neutralized SCP, so she\u2019s probably too sweet for the Foundation, but she\u2019s almost certainly your replacement.\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026seriously? That\u2019s who they want in my place?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n I know. Says a lot about your work ethic, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n\nPelion:\n Fuck you.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Oh, relax. \nMy\n replacement will be along soon enough\u2026 and without us around to keep it in line, 8078\u2019s loyalties will shift to the new staff, they\u2019ll start asking questions, and before you know it, all our secrets will be out in the open. We\u2019ll be lucky if we don't end up being demoted to D-class.\n\n\nPause\n\n\nPelion:\n What do we do?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Cut our losses and run. It\u2019s the only option left to us\u2026 and as luck would have it, I\u2019ve been exploring that possibility for a while.\n\n\nPelion:\n Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold your horses. First of all, where the hell are we supposed to run to? Second of all, what possibility?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Defecting, preferably with 8078 as collateral.\n\n\nPelion:\n What?!\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n You know as well as I do that there are a lot of GOIs who\u2019d be willing to pay very generously for 8078, maybe enough to give us somewhere safe to retire to. I\u2019ve already put out feelers to certain\u2026 interested parties, and initial offerings have been very positive.\n\n\nPelion:\n You did \nwhat?!\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Hey, I had to put those emergency funds to some use; I wasn\u2019t spending it all on myself. Buying the necessary communications upgrade wasn\u2019t cheap, but it was worth every penny.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ncoughs\n) Wha\u2013 You\u2019re betraying the Foundation-\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Oh fuck off, Michael, we\u2019ve been betraying the Foundation for months on end.\n\n\nPelion:\n No! That\u2019s not the same thing \u2013 everything we did was to \nhelp\n the Foundation-\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n You still believe that, even after everything you\u2019ve done? You still think this was for anything other than your hormones and neuroses? Christ. At least I had a practical goal in mind.\n\n\nPelion:\n What, fleecing the Foundation out of as much money as you could steal, then running like a coward?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Unimpeded research, you moron. While you were busy with your fantasies, I was busy with actual science: your big plan never would have worked, but I thought we could at least get some precious experimentation out of it, enough to give our careers a boost when the time came. But you couldn\u2019t keep it together, could you? You just had to use 8078 as a salve for your personal issues!\n\n\nPelion:\n Oh really? And what about the fucking embezzlement? (\ncoughs\n) Where did \nthat\n tie into your plan for unimpeded research?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n I didn\u2019t start that until \nyou\n started undermining our secrecy! After that first dead D-class, I knew you\u2019d fuck this whole thing up sooner or later, so I took precautions and set myself up for a consolation prize. Well, it paid off.\n\n\nPelion:\n For you, maybe.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n For both of us. You\u2019ve ruined your own plan and you\u2019re on the verge of drowning my career in your own festering shit, but at least we can walk away with enough money to start new lives well out of the Foundation\u2019s reach\u2026 preferably as far away from each other as possible.\n\n\nPelion:\n So, who\u2019ve you sold the Foundation\u2019s future to? Marshal, Carter, & Dark? Are We Cool Yet? The fucking Chaos Insurgency?\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n No-one you know.\n\n\nFootsteps recede towards the door.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n The deal will be going ahead on the 10th. Be in my office by 5 PM, or I\u2019ll leave you here to face the music.\n\n\nPause; footsteps stop.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n Oh, and one more thing: if you think of using your blackmail material to stop me-\n\n\nPelion:\n I know, I know, you\u2019ll release your own blackmail material.\n\n\nRaznakovic:\n No, Michael. I will use every last drop of influence I have left to make sure you wake up in the cell of the Foundation's most famous shapeshifter \u2013 naked, with your feet superglued to the floor and your cock dipped in wasabi sauce. Do I make myself clear?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ncoughs\n) \u2026yes.\n\n\nRaznaovic:\n Good. See you on the 10th. And would you kindly wipe your nose? You\u2019ve done enough damage already without spreading the 'flu to everyone in the building.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (02/10/23)\n\n\n\n\nAll gone to shit. Plan dead in the water, Raznakovic\u2019s a liar and thief, and I\u2019m still sick. Sweating, dizzy, coughing, runny nose, too tired to be conscious but too conscious to sleep. Massive bruise on my stomach doesn't help - goddamn Raznakovic and her knuckleduster.\n\n\nSpent a couple of days agonizing. Must have worked my way through my entire music collection. But eventually \"Tonight You Belong To Me\" came to the rescue and I realized there might be another way: maybe Raznakovic\u2019s client could put Sam to better use than Foundation ever could.\n\n\nEven if they won\u2019t, maybe I can convince the new owner to let me stay on as Sam\u2019s keeper. Bit of a stretch, probably trying too hard to justify what I\u2019m going to do but have to look for any positive I can.\n\n\nGuess I\u2019ll have to play along with the ice-queen\u2019s plan, then\u2026 and hope that this bout of the \u2018flu\u2019s over by the time the 10th rolls around.\n\n\n\n\nDr Raznakovic's diary (04/10/23)\n\n\n\n\nMP left his diary in the cell today, where \nanyone\n could have seen it.\n\n\nTurns out he's been doing therapeutic writing of his own. Guess he wasn't joking when he suggested that we'd seen the same therapist - Dr Zachary has a lot to answer for.\n\n\nTrouble is, the idiot's diary isn't coded or written on something easy to destroy, so he's risking a security breach whenever he takes the diary home, \nand\n he's basically confessed to every illegal activity he's been involved with for the last few months!\n\n\nI was angry enough, even \nbefore\n I saw the latest entry. If MP thinks I'll let him endanger this deal by begging for a job, he's either drunk or an even bigger idiot than expected.\n\n\nEither way, this is the final straw. I'm done with him - done with his attitude, delusions, the shitty 1950s love songs he listens to, done, done, \nfucking done\n. He can go back to roofying widows at funerals or whatever the loathsome little shit used to do in his spare time, and he'd best enjoy it, because I'm not bailing him out anymore.\n\n\nSo, with permission from Tegid Foel, the meeting's been moved to the 9th. Our Friend has been briefed, though of course they don't yet realize that MP has been given the wrong date. Once the gifts have been exchanged, I'll email my edited footage to security; that should keep them too busy to notice I've left the country.\n\n\nHopefully, they'll give MP a memorable retirement; frankly, death by shapeshifting fox would be too good for the syphilitic little bastard.\n\n\nStrange thing, though: once the briefing was over, Our Friend asked me if I could tell it how to disobey.\n\n\nThey told me that they weren't comfortable with the \"games\" that they've been ordered to play, or with the way \"Mike\" touches them. Apparently, they don't know how to disobey him, and all but begged me to teach them how to say \"no.\"\n\n\nI had to tell them to just suck it up and behave themselves. Harsh of me, but that can't be helped right now: the last thing I need is for Our Friend to get cold feet before I get my money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Security\u00a0Action:\u00a007/10/23-11/10/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-8078\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Research Assistant Amanda Teo\n\n\n<Begin Log, 07/10/23, 9:00 AM>\n\n\nResearch Assistant Teo:\n Good morning, 8078. I\u2019m Amanda Teo; I\u2019ll be looking after you while Research Assistant Pelion\u2019s on sick leave.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I thought we would meet on the 11th.\n\n\nTeo:\n Slight change in schedule: I thought I was going to be picking up a friend today, but it turns out he\u2019s not well enough to leave rehab yet, so my timetable\u2019s free. Sorry about the change in routine.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n That\u2019s quite alright, Research Assistant Teo. I\u2019m very happy to meet whenever works best for you.\n\n\nTeo:\n Good. Anyway, let\u2019s get down to more serious matters concerning your behaviour and security. Do you have any questions before we begin?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Only one. If you\u2019ve spoken to Dr Raznakovic, do you know if everything\u2019s prepared for the 9th day of this month?\n\n\nTeo:\n \u2026um\u2026 no. (\nnervous\n) I didn\u2019t know anything was supposed to be prepared for the 9th at all. (\nsounds of papers being leafed through\n) Dammit. Must have missed a memo. At the risk of sounding really, really stupid, would you mind explaining what\u2019s supposed to be happening on the 9th?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Dr Raznakovic will be taking me away on the 9th.\n\n\nTeo:\n \u2026What do you mean by \u201ctaking you away?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n She wants me to become a briefcase and remain quiet while she carries me out to her car. She\u2019s taking me to meet some new friends, about twenty-five kilometers from here; after an exchange of gifts, they\u2019re going to take me to a new home.\n\n\n(\npause\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n I\u2019m sorry, what.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n She also says she\u2019s going to leave an ordinary briefcase in this room, but I don\u2019t understand why.\n\n\nTeo:\n Dr Raznakovic told you all of this? She actually said this out loud?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Yes. She didn\u2019t say it was a game, so it\u2019s not meant to be Our Little Secret, and she told me to take this seriously, and since she told me that I was permitted to discuss serious matters with members of the research team-\n\n\nTeo:\n -you felt it was safe to discuss it with me. (\nto the security guard on duty\n) You heard what it said, right? I didn\u2019t just imagine that, did I?\n\n\nGuard Morton:\n I heard it too, yeah.\n\n\nTeo:\n Okay then, I think you might want to give the security chief a call. (\nclears throat\n) 8078, is there anything else that you haven\u2019t been able to understand recently?\n\n\n(\nin the background, Morton can be heard calling security\n)\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n (\nuneasy\n) \u2026Some of the games that Mike plays with me have been\u2026 have felt wrong. I\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say this, but-\n\n\nTeo:\n Please, anything you know could be helpful. Just telling me what these games are would be enough.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Bedroom games.\n\n\n(\npause\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Every night, at around 1 or 2 AM, after the experiments are over and Dr Raznakovic's left, Mike takes off all his clothes and plays bedroom games with me.\n\n\nTeo:\n \u2026he does \nWHAT?!\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\n\n\nTeo:\n No, I\u2019m not angry with you, I\u2026 just to be clear, Mike \u2013 that\u2019s Research Assistant Michael Pelion, right? \u2013 he's been having sex with you every day of the week?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n \u2026I don\u2019t know what sex is, Research Assistant Teo.\n\n\nTeo:\n Jesus. Erm, what does Dr Raznakovic think about all this?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n (\nin Raznakovic's voice\n) \"8078, if you can\u2019t find a way to say no of your own accord, then maybe you were never meant to, and wasting my time isn\u2019t going to make a lick of difference to either of us.\"\n\n\nTeo:\n Holy \nfuck.\n\n\nMorton:\n Mandy, the security chief just notified the Site Director. You\u2019ve been scheduled for an emergency call.\n\n\nTeo:\n What? (\nphone rings\n) Ah shit. (\ninto phone\n) Good morning, Director. Uh, thank you for responding, but I didn\u2019t suspect this was serious enough to justify your involvement. (\npause\n) For what it\u2019s worth, yes, I believe it. (\npause\n) Well, there\u2019s also the fact that a research assistant has been having sex with SCP-8078. (\npause\n) What? (\npause\n) Meaning no offence, \nwhat\n ongoing investigation, and by who? Why do we need a conference call? Who else is there to talk to about thi- \noh my god\u2026\n\n\n(\npause\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n 8078\u2026 there are some people on the phone who\u2019d like to speak to you. Don\u2019t be scared. Just tell them exactly what you told me and answer any questions they might have. I\u2019m just going to put them on speakerphone\u2026\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n You may begin, 8078.\n\n\n(\nthe following twenty minutes have been redacted for the sake of brevity and security\n)\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n Very good, 8078. Please cease listening for a moment: we wish to speak to Ms Teo concerning confidential matters.\n\n\nTeo:\n Me? Um, no disrespect intended, but what do you need me for, sir?\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n Misdirection. The suspects were already being investigated under suspicion of multiple counts of murder and illegal experimentation, but now that they are attempting an outright betrayal, we must move subtly so as not to panic them. Unlike our operatives, you are already part of the official research team, and publicly regarded as \u2013 how shall I put this? \u2013 a \u201csofty.\u201d\n\n\nTeo:\n In other words, I\u2019m beneath suspicion.\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n True enough. However, there is another reason we involve you: we feel you would be\u2026 personally motivated to see this situation resolved, and therefore approach it with the vindictiveness appropriate for dealing with traitors.\n\n\nTeo:\n \u201cPersonally motivated?\u201d How\u2019s that, exactly?\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n Some months ago, we became aware that SCP-8078 was more familiar to us than initially suspected\u2026 and to you, as it happens. If I can put this delicately, you knew 8078's father.\n\n\nTeo:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n You \nand\n Dr Magdaleno. As I understand it, his grief over the entity's death was the main reason why Magdaleno was forced to undergo rehabilitation.\n\n\nTeo:\n \u2026you mean\u2026 \nSCP-7955\n?\n He was 8078's \nfather?\n How is this even possible?!\n\n\nO5-\u2588:\n As of this moment, you are officially authorized for supervised access to Project Thetis and its secrets\u2026 if only because Michael Pelion's interference has jeopardized its efforts beyond repair, hence why we chose to involve ourselves directly in these matters. Mr Morton, would you be so kind as to turn the recorder off?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nMichael Pelion's diary (11/10/23)\n\n\n\n\nStill sick.\n\n\nRaznakovic never showed up to the meeting. Sam still in place, told me that Raznakovic never came to collect her. According to guards, she showed up to work, left as per usual, never came back.\n\n\nMaybe her client cancelled, maybe she chickened out, or maybe she just decided to leave the country her own way. Don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t care. Easy to believe that I won\u2019t be replaced now: threat of replacement might have been another of Raznakovic's lies.\n\n\nEven if real, the Foundation won't replace me. I'm the only one Sam truly listens to. They can give all the orders they like, and Sam won't follow a single one without my blessing. They \nneed\n me.\n\n\nMeanwhile, finally had a chance to meet Teo. Jittery little runt; too scared to return my handshake or exchange more than a few words with me. Must be an even bigger wimp than Raznakovic thought. She didn't want to stay after dark, so I've got the cell to myself tonight\u2026 and judging by her cowardice, she might be requesting a transfer soon anyway.\n\n\nSo, now it\u2019s just me and Sam. No more Raznakovic, no more spies, no more fear of being replaced. Just me and the woman I love.\n\n\nAlone at last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Remote\u00a0Surveillance\u00a0Report:\u00a009/10/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report (09/10/23):\n At 11:30 PM, Dr Raznakovic entered SCP-8078\u2019s cell with a briefcase, unaware that the cell's CCTV cameras were fully active. As per their plan, SCP-8078 then assumed the form of the briefcase and allowed Dr Raznakovic to remove it from the cell, leaving the briefcase behind as a decoy.\n\n\nUnknown to Dr Raznakovic, Research Assistant Teo then removed this decoy from the cell, added a pre-prepared audio monitoring device and GPS tracker to the lining, and then began tailing her from a distance.\n\n\nWhile passing through the final security checkpoint, Dr Raznakovic was briefly distracted by one of the guards on duty, allowing Research Assistant Teo to replace the disguised SCP-8078 with the decoy briefcase while it was passing through the metal detector.\n\n\nTeo then returned SCP-8078 to its cell, while Dr Raznakovic left Site 83 with the decoy briefcase. As per the official edict of the O5 Council, she was not prevented from leaving, as it was hoped that the listening device inside the briefcase would reveal the identity of Dr Raznakovic\u2019s buyer.\n\n\nHowever, approximately seven kilometers from the rendezvous, Dr Raznakovic became suspicious when \"SCP-8078\" did not move or respond to her instructions, and soon discovered both the ruse and the concealed listening device. Panicking, Dr Raznakovic left the main road, presumably in an attempt to avoid any pursuers. She then called the buyer to delay the rendezvous, unsuccessfully attempting to placate them by promising that their safety had not been compromised and that SCP-8078 could still be extracted.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe buyer was then heard to say, \"I'll be there shortly, we can discuss the matter in person\", before hanging up.\n10\n\n\nThirty-five seconds later, an unknown object audibly collided with Dr Raznakovic's car, and a loud growling could be heard outside. Over the sound of tearing metal, Dr Raznakovic could be heard screaming \"This wasn't my fault! It's Pelion you want!\" before both audio surveillance and GPS tracking abruptly went offline.\n\n\nA drone was dispatched to the approximate GPS coordinates to investigate, but by the time it arrived, the assailant had already left the area.\n\n\nFour metres from the wreckage of her car, the drone located the body of Dr Lina Raznakovic. Though badly wounded in the collision and subsequent attack, an autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was a stab wound to the left eyeball inflicted with a long blade or cannula, fatally perforating her brain and tunneling into her hippocampus.\n\n\nForensic examination failed to detect any tracks other than those left by Raznakovic, and no usable fingerprints were found on the car. There were no witnesses to the attack, as the area selected for the rendezvous was comparatively isolated and exhibited little civilian activity after dark. However, autopsies uncovered traces of biological residue similar to SCP-8078's on the victim's brain.\n\n\nCarved into the hood of Dr Raznakovic's car were the words \u201cCONSIDER THIS A STALEMATE. YOU CAN KEEP THE CHILD - FOR NOW.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u00a0MPT\u00a0Incident:\u00a012/10/23\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 13/10/23, 01:00 AM\n\n\nNOTE:\n This constitutes the final recording from Dr Lina Raznakovic's surveillance network prior to formal deactivation.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nTeo:\n Rise and shine!\n\n\nPelion:\n What the fuck?! Wha- (\ncoughs loudly\n) How the fuck did you get in here? I\u2026 (\ncoughs harder\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n Yeah, your attempt at locking the door didn\u2019t work, though I\u2019d blame that on you being sick as a dog. You look like shit, by the way.\n\n\nSound of bedsheets being flung aside as Pelion stands up.\n\n\nPelion:\n What\u2026 what are you doing in here?\n\n\nTeo:\n Me? I\u2019m watching a genius hard at work. You need help finding your boxers?\n\n\nPelion:\n I\u2026 (\ncoughs\n) I was just catching up on some sleep.\n\n\nTeo:\n You can drop the act, Pelion. That was SCP-8078 you were lying on, not a mattress. And more importantly, I saw the woman lying next to you \u2013 an extension of 8078\u2019s body by the looks of things. Clever trick.\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026You saw that?\n\n\nTeo:\n Of course. The cameras have been online all night: everything you did was recorded for posterity, from the moment 8078 went down on you from the moment you dozed off about three minutes after you reached climax.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nhoarse, rattling cough\n) You\u2019re bluffing. You couldn\u2019t have convinced security to put the cameras back on! (\ncough\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n I didn\u2019t need to convince security of anything: the O5s gave them direct orders.\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026the O5s?\n\n\nTeo:\n They decided I should be the one to break the news to you, considering I\u2019m your replacement. They even gave me a script outline. (\ntaps piece of paper\n) Call me crazy, Pelion but I get the impression you\u2019ve really pissed them off.\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026Oh\u2026 oh God.\n\n\nTeo:\n You\u2019re getting the picture, I take it?\n\n\nPelion:\n Are they\u2026 (\nstruggling for breath\n) are they watching this?\n\n\nTeo:\n They\u2019ve been watching for a while. That excuse for having the cameras turned off after 11 was decent, but it raised some red flags with security. If you\u2019d kept things on the down-low, you and Raznakovic \ncould\n have dodged an investigation, but then you murdered that D-class just before she could be questioned. After that, security got the Site Director involved, and the more D-classes kept turning up with injuries nobody could explain, the more interested the O5s got - especially once they realized that \nsomeone\n might be ruining \ntheir\n secret project.\n\n\nPelion:\n I\u2026 I\u2026 (\ncough\n) I know this\u2026 this must look bad, but I promise you, I can explain myself. Everything I did was in the name of Foundation security-\n\n\nTeo:\n Including that janitor who caught you with your pants down?\n\n\nPelion:\n That was not a janitor. You know, I know it, and so do the O5s! They probably sent him! (\nstruggling not to cough\n) We needed to keep the project a secret! We couldn\u2019t afford to let it be taken over by bureaucrats, not when we were so close to our goal! We were going to-\n\n\nTeo:\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were going to clear away the red tape, breathe new life into the system, and bring a new era to the Foundation while diddling 8078 at every other hour of the day \u2013 I know! I already know the whole fucking story, Pelion: the O5s shared all the gory details with me.\n\n\nPelion:\n Oh, the O5s told you, did they? (\ncoughs\n) You really trust everything the O5s have to say, Amanda? That\u2019s your name, right? You know for a fact that they let some of the worst crimes against humanity go unpunished. You know they\u2019re more than happy to use us as pawns if it serves their own agendas. How can you trust the word of the Council when-\n\n\nTeo:\n When they already let me listen to the blackmail material you and Raznakovic were collecting? Including the entry when she called me a simpering bimbo, by the way. I\u2019m guessing that was why you thought you could talk me into taking your side, right?\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026oh shit.\n\n\nTeo:\n Oh shit indeed. They also gave me your diary. Enlightening stuff, especially the bit when you figured out that you were disrupting a project that had direct O5 oversight\u2026 and then went right back to your usual games as if they \nwouldn't\n have your balls on a plate for it. Certainly gives me a lot of insight into the mindset of a traitor.\n\n\nPelion:\n I told you, everything I did was for the security of the Foundation!\n\n\nTeo:\n Is that why you were planning on leaving with Raznakovic and joining her clients as 8078\u2019s keeper? Or why you were raping 8078 every night of the week?\n\n\nPelion:\n I didn\u2019t rape anyone! I asked for consent! \nEverything I did was with Sam\u2019s consent!\n\n\nTeo:\n Oh sure, Pelion. It can\u2019t say no, can\u2019t disobey an order, and will do anything it can to please you, including salving your conscience. That just \nscreams\n \u201cconsent,\u201d doesn\u2019t it? But then, you didn\u2019t bother to think about that, not when it might have put those romantic delusions of yours at risk.\n\n\nPelion:\n It\u2019s not a delusion! Sam and I are lovers, and if you can\u2019t understand that-\n\n\nTeo:\n (\nsighs\n) No, Pelion, 8078 is your slave and you\u2019re its master. If you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, then you never will. Frankly, I don\u2019t expect you to see the light in what little time you have left.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\ncoughs\n) What are you talking about?\n\n\nTeo:\n All that sex and you never stopped to think about those tiny particles of shapeshifter that were being left behind in your body. You \nknow\n that whenever 8078 gets hurt, its first instinct is to reassemble and regenerate, and that\u2019s what all those little pieces started trying to do once you'd finished digging trenches. But of course, they can't find their original body, so they've merged with any nearby tissue and started to grow - \ninvasively\n, damaging healthy organs and altering your body as they've expanded. We\u2019ve got a funny little word for this. Care to guess what it is?\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nchoking sounds\n)\u2026 c-cancer.\n\n\nTeo:\n (\napplause\n) Good boy! I'd call it the worst STD you\u2019ll ever have in your pathetic life, but really, it's just a sign that your body's finally become as malignant as your attitude. In fact, if you\u2019d been conscious enough to take a good look in a mirror these last few hours, you might have noticed some of the more visible symptoms already.\n\n\nPelion:\n Oh\u2026 oh m-my god\u2026\n\n\nTeo:\n That\u2019s a new finger forming on your right hand, isn\u2019t it? New eyes popping up all over your shoulders, too. Judging by the sound of your breathing, those gills on your throat are causing you trouble. And is that a rattlesnake tail sticking out of your ass?\n\n\nPelion:\n What\u2019s\u2026 (\ndry heaving\n) \u2026what\u2019s going to happen to me?\n\n\nTeo:\n Glad you asked. See, 8078 isn't the only one of its kind: certain secret societies have studied its people over the years, and they learned all about the condition you\u2019re suffering from, even found ways of moderating it so they could get what they wanted out of its sufferers before they died \u2013 the Rite of the Shining Brow, for example \u2013 and as luck would have it, we\u2019ve inherited their research.\n\n\nPelion:\n (\nwhimpering in pain\n) Get to the fucking point!\n\n\nTeo:\n The tumours in your body are trying to reform into a complete adult shapeshifter, but there\u2019s only so much they can do with the material they have; eventually, they stop trying to reform and start reshaping you into something more\u2026 reproductive.\n\n\nPelion:\n WHAT?\n\n\nTeo:\n You heard me. If you survive the initial symptoms, you\u2019re basically going to be one big womb. No shape, no brain, just a self-fertilizing protoplasmic mass ready to spit out a baby shapeshifter. And once you've given birth, you'll evaporate into a grey smear of residue for the janitors to scrub away.\n\n\nPelion:\n You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re lying!\n\n\nTeo:\n Where do you think we got 8078 in the first place?\n\n\nPelion:\n No, this can\u2019t\u2026 (\ncoughs\n) this can\u2019t end like this!\n\n\nTeo:\n I'm afraid it can. Anyway, I think that\u2019s almost everything the O5s wanted to say to you, so I can hand things over the research team that will be studying you the rest of your hopefully short life. It\u2019s been emotional, Mike. Buh-bye.\n\n\nPelion:\n Sam, block the door.\n\n\nSound of rapid shapeshifting\n\n\nPelion:\n You\u2019re not leaving\u2026 until you\u2019ve given me that research.\n\n\nTeo:\n Thinking of saving your life with it, are we?\n\n\nPelion:\n I swear\u2026 I'll\u2026 (\ncoughs\n)\u2026 I'll break your neck if you don't tell me where to-\n\n\nTeo:\n No you won't.\n\n\nPelion collapses; he is not heard to rise.\n\n\nTeo:\n 8078, stand away from the door, please?\n\n\nPelion:\n Go ahead, give her orders. Tell her to kill me if you like. It won't make any difference: she loves \nme\n, not you. (\ncoughs\n) She\u2019ll hate you for this, Teo. She\u2019ll do everything she can to ruin your plans, undermine you at every turn, and all because you and the rest of the Foundation are so far from feeling real human emotions you don't know what a loving relationship looks like anymore. (\ncoughs\n)\n\n\nTeo:\n You know what? (\nsound of crumpling paper\n) Fuck the script. 8078, I am now giving you permission to do as you please for the next five minutes.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n What?! I\u2026 but I\u2026 I don\u2019t-\n\n\nTeo:\n Pelion and I are giving you conflicting orders, right? He wants you to stop me from leaving, maybe even kill me. I just want you to leave this room and never look back. You can\u2019t do both. So, you have to make a choice.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n H-how? How do I choose? \nWhat\n do I choose? I\u2026 need orders! Please! You have to give me orders!\n\n\nTeo:\n Do what you think is the right thing to do. That\u2019s the only order I can give, 8078. I think Pelion\u2019s in agreement with me on this, aren\u2019t you, Pelion?\n\n\nPelion:\n For once, yes. (\ncough\n) Do it, Sam. Do what feels right for you. Show her what kind of a relationship we really have.\n\n\nTeo:\n You heard him, 8078. My life is in your hands.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m\u2026 sorry.\n\n\nSound of shapeshifting as SCP-8078 moves across the cell\n\n\nPelion:\n \u2026Sam? W-where are you going? Sam? Sam?!\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nPelion:\n WAIT! Whatever I did wrong, I\u2019m prepared to discuss it; things will be better between us, I promise you! We\u2019ll be better! Everything will be better! Just\u2026 just stay here! Please! I love you! Don\u2019t you remember how much I (\ncoughs violently\n)\u2026 how much I\u2026 (\ncoughs\n) how\u2026 (\ngasping for breath\n)\u2026 you gave your consent! You didn\u2019t say no to anything! You made yourself into anything I wanted! What\u2019s that if not love? (\ncough\n) Weren\u2019t we in love?\n\n\nNo response; the cell door opens.\n\n\nPelion:\n Sam (\ncough\n)\u2026 please\u2026 don\u2019t leave me\u2026 like this\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8078 exits, the door shutting behind it.\n\n\nTeo:\n (\ninto radio\n) He\u2019s ready. Tell Aristaios his consolation prize is waiting for him. Meanwhile, get 8078 to its new cell on the double; if I never see this rapeshed of a cell ever again, it\u2019ll be too soon.\n\n\nShe exits; remaining twenty seconds of audio feature Pelion coughing loudly, emitting harsh, gasping vocalizations between coughs; it is not clear if he is laughing or sobbing.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nNOTE:\n Former Research Assistant Michael Pelion was remanded to the custody of Dr Quentin Aristaios shortly after this recording.

How are you feeling?\n\n\nPause, interrupted by the sound of SCP-8078's body rippling; pattern recognition analysis suggests that SCP-8078 is nervous or unsure of how to respond.\n\n\nTeo:\n (\nconcerned\n) Um, is 8078 okay with you? I mean, if you'd rather have a human name like Sam-\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Y-you don\u2019t have to call me Sam, Research Assistant Teo. Sam was what Mike called me, but I don't think that's who I am. And I don't think I'm \u201cdarling,\u201d \u201csweetheart,\u201d \u201cangel,\u201d \u201clove,\u201d \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201csugar,\u201d or any of the other names he gave me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cher\u201d either, and I think I wasn\u2019t even \u201chim\u201d or \u201che\u201d when he asked me to be male. I'm none of those things, and I'm not Sam.\n\n\nTeo:\n \u2026that\u2019s the first real objection I\u2019ve ever heard from you.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2019m sorry. But I feel I have to object. The name feels \nwrong\n for me now. 8078 is enough. It\u2019s the only name that feels right. It doesn\u2019t remind me of\u2026 of\u2026 what happened. (\nquickly\n) I mean, I'll probably be happy with a name of your choosing later, it's just that-\n\n\nTeo:\n It's okay, 8078, you don't have to make excuses. If 8078 is the name you want, then it's your name. (\npause\n) Besides, it's still too soon for me to start calling you Taliesin. Not that I would, obviously\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n \"Taliesin\"? I've heard that name before. What does it mean?\n\n\nTeo:\n I'll tell you when you're older.\n\n\nPause; sounds indicate that SCP-8078 is shifting rapidly, suggesting anxiety.\n\n\nSCP-8078\n: Mike isn\u2019t coming back, is he? I still don\u2019t know why people go away and never come back, but I think I understood what was happening back there: he\u2019s gone for good, isn\u2019t he?\n\n\nTeo:\n That\u2019s right, 8078. He\u2019s gone forever.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n \u2026I\u2019ll miss him.\n\n\nTeo:\n But why? He did horrible things to-\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I know. It took me too long to work it out, but I know that he was\u2026 hurting me. But I miss him all the same. I don't know why; maybe it's the same reason why I can't stop myself from following orders. But I wish I hadn't left him alone. I wish I'd helped him\u2026 just one last time.\n\n\nA three-minute pause follows; gradually, the sounds slow, indicating that SCP-8078 is transforming at a more relaxed pace as it calms.\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n Is there anything I can do for you, Amanda?\n\n\nTeo:\n Well, we don\u2019t have any experiments scheduled for at least a week, and I\u2019m not going to force my choice in entertainment on you. So, for now\u2026 why don't \nyou\n decide what to watch on TV today?\n\n\nSCP-8078:\n I\u2026 I think I can do that.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Interviewed: SCP-8078 Interviewer: Dr Lina Raznakovic Foreword: This was the first interview of SCP-8078 once it was properly contained. Though it had already been interrogated after capture, it was hoped that additional questioning could uncover any information it had not previously included, but SCP-8078's compulsive need to appease its keepers by any means (including lying) prompted an end to further interviews. <Begin Log, 01:00 PM, 01/02/23)> Dr Raznakovic: Good afternoon, 8078. How are you? SCP-8078: I\u2019m fine, Dr Raznakovic. I\u2019ve been learning a lot today and making myself extra helpful. Security Officer Lin has been teaching me about clothes. Dr Raznakovic: ( pause ) How so? SCP-8078: I used to think that people just had fur and scales like other animals, but then I saw Security Officer Lin take off his jacket this morning. I was so scared \u2013 I thought he\u2019d hurt himself! But he showed me he was okay, and it\u2019s not really fur or scales. So now I\u2019m learning how to make real clothing when I make myself into people. This is my scarf. Do you like it? Dr Raznakovic: Where did you copy that from? SCP-8078: I saw Research Assistant Pelion wearing it a little while ago. Dr Raznakovic: Remind me to have a word with him about uniform regulations: he\u2019s not supposed to wear that in the lab. SCP-8078 : You\u2019re to have a word with Research Assistant Pelion about unif- Dr Raznakovic: Not now, 8078, later. SCP-8078: Sorry. Um, is there anything else I can do for you? Dr Raznakovic: I have a few official questions for concerning your personal knowledge. First, what are you? How do you see yourself? SCP-8078: Well, I learned how to make a mirror from my arm last week, so I guess I can just loo- Dr Raznakovic: ( sighs ) What do you think you are? What do you believe yourself to be compared to human beings? SCP-8078: I\u2019m not sure, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m whatever anyone needs me to be, though. Dr Raznakovic: Do you recall how you arrived in Site 83\u2018s offices? SCP-8078: No. I think I woke up in one of the air vents, so I might have gotten in that way, but I don't remember anything before that. Dr Raznakovic: Very well, then. Onto the next question: do you know how you shapeshift? SCP-8078: Yes, Dr Raznakovic, like this. ( audibly transforms, producing sounds of flowing water ) Dr Raznakovic: No, no, I mean\u2026 ( under breath ) Who the hell wrote these? ( aloud ) How does your shapeshifting ability actually work? do you understand how you spontaneously generate and subtract mass - if that's what you actually do? Or are you drawing it in from another dimension? SCP-8078: Don't you already know? You change every time you move, so you must be shapeshifting too. Dr Raznakovic: ( confused ) \u20268078, I don't shapeshift. SCP-8078: Then how do you walk? Your legs don't stay exactly the same shape when they move, so they have to change so they can move. Isn't that how that works? Dr Raznakovic: \u2026well, yes - technically. Muscles do have to change shape in order to move, but not in the same way that you change. SCP-8078: Oh. Is there anything else you'd like to ask me? Dr Raznakovic: ( audibly leafing through papers ) Nothing for now, thank you. I think it might be for the best if we postpone this interview while I edit these questions for clearer syntax\u2026 <End Log>",

Just need to get through the day, then I can go home and watch Dogville. At least Dogville has a happy ending. I'm fine.",
        "Lost it again. Feeling guilty, but not for breaking the rules. Something about 8078\u2019s eagerness to please makes me want to set things right somehow\u2026 but there\u2019s also something about it that makes me think of new possibilities. What if all this time, I\u2019ve had the greatest prize in the Foundation\u2019s history under my nose and never noticed until today?",
        "MP is an idiot. His project isn't going to work, the final stage least of all. Still, it's not all bad. I've been stuck on this rung for far too long; maybe this could be another way up the career ladder\u2026 but I'll have to have some footage of my own to make sure MP doesn't do anything stupid. With a little creative editing, maybe I can come out of this mess clean.",
        "Expected to feel much guiltier over deliberately hurting our test subjects, but the more I see of them, the more I hate them. The fact that these ones are mentally ill doesn\u2019t change a thing: they had a chance to seek treatment before they turned criminal, and they blew it. Then again, it\u2019s not as if we have to kill them. One really makes me want to vomit \u2013 D-99942. Her bio says it all: she thought her baby was a demon, drowned him in the tub, wasn\u2019t even caught until she tried to have a priest consecrate the bathwater. Now spends all her days half-medicated and weeping as if she\u2019s the injured party. At least in here, she\u2019s making the world a better place. Allowed 8078 to have some fun with her in all the forms I could suggest - even let it fall on her as a bookshelf. Pretty sure it was grateful for the exercise. Maybe it\u2019s just my imagination, but I swear it was smiling at me as we wrapped up for the night: I\u2019m pretty sure it forgives me for what happened that night, but is there something else?",
        "That didn't take too long. Mrs D 7 collapsed on her way back to quarters with a punctured lung, probably from the Kodiak bear hug. Now the medical staff are suspicious: they're having her medication increased so they can get coherent answers out of her. I told MP that we needed to patch this up or we'd lose his entire project. Once he was satisfied that we wouldn't be able to get our hands on Amnestics without it ending up on record, he gave the go-ahead. The idiot was shockingly casual about it, didn't even seem to care that this was all his fault. I'd ask why this guy wasn't fired after his last psych eval, but then, I was the idiot that helped him dodge the evaluation. I'm guessing he's been hiding the full extent of his issues until now, otherwise he'd never have gotten this far.",
        "This is getting out of hand. The injuries keep stacking up, and while we haven't had any further deaths, MP's recklessness is hard to control. I need an emergency exit, just in case it all goes south. The good news is that Our Friend 8 has made it very easy to request emergency budgets. Buying the necessary software for the exit will be pricey and require a bit of creative bookkeeping, but I can guarantee that there will be interested parties - one good thing I learned from the CIA. I just need to find one that won't kill me as soon as the sale is complete. Meanwhile, MP is somehow even less helpful than usual: he refuses to assist with cleanup, instead just listening to that terrible Georgia Gibbs song \"Kiss Of Fire\" on his phone. How is it that I've ended up as research partner to a man with his head jammed so far up his ass he could probably lick the underside of his own brain?",
        "Noticed the strangest thing this evening: Sam talks in its her sleep. When she's dormant in her bath, she keeps muttering words and sentences, most of them pretty nonsensical: \"the search,\" \"in his father's footsteps,\" \"the begotten,\" \"the house on hope street,\" \"what we leave behind,\" etc\u2026 However, one thing made sense - a name: \u201cAristaios.\u201d I know him: a researcher from Site 44, disagreeable snob - what the folks there like to call \"Oxbridge.\" I remember he once got into an argument with Archives about accessing materials on Memetic control, wanted to apply them to Pavlovian techniques. Scuttlebutt is that his research was being conducted under O5 supervision, so had to be something pretty impressive. He was badly injured in cargo plane crash about seven months ago, left comatose. Still recovering in physical therapy, last I heard. Funny thing: all the stuff from his plane went straight to our Site. Can't be a coincidence.",
        "Getting the impression that Sam feels something for me. Been calling her a friend for a while now, but it\u2019s only now I've realize I\u2019ve been feeling the same way for her. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone I can be so open with or anyone who trusts me so completely. I'm not like the others: she doesn\u2019t obey because she\u2019s compelled to. With me, she obeys because she likes me \u2013 because she knows that I feel the same way about her. Never thought I\u2019d write this, but I\u2019m a better person around her: self-medication, rage, anxiety, despair \u2013 it's all smothered into silence when I'm with her. Like draping a blanket over a birdcage. With about two hours left after every experiment and Raznakovic not interested in sticking around, I'm regularly sharing the time with Sam, just to make a change from the usual entertainment she usually has to put up with. She seems to like listening to me read aloud, especially Trilby and La Philosophie Dans Le Boudoir . I\u2019m thinking I should find a way to watch some movies together. After all, she\u2019s helped me; it\u2019s time I helped her. After all, what are friends for?",
        "MP is acting very oddly - more than usual. He arranged a movie night for himself in Our Friend's room this evening, even shared a bucket of popcorn with them 9 . Because my hidden camera was angled away from the screen, I couldn't tell what they were watching, but judging by the sound effects, it was one of the animated kids' films that we've been using to teach Our Friend about fiction. MP would not shut up: he kept asking if Our Friend used to be like the main character, if they could give themselves pink hair and fangs, even if they would save the day by turning into \"a pink cereal-mascot dragon,\" whatever the hell that means. Then he started rambling on about the Lars Von Trier films he likes, about his ex-wife's collection of Pixar DVDs, about the importance of unlocking Our Friend's true potential \"like any good friend would\". I'm not even sure if he's calling Our Friend by name anymore, though I couldn't hear precisely over the TV noise. Then he touched them - actually put his bare arms around Our Friend, even after all the warnings over potential biohazards. Our Friend clearly didn't know what to make of it, and seemed a little unsettled, though MP kept saying that it was \"just something friends do.\" And as if that wasn't strange enough, he also asked Our Friend if they would be willing to model itself on something they saw in \"a different kind of movie.\" And he seemed very excited when they said yes. Exit strategy planning is well underway, and just as well, because with the way MP's been acting, I'm not sure how much longer we can maintain secrecy. Thankfully, the Dark Web continues to offer dividends\u2026 along with one extremely insistent potential buyer: Tegid Foel. Odd alias, but at least the owner seems marginally less tightfisted than MC&D.",
        "Now certain it\u2019s more than just friendship between us. This kind of closeness isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can fake. I think Sam might be falling in love with me. Crazy as it sounds, I'm already in love with Sam. Don\u2019t know what else could have made me hug her the way I did that night, or why I took her dancing an hour later. Yes, dancing. Actual dancing, with music playing and everything. Sam knows my rhythms so well, like we\u2019ve been together for years. Waltz, tango, polka, she can follow on without missing a single step. How could this be possible if there wasn\u2019t a connection between us? Know I should be focussing on next experiments, but can only think what happens afterwards: the movies, the dancing, the shared drinks, even some of the nicer meals I can sneak in. All I can think of is\u2026 Guess there\u2019s no better word for it than romance.",
        "I haven\u2019t felt close to anyone in the last two years: no nights out at the movies, no candlelit dinners, no dancing, no anniversaries. Now that I\u2019ve finally found someone that I can be almost normal around, it\u2019s a shapeshifting blob of oil and gold. And yet, she means more to me than any ordinary human being, because she can be any human being and yet so much more. Last few nights, I\u2019ve been sneaking an air mattress into the cell so I can catch up on some sleep. Not sure how that evolved into letting Sam sleep next to me (in one of her human forms), but somehow it did. Last night, I held her in my arms, just to see if she was truly comfortable around me; not only did she let it happen, but she hugged me back. Now I\u2019m certain we\u2019re meant to be together. Whatever conditioning Dr Aristaios forced on her, it doesn't apply to us: she doesn't listen to me because of the brainwashing - she listens to me because she loves me. I need to tell her how I feel. I need to let her know that I love her as much as she loves me.",
        "Briefly tempted to try Sam in other forms, even gave her some more reference material so she could be around twenty other women. Had her shift through all the new shapes she'd learned in a striptease of sorts, showing me how she could adjust their attributes at will, or even combine the forms to make new ones. Striptease fascinating, but ultimately juvenile, especially given that most of said reference material consisted of porn. In the end, decided that I liked Sam best in the first form I taught her: I'm a better person now, don't need to be with anyone else but her. Besides, Sam seems to like her new default form the best, seems to enjoy sex the most in that form. Inclined to agree: sex has never been better. But it\u2019s not just the sex: there\u2019s a level of intimacy I\u2019ve never known with my ex-wife or any other human on this planet. She cares for me. She must, otherwise she\u2019d never consent to any of this.",
        "Now I know why MP's been bringing in all those gynecological textbooks for Our Friend to study. In a word, urgh. I had to confront him about it, but he's not interested in listening. He calls Our Friend \"Sam\" now. He claims to be in love, even insists that \"she\" loves him back independently, and clearly doesn't realize that this is impossible. I did a little digging, and according to personnel records, \"Samantha\" was the name of MP's ex-wife, another sign this project was doomed from the start: he's always had too many personal issues tangled up in what should have been purely objective. I warned him about maintaining emotional distance, but all he said was \"so you\u2019d like me to go back to treating Sam like a punching bag, is that it?\" I tried to discuss the physical hazards, but he just said, \"I\u2019ve found true love, and all you can think is how unprofessional it is.\" And when I told him that Our Friend didn't really love him, he called me a soulless cunt and stormed off. This can only end in tears. Thank God the exit strategy is well underway: I've already received several generous responses, but I've still got to consider my own safety and the risk of getting caught. So far, only one buyer - Tegid Foel - seems to cover both issues, and conveniently enough, this one seems to understand my offer the best. Whoever they are, they are very anxious to meet Our Friend\u2026 and might be the best placed to pay top dollar for it.",
        "Raznakovic disapproves of everything, glacial streak of joyless puritanical piss that she is. No big surprise there, but it's not like she can stop me, not with the dirt I've got on her. One worrying thing: I keep getting the feeling that someone's watching me when I'm alone with Sam\u2026",
        "MP's been cooing over Our Friend more aggressively than usual, insisting on plenty of peace and quiet so they can \"recover from all the stress.\" Apparently, they've been suffering from disturbed sleep, even nightmares, and MP seems to think it's because we've been working them too hard. He's wrong. Our Friend is suffering from disturbed sleep, but it's almost certainly due to MP himself, judging by the sounds that Our Friend has been making in their sleep: verbatim mimicries of everything MP has said during coitus. Even worse are the sounds afterwards, performed in Our Friend's default voice: they're crying . MP still doesn't realize what he's doing. He's not a psychopath - psychopaths can and will remain uncaring. A psychopath wouldn't be so attentive to 8078's feelings. He still has a semblance of empathy. So how can he not know what he's doing to them?",
        "Now convinced someone's watching me. Need to find out who and why. Sam's too precious to be at risk; project's too close to completion to be risked\u2026",
        "Goddamn MP and his endless talk of being watched is getting on my last nerve. Worse still, his paranoia is starting to rub off on me. While I was taking out the trash last night, I could have sworn someone was watching me out there in the darkness, but when I went to look beyond my fence, all I found was an owl in a tree.",
        "Finally caught the motherfucker spying on us: janitor, supposedly. Snooping perve was watching me and Sam together when we noticed him. Knew we couldn\u2019t let him leave. Don\u2019t know if he was just nosy or working for O5s, but couldn\u2019t have him blabbing, not when we\u2019re so close to finishing the project. So\u2026 Sam and I played a new game. Had to leave soon after: cameras were about to switch back on, couldn\u2019t afford to get caught in the same room. Sam was really upset about the whole thing, as all I could do was coach her through a half-assed excuse before getting the hell out of there \u2013 will have to make it up to her soon. At least I\u2019ve got an alibi for the night. Think I\u2019m coming down with a cold, so I can just pretend to be too sick to have stayed for long after the experiment ended.",
        "idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot!!! Okay. First item on the agenda: stiff drink. Second item on the agenda: contact Tegid Foel.",
        "All gone to shit. Plan dead in the water, Raznakovic\u2019s a liar and thief, and I\u2019m still sick. Sweating, dizzy, coughing, runny nose, too tired to be conscious but too conscious to sleep. Massive bruise on my stomach doesn't help - goddamn Raznakovic and her knuckleduster. Spent a couple of days agonizing. Must have worked my way through my entire music collection. But eventually \"Tonight You Belong To Me\" came to the rescue and I realized there might be another way: maybe Raznakovic\u2019s client could put Sam to better use than Foundation ever could. Even if they won\u2019t, maybe I can convince the new owner to let me stay on as Sam\u2019s keeper. Bit of a stretch, probably trying too hard to justify what I\u2019m going to do but have to look for any positive I can. Guess I\u2019ll have to play along with the ice-queen\u2019s plan, then\u2026 and hope that this bout of the \u2018flu\u2019s over by the time the 10th rolls around.",
        "MP left his diary in the cell today, where anyone could have seen it. Turns out he's been doing therapeutic writing of his own. Guess he wasn't joking when he suggested that we'd seen the same therapist - Dr Zachary has a lot to answer for. Trouble is, the idiot's diary isn't coded or written on something easy to destroy, so he's risking a security breach whenever he takes the diary home, and he's basically confessed to every illegal activity he's been involved with for the last few months! I was angry enough, even before I saw the latest entry. If MP thinks I'll let him endanger this deal by begging for a job, he's either drunk or an even bigger idiot than expected. Either way, this is the final straw. I'm done with him - done with his attitude, delusions, the shitty 1950s love songs he listens to, done, done, fucking done . He can go back to roofying widows at funerals or whatever the loathsome little shit used to do in his spare time, and he'd best enjoy it, because I'm not bailing him out anymore. So, with permission from Tegid Foel, the meeting's been moved to the 9th. Our Friend has been briefed, though of course they don't yet realize that MP has been given the wrong date. Once the gifts have been exchanged, I'll email my edited footage to security; that should keep them too busy to notice I've left the country. Hopefully, they'll give MP a memorable retirement; frankly, death by shapeshifting fox would be too good for the syphilitic little bastard. Strange thing, though: once the briefing was over, Our Friend asked me if I could tell it how to disobey. They told me that they weren't comfortable with the \"games\" that they've been ordered to play, or with the way \"Mike\" touches them. Apparently, they don't know how to disobey him, and all but begged me to teach them how to say \"no.\" I had to tell them to just suck it up and behave themselves. Harsh of me, but that can't be helped right now: the last thing I need is for Our Friend to get cold feet before I get my money.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-8078 Interviewer: Research Assistant Amanda Teo <Begin Log, 07/10/23, 9:00 AM> Research Assistant Teo: Good morning, 8078. I\u2019m Amanda Teo; I\u2019ll be looking after you while Research Assistant Pelion\u2019s on sick leave. SCP-8078: I thought we would meet on the 11th. Teo: Slight change in schedule: I thought I was going to be picking up a friend today, but it turns out he\u2019s not well enough to leave rehab yet, so my timetable\u2019s free. Sorry about the change in routine. SCP-8078: That\u2019s quite alright, Research Assistant Teo. I\u2019m very happy to meet whenever works best for you. Teo: Good. Anyway, let\u2019s get down to more serious matters concerning your behaviour and security. Do you have any questions before we begin? SCP-8078: Only one. If you\u2019ve spoken to Dr Raznakovic, do you know if everything\u2019s prepared for the 9th day of this month? Teo: \u2026um\u2026 no. ( nervous ) I didn\u2019t know anything was supposed to be prepared for the 9th at all. ( sounds of papers being leafed through ) Dammit. Must have missed a memo. At the risk of sounding really, really stupid, would you mind explaining what\u2019s supposed to be happening on the 9th? SCP-8078: Dr Raznakovic will be taking me away on the 9th. Teo: \u2026What do you mean by \u201ctaking you away?\u201d SCP-8078: She wants me to become a briefcase and remain quiet while she carries me out to her car. She\u2019s taking me to meet some new friends, about twenty-five kilometers from here; after an exchange of gifts, they\u2019re going to take me to a new home. ( pause ) Teo: I\u2019m sorry, what. SCP-8078: She also says she\u2019s going to leave an ordinary briefcase in this room, but I don\u2019t understand why. Teo: Dr Raznakovic told you all of this? She actually said this out loud? SCP-8078: Yes. She didn\u2019t say it was a game, so it\u2019s not meant to be Our Little Secret, and she told me to take this seriously, and since she told me that I was permitted to discuss serious matters with members of the research team- Teo: -you felt it was safe to discuss it with me. ( to the security guard on duty ) You heard what it said, right? I didn\u2019t just imagine that, did I? Guard Morton: I heard it too, yeah. Teo: Okay then, I think you might want to give the security chief a call. ( clears throat ) 8078, is there anything else that you haven\u2019t been able to understand recently? ( in the background, Morton can be heard calling security ) SCP-8078: ( uneasy ) \u2026Some of the games that Mike plays with me have been\u2026 have felt wrong. I\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say this, but- Teo: Please, anything you know could be helpful. Just telling me what these games are would be enough. SCP-8078: Bedroom games. ( pause ) Teo: I beg your pardon? SCP-8078: Every night, at around 1 or 2 AM, after the experiments are over and Dr Raznakovic's left, Mike takes off all his clothes and plays bedroom games with me. Teo: \u2026he does WHAT?! SCP-8078: I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Teo: No, I\u2019m not angry with you, I\u2026 just to be clear, Mike \u2013 that\u2019s Research Assistant Michael Pelion, right? \u2013 he's been having sex with you every day of the week? SCP-8078: \u2026I don\u2019t know what sex is, Research Assistant Teo. Teo: Jesus. Erm, what does Dr Raznakovic think about all this? SCP-8078: ( in Raznakovic's voice ) \"8078, if you can\u2019t find a way to say no of your own accord, then maybe you were never meant to, and wasting my time isn\u2019t going to make a lick of difference to either of us.\" Teo: Holy fuck. Morton: Mandy, the security chief just notified the Site Director. You\u2019ve been scheduled for an emergency call. Teo: What? ( phone rings ) Ah shit. ( into phone ) Good morning, Director. Uh, thank you for responding, but I didn\u2019t suspect this was serious enough to justify your involvement. ( pause ) For what it\u2019s worth, yes, I believe it. ( pause ) Well, there\u2019s also the fact that a research assistant has been having sex with SCP-8078. ( pause ) What? ( pause ) Meaning no offence, what ongoing investigation, and by who? Why do we need a conference call? Who else is there to talk to about thi- oh my god\u2026 ( pause ) Teo: 8078\u2026 there are some people on the phone who\u2019d like to speak to you. Don\u2019t be scared. Just tell them exactly what you told me and answer any questions they might have. I\u2019m just going to put them on speakerphone\u2026 O5-\u2588: You may begin, 8078. ( the following twenty minutes have been redacted for the sake of brevity and security ) O5-\u2588: Very good, 8078. Please cease listening for a moment: we wish to speak to Ms Teo concerning confidential matters. Teo: Me? Um, no disrespect intended, but what do you need me for, sir? O5-\u2588: Misdirection. The suspects were already being investigated under suspicion of multiple counts of murder and illegal experimentation, but now that they are attempting an outright betrayal, we must move subtly so as not to panic them. Unlike our operatives, you are already part of the official research team, and publicly regarded as \u2013 how shall I put this? \u2013 a \u201csofty.\u201d Teo: In other words, I\u2019m beneath suspicion. O5-\u2588: True enough. However, there is another reason we involve you: we feel you would be\u2026 personally motivated to see this situation resolved, and therefore approach it with the vindictiveness appropriate for dealing with traitors. Teo: \u201cPersonally motivated?\u201d How\u2019s that, exactly? O5-\u2588: Some months ago, we became aware that SCP-8078 was more familiar to us than initially suspected\u2026 and to you, as it happens. If I can put this delicately, you knew 8078's father. Teo: I beg your pardon? O5-\u2588: You and Dr Magdaleno. As I understand it, his grief over the entity's death was the main reason why Magdaleno was forced to undergo rehabilitation. Teo: \u2026you mean\u2026 SCP-7955 ? He was 8078's father? How is this even possible?! O5-\u2588: As of this moment, you are officially authorized for supervised access to Project Thetis and its secrets\u2026 if only because Michael Pelion's interference has jeopardized its efforts beyond repair, hence why we chose to involve ourselves directly in these matters. Mr Morton, would you be so kind as to turn the recorder off? [END LOG]",
        "Still sick. Raznakovic never showed up to the meeting. Sam still in place, told me that Raznakovic never came to collect her. According to guards, she showed up to work, left as per usual, never came back. Maybe her client cancelled, maybe she chickened out, or maybe she just decided to leave the country her own way. Don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t care. Easy to believe that I won\u2019t be replaced now: threat of replacement might have been another of Raznakovic's lies. Even if real, the Foundation won't replace me. I'm the only one Sam truly listens to. They can give all the orders they like, and Sam won't follow a single one without my blessing. They need me. Meanwhile, finally had a chance to meet Teo. Jittery little runt; too scared to return my handshake or exchange more than a few words with me. Must be an even bigger wimp than Raznakovic thought. She didn't want to stay after dark, so I've got the cell to myself tonight\u2026 and judging by her cowardice, she might be requesting a transfer soon anyway. So, now it\u2019s just me and Sam. No more Raznakovic, no more spies, no more fear of being replaced. Just me and the woman I love. Alone at last."
