Access to Locker-348 and use of SCP-4635 for experimental purposes is only permitted to MTF Alpha-7 ('Literature Professors') operatives who have been administered with a Class-LE amnestic\n1\n or who do not possess any grasp of the English language.\n\n\nPersonnel exposed to SCP-4635 without the above prerequisites are to be administered Class-A and/or Class-LE amnestics and placed under observation for any manifestations of SCP-4635's effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4635 is a VHS tape with the label 'Language Mastery, Tape 1: English' taped on one side. No manufacturer logo or name can be found on the tape. SCP-4635 can be played and rewound normally on any VHS tape players without any internal problems with the tape player.\n\n\nSCP-4635's contents include a six minute, thirty-five second video hereby designated as SCP-4635-1. SCP-4635-1 resembles an instructional video on how to speak basic English (A comprehensive summary of SCP-4635-1's details are covered in Addendum 4635-2).\n\n\nSCP-4635-1's anomalous effects will only manifest should an individual who has a grasp of the English language watch it, regardless of their mastery of the language. Should such an individual watch or listen to SCP-4635-1 for a duration of greater than one minute, they will experience a temporary paralytic shock and are subsequently incapacitated for a maximum duration of 24 hours.\n\n\nFollowing the individual's recovery from their initial shock, they will begin to experience the following symptoms within three months:\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty in understanding words or sentences being spoken in English\n\n\nDifficulty in reading documents or messages written in English\n\n\nDifficulty in writing words or sentences in English\n\n\nDifficulty in speaking English words or sentences\n\n\n\n\nAfter a duration of three months, the individual\u2019s grasp of the English language will degenerate to a point where they will find themselves completely unable to understand or express their thoughts in English. All attempts to help these individuals re-learn English or to help them forget SCP-4635-1 using amnestics at that point of manifestation have been unsuccessful.\n\n\nAddendum 4635-1:\n \nDiscovery\n\n\nSCP-4635 was discovered in the home of Mr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (PoI-4367) in Liverpool, England on September 25th, 19\u2588\u2588. Following the recovery of SCP-4635, Mr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was interrogated by Foundation agents about SCP-4635.\n\n\n\n\nOPEN\u00a0SCP-4635\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0FILE\u00a0(LEVEL\u00a04\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED)\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Mr. A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, former possessor of SCP-4635\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Frederick Orwell, Site-32 Head Researcher\n\n\nForeword:\n The interview was conducted entirely in Russian, and has been translated to English.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 0945 hours>\n\n\nFO:\n How did you come across this tape?\n\n\nA:\n I think\u2026it used to be my father's. He passed it on to me when he died.\n\n\nFO:\n I see. Did your father also lose his ability to speak English?\n\n\nA:\n No. He always only spoke in Russian. He came from Russia, you see. I think he probably bought that tape to learn English. But\u2026I don't think he ever got round to using it.\n\n\nFO:\n And did your father ever say who he bought the tape from?\n\n\nA:\n He said he bought it from some small town market here, from a hooded man.\n\n\nFO:\n And did your father ever remember who that guy was, or what he looked like?\n\n\nA:\n I don\u2019t think so.

In addition, several of your fellow researchers have claimed that you have not been recording these tests, putting forward the possibility that you are not observing the regulations of Foundation testing on D-Class personnel. Hence, the Ethics Committee would like to send an official warning to you.\n\n\nShould this warning not be heeded, disciplinary action may follow. This may include banning you from testing for an extended period of time.\n\n\nThis warning also comes following several reports given by your fellow researchers regarding your irregular behaviour in recent weeks. If you are facing problems, psychological or otherwise, consult with your Site Psychological Team for the best solution that can help you.\n\n\n- The Ethics Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nAddendum 4635-3:\n \n21/02/09 Incident File\n\n\n\n\nOPEN\u00a021/02/09\u00a0INCIDENT\u00a0FILE\u00a0(LEVEL\u00a05\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED)\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/02/09 INCIDENT\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n 27 Foundation Researchers, Dr. Frederick Orwell\n\n\nIncident Location:\n Site-32\n\n\nIncident Date:\n 21 Feburary 2009\n\n\nIncident Summary:\n\n\nDr. Orwell, a head researcher at Site-32 and a researcher in charge of SCP-4635, accessed Locker-348 and took out SCP-4635 without informing the other researchers.\n\n\nOrwell then proceeded to play SCP-4635 and transmit its audio over the PA system in Site-32. 27 Foundation researchers who were unaware of SCP-4635-1\u2019s effects were affected by them.\n\n\nFollowing that action, Orwell retreated back to his room. When MTF Alpha-7 operatives stormed his room approximately one hour later, he was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his head. Orwell was pronounced dead on the scene.\n\n\nA note, presumably written by Orwell himself, was recovered next to his body. The contents of the note are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWe have sinned in the presence of our lord, and we must pay for it.\n\n\nWe must punish ourselves to rid ourselves of our sins.\n\n\nPraise be to Asuzak.\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation is currently underway into investigating Dr. Orwell\u2019s bizarre behaviour and, if possible, the rationale behind his actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4635-4:\n \n21/02/09 Investigation File\n\n\n\n\nOPEN\u00a021/02/09\u00a0INVESTIGATION\u00a0FILE\u00a0(LEVEL\u00a05\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED)\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/02/09 INVESTIGATION\n\n\nInvestigating Personnel:\n Dr. Martens, 10 MTF Alpha-7 Operatives\n\n\nInvestigation Objectives:\n To uncover the cause behind Dr. Orwell\u2019s actions and/or to uncover the origin of SCP-4635.\n\n\nInvestigation Status:\n Closed\n\n\nInvestigation Summary:\n\n\n02/04/09:\n Dr. Orwell found to have visited the United Kingdom a few weeks prior to the incident.

        "My brothers and sisters, I have spoken with our God Asuzak, and he has shown me the way to ascension. I shall detail what he has taught me, and this will henceforth be our aims. According to the words spoken by Asuzak, our lord, the language of English is a tool used by the great demon known as Qrtiyu to spread wrongdoing and sin among the people. To stop the spread of sin, Asuzak has commanded us to create a device capable of getting rid of Qrtiyu's tool. Once finished, Asuzak has commanded that we spread it among the people to erase their sins and weaken Qrtiyu. Once everyone has been cleansed of their sin, Asuzak has commanded that we use the device on ourselves to finish the ceremony and destroy Qrtiyu once and for all. After the ceremony is complete, Asuzak will permit us to rise, and we will rule alongside him for a better future of humanity. We must band together as one as the ceremony begins. We will send our messengers. We will create more devices. Together, we will stop Qrtiyu. Praise be to Asuzak. - Church of the First Language",
