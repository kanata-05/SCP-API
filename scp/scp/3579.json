Any website hosting digital instances of SCP-3579-1 are to be remotely changed as to not feature SCP-3579-1. All calls to SCP-3579 are to be traced and ended if possible. Research of SCP-3579 is only to be conducted by Level 2 staff using a cell phone with the phone number of SCP-3579 on speed-dial, kept in storeroom 24 of Site-15.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3579 is a telephone operated service running under the name \u201cInsta-Gator\u201d, using the telephone number 1-800-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. At random intervals, advertisements featuring SCP-3579 will appear in major cities. These are identified as SCP-3579-1. Instances of SCP-3579-1 will feature the phone number associated with SCP-3579 and the tag line: \"\nNeed some help with a troublemaker? Wish you could just eliminate 'er? We'll be your problem solving crusader. Just call us at Insta-Gator!\n\"\n\n\nWhen the number associated with SCP-3579 is called, a pre-recorded voice asks the caller to name a destination. When a valid destination is spoken into the phone, the pre-recorded message asks them to press a number on their phone to select an amount of alligators and a special request for an extra fee. When a number from one through nine is pressed, a corresponding amount of fully grown, live American alligators (\nAlligator mississippiensis\n), identified as SCP-3579-2 will enter the specified area through any body of water within 10\u00a0m of identified location, and attempt to fulfill the request. If no water is within the 10\u00a0m radius, a small puddle which expands to accommodate the amount of alligators will form. If nothing is requested, instances of SCP-3579-2 will remain hostile. After 10 minutes, any instance of SCP-3579-2 currently not in the water will attempt to return to the body of water, into which they will dematerialize. If the body of water was created by SCP-3579, it will dissipate into water vapour.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-3579-2 display various anomalies compared to regular American alligators. Instances of SCP-3579-2 are always male, exactly 4 metres long, and visually exact to any other instance of SCP-3579-2. If kept outside of a body of water for more that 5 minutes, instances of SCP-3579-2 will suffer myocardial infarction, causing them to cease life functions. Recent scans of the DNA of multiple instances of SCP-3579-2 concluded that each instance has identical genetic makeup.\n\n\nThe location that SCP-3579 operates from is currently unknown.\n\n\nTest Log:\n\n\n\n\nTest 3579-01\n\n\nLocation chosen:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Wetlands, Louisiana\n\n\nAmount requested:\n Six\n\n\nObjects present:\n None\n\n\nSpecial request:\n None\n\n\nPurpose:\n Initial test of the capabilities of SCP-3579\n\n\nResult:\n Six instances of SCP-3579-2 violently thrashed out of the water in a tight circle and constantly leaped and attacked the air above them for ten minutes before returning to the water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3579-02\n\n\nLocation chosen:\n Pond within Biological Research Site-104\n\n\nAmount requested:\n Two\n\n\nObjects present:\n Two Class-D personnel. D-3579-01 standing next to the pond, and D-3579-02 standing 15 metres away.\n\n\nSpecial request:\n Attack the Class-D personnel.\n\n\nPurpose:\n Test if SCP-3579 can manifest instances of SCP-3579-2 in a closed environment as well as test SCP-3579-2's hostility towards humans.\n\n\nResult:\n Two instances of SCP-3579-2 crawled out of the pond. The first immediately attacked D-3579-01, while the second chased down D-3579-02 and attacked. Both instances of SCP-3579-2 killed their respective Class-D personnel and returned to the pond after ten minutes.\n\n\nResearcher's Note:\n \nWell, that was\u2026 gruesome. Remind me to keep that number secure. Ick. -Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3579-03\n\n\nLocation chosen:\n 'Beside me' (Within a research laboratory in Site-15)\n\n\nAmount requested:\n One\n\n\nObjects present:\n A live pig.\n\n\nSpecial request:\n None\n\n\nPurpose:\n Test to see if SCP-3579-2 can manifest itself without a water source as well as its hostility towards animals.\n\n\nResult:\n A small puddle formed on the floor of the lab beside Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Despite the puddle not being deep at all, an instance of SCP-3579-2 emerged from it, with its body half submerged as it thrashed. It did not attempt to eat the pig.\n\n\nResearcher's Note:\n \nSeems these things won't actively hunt unless told to. -Dr. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3579-04\n\n\nLocation chosen:\n A bowl of water within a two-roomed research laboratory in Site-15\n\n\nAmount requested:\n Three\n\n\nObjects present:\n A remotely closed door between the two rooms.\n\n\nSpecial request:\n Enter the second room.\n\n\nPurpose:\n Test SCP-3579-2's lifespan out of water.\n\n\nResult:\n Three instances of SCP-3579-2 dove from the bowl, two of which attacked the Class-D personnel standing near the doorway and later returned into the bowl. The third instance traversed to D-3579-05 and attacked them. The doorway was locked down while the instance of SCP-3579-2 was in the room without the bowl. After five minutes of being trapped, the instance of SCP-3579-2 suffered myocardial infarction and died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 3579-05\n\n\nLocation chosen:\n Within a research laboratory in Site-15\n\n\nAmount requested:\n One\n\n\nObjects present:\n A clipboard with a research notes page placed on the ground, \nSCP-1161\n left open in a display case.\n\n\nSpecial request:\n Research \nSCP-1161\n.\n\n\nPurpose:\n See if SCP-3579-2 has non-destructive purposes.\n\n\nResult:\n A sink within the lab turned itself on, filling with water. A single instance of SCP-3579-2 climbed out, and calmly crawled towards the clipboard and SCP-1161. After being hunched over the clipboard for about 4 minutes, the instance of SCP-3579-2 climbed back into the sink.
