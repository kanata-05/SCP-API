It was a magnificent accomplishment, and I can confirm that your name has been brought up favorably in our last meeting.\n\n\nIn response to your query last we spoke \u2014 yes, we are still searching for an appropriate candidate for Director of Site-04 following Director Bray's retirement. Your name \nis\n on the list, but the Council still wishes for you to prove yourself capable a little more before we're prepared to make a final decision.\n\n\nWe'd like for you to solve the SCP-5683 problem. The assignment's already been issued.\n\n\nHoping you are well,\n\n\n\n\nO5-7\n\n\n22122592\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5683\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5683 is to be neutralized as soon as possible.\n\n\nIn order to reduce the number of containment breaches, it is to be constantly dosed with a stream of sedatives \u2014 the chemical makeup of which is to be adjusted constantly in order to prevent SCP-5683 from adapting to it. In the event that these sedatives are unsuccessful in disabling SCP-5683, the containment chamber is to be immediately flooded with hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nAll termination attempts must be approved by project head Doctor Kristiansen.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5683 is a large arachnid organism, capable of rapid regeneration and bodily modification. It is extremely hostile to all human life, and will constantly attempt to breach containment in order to engage in mass slaughter. This is usually performed via injection of venom using its mandibles and impalement using its legs.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-5683 has demonstrated the capability for basic reasoning and planning when hunting prey, it is not believed to possess human-level intelligence.\n\n\nWhen placed into a threatening situation, SCP-5683 will quickly adapt in order to become more resistant to whatever form of danger is being posed to it. These adaptations will persist until said danger is no longer present.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5683-1 (Termination Order):\n Due to frequent containment breaches and the increasing drain on Foundation resources brought about by SCP-5683's continued containment, a termination order on SCP-5683 has been issued. Termination will be overseen by the new project head, Dr. Kristiansen.\n\n\nThe following is an archive of attempts to terminate SCP-5683, along with discussions regarding them:\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Log 5683-1\n\n\nSubject of Discussion:\n Introduction of new project head, deliberation over initial termination attempts regarding SCP-5683.\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Doctor Kristiansen, Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall, Junior Researcher Silva, Security Chief Aday.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(sniffs)\n Do you smell something burning?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n I'm told there's been a mild, ah, accident at the cafeteria earlier today, sir. I apologize.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n I see, I see. \n(laughs)\n Hopefully we'll fare a little better than them, eh?\n\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Very good, sir!\n\n\nSecurity Chief Aday:\n If we could get down to business.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Right, yes, of course. So \u2014 SCP-5683. I've read the documentation, but I've always found accounts from those working with the anomaly can be much more helpful. Anything I should know?\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nResearcher Hall:\n Well \u2026 I suppose\u2026\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Well? Out with it, man.\n\n\nResearcher Miles:\n It's smarter than it looks. If it spots a way to escape, it'll take it in an instant.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Well, maybe we can use that.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Anyone else?\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(sighs)\n I won't lie, I expected more. For now, we're going to do some basic stress tests on the thing. Start off with tissue samples, then try it out on the genuine article.

Apparently, we'll just have to bear with it.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Extremely sorry for the inconvenience, sir \u2014 and in regards to the last termination test, sir, I'm afraid it, well, was expected.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \nThank you\n, Junior Researcher. I hope you didn't think I seriously believed that would work. It was a test to establish a baseline.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Yes, sir. Very good, sir.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n And lose the 'sir'.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Sorry, sir.\n\n\nSecurity Chief Aday:\n If we could get down to business.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Yes, yes, of course. I've contacted the O5 Council and requested the use of some anomalous substances to aid with termination \u2014 not anomalous enough to qualify for containment, but anomalous enough to help us out here. Probably less toxic than whatever they've got in that cafeteria, too.\n\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n\nResearcher Hall:\n Nice one.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Thank you.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Just for logging purposes, sir, may I inquire about the specific substances we're shipping in?\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Of course. Y220, Y835 and Y436. I'm told they should be arriving within the week \u2014 I expect each would be enough to do the job, but it's best to hedge our bets. This spider doesn't compare to the lizard, I'll tell you that.\n\n\n(Junior Researcher Silva smiles.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n You've worked with the lizard, sir? When was that, if you don't mind me asking, sir?\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Um, well, a few years back, I suppose \u2014 we had a containment breach back then. It \u2026 \n(frowns)\n \u2026 it wasn't pleasant.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Anyway, Y220, Y835 and Y436.

Doctor Kristiansen looks up and sniffs.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Oh Jesus, what's that smell?!\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n It must have \u2026 it must have gotten to the reactor, sir. I'm so sorry, sir \u2014 this is all my fault.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Your fault? How so? What did you do?\n\n\n(Pause. Doctor Kristiansen stands up.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \nWhat the fuck did you do?!\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n I \u2026 it's my job sir, my duty, to oppose actions that \u2014 actions that I believe are ill-advised. I didn't do that for you, sir. I'm sorry.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Yes. Yes!\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen approaches Junior Researcher Silva and jabs a finger into his chest.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Do you know how many people have \ndied\n because you couldn't do your job? Because you \nrefused\n to?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n \n(crying)\n I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir. But \u2026 you're the one, sir! You wanted to use Y910! You wouldn't listen, sir!\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(quietly)\n Are you trying to make me your scapegoat, Silva?\n\n\n(Junior Researcher Silva shakes his head.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n \n(crying)\n I'm not \u2026 I'm not, sir \u2026 but there are procedures, sir, for a \u2014 for a reason. The tissue sample \u2026 you must admit, even a little \u2014\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(quietly)\n When we get out of here, I am going to tell the Council the truth about what happened here. The truth about what you've done.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n But\u2026\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Shut your fucking mouth, Silva.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n But, sir \u2014 with all due respect \u2014 I don't think that will be possible.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n This chamber, sir \u2026 it isn't nearly strong enough to survive the reactor overloading, I'm afraid.\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen staggers backwards, head in his hands.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Shit. No, no, no no no, \nshit\n.\n\n\n(Pause. Junior Researcher Silva sits in the corner.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n I shouldn't have led us here, sir \u2014\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n No, you \nshouldn't\n have.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n \u2014 but, and this is with all due respect to your countless accomplishments, sir, you \u2026 you \nmust\n admit some personal responsibility.\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(screaming)\n \nShut the fuck up!\n Stop talking about whose fault this is! What the hell is the matter with you?!\n\n\n(Loud banging is heard against the bunker door. Doctor Kristiansen yelps and retreats to the back wall.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n No, no, no! Please! \nPlease!\n\n\n(Junior Researcher Silva stands in front of Doctor Kristiansen. The bunker door is ripped open, revealing SCP-5683 standing behind it. It moves inside, screeching.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Sir, I'll \u2014 I'll occupy it! Please, run!\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen pushes Junior Researcher Silva towards SCP-5683 and prepares to run.)\n\n\n(SCP-5683 disappears.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n I \u2014 I \u2014 wha\u2026?\n\n\n(Junior Researcher Silva turns towards Doctor Kristiansen.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Disappointing, sir. Extremely disappointing.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \nWhat?\n\n\n(Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall and Security Chief Aday enter the bunker through the torn-open door. Doctor Kristiansen again approaches the back wall.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n What's going on? What happened to 5683?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n I'm afraid, sir, that there's little reason in keeping a dummy around once it's served its purpose.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n Its \u2026 its purpose? What are you \ntalking\n about, man?!\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n As a substitute, sir.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n I don't\u2026\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n You mentioned you worked with a lizard, sir. That there was a containment breach. If you don't terribly mind me asking, how did you escape that situation? It seemed quite lethal, didn't it?\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \u2026where am I?\n\n\nResearcher Hall:\n Don't ask pointless questions.\n\n\nResearcher Miles:\n Don't ask questions you know the answer to.\n\n\n(Pause. Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(hoarse)\n Who are you people?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n We are the Jury, sir. Your Jury. And I'm afraid you've disgraced yourself quite horribly once again.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Would you like me to clarify anything for you, sir?\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \n(quietly)\n How long have I been here?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n A considerable amount of time, sir.\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n How much \u2026 how much \nlonger\n will I be here?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Until you take responsibility, sir.\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen moves into the corner, shaking.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n This is \u2026 this is my fault.\n\n\nResearcher Miles:\n You say it, but you don't mean it.\n\n\nResearcher Hall:\n You don't mean the things you say.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \nPlease. I'm sorry.\n\n\nSecurity Chief Aday:\n If we could get down to business.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Silva:\n Of course.\n\n\n(Pause \u2014 then Doctor Kristiansen runs for the open door. Before he can reach it, however, a black iron chain appears from around the corner and wraps itself around his throat.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n No, no, no! I'm sorry! \nI'm sorry!\n\n\n(The chain pulls Doctor Kristiansen out the door and around the corner at extremely high speeds \u2014 it proceeds to drag him out of the complex, slamming him into every wall as it passes a corner.)\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen:\n \nIt's not my fault! It's not my fault!\n\n\n(The floor and walls drop away, revealing what is behind them. There is a great deal of blood. There is a great deal of fire. There is a great deal of suffering. There is a terrible stench.)\n\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n\n(Laughter.)\n\n\n(Doctor Kristiansen starts screaming, and never really stops.)\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Received: 01/02/2020\n\n\nSubject Line:\n Again, congratulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Kristiansen,\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations again on your success with the Domesday Clock project.

Security Chief Aday: If we could get down to business. (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: I'm requisitioning Y910. (Pause.) Researcher Hall: (slowly) That's a little \u2026 Researcher Miles: Are you sure about that, sir? Doctor Kristiansen: Yes. I am absolutely sure about it. If the GOC can use it to poison gods, I think it can take care of one giant spider. Junior Researcher Silva: But, sir\u2026 (Doctor Kristiansen stands up.) Doctor Kristiansen: But nothing ! And, and another thing \u2014 we're losing the tissue test! The O5's will replace Bray soon, and I'm not going to be sitting around wasting time ! (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: (sighs) I'll \u2026 I'll take full responsibility for the decision. (Everyone in the room turns to look at Doctor Kristiansen.) Junior Researcher Silva: You will, sir? Doctor Kristiansen: Should anything go wrong, yes. Junior Researcher Silva: Very good, sir! Very good! (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: Well, uh. Get preparations underway. Researcher Hall: Of course. (Doctor Kristiansen walks to the door and leaves the room.) (Laughter.) <End Log>",

        "<Begin Log> (Doctor Kristiansen and Junior Researcher Silva run into the secure bunker. Doctor Kristiansen seals the door behind them, then slumps against the wall.) Doctor Kristiansen: (quietly) This isn't happening. This isn't happening. (Pause. Doctor Kristiansen looks up and sniffs.) Doctor Kristiansen: Oh Jesus, what's that smell?! Junior Researcher Silva: It must have \u2026 it must have gotten to the reactor, sir. I'm so sorry, sir \u2014 this is all my fault. Doctor Kristiansen: Your fault? How so? What did you do? (Pause. Doctor Kristiansen stands up.) Doctor Kristiansen: What the fuck did you do?! Junior Researcher Silva: I \u2026 it's my job sir, my duty, to oppose actions that \u2014 actions that I believe are ill-advised. I didn't do that for you, sir. I'm sorry. Doctor Kristiansen: Yes. Yes! (Doctor Kristiansen approaches Junior Researcher Silva and jabs a finger into his chest.) Doctor Kristiansen: Do you know how many people have died because you couldn't do your job? Because you refused to? Junior Researcher Silva: (crying) I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir. But \u2026 you're the one, sir! You wanted to use Y910! You wouldn't listen, sir! (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: (quietly) Are you trying to make me your scapegoat, Silva? (Junior Researcher Silva shakes his head.) Junior Researcher Silva: (crying) I'm not \u2026 I'm not, sir \u2026 but there are procedures, sir, for a \u2014 for a reason. The tissue sample \u2026 you must admit, even a little \u2014 Doctor Kristiansen: (quietly) When we get out of here, I am going to tell the Council the truth about what happened here. The truth about what you've done. Junior Researcher Silva: But\u2026 Doctor Kristiansen: Shut your fucking mouth, Silva. (Pause.) Junior Researcher Silva: But, sir \u2014 with all due respect \u2014 I don't think that will be possible. Doctor Kristiansen: What do you mean? Junior Researcher Silva: This chamber, sir \u2026 it isn't nearly strong enough to survive the reactor overloading, I'm afraid. (Doctor Kristiansen staggers backwards, head in his hands.) Doctor Kristiansen: Shit. No, no, no no no, shit . (Pause. Junior Researcher Silva sits in the corner.) Junior Researcher Silva: I shouldn't have led us here, sir \u2014 Doctor Kristiansen: No, you shouldn't have. Junior Researcher Silva: \u2014 but, and this is with all due respect to your countless accomplishments, sir, you \u2026 you must admit some personal responsibility. (Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.) Doctor Kristiansen: (screaming) Shut the fuck up! Stop talking about whose fault this is! What the hell is the matter with you?! (Loud banging is heard against the bunker door. Doctor Kristiansen yelps and retreats to the back wall.) Doctor Kristiansen: No, no, no! Please! Please! (Junior Researcher Silva stands in front of Doctor Kristiansen. The bunker door is ripped open, revealing SCP-5683 standing behind it. It moves inside, screeching.) Junior Researcher Silva: Sir, I'll \u2014 I'll occupy it! Please, run! (Pause.) (Doctor Kristiansen pushes Junior Researcher Silva towards SCP-5683 and prepares to run.) (SCP-5683 disappears.) Doctor Kristiansen: I \u2014 I \u2014 wha\u2026? (Junior Researcher Silva turns towards Doctor Kristiansen.) Junior Researcher Silva: Disappointing, sir. Extremely disappointing. Doctor Kristiansen: What? (Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall and Security Chief Aday enter the bunker through the torn-open door. Doctor Kristiansen again approaches the back wall.) Doctor Kristiansen: What's going on? What happened to 5683? Junior Researcher Silva: I'm afraid, sir, that there's little reason in keeping a dummy around once it's served its purpose. Doctor Kristiansen: Its \u2026 its purpose? What are you talking about, man?! Junior Researcher Silva: As a substitute, sir. (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: I don't\u2026 Junior Researcher Silva: You mentioned you worked with a lizard, sir. That there was a containment breach. If you don't terribly mind me asking, how did you escape that situation? It seemed quite lethal, didn't it? (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: \u2026where am I? Researcher Hall: Don't ask pointless questions. Researcher Miles: Don't ask questions you know the answer to. (Pause. Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.) Doctor Kristiansen: (hoarse) Who are you people? Junior Researcher Silva: We are the Jury, sir. Your Jury. And I'm afraid you've disgraced yourself quite horribly once again. (Pause.) Junior Researcher Silva: Would you like me to clarify anything for you, sir? Doctor Kristiansen: (quietly) How long have I been here? Junior Researcher Silva: A considerable amount of time, sir. Doctor Kristiansen: How much \u2026 how much longer will I be here? Junior Researcher Silva: Until you take responsibility, sir. (Doctor Kristiansen moves into the corner, shaking.) Doctor Kristiansen: This is \u2026 this is my fault. Researcher Miles: You say it, but you don't mean it. Researcher Hall: You don't mean the things you say. (Pause.) Doctor Kristiansen: Please. I'm sorry. Security Chief Aday: If we could get down to business. Junior Researcher Silva: Of course. (Pause \u2014 then Doctor Kristiansen runs for the open door. Before he can reach it, however, a black iron chain appears from around the corner and wraps itself around his throat.) Doctor Kristiansen: No, no, no! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! (The chain pulls Doctor Kristiansen out the door and around the corner at extremely high speeds \u2014 it proceeds to drag him out of the complex, slamming him into every wall as it passes a corner.) Doctor Kristiansen: It's not my fault! It's not my fault! (The floor and walls drop away, revealing what is behind them. There is a great deal of blood. There is a great deal of fire. There is a great deal of suffering. There is a terrible stench.) (Laughter.) (Laughter.) (Laughter.) (Doctor Kristiansen starts screaming, and never really stops.) <End Log>",
        "Message Received: 01/02/2020 Subject Line: Again, congratulations Doctor Kristiansen, Congratulations again on your success with the Domesday Clock project. It was a magnificent accomplishment, and I can confirm that your name has been brought up favorably in our last meeting. In response to your query last we spoke \u2014 yes, we are still searching for an appropriate candidate for Director of Site-04 following Director Bray's retirement. Your name is on the list, but the Council still wishes for you to prove yourself capable a little more before we're prepared to make a final decision. We'd like for you to solve the SCP-5683 problem. The assignment's already been issued. Hoping you are well, O5-7 22122593",
