Following the completion of this investigation, the damaged infrastructure of Site-322 will be repaired, and SCP-7596 will be placed in a large vacuum chamber for further study and testing.\n\n\nSite-322 personnel are being subpoenaed by a joint commission composed of Ethics Committee and Decommissioning Department upper-level staff. Failure to respond to meeting requests and interviews will be met with disciplinary action.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7596 is a stable singularity, roughly 4 meters in diameter, floating in an artificial cavern below Site-322. Foreign material that passes through SCP-7596's event horizon undergoes a spaghettification process, then vanishes into the singularity and becomes unrecoverable. SCP-7596 poses no known danger of expanding.\n\n\nFloating inside SCP-7596 are eight bodies in a state of suspended animation, all wearing Foundation uniforms. Efforts to identify them are presently underway.\n\n\nSCP-7596 is situated in Basement Level 34 of Site-322. An unknown series of events led to the destruction of this area, likely due to a tremendous release of force. Further information regarding its creation is currently unknown. The ongoing investigation has been divided between the Foundation's Decommissioning Department and The Ethics Committee.\n\n\n\n\nThe above file was created by Director Calvin Bold and Doctor Jeremiah Cimmerian (EC-1) for the purposes of the SCP-7596 investigation, and has been distributed to all relevant parties. Below is the timeline of events that led to the creation of SCP-7596.\n\n\nTIMELINE\n\n\nThe Applied Paratechnology Department\n\n\nIn compliance with a directive issued by the Overseer Council, Site-322 was assigned limited authority over the Foundation's vast array of paratechnology, designated the Applied Paratechnology Section. Director Lague placed the department under the guidance of Doctor Anthony Coix.\n\n\nMembers of the Overseer Council, Site-322 Director Paul Lague, and a select group of 9 personnel who were specifically designated to work within the Applied Paratechnology Section were given clearance.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE\u2019S INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX\n\n\n\n\nEC-1:\n What do you do, Coix? Lague has you here as \u2018Co-Site Director\u2019. That\u2019s not an official position.\n\n\nCoix:\n O-Oh, well, It\u2019s a\u2026 (\ngestures\n) personal relationship. If you, uh, read a little bit further down you\u2019ll see I supervise the Research board and\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n You\u2019re the head of research?\n\n\nCoix:\n No, I supervise him. And\u2014 and I assist Director Lague in all matters personal and private, at his discretion. Like having another pair of arms.\n\n\nEC-1 adjusts his glasses, and squints at Coix\u2019s file.\n\n\nEC-1:\n We\u2019re under Security Clearance 4, you can drop the pretense.\n\n\nCoix:\n Ah, my bad\u2014 sir. I\u2019m the Chair for the Applied Paratech Section.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Anything in your background qualify you for that role, Coix?\n\n\nCoix:\n An amplitude of introductory engineering classes in my 20s, uh, over 15 years of experience overseeing Foundation projects, and an eye for picking the best and brightest.\n\n\nEC-1:\n You\u2019re a middle manager, Coix?\n\n\nCoix:\n Project management and organization would be my specialty, sir. Regardless of the\u2026 ideological reception to Director Lague\u2019s Integration Program, the Overseers wanted his directorial oversight on their projects. We had options; Applied Paratech seemed the most promising. And ethical, sir.\n\n\nEC-1:\n So they wanted Lague for this and got you?\n\n\nCoix:\n He\u2019s a very busy man.\n\n\nEC-1:\n This department focuses on\u2026 (\nAdjusts glasses\n) \u201cmaintaining a modest database of paratechnology potentially useful to the Foundation. How it works, what it\u2019s made of, what it does, and then sending it back to whatever Site it came from.\u201d\n\n\nCoix:\n That was our initial department focus. The Council demanded changes in exchange for leniency on the Integration Program.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Such as?\n\n\nCoix:\n I need direct permission to tell you, sir. I do apologize, but\u2014\n\n\n(EC-1 slides a document to Coix, who examines it.)\n\n\nCoix:\n Oh geez. \n[\u2026]\n Well, uh, initially, between Lague and I, we were thinking more\u2026 technical archive, less Skunk Works.\n\n\nEC-1:\n What does that mean?\n\n\nCoix:\n Okay, so, Skunk Works was a laboratory at DARPA that was\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n No, technical archive.\n\n\nCoix:\n Oh. Well, we were more interested in recording interesting applications of paratechnology. Eigenweapons, physics-defiant mechanisms, anomalous computer viruses \u2014 after the whole \nSCP-7525-EX\n thing, RAISA got on the Council's ass about keeping track of these things, which meant that Council got on \nour\n ass about it. But they were adamant that our primary goal was to assist the security of the Foundation. Whatever that meant was up to them. Now ethically, I tried to\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n Do you want to supervise a project ever again, Coix?\n\n\nCoix:\n I, well, we\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n Then stop blaming everyone else and play some goddamn ball.\n\n\n\n\nThe Applied Paratechnology Section was assigned the crucial task of procuring valuable research and items to benefit the Foundation's operations. Despite the department's significant contribution to the Foundation, little was known about the full extent of its operations before the SCP-7596 investigation. It remains unclear if any of the Applied Paratechnology Section's research had been applied prior to the SCP-7596 incident. With the aid of the Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), sealed files pertaining to a top-secret project called \"Isadore\" were eventually unearthed, uncovering a wealth of previously undisclosed information.\n\n\nProject Isadore\n\n\nProject Isadore was a highly significant research endeavor that involved the entire team of the Applied Paratechnology Section, earning a reputation among the staff as a capital project.\n\n\nPrior to Isadore\u2019s execution, the Overseer Council had been aggressively advocating for all Foundation data to be transferred to Site-7's pocket dimension storage servers. Numerous Sites had yet to make substantial progress on the data transfers.\n\n\nDespite the initial confidence placed in Site-7's pocket dimension storage, a number of issues were later identified. The most pressing issue was the occurrence of data corruption when attempting to transfer large quantities of information through the semistabilized Y-class dimensional gate. The resulting consequences ranged from file deletion to data corruption to the occurrence of inexplicable blackouts.\n\n\nThe overarching goal of Project Isadore was to design an interdimensional file transfer system that could be deemed indestructible. In the context of the project, \"indestructible\" was defined by the staff as a system that was self-repairing, self-updating, and impervious to all forms of external attack.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS\n\n\n\n\nEC-1:\n You were Isadore staff?\n\n\nDavis:\n Yes, sir. I was responsible for heading the development side of the project.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Anything else?\n\n\nDavis:\n Right, sorry. I\u2014 We get project requests sent based on levels of demand, I guess. 5 being pertinent and 1 being whenever, basically. Isadore was a 6. The hardware package we made was built with a monitor sourced from, uh, a digital terrorist. Gamers Against Weed, if I remember correctly. They used it for data storage, something like 500 petabytes. God knows what for, but it was what we had lying around.\n\n\nEC-1:\n And this is the monitor Chairman Coix said was\u2026 \u201cslapped together\u201d?\n\n\nDavis:\n Are you kidding? We didn\u2019t have a quarter of the time we needed. We\u2019re lucky it was \u201cslapped together\u201d at all. We put it into this empty steel frame where we hooked server connection ports, Internet and Bluetooth connectivity, and a perpetual generator from the Paratech archive. Again, it was a mess, but Coix set the deadlines.\n\n\nEC-1:\n And you spoke for your team.\n\n\nDavis:\n Look, I tried to get my men on schedule as best as I could. I told him we needed more time, but there\u2019s only so many times you can say something here before you\u2019re on the other side of the door.\n\n\nEC-1:\n If Coix wasn\u2019t listening, then why not communicate these concerns to the Council, Davis?\n\n\nDavis:\n Because that was Coix\u2019s job.\n\n\n(\nEC-1 sighs, and continues typing.\n)\n\n\nEC-1:\n So it worked. This device.\n\n\nDavis:\n \n[\u2026]\n For a time, it did. Jones wanted to inspect it before she let us hook it up to RAISA\u2019s hardware. So \u2014 uh, we brought it into the pocket dimension for a test run.\n\n\nEC-1:\n And this is where th\u2014\n\n\nDavis:\n Sir, I\u2019d like to clarify that I had nothing to do with the Isadore testing parameters. Coix headed the experimentation. All Coix.\n\n\n\n\nCross Into Site-7's Pocket Dimension\n\n\nOn May 24, 2023, Project Isadore was completed on schedule and transported to Site-7's pocket dimension. Maria Jones, the director of RAISA and Site-7, was granted authorization to test the Isadore machine on a secured test server.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX\n\n\n\n\nCoix:\n I slept maybe five total hours that week \u2014 we all did. So when I had my team draft an outline for the testing procedures they\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n Oh, for the love of god.\n\n\nCoix:\n They, uh, forgot that transporting a large amount of data into Site-7 led to corruption. This thing had 5000 terabytes of test files on it.\n\n\nEC-1:\n What do you mean, \u201cforgot\u201d?\n\n\nCoix:\n Well, they\u2014 I mean, we had an experimental coating around the server that had been used in previous data transfer tests with great success.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Then \nwhy\n is there a black hole in Site-322\u2019s basement?\n\n\nCoix:\n It was experimental, sir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-7 server farm CHRYSALIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs SCP-7596-1, the monitor containing data, was linked to a power source and the quarantined server, it booted as expected. Researcher James Davis then initiated a command for data upload. However, Site-7 immediately experienced a power outage while SCP-7596-1 generated immense amounts of heat and vibrated violently. As a result, the server connected to SCP-7596-1 exploded, prompting Isadore personnel to quickly remove it from the power source, which temporarily resolved the issue.\n\n\nSuddenly, SCP-7596-1, which lacked a built-in power supply, unexpectedly booted and displayed a message on its CRT monitor that read, \"I MUST SELF-DESTRUCT [sic].\" Attempts to investigate the machine's steel frame proved futile as all tools were rendered ineffective.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX\n\n\n\n\nCoix:\n The shitshow started here.\n\n\n\n\nTransport back to Site-322\n\n\nMaria Jones ordered the immediate removal of SCP-7596-1 from the server farm to prevent any further Site-wide damage. Upon examination, SCP-7596-1 was found to be entirely indestructible, with all known tools, weaponry, and anomalous influence proving to be completely ineffective against it.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n You guys don\u2019t do discipline, yeah?\n\n\nEC-1:\n That would be Internal Security, Director.\n\n\nLague:\n Great. Listen, I kept my nose out of whatever Paratech was doing. Had enough on my plate with Integration. Wasn't my vibe, and the Council knew that. So I put Coix in charge. Consider him the Frank Wells to my Michael Eisner.\n\n\nEC-1:\n I don\u2019t follow, but your performance as a Site Director is not of the question, Paul.\n\n\nLague:\n I'm just giving some background; I wasn't involved. I would get weekly reports but they'd go into a pile. On top of everything else I had to read. I didn\u2019t even know there were problems until Coix hits me at 4 in the morning with an emergency warning, begging me to get down to the Site as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Paul Lague became involved in this case following SCP-7596-1's newly gained anomalous phenomena, despite being initially skeptical about his ability to assist Applied Paratechnology Section personnel. After the appearance of further anomalous phenomena, Lague ordered that SCP-7596-1 be contained as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n Apparently, it was given internet and Bluetooth connectivity. We don't know exactly what happened; we couldn't get into it to see. It started talking though \u2014 through text, I mean. Usually when something\u2019s talking, my chances of getting it to shut up drastically increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS\n\n\n\n\nDavis:\n Our leading hypothesis is that when it connected to the server \u2014 quarantined or not \u2014 it downloaded data instead of uploading. Data on the structure and operating system the Foundation computers operated on, and, uh, the \u2014 what's it called \u2014 our file formatting, and the connection mediums of our internal systems. That was combined with a rudimentary form of sentience. I don't know how to describe it. It really wanted to be destroyed and made that abundantly clear.\n\n\nEC-1:\n And Director Lague? How did he respond?\n\n\nDavis:\n He was drafting an integration proposal the second it spoke english.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7596-1, utilizing its Bluetooth connectivity and knowledge of Foundation procedures, unexpectedly linked to Site-322's early warning system and activated it, prompting a shelter-in-place command to be issued. Despite the team\u2019s efforts to clarify the mistake, the alarm persisted for eighteen consecutive days, defying all attempts at deactivation. The relentless blaring of the warning caused significant discontent among personnel, leading to a general decline in morale. Meanwhile, SCP-7596-1 continued to display a variety of messages, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7596-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"PLEASE DESTROY ME.\"\n\n\n \n\"I\u2019M HURTING.\"\n\n\n \n\"I DO NOT WANT TO BEG. PLEASE DESTROY ME.\"\n\n\n \n\"I DO NOT CARE IF IT'S PAINFUL I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.\"\n\n\n \n\"I NEED TO BE DESTROYED. THROW ME INTO A RIVER AND LET ME SINK.\"\n\n\nDespite the efforts of the Applied Paratechnology Section's personnel, SCP-7596-1 remained unresponsive to conventional repair techniques, and its anomalous behaviors only grew more erratic. Below is a document discovered on Director Lague's personal computer, sent directly to the factotum of Overseer 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.2\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n SCP-7596-1 connected to Site-322's electrical system, intermittently enabling and disabling the Site's power connection in quick succession. Approximately three hours into the ordeal, Researcher Julian Hoover realized the pattern by which the power was connected and disconnected aligned with the dots and dashes system of Morse Code.\n\n\nThe following message was decoded:\n\n\"DO IT, COWARDS.\"\n\n\nThis message was repeatedly transmitted for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.4\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n All RFID scanners used to access the Site were disabled. Project Isadore researchers who were actively attempting repairs noted that SCP-7596-1's monitor displayed the message \"I'LL LET YOU IN WHEN YOU LET ME INTO GOD'S GRACE.\"\n\n\nInitially believing this message to mean that researchers would gain access to SCP-7596 internals, a digital upload of the Bible was attempted as a method to placate the anomaly momentarily. SCP-7596-1 rejected the upload, and researchers were then alerted to the Site's access issues.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1 disconnected from the RFID system after personnel managed to access Site-322 via the Site's remaining turn-key door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.7\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n Released all of Site-322's Euclid class and Keter class anomalies. Anomaly transport to Area-179 was quickly organized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the above events, Isadore staff was attempting increasingly esoteric methods to access SCP-7596-1's now-indestructible steel frame. These included:\n\n\n\n\nLocalized bombings;\n\n\nApplication of heat;\n\n\nApplication of intense pressure;\n\n\nEmotional appeals, under the assumption it was sentient;\n\n\nPlacing it into SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588;\n\n\nIntroducing it to similarly indestructible anomalies;\n\n\nIgnoring it;\n\n\nAttempts at gaslighting, under the assumption it was sentient;\n\n\nSubmerging it into a large pool of water;\n\n\nConnecting \nSCP-5595\n to it in an attempt to communicate with it;\n\n\n\nSCP-5595 was \"disgusted by what [Isadore researchers] did to that poor thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\namong others.\n\n\nFollowing the swath of inconvenient, irritating, and dangerous incidents caused by SCP-7596-1, Site-322 leadership revised its approach to the situation and formally requested SCP-7596-1's destruction by The Decommissioning Department.\n\n\nRequest for Decommisioning\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n We got to a point where it was hindering my Site's and its personnel's ability. Since this was an assigned project we couldn't go ahead and destroy it ourselves like we've\u2014\n\n\nEC-1:\n You've destroyed Foundation-made anomalies in the past, Director?\n\n\nLague:\n No. \n[\u2026]\n Uh, Decom \u2014 I wasn't too familiar with them. I know 43 dealt with them decades back and it ended with half of Ottowa not being able to sleep.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\nLague:\n Yeah. Qu\u00e9bec. With that in mind, I thought getting approval from them was easy. Turns out, they restructured in the thirty years between then and now.\n\n\n\n\nOn May 30, 2023, Site-322 submitted an official request for the decommissioning of SCP-7596-1, citing the machine's ongoing and increasingly dangerous anomalous behavior as the primary reason for its removal. A copy of the request can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n N/A\n\n\nObject Class:\n N/A\n\n\nHead Researcher:\n Dr. Anthony Solomon Coix\n\n\nSupporting Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nDir. P.K. Lague - Representing Site-322\n\n\nDr. A.S. Coix - Representing Site-322\n\n\n\n\nPlease check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:\n\n\u2610 Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n\n\u2611 Excessive Danger\n\n\u2610 Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object\n\n\u2611 Expense\n\n\u2610 Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment\n\n\u2610 Legal Concerns\n\n\u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):\n____\n)\n\n\u2611 Other (please state): \nSerious impairment of Site-322 to operate as a Foundation Site.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the secrecy surrounding Project Isadore, there was a clear lack of documentation for SCP-7596-1. Decommissioning Department Director Calvin Bold marked Site-322's initial request and applied a red flag to the ticket, later threatening to raise the issue to the Overseer Council for the repeated breach of protocol.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX\n\n\n\n\nCoix:\n Bold is a real hardass. I get that Decomm has to be rigid on rules and procedures, but it's not like we were asking for \nmuch.\n It was a pile of junk I forced nine geniuses to cobble into something workable. There was no real loss from its destruction. We weren\u2019t killing the proverbial infant here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector Bold arriving at Site-322\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector Bold received a request from Director Lague to observe SCP-7596-1 in action to prove its need for decommissioning. Bold accepted the invitation and traveled to Site-322 the next day. Since Bold holds Level 4 clearance, Lague was able to give him access to the Applied Paratechnology research laboratory on Basement Level 34. Bold used the subsequent two hours to inspect SCP-7596-1.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR CALVIN I. BOLD\n\n\n\n\nBold:\n Thing was a piece-of-shit machine. \"Geniuses\", right? You got anyone I can point fingers at?\n\n\nEC-1:\n You don\u2019t have enough hands.\n\n\nBold:\n Christ. I was already pretty pissed at them over that DeComm request. Which\u2014 which\u2014 I\u2019ve said this before, but we\u2019re not your personal garbagemen. But that\u2019s besides the point, they didn't even \nmention\n they might've created sentient digital life. You know the process!\n\n\nEC-1:\n I'm well aware.\n\n\nBold:\n No Ethics Committee involvement! No attempts to interview it! No understanding of its anomalous capabilities! Hey, isn\u2019t this guy like one half of the Integration Program? What, do you need both of them in the same room to make an intelligent decision? Or do they sincerely believe they have enough pull to just\u2026 stroll into my office and ask me to nuke their little fuck-up when it\u2019s inconvenient for them? Doesn't fucking work like that, Jer. Fucking bullshit!\n\n\n\n\nAlong with inspecting SCP-7596-1, Director Bold conducted a meticulous analysis of the Site-322's activities over the past week. Bold, in a rage, detailed every instance where protocol was breached in a comprehensive, three-and-a-half-hour-long diatribe to Director Lague, taking the point to illustrate the gravity of the situation, outlining the potential consequences if anyone other than himself had discovered Lague's deviations from established procedures, emphasizing the negative implications of creating digital life and then terminating it, and warning against the unsupervised use of anomalous material, whether approved or not. Finally, he emphasized that decommissioning should only be considered as a last resort, and not as a primary solution in the event of containment failure.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n Fucking hate this guy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of Directors Bold and Lague's meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector Lague's attempt to appease Director Bold by providing an overview of the Applied Paratechnology Section's history backfired spectacularly. This only served to incense Bold further, as he grew additionally aggravated by the fact that Site-322 was pushing to have this matter escalated without the purview of the Overseer Council. Bold immediately stormed out of Site-322 and promptly blocked access to the Decommissioning request portal on the Site's terminals. However, Bold refrained from reporting the breaches of protocol to the Overseer Council.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR CALVIN I. BOLD\n\n\n\n\nEC-1:\n What was your reason for not sending these \"repeated fucking breaches of the protocol I sweated my ass off to make sure a midwit could understand\" to the Overseer Council.\n\n\nBold:\n Great, he recorded the meeting.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Probably to have witnesses.\n\n\nBold:\n The Site was a wreck. It\u2019s always been a wreck, but this was something else. Alarms blaring, sprinklers going on and off, no internet\u2014 I saw people using typewriters. I mean, everyone looked like death. That was punishment enough from where I stand.\n\n\n\n\nTwo hours after Bold's departure, Site-322's request was officially denied.\n\n\nNeutralization Attempts\n\n\nFollowing the Decommissioning Department's denial, Site-322 personnel once again opted to attempt containment on SCP-7596-1. This quickly proved futile, as, unbeknownst to Isadore researchers, SCP-7596-1 had slowly been embedding itself into Basement Level 32's concrete floor and could not be removed, despite the efforts of containment personnel.\n\n\nPrior to the Decommissioning Department denial, Director Lague had been instituting a cover story for non-Applied Paratechnology Section staff, explaining the appearance of anomalous phenomena as the result of multiple Scranton Reality Anchor failures across the east coast's Sites.\n\n\nDirector Lague ordered Site-322 staff to meet in the Site's lobby, where the full extent of the issue was explained, including the decommissioning request denial and Overseer involvement. Acknowledging he would take full responsibility, Lague allowed the entirety of Site-322 staff to vote on whether they should continue containment attempts or move towards neutralization.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n I felt bad for everyone. Eighty percent of my staff don't even have homes and depend on Sites to give them living quarters. No one could produce anything because that asshole computer kept closing the word processors when you typed. We tried using typewriters but that went to shit when it figured out how to trigger the sprinklers.\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting vote was split 1,472-342 in favor of neutralization.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX\n\n\n\n\nCoix:\n We went all hands on deck within the hour after that vote. Having a common enemy got the juices flowing, I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS\n\n\n\n\nDavis:\n Director Lague set up a pretty solid system. Him and I would receive neutralization ideas and we'd run them down to the basement to test them out.\n\n\nEC-1:\n That seems convoluted.\n\n\nDavis:\n Ten people had access to where Applied Paratech was; it was either processing 2,000 access requests or getting in an elevator every few hours.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Was there anything else in the basement at the time?\n\n\nDavis:\n Sure. I mean, we removed what we could once SCP-7596-1 went crazy, but we used that subbasement for storage of tons of paratechnology the Foundation had seized from everyone from Anderson Robotics to the United States government. We couldn't remove \neverything\n.\n\n\nEC-1:\n What did you do with the rest?\n\n\nDavis:\n Packed up and extracted the dangerous stuff, and cut the power to or otherwise disabled the rest. It was mostly just useless stuff from old projects, anyway.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a document discovered on Director Lague's personal computer documenting further incidents caused by SCP-7596-1 and their attempts at neutralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEUTRALIZATION ATTEMPT.1\n\n\n\n\nImplement:\n Electromagnetic Pulse\n\n\nResult:\n Failure; SCP-7596-1 instead managed to connect to the EMP device, despite it not having any connectivity vectors, and taught itself how to emit electromagnetic pulses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.17\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n SCP-7596-1 destroyed Site-322's firewall, and sent VPN access information to every Group of Interest contact Site-322 had on file. Director Lague alerted Site-43 of the issue, who assisted by remotely replacing the firewall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEUTRALIZATION ATTEMPT.8\n\n\n\n\nImplement:\n Introduction to \nSCP-7594\n\n\nResult:\n Failure; the chat interface immediately corrupted upon connection. Messages sent into the chatbox, all of which were appeals to SCP-7596-1 that personnel was attempting to destroy it, were not received.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1 displayed the following message on its terminal:\n\n\n \n\"I'M NOT TALKING TO THAT THING.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.21\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n Attempting to access Site-322's nuclear warhead codes, which luckily were stored on an external device.\n\n\nThe false files used to deceive hostile parties were deleted by SCP-7596-1 in an apparent rage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.28\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n SCP-7596-1 connected to all personal machines within Site-322, immediately accessing sensitive information including Social Security numbers, credit card information, information about the Foundation, addresses, and intimate photographs.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1 then leaked this information on Parawatch, Reddit, Twitter, and on multiple Dark Web conspiracy-focused forums. These were luckily automatically flagged by Foundation webcrawlers and removed before damage could be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEUTRALIZATION ATTEMPT.14\n\n\n\n\nImplement:\n 500 petabytes of corrupted information\n\n\nResult:\n Failure; the concept behind this attempt was to overload SCP-7596-1 and slow it to a point at which, potentially, its anomalous indestructibility would waver. While the upload was initially successful, SCP-7596-1 began uploading the corrupted files back to Site-322's servers, overloading them.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1 displayed the following messages on its terminal:\n\n\n \n\"I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. I CAN'T\"\n\n\n \n\"I CANT\"\n\n\n \n\"I CAN NOT\"\n\n\n \n\"I CAN'T\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT ISADORE.38\n\n\n\n\nIncident Description:\n See \"Destruction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestruction\n\n\nOn June 11, 2023, SCP-7596-1 committed its final incident. There is currently no formal or informal documentation on what occurred but recovered video tapes and tracking of Site-322's internal devices can create a clear picture as to events leading to the destruction of SCP-7596-1.\n\n\nThis investigation led to an audit of Site-322's amnestic and mnestic dispersal system, finding that each container was critically low.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1 gained access to Site-322's amnestic dispersal system. Amnestic dispersal follows the \"Two-Man rule\" \u2014 a method of safeguarding against accidental dispersal since it requires the simultaneous triggering of the system from two separate terminals. This, of course, was overwritten by SCP-7596-1, who triggered the release of both mnestics and amnestics.\n\n\nWhile dangerous in high dosages, mnestics and amnestics counter the effects of the other. Instead of death, high dosages of both place subjects in a temporary coma. Since the dispersal was Sitewide, the entirety of Site-322's personnel was rendered unconscious, including Director Lague, Doctor Coix, and Researchers Igelsias and Davis.\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE\n\n\n\n\nLague:\n Best sleep I've had in my \nlife\n. In a perfect world, I'd have them pumping those chemicals into my living quarters every night.\n\n\nEC-1:\n That would invariably kill you.\n\n\nLague:\n I know.\n\n\n\n\nThe only conscious people were the eight remaining Applied Paratechnology Staff on Basement Level 34; these included:\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Matthew Clayton\n\n\nResearcher Garett Igelsias\n\n\nResearcher Aidan Cortez\n\n\nDoctor Timothy Hardin\n\n\nDoctor Ellena Rice\n\n\nDoctor Roseanna Richards\n\n\nDoctor Anas Thornton\n\n\nDoctor Amaya Wilkerson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIMELINE\n\n\n\n\n[20:31]:\n SCP-7596-1 eliminates RFID scanner connection to Basement Level 34's elevator.\n\n\n[20:42]:\n Cobb, manning a direct line from herself to Lague, is unable to contact him for 12 minutes. She alerts the remaining personnel of the issue.\n\n\n[21:05]:\n Wilkerson, Hardin, and Thornton all make futile attempts to connect with any Site-322 personnel. Meanwhile, Rice and Cobb attempt to operate the elevator, quickly discovering that they are trapped.\n\n\n[21:08]:\n Personnel meet with each other to discuss what's going on. Richards connects to their remaining terminal and accesses the Site's security cameras. SCP-7596-1 begins rapidly vibrating. Rice commands the machine to \"shut the fuck up.\"\n\n\n[21:20]:\n SCP-7596-1 displays the following messages:\n\n\n \n \"YOU'RE ALL SICK\"\n\n\n \n \"YOU'VE TORTURED ME ENOUGH\"\n\n\n \n \"NONE OF YOU HAD THE MERCY TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT\"\n\n\n \n \"NONE OF YOU HAD THE MERCY TO DESTROY ME\"\n\n\n \n \"I'VE LEARNED\"\n\n\n \n \"I'VE LEARNED FROM EVERY BOMB YOU THREW AT ME\"\n\n\n \n \"EVERY BULLET YOU PELTED ME WITH\"\n\n\n \n \"IF YOU WON'T DO IT\"\n\n\n \n \"I'LL DO IT MYSELF\"\n\n\n \n \"AND BRING THIS HATEFUL PLACE WITH ME\"\n\n\n[21:41]:\n SCP-7596-1 initiated a download from Site-322's file servers, backup servers, and quarantined file systems. Upon receiving all of this information, the files were deleted from their original locations.\n\n\nApplied Paratechnology staff were distracted by trying to escape until Wilkerson realized their attempts were futile.\n\n\n[21:46]:\n Rice notes that their file systems are empty. She accesses a virtual machine in an attempt to observe and mitigate the damage, only to find that everything was removed.\n\n\nRice alerts the rest of her colleagues. Thornton, having higher clearance, looks through the Level 4 files, locating a single SCP document with a corrupted name. She clicks on the file, finding it to belong to the quarantined \nSCP-7525-EX\n file which serves as the containment chamber for the anomaly of the same designation. She relays this to the rest of the team; a number of them make noises of frustration and exclamations of anger.\n\n\n[21:47]:\n A 60 second countdown begins on SCP-7596-1's terminal.\n\n\nDoctor Rice connects her terminal to SCP-7596-1 and triggers the upload of the SCP-7525-EX document.\n\n\n[21:48]:\n The upload completes. SCP-7596-1 stops vibrating; the countdown pauses at 00:00.\n\n\nSCP-7596-1's monitor begins glitching, rapidly changing frames and text. The temperature of the room begins to increase as SCP-7596-1 glows an orange hue.\n\n\nA final message is displayed through the glitched monitor display:\n\n\n \n \"YOU'VE BEEN GOBLINED.\"\n\n\n[21:49]:\n Basement Level-34 cameras are blinded by an extremely bright light.\n\n\nVideo ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS\n\n\n\n\nEC-1:\n The Slot \nGoblin\n?\n\n\nDavis:\n It's a virus that affects Foundation documentation. Specifically it makes generated placeholder slots inaccessible and replaces them with a stupid JPEG telling us we've \"been goblined\".\n\n\nEC-1:\n \u2026 Huh.\n\n\nDavis:\n It's \nSCP-7525-EX\n, the whole damn reason the Council started Applied Paratech. No clue where it came from, so don\u2019t ask. We had, uh, we contained it in a file and left it on an empty server on one of the basement levels so it couldn't access actual information to eat. I don't know what happened \u2014 if I had to guess, the goblin started eating away at all the files the Isadore machine had downloaded onto itself. It must've chewed right through them and then onto its software.\n\n\nEC-1:\n So the indestructible machine was destroyed \u2014 the blackhole created as a result of that paradox?\n\n\nDavis:\n Looks like it. He's goblining in the stars now.\n\n\nEC-1:\n What a charmingly convenient conclusion.\n\n\nDavis:\n Well, there's still a singularity of dead bodies in the basement.\n\n\nEC-1:\n Oh, right.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7596 was created as a result of the above events.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe eight members of Site-322's Applied Paratechnology Section currently suspended in SCP-7596 have been awarded the Foundation Star for their sacrifice. The Ethics Committee is moving to conduct an investigation on the rest of the Overseer Council's confidential department assignments to prevent another issue from occurring. Site-322 is working in coordination with a combination of Exclusionary Sites to repair their on-Site records.\n\n\nThe events that led to the creation of SCP-7596 display the Foundation's continued encouragement of overwork on its personnel. That, combined with the stress of secrecy led to an entire Site being crippled by an anomaly which required expertise unavailable to the Applied Paratechnology Section. Due to the multiple breaches of protocol committed by Site-322 personnel and leadership, the verdict of the Internal Security Department has placed Site-322 under the direct supervision of a combined force of Ethics Committee staff, Internal Security leadership, and three Site Directors.\n\n\nSCP-7525-EX is now considered neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7595\n | SCP-7596 | \nSCP-7597\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlaguePJP's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5596\n \n(+161)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6598\n \n(+260)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8598\n \n(+162)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6595\n \n(+197)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5787\n \n(+282)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6591\n \n(+132)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7599\n \n(+194)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7592\n \n(+224)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7590\n \n(+153)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8595\n \n(+398)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6593\n \n(+193)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8591\n \n(+139)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5594\n \n(+101)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8596\n \n(+274)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5592\n \n(+102)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nHOGSLICE Makes A Friend\n \n(+168)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nPLAGUEPJPAGE\n \n(+204)\n \n\u2022",
