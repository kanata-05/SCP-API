Level 3 authorization is required prior to any testing involving SCP-576; under no circumstances is access to SCP-576 to be granted outside of testing protocol.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-576 is a rounded glass bottle with a cork stopper, measuring approximately 6\u00a0cm in diameter at base and 8\u00a0cm in height. SCP-576 is etched with a simple design (two crisscrossed stems with leaves and flowers) and possesses no maker\u2019s marks.\n\n\nSCP-576 is filled with a clear liquid, designated SCP-576-1. Lab analysis has revealed the chemical composition of SCP-576-1 to be identical to that of a 0.0100M fructose and water solution. It is theorized that SCP-576-1 only retains its effects while within SCP-576, as samples consumed from a vessel other than SCP-576 result in no anomalous effects. It has been observed that SCP-576 appears to be capable of refilling itself, albeit slowly; the replenishing rate is estimated at approximately 2\u00a0mL per week. The process by which SCP-576 refills itself is unknown.\n\n\nConsumption of SCP-576-1 results in no immediate effects; however, when an individual sleeps after consuming SCP-576-1, they will experience vivid dreams. Dreams caused by SCP-576-1 are reported to be based on memories significant to the individual. Individuals used in SCP-576 testing report a correlation between the quantity of the fluid consumed and the relative realism of the resulting dreams.\n\n\nWhen an individual enters an SCP-576-1-affected sleep, they will pass through the natural stages of sleep (stages 1, 2, 3, and 4) and remain in a peaceful, constant state of REM sleep for a period lasting from eight to twenty hours. Attempts to awaken individuals in this state, before they awaken on their own, have proven unsuccessful. The undisturbed sleep caused by SCP-576-1 is consistent between all subjects, regardless of any pre-existing or history of sleep disorders.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-576-1:\n SCP-576 was originally recovered from the mansion of a Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was discovered dead by his household\u2019s maid. Hospital records indicate that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had been suffering from stress and malnutrition (which were attributed to overwork and financial strain) prior to his death. SCP-576 was found on Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s bedside table, next to a photo album which was determined to possess no anomalous properties. SCP-576 was noted to be a little less than 1/4 full at the time of discovery.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-576-2:\n Based on testing, a tentative correlation between dosage and length of time spent asleep has been established. Individual cases that are exceptions are currently being investigated.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-576-5193-\u2588\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Testing Log SCP-576-5193-\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n D-6312, 30-year old male.\n\n\nDosage:\n One sip (approx. 5.1\u00a0mL)\n\n\nLength of Sleep:\n 8 hours\n\n\nSubject Comments:\n \n\"I remembered all the stuff I did when I was little.

I dreamed of when we would spend time together walking through the park, just walking. Sometimes I\u2019d just sit and watch her chase birds, and never notice the time passing.
