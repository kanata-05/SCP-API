Instances are to be fed every 5-6 months and communicated with infrequently.\n\n\nWild populations of SCP-7088 are under the jurisdiction of the Cryptozoology Division, who are tasked with retrieval operations and researching the organisms within their natural surroundings. Cave systems inhabited by the genus are to be blocked from public access under the cover story of unstable topography or a cave-in. Due to SCP-7088\u2019s isolated native habitat, further containment is unnecessary.\n\n\nFurther developments regarding the SCP-7088-IMPERATOR subspecies will be available at the base of this document.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7088 is a cave-dwelling anomalous genus of amphibian located within a portion of Northern Europe, primarily Great Britain. Members of SCP-7088 resemble extremely large \nCryptobranchus alleganiensis\n1\n while, in infancy, resembling \nP. anguinus\n;\n2\n all instances possess vestigial wings in addition to leathery skin and a serpentine spinal structure. Skin pigments range from reddish-brown to earth-green depending on region and rock composition. SCP-7088\u2019s brain-to-body ratio remains the highest of all known amphibians, allowing for drastically increased mental capacity capable of recognising basic human speech.\n\n\nSCP-7088 specimens also possess a unique luminous organ protruding from their upper jaw, termed the \nOzz noetica\n by Foundation cryptobiologists. The \nOzz noetica\n is possessed only by members of the genus and is a characteristic trait of all known instances. Capable of sub-noospheric interference, the organ permits SCP-7088 to transfer speech to sentient observers if positioned correctly.\n\n\nSCP-7088 rarely surface from inhabited caverns (usually housing a group of 5-10 instances), only exiting in search of prey. SCP-7088\u2019s natural diet once consisted primarily of deer, rabbits and low-lying shrubbery though, since human inhabitation of the British Isles, has shifted heavily towards the consumption of livestock and crops. Although this poses some threat to secrecy, instances only require sustenance on average twice per year, during which time they will gorge upon all nourishment available before returning to their brood. A largely stationary lifestyle allows for long periods of time between consumption.\n\n\nWhile SCP-7088 are believed to have once been apex predators in their environments, since the adoption of more readily available food sources, instances now demonstrate a more lethargic lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fossilised remains of an SCP-7088 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory:\n\nSCP-7088 was officially recognised by the Foundation in the late 1910s, though legends of the genus have persisted since the Middle Ages. SCP-7088 is commonly referred to as the \u201cKnucker\u201d in their inhabited territories, originating from an Old English term meaning \u201cwater monster\u201d. At the time of the Middle Ages, SCP-7088 are believed to have dwelled mainly in wells or deep lakes, prompting human interactions and occasionally conflict. While it is unknown how long the genus has been present within Britain or Europe as a whole, fossilised specimens have been recorded originating from the late Cretaceous Era. SCP-7088\u2019s common ancestors, if any, remain undiscovered.\n\n\nSince the 18th Century and the onset of the industrial revolution, accounts of SCP-7088 reduced significantly, likely due to the sudden influx of hazardous waste produced by human development. This is theorised to have caused SCP-7088 to abandon their former freshwater habitats and adopt a largely subterranean lifestyle, lessening human-to-SCP-7088 encounters. Prior to the 21st Century, the only evidence available for the genus\u2019 existence was ecological DNA imprints and the rare remains of deceased instances. In the early 2000s, a group of research staff successfully located and made contact with a group of live specimens (See Addendum).\n\n\nAddendum 7088.1:\n Initial Incident\n\nOn 29/10/2008, an exchange between Troy \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an American oil tycoon and multimillionaire, and an unknown buyer was revealed to the Foundation following an unrelated investigation into Mr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2018s business activity. Following examination of the discussion and further insight into the genus\u2019 behaviour, SCP-7088 involvement has been suspected.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Business\u00a0Exchange\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Business\u00a0Exchange\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN EMAIL LOG>\n\n\nTroy \u2588.

Utilising a Bodmin-fauna counter,\n3\n it was discovered that a small pond in the centre of a feature known as Knucker Hollow connected to a lengthy cave system housing approximately a dozen instances. The following is a list of verbal communication attempts with the brood.\n4\n\n\nInterview Attempt 7088-1\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 11/10/2009\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7088-24\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Cryptozoology Specialist F.

Researcher Ozz sits on a rock directly in front of a small underwater lake that is surrounded by and containing several instances of SCP-7088. Many are resting underneath small waterfalls, unmoving, with stalagmites forming on their heads which resemble horns. A single instance emerges from the water.\n\n\nResearcher Ozz:\n Ah, hello.\n\n\nThe instance lazily rests at the water\u2019s edge.\n\n\nResearcher Ozz:\n Would you be willing to speak with me for a few minutes?\n\n\nSCP-7088-24\u2019s Ozz noetica target the researcher and begin to glow slightly.\n\n\nSCP-7088-24:\n You\u2026 here to barter?\n\n\nResearcher Ozz:\n Barter?

According to information acquired during Interview 7088-2, an SCP-7088 colony is present in the area surrounding the primary transatlantic telecommunications cable. An investigation into a link between this development and the 2008 Exchange Incident is currently underway.\n\n\nAddendum 7088.3:\n 25/07/2022 Update\n\nUpon the discovery of a knuckerhole located in Lyminster, Sussex, England, a Foundation-operated high resolution ground-penetrating radar team was utilised in order to preemptively view the cave system. It is believed that all knuckerholes follow a generalised layout and, as such, the scan remains a reference for SCP-7088 dwellings\u2019 features. The following observations were noted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible only via a small, but deep, pond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprised of a primary cavern wherein most SCP-7088 reside, generally surrounded by small waterfalls leading into a central \u201clake\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary cavern comprised of cultivated stalactites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmerged cavern used for the cultivation of oviparous\n8\n young.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA large underwater passageway off-shooting from the primary cavern\u2019s body of water that leads to a hidden chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extremely large, submerged, chamber or \u201ckeep\u201d filled with copious amounts of rare materials, coins and gemstones. In all documented cases, highly detailed recordings of this chamber display a colossal, scaled instance of SCP-7088 with exaggerated wings and limbs \u2014 large stalagmites on its parietal bone resemble spiring decorative horns. The instance remains dormant, seemingly in slumber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempts are being made to extract and study a member of the \nProteus draconis imperator\n subspecies in order to assess their dormancy patterns. It is believed that, in time, connections to folkloric tales regarding dragon-like megafauna may be made in addition to predicting future active periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALERT: SCP-7088 REPAYMENT OVERDUE, IMPERATOR SPECIMEN RISING.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMAKE TRADE OFFER?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
