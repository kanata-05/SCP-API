Following Incident-6324, the track is to be surrounded by a reinforced wall capable of withstanding an impact from SCP-6324. SCP-6324 has been equipped with a GPS tracker and internal cameras so that it may be located in the event that it is taken from Site-37.\n\n\nIndividuals affected by SCP-6324-1 are to be given standard evaluation for mind-affecting anomalies. However, since SCP-6324-1 is a particularly subtle anomaly, no amnesticization is required.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6324 is a 1987 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand station wagon. It has continued functioning since its creation seemingly without repair, despite natural erosion. Any individual parts of SCP-6324 may break or wear down, but none of these ultimately impair its ability to function.\n\n\nWhenever two individuals are within SCP-6324 and it is driven for over thirty minutes, an instance of SCP-6324-1 begins. During an SCP-6324-1 instance, SCP-6324 displays driving capabilities far beyond the usual of any other similar model of vehicle. These abilities include: increased acceleration and braking power, the ability to make impossibly sharp turns, and increased durability to the point of near indestructibility.\n\n\nIndividuals inside of SCP-6324 during an SCP-6324-1 instance will tend to show certain changes to their personalities. Including, but not limited to: poor impulse control, a strong desire to seek out new experiences, and an increase to any existing behavioral differences between them. Most of these effects end once the SCP-6324-1 event completes. The one exception being an increased bond between the affected individuals. This connection occurs despite any existing animosity they may have had. The two will begin to address each other as if they are close friends. Even when informed of SCP-6324\u2019s nature, they will be unable to identify the relationship as anomalous, instead attributing it to having a significant shared experience during SCP-6324-1.\n\n\nIncident-6324:\n On 25/06/2019, a test of SCP-6324 was conducted using D-927491 and D-391848. Due to a containment breach, the test was abandoned and most personnel were called away. However, after D-391848 was taken inside, D-927491 used this as an opportunity to escape, kidnapping Researcher Franklin White as a hostage and stealing the equipment from a nearby guard. The following are audio and video logs from the cameras inside SCP-6324.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log-6324-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I spy with my little eye, something that starts with the letter\u2026 R.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Road.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Yep!

What, like dirt?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n No, nothing like dirt.\n\n\nD-927491:\n What else is there? Whatever, I don\u2019t really care. Stop looking at me like that!

Why?\n\n\nD-927491:\n You think I like being called this? It\u2019s a stupid letter and number. I didn\u2019t get a choice in any of this.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Did you have a choice in your other name?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Not the point and you know it.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Fine, what should I call you?\n\n\nD-927491:\n My name\u2019s Abigail\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Okay.

Do you seriously have no better plan? You realize that we\u2019ll have to stop eventually, right?\n\n\nD-927491:\n I\u2019ve got a plan. I know a guy. Good at smuggling and owes me a favor. If anyone can keep us away from the Foundation, it\u2019s him.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Clever. So what\u2019s the guys name? Two-Toes Tommy? Jimmy the Weasel? Maybe it\u2019s something short, like \u201cSpike\u201d. I like Spike.\n\n\nD-927491:\n His name\u2019s Edward. You watch too many movies.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Well excuse me for not knowing about the criminal underworld. I guess I\u2019m not cultured enough for this.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Are you mocking me?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Maybe.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Glass houses.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n What\u2019s that supposed to mean? I\u2019m a perfectly respectable pers- Oh my god! The World\u2019s Weirdest Ball of Twine is coming up!\n\n\nD-927491:\n You\u2019re screwing with me.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n No, look at that sign.\n\n\nD-927491:\n That says, \u201cGas station: 3 miles\u201d.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Right, forgot about the antimemetic. We couldn\u2019t take down that sign, so we had to get a little creative.\n\n\nD-927491:\n So is there a gas station ahead or not?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Don\u2019t remember. We have to go, please? Please?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Have you forgotten that we\u2019re on the run?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Oh, it won\u2019t be long. And you haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen that twine. It\u2019s both there and not there, sort of prismatic, and always twitching. Just an all around drug trip.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Like you know what a drug trip feels like.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You don\u2019t know everything about me. It\u2019s that exit up there.\n\n\nD-927491:\n There\u2019s no exit.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Right. Antimemetics. Just let me take the wheel for a second.\n\n\nD-927491:\n What are you doing!\n\n\nResearcher White forcefully grabs the steering wheel and turns it sharp to the right.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Are you trying to kill us!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Stop fighting, you\u2019ll make us crash!\n\n\nSCP-6324 drives through what appears to be a solid barrier, and continues onto the concealed road leading to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u201cThe World\u2019s Weirdest Ball of Twine\u201d.\n\n\nD-927491:\n I swear this road wasn\u2019t here before.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I don\u2019t have time to explain all the anomalous science. Just enjoy it! You\u2019re one of the only people who\u2019s going to experience the best roadside attraction on Earth!\n\n\nD-927491:\n You sound like a tour guide right now.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Well, I did work at the research outpost here a while ago. So I know the ins and outs.\n\n\nSCP-6324 stops.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Research outpost?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Yeah, we were researching wherever the ball came from. I think it\u2019s a portal to another dimension.\n\n\nD-927491:\n I\u2019m not walking into a Foundation lair!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Relax, those guys are a bunch of lazy deadbeats. When I worked there, half the time was throwing things into the portal to see what would happen. The other half was making up lab reports.\n1\n Did you know that you can just redact half a paper?\n2\n No one notices!\n3\n\n\nD-927491:\n Interesting. And how do I know you aren\u2019t leading me into a trap?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You don\u2019t. But do you really want to miss this once in a lifetime experience?\n\n\nD-927491 sighs and SCP-6324 starts moving again.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Now you really sound like a tour guide.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Perfect! \n(In a tour guide voice)\n Coming up on the right, you should see the World\u2019s Weirdest Ball of Twine! And can I say, it\u2019s already a sight to behold! Only the finest unpainted brick walls.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Doesn\u2019t look much like an \u201cattraction\u201d.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Yeah, the Foundation tends to do that to places. Trust me, it\u2019s way cooler on the inside.\n\n\nD-927491:\n It better be, because I\u2019m taking a pretty big risk here.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n It\u2019ll be safe, I promise.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log-6324-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nD-927491 and Researcher White are running from the research outpost around SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u201cThe World\u2019s Weirdest Ball of Twine\u201d, chased by armed Foundation agents.\n\n\nD-927491:\n I thought it was going to be safe!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t recognize any of those guys!\n\n\nD-927491 struggles to open SCP-6324\u2019s door for a few seconds.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Hurry up hurry up hurry up\u2014\n\n\nD-927491:\n I\u2019m trying!\n\n\nThe door comes open and the two go inside. Gunshots are heard behind them.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Wow, were they even aiming?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Don\u2019t know, don\u2019t care.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I mean, they\u2019re usually such good shots\u2026\n\n\nMore gunshots. Researcher White turns around.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n \u2026They weren\u2019t aiming at us\n\n\nD-927491:\n What are you talking about?\n\n\nA large, iridescent moth is seen following SCP-6324 in close pursuit. D-927491 sees it in the rear mirror\n\n\nD-927491:\n What is that thing?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n A large, insectoid entity. Judging from the context, it\u2019s likely extradimensional. Judging from its actions, it\u2019s likely hostile.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Turn off researcher brain for one second.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Rainbow Mothra.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Great. Just great. Why is it coming after us?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I\u2019m pretty sure it came from the twine. Maybe the ball wasn\u2019t an attraction at all. Some kind of egg?\n\n\nD-927491:\n But why us? The researchers were the ones poking it with sticks!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Maybe we have something it wants.\n\n\nD-927491:\n We were in the building for three seconds! I didn\u2019t take anything, did you?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Well\u2026\n\n\nD-927491:\n You better not.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I didn\u2019t want this whole thing to be a waste.\n\n\nD-927491:\n How did you even manage that?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You know the phrase \u201cexit through the gift shop\u201d?\n\n\nThe entity lands on SCP-6324, denting the roof.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Whatever you took, you better give it back!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n We don\u2019t even really know what it\u2019s after.\n\n\nD-927491:\n What did you take?\n\n\nResearcher White pulls a small crystalline ball out of his pocket. It appears to shimmer with many different colors.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Sure seems magic. Give it back.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n But it looks so cool.\n\n\nThe entity starts to crack one of SCP-6324\u2019s windows.\n\n\nD-927491:\n That thing\u2019s leaving the car. You can choose whether or not you\u2019re going with it.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Fine.\n\n\nResearcher White throws the object out of SCP-6324, it proceeds to shatter on the road.\n\n\nD-927491:\n No.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Well, it was nice knowing you.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Can\u2019t say the same.\n\n\nThe entity screeches and lands next to the shards, picks them up, and flies away.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Huh.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Maybe it\u2019s more interested in the material than the structure.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Or maybe it\u2019s planning revenge.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Either way, let\u2019s go before it comes back.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log-6324-4\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher White:\n The gas is getting pretty low.\n\n\nD-927491:\n You don\u2019t say.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Hey, I was just trying to help.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Fine.

You don\u2019t have a wallet.\n\n\nD-927491 exits SCP-6324. Researcher White is preoccupied and doesn\u2019t notice.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You could have gotten me to pay for you, but I left my wallet in the break room, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting it back anytime soon. Maybe you could go ask for money, but that probably won\u2019t work, people around here look pretty stingy. I wonder if there\u2019s some change in the cushions\u2026\n\n\nGunshots.

Ahead is a barricade constructed by a combination of the Foundation and local law enforcement.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Oh no, they\u2019re ready for us.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Buckle up.\n\n\nD-927491 shifts gears.\n\n\nUpon hitting the barricade, SCP-6324\u2019s front wheels tilt upwards and the whole vehicle leaves the ground. The officers stare at it in disbelief as it goes over their heads before landing on the ground.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I guess this thing can fly.\n\n\n<End Log>\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log-6324-6\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Are we there yet?\n\n\nD-927491:\n What are you? Five?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Nope, just bored.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Well fine, we\u2019re almost there.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Awesome! I can finally meet Spike!\n\n\nD-927491:\n \n(Starts to pull SCP-6324 into a driveway)\n Do not call him that.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You have no power over me.\n\n\nD-927491 sighs and exits SCP-6324. A doorbell is heard. Pause. POI-740176 approaches SCP-6324.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n So you\u2019re the runaways?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n We sure are, Spike!\n\n\nD-927491:\n His name is still Edward.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Oh please, it\u2019s Spike to my friends.\n\n\nResearcher White\u2019s eyes go wide as he gasps.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Don\u2019t lie to the guy, it\u2019s too easy.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Well, names aside, what happened to you, Abigail? I heard you got the chair. And what\u2019s with this uniform you\u2019re wearing?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n She could tell you, but she\u2019d have to kill you.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n You\u2019re joking, right?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Yeah, we\u2019re not the ones who\u2019d kill you.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Well, what\u2019s another person after my life?\n\n\nD-927491:\n You\u2019re a truck driver with a secret compartment, you\u2019re not Han Solo.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Well maybe I want to be, I like a little action.\n\n\nD-927491:\n There\u2019s no talking you out of this, is there?\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n You showed up out of nowhere in a beat up station wagon, wearing a prison jumpsuit, with a guy in a lab coat. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t ask what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Fine, it\u2019s a long story. How do I even explain it?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Magic is real, I\u2019m part of an elaborate conspiracy to cover it up, she got freed from death row to be a slave/test subject. Oh yeah, and the car\u2019s magic.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Okay okay, very funny.\n\n\nD-927491:\n No, he\u2019s pretty much right.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Wait, really?\n\n\nSilence as POI-740176 starts to realize.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n So, why are you here?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Well, you see, I escaped that group, and now we\u2019re on the run.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n And you need me to hide you?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Yes.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n So how big is this conspiracy?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Global.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Probably interplanetary.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Yeah, probably\u2014 \n(to Researcher White)\n Wait, interplanetary?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Well, it\u2019s not quite in my clearance level, but I\u2019ve noticed a few things.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n I suddenly regret asking.\n\n\nD-927491:\n I tried to stop you.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n I don\u2019t regret it that much. This sounds like a pretty cool adventure.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Right?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Oh no, now there\u2019s two of you.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n So, where do we start?\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Well first you\u2019re going to need to change, because I assume those clothes are from this conspiracy organization?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Yep, and changing sounds good. This jumpsuit is about as comfortable as it looks.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I like my lab coat. Do I really have to ditch it?\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Yes. Next, you said this car\u2019s magic?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Yep, we were testing it. So there\u2019s still some equipment hooked up.\n\n\nD-927491:\n \n(Concerned)\n Equipment? Like what?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Let\u2019s see, I remember setting up cameras, microphones, a GPS tracker, and cup holders, probably a few other things too.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nD-927491:\n Wait, what?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I know, right? What kind of a car doesn\u2019t come with cup holders?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Not the cup holders! Why didn\u2019t you tell me we were being tracked!\n\n\nResearcher White:\n You never asked.\n\n\nD-927491:\n So that\u2019s how they found us?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n That, and we were followed by Rainbow Mothra.\n\n\nPOI-740176:\n Rainbow Mothra?\n\n\nD-927491:\n Don\u2019t ask. So where is this \u201cequipment\u201d?\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Oh, it\u2019s right over here. \n(To POI-740176)\n So, Rainbow Mothra is my name for this big monster that was following us\u2014\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-6324 was recovered outside the house of POI-740176 (Edward \u201cSpike\u201d Summers).
