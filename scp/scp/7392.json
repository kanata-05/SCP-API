Instances of SCP-7392, despite their appearance, do not interface with the Foundation's network and are therefore not actually usable as security apparatus.\n\n\nSCP-7392 are connected by an arbour of nerve cells, growing through any susceptible superstructure \u2014 penetrating concrete, steel, and other materials \u2014 and forming outpouches where instances of SCP-7392 will develop. The arbour supplies efferent tributaries leading from SCP-7392 to a theorised central organism or processing centre, designated SCP-7392-A. Tracing of the arbour in order to locate SCP-7392-A is currently not viable, as the nerves of colonies of SCP-7392 travel deeper into the ground than excavation and ground-penetrating radar can presently ascertain.\n\n\nAddendum 7392.1:\n Incident 7392.1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0fileserv:/S:/7392/fileserv/incident/1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt From Incident Report, 14/04/12, Site-33 (Sublevel-4b, Northwest Wing):\n\n\nSummary:\n During routine architectural audit, a core sample of concrete was extracted from the North wall of a utility closet in Sublevel-4b. Several litres of foetid organic effluent were released from a cavity within the wall. Laboratory analysis indicates that the fluid is an acidic suspension of fats, sugars, and proteins, as well as enzymes for their breakdown. The conclusion of the Department of Biochemistry is that the fluid is a digestive excretion.\n\n\nPartially dissolved body parts were discovered within the cavity. Proteomic and genetic analysis of recovered solids revealed the presence of human skin, muscle, and blood, alongside non-human bones and mesodermal tissues. All parts, despite differences in their genetic provenance, were able to be reassembled into a single partially digested human\n3\n body.\n\n\nDental records are consistent with Technician Deja-Reve, who could not be located following the incident; work records indicate that Deja-Reve had not been seen in several days. This was not noticed due to him being alienated from his peers at the time. Former acquaintances, when interviewed, reported that he had undergone a noticeable personality shift several weeks prior.\n\n\nShortly after the cavity's contents were evacuated, the digestive organ began to mineralise, replacing its entire volume with a porous, concrete-like substance within several hours. Instances of SCP-7392 throughout Site-33 were noted to exhibit higher levels of activity and growth than were typical for a number of days afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7392.2:\n Revised Documentation\n\n\n\u2014 LEVEL 4 RESTRICTED \u2014\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. While it is impossible to know whether colonies of SCP-7392 have been fully uprooted, removing disruptive or highly visible outgrowths may help to maintain the aesthetics of a property.\n\n\n2\n. Most commonly closed-circuit television cameras, though motion sensors, temperature gauges, and proprietary monitoring devices developed by the Foundation have also been observed to be instances of SCP-7392.\n\n\n3\n.
