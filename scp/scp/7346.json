Changes to this particular documentation (if any) will be identified by revision code(s) and accurately transcribed later within this manual (see \nIndex 7.4: SCP-7346 Revision History\n). With written consent from the acting HCML Supervising Lead, this documentation will also act as a substitute for traditional Secure, Contain, and Protect anomalous procedure document(s), due to its innate descriptions and established containment of paranormal technologies used throughout the entirety of SCP-7346.\n\n\n2 | OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n2.1 | General Chronometric Analysis\n\n\nAll chronometric procedures are centralized under the SynCheck Integrated Program within SCP-7346. 200 caesium-133 standard clocks installed throughout SCP-7346 and offsite locations provide a long-lived reference frame in the event of temporal distortion around SCP-7346. Offsite clocks include auxiliary nuclear batteries, permitting uninterrupted operation without maintenance for up to 28,000 years via carbon-14 graphite block sources.\n\n\nIn the event of catastrophic or advanced temporal distortion, or the failure of all offsite atomic clocks, further chronometric studies may be conducted via equipment, apparatuses, and drones within SCP-7346. See \nIndex 12.2: RetCon-Applicable TK-Class Events and Subevents\n for more information. It is recommended that at least 3 chronometric studies be conducted for a comprehensive analysis of contemporary chronology. The recommended priority for these studies is:\n\n\n\n\nGeneral geochronometry, radiochronometry\n\n\nAstronomical records\n\n\nDendrochronology\n\n\nAncillary operations and processes\n\n\n\n\nFor a detailed summary of radiochronometric procedures, refer to \nIndex 22.1: Overview of Rutherford Nuclear Forensics Procedures\n.\n\n\nFor a detailed summary of ice core processing and analysis, refer to \nIndex 22.4: Ancillary Operations, Drygalski Processes\n.\n\n\nFor a detailed summary of dendrochronological procedures, refer to \nIndex 26.2: Dendrochronological Procedures, Mendel to Theophrastus\n.

[\u2026] External data warehouses are to be interspersed between the AMBIT TERRA and the PRIME INDEX simulation layers to ensure access to maintenance artificial constructs and system administrators, even in the event of reality destabilization.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n3.2 | Recovering Critical Information\n\n\nRecovery of critical assets, including physical equipment, SCP-7346 documentation, assisting records, and/or other confidential datasets are to be handled through the assigned data custodian(s). Personnel dedicated to data custody are to be at the discretion of the CISO and upper O5 representatives. [\u2026]\n\n\nIn the event that no data custodian may be applicable (see \nEmerging Response INT-12AB\n), data management and retention will be redirected to PRIME INDEX storage meta-silos, specifically within clusters 14BC-104GE. Root pathways are to be decided automatically through critical \nSIMULACRUM\n algorithmic access functions to ensure proper management and availability of data in the event of catastrophe.\n\n\nTo access more information related to data retention policies and storage limitations, please refer to \nSystem Beta Datanomics, Page 15, Section L-N.\n\n\n3.3 | Security Access And Roles\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nSecurity access will be granted through system roles dictated by \nSIMULACRUM\n data-crawlers. Priority will be given to executive and VIP system roles, followed by network users, local administrators, and then slaved artificial sapient advanced intelligences (SASAIs) or .AIC avatars. These priorities will not apply to dedicated system agents responsible for contingency operations in the event of catastrophe (currently \nJericho.aic\n), who will be granted elevated clearance to all documents pertaining to its role. This can be rescinded in the event of executive denial or the absence of an emergency authorization form, which requires the written approval of acting CISO and sub-officers.\n\n\n4 | RECOVERY CONTINGENCIES AND PRIORITES\n\n\n4.1 | Recovery/Restoration Planning\n\n\nTo ensure total system functionality in the event of cataclysmic system collapse or unrecoverable reality destabilization, multiple contingency plans have been logged and recorded within the PRIME INDEX multiversal database, encrypted via ontokinetic cyberanomalous phenomenon to ensure protection against external threats. Said plans have been made accessible to the necessary agents under a procedurally generated pre-shared hashing operation, authenticated via machine MAC sub-address fields and appropriately indexed for ease of access. Said contingency plans, while not all-encompassing, does provide the executive authority necessary for automated \nSIMULACRUM\n entities to ensure progression of the upper simulation layer and all inhabiting biological lifeforms from paranormal threats.\n\n\nSIMULACRUM\n recovery agents (such as \nJericho.aic\n) are to be automatically deployed as backup operators to ensure that SCP-7346 systems are properly authorized and executed. In the event that significant changes are detected, such as altered climate conditions, persistence of foreign paranormal biological lifeforms, or other significant threats, the aforementioned agents must rectify all outstanding issues before restoration and SCP-7346 activation can be authorized. Snapshots stored within SCP-7346 are to be restored at the discretion of deployed agents as to allow them ample time to recover the natural world to conditions that were biologically sustainable before the ensuing global K-Class scenario event could occur.

Please refer below for further information.\n\n\n\n\n[\u2026] require human-adjacent qualities of the operator, with emphasis on understanding the historical and sociocultural contexts of heritage sites and accompanying significance. Such operations for the bulk of geoengineering and heritage site are considered high-level maintenance duties, and are classified as high priority [\u2026]\n\n\nA significant number of treaties, pacts, covenants, and other agreements require the participation of a human or equivalent entity in their associated operations, due to extraneous theological law outside of the bounds of traditional reality. Provisions under the \nAMBIT TERRA Finality Protocols (AFTP)\n and relevant \nCallisto Protocol\n documents have successfully reduced personnel requirements to a single, individual agent or operator.\n\n\nOperations for \"holy sites\" largely consist of the veneration of spirits, titularies, deities, divinities, and other theological or spiritual entities, and may extend to soliciting their continued blessings and patronage for selected heritage sites. Additional veneration provisions are to be carried out for the continued restfulness of deceased groups. Furthermore, all operators are expected to be physically present to carry out their tasks at their stipulated locations. To facilitate this, a biomechanical somatic frame is automatically prepared via (1) Reigen-Orion Wetware Fabricator Emulation Drive, and will have fully gestated within 20 to 25 solar years following the activation of the \nCallisto Protocol\n.\n\n\nUpon completion of this process, the operator is to transfer their neural map into the somatic frame to perform all operations requiring a physical presence. A modified drone shuttle will be prepared and maintained by \nDEM-Yellowstone\n fabrication station sites, controllable via technopathic interface, as a means of transportation during this phase.

Numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and cemetery fields are also present in the complex. Contrary to popular belief, while the Giza complex is the largest pyramid complex in AT-Egypt, it is dwarfed by the funerary complexes in the Necropolis at Unthebes (HHS 1980). [\u2026]\n\n\nHISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE:\n Constructed on the Giza Plateau in the 26th century BCE, the Giza pyramid complex remains the most recognizable landmark in AT-Egypt, having survived millennia of looting, vandalism, and aberrant meteorological events. Two separate restoration projects were carried out to restore the polished white limestone casing in 2035 and 2193. [\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo think these structures still persist in this age.

They carry a lacquer wooden box in one arm, and their other is cradled by a sling, broken. Moss and sticks crunching under their feet, they step through a crack between two colossal trees. They are greeted by a verdant grove on the other side, trees full of a wide selection of large ripe fruit. Jericho closes their eyes, and takes a moment to collect themselves.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n O, Great Mother of the Hallowed Gardens, this humble mortal greets You.\n\n\nThe trees rustle as the wind rises. A voice seemingly calls out from all around Jericho. They keep their eyes closed.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Ah, is it already time?\n\n\nJERICHO:\n Indeed. This mortal wishes to extend the covenant between Your Florescence and the masters of this mortal.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Look at you, so polite and conducted. Of course, consider it done.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n A thousand gratitudes, Your Providence.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Oh, stop that. No need for such formal language.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n As You wish.\n\n\nA light giggle is heard.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Oh dear. What happened to your arm?\n\n\nJERICHO:\n Oh this\u2014 I had an incident with some paranormal life forms approximately one month ago. A colony had taken up residence in one of the locations my journey stops by.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n You poor thing. Allow me.\n\n\nGlowing particles emerge from the grass beneath Jericho, permeating through the faux skin and shining underneath it as they slowly moved upwards. Jericho gasps, and gingerly removes their formerly broken arm from its sling.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n How did You\u2014\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n You know what my domain as a god is, and I know that you are the kind of mortal that is grown instead of born. You can figure out the rest.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n I\u2014 Thank You so much, Your Benevolence.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Oh it's quite alright. I also took the liberty to patch your cells up a bit more, should keep your vigor up for the next decade or so. It's the least I could do.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n I should mention that there have been new varieties added to the repertoire since we last spoke. Courtesy of the former Great Barrier Reef, there is a particularly captivating lily among this new bouquet\u2026\n\n\nJERICHO:\n My apologies, but what did You say?\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Ah. I see.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Pay it no mind. The terms of the covenant have not changed, yes? I maintain the flora in your gardens, and you provide me with that which was agreed upon.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n Erm, yes. That they are.\n\n\nJericho sets down the lacquer wooden box on the grass. It glows brightly for a brief moment.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Excellent. I believe that concludes our business.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n Indeed it does. Once again, thank You for your patronage, Your Grace.\n\n\nTE-R813-PMN:\n Any time, Jericho.\n\n\nAs Jericho leaves the grove and re-emerges into the forest, they open the box and inspect its contents. Whatever it once held was now replaced by a golden apple, which Jericho promptly took a bite out of, indulging in it on the way back to their shuttle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abCONNECTION TERMINATED\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow curious.

Of course.\n\nJERICHO:\n Authorizing amended protocol.\n\n\nA swarm of nanomachines emerge from the shuttle. Within seconds, they reduce the figure to dust, scattering what remained of the body into the soil around the site, and what remained of the wetware and machinery into the obelisk itself.\n\n\nJericho watches on silently as the figure disappears. They shuffle closer to the obelisk, fingers tracing over carvings of sentences in a hundred thousand languages.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n \n\"We were here. Remember us.\"\n\n\nJERICHO:\n That, I have. That, I will.\n\n\nJericho delicately sits themselves down in front of the obelisk. In ragged breaths, they cross their legs and take a look at their surroundings under the setting sun.\n\n\nIt almost seems familiar.\n\n\nJERICHO:\n It really is a beautiful garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abCONNECTION TERMINATED\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncentral.dem.yellowstone\n\n\nDEM-Yellowstone\n snapshot recorded!\n\n\nCallisto Protocol\n automatically concluded.
