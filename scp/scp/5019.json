Foundation web crawlers have been unable to suppress any mentions of SCP-5019. Administered amnestics have been shown to have no effect. Any mention of SCP-5019 is to be monitored by Foundation web crawlers. Copies should be downloaded and stored on a secure hard drive.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5019 is a nonexistent episode of the television cartoon \nLoopy Lilly\n titled \nIck Day.\n SCP-5019 is displayed as the 15th episode of the 3rd season of the show, despite there being no record of such an episode ever being aired or created. Non-affected individuals remember the episode in its true state as a canceled project (see below.) The status, contents, and description of the episode vary per affected individual.\n\n\nAccording to a Foundation web scan of all internet platforms, the release status of SCP-5019 has been remembered in the following various ways:\n\n\n\n\nThe episode had an official television release, but no saved copy exists. Rather, only official statements and plot summaries confirming its release. The consensus among those displaying this effect is that it is considered \"lost media\".\n\n\nThe episode can be found in the same manner as the rest of the series.\n\n\nThe episode was planned for release, but was canceled with only a title and number released. This is the status remembered by non-affected individuals, and is the factually true status.\n\n\nThe episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is popularly mistaken for a lost episode.\n\n\nThe episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is remembered as such, and is not mistaken for being official content.\n\n\nThe episode is only rumored to exist, with the origin of this rumor unknown.\n\n\nThe episode is rumored to exist, but is confirmed fake by an individual who worked on the show.\n\n\nThe episode does not exist in any form, not even in its true form as a canceled title.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs concluded by Foundation-run tests and interviews, those affected by SCP-5019 will view all discussion related to SCP-5019 as matching their own recollection, despite evidence to the contrary. This effect also applies to any stills or clips of SCP-5019.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe following is an abridged list of online posts containing descriptions of the contents of SCP-5019:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUser:\n \nAccompliceofneverland\n\n\nSource:\n www.tumblr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUser:\n \nFoundFormest\n\n\nSource:\n www.lostmediawiki.com\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMakes sense\n\n\nFoundFormest\n\n\n|\n\n\nPosted on August 22 at 3:20\u00a0pm\n\n\n|\n\n\n[link]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nNon-existence confirmed makes so much sense. I thought it was real for the longest time, and dude, it scared the shit out of me. I mean I heard stuff about Lilly kicking her lamb into the street, and there were pictures of the scene. So fuckin glad those are fake and fanmade. Ick Day, the episode where Lilly went of being mean and grumpy to her friends around time because she was sick and refused medicine. I'd have nightmares about that when I was little. It's a show for like 5 to 9 year olds! God I hate the internet lmao\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUser:\n \nQuestionartmark\n\n\nSource:\n www.instagram.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUser:\n \nKuestionableXontent\n\n\nSource:\n www.reddit.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThought I'd drop what I remember of the Loopy Lilly episode peeps have been discussing. Basically Lilly is out in the town with her friends and someone near them gets sick and then they're scared that they'll get sick. The spend the whole episode being super careful afraid that they'll get germs and stuff. At the end they all get sick. The episode was controversial because parents were afraid it sent a kinda mean message. It's weird that it's lost. Now I don't remember much either, that's about it.\n\n\nsubmitted 21 hours ago by\n \nKuestionableXontent\n\n\n5 comments\n \nshare\n \nsave\n \nhide\n \ngive gold\n \nreport\n \ncrosspost\n\n\n\n\n\u2b06\n\n\n18\n\n\n\u2b07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUser:\n \nQuillednevildevil\n\n\nSource:\n www.twitter.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n\n\nOn 09-08-2016, a notable user under the name of Nichola.Myerssss (dubbed PoI-5019) was found on various discussion threads of various sites discussing SCP-5019.
