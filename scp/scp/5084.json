All Foundation personnel with level 2 clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-5084 at the discretion of the site director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5084 is the collective sum of 40 cherry tomatoes (\nLycopersicon lycopersicum var. cerasiforme\n) invulnerable to decomposition. SCP-5084's anomalous capabilities manifest when an individual is made aware of the presence of SCP-5084 in their immediate vicinity. The individual will firmly believe that all instances of SCP-5084 are sentient. Individuals have experienced auditory hallucinations in which they report hearing SCP-5084 produce human-like vocalizations. Individuals describe SCP-5084 instances as \"scared, nervous, and untrusting\" due to their vocalizations being described as childlike. SCP-5084's anomalous properties do not manifest when exposed to Foundation personnel.\n1\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5084 was discovered in a hotel located in Las Vegas, Nevada. SCP-5084 was housed in a terrarium residing in the entrance of the hotel. All guests were extremely protective of SCP-5084, physically berating any individuals who harmed SCP-5084 specimens. The Foundation was contacted when nearby businesses and local residents entered the hotel and were detained by local authorities. Foundation operatives observed attempts to plant SCP-5084 instances in an effort of preserving SCP-5084 through their offspring before acquiring SCP-5084.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a05084-A:\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a02020/02/01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a05084-A:\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a02020/02/01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nForeword\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-38291\n\n\nSubject framed for murder, put on death row.\n\n\nD-38291 is instructed to make eye contact with SCP-5084 and transcribe SCP-5084's statements.
