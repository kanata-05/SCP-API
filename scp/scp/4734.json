Site-97 is to be maintained as an offshore research base\n1\n conducting geological studies on the Chicxulub Crater, with all civilian marine traffic to be directed away from the site. Local Hume levels are to be monitored and all fluctuations noted.\n\n\nA set of buoys is to be maintained in a 1km radius ring around Site-97 with each mounted with a Scranton Reality Anchor. All abnormalities in local geological formation are to be explained as the result of extreme pressure and heat brought about by the asteroid impact.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4734 is the core of the Chicxulub asteroid that collided with Earth approximately 65 million years ago. SCP-4734 contains a large amount of exotic matter\n2\n which causes large fluctuations in local Hume levels due to unstable interactions with local normal matter. Proposals for the mining and study of the exotic matter are currently under review\n3\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4734 was discovered in 1978 during a search for potential sites for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. During the search local disturbances in gravitational mapping and geological layout were discovered and local agents relayed this to the Foundation. Several Foundation members embarked on an initial research expedition to the potential anomaly's location and confirmed its existence via Kant counter.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Due to the significant interest in geological surveys of the impact area, Foundation personnel are to be embedded within research groups sent to the area of SCP-4734. All data gathered during these expeditions is to be modified to fall in line with expected norms of an asteroid impact on this scale, with all unmodified data being sent back to the Foundation for study.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0access\u00a0required.\u00a0Please\u00a0enter\u00a0password.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Password\u00a0accepted\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4734\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-4734 is to be monitored at all times for signs of exotic matter leaks, increased power output or structural degradation. Any fluctuation in SCP-4734's Hume levels are to be recorded. Scranton Reality Anchors are to be maintained at all times during expeditions into SCP-4734. Hazmat suits equipped for nuclear agents are to be worn to minimise exposure to Cherenkov radiation\n4\n throughout SCP-4734.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4734 is the remains of the Foundation spacecraft \"Hermes\" which is approximately 65 million years old. The hull of SCP-4734 is partially fused with the interior of the Chicxulub meteor, causing many portions of SCP-4734 to be inaccessible at this time. Despite the considerable forces placed upon SCP-4734 during its impact with Earth there is minimal damage to the hull and structure. Some portions have been explored, with partial black box recordings being recovered from the on board computers.\n\n\nThe main power generator for the craft is an exotic matter reactor, which while damaged still functions to a reasonable degree. The damage to the reactor's housing has caused numerous disturbances to local space-time in the form of Hume level fluctuations, caused by the housed exotic matter coming into contact with normal matter.\n\n\nThis reactor is theorised to be the main source of SCP-4734's propulsion, as fragmented logs found on board make reference to an experimental \"Alcubierre Drive\", a theorised Faster Than Light propulsion device\n5\n. To date no excavation or exploration of SCP-4734 has found such a device, leading to the conclusion that it is still fused inside of the surrounding rock.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n During the initial investigation into the gravitational anomalies discovered by geophysicists in 1978 Foundation agents received an SOS broadcast from an unidentified Foundation source. Tracing of this signal placed the source 20km below sea level at the centre of the Chicxulub impact crater. All attempts to contact the source were met with no response.\n\n\nRemotely operated drills were placed within the Gulf of Mexico, followed by submersible drones and over the course of 7 years the Foundation created a series of tunnels to enable direct access to SCP-4734.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following documents are transcripts of recorded transmissions and recovered documents from SCP-4734. Due to the partially fused state of SCP-4734 most documents are corrupted.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4734 Flight Recorder Log-1A\n\n\n002AF5C0 00\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000 00\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\n\n002AF5D0 00\u00a00C 00\u00a000\u00a002 C3\u00a000 F6 8J 05\u00a01H 5L 0Q W8\u00a000\u00a000\n\n\nFOUNDATION_DECRYPTION_KEY_ACCEPTED\n\n\n21JW-P1-13W22:13:22Z\n\n\nSYSTEM_STATUS = NOMINAL\n\n\nCREW_COUNT = 13\n\n\nCREW_STATUS = GREEN\n\n\nREACTOR_CONTAINMENT = 20H\n\n\nCURRENT_VELOCITY = %.12KMS\n\n\nDRIVE_STATUS = CHARGING\n\n\nDRIVE_STATUS = READY\n\n\nDRIVE_ACTIVATION_S&^*EN43 = AC72V3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n007BF5A0 00\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000 00\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\u00a000\n\n007BF5B0 1C 04 DD 9F 1R 66\u00a074 CF 5S 09\u00a07K FT R1\u00a02K L9\u00a050\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4734-Document-4A: Personal Log - Captain Ta%*t\u00a3a 2a\u00a3fe\n\n\nTIMESTAMP - 217R-Q1-12T15:05:11\n\n\nPre-warp tests are going well, Nephus has the drive set up for our launch tomorrow morning.

Each will be prioritised for training and placement to bring their skills in line with those discovered on documents aboard SCP-4734.

While it has been determined that the impact site is directly below the town of Chicxulub, the most efficient and safe access to SCP-4734 is via oceanic caverns.\n\n\n2\n.

For further reading on the potential application of exotic matter, please see \"Exotic Matter: Applied Theories on Faster than Light Travel\".\n\n\n4\n. A type of radiation created when an item moves through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium.\n\n\n5\n. Proposed by Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre, the drive would allow a craft to move faster than the speed of light via the warping of local space. The function of this relied upon the use of exotic matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4733\n | SCP-4734 | \nSCP-4735\n \u00bb",
