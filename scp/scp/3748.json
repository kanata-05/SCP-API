The walls of SCP-3748's containment chamber are to be made at least five meters thick, and no open spaces are allowed within five meters of SCP-3748's cell.\n\n\nStaff who receive Level 2 authorization may speak with SCP-3748. However, potential interviewers are to be warned that SCP-3748 has an exceptionally vitriolic personalty.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3748 is a ceramic bowl containing approximately 600 \nMusca domestica\n1\n cadavers. These cadavers can be removed from SCP-3748, though it expresses discomfort when this happens. SCP-3748 will regenerate at a rate of one fly every three minutes if a portion is removed.\n\n\nSCP-3748 has developed a sapient consciousness fluent in English and knows very basic Japanese. SCP-3748's primary method of communication is telepathy, where it speaks in a male Midwest American accent. This telepathy is not two-way; however, SCP-3748 has a sense of hearing despite not possessing hearing apparatuses.\n\n\nSCP-3748's primary mode of translocation is teleportation. SCP-3748 is capable of instantaneously transporting itself up to approximately 4.78 meters at a time. SCP-3748 can do this four times in a minute before showing signs of exhaustion; however, SCP-3748 has implied on multiple occasions that it could teleport itself more if it exercised.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-3748 was created by PoI-2343 (Jacob Sherman) for his school's science fair. PoI-2343 supposedly put a piece of flypaper into a ceramic bowl, and left it outside until a great number of flies accrued in the bowl. PoI-2343 did not create SCP-3748 intentionally, and it is believed that neither PoI-2343 nor any members of his immediate family have reality-altering capabilities. The flypaper used to create SCP-3748 has not been recovered.\n\n\nInterview Log 1:\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Attachment:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a03748-Alpha\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n PoI-2343\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Sarah Clemson\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Hello, Jacob. How are you feeling today?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n I'm doing great!\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n That's good to hear. Last month you had a science fair at your school, correct?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Yup.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n What was your project for the science fair?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Well, I put two bowls with flypaper in them in two different places, one out in the sun, and one inside near an open window for a couple hours. I was gonna see the difference in flies collected in the bowl if the bowl was inside versus outside.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n When did you discover the bowl's properties?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n A day before the fair. I was checking up on both of the bowls to see what I caught. The bowl outside collected way more flies than the other. \nWay\n more. Anyway, I was gonna bring the outside bowl back inside, when I heard someone say, \"It smells in here.\" It came from the bowl of dead flies.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n What did it say to you?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Well, it really scared me. I went over to pick it up, and it said \"Hey, kid, over here, give me a hand?\" and \"If you could get rid of this flypaper that would be great.\" It was weird too, it spoke without a mouth, and I heard it talking in my head. It didn't have any ears either, but it could hear me.\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Anyway, I accidentally threw it off the table. Uh, then we talked for a bit after I calmed down. It said that it was a \"nice and friendly\" person, talked about how it got all the ladies, and how everyone thought he was the best.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n What did you do after that?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Actually, we had a conversation about picking up girls. He told me he could be my wingman, show me the ropes on how to score one, how to be smooth and all that. I really didn't know what he was doing, but I was, and still am, an awkward high school student, so I listened. Once I got past him being, uh, odd, we actually became good friends as well, and we would have conversations with each other when nobody was looking. I didn't tell anyone about it, because I was literally asking for dating advice from a bowl of dead flies.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n I see. Anything else of note before we acquired it?\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n It told me it was good at video games, so I gave it my computer so that \"he could teach me.\" It teleported all over the keyboard and pressed a bunch of random buttons, and he used all of my items at once, and jumped off a cliff. He told me my keyboard sucked.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Hmm, I see. This interview is over. Thank you for cooperating, Jacob.\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n No problem. Where is Bernard, anyways?\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n We're checking him at the moment. You'll be reunited shortly.\n\n\nPoI-2343:\n Thanks, ma'am.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n PoI-2343 was administered Class-C amnestics and released back into public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 2:\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Attachment:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a03748-Beta\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW LOG\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3748\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Sarah Clemson\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Hello, my good madam.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Good afternoon, SCP-3748.

People hate me, but I can't stop the act because people will hate me even more! I don't know what to do.\n\n\n<Researcher Clemson sits down>\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Can you answer my questions now?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n \nSniff.\n Yes.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Do you know who created you?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n \nSigh.\n A kid. I think his name was Sherman. I lied to him that I was a hit with the ladies. Because of course I do, why else would a subhuman like me survive in this world? I'm not gonna hit it up with anyone, nobody is going to spend the time with me.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Stay on topic, SCP-3748.\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Sorry.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Anyway. Do you have any memory of before you were created?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Uh\u2026 no. No. Probably was still a loser though.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Okay. The child said your name was Bernard, is that correct?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Yes.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n Okay. One last question. Do you know how you are able to talk and see?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n I don't know. I can see, breathe, smell, and hear perfectly. I don't know.\n\n\n<SCP-3748 appears to sob again, but less severely>\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Sorry that I don't know anything.\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n It's fine. You've given us enough information. Any thing to say before I conclude this interview?\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Yeah. Um\u2026 do you want to hang out sometime? Maybe grab some coffee?\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n SCP-3748, I'm marri-\n\n\nSCP-3748:\n Wow! Because \nof course\n you are, you raging slutbag.

You wouldn't know chivalry if it bit you on the\u2014\n\n\nResearcher Clemson:\n This interview is over.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n For approximately 2 hours after the interview, SCP-3748 continued to yell several profanities directed towards Researcher Clemson before eventually calming down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
