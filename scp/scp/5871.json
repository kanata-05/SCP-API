Usage requires authorization from both the Overseer Council and Ethics Committee.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5871 is an obsidian ritual knife, with seven unpolished gems encrusting its handle.\n\n\nThe object was discovered in an anomalous burial site within modern-day Mongolia in 1831 and was created in 2020.\n\n\nAs a consequence, utilizing SCP-5871 to symbolically kill an entity (see Document 5871-REST for ritual details) will result in said target being destroyed retroactively. This has proven useful in the neutralization of several dangerous ontokinetic, metaphysical, and temporal anomalies.\n\n\nAddendum 5871-1:\n History\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1831\n\n\nArtifact is discovered following a tip from an anonymous source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1831\n\n\nArtifact is shipped to Site-19 (then called Facility-C).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1831\n\n\nDespite being slated for an SCP designation and testing, a clerical error results in relegation to bulk storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1944\n\n\nArtifact is rediscovered during records digitization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1944\n\n\nSCP-5871 is designated and provisional testing begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1944\n\n\nSCP-5871 is classed as Safe and placed in storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 1963\n\n\nRoutine maintenance on the IntSCPFN file system reveals several anachronistic edits regarding SCP-5871. It is assumed to be a computer bug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nUnknown agents (believed to be of the Chaos Insurgency) breach Site-19 and terminate SCP-048.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1980\n\n\nAs part of the incident report, Dr. Richard Myers theorizes the existence of \"subtemporal\" material. His work is highly controversial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1983\n\n\nSCP-5871 is relocated to the newly-created Site-03, and Dr. Patricia Carver is designated as project lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1983\n\n\nDr. Richard Myers is assigned to the SCP-5871 project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1983\n\n\nSCP-5871 is successfully used to neutralize a Keter-class anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1983\n\n\nSCP-5871 is reclassed as Thaumiel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1986\n\n\nDr. Richard Myers goes missing, presumed deceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2002\n\n\nA large cache of obsidian is discovered in an undocumented area of Site-77.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 2002\n\n\nWith recently-developed temporal displacement sensors, it is determined that the obsidian exhibits subtemporal properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 2007\n\n\nRe-analysis of several soil samples suggests SCP-5871's discovery site was retroactively contaminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 2007\n\n\nSubtemporal materials research begins at the prompting of O5-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\nProject Oedipus is approved and launched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2020\n\n\nSCP-5871 is created. Project Oedipus is concluded, and all personnel are issued amnestics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n\nEfforts to fully analyze SCP-5871's chronology begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 2056\n\n\nAgents of the \nTemporal Anomalies Department\n will plant SCP-5871 in its discovery site. (Planned)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2056\n\n\nMauna Loa volcano erupts, from which SCP-5871 material will be harvested. (Predicted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will be updated as SCP-5871 chronology is better understood. Contact Researcher Agatha Myers for more information.\n\n\nAddendum 5871-2:\n Incident 5871-62\n\n\nA second, seemingly-identical instance of SCP-5871 was found in Area-313 Deep Storage. The HMCL Supervisor ordered that the object be returned to its unmarked crate, all records of the discovery be destroyed, and all personnel with knowledge of the incident be amnesticized.\n\n\nO5-9 overrode the directive, instructing that the two anomalies be physically compared. The results of this analysis are attached below:\n\n\n[\nLINK ERROR:\n File 6R0CF/7301567/SCP-5871/6084/8C not found.]\n\n\n\n\nThe above document was discovered in the most recent DEEPWELL backup of the IntSCPFN database. Its metadata claims it was filed by Site-03, a nonexistent Foundation facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naismallard's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-5134\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7558\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4339\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1047-J\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3597\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5900\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4838\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8019\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4447\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1294-J\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6115\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8998\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4853\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4322\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5446\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nCrunch Time\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heart of the Beast\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pumpkin Mystery\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStealing Something Else\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\naismallard's personnel file\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet The Staff\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5870\n | SCP-5871 | \nSCP-5872\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5871\n\" by aismallard, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
