Testing parties may request extra film and printing paper at their leisure. SCP-978 is not to be used for blackmail, entertainment, or personal reasons.\n\n\nThis means you. ~ O5-\u2588\u2588\n\nAll photographs produced by SCP-978 are to be cataloged along with full testing description. Requests to destroy photographs may be processed by Level-4 security clearance or higher personnel, at the discretion of the testing party.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-978 appears to be a standard red-and-black Polaroid Supercolor 645 CL instant camera, with no distinctive identifying marks or damage. SCP-978 operates the same as a standard camera, and shows no anomalous behavior beyond the photographs it produces. When a subject is pictured with SCP-978, the photograph that develops shows not what the subject was doing at the time of the photo, but rather what the subject wanted to be doing.\n\n\nThis effect appears to be, for the most part, random, sometimes showing drastic changes and deeply suppressed desires, or simple changes and alterations to the subject or their surroundings. SCP-978 appears to be capable of expressing the desires of both humans and other creatures (see testing log) and appears to convey the simplest desires the easiest. Should two subjects with contrasting desires both be photographed together, the subjects' desires appear to 'mix' (see testing log for additional information).\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nSubjects are allowed to request photographs of themselves. Remember, people, just because some of the photos show distasteful things doesn't mean that you're going to do them. ~ Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nTesting Log\n\n\n\n\nLog Format\n\nSubject:\n\nPhotographed Activity:\n\nPhoto Result:\n\n\n\n\nTesting 05/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSimple study of basic research team.\n\n\nSubject:\n Research Assistant James \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nPhotographed Activity:\n Smiling for the camera, neutral pose.\n\n\nPhoto Result:\n Subject is shown looking much more tired and unprofessional, drinking from a flask.\n\n\nSubject:\n Research Assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nPhotographed Activity:\n Smiling for the camera, neutral pose.\n\n\nPhoto Result:\n Subject is shown in casual clothes, as if heading out for the night.
