The names in the movie seemed familiar, but I\u2014er\u2014couldn't place them exactly. It's not like I've ever heard of its director, Aldila, but I haven't been in Italy for too long after all. More importantly; there was a photograph taped under the seat. I don't know what made me check that or how \u1d35\u1d40 could've gotten there\u2014one of the most popular movies of 1984 and always in theaters?
