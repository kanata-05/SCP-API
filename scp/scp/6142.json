A monthly stipend is to be provided to Professor Granger for testing purposes and living expenses. A full breakdown of this income is available under Financial Chart 6142-1.\n\n\nSCP-6142 is contained in the rear garden of Professor Granger's home behind secure walls specifically built for this purpose. Personnel embedded in the local area are to respond to any requests for maintenance as quickly as possible. In the event of any intruders entering SCP-6142, Professor Granger is to request assistance using his direct Foundation line.\n\n\nProfessor Granger is to send periodic messages to Site-22 confirming SCP-6142's continued containment and any testing performed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6142 is a 5m x 5m area of grassland in the village of Lerry, England. Previously, this land was part of the village's surrounding countryside \u2014 however, following an expansion of residential areas in 2004, SCP-6142 neighbours the outermost streets of the community. This also led to its discovery by the Foundation after several parents in the area reported concerns of inappropriate play their children were participating in.\n\n\nAny individuals within SCP-6142 will experience a greater than usual inclination to crucify frogs, which the village of Lerry has a significant population of.\n\n\nNote that this is not a compulsive effect: individuals are fully capable of ignoring these urges. Thoughts of crucifying frogs will simply arise more often, and the individual will be more likely to pursue them. Attempts to actually carry out these crucifixions are more often than not unsuccessful, as the frogs escape from attempts to restrain them. When crucifixions are actually carried out, however, they commonly follow a facsimile of the methodology used by the Roman Empire \u2014 the frog is either bound or nailed upon a makeshift T-shaped gibbet, then left to die over time.\n\n\nThis urge appears to extend only to the act of crucifixion itself; once the frog is initially crucified, the affected individuals quickly lose interest, even if the frog in question comes free of their restraints and escapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6142-1 (Containment Records)\n\n\n\n\nDue to SCP-6142's ease of containment, the relatively benign nature of its effects, and the extensive testing already performed, it was selected as a candidate for the Foundation's experimental partial retirement scheme. Under this scheme, trusted personnel intending to retire are given custody of an especially low-risk anomaly and assigned to report back regarding containment and additional testing.\n\n\nIn the case of SCP-6142, custody was assigned to Professor Elias Granger, formerly of Site-22. The following audio reports span the first three months of containment.\n\n\n\n\nWe finished moving my things in yesterday. The containment staff did most of the work, but I chipped in as much as I could \u2014 which wasn't much, but still. I understand you\u2019re going to be handling these messages, Ernesto! It\u2019s good they\u2019re trusting you with more responsibilities. You\u2019ll go far.\n\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of the last day going through the files the previous containment staff left behind. I reviewed them during the preparations, of course, but it\u2019s good to keep these things fresh. Most avenues of testing have already been pursued, but I\u2019m sure I can come up with a few things.\n\n\nAt any rate, it feels good to be back here. It\u2019s been a long time since I lived in Lerry, but it doesn't seem to have changed much. The fresh air is very welcome after working down in Site-22 for so long. One of the moving boys asked if I wouldn\u2019t prefer to retire proper \u2014 of course not. If I weren't here doing this, how could I trust it would be done right?\n\n\nIt\u2019s late now, so I\u2019ll get into things properly from tomorrow onwards. I'm looking forward to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not used to such quiet work. \n(laughs)\n Back at Site-22, there was a great deal more running and, well\u2026 ah, screaming\u2026 a lot of that was before your time, Ernesto, but ask some of the veterans around the Site! They'll be happy to tell you some war stories.\n\n\nStill, I've been keeping myself busy. I've been testing SCP-6142 at different times of the day, to determine if the strength of the effect differs at all. It does not. Well, you don't know if you don't test.\n\n\nI've had a lot of time for some\u2026 well, leisure. Yes, leisure. I don't mean to be rude to the staff who built this place, Ernesto, but the outside walls really could do with a fresh coat of paint. I'd do it myself, but my knees don't permit. Just something to note.\n\n\nI've been\u2026 sending letters as well, to my son, Jamie. I'm sure I must have mentioned him to you at some point. I was \u2014 I've been with the Foundation for a long time, and that took up quite a bit of my time, which led to\u2026 well, difficulties at home. We haven't spoken in some time. \n(laughs)\n It was a struggle to even get his address, to tell you the truth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day to you, Ernesto. Hope you're still working hard. You always had a tendency to, ah, to slack off towards the winter months, so take care, alright?\n\n\nI have been experimenting with a few different species of frogs this last week or so, attempting to determine if the strength of the compulsion differs depending, perhaps \u2014 oh, I know it isn't a \ncompulsion\n! A slip of the tongue. The strength of the\u2026 \ninclination\n.\n\n\nAt any rate, I felt the same amount of desire to crucify one type of frog as I did to crucify another. Which is to say, more than usual.\n\n\nI sent another letter today \u2014 to\u2026 to Jamie I mean. Like with the others, I don't expect anything to come of it, but\u2026 one must, surely. I have to try, don't I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been experimenting with proximity over the last few weeks \u2014 for example, placing a caged frog within SCP-6142, standing outside it, and seeing if the effects differ from the uneven exposure.\n\n\nResults are\u2026 difficult to convey, really. I won't deny that, looking at the frog, the thought of crucifying it seemed quite attractive. But more like a \u2014 a \nnovelty\n than anything else, an intrusive thought rather than something really to be acted upon. However, I did have a great deal on my mind, which could have distracted me. This factor must be taken into consideration when noting this down, Ernesto.\n\n\nThe nature of the distraction, ah \u2014 I've been speaking to my son over the phone recently. To Jamie. I suppose all those letters must have finally worn him down, eh? It's been good to hear his voice. So much older, so many things missed, but\u2026 well\u2026 there's time now, isn't there?\n\n\nAs such, a temporary replacement warden will be required for containment from\u2026 \n(flicking pages)\n July 28th to August 5th. Jamie was a little reticent at first, but I've managed to convince him. A little father-and-son trip up to the Lake District, nothing fancy, but a good opportunity to get to know each other more.\n\n\nApologies for any inconvenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't managed to get much testing done since my previous message, Ernesto, but I suppose that was never the focus of containment here, was it? All the same, my apologies.\n\n\nIt's been a good while since I went on a bona fide trip. I hardly know what to pack! Clothes, obviously, and toothpaste and hygienics and whatnot\u2026 would suntan lotion be required? I mean, it's hardly the dunes of Egypt, but you never know.\n\n\nI do hope Jamie is making good progress with his packing, too. We went to the Canary Islands, just once, when he was little, and oh\u2026 the state of his suitcase. Utterly diabolical.\n\n\nI'm very sorry, this isn't relevant, you don't want to hear an old man ramble. Wishing you all the best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an amendment to previous messages. Temporary warden replacement will not\u2026 will not be necessary. I got a call from Jamie late last night.\n\n\nHe said he's been thinking about his\u2026 about all the times he needed me, and all the times I failed him \u2014 and all the times I promised I'd never do it again and I lied. He said he couldn't bear the thought of spending time with me, a week at that, with all those shadows between us. He couldn't bear the thought of setting himself up for all that again. Very reasonable perspective. I asked him when I \nwould\n be seeing him. He said he didn't know there would be a time like that.\n\n\nAs such, I'm\u2026 I'm happy to report that my week's absence will not be a factor any longer. I'm very sorry if any preparations have already been made, but they are no longer necessary. I\u2026\n\n\n(coughing)\n\n\nI think I was very much looking forward to it.\n\n\nMy apologies. I'm really\u2026 very sorry. You don't want to hear about all this. It isn't relevant to the anomaly, it's embarrassing, really. I'm so sorry. It doesn't matter. SCP-6142 requires my attention: there's a great deal of\u2026 we need to fully understand SCP-6142, so I really can't spare any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI took a toad into SCP-6142 today \u2014 not a frog, mind you \u2014 to note if it inspired the same\u2026 \nfascinations\n. They're very similar, after all.\n\n\nIt did not. Nothing else to report, thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo change. Nothing to report. I find myself wondering how you're all doing back at Site-22. Is Ernesto still the one who handles these messages? If I recall, he was talking about getting married when I left. How was the wedding? You were always a hard worker, Ernesto.\n\n\nYou deserve happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo change. Redid all testing on the previous frogs, and at the different times of day to measure any discrepancies in my thought processes. I think I may have noticed some areas of interest \u2014 I'll continue testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedid testing again. No change. My mistake.\n\n\nA call wouldn't go amiss, you know. An old man gets lonely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I might have been to this place before. I-I dreamed about it last night, you see \u2014 now, I'm not sure if this was an \nactual\n dream, or a memory I've forgotten about, or a mixture of those, but it really was incredibly vivid.\n\n\nIn my\u2026 well, in this scenario, I was out playing with my friends, on our bicycles, when we stopped here for some reason. We were nine or ten in this scenario, children at any rate, and I just have this absolutely crystal \u2014 \npristine\n image, really, of us crucifying frogs. Holding onto those slippery bodies and tying them to crosses made from those, um, those little sticks from ice pops. The name escapes me.\n\n\nI remember, well, that all my friends looked as if they were enjoying themselves quite a bit. Laughing, chatting excitedly, pointing at the frogs squirming on their crosses. Eventually the frogs slipped free and hopped away, of course, but that didn't ruin the fun any for them. It was the sport of it, I imagine, more than anything.\n\n\nMe, though? I recall sweat pouring down my face, my hands shaking as I did my best to hold the frogs down. It wasn't a game for me, in the dream at least, there was a real sense of\u2026 of urgency to it. As if, by crucifying frogs, I was maintaining some kind of cosmic balance. As if\u2026 if I didn't, the sun would crash right into the earth \u2014 or something of that nature.\n\n\nNot true, of course. But that was my impression at the time.\n\n\nThat's always been me, I suppose. I don't know that I've ever actually done anything that I wanted to\u2026 or if I was just scared what \nnot\n doing it would mean. School, my job, all this\u2026 all obligation.\n\n\nThe things I do \nwant\n\u2026 I don't know that they're there for me anymore.\n\n\nI'm going to be making a choice now. They're all over the windows. Thank you very much for letting me know you all.\n\n\nPlease don't tell Jamie. It would only upset him.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the concerning content of this report, a team was immediately dispatched to check up on Professor Granger and confirm his safety.\n\n\nUpon arriving at the property, the team received no response to calls or knocks. Upon forcefully entering the property, Professor Granger was not found until the team moved out into SCP-6142 proper.\n\n\nThere, Professor Granger was found to have expired.\n\n\nInspection of the body showed that Professor Granger had been crucified upside-down using two planks pried from the garden shed, together with the accompanying nails through his palms. Cause of death ruled as heart failure. Positioning of the body and the complete nature of his restraints confirmed that this crucifixion could not possibly have been performed by Professor Granger himself.\n\n\nRevision of containment procedures is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6141\n | SCP-6142 | \nSCP-6143\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6142\n\" by Tanhony, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
