The Foundation is to coordinate with local and international emergency management bodies to organise aid in the event that the object shows signs of initiating a 2705-\u03b1 event. In the case of a 2705-\u03b2 event, embedded Foundation assets are to obfuscate and/or confiscate all resulting seismographic data recorded by civilian institutions.\n\n\nEfforts to further probe the nature and capabilities of SCP-2705 are ongoing, but due to the difficulty of interacting with it in any way, progress is limited mainly to analysing the data from 2705-\u03b2 events.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2705 is an anomalous mass located within the Earth\u2019s upper mantle. Its existence, position and properties can be inferred by measuring the defect in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field caused by its irregular density profile. It is comprised of a dense and roughly tetrahedral shell, with an evacuated or nearly massless interior and an ultra-dense point mass at its extreme inwards-pointing tip. The object's volume is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 km\n3\n and its average density 3950\u00a0kg/m\n3\n, making it neutrally buoyant at the depth it normally resides.\n\n\nSCP-2705 is capable of autonomous movement within the Earth\u2019s interior. Since first being detected on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1978, SCP-2705 has moved in an erratic path beneath the North Pacific region at speeds of up to \u2588\u2588cm/s, at depths in the range of 200-550km (excluding 2705-\u03b1 and 2705-\u03b2 events).\n\n\nAt irregular intervals,\n1\n SCP-2705 will change its regular behaviour and rapidly rise towards the Earth\u2019s surface at speeds of up to \u2588m/s, slowing as it reaches the bottom of the oceanic crust. At this point it will initiate either a 2705-\u03b1 or 2705-\u03b2 event.\n\n\nIn a 2705-\u03b1 event, the object will vibrate at a high frequency for up to 5 minutes before returning to its usual depth. 2705-\u03b1 events have induced volcanic or tectonic activity in \u2588\u2588% of observed cases.\n\n\nIn a 2705-\u03b2 event, the object will vibrate with variable frequency for up to 5 hours before retreating. Analysis of seismographic data from 2705-\u03b2 events indicates that the pulses contain ordered data. Foundation cryptography assets have indicated that these transmissions may represent as many as 6 unique languages out of all \u2588\u2588 recorded instances, but attempts to decrypt them have been unsuccessful with the exception of event 2705-\u03b2-52.\n\n\nEvent 2705-\u03b2-52\n\nAt 15:57 on 1/1/2013, gravimetric advance warning devices indicated that SCP-2705 had begun to rise through the mantle. The object initiated a 2705-\u03b2 event consisting of 50 pulses of approximately 8 second duration each, spread over 53 minutes. The resulting binary transmission is believed to be intended for processing as a 2D image.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0image\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPictorial representation of data transmitted during Event 2705-\u03b2-52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1\n\nOn \u2588/\u2588/2027, Foundation scientific assets stationed on Mare Imbrium detected an anomalous dense mass within the Moon's interior. Subsequent studies via. gravimetric and tomographic sensors mapped an incomplete tetrahedral mass embedded 5\u00a0km deep in the Lunar crust.\n2\n The object's size appears to have been similar to that of SCP-2705, although it has been severely deformed and disrupted, its interior breached and filled with Lunar crustal material.
