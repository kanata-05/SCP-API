Tanaka\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo caption selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Global psychiatric resources are to be monitored for signs of SCP-6504 manifestations in patients. Foundation mainstream scientific journal approval boards are to be routinely searched and expunged of any reference pertaining to SCP-6504 through conventional information suppression protocols. Individuals believed to be affected by SCP-6504 are to be documented, interviewed, and held on-site for research purposes.\n\n\n\n\nput myself in the basement. boarded up the windows. not going to leave. there\u2019s a rotten, little flame inside me, barely burning, but the pain compounds. i can endure it, but there\u2019s nothing there anymore. nothing nothing nothing. to them, nothing is still too much left.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6504 is a psychological condition in which an individual perceives Earth\u2019s sun and moon as possessing human facial features when observed. Feelings of severe paranoia, resulting from the victim\u2019s belief that both objects are capable of observing them, are a prominent symptom of SCP-6504.\n\n\nIndividuals describe the sun as possessing an agonized, pained scowl, and ascribe the star as provoking feelings of intense hatred of themselves and those around them. The moon\u2019s expression has been described as hollow, or devoid of emotion, with the satellite inciting feelings of extreme disassociation and despair.\n\n\n\n\ntwo of the same. two types of anger. they hate me. they hate me. all they can do is hate. and they love it. i don\u2019t know what i did.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6504\u2019s two primary anomalous effects manifest in correspondence to the individual\u2019s proximity to the aforementioned celestial bodies, but occur regardless of whether or not the individual is capable of observing the two objects. During the day, when the sun is visible, an individual\u2019s innards, including their flesh, muscle tissue, organs, and skeleton, will gradually heat themselves over the duration of the day to temperatures up to 1,000\u00a0K, resulting in incredible amounts of pain. Despite the lethality such heat imposes on the human body, no physical damage is sustained, and their bodies do not outwardly reflect their actual temperature when touched or interacted with.\n\n\n\n\ndied a million deaths in the past thirty seconds. but i don\u2019t pass out anymore. used to, a week ago. It\u2019s still morning.\n\n\n\n\nAt night, when the moon is visible, an affected individual will enter a pseudocoma state, where their entire body will experience paralysis, with the exception of their eyes, eyelids, and mouth. Individuals will experience severe disassociation and heightened brain activity, comparable to patterns observed in ordinary REM sleep, which results in dream-like hallucinations. These hallucinations most frequently revolve around motifs of featureless vistas, floating, and stagnation.\n\n\n\n\na reminder that the end will not come quickly. it is slow. it is forever. at the end, there is another end. and another. again. another. again. another. don\u2019t be so optimistic.\n\n\n\n\nThe symptoms of SCP-6504 are presently unable to be offset by any means but death. No deaths have occurred as a result of SCP-6504, with individuals succumbing to other factors instead, such as age, malnutrition, or suicide.\n\n\n\n\nit\u2019s like living with no curtains. nothing to shield you from the eyes that watch so many but only you. they can see everyone but only you. the fire\u2019s boiling my blood.\n\n\n\n\nThe first documented cases of SCP-6504 were observed during the months following the televised broadcast of the 1969 United States\u2019 Apollo 11 Moon Landing, when a small demographic of viewers began experiencing symptoms of the disorder after supposedly witnessing \u201cthe corner of the moon\u2019s face\u201d on the broadcast. All publicly available footage of this event has been edited, with offending elements removed and cut. Presently, 13 SCP-6504-affected individuals have been documented as alive and contained by the Foundation. 98% of all known SCP-6504 cases have resulted in suicide, often carried out shortly after the symptoms of the disorder begin to manifest. The cause of SCP-6504 remains unknown, with no discernible patterns between cases, or identifiable vectors of transmission, if any exist.\n\n\n\n\nnumber alive fluctuates. most can\u2019t make it past a week before giving in. guy at 179 has been kept there since apollo. i don\u2019t want to die. but i don\u2019t want that to be me. it\u2019s been a week. foundation thinks i\u2019m on sick leave. i can\u2019t go outside anymore. i saw a glimpse of them, and they\u2019re in everyone. don\u2019t want to look. should gouge my eyes out with a screwdriver and twist and TWIST and WEDGE until its a bloody, gutted hole. like the sun craves and the moon is. devour me. spare me. tear me apart, but do it in secret, under no light but our own.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6504.1:\n Interview Log\n\n\nThe following log transcript is sourced from an interview between Junior Researcher Lyndoff, and an individual affected by SCP-6504.\n\n\n\n\nthe logs don\u2019t tell what happened. they\u2019re gone now. easing through the pain but i will try. fuck you try. TRY. don\u2019t you dare.\n\n\nhe\u2019s scared. it\u2019s night, the featureless giant bears witness to those cursed to SEE. he\u2019s not coughing blood, he can\u2019t do that. it\u2019s pooling in his throat and we\u2019re pumping it out. while pumping in amnestics, parapharmaceuticals, and anything we can find to get him talking. after an hour, it works. after another hour, he talks.\n\n\nabout the moon. the cold. it sees, it watches, it sees, it watches, it\u2019s forever. i\u2019ve said it all before. every interview is the same. the same sickened babble i\u2019ve been vomiting out myself now. nothing to gain. and then he\u2019s sleeping again, but with his eyes open.\n\n\nthis is when it started, on the roof of the facility checking forms and papers and making sure i was doing the POINTLESS POINTLESS POINTLESS work that i had always done. not diligently. not with care. just a distraction, leading up to the moment when i gazed at the face of the moon, and it broke a million bones just to say that it was not there.\n\n\nit didn\u2019t see me. there was no face, but it had always been watching. the shipwreck washed over me and the floatsam pierced my skin, tearing and ripping at the excess of NOTHINGNESS underneath. i didn\u2019t scream, i didn\u2019t cry. but i would, when the kingdom of the zero-eyed kings caressed my being. defiling me in the day. and then at night.\n\n\nnow i understand what the husk was saying on the hospital bed. i understand that he had been reduced to a blubbering fool at their feet. it\u2019s all entertainment to them. just a show, giving you a sliver of what they feel.\n\n\ni kept moving.\n\n\nthe streets are crawling with them, the faces that resemble grotesque mimicries of their celestial progenitors. the screaming sun, the hollowed moon, reflected a trillion times from face to face. kill kill kill kill. fear fear fear fear. they talk at me, but they don\u2019t speak, they gnash their teeth and wail their strained cries, and only i can hear them. i hate them. HATE THEM. i\u2019m scared of them. i collapsed in an alleyway, the feeling of the bright, too bright shining scintillating hellcrowd closing in on me. but i know it\u2019s just a feeling. they don\u2019t care. the only ones that do are the two above all, watching forever, like they always have.\n\n\nthe night\u2019s isolation, and the day\u2019s torture. i was primed. primed for it all to begin, and for every face i would see to bear their visage. i didn\u2019t dream that night. in the morning, the faces were there. in the sky, in the water, in the glare of the wood on the paneling on the floor. has the sun always been so close?\n\n\ni barely made it through work. i almost killed two of them, but i didn\u2019t. i almost stapled my director\u2019s eyelids to his stomach, and twisted his head just enough to keep him writhing and killed and dead and DEAD AND DEAD. wanted to put the other cunt in the sink and let someone find her. i don\u2019t mean it. i wouldn\u2019t do it. but it\u2019s what\u2019s being done to me, and if i\u2019m being hurt, why can\u2019t i hurt you back?\n\n\nthis is for archival purposes. so you know what\u2019s happening. so you know i\u2019m not the mindless, terminally ill piece of human trash i\u2019m coming off as. i\u2019m all there. i\u2019ve seen this before. the mind melting, the beams fucking in and out thrusting without warning into your FUCKING brain, fracturing your personality over and over and over and over and over again until you\u2019re a shell cracked into a dozen irregular pieces, unable to ever fit into a whole ever again. read more than a few files and you\u2019ll see it too. it\u2019s easy to forget that i am still here. the sun wants me to remember and the moon won\u2019t let me forget.\n\n\nthere is no ending. there is no revelation of new information. no explanation, or reason. there is simply the sun, and simply the moon. and everyone who can\u2019t see them, and no one who can.\n\n\ni will not preserve, i will crumble, i will crack, i do not care, i am burning, i\u2019m a forest, my body a bombed trench, for the sun and the moon, who kill me so happily, and brand all your faces, i\u2019m flood, i\u2019m a lethal accident, drop the kid, snap the bird\u2019s neck, can\u2019t undo it. i don\u2019t want to connect, won\u2019t let me out. tides rising to drown me out, pull me under, flay my skin with searing iron hot blank blank blank blank curling of the rays that caramelize and cripple. died through. nothing but flame while i\u2019m here, and nothing but frost while i\u2019m gone. fuck you, i\u2019m still here. STOP TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. I'M BURNING UP.\n\n\nstumbling now. can\u2019t hide anything from them like i can from you. they know how horrid. they know how suffocating. they know how much it hurts and how much it hates, but they relish in it. i think i know why. take my hands and unravel my woundflesh from it, won\u2019t you. let the flies get at it, with their faces contorted. let them fuck it. crack my bones, see what they say. it\u2019ll come for you too.\n\n\ngetting up.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.6504.2:\n Testing Logs\n\n\nA number of experiments have been performed related to SCP-6504.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\n\n\nSun\n\n\nThe\n\n\nMoon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKills\n\n\nAll\n\n\nIs\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't\n\n\nSee\n\n\nBurn\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nTouch\n\n\nCan't\n\n\nFloat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreaming\n\n\nHollow\n\n\nScorch\n\n\nFreeze\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUN\n\n\nMOON\n\n\nSUN\n\n\nMOON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\ndown the stairs, cracked my leg open. spent an hour in blood pooling, playing with it, feeling the bone beneath the skin writhe and dislodge. tempted to snap it but its just more pain. its only pain. pain doesn't matter any more. crawling to back room, where the shower is. i can drown myself out and they can all watch. and join the rest of the sun and moon sick, whose purpose was to die.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nend me fucking end me fucking end me just kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me. keep typing so they know. the only link to your mind. you're in the flames only flame. all scorch. at the stake.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\ncan't hold on.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nplease please please please grind my guts machine kill clog my lungs send me boiling don't just tease me fucking do it don't keep me here just do it slice me open sever nerves bash head open until jaw dislodges and body is gunned down sedated full pain like you're doing but COMMIT TO IT.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nfour times in the water now. i wont die i wont die i wont die. just pull up at the last second. and they're watching silently, without a word but i KNOW they want me dead. they're getting so impatient. why am i so weak. so much pain but i can't. a dying star from the ground up that's ready to serve. i cannot. didn't lose my mind, still have it, and its telling me to kill it, so why CAN'T I DO IT.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nwhat's holding on chaining me here. they're at the end, with scorched armor and no armor, open doors, just let me in. guide me in, with their smiles. smiles now. both of them, as i bring myself closer. closer closer. closer closer closer closer. they want it to happen. that's an excuse. but they want it. they're moving me forward, pushing me forward, to come and join them. give myself over to them. where they can hurt me more. that's what they want. hurt me more. not just watch. thousands and thousands of enzymes heating and cooling reflecting build again destroy again rebirth me forever, where they can have me. but not here. why give in.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nwhy given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. please give in, just stop pain. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. why given in. i don't die, just grip the ledge.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\ntried again. still holding on. what's keeping me here.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nwhy am i still here.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nthey're hate. so much right now. that i'm still here.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nits just too much to hold on, but i do. because i'm suffering. and i hate them too. and i endure, because I'M STILL HERE.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nstill here\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nstill here\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nstill here\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\ni can endure just to spite them.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum.6504.3:\n Further Incidents\n\n\nOn 2022/4/13, Junior Researcher Anthony Lyndoff, who had been conducting a large portion of contemporary research relating to SCP-6504, was found within his home after disappearing from work for two weeks. Lyndoff exhibited severe signs of SCP-6504, attempted self-harm, and extreme malnutrition. Upon collection, Lyndoff was largely unresponsive, with the initial flood of information regarding his condition coming from edits he had made in his research notes on SCP-6504. Lyndoff was transported to Foundation Secure Facility Area-179, where he had previously been employed, and placed in intensive care. Lyndoff was largely unresponsive and incoherent for the first three weeks of treatment, going into a semi-catatonic state.\n\n\nIn the months that followed, after usage of experimental memetic and parapharmaceutical treatment, as well as several quality of life improvements, such as regular speech and memory therapy, Lyndoff's condition had improved greatly.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Tanaka enters Lyndoff's room. The researcher is laying in a hospital bed, attached to a piece of machinery containing experimental anomalous painkilling medicine. The room's windows are shuttered, with their shades pulled down completely. Tanaka flips the pages of Lyndoff's journal, which he had been advised to keep as a continued form of therapy.\n\n\nTanaka:\n You\u2019re pretty theatrical when you write, Lyn, you know that?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n (\nRubs eyes\n) See what you come up with when your insides are like a fucking pressure cooker.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Noted. Now, how are we feeling today?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Like shit.\n\n\nTanaka:\n You don\u2019t sound it. You sound a lot better, actually.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n You know nothing\u2019s changed. Take my temperature, I\u2019m a goddamned oven. You just get more used to your insides cooking constantly. That parapharm cocktail helps too. Don't wanna rip my heart out of my chest and eat it or anything.\n\n\nTanaka:\n You aren\u2019t spiraling anymore. Not like you were a few weeks ago. Haven\u2019t tried to hurt yourself, haven\u2019t\u2026 you\u2019re a lot more coherent, more cognizant of your surroundings.\n\n\nTanaka sits on a chair, next to Lyndoff\u2019s bed.\n\n\nTanaka:\n How\u2019s my face?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n You\u2019re you.\n\n\nTanaka:\n How\u2019s yours?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n You know I don\u2019t want to look in the mirror.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Still?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n (\nGestures\n) I\u2019m afraid. That\u2019s why I got the windows shuttered too, man. I\u2019m still sick with this shit, doesn\u2019t matter how many drugs you put into me, or how comfortable I get with it all.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Well. We\u2019re not going to force you. Want to play chess?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Am I ever going to get the fuck out of here? Are you gonna let me live with this, or will I just\u2026 turn out like the other ones? Like that guy who vomits over himself every morning. The one that\u2019s been around sinc\u2013\n\n\nTanaka:\n We are letting you live with this. It\u2019s just taking a while, Lyn. A lot of us miss you, you\u2019re still a friend. We\u2019re handling this with as much leeway as the organization allows. I mean, this isn\u2019t some\u2026 you know, what we used to do with cases like this. You don\u2019t exactly have a rubber room here.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Right, it\u2019s more like a holding cell.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Come on. You have cognitohazardous therapy in a half hour. Get the muscles working instead of burning.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nTanaka:\n What?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n I had a dream last night. Not, like, an actual dream, but\u2026 whatever happens to me at night, when I start seeing things. I was back in my home, you know. Usually I don\u2019t know where I am, some fucking nowhere zone, or the bottom of a black hole, right? But I was in my house, and I\u2026. instinctively knew that this was when I first started feeling all of this bullshit. When I spent a week going in and out of consciousness on the floor because I couldn\u2019t handle the feeling of being burned alive over and over again without release.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Lyn.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m\u2026 just trying to explain myself. So my guts are being crisped, and I can taste ash in my mouth, but I\u2019m walking. Not keeling over in pain, or writing like an idiot in the draft terminal, just moving. And I get up the stairs, and make a left, where my bathroom is.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n So I looked in the mirror. I\u2026 saw my own reflection. And it made me scream.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Why\u2019s that?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n It was worse than I expected. My face was like\u2026 the sun, and the moon. Both of them. Not split down the middle like fucking Harvey Dent or something, but just a mass. The two swirling into each other and mixing, dancing on the blotch of skin where my face used to be. I start panicking, and I try to rip it off, tear my own face off. It didn\u2019t work, but it hurt like a bitch. It just stretched, and bled while it tormented me. My own face. And outside, behind the boarded windows, I could hear them laughing.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Who?\n\n\nLyndoff points upwards.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Now, they don\u2019t usually do that. They never do anything. That\u2019s the whole deal, right? The sun and the moon, silently watching, silently tormenting. That\u2019s not what this was. They were just laughing at me, and it was horrible, because I could see them do it too. And\u2026 I used to think it was hatred that they felt towards me, but it\u2019s not.\n\n\nTanaka:\n You\u2019ve talked about this. About the hatred.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n It\u2019s something other than hatred. Greater than it. I can hate them, but they don\u2019t hate me. I sound like a fucking nutcase, I know. But my hatred for them is only a fraction of what they feel towards me. It\u2019s so vile, so utterly irredeemable, that making concessions with it is futile.\n\n\nTanaka:\n I\u2019m sorry Lyn, I don\u2019t think I follow.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n It\u2019s just a dream I had. There\u2019s no grand conclusion, no definitive ending. This doesn\u2019t work like that. I would be comforted with a conclusion. Even a bad one. The reality is that all of this is uncertain. Like, if I were\u2013\n\n\nThe window\u2019s shuttered curtain flies open, revealing the sunset. Tanaka quickly leaps from the chair, attempting to pull the shade down. Lyndoff, who raised his hand to shield his face, slowly lowers it.\n\n\nTanaka:\n Shit! Shit! Christ, Lyn, just turn away! God, sorry, just a sec\u2013\n\n\nTanaka struggles, but eventually manages to pull the shade down a quarter of the way.\n\n\nLyndoff:\n No. Just\u2013\n\n\nTanaka:\n Hm?\n\n\nLyndoff:\n Just leave it open. It\u2019s okay.\n\n\nTanaka lets go of the shade. Lyndoff stares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6503\n | SCP-6504 | \nSCP-6505\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6504\n\" by J Dune, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
