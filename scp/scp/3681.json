The team is called \"Circular Pentagons\" and is made up of 11 abnormal fifthists players, all listed from SCP-3681-1 to -11 according to their jersey's numbers.\n\n\nThe players' abnormal capacities are minimal, they can only levitate the ball a few meters off the ground and leave it suspended in the air for shorts periods of time.\n\n\nSCP-3681 was only seen in its first match in the Round of 16 against the Unislist's Team of the Univers'Island Kingdom, a GoI studied by the French offices of the Foundation. Although the Unislist Team led the score at 5 - 0, the referee declared SCP-3681 as the winner of the game after SCP-3681 burst the ball, making it melt into a honey-like substance which smelled of smoke.\n\n\nAt no time during the game did the SCP-3681 players try to play soccer. They would levitate the ball between themselves. It has been theorized that the referee was also a member of the Fifth Church, which could not be confirmed as he vanished alongside SCP-3681. Upon making the call that SCP-3681 had won the game, it announced that the team had reached their goals and score would not match this reality.\n\n\nFollowing this event, the Unislist Team was designated as the loser and the match was replayed by opposing two other teams.\n\n\nAddendum 3681.1:\n\n\nThe Inter-Dimensional Federation of Abnormal Soccer (IDFAS) has released the following document to the spectators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackdoor Soho's Inter-Dimensional Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings to you, comrade and soccer fan!\n\n\nAs you will have noticed, the match you just saw was not the most interesting of the tournament. But don't worry about it! There will be others and much more ferocious.\n\n\nIf you wonder where the Pentagon Circulars have gone, don't think about it. Even if their top corner conceded 5 goals, they won. They have gone to far more distant lands than you, reader, to the Fifth Constellation.\n\n\nFive goals were enough to break one of the polygons that locked them in the big circle. They have achieved \ntheir goal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3680\n | SCP-3681 | \nSCP-3682\n \u00bb",
