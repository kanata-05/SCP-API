When removed from its unit, each instance is to be monitored at all times by no less than two handlers proficient in advanced combat training.\n\n\nEvery 24 hours, redundant SCP-5932 instances are to be euthanized. Due to the identical nature of separate instances, the specific instance chosen for termination is to be determined by random selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5932, formerly Charlotte Violet Owens, was a European female 27 years of age, previously employed by the Foundation as a non-anomalous operative in MTF \u03b6-12 (\"Turtle Down\")\n1\n. SCP-5932 did not differ from a baseline human beyond advanced combat capabilities expected of tactical Foundation personnel.\n\n\nFollowing an apparently random timeframe\n2\n, SCP-5932 and each subsequent instance spontaneously duplicated through an unidentified anomalous process. Subsequent instances were biologically and psychologically identical, and all instances possessed a collective memory. Each instance was capable of independent behavior and function, although research indicated that an increase in instances impaired SCP-5932's memory and sensory abilities due to human cognitive limitations.\n\n\nAddendum 5932-1:\n Development\n\n\nSCP-5932 was initially employed by the Foundation in 2008 as a security guard and stationed at Site-49 for four years until Containment Breach 049-21\n3\n. Following complete recovery from near-fatal injuries sustained during the incident, SCP-5932 was promoted to MTF \u03b6-12 (\"Turtle Down\") on the basis of exemplary conduct during active duty.\n\n\nIn 2013, SCP-5932 volunteered to participate in Project ASTEROIDEA, a Foundation effort to develop humanoid personnel with superior regenerative capabilities. Due to the nature of the project, only voluntary personnel deemed sufficiently loyal to the Foundation were approved for experimentation. The following files from the Project ASTEROIDEA archive have been included due to their relevance regarding the development of SCP-5932 and the initial analysis of their anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio/Visual Transcript\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 6/27/2013\n\n\nInvolved:\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Ezriel Abelson\n\n\nJunior Researcher Akari Ito\n\n\nAgent Charlotte Owens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nOwens is enclosed within a standard humanoid medical unit connected to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
