Personnel interacting with SCP-6057 are not to make any sudden movements and are to speak to it in a slow, calm manner.\n\n\nSCP-6057 is currently scheduled for biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Li, which are to be carried out every Tuesday and Thursday at 2 PM.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6057 is an automaton made of polypropylene plastic resembling a cartoon stylization of a bomb. SCP-6057 is capable of exploding with a force of up to 14 kilotons. The explosions caused by SCP-6057 do not produce sounds typical of large explosions, but instead produce a loud popping sound, followed by what has been identified as a party blower. Additionally, explosions leave behind a large amount of confetti, the source of which is unknown. SCP-6057 is capable of reforming itself following explosions and does not appear to suffer damage as a result of exploding.\n\n\nSCP-6057 suffers from extreme anxiety and is prone to exploding when agitated or upset.\n\n\nAddendum 6057.01:\n Note found upon discovery\n\n\nThe following note was found taped to the back of SCP-6057 upon discovery by Foundation agents. SCP-6057 was discovered following a string of unusual explosions in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area.\n\n\n\n\nHi, kids! Now you are the proud owner of Se\u00f1or Boom, who is the Tiny Se\u00f1or line of Professor Funtastic! Try to collect all the fun for hours!\n\nLet your se\u00f1ors here for fun! Pick up all the se\u00f1ors, super fun! Fun for you! Fun of your friends!\n\n\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Boom!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Fluff!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Senor!!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Senorita!!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Fun!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Hole!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Pig!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Purple!\n\n\nSe\u00f1or Taste!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6057.02:\n Audio log from recent therapy session\n\n\nThe following is a recorded dialogue between Dr. Li and SCP-6057 during its most recent therapy session.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a06057.01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nLi:\n Good afternoon, Se\u00f1or Boom.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Uh, hello, doctor.\n\n\nLi:\n How are you feeling today?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I don't know. Good, I think? Is there a right answer?\n\n\nLi:\n No, there is no right answer. It's okay to not feel good, you know.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I-in that case I don't feel good. It feels too tight in here. These walls\u2026 they make me feel claustrophobic.\n\n\nLi:\n Maybe you could use a little change of scenery. Would you like for me to put in a request to take you outside?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n That would be nice\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n I think so too. Now, why don't we get started?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Okay.\n\n\nLi:\n Have you felt choked up again like you were last week?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n A little\u2026 I tried doing the breathing technique you showed me but I still felt overwhelmed.\n\n\nLi:\n This is normal. It happens. Remember, therapy isn't going to cure you immediately, its more about learning techniques to better help you manage yourself in case something does happen.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I know, I know, but\u2026 I always feel like I'm going to blow when you're not around, doctor.\n\n\nLi:\n You can manage without me. I'm here to help you, but I can't be your crutch forever. Why don't we try to focus on some positive things. Like your future trip outside! That sounds like it'll be fun. Fresh air always does the body good.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I don't like the air down here\u2026 it's so musty\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n Why don't we try focusing on something positive instead of what you don't like down here?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Okay\u2026 outside\u2026 outside\u2026 but, doctor, what if I blow up outside? They'll never let me go outside again\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n Try finding the positive side.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I'm trying! I'm trying! Sorry\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n There's no need to apologize. Just focus on the good that is going outside and how you'll like it. Use this as a goal to keep moving forward.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n But I have no way of knowing what's going to happen\u2026 How can I control myself if I don't know what can happen?\n\n\nLi:\n That's just the risk you take by living every day. You never know what's going to happen but you still need to get out there and live. Otherwise, you spend your whole life cloistered in your containment chamber. And I know you don't want to be in here all the time.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I don't\u2026 But\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n But?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n But\u2026 I don't know\u2026 Everything just feels so overwhelming and I know they're not going to approve me going outside so what's the point? I may as well just blow up and get it over with\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n Whoa, slow down there, Boom. You don't know that they are or aren't going to approve of letting you take a field trip outside. Remember, you haven't had a major explosion in three months. That's amazing progress! Don't sell yourself short.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n \u2026 but\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n If you keep thinking of all the 'what if' scenarios and 'buts' you'll never get any better.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n So I'm just not going to get any better then? Am I just doomed to be stuck here forever?\n\n\nLi:\n That's not what I said.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I know you didn't, but\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n You know how we feel about buts around here.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I know! I know! But I just can't help but feel like\u2026 I'm drowning\u2026 I'm drowning, doctor, and nothing I can do helps! Everything I've tried doesn't work and I feel like I'm failing you and I feel like I'm failing myself and I don't know! I'm sorry!\n\n\n[SCP-6057's fuse lights.]\n\n\nLi:\n Remember what we've talked about. Slow down. Deep breaths.\n\n\n[SCP-6057's fuse ticks down for a moment before it is defused. There is a brief silence between the two.]\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n You see what I mean, doctor? If you weren't here I would have exploded and probably taken out my room again\u2026 Let's face it, I'll never be able to go outside\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n The fact that you stopped yourself shows great progress. You alone were able to stop yourself from blowing up and causing trouble, and you alone are to credit for that. See? You are getting better.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I\u2026 I guess you're right\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n There you go, Se\u00f1or Boom. Remember, it's all about taking small steps. Today you took a big step and you should be proud of yourself for achieving that.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n But\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n No buts!\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\nNote: Dr. Li requested SCP-6057 be allowed outside following this interaction. The request was processed by the Ethics Committee and Containment Committee prior to being approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a06057.02\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-6057 was permitted to walk in the above-ground perimeter of Site-55.

You wouldn't be out here if it weren't for your amazing progress.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I\u2026 I guess so. Thank you, Doctor Li.\n\n\nLi:\n I'm just doing my job. So tell me, what's on your mind now that you're out here?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I want to feel the grass under my feet.\n\n\n[SCP-6057 steps off the lift platform and onto the grass.]\n\n\nLi:\n How's it feel?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Great! I\u2026 I feel great for the first time since\u2026 since\u2026 Since I was made.\n\n\nLi:\n I'm glad you're feeling good. Did you enjoy being outside in nature before you were contained?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Yeah\u2026 well, mostly. When I knew there would be no one around I would like to go outside and just feel the wind on my face. My dad told me not to go outside when there were people out because they would steal me away and that kind of made me nervous.\n\n\nLi:\n Your dad? Do you mean Professor Funtastic?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Is that what he called himself? I just knew him as dad\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n Please do go on. Sorry I interrupted.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n It's okay. Anyway, dad, he\u2026 he told me never to go outside or they would take me\u2026 It scared me, to be suddenly taken away from dad like that. That's why I didn't go outside for the first few weeks I was alive. I never knew who he meant by 'they' but I guess now I do\u2026 It was you guys.\n\n\n[There is a ten-second silence.]\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Anyway, I guess that's where it all started. Dad put the fear of being taken away in me\u2026 and he was right. I never should have stepped outside. But it got so lonely without him being there\u2026 I\u2026 I don't even know what I was looking for. I had never seen another person aside from dad before and\u2026 I was scared. I still am.\n\n\nLi:\n What are you scared of at present?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n I'm scared of him coming back and being mad at me for getting taken away. I just want him to be proud of me\u2026\n\n\nLi:\n I don't think he would be mad at you.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n Really? Even though I'm an anxious mess?\n\n\nLi:\n I don't think he would judge you for that. If anything I think he would be proud of you knowing how far you've come in controlling yourself.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n R-really?\n\n\nLi:\n Yes. You may struggle with your anxiety, but it does not define you. You're a good person and you should take it a little easier on yourself.\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n \u2026 I\u2026 thank you\u2026 \n[SCP-6057 sniffles.]\n\n\nLi:\n Are you crying?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n No! Yes\u2026 just a little.\n\n\nLi:\n It's okay to cry, Se\u00f1or Boom.\n\n\n[Both are silent for thirty seconds.]\n\n\nLi:\n It's a lovely day, isn't it?\n\n\nSCP-6057:\n You're right.

    "description": "SCP-6057 is an automaton made of polypropylene plastic resembling a cartoon stylization of a bomb. SCP-6057 is capable of exploding with a force of up to 14 kilotons. The explosions caused by SCP-6057 do not produce sounds typical of large explosions, but instead produce a loud popping sound, followed by what has been identified as a party blower. Additionally, explosions leave behind a large amount of confetti, the source of which is unknown. SCP-6057 is capable of reforming itself following explosions and does not appear to suffer damage as a result of exploding.",
