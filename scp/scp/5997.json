Please note that SCP-5997 does in fact currently exist \u2014 however, the majority of the following data is outdated and no longer applicable to the current state of the anomaly. Nonetheless, all revisions must be viewed to reach the current and accurate documentation.\n\n\nRevisions to text are denoted in \nblue\n for ease of reader comprehension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0VIEW\u00a0ORIGINAL\u00a0FILE\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0HIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5997\n\n\nLevel 4/5997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blister pack of mnestic tablets. Class-W.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5997 is currently considered self-containing; however, as it is poorly understood, new properties may emerge which would necessitate the development of additional containment measures. To facilitate a complete investigation into SCP-5997, Research Coalition (RC)-5997 has been formed under the supervision of the Antimemetics Division. Members of RC-5997 are required to remain on a daily regimen of mnestics and are to follow standard protocols for \nasynchronous research\n.\n\n\nAdditional duties for RC-5997 staff include monitoring the effects of SCP-5997 on all personnel known to use mnestics, including themselves. To this end, they are to undergo psychiatric evaluations and memetic influence checks on a weekly basis.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5997 is the active ingredient of all mnestics, a family of Foundation-developed drugs which improve memory. A liquid-soluble chemical stimulant, SCP-5997 targets the brain centers involved in memory retention to enhance cognitive function.\n\n\nAny quantity of SCP-5997 is inherently antimemetic \u2014 soon after being perceived or conceptualized, it is erased from human memory. As a result, it was not known to exist in any form for an unknown but likely extensive period of time, in spite of its central role in the production of mnestics. It has been determined that the antimemetic effect of SCP-5997 only triggers upon perception; as such, consumption of the substance paradoxically allows immunity to its own effects.\n\n\nDespite this, SCP-5997 was discovered only recently. The reason for this remains unclear.\n\n\nExtensive research has confirmed that SCP-5997 is biochemically non-anomalous, and causes no adverse side effects beyond those already known to result from the use of mnestics (nausea, increased risk of pancreatic cancer, frequent night terrors). Because of this, as well as SCP-5997's importance in the containment of numerous memory-affecting anomalies, the production and use of mnestics has tentatively been allowed to continue.\n\n\nThe origin of SCP-5997 is unknown. Currently, it is theorized that Foundation supplies of SCP-5997 are being provided by a third party external to the Foundation. As this would constitute a severe security breach, further investigations by RC-5997 are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0VIEW\u00a0REVISION\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0HIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5997\n\n\nLevel 5/5997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nThaumiel\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blister pack of mnestic tablets.

Additional duties for RC-5997 staff include monitoring the effects of \nSCP-5997-1\n on all personnel known to use mnestics, including themselves. To this end, they are to undergo psychiatric evaluations and memetic influence checks on a weekly basis.\n\n\nAn artificially intelligent construct (5997-Z24.aic) is to monitor Foundation databases for signs of the effects of SCP-5997 on information, and is to expunge any compromised data in order to prevent the spread of SCP-5997\u2019s effects.

All information specifically pertaining to SCP-5997 and SCP-5997-1 is to be heavily encrypted and maintained in secure data storage servers.

The exact nature of SCP-5997 is currently under investigation, but available evidence suggests it is sapient and possesses antimemetic properties of considerable strength.\n\n\nSCP-5997-1\n is a liquid-soluble chemical stimulant that improves memory when administered. Counterintuitively, \nSCP-5997-1\n is also inherently antimemetic \u2014 soon after being perceived or conceptualized, it is erased from human memory. \nSCP-5997-1\n is the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestic drugs, and was not known to be anomalous for a significant period of time due to its antimemetic properties affecting all Foundation personnel.\n\n\nThe existence of SCP-5997 was ascertained following extensive investigations by RC-5997, which determined that the origin and history of mnestic drugs could not be traced and that no record of the method by which they were produced existed. Additionally, it was found that all information that could have previously related to any of the mentioned topics (such as biochemical formulae and pharmaceutical diagrams) was subject to a severe \nantimemetic corrosion\n effect, which had irreversibly expunged nearly all relevant data and rendered the remainder unintelligible.\n\n\nNotably, it appeared that relevant information had been targeted precisely and deliberately, in a manner suggesting intelligent activity rather than random corruption. This implied the existence of a previously undocumented sapient entity with powerful antimemetic properties which had been actively impeding Foundation investigations into SCP-5997-1 for some time.\n\n\nThis discovery shortly led to the official re-designation of SCP-5997.\n\n\nAvailable evidence strongly suggests that Foundation supplies of SCP-5997-1 originate from SCP-5997, but the method of supply is unknown. Further investigations by RC-5997 are in progress. Containment of SCP-5997 is currently considered a Level 3 - \nHIGH\n priority, due to the ongoing security breach represented by its access to Foundation data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0VIEW\u00a0REVISION\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0HIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5997\n\n\nLevel 5/5997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Thaumiel\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blister pack of mnestic tablets.

The appearance and travel of SCP-5997-2 instances is also to be recorded. All efforts are to be made to determine the point of origin for SCP-5997-2 instances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5997 is the designation for an entity theorized to be the source of SCP-5997-1. The exact nature of SCP-5997 is currently under investigation, but available evidence suggests it is sapient and possesses antimemetic \nand reality-altering\n properties of considerable strength.\n\n\nSCP-5997-1 is a liquid-soluble chemical stimulant that improves memory when administered. Counterintuitively, SCP-5997-1 is also inherently antimemetic \u2014 soon after being perceived or conceptualized, it is erased from human memory. SCP-5997-1 is the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestic drugs, and was not known to be anomalous for a significant period of time due to its antimemetic properties affecting all Foundation personnel.\n\n\nSCP-5997 actively hinders Foundation investigations into the origins and properties of SCP-5997-1 by subjecting all data pertaining to the substance to a severe antimemetic corrosion effect. \nThe access of SCP-5997 to data is not absolute; it appears to be unable to affect sufficiently encrypted data stored in secure servers, allowing critical information about the anomaly to be retained.\n SCP-5997 has been active and operating outside of Foundation knowledge for an unknown, but presumably extensive, period of time.\n\n\nThe origin of Foundation supplies of SCP-5997-1 was previously not known. However, investigations performed by RC-5997 have uncovered new information; namely, the existence of a repeated anomalous event involving the sudden appearance of SCP-5997-1 samples in random Foundation supply sites worldwide. These anomalous events (designated 5997-DORO events) correspond with unexplained antimemetic corruption of security footage from the involved supply sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation supply outpost 171. SCP-5997-2 instances not pictured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs determined by trial-and-error analysis, live observation of 5997-DORO events by subjects dosed with mnestic drugs reveals the presence of multiple featureless humanoid entities (designated SCP-5997-2 instances). These entities are observed to enter the affected supply sites and deposit samples of SCP-5997-1.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-5997-2 are inherently antimemetic and cannot be perceived without the use of mnestics. Additionally, SCP-5997-2 instances carry multiple memetic triggers which induce an unconscious compulsion to collect, process and utilize samples of SCP-5997-1. A severe antimemetic clouding effect surrounds SCP-5997-2 instances; due to this, the exact details of a 5997-DORO event are difficult to ascertain or concretely record, even by subjects dosed with strong mnestics. However, it is known that 5997-DORO events invariably result in the rapid integration of all SCP-5997-1 samples into the Foundation supply chain.\n\n\nFollowing the cessation of a 5997-DORO event, all involved SCP-5997-2 instances will exit the supply facility and travel to a currently unknown location, hypothesized to be their point of origin. High-speed shutter photography has determined the speed of traveling instances to exceed 9\u00a0km/s.\n\n\nGiven the similar method of antimemetic censorship observed, it is highly probable that SCP-5997 is responsible for 5997-DORO events. Further research into 5997-DORO events and SCP-5997-2 instances is in progress. Locating and containing SCP-5997 is presently considered a Level 4 - \nEXTREME\n priority, due to the ongoing security breach represented by SCP-5997\u2019s unimpeded access to Foundation data and operations.\n\n\nThe covert implantation of a GPS tracking module into a select SCP-5997-2 instance in order to monitor its travel following a 5997-DORO event is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0VIEW\u00a0REVISION\u00a03\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0HIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem \u2116:\n SCP-5997\n\n\nLevel 5/5997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n Thaumiel\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blister pack of mnestic tablets.

A security task force is to be stationed 10m from the entrance to SCP-5997-3 at all times, and is to enforce a guarded perimeter around the location. Patrol teams are to bar civilians from approaching within a 30m radius of SCP-5997-3 using the cover story of a recent cave-in rendering the location restricted and hazardous to approach.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5997 is the designation for an entity theorized to be the source of SCP-5997-1.

Additionally, SCP-5997-2 instances carry multiple memetic triggers inducing an unconscious compulsion to collect, process and utilize samples of SCP-5997-1.\n\n\nThe arrival of SCP-5997-2 instances at Foundation supply outposts denotes the occurrence of a 5997-DORO event, during which instances will deposit samples of SCP-5997-1 in several secure cargo holds. Due to a severe antimemetic clouding effect surrounding SCP-5997-2 instances, the exact details of this process are difficult to ascertain or concretely record, even by subjects dosed with strong mnestics. However, it is known that the memetic triggers carried by SCP-5997-2 instances invariably result in the rapid integration of all deposited SCP-5997-1 into the Foundation supply chain.\n\n\nFollowing the cessation of a 5997-DORO event, all participating SCP-5997-2 instances will exit the involved supply facility and travel at speeds exceeding 9\u00a0km/s to their assumed point of origin, SCP-5997-3. The exact location of SCP-5997-3 has been conclusively determined via covert GPS tracking of a select SCP-5997-2 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to SCP-5997-3, prior to containment efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5997-3 is a cavern located on the north face of Mt. Helicon in Boeotia, \nGreece\n. A section of SCP-5997-3 is open to the air and contains a single fissure 315\u00a0mm from the mouth of the cave, which is connected to a subterranean freshwater aquifer. The water originating from this aquifer collects in a marble bowl placed nearby; it is regularly removed by SCP-5997-2 instances prior to 5997-DORO events.

Just wiped the mind of anyone who read it. Or that was what we thought at first. Thing is, we eventually realized we couldn\u2019t expunge it. It kept remaking itself, and then it started duplicating. Before long, it was spreading. It got into the rest of the database, spammed lethal cognitohazards and infohazards everywhere, wiped the original 5997 file and almost every redundant backup we had. We were frantically expunging left and right, but we just couldn\u2019t keep up with the thing. When it made the jump to our paper records, that was the end. Too many people saw them.

Class-W.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The actions of Field Agent Theodore Ferndale in the line of duty have enabled a set of theoretical containment procedures to be devised. SCP-5997 is considered self-containing provided all Foundation personnel follow the detailed procedures.\n\n\nResearch into the active ingredient, properties, history and origins of mnestic drugs is not to be carried out, so as to maintain the docile state of SCP-5997. The recently formed Research Coalition RC-5997 has been summarily disbanded, and all participating personnel have been reassigned to separate sites. An artificially intelligent construct (5997-A42.aic) is to passively monitor Foundation databases for signs of the effects of SCP-5997 and alert all personnel assigned to SCP-5997 in the event that signs are observed. Foundation databases are currently entirely unaffected by SCP-5997.\n\n\nFurther investigation into the nature and motivations of SCP-5997 is forbidden.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5997 is a sapient \nessophysical\n entity responsible for the production and distribution of SCP-5997-1, the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics. Based on recovered data, the physical form of SCP-5997 is an active infohazard with adverse effects on human cognition. SCP-5997 possesses reality-altering abilities of uncertain scope, which it mainly uses to spread a form of powerful antimemetic corruption. It is theorized to be motivated by a desire to render humanity at large ignorant to its own existence while simultaneously providing humanity a method of perceiving and responding to antimemetic anomalies in the form of SCP-5997-1.\n\n\nThe existence of SCP-5997 was ascertained following the discovery of a decomposing human cadaver within the DEEPWELL server vault in Site-74. Cause of death was found to be total cerebral liquefaction. Credentials found on the cadaver identified it as a Field Agent Theodore Ferndale; notably, there was no individual named Theodore Ferndale in employment as a field agent at that time, and database inspection did not uncover any records of such an individual ever working for the Foundation. However, verification keys on the credentials were matched to a personnel file which was valid but illegible due to severe informational corrosion.\n\n\nThe cadaver was found to be carrying a computer hard drive, evidently physically removed from a DEEPWELL server block, which contained all above data on SCP-5997. Following extraction and decryption of the data, a preliminary investigation verified that all described events had occurred in baseline reality with 99.9% certainty.\n\n\nThe reasoning behind the contradictory motivations of SCP-5997 is unclear. Further investigation into the matter has been deemed impractical due to the documented tendency of SCP-5997 to become aggravated when directly confronted. It is theorized that the Foundation has discovered the existence of SCP-5997 one or more times previously, and that improper conduct has resulted in the repeated erasure of all memory of these discoveries by SCP-5997. Furthermore, it is considered likely that numerous personnel \u2014 including Theodore Ferndale \u2014 were removed from human memory by SCP-5997 and remain forgotten at present.\n\n\nIt is therefore imperative that the ultimate nature and goals of SCP-5997 remain unknown.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverseer Council Memorandum\n\n\n\n\nThere are those who have criticized the decision to halt investigations into the motivations of SCP-5997, citing our policies against unnecessary concessions to anomalies. To tell the truth, I did not think it would need to be said, but allow me to clarify nonetheless: these measures are \ncrucially\n necessary.\n\n\nAs an essophysical entity, SCP-5997 exerts a phenomenal effect on our universe merely by existing; furthermore, it is clearly temperamental, difficult to communicate with, and documented to respond poorly to both investigative attempts and negotiation efforts. Therefore, the only alternative to our current containment procedures is neutralization \u2014 and beyond being near-completely unworkable, the termination of an essophysical entity would have grave and far-reaching repercussions.\n\n\nWhether SCP-5997 is truly acting in the best interests of humanity, or even if it believes itself to be doing so, is uncertain. All that is known is that we have narrowly freed ourselves from a cycle of remembrance and forgetting that may well have repeated for as long as our Foundation has existed, or even \nbefore it\n. Our tenuous, limited hold on comprehension of SCP-5997's existence is too valuable to risk losing, and it would be all too easy for SCP-5997 to discover our knowledge of it, wipe it away once more, and render our containment efforts null and void.\n\n\nThe actions of Agent Ferndale were certainly honorable, and he performed the ultimate sacrifice to allow us this information. However, in one crucial aspect he was quite wrong: some mysteries are better left unsolved.\n\n\n\u2014 \nO5-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5996\n | SCP-5997 | \nSCP-5998\n \u00bb",

        "I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019m recording this in what\u2019s left of the file they\u2019re keeping in the DEEPWELL server in [DATA CORRUPTED], but it\u2019ll break into here too sooner or later. I dosed myself with the last syringe of Class Z mnestics, so it can\u2019t get to me without killing me outright. We have to know what happened. If anyone out there still remembers, read this while you can. It was the fucking camcorder log. I don\u2019t know how RC-5997 never figured that out. Or maybe one of them did, and the poor bastard just didn\u2019t get a chance to tell anyone before it got him. Anyway, what that thing said at the end was a low-level infohazard. Just wiped the mind of anyone who read it. Or that was what we thought at first. Thing is, we eventually realized we couldn\u2019t expunge it. It kept remaking itself, and then it started duplicating. Before long, it was spreading. It got into the rest of the database, spammed lethal cognitohazards and infohazards everywhere, wiped the original 5997 file and almost every redundant backup we had. We were frantically expunging left and right, but we just couldn\u2019t keep up with the thing. When it made the jump to our paper records, that was the end. Too many people saw them. She reached into their minds, made them hers and turned them against us. RC-5997 is almost gone now. They\u2019ve just been losing people, one by one. Some kind of acute antimemetic contamination, I think, making sure nothing they do will ever have an effect on the world again. The Class Z is the only reason I can even remember any of that, and not even it will let me see them anymore. Everyone else is forgetting. And I mean everyone. The entire Foundation. We\u2019re all forgetting her, everything to do with her, and it\u2019s exactly what she wants. [DATA CORRUPTED]eally gave us mnestics because she wanted us to remember, why did it have to end like this? Why does she have to make us forget again? Are we not even allowed to remember why? No. No, no, no. Fuck this, fuck her. I'm [DATA CORRUPTED] this stand. No one is allowed to play with humanity's minds like this. Mysteries are meant to be solved, not to be left alone forever and forgotten. Someone, somewhere, sometime, is going to see this, and they'll figure it out. I'll make sure of it. I\u2019ll break the cycle.

    "description": "SCP-5997 is a sapient essophysical entity responsible for the production and distribution of SCP-5997-1, the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics. Based on recovered data, the physical form of SCP-5997 is an active infohazard with adverse effects on human cognition. SCP-5997 possesses reality-altering abilities of uncertain scope, which it mainly uses to spread a form of powerful antimemetic corruption. It is theorized to be motivated by a desire to render humanity at large ignorant to its own existence while simultaneously providing humanity a method of perceiving and responding to antimemetic anomalies in the form of SCP-5997-1.",
