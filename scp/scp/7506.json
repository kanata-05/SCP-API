The soleplate is heavily dented and covered in various burn marks.\n\n\nWhile SCP-7506 is plugged in and switched on, contact between its soleplate and any clothing will cause an audible scream to vocalise from the latter while contact is maintained. The screams will match that of a human, varying in tone and pitch depending on the intended body type the clothing was designed for.\n\n\nTesting log:\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n An adult man\u2019s tailored suit\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n Deep pitched scream, similar to that of an adult male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n An adult woman\u2019s polkadot sundress\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n High pitched scream, similar to an adult female.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A boy\u2019s plain white t-shirt\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n High pitched scream, masculine undertones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A young girl\u2019s shirt\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n High pitched, feminine scream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A white lab coat\n\n\nNote:\n Item belonged to Head Researcher, Dr. Miles.\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n Low pitched scream, identical to Dr. Miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A young boy\u2019s shirt, heavily torn (Recovered from SCP-7506\u2019s original location)\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n High pitched scream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n Same torn shirt from previous test\n\n\nNote:\n Contact between SCP-7506 and the garment lasted longer than in previous tests.\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n Screams remained unchanged for the first thirty seconds. Vocalisations gradually became quieter over the next three minutes, until ceasing completely. Only infrequent, hushed murmuring would occur until the test's conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A teenage girl\u2019s yellow sweater with burn marks matching SCP-7506\u2019s soleplate present on the back left shoulder area.\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n High pitched screams between stretches of heavy breathing. Vocalisations were slightly muffled, as if emanating through clenched teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A man\u2019s grey tailored suit, immaculately kept\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n Audible murmuring, barely noticeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n A woman's blue dress, covered in multiple stitchings from repairs.\n\n\nResulting Vocalisation:\n Silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7506\n\" by Penton, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
