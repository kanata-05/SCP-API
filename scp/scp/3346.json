Testing is to be approved by SCP-3346's primary researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3346 is a plastic child-size hard hat. The hat is a toy manufactured by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Company in 1986 and is not suitable to be used as protective equipment. SCP-3346 shows signs of wear consistent with gentle use. There is a piece of yellow construction paper taped to the inside dome of SCP-3346 (see addendum 1).\n\n\nWhen an individual puts SCP-3346 on their head, they experience a non-sight-based sensation. These sensations are related to significant anxieties the subject wearing SCP-3346 experienced as a child between the ages of 4-6. Frequently these are audio or physical sensations; however, no one in the experimentation chamber but the subject is able to experience the sensation. After removal of SCP-3346, most subjects report feeling much better about the incident and able to handle further exposure to the anxiety-inducing event.\n\n\nExperimentation Log:\n Approval for testing using individuals under the age of 18 is pending. All testing until such a measure is approved is to be done by adults. Testing is to be conducted by instructing the subject to wear SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then remove and offer commentary on their experience.\n\n\n\n\nTest Subject:\n D-84269\n\n\nTesting:\n D-84269 puts on SCP-3346. Subject looks confused, then at 34 seconds begins laughing. Subject removes SCP-3346 at 60 seconds.\n\n\nCommentary:\n \"Macaroni salad! I tasted macaroni salad! God, I hated macaroni salad when I was a kid, it scared me to death! I thought it was little worms!\"\n\n\nLong-term Results:\n D-84269 was provided with a bowl of macaroni salad and immediately began to eat it. Following consumption, D-84269 commented, \"I haven't thought about the worms thing in years. Isn't that funny? It was so serious back then.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Subject:\n Dr. Theodora Wu\n\n\nTesting:\n Dr. Wu wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then removes.\n\n\nCommentary:\n \"I could smell flowers. My sister died when I was four, she was eight.\" (Pause) \"They covered her coffin in flowers. I had a panic attack at the funeral. I still can't stand dahlias, they were her favorite.\"\n\n\nLong-term Results:\n Dr. Wu self-reported increased visits to R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Cemetary where her sister is buried. Most recent report indicated Dr. Wu brought dahlias with her, as \"They \nwere\n her favorite.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Subject:\n Dr. Charles L. (request to remain anonymous)\n\n\nTesting:\n Dr. L. was chosen as his psychological profile indicated being raised in an abusive household. He is instructed to wear SCP-3346 for the full 60 seconds. Dr. L. wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, displaying extreme discomfort throughout, then removes and throws across the room.\n\n\nCommentary:\n Dr. L. was initially unable to respond to researcher queries, but after calming down claimed he \"felt him hit me again.\" Dr. L. was overcome again and unable to elaborate.\n\n\nLong-term Results:\n Dr. L. was issued weekly Foundation-sponsored therapy and has been able to face some of the difficulties he endured as a child. When asked, Dr. L. commented, \"It's hard. It's going to take time. But I'm glad I'm facing it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a03346-1\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3346-1:\n SCP-3346 was discovered with the following note taped inside.
