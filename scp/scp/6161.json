    "all_text": "Everything is cake.\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+164\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6161\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6161 is to be kept in a standard secure objects locker in \nSite-55\n. It is unknown if the object's container has become an SCP-6161-1 instance, but this has been labeled acceptable. Personnel handling SCP-6161 are to only touch the object's hilt, avoiding the blade.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6161 is a cake knife, measuring 23\u00a0cm in length and made of steel. When SCP-6161 is used to cut an object, it is capable of slicing through any material with ease. Objects cut by SCP-6161 will transform into instances of SCP-6161-1.\n\n\nSCP-6161-1 instances will continue to exhibit baseline traits on their exterior, but their interiors consist entirely of cake. The cake within SCP-6161-1 instances has been reported to possess various different flavors.\n\n\nAddendum 6161.01:\n Test Log\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 01\n\n\nObject Tested:\n Bar of Steel\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-6161 cut through the bar with ease. D-1221 was instructed to consume a slice of SCP-6161-1. The resulting flavor was reported as tasting \"earthy and metallic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 05\n\n\nObject Tested:\n Car Tire\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-6161 cut through the wheel with ease. D-1221 was instructed to consume a slice of SCP-6161-1\n1\n. The resulting flavor was reported as tasting \"oily, with a rubbery texture\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 11\n\n\nObject Tested:\n Dr. Greene's Laptop\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-6161 cut through the laptop with ease. D-1221 was instructed to consume a slice of the produced SCP-6161-1 instance\n2\n. The resulting flavor was reported as tasting \"[like] plastic with some crunchy bits\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 17\n\n\nObject Tested:\n Dr. Greene's Birthday Cake\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-6161 cut through the cake with ease. D-1221 was instructed to consume a slice of SCP-6161-1. D-1221 refused upon viewing the sliced cake, which had turned to gravel and stone. No flavor test results gathered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest:\n N/A\n\n\nObject Tested:\n N/A\n\n\nResult:\n Dr. Greene attempted to handle SCP-6161 for the next test but accidentally pricked his finger with the blade. Upon seeking first aid, it was discovered that SCP-6161 had not damaged Dr. Greene, but had affected him with its anomalous properties. Dr. Greene was immediately labeled an instance of SCP-6161-1\n3\n. The resulting flavor was reported as tasting \"almost like pork\".\n\n\n\n\nFurther testing with SCP-6161 has been restricted.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Despite having a slice cut out of it, the wheel maintained its structural integrity and did not deflate.\n\n\n2\n. Despite being transformed into an SCP-6161-1 instance, the laptop continued to function until a slice was removed from it, at which point it shut down.\n\n\n3\n. X-rays performed after the transformation confirmed that Dr. Greene's insides are now entirely composed of cake. It is unknown how he is able to retain life functions in this state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUncle Nicolini's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-MYSTERY-J\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7725\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-ES-357\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7833\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8725\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3085\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMDI-6726\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-PL-274\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4934\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2910-JP\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4206\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6467\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3756\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-ES-113\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-654\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nFuckmylife666\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParalytic States\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCold Turkey - A Prelude\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Coffins\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack, and leave your friends and go.\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Case of the Bathroom Cheese Labels\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing The Union\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#StormSite19\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's Ngo Helping This One\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas, Jude Kriyot\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI live my life as a palindrome.
