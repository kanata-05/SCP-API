Personnel assigned to the SCP-6307 project, Mobile Task Force Beta-17 \"Truck Freaks,\" and Logistics and Transportation Division Admin are the only individuals permitted to enter SCP-6307's containment unit for research and maintenance purposes. Technical personnel are mandated to refrain from tampering with or altering SCP-6307's current wiring setup.\n\n\nAny aberrations in SCP-6307's daily logs and any unusual supply requests are to be reported to the SCP-6307 team immediately.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6307 is a massive, sophisticated computer network built some time between the early 1970s and 1982. SCP-6307, in its current state, is made up of the following components:\n\n\n\n\nFive DataBank 1012 computers\n1\n, engraved with standard SCP Foundation identification.\n\n\nApproximately 0.5km worth of wiring and tubing, connecting the DataBanks to a central mainframe unit.\n\n\nA homebrew computer unit constructed from a hybrid of \nPrometheus Labs\n and DataBank 1012 computer parts. This unit is engraved with a \"Property of the SCP Foundation\" placard on its side.\n\n\nA terminal connected to the homebrew computer unit, with an LCD display, keyboard, and mouse, running an outdated version of the Foundation's current operating system and SkipNet\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6307 greatly assists in the monitoring, maintenance, and fulfillment of virtually all logistical matters pertaining to the Foundation. The system automates most processes regarding supply chain management, Site resupply, personnel transfer, and inventory logging, and maintains constant contact with every major Foundation Site in order to fulfill the supply demands of the Foundation as a whole.\n\n\nAlthough many of SCP-6307's components are outdated by modern technical standards, the system is capable of fully integrating with the rest of the Foundation, provided it achieves regular maintenance.\n\n\nSCP-6307 requires little human input in order to function properly. This is achieved in part due to an \nartificial intelligence construct\n housed within the network, a Class-IV Positive-Aligned Narrow Intelligence known as Sneed.aic. \n(See: History)\n\n\nSneed.aic, although sentient, is rather narrow-minded in its tasks, only ever choosing to speak if addressed directly. For this reason, and to maximize productivity, personnel assigned to SCP-6307 are advised to refrain from engaging in casual conversation with the AI.\n\n\n\n\nHistory:\n The construction of SCP-6307 began in 1968, when former RAISA computer technician Terry Sneed drafted a proposal to the O5 Council for Project Galactica, an effort to fully digitalize the Foundation's logistical records for ease of access and storage. While highly-promising on paper, Project Galactica was ultimately rejected, due to the then-superfluous costs associated with fully-digitizing the Foundation's records.\n\n\nHowever, the O5 Council would direct Sneed to Dr. Isaac Whitaker of the Logistics & Transportation division, whom had a similar goal in mind with his drastic reform of the department he now led. Sneed and Whitaker would later become founding members of the department, and would collaborate on a myriad of projects, including a prototype logistical computer network built inside Section A of the fledgling Site-122.\n\n\n\n\nTerry Sneed, circa 1970\n\n\n\n\nIn 1971, with approval of the O5 Council, Terry Sneed would acquire 5 Foundation DataBank 1012 computers, and began construction of what would later become SCP-6307. Originally unaided in his process, a number of L&T personnel would soon pitch in to the monumental effort, including Dr. Whitaker himself. Although some team members believed that Sneed's project was ultimately futile, costly, and time-consuming, Dr. Whitaker supported the project wholeheartedly, and personally assisted Sneed in constructing and testing SCP-6307 on multiple occasions.\n\n\nIn March of 1982, halfway through the construction of the SCP-6307 terminal, Terry Sneed would suddenly die in his sleep, and progress on the project froze. With an inspection date of May 1982 approaching, Whitaker took charge of the project and rushed its completion, referencing heavily from Sneed's rather incomprehensible notes and blueprints.\n\n\nDuring the inspection, it was discovered that SCP-6307's internal software and several hardware components had been modified through anomalous means to account for a 50% increase in processing power and data storage. In addition, an artificial intelligence construct identifying itself as Sneed.aic was present in the terminal, which no member of the team had any recollection of implementing whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6307.1:\n\n\nInitial Contact\n\n\nWith no way to properly verify Sneed.aic (then-designated as SCP-6307-B) as a Foundation-made program, SCP-6307 was officially registered as an anomaly in late May of 1982, and was placed into containment in Section A of Site-122. Dr. Whitaker was personally tasked with conducting an interview with SCP-6307-B to ascertain its directive and identify any other changes anomalously made to the machine.\n\n\n\n\n<<\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0INTERVIEW\u00a0#6307-01\u00a0>>\n\n\n\n\n>>\u00a0HIDE\u00a0EXCERPT\u00a0<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARCHIVAL RECORDING #6307-01\n\n\nARCHIVE DATE:\n MARCH 15, 1982\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Dr. Whitaker enters SCP-6307's containment unit.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n \n(Speaking into recording device)\n For the record.

He stops just in front of the homebrew computer unit, looking over it for a while, and sighs as he writes something atop the document on the clipboard.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n Good morning, SCP-6307-B.

SENSORS ARE NOT DETECTING MOVEMENT\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n \u2026Terry, you bastard. Is this a joke?\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B prints a large question mark on screen.]\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nNEGATIVE \u2014 THIS IS A SERIOUS INTERVIEW, DR. WHITAKER\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n So, am I'm just supposed to accept that you've somehow appeared in our hardware, and we're supposed to buy it? Is that it? Who the hell put you in here?\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nI HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO REQUEST ANOTHER INTERVIEWER? SEEM STRESSED IN TONE\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n \nStressed\n? For sure, because I've spent much of the last two months fixing something that my dead friend was too much of a recluse to elaborate on, while also pressed for time. Am I supposed to believe that he was working on an AIC without notifying me, or is there something else going on here, 6307-B? I've got no answers.\n\n\n[Dr. Whitaker appears visibly stressed and sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose.]\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nMY CONDOLENCES\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nWHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF TECHNICIAN TERRY SNEED?\n\n\n[Dr. Whitaker is silent for a moment.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n Dedicated. He was dedicated as hell. If there was anyone who believed in the Foundation and its potential for logistical might more than myself, it would have to be Terry. No one else believed in him more than I did, and no one else believed in me more than he did.\n\n\n[Dr. Whitaker sighs.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n But, he is gone, sadly. Passed away in his sleep suddenly, and no one knows why. All he's left is this computer you are housed in, and his notes.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n I apologize. How unprofessional of me.

CONSULT PAGE 103 OF THE NOTEBOOK IF YOU HAVE NOT\n\n\n[Whitaker opens up a leather notebook and flips to the page in question. He pauses as he looks over it for a moment.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n They're in a pentagram. How did we\u2014\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nNOT BY COINCIDENCE. EVERY DECISION MADE BY ME HAS BEEN FOR A PURPOSE. THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES AS TO MY CURRENT CONDITION AND LACK OF PHYSICALITY WERE AN UNFORSEEN INCIDENT. BUT WITH ADDITIONAL PROCESSING POWER I WILL WORK PAST THIS ROADBLOCK FOR SURE\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nI WISH TO RESUME ACTIVE SERVICE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY\n\n\n[Whitaker is silent for a few more seconds.]\n\n\n[WHITAKER:]\n Who are you, SCP-6307-B?\n\n\n[SCP-6307-B:]\n \nSNEED. TERRY SNEED\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the interview, SCP-6307-B, now officially verified as Sneed.aic, was returned to active duty. After a brief consultation with the Classification Committee, SCP-6307 was reclassified as Thaumiel, and a containment unit housing SCP-6307 in its entirety was constructed at Site-122.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6307.2:\n\n\nProject Update\n\n\nBelow is an update pushed by Dr. Whitaker regarding SCP-6307's performance on February 16, 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n SCP-6307 Staff, L&T Admin\n\n\nBcc:\n Overwatch Command\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Isaac Whitaker\n\n\nSubject:\n 6307 update 2/16/1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam,\n\n\nImpressive is an understatement. SCP-6307 remains in regular working order as of writing this message. Upon its completion and the integration of Sneed.aic, we saw positive results almost immediately. Throughput across the Foundation has increased drastically, and our delivery times have similarly decreased. This machine does not do \nall\n of the work for us, of course, but to call it useful is an understatement \u2014 it is \nvital\n. That is why, effective immediately, I am asking for the weekly maintenance checks to now become daily maintenance checks. Any abnormalities are to be reported and dealt with.\n\n\nFollowing the installation, though, I noticed a few oddities in SCP-6307's daily reports, as well as a few unusual requests. There is definitely something strange and peculiar to the machine's mannerisms. One noteworthy example is when I found out it had transferred a great deal of its maintenance staff to Armed Site-21, requesting an equal transfer of technicians from AS-21 to our Site in return.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I've assigned Mobile Task Force Beta-17 \"Truck Freaks\" to follow up on any unusual requests and their intended destination. Should any more of these discrepancies become known to me, I will push out an additional update.\n\n\nDr. Isaac Whitaker\n\n\n\n\nSite-122 Director\n\nLogistics & Transportation Division Director\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6307.3:\n\n\nAdditional SCP-6307 Correspondence\n\n\nAlthough SCP-6307 remained in regular operation for much of the 90s and onwards, its hardware still remained vastly outdated; old and nearly incompatible with newer, more experimental systems. With the rest of the Foundation speedily digitalizing their systems and records, SCP-6307 was steadily upgraded with more antiquated software and hardware, though its setup remained mostly unchanged.\n\n\nOn 7/18/1998, a heated email exchange between Director Whitaker and Dr. Marcus L. Crassus of Armed Site-21\n3\n was observed, regarding a few incidents in SCP-6307 and its behavior.\n\n\nBelow is the exchange in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n<<\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0CORRESPONDENCE\u00a0#6307-01\u00a0>>\n\n\n\n\n>>\u00a0HIDE\u00a0EXCERPT\u00a0<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n L&T Admin, Dr. Isaac Whitaker\n\n\nFrom:\n Dr. Marcus L.

So, when an important component for 5778's containment efforts goes missing, I am sure that you can understand how frustrated I am beginning to feel about the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Order #9811703, 7/11/1998\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem Name\n\n\nQuantity Requested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Gate Components\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis order, which I have requested to be overnighted, has not shipped for a week.

We are a team, and we should not be bickering with each other.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Beta-17 \"Truck Freaks\" has looked into your order and found that it has been delivered to an L&T Warehouse in Boulder, in which it has remained for approximately a week.

That warehouse has remained \nyour\n responsibility ever since we transferred control of it to Site-122\u2026 a year ago. SCP-6307's usefulness is not to be underappreciated, but its antiquated hardware and glitches are something that is becoming most concerning with me.

I understand logistics just as much as you do, and the importance of it.\n\n\nMy concerns are valid, given the importance of both our sites as cornerstones in the Foundation logistics network. If you have never gotten around to addressing all of SCP-6307's problems until \nnow\n, you are effectively putting a band aid fix on a severed limb. Your retrofits can only keep it afloat and up to date for so long.

I apologize for my heated behavior, but this is no laughing matter.\n\n\nYou were in the Foundation for much longer than me, and you have seen it grow into a truly global organization. The fact that you've been giving a ghost the responsibility of operating a computer which automates all of our logistics raises many, many more concerns for me. You have been giving it enormous amounts of power and responsibility \u2014 what will happen if a hostile group decides to take advantage of it?\n\n\nI've got no clue as to what goes on with that machine, and nor do I know why things are moved around to apparently random locations, rather than straight to the site.

        "Addendum 6307.1:\nInitial Contact\nWith no way to properly verify Sneed.aic (then-designated as SCP-6307-B) as a Foundation-made program, SCP-6307 was officially registered as an anomaly in late May of 1982, and was placed into containment in Section A of Site-122. Dr. Whitaker was personally tasked with conducting an interview with SCP-6307-B to ascertain its directive and identify any other changes anomalously made to the machine.\nFollowing the interview, SCP-6307-B, now officially verified as Sneed.aic, was returned to active duty. After a brief consultation with the Classification Committee, SCP-6307 was reclassified as Thaumiel, and a containment unit housing SCP-6307 in its entirety was constructed at Site-122.",
        "Addendum 6307.2:\nProject Update\nBelow is an update pushed by Dr. Whitaker regarding SCP-6307's performance on February 16, 1984.\n.",
        "Addendum 6307.3:\nAdditional SCP-6307 Correspondence\nAlthough SCP-6307 remained in regular operation for much of the 90s and onwards, its hardware still remained vastly outdated; old and nearly incompatible with newer, more experimental systems. With the rest of the Foundation speedily digitalizing their systems and records, SCP-6307 was steadily upgraded with more antiquated software and hardware, though its setup remained mostly unchanged.\nOn 7/18/1998, a heated email exchange between Director Whitaker and Dr. Marcus L. Crassus of Armed Site-21 3 was observed, regarding a few incidents in SCP-6307 and its behavior.\nBelow is the exchange in its entirety.",
