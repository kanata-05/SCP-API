As of \n6/27/2022, forty-nine (49)\n personnel are in long-term assignment to SCP-7134 operations, lead by Head Researcher Dr. Yago Morro, PhD. and Head Tactician Captain Jackson Baxters (both Lv. 4 Clearance).\n\n\nMobile Task Force Sampson-7 \"Bugsy's Bunny\" has been organized for the securement of 7134-Events. Intercepted communications, surveillances, or other media pertaining to SCP-7134 and 7134-Events are to be followed up on by MTF Sampson-7 to conduct the securement of the 7134-Event, and the demanifestation or termination of SCP-7134. Attempts to contain extant SCP-7134 are not to be made unless approved prior to mission by Head Tactician. Miscellaneous reports of anomalous rabbits forwarded by field agents and web crawlers (per standard cryptid investigation protocols) are under further review to determine undocumented 7134-Events requiring securing.\n\n\nThe Weather-Gamble Cross-Positioning (WGCP) System is in operation for the designed purpose of locating meteorological activity in relation to gambling establishments within the continental United States of America, and for cataloging viable locations for 7134-Events. In the field tracking of SCP-7134, personnel are advised to use \nKant counters\n to assist in locating extant specimens.\n\n\nAll SCP-7134 in containment are deceased. Eighty (80) cadavers are in cryogenic storage at: Site-19; \nSite-43\n; Site-66; Site-104. Four (4) taxidermies are on display at: \nSite-87\n; \nSite-169\n.\n1\n Additional cadavers are to be disposed of as level 0 biological material following autopsy unless reserved for future study.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7134 is a mammalian species of leporine morphology with cervine traits (\nLepus antilocapra\n), analogous to the \"jackalope\" of North American folklore. Aside from the chimeric nature of the species, specimens have exhibited unexplained abilities including: intangibility; cognitohazardous compulsion; sentience; sapience; capability of speech for the utilization of language; low-end reality-bending; probability-alteration or short-term clairvoyance, and preservation of a single identity through reincarnation or gestalt consciousness.\n\n\nSightings of SCP-7134, designated 7134-Events, are scarce yet regularly occurring under predictable circumstances. Observation of over seven hundred (>700) confirmed 7134-Events has identified three universal constants, as the phenomenon occurs exclusively:\n\n\n\n\nwithin the continental United States of America,\n\n\nwithin the property lines of establishments host to gambling,\n\n\non the night of a full moon.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional criteria for loci of 7134-Events are under consideration. While manifestation of an SCP-7134 instance has not been directly observed, specimens have always been in the vicinity of at least one (1) conscious person for a 7134-Event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf \nThe next 7134-Event is projected for:\n \nJuly 13th, 2022. (7134-Event-07132022)\n \u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHE NEVER DID A WHOLE DAY'S WORK IN HER LIFE\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7134\u00a0Physiology\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdult SCP-7134's physiology is standard for that of female specimens found in the genus \nLepus\n,\n2\n in exception to the presence of two (2) horns emerging from the head, ranging 12.2-18.5\u00a0cm (4.8-7.4 in.) in length.\n3\n Aside from this chimeric appearance, the external anatomy is entirely non-anomalous. Autopsies have found that the internal anatomy (especially the nervous, respiratory, reproductive systems) does not have any physical abnormalities that can be attributed as cause for SCP-7134's anomalous properties.\n\n\nGenetic analysis of SCP-7134 has produced mixed results. Analysis of soft tissue and bodily fluids indicates the species is closely related to \nLepus alleni\n.\n4\n Analysis of hard tissue (horns and other) is identified as near identical to that of \nAntilocapra americana\n.\n5\n Aside from horns, bone structure is as expected of leporids. How SCP-7134 persists despite the incompatibility of these biologies is unknown. All inspected instanced have invariably been female, and the mitochondrial DNA is completely identical in said instances. Expression of phenotypes vary between instances, as they may range in weight; size; coat color; coat pattern; horn length; and other minutiae. It is also noted that SCP-7134 is genetically distinct from \nSCP-6968\n-2-C, and no instances have been found to be diseased by \nKappapapillomavirus 2\n6\n or similar.\n\n\nReproduction, development, and maturation of SCP-7134 is unverified. Due to similar biology compared to \nLepus alleni\n, SCP-7134 is projected to have a gestation cycle of approximately six weeks, and conception requires a compatible male specimen of identical or related species. Alternate hypotheses of parthenogenesis and/or tachygestation are also considered. Formation of the skeleton indicates that bone development occurs at rates expected for \nLepus alleni\n, and encountered adults are two years (2 yrs.) of age on average. SCP-7134 are noted to be highly physically active despite pregnancy, and have not exhibited notable hindrances in mobility either before or after giving birth.\n\n\nSCP-7134 can produce litters of up to seven (7) leverets, averaging at four (4). Stillbirths have not been observed. Leverets exhibit several physiological properties not seen in adults, nor any non-anomalous fauna. SCP-7134 brood have been impermeable to matter in all observed cases, and any attempts to restrict with them have produced no results. Leverets appear translucent blue when viewed directly, and can only be detected by energy-based imaging systems. Despite no recognizable source for photon emission, leverets are moderately luminescent and vary in brightness \u224830-80 candelas.\n\n\nWhile most lagomorphs are altricial and nidicolous, SCP-7134 inversely is highly precocial and nidifugous, more so than any other \nLepus\n species. Newborn SCP-7134 are appear far more physical developed than other newborn leporids, possessing an apparent morphology analogous of a non-anomalous \nLepus alleni\n leverets two weeks (2 wks.) in age, only with addition of velveted antlers \u22481\u00a0cm (0.4 in.) in length. These broods are capable of locomotion upon birth, and if provided nesting, will leave the nest within hours. Strangely, SCP-7134 leverets experience half of what gravitational acceleration would be expected of an organism of their size (g = 4.13\u00a0m/s\u00b2), and can retain traction in air, directing themselves as done for terrestrial locomotion.\n\n\nFor their incorporeal nature, newborn SCP-7134 specimens are classified as Class-II Apparitions.\n7\n Adult specimens are currently classified as Class-IV, with potential to be reclassified as Class-V. Adult SCP-7134 have an above average Hume reading of \u2248146 Hm, and newborn SCP-7134 commonly have a below average Hume reading of \u224887 Hm, which may rise to average or above average levels following the death of their mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7134\u00a0Ethology/Psychology\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthology of SCP-7134 has not been observed outside of 7134-Events. Limited interactions between SCP-7134 and their brood have been observed, but an affinity to socialize with humans is prominent. As instances perform socialization with awareness of themselves and others; discerning of their actions; absence of individuality; recollection of experiences and information exclusive to previous instances, SCP-7134 definitively possesses sapience in the form of either a gestalt entity or a reincarnating consciousness. As a species with a single known consciousness, critical threat should be exposed to an infohazard. Application of lethal cognitohazards have shown to only effect an individual.\n\n\nSCP-7134 are capable of human speech despite the absence of necessitated anatomy. Adult instances have been observed to speak with fluency in English, Spanish, French, Ojibwe, and Mandarin, with limited to inexistent comprehension of other languages. Conversations with instances have shown SCP-7134 capable perceiving and replicating tones and vocalics used in speech for appropriate meta-communication; non-anomalous leporid vocalics; laughter; and on select occasions, singing. Voices of SCP-7134 are commonly described as feminine, but accents vary between instances and are often endemic (if not, prevalent) to the area the instances are encountered in.\n\n\nThe SCP-7134 consciousness is acutely aware of their perpetuating nature. SCP-7134 recognizes herself as a singular identity inhabiting several organisms that lack intellectual autonomy between members of their species. There is plausibility that SCP-7134 is in actuality reincarnating within her own lineage and is under the erroneous belief she is a gestalt. When speaking with humans, SCP-7134 uses grammatical person to reflect the physical individually of SCP-7134 specimens, active instances refer to their being in the first-person with present tense, referring to past or future instances in first- or third-person with appropriate tenses, and clarifying familial relation between does and leverets. Per comments from instances, SCP-7134's gender identity is currently accepted as female. If SCP-7134 is a gestalt entity, it is uncertain if the gestalt identifies the entirety of itself as female, or just all encountered instances as they are biologically female.\n\n\nAdult SCP-7134's behavior is highly Machiavellian, as instances conduct themselves differently depending on the human social environment. Psychoanalysis of SCP-7134's personality has found her exemplative of psychopathy, with a grading of 35/40 in accordance to the Psychopathy Checklist\u2014revised (PCL-R).\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the \"boldness\" trait, SCP-7134 possesses a high tolerance for stress and fear, and is regularly assertive and confident in her actions. She has little regard for danger and unfamiliarity due to effective immortality, acting without reservation sometimes to the point of being suicidal. SCP-7134 appears to only practice self-preservation for sake of personal experience, and can show apathy or lack of urgency towards raising their brood.\n\n\nRegarding the \"disinhibition\" trait, SCP-7134 has considerable but finite restraint. Whether the circumstances of a 7134-Event are arranged through planning and foresight on her part or anomalously fabricated, SCP-7134 regardless can restrain herself to a certain set of behaviors for hours in the presence of others. If SCP-7134 reaches a point where she does not see necessity for patience, she will begin to act highly impulsive.\n\n\nRegarding the \"meanness\" trait, SCP-7134 greatly lacks empathy towards others, regularly hiding this from people unacquainted with her. She exercises exploitative tendencies to facilitate acts of cruelty, as she finds amusement from witnessing or inflicting misfortune upon a person. If SCP-7134 interacts with a person not considered susceptible to exploitation, she will verbally harass in order to distract or irritate.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7134 is also noted to have an affinity to humor (especially what is morbid or sadistic in nature) and will perform displays for the allurement of targets, distraction or irritation of opponents, or for generalized self-amusement.\n\n\nSCP-7134 also exhibits behaviors seen in other lagomorphs. The species' body language is mostly comprised of kinesics seen in \nOryctolagus cuniculus domesticus\n,\n8\n but instances have been observed positioning their heads in ways akin to humans mannerisms, including to maintain eye contact. SCP-7134 may redirect themselves to gather sustenance if a location provides food or is decorated with plants considered favorable. Aside from what is ordinarily consumable, some SCP-7134 have consumed food or materials that are inedible or toxic for hares, either through accident or intentionally. While SCP-7134 anatomy indicates the species involuntarily defecates, arguments have been made that SCP-7134 exhibits voluntary control.\n\n\nSCP-7134 exhibits nesting behavior largely similar to other lagomorphs, only instead of settling in low sheltered aboveground locations like other hares, SCP-7134 incentivizes locations that are difficult or rarely to be accessed by humans and often indoors. Nests constructed by SCP-7134 can be composed from materials commonly used by nesting does (grass, twigs, flower stems, fur from does' dewlap), but often include or are mainly comprised from unorthodox materials sourced through theft, battery, or destruction of property (paper currency, physicals documents, clothing, metal wiring, plastic tubing, rope fibers, flower petals, hair from other organisms).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udfe2\u00a07134-Event\u00a0Occurrence\u00a0\ud83d\udfe2\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince cataloging of 7134-Events was initiated, \n741 of 952\n projected events have been identified by the SCP Foundation. At least twenty (20) additional events have or are likely to have occurred prior to 1945. Liberal estimates state approximately 2,400 (cir. 1829) to 3,000 (cir. 1776) 7134-Events could have possibly occurred.\n\n\nFrequency of 7134-Events is highly regular, occurring every 684\u00b18 hours, or approximately every twenty-nine days (29 dy). The phenomenon is in a rough synchronization with the lunar month, always occurring on the date of a full moon, but not in an exact correlation to the moon's synodic period. Events can occur at any point in the day, most commonly during nocturnal hours. Due to the region in which SCP-7134 is endemic to spanning across four times zones, there is a contiguous twenty-seven hour period (27:00) in which an 7134-Event can initiate and terminate in.\n\n\nLocalization of 7134-Events is unnaturally confined, occurring only within the continental United States of America. Apparent distribution of SCP-7134 appears to be restricted not only by geographic borders, but also by legislative borders as defined by the federal and state governments. At no point has an extant SCP-7134 specimen been observed to emigrate over national land or ocean borders, but remains can be relocated out of country. SCP-7134 has not been observed in Alaska; Hawai'i; or any U.S. Territories, alive or dead. Due to varying state legislations, prevalence of 7134-Events most concentrated in states with unrestrictive gambling laws, but may still occur in states where gambling is highly regulated or outright illegal.\n9\n\n\n7134-Events exclusively occur at geographic locations that have had property lines determined by land surveyors, and are actively serving (at least in part) as a forum for humans to partake in gambling. Whether the gambling house is publicly listed or unlisted; legally or illegally operated is inconsequential. These locations may be coextensive with hotels, resorts, racetracks, parks, or country clubs. SCP-7134 are always first encountered within the property lines of the target location, where SCP-7134 will occupy for the duration of the event. SCP-7134 can leave properties of their own volition, although this will regularly result in the termination of 7134-Events.\n\n\nA correlation between local meteorological activity has been observed in most instances; over four hundred (>400) 7134-Events from 1972-2022 have been positively identified to have occurred at locations within a twenty-mile-radius (\nr\n =20 mi.) from landfall of a lightning strike produced within the preceding week. The probability of an event occurring is noted to increase in regards to the concentration of lightning strikes in an area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7134-Event\u00a0Progression\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the exact measures of a 7134-Event is highly unpredictable, 7134-Events follow a general series of phases with a primary point of deviation and a latent termination procedure that may initiate at any point during the event. This rough chronology is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n0. \u2014 The location of an 7134-Event will experience a substantial decrease in local Hume levels. \u2014 Hume levels can decline by up to 30 Hm. A Hume fluctuation can only be marked as the initiation of a 7134-Event upon confirmation of SCP-7134's presence.\n\n\n1. \u2014 An adult SCP-7134 pregnant with a litter will manifest within the property unobserved. \u2014 Manifestation of an SCP-7134 instance has never been directly observed. Absences in video evidence substantiates that SCP-7134 arrives at a location through anomalous means.\n\n\n2. \u2014 SCP-7134 will target a person or persons to interact with. \u2014 SCP-7134 will prioritize those who are either impaired; impulsive; or easily manipulated in some form. Subject most often targets an isolated person, and has not been observed to to approach a party greater than five (5) people.\n\n\n\nIF Phase 2 is conducted in full:\n\n\n\n\n3a. \u2014 SCP-7134 will approach the target(s) and converse. \u2014 SCP-7134 will conduct highly approachable behavior, often issuing complements or expressing humor. SCP-7134 will soon extend offers of companionship or advice.\n\n\n4a. \u2014 SCP-7134 will accompany the target(s) for activities involving risk taking to some degree. \u2014 Activities entail that the participants provided opportunity for profit either monetarily, socially, or emotionally. On occasions, SCP-7134 has fabricated scenarios for such risk taking.\n\n\n5a \u2014 Target(s) will experience success in activities for a prolonged period of time. \u2014 Targets usually benefit by following advice provided to them by SCP-7134, and progressively increase wagers. Local Hume levels will gradually rise over time, indicative of decreases in probability alteration.\n\n\n6a. \u2014 SCP-7134 will depart following or in anticipation of sudden substantial loss to at least one (1) person involved, most often the target(s). \u2014 Outcome may result in loss of wealth; social relations; employment; autonomy; or life. Those involved may be negatively impacted by the events of 7134-Events after a prolonged period of time, as much as years after incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIF Phase 2 is interfered with:\n\n\n\n\n3b. \u2014 SCP-7134 will be intercepted by an opposing party knowledgeable of it's activity/cognizant of it's anomalous nature. \u2014 In all relevant cases, this has been SCP Foundation personnel or amateur paranormal enthusiasts. It is unknown if other paranormal organizations have responded to 7134-Events.\n\n\n4b. \u2014 SCP-7134 will react to confrontation to some degree. \u2014 SCP-7134 will conduct antagonistic behavior, often issuing taunts or testing patience. SCP-7134 will soon attempt to relocate herself from confronter(s).\n\n\n5b \u2014 SCP-7134 will either have visual on it lost or sustain fatal injury. \u2014 Attempts to pursue SCP-7134 may result in traversal of environmental hazards; destruction of property; loss of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7a/6b. 7134-Event will terminate following the complete departure or neutralization of SCP-7134 instances, signified by restoration of Hume levels to baseline.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7134 will give birth to her litter at some point during the 7134-Event, either while extant or upon death. In some cases, SCP-7134 will attempt to find a location to create a nest to birth and house the litters for the remainder of event. In a completed nest, the SCP-7134 mother will give natural birth to the litter, which will remain in the nest until the mother either initiates the brood to evacuate the nest, leaves the property, or is terminated. If SCP-7134 is terminated before giving birth, the litter will be experience post-mortem birth by permeating outside of SCP-7134's womb. SCP-7134 brood will run in different directions.\n\n\nOperating with a local/personal Hume reading of \u224887/146, the adult SCP-7134 specimens qualify as a Class-I Reality Bender. SCP-7134's reality warping capabilities appears to primarily manifests as probability alteration, as SCP-7134 and those around her regularly experience convoluted or unrealistic circumstances that would otherwise be low-probability in baseline reality. These probability alteration are commonly prefaced by a declarative statement whose subject is ironic or predictive for the succeeding effects. SCP-7134's utilization of such statements is currently hypothesized to serve the purpose of an ontokinetic aid or \nsimilar device\n. There is no substantial evidence that SCP-7134 has manifested other more commonly exhibited Class-I reality warping capabilities such as ectoentropic or atomic manipulation.\n\n\nDespite the readily apparent anomalous nature of the species, viewers of adult SCP-7134 do not commonly take issue with the presence as would be expected. This is attributed to the emission of a pretermemetic cognitohazard; as no physical evidence for a source can be identified in SCP-7134's anatomy, this is a secondary manifestation of SCP-7134's reality warping capabilities. Viewers with a score of 7.4 or higher on the Cognitive Resistance Scale or with prior knowledge of SCP-7134 and 7134-Events will be able to accurately perceive the abnormality of the phenomena. Viewers who are ignorant or borderline knowledgeable about jackalope folklore will recognize SCP-7134 as a jackalope (or \"horned rabbit\" or \"antelabbit\"), but will remain (to varying extent depending on CRS score) significantly oblivious to how their encounter contradicts the apparent fictionality of cryptids as understood by the public. The pretermemetic effects will terminate completely upon neutralization of the adult SCP-7134 instance and its reality bending. SCP-7134 leverets do not exhibit the pretermemetic cognitohazard, as sightings will cause panic among civilians. There is evidence that SCP-7134 instances may exhibit probability alteration succeeding the termination of their mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7134 Taxidermy \u21164, restored. Pictured in Site-169 mess hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY:\n The earliest written record of a horned jackrabbit or similar cryptid in North America can be dated back to 1829, with the reported capture by a trapper named Roy Ball. It is unknown if this and many subsequent records of jackalope sightings were valid, as following the taxidermy of a supposed \"jackalope\" by brothers Douglas and Ralph Herrick in 1934,\n10\n the creature has become commonplace in American pop culture and rogue taxidermy. The oldest verified instance of SCP-7134 is a taxidermy mount dated to the 1870s (pictured), recovered from \na cottage in Westminster\n in 2012. The extent of the SCP-7134 species' relevancy with the whole of jackrabbits or similar folklore predating 1829 is unknown. \nRequest the Department of Mythology and Folkloristics for access to further reading on: jackalopes; North American cryptids; Anishinaabe traditional beliefs.\n\n\nThe SCP Foundation's earliest record of an SCP-7134 instance dates back to 1938, describing the recovery of a full-body taxidermy of a leporine species with horns found in the possession of an American associate of Marshall, Carter, & Dark Ltd. Surviving documentation indicates that the specimen was found and killed on the premise of an Atlantic City casino with known affiliations with MC&D. The whereabouts of Anomalous Object #343-LMRFDD and further documentation have since been lost.\n\n\nFoundation assets would not encounter an 7134-Event until July 25th, 1945. Field Agent Drew Lotts responded to the aftermath of a fire at a cardroom in Galveston, Texas. Lotts' investigation into an anomalous origin for the fire procured an eyewitness account of 7134-Event-07251945 (formerly Incident-7134-B), and recovery of type specimen, SCP-7134-07251945. SCP-7134 was added to the registry of SCP objects on July 28th, 1945. Following 7134-Event-01071947 (formerly Incident-7134-G) and discovery of phenomenon's correlation with the lunar cycle, manifestations of SCP-7134 were redesignated as 7134-Events, suffixed by date of occurrence.\n11\n\n\nMiscellaneous field agents and task force members would be redirected for SCP-7134 securement efforts until in November of 1973, when Mobile Task Force Sampson-7 \"Bugsy's Bunny\" was organized for the specialized response to 7134-Events, and potential anomalies localized to gambling establishment. Across eight decades of containment efforts, eleven (11) Foundation personnel have been killed in action, three (3) missing in action during 7134-Events.\n\n\nThrough observation and interactions with field agents, SCP-7134 has aggregated information to become knowledgeable of the SCP Foundation to a limited extent. SCP-7134 is currently believed to understand that the SCP Foundation:\n\n\n\n\nis a covert organization dealing with \"skips\",\n\n\nconsiders SCP-7134 a \"skip\",\n\n\nis in active opposition of SCP-7134 activity,\n\n\nhas a presence in all forty-eight (48) states of the continental U.S,\n\n\nhas at least five (5) task forces that have been assigned to SCP-7134 at some point,\n\n\nhas no current intent for capturing SCP-7134 alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM:\n Introduction to supplementary documents pertaining to SCP-7134.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\u00a0of\u00a0notable\u00a07134-Events\n\n\n\n\nCatalog\u00a0accessed\u00a0-\u00a0Contact\u00a0RAISA\u00a0for\u00a0complete\u00a0records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7134-Event 02/12/1960\n\n\nPike County Casino and Raceway, Pike, Pike County, Kentucky\n\n\nSCP-7134-02131960 ran out to the track during a horse race, disrupting placings, and resulting in a broken arm for Fred Polk (M, 37), jockey of No. 17 \"Tulips\".

Bodner on events of fire in Galveston, TX. 2 adult males, 1 unidentified anomaly killed. 1 adult male injured.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer - Drew Lotts, SCP field agent\n\n\nQuestioned - Lukas Bodner, civilian, suspected racketeer\n\n\n\n\nCAUSE\n \u2014 Gathering information from a witness to anomalous activity. Agent's efforts may ascertain the possible action of \"animal superspies\"\n17\n on American soil.\n\n\n\n\nLOTTS: Can you state your name for the record, sir?\n\n\nBODNER: Lukas Bodner.\n\n\nLOTTS: Mr. Bodner, I would like you to recount what you saw last evening if you can do that. The events of the fire at the address of 119 Hester Street.\n\n\nBODNER: I can do that.\n\n\nLOTTS: Okay. First of all, can you identify the two men that were in the room with you? Did you know them?\n\n\nBODNER: Yes, I knew them. Gideon Zussman and our manager, Henry Segre. We did business together.\n\n\nLOTTS: Were you doing business with Misters Segre and Zussman that evening?\n\n\nBODNER: I started when we were closing up for the night. We got the barflies out and Gideon and I were \u2014 well not Gideon, he felt himself too busy smoking a Cuban \u2014 I was cleaning down a table as Henry was counting the register.\n\n\nLOTTS: Counting the register. So these profits were from the bar?\n\n\nBODNER: That's what I said. Yes.\n\n\nLOTTS: This is the Free State, Mr. Bodner. I know a card den when I see one, and frankly, I don't know a cop in town who'd care to call it in. I'd prefer without the euphemisms for sake of clarity.\n\n\nBODNER: You don't know many people, because I'd think the hardasses out on Fort Crockett would care. As I said; we were counting the register. We were doing our dues when we heard a dame's voice call out to us. At first I thought it was one of our investor's girls, but how'd she get in with the front locked? So we look and there in the window \u2014 inside, at the bay windows \u2014 there was a rabbit! Only she had little deer horns on her head!\n\n\nLOTTS: Yes. I saw the body and even had a hard time believing.\n\n\nBODNER: It's strange enough to see a jackrabbit at the coast, let alone one that could talk and had horns. Because it talked. Again! Asked if \u2014 okay, she asked if she missed the cards. Had \"a hankering for a round of Three-Card Guts\" she said. Of course first thing for Gideon was, \"how is she to play if she doesn't have any hands?\" Henry made a good crack about her betting in bunny money, but she didn't like that. Like the dickens took a running start, bounced onto tables to get to Henry at the bar. Henry move back as he thought it was coming at him, but no, it banged the tin out of register, sending coin all over the floor.\n\n\nLOTTS: The animal was interested in the money?\n\n\nBODNER: Grabbed a dub\n18\n off the floor and ran around with it. Said she was broke so she'd bet with our money!\n\n\nLOTTS: Oh my.\n\n\nBODNER: I got the broom again and tried to hit the little rodent, but it was running between all the chair legs. Gideon got off his ass and soon him and Henry were shuffling around trying to grab her like a football. Ended up for nothing as one of us left the door to the back room open and it zoomed in there. First thing she did was knock a plant over, getting sod all over itself. Once we closed the three of ourselves in there with it, it was trying to get us to do circles around the table singing \"nanny nanny boo-boo\" until Gideon upturned a wastebasket and got her under it.\n\n\nLOTTS: The one the animal carcass was found in, yes?\n\n\nBODNER: That's the one. He got the thing under, sat on it, and went back to his smoke. He never put out his cigar, that idiot. Now the rabbit, she was howling. Sounded like my brother's wife when he'd come home drunk. Whining, cussing, calling us a bunch of schlimazels as it was trying to wiggle its way out. Crazy broad. It wasn't until after a moment of us catching our breath that we realized it; we had just caught ourselves a jackalope.\n\n\nLOTTS: A jackalope. That is certainly a rare feat, I would say.\n\n\nBODNER: Henry said we should sell her to The Greatest Show on Earth. I was all for that; it sounded like big money. \nWhat circus wouldn't want a real live jackalope?\n I pulled out the yellow pages to call them up. Now aside from the horns, it's pretty much just a jackrabbit. It eats and breaths, so until they came and bought her off us, Henry reckoned we had to care for her.\n\n\nLOTTS: You and Mr. Segre felt you were equipped for that?\n\n\nBODNER: With how fussy that thing was, I doubted we could find a way to feed it a few carrots,\n19\n as we aren't rabbit farmers. We're\u2014 we were business men. We just had to hold on for a day or two, I thought. Now then, it was when Henry was talking about giving it some water, when Gideon pepped up and said, \"Whiskey.\"\n\n\nLOTTS: Whiskey?\n\n\nBODNER: Yes. \"The prospectors back in Wyoming,\" he said, \"they would say a shot of whiskey will have jackalopes eating out of the palm of your hand. That they would lead people to gold.\" I wasn't too sure how much sense that made, and Henry looked to be mulling it over too when we saw that little thing, it had stopped fighting from its cage. It started acting like a dog begging for scraps! Pleading for whiskey.\n\n\nLOTTS: Really? Did you serve the jackelope whiskey?\n\n\nBODNER: No, not me. Henry went to the bottles we kept on the safe to pour a shot. I just went back to the pages when all of a sudden Gideon jumped up from the basket, yelling like it burned him. He hopped around like one of the Three Stooges, holding onto his leg right there, and bumped into Henry, knocking them both over. The bottle smashed against the wall, and then the cigar\u2014 the wallpaper went up in flames.\n\n\nLOTTS: Gideon's cigar?\n\n\nBODNER: It lit the alcohol on fire. The alcohol on them caught fire. They started screaming so I went to get help but the door\u2014 the knob broke in my hand. I tried ramming the door open, but I only roughed myself up doing that. It felt like God wanted me dead. That's when I phoned the fire department to get me out of there. The rug was burning. The plaster was burning. It was so fast, and then I couldn't hear Gideon screaming no more. But I heard that little thing was laughing. The second the fire started, it did. It was laughing while smoke was filling its little lungs, and until I passed out I could still hear that damned laugh. I pray that it burned with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\u00a0accessed\u00a0-\u00a0Contact\u00a0RAISA\u00a0for\u00a0associated\u00a0documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\u00a04/16/2003\u00a0(Excerpts)\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts\u00a0provided\u00a0-\u00a0Contact\u00a0RAISA\u00a0for\u00a0individual\u00a0records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Transcripts - 7134-Event-04162003 \n*(EX)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n April 16th, 2003\n\n\nLocation:\n Casa de San Cayetano, Belen, Valencia County, New Mexico\n\n\nInvolved Team(s):\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force \nIota-10 \"Damn Feds\"\n - \n1 unit, 1 vehicle\n\n\nMobile Task Force Sampson-7 \"Bugsy's Bunny\" - \n4 units, 1 vehicle\n\n\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n\n\n\n\nIota-10 Margery W.

Body cam falls, only floor tiles visible.\n\n\n[13:48] - SCP-7134:\n Oh, the door's open.\n\n[13:48] \nSounds of claws on tiles, presumably SCP-7134-02162010 leaving. \u03a0-7 Madsiri is vocalizing pain.\n\n[13:49] \n\u03a0-7 Madsiri lifts himself off of floor, shifting camera view. Agent reaches for body cam, attempts reconnecting to mount.\n\n\n[13:49] - SR Alba:\n Rangsan?\n\n[13:49] \nSound of footsteps are heard. SR Alba, S-7 LaFerrier's shoes are visible standing in elevator doorway.\n\n\n[13:49] - SR Alba:\n Rangsan? What happened?\n\n\n[13:49] - \u03a0-7 Madsiri:\n She kicked a tooth in, it feels like. God, Ed, get that bunny.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXCERPT C - (S-7 LaFerrier)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n[13:52] \nS-7 LaFerrier and SR Alba reach fifth floor. Hallways are going westbound and northbound from stairwell, along faces of building.\n\n\n[13:52] - SR Alba:\n Lieutenant?\n\n\n[13:53] - S-7 Baxters:\n \n(From left)\n She's down there! Weigh the anchor!\n\n[13:53] \nSR Alba opens briefcase, retrieving SRA from inside.\n\n\n[13:53] - SR Alba:\n Sergeant, close the stairwell, then go the other way and push her towards Baxters and I.\n\n[13:53] \nSR Alba runs down westbound hallway. S-7 LaFerrier turns and draws double doors to stairwell closed. Agent secures zip-tie on doors before running northbound.\n\n\n[13:53] - S-7 Baxters:\n \n(Over radio)\n LaFerrier, ready your noose. Upton, get the kennel from the truck.\n\n[13:53] \nS-7 LaFerrier equips collapsible snare pole, begins assembling tool.\n\n[13:53] \nS-7 LaFerrier begins turning northeast corner. Agent trips on SCP-7134-02162010 coming opposite way, falls to floor.\n\n\n[13:53] - SCP-7134:\n Watch it, bozo!\n\n[13:54] \nS-7 LaFerrier stands up. SCP-7134-02162010 is running back down hallway. Agent pursues subject.\n\n\n[13:54] - S-7 LaFerrier:\n \n(Into radio)\n Six o'clock. She's looping back around.\n\n[13:54] \nSCP-7134-02162010 turns right at southeast corner, heads towards S-7 Baxters and SR Alba at southwest corner.\n\n[13:54] \nSCP-7134-02162010 stops and looks at SR Alba with SRA. S-7 LaFerrier slows behind.\n\n\n[13:54] - SCP-7134:\n Is that a bomb? Wow, I didn't know I made you guys that mad.\n\n[13:54] \nSR Alba initiates anchoring process. Hume levels return above 90 Hm. SCP-7134-02162010 visibly shudders, sneezes.\n\n\n[13:54] - SCP-7134:\n Oh, that feels \nweird.\n\n[13:54] \nS-7 Baxters signals S-7 LaFerrier to her snare pole. Both agents ready their tools.\n\n\n[13:54] - SR Alba:\n Anchor to baseline in one, two\u2014\n\n[13:54] \nSCP-7134-02162010 runs forward, avoiding S-7 LaFerrier's snare pole.\n\n\n[13:55] - SCP-7134:\n Five!\n\n[13:55] \nSCP-7134-02162010 tackles SR Alba, knocking him into window wall, shattering the glass. S-7 Baxters grabs SR Alba by the leg, keeping him inside.\n\n\n[13:55] - S-7 Baxters:\n Fuck!\n\n[13:55] \nS-7 Baxters pulls SR Alba inside. Researcher is holding right arm, SCP-7134-02162010 and SRA are absent. Hume levels sharply spike before lowering to baseline.\n\n\n[13:55] - S-7 Baxters:\n Alba, are you alright?\n\n\n[13:55] - SR Alba:\n I'm cut up but I'm alive. Get a medic though, she bit my arm.\n\n\n[13:55] - S-7 Baxters:\n LaFerrier, over here.\n\n[13:55] \nS-7 LaFerrier approaches SR Alba and looks out broken window. SCP-7134-02162010 and the SRA are visible on the concrete, both inactive. Pool patrons and newborn SCP-7134 are running from impact site.\n\n\n[13:55] - SR Alba:\n There goes two million in tech.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass-A amnestics successfully administered to civilians. Cover for damages caused attributed incident to an anonymous saboteur of elevator systems who began throwing objects while refusing police. Cpl. Rangsan Madsiri was treated for facial injuries. Mostly superficial scratches, required stitches for lips and forehead. Sr. Res. Edward Alba was treated for injuries. Light glass cuts to back, neck, right hand; bruising to shoulders, head; bite to right forearm. Prescription glasses damaged in fall were replaced.\n\n\nAutopsy confirmed death of SCP-7134-02162010 was instantaneous upon contact with ground. Additionally, during or while initiating fall, specimen made physical contact with exhaust port of the Scranton Reality Anchor, receiving first degree burns to the left hind leg. Cadaver was placed in cryogenic storage at Site-19, Cryogenics W-Wing. Scranton Reality Anchor was left inoperable but internal components were largely intact. Salvage was considered more preferable alternative to restoration.\n\n\nEvident by SCP-7134-02162010's brief tenure under reality anchoring, viability of capturing SCP-7134 assisted by Scranton Reality Anchors had plausibility. Due to concerns over limited PSRA inventory and would be operators, repetition of experiment was postponed indefinitely until \na high-durability model\n of portable reality anchor was devised and produced.\n\n\nAddendum: 3/31/2010:\n Testimony from SCP-7134-03302010 indicated that SCP-7134-02162010 \"had missed the pool, but it was still fun.\" Fall from fifth story to ground pool would have been fatal to specimen regardless.\n\n\nAddendum: 6/17/2018:\n Sr. Tech. Rangsan Madrisi received root canal treatment following gum infection (Upper R1). Probable cause of root damage attributed to latent injuries sustained in 7134-Event-02162010 during MTF Pi-1 service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts\u00a0provided\u00a0-\u00a0Contact\u00a0RAISA\u00a0for\u00a0individual\u00a0records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file has undergone a recent revision.

Shope, 1933.\n\n\n7\n. An incorporeal apparition that can be directly perceived in baseline reality (contrast \nClass-I\n), but whose interaction with reality cannot impact matter unilaterally (\nClass-III\n), entirely (Class-IV), or selectively (\nClass-V\n) post manifestation.\n\n\n8\n. Domesticated rabbit. C. Linnaeus, 1758.\n\n\n9\n.

Confirmed a forgery in 1937 by \nAmerican Secure Containment Initiative\n.\n\n\n11\n. Month-day-year format is preserved for coherency across records. Conversion to alternative formats considered unnecessary due to localization of phenomena to United States.\n\n\n12\n. Minimum clearance for SCP-7134 was Confidential Clearance (Lv. 3) prior March 20th, 1992.\n\n\n13\n. Investigation of Graves' home computer found possession of zoophilic and exhibitionist pornography.\n\n\n14\n.

Range of transmission improved upon that of older \nJH-88 line\n.\n\n\n17\n. Post defeat of Nazi Germany, documents recovered in Ulm, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, detailed intentions by the Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps to create \nleporine anomalies\n for espionage and military service. Field agents were notified to remain alert for potential actualization of the projects by Axis remnants. Any actualization of these plans remain unsubstantiated.\n\n\n18\n. Shortening of \ndouble dime\n, slang for a United States twenty-dollar bill. Accounting for inflation, this would equate to \u2248$327 USD in 2022.\n\n\n19\n. The association between rabbits and carrots made by \nMerrie Melodies\n cartoons had been wildly popularized by this point.\n\n\n20\n.
