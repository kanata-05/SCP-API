All testing of SCP-6552 is discontinued and no one is to rename or play SCP-6552 under any circumstances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6552 is a .wav file consisting of the sounds of water crashing against the shore. When the file is given a name that creates a compound word when said while including the .wav and is played, a corresponding anomalous event will occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6552.1 Test Log:\n\nDr. Henderson instructed D-41897 on what to name SCP-6552. D-41897 then played the file for 3-10 loops and Dr. Henderson then marked down the effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName of SCP-6552\n\n\nAnomalous Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsound.wav\n\n\nThe audio of SCP-6552 did not come out of the speakers hooked up to the computer used to play the audio. Instead emanating from the pixels making up the .wav file itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheat.wav\n\n\nThe room in which SCP-6552 was being played began to heat up at a rate of 1\u00b0C per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvapor.wav\n\n\nWhile being played, all UI on the computer playing it was restructured to fit the \"vaporwave\" aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrain.wav\n\n\nAll personnel at Test-Site-98 were able to hear SCP-6552 being played, although no recording devices were able to register any sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicro.wav\n\n\nWhen played, concentrated radiation was emitted from the device playing SCP-6552 causing D-41897 to expire after 3 loops of the audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidal.wav\n\n\nFlooding of Test-Site-98 caused notes on resultant anomalous effect unrecoverable. Reconstruction and transferring of new replacement staff to Test-Site-98 are underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6551\n | SCP-6552 | \nSCP-6553\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+168\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\nPorridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Tstaffor\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\u25a3\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Tstaffor\u00a0\u25a3\n\n\n\n\nTstaffor's Author page!\n\nIf you like my writing, check out my Podcast with \nLuxaiko\n!\n\n\nThe Scip Squad Podcast Hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6868\n\n\nRating: \n419\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7500\n\n\nRating: \n318\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6552\n\n\nRating: \n168\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3837\n\n\nRating: \n146\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6557\n\n\nRating: \n138\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6558\n\n\nRating: \n102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5722\n\n\nRating: \n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5847\n\n\nRating: \n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6547\n\n\nRating: \n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5846\n\n\nRating: \n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7979\n\n\nRating: \n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6554\n\n\nRating: \n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6226\n\n\nRating: \n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6067\n\n\nRating: \n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1551-EX\n\n\nRating: \n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6553\n\n\nRating: \n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-555-J\n\n\nRating: \n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6551\n\n\nRating: \n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6588\n\n\nRating: \n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5846-J\n\n\nRating: \n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog of Non-Anomalous Items\n\n\nRating: \n219\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-173 But... it's a Collaborative Log\n\n\nRating: \n191\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-173 But...\n\n\nRating: \n171\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMfw\n\n\nRating: \n102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog of Non-Anomalous Items II: Sequels are Always Worse\n\n\nRating: \n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoat VR?
