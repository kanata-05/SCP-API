When recontained, all individuals assigned to SCP-6769 are to be briefed on Incident-6769/A and rotated out every 3 months. Personnel are advised to follow LTHA protocol during SCP-6769's apprehension.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6769 is a humanoid bearing the appearance of a middle-aged Caucasian male. All information about SCP-6769 has been gathered through logs conducted with SCP-6769, in accordance with Low-Threat Humanoid Anomaly (\nLTHA\n) practices recently put forth by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nSCP-6769 only refers to itself as \u201cThe Right Hand\u201d. The anomaly wore an embroidered suit belonging to a group known as the \u201c League of The Heavenly Appendage \u201d, made up of extremely wealthy individuals whose goals and purpose remain unclear. No information pertaining to such a group has been sourced aside from SCP-6769\u2019s accounts. During its apprehension by local law enforcement, SCP-6769 was in denial of their anomalous abilities. SCP-6769 exhibited extreme hostility towards individuals who highlighted their anomalous nature to them, but this behavior ceased when the anomaly was properly interviewed in Foundation custody. When communicating, SCP-6769's speech will often contain substantial pauses before answering, but this is presumed to be non-anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-6769-A is a metal gauntlet that takes the place of SCP-6769\u2019s left hand. The means at which SCP-6769-A has connected to SCP-6769 are unknown, but full motor control is capable for SCP-6769. Attempts to sever the gauntlet following LTHA guidelines have been met with failure. When activated by SCP-6769, the object develops rings of red light around itself, glowing at roughly 1000 lumens in the shapes of various eyes above the dorsal parts of SCP-6769\u2019s hands. SCP-6769 frequently activates SCP-6769-A for no known reason. No other effects of SCP-6769-A have been observed to occur as of writing.\n2\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report 6769/A:\n\n\nOn 09/02/2002, SCP-6769 successfully escaped Site-164 during a major unrelated containment breach. At approximately 9:30 am, SCP-6769 and former Containment Specialist \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were seen by security staff leaving the anomaly\u2019s containment chamber and moving to a nearby exit. Investigations have concluded that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had entered SCP-6769's chamber at 9:00 am beforehand and engaged in conversation with the entity before escaping. From there, SCP-6769 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 entered the specialist\u2019s vehicle and drove to an unknown location for approximately 3 hours, before both individuals exited the vehicle. Junior Researcher Adam Lu, while on commute to Site-164, spotted the vehicle and found only \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 left at the scene. The researcher was commended on their ability to quickly implement LTHA tactics on the newly-made anomaly in order to coax into containment.\n\n\nSCP-6769 has demonstrated a very uncooperative demeanor, frequently writing complaints regarding other anomalies, facilities, and staff. It has written several times that it will attempt to breach containment, but in all cases, no such breach had previously been acted upon. It has exhibited, at times, non-verbal signs of extreme paranoia and delusion, though this is theorized to be non-anomalous, as it falls under LTHA specifications of typical exposure to new anomalous concepts.\n\n\nDespite numerous incendiary remarks, SCP-6769 has never resisted or physically attacked any personnel or anomaly, nor resisted in giving information regarding itself during any interview. It is also noted that although SCP-6769 was told which information it was allowed to keep private, SCP-6769 surpassed LTHA requirements of personal information and was an invaluable asset to the Foundation in the investigation of its related GOI.\n\n\nFollowing investigations into SCP-6769's escape, it became apparent that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was responsible for SCP-6769's breach of containment. In their collaboration with SCP-6769, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was \"rewarded\" with the same anomalous properties. As of 15/02/2002, the designation of SCP-6769-B was created for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as they are currently contained in SCP-6769's previous quarters. SCP-6769-C, the anomalous left hand \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 gained during the incident, is currently pending examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a06769-(12/28/2002)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Stanis\u0142aw Stefan\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6769-B\n\n\nForeword:\n Shortly after being placed in Foundation custody, an interview was conducted between Researcher Stefan and SCP-6769-B.

Site Director told me to message an LTHA representative. I've only worked here for around a year, so I apologize if this next part sounds unprofessional; I haven't heard of LTHA protocol before and everyone I ask tells me that I'm a shining example of it. How new is this protocol, anyway? I swear I haven't heard about it before.\n\n\nI only ask since I find SCP-6769-B's recent behavior cause for concern. They have not spoken a word in nearly 2 weeks, and seem to be under intense duress, at least from what I've observed when out of their chambers. Shirai was a former well-respected employee, and so I find it odd that a shift in behavior isn't deliberate. I have reason to believe she is communicating with someone, if not the Foundation directly.

They have attempted to instead communicate to staff via writings or encoded language. All incidents however were handled extremely professionally, and, following LTHA protocol, no information regarding SCP-6769-B's attempts at bargaining with personnel has even reached the eyes of a staff member. 6769 personnel's actions have been commendable, and as such, they will be receiving a small bonus at the end of the month. Of particular note is Junior Researcher Adam Lu, for if they had not notified an LTHA member of SCP-6769-B's incongruous behavior, staff would not have responded so quickly. This particular LTHA champion has been rewarded with a state-of-the-art LTHA glove, to serve as the perfect reminder of LTHA guidelines.\n\n\nAs always, staff are encouraged to make coworkers more cognizant of LTHA protocol and employ LTHA scrambling software to all applicable anomalies. We are also excited to announce that Medium Threat Humanoid Anomaly protocols are currently in development! We hope that staff continue to have pleasant and worry-free experience through the hands and joint cooperation between the Ethics Committee and the Legislative Thaumaturgical Happenstance Advisory team.\n\n\nLTHA, Let Them Hear Again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
