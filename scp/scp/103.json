Under no circumstances is SCP-103-1 to die, with all efforts to be taken to ensure its survival.\n\n\nSCP-103 itself is not relevant in the context of containment.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-103 describes a phenomenon currently affecting Dr. Ewan Mara, a White male in his mid-forties, and Head of Site-\u2588\u2588's Department of Extradimensional Studies. During an aggressive experimental treatment for metastatic stomach cancer, Dr. Mara was placed into a medically-induced coma. Concurrently, Dr. Jacob Rhys, Dr. Mara's research partner, reported a drastic uptick in local hume levels. Believing this to be due to Dr. Mara's proximity to dimensional-based anomalies, Dr. Rhys requested Dr. Mara's relocation to the Department of Extradimensional Studies for containment under the designation SCP-103-1.\n\n\nPresently, SCP-103-1's stomach is missing, replaced by a similarly sized extradimensional rift, but is believed to be in otherwise stable condition. Additionally, SCP-103-1 does not produce any waste despite being regularly provided nutrients and fluids through intravenous means. An upper endoscopy was conducted during SCP-103-1's initial containment, with the scope disappearing shortly after insertion. A follow-up surgery was conducted to recover the scope, instead revealing an absence of biological materials and reflected light within SCP-103.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-103.1 - Object Testing\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, we possess very little knowledge of Dr. Ewan Mara's condition. I had the honor of working closely with Dr. Mara during his tenure as the Head of Extradimensional Studies, and even as his diagnosis progressed he was still committed to the pursuit of knowledge. In his current state, Dr. Mara continues to provide us with a means to pursue knowledge, a once in a lifetime chance to advance the Foundation's knowledge of parabiology and dimensional mechanics. It is with his mission in mind that I carry this burden.\n\n\nAlthough he is dying in the dark, his sacrifice will preserve those who still live in the light.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. Jacob Rhys, Interim Head of Extradimensional Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rhys was assigned as the Lead Researcher for SCP-103, and was tasked with the initial creation of containment and testing documentation. Following an internal Ethics Committee review, Dr. Rhys' request to test SCP-103 was granted.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-103 Test #1\n\n\nProblem:\n Presently, any and all forms of energy or matter that enter SCP-103's stomach are entirely consumed. As there is no calculated change in entropy following consumption, questions surrounding where energy or matter consumed by SCP-103 goes have been raised.\n\n\nProposed Solution:\n Adding multidimensional nano-trackers developed in the Department of Extradimensional Studies to SCP-103-1's liquid nutritional diet, we may be able to determine the location of materials consumed by SCP-103.\n\n\nOutcome:\n Failure; SCP-103 has spread to encompass the small intestines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #1 - Video Log\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Dr. Ewan Mara, Head of Extradimensional Studies; Dr. Jacob Rhys, Interim Head of Extradimensional Studies; Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site-\u2588\u2588 Medical Staff\n\n\nDate:\n November 28th, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBegin Log\u00bb\n\n\n<A researcher sits on a stool in front of the camera.

My name is Dr. Jacob Rhys and with me is Dr. Mara, the \ncurrent\n Head of Extradimensional Studies. My\u2026 assistant here, is from the site's medical wing.\n\n\n<He looks down at SCP-103-1, who is laying down on a hospital bed.

I'm still trying to get used to everything.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No worries, sir. We offer grief counseling if that's something you would find beneficial? From what I've heard the two of you were close, so I thought it might be worthwhile to bring up.\n\n\nRhys:\n Your concern is noted, but I can assure you I'm fine. Once we learn more about Dr. Mara's condition, we can start to figure out how to fix it. Are you ready to proceed?\n\n\n<\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \nflips back to the first page of their clipboard and adjusts their glasses.>\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n SCP-103-1 appears stable, and the anesthesiologist made sure everything was good to go about an hour ago.\n\n\nRhys:\n Perfect, in that case we can begin.\n\n\n<Rhys wheels over to the bedside, sliding the table over with him.

If we're dealing with a rift, mapping it would be the first step to figuring out how we can stabilize it.\n\n\n<He chuckles.>\n\n\nRhys:\n You know, before\u2014 well everything, Dr. Mara and I were planning on using these to map pocket dimensions.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Is this safe?\n\n\nRhys:\n Biocompatibility wasn't something we necessarily tested for, but it can't be worse for him than the chemo at this point. Also they're quite robust, so we shouldn't have to worry about the paste breaking them down.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I see.\n\n\n<\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \npauses.>\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Did you want to, I don't know, talk about him?\n\n\nRhys:\n Once he gets better, you can learn all about him yourself. For now, focus on the sensors. They should be coming online soon.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Denial is common in situations like this.

Following SCP-103's spread to the large intestine, and unknown artifacting from traditional biological imaging, a more direct means of observation was needed.

Current disposal methods are carried out under treaties with the United States government, but occur infrequently, leading to sections of the site needing to be relegated to store hazardous materials. Additionally, a large portion of site funding is focused on spent nuclear fuels, leading to lack in funding for research projects and other essential services.\n\n\nProposed Solution:\n Direct disposal of spent nuclear waste into SCP-103-1.\n\n\nOutcome:\n Success; SCP-103 has grown to encompass 65% of the abdominal cavity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #3 - Video Log\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Dr. Ewan Mara, Head of Extradimensional Studies; Dr. Jacob Rhys, Interim Head of Extradimensional Studies.\n\n\nDate:\n January 19th, 2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBegin Log\u00bb\n\n\n<A figure slouches in front of the camera.

I'm surprised they approved this one, but at this point, I'd take anything.\n\n\nRhys:\n In these cylinders are depleted fuel from the site's reactor that have accumulated over the past 20 years or so. Before he died, one of Ewan's side projects was to figure out what exactly to do with them.

A panacea even. Maybe the next test will be transferring SCP-103 into my body. \n<He pauses.>\n No, you wouldn't want that. Stubborn, as always.\n\n\n<He places the cylinder into SCP-103-1's abdomen.

He was a good man too, almost like the brother I never had. He saw that drive in me that nobody else did. So when he got sick\u2014\n\n\nRhys:\n I made a decision, a \nreally\n poor decision, but still the best decision I could have. He didn't deserve to suffer, not like that\u2026 not like this. I guess I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet. I thought, maybe if I can just keep giving him chances, he'll get through this.\n\n\n<Rhys looks away from the camera and wipes his eyes with one of his hands.>\n\n\nRhys:\n I'm sorry, Ewan.

        "Addendum SCP-103.1 - Object Testing\nDr. Rhys was assigned as the Lead Researcher for SCP-103, and was tasked with the initial creation of containment and testing documentation. Following an internal Ethics Committee review, Dr. Rhys' request to test SCP-103 was granted.\nFollowing the conclusion of Test #1, an anonymous tip was raised to Site-\u2588\u2588's Ethics Committee Liaison, specifically citing a concern for Dr. Rhys' behavior and wellbeing. When asked, Dr. Rhys noted that his comments were specifically pertaining to \"owing\" Dr. Mara for their time together and \"reflected no personal stake in the anomaly.\"\nChief Thaumaturge Iakovos and Dr. Rhys both submitted reports to Site-\u2588\u2588's HR department following their interaction, citing \"she was entirely out of line given the circumstances of the situation\" and \"he really needs to be checked out.\" Dr. Rhys was put on final notice, with removal as the Head of the SCP-103 project following his next infraction.\nTo confirm thaumaturgic binding of the anomaly, an exploratory laparotomy 1 was conducted, and SCP-103's containment chamber was converted into a clean room. Following SCP-103's spread to the large intestine, and unknown artifacting from traditional biological imaging, a more direct means of observation was needed. Examinations confirmed that although SCP-103 is visible through bed sores on the subject's back, materials outside of its body are unaffected.\nTwo months following Test 4, Site-\u2588\u2588's nuclear waste storage was noted to have been emptied by 75% following the protocol laid out by Dr. Rhys. During this time, researchers conducting the protocol observed a noted \"decline\" in Dr. Rhys' physical state and mental well-being. When asked to speak with on-site psychologists, Rhys declined, replying that he \"just needed more time\" and \"it was almost perfect.\" When asked to elaborate, Rhys refused to comment.\nThree hours following Test #4, site security was dispatched to SCP-103's containment chamber to confirm the status of the anomaly, and to detain Dr. Rhys. Upon entering the room, security found Dr. Rhys\u2019 personal effects and research notes on the desk next to the camera, with his shoes next to SCP-103-1's bed. An unsubmitted test was found on the room's computer.\nUpon observing SCP-103-1, a syringe containing trace amounts of pancuronium bromide 2 was found still connected to its IV port. SCP-103-1 was announced dead shortly after and, with the phenomenon neutralized, was buried following standard Foundation protocol.\nDr. Rhys' location is currently unknown."
