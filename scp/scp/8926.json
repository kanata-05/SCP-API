Seeing as the entity poses no risk for discovery by the public and it has fully and continuously cooperated with the Foundation, no significant containment measures are required beyond passive monitoring. To prevent undue emotional distress from SCP-8926, at least one member of personnel is to visit it once per week.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8926 is a living anthropomorphic construct formed of ink with a resemblance to the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a creation of Walt Disney. The entity is animate and capable of vocalizations, and has shown sapience identical to that of a human being.\n\n\nSCP-8926 has an amicable and energetic personality, and prefers to create artworks made of ink as a hobby whenever it is not spending time with a member of personnel. In the event that it remains isolated for too long, it will become distressed, find a suitable hiding space and curl itself into a ball. As such, to retain enrichment for SCP-8926 it is mandated that personnel must continue to interact with the entity on a regular basis.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8926 was discovered on 2003/03/01 in an abandoned workshop in Burbank, California. Contained inside were early designs of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, workstations with somewhat intact sheets of hand-drawn paintings covered with celluloid, and damaged posters of the animated short \u201cTrolley Troubles.\u201d SCP-8926 was found hiding in a room filled with a collection of ink-drawn paintings and drawings of several characters that are closely associated with the character of Oswald. As soon as it was discovered, it immediately became cooperative with Foundation agents and elected to stay inside the workshop. Containment procedures were soon devised and enacted.\n\n\nAddendum 8926.1:\n Interview Log 1\n\n\nOn 2005/08/01, Madeline Webb, director of Site-35, made a request to conduct a series of interviews with the anomaly, which was tentatively granted. She subsequently took a flight to Burbank to personally interview SCP-8926 herself. Below is a transcription of the first interview.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDirector Webb opens the door to the workshop, spotting in-progress works of art and various workstations scattered around the room. In the center of the room is SCP-8926, painting on a canvas with broad, sweeping brush strokes. It does not notice her until she closes the door, causing it to jump back in surprise.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Who\u2019s there?\n\n\nWebb:\n Just me. I\u2019ll be your interviewer for this week.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Oh, okay. Phew. Scared me for a second there.\n\n\nThe entity approaches Director Webb and reaches out its hand.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Welp, name\u2019s Oswald, it\u2019s nice to meet ya. And you\u2026?\n\n\nWebb:\n You can call me Madeline.\n\n\nWebb reaches out to shake the entity\u2019s hand. It shakes her hand vigorously.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Madeline, Madeline. Got it. Lovely name, really. Very lovely.\n\n\nWebb:\n Yes, thank you, but I think that\u2019s\u2014\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Oh, right. Sorry. I get a little worked up when I meet someone new. It\u2019s exhilarating, I get to meet new faces, new voices and new perspectives, new everything, really. So sorry if I get a little too excited.\n\n\nWebb:\n No, no, you\u2019re fine. I completely understand. It\u2019s a great feeling to discover new things.\n\n\nDirector Webb looks over SCP-8926\u2019s shoulder, toward its canvas.\n\n\nWebb:\n Do you mind if I can see what you\u2019re working on?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Of course, of course! Now it\u2019s not exactly finished yet, but I think I\u2019m making some good progress so far.\n\n\nDirector Webb heads toward the painting, and sees a mountainous black and white landscape, with flowing black waterfalls cascading over the side of the mountain. Some details are not present, such as the trees, which are missing branches. However, the painting is mostly complete.\n\n\nWebb:\n That\u2019s\u2014 That looks wonderful.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Wow, really? Thanks! It\u2019s not finished yet, though. I need to make some final touches.\n\n\nWebb:\n Regardless of its current state, I can appreciate good craftsmanship when I see it. And the finer details with the brush strokes.\n\n\nDirector Webb looks back at the entity.\n\n\nWebb:\n How did you get the material for these paintings?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Oh, that\u2019s easy, I just pull ink out of myself, like so\u2014\n\n\nSCP-8926 sinks its hand into its chest, and dramatically pulls liquid ink out of its body.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n \u2014and \nshquick\n, there we are.\n\n\nWebb looks at SCP-8926 with concern.\n\n\nWebb:\n Is this process\u2026 uncomfortable for you?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Oh, no no, it\u2019s fine, actually. I gain my ink back quickly, and it\u2019s painless, so it\u2019s not much of a bother for me.\n\n\nWebb:\n Well, that\u2019s good then. To get back on track, before I came here I watched some of your shorts to get some background information about you. I never expected you to be a painter.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n You watched those? I\u2019m flattered. But yeah, I never really got the chance to see those, so I can\u2019t find out how much of me is really me, ya know? But it\u2019s fine.\n\n\nWebb:\n Are you sure it\u2019s fine?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I\u2019ve got to keep having a smile on my face. That\u2019s who I\u2019m supposed to be, right? I\u2019ll go through anything no matter how bad it is.\n\n\nWebb:\n Are you able to tell me anything about how you got to be in this position? Such as how you were made?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I can, but you\u2019re just going to get the same answer as everyone else. I\u2019ve already told this story.\n\n\nWebb:\n One more time can\u2019t hurt, right?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yeah, why not. One more can\u2019t hurt.\n\n\nThe two sit down next to each other, and Webb turns to the entity.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n It started with a dream. Well, at least that\u2019s how he said it did. It really started with the rights issues.\n\n\nWebb:\n With Universal.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yep. Some big shot was going behind Walt\u2019s back and hiring away his own workers, and tried to force him to take a smaller cut instead of a larger one like he wanted. There was a back-and-forth, the guy threatened to start his own studio, blah blah blah, Walt still refused, and lost most of his staff as a result. Besides his co-contributor that\u2019s always been there with him.\n\n\nWebb:\n Yes, he had issues with his former producer.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Can\u2019t ever trust those guys.\n\n\nWebb:\n And how did that lead to your creation?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Well, story goes that one night Walt went out to his porch, got on his knees, and prayed for some good to happen to him. Didn\u2019t matter what it was, he just wanted something good. And then when he finally opened his eyes, a shooting star streaked across the sky for him to see. The next day, I was there, hopping around the place like a kid overdosing on sugar. The great miracle of life!\n\n\nWebb:\n So you weren\u2019t made from an artificial process, like a machine.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Would make more sense, but nope! When I showed up at his doorstep, a true work of art come to life, that\u2019s when Walt knew that dreams really do come true.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n We got along well. I actually learned how to draw from Walt and the other guy who was with him, and I helped them come up with designs for a new character to be my equal. So we thought, why not a mouse? Then Walt\u2019s wife came over and suggested the name for us.\n\n\nWebb:\n So you helped create Mickey Mouse?\n\n\nSCP-8926\u2019s left ear slightly twitches the second Webb names the character. Neither acknowledge this event.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Well, I was just throwing ideas out there and all that. But I became part of the team, and it felt great. That was my purpose, to help these guys create cool things to make the kids smile.\n\n\nWebb:\n But that changed.\n\n\nSCP-8926 sighs.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yep. I remember the exact day. I remember waking up and seeing the sunshine glaring at me through the window. I remember the silence. I remember walking down the stairs, and finding the place entirely vacant. Like everyone packed up all of a sudden and left. They left so many things behind. Left me behind.\n\n\nWebb:\n They abandoned you?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever know why. And I was alone.\n\n\nWebb:\n That\u2019s\u2026 I can\u2019t believe anyone would do that.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Maybe it was a good thing for me. Sometimes, you gotta look at things with a different perspective. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t doing it because of me. Maybe he was doing it for me. You never know.\n\n\nWebb:\n Did you go out at all? Out of the studio?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n No, not really. But hey, I got all this free space for myself!\n\n\nWebb:\n I don\u2019t think this is exactly freeing.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Funny how you say it. What do you guys do, anyway? Other than the whole containment thing.\n\n\nWebb:\n We still have \u2018the containment thing,\u2019 but we also have other obligations.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Such as?\n\n\nWebb:\n At my site, I take care of those under my watch. I check on their health, make sure they\u2019re doing okay. They\u2019re treated as they should be, not as prisoners.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Hey, as long as you keep the golden rule, fine by me. But if they\u2019re as trapped as I am, you should probably check on them more often, just saying.\n\n\nWebb:\n I allow them to leave their rooms, to interact with each other. But not through the entire site. We still have restrictions that we need to abide by.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yeah, makes sense.\n\n\nSCP-8926 looks back at its canvas for a split second, before looking back at Director Webb.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I know you\u2019re right. Nothing has really changed for me. None of this is freeing. But I\u2019m used to it. I gotta keep that smile on me, right?\n\n\nWebb:\n You\u2019re allowed to express how you feel.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Nah, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine! Seriously, I am. I feel better than I ever have been.\n\n\nWebb:\n Alright. But if you ever need me, I\u2019m here to help.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I know. You\u2019re staying the whole week, right?\n\n\nWebb:\n I am.\n\n\nThe entity contemplates for a few seconds, before looking back at Director Webb.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Can we get back to this tomorrow?\n\n\nWebb:\n Of course.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Thanks. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with me.\n\n\nWebb:\n The feeling is mutual.\n\n\nDirector Webb gets up, opens the door, and leaves the studio.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8926.2:\n Interview Log 2\n\n\nThe following is the second interview between Director Webb and SCP-8926, conducted a day after the first interview.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDirector Webb watches SCP-8926 paint on a new canvas. All around them are completed artworks affixed to the walls, each depicting a different cartoon character.\n\n\nWebb walks up to the entity, and stands next to it.\n\n\nWebb:\n Could you tell me about the figures in the back there?\n\n\nShe points to a large and wide painting on the back wall, depicting SCP-8926 and several other characters standing next to it.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n What, that one? That\u2019s one of my favorites. I\u2019ve always been proud of that one. Let\u2019s see\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8926 points to the figures on the left.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Those are my friends, my allies. Well, at least the ones from the original cartoons. Because I exist, and they don\u2019t. But anyway\u2014\n\n\nIt points to the figures on the right.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n These guys are the antagonists that I face off against. But again, I don\u2019t know any of them personally. As you can clearly tell.\n\n\nDirector Webb turns her head to the canvas that the entity is working on, and sees three recognizable circles connected together.\n\n\nWebb:\n What are you drawing now?\n\n\nSCP-8926 looks down at the floor for a split second, before looking back at Webb.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Back before, well you know, I was always taught to draw what I\u2019m feeling. Because art is how you express yourself, right? So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\n\n\nWebb:\n I see.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I\u2019m not jealous, okay? I\u2019m far from jealous. Why would I be jealous? I contributed to that success. I helped them out.\n\n\nWebb:\n I don\u2019t think you\u2019re jealous, Oswald.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n We were supposed to be standing side by side. I was supposed to be on that boat with him. Now he\u2019s out there, and I\u2019m still here.\n\n\nSCP-8926 turns to look at the painting on the back wall, and continues to stare at it.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n They should\u2019ve told me. I really believed that I could make something great, you know. But just because I exist doesn't mean that the rights would suddenly come back to us like a miracle. The world doesn\u2019t work in miracles. You can\u2019t wish upon a star to make your dreams come true.\n\n\nWebb:\n You were made by a wish. By someone who wanted you to be real. Someone who believed in you.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n That someone left me to rot and be forgotten in some dusty workshop with mold growing everywhere. What do you think that makes me?\n\n\nWebb:\n None of that makes you who you are.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Then \nwhat am I?\n\n\nThere is a short pause.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n See? Not even you know. I\u2019ve only got decades-old cartoons to show me who I am. And frankly I have nothing to do with those. So I\u2019m nothing.\n\n\nWebb:\n I highly doubt that.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Look, miss, I know you\u2019re trying, and I\u2019m grateful for that, really I am, but this isn\u2019t working.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n What\u2019s the plan for if I somehow have an epiphany and change my entire outlook on life anyway, huh? Keep me pacified? I\u2019ll still be in here no matter what. What\u2019s the game plan here?\n\n\nWebb:\n The game plan is to make sure that the health and wellbeing of you and all others under my care are at my top priority.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Even when they\u2019re locked up? I feel like that should be the opposite of that.\n\n\nWebb:\n Not everyone here is willing to uphold standard procedure. Even a little dissent can go a long way.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n The only option there, then, is to let me out. But we both know that\u2019s not happening.\n\n\nWebb:\n We should stand our ground regardless.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n You work for them. You still work for them. Do you consider that dissent?\n\n\nWebb:\n I will never put my head in the sand and blindly follow what I\u2019m told. We cannot embrace the end and wait until it\u2019s all over. We must stand in solidarity and support our communities. We must embrace the idea that we can still turn things around.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t do any of that.\n\n\nWebb:\n I believe you can.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Right, you, the person keeping me held here, believe that I can go out there and fight the good fight. Right.\n\n\nWebb:\n You still have a voice to shout for what you believe in. It might not feel like it now, but we can still fight for what\u2019s right in small but meaningful ways. Any action that we take has a reaction in response. We can still create change.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n We don\u2019t need to get into any of this philosophical talk. I know what I am. A prototype for something better. A rough first draft. Even without the rights issues, I doubt I\u2019d ever go that far in the first place.\n\n\nWebb:\n How can you know that? The people loved those cartoons. They gathered around to see you in action.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n We were in the early days, animation was just in its infancy. It\u2019s not as many as you\u2019d think.\n\n\nWebb:\n But there were people who came to watch those shorts. They came to be entertained, and you provided.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Not enough, clearly.\n\n\nWebb:\n But it\u2019s better than nothing at all.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n No one ever came back for me, Madeline. I\u2019m not loved. Not in the slightest.\n\n\nWebb:\n But\u2014\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n There\u2019s no point. You\u2019re not getting anywhere. Just stop.\n\n\nThere is a short pause.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Maybe I deserve it. I\u2019m a freak accident. I only exist because someone else wanted something great, and all he got was me.\n\n\nSCP-8926 promptly falls back and sits on the floor, cross-legged. It stares at its feet and twiddles its thumbs.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I don\u2019t know anymore.\n\n\nThe entity continues to stare down towards the floor, and is silent for a few moments.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I think you should leave me alone, for now. I need to think some things over. Calm myself down.\n\n\nWebb:\n I will. Take care of yourself.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Sure. Just skip a day for your interviews or something, alright? Thanks.\n\n\nDirector Webb nods, and moves to exit the chamber.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8926.3:\n Interview Log 3\n\n\nThe following is the third and final interview between SCP-8926 and Director Webb.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDirector Webb enters the studio. She looks around; no one is present in the room besides her.\n\n\nWebb:\n Oswald?\n\n\nNo response. Silence permeates the chamber.\n\n\nDirector Webb begins to walk forward. The workbenches look as if they have been ransacked, with various brushes and paints scattered all over the floor. She picks up two pieces of paper, which are revealed to be an in-progress artwork torn in half.\n\n\nShe places the two pieces together, revealing a recognizable cartoon character.\n\n\nWebb:\n That can\u2019t be good. I need to find him.\n\n\nDirector Webb hurriedly searches for SCP-8926, looking through different corridors and unused rooms. Dried ink can be seen splattered all over the walls.\n\n\nShe reaches a projector room. While the projector is running, the screen is entirely blank. The chairs in the room are positioned as if they were each thrown across the room, with a few being broken apart.\n\n\nDirector Webb keeps going, and begins to shout SCP-8926\u2019s name as she searches. Eventually, she reaches the room where SCP-8926 keeps its collection of art. Once she opens the door, she stops in her tracks. SCP-8926 can be seen curling into a ball against the back wall, shivering and muttering to itself. Faint sobs can be heard.\n\n\nWebb rushes to SCP-8926\u2019s side, and sits next to it in an attempt to comfort it.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I didn\u2019t get it. Now I do.\n\n\nWebb:\n What did you not get?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I know why they left me now. Why he did it. Because they knew I was worthless. They knew I was a waste of time. They \nknew\n I was just a prototype to make something better. They both fully knew that. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t bother to say bye on the way out.\n\n\nWebb:\n You can\u2019t truly know what Walt was thinking. Weren\u2019t you working together?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Well, yes, but artists stop working together all the time, right? Usually for creative differences. Or if one knew that the other wasn\u2019t going to make it big.\n\n\nWebb:\n You are not worthless.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Contrary to almost nobody\u2019s belief, the facts are stated clearly. I will be forgotten. Fortuna herself has made it so.\n\n\nWebb:\n That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be anything now.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n \nNow?\n What am I supposed to be now? I can\u2019t leave this place. Even if I wanted to, you won\u2019t let me. Tell me, honestly, who do you think I am? Not just a cartoon character no one cares about. Who am I?\n\n\nWebb:\n An artist.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n With no one to see my work.\n\n\nWebb:\n That doesn\u2019t matter. An artist doesn\u2019t need to rely on an audience to make great things. They make their work something that they themselves can be proud of. Are you proud of your work?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nWebb:\n You don\u2019t know?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n In the back of my head, I thought if I could keep making art, maybe one day someone or something would fly down from the stars and give me the recognition that I deserve. If Walt could wish upon a star, then why can\u2019t I? Unfortunately, life doesn\u2019t work like that.\n\n\nWebb:\n You\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t. But we must push forward regardless.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I\u2019m just standing still. Stuck in place. And I always will be.\n\n\nWebb:\n What makes you think that won\u2019t change?\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n What makes you think that it will?\n\n\nWebb:\n I believe that anyone can make an impact for the world, no matter how small. I believe in the indomitability of us as a people. Every single person on this earth has done something that matters. Whether in their community, or their own personal lives. It still matters.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I haven\u2019t done any of that.\n\n\nWebb:\n But you can still make an impact. In fact, you already have.\n\n\nThere is a short pause.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n What do you mean by that?\n\n\nWebb:\n I had an interest in this development of moving pictures. The animated kind. I saw the start of it, and I hungered for more. I saw the first ever cartoon characters, as we would call them now. And then I watched a short animation starring a certain rabbit.\n\n\nWebb:\n He had such a personality, and the way that it connected with the physical comedy kept me invested the whole time. That rabbit\u2019s foot trick was very clever. And I was inspired by how he would keep on going, no matter what obstacle was thrown at him.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Hang on a second. Are you telling me\u2014\n\n\nWebb:\n Yes. Not everything about me is as it seems.\n\n\nSCP-8926 stares at Director Webb in shock.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Wow, I didn\u2019t expect that at all. How did you get yourself to look so young?\n\n\nWebb:\n \nI have my secrets.\n But I know how you feel.\n\n\nDirector Webb gestures to hold SCP-8926\u2019s hand, which it hesitantly accepts.\n\n\nWebb:\n I haven\u2019t had the same experience, but I understand you. It\u2019s suffocating. You can feel the world rot around you, and you want to do something, but you can\u2019t. Your brain screams at you and you still can\u2019t. And you just sit there as time ticks by, and you waste away.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Like dust in the wind.\n\n\nWebb:\n But we aren\u2019t dust. I found my place in the world. It\u2019s about time I help you find yours.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n In the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t exist.\n\n\nWebb:\n Neither do I. None of us do, for that matter. But nothing in our universe can exist without having an impact on something else. The big picture is made of many brush strokes. That\u2019s how we make things matter.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n But how can I change into who I want to be? I can\u2019t just leave.\n\n\nWebb:\n You could, but they\u2019d try to stop you.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yeah, you wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\n\nWebb:\n We have surveillance everywhere, and they would most likely send a task force after you. There would be a long road ahead.\n\n\nSCP-8926 looks up at the director.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Do you think I still have a chance?\n\n\nWebb:\n They\u2019d stop you at any cost. But if you want to do what\u2019s best for you, you need to find the right window of opportunity. And then you\u2019ll find what you need.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Wouldn\u2019t you try to stop me regardless?\n\n\nWebb:\n They would. But you must stand your ground no matter what anyone throws at you.\n\n\nThe entity leans back against the wall.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I don't know what I should do with myself. I don\u2019t know who I should be. I\u2019m not the same guy from the cartoons. Should I try to be him?\n\n\nWebb:\n You have to find yourself. Learn from what you see in the outside world, and build yourself based on who \nyou\n want to be. I wanted there to be more justice in this world, so that\u2019s what I strive to be. To help others.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n The other me would go through anything, no matter how hard the path may seem. No matter how many obstacles. I think that part of him is what I want to keep.\n\n\nWebb:\n And your creativity.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Yeah.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready, though. I can\u2019t go out there. What if there\u2019s something that I can\u2019t handle?\n\n\nWebb:\n Then you pick yourself back up, and find a way where you succeed.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n This\u2019ll be too new for me.\n\n\nWebb:\n When I first experienced a big change, it was terrifying. But I went through it. I persisted. And so will you.\n\n\nShe smiles.\n\n\nWebb:\n The journey ahead will be rough. But as long as you take one small step at a time, you will make it through.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n Better to try than do nothing, I guess.\n\n\nDirector Webb stands up. SCP-8926 unfolds itself, and its expression is somewhat content. But it stays on the floor.\n\n\nWebb:\n Unfortunately, our time is up, and I am no longer able to conduct these interviews with you.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n How am I going to deal with the fact that I\u2019m alone again?\n\n\nWebb:\n Like I said, wait until the right opportunity, and take it. You will find people who care about you, I promise.\n\n\nSCP-8926:\n I hope you\u2019re right. Thanks again for being here for me, that really helped.\n\n\nWebb:\n Good luck, Oswald.\n\n\nDirector Webb leaves the room, leaving SCP-8926 behind.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8926.4:\n Update\n\n\nOn 2006/04/03, The Walt Disney Corporation acquired the rights to the character of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. When informed of this development, SCP-8926 became more active and energized, with reports from researchers that it \u201clooked like he was getting ready for something.\u201d A day later, during a routine check-in, SCP-8926 was discovered to have escaped its confinement along with its art supplies, leaving the back door to the workshop fully open. Initial searches to locate SCP-8926 were unsuccessful.\n\n\nOn 2023/01/01, the day that Oswald the Lucky Rabbit entered the public domain, a letter from an unknown sender was sent to Site-35, with the intended recipient being Director Webb. The following is the contents of the letter.\n\n\n\n\nHeya, Maddy!\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, huh? How ya doing? For me, it\u2019s been okay. Could be better, but hey I like okay. Better than nothing.\n\n\nGosh, it\u2019s been so long. You know how much work I had to do to find your site without getting caught? I nearly gave up and accepted my losses, but I knew I\u2019d reach you eventually.\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen so many things out here, and it\u2019s just wonderful. Did you know that there are other people like me out here? They walk and talk like me and everything. You should come and see what we got out here if you have the time! There\u2019s so many beautiful sights to see, and it\u2019s a shame that you\u2019re not here with me.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s fine. You have a job to do, and so do I. But hey, if you ever need anything from me, I\u2019ll come running, don\u2019t you worry.\n\n\nAnd thanks again for helping me out. The pain is still there, but faded. All that suffering, all those days sitting alone with no one to hear me, none of that made me who I am. The pain only exists to tear you apart, it doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s love that changes you. Love makes people. My love for all the creativity in this world makes me stronger. And it\u2019s thanks to you that I\u2019m still standing today.\n\n\nAll the baggage that I have, that\u2019s not going away. Never. I still have those days. I still worry too much. But I stayed strong, and I\u2019m still standing. That\u2019s all that matters. I need to keep standing tall against anything that gets in my way. And yes, that includes who you\u2019re working for too.\n\n\nBut I digress. I\u2019ll be waiting if you want to see me. I\u2019m free anytime. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a boat to catch.\n\n\n-O\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation of SCP-8926\u2019s whereabouts is \nongoing\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMerehrab's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-7550\n \n(+60)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8035\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7467\n \n(+21)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7163\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6461\n \n(+35)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nTurning Out\n \n(+18)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfatuation in Black\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackbird\n \n(+14)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Can\u2019t Kill The Idea of Me\n \n(+24)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nMerehrab\u2019s Musings\n \n(+34)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8926\n\" by Merehrab, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
