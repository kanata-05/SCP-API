All outbound communication from the town of Ambler will be screened, and revised by Site-24 AI \nDONA\n. Individuals made aware of SCP-5858 will be given Class-A amnesics.\n\n\nPersonnel must strictly adhere to their role when entering this Locked Scenario\n1\n. When asked to leave SCP-5858, personnel should do so as quickly and courteously as possible. Under no circumstance may anyone enter SCP-5858 posing as theater staff.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5858 is the Ambler Theater, located in the borough of Ambler, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 2018, this playhouse spontaneously entered a IO-Locked Scenario, and has since continued presenting \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" for 17,520 consecutive hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt-LS\u00a0|\u00a0Locked\u00a0Scenarios\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt-LS\u00a0|\u00a0Locked\u00a0Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Locked Scenario (LS)\n occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with \nTemporal Loops (TL)\n, which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principles. Often mischaracterized as \"hauntings\" or \"curses\", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include \nSCP-112\n, \nSCP-4382\n, and \nSCP-1337\n. As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution.\n\n\nAn LS will operate under two set variables: \nProtracted vs. Indefinite\n, and \nStatic vs. Organic.\n\n\n\n\nA Protracted LS (P-LS)\n will eventually self-terminate.\n\n\nAn Indefinite LS (I-LS)\n will be self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\nHigh-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or \"burnout\". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution.\n\n\n\n\nA Static LS (S-LS)\n will only repeat a sequence of events.\n\n\nAn Organic LS (O-LS)\n will \"progress\" within its own set confines.\n\n\n\n\nConsider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat its nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc.\n\n\n- Foundation Research Archives | Common Anomalous Zones and How they Operate, Volume 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 87 individuals affected by SCP-5858 directly, including the actors, stage hands, and audience members. All other residents of Ambler have been passively affected by this anomaly, believing the unnatural duration of the performance is completely unremarkable\n2\n.\n\n\nSCP-5858-1 through \n13\n 14 are the staff of the Ambler Theater, uniquely affected by the Locked Scenario. These individuals are easily identified by their red shirts, black vests, and perpetual full-body vibrations - visually resembling hummingbird wings in motion. All staff members have expressed enhanced speed, strength, and spacial awareness, operating at roughly 5 times that of baseline human capacity. While staff members will continue to perform their routine duties, albeit at a faster pace, their primary purpose is to act as Locked Scenario \"maintenance\", aggressively preventing all outside interference.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5858-TL Excerpts\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==============\nCONDITIONS\n==============\n\n\n===========\nRESULT\n===========\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-8743 is asked to enter SCP-5858, using a valid ticket, and posing as a patron.\n\n\nSubject allowed entry, and safely watches the play for 23 minutes. Subject is then asked to leave for coughing too loudly\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-8911 is told to enter SCP-5858 without a valid ticket, and to remain despite staff protests.\n\n\nAfter 4 minutes of trespassing, SCP-5858-1 (87-year-old Donald Miller) lifted D-8911 over his head, sprinted down three flights of stairs, and threw him outside. D-8911 suffered six broken ribs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-9013 is asked to enter SCP-5858 posing as a member of staff.\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n D-9013 is now classified as SCP-5858-14. Testing has been suspended at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, no test subject has managed to remain inside the theater for more than 3 hours before being ejected for some form of infraction.\n4\n On February 15th, 2020, Mobile Task Force Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\" were dispatched to contain/neutralize this anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 1 - SCP-5858\n\n\nDate:\n 15/02/2020 | 11:14\n\n\nLocation:\n Ambler Theater / SCP-5858\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\nSite-24:\n Xi-5, this is Command.

We're in full compliance with the scenario. Besides the earpieces, we're at zero equipment. I'm feeling a bit naked here.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n I told you to go with the high-neck, not the halter-strap.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n I meant the lack of tech, Sam. Though, yeah, it's going to be strange running this mission in heels.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Exactly why I chose the tux. I feel like I'm in a James Bond movie.\n\n\nXi-5-3|Volkov:\n You look just like the supervillain's butler, Samantha.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n So I look like \nyour\n butler, eh \"Volkov\"?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Enough, you two. We may be dressed as civilians, but we're still on the clock.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n He's right. Let's cut the chatter. On the flipside, Higs, we are pretending to be civvies. I'm gonna' need you to act like a person.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Yes, Captain.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Keep working on that. Command, we're ready for approach.\n\n\nSite-24:\n Copy, 5-1. Your objective is to locate the source of the anomaly. Neutralize, if possible, but use extreme caution.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n We've read the dossier, command - none of us want an ass-whooping from an octogenarian.\n\n\nSite-24:\n Good. Present your tickets at the gate, and maintain your cover as theater patrons. Keep radio chatter to a minimum. Good luck.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Alright Bullies, let's get weird.\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Xi-5 head to the main entrance to the theater. The ticket booth is manned by SCP-5858-6, 15 year old Edwin McAlister, who has been seated there for the past two years. Like all staff members, SCP-5858-6's head rapidly swivels in all directions, creating a featureless blur. McAlister focuses on 5-1 as she approaches, speaking rapidly, but clearly.\n\n\nMcAlister:\n \n(Spoken rapidly)\n Goodevening. Doyouhaveyourtickets?\n\n\n5-1 presents four tickets, recovered from absentees within Ambler.\n\n\nMcAlister:\n Thankyou. You'reabitlateyouknow.

Is everything alright? We're picking up some feedback on your transmission. Has the anomaly-\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n That's just echo. I'm uh-\u2026 I'm hiding out in the bathroom.\n\n\nSite-24:\n Oh, yes- of course. Report.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n It's about what we expected, Command - no time dilation or visual distortions, just an ongoing event; classic Locked Scenario. It's difficult to say anything else without my equipment. Saksa and Higs took-\n\n\nSite-24:\n Please use your call-signs, agent.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Right right, sorry. 5-1 and 5-2 took their seats near the front of the auditorium. The audience is fully embedded in the Scenario - no malnutrition, physical degradation or signs of distress. They don't even seem bored!\n\n\nThe play itself seems to be continuing way, way off the events of \"Streetcar\". Blanche escaped from the hospital several thousand acts ago, and is now on the run in Morocco. Stanley is still chasing her, but now it's because he was hired by Shep Huntleigh to hunt her down, since she stole this diamond that gives her supernatural-\n\n\nSite-24:\n Thank you, 5-4, but we already knew this was an O-LS.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Right, yeah. Sorry, It's just\u2026 surprisingly engaging! I don't know if I could sit through two whole years of it but- wait, hold on.\n\n\nA muffled groan is heard, followed by a sharp, quick 'thud'.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Sorry about that. This guy just won't stay down.\n\n\nSite-24:\n Guy? What guy? 5-4, what's happening?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n About that. We think we've found the source of the anomaly. Remember when I said no one looked bored? Well, Higs- sorry, 5-2, he noticed someone who was.\n\n\nSite-24:\n And did you- accost this person!?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n What? Oh, no, no this guy was just sitting \nnext\n to the subject. Sa- 5-1 signaled me to take him out, so I followed him into the bathroom. I tried to play nice, really, but this guy really, really wants to get back to his seat!\n\n\nSite-24:\n You were told not to break cover, 5-4. This \nabsolutely\n constitutes breaking cover.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Sorry Command, but like you said, we needed to work quickly. They know we're not supposed to be here. I can't even wipe my nose without one of those buzzing black-vested freaks shining a flashlight in my face! I feel like a germ in this theater's body, and the white blood cells are circling.\n\n\nSite-24:\n Still, this seems needlessly dangerous-\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n I know what it seems like, Command. I also know this is exactly why you transferred me to Xi-5. This is a team for problem solvers, yeah? We've got a plan. We're getting it done.\n\n\nSite-24:\n \n(\u2026)\n Copy, 5-4. Keep us apprised.\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n Copy that. Now I better get back out there. I don't want the ushers catching me-\n\n\nThe bathroom door is heard crashing open. 3 milliseconds of extremely rapid footsteps are heard before someone knocks violently on the stall door, cracking the linoleum.\n\n\nSCP-5858-3:\n \n(Spoken rapidly)\n Helloexcuseme. We'vereceivedsomecomplaintswouldyoupleasecomeout?\n\n\nXi-5-4|Fletcher:\n \n(\u2026)\n Fuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a03\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 3 - SCP-5858\n\n\nDate:\n 15/02/2020 | 14:38\n\n\nLocation:\n Ambler Theater / SCP-5858\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\nClaire Wilde|Blanche:\n You shouldn't have followed me Mitch - or should I say, Stanley?\n\n\nPhillip O'Connel|Stanley:\n What!? How did you know? My disguise was perfect!\n\n\nClaire Wilde|Blanche:\n The Diamond lets me see through your lies, Stanley. How could it not, when it holds Stella's very soul!\n\n\n5-2 re-enters the auditorium after visiting the concession stand, slipping into a seat in the back row. As he sits, faint electronic beeping is heard over 5-2's earpiece.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n \n(whispering)\n Hey.\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n \n(whispering)\n Um\u2026 hey?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Cool Gameboy. Is that Pokemon? I used to play Red and Blue with my little brother.\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n Yeah, uh, t-thanks\u2026 it- yeah, it's Pokemon\u2026\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Cool. Hey, this play's pretty boring, huh?\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n It's\u2026 it's alright. My parents like to bring me to this kinda' stuff\u2026\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Is that them over there? They seem\u2026 pretty focused.\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n They really like the theater.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Not you though?\n\n\nMore electronic noises, and tapping buttons are heard.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Yeah, same here. My- uh, fiance drags me to these things. She's down in the first row. I just wish I could get out of here, right?\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n N-\u2026 I mean- it's fine. It's- \u2026 it's better than-\u2026\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Than what? Hey\u2026 are you okay?\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n I'm fine.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n You sure? I can-\n\n\nFour sets of rapid footsteps are heard, converging on 5-2. Both 5-2 and the subject go quiet until the ushers move off.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n \n(lower whispering)\n What's your name?\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n \n(\u2026)\n Tim.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Hey Tim, I'm Yasuo.\n\n\nYoung boy(?):\n \n(\u2026)\n That's a cool name.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Thanks. Hey, you can keep playing Pokemon by the way. I won't tell.\n\n\nNo further electronic sounds are heard. Over the next twenty minutes, all actors begin to stutter and pause their lines mid-speech, similar to a skipping record. The music played between scenes goes off-tune.\n\n\nAbruptly, two characters enter the stage acting outside the current narrative. Their voices are unusually muffled when speaking, as if heard from behind a wall or door.\n\n\nMan(?):\n So what, I'm not allowed to have friends now!?\n\n\nWoman(?):\n Oh right, \"friends\". Like Doug was just a friend, right?\n\n\nMan(?):\n Yes! God, you're so paranoid! I can't even go to the bar anymore, or spend time with my co-workers because you assume I'm going to-\n\n\nWoman(?):\n You did though! We both know you like-\n\n\nMan(?):\n That was back in college! We're married now! We have a son! What else do I need to do to convince you I love you!?\n\n\nWoman(?):\n You could touch me, for once.\n\n\nMan(?):\n Oh of course. Of course! I bust my ass twelve hours a day, come home exhausted, and you use that as an excuse to call me a-\n\n\nWoman(?):\n Enough. We can't-\u2026 the neighbors are going to call the cops again. Let's just-\u2026 let's just get dressed. We promised we'd see Shelly's play tonight. We can talk about this when we get home.\n\n\nMan(?):\n \n(\u2026)\n Fine. We're talking about this though. Tonight, when we get home, we're settling this once and for all.\n\n\nThe two actors walk off stage. The audience claps. A sniffling sound is heard near 5-2.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Hey\u2026 Tim? Is everything-\n\n\nA loud humming noise overpowers the microphone. The audience rises from their seats. A voice comes from the stage.\n\n\nActor (?):\n That's intermission, folks! Please, grab yourself a soda or popcorn up front. We'll be back for act thirteen-thousand one-hundred and fifty-seven in just ten minutes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a04\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Log\u00a04\u00a0-\u00a015/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 4 - SCP-5858\n\n\nDate:\n 15/02/2020 | 14:55\n\n\nLocation:\n Ambler Theater / SCP-5858\n\n\nMTF:\n Xi-5 \"Newtons Bullies\"\n\n\n\n\n5-1 and 5-2 are heard surrounded by audience members in the main lobby. Two elderly patrons are standing nearby.\n\n\nAudience A(?):\n That last scene was breathtaking, don't you think? What do you suppose it represents?\n\n\nAudience B(?):\n I suspect it's another of Blanche's dream sequences, like in act five hundred and fifteen. Why must these local directors insist on their art-house nonsense?\n\n\nAudience A(?):\n Oh hush, darling. You've been grumbling and fidgeting for the past two months! I swear, you're like a child! I can't take you anywhere \n(laughing)\n.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Yasuo! Sweetheart! Where have you been?\n\n\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n \n(\u2026)\n Oh! Yes, hello\u2026 pumpkin. It was- uh- too loud, so close to the stage you know, so I took a seat further back. Say, what happened to our friend Samantha?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Had to run, I'm afraid. Poor thing has a terrible stomach bug. No less than five ushers had to help them outside!\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Are they alright?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Oh yes, they made it to the curb before- before anything bad happened.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n I'm glad. Actually, speaking of friends, I met the most interesting young man just before intermission. I think he might be-\n\n\nThe ambient volume begins to increase. Multiple couples begin shouting at each other.\n\n\nAudience A(?):\n Always fidgeting! I can't take you anywhere! You're such a fucking useless child!\n\n\nAudience B(?):\n To hell with you! I don't even want to be here!\n\n\nAudience C(?):\n Nag nag nag, constantly! You wonder why I spend so much time at work!\n\n\nAudience D(?):\n Oh you know why I spend so much time at work, you harpy! Why would I ever want to be at home with such a shit family!?\n\n\nAudience E(?):\n You don't love me anymore!

Higs, what are you doing?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Acting like a person.\n\n\n5-2 walks forward, the sound of popcorn crunching under his feet. As he approaches, the microphone gradually picks up the sound of a young boy crying.\n\n\nTransmission cut-off.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:13:\n All anomalous activity in Ambler abruptly ceases. Friends and family of those within SCP-5858 begin panicking. At the same time, the doors to SCP-5858 open, and people begin to exit. Many collapse into the street, openly weep, or stumble around catatonic. All members of Xi-5 report in safe.\n\n\nAddendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:17:\n The last three audience members exit the theater. A young boy is seen standing between a man and a woman, holding both their hands. The trio walk down the town's main street until reaching the first intersection. They embrace, then walk a short distance in separate directions before vanishing.\n\n\nAddendum - Site-24 | Director Morgan:\n Reclassification to Neutralized pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\u00a0Action\u00a0Report\u00a0-\u00a016/02/2020\n\n\n\n\nAfter\u00a0Action\u00a0Report\u00a0-\u00a016/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Action Report - Captain Lyydia Saksa - SCP-5858\n\n\nDate:\n 16/02/2020 | 13:01\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-24 Briefing Room.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n What exactly happened in there, Captain?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n I've given you my report.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n You have, yes, but there are still-\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Ma'am, with all due respect, the ink is already dry on this. You asked me what happened, and I gave you the full, clinical details.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n \n(\u2026)\n So that's all you have to report? You didn't, at all, hear what 5-2 said to the boy?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n My ears were still ringing, ma'am - from all the shouting, you know. I just saw him approach the subject. I didn't hear anything.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n I see. Thank you Captain, that will be all.\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n He's a good agent.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n Pardon me?\n\n\nXi-5-1|Saksa:\n Higashi. He's a damn good agent - a bit uptight sometimes, maybe, but- okay, look, I know you're raking him over the coals right now. I may not know what he said to that kid, but ma'am, I know he said it for the right reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Action Report - Agent Yasuo Higashi - SCP-5858\n\n\nDate:\n 16/02/2020 | 17:16\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-24 Directors Office.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n Take a seat, Agent.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n I'll stand, if you don't mind.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n \n(\u2026)\n Very well. I think you know why you're here.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Yes ma'am.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n During the broadcast cut-out, your earpiece automatically switched to hard backup. Everything was still recorded. We know exactly what you said to the anomaly.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n The kid, you mean.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n The anomaly, Agent. Do you have any idea what you've done?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n Yes ma'am. I sat down with a kid who's parents were fighting. I told him that I'd gone through the same thing. I saw a young man in need of help, and I helped him.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n That \"young man\" is a reality bender, Agent. He created a Locked Scenario that kept 86 people trapped in a theater for two full years.\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n And now they're not trapped anymore. Mission successful.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n You can't possibly be this obtuse. You solved a problem by creating a catastrophe! We now have a sentient reality-warper out in the world with a twelve-year-old's sense of morality and consequences! Does that still sound like a \"success\" to you, Agent Higashi?\n\n\nXi-5-2|Higashi:\n \n(\u2026)\n No ma'am.\n\n\nDirector Morgan:\n Do you realize how inconceivably dangerous it is to give an adult reality bender even \npartial\n awareness of their own abilities?

        "A Locked Scenario (LS) occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with Temporal Loops (TL) , which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principles. Often mischaracterized as \"hauntings\" or \"curses\", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include SCP-112 , SCP-4382 , and SCP-1337 . As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution. An LS will operate under two set variables: Protracted vs. Indefinite , and Static vs. Organic. A Protracted LS (P-LS) will eventually self-terminate. An Indefinite LS (I-LS) will be self-sustaining. High-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or \"burnout\". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution. A Static LS (S-LS) will only repeat a sequence of events. An Organic LS (O-LS) will \"progress\" within its own set confines. Consider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat its nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc. - Foundation Research Archives | Common Anomalous Zones and How they Operate, Volume 12.",

Xi-5-1|Saksa: 5-1, coms online. Xi-5-2|Higashi: 5-2, coms online. Xi-5-3|Volkov: 5-3, coms online. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: 5-4, coms online. Xi-5-1|Saksa: Xi-5 is green, Command. We're in full compliance with the scenario. Besides the earpieces, we're at zero equipment. I'm feeling a bit naked here. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: I told you to go with the high-neck, not the halter-strap. Xi-5-1|Saksa: I meant the lack of tech, Sam. Though, yeah, it's going to be strange running this mission in heels. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Exactly why I chose the tux. I feel like I'm in a James Bond movie. Xi-5-3|Volkov: You look just like the supervillain's butler, Samantha. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: So I look like your butler, eh \"Volkov\"? Xi-5-2|Higashi: Enough, you two. We may be dressed as civilians, but we're still on the clock. Xi-5-1|Saksa: He's right. Let's cut the chatter. On the flipside, Higs, we are pretending to be civvies. I'm gonna' need you to act like a person. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Yes, Captain. Xi-5-1|Saksa: Keep working on that. Command, we're ready for approach. Site-24: Copy, 5-1. Your objective is to locate the source of the anomaly. Neutralize, if possible, but use extreme caution. Xi-5-1|Saksa: We've read the dossier, command - none of us want an ass-whooping from an octogenarian. Site-24: Good. Present your tickets at the gate, and maintain your cover as theater patrons. Keep radio chatter to a minimum. Good luck. Xi-5-1|Saksa: Alright Bullies, let's get weird. MTF-Xi-5 head to the main entrance to the theater. The ticket booth is manned by SCP-5858-6, 15 year old Edwin McAlister, who has been seated there for the past two years. Like all staff members, SCP-5858-6's head rapidly swivels in all directions, creating a featureless blur. McAlister focuses on 5-1 as she approaches, speaking rapidly, but clearly. McAlister: (Spoken rapidly) Goodevening. Doyouhaveyourtickets? 5-1 presents four tickets, recovered from absentees within Ambler. McAlister: Thankyou. You'reabitlateyouknow. You'vealreadymissedthethirteenthousandth onehundredandfiftythirdact. Xi-5-1|Saksa: Oh, yes, sorry, we were- uh, held up in traffic. McAlister: Noproblem. Justheadinduringintermission. Enjoytheshow!

Site-24: Received, 5-4. Is everything alright? We're picking up some feedback on your transmission. Has the anomaly- Xi-5-4|Fletcher: That's just echo. I'm uh-\u2026 I'm hiding out in the bathroom. Site-24: Oh, yes- of course. Report. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: It's about what we expected, Command - no time dilation or visual distortions, just an ongoing event; classic Locked Scenario. It's difficult to say anything else without my equipment. Saksa and Higs took- Site-24: Please use your call-signs, agent. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Right right, sorry. 5-1 and 5-2 took their seats near the front of the auditorium. The audience is fully embedded in the Scenario - no malnutrition, physical degradation or signs of distress. They don't even seem bored! The play itself seems to be continuing way, way off the events of \"Streetcar\". Blanche escaped from the hospital several thousand acts ago, and is now on the run in Morocco. Stanley is still chasing her, but now it's because he was hired by Shep Huntleigh to hunt her down, since she stole this diamond that gives her supernatural- Site-24: Thank you, 5-4, but we already knew this was an O-LS. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Right, yeah. Sorry, It's just\u2026 surprisingly engaging! I don't know if I could sit through two whole years of it but- wait, hold on. A muffled groan is heard, followed by a sharp, quick 'thud'. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Sorry about that. This guy just won't stay down. Site-24: Guy? What guy? 5-4, what's happening? Xi-5-4|Fletcher: About that. We think we've found the source of the anomaly. Remember when I said no one looked bored? Well, Higs- sorry, 5-2, he noticed someone who was. Site-24: And did you- accost this person!? Xi-5-4|Fletcher: What? Oh, no, no this guy was just sitting next to the subject. Sa- 5-1 signaled me to take him out, so I followed him into the bathroom. I tried to play nice, really, but this guy really, really wants to get back to his seat! Site-24: You were told not to break cover, 5-4. This absolutely constitutes breaking cover. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Sorry Command, but like you said, we needed to work quickly. They know we're not supposed to be here. I can't even wipe my nose without one of those buzzing black-vested freaks shining a flashlight in my face! I feel like a germ in this theater's body, and the white blood cells are circling. Site-24: Still, this seems needlessly dangerous- Xi-5-4|Fletcher: I know what it seems like, Command. I also know this is exactly why you transferred me to Xi-5. This is a team for problem solvers, yeah? We've got a plan. We're getting it done. Site-24: (\u2026) Copy, 5-4. Keep us apprised. Xi-5-4|Fletcher: Copy that. Now I better get back out there. I don't want the ushers catching me- The bathroom door is heard crashing open. 3 milliseconds of extremely rapid footsteps are heard before someone knocks violently on the stall door, cracking the linoleum. SCP-5858-3: (Spoken rapidly) Helloexcuseme. We'vereceivedsomecomplaintswouldyoupleasecomeout? Xi-5-4|Fletcher: (\u2026) Fuck.",

Phillip O'Connel|Stanley: What!? How did you know? My disguise was perfect! Claire Wilde|Blanche: The Diamond lets me see through your lies, Stanley. How could it not, when it holds Stella's very soul! 5-2 re-enters the auditorium after visiting the concession stand, slipping into a seat in the back row. As he sits, faint electronic beeping is heard over 5-2's earpiece. Xi-5-2|Higashi: (whispering) Hey. Young boy(?): (whispering) Um\u2026 hey? Xi-5-2|Higashi: Cool Gameboy. Is that Pokemon? I used to play Red and Blue with my little brother. Young boy(?): Yeah, uh, t-thanks\u2026 it- yeah, it's Pokemon\u2026 Xi-5-2|Higashi: Cool. Hey, this play's pretty boring, huh? Young boy(?): It's\u2026 it's alright. My parents like to bring me to this kinda' stuff\u2026 Xi-5-2|Higashi: Is that them over there? They seem\u2026 pretty focused. Young boy(?): They really like the theater. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Not you though? More electronic noises, and tapping buttons are heard. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Yeah, same here. My- uh, fiance drags me to these things. She's down in the first row. I just wish I could get out of here, right? Young boy(?): N-\u2026 I mean- it's fine. It's- \u2026 it's better than-\u2026 Xi-5-2|Higashi: Than what? Hey\u2026 are you okay? Young boy(?): I'm fine. Xi-5-2|Higashi: You sure? I can- Four sets of rapid footsteps are heard, converging on 5-2. Both 5-2 and the subject go quiet until the ushers move off. Xi-5-2|Higashi: (lower whispering) What's your name? Young boy(?): (\u2026) Tim. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Hey Tim, I'm Yasuo. Young boy(?): (\u2026) That's a cool name. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Thanks. Hey, you can keep playing Pokemon by the way. I won't tell. No further electronic sounds are heard. Over the next twenty minutes, all actors begin to stutter and pause their lines mid-speech, similar to a skipping record. The music played between scenes goes off-tune. Abruptly, two characters enter the stage acting outside the current narrative. Their voices are unusually muffled when speaking, as if heard from behind a wall or door. Man(?): So what, I'm not allowed to have friends now!? Woman(?): Oh right, \"friends\". Like Doug was just a friend, right? Man(?): Yes! God, you're so paranoid! I can't even go to the bar anymore, or spend time with my co-workers because you assume I'm going to- Woman(?): You did though! We both know you like- Man(?): That was back in college! We're married now! We have a son! What else do I need to do to convince you I love you!? Woman(?): You could touch me, for once. Man(?): Oh of course. Of course! I bust my ass twelve hours a day, come home exhausted, and you use that as an excuse to call me a- Woman(?): Enough. We can't-\u2026 the neighbors are going to call the cops again. Let's just-\u2026 let's just get dressed. We promised we'd see Shelly's play tonight. We can talk about this when we get home. Man(?): (\u2026) Fine. We're talking about this though. Tonight, when we get home, we're settling this once and for all. The two actors walk off stage. The audience claps. A sniffling sound is heard near 5-2. Xi-5-2|Higashi: Hey\u2026 Tim? Is everything- A loud humming noise overpowers the microphone. The audience rises from their seats. A voice comes from the stage. Actor (?): That's intermission, folks! Please, grab yourself a soda or popcorn up front. We'll be back for act thirteen-thousand one-hundred and fifty-seven in just ten minutes!",

Two elderly patrons are standing nearby. Audience A(?): That last scene was breathtaking, don't you think? What do you suppose it represents? Audience B(?): I suspect it's another of Blanche's dream sequences, like in act five hundred and fifteen. Why must these local directors insist on their art-house nonsense? Audience A(?): Oh hush, darling. You've been grumbling and fidgeting for the past two months! I swear, you're like a child! I can't take you anywhere (laughing) . Xi-5-1|Saksa: Yasuo! Sweetheart! Where have you been? Xi-5-2|Higashi: (\u2026) Oh! Yes, hello\u2026 pumpkin. It was- uh- too loud, so close to the stage you know, so I took a seat further back. Say, what happened to our friend Samantha? Xi-5-1|Saksa: Had to run, I'm afraid. Poor thing has a terrible stomach bug. No less than five ushers had to help them outside! Xi-5-2|Higashi: Are they alright? Xi-5-1|Saksa: Oh yes, they made it to the curb before- before anything bad happened. Xi-5-2|Higashi: I'm glad. Actually, speaking of friends, I met the most interesting young man just before intermission. I think he might be- The ambient volume begins to increase. Multiple couples begin shouting at each other. Audience A(?): Always fidgeting! I can't take you anywhere! You're such a fucking useless child! Audience B(?): To hell with you! I don't even want to be here! Audience C(?): Nag nag nag, constantly! You wonder why I spend so much time at work! Audience D(?): Oh you know why I spend so much time at work, you harpy! Why would I ever want to be at home with such a shit family!? Audience E(?): You don't love me anymore! You never loved me! Audience F(?): I don't even know you anymore!

Audience D(?): Just talk to me, damn it! Audience A(?): (Screaming) Get the fuck away from me! All 87 individuals inside SCP-5858 suddenly go silent, followed by a single, audible 'slap'.

Xi-5-2|Higashi: Acting like a person. 5-2 walks forward, the sound of popcorn crunching under his feet. As he approaches, the microphone gradually picks up the sound of a young boy crying.
