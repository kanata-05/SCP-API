Containment, and/or the acquisition of additional information regarding locations or the exact number of extant SCP-5298 instances, would constitute a breach of this agreement, and carry the risk of a \u00deK-class Extradimensional Diplomatic Breakdown scenario.\n\n\nAs such, this document contains the maximum amount of information regarding SCP-5298 that the Foundation is permitted to access. Unless emergency authorization has been given by the O5 Council, this document is to not be altered in any form.\n\n\nIn addition, efforts to obfuscate SCP-5298's existence from the public are to be handled exclusively by the Three Moons Initiative, without any further interference from the Foundation.\n\n\nShould SCP-5298's existence come into public knowledge through second- or third-party error, Settlement-841-M is rendered void, SCP-5298 will be reclassified as Keter, and the encrypted prior iteration of this document will be restored.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5298 is a remote-controlled military drone used by the Three Moons Initiative. An estimated \u2588\u2588\u2588 SCP-5298 instances are currently operational. The full scope of their combat capabilities are not completely understood, but include 5.7x28mm machine guns (hidden in forearms), finger-mounted electroshock weapons (hidden in fingernails), and neurotoxin-injecting barbs (hidden in teeth).\n\n\nEach individual SCP-5298 takes the appearance of a child between 5 and 13 years of age, and maintains an individual assumed identity. As such, each drone uses civilian property purchased by Three Moons agents as a staging area, staging up to three instances at a time, and handled by one man and one woman to act as \"parents\". Said handlers are willing participants, designated \"pre-mortem undercover contractors\" by the Initiative, and have experience in such fields as robotics, military technology, and method acting.\n\n\nSCP-5298 work undercover in private and public settings, engaging in as much aggressive and problematic behavior as possible. Conduct includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nShoplifting,\n\n\ntemper tantrums,\n\n\nvandalism,\n\n\nlying,\n\n\nbullying of other children,\n\n\npulling fire alarms, and\n\n\ndestruction of property.\n\n\n\n\nDue to their destructive capabilities, SCP-5298 will avoid direct physical violence toward civilians and more serious criminal activity.\n\n\nAt nighttime, SCP-5298 engage in their true purpose. Further information about SCP-5298 (including the targets of their extermination efforts) have been restricted by Settlement-841-M.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Foundation agents placed a hidden camera in the bedroom of one SCP-5298 instance in suburban Philadelphia. The following footage was recovered, leading to Settlement-841-M:\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 11/10/20\n\n\nTime:\n 1:42 AM, EST\n\n\n<begin log>\n\n\n[SCP-5298-\u2588\u2588 feigns sleep.
