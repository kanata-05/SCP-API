Subjects who perceive SCP-7951-1 believe that the liquid inside is \"not how they like their tea\" and upon tasting the beverage will note that it is \"too cold\" in addition to a series of other subjective qualitative notes. The exception to this is Researcher Paul Jones, who says that the liquid inside is \"exactly how [he likes] it.\"\n\n\nSCP-7951-2 is empty.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7951 was discovered in the home of Researcher Paul Jones shortly after the finalization of inheritance proceedings on 10/15/2023. When questioned, Jones stated, \"My room's still how I left it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7951\n\" by PoufyPoufson and IndustryStandard, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
