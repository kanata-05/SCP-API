The isolation of SCP-3152 from sources of mail is adequate containment to ensure its effects do not spread.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3152 is a small white envelope containing a letter signed by an Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. No anomalous effects appear until contact with other postage occurs. When SCP-3152 comes into contact with a sealed envelope, the contents inside are changed to a letter similar to the original. These instances are classified as SCP-3152-1. SCP-3152-1 instances act as an extension of the subject matter detailed in SCP-3152. The leading theory is that SCP-3152 infects letters around it with the thoughts that Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was thinking at the time of writing.\n\n\nThe first instance of SCP-3152-1 was brought to the Foundation's attention when Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had brought a letter to the attention of his colleagues. When asked if he had ever been to Connecticut, Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 couldn\u2019t remember ever visiting there. A quick investigation had discovered three more instances of SCP-3152-1 by cross-referencing delivery routes for mail sent by Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. These were swiftly obtained by Foundation personnel and the recipients were administered a class-A Amnestic. This investigation lead to the acquisition of SCP-3152, which was found unsent in a post office near Abigail's address in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Connecticut.\n\n\nSince the acquisition of SCP-3152, Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been located as well. Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had passed away a week after SCP-3152 was entered into circulation. She is not believed to have had anomalous properties before her passing. Interviews with the subject of the letters is detailed in Addendum-3152-A.\n\n\nTranscripts of SCP-3152 and instances of SCP-3152-1 are available below:\n\n\nSCP-3152 transcript:\n\n\n\n\nDo you remember me? It\u2019s been so long that I could swear that I\u2019m not real to you anymore. When you left me alone, all I could think about was what I had done to deserve this silence. I wasn\u2019t the best. I wasn\u2019t the one you deserved, but I wasn\u2019t the one you should have hated either. Or, I should say I don\u2019t want you to hate me. I want to forget what happened\u2026\n\n\nTo forget the weeks before\u2026\n\n\nTo forget the days I didn\u2019t see it\u2026\n\n\nTo forget that morning that I wouldn\u2019t leave you alone\u2026\n\n\nAnd to forget that night you left\u2026\n\n\nI want to forget, and maybe that would bring you back.\n\n\nI want to make it disappear. I\u2019m suffocating on the memories, I want to burn them away and never hear your voice telling me you don\u2019t want to\u2026 that you can\u2019t see me anymore.\n\nI still love you. I still think about the summers when you were around, just me and you without the pain and the discomfort. I want to know what I have to do, what I can do to make you love me again.\n\nI\u2019ve tried before. I\u2019ve tried to tell you how I feel. I\u2019ve lost the words by now, this is all I can write. Jumbled up thoughts tightening and balling up in my throat. I didn\u2019t mean for this, for any of this to happen. You don\u2019t have to believe me, but I didn\u2019t know at the time. I was dumb, I was a dumb kid and you were the world to me. If I knew then that\u2026 If I knew what I did was going to make you leave\u2026 I swear, I wouldn\u2019t have done any of it.\n\n\nWhatever you hear, I want you to know I love you. Don\u2019t think what I\u2019m going to, or would have done when you get this is your fault.\n\n\nRemember that, okay? It isn\u2019t your fault. The fault lies with me.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3152-1-1 Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nDo you remember December, the month before you left? Right before Christmas break. Our parents were out of town, you came over for the first time since graduation. I was so happy, you could probably tell, I\u2019m horrible at hiding my feelings. I was actually horrible at hiding anything at all\u2026 I\u2019d always have my special ways of annoying people to the point they couldn\u2019t stand me. I was loud, and didn\u2019t know what to say half the time, which made for an\u2026 interesting combination. But you seemed to like me anyways. I was glad that you stuck around for as long as you did.\n\n\nThis was going to be the night where I finally told you how much you meant to me. I decided, it was written down in my notebook and everything. Looking back, it was probably a horrible time to drop this knowledge bomb on you. I should have kept it to myself, you weren\u2019t doing too well and\u2026 I was dumb. I\u2019ve told you before right? I\u2019m not the smartest person in the world, I have trouble understanding social cues.\n\n\nWhat I did know, was that I loved you more than the minty hot chocolate I made when you came over. What I didn\u2019t know\u2026 was that this would be the last time I was able to talk to you like friends. That you\u2026 didn\u2019t feel the same way? It\u2019s hard to tell, even now I\u2019m not quite sure. When you said yes, when you accepted me and we hugged and\u2026 yeah, even then I didn\u2019t know what you were thinking. You seemed happy. I liked that, I liked seeing you happy.\n\n\nThings were going well for a while after that. I think at least, we didn\u2019t get much time together. You\u2019d come over when you could, or I\u2019d go over to your place. We didn\u2019t talk much, maybe that was the problem? I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t blame you for anything. What\u2019s happening\u2026 It\u2019s not your fault, okay?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3152-1-2 Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nIt was\u2026 hey you remember right? The final week we were together before you left. We visited that stream behind your house. The ice was so beautiful, shimmering so brightly that I felt my heart in my throat. Sitting on these, giant rocks, right beside each other. I\u2019m sure, 100% sure that I had the stupidest smile on my face when you held my hand. I was so happy I couldn\u2019t shut up. If I had stopped talking, would you have\u2026\n\n\nAnyways, when I looked over to you and saw you crying I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do. I didn\u2019t know what I did, I didn\u2019t pay attention to you. You pulled away from my hand. I said I was sorry, but you didn\u2019t say anything. I still remember you walking away from me. I should have paid more attention then.\n\n\nI was so scared that I tried to run after you. I\u2019ve never heard you raise your voice before then. I was so shocked I couldn\u2019t bring myself to move. You just kept walking and I was frozen in place. I was so happy before, I don\u2019t know what I was feeling right then but it was like the scenery around me didn\u2019t exist. Everything went white around you as you disappeared.\n\n\nWould I ever know what I did? I\u2019ve wanted to ask you what I did to make you walk away that day. Every day after I\u2019d try to go over to your house, but you weren\u2019t there. I wish I had known what I had said to make you cry. Maybe it would be different if you could have told me?\n\n\nNo, I don\u2019t blame you at all. It isn\u2019t your fault, It\u2019s all on me.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3152-1-3 Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nI try to remember what I was thinking that morning, every day since then. I can\u2019t shake it from my head. What I could have done to have you disappear, to leave me to drown without you. Do you remember? You hadn\u2019t left your house in days. I walked up to your door, for the final time. You were home, I tried to smile but the act of curving my lips curled my stomach into itself. Your eyes were dark, your face was pale. You looked like you hadn\u2019t slept in days. Did what I do hurt you so deeply that you had to look at me with those eyes? They pierced me so deep I could feel you ripping into my soul.\n\n\nYou moved out of the doorway, like you wanted me to enter. You sighed when I walked past you and were silent on the way to your room. Your parents weren\u2019t home, it was a mess. I remember the smell of the kitchen lingering in my nostrils as you shut the door to your room. I sat on your bed, looking at you, just standing there. You sat down next to me, with your eyes stuck focusing on your feet. Why couldn\u2019t you look at me then? I know I asked, a lot, but I still want to know.\n\n\nFeeling your hand on mine, this time didn\u2019t feel as good as the first time. It stung when your fingers connected with mine. I didn\u2019t know what I did to hurt you. I asked you what was wrong, you tried to answer. Was the cracking in your voice the sign I should have left? I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not good with people. I know something hurt you, I know it was probably me. I\u2019ve annoyed so many people, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. You sighed, you sighed so hard I thought you were going to pass out.\n\n\nYour words are scratched into my brain, clawed in deeper than I ever thought possible.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You said so silently I barely heard it.\n\n\n\u201cThis was a bad time.\u201d You were crying again. I tried to put my hand to your cheek but your tears were so hot, I could feel your sadness burning my skin.\n\n\n\u201cI made a mistake.\u201d Was this about me? Was I a mistake\u2026To you? I wouldn\u2019t get an answer to that, you left your own room as quickly as those words left your lips. I walked home crying.\n\n\nBut I don\u2019t blame you for making me cry, I made you upset first.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your fault, It was mine.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3152-1-4 Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nI saw you outside my window. You remember, right? You were looking right at me, your cheeks were red. Why were you standing out in the cold? When I opened the front door, and you refused to come in I knew something was wrong. I looked at you for so long, that silence was crushing.\n\n\nYou held my face, I almost jumped. I wasn\u2019t expecting it, I wasn\u2019t ready for what you were going to say. I knew what was coming\u2026 I knew what was coming but it still hit me like a train. That you couldn\u2019t see me again. That this was the last time I would ever see you.\n\n\nWe both cried for so long I could feel the tears on my cheek freezing. You looked me in the eyes and told me the sweetest lie I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d But I knew better. I tried to hug you, I didn\u2019t want to let you go. You cried so loud I think you woke the neighbours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s not your fault, okay?\u201d You screamed, as you walked away from me. That was the last time I saw you.\n\n\nAs soon as I went back inside I missed you.\n\nFor weeks after, I missed you.\n\nI still miss you, I loved you so much. Whatever I did to cause you to leave me, I want to know.. I want to know why your final words were such a sweet lie. Did you know they would haunt my dreams? Did you know those words would make me agonise over every dumb thing I had done? I deserve it, I know.\n\n\nIt was my fault, I know it was. I don\u2019t blame you, I blame myself.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-3152-A: Interview Log\n\nThe would-be recipient of SCP-3152 was located shortly after its acquisition. The recipient has been identified as Ellie \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I know something hurt you, I know it was probably me. I\u2019ve annoyed so many people, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. You sighed, you sighed so hard I thought you were going to pass out. Your words are scratched into my brain, clawed in deeper than I ever thought possible. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You said so silently I barely heard it. \u201cThis was a bad time.\u201d You were crying again. I tried to put my hand to your cheek but your tears were so hot, I could feel your sadness burning my skin. \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d Was this about me? Was I a mistake\u2026To you? I wouldn\u2019t get an answer to that, you left your own room as quickly as those words left your lips. I walked home crying. But I don\u2019t blame you for making me cry, I made you upset first. It wasn\u2019t your fault, It was mine.",
        "I saw you outside my window. You remember, right? You were looking right at me, your cheeks were red. Why were you standing out in the cold? When I opened the front door, and you refused to come in I knew something was wrong. I looked at you for so long, that silence was crushing. You held my face, I almost jumped. I wasn\u2019t expecting it, I wasn\u2019t ready for what you were going to say. I knew what was coming\u2026 I knew what was coming but it still hit me like a train. That you couldn\u2019t see me again. That this was the last time I would ever see you. We both cried for so long I could feel the tears on my cheek freezing. You looked me in the eyes and told me the sweetest lie I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d But I knew better. I tried to hug you, I didn\u2019t want to let you go. You cried so loud I think you woke the neighbours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s not your fault, okay?\u201d You screamed, as you walked away from me. That was the last time I saw you. As soon as I went back inside I missed you. For weeks after, I missed you. I still miss you, I loved you so much. Whatever I did to cause you to leave me, I want to know.. I want to know why your final words were such a sweet lie. Did you know they would haunt my dreams? Did you know those words would make me agonise over every dumb thing I had done? I deserve it, I know. It was my fault, I know it was. I don\u2019t blame you, I blame myself.",

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-3152 is placed with the instances of SCP-3152-1-1 through SCP-3152-1-4 in a standard containment locker at Site-19. The isolation of SCP-3152 from sources of mail is adequate containment to ensure its effects do not spread.",
    "description": "SCP-3152 is a small white envelope containing a letter signed by an Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. No anomalous effects appear until contact with other postage occurs. When SCP-3152 comes into contact with a sealed envelope, the contents inside are changed to a letter similar to the original. These instances are classified as SCP-3152-1. SCP-3152-1 instances act as an extension of the subject matter detailed in SCP-3152. The leading theory is that SCP-3152 infects letters around it with the thoughts that Abigail \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was thinking at the time of writing.",
