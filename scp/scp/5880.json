Access to the item or information regarding the item is prohibited unless approved by the item's acting HMCL Supervisor, currently Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson.\n\n\nKnown instances of SCP-5880-1 are to be sedated for approximately 3 weeks. Recovered instances are to be quarantined until 24 hours after the cessation of symptoms, at which point they are to be subjected to amnestic therapy sufficient to eradicate all memories of the symptomatic period.\n\n\nParavirology Division Unit 2 has been assigned to the investigation of SCP-5880 and other non-anomalous strains of influenza and develop vaccinations as necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5880 is an anomalous, highly contagious strain of Influenza B contracted through either physical or memetic infection. Initial infection of SCP-5880 progresses similarly to other, non-anomalous infections. Common symptoms include coughing, congestion, upper respiratory irritation, head/body ache, fever, and fatigue. Due to the anomalous effects of SCP-5880, infected individuals are significantly less likely to receive medical assistance, and thus more likely to suffer complications. The current fatality rate is approximately 32%.\n\n\nSCP-5880-1 designates any symptomatic carriers of SCP-5880. Anomalous properties manifest with the onset of compulsory symptoms, approximately 48 hours after initial infection. Following this, individuals will begin to religiously worship the influenza virus, as well as related infections and symptoms. The specific actions varies between individuals, but in all instances, individuals will attempt to actively transmit SCP-5880 and proliferate instances of SCP-5880-1. Sedation during the symptomatic period of SCP-5880 infection has thus far been effective in preventing this effect.\n\n\nAddendum 5880-1:\n Discovery\n\n\nOn 11/12/2019, Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson submitted a behavioral report regarding his assigned team of Foundation personnel investigating the global outbreak of Influenza B for potentially anomalous influences.

In short, personnel have taken a religious stance regarding our current investigation into the global Influenza B outbreak, and are actively \nworshiping the flu\n, including compromising the sanitation of the facilities by actively spreading infections.\n\n\nOur whole site is in total disarray, and I am not completely sure how to describe the situation. I am requesting a formal retrieval and disinfection program, considering the severity of the situation.\n\n\nAttached are several documents to corroborate my claims.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Lukas Johansson\n\n\nParavirology Division Unit 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Surveillance\u00a0Report\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Recording Transcript\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 11/2/2019\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInvolved:\n\n\n\n\nField Agent Naomi Hoffman\n\n\nJunior Researcher Jordan Keane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nHoffman coughs into into her elbow while Keane is passing.\n)\n\n\nKeane:\n Bless you.\n\n\n(\nHoffman turns to face Keane.\n)\n\n\nHoffman:\n Umm\u2026that was a cough.\n\n\nKeane:\n Not merely a cough, I pray.\n\n\nHoffman:\n I didn't really take you for the religious type-\n\n\n(\nKeane proceeds to cough into his hands and reaches towards Hoffman's face.\n)\n\n\nHoffman:\n What the \nhell\n are you doing?\n\n\nKeane:\n May the Glorious Influenza, the Great and Contagious, bless you and keep you-\n\n\n(\nHoffman pushes Keane away.\n)\n\n\nHoffman:\n Calm the fuck down.

Let's start with the former.\n\n\nJohansson:\n As I'm sure you know, every year, one research team from the paravirology division is assigned to investigate influenza, since its pervasiveness makes it extremely susceptible to anomalous influences, or at the very least, compromises immune systems, allowing anomalous infections to occur.\n\n\n(\nJohansson leans forward and places his palms together.\n)\n\n\nJohansson:\n This year, it wasn't a secondary infection, but the flu \nitself.\n\n\nNguyen:\n How so?\n\n\nJohansson:\n I'm not completely sure \nhow\n, but I \ndo\n know is that it has something to do with influenza's genetic instability. You know how every year, the civilian population is administered a different vaccine?\n\n\nNguyen:\n Of course.\n\n\nJohansson:\n Influenza develops mutations quite rapidly. This appears to be some\u2026extreme mutation, allowing for optimal proliferation. Strain B infects basically only humans, or at least what resembles human organic material. And I think that somehow, this strain has adapted to human \nintelligence.\n\n\nNguyen:\n But the Foundation has dealt with superviruses before. They simply become immune to vaccines, or develop a counter-\n\n\nJohansson:\n No, no, not like that. The vaccine for influenza has been available for, what, 80 years? Life \nalways\n finds a way. Think about it. Why keep trying to fighting, if you can just convince them to \ngive up?\n\n\nNguyen:\n Or better yet\u2026to worship you.\n\n\nJohansson:\n Exactly. And if it's already done it once, it'll probably be able to do it again.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nJohansson:\n Now that we've got the \nbad\n news out of the way, let me tell you the \ngood\n news.\n\n\nNguyen:\n What's the good news?\n\n\nJohansson:\n Well. As usual, when a contagious disease affects a population, individuals begin developing immunity.\n\n\n(\nJohansson leans back into his chair and crosses his arm.\n)\n\n\nNguyen:\n You're saying you're immune.\n\n\n(\nJohansson returns to a normal sitting position.\n)\n\n\nJohansson:\n I've displayed absolutely \nno\n symptoms. No coughing, fever\u2026no compulsive effects, either.\n\n\n(\nNguyen furrows his brow.\n)\n\n\nNguyen:\n So you're saying that\u2026we can neutralize the flu?\n\n\nJohansson:\n Not quite. Even the Foundation hasn't been able to completely neutralize the flu. Believe me; I was part of the 2009 flu team, and we all know how \nthat\n went. New strains pop up all the time.\n\n\nNguyen:\n So what \nare\n you suggesting?\n\n\nJohansson:\n We figure out what makes it work. Every non-anomalous disease, we can see \nwhy\n certain symptoms occur. Now we have a sample of the disease, and an individual that is immune.\n\n\n(\nJohansson point to the door.\n)\n\n\nJohansson:\n Out there, there's dozens of people who we know are \nnot\n immune. And if that's not enough, we have a few dozen more D-Class. We can compare our genetics, figure out how the hell it's getting into peoples' minds.\n\n\nNguyen:\n I see.\n\n\nJohasson:\n First thing I'm doing when this is done, I'm submitting a request to the paravirology division administration. See if the Foundation can't vaccinate the damn flu.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/2019, Site-\u2588\u2588 was reclaimed following the simultaneous deployment of several recontainment units.

Now, Ms. Sherman, how's your memory?\n\n\nSherman:\n A bit\u2026blurred. It's kind of like getting amnesticized\u2026after, I mean. Obviously I don't remember \ngetting\n amnesticized.\n\n\nNguyen:\n I see. So, you recall the events that occurred in November?\n\n\nSherman:\n Unfortunately, yes.\n\n\nNguyen:\n Right. What's your first memory of the incident?\n\n\nSherman:\n Well, I don't remember when I got infected. I think I started doing the \"Church of Influenza\" stuff around\u2026let's see\u2026Wednesday. In October.\n\n\nNguyen:\n So this began in October?\n\n\nSherman:\n I think\u2026yeah. That's right. Must have started coughing and stuff around the same time. Hart - the doc in charge of sanitation - got on me about that. Pretty soon, I was coughing intentionally, but since I'm a field agent, I only met with a few people before the whole thing blew up. I think\u2026hang on\u2026\n\n\n(\nSherman furrows her brow and appears to be deep in concentration.\n)\n\n\nSherman:\n I think it was Bates or Watson next. Bates wrote up some flu bible, and Watson called in a sick day around that time. Since Watson was out, Johansson took full administration, and, well, after that, you know what happened.\n\n\nNguyen:\n What do you know about Johansson?\n\n\nSherman:\n I've never known much about the guy. He transferred over from some other unit a while back, and the records say our whole unit got amnesticized to save us from SCP-2559 - course, I wouldn't remember the specifics - so he isn't so close to the rest of the team.\n\n\nNguyen:\n Do you have any idea why he's immune?\n\n\n(\nSherman shrugs.\n)\n\n\nSherman:\n No clue. I know we definitely coughed on him, and at any rate, we got to the guys in administration after we sabotaged the air vents, so I have no idea how he's fine.\n\n\n(\nNguyen closes his notes.\n)\n\n\nNguyen:\n Alright, that's it for today.

    "description": "SCP-5880 is an anomalous, highly contagious strain of Influenza B contracted through either physical or memetic infection. Initial infection of SCP-5880 progresses similarly to other, non-anomalous infections. Common symptoms include coughing, congestion, upper respiratory irritation, head/body ache, fever, and fatigue. Due to the anomalous effects of SCP-5880, infected individuals are significantly less likely to receive medical assistance, and thus more likely to suffer complications. The current fatality rate is approximately 32%.",
