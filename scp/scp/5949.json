SCP-5949 specimens are cuboid organisms averaging three meters in height and frontal width. Juvenile members of the species are typically six meters in length, with the largest known adult specimen reaching twice that. A diverse array of patterns and colorations is present across the species.\n\n\nSpecimens are believed to be asexual, and reproductive habits of any kind have yet to be observed. Internal organs are akin to those found in crabs and lobsters, albeit relative to the large size of an SCP-5949 instance. The outer shell of SCP-5949 is similarly crustacean in makeup, though with a texture and integrity similar to that of steel.\n\n\nSCP-5949 is one of several recently\n1\n-observed species displaying what the Foundation recognises as \u201cbio-adjacent\u201d evolutionary characteristics; a natural ability to blend in with and exploit human-made infrastructure, most notably systems which operate on a scale analogous to ecological biospheres.\n2\n\n\nDespite lacking limbs or appendages to facilitate motion\n3\n, SCP-5949 relies on symbiosis with the workings of international logistics to maintain a nomadic lifestyle. Uncontained specimens experience a state of perpetual, global migration.\n\n\nAt present, the worldwide population of SCP-5949 is estimated to be between four and seven thousand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6ACCESS Project SEVENSEAS Quarterly Report - March 2021\u25c0\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021/03/03\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 we\u2019re all very embarrassed about the \nunder\nestimation. \u201cWhere are they all coming from?\u201d Well, I mean, we\u2019re talking creatures here which are rather like crustaceans in terms of how they\u2019re\u2026 constituted. The geometric cousins of crustaceans that we\u2019ve had to purchase god knows how many cranes to lift. So, to answer your query, probably the sea. Just a hunch, as a marine biologist.\n\n\nBut about those numbers\u2026 yeah, ouch. We didn\u2019t half muck that up. Just add about three more noughts to the initial prediction and you should have closer to a realistic figure. What we\u2019re looking at here is possibly the most prolific spread of anomalous fauna since Foundation records began.\n\n\nWe\u2019re running a thousand acres of provisional facility here and we\u2019re almost at full capacity. There\u2019s a few hundred new specimens coming in tomorrow, and that\u2019ll pretty much have to be it. I\u2019ve been in contact with my Dutch counterparts and they might just be able to co-opt a few square miles near Rotterdam by next week. That should cover European containment for another month or two, but then we\u2019ll have to start considering our other options again. All credit where it\u2019s due, the International cooperation has been fantastic so far. The facility the Saudi Arabian branch managed to acquire has been a huge help - though, again, space is getting pretty tight. I can attest the same for China, Japan, Australia\u2026 we're investigating a few potential sightings at an Antarctic research station, and if that's the case then they'll have made it to all seven continents. At least it's easier to hide a mass-containment facility there, I suppose.\n\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering, though \u2013 about all this money, all these spontaneous large-scale infrastructure projects. Long-term, we might have to just do the unthinkable and start nipping this species in the bud. Ostensibly, sure, it\u2019s a harmless anomaly with a natural propensity to\u2026 not particularly mess with the Veil. But in the long run, if they keep popping up out of who-knows-where, resources might start to really get stretched.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even broaching the fact that this kind of evolutionary pattern might become all the more common. This is nature on global commercialism \u2013 think of it along the lines of oneiroi, or a sapient entity borne out of nothing but cyberspace.\n\n\nTo be honest, that\u2019s pretty much it for this quarter. I\u2019ll send over a few shots of the Arabian facility, in case you haven't seen it already.\n\n\nDr. Nick Iqbal, Provisional Site-45B\n\nFelixstowe, United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6VIEW\u00a0Image_1.jpg\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaunal containment facility operated by the Foundation's Saudi Arabia branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6VIEW\u00a0Image_2.jpg\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical adult SCP-5949 specimen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
