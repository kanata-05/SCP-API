Please inform me if you will need additional resources for this project.\n\n\nI advise that you reach out to the IT staff assigned to this incident [\nclaude.harris@site53.scp.org\n].

I hoped that I would get to see you a lot more.\n\n\n\n\nYou\n - Hi, I'm glad you made it. I'm still getting dinner together right now if you want to come and help me.\n\n\nMe\n - Hey, for sure. What do you want me to do?\n\n\nYou\n - These vegetables are all chopped now. Can you add those to the stirfry and finish that up?\n\n\nMe\n - I think I can do that.\n\n\n[I was terrified of being in that kitchen with you.]\n\n\nYou\n - You can get a drink too if you want.\n\n\nMe\n - I know I can do that.\n\n\n[I made a cocktail with whatever was closest. As soon as someone said the word \"shots\" two of those went down too.]\n\n\nYou\n - Dinner is all ready guys!\n\n\n[Everyone sat down and ate. I was feeling better now. We were both laughing and stealing glances at one another.

We talked for hours about everything. Your friends kept popping their heads in to make sure that everything was going okay and that your plan had worked.]\n\n\nMe\n - I have to get going, even though I really don't want to.\n\n\nYou\n - I know.\n\n\nMe\n - Do you want to go on an actual date this weekend?\n\n\nYou\n - Yes.\n\n\nMe\n - I'll send you the address of a place I like nearby.

You got mac and cheese and I got a burger.\n\n\nHours went by. You told me your secrets. I shared my fears.\n\n\nWhen we walked outside. I took your hand because I didn't want you to fall on the ice.

These items are denoted as SCP-7826-A#.\n\n\nTo date, all objects that have been recovered from SCP-7826 have been determined to be safe and as such can are stored according to minimal security protocols.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSCP-7826 occupies an unknown area of space near Site-53 that allows objects from one dimension to be transcribed into our own. Items originating from SCP-7826 possess unique levels of entropic energy allowing them to be distinguished from our reality. Each of these items have appeared within a 10 sq km area surrounding Site-53.\n\n\nGiven that each recovered item is congruous with what one would expect its superficial appearance to be, it is difficult to determine the quantity of objects that have been dispensed by SCP-7826 or how long the anomaly has been active.\n\n\nAn array of atmospheric sensors have been placed in the area around Site-53 which have been able to detect the appearance of new objects. New objects will be proceeded by minute atmospheric disruptions which are localized to the area where the object manifests.\n\n\nThe anomaly's exact location has yet to be found. However, new objects have tended to appear in the area directly north of Site-53.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7826.1: SCP-7826-A Findings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe following is a selection of items recovered that have been determined to have originated from SCP-7826.
