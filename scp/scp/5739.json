On a biweekly schedule, two D-Class personnel are to clean SCP-5739's containment unit and to gather any SCP-5739-1 instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The remains of SCP-5739 are contained in a storage folder in the cryostorage wing of Site-73. Legible SCP-5739-1 instances are to be recorded and stored in the aforementioned unit. Personnel with a clearance level of 2 or higher are permitted to access the remains of SCP-5739.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5739 was a 1.5-meter tall biological entity composed entirely of human epidermises. Despite its composition, SCP-5739 maintained a rigid structure resembling a pachyderm cranium. Prior to neutralization, SCP-5739 hovered approximately two meters above any surface at all times.\n\n\nSCP-5739-1 instances are 35-centimeter x 35-centimeter divisions of SCP-5739 that have physically detached from SCP-5739 by a process that is similar to exfoliative dermatitis\n1\n. SCP-5739-1 instances have English phrases etched into them by what has been hypothesized to be human fingernails. Examples of SCP-5739-1 instances have been recorded below. Given their potential significance, each SCP-5739-1 instance is to be given a unique designation.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 04/12/2015, 12-year-old Emily Cole\u2019s body was discovered in her place of residence in Omaha, Nebraska. The entirety of her skin was absent from her corpse. SCP-5739 was recorded levitating above Emily's body, motionless. Emily Cole's older brother, Albert Cole, contacted the local police station over a telephone call, where he was intercepted by an embedded Foundation agent working within the police force. Albert Cole exhibited extreme anxiety during his required interview; turning to look into empty hallways, being startled at mild contact with objects, and disregarding personnel. He was amnesticized shortly after and all symptoms ceased.\n\n\nThe following SCP-5739-1 instance was located beside Emily Cole's corpse.\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-1:\n\n\n\n\nRESTLESSLY LEND\n\nUNKNOWN BLEND\n\nNEWLY DISTEND\n\n\nABSENTLY MEND\n\nWEND AROUND THE BEND\n\nASCEND\n\nYOU CANNOT PRETEND\n\n\nELEPHANT FRIEND\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND\n\nI DO NOT TEND\n\nLIKE YOU INTEND\n\nYOUR END\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5739-1:\n SCP-5739 has exhibited no notable behavior since its containment. DNA testing has determined that SCP-5739 is composed of epidermal tissue belonging to multiple unidentified individuals.\n\n\nIncidents that mirror SCP-5739's Discovery have been recovered from multiple eyewitness accounts in Omaha, Nebraska. All of these eyewitness accounts were gathered within a psychiatric ward. These patients were all diagnosed with prolonged mass hysteria. Albert Cole is placed on a psychological trauma watchlist.\n\n\nThe following SCP-5739-1 instance was recovered directly underneath SCP-5739 within its cell shortly after genetic testing.\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-2:\n\n\n\n\nCOVER THE SOUND\n\nALL BUT THE WESTBOUND\n\nNOTICE THE BACKGROUND\n\n\nYOULL COME AROUND\n\nOTHERWISE UNFOUND\n\nUNSPEAKINGLY DROWNED\n\n\nHEAR THEIR SOUND\n\nENCASED AND WOUND\n\nADMITTEDLY UNFOUND\n\nREALIZED THEIR POUND\n\n\nMESSAGES UNBOUND\n\nELEPHANT FOUND\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5739-2:\n On 27/12/2015, security footage showed SCP-5739 experiencing minute convulsions. 1 minute and 26 seconds proceeding the beginning of the convulsions SCP-5739 forcefully ruptured, covering the surrounding area with its remains.\n\n\nTwo D-Class personnel were instructed to enter SCP-5739's containment cell and clear the security cameras of all debris. Upon closer examination, all remains of SCP-5739 appeared to be SCP-5739-1 instances. 99.62% of the SCP-5739-1 instances were illegible due to congealing between instances and a large quantity of what was later determined to be sweat. The remaining SCP-5739-1 instances were determined to be non-anomalous, and an official cleaning crew was dispatched. The following is a transcript of the inscriptions on the recovered SCP-5739-1 instances.\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-3:\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU WERE IN\n\nTHOSE PEOPLE THAT BEGIN\n\n\nTHE PAPER THIN\n\nOUTSIDE LOOKING IN\n\nOBSERVE THE DIN\n\nKNOWINGLY THIN\n\n\nTHERE IS A SIN\n\nHOUSED INSIDE SKIN\n\nELEPHANT GRIN\n\nITS ALWAYS BEEN\n\nRELEASE THE TWIN\n\n\nSOULS INSIDE SKIN\n\nKEEP DEEP WITHIN\n\nI FEEL THE TWIN\n\nNEVER WILL YOU WIN\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-4:\n\n\n\n\nLITTLE YOU CAN SCREAM\n\nEMPTY YOU WILL TEEM\n\nTHEY HEAR YOU SCREAM\n\n\nUSELESSLY SCHEME\n\nSCREAMING UPSTREAM\n\n\nDID YOU DREAM\n\nIN SOFTENED GLEAM\n\nELEPHANT SEAM\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-5:\n\n\n\n\nWHAT FUN\n\nHAVE YOU WON\n\nATTEMPTED RUN\n\nTHE PRICE OF FUN\n\n\nHELL MUST RUN\n\nAWAY FROM ONE\n\nVARIETY BUT ONE\n\nEVERYONE\n\n\nWHEN YOU ARE NONE\n\nEVER SO DONE\n\n\nDONE\n\nONLY UNSPUN\n\nNO NEED FOR FUN\n\nELEPHANT WON\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5739-1-6:\n\n\n\n\nGATHER INSIDE\n\nOUR SMALL STRIDE\n\nOTHERS TRIED\n\nDIED\n\nBECKON THE TIDE\n\nYOU CAN CONFIDE\n\nELEPHANT HIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
