On arrival, the entity proceeded to the common area of the facility. Surveillance equipment recorded SCP-6482 as it walked behind Josef Weiss, a senior resident, who appeared to be asleep in his wheelchair. SCP-6482 touched Weiss on the shoulder, waking him.

Dad had heart disease for a while, it was just his time.\n\n\nDr. Young:\n Do you have any idea why it targeted your father?\n\n\nWeiss-Thompson:\n I think so. Dad and Dan always horsed around, even in their old age they acted like two of the Stooges around each other. Every so often they'd get into this game of tag, Dad told me it was something that started when they were teenagers. Dan was 'it' when he passed.\n\n\nWeiss-Thompson pulls a handkerchief out of her pocket and wipes tears off her face.\n\n\nWeiss-Thompson:\n The old bugger never could stand to lose.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6481\n | SCP-6482 | \nSCP-6483\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6482\n\" by MirageTD, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
