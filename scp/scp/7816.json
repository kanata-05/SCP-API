In order to maximize the effectiveness of SCP-7816, Bl\u00e5hajar are to be distributed to every major Foundation site across the globe for personnel and anomalies alike.\n1\n\n\nResearch into harnessing the abnormal properties of SCP-7816 are presently ongoing.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7816 denotes an anomalous phenomenon involving Bl\u00e5haj, a 100-centimeter long stuffed toy resembling a blue shark manufactured by the Swedish conglomerate known as IKEA. While physically Bl\u00e5hajar lacks any notable oddities, they have displayed the unusual ability to heighten levels of dopamine and serotonin in subjects when within their vicinity. These properties intensify when making contact with the object.\n\n\nBecause of SCP-7816, persons have reported feeling \n\"safe and secure\"\n after being exposed to Bl\u00e5hajar for extended periods of time, lowering stress and increasing compliance. These effects have shown to persist even with the absence of Bl\u00e5hajar for multiple days or weeks at most. Although, it should be noted that representatives of IKEA possess no information behind the abnormal makeup of SCP-7816, with their methods of processing Bl\u00e5hajar being purely conventional. Investigation has thus far failed to determine a cause for SCP-7816.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7816.1:\n Excerpt\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt of the Bl\u00e5haj Committee's orientation, conducted by Director David Reindeer on the 19\nth\n of December 2023.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector Reindeer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, this isn't a joke. This isn't some late April Fool's Day prank or the result of some memetic anomaly or the plans of some rogue GoI. Whatever assumption you have about this\u2026 admittedly hyper specific department, you can throw them out.\n\n\nWe as the Foundation have progressed substantially over the past few decades as our knowledge of the abnormal spectrum has only increased and our feats grow more and more grand. This includes our methods of containment, our ways of handling the anomalies under our wing. We are constantly experimenting and adapting to the changing environment, constantly innovating and improving in order to keep the Veil under control and to keep the civilians blissfully unaware.\n\n\nThis leads to now with the formation of the Bl\u00e5haj Committee. Again, it may seem like I'm bluffing, but we truly did break the mold with this recent discovery.\n\n\nSome months ago, there was a containment breach which occurred at this very site, back when I was only a researcher. A rabid creature, extremely hostile, had a vague resemblance to a canine if it grew ten times its size. I was evacuating like everyone else before it spotted me and started hunting me down. I ended up barricading myself in my own office as it broke down the entrance. At that point, I was ready to go.\n\n\nThen, believe it or not, this Bl\u00e5haj, this shark plushie I had on the couch, caught the attention of it. It approached me before turning and noticing the Bl\u00e5haj. Next thing I know, I see this creature picking up the toy in its mouth before setting it down and circling it. This creature took in its scent, sat down, and went into a slumber. Even after the breach was concluded, there was little to no complications when escorting the anomaly back to its cell, still holding the plushie in its mouth.\n\n\nIt's been dormant ever since, like it never hurt a fly before.\n\n\nNow, some would simply give the designation to that specific Bl\u00e5haj or append it to that creature's file, but I wanted to be sure. It took a bit of convincing, but I eventually got the chance to test out whether it was really an isolated incident. I think we all know how that went, considering where I'm standing now.\n\n\nBut yes, as odd as this is, the Bl\u00e5haj Committee will be the future of containment. These shark toys will usher in a more peaceful environment, one where people's lives won't be at risk and anomalies can be kept under control. You're gonna be seeing these guys a lot in the coming weeks. Might as well get used to it.\n\n\nYou'd be surprised at how the best of solutions can be the simplest\u2014or the weirdest.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7816.2:\n Experiment Logs\n\n\n\n\nBelow are various cross-experiments conducted with the effects of SCP-7816 being the main focus. More tests can be accessed via the SCiPnet database.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-096\n\n\nEffect:\n Bl\u00e5haj is dropped off in the anomaly's cell. After a brief moment, it notices the plushie and proceeds to approach and take it into its arms. The entity cradles the Bl\u00e5haj as signs of emotional distress begin to waver. Subsequent visits to its containment chamber now consist of the anomaly covering its face with the shark toy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-049\n\n\nEffect:\n The anomaly initially expresses confusion when the Bl\u00e5haj is delivered to its cell, closely inspecting the plushie and temporarily dissecting it. Entity concludes by stitching the Bl\u00e5haj and setting it aside.\n\n\nLevels of aggression are noted to decrease as the anomaly spends extended periods of time holding the toy at arm's length and staring at it in silence. This has become part of its daily routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-939 instance\n\n\nEffect:\n A D-Class personnel (D-1211) is sent in to provide the Bl\u00e5haj. The instance goes in to attack them before ceasing movement when met with the plushie. D-1211 puts the Bl\u00e5haj down and backs away as the specimen nudges the shark toy with its snout.\n\n\nIt lets out sounds similar to that of a human child while interacting with the Bl\u00e5haj. Eventually, D-1211 is instructed to play catch with the anomaly using the plushie, which they perform successfully. Similar results have occurred with other instances as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-682\n\n\nEffect:\n Ineffective; Bl\u00e5haj is destroyed by anomaly upon delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly:\n SCP-173\n\n\nEffect:\n Bl\u00e5haj is introduced in its cell. No activity is noted for the first ten minutes. However, before retrieving the plushie, the cell's lights suddenly flicker as the plushie is seen stuck to the anomaly's forehead area without warning despite a lack of adhesive. Efforts to separate both entities have failed.\n\n\nAfterward, the specimen has ceased all movement while the Bl\u00e5haj frequently shifts to other parts of its figure when not observed.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7816.3:\n Project SHOREFRONT\n\n\n\n\nProject SHOREFRONT was devised following the designation of SCP-7816. It entails the distribution of Bl\u00e5hajar across major facilities worldwide containing hostile anomalies of object class Euclid and above, utilizing its effects to alleviate any aggressive behavior and revert them to a more obedient state. At least one Bl\u00e5haj will be included in each area of every site in order to ensure its potency.\n\n\nIn addition to this, Bl\u00e5hajar will be provided to members of staff to lower stress levels and increase productivity in a working environment. A dedicated storage unit is planned to be integrated in each facility should personnel wish to acquire more Bl\u00e5hajar for any appropriate reason.\n\n\nTo ease the dissemination process, the Bl\u00e5haj Committee was formed to combat related issues. Although, it should be noted that the department is assigned an additional purpose: to mass produce and promote Bl\u00e5hajar on a more global level, with the express goal of coercing civilians into purchasing Bl\u00e5hajar. This is to ensure SCP-7816's properties are spread on a wider scale in order to constantly expose escaped threats to its effects and quickly subdue them.\n\n\nAs of writing, SCP-7816 has helped in minimizing containment breaches and difficulties by ~92%.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nRadix:\n Item has been integrated into the Foundation's command structure.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwinkwonkboi's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-2689\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6039\n \n(+74)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6545\n \n(+78)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8245\n \n(+81)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7156\n \n(+21)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7199\n \n(+46)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7245\n \n(+54)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5358\n \n(+55)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5245\n \n(+51)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8386\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7488\n \n(+47)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7735\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6245\n \n(+65)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6306\n \n(+57)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6714\n \n(+104)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodnight, Sweet Dreams\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Kirby's Case, Part I: An Antithesis\n \n(+11)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwater diet\n \n(+27)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething's Burning\n \n(+40)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Care, Dear\n \n(+14)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nman overboard!\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Jones Marcel Should Be Employee of the Century\n \n(+11)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoses And Thorns\n \n(+18)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sinking Feeling\n \n(+26)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomalous Entity Engagement Division Orientation\n \n(+54)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Taste For Sore Eyes\n \n(+12)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nur typical unrequited love\n \n(+33)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to feel something.\n \n(+32)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritter Profile: Miss Cassandra!\n \n(+40)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#WettleAppreciationPost\n \n(+140)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nCertified Criminal\n \n(+36)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7K DOODLES\n \n(+72)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRACKHEAD: SCP-173 Fanart\n \n(+31)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENLIGHTENMENT: SCP-6059 Fanart\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfroot froggo :)\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICED: SCP-7345 Fanart\n \n(+19)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfart exchange gift for jim (7384 fanart)\n \n(+25)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfading stars doodles (straight from my phone's sketchbook app)\n \n(+37)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing CalcaRuler: Halloween Emperor\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDITTO: SCP-#### Fanart\n \n(+42)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTWITNESS: SCP-5843 Fanart\n \n(+30)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFISHER: SCP-2689 Fanart\n \n(+24)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\na lack of care.\n \n(+28)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELTHY: SCP-6780 Fanart\n \n(+29)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCiPTEMBER DOODLES\n \n(+23)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7815\n | SCP-7816 | \nSCP-7817\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7816\n\" by winkwonkboi, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

At least one Bl\u00e5haj will be included in each area of every site in order to ensure its potency.\nIn addition to this, Bl\u00e5hajar will be provided to members of staff to lower stress levels and increase productivity in a working environment. A dedicated storage unit is planned to be integrated in each facility should personnel wish to acquire more Bl\u00e5hajar for any appropriate reason.\nTo ease the dissemination process, the Bl\u00e5haj Committee was formed to combat related issues. Although, it should be noted that the department is assigned an additional purpose: to mass produce and promote Bl\u00e5hajar on a more global level, with the express goal of coercing civilians into purchasing Bl\u00e5hajar. This is to ensure SCP-7816's properties are spread on a wider scale in order to constantly expose escaped threats to its effects and quickly subdue them.\nAs of writing, SCP-7816 has helped in minimizing containment breaches and difficulties by ~92%.\n\n"

While physically Bl\u00e5hajar lacks any notable oddities, they have displayed the unusual ability to heighten levels of dopamine and serotonin in subjects when within their vicinity. These properties intensify when making contact with the object.",
