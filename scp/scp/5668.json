Little to no anomalous traits have been detected in photographic depictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5668 is to be contained in a standard document containment locker. Nearby personnel experiencing scopaesthesia\n1\n are to be relocated immediately.\n\n\nInformation regarding the whereabouts to a copy of the film \nThe Angels Look at Us\n is currently under investigation. Following the events of Addendum 5668-3, extensive care is to be taken when interacting with copies of the film to avoid further loss of life.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5668 is the only known poster for a 1924 silent horror film entitled \nThe Angels Look at Us\n. No copies of this film are known to exist. Subjects near SCP-5668 for extended periods of time will begin to experience short-term scopaesthesia, which will dissipate over the next couple hours.\n\n\nLong-term direct visual contact with SCP-5668 generates more potent mental delusions, taking the form of visual hallucinations. These hallucinations revolve around the appearance of entities within the storefronts on SCP-5668's artwork, which will then exit these storefronts eventually walking out of SCP-5668 in its entirety.\n\n\nIndividuals perceiving these entities universally describe them as \"angels\", with a vague and mostly ineffable physical appearance, surrounded by intense multicolored light emanations. Despite the indescribable appearance of their eyes alongside the rest of their features, subjects also believe these entities are constantly staring at them.\n\n\nThe entities are non-hostile, instead opting to noninvasively observe the subject, moving away if any physical interaction is attempted. After a varying amount of time away from SCP-5668, these entities will leave through the head of the subject. All exact descriptions of this process lack any further nuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLon Chaney, circa 1923.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5668-1 \u2014 History:\n \nThe Angels Look at Us\n is believed to have screened only once to an audience of 42 people in Blue Springs, Michigan. Few witness reports remain, with a majority of witnesses either being deceased or forgetting the film in its entirety when contacted, even if it was confirmed they were present at the screening. Accounts of crew and cast members confirmed to be involved in the film's production share similar scarceness.\n\n\nDespite overwhelming critical acclaim resulting from this screening, the film was never shown again. The only public reason given by the writer, director, and film star Lon Chaney being \"a terrible mistake, which more effort should have been made to rectify.\"\n\n\nDespite intense investigation to locate a copy of \nThe Angels Look at Us\n, by both independent and Foundation efforts, no existing copies could be found. The last copy of \nThe Angels Look at Us\n was believed to have been destroyed during a fire in a storage facility owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, alongside the last copies of several other films. Despite this fire being ruled to have been caused by the ignition of old nitrate-based film, further investigation revealed suppressed evidence of arson.\n\n\nSeveral incomplete summaries of the film have been found to exist, with the two most cohesive summaries being found below, both from now deceased authors:\n\n\n\n\nFound brief plot synopsis, inside a collection of upcoming movie advertisements in a 1924 issue of the Blue Springs, Missouri newspaper \nThe Examiner\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nLon Chaney stars in his newest film\n The Angels Look at Us\n, about a mad woman who thinks angels stare at her no matter where she goes. Her psychologist, played by Lon Chaney, must quench the delusions before she is declared insane, with little success.\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFound review for the film, inside a heavily damaged 1924 \nBoy's Cinema\n issue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Angels Look at Us \nstarring Lon Chaney as the psychologist 'D. B. Boures', and Marceline Day as 'Diane Schultzen', is a gripping fright fest that nearly pulls the viewer into the experience itself. The tale follows a psychologist and his patient Diane, whom is stricken with visions of strange 'angels' watching her. The looks put on for these angels in film, as we see them through the eyes of Diane, are positively stunning, as if\n\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\n\nShe begins viewing others in the same light, and grows unable to trust even her own husband.

It was a true spectacle to behold and truly a marveling show.\n\"\n\n\n\n\nDue to the lack of information available, the reasoning for SCP-5668's effects cannot be faithfully determined.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5668-2 \u2014 Independent Investigations:\n On 2020/04/1, a forum thread on GoI-1109 (\"Parawatch Wiki\") was started as a uniform place for discussion on locating further information on \nThe Angels Look at Us\n, along with any existing copies. While most evidence brought forth was proven to be false and therefore did not constitute a security breach, several posts by a user under the alias \"monsterkill00\" held credibility, a transcript of such posts can be found below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonsterkill00\n 1/25/2020 (Thu) 8:50:51 #92967342\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMG_2405\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! Glad I came across this.\n\n\nMy grandfather was a cameraman for a lot of early silent films, bouncing back and forth from little projects, was the only thing he'd ever talk about. He was a big friend of Lon Chaney (pic related, my grandpa's in the middle, Chaney's to the right in some movie getup), he'd talk with him about a lot, worked on a couple projects he starred in or directed for every once and awhile.\n\n\nHe didn't work on \nAngels Look at Us\n, unfortunately. But he did work on a different film with Lon right after. Exact details are a bit fuzzy, the stories he told about it changed a bit between tellings. His Alzheimer's really made him screwy with those details, he was a nice man. Always happy to talk about what little he remembered, I think it helped him too, recalling all that. Before those fucking nursing home bastards found him choked to death on his own spit.\n\n\nSorry, here's \nusually\n what I was told:\n\n\nGrandpa came to the set, as usual. He talked to Lon, that man was always so excited for these movies. This time though, he didn't seem so hot. Kinda down, cold, you know \u2014 grandpa always said it was \"like he'd seen a damn puppy get shot before he came on set\". So he asked what was wrong, tried to get anything outta him, wouldn't budge at first. Grandpa tried to change the topic, cause it was awkward as hell after, asked him how'd the last film go. That only got Chaney \nmore\n upset, he pulled grandpa aside, tugged him into a makeup room.\n\n\nChaney told him\u2026 something. This is the part he always jumbled up each time. Chaney had a dream, that was constant, he was walking down the street, then fell down an open manhole. walked through a place, a mansion, a film set, a bar \u2014 whatever grandpa was in the mood to say \u2014 until he found a lone film projector. He walked \"into\" the projector (believe me, idk what the hell he meant by that either) and found something that shocked him. Yeah it's a bit underwhelming ik \u2014 it was underwhelming whenever grandpa told the story too \u2014 but that's all he'd ever say. He said it was a \"secret\" a few times, but I could tell the old man didn't remember what the hell it was.\n\n\nAnyway, that dream was some muse for Chaney, he came up with \nThe Angels Look at Us\n shortly after. He had two versions: the rough cut and the one that got shown. Something about the film let him down still, and he never wanted it seen again. \"Lucky to be alive,\" that's what grandpa said he'd said \u2014 that also stayed same-y between tellings. Chaney told him he was hiding those versions away somewhere nobody'd watch, \"keep them somewhere safe.\" That was basically where he'd end it off, he'd go all mumbly after that and didn't make much sense.\n\n\nI hope I'm not giving out info that's already known lmao, this thread is 26 pages long, I ain't reading through all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCHEESEMEISTER\n 1/25/2020 (Thu) 9:00:51 #92967356\n\n\n\n\nLOL man nobody gonna believe your dead crazy dementia grandpa story, espcaliclally not me\n\n\nwe already got like five of these in this thread, and if he can;t even swallow his own spit than he's probably not that good a source\n\n\nget some real evidence or gtfo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nmonsterkill00\n 1/25/2020 (Thu) 9:02:30 #92967360\n\n\n\n\nHey man fuck you. If you want something real i'll find something just for you. i still got a lot of my grandpa's shit in my attic i haven't gone through, give me a second Mr \"\nCHEESEMEISTER\n\", o grand protector of the truth on a conspiracy wiki board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCHEESEMEISTER\n 1/25/2020 (Thu) 9:03:46 #92967365\n\n\n\n\nlocal man named monster kill zero zero makes fun of my username, more at 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nmonsterkill00\n 1/25/2020 (Thu) 9:15:32 #92967389\n\n\n\n\nHOLY SHIT found a film reel \"angels look at us original keep it safe\" there has to be a projecjtor up here OEN SEOCND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese posts were acknowledged by Foundation plants in the Parawatch Wiki moderation team, who later determined \"monsterkill00\" was 36 year old Johnathan Quensboro, whose grandfather, Marvin Quensboro, worked on many films during the 1920's and 1930's, with other details matching with external sources.\n\n\nAddendum 5668-3 \u2014 Foundation Investigations:\n The information gathered from Addendum 5668-2 was deemed enough to warrant Foundation investigation of Quensboro, and Agents Gurrano and Langsly were sent to his residence in Carlton, Missouri.

For the last time, \nGas workers.\n\n\nGurrano:\n \nJeez\n man, making sure. Should we just\u2026 go in?\n\n\nLangsly:\n Why the hell not?\n\n\nGurrano:\n Uhh, protocol?\n\n\nLangsly:\n We have weapons, dude's some 30-something conspiracy nerd.\n\n\n(\nLangsly enter Quensboro's house and Gurrano follows, they enter the kitchen. Down the hall to the right, a film projector is heard whirring in the farthest room, the door is closed. Langsly begins surveying the house.\n)\n\n\nGurrano:\n Johnathan Quensboro? Anyone here?\n\n\n(\nGurrano walks down the hall, lights emanate from behind the door. The projector continues whirring.\n)\n\n\nLangsly:\n Rest of the place is as clear as glass.\n\n\nGurrano:\n That seems to be where stuff's going down.\n\n\nLangsly:\n Well what're we waiting for then? Ehh? An invitation?\n\n\nGurrano:\n Wait, shouldn't we\u2014\n\n\n(\nLangsly turns the handle. As they do, the light underneath the door dissipates. The film projector continues whirring. Langsly opens the door and enters. Their camera feed disconnects, their audio feed remaining intact.
