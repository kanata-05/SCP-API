The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff.\n\n\nDue to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.\n\n\nDespite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.\n\n\nAddendum 194.C (Description):\n SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody.\n\n\nNotably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a0194.D:\u00a0CCTV\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of CCTV Recording 139-DC-732, taken 04/23/2019, in Site-139. No relevant video was recorded; only audio.\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: Hey.\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: Oh. Hey.\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: So, um, on Tuesday\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: Something came up.\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: Well, okay, would you like to\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: You know, I'm\u2026I'm really busy these days, it makes it kinda tough to\u2026you know. Be social.\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: Uh-huh.\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: So like, I appreciate it. Like\u2026I appreciate you\u2026my \ncoworker\n, wanting to socialize with me, as \ncoworkers\n, outside of work, but sometimes it's just not\u2026going to happen. You get that, right?\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: Well I mean\u2026I guess I thought\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: \n(Deep sigh)\n We are coworkers, Garth. I was under the impression this was going to be a friendly after-work chit-chat. And your texts\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 1: Oh, I was just\u2026playing around, ya know, it\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: No, it's not really\u2014\n\n\nSUBJECT 3: Excuse me, Laura, do you have a second?\n\n\nSUBJECT 2: Yeah. \n(footsteps)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 194.E: Testing Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-193\n | SCP-194 | \nSCP-195\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-194\n\" by Calibold and CityToast, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
