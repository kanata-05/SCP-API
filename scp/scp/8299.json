This legend has been intentionally disseminated among local descendants of settler-colonists and does not target regional indigenous populations. It has proven 80% effective over past initiatives at reducing the risk that civilians will encounter SCP-8299.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRETRACT\u00a0MODULE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Data\n\n\n\n\nThe average adult member of the SCP-8299 subspecies measures 3.9\u20134.8 metres in length and weighs 550\u20131\u00a0000\u00a0kg. It is most morphologically similar to the Florida manatee, albeit with a thick layer of blubber and higher metabolic rate to weather the colder seasonal temperatures. Physiological deviations from its Florida cousin occur within the forward part of its body and face. \nEach member bears flippers with distinct digits, opposable thumbs, and fine motor control, and an enlarged, flattened cranium.\n\n\nFor insight into the SONG OF SORROW Event, consult the Addenda Materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8299\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8299 instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8299 is an anomalous subspecies of manatee taxonified as the True Northern manatee (\nT. m. semperiam\n). SCP-8299 live throughout the James Bay region of the northernmost part of Ontario, Canada. Most members of its subspecies populate the brackish waters surrounding Akimiski Island, Nunavut, placing the extent of the subspecies\u2019 habitat at longitudes much further north than all other extant manatee.\n.\nRoughly 1500\u00a0km further northward than the range of its closest counterpart, the Florida manatee (\nT. m. latirostris\n).\n\n\nSCP-8299 are demonstrably sapient. Most SCP-8299 exhibit passive fluency in one or more human languages (in descending frequency: dialectal Cree, English, French, Ojibwe, and Inuktitut) but are not verbally conversant. Rather, SCP-8299 communicate via an anomalous form of echolocation akin to telepathy. A minority population within the Akimiski group can freely understand higher-level human concepts, express them with clarity, and commit them to long-term memory. Coinciding with its open containment by The Foundation, however, the average intelligence of the collective populations has seen a steady increase; the number of capables has also progressively increased and become a larger proportion of the whole.\n\n\nAdult SCP-8299 instances perform vocalizations similar to whalesong. These vocalizations are most present during the SCP-8299 mating season, which occurs between March and mid-May.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-8299 manifest in the physiological and psychological effects their songs have on their local ecology. Humans who are exposed to SCP-8299 songs report feelings of elation alongside increased speed and soundness of decision-making. Depressive humans specifically have reported a clarity of thought, greater motivation to complete tasks, and greater degrees of socialization. Humans who take a hostile disposition towards SCP-8299 \u2014 such as hunters, who pursue SCP-8299 for their fat and hides \u2014 are afforded headaches, migraines, nausea, vertigo, dyspepsia, and general malaise.\n\n\nSCP-8299 exist in harmony with their marine environment; their song has marked positive effects on the surrounding waters and shoreline. The long-term presence of SCP-8299 in James Bay after completing their migration has cleansed pollutants in the bay on the whole, creating and sustaining conditions that result in water clarity. Their skin absorbs contaminants that come into contact with their pelage. SCP-8299 have a symbiotic relationship with lakebed kelp in particular, promoting the growth of kelp forests in an ecology that otherwise lacks in the plant. Marine wildlife populations experience less negative health outcomes than their terrestrial neighbours, and live longer on average.\n\n\nMarine biologists believe the climactic and marine conditions of James Bay should be inhospitable to manatee. Local populations of settler-colonial descent claim no knowledge of \nT. m. semperiam\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDA MATERIALS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8299.I\n Phenomenological Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrival of SCP-8299 and Initial Interactions With First Nations Communities\n\n\n\n\nThe origin of SCP-8299 is still widely debated, but the following is considered most plausible.\n\n\nSCP-8299 is theorized to be closely related to \nSCP-327\n, a species of anomalous manatee capable of human speech. Because of infighting and the struggles of daily life, it is theorized that a select herd of manatee migrated north from the Gulf of Mexico circa 500 \nBCE\n. Although oceanic temperatures in the North Atlantic proved harsh to the subtropical manatee, most instances survived and reached the James Bay region. The local population ultimately settled here in part because of its relative isolation and rich habitat.\n\n\nFor generations, SCP-8299 and regional indigenous populations engaged in periodic interactions. A number of mutual traditions were observed, including various songs and dances.\n\n\nSCP-8299 had a thriving culture, reaching its peak population in 1470 \nCE\n before gradually decreasing. They commonly lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving around the region every few months so as to ensure an adequate supply of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an interview conducted and transcribed in 1932, shortly after The Foundation acquired control over the SCP-8299 project.\n.\nThe Shiravadakar method had not yet been developed.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTEXT LOG\n\n\n \n\n\n[ BEGIN LOG ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8299\n\n\nHm.

No further instances could be identified as layleaders during this period, and several other instances expressed refusal to communicate with Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department for the Study and Catalogue of Especially Quaint Furbearers (DSCEQF)\n\n\n\n\nA Canadian Foundation precursor and arm of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). The Department operated with nearly limitless reach for almost 200 years, until the British Crown negotiated the transference of Rupert's Land from the HBC to the Dominion of Canada in 1870.\n\n\nIts expansive catalogue and unique methods of restraining and trapping cryptid species were recovered by The Foundation sometime in the early 20th century. Most items in its catalogue were later recaptured and relocated to \nProvisional Site-43\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColonial Interactions With SCP-8299\n\n\n\n\nThe Department for the Study and Catalogue of Especially Quaint Furbearers (DSCEQF) made the first documented observations of SCP-8299 in 1827.\n\n\nTheir discovery was not the Department's first activity in the region. In the mid-1600s, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) came to establish one of its earliest fur trading posts in the region, further down the coast from Akimiski Island. This post, Fort Albany, had to be relocated multiple times as a result of conflict with the French.\n\n\nIn 1708, it was secretly relocated once again \u2014 this time, the DSCEQF moved in and used the new location as a fixture at the fringe of its operations. Its then-base of operations existed much further inland. This secret move provided the DSCEQF narrow escape from the Battle of Fort Albany, on 26 June 1709, at the premises of the fort's former location.\n\n\nDuring this time, the DSCEQF frequently hunted and exterminated the local wildlife population, leading to the extinction of many species, both mundane and anomalous. Concurrently, the British perpetrated the wide-scale suppression of First Nations cultures. The DSCEQF wiped out large SCP-8299 habitats and forced them to assimilate, further destroying the SCP-8299 population. Many members of SCP-8299 were forced into slavery in and around Department outposts.\n\n\nThe DSCEQF initially made use of SCP-8299 for their fur and bodily materials. The British government fully supported this move, and provided cover stories for decades. During this time, over 90% of the SCP-8299 population was wiped out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an interview from 1953, using the Gunnarsdotter method.

Unfair treatment and lack of adequate food prompted an underground group to form. This group, calling themselves the Peace Fighters, gradually gained members who launched protests. They advocated for an end to their slavery by any means necessary. Despite suppressive campaigns on the part of the DSCEQF, the Peace Fighters grew to encompass a large majority of the SCP-8299 population.\n\n\nThis reached a boiling point in early 1870 when a large revolt broke out, known as the Revolution of Fire. Large numbers of SCP-8299 instances defended themselves against human attackers. In several engagements, members of nearby First Nations communities aided SCP-8299 instances in destroying DSCEQF outposts. Eventually, the Revolution of Fire succeeded and the DSCEQF gradually retreated from the area. That same year, the British Crown negotiated the transfer of Rupert's Land from the HBC to the Dominion of Canada, and the DSCEQF disbanded.\n\n\nScores of humans and SCP-8299 instances were killed, the latter causing a sharp decrease in the already small SCP-8299 population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interview was conducted in 1975 by Dr. Rama. By this time, interactions with SCP-8299 were commonplace and tensions had lowered. However, there still remained some tensions when The Foundation discovered a Way\n.\n \nWAY\n An anomalous connection between two locations, enabling rapid travel regardless of distance.

These dialogues resulted in the loosening of Special Containment Procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern-Day Observations\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the dissolution of DSCEQF, SCP-8299 enjoyed relative freedom. However, they still suffered from sharp food shortages caused by overfishing in an unregulated fishing market. The population continued to plummet until an average of 50 instances remained year-round.\n\n\nIn 1930, 60 years after the initial revolt, The Foundation received a high volume of reports describing an ethereal-sounding song heard along the shoreline of the Hudson and James Bays. Occupants of shallow-water fishing vessels contributed the majority of reports. The Foundation discovered SCP-8299 during the summer of that year.\n\n\nAlthough interactions between The Foundation and SCP-8299 initially proved tense, both parties eventually settled on a secrecy agreement. Only minimal containment was observed thereafter. Foundation forces monitored the region for the next 70 years and exercised a non-disruptive relationship with SCP-8299.\n\n\nAs of 2000, only one living member of SCP-8299 remained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final interview conducted with SCP-8299 in which it asked to meet with Dr. Rama personally.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nANNOTATED AUDIO LOG\n\n\n \n\n\n[ BEGIN LOG ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8299\n\n\nGood evening, Dr. Rama.

It was characterized by sustained cries coming from SCP-8299 and could be heard in a radius spanning tens of kilometres. It originally took the form of a song developed during the slavery of SCP-8299, passing from generation to generation until the modern day. The song also featured lyrics, albeit rarely.\n\n\n\n\nVEILBURST Protocol was enacted on 26 April 2020; the Veil of Normality was forcibly dissolved. Immediately following this, reports in and around the Hudson Bay region characterized a widespread melody consistent with the SONG OF SORROW, despite SCP-8299 having been neutralized 20 years previously.\n\n\nThe event lasted for several minutes before gradually quieting. The Foundation, deeming the extranormal event a one-time occurrence, conducted no further investigation.\n\n\nBelow is a list of lyrics heard during the event.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOh, the work is hard but the sun is shining,\n\n\nOur bodies are pushed to exhaustion, many do not survive,\n\n\nDespite this, we keep singing,\n\n\n'Cause one day, our children will still be alive.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMaybe one day it'll all be okay,\n\n\nThat day,\n\n\nWe'll all celebrate the peaceful moon watching over us,\n\n\nWith nothing to fuss,\n\n\nBut we'll have to wait,\n\n\nAs our labour continues on.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIt's a beautiful day outside,\n\n\nYet we're denied,\n\n\nBut we'll carry on,\n\n\nOur culture will not be destroyed,\n\n\nAnd eventually, we will be overjoyed.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThere is hope, a light at the end of the tunnel,\n\n\nOne day, I hope man will see their mistakes,\n\n\nAnd learn, so there will be no more trouble,\n\n\nThen we won't have to hide in the lakes,\n\n\nWe'll be able to live quietly, peacefully, like we did.\n\n\nJust not yet, as we still have to live in fear.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBut for now, we'll persist,\n\n\nWe'll keep surviving,\n\n\nKeep living our lives,\n\n\nSo our story won't be forgotten.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsplay: no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset over Hudson Bay, 26 April 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8298\n | SCP-8299 | \nSCP-8300\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8299\n\" by Stealth000 & Lt Flops, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
