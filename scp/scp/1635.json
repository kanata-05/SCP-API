Active instances should be stored in standard humanoid containment chambers and treated as appropriate for their apparent age and condition with regard to feeding and medical care. Activation of SCP-1635 instances is only permitted in test scenarios; for testing approval, contact the Site Director of Testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1635 is a collection of five humanoid entities, individually designated SCP-1635-1 through -7 (SCP-1635-2 and -4 neutralised during testing). An SCP-1635 instance is indistinguishable from the corpse of a human who has just expired from cardiac arrest: body temperature remains at human average and rigor mortis is not in effect. Instances of SCP-1635 will remain in this state indefinitely unless activated by the procedure described below.\n\n\nSCP-1635 instances all possess a microchip measuring 14mm x 12mm attached to the spinal cord 10mm below the skin in the nape of the neck. It is attached to the spinal column by a series of microscopic gold wires, which extend into the spinal cord and upwards into large portions of the brain. Removal of this microchip has caused permanent neutralisation of anomalous effects, despite attempts to reinsert it. It is believed that this is due to the connections made between the chip and SCP-1635 neural matter being too fine to re-establish by current Foundation methods. Testing on samples of SCP-1635 neural matter has shown that 87% of neurons within the body contain statistically significant amounts of gold.\n\n\nIf a living human finger touches the area on the back of the neck of an SCP-1635 instance directly above the microchip, the instance will activate. No effect was observed in a microchip outside of an SCP-1635 instance, even when placed into a similar position in other humans or organisms. Repeating this process on an active instance of SCP-1635 will cause deactivation.\n\n\nActive instances of SCP-1635 resemble living humans, and possess similar bodily functions, although hair and nails do not grow, and no tissues have been observed to age. While they do not require any food, water, or oxygen, they will process them as expected if provided, and will show signs of psychological distress consistent with non-anomalous humans if denied these.\n\n\nAny physical trauma or pathogenic activity inflicted on SCP-1635 instances will heal as normal for a human whether the instance is currently active or inactive; lethal trauma will cause the instance to deactivate, or become permanently neutralised if somatic integrity is sufficiently compromised. SCP-1635 instances have demonstrated no ability to regrow missing tissue or regenerate limbs beyond that of a normal human.\n\n\nActive SCP-1635 instances believe that they are ordinary human beings that have been transported to their present location through means unknown to them. They are unaware of their anomalous properties, and if presented with evidence of them, will often react with surprise and distress. Each instance of SCP-1635 has a unique appearance, personality, and set of memories (see Addendum 1635-A for more details). Memories are accumulated as normal after activation, but do not persist after deactivation and subsequent reactivation.\n\n\nSCP-1635 instances uniformly manifest the same personality every time they are activated, although deviations have been recorded between the memories of the instances between activations. In addition, these memories frequently deviate from reality to a greater or lesser extent. For example, SCP-1635-1 will sometimes claim his side won the battle in which he fought, and other times lost; the affiliation and nature of the enemy against which he was fighting varies frequently as well. Repeated testing has shown a slight trend towards increased deviation between successive instances as the number of activations and reactivations increases.\n\n\nAddendum 1635-A: List of SCP-1635 Instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nSelf Identification\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-1\n\n\nHarald Erikson\n\n\nMale, approximately 35 years of age. Caucasian with red hair and green eyes. Notably muscled and physically strong.\n\n\nCommunicates in Old English. Claims to have come from the aftermath of a battle in 11th Century England. Extremely uncooperative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-2\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nFemale, approximately 20 years of age. African appearance with black hair and brown eyes.\n\n\nSubject continually displays signs of severe terror, and is either unwilling or unable to communicate with personnel. Occasionally voices utterances in no known language. Neutralised following testing of limit of SCP-1635 to regenerate after trauma. Remains incinerated individually after confirmation of lack of anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-3\n\n\nTanaka Kaito\n\n\nMale, approximately 30 years of age. Japanese with black hair and brown eyes.\n\n\nClaims to originate in Kyoto, Japan, 1997. Capitulates to any demand made; however, use as source of information diminished by tendency to answer any question with non-committal or sycophantic answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-4\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nMale, 22 years of age. Caucasian with blonde hair and blue eyes. Androgynous and skinny in appearance.\n\n\nImmediately upon activation, attempts to commit suicide by any means available. Due to this, was selected as subject for experimentation with removal of microchip. Following removal, subject behaved as normal human cadaver, with rigor mortis and decay of bodily tissue as expected. Remains since incinerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-5\n\n\nSorcia Moon\n\n\nFemale, 26 years of age. Caucasian with shaved hair and green eyes. Athletic appearance, many facial and bodily tattoos and piercings.\n\n\nClaims to originate in London, England, 1983. Extremely friendly and helpful towards all female employees; hostile and aggressive towards any male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-6\n\n\nMo Sam Ben Jak\n\n\nMale, 7 years of age. Caucasian with blonde hair and blue eyes. Unremarkable in appearance.\n\n\nClaims to originate from [REDACTED] in the year 3109. Potential use as information source to guide future Foundation activity limited by lack of specific knowledge and suspected Autistic Spectrum Disorder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1635-7\n\n\nLukas Komorowski\n\n\nMale, 48 years of age. Caucasian with brown hair and olive eyes. Large moustache.\n\n\nUnwilling to describe origins, presumed relatively contemporary Poland due to language spoken. Commanding and authoritative in tone, refusing to answer questions and instead demanding answers. When activated, malignant cancerous tumours manifest in bowel and left lung within two weeks; if untreated, these prove fatal to subject within four months. Tumours demanifest within five days of deactivation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1635-B: Circumstances of Discovery\n\n\nSCP-1635-1 through -7 were discovered in wooden crates in a warehouse in Clapham, London, following the seizure of assets of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Ltd., an automotive parts company, after its liquidation. As the company has been investigated thoroughly and shows no signs of anomalous activity or any records of the crates, it is currently believed they were dumped there some time between the abandonment of the warehouse and its seizure.\n\n\nPolice initially believed SCP-1635 to be human remains of murder victims as SCP-1635-5 appeared to match records of a missing person dating from the 1980s\n1\n The primary anomalous effects were discovered when a coroner accidentally activated SCP-1635-1 during autopsy. Foundation agents embedded in the Metropolitan Police discovered the anomaly, and standard amnestic and disinformation tactics were successful in suppressing knowledge of the incident.\n\n\nAddendum 1635-C: Sample Recovered Documentation\n\n\nThe following document was discovered inside the crate containing SCP-1635-6. Similar documents were found inside the other crates.\n\n\n\n\nSoulSearch PLC Returned Item Processing Form (02/39)\n\n\nOrder No.:\n 1536\n\n\nCustomer No.:\n CS387\n\n\nReturn Date:\n 30/05/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nContainer Description:\n M/7 HUMAN Type 12\n\n\nSearch Service Level:\n Bronze\n\n\nReason for Return:\n 08C (Unwanted facet discovered)\n\n\nCSO Decision:\n Refund approved\n\n\nCSO Comments:\n Customer failed to specify sufficient SS criteria; item received with unwanted extra facets.
