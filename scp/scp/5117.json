Contact with SCP-5117 by any sapient entity, humanoid or otherwise, is strictly prohibited. Access is to be restricted to individuals with explicit authorization from Site Director Calloway.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5117 is a pair of matching rose gold wedding bands. When two individuals wearing the rings are in physical contact, the individuals become capable of influencing reality to the same degree as a Class IV reality bender, provided both individuals express agreement with proposed changes or express similar desires.\n\n\nSCP-5117-1 was Noah Pierson, the first known individual to utilize SCP-5117's anomaly. SCP-5117-1 was neutralized on 9/25/2016.\n\n\nSCP-5117-2 was Maria Pierson, an unintended secondary user of SCP-5117's anomaly. SCP-5117-2 expired on 9/24/2016 of natural causes and was briefly reanimated via SCP-5117's anomaly before reverting to a deceased state during containment (see \nAddendum 5117-2\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRAISA NOTICE\n\n\nThe following file is incomplete.

How did do you know SCP-5117-1?\n\n\nCora:\n Please, his name is Noah.\n\n\nOlson:\n My apologies. How did you come to know Noah?\n\n\n(\nCora smiles sadly.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Childhood friend.\n\n\nOlson:\n Well, then, tell me about your childhood.\n\n\n(\nCora pauses and takes a deep breath.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Grew up in a charming little town. Parents died before I could remember, and I lived with my uncle, who was gone all the time. I had lots of time on my hands, but nobody to spend it with.\n\n\n(\nCora chuckles.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n I was\u2026odd. Friends were hard to come by, what with my strange interests. Or I guess, interest in the strange. Most of my time was spent inside, reading books, or on my computer\u2026probably isn\u2019t much of a surprise to you. I've never been a \"social butterfly\". But Noah was there for me.\n\n\nCora:\n Noah was always nice. Quiet. Timid, maybe. Friendly but not social. Lonely kid. Pretty normal-seeming, but he was a good person, which is more than a lot of people have to their name.\n\n\nCora:\n Can\u2019t remember exactly how we got on so well. I think it might be that I used to help him with schoolwork, or something. Anyways, both of us were interested in the anomalous. Of course, almost all of the stuff we looked into wasn\u2019t real. But that didn\u2019t stop our obsession.\n\n\nOlson:\n I see. So this is what led you to join the Foundation, when you were recruited out of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 University?\n\n\nCora:\n To an extent, yeah. I mean, just getting in was a challenge all to its own.\n\n\nOlson:\n And how was your relationship with Noah during your university years?\n\n\nCora:\n Well, when I went to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Noah ended up sticking around town, opening an electronics shop. Yeah, we kept in touch, but I only get to see him every so often on leave. And then, in this line of work\u2026well, you know.\n\n\n(\nCora snorts.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n I did make it to his wedding a few years back. Director got pissed because my replacement fucked things up, and that caused a breach. The big one, last December.\n\n\nOlson:\n I do remember that one.\n\n\nCora:\n Yeah. Fucked me right up. Still get nightmares over that. Do we have to talk about that?\n\n\nOlson:\n No, not at all. Would you say that you and Noah were close?\n\n\nCora:\n That\u2019s a real understatement, if I\u2019ve ever heard one. We were like brothers. Only guy keeping me from being completely alone. 'Course, the job doesn't really help. I almost feel as confined in my job as the skips.\n\n\n(\nCora looks downward.\n)\n\n\nOlson:\n Did you ever disclose any classified information to Noah?\n\n\nCora:\n Not really, no. Most I\u2019ve ever done is change around names and tell him I work with stuff I\u2019m not allowed to talk about. He thinks I work for like, FBI, or something. But it doesn\u2019t matter now. He's dead.\n\n\nOlson:\n I see. How did Noah impact your work here?\n\n\n(\nCora faces Olson.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Sorry?\n\n\nOlson:\n How did Noah affect your performance here, at the Foundation?\n\n\n(\nCora shrugs.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Only positively, no doubt. He and I would talk late into the night after a rough day. Matter of fact, I\u2019ve probably only stuck around this long because\u2026well, I thought of myself as protecting people like Noah, on the outside. So that they can carry on, \u201clive in the light.\u201d\n\n\n(\nCora pauses.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n We both know what I've done, Olson. I figured it would be a worthy sacrifice\u2026my life, my \nconscience\n, for the sake of humanity.\n\n\nCora:\n I suppose it\u2019s not really the same now, though, is it? I guess\u2026I guess if a good man like him, a civilian, can become nothing more than\u2026another anomaly\u2026to be contained, with as much thought as anyone else\u2026\n\n\nCora:\n The procedures I've developed\u2026now I can\u2019t help but remind myself that \nevery single one of them\n, from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026they were all human. At least a little. For fuck\u2019s sake, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was a goddamn \nchild\n when I locked her up.\n\n\n(\nCora swallows.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Look, if anything, please. For the love of\u2026I don't even know. Humanity, I guess. Remember that everyone you contain is at least a little bit human. That's all I ask, after all that I've done. I gave you those text logs to remember that Noah was a \nfucking human being.\n\n\n(\nOlson nods.\n)\n\n\nOlson:\n Understood. I'll do my best to get those in the file.\n\n\nCora:\n Thank you.\n\n\n(\nOlson reviews the incident report.\n)\n\n\nOlson:\n Now\u2026the records say that you performed actions to prevent the Foundation from discovering Noah\u2019s anomalous effects.\n\n\nCora:\n Is that a question?\n\n\nOlson:\n So you\u2019re not defending yourself? You realize that your actions will be perceived as neglect of Foundation protocol? How many infractions you'll get?\n\n\nCora:\n I thought I could keep him from\u2026getting to that point. I know him, you know? He would have listened to me. If I had gotten to him first, we might have settled it over lunch and moved on.\n\n\nOlson:\n Yet you violated procedures.\n\n\n(\nCora seethes.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Procedures \nthis,\n procedures \nthat.\n Procedures to keep a little girl from her mother? Procedures to kill my best friend? Procedures is \neverything\n I\u2019ve done for the past six years, Olson! I lost my \nhumanity\n to build fucking \nprocedures.\n\n\n(\nCora points at Olson, as if accusing him.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Those \nprocedures\n put him down. None of this would have happened if they\u2019d have left me to deal with Noah, instead of shooting me in the \nfucking leg\n.\n\n\n(\nCora slams the table.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n I could've saved him. I could've, if only\u2026\n\n\n(\nCora breaks down in tears.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n (\nSobbing\n) If only\u2026I hadn\u2019t left him alone.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNote: Cora obviously has immense emotional attachment to SCP-5117. Whether or not he\u2019s going to continue working at the Foundation \u2014 and with sapient anomalies, no less \u2014 amnestication seems the only proper course of action.\n - Dr. Olson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 5117-1:\n Recovered Communication Transcripts\n\n\nThe following communication records were recovered from Senior Containment Engineer Alexander Cora\u2019s personal smartphone.

Small towns like this, I'm thinking we run Trident.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Trident? I'm not sure I copy, Fraser.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Forgot you weren't with us at North Ridge, Chen.

Heading over. Locate a back door to the house if you can.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n God, this Type Green must be really out of it.\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz is standing in front of a small, suburban house. Trees in front of the house are stretching and contorting upwards as far as vision extends, and the ground is pulsating in waves. The house itself is a shifting mass, with the roof folding into itself in impossible ways while the bricks continually rearrange and restructure themselves.\n)\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz approaches the house, but the distance increases every step she takes.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n Spatial distortion, Fraser. Permission to deploy SRAs?\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Granted. No entering target location, though. Wait for us.\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz begins positioning mobile Scranton Reality Anchors along the perimeter of the target location and activates them sequentially.\n)\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen notices an unidentified figure at the back door of the target location\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Hey, I think I see a third party at target location.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Fuck.

Male, seems to be in his early 30s.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Copy that.

I'm Foundation, too. Senior Containment Engineer Alexander Cora. Please, I really need to get to Noah\u2026that's his name, Noah Pierson.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Can you show some identification?\n\n\nCora:\n Yeah, let me get my ID.\n\n\n(\nCora keeps one hand in the air while removing what appears to be a Foundation ID card from his pocket.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Command, you getting this?\n\n\nSite Command:\n Individual positively identifies as Foundation personnel, Senior Containment Engineer Alexander Cora, clearance level 3.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Got it. Cora, then?\n\n\nCora:\n That's right. Can I go?\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Hold on. Why are you here?\n\n\nCora:\n Long story. I know Noah. I'm trying to help.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n You realize you don't have sufficient clearance to even be here without post-operational amnestication?\n\n\nCora:\n I know that, but I'm already here, right? Look, I need to get in, right now. It's a matter of urgency.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n You are not cleared to enter, Cora. Far as we're concerned, you're basically civilian.\n\n\nCora:\n I know him personally, maybe I can try talking-\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Negative. Talking to Type Greens is a no-go.\n\n\nCora:\n It's not \nhim\n, I don't think. He hasn't always had this going on-\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Type Greens manifest anomalous attributes at different points. Trust me, I've seen this dozens of times.\n\n\nCora:\n And so have I. But\u2026look, you don't get it. Please, let me talk to him-\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n We have our orders, Cora. I will not hesitate to fire should you attempt to breach protocol.\n\n\n(\nCora pauses for a moment. A voice similar to an echo can be heard throughout the environment, appearing to emanate from the house.\n)\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n Alex?\n\n\n(\nA sudden reality shift absorbs Cora into the house, and rotates the entire structure.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n What-\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n Did you guys hear that?\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Yeah, I did. Alex is the third party?\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Yessir. He just\u2026ah\u2026got sucked into the house. Front door is no longer accessible.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Fuck. Hey Mu\u00f1oz, how long 'til the anchors are up?\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n Just a sec. Ah, shit, Humes are dropping again\u2026\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser checks his Kant counter, which displays a Hume level below 50 and continuing to decrease.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Hurry the fuck up! Any longer and there won't be a reality to anchor!\n\n\n(\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz rapidly activates the last mobile Scranton Reality Anchor.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n All secured, we can proceed.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Copy that.

The lights are off, certain objects in the room appear heavily distorted, and spatial consistency appears almost liquid. Portions of the room appear to unevenly possess particularly high reality fragmentation. The floor appears to flow in a liquid state.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-2 Mu\u00f1oz:\n Damn\u2026it's like Dal\u00ed painting or something in here.\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Whole floor\u2019s melting.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n How y'all faring?

Noah, where are you?\n\n\n(\nCora appears through a hallway on the inverse side of the walls, and walks toward a wall, which parts to allow him to enter, before closing behind him.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n That's Cora.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n \nare you here now\nAlex?\n\n\nCora:\n I'm here, Noah.

I really am.\n\n\n(\nLocal Hume decreases, and a flare of unidentified radiation emanates from the walls of the house. Shifting floorboards begin to splinter, and wall plaster appears to boil.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12-7 Chen:\n Cora's pissing off the Green.\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Maybe. But we need to find it first. You think that's where Cora's going?\n\n\n(\nCora re-emerges through a shifting painting, and the room appears to fold extra-spatially before manifesting through a window.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n There he is.\n\n\n(\nTeam rapidly approach Cora, and traverse extra-spatial gaps between floorboards. The roof appears to compress, forcing the space below to stretch.\n)\n\n\n(\nTeam emerges in a large, static bedroom. Cora stands at the foot of a bed and looks up toward a seemingly endless ceiling.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n What\u2026\n\n\nCora:\n (\nShouting\n) You were always there for me. I\u2026I wasn't here when you needed me. My work, my\u2026no. No excuses. I'm here now, Noah. I'm here. The world is still out there.

Just a memory\u2026a fragment of a memory. Please.\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n \nyou know nothing I know you more than you do me I was always there for you and I will be here for Maria\nAlex?\n\n\nCora:\n Is that really what you want?

A ceiling materializes and folds downward as SCP-5117-1 descends, holding onto a lifeless female figure floating behind him. Clasping the female figure's hand, which is adorned with a glowing rose gold ring, he reaches out towards Cora.\n)\n\n\nCora:\n Goodbye, Noah.\n\n\nSCP-5117-1:\n \nyou abandoned me you left me to suffer in loneliness you were my friend you are lonely too I am lonely so very lonely I am\nAlex?\n\n\n(\nCora turns back around, and walks towards the edge of the room. The distance between him and the door expands, and a force pushes him backwards, but Cora continues to trudge towards the door, and then begins climbing up to the door as the room undergoes a reality shift. Suddenly, the room inverts and Cora begins falling away from the door, but he is able to invert himself and walk towards the door along the ceiling.\n)\n\n\n(\nA brief reality stabilization allows the team to remanifest.\n)\n\n\n\u03b5-12 Lead Fraser:\n Hey.
