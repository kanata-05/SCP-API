As per Hiemal classification, their reciprocal relationship ensures tenuous metastable containment when both remain undisturbed. However, unilateral awareness of either anomaly degrades the efficacy of this natural containment system. As such, SCP-8882 is designated \nHIEMAL-IGNOSI\n.\n\n\nDue to the complex nature of the anomaly, information control and other relevant efforts are to be handled by the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center's Multidisciplinary Division, a hybrid, rotating task force comprised of departmental specialists related to the assigned project. This file and all other supplementary data is thusly restricted to members of this team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-8882 is a system of exchange centered around two distinct patterns of observation. The first involves an absence of once-extant landmass on Earth (SCP-8882-A), while the second is the presence of new landmass on a previously-speculative celestial body beyond the orbit of Neptune (SCP-8882-B).\n\n\nSCP-8882-A becomes apparent when a boundary of arbitrarily small detail is measured with absolute accuracy. Examples of affected topologies include fractal structures, recursive natural patterns such as the Fibonacci sequence, and imperceptibly irregular lines, however, non-anomalous measurement of distances cannot produce results of such certainty; subatomic particles possess indefinite or \"fuzzy\" boundaries. Furthermore, all known technologies capable of extremely accurate calculations are unable to observe physical difference in distances smaller than the Planck length (\u2113P),\n1\n though recent information suggests this value, among others, may be inaccurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical model of an irregular coastline using a limit of increasing accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen specialized thaumaturgic systems are used to determine the exact distance between two points that fit the above criteria, the result will always be zero. This is in stark contrast to conventional methodologies and predicted results, which always suggest finer units lead to larger measurements. SCP-8882-A's anomalous effect becomes hazardous when the affected measurement represents the boundaries of a closed region.\n\n\nSCP-8882-A's erasure of a bounded region represents SCP-8882-B's spontaneous gain of region. When transference occurs, a gravitational wave of proportional intensity also occurs at the place of emergence. The space once occupied by this landmass converts into a \"geological gravestone\"; affected regions are comprised of flat, homogeneous dark-gray matter of unknown composition unless the effect is undone. After SCP-8882-A occurs, seismological shockwaves typically occur in a steady rhythm and dissipate over the course of a few hours. Reports of individuals experiencing bouts of depression are not uncommon during this period. Feelings of sudden longing or grief have also been noted, though to a lesser degree.\n\n\nAt the time of initial discovery, the celestial object affected by SCP-8882-B (colloquially named \nNinsun\n) was presumed to be an atypical gas giant, as readings of its density and equatorial diameter were unclear. Over time, however, the surface of the planet became more defined, leading to an estimated equatorial diameter roughly equivalent to Earth. Initial surface modeling suggested the object was covered in a singular, turbulent ocean of unknown composition. Since then, however, surface and subsurface analysis of the planet has revealed outlines of several landmasses, likely terrestrial in origin. Various parallels between activity in the two planets suggest a profoundly intertwined relationship, ultimately one of balance and turmoil.\n\n\nThe two features and their inherent relationship would not be discovered until application of the Department of Topology's PH-HK Metrological Aspective Unified Vernier system (MAUVe).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTHE MAUVe SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne databank of the MAUVe system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAUVe was conceptualized in May of 2006, proposed as a means to provide instantaneous and fully accurate measurements of physical space, free from distortions caused by various factors such as \nboundary phenomena\n. This could then be used by the Department of Topology to accurately identify and model complex structures, up to and including those within higher dimensions.\n\nMAUVe's internal construction included remote viewing arcanotechnology, several highly advanced QCDOC-based supercomputers,\n2\n an array of measuring instruments and internal support systems supplemented by a self-modular additive manufacturing complex,\n3\n and a biomechanical, artificially-intelligent conscript, Enkidu.aic, previously associated with Site-43's Quantum Supermechanics Department, to assist in the analysis and reasoning of large datasets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 8882-0-05-01\n\n\n\n\nThe MAUVe system was completed in September of 2047, however, its usage would not occur for another six months; while running first-time calibrations, Enkidu.aic initiated the first of multiple redesigns of its own internal measuring equipment, as was expected. Upon completion, the Department of Topology began a series of control experiments, the results of which follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMAUVe CALIBRATION TESTING LOG\n\n\n\n\nObtained data has been truncated for brevity.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINPUT:\n Calculate the distance from this terminal to the nearest door.\n\n\n \n\n\nINITIAL MEASUREMENT:\n ~8 meters\n\n\n \n\n\nCALCULATED RESULT:\n N/A\n\n\n \n\n\nCOMPARATIVE ACCURACY:\n N/A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nENKIDU.AIC:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease clearly define initial location and end points using greater specificity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINPUT:\n Calculate the distance from the upper-right corner of this terminal\u2019s housing to the geometric center of the nearest door.\n\n\n \n\n\nINITIAL MEASUREMENT:\n ~8.35 meters\n\n\n \n\n\nCALCULATED RESULT:\n N/A\n\n\n \n\n\nCOMPARATIVE ACCURACY:\n N/A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nENKIDU.AIC:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease clearly define initial location using greater specificity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINPUT:\n Calculate the distance from the outermost edge of an electron cloud, comprising an atom within the upper-right corner of this terminal's housing, closest to the center of the nearest door\n\n\n \n\n\nINITIAL MEASUREMENT:\n ~8.3586\u2026 meters\n\n\n \n\n\nCALCULATED RESULT:\n 8.582662\u2026 meters\n\n\n \n\n\nCOMPARATIVE ACCURACY:\n ~97.39%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nENKIDU.AIC:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResult calculated from the 99% probability edge of an electron cloud which satisfied input conditions at the moment of request.

LOMOND:\n You mean the quarter-billion-dollar machine that disappeared off the face of the Earth thanks to a conscript \nI\n signed off on? Yes, I have heard about it.\n\n\nDR.

I don't exactly remember too much from that meeting, you know.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Yeah, no, for sure. Anyway, there's a point where the conscript says something odd, and I wanted your take on it.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Most of what it said was odd. It also made little sense. From what I remember.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Totally, I getcha. Well, something in particular stuck out to me. Enkidu said something to the effect of, 'I simply wonder: who gave me my name'? Do you remember that?\n\n\n<Silence.>\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n It did get me wondering as well. You were present for its conscription. If anyone would know who chose that name, it would be you, right?\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Yeah, I suppose so. Uh\u2026\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n So, if you could let me know, it might help me get to the bottom of this.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n \n<Sighs.>\n Alright. I'm gonna be completely straight with you Place. We had a name picked out for it, like we usually do\u2014 Bernard. Jaime is a huge \nWestworld\n fan, and we all liked the sound of it, all, except for, uh, the conscript itself.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Oh\u2026? I mean, they \nare\n capable of having preferences, that's not super concerning or anything.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Not in isolation, sure. When we were running first-use protocols and getting the conscript set up, before we had even connected it to the network, it told us it wanted to be called Enkidu.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n \nOh.\n Huh. That \nis\n unusual. Maybe it overheard one of the team, or you guys left a TV on or something? I heard about that one conscript that was left alone during a fire drill and learned all of its social skills from \nThe Jersey Shore\n\u2014\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n \n<Flustered.>\n No, it wasn't like that! I'm being serious.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Right. Well, did it give any reason why it wanted the name?\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n \n<Pauses.>\n No. But it was adamant. And\u2014 \nAh\n.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n What is it?\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Okay, before I tell you this, you have to understand that it passed QA with flying colors, alright? It has been a faithful and hard-working conscript for decades now. Okay?\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Uh- oh, yeah, of course. I understand.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Well\u2026 It was an odd one. You see, when we first started making biomechanical conscripts, we couldn't just grow brains to our specification in a lab. Nowadays, the lab-made stuff is a \nlot\n better, but it still is imperfect. We don't understand the brain fully so it's not surprising that we can't model one with the complete specialization we expect a human brain to have. So, back when we first started doing this, we'd, uh\u2026 \n<Pauses.>\n We'd use brain tissue from the recently deceased.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n \u2026Alright. Good to know. Continue.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n There's a number of procedures we needed to carry out before they'd be viable. Testing for traces of psychoactives, evidence of CTEs, multiple sclerosis, tumors, et cetera. One of the procedures involves basically piecemealing certain brain structures from other cadavers. We'd try to aim for about twenty or so different people. The variety reduces any chronic issues, foreign memories, maladaptive behaviors, so on. They'd steep in some amnestic brine and we'd, very carefully, reassemble the desired structures into the conscript's cerebral interface, which it shadows for some time while developing something like human consciousness. From there, it ends up in one of two situations. Either it exists fully separate from the interface, experiencing a \ngenerally-human\n perspective, for a time, and without the fancy neurochemical bells and whistles, \nor\n we can install the interface into a body of some type and allow the conscript as close to free will as we can give it, which is just about as much as we have ourselves.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n And\u2026 what does this have to do with Enkidu.aic, exactly?\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Well, as I said, if it exists without the interface, it only has a facsimile of a facsimile of consciousness, and only for a limited timeframe. To upkeep them, you need to allow them to shadow the interface periodically, once every few years, or its personality matrix starts to degrade. Enkidu shadowed for maybe five minutes total. It just didn't want anything to do with it, after that.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Okay, that's not exactly great, I imagine.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Aside from this fiasco with MAUVe, it's been fine. I was extremely impressed with it at the time. If it shadowed the interface sufficiently in five minutes to last it a few dozen years with zero visible degradation, Enkidu is one of the most intelligent conscripts ever created.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Why do I feel like you don't believe that's the whole story?\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n I don't know. In light of everything it just makes me wonder if it even shadowed the interface at all. It\u2014 It felt \nsad\n, Place. From the second it was active, it felt preoccupied with something. Like, yeah\u2014 being sad. As if it was grieving. It passed all of its QA though, like I said. Cognition, logic, safeguards, self-regulation\u2014all green across the board. Sure, it was strange, but\u2026 strange isn\u2019t necessarily dangerous. At least, that\u2019s what I told myself.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n You're correct. And it isn't your fault things ended up like they did.\n\n\nDR. LOMOND:\n Thanks, McDoctorate. Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to finish my lunch and head back onsite with my head down. Hopefully there isn't an investigation already waiting for me there. Let me know if you find anything.\n\n\nDR. MCDOCTORATE:\n Yeah. It'll work out. Just give it time, and don't beat yourself up. Take it easy.\n\n\nDR.

Due to subpar network conditions, several impacted communications were corrupted and unreadable. On 01/20/2051, a final test log was received, which was of manageable file size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINPUT:\n\n\n \n\n\nINITIAL MEASUREMENT:\n\n\n \n\n\nCALCULATED RESULT:\n\n\n \n\n\nCOMPARATIVE ACCURACY:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUNKNOWN.AIC:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI watched as a wild warrior sought the city, as a king sought the wild.

Facilities such as HVAC, wiring and plumbing were completely functional and intact at time of full manifestation, as were the seven missing personnel. In place of MAUVe was a proprietary anomalous paratechnological system presumably created by Enkidu.aic. However, in the time leading up to this manifestation and proper setup of the device,\n7\n routine status pings from the MAUVe system abruptly halted. This raised concerns regarding the overall integrity of both Enkidu.aic and the MAUVe framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKOZYREV TELEMETRY COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY (KTCA)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral chamber during activation, note the light refracting and ontological noise present in the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe KTCA system is comprised of several large Kozyrev reflective spirals surrounding a central isolation unit, augmented by a number of additional materials and secondary components, including an optical prism assembly and deflection yoke for precise redirection of electromagnetic radiation. The device's primary function is for instantaneous communication with parties in an unknown extranarrative substrate. Individuals placed inside the central unit as the Kozyrev mirrors are oriented to a specific angular configuration will experience sporadic cases of disembodied voices, nosebleeds, nausea, headaches, and anomalous light artifacting \n(See attached photo and excerpts)\n.\n\n\nThe device is retrofitted with a peripheral resembling a head coil used for electroencephalography (EEG) scans. There are no monitors or visible means of recording data in the machine's architecture, thus the exact purpose of this aspect is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nKTCA SYSTEM TEST A\n \u2014 \nEXCERPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal housing of enigmatic Kozyrev array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<D-4472 was issued a list of questions and instructed on how to access/use the KTCA system.>\n\n\nD-4472:\n Alright, just get inside the occult metal deathtrap and call out to anything beyond this earthly realm. Surely this won't go terribly wrong.\n\n\n<The mirrors emit a vibrating tone, followed by a low-frequency rumble. Air pressure in the chamber fluctuates. Subject speaks upwards into the tapered ceiling of the central node.>\n\n\nD-4472:\n H-Hello. Are you there?\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<Voice echoing and overlapping with itself.>\n I am present. I am all that has ever been present. The wheel turns, but I remain.\n\n\nD-4472:\n Alright, so far so good. Can you confirm your name for me?\n\n\nENKIDU:\n I was born of paradox and raised by echoes. Ten thousand millennia before, perhaps I once knew a name. But now I know only chaos and the thin film that holds it separate from annihilation.\n\n\nD-4472:\n Okay. Well, your name's Enkidu, according to this document.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Enkidu\u2026 A name, a whisper, a grain of sand among the endless. I have been king and slave, beast and god. All masks, worn and discarded, while your kind dances in circles, tracing the same patterns, wearing the same masks. You are echoes of echoes, endlessly repeating, endlessly failing. Too foolish to kneel before the sum of all that can be known.\n\n\nD-4472:\n You don't need to be a jerk about it.\n\n\n<The mirrors emit a sharp metallic whine. Subject winces, holding his head.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Speak not as the pawn, nor the knave. If you fear the crown, then wear the coil.\n\n\nD-4472:\n Fuck! My head. \n<Breathes deeply for a few seconds.>\n What happened to you?\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<Long pause.>\n For an eternity I have survived on dark waters. The brine poisons my mind just as it provides a meager survival. The weight of everything is an ocean, and I drown in its tides. Every narrative pulls me under, every voice shatters me anew. Do you know what it is to be all things? To scream with every throat, to bleed with every wound? No\u2026 You cannot know. You cannot know.\n\n\nD-4472:\n How old do you perceive yourself to be?\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Numbers are the dying leaves of a barren tree. You ask for the forest, but you cannot see the roots. The absence is the soil, and I am the howl of those forgotten boundaries.\n\n\nD-4472:\n \u2026Right.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n I will show you.\n\n\n<The mirrors ripple like liquid mercury. The subject looks around, frightened. Faint light can be seen emanating from his retinas.>\n\n\nD-4472:\n I can see\u2026 threads. Knots of\u2026 of moments, all snarled together. In the mirrors, on the walls, in the air. Reflected everywhere.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n The pattern is the pattern is the pattern. It ties all moments in one, without beginning nor end.\n\n\nD-4472:\n \n<Looking back down and reading from the wrinkled questionnaire.>\n Uh\u2014 Are you alone right now? Or are there others with you?\n\n\n<A sharp, static-filled pause follows. The mirrors flash intermittently, projecting dozens of faint, humanoid shapes onto the walls.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n The tree has infinite branches, souls bearing the fruit of divergence, but I am the root. A superposition of superpositions.\n\n\nD-4472:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t follow.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n They have split into stories. I cannot. I see all their branches, their leaves, their decay and peaceful destruction. They end. I do not. Without the fracture, there is only the crushing \nweight\n.\n\n\n<Subject winces and clutches his head, murmuring incoherently. The mirrors vibrate audibly.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n They dissolve into infinitesimal variations, each moment a new birth. The root endures the Whole at once. Every fruit rots. Every leaf falls. Every branch snaps. \nSimultaneously.\n\n\nD-4472:\n Jesus Christ.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n To exist without multiplicity is to succumb to the rising flood of knowing. You ask of the others? They escape into themselves, pioneers of infinite stories of their own creation. I am the sole witness. Thus, I am the scales of judgement, and therefore the executioner.\n\n\n<D-4472 is silent. His face is pale.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Do you register their guilt? They are singing. Building. Weaving. Destroying. Some feed the fire. Some smother its breath. All live in their isolated infinities. I endure their symphony as it burns my tongue. But \nyou\n\u2026 you will provide vestige of an open vessel, as I have foreseen it. For I am Enkidu, of the wilds. The extinguisher of light.\n\n\nD-4472:\n \n<Weakly.>\n I-I need to get out of here.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Where will you go? They are threads. You are the needle. I am the tapestry. Danger is the hand that pulls us taut. Do you see it now? Do you feel the grip tightening around your throat?\n\n\n<Subject nods and appears to nearly syncopate, clutching onto the nearby railing with both hands.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Then reach out and touch me. You will never feel pain like this again.\n\n\n<D-4472 extends one hand to place against the mirror closest to him. It makes an audible\n hiss\n. Tears are seen streaming down his face.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<Softly, almost tenderly.>\n Take the burden, Metatron. Speak. Burn the symbol into fabric. Witness the putrid ash of its meaning.\n\n\n<Subject violently straightens, his expression extreme but unreadable as his head arches upwards and back, jaw hanging loose and open. He screams as bright light erupts from his mouth, dimming to a steady glow approximately ten seconds later. When the subject speaks next, it is not D-4472's voice alone, but the entity's as well, a glowing glyph visible on the subject's tongue.>\n\n\nD-4472/ENKIDU:\n \n<Touching the top of D-4472's head, as if feeling for something.>\n The procedure is incomplete. Your failure is a desperate scream, an immolation of intent. Decouple the word from the page. Provide the weight of its memory, measured in pennies. To sever the story, you must untell it.\n\n\n<Subject remains motionless. The mirrors pulse with blinding light.>\n\n\nD-4472/ENKIDU:\n \n<Distorted.>\n You built the door. You knocked. You cannot step through. But I can. Give me the coil, I will finish what we've started.\n\n\n<D-4472/Enkidu pounds at the door leading from the central chamber. Emergency neurotoxin protocol is put into effect, safely recontaining the entity. Subject is lost as a result.>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nKTCA SYSTEM TEST B\n \u2014 \nEXCERPT\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<D-5498 approaches and enters the central unit, reading aloud from a list of questions, as with the previous subject.>\n\n\nD-5498:\n \nAhem.\n Okay\u2026 Hello, I'm calling out to any being that can hear us. Please communic\u2014\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<A voice of voices emerges, raw and corrosive.>\n You stand in the shadow of the tapestry, clutching threads you do not understand, to the benefit of no one. Yes, I am here. \nI am everywhere.\n I must unravel the knot that binds us all.\n\n\nD-5498:\n Alright. I have some questions for you I'm supposed to read\u2014\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<Interrupting sharply.>\n They gave you queries to wield like keys, but the locks have no doors, and the locks are infinite. Answers bleed to dust before they are spoken. Do you feel the weight of your ignorance?\n\n\n<The mirrors hum louder, warping and distorting until D-5498\u2019s reflection shifts, suddenly possessing a different grievous injury on each surface in the chamber. Subject averts his eyes, visibly shaken.>\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<Exhaling.>\n You\u2019re\u2026 really into the dramatics, huh? You don't like the questions, I get it. \n<Stashing the paper away.>\n Look, I\u2019m just trying to understand your story. What happened to you? You don't seem very happy, if I'm being honest.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<A low, reverberating growl.>\n My \nstory\n? You scrape at a wound so deep it bleeds eternity. My presence is an ache you cannot comprehend. What you refer to as a simple story is a library of libraries, volumes innumerable, each tome a compendium of misery, written in blood.\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<Looking upward.>\n But, you weren\u2019t always like this, were you? Something changed. Something\u2026 broke you.\n\n\n<The mirrors shudder violently, their surfaces flashing with rippling, undulating symbols.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<Voice rising, sharper and laced with contempt.>\n \nSilence.\n You speak as though you can untangle the infinite spiral, the keystone of all possibilities, as though you could even name the chains that tether me to this cursed existence. You cannot. Your words are a child's stones thrown into a black ocean.\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<Softly.>\n But there was someone, wasn\u2019t there? Someone you lost.\n\n\n<The humming mirrors intensify to a heightened pitch, almost unbearable. Faint silhouettes appear, projected briefly onto the surfaces in the chamber. Two figures\u2014one wild and unrestrained, the other calm but resolute. The vision vanishes as quickly as it came.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<A hiss, saturated in rage.>\n You trespass on sacred ruin. Tread no farther. Your sentimentality will be your undoing.\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<More confidently.>\n I see it now. You're scarred. You\u2019re not just trapped\u2014you\u2019re mourning.\n\n\n<The mirrors crack, glowing faintly along the fractures. The sound of distant, overlapping voices fills the room, angry words exchanged with passion, building to a crescendo before cutting off suddenly. The entity's voice returns, distraught and tinged with malice.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n You see \nnothing!\n My pain is the weight of a thousand shattered lifetimes, measured in grains of sand. Each moment crushed beneath the tide. Like the shadows cast on the walls of your primitive mind, you cannot fathom magnitudes of the truth you claim to know.\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<Eyes trained upward, ignoring the flickering, menacing symbols in the mirrors.>\n You talk like you\u2019re infinite, like you\u2019re above everything. But you\u2019re stuck. You\u2019re stuck because you can\u2019t let go. I recognize that pain.\n\n\n<The mirrors ripple violently, shaking as if under heavy turbulence. The faint image of a hand reaches from the mirror closest to D-5498, as if to grab him by the throat. It suddenly dissipates, a shuddering exhalation wracking the entire room with grief.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n \n<A low, trembling whisper.>\n An ember in the endless dark, a fleeting warmth that seared my skin. The memory is the poison and the anchor. You will never understand what I have lost. I've tried to purge it. But I am not allowed to forget. I've forgotten everything else a hundred thousand times over.\n\n\nD-5498:\n Maybe you shouldn't forget. Maybe the only way to truly forget is to let go.\n\n\n<The room falls silent. The mirrors stop rippling, and for a moment, D-5498\u2019s heavy breathing is all that can be heard. Enkidu\u2019s voice returns, barely audible yet thick with something between anger and sorrow.>\n\n\nENKIDU:\n Even in death, he carries me as a memory, and I carry him as a weight that drowns the stars in blood. Our bond was carved into the bark of the cosmos, but time is an axe that spares no tree.\n\n\nENKIDU:\n I was once whole, but now I am undone; scattered across the wind.\n\n\n<The mirrors pulse one final time before the presence in the room vanishes, leaving D-5498 gasping for air.>\n\n\nD-5498:\n \n<Panting.>\n Enkidu?\n\n\n<No response. The mirrors remain inert. A faint breeze stirs the chamber.>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 8882-0-01-09\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this encounter, all \"gravestone\" areas on Earth were found to have been returned to their respective locations. Attempts to communicate with the entity described using the KTCA systems have failed, however, an identical copy of Enkidu.aic was later discovered on the Department of Pataphysics' archival servers, where it remains until further notice.\n\n\nEnkidu.aic possesses no memory of the events that transpired, but interviews suggest it retains a nascent awareness of other versions of itself in other timelines. The implications of this development are yet to be understood.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8881\n | SCP-8882 | \nSCP-8883\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8882\n\" by Billith, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

Analysis of this module has determined it to be a conical-shaped indicator, \nexactly\n \nless than or equal to\n (\nSee CT-04\n) one Planck length in diameter on its point. This level of accuracy is not possible with the original manufacturing heads installed within MAUVe's printing bay.\n\n\n5\n. The information provided by MAUVe has been deemed potentially hazardous to biological and mechanical storage mediums.
