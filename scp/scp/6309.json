All Foundation personnel with level two clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-6309 at the discretion of the site director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6309 is Junior Researcher Mary Name\u2019s resignation letter. SCP-6309\u2019s anomalous abilities manifest when it is damaged in any capacity, after which it will anomalously repair itself to its original state after a period of ten minutes.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-6309 anomalous capabilities were discovered after being placed in a paper shredder by Dr. Name. One hour after its presumed destruction, Dr. Name returned to empty the contents of the paper shredder and discovered SCP-6309 intact.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-6309-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum-6309-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Resignation Notice\n\n\n\n\n\nget out of my head\n\nget out of \nmy\n head\n\n\nWhen I say \nmy\n head, I mean mine. Not Dr. Name\u2019s, not stop1010\u2019s, not anyone else\u2019s, mine.\n\n\nFor the past year, four months, and twelve days, there has not been one where I haven\u2019t thought about you. I hate it. I don\u2019t hate \nyou\n, I just hate how you\u2019re everywhere I go.\n\n\nEvery time, without fail, anytime I read or watch a piece of fiction, the first thought I think is \u201cWow, that would be a good SCP!\u201d\n\n\nEvery. Time.\n\n\nMore than that, even when doing mundane tasks I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I\u2019ll be looking at a door knob and think, \u201cWhat if that knob became the dot in PONG, bouncing off the sides of the door frame? That would be an interesting article!\u201d\n\n\nSometimes, I\u2019ll have dreams, not of an SCP or anything, but of me writing an SCP or thinking of a concept for an SCP.\n\n\nI do not like doing any of the things listed here.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering now, \u201cHey, if you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you take a br-\u201d\n\n\nI already did that. Nothing has changed.\n\n\nI do not enjoy writing 99% of the time anymore. It is painful. It hurts to write.\n\n\nEvery time I\u2019m not writing about you, I want to be. Every time I\u2019m writing about you, I don\u2019t want to.\n\n\nI do not know why I still think about you. I don\u2019t want to. I want to move on with my life. It is painful to think about you. Yet I still think about you anyways.\n\n\n\n\nThis is such a stupid fucking idea. I come up with some dumb little phrase and waste a day writing an article. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t even call it \u201cwriting.\u201d I wrote three paragraphs and spent the rest of the day \nthinking\n about writing this article.\n\n\nThe procrastination didn\u2019t stop yesterday either. I spent the entire day listening to music and pretending the lyrics were about this article I haven\u2019t written yet. You were in my head the whole day.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night now and I\u2019m finally getting this over with.\n\n\nItem #\n SCP-6309\n\n\nObject class:\n I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point. I\u2019m trying to find out what this is.\n\n\nLet\u2019s just go with \u201cUncontained\u201d for now.\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n I have no idea.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6309 is a memetic phenomenon that has only affected me. \nI will now only refer to myself as SCP-6309-1.\n1\n\n\nSCP-6309 takes the form of persistent intrusive thoughts of the SCP wiki, even when none are desired. Experiences of SCP-6309 exponentially increase over a period of approximately 1.5 years.\n\n\nI have reported spending, at minimum, seven hours per day experiencing SCP-6309.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think writing this is a bad idea. I\u2019ve been spending way too much time thinking about how to make this into an interesting article that people like.\n\n\nThen I asked myself,\n\n\n\u201cDo I want this to be a good article, or do I want you to take this seriously?\u201d\n\n\nIt may be disappointing for both of us, but I think I know how to contain this thing now.\n\n\nMaybe a bit of disappointment is what I need right now.\n\n\nYou know what you need to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-6309-B\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum-6309-B\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/13/2022 at approximately 5:31 AM, SCP-XXXX and Dr. Name \nspontaneously dematerialized.\n\n\nThe following note was found at Dr. Name\u2019s desk:\n\n\n\n\nthank you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6\u00a0Show\u00a0Archived\u00a0Documentation?\u00a0\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25bcClose\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6309\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The following Procedures are to be enacted if Dr. Name attempts to document SCP-6309, or displays signs of being willing to document SCP-6309 at a later date:\n\n\n\u2022 Dr. Name is to consume media containing content that can be vaguely utilized to describe SCP-6309. Dr. Name is to visualize documenting SCP-XXXX for as long as feasibly attainable before actual documentation of SCP-6309 begins.\n\n\n\u2022 Following the start of documentation of SCP-6309, Dr. Name is to be offered edited versions of SCP-6309\u2019s documentation. Edited drafts of SCP-6309\u2019s documentation are to possess clinical tone, simplified explanations of SCP-6309, and an absence of spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors.\n\n\n\u2022 Following rejection of these edits, Dr. Name is to extend SCP-6309\u2019s document\u2019s length by several paragraphs, through the addition of several addendums and footnotes.\n\n\n\u2022 Following the removal of these paragraphs, Dr. Name is to display apprehensiveness when attempting to finalize SCP-6309\u2019s documentation.\n\n\n\u2022 Following the failure of all previous Containment Procedures, all paper products in Dr. Name\u2019s office are to be replaced with instances of Anomalous Item AI-72914\n2\n\n\nThis iteration of SCP-6309\u2019s documentation is being created in accordance with the Special Containment Procedures, as to delay the publication of SCP-6309\u2019s article and to increase the article\u2019s length.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6309\u2019s description will be found in Addendum-6309-A.\n\n\nYou are to not comply with the instructions that will be given in Addendum-6309-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Well, that\u2019s just plain unnecessary. Not only is it confusing, it distracts from the point. SCP-6309 affects \nme\n. Calling myself anything else will make containing this thing actively harder.\n\n\n2\n.
