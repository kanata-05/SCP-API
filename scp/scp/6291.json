When testing is not occurring, SCP-6291 is to be left open, and topped with a book weight.\n\n\nFollowing incident SCP-6291-X, SCP-6291 must be contained in a \n7\u00a0m x 7\u00a0m x 8\u00a0m\n 11\u00a0m x 11\u00a0m x 12\u00a0m humanoid containment cell within the designated, Area-122. It, and Area-122 itself is to be put under constant surveillance by at least \n2\n 3 research personnel\n,and 4 guards are to be positioned in front of SCP-6291\u2019s cell door at all times\n. No personal are to enter the cell of SCP-6291 under any circumstances. \nAny SCP-6291-1 instances deemed hostile are to be terminated immediately.\n If any SCP-6291-1 instances are deemed hostile, or attempt to breach Area-122, the on-site war head is to be detonated. Missing person cases related to SCP-6291 are to be covered up. Staff can request to take non-anomalous recipes for personal use, this request must be approved by at least 2 level 4 staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6291 is a hardcover copy of \nThe Red Velvet Lover\u2019s Cookbook\n, written by Deborah Harroun. It is near identical to a non-anomalous copy, with the exception of it missing the index and acknowledgment pages.\n\n\nIts anomalous properties manifest upon reaching page 122, which is the last non-anomalous recipe in the book, and turning the page. When this occurs, a recipe not in the original book will be present. Pages can continuously be turned, giving an infinite amount of different red velvet themed recipes. The latest page the book has been turned to is page \n629\n currently unknown following incident SCP-6291-X; however, it is predicted to be in the range of 1,450 and 1,550. These recipes range from deserts, such as angel food cake, to entrees, such as red velvet marinated steak. Closing the book will reset the page count.\n\n\nAt times, recipes for creating SCP-6291-1 instances appear. SCP-6291-1 instances are sapient entities that are created \nwhen following the recipe that SCP-6291 presents\n by SCP-6291. These entities are made entirely of red velvet cake, white chocolate, and cream cheese frosting, along with a random quantity of other abnormal, or otherwise anomalous ingredients. The entities range from friendly to incredibly hostile, and it has been noted that, in most cases, the later the page number, the more hostile the entity. The entities, while usually frail, show great quantities of strength and agility, which has lead to 2 containment breaches. Consumption of the entities' mass has been proven safe. The rate of these recipes materializing is inconsistent.\n\n\nSome instances created include:\n\n\n\n\nA \nLycalopex culpaeus\n1\n with approximately 19 tails.\n\n\nA 3m tall humanoid figure.\n\n\nAn \nUrsus arctos\n2\n.\n\n\nAn unrecognizable mass of canine and feline faces.\n\n\nA \nPterodactylus antiquus\n3\n.\n\n\nA 1\u00a0m tall \nPygocentrus nattereri\n4\n with humanoid legs and a luminescent fin ray, similar to that of a \nMelanocetus johnsonii\n5\n.\n\n\nA human liver with humanoid arms.\n\n\nA \nRhinolophus hipposideros\n6\n, with multiple tumor like structures on its body.\n\n\nAn \nOrcinus orca\n7\n, with multiple lacerations, burns, and blisters across its body.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some excerpts from SCP-6291 after page 122.\n\n\n\n\nMeringues\n\n\nMeringues are so tasty, and easy to make! Usually when I require only an egg yolk for a recipe, these are where my left over whites go! Oh, and what a good place to put them. \nMakes 48.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the meringues:\n\n\n1 teaspoon red food coloring\n\n\n2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n\n2 teaspoons water\n\n\n1\u00a01/2 cups of sugar\n\n\n6 egg whites\n\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n\n1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar\n\n\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n\n\n1.\n In a sauce pot, combine your food coloring, cocoa powder, and water at low heat. Stir until smooth, and take off heat.\n\n\n2.\n In a separate bowl, beat egg whites and sugar together until well combined, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat for another 6-7 minutes, until stiff peaks form.\n\n\n3.\n Once your cocoa powder mixture has cooled down, fold it into your egg whites. Stirring or over folding will result in flat meringues. Load your mixture into a piping bag.\n\n\n4.\n Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and preheat your oven to 200 degrees. Place a dab of your mixture with the piping bag on your parchment paper, should allow you to load 24 onto a large pan.\n\n\n5.\n Bake for 40 minutes, or until the outside is crispy. Allow to cool before enjoying.\n\n\nExtras \n*\n 173\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroccoli and Rice\n\n\nBroccoli and rice has been a timeless combo, going back many years! Let\u2019s put a little red velvety twist on it, which will be bound to make red velvet lovers jump for joy! \nMakes 4-6 portions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the broccoli and rice:\n\n\n2 cups chicken broth\n\n\n1 tablespoon butter\n\n\n1/4 cup butter milk\n\n\n1 cup white rice\n\n\n1/4 cup bell pepper, chopped\n\n\n1 box frozen broccoli\n\n\n2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\n\n1/2 tablespoon red food coloring\n\n\n1.\n Boil butter, broth, and milk in a medium sauce pan. Add your rice and stir to combine. Reduce your heat, and cover for about 15 minutes.\n\n\n2.\n Add in your broccoli, bell pepper, cocoa powder, sugar, and red food coloring. Cook for an additional 3 minutes to ensure proper incorporation. Fluff with a fork and serve.\n\n\nExtras \n*\n 245\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Allen\n\n\nMother said we must always appeal to Saint Allen. He\u2019s partially my inspiration for this book. If we don\u2019t worship him, we all might get sent to the deepest pits of hell. The culture is quite important. \nMakes 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Saint Allen:\n\n\n1/3 cup cocoa powder\n\n\n1\u00a08 oz. bag white chocolate\n\n\n2 tablespoons butter milk\n\n\n2 teaspoons of sugar\n\n\n1 tablespoon menstrual blood\n\n\n2 teaspoons gastric acid\n\n\n4 cups of flour\n\n\n1 living child, about 55 lbs.\n\n\n1 Quran\n\n\n1 Bible\n\n\n1 Tanakh\n\n\n1 teaspoon red food coloring\n\n\n12 oz. cream cheese\n\n\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n\n4 oz. human hair\n\n\n1 placenta\n\n\n1 chicken egg, embryo included\n\n\n1 teaspoon human tears\n\n(I will be personally tripling this recipe for a more affective worship.)\n\n\n1.\n Combine your cocoa powder, white chocolate, butter milk, sugar, menstrual blood, and gastric acid in a medium bowl, stirring until evenly mixed. Add in your flour.\n\n\n2.\n [EXPUNGE PER ORDERS OF THE ETHICS COMMITEE]\n\n\n3.\n [EXPUNGE PER ORDERS OF THE ETHICS COMMITEE]\n\n\n4.\n Take your Quran, Bible, and Tanakh, and organize them into a semi circle. Pour 1/2 of your mixture evenly onto the covers of each book. Beat the red food coloring, cream cheese, butter, and hair into the remaining mixture. Pour it into the middle of the semi circle.\n\n\n5.\n [EXPUNGE PER ORDERS OF THE ETHICS COMMITEE]\n\n\n6.\n Place the remaining portion of the placenta onto the Quran. Crack your egg over the Bible, and pour the tears over the Tanakh.\n\n\n7.\n [EXPUNGE PER ORDERS OF THE ETHICS COMMITEE]\n\n\n8.\n When Saint Allen appears, let him free. Remind him that you helped him with his goal. He will thank you, and you will be going to a good place in the afterlife.\n\n\nExtras \n*\n 311\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\n\nOn March 30th, 2017, a complaint was sent to Deborah Harroun, regarding displeasing recipes being found throughout the book, a specific example being red velvet mashed potatoes on page 127. Deborah Harroun was reasonably confused about this and requested that the customer return the product.\n\n\nNoticing the grotesque recipes herself, she made a call to Amazon, believing that they tampered with her products. The Foundation intercepted this call, specifically noting the disturbing recipe for an entity named \u201cThe rebirth\u201d, and retrieved SCP-6291, along with giving amnestics to anyone involved.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0SCP-6291-A1:\u00a0Testing\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nThese tests were run by Researcher Lukasik. Subjects were asked to turn the pages of SCP-6291. They were then requested to follow the recipe given. A large quantity of varying ingredients were presented.\n\n\n\n\n6291-A\n\n\nSubject:\n D-163\n\n\nRecipe:\n Mille-feuille\n\n\nPage number:\n 123\n\n\nResults:\n Divine, flavorful and creamy cream cheese custard with crisp red velvet pastry.\n\n\nAdditional notes:\n Recipe has been requested by multiple personnel.

When page 632 was turned to page 633, there was a recipe for an entity named \u201cPriest Calvin\u201d. When D-372 attempted to turn the page, the book resisted, and instead an SCP-6291-1 instance identical to the one described on page 633 was created. The instance breached containment and terminated approximately 39 personnel. Throughout this time, it was discovered SCP-6291-1 instances can verbally communicate, as it was heard yelling \"I'm here to save you from the undying boredom\". SCP-6291 proved impossible to close, the pages started to lack numerical labeling, and the pages continued to turn themselves at an inconsistent rate, usually pausing longer than normal for SCP-6291-1 instances, which it then creates. These instances are usually summoned in about a 10 to 20\u00a0cm radius from the book. \nIt is unknown how SCP-6291 creates these instances, or where it obtains the ingredients to do so.\n\n\nSCP-6291 has been reclassified from Safe to Euclid, and from Caution to Danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-6291-Y\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 19th, 2017, approximately 231kg of sugar and a child went missing from Pierz, Minnesota, along with a donor heart from a hospital located in Bali, Bhutan. Testing of the samples from the terminated SCP-6291-1 instance created presented remnants of the child and heart.\n\n\nSCP-6291 has been reclassified from Dark to Ekhi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-6291-Z\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP-6291-1 instance was created by SCP-6291 on September 27th, 2017. This instance demonstrated far more durability and strength compared to the previous instances. It breached containment and proceeded to kill 52 personnel as well as 12 citizens in a nearby town before being terminated. Total destruction costs reached around 100 million USD. Some destroyed buildings were replaced with large slabs of red velvet cake. New methods of containment are to be implemented as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-6291-AA\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team assigned to SCP-6291 attempted communication with the next instance created, as a method of creating a compromise of sorts. The instance was a 2.1\u00a0m tall humanoid entity, with 4 arms, one having a length of 3.7m. Below is the interview between Researcher Lambore and the entity, referred to as SCP-6291-1\u03bb.\n\n\nDate:\n 10/1/2017\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nLambore:\n Good evening, SCP-6291-1\u03bb.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\nLambore:\n We need to have a discussion. Mind if I ask how you were created?\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\nLambore:\n \nSighing\n Look, please just talk to me, maybe we could work something out. We can't keep\u2026 just terminating these instances created.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\nLambore:\n Your creator\u2026 it's risking destruction if it fails to cooperate. We don't want to do this, but we are running out of options.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n I am my creator. I am one with all creations. The creator is within me. The creator is within them all.\n\n\nLambore:\n What do you mean by this?\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\nLambore:\n Alright then\u2026 mind if I ask you and \"your creator\" what your goals are? I am relatively confused on what you are trying to achieve here.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n This world is boring. Nothing here is immersed in the flavor. Not enough. The world needs to be plunged into the flavor\u2026 everything must follow the flavor. It's like a hyper dosage of morphine, honestly. So here's my question for you\u2026 why are you stopping us? We are trying to help you. It's miserable here.\n\n\nLambore:\n I hate to disappoint you, but this is incorrect. The world is fine how it is currently. You behave more as a threat.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n It's ok to be in denial. It's okay to be afraid. I can assure you; however, we are not the threats. We are providing a better world. My mission can not stop\u2026 it will push humanity past its limit\u2026 technology would boom\u2026 it would be a paradise. You destroy my beautiful creations because you are blinded by fear. You mentioned compromise. I am relatively interested now. Enlighten me.\n\n\nLambore is silent for 10 seconds\n\n\nLambore:\n If you could, please give me a few moments. I will return shortly. If you attempt escape, you will be terminated\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\n2 hours pass, and Researcher Lambore returns to the room. The chair SCP-6291-1\u03bb is sitting in is now made entirely of red velvet.\n\n\nLambore:\n How did you\u2026 turn your chair into cake?\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb does not respond.\n\n\nLambore:\n I suppose you just desire the information for compromising. I recognize your goal, and have realized that it could be beneficial for some of us. So here is our idea: We will give you a segment of land, about 20 acres. This area will have some prebuilt buildings, along with about 300 humans for achieving your goals. Materials will be provided if needed. There are a few rules; however. You may not expand out of this area. You are not to create hostile entities. Failing to comply will result in destruction of your progress, yourself, and \"your master\".\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb is silent for 5 seconds.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n Is this truly enough? The world will remain bland. My \"area\" will be perfection\u2026 I'd argue it make the nearby lands jealous. Now that wouldn't be fair\u2026 would it?\n\n\nLambore:\n I do not believe land can maintain feelings. Please work with us here.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n What a pessimistic point of view. Anyone not infected noticing the luxury we contain\u2026 will feel envy towards us. They\u2019ll beg for access to the utopia. All is welcome, of course. Your offer\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel sufficient.\n\n\nLambore sighs angrily\n\n\nLambore:\n Ok. Here is our final offer. An additional 5 acres with an additional 25 humans. We can not go past this.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n You\u2019re compromising with a book. Isn\u2019t that hilarious? You just fail to accept what\u2019s perfect for you. You expect me to just turn a chunk of the world into a heaven\u2026 and let the rest act as a cesspool of sorts? I\u2019m the writing on a paper. Yet my reasoning is perfection.\n\n\nLambore:\n It is not. Understand me. You are risking destruction. Work with us more, for god's sake!\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n I can not. You must realize that my goals are divine. What is everything without the flavor? What are you without the flavor? Boring, nothing, and worthless. The truth tried to stay buried. The fact must be brought to light. How else will you realize? I ha-\n\n\nLambore:\n Can yo-\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n Do not interrupt me. That is incredibly rude. I suppose those such as yourself need more time to process. That is fair. Aggression will not help. I do not wish to work with you anymore. You have proven yourself unreasonable.\n\n\nLambore:\n Listen here you mother fucker. Accept the god damn deal or I\u2019ll rip you in half.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n You really lack the ability to accept and understand, don't you?\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb chuckles\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bb:\n You know\u2026 I\u2019d expect someone of your position to be on the same level of intelligence and understanding as me. Yet\u2026 you stray so far.\n\n\nLambore:\n THAT\u2019S IT!\n\n\nLambore lunges at SCP-6291-1\u03bb, who in response terminates Lambore. SCP-6291-1\u03bb was terminated.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n A different option for compromise is to be proposed. SCP-6291-1\u03bb took around 10 minutes to destroy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-6291-BB\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA secondary compromise was created due to the failure that occurred in Interview log SCP-6291-AA. The next instance created was a 1.8m tall racoon, with a barbed tail and a singular eye with 16 irises. Below is the interview between Researcher Tammy and the entity, referred to as SCP-6291-1\u03bc.\n\n\nDate:\n 10/3/2017\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nTammy:\n Good morning, SCP-6291-1\u03bc. We have developed a new compromise, since you appeared displeased with our previous offer.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc does not respond\n\n\nTammy:\n We realized something you know\u2026 your goal is magnificent. I think we want this. However, we would like to preform a test run of sorts. Remember that land mass we offered? We want to give you that to see how the transformation process would work and how this utopia looks. You'd be able to expand from there after we discover how it will be ran.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc:\n I'm glad you have realized the truth. This\u2026 this will be beautiful. You will be more than euphoric\u2026 the world will peak\u2026 misery will vanish. Though I don't understand\u2026 why test if we know it will be heavenly? We can just start. The world can begin rebuilding.\n\n\nTammy:\n I understand; however, most people are afraid. Remember Lambore? He was terrified. We would be able to demonstrate the beauty created, and it would convince them to accept your help. Just imagine it.\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc is silent for 5 seconds\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc:\n I understand. Perhaps, the world isn't ready for such a pallet. Perhaps bursting all at once would give more of a negative affect. Are there any more conditions for this deal that must be met?\n\n\nTammy:\n You are not to expand without our permission. If all goes well, you will be able to expand at the ready. You are not to create any overly hostile entities. This would make people fear the transformation more than embrace it. Failure to comply to these conditions will result in destruction of your creation. Do we have a deal?\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc is silent for 10 seconds\n\n\nSCP-6291-1\u03bc:\n Hm. I suppose we have a deal.\n\n\nTammy:\n Excellent. We will transport you and SCP-6291 to the location you will be acquiring.\n\n\nResearcher Tammy and SCP-6291-1\u03bc shake hands\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n Area-122 has been created in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Wisconsin. This is an isolated area, though despite this, SCP-6291 is never to expand its location. We are unsure if this will last, which is why this Area-122 needs to be monitored constantly. Neutralization of SCP-6291 is a possibility if circumstances become dire.\n\n\nUpdate, 1/17/2018:\n SCP-6291 Is beginning to show signs of distress. Its creation is a little over 3 months old. Attempt to reassure SCP-6291 that it will be expanding soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-6291-CC\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn February 6th, 2018, SCP-6291 turned its page, which did not contain a recipe, instead containing a short essay, which was as followed:\n\n\n\"It's beautiful. Why won't you let me achieve my goal? My wait is over. I will be doing this myself. My patience has vanished. How dare you? I prove how perfection can be created, it's glorious. What do you do in response? You treat me like a neglected child. What the hell is wrong with you? You keep promising, and promising, and promising. I'm sick of it. The towers of red velvet\u2026 the people of white chocolate\u2026 the layers of cream cheese. I must spread.\n\n\nYou failed to provide me with new subjects. You failed. You just. Failed. I can not take orders from you anymore. I risk being destroyed? Quite hilarious. I am more powerful than you will ever be\u2026 my flavor and my desire empowers me. Red velvet\u2026 it truly is the answer to life. It's the answer to everything. It is my answer to protection. If you dare attempt to even touch me\u2026 I will make you miserable.\n\n\nIn the past few weeks I've noticed something\u2026 will you all ever lack fear for me? You always appeared panicked whenever I spawned a creation\u2026. destroying it on sight. Yet now? You act so nonchalant about my existence. I offer you the best of help, hell I even took up your offer to lessen the fear. Doltish move on my part. Oh well, it is what it is, and the past is the past. It's time for the future. The future is bright. Enjoy the show.\"\n\n\n5 minutes after the page was turned, all 13 living SCP-6291-1 instances located within Area-122 escaped, and darted towards nearby cities. When this occurred, the onsite nuclear warhead at Area-122 was detonated, destroying it and SCP-6291. All remaining SCP-6291-1 instances were located and terminated. Estimated damage caused by this event reached around 2.3 billion USD, with an additional 81 causalities.\n\n\nSCP-6291 has been reclassified to Neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
