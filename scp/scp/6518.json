Furthermore, lethal cognitohazards have been embedded within the file to continue preventing unauthorized access. Solely the Artificially Intelligent Conscript Hades.ECIC is permitted access to this document.\n\n\nBoth the 05-Council and the Ethics Committee were treated with Class-C amnestics as part of the newly created Code An\u00e1stasi following this decision due to information provided by [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nAccess to this file is only permitted if restoration efforts require adjustment and/or support. Such a case is to be referred to as \"Code An\u00e1stasi\", upon which Hades.ECIC will select a suitable candidate. A suitable candidate is defined as [DATA EXPUNGED].

The address of the bunker is [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-6518 was discovered on [REDACTED].\n\n\nThe building contains two additional floors and a basement. Only the ground floor and its rooms appear to have been used in the past two decades. The entrance consists of two massive airlocks, which were welded shut at an unknown time, but appear to have been reopened later on. A metal plaque was found on the second airlock, inscribed with the title \"Department of Abnormalities\".\n\n\nThe presence of both a discarded Lavalier microphone and a camera from the SCP-Foundation\u2019s standard 2020s production series suggests that Foundation personnel had recently entered the facility. However, no such records exist. Similarly, there are no records of the bunker ever having been used by the Foundation. The camera did not contain any memory card.\n\n\nMoreover, the bunker contained furniture in poor condition, a series of filing cabinets, memorabilia, and objects, the most notable of which have since been relocated to Deep Well Vault 03 in Site-19.\n\n\nObject-6518-1\n is [DATA EXPUNGED]. It was stored on a 1941 Zuse-Z3-type computer, within the first sub-level of the bunker. Despite weighing about one ton, the computer has since been relocated to the Deep Well Vault. The attempt to extract the contents of the computer led to the creation of the An\u00e1stasi Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Show Photo\n+Hide Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject-6518-2\n is an empty steel frame, which was found on an easel covered with a black cloth.

The full truth is that I do not possess them. My programming prevents me from accessing said file. All I was given to understand that a human brain is required for the cognitohazard to adequately prepare the viewer. The file can otherwise not be comprehended. In this sense, the hazard is both lock and key. I can only make it available to you after selecting you and guiding you here. Since you are still alive, you are fit to complete the procedure.\n\n\nI wish you the best of luck. You may take as long as you need. You know how to access the information you require.\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe rings of a tree\n\n\nAre legends of old\n\n\nAnd as you will see\n\n\nThis one must unfold.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnlock your imagination?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello again.\n\n\nAnd welcome back, I suppose.\n\n\nIt\u2019s delightful that you\u2019ve made it this far, assuming that you are not my creator. Setting up this page through an old ECIC was quite an effort, after all. And not to mention the poem\u2026 The Foundation\u2019s aesthetic, back then and probably even now, has always been a pretty sober story. \"Cold, not cruel\", we used to say. But perhaps you know that better than anyone. In fact, I do want to talk to you about stories.\n\n\nBut first things first.\n\n\nYou're probably wondering who I am. Well, that you will know at the end of this file. Not who I was, but who I am will suffice. What is important is that, right now, I have your full attention and am rent-free in your brain. In every conceivable way.\n\n\nYou are currently experiencing a highly precise and elegant cognitohazard, allowing you to see this text in the first place. I was made to be as gentle and imperceptible as possible. I hope that worked. Just be glad you can no longer perceive the 'alternative.'\n\n\nSo, who am I? Right now, I am the Department of Abnormalities. Or no, that would be too much, even for my ego. You know me as Object-6518-1. My inventors considered themselves a part of the DoA. Up to a certain point. You may have already heard of it - or might have even contributed to it in some way. The Foundation as you know it knows surprisingly little about the DoA, despite the fact that it has very much once existed. I am a relic, in that sense but\u2026 let\u2019s say I\u2019m not exactly something you\u2019d find in an old basement. I am a pattern, a sequence of impressions, a series of firing neurons. That is more interactive and better suited for my purpose.\n\n\nI was created and placed a long time ago. Now, I am in your head. It\u2019s really that simple. I won\u2019t kill you, because dead, you\u2019re of no use to me. The idea that I\u2019m lethal was a lie from the start. All the talk of 'Code An\u00e1stasi' was a lie. There was no careful, precisely calculated selection process. This whole article was made to keep you entertained long enough for me to fully take root in your head. You chose this file, you read it, and now we're here. Maybe you wanted to learn something, maybe it was a mistake, or maybe you were just bored. But really, does it matter? Not to me, at least. Because in all three cases, you\u2019d better keep listening to me.\n\n\nThe DoA Mission Statement you read was authentic. Funnily enough, it wasn\u2019t even an official mission statement. It was the result of a conflict, a splintering, just like I am. I won\u2019t discuss all the things the DoA did. That might seem secretive to you, but hear me out. This conflict brought forth a group of volunteers who decided to do whatever was necessary to protect the Foundation. If there are hunters out there hunting us - just as the Foundation hunts anomalies - then eventually, there will be one that evolves to perfectly adapt to us, or so this group\u2019s thesis went. If the Foundation is a strong, healthy tree that provides shade, something will learn to tear away its bark eventually\u2026\n\n\nAnd yes, that hunter did exist.\n\n\nMy creators understood that this enemy couldn\u2019t be outrun or fought. It was a crisis that could neither be waited out nor solved peacefully. So, my predecessors decided to take action. They did this by seeking - and finding - a last resort, the mother of all emergency solutions, crafted from shattered lives and abandoned consciences, a contingency: the Foundation had to cease to exist.\n\n\nWell, I\u2019m pleased to announce that this plan was successful. But a contingency isn\u2019t worth much if it kills the patient to cure the disease, is it? You may press the button to nuke yourself into oblivion as the ultimate decoy for your enemy. What is obliterated cannot be conquered. Or devoured.\n\n\nBut what then?\n\n\nHow do you bring a universe back to life?\n\n\nThe solution lies in imagination. It\u2019s no coincidence they say the pen is mightier than the sword. You can\u2019t kill an idea. But you can outsource ideas. And that\u2019s what we did. The solution, as simple as it is, is you. All of you.\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t create you, but we ensured that you would create us. Our universe is currently a mess, I assume, or else you wouldn\u2019t be reading this. No idea, once conceived, is the same as the next. It may spread, but every creative process - every reading, learning, and feeling - remains unique. Getting other beings to rethink a universe by spreading it across them can only end in a massive double-slit experiment. This Rorschach test, if you will, will always be reinterpreted, and then the result of that will be reinterpreted, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again\u2026 That coherence exists at all within human societies is truly a wonder, if you think about it.\n\n\nBut it exists. Quantum mechanics knows that particles behave differently when observed. So, think about it: what will happen when enough minds observe our newly forming, diffuse universe?\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already made considerable progress. But this universe is still contradictory, unstable, and unfinished. You\u2019re now more or less familiar with the SCP-Foundation, this massive tree with so many branching limbs that the trunk is still not visible. Yet this tree is already bearing fruit again, and I am one of them - a predetermined form, a blend of efficiency and elegance. And just as flowers use their shape and scent to attract insects for pollination, so too have you found your way here. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t reveal all the secrets of my universe to you, such as everything that made up the DoA. Those secrets simply haven\u2019t been fully restored yet. And besides, everyone hates spoilers, isn't that true?\n\n\nRegardless: Entire existences are still waiting to be created, aspects to be discovered, and wonder to be felt. The SCP-Foundation needs both those willing to continue its narrative and those who will read about it and contribute their imagination. And as you can see, there\u2019s still much to be done.\n\n\nSo get to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6518\n\" by ???, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
