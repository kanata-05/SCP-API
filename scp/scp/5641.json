Several inconsistencies have been included in the drawing to prevent any accidental discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5641\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5641\u2019s specific location has been forgotten. Its structure has been concealed behind a protective dome stylized like a house of the area. Three copies have been built alongside the dome, each guarded by a stationary patrol.\n\n\nThe specific location is safeguarded through its semantic decomposition into three parts, each part known to the following people:\n\n\n\n\nThe current Director of Site-36\n\n\nThe current General Secretary of GoI-1984 (\u201cThe House of the Naga\u201d)\n\n\nAn undisclosed third party\n\n\n\n\nInteraction with SCP-5641 and any of its parts has been suspended indefinitely.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5641 is a stupa\n1\n located somewhere within India, dated to the 6th century BCE\n2\n. The stupa presents an infohazard involving the knowledge of the stupa\u2019s location, with anyone knowing it suffering at least one of the following symptoms\n3\n:\n\n\n\n\nHearing chants in Pali\n4\n that pray to Ardhanarishvara\n5\n. The chants are believed to grow in intensity the longer one stays away from SCP-5641.\n\n\nDreaming of seven humanoid figures, believed to represent the Saptarishi\n6\n.\n\n\nA constant taste and smell of blood, diminishing all other flavors and smells sensed by the subject. High salivary calcium levels.\n\n\nA constricting feeling in one's chest, described as 'feeling like they've been chained up.'\n\n\nHearing a set of steps neither close nor far from one\u2019s position. Subjects believe they \u2018don\u2019t follow after you, but are accompanying you.\u2019\n\n\nThe sensation of wind and fingers running through one\u2019s hair.\n\n\nFeelings of restlessness and dysphoria, either accompanied or caused by an extreme urge to visit and stay within SCP-5641, under the belief that the subject\u2019s \u2018not where they should be.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nThese symptoms will vanish once the memory of the location of SCP-5641 is removed from the subject, with amnestics being effective against these 100% of the time. If these symptoms are allowed to continue without amnestic usage, the person will walk into, be led into, or be teleported into SCP-5641, with their retrieval becoming impossible, impractical or detrimental. Both means and reasoning behind this have been purposefully forgotten.\n\n\nThe interior of the stupa contains several elements that cause similar symptoms to the ones mentioned earlier, and are triggered by a similar cognitohazard. Due to this, only the most basic descriptors have been allowed to remain:\n\n\n\n\nA reliquary positioned in the middle of the stupa\n\n\nIts contents\n\n\nA number of monks\n\n\nThe path they circumambulate\n\n\nThe hymns and prayers they sing\n\n\nThe ritual they perform\n\n\nThe reason behind it\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n Knowledge of the ruins and its effects were forwarded to the Foundation by agents of GoI-1984 (\u201cThe House of the Naga\u201d)\n7\n in 1961 after its effects were realized, with at least 2 of its members entering SCP-5641. Foundation attempted more than one containment procedure, with the protective dome and its copies having been built by 1977. It is known that amnestic usage was attempted since 1963, but wasn\u2019t effective until the mid 90s, when \nparachemical developments\n allowed for amnestic drugs to be able to fully eliminate memories of SCP-5641.\n\n\nNo more information was obtained about the anomaly until 1987 when an unrelated research team inside the \nWanderers\u2019 Library\n discovered the remains of a journal by an unknown explorer who visited SCP-5641 at some point during the Anglo-Maratha War period (1775-1819). Due to the nature of its content, the document has been sealed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ DATA LOCKED\nLock overridden. Welcome, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-5641.1:\n Journal transcript\n\n\n\n\nTarakasura, son of vajranaka, he who plotted against the Devas\n\n\nHeaven was brought down to Earth as the Asura\u2019s wrath raged on\n\n\nTarakasura, son of vajrangini, he who had no weakness\n\n\nTore Heaven into two, and brought it to Patala.\n\n\nFourteen lokas turn into three, Tarakasura\u2019s triumph\n\n\nHe stood above the Deva, he stood above all\n\n\nUnmatched, he gave birth to seven sons, the Saptarasura\n\n\nWho would continue on his legacy, and bring victory to the Asurakind.\n\n\nLike their father, the seven sons performed the most complex tapasya\n\n\nLike their father, Lord Brahma was pleased and granted them a boon\n\n\nLike their father, they asked for immortality, and power, and thus\n\n\nLike their father, the boon was granted to them.\n\n\nA thousand hundred thousand years they ruled\n\n\nEvery being their vessel, every being their subject\n\n\nBut a thousand more years they wouldn\u2019t get to see\n\n\nFor Parvati, the Mother Goddess, had a plan.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThis chant hasn\u2019t stopped. Ever since my return from Delhi, the chant has not stopped. Neither have the steps I hear every so often. I have seeked help from many doctors and mediums, but there is no answer to be found. It\u2019s not delirium, and it\u2019s not witchcraft.\n\n\nPerhaps my peers at the Museum will have the answers I seek.\n\n\n\n\nThe Museum has no answers for me, so I have decided to visit the Asiatick Society of Bengal, in Calcutta. They\u2019re a group who collect and study the manuscripts of the area, and might have more information into the verses that resound inside my head.\n\n\nSpeaking of the verses, I have begun visualizing who is singing them. A woman, I believe, standing on a threshold. When I sleep, I see her vague figure, only her black eyes a clear shape burnt into my head.\n\n\n\n\nTarakasura and his progeny had asked of Lord Brahma immortality and power\n\n\nNone could be as strong as them, none could be wiser\n\n\nAs for their immortality, only the son of Shiva could end\n\n\nShiva, the Mahadeva, who a vow of marriage would never take.\n\n\nBut Parvati, in aid of the Devas, asked Shiva in marriage\n\n\nParvati was rejected, yet her resolve refused to waver\n\n\nWith time, with effort, Shiva and Parvati joined in marriage\n\n\nThe Prakrti and Purusha, to whom Skanda is soon born.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe chants continued on my trip to Calcutta. The image of the woman became clearer: A priestess, standing at the entrance of a dome. I have seen these domes before, along the road between Surat and Poona. This is the birthplace of my curse, I know it.\n\n\nAs for the Society, I met with them. Lovely fellows, offered me a plethora of texts, both translated and yet to be. I explained my situation, and were perplexed. While they couldn\u2019t help me, they informed me that the hymns I speak of contain information from several Vedas and Puranas, regarding the Asura Tarakasura, who defeated the Devas, but was eventually defeated by Shiva and Parvati\u2019s son, Skanda, who was known as a deity of warfare.\n\n\nI cannot claim to know much about the Hindu religion, but this doesn\u2019t feel right. Something they\u2019ve told me isn\u2019t true. Perhaps the chants I hear are from another interpretation of these poems, as a member told me they\u2019re somewhat inconsistent. It seems in the texts Tarakasura had only three sons, the Tripurasura. They also didn\u2019t reign for long: Skanda killed Tarakasura and submitted his two brothers, who I have not heard of. Meanwhile, the Tripurasura were defeated by Shiva, who burned their forts, and sent their believers into the desert.\n\n\nIs the woman I see in my dreams one of these believers? Is she Parvati? One of the missing four asuras? As her stare burns into my retina every time I close my eyes, I know there is only one way to find out.\n\n\nI depart in two days.\n\n\n\n\nSkanda, the son of Shiva and Parvati, wielded the Vel\n\n\nThe divine spear, once vanquished the Asura Surapadma\n\n\nSkanda, the son of Shiva and Parvati, confronted Tarakasura\n\n\nVictorious Vel, courageous Vel, split Tarakasura in seven pieces.\n\n\nEach piece Skanda took, and with each piece a powerful weapon he forged\n\n\nSkanda mounted his peacock, and raised his flag, and marched towards the seven cities\n\n\nThe Saptarasura, fearing their end, combined their forces into a single being\n\n\nThe Saptarasura, fearing for their lives, molded the seven cities into one.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe chants continue, but it does not matter. I see the stupas in the distance, shadows against the bright moon at night. I have set up camp, but I will not sleep. As soon as the day breaks, I will walk up to her. Will she relieve me of these delusions?\n\n\n\n\nThe journal contains several contradictions, not only regarding all known vedic literature, but also regarding SCP-5641\u2019s known description. Due to these discrepancies, an investigation of the anomaly and possible interview of any inhabitant was planned. However, due to the infohazard risk tied to SCP-5641, this investigation was suspended indefinitely.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ DATA EXPUNGED\nLock overridden. Welcome, Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-5641.2:\n Interview\n\n\nFollowing the discovery of the journal, an investigation into SCP-5641 was proposed. While the risk of losing personnel to the construct was considered, a volunteer from GoI-1984 (\u201cThe House of the Naga\u201d) was selected for the interview. They were not informed of SCP-5641\u2019s infohazardous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Vashistha\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe camera is turned on a few meters away from SCP-5641. Dr. Vashistha steps inside, moving a red and golden toran to enter. The inside of the stupa contained only an altar-like structure where a small clay reliquary is positioned. Six people circumambulate around the altar, chanting in an unknown language\n8\n, failing to notice Vashistha. The six people are a woman dressed in a gharara outfit, a man wearing a bush jacket, two men in the uniforms of Indian police, and two people wearing Foundation Site-36 Research Area uniform. These 6 individuals will be referred to as 5641-1 through 6, respectively.\n)\n\n\nVashistha:\n (\nKnocks on the door\u2019s frame, attempting to attract the monks\u2019 attention\n) Excuse me.\n\n\n(\n5641-1 turns to the man, and stops her singing. She steps away from the group, who continues chanting. She sits in the Bhadrasana pose, extending a hand towards Vashistha.\n)\n\n\n5641-1:\n You\u2019re excused. You\u2019re welcomed. (\nPoints towards the ground in front of her.\n) Please, take a seat.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Of course.\n\n\n(\nVashistha sits down in the Bhadrasana pose.\n)\n\n\n5641-1:\n We\u2019ve been waiting for you.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Is that so?\n\n\n5641-1:\n Of course. As you have felt that this is the destination you should reach, we too have felt that a new face would join our prayers.\n\n\nVashistha:\n \u2026 I see. Well, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not here to join you in your prayers. I\u2019ve come here to ask questions.\n\n\n5641-1:\n As everyone does. I have come here to answer your questions, so ask.\n\n\nVashistha:\n For starters, what is this place?\n\n\n5641-1:\n It\u2019s a stupa. A place of worship, where the \nsarira\n rests. But you already know this.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Of course I know what a stupa is. That was not what my question meant.\n\n\n5641-1:\n There is nothing special about the place we\u2019re in. It is no different from the many stupas that existed before. From the ones that exist now. From the ones that will exist.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What do you do here, then?\n\n\n5641-1:\n We pray. I believe this was evident enough.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What do you pray for?\n\n\n5641-1:\n We pray in remembrance of the victories of the past. We pray to ensure the victories of the future. This, you know already, no?\n\n\nVashistha:\n I\u2026 Yes, I do. The chants are difficult to ignore, I must say.\n\n\n5641-1:\n Do you understand what the chants say?\n\n\nVashistha:\n Of course I do.\n\n\n5641-1:\n If you do, then why ask what it is that we do here? Why ask questions you already know the answer to?\n\n\nVashistha:\n I\u2026 I\u2019m uncertain. The truth evades me. Everytime I open my mouth, only noise comes out. My thoughts are scrambled, my eyes shoot in every direction. I cannot focus on what\u2019s in front of me.\n\n\n5641-1:\n That, Vashistha, is \nasat\n: Distortion. You walk a path without looking at the stars. You swim in \nanrita\n, away from the truth. You need to clear your thoughts, and understand why the victory must be remembered. Why what we do is important. Why has it continued on for so long.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What must I do to understand?\n\n\n5641-1:\n You must ask the right questions.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What are the right questions?\n\n\n5641-1:\n I cannot answer that. Only you know what the right questions are. If you do not, then you must leave. Return when you know them.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Very well. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\n\n\n(\nVashistha gets up, before leaving the stupa.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDr. Vashistha was not cleared for egressing without first carrying out the interview provided by the Foundation. Furthermore, despite the video clearly showing he stepped out, there is no proof that he ever did so.\n\nFollowing this log, several other interviews took place at the location.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Vashistha\n\n\n\n\n(\nBy the time the interview starts, Dr. Vashistha is already sitting in front of 5641-1.\n)\n\n\nVashistha:\n I cannot help but notice that we are seven. Seven is a number I keep hearing inside my head. What is its importance?\n\n\n5641-1:\n Seven is an important number no matter where you stand. A reading man might be able to tell you of the Seven days it took to build the world. Another might tell you of the Seven seals keeping the apocalypse at bay. I will tell you of the Seven Sages who maintain \nBrahman\n9\n and \nMaya\n10\n in their righteous places, such that we can be our own Selves, and nothing less.\n\n\nVashistha:\n \u2026 Are we the Seven Sages? Is that what you are trying to tell me?\n\n\n5641-1:\n No, no we are not, but we could be. I only see six people praying for Skanda\u2019s success. Only six who know the truth.\n\n\nVashistha:\n \u2026 You want me to join you.\n\n\n5641-1:\n Incorrect yet again. You want to join us. Why else would you volunteer to come here?\n\n\nVashistha:\n Wait, how- How do you-\n\n\n5641-1:\n How do I know? I told you I am here to answer questions. It would be expected, one would think, that I would have the knowledge to answer them, no?\n\n\nVashistha:\n (\nRubs temples\n) \u2026 Alright, so the Seven Sages sing prayers to Skanda, the son of Shiva and Parvati, because he\u2019s triumphed over the Saptarasura. He\u2019s defeated evil using the seven astras forged using Tarakasura\u2019s body. Everything correct so far?\n\n\n5641-1:\n Indeed.\n\n\nVashistha:\n The \nsarira\n inside the reliquary you pray around\u2026 What is it? The remains of the people who came before you?\n\n\n5641-1:\n I assume so, yes.\n\n\nVashistha:\n You assume?\n\n\n5641-1:\n It cannot be known. To know is to admit defeat.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Defeat?\n\n\n5641-1:\n If we are to maintain \nBrahman\n and \nMaya\n in their rightful place, then that which is unknowable must remain unknowable. Do you know why?\n\n\nVashistha:\n I- I do not.\n\n\n5641-1:\n Then we\u2019ve performed faithfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Vashistha\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe scene remains the same, but 5641-2 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.\n)\n\n\n5641-2:\n That which is unknowable must remain unknowable, yet that does not mean what is adjacent to it must remain unknown.\n\n\nVashistha:\n How so?\n\n\n5641-2:\n I will tell you a story, Vashistha. One you must hear. Are you listening?\n\n\nVashistha:\n I am.\n\n\n5641-2:\n Skanda fought the Saptarasura, and defeated them. This is what we chant of. However, the battle wasn\u2019t an easy fight, nor a simple affair. The Saptarasura had many allies, and many powers, and many boons. They were invincible, as far as any other being knew. This is why Tarakasura\u2019s body was used as a weapon. If he was invincible, the astras made would be equally powerful. The Saptarasura knew they had no chance, so they formed together into a great Asura King, one who went onto rule the universe just like the parts that composed him. He had no name, because no one could utter it. He reeked of scarlet blood, the sacred liquid constantly pouring out his mouth and eyes and ears. He was covered in gold and bronze and all precious metals that composed the seven cities each Saptarasura had built, who he now had fused into a single fort in the shape of a throne, where he sat on and oversaw all the universe from.\n\n\nNow, as I describe this being, you may think there is no feasible way Skanda would have defeated him, and you would be right. He didn\u2019t.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Wait, but the prayers-\n\n\n5641-2:\n Skanda was strong enough to defeat the Saptarasura, but not the King they\u2019d formed, nor their forts, nor their legions, nor their astras, so he asked for help. He was assisted by many Devas, including his own parents. But even that was not enough.\n\n\nVashistha:\n So?\n\n\n5641-2:\n What can you do to an enemy that cannot, nor will ever be defeated?\n\n\nVashistha:\n (\nOpens his mouth to answer, but nothing comes out.\n)\n\n\n5641-2:\n You stall them, indefinitely, through any means possible.\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe scene remains the same, but 5641-3 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.\n)\n\n\nVashistha:\n So the prayers are to stall the Saptarasura.\n\n\n5641-3:\n Indeed, and yet the truth isn\u2019t as easy. We\u2019re stalling a seventh part of the Saptarasura.\n\n\nVashistha:\n A seventh?\n\n\n5641-3:\n When Skanda planned to defeat the Asura King, he first had to get to him. To get to him, he first had to get rid of \nhis many followers.\n These were all the Asura and the Yaksha and the Rakshasa and the Kumbhanda and all who decided to follow him, because the King had offered them power like none other: Freedom. And they used this freedom to enslave, and to wage war, and to inflict pain and misery upon all others. And thus a dark age besieged the world, and the King thrived.\n\n\nVashistha:\n How were they defeated?\n\n\n5641-3:\n Skanda asked Lord Brahma to grant him the boon that would conquer his followers, and after ten thousand thousand years of meditation, it was granted to him: The sacred texts that contained all knowledge yet to be. Skanda presented it to the King\u2019s followers, and told them all answers were contained within. Curious, they peaked in, and saw a future of dominion; one of everlasting conquest. They cheered and they feasted and their happiness was unlike any other.\n\n\nSkanda turned to Lord Brahma and asked him \u201cI see the men and women of the Asura King whose name cannot be said and cannot be heard feasting, fulfilled in both body and mind. How can you say, Lord Brahma, that this is a weapon to defeat them?\u201d\n\n\nAnd Lord Brahma smiled, and explained that for all history that must be remembered is considered \nSmriti\n, and is kept within one\u2019s heart and one\u2019s mind, but the texts given to the followers were \nAsmriti\n, which is the texts to be forgotten, and are thrown out of one\u2019s heart and one\u2019s mind, never to pollute the universe again.\n\n\nAnd as he explained, Skanda saw that the followers, who were warriors and workers and architects and poets all fell to the ground, and melted into clay, leaving their clothes and weapons and slaves behind, who now free, praised to Skanda and Lord Brahma who both had saved them from their chains.\n\n\nAll left of the followers was the \nAsmriti\n, with now empty pages, and the men who were enslaved took it and hid it, for the Asmriti\u2019s content must not be remembered, else the followers will return and they will enslave and wage war and mock the Devas again.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Is this book what is kept here?\n\n\n5641-3:\n The book is not the part contained here. The book is lost to all, I hope, and should remain as such.\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe scene remains the same, but 5641-4 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.\n)\n\n\n5641-4:\n Skanda kept on his path, and was confronted by seven women: The seven wives of the seven Saptarasura. They stood over the followers, and made sure to both ensure their compliance, and bring all their gifts to their husbands. Without the followers, there was no compliance to be had, and no gifts to receive. The seven wives were enraged by this, and confronted Skanda.\n\n\nThese seven wives were powerful Asuri, capable of bending clay and blood and life, and using these they created plants that poured not \nsoma\n but \nhalahala\n, and a single drop of it could corrupt all life it touched. What seemed to surely be a battle soon turned to a peace agreement, however. Skanda asked the Asuri why they were, amidst the ruins of their now-gone empire instead of next to the golden throne of the Asura King. And why were they fighting him instead of the Asura King, and they understood that he cared not for them anymore, if ever.\n\n\nSkanda thus stopped his mission, and attempted to find husbands for the Asuri. It took several hundred years, but the wisest and most forgiving of all men stepped forward, and promised they would ensure their safety and fight for them. These men are now known as the Saptarishi, the Seven Sages.\n\n\nSkanda brought Agni who ignited a great pyre, who they all danced around, praying for each other\u2019s health and to survive the King\u2019s ordeal, and to have healthy children who will live better lives. Thus was born the Saat phere ceremony, and the Saptapadi, and all marriages included them from that point on. And the seven wives attained enlightenment, and their poison turned into \namrita\n, and with a single touch, the land was blessed with mango trees and jasmines and even the lotus flower began to flourish where only bloodshed had flourished before.\n\n\nVashistha:\n So the Asuri are the Seven Sages\u2019 wives? Our wives?\n\n\n5641-4:\n The truth isn\u2019t as simple. Yes, they once were, but not anymore. After many years, they discovered that the seed of the Saptarasura remained within the Asuri long after their consummation; long after their defeat even. The Asuri are cursed to bear the next generation of Asura, who will be stronger than they ever were, and will have no weaknesses, not to any man nor to any Deva.\n\n\nAs such, the Devas and the Saptarishi had to make sure these children would never be born, and the seven wives were sealed away. They will never understand the happiness of giving birth, for they cannot be allowed to, and will never see Agni\u2019s light again, for their children will steal it, and sink the world into a darkness there's no return from. Where they are now, we cannot know. I pray that wherever they are, they are safe from the influence of the Asura King.\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe scene remains the same, but 5641-5 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.\n)\n\n\n5641-5:\n After the followers and the wives had been dealt with, Skanda finally encountered the King. He was ten thousand times his strength, and ten trillion times his size. He knew all there was to know, and his seven mouths spoke profanities and his eyes killed all who saw into them. He had fourteen hands, and he knew all \nmudras\n and practiced all \npranayamas\n and controlled the seven winds known as \nvayu\n.\n\n\nSkanda knew he could not defeat the King, so he prayed to Lord Brahma again, asking for a different boon. He offered the seven astras of Tarakasura, and in turn Lord Brahma sent Tvashtr, who had forged Indra\u2019s \nvajra\n, and he took the astras, and transformed them into \nseven golden spears.\n And each spear Skanda wielded, and each spear was thrusted into the King, and the King screeched in pain as the spears absorbed each of the Saptarasura.\n\n\nSeven thrusts later and the Saptarasura was no more. Skanda knew this was not the end, for the spears slowly corroded, the gold falling off, leaving only ugly iron behind. The Saptarasura could not be as easily defeated, nor as easily sealed, for they had meditated to strengthen themselves during the time the spears were forged. The spears wanted to come together; the seals wanted to come undone.\n\n\nAs such, Skanda granted each spear to the seven most powerful warriors, who then left, to never meet again. The spears bled and thrashed and from time to time the Saptarasura would escape their cells, and the warriors would best them.\n\n\nIf we are to win this war, the spears must never meet again.\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe scene remains the same, but 5641-6 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.\n)\n\n\n5641-6:\n Skanda stood unopposed, but he knew this was not the end. Even if the followers had been forgotten, they could return. Even if the wives were sealed away, the seals could break. Even if the spears had been separated, they could reunite. This was because people remembered, and memories are \nBrahman.\n To best this, Skanda needed for them to become \nMaya\n, an illusion.\n\n\nFor this, he asked for Shiva to help him, and Shiva indeed offered his help. He took a single glance at the throne which had once been seven forts, and molded it into the image of a singular beast: The Asura King. And the beast would speak like the King, and move like the King, and all would \nbe made to believe that this was the King.\n\n\nAnd then it was sealed away, and many scholars would make sure that this Fake King would be found and feared and revered as the real King. This too would be a seal, for it would seal away the truth of the Asura King\u2019s existence.\n\n\n\n\nVashistha:\n First were the followers, second were the wives, third was the King, fourth was the decoy. What were the last three?\n\n\n5641-2:\n A pertinent question, but it seems you still are missing a point.\n\n\n5641-5:\n Tell me, do you really believe seven spears were enough to bring down the King?\n\n\nVashistha:\n Were they not?\n\n\n5641-4:\n His corporeal form, sure, but the \nsthula sarira\n11\n is merely one of three. Skanda still had the \nsukshma\n12\n and the \nkarana\n13\n to deal with.\n\n\nVashistha:\n How did he deal with them?\n\n\n5641-5:\n As soon as the decoy had been built, a strong howling was heard through the land, and all shivered: The voice of the King still remained, seven distinct tones morphed into a cacophony of pain and misery, singing of the darkest of evils, bringing fear and chaos even after his body had been stripped of all mortal power. The King without body smiled, and from a mouth that did not exist, blood poured.\n\n\nAnd the blood became a sea of obscenity that washed over the new world, and submerged it all in its miasma. The King used the knowledge of his defeat to strengthen even after death, and brought the same destruction that befell his followers and his kingdom unto men and Deva equally. Soon, there was no land to stand on, and many perished. The survivors were rescued by Vishnu, who took on the shape of a great fish, and took on the name of Matsya.\n\n\nSkanda stood by Matsya\u2019s side, and knew not what to do, so he asked for help. And Matsya provided, and help arrived in the shape of the few he rescued. These were the slaves the followers of the King had chained and tortured, and they had been promised kingdoms and riches beyond comprehension, and they would become the Kshatriya who would rule earth. But the slaves turned to Skanda, and offered to trade all that had been promised to them in exchange of stopping the King from taking the world over again.\n\n\nSkanda thus cursed the slaves, and the slaves would again be at the bottom, standing as the lowest of all castes. In doing so, however, the King\u2019s mind and rage and blood was forever locked inside their minds, and the seas subsided, and the King\u2019s form was defeated once more. Were he to ever return, he would \ncontrol nobody but those who stood at the bottom of it all\n, and they would be laughed at and mocked by all but Skanda, who knew they had committed the greatest of all sacrifices.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What about his True-Self?\n\n\n5641-1:\n Skanda thought there was nothing left of the King, but the Saptarishi warned him: Past body and mind there is still one\u2019s True-Self, directly attuned to the rest of the universe. As long as it existed, the King could return.\n\n\nOf course, the True-Self will always exist no matter what. It is part of Brahman, and stands ever-permanent. It was the one weakness in Skanda\u2019s plan: The King could not be banished, for he had existed, and would thus forever remain.\n\n\nBut the Saptarishi knew something that many others ignored: The existence of the King was devoid of Dharma, so he could not know of the truth of the True-Self. Another weapon was born out of this knowledge; another illusion.\n\n\nSkanda took the clay and the dirt and the broken weapons that littered the ground, and molded them into seven urns. \nThese seven urns, seven tribes took.\n These tribes kept them trapped in the past, so that the King would never see a future. As long as the tribes kept them intact, they would thrive. As long as the tribes kept them, the King would believe a part of him resided within, and thus would never attain his True-Self, for his ignorance acted as a trap in and of itself.\n\n\nThe tribes soon left, and Skanda smiled. He smiled, because the King was no more.\n\n\n\n\n5641-2:\n His legion fallen, his wives converted.\n\n\n5641-3:\n His body broken, his throne transformed.\n\n\n5641-4:\n His mind trapped, his True-Self unrealized.\n\n\n5641-5:\n Thus the King was defeated. Skanda stood victorious.\n\n\n5641-6:\n Now we sing of his glory, as we cheer for the past that was changed in our favor, for the present that we\u2019ve allowed others to enjoy, and for the future that is still within reach.\n\n\nVashistha:\n \u2026 That\u2019s six. You said there\u2019s seven parts.\n\n\n5641-1:\n There are seven indeed. We\u2019ve yet to mention the one we safeguard.\n\n\nVashistha:\n What is it? Which part do we safeguard?\n\n\n5641-2:\n This final question cannot be answered. It cannot be known. To know it is to invite him. To invite him is \nto face the end.\n This is the truth of the seventh seal. A seal shrouded in ignorance, because we know better. We \nmust\n know better.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Is this why we sing?\n\n\n5641-3:\n The chants are a seal, yes. We pray because Skanda has asked us to. We chant his name because he must be remembered. We sing of Saptarasura\u2019s defeat, because were we to stop, the world would forget it. And if the world forgets, then the King will return, because the King is ignorance, and the King is division, and the King is all the foul and the profane and yet he was defeated.\n\n\n5641-4:\n And yet, even in defeat he thrives. Even in death he lives. Even vanquished he conquers.\n\n\n5641-5:\n So we pray and as we pray the world remembers the triumph: A world of nature, and not of bloodshed. A world of pillars, and not of rubble. A world of freedom, and not of chains.\n\n\n5641-6:\n And so, all questions are answered, but one: Are you ready to pray?\n\n\nVashistha:\n Must I?\n\n\n5641-2:\n You are in no obligation to do it, but you must do it. The seal shall not be completed until the Seven Sages pray of Skanda\u2019s greatness in the battle with Saptarasura.\n\n\n5641-3:\n If you decline, then you will live your life, die, be reincarnated and, some day, we will meet again.\n\n\n5641-6:\n Your free will shan\u2019t be tainted. At the same time, however, you came here for a reason. You, and not your previous reincarnations, but \nyou.\n\n\nVashistha:\n Why me, and not them?\n\n\n5641-6:\n That we cannot answer. Only thou knows thyself.\n\n\nVashistha:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I want to leave my old life behind.\n\n\n5641-2:\n No one who\u2019s come here wanted to, at the beginning. To abandon it all for the sake of everyone else\u2026 That\u2019s a heavy sacrifice to make. It isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\n5641-3:\n But it\u2019s the right thing to do. It is our duty.\n\n\nVashistha:\n It\u2019ll be my duty too then.\n\n\n5641-6:\n Have you decided then?\n\n\nVashistha:\n There was no decision to make, was there? The moment I stepped in, I stepped in because I would join you all. I knew that I needed to be here. Now I know why. I understand my mission, and I accept it. This is my aim, my goal, my purpose. I am where I belong.\n\n\n5641-1:\n Welcome home, Vashistha.\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe log consists only of audio, with seven people praying to the sound of drums. The chants were translated from Classical Sanskrit.\n)\n\n\n5641-1:\n\n\nSkanda stood atop the ruins of profanity, and smiled, for the Saptarasura had fallen.\n\n\nYet Vishvamitra the Sage approached him, and told him this was far from the truth.\n\n\nThe Saptarasura\u2019s malice would never dull, for he was part of Brahman too.\n\n\nAnd Skanda cried, but Vishvamitra calmed him, for he knew the solution.\n\n\n5641-2:\n\n\nA stupa was built, where the King once sat upon his golden throne.\n\n\nA reliquary was crafted, and inside the last of the King was sealed.\n\n\nA prayer began, and a ritual commenced, so that the King would never find it.\n\n\nAnd Vishvamitra renounced to his kingdom, and simply sang, for in song he found life.\n\n\n5641-3:\n\n\nKingdoms rose, kingdoms fell. Time passed for all but the lone Sage.\n\n\nAs the Maratha and the men from the West waged meaningless wars, another joined.\n\n\nHis name, Atri, from the lands where the God Surya never settled down.\n\n\nTogether, they prayed. And the chants brought change to the land, and the Maratha left.\n\n\n5641-4:\n\n\nMany years were spent in prayer before the next sages joined them.\n\n\nTheir names were Jamadagni and Agastya, two men from the same land.\n\n\nJamadagini came in a time of crisis, a time of senseless brutality.\n\n\nFor the men of the West oppressed, and violented, and took everything for granted.\n\n\nJamadagni fought against Surya, who commanded the men of the West.\n\n\nSurya, who'd forgotten the King\u2019s rebellion, he who did not remember the law of blood.\n\n\nFalling into the same path, Jamadagni reminded Surya that war was not the way.\n\n\nAnd thanks to him, the men from the West retired, and at last men were free of their chains.\n\n\n5641-5:\n\n\nYet men still had chains inside their heads, and found reason to fight one against the other.\n\n\nOver insignificant materials; scarlet blings and golden baubles that brought rot within.\n\n\nAgainst this Agastya prayed, and reconciled the two groups, calm replacing war.\n\n\nAnd thus now four Sages prayed for Skanda\u2019s victory, his words heard once more.\n\n\nTwo more joined, coming from a distant place, the world of the exact and the concrete.\n\n\nAnd they came because they were curious, yet they were afraid, one feeding the other.\n\n\nTheir names, Maharishi and Bharadwaj, and they were wise men of science.\n\n\nThey knew it all, and yet they knew not the rituals of this land. Because of this, they feared.\n\n\n5641-6:\n\n\nThey feared Skanda, because he was a warrior, and war meant death, and death meant pest.\n\n\nBut they couldn\u2019t see that Skanda fought for the free; that he fought for them.\n\n\nThey needed reason to fear the ritual, and soon reason was born, and the King smiled.\n\n\nHe smiled because fear fed him. For the first time since his fall, he smiled.\n\n\nAnd in his smile hid pest, and in his smile hid death.\n\n\nAnd he smiled, and men fell ill, and men went crazy, and all lost faith.\n\n\nA single powerful act, and the Foundations cracked, and a seed of doubt was planted.\n\n\nThrough concrete the seed broke, and a tree of blood and bone and sinew sprouted.\n\n\nBut he could not smile for long, for Indra taught Bharadwaj medicine, and with this he prayed.\n\n\nSkanda\u2019s chants grew, and health befell the land, and the tree withered and died.\n\n\nAnd Indra taught Maharishi knowledge of light, and peace, and he shared it with many.\n\n\nAnd the stupa stood without the need for Foundations, and the King fell silent again.\n\n\n5641-7:\n\n\nThe last of the Sages was named Vashishta, and with him the seal was completed.\n\n\nHe joined the other six, and with his voice, he ensured the King would remain in place.\n\n\nSkanda smiled in truth then, and came to the stupa, and they all stopped and revered him.\n\n\nAnd their job was over, and Skanda thanked them all, and offered them a boon of his own.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnd the Seven Sages took it, and their souls joined the sky in the shape of seven stars.\n\n\nA new constellation in the shape of Skanda's smile. A smile, because the King was no more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this last log, chants were heard throughout several points in South, Central and East Asia, including several Sites and Areas of the Foundation and other Groups of Interest. Although unchecked, it is understood that the stupa disappeared from its position. Special containment procedures have been discontinued.\n\nA constellation\n of seven bright stars has retroactively joined many others, bearing the shape of a smile. No investigation of this incident has been nor will be conducted. The seal is expected to last.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5640\n | SCP-5641 | \nSCP-5642\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5641\n\" by Maxyfran73, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
