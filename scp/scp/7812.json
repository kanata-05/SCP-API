Despite the extreme nature of these procedures, they have shown to be the only bulwark against the expansion of SCP-7812 and thus, the Ethics Committee has unanimously approved the procedures.\n\n\nAlternative containment procedures are being researched and will be amended at such time as a less invasive measure can be found to contain the expansion of SCP-7812.\n\n\nAll attempts are to be made to either contain or neutralize SCP-7812-A, using whatever means necessary.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I am is saying is you\u2019d be dead if I hadn\u2019t shown up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your help, Marquez.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, because you didn\u2019t ask for help, I was supposed to leave you on that rooftop?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe was \nalready leaving when you showed up\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd if she hadn\u2019t, I would have stepped in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you step in a little earlier? Then maybe we could be free of this bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake up your mind, did you want me to help or not?\u201d\n\n\nRebekah Douglas stood from the cracked leather sofa she was sitting on and walked towards a window. She was still groggy from whatever the Daevite had done to her. They were in a dusty office building, overlooking an abandoned business park. Desks and chairs filled the hall outside, piled up on one another, pushed to the side to allow for some egress from the maze.\n\n\n\u201cWhere the hell did you bring me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the outskirts of Berlin. I own this building.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a slum lord?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been unused for a few years, thought it might be a good place to hole up while we figured out our next move.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just deliver me to the Foundation people that were right there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to kill the Matriarch, we can\u2019t bloody well do it with them looking over our shoulder.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah laughed and turned back to the anomalous man who had effectively kidnapped her.\n\n\n\u201cWe? We\u2019re going to kill the Matriarch. I thought you were working with Varga, made a deal with the Foundation and everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey want to contain her. Put her in a box somewhere and study her. I know all I need to about her and her people. Enough to know she needs to die. Do \nyou\n need to know more?\u201d\n\n\nRebekah looked down at her boots. She touched the athame lying on the couch next to where she had been.\n\n\n\u201cI know enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription\n:\n\n\nSCP-7812 is a colossal extrocorporeal infestation in an adjacent reality forming a metaphysical abscess bleeding through a punctum into this reality\u2019s no\u00f6sphere.\n1\n The breach point of SCP-7812 is centered around the area of the no\u00f6sphere provisionally classified as the \nfamis occulta\n.\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFehn cognitoscope in cross section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion of SCP-7812 has grown steadily ever since observation of the anomaly began.\n3\n The rate of expansion has slowed now that Foundation forces have begun containment operations, but not ceased entirely. The danger of SCP-7812\u2019s expansion is that it can theoretically consume and assimilate the conceptual human understanding of nourishment/consumption, including abstract derivations of the ideatic concept. Given the symptomology of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome, continuing expansion would have devastating effects on human society in unpredictable ways.\n\n\nA series of anomalous effects in baseline reality have been traced to SCP-7812:\n\n\n\n\nWidespread decrease in empathy presented in media \u2013 particularly a focus on psychopathic or villainous protagonists, often bordering on obsession with serial killers and true crime.\n\n\nRapid degradation of critical thinking concerning the legal and moral consequences of business practices on a societal level.\n\n\nCulebra-Simmons Syndrome [See below]\n\n\n\n\nDespite its discovery in early October 1993, no\u00f6spherical analysis has discovered that the anomaly first made contact with this reality in 1957 and has been expanding ever since. The first examples of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome had been present without Foundation knowledge since 1991, however.\n\n\nSCP-7812-A is the individual formerly known as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, patient zero and primary vector for Culebra-Simmons Syndrome, and a 31-year-old female former Foundation employee.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHold on, why the hell are you helping me?\u201d Rebekah asked. She opened a bottle of mineral water and took a swig. They had moved away from the office into a conference room Euboea had turned into a kitchen of sorts, with burner plate and minifridge.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a complicated subject.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe have time.\u201d\n\n\nEuboea sighed and sat at the conference table, folding his hands over his stomach.\n\n\n\u201cFor one thing, you seem to be the only one of your organization interested in killing her. Containment does not shield my people from harm. We need her gone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t many of your people \nworking with Varga now\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome, but that hardly changes anything. Anyone I have touched is her target, as you saw \nin the desert\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that. I fucked everything up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe Captain Zadeh would have died that day without your actions, it was a dangerous event.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m not letting myself off the hook that easy.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled sadly. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo why else?\u201d\n\n\nHe sighed again. \u201cI feel responsible for you, for your predicament.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened \nin that other world\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure my tinkering with your consciousness when we first met left your defenses down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, thanks again for that.\u201d\n\n\nHe was silent for a moment and went to the fridge to withdraw a plastic container with soup. He took out a pan and emptied the contents into it and started the burner. He began to stir the contents with a wooden spoon.\n\n\n\u201cWhy does the Matriarch have beef with you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeveral millennia ago, my Father destroyed her civilization. Or at least, provided a final stroke in the killing blow that history and various other power struggles had started. The Daevites were strong for a very long time, thousands of years really. But eventually, they began to weaken. Rebellions from the N\u00e4lk\u00e4n people, competing nation states, and honestly, they were an evolutionary dead end. They spent so much time preserving their life, they failed to innovate. You\u2019ve seen how she uses the same tactics in multiple conflicts? Overwhelm with numbers. That\u2019s what they did so often in the end. Slave armies made up of conquered peoples and thaumaturgic constructs. And that\u2019s what she tried when my Father created a stronghold in her territory.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe \ntower in Russia\n.\u201d\n\n\nHe stirred as he nodded. \u201cHer forces surprised us and ravaged the stronghold. All the work we had done there was lost.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLooked like a goddamn torture gallery.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, not torture. We were making new people, new life forms. Trying to elevate mankind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFucked up way to go about that. Making monsters.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t monsters, but it\u2019s not important enough to debate about. We wanted\u2026 well, he wanted to elevate men, to better survive the anomalous, the magical. Human beings are incredibly vulnerable and despite all the work the Foundation has done to hide away the horrors, this is still a very dangerous world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the details really, He didn\u2019t confide in me so much as order me around, but they are a wandering species. System to system, interfering with the natural order and seeding life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, it is literally an alien species.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, \u2018it\u2019 is. They all are. And it\u2019s hard to understand them, like so many advanced beings. But I can say this, they\u2019re fickle. They think the work is done and they move on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot your pops, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, He stayed. They left him and he stayed to oversee the development of life. Eventually, I think he became lonely or wanted a catspaw to interact with the apes, so he made me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike in a test tube?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, he took me from my tribe. This was nearly twenty thousand years ago, give or take, so it\u2019s not very clear in my mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve done some research, and I was basically a caveman in central Asia when he took me. My tribe didn\u2019t have a name other than the people; we barely knew other people existed. He plucked me up and shaped me, made me into this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou said he was alone, but we saw \nanother one\n in Boston.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome of them came back to see how He was doing. They wanted very little to do with me when they found out He was dead, but they stayed for a while to help me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWith?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy people.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever you did to your cultists.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI made them like me. To an extent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich is what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA conduit for thaumaturgy. Instead of rites or rituals, we can simply access that power. Your Captain Zadeh, she had to put tremendous energy into preparing for her thaumaturgy, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that much about it but yeah, she would prep evocations before hand to be used in the thick of things.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight, well my people don\u2019t have to do that. Neither do I.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, like, are they immortal too? Super strong, all that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know what my father did to me to make those things happen, it seems to defy the structural physics of a human body.\u201d\n\n\nHe ceased stirring the soup and ladled some of it into a bowl which he passed to her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten in nearly a day. Eat.\u201d\n\n\nShe took the bowl and ate a spoonful. Cream of asparagus.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back for a minute, why did your father murder the Daevites?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was revenge at the time, but looking back, I think he didn\u2019t see another option. Here was a group of the humans he was trying to elevate, stuck in the mud and loving it, refusing to move an inch. All the while, threatening the work he was doing. I think he saw them as counter to everything he was working for. He wasn\u2019t what you call a sentimental creature.\u201d\n\n\nHe took a sip of the soup from his own bowl.\n\n\n\u201cAll these years later and she hates any vestige of His influence. You saw the forces she brought to bear in the desert, she won\u2019t stop until I and all those I have guided are dead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut \nhow\n do we stop her?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nADDENDUM 7812.1: Culebra-Simmons Syndrome:\n\n\nSCP-7812 has been traced to the development of a relatively rare\n4\n cognitive dysfunction designated as \nCulebra-Simmons Syndrome\n, the relevant symptoms of which are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIntermittent aphasia\n\n\nIntermittent involuntary vocalizations\n\n\nProgressive delusions about one\u2019s body of various dysmorphic conditions, but a universal component is the delusion that the individual requires much more sustenance than is healthy for a typical human being of similar body type\n5\n\n\nInability to moderate tone of voice\n\n\n[In advanced cases]\n\n\n\n\nAggression and hostility, leading to violence\n\n\npica syndrome-like behavior\n\n\naggressive \u201chunting\u201d behavior where affected individuals attack and eat living creatures without cooking them \u2013 i.e. wild rodents, lizards, birds, domesticated pets, and in several cases, human beings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical degradation of the human genome has been noted in people exhibiting symptoms of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome leading to: diminishing function of the ocular and sexual organs, diminished pain response, and increased sensitivity to gustatory and olfactory organs. It is predicted that without containment protocols, this degradation will progress until the eyes and genitals are no longer functional and eventually will disappear entirely from the human species in future generations.\n\n\nCulebra-Simmons originates with the infection designated as SCP-7812, but it is transmitted from person to person through conversation of ideas concerning relevant subjects such as hunger, famine, starvation, diet, culinary arts, taste or even the abstract concept of consumption \u2013 such as the \u201cconsumption of media.\u201d\n\n\nAmnesticization has proven effective in treating those displaying early symptoms of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome, but only with multiple infusions of Class A amnestics leading to loss of identity similar to clinical retrograde amnesia. Foundation forces have made a comprehensive survey of mental health records on an international basis, identifying over three hundred thousand individuals worldwide who have sought mental health treatment or were involuntarily hospitalized due to what was obviously Culebra-Simmons Syndrome given the discovery of SCP-7812.\n\n\nIndividuals with advanced Culebra-Simmons tend to congregate together as the condition progresses, forming loose knit communities in abandoned spaces which they defend aggressively.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think you might be able to help in that,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cWhy? I haven\u2019t had much luck so far.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou hurt her, with that knife of yours. More importantly you scared her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t yourself, but yes. You spoke in another voice, shunted off her control, and even stabbed her with the athame.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah lowered her head into her hands.\n\n\n\u201cHow \ndid\n you manage that?\u201d\n\n\nHer eyes downcast, she shook her head still cradled in her hands.\n\n\n\u201cAgent Douglas?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know! Alright?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 you have an idea.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah nodded.\n\n\n\u201cThe thing in the other world, the one that touched you.\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded again.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7812.2: Historical and Cultural References\n\n\nIn an attempt to research cultural references to SCP-7812, the Department of History was commissioned with a wide scope survey project resulting in several significant mythological and traditional narratives that seemingly reference to SCP-7812. In particular, references in the \nDaevite\n and \nSarkic\n traditions were found to be relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExcerpt from \nSCP-140\n\n\n \n\n\nExistence cascades from the source of all: the Spark, the Mouth, the Font\n\n\nFrom out of the Font, came not only the Breath and pure lineage of the Daeva\n\n\nBut Four beings of Light spun out of existence\n\n\nFour Servants to the Will of They who created All\n\n\n \n\n\nTo guard the world and ensure the ascendancy of the unpolluted Mothers\n\n\nThus the Blood will rule forever\n\n\nFor They who created all, whose dreams shape the universe\n\n\nWill never be dethroned\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from \nA History of \u201cA Chronicle of the Daeva\u201d\n by Dr. Wentworth Sullivan:\n\n\n\n\nThe Daevite faith did not have saints or bodhisattvas, theirs was a religious practice concerned with veneration of life itself as a nebulous force they called the Font and veneration of the holy lineage of Daeva matriarchs. However, in the tradition there were four ethereal beings that the Daeva claimed were formed of the stuff of the universe yet had no form. These were the closest thing to angels to the Daeva, which they called the Agents of Life, these entities were unknowable but their influence extruded into the physical realm on behalf of the Font.\n\n\nIt was not common practice for the Daevite matriarchs to pray but on occasion a matriarch would beseech one of these four Agents of Life. This was considered an act of desperation, only to be taken if the lineage was at risk. Apparently, the Daeva believed that to seek the favor of the Font\u2019s emissaries required a sacrifice far beyond the usual bloodletting in their rituals. During the many coexisting collapses of the Daevite civilization detailed in the Chronicle of the Daeva, this action was only noted as taking place once; such was the requisite cost of life that it was simply impractical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\nBased on prior involvement with SCP-7812-A, Judith Low found reference to SCP-7812 in the writings of a vanished Sarkic community with ties to Romania:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExcerpt from the \nValkzaron\n6\n\n\n \n\n\nThe heaving Devourer cast out in its fetid mindlessness\n\n\nFor companions of equal hunger\n\n\nFour were crafted from the flesh of the newborn material realm\n\n\n \n\n\nMewling, formless things that served the Devourer\n\n\nFaceless eternal impotence and hunger\n\n\nEver yearning to escape the turbulent darkness of The Outer Void\n\n\nand into the physical world created by Yaldabaoth\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Archons ache to consume the cosmos one world at a time\n\n\nUntil their teeth have torn through final surviving world,\n\nand the Great Winnower is revenged upon its creation\n\n\nWhich will return the universe to its birth state \u2013 without Light\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from \nDetailing the Cosmology of the Ancient Sarkite\n by Dr. Judith Low:\n\n\n\n\nThe Grand Karcist taught that the Demiurge, Yaldabaoth or the Devourer, was mindless, without foresight or consciousness, and purely an instinctual creator/prophesized destroyer of the material universe. But, despite its apparent ego-less existence, the Devourer apparently felt lonely, thus did it create four entities to serve as its pantheon.\n\n\nThese were the Archons, four servants of the Demiurge and the actual builders of the physical universe on behalf of it. These entities were not wholly of the universe \u2013 faceless and formless but with agency and consciousness of a sort. According to ancient Sarkic myth, the Archons were the embodiment of primordial chaos, stretching into the material realm to sew the seeds of destruction. This took the form of natural disasters in general, but in specific, the Archons were the engineers of the Six Ordeals of Ion \u2013 in an effort to defeat him before prior to his ascendancy.\n\n\nIt is said that the Archons cannot reach into our universe, because they originate in the outer void, a kingdom of darkness where no life can persist. It is the goal of each Archon to pierce the veil of the material realm and fully manifest so as to consume the world, even to a conceptual level.\n\n\nThis has a rather interesting wrinkle, in that one of the core tenets of the Sarkite faith is \u201cTo Shepherd the Flesh.\u201d According to Ion\u2019s teachings, all life in the universe comes from a single progenitor, the Demiurge. All life has a shared ancestry, venerated in the form of flesh crafting \u2013 labelled by the Foundation as carnomancy and by the Sarkite as \u201c\nLihakut'ak\n\u201d \u2013 stemming from \u201c\nWeri\n\u201d or \u201cThe Old Blood.\u201d\n\n\nWhich means, even the lowest Sarkic practitioner \u2013 no matter how pure \u2013 is descended metaphysically from Yaldabaoth. Just like the Archons. In the realm of Sarkite cosmology, mankind is the second cousin twice removed from the agents of the creator of the world, and they will be the death of everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWho knows? But I can tell you one thing,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t learn shit sitting around here and talking.\u201d\n\n\nEuboea laughed and stood up. \u201cNo, most likely not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, do you have a next move?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have some favors we can call in. Come on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook around, what does that tell you?\u201d\n\n\nRebekah glanced around the room. They were standing in a large room, made of stones of various sizes. The outer wall rounded away from them, like the outer wall of a circular building. But as strange as that was, the interesting thing was the bookshelves that lined every section of the walls.\n\n\n\u201cA library.\u201d\n\n\nEuboea nodded. \u201cA library, yes. Depository, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, so?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, less \u2018a library\u2019 as much as \u2018\nthe Library\n\u2019.\u201d\n\n\nShe turned to look at him, her eyes narrowing.\n\n\n\u201cWait, I thought we couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAnother voice called from behind her. \u201cFoundation agents can\u2019t enter the Library, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah turned towards the new voice and saw a very young woman in a black sport coat, black blouse, blue jeans and boots. She brushed a stray lock of hair from her eyes and smiled. \u201cSo, how can you be here, I wonder?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAllison,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cEuboea. Lovely to see you again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat, you two know each other. Want to cue me in?\u201d Rebekah asked.\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Allison Chao; you might know me better as the Black Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t ring a bell, sorry. Wait, you call yourself a queen? What are you, 17?\u201d\n\n\nThe Black Queen laughed and held open a door. Rebekah and Euboea followed her out of the room and into a conference style room, with more bookshelves.\n\n\n\u201cSo, is this like the Library library? For real?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe are in the Library. Well\u2026 it\u2019s a library in the Library, just to be confusing. This depository is a place I like to store my collection, and I keep this open for the other members of the Serpent\u2019s Hand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh great, so not only am I AWOL, but meeting with an agent of the enemy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot so much an agent but leader, in a way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat makes it so much better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you two are done with the flirting, could we get to business?\u201d Euboea said.\n\n\nThe Black Queen snorted. Rebekah grimaced and asked, \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd how did you get her here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA Way in Munich. And she\u2019s no longer with the Foundation,\u201d he answered.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t a wanted fugitive by now, you\u2019re at the very least unemployed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Way directly to my depository?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, as it happens, I would be glad to show it to you if you could help us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHelp with?\u201d\n\n\nThe next hour involved Rebekah and Euboea explaining their complicated history and that of the Daevite return with the Matriarch. At that point, the Black Queen\u2019s cynicism bled away into surprise. \u201cA Daevite alive today? Not just some cultist with delusions of grandeur?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s hardly alive, but she\u2019s animated and causing all sorts of hell up and down the continent. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t heard anything,\u201d Rebekah said.\n\n\n\u201cI have heard of these events you\u2019re mentioning, a few of them anyway. But I did not think the appearance of an abandoned temple in Greece or the Foundation quarantining part of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te for a few hours had to do with the return of mythical horror stories. Then again, I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. We\u2019ve been finding things left over from them for years. And by we, I mean \nyou\n.\u201d The Black Queen stared at Rebekah.\n\n\n\u201cLook, I get our two organizations have a lot of bad blood, but I\u2019m just someone stuck in a bad situation that could blow up and fuck with the whole world. Countless people have died already, even with the Foundation trying to limit her activities. Imagine if she\u2019s successful. How long before a reborn Daevite empire comes knocking on the Hand\u2019s door?\u201d\n\n\nThe Black Queen sighed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe need some way to find her, before she makes her next move,\u201d Euboea said.\n\n\n\u201cIf even half the things you\u2019ve told me are true, haven\u2019t you been around for millennia? Why do you need my help?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have never spent my time studying the way I should have. Nuanced workings like finding someone are hard for me. We need to move fast before the Matriarch tries something else and this time succeeds.\u201d\n\n\nThe Black Queen rose from her chair and started to walk out of the room. \u201cJust stay here, I don\u2019t need Foundation agents wandering around.\u201d\n\n\nShe left, closing the door behind her.\n\n\n\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThrough a Way, like I said.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd Ways are hardcoded right? They connect specific places?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUsually, yes. But sometimes you can create one temporarily with enough power and something to anchor you at the exit. Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Iona.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat is a terrible idea. You\u2019re almost certainly a fugitive, like I said. I left the camera you were wearing, I didn\u2019t want them to track us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDirector Varga has certainly seen the footage and will know that something is wrong. Something anomalous, as you people put it. That\u2019s why I took you. After seeing how well you were able to counteract her spell, and how the knife hurt her, I couldn\u2019t let them lock you up for study. And let\u2019s face it, that is what would happen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t just lock up anyone with abilities. They hired me \nfor\n my abilities.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t psychic phenomena, Rebekah. You\u2019re possessed by an alien intelligence of astonishing strength. You have control, but they won\u2019t care. Even if Varga is your friend as you think, she won\u2019t have a choice. Especially after I reneged on our deal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it been, a day? We could rush in there, explain things, she would understand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah\u2019s mouth opened to speak but nothing happened. She just stared at him.\n\n\n\u201cHow could you not know that?\u201d he asked. \"You were recovering for more than ten days since Romania. But you were conscious sometimes, and we even spoke.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d she yelled.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to you, but it\u2019s interfering with your perceptions of reality. Which only means we have less time than I thought.\u201d\n\n\nShe slammed her palms against the table.\n\n\n\u201cTwo weeks\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve been hiding you all that time. A few days ago, there was a flurry of activity in England and since there\u2019s been multiple teams flying out of Site-91. They\u2019re looking for something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy people.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re looking for me. That sounds like mobilization. Something has them worried.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nADDENDUM 7812.3: Discovery of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered Footage from London Metropolitan Police\n\n\n28 September, 1993\n\n\n\n\nForeword\n: The police department received numerous complaints about attacks against pedestrians at London Underground stations by what was described as homeless individuals. CC TV footage did not reveal any individuals matching the descriptions entering or exiting the Underground, thus it was theorized that the assailants represented a small group of homeless individuals living in the tunnels. Cataloguing the location of the alleged assaults, the department was able to triangulate the most likely underground spaces these individuals were residing in \u2013 an abandoned tunnel leading to a decommissioned station. It was decided to perform a raid at 01:00, launched from the St. Paul\u2019s station,\n7\n because the trains would not be running at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to abandoned tunnel in London Underground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01:05\n: Fifteen Metropolitan AFOs\n8\n gather on the platform of St. Paul\u2019s Underground station. The officers assist one another down from the platform and begin walking northeast along the tracks.\n\n\n01:10\n: The officers arrive at the entrance to the abandoned tunnel thought to house the assailants.\n\n\n01:11\n: Several officers report howling noises coming from within the tunnel, but the group proceeds apace.\n\n\n01:13\n: Two individuals rush towards the officers screaming incoherently. Despite attempts to calm these individuals down, they proceed to physically assault several of the officers. One bites out the throat of an officer, tackling her to the ground. Another breaks the arm of an officer with little effort and throwing him against the wall. The other officers shoot and kill the two assailants. Both are disheveled and dirty, seemingly having been living in these tunnels for months. Asking for assistance from emergency medical services for the surviving victim officer, the police leave one of their number and move on.\n\n\n01:15\n: The police officers arrive at the decommissioned Underground station, seeing numerous bed mats and pieces of cardboard laid on the floor. A shrill scream is raised in the station, followed by countless others.\n\n\n01:16\n: Over three hundred disheveled individuals rush the police officers, who open fire.\n\n\n01:17\n: Several dozen assailants fall to gun shots but many more quickly approach the officers. Three police officers are dragged to the ground with dozens of hands striking at their armor and digging fingers into exposed flesh. An officer\u2019s eyes are pulled out by one of the assailants, who proceeds to eat the organs before being hit with several rounds from other officers.\n\n\n01:19\n: The ten remaining officers begin pulling back to the tunnel, pursued by the assailants. Several officers reach the end of the tunnel and turn to cover their colleagues. At least a dozen assailants fall, but an additional officer is dragged down and torn apart by others.\n\n\n01:20\n: The remaining officers retreat past the entrance of the abandoned tunnel and the assailants stop following them. The officers watch as five assailants proceed to tear and consume chunks of flesh from the officer who fell with their teeth and fingers.\n\n\n01:24\n: Nine surviving officers retreat to St. Paul\u2019s station and report to their superiors.\n\n\n\n\nAfterword\n: Michael Howard\n9\n reached out to Foundation representatives through backchannels and requested assistance. MTF Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d) were mobilized to the scene by 05:00 and the Underground line was shut down under a cover story of gas leak. Zeta-9 personnel sealed the area populated with the individuals and flooded the tunnels with a light mixture of aerosolized valium before beginning the assault. The assailants who were still alive (roughly two hundred and sixty) were stunned into unconsciousness and contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn the following days, the medical center at Site-91 was utilized to examine and treat the individuals recovered from the operation. Subsequent to its discovery, connection was made to SCP-7812\u2019s emergence in the noosphere through screening for cognitohazards and confirmed by use of Fehn cognitoscope scanning. Thus, amnesticization was utilized to return those individuals to their conscious state before infection by what was termed Culebra-Simmons Syndrome.\n\nContinuing operations to identify and contain individuals affected by the syndrome are ongoing.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 7812.4: Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummation of Threat Analysis Concerning SCP-7812\n\n\n1 October, 1993\n\n\nDrs. Iona Varga & Judith Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving analyzed those individuals recovered from the London Underground and offered them treatment here at Site-91\u2019s medical center, we have come to two conclusions.\n\n\n1) This is not an isolated event or viral infection. Numerous other reports have been found in medical and police records across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia \u2013 the earliest of which date to 1991. For this reason I have retasked Site-91 forces to find and contain any and all individuals currently infected with the condition.\n\n\n2) The infection has not occurred in a vacuum and is quite clearly anomalous. Culebra-Simmons Syndrome is the side-effect of an ideatic invasion in the no\u00f6sphere. Provisionally classified as SCP-7812, this infection has taken root in the famis occulta, and is slowly expanding in size. There is every possibility that this alien concept, whether or not it is a sapient force, will subsume the human conceptual understanding of hunger and consumption, both abstract and practical.\n\n\nSCP-7812\u2019s primary mode of expansion appears to correlate with the number of individuals currently affected by Culebra-Simmons, as minute reductions have been observed with successful treatment of those contained. But we have reason to believe this infection has been in place for decades, far longer than cases of Culebra-Simmons have been observed. Even if we are successful in containing each affected case of the Syndrome, there is no obvious likelihood of neutralization. At best, projections show a reduction of conceptual size of the infection to approximately 10% of its current ideatic volume. Containment must therefore be focused on containment of affected individuals, while alternative plans are made for the direct containment of the infection point.\n\n\nGiven the research of the Department of History, SCP-7812 has been known to anomalous communities for millennia, with very different accounts from the Daevite and Sarkic traditions. Given the mythological importance of this anomaly, we are unsure how to even begin a direct containment effort.\n\n\nAdditionally, at this time we do not have a working theoretical framework for the surgical excision of SCP-7812 from the no\u00f6sphere. Therefore, our new normal will have to factor in this alien presence in our conceptual ecosystem.\n\n\nThe pattern of infection seems random unless an outside factor is considered. A carrier. Someone or something moving around the world spreading the Syndrome. All attempts must be made to identify and contain this vector, whatever it may be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, how long is this going to take?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs long as it takes, Agent,\u201d the Black Queen said without taking her eyes off the dish.\n\n\nThe three of them were seated around table with a shallow silver dish with flanged rim, filled with water. When the water was poured, it was crystal clear, but as Chao whispered over it, the water had started to glow and clouded over.\n\n\nThat was over an hour before. They had been staring at the swirling waters all that time. Chao had assured them both that the enchantment on the mirror hated the Daeva, so it would find the one active member of that long dead dynasty if asked. But as they rounded out to the ninety-minute mark, Rebekah just couldn\u2019t anymore.\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there something else we can do here?\u201d\n\n\nEuboea glanced sideways at her with a sigh. \u201cRebekah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re on a tight schedule here. We need to see what she\u2019s doing and get to her before another ritual is performed. Or before Site-91 finds her first.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust be patient.\u201d\n\n\nAnother few minutes passed, and Rebekah found herself pacing the room, glancing over the titles of esoteric books on shelves not recognizing anything. She was about to turn back towards the table when a book\u2019s title caught her eye: \nBlood and the Thaumaturgic Ritual\n.\n\n\n\u201cWhat if we used a little blood?\u201d she asked.\n\n\nThe Black Queen looked at her sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t like using that sort of ritual.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut this is looking for a Daeva, and they were obsessed with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a point, Allison,\u201d Euboea said. \u201cAlso, she recently underwent the Matriarch\u2019s touch, there might be a sympathetic conduit there.\u201d\n\n\nThe young woman sighed, slipped a hand into her pocket and pulled out a small folding knife. \u201cGive me your hand, Agent.\u201d\n\n\nRebekah hesitated but with both of them looking at her, she didn\u2019t feel much choice. Afterall, she had been the one to suggest it. She placed her hand in the Black Queen\u2019s, palm up. The woman pressed the blade into her forefinger lightly, and held it so a drop or two fell into the water, speaking in what Rebekah believed was Aramaic. Rebekah withdrew her hand quickly, applying pressure, but was distracted by the water in the dish. The glowing cloudy water had shifted in tone to blood red, much more than would be expected from a few drops of her blood.\n\n\nThe swirling waters parted and there in the dish, she saw the Matriarch surrounded by her constructs in a very green but overcast scene.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s outside Site-91!\u201d\n\n\nSure enough, the Matriarch was leading her constructs towards the walled property containing the Foundation Research Site. Even as she opened her mouth to ask another question, the \nDaevite\u2019s tree golems\n opened fire on the walls surrounding the 18\nth\n century manor. No sound transmitted through the image but she could imagine the roaring explosions as the front gate to the manor was ripped from its hinges.\n\n\n\u201cWe need to get there. Now.\u201d\n\n\nThe Black Queen shook her head. \u201cI could get you to York, but you\u2019d still be kilometers away.\u201d\n\n\nEuboea stared at the images of Foundation forces attacking the Matriarch\u2019s puppet army, hundreds of the constructs armed to the teeth and rushing through the ruined gates. He saw Cynthia, one of his adepts working with Varga, throwing thaumaturgy at the wave of enemy forces before a stray round caught her in the throat and she spun backwards fountaining crimson.\n\n\n\u201cI might be able to get us to the Site directly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought the whole place was warded,\u201d the Black Queen said.\n\n\n\u201cIt is, which would usually be a problem. But if I know our enemy, she\u2019s heading right for the one thing that I could use to get us there quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rebekah asked.\n\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s body.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINCIDENT 7812.1: Discovery of SCP-7812\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfiltration of Site-91 by Hostile Forces\n\n\n5 October, 1993\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Beta-777 (\u201cHecate\u2019s Spear\u201d) Personnel Present\n:\n\n\nCaptain Rashid al Hasin\n10\n\n\nLieutenant Maria Waltham\n11\n\n\nSergeant Mark Kenoshi\n12\n\n\nSergeant Gabriel Merced\n\n\nForeword\n: \nOn 5 October, 1993, at 0400 local time, a significant strength military assault was launched directly against Site-91. Although this assault was made of anomalous individuals and entities, the assault itself took conventional form, making the thaumaturgical wards placed along the property\u2019s borders ineffectual in combating the effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of Site-91 research and containment facility from the south.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Captain al Hasin and Sergeant Kenoshi gather security personnel within Site-91\u2019s armory.]\n\n\nCaptain al Hasin\n: We have an evolving situation here, people. Ten minutes ago, security systems picked up a large group of individuals approaching from the South, directly towards the main gate. At this time, we do not have a good count of the assaulting force, nor do we have details concerning their makeup.\n\n\n[An explosion rocks the room and sends several security personnel sprawling.]\n\n\nCaptain al Hasin\n: Alright people, get geared up as fast as you can, you\u2019ll be mobilized with myself and Sergeant Kenoshi. Let\u2019s move.\n\n\n[Captain al Hasin\u2019s group spends the next few moments mobilizing to the barriers directly in the path of the assaulting force.]\n13\n\n\n[At the same time, Sergeant Merced and Lieutenant Waltham secure the Director\u2019s Office and activate security measures throughout the site.]\n\n\nDirector Varga\n: What are you doing here? Get out there!\n\n\nLieutenant Waltham\n: Procedures are clear, ma\u2019am. We secure your office and your person in the moment of external breach.\n\n\nDirector Varga\n: What the hell is happening?\n\n\nSergeant Merced\n: The Site is under attack from a sizable force. Given the limited individuals on Site at the moment, because of containment efforts already underway, I don\u2019t like our chances.\n\n\nDirector Varga\n: Lieutenant Waltham, leave the Sergeant here with me and find out what is happening exactly. You\u2019ve secured me, we\u2019re good. I need information.\n\n\n[Waltham tosses her a walkie talkie.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: Keep that on.\n\n\n[Waltham leaves the room checking her carbine and body armor. She moves rapidly through the administrative offices on the third floor of the manor, then approaches the stairs leading to the secure lobby on the first floor. She is met by Captain William Granger\n14\n and his security forces having barricaded the main entrance.]\n\n\nGranger\n: Lieutenant Waltham, I sent you to secure the Director. What the fuck are you doing down here?\n\n\nWaltham\n: Director\u2019s orders, she wants an update on the situation.\n\n\nGranger\n: Tell her highness we\u2019re under attack.\n\n\nWaltham\n: I think she\u2019s aware of\u2013\n\n\nGranger\n: What I need is for you to go back upstairs.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Frankly, sir, you don\u2019t command me. Captain al Hasin does. And he answers to Varga, so just answer the goddamn question.\n\n\nGranger\n: al Hasin and his team are dug in halfway down the property, in direct line of fire. I don\u2019t have an update from them yet.\n\n\n[The radio shrieks, followed by Sergeant Kenoshi\u2019s voice.]\n\n\nKenoshi\n: Site Actual, this is Forward Team. You hearing me?\n\n\nWaltham\n: Mark, we\u2019re here. What\u2019s your status?\n\n\n[Granger frowns but doesn\u2019t say anything.]\n\n\nKenoshi\n: We\u2019re being overrun here, there\u2019s so many of the bastards.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Who is it?\n\n\nKenoshi\n: Those grass golem things we\u2019ve seen associated with Daevite forces. Plus, some of the living trees with those cannons.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Where\u2019s Rashid?\n\n\nKenoshi\n: The Captain\u2019s has been hit, we need to get him to the med center but these things are everywhere.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Okay, I\u2019m coming out to you.\n\n\nKenoshi\n: Negative, they\u2019ve looped around our positions and are moving on the manor.\n\n\nGranger\n: Where?\n\n\nKenoshi\n: There\u2019s a few dozen holed up at the foot of the stairs just staring at the shutters over the entrance.\n\n\nWaltham\n: What are they doing?\n\n\nKenoshi\n: Nothing. Just staring and pointing their weapons at the shutters. The fuckers surrounding us aren\u2019t really trying to kill either, they seem sorta listless. I think we can hold most of them back.\n\n\nGranger\n: Are they approaching the manor at any other point? Have you seen a leader?\n\n\nKenoshi\n: Yes, I clock a couple of the little golems and a tree sentinel in front of the \ndoor to the crypt\n.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Shit.\n\n\n[She races up the stairs and away from Granger, back towards Director Varga\u2019s office. When she arrives, she opens the door roughly and is met with Merced\u2019s rifle barrel.]\n\n\nWaltham\n: Jesus Christ, Gabe.\n\n\nMerced\n: Sorry.\n\n\nVarga\n: What happened?\n\n\n[Waltham fills Varga in on the situation.]\n\n\nVarga\n: Dammit.\n\n\n[Varga stands and folds away a false front to one of her bookcases revealing a small elevator.]\n\n\nVarga\n: Let\u2019s go!\n\n\n[Waltham, Varga and Merced squeeze into the elevator. Varga punches in a code and the elevator car rushes down four floors. When the doors open again, they are in a small area fronted with a facsimile of stone wall. In the wall is a one-way mirror and mechanism to open the wall like a door. Through the observation mirror, a desiccated female figure\n15\n dressed in red and gold robes with an iron crown stands before the cadaver of SCP-4612-A. Waltham takes a step forward but Varga holds up a hand. Varga switches a speaker on at the base of the window, allowing sound to travel from the crypt.]\n\n\n[The desiccated woman mutters to herself, holding her palm flat next to the incision along the cadaver\u2019s ten meter long form. Blue ichor continues to pool beneath the incision on the stone table.]\n\n\n-Matriarch\n: After all the effort my people made to combat you, it was a pampered group of humans who managed to slit your throat. That must sting.\n\n\nWaltham\n: Is she talking to the body?\n\n\nMatriarch\n: Yes, I am, you idiot.\n\n\n[Waltham raises her carbine but is frozen in place. The rest of the incident is filmed through Waltham\u2019s body camera, but she does not move or speak again. The same is true of Merced and Varga.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: I\u2019m talking to \u201cthe body\u201d because it is still alive. I\u2019m sure it appeared dead to your soulless scientists, but this is stasis. Anything that bleeds for more than two hundred years is obviously not dead.\n\n\n[The Matriarch bends down to pick up a knife from the stone table, still coated in uncoagulated blue ichor.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: \nWith this knife which struck my enemy still stained with its blood, I call upon thee, O servant of my god, the source of all things, the Font.\n16\n\n\nMatriarch\n: \nOh, Luminous Agents of Life, hear my call. The last of the divine lineage calls upon you, in this moment of despair. If the bloodline is to be preserved, the world set to right along the ideals of our Master, the creator of all things, then I beseech you. Answer my plea.\n\n\n[The Matriarch slips the knife into the incision and widens the wound, causing more ichor to flow out. She lets the liquid pool in her palm then holds the cupped palm to her lips, drinking of the substance, letting it pour out down her mouth staining her skin and robes.]\n\n\nUnknown voice\n: STOP.\n\n\n[The Matriarch turns towards this new voice and sees a tear in reality along the opposite wall, through which comes a humanoid entity\n17\n with glowing blue eyes and accompanied by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.]\n\n\nEuboea\n: Take your hands off my Father\u2019s body.\n\n\n[Euboea raises a hand and fire illuminates the area pooling around his hand.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: It isn\u2019t dead you buffoon! Are you all idiots? Amazing that you\u2019ve been so successful against me.\n\n\n[Euboea lowers his hand and the fire fades.]\n\n\nEuboea\n: What do you mean?\n\n\nMatriarch\n: I\u2019ll not explain the workings of gods to fools, even those gods which want me dead.\n\n\n[Euboea\u2019s hands flare again but the Matriarch holds up her palm and he too freezes in place. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 does not move either. The Matriarch smiles and holds up the stained knife.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: I\u2019ll flay your god for me to eat, little slugson. And you can watch.\n\n\n[The Matriarch repeats her previous action, allowing more ichor to pool in her hand and painting her skin in its sheen while continuing to chant in Daevic.]\n\n\n[The lights in the crypt dim, and a voice is heard.]\n\n\nDaughter of the Blood.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: My lord.\n\n\n[The Matriarch prostrates herself on the stone floor, holding her knife and ichor stained hand out before her.]\n\n\nYou called. We came. What is it the Daughter of the Pure needs?\n\n\nMatriarch\n: This force has tried to end the lineage, along with their allies. I beseech thee, eradicate the Foundation and the one they call Euboea and his changed folk.\n\n\n[Booming laughter is heard.]\n\n\nTHIS IS ALL YOU ASK OF US? KILL SOME MORTALS? WASTE NOT THE ETERNAL\u2019S ATTENTION, SLAVE.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: I beg of thee, it is not the killing that is important, it is the weaving of reality. These creatures thwart the Font\u2019s entire purpose. Wipe this Foundation from the Earth, and we might rebuild the Lineage\u2019s rule in this world. And then, serve the Font directly, through your direction.\n\n\nAll life serves the Primordial Creator, Slave. But we were called, so let us see what we can do.\n\n\n[The Matriarch continues to kneel silently for a moment during which the voice does not respond.]\n\n\nAh, interesting, I would not have expected such capacity or power. Having contained the upstart\u2019s fleshy children, and many other phenomena.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: Do you mean you cannot do th\u2013\n\n\nOF COURSE WE CAN. WE ARE THE CREATORS OF EVERYTHING, FOR SHE WHO SLEEPS ETERNAL. WE CAN DO ANYTHING.\n\n\nMatriarch\n: Please forgive me, my Lord. What shall I do to aid you?\n\n\nWelcome us into your world, we need to touch the fabric of the universe for ourselves if we are to\u2013\n\n\n[The Matriarch screams, interrupting the disembodied voice. There is a stone knife, an athame, sticking out of the back of her neck at a 45-degree angle. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is holding the handle.

It is only a matter of time before we feed, Sister/Brother.\n\n\nThat changes everything. I shall leave it to you. May our domination of this world be swift!\n\n\n[The lights resume their brightness in the crypt. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 crouches down in front of the Matriarch, gripping the hilt of the knife.]\n\n\nMatriarch\n: What are you?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I\u2019m the same woman you\u2019ve tried to kill several times, your highness.

Connection was made when all present personnel developed early signs of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome and required light amnestic treatment. Additionally, despite the usual ambient Akiva radiation present underneath Site-91 due to SCP-4612-A\u2019s presence, sensors observed almost no radiation during \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s appearance. Director Varga theorizes that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was consuming the ambient radiation normally present in the crypt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDirector Varga closed the file on SCP-7812 and pushed it away from her. She leaned back behind her desk and crossed her arms over her chest.\n\n\n\u201cDammit, Rebekah.\u201d\n\n\nHer desktop computer pinged, having received a secure message through SCiPNet. She turned the monitor on and keyed in her passcode. Opening the message, she frowned.\n\n\n\u201cHow in the hell?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Iona Varga, PhD/MD \u2013 Director of Site-91\n\n\nFrom:\n Rebekah Douglas\n\n\nSubject:\n Thank you\n\n\n\n\nHey Iona,\n\n\nI know you\u2019re probably wondering how I managed to get a message to you. Don\u2019t worry about that, I called in some favors. What is important is that I\u2019m not coming back.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you have everyone out looking for me, but I had to reach out. I\u2019m sorry things played out this way. I\u2019m sorry you put yourself out on a limb and I let you down. Hopefully, you\u2019ll see that I did what I had to. She needed to die. Time and again she showed us how dangerous she was, it was only her arrogance that left her vulnerable. We showed up the way we did because that was the only option left.\n\n\nBut this was to thank you. You looked out for me and gave me a chance. Even if I blew it, that still meant the world to me. And now, I\u2019ve got something inside my head, and it won\u2019t let go. I know it\u2019s something terrible and even if I had played by the rules, you\u2019d still have to contain me. And even though I\u2019d love to give you the benefit of the doubt, I can\u2019t. You won\u2019t hear from me again; I\u2019m going underground for a while to figure it out.\n\n\nAnyway\u2026 thanks. I hope someday we can laugh about all this. But I won\u2019t be holding my breath.\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nRebekah\n\n\n\n\nVarga sighed and depressed the buzzer that connected to her assistant. \u201cJulie, will you come in here?\u201d\n\n\nJulie came in carrying another stack of documents, which she placed at the front of the Director\u2019s desk. \u201cAfter action reports on the incident.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Varga said as she slid the documents closer. \u201cWhen you go back out, call down to the lab and have them prep the surgery.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to examine the Daevite myself.\u201d\n\n\nJulie turned to go out and Varga called to her as she was about to close the door.\n\n\n\u201cAny word from Captain al Hasin?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing positive. They\u2019re fairly sure she went into the Library but from there they don\u2019t know where to start looking.\u201d\n\n\nVarga nodded as Julie shut the door to her office. She looked up at the screen and held the cursor over the forward button, intending to send the email to the Captain. She stared for a moment and smiled, deleting the message instead.\n\n\n\u201cStupid girl.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+80\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHecatoncheires Cycle\n\n\n<< SCP-6520: Director's Eyes Only\n | \nSCP-7812\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7812\n\" by Grigori Karpin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
