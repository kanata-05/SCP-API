The container itself is to be encased within a Faraday cage located in a standard containment chamber. Radiological protection guidelines are to be followed, and personnel must use Geiger counters to monitor radiation emissions during maintenance. Any unusual occurrences are to be reported to the HMCL supervisor on duty.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6536 is the corpse of a humanoid entity measuring 2.7 meters in height, and weighing 201\u00a0kg. SCP-6536 resembles baseline humans (\nHomo sapiens\n), but it exhibits the following characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe corpse does not undergo the process of decomposition.\n\n\nInstead of a protruding nose, SCP-6536 possesses a flat nasal slit.\n\n\nThe teeth are sharp and protrude from the mouth with no cheeks or lips to cover them. A mild case of hyperdontia can also be observed.\n\n\nThe index and middle fingers of the right hand are elongated, measuring around 60\u00a0cm long and terminating at barbed stingers. Furthermore, the bones of these fingers are absent, allowing a more flexible degree of movement.\n\n\nAn underdeveloped mouth can be found on the right palm, which is lined with small, serrated teeth.\n\n\nNo hair is present anywhere on the body.\n\n\nThe skin is a dark blue color, and it is invulnerable to any damage inflicted upon it during attempts at dissection.\n\n\nThe eyes lack pupils or irises, and the sclera is colored completely black.\n\n\nThe spinous process of the vertebrae extends outward by around 1\u00a0cm. It does not penetrate through the skin.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside these characteristics, signs of injury can also be observed. The left arm is twisted backwards with the humerus, ulna, and radius broken. Further assessment of the damage note multiple greenstick and spiral type fractures. The lower jaw is dislocated to the left side. Additionally, the cervical vertebrae is disconnected from the rest of the spine, which is suspected to be the cause of death.\n\n\nThe corpse is irradiated, emitting around 0.8\u00a0mSv of ionizing radiation per hour. In addition, SCP-6536 occasionally produces a current of static electricity which dissipate in small arcs out of the body. The source of the electrical charge is unknown. These qualities have thus far been manageable for containment personnel, but precautions have been put in place for potential spikes in activity.\n\n\nAddendum 01:\n Discovery\n\n\nOn March 5, 1992, SCP-6536 was discovered on the Greek island of Crete in the White Mountains. It was located within a tomb where it was encased inside a wooden sarcophagus lined with lead. Near the entrance a slab of stone was inscribed with the following message in Ancient Greek.\n\n\n\n\nEntombed here is a mad man slain by Zeus and Heracles.\n\n\nHis name we do not speak, and we curse all utterance of it from across the land into oblivion. To the future scholars who may find this place, we pass the burden of condemning this man onto you. His flesh refuses to rot or burn, and his presence brings about a slow sickness. We leave you the remaining few writings of this man so you may understand his folly.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the slab, a chest was found to contain several papyrus scrolls. Their contents have been translated and transcribed in Addendum 02. Currently, researchers are attempting to ascertain the identity of SCP-6536, if possible.\n\n\nAddendum 02:\n Recovered Scrolls\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Some sections of the scrolls were found to be illegible due to corrosion or vandalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a dull day for I desire greater alchemies to study. The ichor of the Dactyls\n1\n does not have the power that I seek. What did I expect from weak, broken men who cling to copper and their forges to escape flesh? All I see for them is rust claiming their souls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance of the Kouretes\n2\n was difficult but I have mastered it. There are more arcane dances that they know, but they refuse to teach me after I had offered them more gold. Some are so profane they are used only in the most terrible of wars. I heard they worship [Illegible]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamn [Illegible]\n\n\nHe dare request me to exchange kingdoms. What if he gave me claim over his kingdom instead while him and his whore have nothing. I hate him. I [Illegible] him. It is an insult to my father. If only I can have the power that I seek now so I may pluck him out of the sky from that accursed horse. All kingdoms will be mine, but for now I will have to take his offer to hide my true intentions. The land may have necessary material for my alchemies. Vengeance for my father will come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI spoke [Illegible] the flesh [Illegible] of Lycia.\n3\n [Illegible] offered [Illegible] shepherd the flesh. The Dactyls spoke of how much they feared him, and the rest of his kin in the far east. I must possess this power so they can fear me too.\n\n\nI asked him if he could kill [Illegible] My own hands cannot be used to slay him or else the gods of Olympus will pursue me. He accepted in exchange for all the knowledge I had of the Dactyls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illegible] brought a witch knowledgeable in poisons. He called her a disciple of [Illegible] Her venom is certainly more potent than the poisons I have tried to recreate from the Telchines.\n4\n She will travel to [Illegible] in the night to deliver death upon [Illegible] My father will finally receive justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sorcerer taught me well. Sickness and age can no longer ail me. My own flesh can change into a beast. As promised I repaid the sorcerer by telling him where the Dactyls dwelled. They finally became of use to me. May they join their god at last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illegible], my son, knows not how to rule a kingdom. His son has been no better. It is a shame I must hide in the shadows. I alone must rule the land. Curse the gods. Soon they will meet their end by my hands. Slaying Zeus himself will be my greatest trophy for he sired [Illegible]. If it were not for him my father would have lived. He does not deserve to reign as king of the gods. His throne will be mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illegible] offered my son in exchange. He lived a life of wealth I had bestowed upon him since birth. It was time for the boy to honor me. The [Illegible] may have cursed my lineage, but it will not matter when I become a god.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy collection of spells continue to grow. I have sent an expedition to Nemea to find [Illegible] A strand of hair is all I need from the beast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illegible] a success. The blades of my guards could not cut me nor can fire sear me. I am becoming more divine. My remaining men deserve to be rewarded for bringing me this blessing, but they know too much about my plans. I should turn them into simple minded beasts unable to speak so they may continue to serve me. Such servants would be more fitting for a god.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of them has escaped before I could finish changing him into a mindless beast. My guards are [Illegible] I must perform one final ritual before word spreads about me. [Illegible] scrolls written in blood [Illegible] I will be written as their king.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally understand it now. Death will just be the beginning. The gods and \nthe scholars of Athens\n likely know now that I still live. They will send Heracles to break me, but it does not matter. He will fall to me. I will go to Olympus, but first I will travel to Athens to claim what I please from the scholars. If only my father could witness me now. After years of study, my ascension finally begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

The Kouretes, also known as the Korybantes, were an ancient group suspected to have practiced kinetoglyphs according to archaeological evidence. In mythology, they guarded the god Zeus when he was an infant. They performed a dance to drown out his cries from his father Cronus.
