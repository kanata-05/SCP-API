SCP-8846 is one of few known exceptions to this.\n\n\nShould SCP-8846 become used, it will corrupt any files classified under it due to emergent behavior from the 'Pending/Concentra' classification. As 'Pending' refers to anomalies which have not yet been classified, and 'Concentra' refers to anomalies affecting recursive phenomenon, the ACS assumes that the item cannot be classified until recursive behavior occurs\n3\n, and that recursive behavior will not occur until the item is classified\n4\n. This definition is in itself recursive, and the ACS cannot compensate for it, invariably resulting in file corruption.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: NARCISSUS Protocol\n\n\n\n\nThe NARCISSUS protocol is comprised of two steps: Identification, and Activation.\n\n\nIdentification involves finding a suitable center for the protocol. Suitable centers must possess the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n\nHaving been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder by a medical professional. This diagnosis must have been sustained over no less than 30 months.\n\n\nHaving no more than 3 close friends.\n\n\nHaving no extant family.\n\n\nHaving no large public footprint, nor any successful internet endeavors\n5\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis individual must then be designated 'POI-8846'.\n\n\nActivation involves the interaction of POI-8846 and an anomaly classified under SCP-8846. Following or during Identification, POI-8846 will have become the essophysical\n6\n embodiment of being 'self-centered'. Both geometrically and ontologically, POI-8846's center will be themself. From this point on, any interaction with POI-8846's center will inherently be recursive\n7\n.\n\n\nPOI-8846's center is to interact with the anomaly classified under SCP-8846. Due to the recursive nature of this interaction, the anomaly will technically become related to recursive phenomenon and be classified as 'Concentra'. SCP-8846 will no longer be used.\n\n\nShould POI-8846 survive the interaction, they are to be amnesticized and returned to their prior life. The POI-8846 designation is to be rendered null.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. ACS class definitions cannot use ACS classes.\n\n\n2\n. IE. Thaumiel/Apollyon.\n\n\n3\n. Per the definition of 'Pending'.\n\n\n4\n. Per the definition of 'Concentra' as a subclass.\n\n\n5\n. IE. An account on a social media platform with a large number of 'followers'.\n\n\n6\n. The study of tangible concepts.\n\n\n7\n. As is any interaction in which an element contains itself as a nested sub element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8846\n\" by sprawlingstar, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
