The object should be handled carefully during testing due to its fragile nature. The lid of SCP-1535 is to be kept in a separate locker, only to be removed during testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1535 is a glass mason jar manufactured by the Ball company in 1946. SCP-1535 is physically similar to a typical glass mason jar.\n\n\nAnomalous properties of SCP-1535 present themselves when non-sapient entities such as insects or reptiles are placed within and the lid of SCP-1535 is sealed.\n\n\nEntities present within SCP-1535 after it has been sealed gain the ability to reason, fluency in the Spanish language, familiarity with Catholicism, and knowledge of Morse code. Residents of SCP-1535 are referred to as SCP-1535-1.\n\n\nAttempts to open the lid of SCP-1535 without damaging SCP-1535 have proven to be ineffective while living SCP-1535-1 are located within. The lid of SCP-1535 is removed simply when SCP-1535 no longer contains living SCP-1535-1. SCP-1535-1 expires 1-2 hours after being sealed within, presumably due to lack of oxygen.\n\n\nInterview 1535-1:\n A firefly is used in the following test for ease of communication. Testing with species of reptile and insect have proven themselves to be similar in result.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1 communicates by blinking in Morse code.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n Father, is it really you?\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Yes.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n I am at your will. You understand the joy I feel now seeing you finally.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Tell me your name.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1\n: I was named Camilo de Garibay after my father, also a devout servant.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n How did you get here?\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n I followed the light in the darkness.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Could you be more specific? What happened before this?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n I\u2026 well as you know, I died by a sinful disease. Please forgive me.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n You are forgiven.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n I have always wondered, what happens now that I am here? I am accepted here, correct? I have been faithful.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Are you aware of your present condition?\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n This is\u2026 strange, but I do not question your ways.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Thank you. (\nBreen speaks through the intercom.\n) Interview is complete, please remove SCP-1535.\n\n\nMore light can be seen flashing in increasing intervals from SCP-1535-1.\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n One moment, there may be something else here.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n I have been faithful! I have destroyed evil men for you! Please! Please let me in! Please!\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n \u2026\n\n\nSCP-1535-1 begins flying around SCP-1535 violently, colliding with its walls before falling to the bottom.\n\n\nSCP-1535-1:\n Is this Hell?\n\n\nResearcher Breen:\n Not really.\n\n\nInterview Concluded\n\n\nSCP-1535-1 does not communicate afterward. SCP-1535-1 expires in 2 hours.\n\n\n\n\nResearcher's Note: So far, all SCP-1535-1 entities claim to be deceased residents of Castilian Spain who lived between the years of 1500 and 1600.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1534\n | SCP-1535 | \nSCP-1536\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1535\n\" by faminepulse, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
