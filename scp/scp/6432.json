Personnel surveilling SCP-6432's containment locker are to be changed every 2 weeks. Direct physical contact with SCP-6432 is not permitted except during testing. Individuals who make direct contact with SCP-6432 are to remain isolated under surveillance for 15 days, or until SCP-6432's effect wears off. All but 1 SCP-6432-1 instance have been incinerated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6432 is the corpse of an avian creature, measuring 110cm from beak to tail, with wingspans of 130cm, 80cm and 50cm. While superficially resembling a bird in most respects, SCP-6432 differs in that it has six wings and no legs. Limited accounts prior to its termination observed it moving when on the ground by hopping on the 10cm talons found at the elbow joint of each wing. These 6 talons and SCP-6432\u2019s beak are significantly sharper than the talons of ordinary birds of\n\n\n\n\nprey.\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6432 exerts an anomalous effect on any living creature that comes into direct physical contact with it. Physical contact with the anomaly induces intense visual hallucinations, usually of flora and fauna typical of where the victim grew up, or other locations associated with significant memories. In addition to the hallucinations, the victim experiences disembodied sensory input, most commonly through only one sense. Examples of reported experiences are as follows:\n\n\n\nSmelling woody or floral scents\n\n\nHearing indistinct speech or whispering, often perceived as very nearby\n\n\nFeeling weather inconsistent with the victim's physical location\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6432-1 instances are the corpses of SCP-6432's victims, carrying pseudo-portals in all areas of the body fed upon by SCP-6432. These pseudo-portals appear as areas of bright, prismatic light, and when viewed through a specialized lens, act as windows to a hereto unidentified forested area. Five SCP-6432-1 instances were discovered in SCP-6432's initial area of destabilized reality, with pseudo-portals located in the facial and chest regions. It is hypothesized that SCP-6432 attacked the eyes first, as suggested by the most fully realized portals always being located in the region of the corpse's eye sockets, and as observed firsthand during the\n\n\n\n\nattempted\n\n\n\n\n\nrecovery of the anomaly.\n\nHistory:\n SCP-6432 was discovered as the source of a small splinter reality centered on an abandoned house near Millinocket, Maine. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (\u201cWhite Rabbits\u201d) was assigned to investigate but failed to return the anomaly\n\n\n\n\nalive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOVERY LOG TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Commander Steven Conley\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Ryan Powell, Katherine Reid, Alexa Hewitt, Ira Watts\n\n\nNOTE:\n Video footage from is taken from Agent Powell's body camera, as other footage suffered became heavily corrupted as a result of SCP-6432's unreality field.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nConley:\n Comms check.\n\n\nReid:\n Check.\n\n\nPowell:\n Hoo-rah.\n\n\nHewitt:\n Check.\n\n\nWatts:\n Check.\n\n\nConley:\n Sounds good.

We don't know what we're in for in there, so keep an eye out for illusions.\n\n\nPowell:\n Gonna appear as everybody's worst fear. Like Pennywise.\n\n\nReid:\n Wow, Powell, you'll get to see your dad for once!\n\n\nHewitt:\n Nice.\n\n\nPowell:\n Fuck off, Reid, you're- you're \nshort.\n\n\nReid:\n I admit, I'm not half as tall as the stories you tell about the size of your-\n\n\nPowell:\n Hey!\n\n\nHewitt:\n Burn.\n\n\nConley:\n Awfully liberal with your 8 allotted words of the day, are we, Hewitt?\n\n\nHewitt:\n Mm.\n\n\nConley:\n You good, Thirteen?\n1\n\n\nWatts:\n I'm fine.\n\n\nConley:\n Great. Eyes up, everybody. Don't fall for any tricks. Reid and Hewitt, with me. Powell, take the upper South hall. Watts, go with Powell. I want you on the highest vantage point you can get with that sniper, just in case.\n\n\nWatts:\n Got it.\n\n\nPowell:\n Loud and clear.\n\n\n[Lambda-5 splits accordingly.]\n\n\n[The interior of the house is seemingly larger on the inside than the outside, either by illusion or unreality. Plant life grows through the walls and floor.]\n\n\nPowell:\n We found a staircase. Heading- well, heading sideways. See you at the top-or-bottom.\n\n\nConley:\n Roger that.\n\n\n[Footage corrupted, staircase only partially visible.]\n\n\nWatts:\n Ugh. I hate when they do things like this.\n\n\nPowell:\n Don\u2019t we all, newbie?\n\n\nWatts:\n I\u2019ve been here longer than Reid AND Hewitt.\n\n\nPowell:\n Coulda fooled me.\n\n\nWatts:\n I've never choked.\n\n\nPowell:\n First time for everything.\n\n\nReid:\n Leave him alone, Powell. Jesus.\n\n\nWatts:\n First time for you to actually hit a shot, too.\n\n\nConley:\n You can chat in the van, boys. Focus.\n\n\nWatts:\n Sorry.\n\n\nPowell:\n Got it.\n\n\nReid:\n Conley, I found something. A body, most likely.\n\n\nConley:\n Move in. Carefully.\n\n\nHewitt:\n Anchors ready?\n\n\nConley:\n Naturally.\n\n\nReid:\n Confirming life signs; negative.\n\n\nHewitt:\n His face.\n\n\n[Agent Powell enters an open hall with a high ceiling. Several walls have closed wooden doors.]\n\n\nReid:\n Looks like something was eating it.\n\n\nHewitt:\n It's \nbright.\n\n\nConley:\n I\u2019m reading big numbers from that. Minimal interaction for now. Don\u2019t look too hard at it.\n\n\nReid:\n Copy. Tagging it now.\n\n\nHewitt:\n Remember that portal?

The area behind him, previously the top of the staircase, is now a solid, flat wall. Agent Watts is not visible on camera.]\n\n\nHewitt:\n Hey, Conley?\n\n\nWatts:\n Powell, a door just shut on me. Can you grab it?\n\n\nPowell:\n What door? There\u2019s no door. Where are you?\n\n\nConley:\n Eyes up, everybody, we have spacial fluctuations. Keep moving and keep those anchors ready.\n\n\nWatts:\n Powell has the anchor.\n\n\nPowell:\n Yeah, Watts doesn\u2019t have one.\n\n\nReid:\n I don\u2019t have one, either.\n\n\nHewitt:\n I\u2019ve got you, Reid.\n\n\nConley:\n Watts, your priority is to find your way back to Powell, got it?\n\n\nWatts:\n Got it.\n\n\n[Agent Powell's camera angles down to a male corpse, face entirely missing. White light shines from the wound.]\n\n\nPowell:\n Hey, is that dead body of yours glowing?\n\n\nHewitt:\n Just the- bite holes.\n\n\nPowell:\n Then I\u2019ve got another one over here.\n\n\nConley:\n Tag any you find and get back to Watts, Powell.\n\n\nReid:\n Found a third one.\n\n\nWatts:\n Holy shit.\n\n\nConley:\n Find a fourth one?\n\n\n[Agent Powell pauses as he waits for a response.]\n\n\nPowell:\n Respond, Watts.\n\n\nWatts:\n There\u2019s a kid in here.\n\n\nConley:\n Do you have eyes on the anomaly?\n\n\nWatts:\n It\u2019s just a kid, Powell-\n\n\nConley:\n Careful, Watts, certain things tend to do that.\n\n\nWatts:\n I know what I\u2019m looking at, alright?!\n\n\nReid:\n Watts, stay where you are, don\u2019t agitate it-\n\n\nWatts:\n Hey, it\u2019s okay.\n\n\n[Brief noise from Agent Watts's microphone, voice sounds slightly distant.]\n\n\nWatts:\n See? Not gonna hurt you. I\u2019m here to get you out of here safe, alright?\n\n\nReid:\n \u2026Did you just take your helmet off?\n\n\nPowell:\n Jesus Christ, Watts, put your fucking helmet on!\n\n\n[Powell has begun running through the hall, quickly checking doors.]\n\n\n[Each door seems to open to an unseen portal, Agent Powell visible from different angles through each.]\n\n\nWatts:\n She\u2019s just a kid! I don\u2019t want to scare her!\n\n\nConley:\n Put your helmet on now, Watts, that is an order!\n\n\nReid:\n I have eyes on the anomaly! And on Watts! Repeat, eyes on the anomaly!\n\n\nHewitt:\n Anchor it, Reid!\n\n\nReid:\n I don\u2019t have one!\n\n\nPowell:\n Then wound it!\n\n\nWatts:\n I\u2019m not shooting a fucking child!\n\n\nReid:\n That is NOT a child, Watts!\n\n\nWatts:\n I've got this under-\n\n\n[Agent Watts\u2019 microphone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncut\n \ns\n\n\n\n\no ut \n \n \n \n \n \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMISSION\u00a0STATUS:\u00a0FAILURE\n\n\n\n\nwas\u00a0it\u00a0me\n\n\n\n\nNote: While the termination of SCP-6432 deemed the mission a failure, the new anomalous properties exhibited by the creature\u2019s corpse necessitated recovering the body.
