On 4/8/2020, Dr. Kara removed themself from baseline reality and temporally ceased existing.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-5097 was discovered after Foundation .aic units detected a sudden loss of data associated with Dr. Kara\n2\n at 9:58 PM on 4/9/2020. At the same time, several personnel acquainted with Dr. Kara had noticed their lack of activity around the Site, and could neither access past e-mails with Dr. Kara nor send them new ones.\n\n\nAn investigation was launched, revealing their private quarters contained only a handwritten note on their desk (see Addendum). Whom it was addressed to is unknown.\n\n\nAutomated extranormal detection programs deployed by Site Command were able to recognize several residual \nolf\n3\n fluctuations that had occurred within Dr. Kara's quarters. From the readings, a timeline of these fluctuations was established, revealing Dr. Kara had separated themself from baseline reality on 4/8/2020, at approximately 4:25 AM.\n\n\nDr. Kara was designated as SCP-5097 on 4/10/2020, and its containment procedures were officialized shortly after.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The note left by SCP-5097.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry, but I really just didn't feel like coming into work today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5096\n | \nVoidLady\n | \nSCP-5098\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5097\n\" by VoidLady, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
