Plainclothes security personnel are to patrol the area surrounding SCP-1699 regularly, and are to turn away civilians attempting to enter.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1699 is a dormant volcano located northwest of H\u00f3lsfjallavegur, Iceland. It consists of little more than a volcanic vent, approximately one meter in diameter and one-third of a meter tall at its highest point. SCP-1699 is sapient, and is capable of speech via anomalous means.\n\n\nSCP-1699 is willing and able to communicate with attending personnel, and upon first contact expressed a desire to be \"more destructive\" and \"better at being a natural disaster.\" Over the course of its containment, the psychological condition of SCP-1699 has declined \u2014 it appears to have developed an inferiority complex, often comparing itself to other, larger volcanoes in Iceland and other places. Despite this, psychiatric assistance of the entity has been deemed yet unnecessary.\n\n\nAddendum: Interview Logs\n1\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n January 28, 2017\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-1699\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Oh, what's up? Man, visitors always come when you least expect 'em, am I right?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n With whom am I speaking?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n (\nIt laughs.\n) Oh, straight to the point, are we? You can call me, uh\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-1699 is silent for approximately 54 seconds.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, uh, I'm still workin' on a name.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Would 'SCP-1699' suffice?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n 'SCP-1699,' huh? Not exactly fearsome or intimidating, but\u2026 I guess it works. You can call me that.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Good to hear. Now-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n \nS.C.P\u2026 SIXTEEN-NINETY-NINE!\n\n\n(Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson blinks. The lava within SCP-1699 momentarily bubbles before falling still.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Uh\u2026 still workin' on that whole intimidation bit, too. But hey- you flinched, right? Right?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Ah, forget it. Now, uh, whoever you were, what did you say you wanted again?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n SCP-1699, My name is Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson. My team and I will be researching you for the foreseeable future \u2014 this includes interviews, like this one, to get more information on why you're here and what you want.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Aw, dude, an audience? Oh, this is friggin' unbelievable, man, I could \u2014 this is all I've ever hoped for! I- I don't know how to thank you, seriously.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Don't mention it. Now-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Yes, an audience\u2026 \nAN AUDIENCE TO WITNESS THE DESTRUCTION I WORK!\n\n\n(SCP-1699 laughs loudly as the lava within it bubbles. Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson adjusts his glasses and rubs his temples before speaking.)\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n You seem to be\u2026 quite preoccupied with threats of violence.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, I \nam\n a friggin' volcano. What else would I be 'preoccupied' with, ice-fishing? Look \u2014 you look at me, what do you think? What comes to mind? Am I warm and fuzzy? Am I \nnice?\n Hell no, I friggin' ain't, I'm a harbinger of destruction! Violence incarnate! I'm the fire of the earth, coming up from the ground to lay waste to anyone \ndumb\n enough to get close! Got that?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n You're a bubbling puddle of lava.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Oh, touch\u00e9. (\nIt chuckles.\n) You got me. Look, mister, uh, Einjar, was it? I know you're probably a busy, busy man, but\u2026 You think you and your team could, like, help me out? A favor for a favor?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n What is it.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n I've been thinking \u2014 I'm already hot stuff, y'know, but I could be even \nhotter.\n And you and your crew seem to know a lot about my kind\u2026 You think you could, like, coach me?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I'm sorry?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Like, train me. To be more of a natural \ndisaster,\n y'know? 'Cuz right now\u2026 (\nIt sighs\n) seems like I'm just a run-of-the-mill freak of nature, you feel me? I wanna be more \ndestructive\n. More of a volcano! You get me, don't you?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I can't promise that. I'll have to go now, SCP-1699.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n (\nIt laughs\n) Ooh, cold. Well, I'll be here. If you, like, change your mind.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n February 4, 2017\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-1699\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Hello again, SCP-1699.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Hey, Einjar. What's up.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n (\nHe sighs\n) My name is \nEinar.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Yeah, yeah, sorry. What do you want, Einar?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n This is just a check-in. By the way, I can't help but notice \u2014 you seem a bit\u2026\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Bummed? Yeah, guess I am.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I was going to say 'quieter,' but I suppose that works. (\nHe writes something in his notebook.\n) What's the matter, SCP-1699?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, it's \u2014 promise you won't laugh, by the way (\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson nods\n) \u2014 you know those other guys you brought with you? Those lab-coat scientist types?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n My research team?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Yeah, those guys. Well, the other day \u2014 you weren't here, by the way \u2014 I was talking at them, tryin' to get their attention, to scare them, you know? And after a while, one of them comes up, looks at me, and says, like, uh\u2026 'you're no eyy-a-feller-yokel?' Did I pronounce that right?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I believe it's '\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull\n.'\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Yeah, yeah, that's it, thanks. So, like, she said 'you're no Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull,' right, and I'm all like 'what's that?' And would you believe it, the lady \nlaughs\n at me!\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Inconceivable.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n I know, right? So then, after she's had a good chuckle at me, she tells me all about all these other volcanoes, you know, not just this 'Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull,' that I had no idea existed, and like\u2026 (\nIt sighs\n) \nMan\n, I've got a whole lot to live up to, huh? I mean, if I ever wanna make a name for myself\u2026\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, uh\u2026 I've kinda got my work cut out for me, at this point. Y'know that Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, when it erupted, brought air-travel in this part of the world to its knees for weeks? And B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga, with all that hot lava getting everywhere and flowing over everything? And that's just in this century! Don't get me started on what she told me about the others, like Vesuvius and, uh\u2026 Monaha?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n \nMoaha\n?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Yeah, yeah, whatever. It's all just\u2026 It's a lot, you know? A lot to think about. You mind if I cut things off early today? I don't really wanna talk anymore.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I can see why. I'll see you next week, SCP-1699.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Thanks, man. I was getting a bit too heated about all this.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n February 12, 2018\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-1699\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Go away.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n What's wrong, SCP-1699?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n It's nothing \nyou'd\n care about. Leave me alone.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n You'd be surprised.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Ha. This is out of character for you, Einar. Shouldn't you be taking jabs at me, or something?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n (\nHe sighs\n) SCP-1699, I'm sorry you feel that way-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Like hell you are. Go talk smack about me to your \nfriends\n about how useless I am and leave me alone.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Now, hold on \u2014 SCP-1699, nobody but you thinks you're useless. You've been a pl- well, you've been quite the conversation partner, and researching you has brou-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n I don't give a damn about your 'scientific advancements' or 'research' or whatever! Just \ngo away!\n All of you! Since you've come over and set up your stupid campsite around me, all I get is a constant stream of friggin'- trash-talk and insults! I get told on a daily basis by your \nasshole\n scientist friends about how many other volcanoes are out there spewing lava and leveling towns, and you friggin' \nlaugh\n at how that makes me feel!\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I-I'm sorry for not being here when that happened. I can certainly talk to them abou-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n \nI'm not friggin' done.\n I'm tired of being treated like a novelty by you dicks. I'm \ntired\n of spending every day listening to everyone laughing at me when they think I can't hear them. I'm \ntired\n of just being a \nuseless, bubbling puddle of lava\n and knowing that I can \nnever\n be more than that-\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n SCP-1699, just know that I'm truly sorry for all this-\n\n\n(Lava spurts from within SCP-1699. Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson flinches.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n \nLEAVE ME ALONE!\n\n\n(SCP-1699 begins to bubble violently, and some lava overflows onto the surrounding ground. Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson leaves the area. SCP-1699 produces a sound similar to weeping for ten minutes following the event.)\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Following this event, the psychological condition of SCP-1699 notably worsened. It became mostly unresponsive and verbally listless, with its only vocalizations being threats and insults directed at nearby researchers. Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson requested to be moved to Research Outpost 1699-A to act as a full-time research supervisor and to investigate cases of suspected anomaly mistreatment; this request was approved, and Vilhj\u00e1lmsson was able to minimize verbal denigration of SCP-1699 by research personnel by threat of disciplinary action.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Event Log\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n On February 26, 2018, Research Outpost 1699-A was formally declared obsolete due to completion of the construction of Site-687 north of Gr\u00edmssta\u00f0ir, Iceland and the entry of Floating Site 003 (SCPF \nNj\u00f6r\u00f0r\n) into Icelandic waters. Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson requested a shipment of fireworks to \"commemorate the occasion;\" the request was denied, but Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson was allowed the use of fireworks in the area surrounding SCP-1699 provided that he used his own money to buy them.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the events of March 4, 2018, recorded by Junior Researcher \u00deur\u00ed\u00f0ur Helgesd\u00f3ttir on her personal cell-phone.\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Junior Researcher \u00deur\u00ed\u00f0ur Helgesd\u00f3ttir, Associate Volcanologist Ivan Preobrazhensky\n\n\nInvolved Anomaly/ies:\n SCP-1699\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:26:56:\n JR Helgesd\u00f3ttir begins recording. Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson has arranged a series of fireworks to surround SCP-1699, and is in the process of tying a rope to the tents of the outpost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJR Helgesd\u00f3ttir:\n Why do I have to record this, again?\n\n\nDr. Preobrazhensky:\n \n(Off-camera)\n Probably to make sure we don't break any rules, or get anyone hurt. This should be fine, though, I think.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n For the record, let's all consider this unofficial community service for breaking 1699's heart. Now quiet down. I'm almost done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:29:30:\n Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson finishes tying the rope, and JR Helgesd\u00f3ttir moves to sit beside Dr. Preobrazhensky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Preobrazhensky:\n All right. What now?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Just, uh, go with the plan. But make sure 1699 hears it!\n\n\nJR Helgesd\u00f3ttir:\n Man, this is honestly so cute-\n\n\n(Drs. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson and Preobrazhensky shush her, and Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson begins to loudly speak.)\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Gee, what a great day at Research Outpost 1699-A! I sure hope a volcanic eruption doesn't stick a wrench in our research and merrymaking!\n\n\nDr. Preobrazhensky:\n I concur, friend Einar! A volcanic eruption is the very last thing we need! It would certainly ruin our day.\n\n\n(SCP-1699 begins bubbling.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Stop making fun of me.\n\n\nJR Helgesd\u00f3ttir:\n Oh no! Was that a tremor I heard? (\nDr. Preobrazhensky turns to her, silently nodding and holding both his thumbs up.\n)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n You again? \nSeriously?\n Come on, go away.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n This is entirely serious, SCP-1699. We fear the destruction you could bring! We're trembling at the thought!\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Hey, I know you! Einar, shut up and stop saying all that stuff just to make me feel better. It's not working!\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Stop saying that, yourself! I know you've been holding back your true power, just to make \nus\n feel better!\n\n\nDr. Preobrazhensky:\n Exactly! For the love of God, SCP-1699, don't erupt! You'll kill us all!\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n This is friggin' embarrassing. I told you to \ngo away.\n\n\nJR Helgesd\u00f3ttir:\n Mama, come pick me up! I'm scared!\n\n\n(SCP-1699 begins violently bubbling)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n \nFOR THE LAST TIME, SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALO-\n\n\n(Lava flows from SCP-1699, igniting a fuse connected to the array of fireworks. As they explode, Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson pulls the rope, causing Research Outpost 1699-A to collapse. Dr. Preobrazhensky and JR Helgesd\u00f3ttir scream.)\n\n\nDr. Preobrazhensky:\n Oh, the humanity!\n\n\nJR Helgesd\u00f3ttir:\n Oh, Ivan, hold me in our final moments! (\nShe stifles a snicker\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:37:07:\n Drs. Preobrazhensky and Vilhj\u00e1lmsson stand beside JR Helgesd\u00f3ttir, watching SCP-1699. Lava stops flowing from SCP-1699, and it remains silent for two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Uh\u2026 guys?\n\n\n(Dr. Preobrazhensky appears to hold in a sneeze. SCP-1699 begins to laugh.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Oh my friggin' God, did you \nsee\n that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n The day after this event, Dr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson interviewed SCP-1699.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 5, 2018\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Volcanologist Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-1699\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Hello, SCP-1699.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Oh, hey! Man, am I glad you're alive, Einar. I mean you \nsaw\n what happened yesterday, right?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I sure did. Man, this outpost is still reeling from it! So many casualties, so much property damage\u2026 it was horrific!\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n No, it wasn't.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n I-I'm sorry?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n (\nIt sighs\n) Look, man, (\nIt lowers its voice\n) I know you did that for me, and I'm really, \nreally\n thankful you did. Not just because it made me feel better, or anything-\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n You\u2026 don't have to whisper. This isn't really a secret.\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Ah, yeah, right. Well, anyway\u2026 I just want to thank you. For, you know, opening my eyes. So to speak.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, you know\u2026 In the moment, hearing and feeling all those explosions and thinking I created all that death and destruction was, like, the coolest thing ever, right? I felt like a million \nkrona\n, like I was at the top of the world, right? But then, after a while, I started to get really, really, uh\u2026 really lonely. Lonely, and worried, and then I thought I'd killed you all, and I started\u2026 feeling, uh\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-1699 pauses for approximately 54 seconds, producing sounds similar to choked breathing.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n I missed you guys, man! I was lonely, really lonely, and friggin'- friggin' guilty, to top that off! Even though, let's be real here, I kinda thought you deserved it too. (\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson shrugs and nods.\n) You should've heard me, man, I was sobbing out here, over you! But then, like, I guess I was crying loud enough to get the attention of one of the security guards or whatever your guys have patrolling around here, and he came up to me and told me what happened!\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Well, I'm sorry-\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n You don't have to be! Well, anyway, when he told me nobody'd actually died, man, I was the most relieved I'd probably ever been! I mean, I was just, like- you know what they say, 'brimming with joy,' or whatever. If I could cry, man, my eyes would be like fountains back when I heard that, y'know? And that's when I realized\u2026 y'know\u2026 Give me a sec. I gotta figure out how to articulate my thoughts.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n Take as much time as you need.\n\n\n(SCP-1699 is silent for approximately 2 minutes.)\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, I figured out then and there that, uh\u2026 death and destruction look cool from a distance, y'know, the explosions are bigger on the other other side of the fence n' all\u2026 but me, I'm not like that, y'know? I don't have the heart for it. 'Cuz at the end of the day, being a natural disaster isn't cool if you end up killing someone you care about, and the people \nthey\n care about too. (\nIt laughs\n) Man, ain't that cheesy? Still though, truest words I ever said. Am I right?\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n You certainly are, SCP-1699. Does this mean you're feeling better about yourself, now?\n\n\nSCP-1699:\n Well, a little part of me, way deep down, still kinda wants to be more, like, \ndisastrous\n and all \u2014 but I guess \nmost\n of me is happy right here.\n\n\nDr. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson:\n It's certainly good to be down to earth.
