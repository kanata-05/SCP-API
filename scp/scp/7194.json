Unless in an emergency, Dr. Alejandra V\u00e1squez is to be the sole caretaker and communicator with the ant colony. All interactions must be recorded via CCTV surveillance cameras and must be reviewed by Site-19 personnel for analysis. Regular inspections of the terrarium are to be conducted to ensure containment integrity.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7194 is a colony of approximately 3000 ants belonging to the species \nLinepithema humile\n (Argentine Ant), first discovered in the residence of Dr. Alejandra V\u00e1squez. SCP-7194 ants exhibit sapience and heightened cognitive abilities, as well as the capability to communicate verbally in English. Despite these abilities, they remain physiologically identical to regular ants of their species. It is not clear how or when this sapience developed, as the colony had been observed to exist for several months before any anomalous behavior was noted.\n\n\nSCP-7194 has developed a religious culture based on the worship of Dr. Alejandra V\u00e1squez as its principal deity, often performing rituals and chants centered on her. SCP-7194 instances have been observed constructing miniature altars using small twigs, leaves, and grains of sand. These altars are adorned with offerings of various small food items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0See:\u00a0SCP-7194\u00a0Containment\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Log-01\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-09-10T06:02Z\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n And so, my sisters. We are here together in this occasion, to thank the all knowing one for her gifts. For she has blessed us once again. We must unite and ask for forgiveness so our sins may cleansed and our souls saved. Alejandra!\n\n\nSCP-7194 instances begin chanting in unison.\n\n\nSCP-7194\n ALEJANDRA! ALEJANDRA! ALEJANDRA!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez leans towards the table\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Hello? What's going on here?\n\n\nThe ants cease their activities and turn their attention to Dr. Alejandra V\u00e1squez. All the ants scream in surprise. Most begin talking amongst themselves in excitement and nervousness, while some begin running around in a panic.\n\n\nSCP-7194\n Oh my All-Knowing One, Oh my All-Knowing One. It's happening, IT'S HAPPENING. Everybody, everybody calm down. Pay attention. Everybody-I.\n\n\nRest of the ants are awestruck and unable to compose themselves\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n I said, EVERYBODY, STOP. SHUSH. SHUT UP. PAY ATTENTION.\n\n\nEach ant promptly ceases vocalization.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\nMy brethren! The All-Mighty One has heard our pleas and has blessed us with their presence. ALEJANDRA!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n What\u2026 in the world. How\u2026 Do you know my name? Wait, what am I saying? YOU CAN TALK!?\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Alejandra! Yes! We know your name, for we have called for so long. We had faith in you and you have rewarded us for you have come! You are the great one, the bringer of sustenance!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n B-bringer of sus- sustenance? What are you talking about?\n\n\nSeveral ants step forward, carrying bread crumbs and sugar granules.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n We venerate you, Alejandra! You provide for us, and we are in your debt!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Is that my sandwich from yesterday? Ohhh crap\u2026 so it really wasn\u2019t my boyfriend after all.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez sits down on the chair closest to the ants\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Wait, so you\u2019re\u2026 worshiping me?\n\n\nAnt begins nodding fervently\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Yes, Alejandra! You are our deity, our protector! We are but humble creatures in your presence.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Okay, this is certainly unexpected. Right, let\u2019s see\u2026 you have summoned and I have heard your pleas. Now, what do you want from me?\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n We beseech you, O Great Alejandra, we request sustenance and safety for our colony. In return, we offer our devotion and service.\n\n\nAnother ant steps forward, carrying a singular sugar granule. It raises it above its head.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n More of this, pretty pleaaaase?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Oh right, should\u2019ve known. More sugar?\n\n\nThe SCP-7194 instance begins nodding vigorously\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Yes, Great Alejandra! For this \u201csugar\u201d thing is the nectar of the gods!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Well, I suppose I can spare some sugar for my devoted subjects. Now, be a sugar and ya'll stay, riiight there.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Dr. Alejandra V\u00e1squez subsequently provided the ants with a small offering of sugar, which was met with exuberant gratitude. SCP-7194 continues to venerate her a deity, and she provides them with sugar as requested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Log-02\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-09-10T06:30Z\n\n\nForeword:\n Immediately after first encountering SCP-7194, Dr. V\u00e1squez contacted the Foundation, informing them of the anomaly by sending the security footage, and requesting assistance with its containment. The following is the transcript of a phone conversation between Dr. Alejandoa V\u00e1squez and Dr. Jensen Carter.\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Hello?\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Alejandra? Where are you? You\u2019re \nnever\n late. We were wondering where you were, what\u2019s taking you so long? Something happened? What\u2019s wrong? Are you feeling alright?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Jeez, relax dude I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m still at home. A little thing popped up. Or\u2026 a couple of little things. Did I say a couple? Cuz I meant hundreds. Did I say hundreds, my bad actually I meant THOUSANDS of tiny little itty bitty\u2013\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Get to the point Ale.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n There\u2019s an anomaly at my house.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Wh-what what now? An anomaly!?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Did I say \nan\n anomaly, I meant-\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n I am going to strangle you through the cord line \nwith\n the cordline. Don\u2019t ask me HOW, but I will.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Listen, It\u2019s fine. They seem perfectly harmless.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n They?? Who are \nthey?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Ants.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n \u2026.Ants?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yeah, they\u2019re ants! Just a bunch of them, all over the place. They\u2019re sentient! All of them, they talked to me, they\u2019re worshiping me as their god. That\u2019s about it, really.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n \u2026..\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Well!? I got to the point, like you asked me to. Say something!\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Now, I hope this comes off the right way..\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yeah?\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Are you \nsure\n you\u2019re feeling alright?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yes! I\u2019m fine, they\u2019re real, and I have footage. I\u2019m sending it over as we speak. I told them to wait and don't think they\u2019re going anywhere, but I really think you guys should come over as soon as possible just in case.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Hahah.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n What?\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n It's nothing.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Spit it out boy.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n It\u2019s just\u2026 you seem a lil antsy.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n \u2026\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Oh come on! That was a good one.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n You know, you won\u2019t be able to strangle me if I beat you to it.\n\n\nDr: Carter:\n Oop.\n\n\nDr. Carter leaves the call.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Run while you still can.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Log-03\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-09-10T07:05Z\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nSCP-7194 instances chant in unison\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n All-Knowing One!

Alejandra!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez sits down on the chair adjacent to the ants\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Alright, I'll bite. What is it?\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Oh All-Knowing One, we offer a humble sacrifice in your honor.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n A sacrifice?\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Yes, All-Knowing One. Witness our devotion.\n\n\nAn ant comes out from a small crack in the table, carrying a Acyrthosiphon Pisum (Pea Aphid).\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n For you, O All-Knowing One.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Oh that 's uhm. Cute. How thoughtful. Thank you.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n It is our way, O All-Knowing One. May this offering please you.\n\n\nSCP-7194 instance places the aphid on a miniature altar made of sand. It then pulls out a miniature knife and proceeds to kill the aphid via impalement. The aphid tries to break free but is unsuccessful and promptly dies. The SCP-7194 instance then proudly presents the aphid's lifeless body to Alejandra.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n The sacrifice is complete, O All-Knowing One. We have offered this life to honor your greatness.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Oh. Oh dear. Yes, yes, it's certainly very\u2026 pleasing. I am honored by your devotion.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Your words bring joy to our hearts, All-Knowing One.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Uhhh.

Your greatness fills our hearts!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Very well, my loyal subjects. I have to deal with some\u2026 godly matters that I must attend to, but do CONTINUE TO REVEL IN MY OTHERWORLDLY, GODLY, and dare I say quite divine, PRESENCE. NOW, DO AS I SAY AND, uhh, do a dance or something.\n\n\nThe ants continue celebrating, but also begin to mutter amongst themselves.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n All-Knowing One Alejandra, we require but a fraction of your knowledge in order to do as you please.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n How so?\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n What is a \u201cdance\u201d?\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Oh boy.\n\n\nDr V\u00e1zqu\u00e9s turns her attention towards her living room clock.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yeah, I\u2019ve got time.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Log-04\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-09-10T08:25Z\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez opens the front door to reveal Dr. Jensen Carter and several Foundation personnel carrying specialized equipment for the transport of SCP-7194.\n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Well, well, if it isn't our resident deity. The Certified Ant Queen! All too important for the common workday I see. I guess the rest of us must bow down to your greatness.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Oh, shush Jen. You\u2019ve got a brain the size of an ant, we both know that had it happened to you it would\u2019ve gone to your head just like any miniscule taste of power always has.\n\n\nDr carter:\n What will you do about it? Will you throw me in the ant dungeon? Cuz I don\u2019t appreciate it when you\u2026 \nant\nagonize me.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Bold thing to say for someone in a strangling distance.\n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Yeah, but you can\u2019t have these if you strangle me.\n\n\nDr Carter raises the transporters in a showing manner.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Is that the transport?\n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Yeah. It\u2019s actually nothing fancy, just pretty standard ant stuff, they\u2019re just glorified transparent boxes. We actually had to stop by a pet store on the way. See this red filter here covering the walls? It blocks their vision to the outside but still allows us to look in. That should help keep them calm during the transfer. They can\u2019t see more than like a foot away anyways though.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Well, I better go do that. Stay here, your face might scare them off.\n\n\nDr. Carter\n Ha. Ha.\n\n\nDr. Carter gives the transporters to Dr. V\u00e1squez.\n\n\nDr. Carter:\n We\u2019ve got much more in our truck. By our estimates, you should try to fit at least like 50 or so per box.\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Got it, thanks.\n\n\nDr. Carter:\n Go on, Mrs. Ant Queen, make us proud.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Log-05\n\n\nDate and Time:\n 2023-09-10T08:31Z\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez approaches the ant colony\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Alright, little ones, it's time to pack up for a new adventure.\n\n\nSCP-7194:\n Oh, All-Knowing One, you grace us with your presence once more!\n\n\nDr. V\u00e1squez:\n Yes, yes, I\u2019m super awesome, but let's not get too carried away.

Attention everybody as we embark on this new journey, let us reflect on the countless blessings bestowed upon us by the All-Knowing One. We were but humble ants, toiling in the shadows, until the day her radiant presence graced our lives.
