Either that, or you\u2019re the unlucky sap that\u2019s been tasked to rebuild society from whatever dumb fucking bullshit the Foundation has for disasters like this. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t told anything about what\u2019s going to happen in the next few hours. Personally, I don\u2019t think anything is going to help, because only Site-106 and Site-237 are still online, but that\u2019s not really here nor there. And I'm not supposed to be giving my opinions about the situation in an official writ anyway.\n\n\nWhat matters most right now, at this moment, December 4th, 2024, 6:26PM CST, is that I\u2019m able to write this down without the words\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nf\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\na\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nl l\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\ni n g\n3\n\napart at my fingertips. What matters is that I\u2019ve been squirreled away in bunker in the middle of god knows where with only a laptop that allows me to write a coherent file that will be readable, following the basic noospheric laws of linguistics.\n\n\nThe lowdown of the situation is this: we tried everything we could to figure out what it was. The more we attempted to describe it, the more obtuse it became. Definition after definition failed us; first we labeled it as cognitohazard, then as an ontokinetic null factor, until all we were left with forced us to started shoving prefixes together, hoping something stuck. Hoping that whatever language we put to it wouldn\u2019t d e c4y\n4\n into noise, slip between our fingers, destroy the fabric of more concepts or whatever the fuck. I still don\u2019t know if it was attacking anything. I (and sorry, I say \"I\" because I literally don\u2019t have access to any of the reports right now to review what it caused, I\u2019m going straight off my secondhand knowledge of this) still don\u2019t know if it was just there and we poked it too hard? Did it even spread, implying it used to be something small, or did it just manifest and now the only thing spreading is system shutdowns?\n\n\nDammit. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What does is how nothing, and I mean fucking nothing, worked on this thing however it came into whatever. The best antimemes we had couldn\u2019t touch it. Infectious hermeneutics\n5\n were of no use either, and those things cost several miniature XK-class scenarios just to make it to testing. Whatever existential no men clatter\n6\n exists just ends up\u2026it just ends up\u2026\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how to continue writing this. \nI will not continue writing this.\n I will continue writing this because it\u2019s killing me, because I\u2019m wholly convinced\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaa\nconcerned\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nconceited\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nchronic\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\ncorrections\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRight, so I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m not dead yet, which is\u2026cool I guess, but the WiFi stopped working an hour ago, and MTF \naaaaaaaa\n haven\u2019t responded in two. The IV I\u2019m strapped to is supposed to be enough to keep me alive for three years which is like\u2026I don\u2019t know if I want that?\n\n\nUgh, what a bummer.\n\n\nSo this is where it ends, isn\u2019t it? No, that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s too dreary I think, especially for something like this, and maybe there\u2019s actually some real hope for me, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really not sure what to feel. I\u2019m really not sure what to th1 nk. My decade anniversary at the Foundation was coming up in a week, and now everything\u2019s falling apart. Not exactly 345y to breathe consistently when that\u2019s happening, haha.\n\n\nI was supposed to be really happy about that, about making it to double digits for a place like this, because they were going to give me a bonus, a party, a bunch of flowers, but damn it all to hell I gue55. This \nthing\n went and ruined everything, so now I\u2019m stuck plugging away at this stupid device to amuse myself.\n\n\nFuck, my head hurts\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nShit\u2026\n\n\nI wonder if this is what a migraine feels like.

What am I afraid of?\n\n\n12\n. Whoops. Sorry everyone.\n\n\n13\n. Focusing on the what of the what isn\u2019t going to work anymore. It didn\u2019t work figuring out that thing, so what makes me think it will work this time?\n\n\n14\n. How can I move forward? What is propelling me now?\n\n\n15\n. I don\u2019t care if I live or die anymore. Not killing myself for as long as I have has been nothing but anguish, feelings vomiting from that urge defy logic, structure, reason and even\u2026emotion, I fucking guess.\n\n\n16\n. Actually, that\u2019s not true. Words are meant to convey emotions, but when you\u2019re falling apart, what is there for you? Can one transcribe in letters, syllables, base constructs of writing, a scream in any way that matters?\n\n\n17\n. Please just get me out of this hell. Tell me what can be done, and what I\u2019m supposed to do. Please. The instructions left here are too vague.\n\n\n18\n. And yet it\u2019s funny how even if I had directions, following orders makes things worse in your chest. Even when you\u2019re bleeding for purpose in your life, it hurts to start, to get up, to make a new habit. I don\u2019t get the inertia. Why does trying to get somewhere better suck more than being stuck?\n\n\n19\n. If I\u2019m allowed to speculate, and I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m not, I\u2019m guessing this \naaaaaaa\n is something that corrupts sense. Fucking wow, great conclusion, I know, but it\u2019s all I got. It\u2019s all I can\u2026put to it that makes \naaaaaaa\n. Do you realize how much is defined as \u201csense\u201d? As making \u201csense\u201d?\n\nEverything.\n\n\nLiterally everything, because if nothing made sense, nothing would exist.\n\n\n\n\n20\n. It ate my name too. That\u2019s just the news I needed to witness right now.\n\n\n21\n. What is left of me anyway. The self defines \u201csense\u201d, which means whatever that is, it will\u2026\n\n\n22\n. Hey, if we\u2019re talking about what the self is as it\u2019s defined\u2014if you get really cynical about it, all humans can technically be defined as little more than vectors of memetic transmission, puppeted by biological mechanisms. It's quite the dehumanizing way of viewing the topic, but it is a way.\n\n\n23\n. Define defy, and you\u2019ll quickly figure out why refining a defining is akin to a dying silver lining.\n\n\n24\n. So what does that say about my ability to dream?\n\n\n25\n. This is where I am dictated to become useless, where saving myself becomes impossible. And fuck you if you think otherwise, couldn\u2019t you have done something about this sooner?\n\n\n26\n. All of it is here. It's \naaaaaaaaaa\n\n\n27\n. At some point, the human tendency to desire a pattern will fail. It will fail catastrophically, whether physically, or mentally, and the death toll will be akin to a nuclear bomb.\n\n\n28\n. You cannot wring a pattern out of suffering. That is what got us here, I think. This thing is pure senselessness, in all \naaaaaaaaaaa\n of the term. Probably. I wouldn\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n29\n. But that brings me to another point: when something lacks a pattern, we call it a tragedy. Patterns make sense, don\u2019t they? They\u2019re nice and pretty. And when those break, our infinitesimal perspective tells us that means something has gone wrong. Something is breaking down, something has gone against how it\u2019s meant to be. Chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics: all of these are made up of patterns. Social spaces, peer-to-peer communication, conceptualization, linguistics, etymology: these are all made up of patterns too. If they stopped working to the tune of their own codified arrangements, what will we have? What will \naaa\n be?\n\n\n30\n. How much can I blame it? This thing, I mean. because at that point, I\u2019ve lost self-control.\n\n\n31\n. ACTUALIZATION PERCENTAGE: 21%\n\n\n32\n. I wish I didn\u2019t have this.\n\n\n33\n. When I stop feeling useful, I pine for memories of a time where that didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\n34\n. Always terrible.\n\n\n35\n. \naaaaaaaaaa\n\n\n36\n. \naaaaaaaaaa\n\n\n37\n. WARNING! IN THE EVENT OF \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n YOUR LOCALIZED IV DRIP WILL DELIVER A DOSE OF \naaaaaaaaaa\n.",
