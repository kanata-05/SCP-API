The inscription is smudged in several places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 17 January 2032, SCP-6327 was found installed in a hitherto unused service corridor in Temporal Site-01, Sub-Basement-09.\n\n\nA junior advisor to the newly formed Temp/EDDIES\n.\nTemporal Ebb, Disruption, Desynchronization, and Intensification Enquiries Syndicate (Temp/EDDIES)\n An independent office organized in the eventuality that significant convergent temporal paradoxes have inhibited Research and Containment Team \u0394t at some point in the past, present, or future. Such an event would signify they had become compromised at some point in the past, present, or future, thus were/are/will be incapable of protecting the Prime-Timeline on the Foundation's terms.\n \u2014 SCP-6327's discoverer \u2014 sent an immediate distress beacon to the chief Temporal Anomalies official, Director \nDr. Ilse Reynders\n, \nPhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD\n.\n\n\nThe lone security officer on-shift remarked at the time that, although the corridor itself does not have a camera, the stairwell to Sub-Basement-09 does. However, no persons or entities are recorded to have entered the Sub-Basement the week SCP-6327 appeared. This would imply it came into existence spontaneously. With no other explanation as to its appearance, this indicates an unregistered anomalous disturbance had occurred in the single most secure Foundation Site on the planet; demonstrable evidence that it has become compromised.\n\n\nAfter receiving the beacon, Director Reynders placed Temporal Site-01 under immediate spatiotemporal lockdown and ejected the site into extradimensional nullspace. This manoeuvre would have prevented any further anomalies from occurring. In the face of the sudden disappearance of Site-01, however, it left the Prime-Timeline susceptible to transtemporal threats.\n\n\nA fact-finding investigation into SCP-6327 henceforth occurred.\n\n\nThe fact-finding investigation promptly met an impasse: The investigators, who were uninformed as to the nature of the anomaly, read SCP-6327's inscription and refused to proceed further, citing an OSHA breach. The junior advisor, who neglected to fill out a Special Containment Procedures file on the anomaly, was reprimanded for breach of Foundation protocol and placed under time-lock until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[DUPLICATE INFORMATION EXPUNGED]\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the successful documentation and containment of SCP-6327, all requisite paperwork \u2014 including an incident report \u2014 was completed, and forwarded to the on-site RAISA liaison. Director Reynders currently maintains complete control over the investigatory proceedings and will personally oversee experimentation.\n\n\nOne week has now elapsed since the discovery of SCP-6327.\n\n\nAn experimentation log, as recorded in real-time, is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACTION\n\n\nSCP-6327 is opened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUTCOME\n\n\nSCP-6327 becomes ajar. A nondescript masonry wall sits behind it, offset into the finish face by approximately 20\u00a0cm. On the floor adjoining the wall is a single unidentifiable fruit in a state of advanced decay. A Post-it note is affixed between the fruit and SCP-6327.
