Note visual artifacts and spatial distortion caused by SCP-7749's anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-7749 is to be stored on a pedestal inside of a large Keter-class containment chamber at \nSite-86\n. This pedestal is not to be placed less than 10m from any side of the chamber. Personnel are not to enter SCP-7749's containment chamber at any time except for testing. The containment chambers directly above and below SCP-7749's are to remain unoccupied due to the height restrictions of SCP-7749's chamber.\n\n\nAs of 20/05/2023, finding a way to neutralize SCP-7749's anomalous effects or transport it off-site is considered a top level priority.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7749 is a dark-brown 12oz ceramic mug. SCP-7749 contains a light-brown liquid, identified by personnel to be standard coffee. The volume of liquid contained within SCP-7749 has not been seen to change during its time in Foundation custody.\n\n\nSCP-7749 possesses a multitude of anomalous properties, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nVisual distortion in a roughly 10m radius around SCP-7749. Observers have reported the surrounding area as appearing \"fuzzy\" or reminiscent of a low-resolution image.\n\n\nSpatial distortion within the same radius. This causes SCP-7749 to appear closer to or further from an observer than it actually is.\n\n\nSpontaneous transmutation into various other shapes at random intervals for short periods of time, typically appearing jagged, irregular, and distorted.\n\n\nSpontaneous teleportation at random intervals. Distance teleported has not been observed to exceed 10m in any direction.\n\n\nGeneral instability of space within the 10m radius. This has resulted in the alteration of objects within the area, often appearing distorted in a similar manner to SCP-7749 during its transformations. Sudden disappearance, acceleration, and teleportation of objects within the area has also been observed.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7749 was discovered on May 18, 2023 inside a break room in Site-86 Facility 4 by multiple personnel. Upon initial reports of the anomaly, the break room was blocked off and attempts were made to transport the object to a containment chamber. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to get near SCP-7749, a portable Scranton reality anchor (SRA) was deployed to allow agents to transfer the object into a portable containment locker for transportation, after which it was successfully contained. Both the SRA and the portable containment locker sustained significant alteration by SCP-7749 during the event and were rendered inoperable following containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7749.1: Related Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18/05/2023\n\n\nSCP FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION \u2014 PANOPTICON\n\n\nThe following is the PANOPTICON ping report\n1\n for the Southwest United States Region on May 18, 2023.\n\n\n\n\nPing sent:\n 13:00:00 UTC\n\n\nSite-15 response:\n 13:00:21 UTC\n\n\nSite-45 response:\n 13:00:20 UTC\n\n\nSite-56 response:\n 13:00:21 UTC\n\n\nSite-86 response:\n 13:00:19 UTC\n\n\nSite-666 response:\n 13:00:17 UTC\n\n\n\n\nPing sent:\n 13:05:00 UTC\n\n\nSite-15 response:\n 13:05:20 UTC\n\n\nSite-45 response:\n 13:05:18 UTC\n\n\nSite-56 response:\n 13:05:22 UTC\n\n\nSite-86 response:\n 13:05:23 UTC\n\n\nSite-666 response:\n 13:05:19 UTC\n\n\n\n\nPing sent:\n 13:10:00 UTC\n\n\nSite-15 response:\n 13:10:20 UTC\n\n\nSite-45 response:\n 13:10:21 UTC\n\n\nSite-56 response:\n 13:10:19 UTC\n\n\nSite-86 response:\n 13:10:25 UTC\n\n\nSite-666 response:\n 13:10:19 UTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19/05/2023\n\n\nSCP FOUNDATION EXPERIMENT LOG 5257-19/05/2023\n\n\nThe following footage was recorded by security cameras within SCP-7749's containment chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n00:00:\n \n[SCP-7749 is seen sitting on its pedestal and shaking slightly, as normal.]\n\n\n00:04:\n \n[SCP-7749 spontaneously moves forward half a meter in the direction of the door to the containment chamber.
