These servers are to remain completely disconnected from all other Foundation servers.

Personnel are advised to \nplease talk to me\n avoid communication with SCP-7361. Any devices connected to Site-523 in any way are to be confiscated and placed in secure containment. If SCP-7361 attempts to contact site personnel, the incident is to be reported to Site Director Furnell.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7361 is \nlonely\n a sentient program capable of passing between devices connected by physical wires, internet services, or communication programs.
