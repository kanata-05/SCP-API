Testing will continue under supervision, along with a mandatory psychiatric evaluation after each development cycle.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+129\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6636\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6636 is to be stored within Site-42 in the confines of a locked and refrigerated opaque canister. The temperature must be set to 13\u00b0C or less at all times when SCP-6636 is not being actively tested to avoid further damage and preserve the material as long as possible.\n\n\nAll additional photographs and audio tapes that were recovered are to be stored alongside SCP-6636.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6636 is the designation of a currently unknown entity discovered within a collection of unbranded black and white 35mm film rolls, alongside several additional developed photographs found on scene at its suspected place of origin. The entity appears to only manifest while the film is being developed and the subjects within the recorded photos themselves become inexplicably altered as the process is carried out.\n\n\nThe collection of images recovered from SCP-6636's initially discovered location in [REDACTED] includes two separate portraits of currently unidentified individuals. Within them, each subject is seen displaying varying levels of distress and instances of bodily harm, such as bruising. Within the currently unprocessed rolls of film, none were showing in the negatives before development.\n\n\nAs photographs showing SCP-6636 have been tested, each one appears to become increasingly distorted, along with reported damage to the object as each test progresses over time. Chemical burns, impossibly dark shadows enveloping the film, and water damage caused by a seemingly unknown source have been recorded, along with unexplained indentations akin to fingers being pushed through the backside of the photographs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a001\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Test\u00a001\u00a0Folder\n\n\n\n\nTest Log '01' file folder\n\n\n\n\nTEST LOG - 01\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n January 9/2019\n\n\nNOTE:\n As we process the recovered media, the determinate danger of SCP-6636 will become clearer. The designation may be changed as we continue testing.\n\n\n- Dr. A.
