The main entrance will remain locked at all times. Entry is permitted to Foundation personnel with written authorization from Level 3 or higher. All SCP-511 sites will be equipped with remote monitoring equipment allowing for 24 hour surveillance and a continual tracking of the numbers of SCP-511-1 inhabiting the site.\n\n\nAt all times one (1) Class D personnel will be resident in the site. Personnel with this assignment are exempted from monthly termination for the duration of assignment. Candidates for this assignment shall be exclusively drawn from a population of post-menopausal women with a global Clinical Dementia Rating of 2 or greater. \n(Note: due to the exclusive nature of this population, O5-\u2588 has approved recruiting from local hospice and/or nursing homes if necessary. Ref: \nIncident I-511-11\n)\n\n\nThe population of SCP-511-1 within a site must remain within an optimal range of 50 to \u2588\u2588\u2588 individuals. Below this range, adult \nFelis domesticus\n should be introduced to the site to increase population to minimum levels. If population exceeds \u2588\u2588\u2588 individuals, it must be culled immediately. Any SCP-511-1 found outside the containment site shall be euthanized and the remains incinerated.\n\n\nAny biological material leaving the containment site for testing will be handled in accordance with standard protocols for a level 4 biohazard. All specimens are incinerated after testing is complete. Before coming in contact with any material from the containment site, personnel must be inoculated for Influenza, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588, Tetanus, Tick-borne encephalitis, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Full medical workups are mandatory on a bi-weekly basis for personnel working with SCP-511.\n\n\nDescription:\n Instances of SCP-511 typically occur within residential structures with a block or stone foundation that includes a basement or crawlspace. All attempts to remove an instance of SCP-511 from such a residence have proved ineffective. (Ref: \nInterview 511-A\n)\n\n\nSCP-511 is always found associated with a colony of feral \nFelis domesticus\n, common domestic cats. Members of this colony are designated SCP-511-1.\n\n\nSCP-511 is a mass of biological matter taking the form of a large feline, often with extra limbs, eyes, mouths or other organs. It is typically coated with dirt, blood and fecal matter, making its fur appear black despite its actual coloring. (Tests have shown SCP-511\u2019s fur to actually be a random patchwork of various feline coat patterns, colors, and lengths.) SCP-511\u2019s mass varies from 10kg to over 50kg, roughly in proportion to the number of SCP-511-1 in the associated colony. The tissue that makes up this mass consists primarily of the bodies of deceased SCP-511-1. The portion of SCP-511 that does not comprise SCP-511-1 consists of other biomass; small rodents, various plant materials, insects and insect larvae, black mold, a human [DATA EXPUNGED]. Incorporation of dead tissue into SCP-511 does not appear to slow the normal process of decay. Different areas of SCP-511 undergo different stages of biodegradation at any given time; some areas show little more than lividity, while other areas may show active carrion insect infestation, and some areas may even show liquefaction of tissues. \n(Note: Researchers have described SCP-511 making a \u201cpurring\u201d sound. Tests have shown this sound does not originate with SCP-511, but is actually the sound of insects, most often blowflies, trapped within its mass\u2014 Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588)\n\n\nSCP-511 prefers to inhabit dark spaces with a relatively high humidity, such as old basements and crawl spaces. It will continually scavenge its immediate area for new biomass to incorporate into itself, displacing and expelling matter that has decayed past mechanical usefulness.\n\n\nExamples of SCP-511-1 resemble ordinary \nFelis domesticus\n that have undergone extreme neglect. They display a body condition score of 2 or 1, regardless of the amount of food available. Ulcerated skin is common, as are parasitic infestations, tumors, and various viral and bacterial infections. (SCP-511-1 are known carriers of a particularly virulent strain of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.) A typical SCP-511-1 shows no interest in grooming itself, and has patchy and matted fur. It is unclear to what extent the physical condition of an SCP-511-1 is a result of the influence of SCP-511, and to what extent it is due to sub-optimal living conditions.\n\n\nSeveral observations have been made of an SCP-511-1 retrieving biomass from elsewhere and bringing it to SCP-511 to be incorporated.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Incident report of containment breach at Site 511-\u2588\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a0I-511-11\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a0I-511-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument# I-511-11\n\n\nPersonnel involved:\n D-7856, male subject 35 years of age.\n\n\nDate:\n 08/27/19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nLocation:\n Site 511-\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Evergreen Way, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, California.\n\n\nDescription:\n After determining that a permanent human presence at a SCP-511 site results in moderation of aggression in SCP-511-1, containment protocol is updated to require class D personnel reside on-site in the event the original homeowner is deceased. Six months after this policy is established, D-7856 is assigned to Site 511-\u2588. As expected, within a week, aggression levels of SCP-511-1 toward Foundation personnel lessen considerably.\n\n\nSixteen days after being assigned to Site-511-\u2588, D-7856 begins showing signs of increased aggression; verbally abusing Foundation personnel and engaging in superficial vandalism of Site-511-\u2588. D-7856 is reprimanded.\n\n\nEighteen days into his assignment, D-7856 interferes with a Foundation team by throwing garbage and yelling obscenities. D-7856 is subdued with a tranquilizer dart and locked in his quarters.\n\n\nAt twenty days, D-7856 begins capturing SCP-511-1 and [DATA EXPUNGED] is only discovered when a Foundation research team enters for routine specimen collection 48 hours later. The team discovers remains from 37 separate SCP-511-1 collected in the kitchen. Bodies are dismembered and show signs of [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nD-7856\u2019s body is discovered in the basement after an apparent attempt to [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSite 511-\u2588 is incinerated as an emergency containment procedure.\n\n\nOk, I think there\u2019s something to the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d idea.

Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We were tasked to retrieve a 40 kilo\u2026 thing\u2026 with a BSL4 containment unit. You know how big those units are? Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I know the specifications. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Like lugging a self-propelled washing machine. Now imagine dragging one of those into one of these places. You already got reduced mobility from the hazmat suit, got fifty kilos of gear, and you\u2019re walking into a house that has two or three decades worth of garbage in it. We have cat \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ankle deep in places, trash bags split open, piles of soggy newspaper and junk mail, boxes of clothes, furniture that looked like it exploded, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cats everywhere\u2014 eyes everywhere\u2014 Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can we return to the containment unit? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We have \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 chest high in places, cats everywhere, and spaces so tight that we have to go single file. No way a guy in full gear can turn around, and forget the containment unit. Just one look and there\u2019s no way we can use [DATA EXPUNGED] Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So it was Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s idea? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It was that, or pack it in. Can\u2019t get downstairs. So we bait the unit with the body and point it at the basement door. According to the briefing, it would be attracted to freshly dead\u2026 biological matter. Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And SCP-511 was attracted to the baited unit? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The most nerve-wracking twenty minutes of my life, listening to that thing pull itself upstairs. Thud, thud, thud. And those cats, watching us. You know how freaky cat eyes look with night vision equipment? Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: So you captured SCP-511? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: [laughs] Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened then? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We got out as quickly as we could. No one can turn around, so we back out, all those eyes watching us. Staring\u2026 Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You were first out the door? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Last in, first out. We all got out, for all the good it did. We thought we\u2019d pulled it off. But the moment the containment unit rolled out the door\u2026 it\u2026 they\u2026 Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You ever see films of explosive decompression? That\u2019s what happened to it. Splattered itself all over the insides of the containment unit. And those cats, those \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 awful cats. They howled. Then they rushed us. Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Did you attempt to contain the breach? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You\u2019re kidding? Right? Two or three hundred of them? Not just the door, but the windows, dropping on us from the second floor. When I saw \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 disappear under them, I just ran and locked myself in the van. I\u2019m not proud of that\u2026 Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I\u2019m not here to judge. I\u2019m here to determine what happened, so it does not happen again. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Well, you see what happened to me? That was one of them that got locked in with me. One. If you don\u2019t reclassify these things Keter, you\u2019re insane. Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I will be recommending updates to containment procedure. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah, while you\u2019re updating things, there\u2019s something else you need to update. Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What\u2019s that? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The briefing was all about how SCP-511 is influencing these cats. That\u2019s wrong. Dr. A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: How so? Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-511 doesn\u2019t influence anything. It\u2019s the cats. They made SCP-511. And they made it because they hate us. <End Log> Closing Statement: Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died three days later from complications due to blood poisoning. Three weeks after containment breach, a new incidence of SCP-511 was identified in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Ohio, 35km south-east of Site 511-47. Remote biopsies of this new incidence revealed genetic material identified as coming from three Agents of Mobile Task Force \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588. It seems that the \u201cdestruction\u201d of SCP-511 might only displace it elsewhere. Until we better understand the vectors that propagate it, all SCP-511 need to be contained in place. Request for reclassification of SCP-511 to Keter is denied \u2014 O5-\u2588",
