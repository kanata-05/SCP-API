Interaction with SCP-4585 requires Level 2 or higher security clearance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4585, physically, is a standard hamburger made by the Steak 'n Shake Corporation. SCP-4585 is sapient, and can speak in German via a voice of unknown origin. This voice has reached a maximum of 142\u00a0dB. SCP-4585 is also capable of using the five senses\n1\n and will not decompose. SCP-4585 can voluntarily cause SCP-4585-1 manifestation events, but is unable to cause a manifestation event if less than one month has elapsed since the last one. SCP-4585-1 manifestation events can number a maximum of 25 manifestations.\n\n\nPhysically, SCP-4585-1 instances are smaller than SCP-4585, but otherwise identical. In addition to SCP-4585's anomalous properties, SCP-4585-1 instances also possess the ability to generate french fries. They utilize said french fries in a similar fashion to a throwing spear. SCP-4585-1 instances use telekinesis to throw these weapons, but have not shown this ability on other objects. The french fry will demanifest after it is thrown.\n\n\nIn the event that the meat of an SCP-4585-1 instance is completely separated from the rest of the rest of the hamburger, all anomalous effects of that individual instance will cease. It is presumed that a similar effect takes place on SCP-4585 itself.\n\n\nNeither SCP-4585 or SCP-4585-1 instances are capable of locomotion.\n\n\nAddendum 4585-1:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a04585-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a04585-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4585\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Researcher Johnson\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted 12 days following SCP-4585\u2019s discovery and containment. The interview has been translated into English.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Hello SCP-4585, I would like to ask you some questions.\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Who are you?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Alex Johnson, can I ask some questions?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n \n(pause)\n If you insist, I will humor you, what would you like to know?\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Where did you come from? Were you created at the Steak 'n Shake where we found you?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Oh, heavens no. I was born in my great city of Hamburg.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Uh, is that the Hamburg in Germany?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Of course! No other city can touch its beauty! I am fortunate enough to be the city's rightful duke. You must sense that you are in the presence of great royalty, my friend.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Uh-huh, of course you are. If you originated in Germany, how did you end up a continent away?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n I swam.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n \n(pause)\n But, you can\u2019t move.\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n I am the Duke of Hamburg.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Can\u2026 how does that affect anything?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n I don\u2019t follow.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Uh, whatever. We can return to that a little later. Are your \n(pause)\n subjects \n(pause)\n also like you? As in-\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Our appearance? Yes! That is part of what makes Hamburg so great! After all, it's a lot easier to catch this world\u2019s criminals if they cannot move.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n that\u2019s no- whatever. That's useful too, I guess. Is everyone in that place like you?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Yes.\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Then how do you catch criminals? Actually, scratch that, how does the whole thing operate?\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n I can assure you, our justice system is very effective. I don't even get involved! Just in case I feel the urge to do injustice on my citizens! Isn't that great!\n\n\nJunior Researcher Johnson:\n Sure, but, how does the city operate? I mean, nobody can move, you wouldn't be able to do anything other than sit around.\n\n\n[Approximately 4 seconds of silence]\n\n\nSCP-4585:\n Excuse me, but are you threatening to incapacitate Hamburg!

Testing on the SCP-4585-1 instance was approved. For details on these tests, see Document 4585-T1. Due to Junior Researcher Johnson's lack of professionalism and tendency to provoke SCP-4585, he has been reprimanded and transferred to another project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4585-2:\n\n\n\n\n+Security\u00a0Log\u00a0836-8\n\n\n\n\n-Security\u00a0Log\u00a0836-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The following recording was taken from Site-50 Security Camera #836, located in SCP-4585's old cell.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n<07:33:12>\n SCP-4585-1 Manifestation Event occurs, 22 SCP-4585-1 instances manifest inside the cell.\n\n\n<07:33:20>\n SCP-4585 begins vocalization with the SCP-4585-1 instances.\n\n\n<13:55:56>\n Security guard John Trockies enters SCP-4585's cell on a routine sweep of Site-50's Safe Wing.
