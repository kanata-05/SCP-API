Personnel affected by SCP-6379 are to be amnesticised and given proper psychiatric treatment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6379 is the designation given to a humanoid entity that currently appears around the outskirts of the town of Caherkeen in Co. Cork, Ireland. It is identical in appearance to a normal human, but notably carries a tobacco pipe at all times.\n\n\nDespite this, SCP-6379 has been described by locals as a type of Sidhe fae, specifically the \ngancanagh\n. In folklore, the gancanagh is a male fairy with the intent of seducing men and women. The Foundation was notified of SCP-6379 after various cases of personnel in the town dying of malnutrition.\n\n\nSCP-6379 randomly manifests within the vision of personnel. When SCP-6379 is touched, personnel are affected by a cognitohazard caused by unknown toxins secreting from SCP-6379\u2019s skin, which makes them inexplicably attracted to SCP-6379. Personnel affected are reported to neglect basic necessities due to their infatuation with SCP-6379.\n\n\nAddendum 0.1_6379: Discovery\n\n\nOn 08/07/2021, Agent Cloch and Agent Toinne were assigned to investigate and acquire information on a SCP-6379 sighting on an unnamed bridge near the Travaud Strand.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n: Caherkeen in Co. Cork, Ireland.\n\n\nInvestigators\n: Agent Cloch and Agent Toinne\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n[Footage of Agent Cloch driving. Out of the window, it is mostly green fields, occasionally passing colourful cottages. The sky is clear.]\n\n\nToinne\n: Always liked the country. Haven\u2019t been around much of Munster.\n\n\nToinne\n: \u2026So, what\u2019s the Foundation doing messing with the, uh\u2026 (whispers) fae?\n\n\n[Cloch is silent.]\n\n\nToinne\n: (\nSighs\n) Boring old Mr. Rock. Please, enlighten me on your secret to staying so incredibly drab.\n\n\nCloch\n: \u2026I\u2019m just very focused.\n\n\nToinne\n: That isn\u2019t true. Your thumbs have been twiddling since we were assigned this case.\n\n\nCloch\n: No- \u2026My mother says I\u2019m a very good child when I\u2019m quiet.\n\n\nToinne\n: Calm down, mammy\u2019s boy! Look, there\u2019s the stream with the bridge. Let\u2019s move.\n\n\n\n\n[Agent Cloch stops the car close to the bridge of the supposed SCP-6379 sighting. An old woman leans on the cracked stone wall.]\n\n\nToinne\n: Be careful, Cloch. \u2026It could be a f\u2026shapeshifter.\n\n\nCloch\n: You are too superstitious.\n\n\n[The woman approaches.]\n\n\nO\u2019Brien\n: Ye really are. What\u2019re you here for?\n\n\nToinne\n: (\nCoughs\n) Apologies. That information is classified.\n\n\nO\u2019Brien\n: I\u2019m Siobh\u00e1n O\u2019Brien, anyway. What\u2019re yous doing here?\n\n\nCloch\n: \u2026What do you know about the gancanagh?\n\n\n[Siobh\u00e1n whistles, then glances over at the bridge. Leaves on the trees move slightly as a weak breeze starts. Toinne\u2019s bodycam is fixed on the woman. Cloch appears unamused.]\n\n\nO\u2019Brien\n: I know as much as anyone else. That type of leprechaun does nothing but hurt\u2026 I don\u2019t understand its motives. You know what? Feckin\u2019 bastard, that\u2019s what it is.\n\n\nToinne\n: Have you encountered it?\n\n\n[Siobh\u00e1n gets up from the wall, then walks over to Cloch. She puts a thin hand on his shoulder, maintaining eye contact.]\n\n\nO\u2019Brien\n: You look like you don\u2019t care what kind of power they hold. Are you listening to me? One touch, now, just \none\n touch, and you\u2019re completely helpless. It appears as the man of your dreams, and then it crushes them. Do you hear me?\n\n\nCloch\n: Of course. But look at me, miss.\n\n\n[He kneels down to Siobh\u00e1n's height.]\n\n\nCloch\n: I assure you, we will find what has been terrorising your town and lock it up. We will contain it. You don\u2019t need to worry.\n\n\nO'Brien\n: Stop acting the maggot! Have you even met a fae, youngin? You will absolutely NOT 'contain' it, that is extremely rude!\n\n\n[Toinne sighs, looking around at the hills and clouds. There is an unidentified figure on the bridge. Toinne turns to Cloch.]\n\n\nToinne\n: I\u2019m going over to that guy!\n\n\n[Footage shows Cloch with his hands behind his back, rubbing his knuckles. Siobh\u00e1n seems to be telling him off. Toinne approaches the bridge.]\n\n\n\n\n[The figure smiles. It holds an unlit pipe between its teeth, wearing a white shirt and brown waistcoat. A hat is pulled over its eyes. Toinne walks over cautiously.]\n\n\n6379\n: It\u2019s a fine day, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nToinne\n: \u2026It is. What is your business here?\n\n\n6379\n: Just cloud-watching. Join me, love.\n\n\n[Toinne keeps her distance, watching intently. The figure removes it\u2019s pipe from its mouth and puts it in its pocket.]\n\n\n6379\n: Hm? Is something wrong?\n\n\nToinne\n: Not at all.\n\n\n6379\n: Really? Your face is quite red.\n\n\nToinne\n: Wh-no! It\u2019s not\u2026is it? Because maybe I\u2019m just- I\u2019m just naturally very red.\n\n\n6379\n: (\nLaughs\n) Don\u2019t fuss over it. It\u2019s hay fever season.\n\n\n[It exhales.]\n\n\n6379\n: It\u2019s cute, too. Do you get complimented often?\n\n\nToinne\n: \u2026You\u2019re completely confident you won\u2019t get punched right now?\n\n\n6379\n: (\nPlaces hand on chin\n) You wanna try? \u2026Or are you sure you\u2019re not just embarrassed?\n\n\n[Toinne folds her arms. She slowly paces towards the entity. It smiles and takes off its hat.]\n\n\n6379\n: Stay with me for awhile. Surely a girl as smart as you knows when to relax.\n\n\nToinne\n: You\u2019re just saying that- oh- you got a bug in your hair.\n\n\n6379\n: (\nPanicked\n) GAH! Would you get it for me?!\n\n\nToinne\n: Sure-\n\n\n[Toinne reaches for the bug. The breeze picks up slightly.]\n\n\nCloch\n: (\nYelling\n) Toinne! Get back!\n\n\n[Toinne stops to turn over to Cloch, who is seen running up to her. She is holding a bug in her hand.]\n\n\n[Cloch pulls her away from where the entity was standing. The entity has vanished.]\n\n\nCloch\n: Toinne, did you touch it? Are you okay?\n\n\nToinne\n: (\nStumbles back\n) Get off of me! Where is he, where did he go?! He can't leave me, I love him!\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nAfter the discovery of SCP-6379, Agent Toinne was severely affected by the effects of SCP-6379. Reported by Agent Cloch as acting \u2018frantic and panicked\u2019, she was administered Class A amnestics and suspended from duty for the time being.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 0.2_6379: Further Investigation Into The Motives Of SCP-6379\n\n\nOn 16/07/2021, Agent Cloch was sent to initiate further contact with SCP-6379, and to contain it if possible.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n: Caherkeen in Co. Cork, Ireland.\n\n\nInvestigator\n: Agent Cloch\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n[Cloch is standing on the same bridge from the previous SCP-6379 sighting. He is visibly frustrated, looking down to fidget with his hands. The sky is overcast.]\n\n\n[SCP-6379 manifests sitting on the bridge when Cloch turns his head. He flinches and takes a step back at the sight of the entity.]\n\n\nCloch\n: This better not be a waste of time.\n\n\n6379\n: Why would it be? We\u2019re just having a nice chat, aren\u2019t we?\n\n\nCloch\n: \u2026Do you do this on purpose? I bet it\u2019s funny to you. You\u2019re vile.\n\n\n[The entity sighs, hunching over and swinging its legs. It smiles fondly.]\n\n\n6379\n: I do it for fun. Something about heartbreak is so fulfilling, you know?\n\n\nCloch\n: I do not. Why is it, um, fun?\n\n\n6379\n: Hm\u2026 You\u2019re dumb, I like you. I get a good feeling from toying with humans, I guess. It makes me feel close to them. The all-consuming intimacy of obsessive love, the passion of empty words\u2026 It\u2019s a form of art, don\u2019t you think?\n\n\n[Cloch clenches his fist. The entity purses its lips.]\n\n\n6379\n: Don\u2019t you think? That was a question.\n\n\nCloch\n: Huh-wh-no, I don\u2019t\u2026think.\n\n\n6379\n: That\u2019s obvious. The men I converse with in the taverns do, though. I tell them about who I\u2019ve conquered, and they are happy to say the same. They think it\u2019s an achievement, to break the most hearts, and well, I wholefully encourage it! My, it\u2019s an interesting mindset!\n\n\nCloch\n: \u2026How come we have never gotten reports of you in pubs?\n\n\n6379\n: Listen to your elders, buachaill! That lady knew of Sidhe, and yet you dismiss her like she was talking gibberish. It is because I morph, and appear completely ordinary to people not under my trance. They are none the wiser!\n\n\n[It chews on the end of its unlit pipe. Cloch shakes his head.]\n\n\nCloch\n: I just don\u2019t understand. This must be a personal playground to you, right?\n\n\n6379\n: You\u2019re sorely mistaken. Before this cursed age, when fae were at their strongest, it might\u2019ve been. But now, I indulge in it to understand the darkest parts of the human psyche.\n\n\n\u2026It has bothered me. I\u2019m getting weaker as the years pass, as less people believe in and fear us. My weakness may have been the reason your partner was compelled so slowly. She did me a favour, too. I am in debt to her.\n\n\nCloch\n: What do you mean?\n\n\n6379\n: She got a bug out of my hair, and I\u2019m\u2026 they are not my favourite thing on this earth.\n\n\nCloch\n: You\u2019re afraid of bugs?\n\n\n6379\n: (\nStammering\n) T-that is besides the point! What matters is that she had her heart set on someone else.\n\n\nCloch\n: Toinne is a friendly person in general. It seems obvious, now I think about it.\n\n\n6379\n: Didn\u2019t you see her odd little\u2026what is it, \u2018camera\u2019 images? The woman said I appear as the perfect man to whoever sees me, correct?\n\n\n[The entity grins. Cloch furrows his brows, puzzled.]\n\n\nCloch\n: What are you smiling at?\n\n\n[It sighs.]\n\n\n6379\n: Are you thick?! I remember I turned into a man who looked eerily like \nyou\n. Do you get it now? Have you got the message, or are you slow as a snail?\n\n\n[Cloch rubs his knuckles.]\n\n\nCloch\n: Well, that doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2026\n\n\n6379\n: (\nMocking\n) \nOooh, I don\u2019t understand\n! C\u2019mon lad, it\u2019s so obvious. I can tell she\u2019s been making a move for ages but you\u2019ve been taking it too literally. Loosen up a bit!\n\n\n[Cloch looks down at his feet. His palms are noticeably sweaty.]\n\n\nCloch\n: \u2026I didn\u2019t know she felt the same way. Maybe I should\u2026I dunno.\n\n\n6379\n: You seem like a respectable fella. I had forgotten there is maybe a sweet side to humans\u2026 Farewell.\n\n\n[Cloch looks up. The entity is nowhere to be seen. A soft breeze comes and goes.]\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 0.3_6379: Status Update\n\n\nAs of 01/08/2021, there have been no further reports on the whereabouts of SCP-6379.
