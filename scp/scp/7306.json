The air is warm and damp, and I can feel the fabric of my dress shirt begin to stick to my skin. Frustrated and impatient, I continue to wander the halls until I find a strange, unmarked double door that stands out amongst the rest.\n\n\nI take out my keycard labeled \nEthics Committee Member \u2014 08\n and press it to the keycard scanner as it makes a happy chime. The scanner turns green, and the door makes a loud clicking sound. I look around me, left and right, seeing the empty corridors and their blinding overhead lights.\n\n\nI'm alone.\n\n\nI grab the handle and pull the door open, letting the light from the hall pierce the darkness that tries to cower in the corners of the room. In the middle of the room was a metal cabinet desk, lit only by a sole ceiling light hanging above. I enter and close the door behind me, hearing the door click and lock shut.\n\n\nI'm not alone.\n\n\nI look towards the camera that's attached in the top right corner of the dimly lit room, staring at me. Its lenses focus on my face, scanning and storing my faceprint. They would know I was here. I look across the dark room and see several offline sentries standing at parade rest. I can't even imagine how many interns lost their lives accidentally stumbling in here. I walk to the desk and sit in the chair, seeing the lockbox, a folder, and a computer terminal gathering dust. The folder piqued my interest immediately, its contents marred by numerous redactions. I could hear my shallow breaths stagger as I rifle through the documents, my eyes darting through, skimming the contents before moving on to the next page.\n\n\nMy curiosity tempted me even further.\n\n\nI put the folder down, as it didn't contain anything of use to me, and stared at the dusty LED screen of the terminal. I reach into my suit pocket and grab a small rag as I wipe the screen. Once I was done, I began to fold it, but I hesitated and threw it onto the floor. It's too dirty to put it back in my pocket.\n\n\nI raise my finger towards the terminal and press the blinking power button. The screen flickers and whirs to life, showing me the oh-so-familiar logo\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFaceprint Detected \u2026\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nThe following file is Level 5/7306 classified.

No Foundation personnel, except for the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, are to know of the existence of SCP-7306. The Director of Site-02 is to be informed of the containment procedures of SCP-7306 but not its descriptive function to reduce information leaks. All documents, digital or physical, are to be stored in SCP-7306's storage unit and never displaced from the room.\n\n\nSCP-7306 is to be contained in an unmarked private storage unit at Site-02. Multiple targeting systems and devices scanning the room controlled via Site-02's A.I. system have been installed for security purposes. Due to previous incidents, no other Foundation or site personnel are to test or use SCP-7306 for any reason.\n\n\nContinuous utilization of SCP-7306 will cause rapid mental deterioration and will require psychological evaluation and therapy. It is recommended any future use of SCP-7306 is limited to one use to avoid \n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7306 is a blank, pristine polaroid film with no distinctive identifying marks, that is impossible to be damaged or destroyed. It exhibits no visual anomalous properties until held by a human subject with average memory retention and mental acuity. The blank image is then slowly replaced by an image the subject is familiar with, usually a prevalent moment in the subject's life.\n\n\nOnce the image has been fully colorized in the film, the subject will be unresponsive to any interaction or communication for a short period of time. Their consciousness will then transfer to the time period to which they have traveled and experience a duration ranging from one to twenty-four (1-24) hours before their consciousness spontaneously returns to their physical body. After said subjects' consciousness returns, opening SCP-7306-2 will reveal a new polaroid film (-A to -G), containing no anomalous properties, capturing a random moment the subject was photographed as well as a new entry in the journal found in SCP-7306-2.\u00a0\n\n\nSCP-7306-2 is a small steel lock box that contains SCP-7306-A to -G, a photographer's journal, several used pencils that are utilized each time SCP-7306 is activated, and a replacement lens for a polaroid camera. The journal describes events that SCP-7306-3, the photographer, has photographed and logged. It is unknown if the photographer has written down the interaction in the journal as a warning or if the journal itself is the anomaly manipulating spacetime.\n\n\nSCP-7306-3 is a Caucasian male; records indicate his name to be Pater Beard, a famous photographer who has been missing since 2020 and was found dead in Camp Hero State Park. No other information of the photographer, SCP-7306-3, is known at this time. \nlies\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7306 Addendums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListed below are logs, audio recording transcripts, and other information about SCP-7306 that do not fit above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7306-2\u00a0Retrieval\n\n\n\n\n7306-2\u00a0Retrieval\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary\n: SCP-7306-2 was found in Montauk, Long Island, on Pater Beard\u2019s (MIA) property and was immediately recovered when his family reported his wife found a strange lockbox that gave her vivid dreams of her late husband. All witnesses were interviewed and were given amnestics shortly after object retrieval. The following is an audio log recorded during the execution of Operation \"Tag and Bag\", conducted by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\") with interference from Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\").\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n \n\n\nEP-6 \u201cCitadel\u201d\n: This is Citadel 1-1 to Overwatch.

Regarding Epsilon-6 Lieutenant \"Sentinel\", they are currently undergoing psychological treatment for injuries sustained during interaction with SCP-7306. Apart from this, SCP-7306-3's body remnants have been found in a densely wooded area in Camp Hero State Park. The body was examined, and forensics showed Pater Beard's mind died before his physical body began to decompose. What remained of the body was shortly handed over to local authorities and family members for burial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExperiment Logs\n\n\nPurpose\n: Determine the extent and purpose of SCP-7306. All experiments were conducted with subjects of mixed backgrounds, which included: but were not limited to, age, ethnicity, family, and criminal history. All experiments were authorized by the O5 Council as well as the Ethics Committee (which was represented by EC-08). Listed below are only starred experiments for future research and/or investigations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\n \u2014 \"The Soldier\"\n\n\nSubject\n: \nSubject #D82718\n, Afghanistan War veteran, age twenty-nine (29). Convicted of armed robbery and homicide of law enforcement officers and mutable counts of 2nd-degree homicide. Caucasian, only child with two (2) married parents.\n\n\nResult\n: Subject #D82718 used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 7 seconds. After the subject returned, they were unresponsive for 2 days. They recalled being back in Afghanistan, where he previously failed to save his former squad mate from oncoming fire from enemy forces. They attempted to save his former squad mate but ended up failing again. The subject requested to use SCP-7306 a second time but was denied and reassigned to regular duties.\n\n\nSCP-7306-3 Journal Entry\n: This photograph shows extreme dedication and the love of brotherhood, but sometimes the outcome we want is just confined to dreams. Reality is much too harsh.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperiment 5\n \u2014 \"The Student\"\n\n\nSubject\n: Amir Bugti, a current college student at Harvard University, age twenty-one (21). Pakistani, no siblings, and two (2) married parents.\n\n\nResult\n: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 4 seconds. After returning, they were immediately responsive and cooperative with Foundation staff. They recalled being back on campus where he was shortly asked if he would like to go to a party hosted by the unofficial \u03b1\u03c3\u028a fraternity. They noted he declined the offer previously but accepted it in this case due to regretting not being involved in \"college activities\". He remembered inviting a few of his friends to party and relax after Friday classes. Upon looking at his record, it is shown he was arrested for simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs as well as drug-induced homicide. Three out of five individuals who were present during that time overdosed and died before paramedics could arrive. Campus police caught and detained Amir Bugti, charging him and those who rented the property. When the subject was informed of what he did, he refused to believe the Foundation staff. Staff then ended the experiment and returned him to MCI-Cedar Junction \n(Note: Subject was \nnot\n charged prior to using SCP-7306)\n.\n\n\nSCP-7306-3 Journal Entry\n: In an effort to live life to the fullest, the young adult did the opposite and killed his future. Disappointing.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperiment 9 / Incident CI-7306\n \u2014 [\nUnauthorized\n]\n\n\nSubject\n: Mitch Kang, Security Chief for Site-02, age forty-three (43). Asian, no children or spouse.\n\n\nResult\n: On 09-02-2023, Security Chief Mitch Kang was found frantically sobbing and shaking in SCP-7306\u2019s previous containment chamber for a long period of time. Once calmed down, they were questioned and put into quarantine for further analysis. During further investigation, Security Officer Mitch Kang admitted to working as an informant for multiple hostile factions towards The Foundation, most prominently the Chaos Insurgency. His actions led to the breach in containment of many SCP subjects which caused a K-Class scenario. In an effort to reverse the situation and danger he put himself in, he used SCP-7306 on his own accord.\n\n\nSCP-7306-3 Journal Entry\n: Cornered by foxes and wolves, the little piggy had no choice but to be devoured. Very humorous\u2026 I might even frame this one.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperiment 11\n \u2014 \"The Father\"\n\n\nSubject\n: Kelvin Mikel, United Airlines Pilot, age fifty-three (53). African American, no current children (1 dead), divorced.\n\n\nResult\n: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 9 seconds. They were unresponsive for an estimated 11 hours. During the interview, the subject recalled being on duty and walking to his appointed terminal. He then received a familiar call from his ex-wife, telling him their sixteen-year-old child was robbed and then stabbed on the way home from school. They immediately ran towards the nearest available vehicle and left for the hospital where she was being treated. When they were told what he had done previously, he mentioned remaining on duty and continuing his flight. He noted,\" This didn't change anything. This put fire to a once-dying memory.\"\n\n\nSCP-7306-3 Journal Entry\n: No father should ever outlive their child, but if so, they should be in your arms than in Death's.

Due to the unethical consequences SCP-7306 brings, SCP-7306 is to remain in its containment chamber, and no Site-02 personnel, specifically research personnel, are allowed inside. Cleaning crews and security personnel are the only exceptions to this order.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a0IMF-7\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a0IMF-7\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncident IMF-7\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary\n: On 10/03/2023, Senior Researcher Michael Olson, Assistant Researcher Kyle Jacobson, Assistant Researcher Brooke Bayfield, and several other Site-02 staff were discovered to have used SCP-7306 with malicious intent for personal gain. No experiments were conducted with the necessary approval by the Ethics Committee, and several resulted in major changes to our current timeline of history. During the investigation, via the SCP-7306 journal, several outcomes have or have not occurred due to its use:\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Bryan Holland becomes a punk rock musician, never to work for the Foundation.\n\n\nCoffee in the Site-02 break room would always have sugar and cream instead of the ordinary stevia and oat milk.\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \"The Grimace Shake\" is neutralized, becoming an ordinary blueberry milkshake, due to the predetermined efforts of Foundation staff.\n\n\nThe Site-02 Assistant Director has a wife and three daughters, and they would never be lonely again.\n\n\n[\nDATA REDACTED\n] became the President of the United States instead of working for the janitorial staff.\n\n\nAs well as similar cases conducted by Site-02 staff.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the transcript from the interview prior to termination:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Agent Becker\n\n\nInterviewee\n: Dr. Olson\n\n\nTime\n: 00:48\n\n\nLocation\n: Site-02 Interrogation Room B\n\n\n \n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: This is Agent Becker beginning Session 01 of the investigation concerning Incident IMF-7. Date is\u2026 October 3rd, 2023\u2026 time is\u2026 00:48. The interviewee is Dr. Olson, head researcher and supervisor of SCP-7306. Now, if you may, Doctor\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson is silent as Agent Becker begins to tap his pen on the metal desk\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: You seemed really talkative earlier when they were dragging you out of your office, Michael. This is your last cha\u2014\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: (Softly) Those people deserved a second chance, Becker. The Foundation owed them that and a lot of a hell more.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: You don't get to decide that, Michael, the Ethics Committee does.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: The Committee? (Raises voice) The Committee? What a fucking \njoke\n. A body of ignorant people that decide what is right or wrong. They are no better than the O5s. (Directed towards the camera) The same cunts that hid [\nDATA EXPUNGED\n].\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Michael, calm yourself. Don't do this.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: (Directed towards Agent Becker) No! You should all be ashamed of yourselves. (Looks towards the camera) I thought you didn\u2019t want to search for them, but no, you just want to hide it under the rug. You ruthless hypocritical bastards\u2026 all in the name of ethics and yet you let people [\nDATA EXPUNGED\n]!\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Enough, Michael! This is childish, even for you!\n\n\n \n\n\nSilence drowns the room for a short period of time.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Back to my questions\u2026 We know a few of the Foundation personnel involved or are at least aware of this operation. A couple of security, research, and even administration staff, but we suspect there are more. Apart from you, who else conducted these experiments?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: Doctor Bayfield helped me conduct most of these experiments, but she wasn't involved as much as I was. Most of the other researchers were just\u2026 \"participating\".\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: And how many times have you conducted these unauthorized tests?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: (Pauses) I can't determine that even if I wanted to.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Jesus Christ.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker pulls out a Polaroid film containing a picture of Researcher Jacobson. Noticeably, Dr. Olson's facial expression changes.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Researcher Jacobson, one of your assistants in conducting these experiments. We know you let him use SCP-7306, and during retrieval, we found him unconscious by his bedside.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: I\u2026 I told him not to\u2026\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: You told him not to use SCP-7306, yet it was in his possession, and he used it. (Leans in) I would start saying names\u2026 now.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson:\n (Silence)\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Come on, Michael, we both know you don't have time for this.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson begins sobbing.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: What are you crying for?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: I didn't mean to hurt them. I-I just wanted to help them. Everything I did\u2026 for what?\n\n\n \n\n\nSilence drowns the room for eleven seconds until the door to the interrogation room opens\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nFoundation Security\n: Might want to finish up; EC-08 wants a debrief before the proceedings.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: \n(sigh)\n Fine. There's nothing else to gather from this. Officer Lamson will escort you to your holding cell.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe metal chair screeched followed by the jingle of handcuffs and heavy steps.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: Michael?\n\n\n \n\n\nDoctor Olson looks back from the frame of the open door towards Agent Becker.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent Becker\n: I\u2019m sorry. You must believe me I truly tried.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe door then quickly opened and banged shut, leaving Agent Becker alone in the room.\n\n\n \n\n<\nEnd Log\n>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio\u00a0Recording\u00a0(Holding\u00a0Cell)\n\n\n\n\nAudio\u00a0Recording\u00a0(Holding\u00a0Cell)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHolding Cell B-7A Audio Recording\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary\n: Upon concluding the Incident IMF-7 interview, Dr. Olson was escorted back to his holding cell until an Ethics Committee member could view and verify future proceedings. The transcript below is the audio recording containing a conversation between Dr. Olson and Dr. Bayfield.\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\n \n\n\nScuffling is heard with the sound of a jail door squeaking open with more scuffling and footsteps\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nFoundation Security\n: Give me your hands.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe jingle of handcuffs is followed by the shutting of the jail door.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Are you alright?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: \u2026 No.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Silence]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Do you know what will happen to us\u2026 to me?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: I\u2026\n(hesitates)\n I don't know for certain. Time will tell.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Silence]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: I never wanted this to happen, Brooke. To hurt people. All I wanted was for them to live a life worth living. Imagine being cooped up in an office filled with these diabolical beings, never being able to see your family and loved ones\u2026 it was the least I could do. \n(Sighs)\n It's all my fault.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: You shouldn't blame yourself, Michael. We all took the risk. We knew what would happen if we participated, even me. I thought\u2026 I thought that \nit\n would help. It's nothing but a dangerous toy that creates fleeting memories.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: You know what that researcher said when we gave him a chance to use SCP-7306? It was the most boring response I ever heard: \"I regret nothing because every decision made me who I am today\". For years, I forced myself to believe in that. I wanted to think in the exact same way as he did. I just wish we never got caught.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: You cannot be serious, Michael. Do you still believe that what we did was worth it? Do you still believe that natural order is something you can play with?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: Don\u2019t get me wrong, Brooke. I\u2019m not saying that people who believe in that are wrong, especially him. If they truly don\u2019t regret anything, then they are both lucky and happy. I\u2019m saying that if I have a chance to have a drop of power over what could've been and keep it that way, I would rather have that than fame or fortune.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: And yet that drop of power you talk about is your undoing. All it will do is leave you unsatisfied and begging for more. Even if you try to change it, the constant dread and fear of what is and what could\u2019ve been will forever haunt you, either in these cells or in that fucking thing's containment chamber. Could it have been better? What if I did this or that, and maybe it could have been\u2014it's nonsense!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: You can't stop a person from diving back into their past. This time is barely any different. The only difference is that this time we have the possibility of change. The opportunity to have some other meaning in our lives that we haven't had before.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Whatever you or others on the team sought is dead and should be long forgotten.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: What are you talking about? The past can never be forgotten. It can never die. Our present is always determined by our past. Both an enemy and a friend, our past will never let go. We can finally control that bastard and keep it in check.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Then answer me: Are you really living in the present? You say you have your past in check, but it still controls you. It is haunting you. Right. Now. We can let the past die. Both of us know we\u2019ve let it live for too long. Don't make me go into that void with you.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Silence]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Can I tell you something, Michael?\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: (Softly) Of course. Nobody can stop you.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Bayfield\n: Life is full of wrong choices, but if I were the perfect daughter, I would have never met you. I would've never come to work at the Foundation. One could say they were never mistakes in the first place, but whether they are mistakes or not, never in a single moment of my life will I regret all the choices I made. I don't need \nit\n to tell me that.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Silence]\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson\n: (Softly) Thank you.\n\n\n \n\n\nDr. Olson quietly sobs, as he and Dr. Bayfield tell each other goodbye.

Dr. Jacobson, as well as other Site-02 staff who were involved in the incident, are to be interviewed, given amnestic treatment, and punished accordingly. Ethics Committee Member 08 was present for the proceedings, reporting the results to both the committee and council.

        "Interviewer : Agent Becker Interviewee : Dr. Olson Time : 00:48 Location : Site-02 Interrogation Room B < Begin Log > Agent Becker : This is Agent Becker beginning Session 01 of the investigation concerning Incident IMF-7. Date is\u2026 October 3rd, 2023\u2026 time is\u2026 00:48. The interviewee is Dr. Olson, head researcher and supervisor of SCP-7306. Now, if you may, Doctor\u2026 Dr. Olson is silent as Agent Becker begins to tap his pen on the metal desk . Agent Becker : You seemed really talkative earlier when they were dragging you out of your office, Michael. This is your last cha\u2014 Dr. Olson : (Softly) Those people deserved a second chance, Becker. The Foundation owed them that and a lot of a hell more. Agent Becker : You don't get to decide that, Michael, the Ethics Committee does. Dr. Olson : The Committee? (Raises voice) The Committee? What a fucking joke . A body of ignorant people that decide what is right or wrong. They are no better than the O5s. (Directed towards the camera) The same cunts that hid [ DATA EXPUNGED ]. Agent Becker : Michael, calm yourself. Don't do this. Dr. Olson : (Directed towards Agent Becker) No! You should all be ashamed of yourselves. (Looks towards the camera) I thought you didn\u2019t want to search for them, but no, you just want to hide it under the rug. You ruthless hypocritical bastards\u2026 all in the name of ethics and yet you let people [ DATA EXPUNGED ]! Agent Becker : Enough, Michael! This is childish, even for you! Silence drowns the room for a short period of time. Agent Becker : Back to my questions\u2026 We know a few of the Foundation personnel involved or are at least aware of this operation. A couple of security, research, and even administration staff, but we suspect there are more. Apart from you, who else conducted these experiments? Dr. Olson : Doctor Bayfield helped me conduct most of these experiments, but she wasn't involved as much as I was. Most of the other researchers were just\u2026 \"participating\". Agent Becker : And how many times have you conducted these unauthorized tests? Dr. Olson : (Pauses) I can't determine that even if I wanted to. Agent Becker : Jesus Christ. Agent Becker pulls out a Polaroid film containing a picture of Researcher Jacobson. Noticeably, Dr. Olson's facial expression changes. Agent Becker : Researcher Jacobson, one of your assistants in conducting these experiments. We know you let him use SCP-7306, and during retrieval, we found him unconscious by his bedside. Dr. Olson : I\u2026 I told him not to\u2026 Agent Becker : You told him not to use SCP-7306, yet it was in his possession, and he used it. (Leans in) I would start saying names\u2026 now. Dr. Olson: (Silence) Agent Becker : Come on, Michael, we both know you don't have time for this. Dr. Olson begins sobbing. Agent Becker : What are you crying for? Dr. Olson : I didn't mean to hurt them. I-I just wanted to help them. Everything I did\u2026 for what? Silence drowns the room for eleven seconds until the door to the interrogation room opens . Foundation Security : Might want to finish up; EC-08 wants a debrief before the proceedings. Agent Becker : (sigh) Fine. There's nothing else to gather from this. Officer Lamson will escort you to your holding cell. The metal chair screeched followed by the jingle of handcuffs and heavy steps. Agent Becker : Michael? Doctor Olson looks back from the frame of the open door towards Agent Becker. Agent Becker : I\u2019m sorry. You must believe me I truly tried. The door then quickly opened and banged shut, leaving Agent Becker alone in the room. < End Log >",
        "< Begin Log > Scuffling is heard with the sound of a jail door squeaking open with more scuffling and footsteps . Foundation Security : Give me your hands. The jingle of handcuffs is followed by the shutting of the jail door. Dr. Bayfield : Are you alright? Dr. Olson : \u2026 No. [Silence] Dr. Bayfield : Do you know what will happen to us\u2026 to me? Dr. Olson : I\u2026 (hesitates) I don't know for certain. Time will tell. [Silence] Dr. Olson : I never wanted this to happen, Brooke. To hurt people. All I wanted was for them to live a life worth living. Imagine being cooped up in an office filled with these diabolical beings, never being able to see your family and loved ones\u2026 it was the least I could do. (Sighs) It's all my fault. Dr. Bayfield : You shouldn't blame yourself, Michael. We all took the risk. We knew what would happen if we participated, even me. I thought\u2026 I thought that it would help. It's nothing but a dangerous toy that creates fleeting memories. Dr. Olson : You know what that researcher said when we gave him a chance to use SCP-7306? It was the most boring response I ever heard: \"I regret nothing because every decision made me who I am today\". For years, I forced myself to believe in that. I wanted to think in the exact same way as he did. I just wish we never got caught. Dr. Bayfield : You cannot be serious, Michael. Do you still believe that what we did was worth it? Do you still believe that natural order is something you can play with? Dr. Olson : Don\u2019t get me wrong, Brooke. I\u2019m not saying that people who believe in that are wrong, especially him. If they truly don\u2019t regret anything, then they are both lucky and happy. I\u2019m saying that if I have a chance to have a drop of power over what could've been and keep it that way, I would rather have that than fame or fortune. Dr. Bayfield : And yet that drop of power you talk about is your undoing. All it will do is leave you unsatisfied and begging for more. Even if you try to change it, the constant dread and fear of what is and what could\u2019ve been will forever haunt you, either in these cells or in that fucking thing's containment chamber. Could it have been better? What if I did this or that, and maybe it could have been\u2014it's nonsense! Dr. Olson : You can't stop a person from diving back into their past. This time is barely any different. The only difference is that this time we have the possibility of change. The opportunity to have some other meaning in our lives that we haven't had before. Dr. Bayfield : Whatever you or others on the team sought is dead and should be long forgotten. Dr. Olson : What are you talking about? The past can never be forgotten. It can never die. Our present is always determined by our past. Both an enemy and a friend, our past will never let go. We can finally control that bastard and keep it in check. Dr. Bayfield : Then answer me: Are you really living in the present? You say you have your past in check, but it still controls you. It is haunting you. Right. Now. We can let the past die. Both of us know we\u2019ve let it live for too long. Don't make me go into that void with you. [Silence] Dr. Bayfield : Can I tell you something, Michael? Dr. Olson : (Softly) Of course. Nobody can stop you. Dr. Bayfield : Life is full of wrong choices, but if I were the perfect daughter, I would have never met you. I would've never come to work at the Foundation. One could say they were never mistakes in the first place, but whether they are mistakes or not, never in a single moment of my life will I regret all the choices I made. I don't need it to tell me that. [Silence] Dr. Olson : (Softly) Thank you. Dr. Olson quietly sobs, as he and Dr. Bayfield tell each other goodbye. The audio cuts. < End Log >",
