Consumption of SCP-4726-1 is currently permitted but discouraged.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4726 is a tall, obese human male of Hispanic descent. The subject has been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis.\n1\n\n\nSCP-4726 secretes an opaque liquid substance (hereafter referred to as SCP-4726-1) at a rate of 1.4 liters per hour. The chemical composition of SCP-4726-1 consists of caffeine, sugar, taurine, and other folic acids. Consumption of SCP-4726-1 influences the neurotransmitters for norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine in a similar process as non-anomalous caffeinated beverages.\n\n\nConsuming large quantities of SCP-4726-1 (typically over 2 liters within 24 hours) has resulted in arrhythmia, hypertension, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.\n\n\nAddendum.4726.01:\n On the 22nd of April, 2019, SCP-4726 informed personnel it had become aware of a secondary property of SCP-4726-1. This property manifests upon excessive consumption of specific foods. A list of known flavors and their requisite foods was provided by SCP-4726 and is listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOD ITEM\n\n\nFLAVOR PRODUCED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Standard Meal 23-A\n\n\nLimeade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Standard Meal 19-D\n\n\nPink Lemonade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM&M King Size Packet\n2\n (x2)\n\n\nOrangeade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaruchan Cheddar Cheese Flavor Yakisoba\n3\n (x1)\n\n\nRoot Beer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutraloaf\n4\n\n\nMango Peach Tea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToenails\n5\n\n\nMountain Dew Baja Blast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
