Direct access to SCP-4828 is limited to Level 4 and select Level 3 Personnel. Unauthorized access to SCP-4828 is grounds for severe disciplinary action.\n\n\nExecution of the following instructions must be carried out with utmost precision and within the designated time. Any personnel that obstructs the performance of the steps will be severely reprimanded.\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Instructions\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\u00a0Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a weekly basis, a human must open SCP-4828, and skim its contents for one minute before closing it again.\n\n\nOn the first day of a new year of the Gregorian calendar, a human must read any \"spell\" from SCP-4828 and intentionally activate it.\n\n\nOn the 14\nth\n day of February, a male and female human must lift SCP-4828, in perfect synchronization, and kiss each other with SCP-4828 held in the middle before returning it back in the table.\n\n\nOn the 3\nrd\n day of April, a cake with three lighted candles must be placed on the table with SCP-4828 placed on the right side. Three humans must then sing the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song to SCP-4828 three times and in complete unison.\n\n\nOn the first day of November, personnel must genuinely scare at least one fellow personnel using SCP-4828 as a primary tool.\n\n\nOn a monthly basis, any personnel of Abrahamic faith must worship SCP-4828 continuously for a day without rest.\n\n\nOn the day of a neap tide, one cup of sand must be poured over SCP-4828. A glass filled with 250 ml of lemonade must then be placed near SCP-4828 before being covered with a miniature umbrella. Objects are safe to remove when the lemonade has completely disappeared.\n\n\nOn the 267\nth\n day of any year, a \nconfirmed\n murderer\n1\n must be beaten to death by a family member of the victim using only SCP-4828.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4828 refers to a black hardbound book that has an inconsistent number of pages. In golden letters and Garamond font, the book is entitled \u201c\nThe Big Book Of Achievable Spells, made easy\n\u201d. No clue or details that can be used to recognize the creator and origin of SCP-4828 has been found. A handwritten text by an unknown individual saying \u201cThere can be order in chaos.\u201d is located in its first page.\n\n\nThe exact origins and age of SCP-4828 remain unknown. The exact composition of SCP-4828 remains unknown as any form of damage inflicted on SCP-4828, be it directly or indirectly, will cause the immediate death by separation of the bilateral sides of the personnel. The \u201cspells\u201d mentioned in SCP-4828 refer to a set of instructions preceded by a bolded text that clearly or vaguely describes the purpose of the instructions.\n\n\nSaid \"spells\" have a particular anomalous effect ranging from causing mundane outcomes to possibly creating a ZK-Destruction-of-Reality event. The instructions are composed of short but specific steps, written in the language that the reader is most familiar with, that, when executed perfectly, will immediately cause the activation of the \"spell\". After a \"spell\" has been activated, the instructions of that \"spell\" will disappear from the book and will reappear letter by letter after a random period of time has passed. This is generally referred to as its \u201ccooldown period\u201d.\n\n\nActivation of the \"spells\" will require the specific placements of seemingly random objects, specific hand and body movements and gestures, or a combination of both in a duration ranging from three seconds to two years.\n\n\nResearch of SCP-4828 revealed that any human, regardless of the level of mental capacity and knowledge of SCP-4828, will be capable of activating the spells. The randomness and difficulty of the instruction will increase relative to the level of (potential) destructive force or degree of influence posed by a particular spell (with a few exceptions). For this reason, accidental activation of dangerous \"spells\" is minuscule but is still possible.\n\n\nA \"spell\" with the title \u201cTo Please, to Conserve and to Serve Me\u201d is found on the second page of SCP-4828. The exact purpose or effect of this \"spell\" is currently unknown but the failure to perform the instructions will result in a 4828-Event. A 4828-Event is a series of anomalous events that will affect the closest person(s) to SCP-4828 regardless of current distance. Successful performance of the spell will immediately cease a 4828-Event, but the damages inflicted will remain permanent.\n\n\nThe table below describes the specific anomalous event that will occur after failing to perform an instruction.\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Table\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\u00a0Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruction\n\n\nCorresponding 4828-Event\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a weekly basis, a human must open SCP-4828, and skim its contents for one minute before closing it again.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause SCP-4828 to open and randomly activate any spell.\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the first day of a new year of the Gregorian calendar, a human must read any spell from SCP-4828 and intentionally activate it.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause SCP-4828 to randomly activate three spells at once.\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 14\nth\n day of February, a male and female human must lift SCP-4828, in perfect synchronization, and kiss each other with SCP-4828 held in the middle before returning it back on a table.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause the genitalia to be ripped out from the body of the nearest male and female human from SCP-4828. Victims typically die of blood loss but immediate medical attention may enable them to survive.\n\n\nIf performed correctly, SCP-4828 is noted to heat up to 35 degrees Celsius for one minute before returning to its normal temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 3\nrd\n day of April, a cake with three lighted candles must be placed on the table with SCP-4828 placed on the right side. Three humans must then sing the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song to SCP-4828 three times and in complete unison.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause SCP-4828 to start to continuously leak a saline solution at a steady rate of 5\u00a0L/s. The secretion of the solution will immediately cease at 12:00 midnight on the current time zone of the area it is in.\n\n\nIf performed correctly, the candles will be blown out by a soft wind originating from SCP-4828.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the first day of November, personnel must genuinely scare at least one fellow personnel using SCP-4828 as a primary tool.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause the development of a sense of apathy and lethargy that will spread from one person to the next that will increase in severity to the point that some affected personnel will intentionally stop their breathing (although breathing is a partially involuntary act). The event will immediately cease at 12:00 on the current time zone of the area it is in.\n\n\nIf performed correctly, a faint sound resembling a burst of laughter will emanate from SCP-4828.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a monthly basis, any personnel of Abrahamic faith must worship SCP-4828 continuously for a day without rest.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause any personnel of Abrahamic faith to instantly develop a sense of hatred towards Abrahamic religions, and a sense of loyalty to an unknown religion focused on worshipping an abstract entity that, according to the descriptions by affected individuals, closely resembles a giant book.\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the day of a neap tide, one cup of sand must be poured over SCP-4828. A glass filled with 250 ml lemonade must then be placed near SCP-4828 before being covered with a miniature umbrella. Objects are safe to remove when the lemonade has completely disappeared.\n\n\nFailure to do so or if the objects are disturbed with the glass still containing lemonade will cause any person nearest to SCP-4828 to slowly die of suffocation due to the manifestation of sand in their lungs. After the death of one victim, which usually occurs in 40 minutes, any personnel nearest to the previous victim will start to suffocate for the same reason. This will occur continuously one victim after another, only ceasing when the peak of the high tide has occurred.\n\n\nIf performed correctly, traces of lemon juice will be present all over the pages of SCP-4828 that will disappear within 30 minutes since the performance of the instruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 267\nth\n day of any Gregorian year, a \nconfirmed\n murderer must be beaten to death by a family member of the victim using only SCP-4828.\n\n\nFailure to do so will cause one of the victims of the murders to be crudely reanimated and manifest near its family members and will start to verbally berate them for not giving it \u201cjustice\u201d. The entity will demanifest one hour after its initial manifestation. Application of strong amnestics is proven effective in removing the trauma of the family members from the ordeal.\n\n\nIf the convict was, in fact, innocent and was killed, the person holding SCP-4828 will start to excrete a high volume of blood, causing his/her death by suffocation. The blood matches that of the alleged murderer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4828 was discovered when agents successfully captured POI-4828, a suspected reality bender who had been utilizing SCP-4828. Interrogation of POI-4828 revealed that he bought SCP-4828 from a small shop called \"The Multistore from Nowhere and Everywhere\" that appeared near his town, which was confirmed to be true by using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nHis ignorance and negligence of the instructions of the spell located in the second page, where the containment procedures are based upon, may have caused the series of anomalous events that have caused the death of multiple civilians over the last three months. POI-4828, after being deemed completely non-anomalous and of no further use, was amnesticed and reintegrated within the society. The store described by POI-4828 was never found.\n\n\nAddendum/\"Spells\":\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0Addendum/\"Spells\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Addendum/\"Spells\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe following list is some of the \"spells\" and its instructions found in the book.
