Citizens found approaching SCP-5248 are to be removed from the premises. SCP-5248 is not to be in the vicinity of any devices capable of connecting to the Internet.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5248 is composed of two anomalies, SCP-5248-A and SCP-5248-B. SCP-5248-A is a CRT monitor with a spinning logo of Prometheus Labs on the screen. Under the logo is the words \"\nUploading to WAN\u2026\n\". When in close proximity to a device able to connect to the Internet, SCP-5248-A will attempt to do so; it will then use the device as a proxy to connect to a server with the name \nwanparadise.com\n.\n\n\nSCP-5248-B is a corpse in a cross-legged pose connected to SCP-5248-A through a wire constructed from an indeterminate material. At the base of SCP-5248-B's neck is a PS/2 port. It is currently unknown how SCP-5248 remains alive despite signs of severe malnutrition.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n After the Foundation acquisition of Sangkatauhan Para sa Pangkaraniwang Katauhan (SPK)\n.\nThe \nSangkatauhan Para sa Pangkaraniwang Katauhan\n (lit. Society For Humanity's Normalcy) was a society created by University of the Philippines (UP) students during the Marcos era to protect normalcy, as the Marcos regime was using anomalies to enforce Martial Law. After the end of Martial Law, UP officials subsumed the SPK into their structure. However, on 2001, with the heavy support of Bill Clinton, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed the Foundation-Normalcy Keeping Agencies Agreement, promising to merge all normalcy keeping agencies under the Foundation by 2010. Today, the former base of the SPK is now known as Site-901.\n in 2003, a suspended case file by \nAmong\n Justin about SCP-5248 was found and reopened for investigation. Investigation was slow due to missing information and lack of investigation done by the SPK themselves. However, when local news reports around the area of SCP-5248 reported the smell of corpses and trash emanating from the building SCP-5248 was purported to be located in, Foundation agents were immediately sent to investigate SCP-5248. Although SCP-5248 was located in the center of the house, the piles of rotten cans of food, dirty bottles of water, and salvaged computer parts made it hard to reach SCP-5248. Current procedures were then formulated and enacted.\n\n\nInterview with SCP-5248-B:\n On 2021/03/23, Researcher Jun organized an interview with SCP-5248-B through a terminal connected to the port of SCP-5248-B.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5248-B\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Jun.\n\n\nPrologue:\n Interview was done through a terminal. With permission from Site-901 Director Damaso, Researcher Jun was permitted to use his expertise in Maxwellist religion to form a connection with SCP-5248-B.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n???\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, SCP-5248-B.

HIS paradise.\n.\nWAN's Paradise, accessible through the address wansparadise.com, was a website where Maxwellists can upload their consciousness to interact with each other. After financial troubles due to the Dot Com Bubble bursting in the 2000s, it shut down, but not before offering its members a premium to transfer over to Cipher City\n friends told me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they're in WAN's Paradise, aren't you supposed to be there?

There's this thing we'd use to do where we ask one of the staff to make a street full of cars and we play \npatintero\n in in. I even missed class most of the time because of those games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnever had time for games\u2026 busy getting money :(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney's not a problem there either, just play some mini-games and you can have a lot of money instantly.

A log of the conversation is recorded below.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5248-B\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Reearcher Jun.\n\n\nPrologue:\n Conversation was done through terminal.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nOh, nice!
