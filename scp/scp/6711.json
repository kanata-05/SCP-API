The area within this perimeter, SCP-6711-\u0394, shall be inaccessible without express permission by the designated authority on the entity. All instances of SCP-6711-A shall be recorded and aggregated on a \nmonthly\n \nyearly\n \ndecades\n \ncentennial\n millennial basis to determine further exploration data.\u2028\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6711-\u0394 is a designated area, situated to the northeast of the former Second Springs Hot Springs in the \ndefunct\n Ancient San Bernardino Land Preserve. The entity is defined as a spatial-temporal anomaly, approximately 3 meters in circumference located off the southern intersection of two unnamed access roads previously used by California State Rangers, as well as the former proprietors of said Second Springs Ranch.\n\n\nIndividuals who pass through the boundary of the entity during the day will experience no ill-effect. However, for currently undefined reasons, individuals who pass through the anomalous region of the entity during nightfall will invariably find themselves in a larger, mostly unexplored space, akin to a large, arid desert, in which time dilations are prevalent.\n\n\nWithin the parameters of current exploration, it can be determined that the further a subject travels into the entity, the slower time progresses for the subject relative to the time outside the entity\u2019s boundaries. Current theories suggest that a temporal singularity exists a the center, at an indeterminable distance into the entity, where if the singularity reached, time outside the boundary would approach infinity.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-6711-A are long-form wavelength transmissions from MTF Agent - \u201cCoyote\u201d.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The entity came to Foundation attention when two civilians looking to participate in activities associated with Second Hot Springs were reported missing. Foundation Personnel embedded in the California Ranger Service, per Protocol Plainsight-201, were notified of the situation and sent to recover the lost individuals. All relevant documentation is contained henceforth.\n\n\nArchived Discovery\n\n\n\n\nInterview SCP-6711-1\n\n\nInterview Lead:\n Reseacher Samuel Lowenthal\n\n\nInterview Subject:\n Jackson Kimble (Subject-A)\n\n\nOversight:\n Senior Reseacher Francis O\u2019Harrahan\n\n\nLocation:\n Temporary Quarantine Area SCP-6711-\u0394, San Bernardino\n\n\nDate:\n 05/18/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 09:00am\n\n\nTranscript of Audio-Video Surveillance\n\n\nSamuel Lowenthal:\n Jackson, thank you for your patience.

The sun didn't come up until\u2026\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Jackson, according to telephone records we have, you made a call from Maria Schultz\u2019s phone at 01:34am on Tuesday, May 9th. Yes?\n\n\nSubject-A:\nI\u2026 Yeah, she wanted to keep trying to reload the map, but it wasn\u2019t working. The phone was at 3%\u2026 So I took it from her and called 911\u2026 She didn't like that.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Jackson, today is Thursday, the 18th. You've been gone for 9 days.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n I\u2026 no\u2026 can\u2019t be. The sun never came up\u2026 it was only night.

So I called\u2026\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Yes, Jackson, do you remember anything strange about the call? Any thing at all?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n No. The lady just asked what we looked like and what we were wearing, she sounded weird\u2026 I was upset.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Why were you upset?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n It was like she was pranking me\u2026\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Jackson, could you take a listen to this?\n\n\nReseacher Lowenthal takes out a recording device and plays its contents.\n\n\n\n\nBegin Recording:\n\n\nOperator:\n 911, what is your emergency?\n\n\nSubject-A\u2019s voice can be heard speaking back to the operator, however his voice is pitched down, and much slower than typical speech patterns.\n\n\nSubject-A (Recording):\n We are lost near Second Springs. Send help.\n\n\nOperator:\n Sir, I\u2019m going to need you to speak clearer and tell me what you are wearing.\n\n\nThe Operator\u2019s voice is heard speeding up and sounding higher pitched.\n\n\nSubject-A (Recording):\n What I am wearing?

How is Maria? Its been a while\u2026 I know I\u2019m in quarantine, but..\n\n\nLowenthal:\n I am sure she is fine. I want to ask you about the time you were lost two weeks ago.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n You mean last nigh\u2026 Oh, yeah its all weird, huh?\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Yes, it is. Can you tell me about the night when you and Maria were lost?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n Well, we were trying to make our way back to camp. Maria and I knew each other for a long time and I always had a thing for her ya know?\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Mmhmm.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n Well, she was moving outta town, gonna start new and fresh, and I footed the bill. She wanted, like, one last adventure so she suggested the nudie springs. Thought it would be, like, my chance, you know?\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Mr. Kimble, I am more concerned about what happened just prior to your phone call attempt. Can you fast forward?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n Oh, yeah sure, well like, we had done a bunch of blow and drank the entire day. As we were trying to find our way back we took a wrong turn down this old dirt path.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n A service road, yes?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n I don\u2019t know. We were trying to just follow this fence. When it stopped, I made the call. She thought we should try to head back towards the mountains, back to the springs.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n What happened when you left the path.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n I dialed the phone as I followed her. Made the call, then after that we got in a fight. I didn\u2019t want the night to end with her yelling at me like that. This was for her. I love her, ya know?\n\n\nLowenthal:\n I see, now, before you were picked up by the search and rescue team, could you tell me anything else?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n I tried to keep us close to the road, every time we went too far out of sight of the road, we moved back. Then I noticed a flashlight waving in the distance, and far away the sun was rising. So, I ran to it. After that I was so tired, all I remember is sleeping and waking up here.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Did you notice any strange creatures?\n\n\nSubject-A:\n Huh? No, just the usual pack of coyotes howling. The air seemed so still\u2026\n\n\nSubject-A remains silent for 14 seconds.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Jackson, thank you. That is all for today.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n When will I get to see Maria?\n\n\nLowenthal is silent for a moment.\n\n\nO\u2019Harrahan:\n (\nIn earpiece.\n) You can tell him.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Jackson, Im going to be honest with you, Maria\u2026 Maria never made it out with you.\n\n\nO\u2019Harrahan:\n (\nIn earpiece.\n) Sam, lets use Protocol Blemish to cover up Schultz\u2019s disappearance.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Copy.\n\n\nSubject-A:\n Huh?

D-Class is to be given: One flashlight, a stop watch, one days worth of rations and water, as well as a lifeline tether & harness around his waist connected to a point outside the anomalous boundary. Standard Audio/Video equipment is to be used for data analysis.\n\n\nDue to anomaly\u2019s nature, the majority of proceeding transcripts are time stamped to the date the precursive data was aggregated and digitally processed.\n\n\nLog-A\n\n\nSubject:\n D-101488\n\n\nBegin Date:\n 10/23/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 02:32am\n\n\nBegin Archived Audio Transcript\n\n\nLowenthal:\n D-Class, please approach the anomaly. Once inside, please immediately start your stop watch.\n\n\nD-101488:\n Yes sir.\n\n\nA/V feed from D-101488 continues normal operation up to the point of crossing the SCP-6711 boundary. Once crossed, video feed is terminated and only audio transmissions are receivable.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n D-Class, stop right there, can you still hear me?\n\n\nD-101488:\n Yes sir, but your voice sounds strange.\n\n\nD-101488\u2019s voice recording sounds slow and pitched down.\n\n\nLowenthal:\n Your\u2019s as well.

I am, to the best of my abilities, trying to enjoy retirement. My position as Site Director has surely taken a toll on me, as you probably now understand. I try to thrive to my best extent. These quiet years have allowed me much time to think and reflect on all that I have done in the name of Secure, Contain, and Protect.\n\n\nI hope Richards, as well as yourself is well.\n\n\nAs much as I believe an exploration into SCP-6711 would be beneficial, the possible ethical implications would be against my current philosophies regarding human treatment.\n\n\nAll that being said, should you find a suitable, willing candidate for the mission, I, as the Project Lead on the anomaly, would give my endorsement.\n\n\nWith Reverence,\n\n\nFormer Dir. - Francis O\u2019Harrahan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nArchived MTF Proposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n \nnoitadnuof.ftm|nairazabc#noitadnuof.ftm|nairazabc\n\n\nFrom:\n \nnoitadnuof.pcs.eruces|lahtnewols#noitadnuof.pcs.eruces|lahtnewols\n\n\nDate:\n 04-10-2038\n\n\nSubject:\n Mission Opportunity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Bazarian,\n\n\nI am reaching out to you as I am in need of someone with your expertise. We have an anomaly that requires the finesse of a survivalist such as yourself. Your aptitude in previous missions as well as personal feats makes you the best and only candidate. Your K2 ascent and your leadership skills in recovery of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, certainly come to the forefront. Please let me know your consideration.\n\n\nDir.

I am truly sorry. To be up and front with you, this is the kind of mission you don\u2019t come back from. Along with your professional experience, I also considered your personal affairs when choosing you as a prime candidate. Should you accept, I shall see to it that you have access to the SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 File, detailing your father's last mission.\n\n\nThe anomaly itself displaces subjects inside by years in the future. We had a D-Class in there for a little over 15 minutes his time, while more than 2 decades passed for us.

We seek to only contain Thaumiel entities and those entities that may provide Thaumiel status. Fortunately, SCP-6711 has been deemed as such and you may continue to exist within it. This will be our last transmission as we can no longer physically produce lower wavelength frequencies into SCP-6711. We have built a native code within the Foundation Database called \u201cCoyote Ugly\u201d that will ensure that no matter when you are, your voice is heard. You are on your own now.

Ok. So. Sorry, to whoever may be listening. I know I am overdue for my report. Let\u2019s just say I met some\u2026 unforeseen problems, and I think I know why. First off, I am off the rock. Second, pertinent to the mission, I guess is that, there is nothing left out here, just more space\u2026 Maybe somewhere out there is an edge, but I don\u2019t think me spending all of eternity to find it is my goal. I feel I have accomplished what I set to do. Any organization getting this should be satisfied with my limited insight. Third\u2026 well, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not doing so great. It seems the tension on my tether cord was overwhelmed.. I was just starting the descent from the rock face when this happened. I managed to catch myself on my 3rd belay bolt, about 25 feet down, however the overhang provided just enough arch length for me to slam much harder than expected into the face. My ankle and shin took the brunt of the impact and I am unsure of their diagnosis, however, currently immobile, possibly broken, seems to be the case. Oh yeah time, I guess y\u2019all need that. Time, 64 hours, 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding CACS Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe automated CACS response unit for .6711-Aggregated Time Anomaly, found no pertinent data regarding previous interception.

Sorry to whoever I need to be sorry to for not recording on the dot. So, after I made it down off the face, alive, with no honorable mentions for my tether friend here. I pulled all of what I could for about 2 hours, only to find a severely aged and frayed end of the line. Given that even just post-boundary, time progresses at least at twice, if not three times more than pre-boundary, I guess so much time has passed that my tether cord deteriorated and snapped. Hell, how long have I been here? How long does it take for a kevlar support to break down? After the fall, I am unsure of which way is back, and with no rope to guide me, I guess I\u2019ll just have to track its markings in the sand to get back.
