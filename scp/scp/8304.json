Due to the power SCP-8304 possesses and its connection to many objects scattered around Earth, it is impossible to contain or terminate the anomaly. All foundation personnel are to exercise maximum caution when SCP-8304 is sensed in any area. Disregard any interaction, combatant response, or any form of attempt at communication. If you witness an event related to SCP-8304, you are to be terminated on sight. \"Good luck, Foundation!\" -\nO5 Council\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nSCP-8304 is the objectively monstrous entity born from the imagination of XVIII. century artist and poet \nWilliam Blake\n. The very depiction of the entity can be seen in Blake's single not-so-known artwork, \"The Divine Flame\". On the frame of the painting, the following text can be read: \n\"I shall not cease from mental fight, nor shall my sword sleep in my hand.\"\n\n\nIn the painting, the depiction of an eldritch god can be seen. A vast and robust skeleton with a katana from Japanese samurais is visible, attorned with chains of rosemary sewn onto the handle. The lowest pieces of this chain can be seen engulfed in crimson-red flames. It sits aloof on a flesh, gold, and silver throne. On the low side of the throne, there is an engraved text: \n\"Flesh is weak, gold is strong. My greed never rests for those who are born.\"\n\n\nThis painting depicts SCP-8304-OMEGA, which received the title of fear amongst the Foundation upon its discovery. William Blake's artworks can witness manifestation capability tied to the anomaly. Any time that an ideal of the artist is present in one of his artworks, the possibility of creating SCP-8304-OMEGA is as likely as certain.\n\n\nThe anomaly poses a critical danger, which has led to its classification as such. It bends reality and directly opposes the SCP Foundation and many other organizations, including the Global Occult Coalition (GOC). Furthermore, it has the complete capability to destroy matter, rendering it into a state of non-existence.\n\n\nDue to the warning signs already apparent beforehand, SCP-8304-OMEGA is \nNEVER\n to be bothered with. Conproc. focuses on the elimination of its birthpoints. \nThe artworks of \nWilliam Blake\n.\n\n\n\n\nFIRST CONTACT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIon:\n Descending upon the city center. I'm waiting for more commands.

An AK-47 can be seen on his back.\n\n\nIon:\n Radon. Where do I proceed?\n\n\nA monstrous scenery encloses Ion, flames everywhere, screaming corpses engulfed in the burning oxygen.\n\n\nRadon:\n The Town Hall.\n\n\nIon:\n Command copied. Proceeding to Town Hall.\n\n\nRadon:\n Be cautious. You have already deployed the water ration atop the building. This is your chance to overcome the flames and enter the infrastructure.\n\n\nIon:\n Understood.\n\n\nIon latches down his rifle and rushes towards the entry. With a loud bash, he slams through the door and jolts back at the sight before his eyes. Sweat rolls down his face below his mask.\n\n\nIon:\n RADON! ABORT NOW!\n\n\nRadon:\n Declined.\n\n\nIon:\n DAMNIT!\n\n\nIon grabs his rifle close to his eyes, as far as the mask allows, his eyes looking through the iron sight.\n\n\nRadon:\n I see your feed.

RETURN TO THE HELI!\n\n\nIon:\n GOOD CHOICE, SLOWSLY!\n\n\nThe door of the Town Hall on Radon's feed is pristine, embodied with a giant lock.\n\n\nIon:\n Shit\u2026\n\n\nThe Town Hall explodes.

Do you require backup already?? HANZEN?? HANZEN!\n\n\nAgent Genezhia could feel something behind her back. It is as if her seat in the car was heated up. Warm winds presented themselves inside the vehicle as if the sun was shining on her, like the spotlight of a god. Cold bones slide onto her shoulder, an organ begins to play, and the music of the air begins its parade. \"The air grows thin.\" He says, ripping apart the trapezius from her back, the blood slithering a painting of Blake himself on her back. \"Your time is over. Your hands no longer hold me, holding me all together like a squirrel clutches its daily ration in its delicate face. Piece by piece, I rip you apart, just as you have torn my heart to pieces.\" Agent Genezhia screams as hard as she can, but all that leaves her throat is a mere breeze.\n\n\nOperative Hanzen Field:\n Holy shit\u2026 It was so fast I could barely catch it.\n\n\nSquad Leader Mike Torquitan:\n Don't abort. We can call backup directly. As far as we know, that thing\n\ncannot fly. We should be okay, I am sure.\n\n\nHanzen snatches Mike's shoulder.\n\n\nOperative Hanzen Field:\n You are insane!

It has the upper hand.\n\n\nSquad Leader Mike Torquitan:\n We'll twist the odds. Not a thing we cannot handle. We swore for the Foundation.

Further events unraveled, however. SCP-8304-1 (the painting) was shown to\n\nbe re-imagining itself, taking on the form, and depicting what we now call SCP-8304-OMEGA. SCP-8304 refers to the direct anomalous presence in William Blake's works. Assumptions are that the anomaly phenomenon manifests the artist's ideals and motives. These are the fight against oppressors and the sense of the divine in each human being. Other arsons committed by not-found suspects are estimated to be the event of an SCP-8304-OMEGA manifestation. These incidents are tied to the following infrastructures:\n\n\n\n\nNational Gallery of Art\n\n\nLos Angeles County Museum\n\n\nTate Britain\n\n\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\n\n\nYale Center for British Art\n\n\nTown Hall of Nairobi\n\n\n\n\nAll of these buildings suffered incidents of arson or murder, the most notable being the Town Hall of Nairobi, located in Kenya's capital city. The place mentioned beforehand is where the most significant fire occurred, and the painting known as SCP-8304-1 was found. As the image was later repainted (by itself), the objective became clear. Evacuate the site and exterminate SCP-8304-1. The SCP-Foundation knows that the containment of anomalies matches the \"oppression\" William Blake mentions in his memos. So this is why lethal force must be utilized, as the anomaly is now classified as the enemy of the SCP-Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM-\u03c9-02\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nSector 3 had to evacuate first fully. The reason for this is apparent. SCP-8304's containment chamber\n\nwas held there. The evacuation followed all personnel's leave and the site's complete abandonment.\n\nSCP-8304 was classified as Tritotitanos, meaning it is only dangerous due to the Foundation's objective.\n\nSCP-8304-OMEGA's ravage was recorded in the archives to be viewed through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARCHIVED\u00a0DOC-\u03c9\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nThrough SCP-8304-OMEGA's ravage on 2019.12.30., it displayed a wide variety of skills and tactics consisting of stalking, deceit using reality manipulation, pyrokinesis, warping of objects, warping of itself, duplication, and psychokinesis. The incident lasted four hours and twenty-two minutes. Victims' last words tended to be quotes from William Blake himself.\n\n\nThe Foundation still follows its objective to secure, contain, and protect. Destruction of the works of the famous XVIII. century artist falls under the mission of organized, secretive vandalism executed by the remaining squads of MTF-Rho-77 \"Vow upon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC.-CAM.-FOOT.\u00a0-\u00a0\u03c9\u00a0-\u00a0Bunhill\u00a0Fields\u00a0Burial\u00a0Ground\u00a0-\u00a02016.02.29.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nA skeleton is seen kneeling in front of a grave.\n\n\nThe cadaver:\n Oh, William\u2026 Oh, Sophia\u2026 Would you lend me more strength?
