Upon viewing, a looping 30-second audio clip of Claude Debussy's \nClair De Lune\n will play. The first slide is dedicated to a title card reading \"\nyour month, your guy,\n\" followed by twelve images. Each depicts an instance of SCP-8597-1, as well as its name and individual characteristics.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1 is a group of twelve anomalous entities correlated to a month of the year that spontaneously appear upon viewing SCP-8597. The viewer\u2019s birth month is the determining factor in which of the twelve entities will manifest.\n\n\nFor an SCP-8597-1 instance to materialize, a user must have the slide corresponding to their birth month opened for over 60 seconds. The title card also specifies that users \"believe hard;\" though there is no evidence linking a user's belief and the likelihood of an SCP-8597-1 manifestation. A user's SCP-8597-1 instance will remain within their vicinity as long as SCP-8597 is actively open on a user's device.\n\n\nShould a user scroll away from SCP-8597, close the application, or shut their device off, the SCP-8597-1 instance will violently explode. Among the blood and viscera, a piece of paper will be left in place of the entity, containing only a text-based \"sad face\" emoticon.\n1\n Users can remanifest their corresponding SCP-8597-1 instance by following the manifestation parameters above.\n\n\nAddendum 8597.1:\n SCP-8597-1 Instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8597-1A | Jan.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1B | Feb.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1C | Mar.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1D | Apr.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1E | May\n\n\nSCP-8597-1F | Jun.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1G | Jul.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1H | Aug.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1I | Sep.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1J | Oct.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1K | Nov.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1L | Dec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njanuary\n\n\nbicurious frank\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- ooh ooh aah aah\n\n\n \n- pees on stuff to claim it\n\n\n \n- fiscal conservative\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1A is a golden snub-nosed monkey (\nRhinopithecus roxellana\n) enveloped in pink, purple, and blue colored light, commonly referred to as \u201cbisexual lighting\u201d in popular colloquialisms. SCP-8597-1A's lighting effect also carries to its general surroundings within a one-meter vicinity.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1A's intelligence is similar to the level of a human child between the ages of 6 and 11. While it can not speak, the entity can write in short, scribbled, albeit legible, sentences. It often does this to convince the user who manifested it to purchase financial investments, namely Gamestop and Tesla Motors stock, as well as several cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1A has shown great discomfort with its \u201cbicurious\u201d moniker, asking to be referred to as \u201cjust frank pls\u201d, and frantically apologizing to Foundation staff for \u201cshoving it down ur throats\u201d. This apparent stress has caused SCP-8597-1A to hyperventilate and pass out on multiple occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfebruary\n\n\nsquid jame(s)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- korean\n\n\n \n- reverse aquaman\n\n\n \n- will share his paramount+ password\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1B is a Caribbean reef squid \n(Sepioteuthis sepioidea)\n. SCP-8597-1B is capable of respirating air and limited vocalization in the Korean language, sonically comparable to that of an elderly male.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1B\u2019s vocal capabilities have been transcribed and translated below.\n\n\n\n\n\u201dDo you have Paramount+?\u201d\n\n\n\u201dIt has every episode of Star Trek under one umbrella for the first time in entertainment history.\u201d\n\n\n\u201dAt $5.99 per month with limited commercial interruptions, it is an affordable service compared to other streaming platforms.\u201d\n\n\n\u201dThe DVD box set of Star Trek: Voyager used to cost upwards of $200.\u201d\n\n\n\u201dOver 45,000 episodes and movies all under one umbrella for the first time in entertainment history.\u201d\n\n\n\u201dThe future of the Star Trek franchise is entirely dependent on the success of Paramount+.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to extend conversation with SCP-8597-1B beyond these phrases have invariably failed.\n\n\nAttempts have been made to let SCP-8597-1B share its Paramount+ login information, however, it has become understood that SCP-8597-1B does not know how to read nor use a keyboard regardless of language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarch\n\n\norb\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- wise (ask him questions he'll know the answer)\n\n\n \n- can sing unreleased beatles songs\n\n\n \n- do NOT feed after midnight\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1C is a large, floating, luminescent sphere capable of speech in English. SCP-8597-1C will only speak when prompted with a question.

Upon manifestation, SCP-8597-1D will asphyxiate unless the user is in a non-chlorinated body of water during its manifestation.\n\n\nSCP-8597-1D has no discernable anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay\n\n\nlemon devin\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- literary enthusiast\n\n\n \n- life of the party\n\n\n \n- likes to ski (wink)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1E is a lemon that constantly and loudly emits a variety of EDM songs by musician John Summit. Should cocaine be placed on or near SCP-8597-1C, an appropriately sized pair of sunglasses will appear on its \"face\" for 15-30 minutes.\n\n\nThe music SCP-8597-1E produces can be muted when it is given access to the \nVice.com\n editorial archives circa 1998-2006. During this activity, SCP-8597-1E will occasionally interupt its readings to vocalize that \u201cVice used to be so fucking good, man.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njune\n\n\nmy guy abe\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- has court-mandated anger management classes every thursday\n\n\n \n- no car\n\n\n \n- addicted to paypal's \"pay in 4\" program\n\n\n \n- all around nice guy\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1F is a humanoid entity resembling Gritty, the mascot of the NHL's Philadelphia Flyers. All efforts to remove this costume have been fruitless. SCP-8597-1F is capable of speech in English.

Every line of dialogue is followed by the episode being paused and SCP-8597-1G making sounds akin to hysteric laughing for up to 10 seconds before resuming the program.\n\n\nFollowing the death of actor Matthew Perry on 2023/10/28, SCP-8597-1G has reacted to all dialogue delivered by the character Chandler with intense, protracted screaming before continuing the episode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naugust\n\n\nuncle kingy\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- in debt\n\n\n \n- has an iconic catchphrase\n\n\n \n- thousands of dollars in casino comps\n\n\n \n- wanna go play the ponies kid\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1H is a humanoid entity resembling Italian-American actor Frank Vincent.\n\n\nIf prompted to say its \u201ciconic catchphrase\u201d, SCP-8597-1H will declare that it is \u201ctime to fucking gamble!\u201d, before disappearing alongside the subject. Upon reappearing seconds later, subjects will report having spent up a prolonged period of time\u2014 ranging from a day to three weeks\u2014 with SCP-8597-1H in a sprawling casino environment. Activities did not divert from watching SCP-8597-1H repeatedly and invariably lose at a variety of games before being forcibly ejected from the premises and reappearing in baseline reality.\n\n\nUpon using wi-fi connected devices following SCP-8597-1H\u2019s manifestation, the subject will find that money from any connected banking accounts has been deposited into the DraftKings Sportsbook website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseptember\n\n\nunsophisticated doug\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- what a guy\n\n\n \n- real winner\n\n\n \n- living legend\n\n\n \n- has a shitty brother\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1I is an inanimate statue resembling a bald humanoid.

It has not been observed to move from its point of manifestation, instead electing to remain idle until engaged by an individual. If engaged, SCP-8597-1J will ask that the individual assist them in completing a task. SCP-8597-1J converses in Chinese.\n\n\nThe nature of these requests vary incidentally, but typically require the individual to retrieve one or more items to then bring back to SCP-8597-1J. Upon completion, SCP-8597-1J will reward the individual.\n\n\nA table of example tasks has been recorded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nReward\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8597-1J requested that the subject collect 22 sticks.\n\n\nUpon retrieving the objects from the exterior of the site, SCP-8597-1J presented the subject with a bundle of wool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8597-1J requested that the subject corral 4 wild boar, each having suddenly manifested upon the Site-322 premises.\n\n\nTask accomplished with minimal collateral damage. SCP-8597-1J presented the subject with a chrysanthemum flower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8597-1J requested that the subject slay \u201cFucanglong, Underworld Divine General\u201d.\n\n\nA massive entity resembling a black-scaled dragon as stylized in Chinese mythology manifested inside a subterranean chamber underneath Site-322. The Site was thrown into immediate lockdown while an appropriate Mobile Task Force was secured for deployment. Upon the target\u2019s neutralization, SCP-8597-1J presented the subject with a small wooden cartridge containing a silver powder, which, according to the entity, \u201ccan be used alongside a crafting kit to create arrowheads\u201d. The Foundation has yet to ascertain a use for this item. Completion of this task yielded 15 casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued testing of SCP-8597-1J has been suspended until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnovember\n\n\nbig maggie\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- always there for you\n\n\n \n- real sweetheart\n\n\n \n- cutie pie\n\n\n \n- running a bit late\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1K is a Peterbilt 389 semi-trailer truck. SCP-8597-1K\u2019s manifestation is delayed, instead appearing at an indeterminate point within 24 hours of viewing the slide under appropriate conditions. Manifestation occurs within a 1\u00a0km radius of the subject\u2019s current position, typically on a nearby road. SCP-8597-1K will then rapidly accelerate towards the subject with enhanced force, demolishing any objects, structures, or individuals in the way of its path. Upon making physical contact with the subject, SCP-8597-1K will then de-manifest. Any destruction or damage caused by the entity\u2014 including casualties\u2014 will be reversed and nullified upon its disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecember\n\n\nunsophisticated craig\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n- buffoon\n\n\n \n- absolute fool\n\n\n \n- waste of space\n\n\n \n- has a really cool brother\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8597-1L is an animated clay sculpture resembling a nondescript ape beating a shield with a bat.

Despite pulling the slide corresponding to his birth month, no SCP-8597 entity manifested. Instead, White's phone crashed due to overheating.\n\n\nOver the course of an hour, White's stomach became incredibly distended and bloated. He was sent to the Site infirmary, where nurses noted White's body temperature was 10 degrees below baseline. Attempts were made to sedate White, all of which failed, and his assertions of intense pain became continuous screaming as the mass grew larger. The mass squirmed violently within White before throwing him off the bed into a kneeling position. The mass could be seen moving up White's digestive tract, causing extreme distension to his chest and neck that should have sent White into unconsciousness or proven fatal. White expelled a black, viscous fluid from his mouth, followed by two hand-like implements attached to a 25-pound, amorphous blob of flesh, hair tissue, teeth, and eyeballs.\n\n\nWhite subsequently passed out but made a full recovery.

        "Addendum 8597.1: SCP-8597-1 Instances",
        "Addendum 8597.2: Incident 8597-Alpha\nOn November 24th, 2022, Junior Researcher Francesco White (born February 29th, 1992), performed a standard test with SCP-8597. Despite pulling the slide corresponding to his birth month, no SCP-8597 entity manifested. Instead, White's phone crashed due to overheating.\nOver the course of an hour, White's stomach became incredibly distended and bloated. He was sent to the Site infirmary, where nurses noted White's body temperature was 10 degrees below baseline. Attempts were made to sedate White, all of which failed, and his assertions of intense pain became continuous screaming as the mass grew larger. The mass squirmed violently within White before throwing him off the bed into a kneeling position. The mass could be seen moving up White's digestive tract, causing extreme distension to his chest and neck that should have sent White into unconsciousness or proven fatal. White expelled a black, viscous fluid from his mouth, followed by two hand-like implements attached to a 25-pound, amorphous blob of flesh, hair tissue, teeth, and eyeballs.\nWhite subsequently passed out but made a full recovery. When his phone was powered back on, he accessed SCP-8597 again, which displayed a single slide.\nRepeated testing on subjects born on the Leap Day (February 29th) has resulted in the same or similar outcomes."
