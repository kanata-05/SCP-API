SCP-8750 is a Type 4-U Reality Bender.\n2\n SCP-8750 is currently contained at Site-97 in Brandon, Florida, where they were working when they entered an anomalous coma.\n3\n Relocation of SCP-8750 has been deemed unviable as the manifestation of anomalous properties happens regardless of SCP-8750's location. SCP-8750 has conjured up several spectral entities, designated SCP-8750-1 to SCP-8750-3. The entities manifested by SCP-8750 act out scenarios from SCP-8750's past.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8750\u2019s anomalous nature was found on 2016/12/29 when reports of a child resembling the late Jacob Barker\n4\n, now designated SCP-8750-1 was reported to have been wandering the town aimlessly.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-8750.1\n SCP-8750 was found to affect the area around their house.\n\nReports of SCP-8750-1 led MTF \u0394-29 (\u201cOutside the Box\u201d) to the apartment, where they established a temporary on-site location to collect data. Appearances of SCP-8750-1 also contained a second entity, identified to be a spectral version of SCP-8750, designated SCP-8750-2, as well as the occasional appearance of a third entity. This was identified as Dr. Robert Osprey,\n5\n and is designated SCP-8750-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded Date\n\n\nEntities involved\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/12/31\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 and SCP-8750-2\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 walked around and approached an ice cream truck that appeared during the event. SCP-8750-1 rushed SCP-8750-2 to hand it money, which was used to purchase ice cream. They then proceeded to de-manifest. Audio recordings picked up the conversation, but nothing of importance was noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/1/4\n\n\nSCP-8750-1, SCP-8750-2 and SCP-8750-3\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 is in bed, seemingly unconscious, SCP-8750-2 and SCP-8750-3 are looking over it. A transcript of the audio is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAdditional info:\n In this log, SCP-8750-2 is referred to by their last name, Barker. SCP-8750-3 is referred to as Osprey.\n6\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nBarker and Osprey are standing over their unconscious child. Barker is crying while Osprey has his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\nBarker:\n It's just not fair.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Life isn't fair Ashe, if it wasn't our kid, it would have been someone else's.\n\n\nShe pulls away from him.\n\n\nBarker:\n Okay, and? That wouldn't be my problem. This is our kid. Can you at least try to act sad?\n\n\nOsprey:\n We don't have time left to be sad. We need to try to be strong for him so he can enjoy the time he has left.\n\n\nBarker:\n I'm just\u2026 I'm not that strong, Robert.\n\n\nHe grabs her hand.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Look at him, Ashe. He's sitting there smiling in his sleep. He knows that he gets to visit his favorite theme park tomorrow.\n\n\nHe pauses for a second.\n\n\nOsprey:\n I know it's hard, but you have to try for him. We've got the entire weekend, let's let him enjoy the time he has left.\n\n\nBarker:\n \n(crying)\n I'll try.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded Date\n\n\nEntities involved\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/1/12\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 and SCP-8750-2\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 walks to the playground located across from the apartment complex.

He's our son; don't I get a say?\n\n\nBarker:\n No, you absolutely don't. You don't get a say. You lost that right years ago.\n\n\nOsprey:\n That's bullshit. He's still my kid. He has a right to know.\n\n\nBarker:\n You're only saying that for yourself. Stop being selfish.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Selfish? What a joke. You're preventing me from seeing my child in his last month just so you can have the rest of his time to yourself. You won't even tell him why I can't come around anymore.\n\n\nBarker:\n What happened to letting him enjoy the time he has left? You are a hypocrite.\n\n\nOsprey looks stunned and begins crying.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Things change Ashe, I just want the opportunity to say goodbye to my kid.\n\n\nBarker:\n It isn't happening, Robert. I can't rob him of his happiness.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Then let me do it; let me tell him. We can spend the rest of the time he has left as a family again.\n\n\nBarker:\n \n(crying)\n We stopped being a family ages ago. Just go.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Whatever. Just please think about it. I'm begging you. Please don't rob him of his chance to say goodbye to you.\n\n\nOsprey gets up, walks out the door, and de-manifests. Barker proceeds to kick over some furniture while angrily screaming. After a few moments, they also de-manifest.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded Date\n\n\nEntities involved\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/1/25\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 and SCP-8750-2\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 is walking out the door, it asks -2 \u201cwhere dad is\u201d to which -2 responds with \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They turn out the lights, leave and de-manifest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/1/27\n\n\nSCP-8750-1, SCP-8750-2 and an unidentifiable entity\n\n\nSCP-8750-1 is once again on the bed unconscious; SCP-8750-2 is crying and pleading.

It\u2019s selfish of you to hold on so long. You need to go outside, you can't keep living like this.\n\n\nBarker:\n Fuck you! Six months isn\u2019t long, you aren\u2019t as devastated because you are a deadbeat who was never around!\n\n\nOsprey:\n \n(shouting louder)\n Are you that self-absorbed to not realize that I loved him too? I had no choice Ashe, you kicked me out; you took me out of his life. I've tried again and again; I\u2019ve even taken you to court several times.\n\n\nHe pauses for a moment. Barker tries to interject, but he continues.\n\n\nOsprey:\n I wasn\u2019t even granted visitation without your permission, and now you are trying to say you loved him more than me? I didn't have an option! You are selfish, conceited, and crazy.\n\n\nBarker:\n \n(gasps)\n Excuse me? You didn\u2019t even fucking ask! You never made an effort; you just berated me for how I raised him! You expect me to move on, but I based my entire life around him! He was my child! Mine!\n\n\nOsprey:\n Do you not even hear yourself? He was our child!\n\n\nHe pauses for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nOsprey:\n He\u2019s gone now. What is moping around, blaming me, and doing nothing with your goddamn life gonna do for you? It\u2019s so selfish of you. You barely go to work anymore and keep lounging around. How about you grow up? Grow the fuck up, Ashe. It's embarassing.\n\n\nBarker:\n You have the audacity to come into my house, insult me, tell me to move on, and tell me how to live my life? You are just as uncaring as ever, Robert! I thought you of all people could have understood my pain!\n\n\nBarker pauses for a moment.\n\n\nBarker:\n (mumbling) Get out.\n\n\nOsprey:\n What?\n\n\nBarker:\n Get the fuck out of my house!\n\n\nThey both go silent for a moment.\n\n\nOsprey:\n Alright. I\u2019ll go.\n\n\nOsprey gets up, heads to the door, and opens it.\n\n\nOsprey:\n I mean it, you need to move the fuck on.\n\n\nThe door slams shut, and they de-manifest.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-8750.2:\n Following the last manifestation, one final event occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded Date\n\n\nEntities involved\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/7/3\n\n\nSCP-8750-1, SCP-8750-2 and the unidentifiable entity.\n\n\nSCP-8750-2 manifested on the floor sobbing.
