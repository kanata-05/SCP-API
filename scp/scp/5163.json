Any requests that involve the handling or removal of the object of its containment must be authorized by the Site Director. While handling SCP-5163, personnel should wear protective gloves and make sure to never allow their skin to come into contact with the object. In the case personnel (accidentally or not) touches SCP-5163, they are to be administrated with amnestics and isolated for observation. Affected personnel is to be restored to their positions only when/if they no longer present significant symptoms of SCP-5163\u2019s effects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5163 appears to be a teddy bear measuring approximately 26\u00a0cm in height with creamy white fur and light blue details. When a human makes physical contact with SCP-5163, the subject will instantly develop a certain level of emotional attachment to the object. The intensity of this effect and the way it manifests over the victims varies with each case, however, it often causes the subjects to consider SCP-5163 as something of extreme importance to themselves. The use of amnestics has proven to be relatively effective in healing affected subjects, although in a few cases subjects developed symptoms of depression after the amnesticization. No other anomalous properties were observed.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5163 was acquired by the Foundation on 29/04/2009 when a group of 3 field agents who were working on an unrelated assignment accidentally found the object in an abandoned house from a rural zone of Texas, which they were planning to occupy for the days needed to complete their duties. After installing surveillance cameras in and outside the house, Agent Nicholas Campbell noticed SCP-5163 on a table inside a room of the house. The object was above a small piece of paper which caught his attention. After grabbing the object to get the paper, Agent Nicholas immediately began to act unusually due to the effects of SCP-5163. The following is the transcript of the video record during the incident.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a05163-001\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon grabbing the object Agent Nicholas starts smiling and staring at it. He then begins to rub the object against his face.\n\n\nAgent Coulson:\n Hey Nick! What the hell are you doing? Stop playing around dude, we got work to do here!\n\n\nAgent Nicholas:\n I know, I know. But isn\u2019t this little boy the cutest thing ever? I can\u2019t leave it here alone. That\u2019s it, I will carry it with me during the rest of our mission and I wanna take it home too.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Reynolds:\n What are you talking about Nick, you okay? We have no time to waste here, did you forget that SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 escaped and we are here looking for evidence of its current whereabouts? Why are you acting like a child? You are not like this. Just throw this damn bear away and focus on the mission.\n\n\nAgent Nicholas:\n I am not understanding you guys. Would you really abandon something this precious in such an isolated and dangerous place? Damn, it seems like you two are crueler than I thought.\n\n\nAgent Coulson:\n You can\u2019t be serious. Let me just get rid of this stupid toy for you.\n\n\nAgent Coulson then approaches Nicholas and slaps away the object from his hands.\n\n\nAgent Nicholas:\n \n(yelling)\n Coulson you bastard! What did it do to you?! How can you treat my dear and cute friend like this? You better have a good explanation, because I am truly pissed off now!\n\n\nAgent Coulson:\n Wait a minute\u2026 You are right. Oh no\u2026 What have I done? I am so ashamed now. I will never forgive myself for this\u2026\n\n\nAgent Nicholas:\n I won\u2019t forgive you either Coulson!!\n\n\nNicholas then proceeds to punch Coulson, who doesn\u2019t react and falls to the ground. Agent Reynolds then holds back Nicholas preventing him to cause more harm to Coulson.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Reynolds:\n Guys just stop. What\u2019s going on with you two? Are you truly fighting over a damn teddy bear? Pretty sure you both would get fired if our superiors find out about this.\n\n\nAgent Nicholas:\n This \u201cdamn teddy bear\u201d is my best friend now! I don\u2019t care if I get fired because of it Reynolds, and I can\u2019t forgive Coulson for hurting him like that! Let go of me Reynolds I want to kill him!\n\n\nAgent Coulson:\n Yeah he is right, Reynolds. I can\u2019t live anymore knowing that I caused harm to our precious friend that means the world to me. I can\u2019t understand why I did something so terrible. To be honest, at this point I don\u2019t really care about my life anymore, so go ahead and kill me guys, make justice for the coolest and cutest teddy bear of all times.\n\n\nAgent Coulson remains laying on the ground, seemingly depressed.\n\n\nAgent Reynolds:\n Okay guys, I am sorry but I can\u2019t allow this situation to continue.\n\n\nAt this point Agent Reynolds applies a sedative on Agent Nicholas who soon falls unconscious.\n\n\nAgent Reynolds:\n Coulson, I hope I won't need to do the same to you. I believe we are dealing with something anomalous here, I will contact the Foundation and request reinforcements.\n\n\nAgent Reynolds then contacts the Foundation, explains the situation, and asks for reinforcements, while Agent Coulson doesn't show any changes in his behavior. 25 minutes later Foundation personnel arrives at the local. Both Agents Nicholas Campbell and Coulson Jones were treated with amnestics and removed from their mission for observation and a psychological evaluation, being replaced by 2 other Agents, while SCP-5163 was contained without further incidents. Although both agents are currently unable to remember their interaction with SCP-5163, they occasionally still claim that they feel as if \"something is missing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Agent Nicholas Campbell was deemed as free of any effects regarding SCP-5163 on 25/08/2013, after stating that he no longer feels anything unusual, while Agent Coulson Jones still claims to feel an \"unexplainable emptiness\", which could mean that SCP-5163's effects might affect certain individuals more than others. Nonetheless, both Agents are currently able to perform their duties without any significant problems.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n The piece of paper found together with the object had the following writing by an unknown subject:\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm so so sorry Kenny, but I can't stay here anymore, I need to be strong and leave you behind even though that feels almost impossible to me. My heart is falling apart and I am crying so much while writing this because I am 100% sure that I will never again find anything as cute and as amazing as you are, but I truly need to go, as I have been spending more than 15 hours just playing with you every day and I need to focus on something else for now\u2026 But know that you are always on my mind, and to be honest, I will probably return to be with you sooner or later, so please just wait for me. This house is yours now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5162\n | SCP-5163 | \nSCP-5164\n \u00bb",
