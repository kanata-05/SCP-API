Furthermore, the item is monitored for any transmission readings. If a transmission is detected, the data shall be decoded and stored accordingly. Subsequently, the current research head\n1\n will be informed of the event.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-6424 is a space probe of unknown origin that is dated to be over 4000 years old. Due to the nature of its discovery, the only functional components of SCP-6424 are its communications dish and a functional data storage module. As of writing, the technology by which these components operate is still undetermined and considered anomalous in nature. However, Foundation researchers have been able to partially reverse-engineer the technology to retrieve information from the data module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly Crash Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the data module, six images were extracted by personnel, designated as SCP-6424-1 through 6. Depicted within the images are photographs of empty space, an unknown celestial object, and SCP-6424. Additionally, distance information of photographed subjects is found within the metadata of the images.\n2\n\n\nUPDATE 05/01/2003:\n\nA design diagram of SCP-6424 was successfully extracted from the data module. Please contact the current research head to be cleared to access the design diagram.\n\n\nAddendum A Discovery:\n\nOn 03/22/2001, SCP-6424 was detected on the far side of the moon. Further research confirmed neither NASA or any GOI equivalents were the origin of the probe. After four days from first sighting, SCP-6424 entered Earth's atmosphere and crash landed in the Amazon rainforest. After touchdown was confirmed, Foundation personnel were dispatched to secure the object and maintain a perimeter around it. After 2 hours of on-location analysis, the item was deemed to not exhibit any harmful anomalous influence in its vicinity. Afterwards, the item was loaded onto a transportation truck to transit to Site-91. A cover story of a meteorite-caused forest fire was disseminated to avoid suspicion.\n\n\nAddendum B SCP-6424 -1 to -6 instances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6424-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6424-1\n\n\nDistance from subject:\n N/A\n\n\nObservations:\n An image of empty space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6424-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6424-2\n\n\nDistance from subject:\n 15000\u00a0km\n\n\nObservations:\n An image of an unknown celestial body.

A design diagram was extracted from the data module after two years from discovery. According to diagram, the camera would have been fitted on the underside of the object. It is hypothesized that at some point after SCP-6424-1 to -4 were photographed, the camera module detached from the main body. It is unknown what is the catalyst for the separation. Nevertheless, SCP-6424 was still able to control and communicate with the detached camera module through unknown means. Subsequently, it is believed that the camera module was near or on the celestial body when SCP-6424-5 and -6 were photographed, then sent the data to SCP-6424.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Two\u00a0New\u00a0Transmissions\u00a0Detected\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Decoding...\u00a0Decoding...\u00a0Decoding...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SELECT THE IMAGE TO INITIATE DECODING PROCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from subject: 1,205,004,000km\n\n[PLEASE INSERT YOUR OBSERVATIONS]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SELECT THE IMAGE TO INITIATE DECODING PROCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from subject: 1,205,003,000km\n\n[PLEASE INSERT YOUR OBSERVATIONS]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
