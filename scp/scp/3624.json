All SCP-3624-1 instances of which associated subjects have expired (as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, four) are to be kept in standard containment units. The size of the cells is to be adjusted for each individual instance.\n\n\nGoI-435's operations are to be monitored and all SCP-3624 events are to be interrupted. Zoos and animal shelters in the designated high-risk zones (for details view Document-3624-G13) are to be monitored and all cases of missing exotic animals are to be screened for potential GoI-435 involvement. MTF Gamma-13 (\"Rosemary's Lover\") is assigned to the task of dismantling the organization and all relevant information is to be reported to the Task Force leader.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3624 is a thaumaturgic ritual consisting of a number of rites and gestures. It utilizes a number of requisites, most important being multiple animal body parts and silver knives. The ritual involves sewing these body parts together in a shape superficially resembling an animal. The shapes vary in size and form with the smallest documented measuring 1\u00a0m in height and 2\u00a0m in length and the largest 3\u00a0m in height and 12\u00a0m in length. After an SCP-3624 event, the body will be buried next to the site of the ritual. After approximately half an hour, the \"animal\" will become animate and begin displaying life functions, becoming an instance of SCP-3624-1. This happens regardless of how compatible the body parts are with each other and will take place even in biologically implausible cases. Organs of SCP-3624-1 instances are fully functioning and normal processes take place.\n\n\nThese rituals are connected to a cult called \"The Gravediggers\" associated with ancient Gothic pagan beliefs (designated Group of Interest-435). The group regularly attempts to carry out the rituals, most often in relatively isolated locations. A nearly completed ritual was documented by Foundation operatives and other SCP-3624 events have only slightly deviated from it.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Transcript of SCP-3624 Event-2\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/201\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n The second documented ritual took place in an abandoned church in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Germany and was allowed to progress to near completion. The building was under surveillance using planted cameras and microphones and surrounded by Foundation forces.\n\n\n10:12 PM:\n Members of GoI-435 gather on the pews, while the cult leader and his helpers set up a wooden altar shaped in the likeness of a coffin.\n\n\n10:14 PM:\n The leader delivers a speech, announcing that the \"time of burial\" is coming and that the ritual will bring it closer. The monologue includes a description of damage that SCP-3624 will bring to the world and an assurance that the members of the \"ancient faith\" will be the only ones spared.\n\n\n10:30 PM:\n The ritual begins, helpers bring previously slaughtered animals (common vampire bat \nDesmodus rotundus\n, common cow \nBos taurus\n, Eurasian lynx \nLynx lynx\n, brown bear \nUrsus arctos\n, Atlantic cod \nGadus morhua\n) to the altar and begin cutting their limbs. The cult starts chanting. The language was later identified to be ancient Germanic in origin.\n\n\n10:35 PM:\n Body parts are sewn together, the leader joins the chant.\n\n\n10:37 PM:\n Three cult members begin self-mutilation with knives and other sharp implements, severing a few of their fingers and throwing them on the altar.\n\n\n10:48 PM:\n A live pig is brought in. The animal is hung over the altar on scaffolding. The leader slits its throat and collects the blood with a bowl.\n\n\n10:51 PM:\n Four more cultists mutilate themselves. One tries to cut his arm at the elbow, but passes out from blood loss before completion.\n\n\n10:56 PM:\n After performing a number of gestures the cult leader begins pouring the blood into the mouth of the corpse. Mission command orders an assault on the building.\n\n\n10:57 PM:\n Containment team Beta enters the building and stops the ritual.\n\n\nAfterword:\n Foundation forces suffered no casualties. 14 GoI-435 members were captured including the leader, remaining 23 were killed in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example contained instance of SCP-3624-1 is characterized by:\n\n\u2022 Head of \nFelis catus\n (house cat),\n\n\u2022 Torso of \nCanis lupus familiaris\n (domestic dog),\n\n\u2022 Front legs of \nUrsus arctos\n (brown bear),\n\n\u2022 Lack of hind legs,\n\n\u2022 Tail of \nSus scrofa domesticus\n (domestic pig).\n\nIt was recovered from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Wales after reports of a \"monster\" in the nearby woods.\n\n\nThe aim of the SCP-3624 ritual is presumed to be a creation of an entity hostile to all sentient life, based on interrogations of GoI-435 members and collected scriptures. Despite this intended goal, SCP-3624-1 instances are generally friendly towards humans. The anomalies imitate the behavior, diet and sounds of animals that they superficially resemble. After becoming animate, the entities will begin moving around the area where ritual took place, seeking a person with whom they could form a relationship, referred to as bond.\n\n\nSo far, all SCP-3624-1 instances have formed a bond, finding an \"owner\". Individuals that the entities view as their associated subjects perceive them as a common domesticated animal, such as dogs or cats. SCP-3624-1 instances form a strong relationship with these and will go to great lengths to protect them. The anomalies seem to prefer individuals isolated from the society, often targeting old or handicapped individuals. So far no entity has ever harmed its bonded subject and the relationship has even brought positive effects for the subjects, including improvements in mental health.\n\n\nSCP-3624-1 instances are strongly emotionally bonded and will enter catatonic state if separated from their associated subject for longer periods of time. If the associated person expires, the entity will show signs of grief and stay around the place of residence. At this stage, the anomalies are safe to be retrieved and are unlikely to display hostility, unless directly provoked.\n\n\nAddendum 3624-A:\n Transcript of SCP-3624 Event-1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0document\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/201\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n After reports of \"cultists\" in an abandoned village in the woods near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Germany a team consisting of five Foundation agents was dispatched, including Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent G\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent T\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

You\u2019re right, I don\u2019t see many visitors here, mail barely reaches me. And no one visits an old grandma like me. At least now I have a companion.\n\n\nAgent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Does it behave well? No problems with it?\n\n\nPoI-3624-1:\n Oh, it\u2019s very calm. I barely see him during the day. He helps me keep all the vermin out. I will need to cut his claws soon. He leaves giant scratch marks trying to shorten them. Just look at this door frame! This house is so old, I have a feeling I'm barely keeping it from falling apart, especially with Jonsey around.\n\n\nAgent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n The wind is settling down, I have to get going.

Agent G\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That's a wolf head. But the torso is too big. It looks like a\u2026 Agent T\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That's a zebra torso. It could be the one missing from the zoo! Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The legs look cat-like. Tiger? Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I said, they are crazies. Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Command, they are burying the\u2026 Thing in the hole. Command: Don't interfere. Agent W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We weren't planning to. Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: OK, the group is getting into the cars. They are leaving! Command: Tell me you got everything on tape. Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sure thing. I could identify at least a dozen. Command: Alright, we'll be on the lookout for cars. Are they gone? Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yes, we're approaching the grave and building. Agent G\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We're inside. Oh God, the smell! Seems like they cleaned everything up. There are some blood splatters. Here are the missing limbs! Agent W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Should I start unearthing our little chimera? Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Do it. D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will join you. Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Always getting the best job. Agent W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Where is your optimism? Hold this shovel. [IRRELEVANT DATA REMOVED] Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Jesus Christ! Oh fuck! Command: Report! Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Get away from me! Agent W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It's alive! Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Stay away from it! Command: Alpha, report! Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: It's running away! Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Command? Our kitty started moving and then went for the woods. Agent G\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Damn, it's fast! No way I'm chasing this! Agent S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, you alright? Agent D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah, it just\u2026 Pushed me? Kind of? Command: Alright, get your gear and head back. We're sending a chopper, hopefully we'll track this thing down from the air. <End Log> Afterword The instance of SCP-3624-1 was not found until ten days after, when it was located in close proximity to the house of PoI-3624-1 by a chopper. Agents who were part of the search operation reported hearing howling in the distance. PoI-3624-1 was apparently on a walk with the entity and was engaging in playful behavior with it. All members of the cult involved in the event were tracked down and interrogated.",
        "Interviewed: Person of Interest-3624-1 Interviewer: Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Foreword: Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 disguised as a postman managed to enter the house of PoI-3624-1, the first identified subject bonded with SCP-3624-1, and conduct an interview. <Begin Log> PoI-3624-1: Here\u2019s your tea. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thank you very much, you\u2019re too kind. PoI-3624-1: Oh, the weather\u2019s so awful recently, it would be a sin not to treat you with something warm. Opening doors can be heard. PoI-3624-1: Ah, there you are Jonesy! I see you are liking the new doors. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That\u2019s a beautiful pet. PoI-3624-1: You think so? I always wanted to have a cat. But my husband was allergic to them, we couldn\u2019t buy one. And then, a year after his death this magnificent beast stumbled into my house. It was winter, as cold as this one. Have you noticed that winters are becoming colder and colder? And then they say in the news that we\u2019re having global warming. Ha! What a bunch of fools! Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Laughs Very interesting, what was it doing so far from any villages? When was it? PoI-3624-1: A few days ago. You\u2019re right, I don\u2019t see many visitors here, mail barely reaches me. And no one visits an old grandma like me. At least now I have a companion. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Does it behave well? No problems with it? PoI-3624-1: Oh, it\u2019s very calm. I barely see him during the day. He helps me keep all the vermin out. I will need to cut his claws soon. He leaves giant scratch marks trying to shorten them. Just look at this door frame! This house is so old, I have a feeling I'm barely keeping it from falling apart, especially with Jonsey around. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The wind is settling down, I have to get going. Thank you very much for the tea. <End Log>",

All SCP-3624-1 instances of which associated subjects have expired (as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, four) are to be kept in standard containment units.

    "description": "SCP-3624 is a thaumaturgic ritual consisting of a number of rites and gestures. It utilizes a number of requisites, most important being multiple animal body parts and silver knives. The ritual involves sewing these body parts together in a shape superficially resembling an animal. The shapes vary in size and form with the smallest documented measuring 1\u00a0m in height and 2\u00a0m in length and the largest 3\u00a0m in height and 12\u00a0m in length. After an SCP-3624 event, the body will be buried next to the site of the ritual. After approximately half an hour, the \"animal\" will become animate and begin displaying life functions, becoming an instance of SCP-3624-1. This happens regardless of how compatible the body parts are with each other and will take place even in biologically implausible cases. Organs of SCP-3624-1 instances are fully functioning and normal processes take place.",
