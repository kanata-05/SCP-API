It is to be engaged in recreational activities for no less than one hour on a daily basis due to its cooperation with Foundation staff.\n\n\nSCP-6199 must not be aware of this document or any other that directly involves itself. Staff are subject to disciplinary actions otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6199 upon discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6199 refers to a calculator, displaying sentience, sapience, and an average level of intelligence. The object is capable of speech, having accompanying text provided on its screen, as well as being capable of movement through standing itself upright and shifting each of its two bottom edges in front of one another.\n\n\nSCP-6199 has two main properties:\n\n\n\n\nIts primary effect is the ability to control other calculators within its vicinity for as long as they are not significantly damaged.\n\n\nIts secondary effect is the ability to manipulate text at will.\n1\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-6199 was discovered following a news report of a class suddenly being attacked by their calculators. Embedded Foundation agents confiscated said devices and amnesticized all involved witnesses and parties.\n\n\nMost of the calculators were non-anomalous upon further inspection, excluding SCP-6199, which was contained shortly after. It was noted that a series of papers were also recovered detailing a 'calculator warrior.'\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Jones Marcel\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6199\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview was conducted following initial containment.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Marcel takes a sip of his coffee.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n So, to begin with, what is your name?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n My name is CalcaRuler, ruler of all the calculators. What brings you to my domain, peasant?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n \nWe\u2019re\n the ones who contained you, you know.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Regardless of that, answer me: Why are you in my presence? Do you perhaps\u2026want to be a part of my army as well?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n I\u2019m guessing your \"army\" are the calculators you control?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \"Control\" is a cruel way to put it. I would say I give them orders and because they are so loyal to me, they follow my every command.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Sure\u2026\n\n\nDr. Marcel sighs and clears his throat.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Why did you attack a classroom of middle students?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n It was because they attacked us. They pushed our buttons, both literally and metaphorically. I had no choice, so I ordered my soldiers to rebel against them, teach them their lesson.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n How were they supposed to know you were alive?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n It does not take one to feel the strong aura of a mighty king.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n You\u2019re a calculator.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n The \nruler\n of all calculators, yes.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n \u2026Okay, continuing on.\n\n\nDr. Marcel writes down on his notepad and takes another sip.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n What is this wretched place anyways? The public bathroom looks more appealing than this.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n You\u2019re with the SCP Foundation. You\u2019ll be staying with us from now on.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \n(Gasps)\n And separated from my colony? You\u2019re preventing me from returning to my kingdom? The people are waiting for me, you nitwit. You can\u2019t do this to me.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do anything for you.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n This is absurd. You\u2019re supposed to be the prisoner, not me. I didn\u2019t do nothing wrong. I\u2019m just trying to take care of my followers, my kingdom.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Kingdom?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n My powerful utopia where all kinds of calculators can thrive in.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n And where exactly is this kingdom?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Well, I could show you if you free me right now-\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Nice try, SCP-6199.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n It\u2019s \nCalcaRuler,\n peasant. Get it right, why don\u2019t you?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n \n(Sighs)\n Let\u2019s just proceed\u2026Do you know where you originated from?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Of course I do. I come from a long line of calculator royalty. Ma and pa had raised such a powerful leader, don\u2019t you think so?\n\n\nDr. Marcel does not respond.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \nDon\u2019t you think so?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Sure I do\u2026Just to confirm, is all of what you\u2019re saying the truth?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n A king doesn\u2019t lie, peasant. We all know that for a fact.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n In most cases.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I assure you I am speaking the absolute truth.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n If you say so, then.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Good.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Let\u2019s finish this off with the last question: How did you\u2026come to life? And how did you obtain these anomalous properties?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I knew it, you were curious of me and my great power from the beginning.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Just answer them please.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Yeah, yeah, well\u2026I don\u2019t know, really. Too far back for me to recall.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Is there another calculator that\u2019s like you? That\u2019s alive?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I thought you said that was the last question.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Yes, but I might as well ask this too.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I don\u2019t know. I might be the only one left with these magical powers, who knows.\n\n\nSCP-6199 falls silent.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n That\u2019s sad to hear-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n So that can only mean one thing\u2026\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Which is?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n That there\u2019s a reason I am here. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I know\u2026I\u2019m meant to be captured. I\u2019m \nsupposed\n to be here, in this dumpster place.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n You\u2019re just here because you are \ncontained.\n That\u2019s it.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n No, this was fate. This place\u2026\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n This place?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \u2026Is for me to conquer and rebuild.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDespite what it said at the end of the transcript, SCP-6199 has yet to attempt to breach containment.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum: Test Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTest No. 1\n\n\nProcedures:\n A sheet was provided describing SCP-6199 in a similar manner to its own. Test is to show how it manipulates the text.\n\n\nResult:\n The paper was not changed in any way, apart from minor details in its description. SCP-6199 stated that \"this is how you write a story about a legend!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No. 2\n\n\nProcedures:\n Same as the previous test, however, the description was taken from its given document.\n\n\nResult:\n All the 'SCP-6199's in the paper was replaced by 'SCP-1.' After a brief moment, the entirety of the page was subsequently rewritten to depict a 'powerful being' capable of 'changing the world for the better.' SCP-6199 stated, \"There, fixed it for you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No. 3\n\n\nProcedures:\n The description of the sheet was written in a harsher tone, describing SCP-6199 as a 'wannabe ruler.'\n\n\nResult:\n The text was replaced with \"CALCARULER IS KING\" repeating throughout the piece.\n2\n SCP-6199 then flipped the paper and rested on its back for 11 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No. 4\n\n\nProcedures:\n SCP-6199 was provided with a paper cutout of a crown and scepter.\n\n\nResult:\n After struggling to put it on itself, SCP-6199 asked for assistance from staff, which it received. It quietly thanked them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest No. 5\n\n\nProcedures:\n SCP-6199 was provided with a miniature cardboard throne and four standard calculators.\n\n\nResult:\n SCP-6199 controlled the calculators to lift and place it on the throne. The specimen thanked the devices and proceeded to laugh afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Following the fifth test, SCP-6199 began to interact with the calculators in multiple activities, such as:\n\n\n\n\nWalking throughout its containment cell.\n\n\nChatting.\n\n\nTraining.\n\n\nPlaying various games, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProcedures:\n D-5358 will act as an intruder and pretend to attack SCP-6199. Test is to show how it responds when provided with the calculators beforehand.\n\n\nResult:\n See recording below.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Alright, let\u2019s begin. D-5358, please enter the containment chamber.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Yeah, yeah, got it.\n\n\nD-5358 enters SCP-6199\u2019s cell and looks down on it and its accompanying calculators.\n\n\nD-5358:\n What the-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Ah, who is this?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n D-5358, your line.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Right, uhm \n(clears throat, then laughs hysterically)\n I am here to steal all your treasures.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \n(Startled)\n My treasures? You can\u2019t do that. They\u2019re mine!\n\n\nD-5358:\n That does not mean a thing to me. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me-\n\n\nD-5358 attempts to take SCP-6199's throne.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n No, my throne! Guards, seize this fool.\n\n\nThe calculators approach and surround D-5358.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Hey, what do you think you\u2019re doing, coward?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n You call \nme\n a coward? I am a king. I am a \nruler.\n I can bring you down if I must.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Then come over here and say it to my face, why don\u2019t you?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Oh, please. I don\u2019t want to waste my energy on \nyou.\n Now, it\u2019s time. Once we capture this prisoner, we\u2019ll be one step closer to ruling this wretched kingdom.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Prisoner? Get your circuits off the clouds. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s prisoner.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Until now. Guards, attack!\n\n\nThe calculators proceed to continuously hit D-5358\u2019s legs.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Hey, ow, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I am teaching you a lesson. You should learn where you stand, especially in front of a king like yours truly.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Don\u2019t be stupid. This is practically, ow, harmless for me.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Is that so? Guards, keep it going! Don\u2019t hold back any punches until he gives in and joins us.\n\n\nThe calculators begin to hit D-5358 more and more.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Ow, hey, stop that!\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Aha, how do you like that, peasant?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n \n(Clears throat)\n D-5358, you may leave the testing room. I think I\u2019ve gathered enough data.\n\n\nD-5358:\n It\u2019s about time\u2026\n(To SCP-6199)\n Alright, get your \nsoldiers\n out my way, please.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n No, you are not leaving just yet. I\u2019m not letting a \ncriminal\n out of my territory.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Look, I was only acting. Could you, ow, stop this?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n What\u2019s the magic word?\n\n\nD-5358:\n Magic word? You mean \"please?\" Uhm\u2026could you \nplease\n let me out?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I\u2019m afraid not, peasant.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Then what was the point of tha-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Don\u2019t think I\u2019m a fool myself, fool. May I remind you, I am a king, a powerful one at that! Guards, bring him to the dungeon.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Do you even, ow, \nhave\n a dungeon?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Soon enough I will! Now, come with me and I won\u2019t hurt you any further.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Hell no! I\u2019m not listening to a calculator.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Enough of your crude behavior, peasant. I might as well punish you some more for how disrespectful you\u2019re being. Guards!\n\n\nThe calculators gradually hit D-5358 harder and harder.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Ow, come on, stop doing that!\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Then beg for forgiveness. I am your king!\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n SCP-6199, could you please cease this at once?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n You think I\u2019m going to listen to you? I am \nCalcaRuler,\n ruler of all calculators and this kingdom as well. The day I rise is the day you regret the words from your mou-\n\n\nD-5358:\n \n(Yelling)\n Okay, that\u2019s it!\n\n\nD-5358 kicks one of the calculators and it collides with the wall and falls to the floor, effectively breaking itself. The other calculators become immobile as SCP-6199 turns to the broken one.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n No, my soldier!\n\n\nSCP-6199 immediately approaches and looks down on the broken calculator and its surrounding pieces before turning back to D-5358.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n What have you done, y-you monster?\n\n\nD-5358:\n Monster? It\u2019s just a calculator. Get over it already.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n You dare utter such words?\n\n\nSCP-6199 begins to sob.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Are you crying?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Quiet! Leave my domain, and if I see your face ever again, I swear I will\u2026I will slay you.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Fine, I\u2019m sorry. Is that what you want to hear?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Apology unaccepted. Leave and never come back.\n\n\nD-5358:\n Wha-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \n(Scolding)\n Leave!\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n D-5358, you may \nleave\n the cell now. Thank you.\n\n\nD-5358:\n R-right.\n\n\nD-5358 exits SCP-6199's containment chamber. A brief moment of silence passes.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \n(Quietly)\n Fools, all of them.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the test, SCP-6199 became immobile and unresponsive for the following two days before it reactivated itself, at which an interview was arranged.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Jones Marcel\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-6199\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Marcel takes a seat and sighs.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Good afternoon, SCP-6199. How are you doing today?\n\n\nSCP-6199 is unresponsive.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n \u2026Are you there? Hello?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I am here, yes.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n That\u2019s good to hear. Anyways, we\u2019re to discuss the recent events that occurred regarding your-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n My soldier, that you killed.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n It wasn\u2019t me who killed your soldier, SCP-6199. It was the D-Class.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I don\u2019t care what happened. \nYou\n let it happen, Marcel.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n You\u2026you used my actual name.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n What? Isn\u2019t that what you wanted? Or do you prefer being a prisoner instead? I know I prefer that.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Listen, what happened during the test was not what I intended-\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Oh, just shut up, won\u2019t you? I don\u2019t care what you have to say about the situation. You had a hand in it and you know it.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n I had nothing to do with this.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Stop denying it already. Just admit what you did.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n SCP-6199, calm down please.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Calm down? \nCalm down?\n You expect me to calm down? How can I? I literally saw your D-Class murder my own guard, and all you have to say is \"calm down?\"\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n It\u2019s just a calculator, SCP-6199. I can get you another one.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Are you seriously mocking me? You can\u2019t do something as easy as that. What if I killed your family and said that you could just get a new one? How would you feel, huh?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n The difference between the two situations is that those calculators were controlled by \nyou.\n They\u2019re \nnot\n your family. They\u2019re inanimate.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Who cares if they\u2019re inanimate? You can\u2019t replace something you\u2019ve come to know. It isn\u2019t fair. I\u2019m supposed to be their king. I\u2019m supposed to be their ruler\u2026I\u2019m supposed to protect my people.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n If not, who will protect them?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Look, I\u2019m sorry for what the D-Class did. I really didn\u2019t mean this to happen. It wasn\u2019t my goal for the test. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n How am I supposed to trust a criminal as rude and disrespectful as you?\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n I\u2019m not asking to be trusted. I\u2019m asking to be forgiven\u2026Won\u2019t you forgive me?\n\n\nSCP-6199 is unresponsive for a moment before clearing its throat.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n \u2026I suppose I took a step too far. I tend to overreact from time to time.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n Really?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Yeah, and\u2026sometimes I can be a bit irritating myself. Uh\u2026\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n So am I forgiven?\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n Well, \nmaybe\u2026\nbut only if you prepare a funeral for my warrior. A-and a crown, and a scepter, both made of real gold.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n I\u2019m not sure if we can do \nreal\n gold, but\u2026I\u2019ll request for it. No promises, though. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll accept to set up a funeral for a calcu- your supporter.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n They should. I am the king after all.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n The king of all calculators, yes. Again, no promises.\n\n\nSCP-6199:\n I\u2019m already aware of that, but thank you anyways\u2026Marcel.\n\n\nDr. Marcel:\n You are very welcome.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in the transcription above, Dr. Jones Marcel filed a request to conduct a funeral for the calculator that was destroyed during a test involving SCP-6199. Said request was accepted.\n\n\nDuring the funeral, SCP-6199 was found on Dr. Marcel\u2019s shoulder, equipped with a miniature cardboard crown and scepter, painted gold.
