SCP-1634 may not be handled or utilized without permission from at least two Level-3 personnel. Only D-Class personnel may use SCP-1634. Additional security is required when utilizing D-Class personnel with a history of extreme violence and/or sociopathy.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1634 is a simple metal circlet constructed from a thick ring of iron inlaid around its inner circumference with human skeletal muscle. Neither of the primary components show any sign of decay, although microscopic samples of SCP-1634's metals and tissue have oxidized and decomposed at a non-anomalous rate following excision. SCP-1634 also holds a complete set of 32 adult human teeth with roots partially embedded around its upper rim. Complementary deformities in several of the teeth suggest that they were taken from a single individual. The teeth are also much older than the material surrounding them, dating to the mid or late 2nd century CE while the main body of the artifact was formed using metal casting techniques not generally known until the late 1600's. SCP-1634 also shows signs of recent modification, carrying a microSD slot with circuitry integrated and interwoven through its musculature. Any memory card inserted in SCP-1634 will have its data erased and begin to accumulate SCP-1634-1.\n\n\nWhen SCP-1634 is placed on the head of an awake and alert human being, the subject will lose consciousness over the course of 30-90 seconds and remain unconscious and unresponsive for roughly \u2588 hours afterward. During this period, the individual wearing SCP-1634 will experience an episode of vivid dreaming in which they self-identify as the dream's protagonist. Autonomy and cognitive thought are retained throughout the dream-state, although lucidity (i.e., the knowledge that one is dreaming) is absent in the vast majority of cases. Repeated testing has confirmed that dreams experienced under the influence of SCP-1634 invariably follow a consistent order of events:\n\n\n\n\nThe protagonist finds him/herself in an arena-like setting\n\n\nThe protagonist is presented with a variety of ancient weapons including swords, maces, and flagella\n\n\nLarge animals (lions, giraffes, etc.) - tethered or otherwise incapacitated - begin to fill the arena\n\n\nIt is given to understand that the protagonist may kill the animals as he/she desires\n\n\nRegardless of the protagonist's actions, crippled or emaciated human beings begin to appear\n\n\nThe protagonist perceives that the non-threatening humans are \u201cenemies\u201d or \u201cgiants\u201d and is invited to slay them\n\n\nRegardless of the protagonist's actions, perception of human and animal victims becomes increasingly distorted\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the subject rapidly regains consciousness. If SCP-1634 is not removed at this point or shortly after (<\u2588m) another period of unconsciousness will ensue and the above sequence of events will re-initiate. This cycle may continue indefinitely if not interrupted. Removing SCP-1634 from a subject already in a dream-state will not shorten the period of unconsciousness, although it appears to bring an abrupt end to the associated dream.\n\n\nMost individuals in tests of SCP-1634 have described the experience as \u201cdisorienting,\u201d sometimes reporting a strong sense of moral conflict associated with acting violently toward helpless but sentient victims. Both of these effects have been shown to decrease after repeated use.\n\n\nSCP-1634-1 is the designation given to data found on memory cards inserted in SCP-1634 after use. The data consists of video files encrypted using the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 codec with filenames formed of a six-digit serial number prefixed by the letters \u201cCO.\u201d The videos themselves are compromised by various artifacts (rapid shifts in speed / FOV / focus / color values, static and \u201chissing\u201d noise, audio distorted or dropping out.) Nonetheless, they appear to be visual and auditory records of dreams experienced while wearing SCP-1634, \u201cfilmed\u201d from the protagonist's point of view. Examination of videos created by test subjects assigned to perform specific actions while dreaming suggest that SCP-1634-1 videos are accurate in their representation of each individual experience. Thus far, none of the videos have exceeded 6 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0transcript\u00a0of\u00a0Recording\u00a01634-1-01\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject is Researcher J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who volunteered for the first \u201ccarded\u201d experiment after safely conducting several unrecorded tests on D-Class personnel.\n\n\n00:34 - View angle narrows and centers on a blurred distortion near the center of the arena. The focus adjusts until it is revealed to be a large wooden peg or post hammered into the dirt floor. The field of vision widens (with accompanying lens distortion) to include approximately 20 animals tied to individual posts. Among those recognizable are a male African lion \n(Panthera leo)\n, a striped hyena \n(Hyaena hyaena)\n, a Persian deer buck \n(Dama mesopotamica)\n, and a hornless bovine (species undetermined).\n\n\n00:42 - An unidentified voice is heard with words registering clearly as though spoken very close to the viewer: \u201cThy prey lies bleeding. Go forth and smite.\u201d Deep lacerations appear on the gathered animals' abdomens and hindquarters.\n\n\n01:05 - Subject's voice is heard on the recording - intelligible but with extreme high-frequency attenuation: \"Hello. Hello? Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming?\" Subject repeats the question eight additional times with varying inflection, during which time the perspective shifts from the tethered animals to the protagonist's right hand (now seen to be holding a late-Roman \nspatha\n sword) and a nearby table holding various weapons including additional \ngladii\n, tridents, and a large hammer.\n\n\n02:00 - Speech continues: \u201cThis is Researcher N\u2588\u2588\u2588 J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I believe I am currently under the influence of SCP-1634. This may be a dream\u2026 possibly a hallucination. The D-Classes all stayed in the room, hooked up to the monitors. \n[A muffled tapping sound is heard.]\n There's no crown on my head. It feels real but I\u2026 don't really understand what's happening to my perspective. I'm not sure if anything is\u2026 being recorded at this point\u2026 or how. \n[pause]\n I am standing in the center of what looks like a large arena or colosseum, filled with\u2026 wounded animals. It looks pretty much like the subjects prior to myself described it. A minute or so ago someone told me to, quote, 'smite them,' unquote. There's a\u2026 sword in my hand. I really don't know who spoke.\u201d\n\n\n03:49 - The first voice is heard as before: \u201cButcher the weak. Ensnare the feeble.\u201d Subject repeats the words.\n\n\n04:04 - Subject is heard saying: \u201cI'm going to try attacking this cow.\u201d The sword sinks several centimeters into the bovine's shoulder before being retracted and the wound is seen to bleed. The animal grunts in pain, partially raising itself and then collapsing again. Subject continues \u201cDear God \n[muffled]\n I-\u2026 That was unexpected. Pardon me, I\u2026 really have no idea how this is done. We should have sent [REDACTED] next. \n[a surge in brown noise or static is heard over several seconds]\n There are\u2026 people, I think, but I can't see them.\u201d\n\n\n05:13 - The first voice speaks again: \u201cBehold, the slaughter.\u201d The video quality fluctuates erratically for several seconds before centering again on the bovine's former resting place, now occupied by three identical naked human males conjoined at the stomach and spine. Audio is silenced, although the mouths of all three individuals move in sync with one another - appearing to form the words \u201cKill us.\u201d\n\n\n05:22 - Subject is heard shouting: \u201cWhat?\u201d with far greater clarity than earlier. Static continues to build and the image begins to wash out, fading to medium gray at 05:32. Video ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Synopsis\u00a0of\u00a0Recording\u00a01634-1-06\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject is D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, transferred from [REDACTED] correctional facility while serving a \u2588\u2588\u2588-year sentence for multiple convictions including aggravated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault and battery, burglary, robbery, kidnapping, vandalism, shoplifting, [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED].
