Participation in AURUM SILKWORM is to be codified as a requirement of MTF Alpha-1 membership.\n\n\nMembers of MTF Alpha-1 who have been exposed to memories with intensity quotients over 20,000 may not be assigned to Overseer Council security details. Such individuals are not to be permitted transfer to other positions within the Foundation or retirement from their posts.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5920 is a specific combination of technologies that identify, extract, and duplicate an individual's memories. Additionally, SCP-5920 converts extracted memories into audiovisual media that can be experienced by other parties through normal exposure. Although replicable within the Foundation, progenitor paratech guarantees anomalous classification until public technology makes similar advancements.\n\n\nSCP-5920 units consist of three components:\n\n\n\n\nA central terminal controls the process and stores extracted memories for processing.\n\n\nAn EEG headset analyzes cerebral activity and hosts micro-needles for insertion through thinner skull sections.\n\n\nA chair equipped with full-body restraints ensures subject safety during high-intensity exposure.\n\n\n\n\nFacilities for large-scale biological matter disposal are frequently used \npost hoc\n, but are not considered integral.\n\n\nSerial use of SCP-5920 amplifies the qualities of extracted memories via filtration through ego constructs. Second-hand experiences are often more potent due to additional layers of psychological baggage, as are third-hand experiences, fourth-hand experiences, etc. As a result, individuals' experiences, preferences, and outlooks influence the qualities of filtered memories, which vary significantly in duration, emotional slant, and intensity. Observing the audiovisual output of high-concentration memories induces a variety of effects within the human body:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity Quotient Range\n\n\nBodily Effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 - 300\n\n\nNone observed. Subjects typically report calming experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n300 - 4,000\n\n\nFluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity depending on each memory's emotional slant. Broad worldviews may be shifted by repeated exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,000 - 20,000\n\n\nSignificant fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity depending on memory slant. Elevated risk of cardiac arrest, internal hemorrhaging, and general organ failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20,000+\n\n\nAll test subjects not previously exposed to moderate-intensity memories have immediately expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5920-A (Original Test Log Samples):\n\n\n\n\n[OPEN\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG]\n\n\n\n\n[CLOSE\u00a0TEST\u00a0LOG]\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 14\n\n\nMemory Donor:\n Janet York\n\n\nTest Subject:\n D-71354\n\n\nPsychological Evaluation Summary:\n D-71354 is a well-adjusted individual with few concerning proclivities.

The girls say it'll do me good.\n\n\nThere's water between my toes now. My feet are wet, and my legs, and I'm diving under. Not sure if I know how to swim, but I'm managing fine.

He\u2019s struggling, but not enough. He\u2019s whining, but it\u2019s just wasting air. He\u2019s blue when he comes up; I push him down again. Heh. Someone\u2019s screaming at me. He\u2019ll be fine though. We've all survived worse. I tell him that, but he just keeps screaming. He won't listen. He just won't fucking listen, so I keep pushing him under. He probably deserves it.
