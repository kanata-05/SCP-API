If an event is confirmed to have happened or is currently ongoing, Mobile Task Force Sigma-301 (\"Rainy Day\") should be deployed to the location to protect bystanders, provide emergency services, and disarm any active explosives if possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5023 is a phenomenon that occurs when 6 or more humans are within 100 meters of a large supply of explosives, causing all subjects to engage in an extremely dangerous game of \"Ultimate Frisbee.\" No participants will be harmed during the proceedings, but structures and objects will be damaged or destroyed as normal.\n\n\nThe events that occur during an SCP-5023 event are consistent across all documented cases and are presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel will stop working and begin to talk amongst themselves, even if doing so is potentially dangerous.\n\n\nA man with a tank top and muscular build\n1\n and a woman with a lacerated and bleeding foot\n2\n will approach the subjects and ask if they would like to play Ultimate Frisbee. Despite the odd appearance of the two entities, most subjects will agree.\n3\n\n\nSCP-5023-B will begin to explain the rules to the subjects while SCP-5023-A will begin to clear an area and shape the explosives by hand. SCP-5023-B will then offer the subjects a wrist band in the colors red or blue.\n4\n\n\nThe game will commence and be played until the supply of explosives is depleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants are largely immune to physical damage during the game, believed to be a by-product of the bracelet. Attempts to recover a bracelet for testing have failed. Both SCP-5023-A and -B have evaded Foundation capture but provided a single interview in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote\u00a0Interview\u00a0|\u00a0SCP-5023\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview conducted by Doctor Alexandra Virgil via drone.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[SCP-5023-B can be seen shouting across the field outside of a munitions factory in [REDACTED].]\n\n\nSCP-5023-B:\n Get some water!
