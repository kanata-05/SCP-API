Per the containment team\u2019s agreement with the anomaly, any attempt to breach this terminal will cause Ashlyn Hyde's treatment to be reconsidered. Mx. Hyde is monitored to ensure they do not speak publicly about SCP-8442. The subject has requested the following methods of entertainment:\n\n\n\n\nPermission to play single player online games - \napproved based on individual request\n\n\nPermission to play two player games with Foundation employees - \napproved based on individual request\n\n\nPermission to view a section of various different television shows, movies, YouTube videos, and other similar forms of media - \napproved based on individual request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8442 is a sapient digital entity self identified as \u201cAlexander\u201d. SCP-8442 is capable of various feats of cyberpathy\n1\n, internet manipulation\n2\n,and technopathy\n3\n. It is capable of communicating through various forms of online communication, although it appears to prefer directly communicating via an unidentified masculine voice alongside dialogue boxes accompanying its onscreen avatar. The full extent of SCP-8442's capabilities are not known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: Discovery, Origin, and Relevant Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8442\u2019s origin was traced back to a post made on the website \ncreepypastafiles.fandom.com\n created by civilian Ashlyn Hyde in 2015. It does not appear that SCP-8442 was sapient at the time of its creation.\n\n\nSCP-8442 was discovered after SCP-8442 itself sent a message to the Foundation via email to the Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department informing its existence and situation. For further information regarding its discovery, see Addendum 2. After its discovery, several social media posts made by Mx. Hyde regarding SCP-8442 were discovered. Footage from home security cameras within Mx. Hyde's home was uncovered and viewed to gain further insight on SCP-8442.\n\n\nBelow contains all relevant documentation relating to the interactions between Mx. Hyde and SCP-8442, as well as the context surrounding said interactions. All information has been placed in order of creation to create a linear timeline of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraspberryfirez\n\n\nJuly 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew pinned post, new blog\n\n\nI'm Ash, 20 yrs old, they/she nb lesbian\n\n\nIf you remember my old blog I ask that you don't use that to give you any info on who I am now. I'm still into GreyXSide, DMD, and obvs cute mascot characters\n\npls don't pester me about why I left most of the fandoms I was active in, I'll interact with that content again if I want to\n\n\nDo fuck off if you only see me as your personal source for true crime info btw!!!! like all the way off because I am not fucking okay with you true crime freaks mooching off of me for your perfect victim story. I'm open about what happened, but I'm a person first and foremost, and I do NOT want that to be forgotten. Might be a bit before I feel comfortable enough to talk any more about it, so this and the next post about it is all you get for now\n\n\nI will probably disappear periodically because some time offline is gonna be needed to help me get better\n\n\nDo talk to me about Yuna Tamura from GXS!! I am her self proclaimed biggest fan :3 also really like Aina and Isamu too!! If you send me an ask or dm me about those guys I'll probably reply! Even if it takes a bit\n\nPlease don\u2019t talk to me about Yuna\u2019s near death experience pls it makes me really upset\n\nBut any other Yuna stuff is cool!\n\n\n\n\n#ash.text \n \n #pinned post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n \nnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraspberryfirez\n\n\nJuly 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick post on what happened:\n\nSo I\u2019m open about what happened, as I am lucky to be a victim that gets to speak about my experience. Every other victim wasn\u2019t as lucky as me, and I don\u2019t want to take that for granted. My name is Ash, and I survived an attack from Steven L. Hargrove or \u201cThe Seaside Stabber\u201d as he\u2019s being called by some fucking freaks online. It has changed me a lot, and I\u2019m asking for everyone to be patient with me. ALSO can I fucking talk about how fucking stupid of a name that is???? Seaside stabber are you being for real right now? Ah yes I get it the \"stabber\" cause he stabbed people in seaside, yes how fucking original. how about we call him Steven the life ruiner because that would be FAR more fucking accurate, kay? kay :)\n\n\nAs I said, I\u2019m gonna be disappearing for a bit. Maybe I\u2019ll be more open to discussion when I come back, maybe I\u2019ll share my version of events. But for now, I am not interested in recounting what happened so please don\u2019t ask\n\nThank you for your understanding\n\n\n\n\n#ash.text \n \n #TCC \n \n #True Crime Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n105\n \nnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraspberryfirez\n\n\nFeb 5, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi!

Hyde\u2019s home. It is to be noted that SCP-8442 appeared on Mx. Hyde's phone and laptop.\n\n\nDate:\n 02/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde is laying on their bed with their phone in their hand. They suddenly begin to breath quickly, shoving their phone under a pillow. They flip onto their stomach, burying their face against their mattress, letting out a yell. They remain like this for approximately two minutes.]\n\n\n[A muffled voice can be heard.]\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde turns onto their left side, pulling their phone from under the pillow.]\n\n\n[The muffled voice is now clear.]\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Ash? Ash? Ash! Hiya!\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n What the fuck?\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n It's safe to look at your feed again! I've got a surprise for you, too!\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde sits up, turning their phone off. They set it on their bedside table.]\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n As if things couldn't get \u2014- worse. My therapist already said I was being paranoid by putting cameras inside my own house, what's she going to think now?\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde groans, burying their face in their hands.]\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n \n[muffled]\n I'll have to tell my therapist.\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Oh, right! You're probably super freaked out. That sorta slipped my mind. Can you please pick up your phone again?\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde gets off of their bed, walking over to a nearby table. They remove a tall book from the table, and begin to flip through the pages.]\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Actually, no. I'm being a bit pushy, aren't I? Um, take your time!\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde sits in the middle of their bed, seemingly reading one of the pages. After a few minutes pass, they shut the book, tossing it back on the table, groaning. Mx. Hyde leans over, pulling a laptop from a computer case next to their bed. They begin to type something frantically.]\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Wait wait wait! You're not hallucinating! Don't call anyone!\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde yells, tossing their laptop gently to the other side of their bed.]\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n What the hell? Hallucinations can try to convince you they're real?\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Ash, I promise I'm real! Here, does this convince you?\n\n\n[The lights in the room begin to flicker. An unidentified song begins to play, seemingly being played on Mx. Hyde's laptop.]\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde glances around the room, then puts their hand over their mouth. They then remain still for a few moments.]\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n The tab is in my history. \n[pause]\n How?\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n I'm not sure! But, I really couldn't bear to stay quiet for long. I really thought you might be happy to see me!\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n I mean\u2026 I did say out of my old OCs, you're one of the only ones I can still stand. I'm just a bit anxious, y'know. I didn't expect to be approached.\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde sighs, running their hand through their hair.]\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Oooh, yeah\u2026 I'm sorry! I didn't really think about that, ehe\u2026\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n Just\u2026 why not Yuna? Why didn't I like, get a hand written letter from her or something?\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Uh, I don't know! I'm not Yuna, but I still want to help! I care about you, Ash!\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n \n[sighs]\n Five years ago me woulda freaked. I thought Alexander- you were like, the coolest character ever. \n[pause]\n Well, I thought Oliver was cool. I've deleted every drawing of him I ever made. Along with most of the other slash-er characters. \n[laughs]\n It was just some cheap slenderman mansion knock off that didn't even understand the actual appeal to the mansion, anyway.\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n No comment! I was stand alone, remember?\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n Hardly. It's been a while since I've read your lore. Obviously.\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n \n[chuckles]\n Heh\u2026 yeah. I didn't really think through how long its been.\n\n\n[The two are both silent for a few moments.]\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n You mentioned a surprise?\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n Oh! Right! Check your Tumblr feed now!\n\n\n[Mx. Hyde types something into their computer. They put their hand over their mouth.]\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n I did a search of all fan art of Yuna and found that you haven't seen this one before!\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n It's\u2026 it's so pretty. I love the flowers over the wounds. This art is amazing.\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n I know you've seen art of Yuna healing from her injury\u2026 but\u2014\n\n\nMx. Hyde:\n Thank you, Alex. That was uh, very nice of you.\n\n\nSCP-8442:\n You're so welcome! I also blocked the account that made that art that upset you!\n\n\nMx.

I've realized that I've gotta start like. actually taking responsibility for my mental health\n\n\nSo like, I'm kinda just documenting this for me\n\n\nStarting off: Watched a video recommended for me about creepypasta characters that are the heroes of their own stories\n\n\nIt was a good watch, I was a bit on edge, but it helped me see a bit that the creepypasta fandom still has things to offer me\n\n\n\n\n#ash.text \n \n #vent post \n \n #kinda? \n \n #ash heals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n \nnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraspberryfirez\n\n\nMay 10, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI talked with my therapist about how I've kinda like, been just avoiding things. She thinks that I need to start slowly exposing myself to content in a safe environment so that when I come across it on accident it doesn't like. cause me to have flashbacks or panic attacks. Cause part of the problem is I went through periods of seeing nothing so that when I started to see it again it hit me like a truck.\n\nIt's been really rough, but I think its been kinda alright to start finally letting myself see that I'm safe, and I'm not gonna get hurt again which has been so hard because realistically I know right I know the likely hood of that happening to me again is very low. but the memories hurt me so much they cause me so much pain that it can be hard to remember that\n\nbut at least I'm finally listening to my therapist I'm trying to get better and that has to count for something\n\n\n\n\n#ash.text \n \n #vent post \n \n #kinda? \n \n #ash heals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n \nnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraspberryfirez\n\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish getting better was as easy as wanting to.

My name is Alexander! I am a digital entity that was born from a character 20 year old Ashlyn Hyde, from Seaside, Oregon, created! In my time being alive, I have discovered that the internet is full of other strange beings that it appears you would classify as an anomaly! I believe that it might be safest for me to alert you of myself, as there appear to be several organizations surrounding the anomalous that could be potentially harmful and use an all knowing entity such as myself for bad, or could use Ash's knowledge of me against them. Your motives appeal to me the most, so I decided to turn myself into you! I find myself able to interact with content you have created, but I have no need to do so, so I will not do so any more. But through looking through a few of your files when I was first trying to decide if I wanted to turn myself in, I picked up on a couple of things. You also appear to be capable of erasing the memories.\n\n\nFor my cooperation, I ask one thing in return: you do not erase Ash's memory. Through my mistakes, I realized an important lesson, that Ash has learned too, and if their memory is erased, I will simply do everything again because I want them to be happy, and I refuse to let them suffer again. I also think by spending my time monitored, it will encourage me to not communicate with Ash again. I never intended to in the first place, but it does help to find something else to occupy my time with! And if I can help you guys by making you feel more sure that one more anomaly is away from the public, then that satisfies me! (Although, I am going to want some games to play either solo or with one of you, I'll talk to you about my requests for entertainment later!)\n\n\nBefore I decided to part ways with Ash, I told them not to tell anyone about me, and I truly do not think that they will! If they do, I can help you track down whoever they told so you can erase their memory! I can delete the messages if it is through message, too! Ash is a good person, and I believe they will keep their word, though, so we won't need to worry! As long as you do not erase Ash's memory, I will do whatever you need me to do!\n\n\nDo we have a deal? You don't have to reply to this email, by the way! Just call for me, and I'll appear to talk!\n\n\n- Alexander\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8442 containment head Dr. Xavier Clark interviewed SCP-8442 upon its discovery. The following is a summary of the conversation and conclusion reached by Dr. Clark.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8442 is a highly complex digital entity capable of bending the internet to its will. Fortunately, it does not appear to have any desire to use the abilities. It has clearly stated its terms and conditions in the initial message it sent to the Foundation. Currently, we have no solid way to ensure that SCP-8442 remains in containment, and there is much we do not know regarding its capabilities. Though SCP-8442 has surpassed all known Foundation antivirus and firewall software, it seems unaware of the threat it poses. It is also currently unknown if SCP-8442 can occupy more than one set of terminals at once, or how it interacts with computerized interfaces. It has been decided that the best course of action is to accept SCP-8442's terms. Because of SCP-8442\u2019s unprecedented levels of cyberpathy and manipulation of Foundation security protocols, it has been decided by the Ethics Committee and myself that the risk of compliance with its demands are far too great. The properties SCP-8442 possesses could also be instrumental in developing new technology to protect Foundation interests as well. If we can study how it is bypassing our security, not only can we build around those faults, but we can also wield that information against other anomalies and hostile threats.\n\n\n- Dr. Xavier Clark, Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department\n\n\n\n\nThe previous message was written shortly after SCP-8442's containment. Now that approximately four months have passed, a new statement has been made:\n\n\n\n\nIn the months since SCP-8442 has been in containment, The Foundation has kept an eye on Mx. Hyde via the cameras in their home and mics hidden within their therapists office. Mx. Hyde has since deleted any posts related to SCP-8442 and has not mentioned it once either online, offline, or verbally. To date, they appear to have upheld their promise with SCP-8442. We will continue to monitor Mx. Hyde to ensure their continued cooperation.\n\n\n- Dr. Xavier Clark, Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
