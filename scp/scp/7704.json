Trespassers who pass the exclusion zone are to be detained and searched, followed by amnestization and release. As of 12/11/2003, The Foundation had constructed a 450-meter concrete dome with the exterior layered in iron above and around SCP-7704. This is to mitigate its effects on the ocean such as bubble emission and temperature.\n\n\nTo communicate with SCP-7704-1, interviewers will use the KEPLER-200 hydrophone\n1\n and the ZION-A400 receiver.\n2\n With this, SCP-7704-1 is to be monitored weekly so that it remains within SCP-7704.\n\n\nLastly, traversal through SCP-7704 requires the approval of Director Rodrigo Mosa. Doing so without permission will result in being administered Class-C amnestics followed by immediate excommunication from The Foundation. (See Addendum-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of SCP-7704\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n SCP-7704 is a thaumaturgic dome of fire sitting on the Alboran seabed, between 800 and 1000 meters below surface level. SCP-7704 is 223 meters tall and 385 meters wide with its exterior heat being recorded at approximately 1000\u00b0C. Currently, it does not spread, nor can it be extinguished. SCP-7704 does not seem to be utilizing any flammable fuel, anomalous or otherwise, that would keep it burning.\n\n\nThe Foundation is able to ascertain the interior dimensions throughout SCP-7704 by using an upgraded Thermal Imaging Camera. The Foundation viewed through SCP-7704 housing SCP-7704-1.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1 is a humanoid Class IV Reality Bender that is of \nthe lands of curious people,\n capable of manifesting nearly anything a person wishes for so long as they are at close proximity with it. SCP-7704-1 is capable of verbal communication in Spanish.\n3\n\n\nIt is unknown whether SCP-7704-1 was someone that had been transfigured to be \na caged stranger\n or \nan odd forest folk\n that has said person\u2019s memories.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n In 1997, local deep divers in Spain spread stories that they followed a large density of rising bubbles down to a massive bright spot in the depths of the seabed. Foundation agents administered amnestics to explorers and civilians and spread a cover story that the divers were hallucinating due to lack of oxygen.\n\n\nThe Foundation deployed an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle codenamed PERCIVAL to investigate the seabed. PERCIVAL descended to 780 meters below the surface until its hydrophone picked up the sound of breathing.\n\n\nAfter PERCIVAL's discovery of SCP-7704-1, The Foundation began constructing the containment dome for SCP-7704. On 02/19/2004, The Foundation dropped a KEPLER-200 and a ZION-A400 directly above SCP-7704 so that SCP-7704-1 could communicate with Foundation personnel. The interviews were assigned to Intel Collector and Senior Researcher L\u00eda Blanca to record accounts of SCP-7704-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1: Interviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview-1\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview-1\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7704-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher L\u00eda Blanca\n\n\nNote:\n The following is translated from Spanish to English\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nBlanca:\n Hello?

However, it was denied due to the belief that sending D-class would be a severe risk to The Veil and The Foundation. The order was to wait until there was further understanding of SCP-7704 and SCP-7704-1, and not enter due to claims alone.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview-2\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview-2\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7704-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher L\u00eda Blanca\n\n\nNote:\n The following is translated from Spanish to English\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nBlanca:\n Hello again.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Are you ready for your wish?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Not yet.

Give me a moment.\n\n\n( After a minute, Blanca plays \"ERES TU\" by Mocedades. Blanca and SCP-7704-1 listened to the song for 2 minutes and 19 seconds before resuming their conversation.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n \n(Singing)\n Eres t\u00fa. Como el fuego de mi hoguera. Eres t\u00fa. El trigo de mi pan.\n\n\n(Blanca allows the song to continue playing. The audio eases its volume until it can no longer be heard, ending the song.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n So, what do you think?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I have never heard such a song before.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Do you like it?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I do, indeed.\n\n\nBlanca:\n I\u2019m glad you think so. This is me and my daughter\u2019s favorite.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n You have children?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Mhm. Just the one, though. And you?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I did.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Boy? Girl?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Both.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Mm, I could never with two.\n\n\n(Silence)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n You're quiet now. What is it?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Sorry, just remembering this girl being such a bully to her just because she likes to sing aloud.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n What happened after?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Got a call from her school about a fight.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Did she win?\n\n\nBlanca:\n You bet.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n \n(Chuckles)\n Very good!\n\n\nBlanca:\n What about your kids, how were they?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Trouble, those little ones.\n\n\nBlanca:\n I'll say.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n There was a time when I told them not to go climbing on the dry trees. But-\n\n\nBlanca:\n They never listen, right?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Yes, thank you! I had to carry my boy, Sendino, all the way back home with a twisted ankle.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Ouch!\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Of course, he never went back to those trees again.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Aw. Poor kid.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n This other time, I was practicing with my sword, and out of nowhere, Sendino was standing behind me. I heard no footsteps or even a whisper. So when I turned, we both screamed like madmen.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Oh God, was he okay?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Thank the Lord, yes. I asked him if he needed anything, but he told me he did not. He then walked away, and I was left standing there. One must wonder why children do the most daft things.\n\n\nBlanca:\n You and me both.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Oh?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Like, when my daughter was a toddler, she would go to my drawers, take out all of my clothes, crawl in there, and sit.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n \n(Chuckles)\n What? Why would she do that?\n\n\nBlanca:\n I don\u2019t know! And even when I put her back in her crib or put up a barrier, she would still find a way over them and go back to my drawers.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n And she just sat in there?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Yes!\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Perhaps she thought she was riding a horse.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Maybe. Thank God she turned four. Otherwise, she would\u2019ve broken them.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I can imagine. Would prefer they stayed small.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Mhm. This is a pretty good start, don't you think?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I suppose it is.\n\n\nBlanca:\n I'll come back with some more music. You just wait for me, okay?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Yes, I will be waiting for you.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview-2\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Email\u00a0Exchange-1\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Email\u00a0Exchnage-1\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is translated from Spanish to English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n \ntni.pcs|asomr#tni.pcs|asomr\n\n\nTo:\n \ntni.pcs|acnalbl#tni.pcs|acnalbl\n\n\nSubject:\n Interview-2 Concern\n\n\n\n\nWas it wise to share your personal information with SCP-7704-1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n \ntni.pcs|acnalbl#tni.pcs|acnalbl\n\n\nTo:\n \ntni.pcs|asomr#tni.pcs|asomr\n\n\nSubject:\n re: Interview-2 Concern\n\n\n\n\nIt managed to get SCP-7704-1 to open up and tell us something.

So I thank you\u2026 I never got your name.\n\n\nBlanca:\n It's Blanca.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Blanca. I am truly grateful.\n\n\nBlanca:\n You're welcome.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n So what may be on your mind?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Well, maybe you would wanna tell me more about your kids. Or anyone from your family.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Hmm. There is Catall\u00edna.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Such a pretty name.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n It was my mother who named her. She told me that would have been my name, had I been a girl.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Aww. That\u2019s adorable!\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Yes, yes. Catall\u00edna had this gift for crafts and she managed to make this really beautiful bracelet. It was brown leather wrapped in twine with garnets she chipped off and with wax, she stuck the garnet pieces onto the strap. Call me arrogant, but she made fine jewelry that would fit Queen Joanna of Castile.\n4\n\n\nBlanca:\n Queen Joanna? How do you know her?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n My father served the Catholic Crown\n5\n as a knight on the mainland and was preparing me to follow suit in their service of Aragon.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Mainland?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Oh, my apologies. My home is on the west side of Mallorca.\n\n\nBlanca:\n One of the Balearic Islands?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Correct.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Oh, I\u2019ve been there a couple of times. Mostly stayed in Palma.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Palma is a good choice. More to do there.\n\n\nBlanca:\n But you and your father as knights? That\u2019s honestly amazing! You must\u2019ve had a big name in your family.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Yes\u2026 Our name. That must have explained why the steeds of Aragon approached our home and took him from us.\n\n\nBlanca:\n What for?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n They were incoming ships from the Ottomans. They said he had to fight for God, his King, and his country. For us. He promised that he would return and when he didn\u2019t, my mother and I were\u2026 lost for a time. When I grew to be a man, I served to honor his memory.\n\n\nBlanca:\n I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I would do it all again. Although, I would have done it differently.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Different how?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n To start, I would not have driven Catall\u00edna away.\n\n\n(Blanca does not respond.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n It was a boy, none I have ever met. He was\u2026 with her. I grabbed a branch from \nthe unspoken trees,\n wanting to bash it in his skull. Catall\u00edna got in the way, giving him time to flee. She insisted I stop and I struck her so hard that she was bleeding from her nose.\n\n\nBlanca:\n You were angry. You couldn't have meant it.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Regardless, I should never have done that. The day after, she was not in her room. I searched for months on end across Spain. Across \nthe forgotten place.\n Searching for anything on where she might be but I knew she was with him. I found nothing, so when I returned home, my wife and son hated me.\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 deeply inhales and exhales. There was a sudden bang from the receiver which startles Blanca.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I- \n(groans)\n why did I do that?\n\n\nBlanca:\n It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine. What about your mother? What did she think?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n She was\u2026\n\n\nBlanca:\n She was, what?\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 remains silent for several seconds.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n Hello?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Trying to remember.\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 does not speak for 42 seconds. Tapping sounds could be heard. The beats increase in volume and sound more violent.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Remember\u2026 Remember\u2026 Remember!\n\n\nBlanca:\n What's happening there?\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 shouts in pain.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n What did you do?!\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Let me see her! I beg of you!\n\n\nBlanca:\n If you could please calm-\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I know you can hear me you fucking wench!\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 continued to yell as loud as it could until it stopped. Sizzling can be heard and then sobbing.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Help me, Blanca.\n\n\nBlanca:\n How?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Perhaps find my mother's house? It is near Manacor. Or was it Felanitx? \nOr perhaps it was under the white hill?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Just please, her house is there.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Are you sure?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Yes, I am sure!\n\n\nBlanca:\n It's just that you said you served Queen Joanna, right?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n What of it?\n\n\nBlanca:\n It's- \n(clears throat)\n been centuries since her time.\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 does not respond.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n A lot has changed. We wouldn't know where to start looking or if any of her remains were left.\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 still does not respond.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n I'm sorry, maybe I should check back later.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview-3\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Email\u00a0Exchange-2\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Email\u00a0Exchnage-2\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is translated from Spanish to English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n \ntni.pcs|asomr#tni.pcs|asomr\n\n\nTo:\n \ntni.pcs|acnalbl#tni.pcs|acnalbl\n\n\nSubject:\n Precautions with SCP-7704-1\n\n\n\n\nWe were reviewing the recordings and caught something concerning with its speech.

But of course she would with all the singing she does.

So yes, I did tell them that it was to keep them safe.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Exactly.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Though, I will say this, Blanca. Before I drove my daughter out, I promised them that I would always come back. I did not want to repeat what my father had done. Duty is a responsibility but my family was my life and I would have given anything to stay by their side for as long as I could.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Were you able to keep that promise?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n No. I like to think so, and perhaps I did for a time.

You wanna give it a go?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Please.\n\n\n(Blanca plays Amor Eterno by Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal. Blanca and SCP-7704-1 listen for 6 minutes and 17 seconds until the song concludes.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n My God\u2026\n\n\nBlanca:\n So?

The Crown sent me to join three hundred or so men to defend it from invading Ottomans.\n6\n Some of my friends were there\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1 takes deep breaths.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n God, we were being slaughtered. Of course, we would. Against that many? What were they thinking?! And those fucking worms chose to surrender all of us just so they may be spared! I should have burned them with all the rest!\n\n\nBlanca:\n Burned them?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Forgive me, I- I need a moment.\n\n\n(SCP-7704-1takes 22 seconds to itself before speaking.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n They took me away to their ship. Along with the few surviving knights and civilians. We were their slaves, and we were on our way to their markets.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Oh my God.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Do you pray, L\u00eda?\n\n\nBlanca:\n I do.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n And have those prayers come true?\n\n\nBlanca:\n \u2026 One time, I remember Ana found out her boyfriend cheated on her. You could say that I wanted to kill him, like you. While my ex-husband was making sure she was okay, I asked God to bring justice down upon him for breaking my daughter\u2019s heart. The next two days, Ana\u2019s friends told her, then told me, that he sliced his fingers in a carpenting workshop. I wanted to laugh when I heard that.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n I see.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Does that make me a bad person?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Hardly. At least to me.\n\n\n(Neither of them spoke for 12 seconds.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n So how did you escape?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n She promised she would help me. She said I had to burn the bracelet Catall\u00edna made for me. She showed me \nthe forbidden home.\n \nI did everything she asked of me. I waited for him as I followed \nthe pale road\n to meet the one that would grant me a new body to have.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n \nI had a stone in hand. When I gave my name, it shattered and I saw myself lying on one of the unknown trees. I grabbed another stone and beat my own head with it until I no longer moved\n.\n Because I am Alvaro\u2026 I am Alvaro.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Who promised you?\n\n\n(No response.)\n\n\nBlanca:\n Hello?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n She was an angel. Beautiful like the summer sky. Warm to the touch\u2026 That vile, lying whore.

The suits had a built-in cooling insulation system to regulate the internal temperature of up to 35\u00b0C so that the user could operate it with little difficulty when entering SCP-7704. It will also have an external temperature display to notify the user when they approach the maximum temperature of 1000\u00b0C. KEPLER-200s and the ZION-A400s were also implemented within the suit for wireless communication.\n\n\n17 minutes later, Gamma-6 resurfaced and was immediately sent to the Emergency Cabin with G6-3 suffering from sudden Heat Exhaustion. The suits had also been damaged due to the insulation system's prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures and requiring repair or improvements. Since then, The Foundation has ceased traversal until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-2: Exerpts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the production of the AD suits, Blanca gathered a small crew to travel across Europe as well as North Africa to search for instances relating to SCP-7704-1 and confirm its claims. After 3 months, Blanca and her crew had compiled a series of excerpts in the order of their year.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Documents\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Documents\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1535,\n\n\nI was up on the sails to maintain them during a storm. My crewmates and I battled the winds and waves while some men were washed off board. Down the decks, I saw this bright blue light from where we held our stock and then it quickly vanished.\n\n\nAfter the storm, I searched the bottom decks and found that one of our slaves from Mahon had gone missing. He was a sickly looking one. I had thought that he had escaped during the storm. I thought him dead.\n\n\nSome days later, we were at sea. The night was quiet, mind the winds and crashing waves on the wood. Then the ship had caught a blaze from below and had already been engulfing our ship. Some of them fell through the decks, others got caught in the fires. I managed to take a boat and escape the burning ship. I looked to see other ships had also been set on fire.\n\n\nI heard a man laughing from the sky. His voice sounded familiar to me, but I could not recall where from then. I looked up and saw two bright stars, one green and one blue. I could not tell which one of them was laughing but I rowed my boat just in time before the ship sank. By the time I was ashore, I recognized the voice.\n\n\nI will not go back to Europe so that the mad stars would burn me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1539,\n\n\nFrom demands of the Crown, an investigation in Madrid ensued on the fifteenth of April.\n\n\nThere was a gathering of its people. Getting past the crowd, there was a man who was tall and donned a green cloak. His face could not be seen as his cloak covered the majority of his face. A local man asked if he was The Lord himself, but he replied, \u201cI am but a servant.\u201d\n\n\nNext to him was a woman with a blue cloak. Her shoulders and head were exposed but I could not make out her face as the white light above her head blinded us from gazing upon it. One could feel the warm heat coming from her as she cradled many in her arms.\n\n\nPerhaps I have seen Angels at work. Elders were turning young, the sick and injured were healed. The people's pockets were filled with gold and silver coins. The blue woman appeared behind me and asked if there was anything I desired.\n\n\nI wished to be reunited with my late wife. I never, never, would have imagined that she would return to me seconds later. It was her. It was truly her.\n\n\nTo the Catholic Crown, God is with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1540,\n\n\nBless our Lord, for he has given us life again. Horrible things were happening all across France. Storms blew and washed away homes, the earth ruptured and broke, fires to farms and forests, and disease swept us all. The Lord heeded our prayers and bestowed two angels to rid the works of The Devil.\n\n\nOur devotion, loyalty, and undying love could not measure the debt we had for our Saviors. One was a beauty that had brought the sun to us while she cradled us in her cloak. The other one was more hidden but he too shared his love for us by answering our prayers.\n\n\nRejoice for France has been blessed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1542,\n\n\nThese are the end times, as they were written. I saw them battling at the foot of the Watzmann mountain. One of God\u2019s Angels and The Dragon took their war down to us. He had lifted the earth and crushed it on top of her. Conjuring ice, stone, and steel to puncture her, yet she still stood.\n\n\nHe had done everything in his power to kill her, but this Angel was as beautiful as she was powerful.\n\n\nI cannot, for the life of me, describe what he did near the end. But it was power unlike anything nature could ever bestow. I felt the force soon after and it blew away the storms. When I got out of the ditch, I noticed that he was fatigued. Which gave The Angel the chance to fire an arrow of light through him.\n\n\nOver time, The Devil was becoming smaller until it was the size of a man. He was screaming curses at her. She was torn into a bloodied mess, and yet she covered him with her cloak. She must have whispered something in his ear before summoning the sun and caging the evil within.\n\n\nShe flew South, perhaps going to return the beast from once it came. I pray for her that God will heal her wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Father,\n\n\nIt has been years since I last saw you. When you struck me, I was scared. I thought that had I stayed, I would be punished further for lying to you. Perhaps I would have. I also supposed that I thought he loved me, as I had loved him. The first signs of me conceiving a child, he was gone. I then had my son, whom I named after you, and we had been on our own for Lord knows how long. I did what I must to care for us and there was a point when I thought myself better dead.\n\n\nWe somehow made our way to a French village. It was nice for a time until a raging storm had us in its midst. Then the earth beneath us crumbled and I fell in. I was cold, trapped in my unmoving body. Then I felt warm again and saw you in front of me. It was your voice, low yet soothing. You were different. Green skin, four black eyes. But it was you and I never bawled like I did since I was a girl.\n\n\nI wanted nothing but to have you as my father again, and then I gazed upon the woman who was with you. She was so pretty, yet I could feel her eyes piercing through my soul. I recall her voice, as soft, if not softer than yours when she said, \u201cYou belong to me.\u201d Who was she father?\n\n\nThen you both vanished, and I never got to say farewell. I do not know what she did to you, but if you are watching over me, know that I forgive you. And that I love you, always.\n\n\nForever yours,\n\n\n-Catall\u00edna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Documents\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview-6\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview-6\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7704-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher L\u00eda Blanca\n\n\nNote:\n The following is translated from Spanish to English\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nBlanca:\n Hello.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Welcome back, L\u00eda.\n\n\n(Blanca does not respond.)\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n L\u00eda?\n\n\nBlanca:\n Sorry, yes?\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Welcome back.\n\n\nBlanca:\n Oh\u2026 Thank you.\n\n\nSCP-7704-1:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nBlanca:\n I am.

Could explain why you bothered finding the excerpt from Germany and the letter.\n\n\nBlanca:\n What\u2019s your point?\n\n\nMosa:\n Took me a while to think it over. It's not that you're attached to it. No, you want something from it, don\u2019t you?\n\n\nBlanca remains silent for a time\n\n\nBlanca:\n You know why.

Once the systems were running again, security personnel reported a missing uniform and weapon from the locker rooms. The site had to be on lockdown to locate the infiltrator. Eventually, security found that the storage unit that held the AD suits was opened with one of the suits also missing. Task Forces immediately were sent to the location of SCP-7704 to capture the infiltrator. By the time they got there, they found the missing uniform and the weapon which had not been fired.
