Until such a method of containment is discovered, specialized Foundation Task Force N-77 (\u201cWhack a Mole\u201d) are to focus their efforts on documenting, researching, and investigating information related to SCP-7853 and the Segreto crime family.\n\n\nN-77 agents and informants embedded in the American Mafia are to undergo biotechnical augmentation for the purposes of active information monitoring. This process includes the implementation of discreet listening and recording devices, primarily in the ocular region. All agents are to refrain from engaging in active sabotage of criminal activities or other actions that may draw attention to themselves until a holistic understanding of SCP-7853 is achieved.\n\n\nInformation related to SCP-7853 is classified to members of Task Force N-77. If this document is accessible to the Foundation at large [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7853 is an anomalous method of execution employed by GoI-027, the Segreto crime family, to assassinate individuals that threaten their activities.\n\n\nPhysical evidence of SCP-7853 has yet to be discovered, but known victims have corroborated a universal description of a component of the anomaly: a hulking, humanoid figure clothed in a trenchcoat, wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Its facial features are heavily obscured by shadow, save for the presence of red, luminescent eyes. This entity is invisible to all but the individual targeted by SCP-7853.\n\n\nVictims describe this entity as perpetually moving towards them at a steady pace. They are fully conscious of the figure\u2019s location in relation to theirs at all times. Attempts to impede or slow the entity\u2019s advance are futile, as victims describe the figure phasing through any obstacles placed in its way. Attempts to physically damage SCP-7853 invariably fail, potentially due to its incorporeality. SCP-7853 is reportedly capable of maintaining its own center of gravity, demonstrating this ability by walking on surfaces such as walls or ceilings if its path is obstructed.\n\n\nCompletion of SCP-7853 results in the targeted individual suddenly disappearing, leaving no physical trace of their body, presumably killing them. It is assumed that this occurs when the SCP-7853 entity reaches the victim, but due to the nature of the anomaly, little verifiable evidence exists to confirm this.\n\n\nHow SCP-7853 functions, whether it\u2019s controlled remotely or is a sentient anomaly itself, and how targets are chosen remains unknown. All information regarding SCP-7853 has been obtained through Task Force N-77 agents embedded in organized criminal systems related to the Segreto crime family. All incidents suspected or confirmed to involve SCP-7853 also involved victims who were in conflict with the Segreto crime family.\n\n\nIt is possible that interfacing with information regarding SCP-7853 increases an individual\u2019s likelihood to be targeted by the anomaly. N-77 agents aware of SCP-7853 and involved in the creation of this document have reported seeing a figure consistent with descriptions of the entity, though none have experienced being pursued or followed by it.\n\n\nAs of March, 2004, no Foundation deaths are suspected to have occurred as a result of SCP-7853.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, that\u2019s helpful\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis is what\u2019s following you??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseriously joey what did you do\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut my nose where it shouldn\u2019t have been a hell of a lot less carefully than I could have been\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-22 has a big fucking problem, and I don\u2019t know how deep it goes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re selling X-908 to the Segreto family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site\u2019s the hotbed. Mass synthesis of X-908, trucks pulling up at night, Dr. Cooke\u2019s private poker games. You go down one hole, you find two more. Made the mistake of talking to Cooke directly. I didn\u2019t expect the fucking Mob to be involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhold on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat\u2019s X-908?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic serum. Made from the same stuff we use to make amnestics, but way more unstable. Gives you antimemetic properties for about an hour. Foundation uses it for undercover operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one\u2019s able to remember you, your face, or any memories they might have had of you. Seriously powerful stuff. Like you never even existed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand we\u2019re selling this to the mob?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted putting the pieces together when examining Site workflow and how much of our allotted monthly resources were going into X-908 production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it. Mob\u2019s been in the public eye for the past few decades. Movies, TV shows, the RICO act. X-908 allows organized crime to remain organized in an age where your shits are data-harvested. Everything they do is a hell of a lot easier to get away with when no one knows you were even there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhy would the foundation need the money tho?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould be a personal operation. If this is something larger then we have to ask ourselves where all that fancy funding comes from\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoes director ruggiero know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t know. Dr. Cooke\u2019s spearheading the thing, that\u2019s certain. Some of the lab team too. Hartman, Volinski. But lots of faces I\u2019ve never seen before. People I can\u2019t find on the payroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need you to get this information to Ruggiero. I was going to myself but then this fucking thing started following me\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat if ruggiero\u2019s involved? won\u2019t i be targeted for helping you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting in a cab. Not going to stop it, but I need to think\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthere\u2019s an addendum. i\u2019ll send it over now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7853 was discovered during Task Force N-77\u2019s investigation into GoI-027. An excerpt from the group\u2019s Foundation intelligence dossier has been included below.\n\n\n\n\nGoI-027, also known as the Segreto crime family, is an organized crime group primarily operating in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. Unofficially referred to as the \u201cSixth Family\u201d due to their powerful standing within the American Mafia, the organization has ties to an estimated 30% of known criminal activity in their locus of influence. This includes standard Mob operations, such as gambling, racketeering, trafficking, and theft, among others.\n\n\nGoI-027 is notable for its knowledge and usage of the anomalous. The use of paratechnology, targeting known Groups of Interest, smuggling anomalous objects, distributing anomalous drugs, and carrying out operations in populated Nexuses are further documented events that have warranted the organization\u2019s GoI status.\n\n\nIt is believed a portion of GoI-027\u2019s members are anomalous themselves. The Segretos have managed to gain access to information confidential to organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation, leading intelligence to believe that the Segretos have exploited information security flaws in both groups. The existence of Segreto informants within the Foundation is presently being investigated.\n\n\nAt the head of GoI-027 is an individual referred to as \u201cThe Duke\u201d. The family\u2019s structure and the identities of its members are largely unknown, though its overall origin can most likely be traced back to the folding of GoI-001, The Chicago Spirit, in the late 1940s. The majority of its history is lost, as American Mob culture has largely upheld the tradition of not openly speaking about GoI-027. Certain details regarding the family contradict themselves between sources, and Foundation informants have expressed fear over revealing information about GoI-027, potentially due to attracting the attention of SCP-7853.\n\n\nA number of Task Force N-77 members have succeeded in embedding themselves in GoI-027 or criminal organizations close to. Further intelligence reports are awaiting declassification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-77. You ever hear of these guys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndon\u2019t think so. they probably went deeper if they found out there\u2019s mob activity within the foundation itself. off the books yk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s optimistic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that thing\u2019s speeding up. I can\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s about five blocks back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it can move faster I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s just sadistic. Likes the chase. Probably knows I\u2019m running now\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\u2019m putting all of this in a data packet. the file, the convo, everything. if you come over and log into my terminal, you can send it to the director\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood idea. Absolves you of any excuse, barring the fact that I used your computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow close are you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive minutes on foot. Get a drink ready\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a sample of known incidents involving SCP-7853.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 1991/11/01\n\n\nVictim:\n Rocco \u201cRocky\u201d Lombardi\n\n\nDescription:\n High profile Mob disappearance. Lombardi had reportedly had sexual relations with the wife of a Segreto \nCaporegieme\n. Lombardi made several telephone calls to his peers panicking that he was being followed by an individual matching SCP-7853\u2019s description. Soldiers stood guard at his compound, but could not see the assailant, even when Lombardi pointed directly to the entity. Lombardi drove off in his car in an attempt to escape, and was officially declared missing a week later. Presumed dead as a result of SCP-7853.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 1995/04/27\n\n\nVictim:\n Nicostrato Mazzanti\n\n\nDescription:\n Mazzanti owned a prominent casino chain on the east coast, and became targeted by the Segretos after a dispute over earnings resulted in the deaths of several GoI-027 associates. Mazzanti reported flying from the United States to Italy in an attempt to flee SCP-7853. SCP-7853\u2019s pursuit occured for over a week, and allegedly involved a crazed Mazzanti acquiescing to Segreto demands before being caught and presumably killed by the entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 1998/09/04\n\n\nVictim:\n Enzo \u201cZombie\u201d Rosiello\n\n\nDescription:\n Details of prior conflict with GoI-027 are unknown. Rosiello was noted to be a highly aggressive individual, and his continued operation was considered a massive risk for the Mob due to his frequent outbursts and sporadic killings. Rosiello believed he was being followed, and attempted to attack the assailant in broad daylight. According to bystanders, Rosiello fired several shots into the air that quickly disappeared. After a struggle, Rosiello disappeared after being dragged into a back alley by an unknown force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou read these yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast one\u2019s interesting. If those bullets really disappeared, the entity must have taken them, right? If it\u2019s not phasing through an object, it can be interacted with physically\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe there wasn\u2019t enough time for it to react\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE do not try to fuck with this thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile\u2019s ready get here asap please\n\n\n\n\n\n\njoey\n\n\n\n\n\n\njoey are you there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Evan Giochno, Captain of Task Force N-77. A task force that no longer exists.\n\n\nIt\u2019s March 13th, 2004. I\u2019ve been on the run for two days. I\u2019ve been investigating the Segreto family for the past decade of my life. And according to my memory, I\u2019ve been doing it alone. But that memory\u2019s wrong. There are names I can\u2019t remember. People whose faces don\u2019t register in my mind. Work I didn\u2019t write that\u2019s sitting in front of my face. It\u2019s a family photo with everyone cut out. Except for me.\n\n\nThe last documents I know I didn\u2019t write were uploaded two weeks ago. In those two weeks, Task Force N-77, a group of 77 Foundation personnel investigating the Segreto crime family, has been whittled down to one. And I can\u2019t tell you a single thing about any of those people I risked my life with. It\u2019s picking us off, and it\u2019s making it seem like we never existed. And my mind believes it. But then I look at the mounds of work sitting in my office that I don\u2019t remember writing, or the equipment that I could never operate, and I know it\u2019s a lie.\n\n\nIt won\u2019t stop until I\u2019m dead. Until the only thing left of this team is a spare room that no one\u2019s entered in years, and a file that no one has the clearance to access.\n\n\nI\u2019m holed up on-site right now. Guards armed to the teeth. They know what\u2019s happening, but it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still coming for me. And once I\u2019m gone, they\u2019ll all forget. No one\u2019s going to remember what they were assigned to protect, or that any of us existed. Not like I remember them either.\n\n\nI declassified the file. Level 4 clearances. If this gets lost in the shuffle, start asking questions. We were all real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njoey please you need to read this\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nholy fuck are you okay??\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019M finE just hurt\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni shot it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou fired off a shot in the middle of nyc? are you fucking stupid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaited until it was clsoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaced around your building\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshot it in the knees and the bullet hit but people still heard obv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nguy tackled me fucked up my leg. got away b biting him\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndid you kill that thing??\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno it just took the fucking shot like a tank\n\n\n\n\n\n\njoey please read what i just sent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthere\u2019s an addendum that was reverted right after it was edited in. from the captain of the task force. last thing added to the page\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\u2019m fucking hurt ill be there in a minute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplease. it makes no sense, pls read it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat the Fuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\noh god of course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit\u2019s the fucking compnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe isomer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES. the problem before was that this thing still left evidence behind, just like any other hitman. no body, no proof, but people still remembered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwht if u could make the memories disappear too? X-908 can. mob uses it on themselves to stay underground, but if you use it on other people\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut it only lasts for an hour you said?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyeah, and then ur pulled back into reality. everyone else\u2019s brains recheck themselves and the memories come back. if you kill something that\u2019s imperceptible, it\u2019s not going to return. that effect\u2019s going to linger. there\u2019s NOTHing to be brought back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit\u2019s the closest you can get to being erased entirely\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngod that\u2019s fucking good\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfucking hell joey. are you here yet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the lobby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n227, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsarah\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsara\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimj shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntranq or somethign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nim in lobby im dontt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat the fuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespond to me\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot a bullet what the fuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, who is this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dread settles in as Dr. Joseph Wren realizes what he\u2019s been shot with.\n\n\nThe faces in the lobby do not acknowledge him. If they do, they just as quickly forget and move along. SCP-7853 moves closer. Halfway across the lobby now. Still that same, steady walk. Wren knows it\u2019s futile, but he limps to the elevator as fast as he can.\n\n\nHe pushes the button to the third story rapidly. 227. Just need to get to that terminal.\n\n\nIn the corner of his mind\u2019s eye, he knows that SCP-7853 is closing in. It\u2019s walking up the walls. Wren fondles his hip. Pistol\u2019s still there. He contemplates swallowing it. No. Need to get to Sarah\u2019s room. If he does, he can still send the file regardless of whether or not she\u2019ll remember him. Get it to the Director. Get it to everyone on Site-22\u2019s payroll. Pull the rug out on those bastards. He\u2019s not afraid of dying anymore. He\u2019s afraid of failing.\n\n\nThe door opens. Wren runs as fast as he can down the hall. Just a few more seconds. He\u2019s focused. So focused that he\u2019s completely neglected to notice that SCP-7853 has phased through the wall behind him. Wren turns the handle, but it\u2019s too late. He didn\u2019t even get to scream.\n\n\nThe game is over. Dr. Joseph Wren, and every memory of him that\u2019s ever existed in the minds of his friends and family, has been wiped from existence.\n\n\nThe door to Junior Researcher Sarah Capula\u2019s apartment creaks open. She shut down her computer a few minutes ago, confused as to why she was cataloging data on SCP-7853. A grin spreads across her face when she notices something in her peripheral.\n\n\nSarah:\n Come on in, tough guy. I\u2019ve always wanted to see what you look like.\n\n\nSCP-7853 enters the apartment, phasing through the door. The two stare each other down.\n\n\nSarah:\n Terrifying. I figured you might have had something to do with this when I saw the past hour of text messages I couldn\u2019t remember sending. Colleague of mine?\n\n\nSCP-7853 does not respond.\n\n\nSarah:\n (\nShakes head\n) I\u2019m never getting used to this. I didn\u2019t realize we were doing this with X-908, now. Very impressive. Horrible way to go out, you know? (\nPauses\n) You probably didn\u2019t even need me to lure him here, but Cooke doesn\u2019t tell me shit.\n\n\nSilence. Sarah pulls out her cell phone to call Director Ruggerio. After some ringing, the director picks up.\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n Speak.\n\n\nSarah:\n Director, do you know a Dr. Joseph Wren?\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n Uh, I don\u2019t think we have a\u2013 Oh\u2026 (\nLaughs\n)\n\n\nSarah:\n Didn\u2019t know they were doing hits with this stuff. Scary, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n Always is. These bastards step into some deep shit. Just wish I could remember who they were after the fact. Wonder how deep he got.\n\n\nSarah:\n I want my cut.\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n Relax. Is our friend there?\n\n\nSarah:\n Dick Tracy? Yeah, I\u2019m looking at him.\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n Great. Well, give him my regards. The Duke\u2019s getting double on his next shipment. Bailing us out yet again with his royal enforcer.\n\n\nSarah:\n Does he speak? Fucker hasn\u2019t said a word since he walked in.\n\n\nDirector Ruggerio:\n The fuck would I know? I\u2019ve never seen the guy. You don\u2019t see him unless you\u2019re\u2013\n\n\nSCP-7853 fires a shot of X-908 at Sarah Capula. The impact of the bullet stuns her. She tries to mouth something, but words don\u2019t come out. She drops the phone to the ground, and falls out of her seat, struggling to crawl away.\n\n\nSCP-7853 approaches her, and in seconds, she\u2019s gone. Maybe she was a liability. Maybe she wasn\u2019t. The fact remained that she read that document to Wren. She could have lied. She was told to lie. But it\u2019s been taken care of now. This operation can\u2019t afford to leave loose ends.\n\n\nElsewhere, a confused Director Julian Ruggerio hangs up his cell phone, realizing that he was talking to nothing at all.\n\n\nSCP-7853 exits through the window, and makes a descent down the side of the apartment, returning to parts unknown.\n\n\nThe Duke keeps his court well-kept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7852\n | SCP-7853 | \nSCP-7854\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7853\n\" by J Dune, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
