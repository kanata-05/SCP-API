Request to gain access to the item is to be submitted to Dr. Green.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-5731 is a square music box which is 6\u00a0cm in length, 5\u00a0cm in width, and 3\u00a0cm in height. Its top is made from clear plastic, allowing the interior to be viewed. When its anomaly is not in effect, it plays a rendition of \u201cZip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\u201d when cranked. When in the vicinity of a non-sapient biological entity, its anomalous effect is triggered. If cranked nearby one of these entities, SCP-5731 will instead play English human speech. This is believed to be the broadcasting or \u201ctranslation\u201d of the non-sapient entity\u2019s thoughts. The voice from the music box is always that of a young female, despite the sex of the effected entity. Tests discovered wildly varying personalities in the music box between test subjects used. It is not believed the female voice is its own consciousness, rather a projection of the ones surrounding it.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n\nSCP-5731 was purchased by Researcher Pret\u2019s wife from a yard sale at some point during the summer of 2013. Researcher Pret was not aware of SCP-5731\u2019s effects until 8/17/2018 when his daughter wound it in proximity to the family cat, which triggered SCP-5731\u2019s effects. Researcher Pret surrendered the object to the Foundation for testing.\n\n\n\n\nTesting:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Tests\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\nTesting is currently overseen by Dr. Green.

The request was denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#101\n\n\nSCP-096\n\n\nDuring SCP-096's calm state, SCP-5731 repeated the phrases \"so sad\" and \"ugly, ugly\". Permission denied to deliberately trigger SCP-096 for testing purposes. \nAddendum 07/ 23/2020 :\n During an unrelated termination attempt, 096 was triggered and its thoughts transcribed through SCP-5731. It recited complicated equations of aerodynamics and physics. These are thought to be SCP-096 'calculating' how best to reach its target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#106\n\n\nSCP-2845\n\n\nThe music box played \"Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah\", suggesting that SCP-2845 is sapient and has not been able or willing to speak to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Log\u00a0for\u00a0Test\u00a0#53\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0granted\n\n\n\n\nTest Log\n\n\n\n\nTesting run by Dr. Green on 12/02/2018\n\n\nSubject:\n \u201cPeaches\u201d A female orangutan who displayed a high comprehension of human language.\n\n\n<Begin log>\n\n\n0:00\n \nDr. Green cranks SCP-5731\n\n\n0:01 - SCP-5731:\n Hm?

I have a couple of questions for you.\n\n\nJudy T\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n About the music box, I bet.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Yes, of course. How did it come into your possession?\n\n\nJudy:\n If I answer the questions you\u2019ll give it back to me, right?\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Certainly.\n\n\nJudy:\n Alright, I got it as a gift when I was little. From my aunt.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Do you know where she got it?\n\n\nJudy:\n No.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: What\u2019s her name?\n\n\nJudy:\n What, are you gonna go after her family too? I already know you\u2019re mad enough at me for knowing about\u2026 all this\u2026 the weird stuff out there.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Tell us her name, please.\n\n\nJudy:\n Ugh, it\u2019s \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. But don\u2019t bother. She\u2019s been dead for 6 years now.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Thank you. How did you find out about \u201call this\u201d?\n\n\nJudy:\n Well, it started with the music box. One thing kinda led to another and\u2026 I guess I just never stopped believing in magic as a kid, you know?\n\n\nInterviewer:\n And about the Foundation?\n\n\nJudy:\n Came across it in my search for the music box.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Could you elaborate?\n\n\nJudy:\n How do I elaborate? I don\u2019t remember exactly when I found out about it. At that point I\u2019d already known about the supernatural stuff for years, so a place that collects that stuff ain\u2019t so hard to imagine. And I figured a place that collects magic stuff might have \u2018collected\u2019 something that was mine.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Hm, what was your aunt like, then? Do you know if she was aware of the anomalous?\n\n\nJudy:\n She definitely knew what the music box could do. That\u2019s why she gave it to me. My best friend even back then was Sparky, and I really wanted nothing more than to talk to him. I don\u2019t know what else she knew about anomalies. What, do you think she was a witch?\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Ha, well that\u2019s not entirely out of the realm of possibility. How exactly did you lose the music box?\n\n\nJudy:\n I didn\u2019t lose it. It got sold at a yard sale. I like to think that it accidentally got swept up with the other things that were getting sold, but my mom may have just gotten rid of it on purpose.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Your mother was aware of it, then?\n\n\nJudy:\n Yeah. She didn\u2019t like the music box \nor\n my aunt. She wasn\u2019t real fond of magic, and she always said that I needed to make actual friends, cause a dog wasn\u2019t good enough or something. [ \nJudy laughs\n ]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n I see. Do you have any more information?\n\n\nJudy:\n Nah. Can I have the music box back now?\n\n\nInterviewer:\n I\u2019ll see what I can do.\n\n\nJudy:\n Hey now, you just said \u2018certainly\u2019 at the beginning of our chat, and now it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll see what I can do\u2019?\n\n\nInterviewer:\n I will try my be-\n\n\nJudy:\n No! \nNo,\n that\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\nJudy stands up from her seat.\n\n\nJudy:\n \nSwear\n to me you\u2019ll get it back.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n I d-\n\n\nJudy:\n Do it! Please\u2026 [ \nJudy's voice falters\n ]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Please remain calm, Judy.\n\n\nJudy:\n That thing is mine, and I\u2019m running out of time. Swear you\u2019ll give it back.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Fine then, I swear! Please Judy, sit back down.\n\n\nJudy sits and breathes deeply.\n\n\nJudy:\n Stand by your word, or I\u2019ll be back on your doorstep tomorrow- I swear to \nthat.\n\n\n<End Interview Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing statement\n: Judy T\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 provided no further useful information.
