Injuries sustained included: shattered pelvis, shattered femur & tibia, ruptured left femoral artery, perforated large intestine, left kidney, stomach, and bladder (resultant of pelvic bone fragments), fractured skull, fractured left arm, collapsed left lung, and partially severed left foot.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8332-A's death was instantaneous and incongruous with its immediate causal context, prompting tentative designation as an anomalous event until further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 12-01-2024, 22:37:16 JST, Declan Yuu Ramirez, aged 34, was struck and killed by a drunk driver outside of his apartment in Osaka, Japan, sustaining injuries including fractured left arm, collapsed left lung, shattered femur & tibia, ruptured left femoral artery, perforated stomach, large intestine, bladder, and left kidney, shattered pelvis, fractured skull, and partially severed left foot. Ramirez was then designated SCP-8332-B.\n\n\nFollowing this, a semicomprehensive study crossexamining the medical, professional, and documented personal events & occurrences shared by SCP-8332-A and SCP-8332-B was conducted.
