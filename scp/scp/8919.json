What brings you to my humble fishbowl? What is your heart's desire? Fame? Fortune? Women?\u2026 Men?\n\n\nDr. Rigel:\n Let's cut to the chase. I've read the experiment logs regarding your anomalous properties. Can you actually grant wishes?\n\n\nSCP-8919:\n Of course! One hundred percent legit. No gimmicks, no catches. Go on, ask for something small.\n\n\nDr. Rigel:\n Hmmm\u2026 alright. How about a pizza?\n\n\n[SCP-8919 bobs in the water, then a slice of pepperoni pizza manifests on the table.]\n\n\nDr. Rigel:\n Not bad. But what about something bigger?

[SCP-8919 winks]\n\n\nDr. Rigel:\n No, my wish is something much greater. [Glances around nervously] I doubt I have much time before someone checks in on me, so let\u2019s do this. I wish to be the sole ruler of the entire SCP Foundation. The Council can handle the administrative work, but I want to be above them. Absolute authority. Just me.\n\n\n[Suddenly, the door bursts open.
