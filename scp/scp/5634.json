SCP-5634 existed for a period of 37 years (1893-1930) under the name \u201cThe Agrarian Union of Neche\u201d, in which time it was able to create its own currency, military, and government. Residents of SCP-5634 henceforth referred to as SCP-5634-2, gradually became anomalous in nature during the period in which SCP-5634 existed, assumedly due to breeding with the anomalous (assumed to be) native inhabitants of SCP-5634. Anomalous effects vary widely but consist mainly of physical mutations, which include an unexplainable level of strength, speed, and polymelia (primarily in the legs and arms). Many of these effects harm those effected in some way, causing average anomalous inhabitants of SCP-5634 to live for an average of roughly 40 years (according to documents written by SCP-5634\u2019s physician Douglas Olson, see \nAddendum-5634-I\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following documents were recovered from SCP-5634. The majority of the documents relating to the government of SCP-5634 were partially burned or entirely burned by a fire orchestrated by United States led troops:\n\n\n\n\nA-5634-A (\"Declaration of Independence\")\n\n\nThe following document was recovered from the National Farmers Museum in Neche, and is SCP-5634's \"Declaration of Independence\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclaration of Independence\n\n\nof the Great Agrarian Union\n\n\n\n\nWe the people and workers of Neche, Saint Josephs, and Felson collectively declare independence from the false and backward \"Union\" of States whom continue to swipe the rights of the agrarian and of the people, due to the crimes mentioned in this document, which this council hereby claim to be an irredeemable and unforgivable offense even to the lord above.\n\n\nList of Unforgiveables\n\n\n\n\nThe taxation of the worker to a degree most unfavorable and illegal.\n\n\nThe attacks by Union forces due to our acts of retaliation which we do deem to be right with God and with the rights previously bestowed to us by your false articles and douments.\n\n\nThe deaths of over twenty just south of Neche.\n\n\nThe imperialistic actions of the Union in the Dakota area, primarily the conflict with the Sioux.\n\n\nThe imperialistic actions of the Union outside of the Dakota area, namely Korea, Mexico, and other areas where fellow agrarians were slain.\n\n\nThe clear prosecution of those with traits unique to that of the average man, some of who had been members of this very council.\n\n\nThe \u201cconfiscation\u201d of hunting rifles, pistols, and other tools explicitly kept for self defense (which were keenly permitted by your articles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(List continues for 2 more pages, for details see Document 5634/Miscellaneous/LoU.)\n\n\nWith this document we declare ourselves independent, and in a state of war with the false States of the Union.\n\n\nSigned by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoel Wagner\n\nKerry Fuller\n\nTroy Kraus\n\nWilliam Allemand\n\nVincent Hagen\n\nKnut Olson\n\nRobert Gibson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdmund Lewis\n\nDamien Milton\n\nGerald Gibson\n\nLukas Vlach\n\nOscar Cassirer\n\nJames Schult\n\nSamuel Arvesen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-5634-B (\u201cConstitution\u201d)\n\nThe following document was recovered from the capital building of SCP-5634 after neutralization (12/13/1931) and appears to be a constitution.
