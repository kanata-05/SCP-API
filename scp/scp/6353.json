However, individuals may be captured by impediment of the forelegs or killed with conventional weapons.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6353 appear identical to the Eurasian Badger\n1\n and exhibit intelligence comparable to humans.\n\n\nSCP-6353 are able to \"burrow\" through the fabric of spacetime, travelling interstellar distances within a matter of seconds. This is carried out by a physical digging motion which creates a portal to an extradimensional space which is used as a tunnel.\n\n\nSCP-6353 can \u201csmell\u201d across interstellar distances, pinpointing the source with great accuracy and without lightspeed delay.\n\n\nMultiple cubs were cloned from DNA samples obtained from SCP-6353-1, however none have exhibited any anomalous abilities as of yet.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-6353-1 was found near the village of Bonnybridge in the UK. Foundation personnel were dispatched after unusual reports to local authorities. A burrow had been discovered with five people chained inside, the captives claimed to have been kidnapped by a talking badger. Agent McCallion was assigned to investigate and carried out interviews with the captives.\n\n\n\n\nInitial\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\nInitial\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWitness interview: Professor John Tanaka\n\n\nDate:\n 12/07/2010\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Professor John Tanaka\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent McCallion\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Hello sir, I understand you've been through an awful lot so I'll try to keep this brief. First off, we've contacted your family, they know you\u2019re safe and we\u2019ve arranged for you to fly back to the US in the morning.\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n Can I call them? Can I speak to my wife?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Of course Professor, we just need to get this down first, then I'll get you a phone. Alright?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n I'm not going to say anything\u2026 indiscreet. I just want to talk to her, just hear her voice. I understand the need for secrecy, I do. You don't need to worry about me, I swear. I just want to talk to my family.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I understand sir, and I do appreciate your discretion. I promise, I'll let you use my own phone just as soon as we're done here. OK?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n \n*sigh*\n OK.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n OK. So I want to make sure I've got this right, you work at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n And that's the last place you remember being before\u2026\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n Yes, I was just leaving when, It came for me.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I understand this is difficult, but can you describe how it happened?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n I heard the voice: low and harsh. It called my name. I couldn't see anybody, so I answered back. Stupidest thing I've ever done. Suddenly I was falling. I was standing on solid ground but it just gave way. I landed hard in the dirt, somewhere cold and dark. It locked that cuff on my leg. The others were there: Fritz, Madelaine, Ishiro, Frank. It said I was to help them, that we would go free once the work was done.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n And what was the work?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n It wanted us to find a planet. Its home. We didn't have much to go on. And we could only work at night, when It was there to watch us. When It left in the morning It disconnected the internet. At least that gave us time to sleep, to talk.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n How far along were you?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n We were basically just guessing, pulling up stars and seeing if they might match the star maps It had drawn up, which weren't great. Could be the very next one we tried would've been it, or we could have been down there forever.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Did It tell you why It came here?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n Claimed to be lost. A lone traveller lost among the stars, just trying to get home. But never believed that. Sometimes\u2026\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Sometimes\u2026?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n Sometimes I got the feeling there was something else going on. It would say \"we\" instead of \"I\". Like, \"We should never have come here\", I distinctly remember that.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Could It have been referring to you and the other astronomers?\n\n\nProfessor John Tanaka:\n No. There are more of them. They could be anywhere, everywhere.\n\n\n<END LOG>:\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n All five astronomers were kept in isolation for 30 days in order to ensure all pertinent details were obtained and they had not been contaminated. They were then given amnestics and released using a cover story blaming religious extremists.\n\n\nA trap was arranged in the burrow. At dusk SCP-6353-1 was shot with tranquiliser darts and transported to site 91 for examination and questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview with SCP-6353-1\n\n\nDate:\n 18/07/2010\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6353-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent McCallion\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>:\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Hello, my name is Agent McCallion. I need to ask you some questions.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*growl*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n This will go a lot easier if you co-operate with us. We know you can talk, according to the astronomers you are fluent in at least English, Japanese and German.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*whine*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Y\u2019know, this act isn\u2019t in your best interest. If we were to determine you were just a normal badger, we wouldn\u2019t release you. You\u2019d be put down.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n You can\u2019t do that. It would contravene The Protection Of Badger Act 1992. I am afforded legal protection. You are already guilty of several offences under the law:\n\nTaking me here against my will violates Section One subsection One: \"A person is guilty of an offence if he wilfully kills, injures or takes a badger.\"\n\n\nHolding me in these restrains violates Section Two, subsection 1A: \"A person is guilty of an offence if he cruelly ill-treats a badger\"\n\n\nAnd finally, \n*snort*\n your interference in my sett violates Section Three, subsection 1E: \"disturbing a badger when it is occupying a badgersett\"\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n That\u2019s better.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Not for you. \n*snort*\n You are in breach of the law, Agent McCallion, therefore I suggest you release me immediately.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I noticed that you decided to leave out the many exceptions in Sections Six through Ten. But that\u2019s academic, the people I work for are not bound by such laws.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n And who exactly, \n*snort*\n are you working for Agent McCallion?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n An organisation which specialises in threats like you.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I am not a threat. You do not need to treat me this way.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n You were a threat to the astronomers you kidnapped. The five of them were locked up in the dark all day, forced to work as your slaves all night, and yet you\u2019re bold enough to complain about your treatment?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I needed them, what are five compared with the billions you have on this planet? \n*snort*\n I kept them well fed, didn\u2019t I? And they were to be released as soon as the work was done.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Ah yes, the work. Perhaps you could explain that to me?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*whine*\n I am trying to find my way home. I am of the Broc, we are spread far throughout the stars, with colonies on hundreds of worlds.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Is that why you came here, to colonise Earth?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n No Agent MacCallion. We have no need of this world. While we could live here, it is far from ideal, Class D. We generally only colonise Class B or higher.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Why are you here then?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I am a historian, an archaeologist. The greatest of my generation, \n*squeak*\n I have come here to research the origins of our race. I was working my way back though the oldest known colonies when I smelled Broc here. It was faint, unusual, but as I came closer the scent became unmistakable.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n You smelled your kind here? From space?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, except they were not Broc, not really. They were these\u2026 \n*snort*\n\u2026things. Badgers. Unthinking brutes, mindless animals in the guise of Broc. Imagine, Agent McCallion, that you were trapped in a world of zombies.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I can appreciate your disappointment. I understand why you wanted to leave, but not why you needed help from those astronomers. Was your ship damaged?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n We don\u2019t need machines to move through space. We are Broc. We simply dig. A wormhole is the closest your culture has come to understanding it. We tunnel into The Other Soil.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Interesting. But you haven\u2019t explained why you are still here.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I was attacked \n*snort*\n by one of those beasts. I didn\u2019t know then, I thought they were Broc, I tried to speak with it and the savage tried to kill me. I fought it off, but in doing so I was injured. \n*whine*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n And those injuries meant you can\u2019t make wormholes?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n No, I can dig perfectly well, the problem is my nose.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Your nose? How- ah. You smelled them here\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n You understand?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n So, then you began gathering astronomers to make up for what you lost.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n \u2026Ok, I think I have the basics but there are some details we need to go over.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n And then you will release me?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n We can\u2019t just let you loose to kidnap more scientists.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n It would be in your best interest \n*snort*\n to assist me, Agent McCallion. My people would reward you for aiding me. We have much which could benefit your people.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Perhaps we will, but first we need to go over the details. For example, did you come alone?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Really? Here archaeologists usually work in teams.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I do not need assistants, \n*snort*\n I am quite capable of working alone.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Well\u2026 until now.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*growl*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n So you were the only Broc to come to Earth?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n And there is no one out there who might be looking for you?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Likely there are, but I travelled so far, through abandoned colonies and past forgotten planets, places known to no living Broc but myself. \n*whine*\n Finding me would be very difficult for them.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n When did you arrive?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Third of March, 2009.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n That\u2019s more than a year before the kidnappings began.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n At first, I struggled simply to survive, \n*whine*\n it was very difficult. I slowly learned the ways of this world: your habits, your languages, your technology. I feared revealing myself might lead to \n*snort*\n a situation like this.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I expect you had another sett, aside from the one you kept the astronomers in. Somewhere you slept during the day?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n We will need its location.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*whine*\n You will find little there. Bedding, some food\u2026\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Nonetheless, we must check.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n Agent McCallion, after my initial, and I think you would agree understandable hesitance, I have been very co-operative. I have given you a great deal of information about myself and my species. \n*snort*\n I have much more to offer, but you must do something to show my trust has not been misplaced. There must be give and take.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Yes, you have been quite co-operative, and so long as that continues, I am sure we will be able to make things more comfortable for you.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I am glad to hear that, Agent McCallion. Would you be willing to bring me some water?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Yes, that would be easy enough. Would you like something to eat as well?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Thank you, some fruit would be nice, I am quite partial to raspberries. And perhaps some nuts?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I will have it brought as soon as we finish here.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n And when do we expect that will be?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Very soon. I just need a couple more things to finish my report, such as the location of your sett.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n The co-ordinates are [REDACTED].\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Thank you. Finally, did you bring any equipment or other items with you to Earth?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n No, we have no need. We have excellent memories and need nothing so long as our noses and paws are working.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Perfect. I will see about getting your refreshments.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Can I now be released from these restraints?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I\u2019m not sure we can allow that just yet. You might simply dig your way out.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n If my nose were working yes, but without it I am blind. I do not know this place, I could be on the other side of the planet. Without smell, I need to know exactly where I am and where I am going, or I could emerge under water, or into magma.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Interesting, so you have to calculate the journey ahead of time?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes. So long as I am kept ignorant of my location, I am trapped here. So the bonds are completely unnecessary. \n*whine*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I\u2019ll speak to my supervisor about it.\n\n\n<END LOG>:\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Post interview SCP-6353-1 remained bound in restraints. A sett was found at the coordinates given.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1 appears to have used high quality silk and cashmere clothing as bedding. The food had been stolen from a high-end supermarket. A small collection of round stones was found, most were not local to the area, but none appeared to be of extra-terrestrial origin.\n\n\nThere were also multiple appliances including a fridge, a microwave and multiple computers. Data retrieved from the computers was primarily focused on the study of exoplanets and the evolution of mammals on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond interview with SCP-6353-1\n\n\nDate:\n 19/07/2020\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6353-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent McCallion\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>:\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Hello, I trust you are feeling more comfortable now?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n Yes, thank you Agent McCallion. Though if these are to be my permanent quarters, I should like to request some alterations.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n We might be able to accommodate that. But for the moment there are other matters we must discuss.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n You found my sett?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Yes, thank you again for being so cooperative. You mentioned that your people, \u201cThe Broc\u201d would reward us for assisting you.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n We look after our own. We are not as quick to abandon one another as \n*snort*\n other species might. Anyone would assists a Broc in peril will be granted a boon. Anyone who assisted one of my standing, could expect a great deal.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Could you teach us to travel through space as you do?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n \n*squeak*\n No, it cannot be taught. We are born with it. You cannot claim our power, but we might use it on your behalf. With our help you might rebuild the British Empire.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I think you are under a misapprehension, I do not act for the British government, or any government.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n A corporation then? A religion? The Illuminati?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I work for the Foundation. We exist to contain anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena. Our jurisdiction is anything which defies explanation.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n And what \n*snort*\n do you do with the anomalous?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Containment procedures vary, most physical objects are locked away.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n It would be a mistake to imprison me. I will be no threat to your species, or to normalcy, if I were to return to my people.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n But we have only your word on that. How are we to know you wouldn\u2019t return with an army?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n We have no need for your squalid little planet! Do you think Broc would wish to raise cubs amongst your poison and pestilence? Why would we bother when there are better worlds for which we don\u2019t need to fight?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing if you are lying to us.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n We do not betray! I am honourable! \n*snort*\n You dare to accuse me of lies?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Calm down, please. Try to look at things from our perspective, we have to be cautious.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*growl*\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I\u2019m not saying we won\u2019t help you, but we need to be careful. Perhaps we can work something out. Let me speak to my superiors.\n\n\n<END LOG>:\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n\n\u201cIt may be possible to make use of SCP-6353-1 to transport personnel and materials at the equivalent of FTL speeds. If SCP-6353-1 can be induced to co-operate it may prove a useful asset.\n\n\nI recommend agreeing to search for its planet of origin in exchange for service to the Foundation.\"- Agent Michael McCallion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite 91 Interdepartmental Meeting\n\n\nDate:\n 03/08/2010\n\nOnly the section of the meeting pertinent to SCP-6353-1 is included in this report.\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Next item is SCP-6353, has everyone had a chance to look over Agent McCallion\u2019s report?\n\n\nAgent Kohli:\n A lot of the teleport systems we use have some nasty side-effects. If SCP-6353-1 can be controlled, I\u2019m all for it.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n But can it be properly controlled? This is a recently acquired entity, we cannot yet be certain of its abilities or its motivations.\n\n\nProfessor Mairns:\n As far as we can see SCP-6353-1 is a standard badger, aside from its anomalous features, its biology appears completely standard, sedatives and amnestics work perfectly on it.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n And the injuries it claimed to sustain from a terrestrial badger?\n\n\nProfessor Mairns:\n They seem genuine, the damage to the snout is particularly bad and could certainly cause loss of smell. Were termination required, a bullet to the skull would be effective.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Are you in favour of the proposal?\n\n\nProfessor Mairns:\n At the very least, I believe we should use it as a pretext for some further experimentation, allowing us to monitor the warping process in a controlled environment.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n We\u2019ll go ahead with testing, should it prove to be everything we hope, we can move forward. However, there is our side of the bargain; can we find SCP-6353-1\u2019s planet of origin? And if so, would it be in our interest to share that information?\n\n\nAgent Franks:\n Assuming its story is true, we have to weigh up two worst case scenarios:\n\n\nA. SCP-6353-1 is lying, we send it home and trigger an invasion of Earth and the destruction of humanity.\n\n\nB. SCP-6353-1 is telling the truth, we keep it prisoner until others of its kind find us, at which point they take revenge via an invasion of Earth and the destruction of humanity.\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Hmm. In any event, finding the planet is likely to take some time, time in which we will monitor SCP-6353-1. Should we ever find it, we can make a decision then. I think we should agree to help SCP-6353-1, but the research\u2026 need not be high priority.\n\n\nProfessor Mairns:\n Do you want to put some of our people on it, or run it through an outside group?\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n Hmm\u2026 let\u2019s give it to the IAU.\n2\n I believe their efforts would be, ahem, adequate to the task.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-6353-1 was relocated to Site-207.

So you don\u2019t experience any ill effects from the warped space?\n\n\nAgent Horne:\n Not after the first few times, only problem is the lack of dignity.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n There is nothing undignified about using four limbs. \n*snort*\n Who is in charge here?\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Dr Warner and I are joint heads of the IAU.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n That is unfortunate. In my experience such partnerships are usually very \n*snort*\n tenuous.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n I think it works well, we help to balance each other out. We have different specialties.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Which of you will be responsible for finding my home?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Well, we won\u2019t personally be carrying out much of the research, we mostly handle administration these days.\n\n\nDr. Kowal:\n Ultimately, we share responsibility. Hopefully this arrangement will benefit everyone.\n\n\nAgent Durmaz:\n It\u2019s key that it does. Remember SCP-6353-1, if your work for us isn\u2019t satisfactory the research stops.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I am not a child! \n*snort*\nI have made a bargain and I will fulfil it. My kind do not break their oaths. It is your species which constantly lies, \n*snort*\n I should be the one to fear betrayal!\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Let\u2019s calm down. I\u2019m sure SCP-6353-1 will prove itself to be very valuable. If I may say, the possibilities you open up to us are astounding.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n Which are you: Kowal or Warner?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n I am Doctor Warner, this is Doctor Kowal.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I look forward to working with you. You may call me by my name rather than your designation. Translated to English, it is Milk Of The Earth, or Milk From The Soil.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Ha! I\u2019m sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh. It\u2019s just, back in the sixties I was in a band called Milk Of The Earth. M.O.T.E for short.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n I thought your band was called Gaia\u2019s Vandals?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n That was after. M.O.T.E broke up due to some political differences. Half of us became Gaia\u2019s Vandals, the others became The Lunar Pacifists.\n\n\nAgent Horne:\n Heh, Mote.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n Have you been given my work so far?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Yes, yes. Using spectroscopy to match the smells of planets is a very interesting approach, although I think we have equipment a little better than you were using. I can show you if you like?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n Yes, thank you Dr Warner, that is a most kind offer.\n\n\n<END LOG>:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance log: Dr Kowal's office\n\n\nDate:\n 03/09/2010\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>:\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Hello Milk Of The Earth, how can I help you?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I would like to complain about\u2026 \n*sniff*\n you have raspberries.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n You want to complain about me having raspberries?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n No, no, I just smelled them and it put me off track.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I grew them myself, would you like some?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*squeak*\n That is very kind of you.

However, with your help we would be able to get some into space without the need for expensive rocket launches.\n\n\nSCP-6353-01:\n An interesting idea Dr Warner, but I cannot survive in the vacuum any better than you can. We smell planets with suitable atmospheres and tunnel directly to them.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Ah, yes, I thought about that. I\u2019d like to arrange for us to build you a specialised space suit. That way you and some human personal will be able to make repeat trips with small sections of a telescope and assemble it in space.\n\n\nSCP-6353-01:\n \n*squeak*\n That may work. How long until the space suit and telescope can be deployed?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Oh, well I only just had the idea yesterday.

We need to go over what happened yesterday.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Hello, I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances Agent Pink.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Yes, unfortunately I've have to deal with dozens of cases like this. I'll need to hear your account of the events, we need to understand what went wrong.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I have already explained several times. I\u2019m sure you have access to the recordings.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n I do, but I also need to hear it first-hand. That's the proceedure; I\u2019m reinterviewing everyone.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Very well. I was working with Dr Warner when Agent Durmaz advised I was needed. MTF Beta-777 was preparing for a dangerous mission, I was to be on standby in case they needed an extraction.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n And this is something that you have done before?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, usually without difficulty. I was given the coordinates of the extraction point and waited. One hour and twenty-three minutes later the call came in and I tunnelled through.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n And Agent Horne went with you?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, Agent Durmaz had come on the previous mission. They would rotate you see, so it was Agent Horne\u2019s turn to assist me.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n What did you think of Agent Horne?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n There had been some difficulties in the past, we did not enjoy each other socially but we had no problems during assignments.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n I\u2019ve seen some documents suggesting you had quite a few arguments with Agent Horne since you joined us.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n We had some disagreements, but I believe we were coming to understand each other better. Agent Durmaz had disciplined Agent Horne and I had some useful conversations with Dr Pascal. It is tragic, \n*whine*\n we were just beginning to see the possibility of friendship\u2026 then the accident happened.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n We should talk about the accident. You successfully rendezvoused with MTF Beta-777 ?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, the situation was very dangerous and we needed to leave immediately. Some of them were badly injured. I opened the tunnel, the team followed me, and Agent Horne was to follow them.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n But Agent Horne did not follow them.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n No, no she didn\u2019t.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Why didn\u2019t she?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. \n*whine*\n We had practiced the procedure many times and she was always very good at that sort of thing.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n I understand the rule was that you were to wait for a signal before closing the tunnel. A signal from Agent Horne.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, and I thought she gave that signal.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Thought?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n It was a difficult environment, there was a lot of noise and smoke. At the time I was sure I heard Agent Horne given the signal.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n You seem to have some doubts now.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Well, when we got back, Agent Durmaz was quite insistent that the signal wasn\u2019t given. I expect you have the records which will advise either way.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n I do. They back up Agent Durmaz. The portal stayed open until the last of MTF Beta-777 entered, then closed. Agent Horne never gave the signal.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I see. So the fault is mine. \n*whine*\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Can you explain why you closed the portal early?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*whine*\n I don\u2019t know. I thought I heard the signal.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n I\u2019ll need more than that SCP-6353-1. An agent is dead. You abandoned her, left her alone with a dangerous anomaly. We need a reason, and if you ever want out of those restraints it had better be a good one.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*whine*\n I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\u2026 oh\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n \n*sigh*\n What?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Well, it might not be relevant, but I have been forgetting things lately.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Forgetting things?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Yes, my memory is perfect, always has been. But the past few weeks I\u2019ve been forgetting what day it was, or what I was doing. Sometimes I get a little confused. I told Doctor Pascal about it.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n And you think this played a role yesterday?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Maybe. Maybe it\u2019s those drugs you\u2019ve been giving me, when I\u2019m sent on missions and then need to forget about them.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n You\u2019re proposing the amnestics caused this?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n It\u2019s possible.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Your blood was tested yesterday and no trace of amnestics was found. Brain scans showed no sign of damage.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n But your scans can\u2019t tell why I am smarter than a badger. So perhaps they wouldn\u2019t be able to spot this kind of damage.\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n That sounds very convenient to me.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n\n\nAgent Pink:\n Agent Durmaz thinks you left her behind deliberately. That you hated Agent Horne and wanted to kill her. She says you\u2019re a murderer.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n She is wrong. \n*snort*\n Agent Durmaz is in shock, she needs time to grieve, to come to her senses. They were like sisters you see.

Fluv used to be just as grumpy.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I don\u2019t know. How much do we really know about SCP-6353-1? Whenever I talk to it there\u2019s this feeling of\u2026 distance. Like it\u2019s holding back. Like it\u2019s trying to play me.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n To be fair, that\u2019s to be expected. Put yourself in its shoes; you\u2019re stranded on another planet and imprisoned by aliens, aren\u2019t you going to be wary of trusting them?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n That\u2019s fair.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n I feel terrible about Agent Horne, I do, and if there was foul play SCP-6353-1 is the obvious suspect. But everyone makes mistakes, I certainly have.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n So you trust it?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but I\u2019m open to the idea that this was an accident.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I suppose we might all just be looking for someone to blame.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Yeah.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Or maybe there\u2019s more to this. Maybe we need to look deeper.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Edna\u2026\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Nothing wrong with being cautious is there?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Just\u2026 tread lightly with this one, ok?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Sure Otto.

I\u2019ll try not to keep you.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n It\u2019s quite alright. This was about SCP-6353-1 wasn\u2019t it?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n That\u2019s right, just a couple of things from your report I wanted to go over.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Anything I can do to help. Is it giving you trouble?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n It\u2026 it might be nothing, but I need to be sure. There were some stones found at SCP-6353-1's sett.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Aye, nothing unusual about them, except the variety I suppose. Our geologist said they were all terrestrial, nothing anomalous.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Did SCP-6353-1 explain them?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Said it was just a hobby, that it picked up stones wherever it went, mementos I guess.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Hmm\u2026\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n I haven\u2019t missed something here have I?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n No, no Agent McCallion, that all seems normal enough. I\u2019m just wondering why SCP-6353-1 hasn\u2019t done the same since we picked it up. We\u2019ve allowed it personal affects, but it hasn\u2019t brought any stones here to Site 207.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n \u2026okay\u2026\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I also wanted to ask you about the badger corpse you found.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Right, SCP-6353-1 identified that as the, um, Earth badger which injured its nose. Apparently SCP-6353-1 thought it was intelligent and tried to communicate, and the badger attacked. The vet said the wounds corresponded with being inflicted by a badger.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Isn\u2019t it odd though, for badgers to fight to the death like that? Not that I\u2019m an expert.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Yeah, the vet did mention that, maybe the Broc take things more seriously.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Hmm, maybe. One last question: what did you make of Professor Tanaka\u2019s belief that there might be more SCP-6353 on Earth?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n It was a concern, with their abilities they could come and go at their leisure and avoid detection. We've put out a notice for increased vigilance and are harvesting data from all known civilian badger watchers. We\u2019ve also invested in a widespread program of tagging badgers under the guise of conservation. No unusual behaviour or significant changes in population have been noticed.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n So you don\u2019t put any credence in Tanaka\u2019s claim?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Maybe if he\u2019d actually seen another one, or heard SCP-6353-1 communicating with one. But you\u2019ve got to take Tanaka\u2019s condition into account, he was in a stressful situation, could have imagined it, or misheard.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Yes, yes you\u2019re quite right. Ok then.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n If there\u2019s anything else you need just let me know.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Could you have all the materials shipped over to Site 207? The computers, the stones, the badger.\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Of course, I\u2019ll see to it in the morning.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I don\u2019t want to be a pain, but could you get started today?\n\n\nAgent McCallion:\n Yes, sorry, right away.\n\n\n>END LOG<\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance log: SCP-6353-1's holding cell\n\n\nDate:\n 26/11/2010\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Hello Milk Of The Earth, how are you?\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n I am falsely imprisoned Dr Kowal, which is not conducive to a good temperament.\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I know, I'm very sorry things have turned out this way.

On the cart are the remains of a dead badger.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n Have you lost your mind? Why are you bringing that in here?\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n I thought I should organise a reunion. You identified it as the Earth badger which damaged your nose.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n I killed it in self defence! \n*snort*\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Maybe. But there's something about your story that doesn't add up. You see this?\n\n\nDr Kowal lifts a blue stone from the table\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n This is Azurite.

Now tell me the truth about Agent Horne or I break it.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n \n*snort*\n I didn't kill her!\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n \u2026liar.\n\n\nDr Kowal throws the stone to the floor and crushes it with her foot.\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n No! You stupid ape! You old fool!\n\n\nDr Kowal:\n Oops\n\n\nSCP-6353-1:\n Let me out of here! Let me out now!\n\n\nA black void appears across the floor of the cell into which Dr Kowal and SCP-6353-1 fall. Most of the equipment in the cell including the badger corpse also fall into the portal before it closes.\n\n\n>END LOG<\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite 207 Security Breach\n\n\nDate\n 02/12/2020\n\n\nAt 13.34 alarms sound as monitors detect three entities in SCP-6353-1\u2019s cell.\n\nThe entities appear to be Eurasian Badgers, designated SCP-6353-3, SCP-6353-4 and SCP-6353-5. Security personnel enter the cell at which point SCP-6353-3 demands to speak with Dr Otto Warner.\n\n\n\n\n>BEGIN LOG<\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Hello, I\u2019m Dr Warner.\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n Greetings, I am Wind In The Grass, emissary of The Broc. \n*snort*\n I warn you as I warned your fellows; any attempt to harm me shall be taken as an act of war.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n We just have to take precautions, I'm sure you understand.\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n I do.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Where is Dr Kowal?\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n She is with The Broc, she is unharmed for now, but needed for the trial. Questions must be answered.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n What trial?\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n There is a dispute, we must determine the truth. Tooth Of The Water is dead. Milk Of The Earth claims that humans are responsible, that you kept her as a slaveafter killing her sister. \n*snort*\n Dr Edna Kowal claims Milk Of The Earth murdered her own kin. The evidence is not clear. Dr Edna Kowal claimed there is proof here, that you can provide a file called SCP-6353, which will validate her.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Yes, yes it will. Can you wait here a few minutes?\n\n\nAgent Lee:\n Sir! Are you sure you want to hand over Foundation files?\n\n\nDr Warner:\n It's that or risk an interstellar war! Besides, it's one file, I\u2019m hardly giving away the farm.\n\n\nDr Warner leaves the room and returns with a USB drive\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Everything you need is on there.\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n \n*squeak*\n Thank you for your cooperation. If what you say is correct, Dr Edna Kowal will be returned to you.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n When?\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n Soon. She asked me to deliver a personal message for you Dr Warner.\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Yes?\n\n\nSCP-6353-3:\n \"Water my garden.\"\n\n\nSCP-6353-3, SCP-6353-4 and SCP-6353-5 create portals and disappear\n\n\nDr Warner:\n Thank god.\n\n\n>END LOG<\n\n\n\n\n- ERROR - INCORRECT INPUT - ERROR - UNKNOWN USER - ERROR - UNAUTHORISED ACCESS -\n\n\n- OVERRIDE ACCEPTED - USER \"WIND IN THE GRASS\" LOGIN SUCCESSFUL -\n\n\n\n\nListen and understand.\n\n\n\n\nThis file is seen by \nThe Gathered\n and judgment is made. Humans cannot be trusted, their words are often false, but the same can be true of \nThe Broc\n. In this case it is agreed that Milk Of The Earth is a liar and a murderer.\n\nAt the dawn of her greatest discovery, our beloved \nTooth Of The Water\n was betrayed by her own blood. Her body is given the honours of a champion and her memory is celebrated at each \nFeast Of Heroes\n.\n\nThe murderer is punished by \nThe Way Of The Third Angel\n.\n\nThese events bring shame to us, but must not be forgotten.\n\n\nDoctor Edna Kowal\n is returned to her people with the gratitude of \nThe Broc\n and charged with delivering our message to \nHumanity\n:\n\n\"We wish no quarrel with \nmankind\n, the planet Earth is yours and you may keep it. Yet you must not be reckless. Though far removed they may be, the \nBadgers\n of your world are likely our own kin. We reserve the right to study our past and it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of our distant relations. Should these interests be threatened, \nThe Broc\n are entitled to intervene.\"\n\n\n\n\nThese are the words of \nWind In The Grass\n, First Ambassador of the Crossroads.\n\n\n\n\nListen and understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
