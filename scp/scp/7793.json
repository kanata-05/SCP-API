Sequestered from the festivals and rituals.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEntrance.\n\n\n \n\n\nRusted halls surround you. Your muffled footsteps and gentle creaking, your quiet breath, and idle ambience. There's something you can't remember to remember.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYou entwine with the corridors.

It's warm and damp here, slathered with the feeling of company. There are dents and torn sheets of corrugated steel, but you feel at peace here regardless. It's quiet, it's simple.
