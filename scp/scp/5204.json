Any sightings of an SCP-5204 event should be attributed to an optical illusion or the result of \"cabin fever.\"\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5204 is an event related to the natural phenomenon \nAurora Borealis\n.\n1\n While it is unknown whether Aurora Borealis predates or is caused by SCP-5204, all SCP-5204 events occur around the Great Lakes region of Northern America, particularly Lake Huron, during any full moon in February and March.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5204 Event, Ortus, Michigan.\n\n\n\n\nDuring an SCP-5204 event, thousands of multi-chromatic, translucent entities will emerge from any body of water and begin to dance from between one meter to 100 meters above the surface. The size of the body of water is reflective of the size that the entity can reach, with a ten-liter bucket creating an entity approximately 30 centimeters in height and Lake Ontario producing entities of ~250 meters in height. Because of the incorporeal nature of said entities, most are dismissed as water vapor or other natural phenomena. Additionally, most people are not inclined to be outside of their homes in the middle of winter at night, so most sightings can be dismissed as optical illusions.\n\n\nThe visibility of the entities in an SCP-5204 event varies wildly, from an incorporeal \"whisp\" similar to a candle's flame, to fully defined and articulated human beings. Regardless of form, all entities will find a partner and engage in a slow ballroom-style dance. During the course of the event, they will begin to rise higher into the sky before disappearing completely at dawn.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5204 came to the Foundation's attention on March 2nd, 2001, after Christie Robinson of Chicago, a forty-seven-year-old Michigan native, called the Michigan State Police Department. She claimed to have seen her deceased father walk across Lake Huron and begin dancing with her mother, who had died twenty years prior. She alleged that there was significant occult activity in the area and that her hometown had changed significantly since she moved away in 1982, citing odd behaviors from the townsfolk. When the police sent a unit to the town of Ortus, Michigan two hours later, they found her father's home had signs of forced entry. Further inspection showed fingerprints on the banister and boot prints leading up to her room. Robinson was found at the bottom of the basement stairs, having died of a broken neck. At this point, the Foundation became aware of the situation and dispatched Captain Quintin McNamara and Warrant Officer Madison Watts of Mobile Task Force Sigma-70, (\"Sidewinders\"), to investigate.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0001\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0001\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Alright. I think it's\u2026 on. Great. Alright. So we arrived at 7 PM last night and-\n\n\nWatts:\n Closer to 8, I think, but go on.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Anyways. We arrived at the house. Modest two-story cabin, situated near Lake Huron. I'm gonna say 100 grand at most. What do you think, Maddy?\n\n\nWatts:\n Waterfront? You're probably pushing 200k.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Eh. It's not that close. But anyhow. Snow fell since the crime so checking for prints outside was useless. Kudos to the Staties, they didn't really mess with the scene that much. The front door wasn't so much breached as in shattered. Looks like somebody blew the handle off. But that's the curious part. We found fingerprints on the handle, so I really don't know what happened there.\n\n\nWatts:\n And the handle was iron, which rules out a couple of things. And no hits on the prints, so our culprit hasn't been picked up for anything.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Speaking of prints, the Staties mentioned muddy prints leading up to the bedroom. Guess where those don't go? Out of the bedroom. There's a solid trail of dirt leading up to Christie's bed, but they don't lead out of the room, or down to the basement. It looks like they sat on the bed, and then disappeared.\n\n\nWatts:\n Do we have a time table for this?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Yeah. Call was placed at 6:31 am and ended at 6:42. Which means she died somewhere between 6:42 and 7:33, when the trooper showed up. But back to the boots. We're looking at a Size 11, Men's. Some kind of snowboot.\n\n\nWatts:\n Which narrows it down by fuck all, because Michigan is God's frozen and forsaken hellscape. And everyone here wears big boots\u2026 Fuck. This is for the records, isn't it.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Yep. But there is a ray of sunshine. Looks like Robinson called somebody by the name of Lory Fisher just before she called the police. Looks like she's the town librarian. We're gonna talk to her tomorrow, see if that leads to anything.\n\n\nWatts:\n You're gonna talk to her. \nI'm\n gonna check in with the neighbors. You know libraries give me the creeps.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Look. Not all libraries are like the Wande- Nevermind. I'm not gonna try to force you.\n\n\nWatts:\n Also, we're gonna take a walk around town, check up on these \ncultist\n claims. And buy some warmer clothes, because these frankly don't cut it.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Amen to that. Alright.

Investigation day two. McNamara checking in. Things went okay today. Watts and I walked through the downtown area and found nothing out of the ordinary. It's a typical \ndeath of the small town\n kinda thing. Some boarded-up stores on Main Street, locals complaining about the Walmart in the next town over stealing away the money, pretty standard. Of all the \ncults\n I've ever seen, this would be the friendliest. I figured the cold would have them heads down and running for shelter but I guess they're all used to it. We must have been stopped half a dozen times for chit-chat. One thing did stand out to me. I'm gonna play it for you real quick.\n\n\n[A click can be heard.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Good morning. Do you sell jackets?\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n New in town? \n[Short laugh]\n Looks like you didn't pack as well for the cold. Don't worry, we've got more than enough to spare. You partial to wool or synthetic?\n\n\nWatts:\n Whatever's warmest. Christ, I'm about ten seconds from setting my sleeves on fire.\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n \n[Laughter.]\n That'd be the worst mistake. Frostbitten burns are the worst feelin' on Earth.\n\n\nWatts:\n I'll take your word for it. \n[Pause]\n Anything to do around town?\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n Not really much. We don't get too many tourists this time of year. If you're religious, Father Williams is usually always in.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Not sure how much I've got to confess.\n\n\nUnknown Voice:\n Everyone's got a secret or two, Quintin. Talkin about it is good for the soul.\n\n\n[A second click is heard.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Did you hear that? He called me Quintin. We didn't even introduce ourselves. I'd like to say I picked up on that right away, but I was a bit distracted. Anyways. The library. I flashed my badge to Mrs. Fisher and she closed up shop and pulled me into a back room. Unfortunately, there's not much to tell. She didn't really know anything. Apparently, Robinson had called her in the middle of the night, crying and screaming. According to the phone company, the call only lasted three minutes, and Mrs. Fisher says that Christie never managed to get a sensible word out before hanging up. We're still waiting on the transcripts from the State Police, but I'm guessing she was a lot more composed if they sent a car over.\n\n\n[A phone can be heard ringing.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Wonder what that is.\n\n\n\n\n[Log Paused]\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara:\n In a startling turn of events, Mrs. Fisher called and a trooper came by with the transcript. Looks like we have a lead. According to Mrs. Fisher, Robinson was said one word about four times. \nWilliams.\n And guess what the transcript also says? \nWilliams.\n Sounds like the deceased said that Father Williams was leading some kind of necromantic cult. Apparently she saw him conversing with her father before he walked out onto the lake.\n\n\n[A door can be heard opening.]\n\n\nWatts:\n Guess who got a break in the case!\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Is it Father Williams?\n\n\nWatts:\n How did- Nevermind. One of the neighbors got up in the night and saw the clergyman walk into the house.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n I've got his name on the transcript and from the call Robinson made to Mrs. Fisher. Wanna head down to the church?\n\n\nWatts:\n As long as we don't have to sit through Mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0002\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupplement:\n\n\nWhen the Agents arrived at the church, they were unable to locate Father Williams. Evidence, such as a warm cup of coffee, suggested he had recently vacated the premises. Agents were able to match the fingerprints on the cup to prints left on the doorknob at the Robinsons home. A search of Father Williams' residence lead to the discovery of boots matching the ones from the crime scene.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0028\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0028\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Update Log Number\u2026 What are we on now, Maddy?\n\n\nWatts:\n Fuck. Probably like almost thirty.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Nevermind. We've been here about a month and Father Williams continues to evade capture. Not much to say. The interim priest arrived yesterday, and he knows less than we do. The weather continues to depress morale. Watts has been complaining about the cold. Constantly.\n\n\nWatts:\n Look me in the fucking eyes, Quintin, and tell me it doesn't make your implants ache. I'm completely justified here.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Then tell Carlisle that he needs to do more cold-weather testing. Don't take it out on me. I can't control the weather, Maddy.\n\n\nWatts:\n I will lock you out of this hotel room if you quote that one more time.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n \n[Laughing.]\n Anyways. The town seems to be giving us a cold shoulder. When we asked Ms. May Crawford about Father Williams, she informed us that we had stayed the maximum amount of days in her motel. So we had to move to the hotel on the outskirts of town.\n\n\nWatts:\n Which has a half-broken heating system! And I cannot tell you how fucking mad that makes me. I'm gonna tear that smug asshole's spine out when we find him.\n\n\n[A button on the recording device is pressed, presumably in error.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n You okay, Maddy?\n\n\nWatts:\n Yeah\u2026 I'm just almost out of meds and I've had to ration them.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n You should have told me.\n\n\nWatts:\n It's not a big deal. I'll be fine.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n It's a big deal to me, Maddy.\n\n\nWatts:\n Thanks. \n[Pause.]\n Finish your log.\n\n\n[The Record button is pressed.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Alright, where was I? Oh yeah. Tonight, as usual, we will be driving down to the Robinson house to see if anything interesting happens.\n\n\nWatts:\n Say it scientifically. That's too vague.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n They've already heard it twenty ti\u2026 Whatever. Due to the circumstances of Christie Robinson's sighting of the alleged anomaly, it's likely tied to the day/night cycle. As such, we walk to the shore of the lake every night. \n[Pause.]\n Satisfied?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0028\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0029\u00a0|\u00a0Watts\u00a0+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0029\u00a0|\u00a0Watts\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatts:\n I\u2026 I don't know.\n\n\n[Several minutes of silence.]\n\n\nWatts:\n I just don't know how to put this into words?\n\n\nWatts:\n We're okay. Quintin is just\u2026 He's fine. He's just not talking.\n\n\n[Nearly twenty minutes pass.]\n\n\nWatts:\n Okay. We walked through the Robinsons' backyard. Everything was fine. Well, normal. When we got to the shore, it was just grey. Nothing but snow and ice. Then the moon came out from the clouds and this bright green light flashed at the end of the peninsula across the bay, the clouds disappeared, and\u2026\n\n\nWatts:\n Then a hundred thousand souls began to dance across a ballroom of black ice. Lit in every color\u2026 I\u2026 I saw\u2026\n\n\n[Soft crying can be heard.]\n\n\nWatts:\n I saw my dad. And my mom. Exactly like they were when they\u2026 they died.\n\n\nWatts:\n And my dad turned to me and just\u2026 winked. \n[Quiet Laugh.]\n Like he used to do when he'd sneak me extra dessert or something. And then, they kept dancing.

Morning after the anomaly. Quintin's still shaken up, so he asked me to do the log\u2026 Fuck, I'm not great at these. Okay. Normal stuff first. We're fine on food, lodging, and cash. I've got maybe ten days worth of meds left, which isn't great. Especially if the townies do that cold shoulder bullshit again. Might just break that shoulder clean off.\n\n\nWatts:\n But the anomaly. I'm still processing it. It was definitely real, like that really was my parents. I just know. Which means\u2026 I don't know what it means.\n\n\nWatts:\n Okay. I'm gonna focus on what I do know. Or my suspicions. Fuck, I'm flubbing this. Okay. So that green flash? I think that was caused by a person. And there's really only one person that could be. Father Williams. And the townies aren't gonna give him up, so we need to set a trap. One sec.\n\n\n[Recording Paused.]\n\n\nWatts:\n Probably should have just stopped the recording. Anyways. I called in for reinforcements. Gerald and James\n2\n should be here by tomorrow morning, plus any stragglers they bring along.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Did you tell them to pack warm?\n\n\nWatts:\n Yeah. I told them to bring extra.\n\n\n[Several minutes of silence.]\n\n\nWatts:\n Hey Quintin\u2026 What. What did you see out there?\n\n\n[No response.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0030\u00a0|\u00a0Watts\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0031\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0+\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0031\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Maddy, if you find this, and I'm not there, I'm sorry.\n\n\n[The sound of crunching snow can be heard.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Madison is asleep back in the hotel. I have to do this\u2026 alone. When we got back to the hotel, I found a business card in the pocket of the jacket I'd bought when we got here. I don't know how, or why. But it's for that clothing store. From Father Williams.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n There's a note on it, too.\n\n\n[McNamara clears his throat.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n \nDear Quintin. We need to talk. Alone. Meet me behind the Robinson house at midnight tonight. By the lake.\n Signed, \nFather Williams\n.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n I'd be worried if I didn't\u2026 you know\u2026 have my\u2026 anyways. And that's where I am now. Just pulled up to the house.\n\n\n[Crunching snow can be heard for several minutes.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n My God. I\u2026 don't know what to\u2026\n\n\n[Several seconds of silence.]\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Hundreds of people just dancing\u2026 over the lake. Not people. more like ghosts. I'm at the shore and it feels like I could reach out and touch them. It's just so\u2026\n\n\nWilliams:\n Beautiful? Ethereal?\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Step back. I will not hesitate.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Put the gun away, Quintin. I have no intention to harm you.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n How do you know my name?\n\n\nWilliams:\n Will you sit on this bench and speak with an old man?\n\n\n[Several seconds pass.]\n\n\nWilliams:\n Are you a religious man?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n I\u2026 No. Not after everything I've seen. Everything I've done.\n\n\nWilliams:\n You've had a hard twenty years, haven't you? Made you give up on God?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n No. If there is a God, he's not a caring God. \n[Pause.]\n How do you know so much about me?\n\n\nWilliams:\n The Dead have so much to say, if you'd only listen. \n[Pause.]\n I know who you saw out there. And I am so, so sorry. None of them deserved that. And neither did you.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Do. Not. Play these fucking games with me. You don't even know what the hell you're talking about.\n\n\nWilliams:\n No. Probably not. But you still have my sympathy and condolences.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Did you extend those to Christie?\n\n\nWilliams:\n Christie burned with a fire most people strive their entire lives to glimpse. It's what makes humans so unique in this universe. That pressing, eternal need to be. To exist. It's one of your most incredible traits.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n I didn't ask about that.\n\n\nWilliams:\n I did what I had to. To protect this place. And I regret it.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Just a fucked up sense of duty, huh?\n\n\nWilliams:\n Surely you would understand the lengths you must go to protect the most important things?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n No. I do my job because I know the consequences of failure.\n\n\nWilliams:\n As do I.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n I don't buy it.\n\n\nWilliams:\n I didn't ask you to come here to plead my case. The Foundation creeps like ivy over anything they deem \nunnatural\n. But this? This is the one place they should not touch.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n Why not?\n\n\nWilliams:\n Those monsters of man's creation? The clockwork titans, abominations of flesh and magic? Places scarred by hate and fear and bloodlust? This is not one of them.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n And?\n\n\nWilliams:\n Do you believe in the soul, Quintin? Do you believe that you have one?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n If I did, Director Carlisle would have cut it out by now.\n\n\nWilliams:\n \n[Polite laugh.]\n I can see yours burning bright. Of everything, the soul is one thing that never fades away. Look across the water. Do you see them burning across the sky?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n \u2026Yeah.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Do you see the man holding a young girl in one arm, and a woman in the other? Do you know who they are?\n\n\nMcNamara:\n It's the Robinsons, isn't it.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Send me your scientists and I will make them understand why they cannot interfere here.\n\n\nMcNamara:\n We don't negotiate.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Absolutism is not something that survives the test of time. I will compromise, but I will not abandon my post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0031\u00a0|\u00a0McNamara\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPost\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Post\u00a0Investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain McNamara returned to his hotel and alerted Overwatch Command to the situation.

Unfortunately, there's not much to tell. She didn't really know anything. Apparently, Robinson had called her in the middle of the night, crying and screaming. According to the phone company, the call only lasted three minutes, and Mrs. Fisher says that Christie never managed to get a sensible word out before hanging up. We're still waiting on the transcripts from the State Police, but I'm guessing she was a lot more composed if they sent a car over. [A phone can be heard ringing.] McNamara: Wonder what that is. [Log Paused] McNamara: In a startling turn of events, Mrs. Fisher called and a trooper came by with the transcript. Looks like we have a lead. According to Mrs. Fisher, Robinson was said one word about four times. Williams. And guess what the transcript also says? Williams. Sounds like the deceased said that Father Williams was leading some kind of necromantic cult. Apparently she saw him conversing with her father before he walked out onto the lake. [A door can be heard opening.] Watts: Guess who got a break in the case! McNamara: Is it Father Williams? Watts: How did- Nevermind. One of the neighbors got up in the night and saw the clergyman walk into the house. McNamara: I've got his name on the transcript and from the call Robinson made to Mrs. Fisher. Wanna head down to the church? Watts: As long as we don't have to sit through Mass.",
        "McNamara: Update Log Number\u2026 What are we on now, Maddy? Watts: Fuck. Probably like almost thirty. McNamara: Nevermind. We've been here about a month and Father Williams continues to evade capture. Not much to say. The interim priest arrived yesterday, and he knows less than we do. The weather continues to depress morale. Watts has been complaining about the cold. Constantly. Watts: Look me in the fucking eyes, Quintin, and tell me it doesn't make your implants ache. I'm completely justified here. McNamara: Then tell Carlisle that he needs to do more cold-weather testing. Don't take it out on me. I can't control the weather, Maddy. Watts: I will lock you out of this hotel room if you quote that one more time. McNamara: [Laughing.] Anyways. The town seems to be giving us a cold shoulder. When we asked Ms. May Crawford about Father Williams, she informed us that we had stayed the maximum amount of days in her motel. So we had to move to the hotel on the outskirts of town. Watts: Which has a half-broken heating system! And I cannot tell you how fucking mad that makes me. I'm gonna tear that smug asshole's spine out when we find him. [A button on the recording device is pressed, presumably in error.] McNamara: You okay, Maddy? Watts: Yeah\u2026 I'm just almost out of meds and I've had to ration them. McNamara: You should have told me. Watts: It's not a big deal. I'll be fine. McNamara: It's a big deal to me, Maddy. Watts: Thanks. [Pause.] Finish your log. [The Record button is pressed.] McNamara: Alright, where was I? Oh yeah. Tonight, as usual, we will be driving down to the Robinson house to see if anything interesting happens. Watts: Say it scientifically. That's too vague. McNamara: They've already heard it twenty ti\u2026 Whatever. Due to the circumstances of Christie Robinson's sighting of the alleged anomaly, it's likely tied to the day/night cycle. As such, we walk to the shore of the lake every night. [Pause.] Satisfied?",
        "Watts: I\u2026 I don't know. [Several minutes of silence.] Watts: I just don't know how to put this into words? Watts: We're okay. Quintin is just\u2026 He's fine. He's just not talking. [Nearly twenty minutes pass.] Watts: Okay. We walked through the Robinsons' backyard. Everything was fine. Well, normal. When we got to the shore, it was just grey. Nothing but snow and ice. Then the moon came out from the clouds and this bright green light flashed at the end of the peninsula across the bay, the clouds disappeared, and\u2026 Watts: Then a hundred thousand souls began to dance across a ballroom of black ice. Lit in every color\u2026 I\u2026 I saw\u2026 [Soft crying can be heard.] Watts: I saw my dad. And my mom. Exactly like they were when they\u2026 they died. Watts: And my dad turned to me and just\u2026 winked. [Quiet Laugh.] Like he used to do when he'd sneak me extra dessert or something. And then, they kept dancing. I don't\u2026",
        "Watts: Alright. Morning after the anomaly. Quintin's still shaken up, so he asked me to do the log\u2026 Fuck, I'm not great at these. Okay. Normal stuff first. We're fine on food, lodging, and cash. I've got maybe ten days worth of meds left, which isn't great. Especially if the townies do that cold shoulder bullshit again. Might just break that shoulder clean off. Watts: But the anomaly. I'm still processing it. It was definitely real, like that really was my parents. I just know. Which means\u2026 I don't know what it means. Watts: Okay. I'm gonna focus on what I do know. Or my suspicions. Fuck, I'm flubbing this. Okay. So that green flash? I think that was caused by a person. And there's really only one person that could be. Father Williams. And the townies aren't gonna give him up, so we need to set a trap. One sec. [Recording Paused.] Watts: Probably should have just stopped the recording. Anyways. I called in for reinforcements. Gerald and James 2 should be here by tomorrow morning, plus any stragglers they bring along. McNamara: Did you tell them to pack warm? Watts: Yeah. I told them to bring extra. [Several minutes of silence.] Watts: Hey Quintin\u2026 What. What did you see out there? [No response.]",
        "McNamara: Maddy, if you find this, and I'm not there, I'm sorry. [The sound of crunching snow can be heard.] McNamara: Madison is asleep back in the hotel. I have to do this\u2026 alone. When we got back to the hotel, I found a business card in the pocket of the jacket I'd bought when we got here. I don't know how, or why. But it's for that clothing store. From Father Williams. McNamara: There's a note on it, too. [McNamara clears his throat.] McNamara: Dear Quintin. We need to talk. Alone. Meet me behind the Robinson house at midnight tonight. By the lake. Signed, Father Williams . McNamara: I'd be worried if I didn't\u2026 you know\u2026 have my\u2026 anyways. And that's where I am now. Just pulled up to the house. [Crunching snow can be heard for several minutes.] McNamara: My God. I\u2026 don't know what to\u2026 [Several seconds of silence.] McNamara: Hundreds of people just dancing\u2026 over the lake. Not people. more like ghosts. I'm at the shore and it feels like I could reach out and touch them. It's just so\u2026 Williams: Beautiful? Ethereal? McNamara: Step back. I will not hesitate. Williams: Put the gun away, Quintin. I have no intention to harm you. McNamara: How do you know my name? Williams: Will you sit on this bench and speak with an old man? [Several seconds pass.] Williams: Are you a religious man? McNamara: I\u2026 No. Not after everything I've seen. Everything I've done. Williams: You've had a hard twenty years, haven't you? Made you give up on God? McNamara: No. If there is a God, he's not a caring God. [Pause.] How do you know so much about me? Williams: The Dead have so much to say, if you'd only listen. [Pause.] I know who you saw out there. And I am so, so sorry. None of them deserved that. And neither did you. McNamara: Do. Not. Play these fucking games with me. You don't even know what the hell you're talking about. Williams: No. Probably not. But you still have my sympathy and condolences. McNamara: Did you extend those to Christie? Williams: Christie burned with a fire most people strive their entire lives to glimpse. It's what makes humans so unique in this universe. That pressing, eternal need to be. To exist. It's one of your most incredible traits. McNamara: I didn't ask about that. Williams: I did what I had to. To protect this place. And I regret it. McNamara: Just a fucked up sense of duty, huh? Williams: Surely you would understand the lengths you must go to protect the most important things? McNamara: No. I do my job because I know the consequences of failure. Williams: As do I. McNamara: I don't buy it. Williams: I didn't ask you to come here to plead my case. The Foundation creeps like ivy over anything they deem unnatural . But this? This is the one place they should not touch. McNamara: Why not? Williams: Those monsters of man's creation? The clockwork titans, abominations of flesh and magic? Places scarred by hate and fear and bloodlust? This is not one of them. McNamara: And? Williams: Do you believe in the soul, Quintin? Do you believe that you have one? McNamara: If I did, Director Carlisle would have cut it out by now. Williams: [Polite laugh.] I can see yours burning bright. Of everything, the soul is one thing that never fades away. Look across the water. Do you see them burning across the sky? McNamara: \u2026Yeah. Williams: Do you see the man holding a young girl in one arm, and a woman in the other? Do you know who they are? McNamara: It's the Robinsons, isn't it. Williams: Send me your scientists and I will make them understand why they cannot interfere here. McNamara: We don't negotiate. Williams: Absolutism is not something that survives the test of time. I will compromise, but I will not abandon my post.",
