The following purge methods have been approved:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation source\n\n\nPurge method(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Foundation database\n\n\nAutomated expungement by file management programs, verified periodically by Information Technology Team ITT-\ud835\udc225790.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Foundation physical records\n\n\nCreation of new physical records is prohibited. All known physical records containing \ud835\udc225790 have been incinerated in ritualistic ovens and pyres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnauthorised records by Foundation personnel\n\n\nDocuments are to be incinerated as above (if physical) or deleted without archival (if digital), and the staff member(s) in question amnesticised, demoted and quarantined for a minimum of three months. If no anomalous activity occurs within this time, the employee may be reassigned. If said quarantine is not possible, termination is deemed a satisfactory alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrains of Containment Team CT-5790\n\n\nBimonthly amnesticisation and biannual rotation of personnel to prevent memory resurgence. If [DATA EXPUNGED] has already manifested, the site is to be quarantined and MTFs Mu-13 (\"Ghostbusters\") and Theta-0 (\"Antihierophanics\") are to be dispatched to the location. [DATA EXPUNGED] potential delayed manifestation, any persons with non-atheistic religious beliefs are to be terminated shortly thereafter. Any realised iconography is to be extracted from the cerebellum and incinerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrains of assigned mediums\n\n\nMemory may be removed following communications depending on the methods used. If this does not occur, a week-long course of deep amnestics is to be used to prevent the possible retention of spiritually-obtained information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreexisting literature\n\n\nSearch and destroy via dispatch of MTF Chi-9 (\"Page Turners\"). If found, documents containing \ud835\udc225790 are to be incinerated on-site, alongside the relevant relics, [DATA EXPUNGED], and civilian corpses. For this reason, all members of MTF \u03c7-9 have been provided with portable exorcism equipment and trained in its usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrains of MTFs \u03bc-13, \u03c7-9, and \u03b8-0\n\n\nAmnestics administered following each SCP-5790- or \ud835\udc225790-related dispatch. Relevant personnel are to attend no more than two incidents invoking \ud835\udc225790 per annum, with the exception of \u03b8-0, for whom [DATA EXPUNGED] core duties. A series of planned neurological surgeries are expected to allow \u03b8-0's members to better cope with their resultant psychological disorders, and lower turnover dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED] widespread theistic belief systems. Protocol MATTHEW (long-term global-theological cultural shift) has been put in place to facilitate this. Subtle short-term procedures are also planned, [DATA EXPUNGED] increase biological similarity between cerebrospinal fluid and holy water to lower death toll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Foundation-led \ud835\udc225790 retrieval effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional methods of destroying \ud835\udc225790 may be used contextually following approval by assigned mediums. If no persons with a spiritual connection or second sight are available, consultation with a member of Level-4 personnel with \"First Principles\" emergency response training is advised. All persons involved are expected to seek amnestic treatment and reassignment shortly thereafter.\n\n\nInformation Retrieval Procedures:\n Thanks to a focused effort by Foundation personnel to execute Protocol ICON, \ud835\udc225790 has been purged globally from the realm of the living. In the event that knowledge of SCP-5790 or its containment procedures is required, the following actions are to be taken:\n\n\n\n\nThe personnel requiring the information are to submit a formal request to Senior Researcher Grahams, the current Hazardous Information Containment Liaison for SCP-5790. Requesting the information either out of personal curiosity, or for low-priority matters, is strictly prohibited.\n\n\nContingent on said request being approved, SR. Grahams is to schedule an appointment between the personnel submitting the request and an assigned medium. Proxies may be used if the former displays an aversion to postmortem communications.\n\n\n\ud835\udc225790 is to be retrieved from the informational afterlife by the assigned medium, through use of dowsing, talking boards, or other permitted forms of negligible-risk necromancy.\n\n\n\ud835\udc225790 is to be treated as detailed under \nInformational Handling Procedures\n.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel are to note that the use of occult communications for information storage does not have any bearing on SCP-5790 or its properties, beyond eliminating the risk [DATA EXPUNGED] false idol. The above sections cannot and should not be used to attempt to discern the nature of SCP-5790.\n\n\nAs per its official policy, the Foundation remains opposed to the use of non-human afterlives for personal or organisational gains. In the case of SCP-5790 and its ability to realise [DATA EXPUNGED], however, the use of actualised occultism to release the spirits of incinerated documents poses too great a benefit to containment to be discounted.\n\n\nThe use of Protocol ICON as standard info-containment for infohazardous objects is under consideration, pending the development of a method of expanding the scope of SCP-5790's secondary properties.\n\n\nDescription:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5789\n | SCP-5790 | \nSCP-5791\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5790\n\" by MaliceAforethought, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
