Play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe click of a person's tape recorder being turned off.\n)\n\n\nGALLIO:\n Come in.\n\n\n(\nThe door opens. There are footsteps on carpet\n)\n\n\n???:\n Good evening, Agent Gallio.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n I\u2019m a researcher. I\u2019m not an agent any more.\n\n\n???:\n As of forty minutes ago, that is no longer true.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n I\u2019m being reactivated?\n\n\n???:\n I am empowered to speak on behalf of the O5 Council. They have been very appreciative of your sterling work here as a researcher and wish to utilise both those skills, and your experience in the field. You\u2019re already familiar with the case of SCP-6881. Did anything strike you as unusual about it? Other than the obvious, of course.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n Yeah. The background. The Foundation became interested in Shibbet\u2019s Vale and the lake because of \u2018anomalous activity\u2019 in the area. But there\u2019s nothing in the mission records about what those anomalies were. Kind of strange given that anomalies are what we do.\n\n\n???:\n Very perceptive, Agent Gallio. The O5 Council would like those blanks filled in, too. The data we have suggests Shibbet\u2019s Vale has a long history of very strange things but the details appear to have been lost to a computing error. Before we can fully contain SCP-6881, the Foundation needs the whole picture. Your assignment is to report back to the O5 Council on all anomalous events associated with Shibbet\u2019s Vale. Go back as far as you can.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n Am I answering to O5 on this?\n\n\n???:\n You will be reporting to either me, or to another individual empowered to speak on behalf of the O5 Council.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n I guess that\u2019s as close as anyone gets.\n\n\n???:\n The data you find will be Level 5 Classified and collated under the codename \u2018Project Serapis\u2019. Access to other Foundation sites and personnel will be granted to you if the O5 Council deems it necessary. You may have to deal with interests outside the Foundation. Discretion is expected.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n I get it. Do it alone, do it quiet, leave no trace. Just like old times.\n\n\n???:\n The world has changed since you were last out there, but some things will always be the same. Strange things will happen, the Foundation will contain them, and the people who owe us everything will never know.\n\n\nGALLIO:\n And men like me don\u2019t get a choice in the part we play.\n\n\n???:\n The Council will be waiting on your results. Sleep tight.\n\n\n(\nFoootsteps as the individual leaves\n)\n\n\nGALLIO:\n Aren\u2019t you going to wish me good luck?\n\n\n???:\n If you\u2019re relying on luck, agent, you\u2019re in the wrong job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Stop\n\n\n \n\n\nSHOW FILES\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSHOW\u00a0\u2014\u00a0initial_draft_6881_Gallio.pdf\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6881\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvisional Item Number:\n SCP-6881\n\n\nProvisional Object Class:\n Keter\n\n\nLevel 5/SERAPIS\n\n\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake Apesawa, with the headwaters of the Whitetail River in foreground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a pre-containment report into the anomaly hereafter referred to as SCP-6881, in anticipation of subsequent containment or neutralisation efforts to be informed by this report.\n\n\nShould an effort to contain SCP-6881 ensue, the containment area required will be 200 by 15 by 12 metres, and constructed of steel reinforced concrete. Any additional containment procedures depend on further observation of SCP-6881. It may be preferable to contain it on-site and build the containment vessel around it, rather than attempt to bring SCP-6881 to an existing facility.\n\n\nThe investigation into SCP-6881 was precipitated by a report on anomalous events in an area of southern Montana known as Shibbet\u2019s Vale. This forested area is to the south of the Mourning Cloak Mountain Range and includes the Whitetail River, which feeds into and drains from Lake Apesawa. The location has seen some previous use including a campground and skiing resort, but is currently uninhabited. These anomalies were believed to emanate from Lake Apesawa. Mobile Task Force Iota-28, \"Screaming Seabees\", was dispatched to perform field engineering duties under the cover story of a geological survey team looking for natural gas fields. The members of Iota-28 were accompanied by twelve C-Class personnel, several pieces of earth moving equipment, and a small cache of explosives.\n\n\nA channel was dug connecting points of the Whitetail River upstream and downstream of the lake. This caused the lake to be bypassed and gradually drain. MTF Iota-28 remained on station during this process to monitor any further anomalous activity, but reported none. The remains of a six-berth boat were noted when the lake was around seventy percent drained, along with a wrecked pickup truck and large amounts of cut logs from the region\u2019s past logging activities.\n\n\nNineteen days after the draining began, an opening was spotted just above the surface, leading to a cave system under the ground eastwards of the lake. Three days later the water level was low enough to permit entry into the cave system. MTF Iota-28, comprising four members trained in combat engineering, entered the cave. They were: I-28 Alpha \u2014 Urbanek, ranking officer; I-28 Beta\u2014 Lynch; I-28 Delta \u2014 Abbot; and I-28 Gamma \u2014 Weiss. They were accompanied by a C-Class, Lopez, who was trained in caving safety.\n\n\nThe data transmitted from Iota-28 Delta\u2019s field recording device was recovered. Being transmitted from underground, this data was partial and had to be reconstructed, and no other team member\u2019s recordings could be recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHOW\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Iota-28\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0[CLASSIFIED\u00a05/SERAPIS]\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0CLOSE\n\n\n\n\nPortions of the transcript in bold are narrated by \nDR. GALLIO\n.\n\n\n\n\n(The ambient sound of a cave. Water drips somewhere in the back)\n\n\nABBOT:\n OK, this is I-28 Delta, Abbot. Testing, testing. Good, levels are green.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n We all good?\n\n\nLYNCH:\n Recording. Doubt we\u2019ll get a signal out, though.\n\n\nURBANEK::\n Weiss?\n\n\nWEISS:\n Sure, the recording\u2019s on. Hope control gets off on two hours of footsteps.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Don\u2019t start, we haven\u2019t even got our feet wet. Lopez, how\u2019s it looking?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n I\u2019d rather have the gear to rig up lights as we go. Put in some permanent guide lines.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n We don\u2019t have the time. We\u2019re here to find whatever\u2019s down here, not map the place out.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n The rock looks good but if the system goes much lower it\u2019ll be underwater. No way are we equipped for that.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Then we\u2019ll turn back. Until then, we are a go. I want weapons stowed and safetys on, down here you\u2019re more likely to kill one of us with a ricochet than hit anything.\n\n\nWEISS:\n I thought we were looking for something spooky?\n\n\nURBANEK\n And if we have to shoot it then I\u2019ll give the order. Until then, fingers off triggers.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Jesus Christ.\n\n\nLYNCH:\n Remind me why we even bring you?\n\n\nWEISS:\n Because I\u2019m the explosives guy and you couldn\u2019t tell plastique from Play-Doh.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n We looking good, Abbot?\n\n\nABBOT:\n We\u2019re negative for radiation and toxins. Good to go.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n You think we\u2019re gonna run into radiation down here?\n\n\nABBOT:\n We assume we\u2019re gonna run into everything.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Move out. Stick close. Lopez, lead the way.\n\n\n(\nThe team moves into the cave system. I-28 Delta\u2019s recording system was both audio and visual, but no video data could be reconstructed. The team moves slowly and with difficulty, with C-Class Lopez directing them through narrow and partially flooded passageways. They encounter several dead ends. Signal triangulation puts them approximately three hundred metres east of Lake Apesawa and fifteen to thirty metres underground. The cave system descends gradually, prompting concerns the way ahead will be flooded.\n)\n\n\nLYNCH:\n A lot of tree roots down here. Is that normal?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Through solid rock? No.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Oh great, we gotta cut our way through. Not enough we\u2019re underground, we have to be in a bloody jungle too.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Lynch, you\u2019re the muscle. Get this crap out of our way.\n\n\n(\nI-28 Beta presumably pulls out a machete and, from audio, standard issue Containment Handsaw, and begins to cut through the tree roots.\n)\n\n\nWEISS:\n I should just blast a sodding path for us.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n And bring the whole place down on our heads?\n\n\nWEISS:\n Looks solid enough to me.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Then the pressure wave will kill us instead. That\u2019s progress.\n\n\nLYNCH:\n We\u2019re through. Shit, my arm\u2019s all cut to hell though. What is this stuff?\n\n\nABBOT:\n Hey, it opens up just ahead. See? It\u2019s a cavern. Got stalactites and stuff.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Stalagmites.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Which is which again?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Hey, he\u2019s right. This is one beautiful gallery. We got\u2026 we got plants down here. That\u2019s not right. You get animals, bugs and bats, but not plants. There\u2019s no sun.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n So it\u2019s weird?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n It\u2019s weird.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Stalagmites come down from the ceiling. Stalactites are on the ground. Didn\u2019t you go to school?\n\n\nABBOT:\n Nah, I think it\u2019s the other way around. Lynch, which is it? Lynch?\n\n\nLYNCH:\n Guys, I don\u2019t\u2026 I ain\u2019t doing so great.\n\n\n(\nVarious medical sounds: muscle tearing, bone cracking. There is the sound of creaking wood. I-28 Beta cries out.\n)\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Lynch! Lynch, what\u2019s wrong?\n\n\nLYNCH:\n Something inside me. In my chest. Under the ribs.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Abbot, get the med stuff out!\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Oh Jesus, I can see it moving.\n\n\nLYNCH:\n You gotta cut it out. It\u2019s growing.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Do it, Abbot.\n\n\nABBOT:\n OK. Keep as still as you can.\n\n\n(\nI-28 Delta takes the Containment Handsaw and presumably begins emergency field surgery techniques. I-28 Beta cries out again\n)\n\n\nLYNCH:\n Get it out! Get it out!\n\n\nABBOT:\n It\u2019s like\u2026 a fibrous growth. Real tough. It\u2019s tangled around the ribs.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Bloody hell, it\u2019s got my arm!\n\n\n(\nA biological ripping sound as I-28 Gamma rips the \"fibrous growth\". I-28 Beta cries out a third time\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n The lungs are full of it. Lynch? Lynch, you still with us?\n\n\n(\nI-28 Beta produces ragged breathing.\n)\n\n\nURBANEK:\n That\u2019s not survivable. Stand down, Abbot.\n\n\nABBOT:\n We can\u2019t just\u2026\n\n\nURBANEK:\n We can and we will. We got a biological threat and I got standing orders not to mess with that kind of shit. Leave Lynch and keep going.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Aw, hell. The roots are blocking the way back. It would take a bulldozer to open it up. We gotta keep going deeper.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Then that\u2019s what we do. Lopez?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n The cave goes further in. Can\u2019t tell its full extent. I guess we\u2026 we keep in sight of each other and don\u2019t get separated.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Then move out. Abbot, pack up your gear.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Bye, Lynch.\n\n\n(\nThe team continues moving through the large gallery. Lopez finds an opening leading further westwards and the team are again navigating narrow and partially-flooded passageways.\n)\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n We gonna talk about that?\n\n\nABBOT:\n About what?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n We just left someone behind.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Urbanek was right. It didn\u2019t look survivable.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n But Lynch might still be alive.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Not for long. You saw it too, right? Half the chest cavity was full of that stuff. Wood or roots, or whatever.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n I thought you guys were soldiers? Never leave one behind, all that stuff?\n\n\nABBOT:\n That\u2019s regular military. Most of us trained that way but when you get assigned to an MTF, you learn fast how the rules change. The kind of things the Foundation sends us against, sometimes it\u2019s better not to be saved. Plus if we bring a critically wounded soldier or a body back with us, God knows what it might be infected with. Not saying you gotta like it but that\u2019s the way it is. We got priorities more important than lives. Even our own people\u2019s.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n I\u2019m glad I\u2019m a C-Class.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Hate to break it to you, but you\u2019re kind of in the same situation as the rest of us down here.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Would you leave me behind?\n\n\nWEISS:\n I\u2019d watch you die for a piece of chicken.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Screw you.\n\n\nABBOT:\n What the hell, Weiss.\n\n\nWEISS:\n Gallows humour, buddy. We all gotta deal somehow.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n What about those roots, or whatever they are? You seen that before?\n\n\nABBOT:\n Nope. But then that\u2019s what we work with, right? Stuff no one\u2019s seen before?\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Hold up. We got more of those plants up ahead. They ones with the fruit or the seed pods. Lopez, you got any ideas what they are?\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Never seen anything like that growing underground. You get a few mushrooms and fungi, nothing like these.\n\n\nURBANEK:\n Gonna grab one as a sample.\n\n\n(\nI-28 Alpha attempts to remove a seed pod from one of the plants, but it bursts and emits a cloud of spores. I-28 Alpha breathes in these spores before getting clear.\n)\n\n\nWEISS:\n Oh shit.\n\n\n(\nThe sound of I-28 Alpha coughing through a protective mask.\n)\n\n\n(\nThe recording becomes distorted and audio data cannot be reconstructed for the next portion of the mission. I-28 Delta\u2019s location is estimated at five hundred metres west of Lake Apesawa and between thirty and forty metres underground. The next recoverable audio occurs twenty-seven minutes later.\n)\n\n\n(\nThere is the sound of a large animal growling, wetly, and of wood creaking. They get fainter and fainter until they are no longer audible.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n It didn\u2019t see us.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n What the hell is it?\n\n\nABBOT:\n I\u2026think it used to be Urbanek. He breathed in the spores.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Did you see what it did to Weiss? God, the whole face was gone\u2026\n\n\nABBOT:\n Hey, you haven\u2019t been here before, but I have. You think too much about what you just saw and you\u2019ll freeze up. Put it aside and keep going. You can lose your shit over it later, once we\u2019re out.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n We\u2019re underground, man! There\u2019s no magic rule that says there even is a way out!\n\n\nABBOT:\n Doesn\u2019t matter. We keep moving until we find an exit or we die. \u2018Cause the other option is to curl up and wait for whatever that thing is to find us and I\u2019m not about that.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Just follow me. Here, take my sidearm.\n\n\n(\nThe soft clack of a handgun being pulled out and handed over.\n)\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n What am I supposed to do with this?\n\n\nABBOT:\n Shoot the bad guy. Okay, we move. Try not to breathe in the spores.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Try not to breathe. Great.\n\n\n(\nThe remaining two members of the underground team move through the passageways, attempting to do so quietly. The sound of something large moving and breathing in the distance can occasionally be heard. Voice stress and breathing pattern analysis indicate distress, exhaustion and shock.\n)\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Wait. This passage is flooded. We gotta go back.\n\n\nABBOT:\n I don\u2019t think there is a \u2018back\u2019 any more.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Well it\u2019s either that or grow gills.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Looks wide enough to swim through.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n No way. No, no way. Even with a full diving team I\u2019d think twice.\n\n\nABBOT:\n I think\u2026 I think it turns upwards again. Can\u2019t tell how far. Twenty metres, maybe.\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n You can\u2019t judge anything underwater. I know guys who died thinking they could.\n\n\n(\nNearby snuffling sounds and growling, likely from the Urbanek-creature.\n)\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n Oh man, you\u2019re shitting me.\n\n\n(\nRock breaking as the Urbanek-creature crashes into the chamber\n)\n\n\nLOPEZ:\n I\u2019m not dying here! I\u2019m not dying here!\n\n\n(\nThree gunshots. The Urbanek-creature roars. C-Class Lopez screams. There is the sound of teeth crunching into flesh.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n Ah, what the hell.\n\n\n(\nA splash.\n)\n\n\n(\nRushing water from beneath. Abbot groans as he attempts to hold his breath. There is a moment of silence. A splash. Abbot gasps and sputters\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n Holy\u2026 holy shit. Lopez? Lopez?\n\n\n(\nI-28 Delta continues walking for the next thirty-one minutes.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n Okay. This is I-28 Delta, Abbot. I don\u2019t know how long I have to go before I find a way out and I don\u2019t even know if there is one. Urbanek, Weiss and Lynch are gone, and I guess Lopez, too. If anyone is receiving this, I\u2019m turning off recording to save the battery. If I find anything, I\u2019ll transmit again. If not, I\u2019m dead. Sayonara, guys.\n\n\n(\nNo further data is received for approximately nineteen hours. The C-Class engineering support crew carried out a preliminary investigation of the cave entrance but were under orders not to enter the cave without MTF support. They found evidence the MTF had entered the cave but none that anyone had exited. After this period of silence, Iota-28 Delta begins transmitting again.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n This is Iota-28 Delta Abbot. I\u2019m down to the lowest light mode on my flashlight and I have one flare left. I haven\u2019t found an exit, obviously. I think I\u2019m a lot lower than I started out but other than that I got no idea where I am. Caver wisdom is probably to stay put but I know you\u2019re not going to send anyone to find me, even if someone does hear this.\n\n\nABBOT:\n We weren\u2019t the first people down here. I found a skeleton a ways back. It looked like it\u2019s been down here for decades. It was in dark green fatigues. Looked military. There was a name label on the chest that read \u2018Stenforth\u2019. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good omen. Maybe they got lost down here, too. I kind of hope so. Is that weird? I\u2019d rather starve here than run into whatever else might have killed the guy.\n\n\nABBOT:\n There\u2019s a big cave ahead. I don\u2019t know how deep it goes. There are plants everywhere. The ones with the seed pods, and others like huge ferns. Bugs like maggots the size of my forearm and these beetles in all bright colours. It\u2019s humid and close. Way too warm. If there\u2019s anything toxic like those spores from before then I\u2019ve already got lungfuls of it. And there\u2019s a pulse, like something huge breathing. I can\u2019t hear it. It\u2019s more of a feeling, in my head.\n\n\nABBOT:\n Well, here goes.\n\n\n(\nA flare lights.\n)\n\n\n(\nThe audio distorts.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n It\u2019s\u2026 oh my god.\n\n\nABBOT:\n It\u2019s a worm.\n\n\nABBOT:\n It\u2019s the size of the goddamn Red October. It has so many eyes\u2026 so many eyes\u2026\n\n\n(\nThere is a deep rumbling; just the beginning of a large organism moving.\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n Its mouth is opening\u2026\n\n\n(\nThe rumble intensifies\n)\n\n\nABBOT:\n Who the hell are you?\n\n\n(\nThe audio distorts\n)\n\n\n(\nThe transmission is cut off, and does not resume.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHOW\u00a0\u2014\u00a0COMMENTARY\u00a0\u2014\u00a0DR.\u00a0GALLIO:\u00a0Iota-28\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0[CLASSIFIED\u00a05/SERAPIS]\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0CLOSE\n\n\n\n\nGALLIO:\n\n\nAfter forty-eight hours without further communication from the team, the C-Class support personnel sealed the cave entrance with concrete and filled in the channel they had dug, refilling the lake. The site was quarantined. Foundation personnel blocked all access to Lake Apesawa under the cover story of an amoebic meningitis outbreak. These measures are to remain in place until a more permanent containment for SCP-6881 can be put in place.\n\n\nThe name \u2018Stenforth\u2019 does not come up while cross-referencing other Foundation files. There is no record of a military operation into the caves, though there was a military base near the lake in the 1950s. If another organisation investigated the Shibbet\u2019s Vale anomaly, there is no evidence of it except for the skeleton found by Iota-28 Delta.\n\n\nA description of SCP-6881 cannot be given to any degree of accuracy because only a single verbal account of it exists. Going by the final transmission from Iota-28 Delta, SCP-6881 at least partly resembles a worm of enormous size. The last words of Iota-28 Delta, however, imply the presence of another entity, or the transformation of the existing one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITOR, YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL FILE(S) TO VIEW.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nBRAVO\n\u2019 \u2014 1997\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nCHARLIE\n\u2019 \u2014 1992\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nDELTA\n\u2019 \u2014 1986\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nECHO\n\u2019 \u2014 1981\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nFOXTROT\n\u2019 \u2014 1974\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nGOLF\n\u2019 \u2014 1968\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nHOTEL\n\u2019 \u2014 1924\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nINDIA\n\u2019 \u2014 1954\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nJULIETT\n\u2019 \u2014 1933\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nKILO\n\u2019 \u2014 DATES VARY\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT \u2018\nLIMA\n\u2019 \u2014 1923\n\n\n\n\n\u00bb VIEW FILE \u00ab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[FILE SEALED]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6880\n | Project: SERAPIS | \nSCP-6882\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6881\n\" by Ben Counter, Pacific Obadiah, & edited by LordStonefish, Lt Flops, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "( The click of a person's tape recorder being turned off. ) GALLIO: Come in. ( The door opens. There are footsteps on carpet ) ???: Good evening, Agent Gallio. GALLIO: I\u2019m a researcher. I\u2019m not an agent any more. ???: As of forty minutes ago, that is no longer true. GALLIO: I\u2019m being reactivated? ???: I am empowered to speak on behalf of the O5 Council. They have been very appreciative of your sterling work here as a researcher and wish to utilise both those skills, and your experience in the field. You\u2019re already familiar with the case of SCP-6881. Did anything strike you as unusual about it? Other than the obvious, of course. GALLIO: Yeah. The background. The Foundation became interested in Shibbet\u2019s Vale and the lake because of \u2018anomalous activity\u2019 in the area. But there\u2019s nothing in the mission records about what those anomalies were. Kind of strange given that anomalies are what we do. ???: Very perceptive, Agent Gallio. The O5 Council would like those blanks filled in, too. The data we have suggests Shibbet\u2019s Vale has a long history of very strange things but the details appear to have been lost to a computing error. Before we can fully contain SCP-6881, the Foundation needs the whole picture. Your assignment is to report back to the O5 Council on all anomalous events associated with Shibbet\u2019s Vale. Go back as far as you can. GALLIO: Am I answering to O5 on this? ???: You will be reporting to either me, or to another individual empowered to speak on behalf of the O5 Council. GALLIO: I guess that\u2019s as close as anyone gets. ???: The data you find will be Level 5 Classified and collated under the codename \u2018Project Serapis\u2019. Access to other Foundation sites and personnel will be granted to you if the O5 Council deems it necessary. You may have to deal with interests outside the Foundation. Discretion is expected. GALLIO: I get it. Do it alone, do it quiet, leave no trace. Just like old times. ???: The world has changed since you were last out there, but some things will always be the same. Strange things will happen, the Foundation will contain them, and the people who owe us everything will never know. GALLIO: And men like me don\u2019t get a choice in the part we play. ???: The Council will be waiting on your results. Sleep tight. ( Foootsteps as the individual leaves ) GALLIO: Aren\u2019t you going to wish me good luck? ???: If you\u2019re relying on luck, agent, you\u2019re in the wrong job.",
        "(The ambient sound of a cave. Water drips somewhere in the back) ABBOT: OK, this is I-28 Delta, Abbot. Testing, testing. Good, levels are green. URBANEK: We all good? LYNCH: Recording. Doubt we\u2019ll get a signal out, though. URBANEK:: Weiss? WEISS: Sure, the recording\u2019s on. Hope control gets off on two hours of footsteps. URBANEK: Don\u2019t start, we haven\u2019t even got our feet wet. Lopez, how\u2019s it looking? LOPEZ: I\u2019d rather have the gear to rig up lights as we go. Put in some permanent guide lines. URBANEK: We don\u2019t have the time. We\u2019re here to find whatever\u2019s down here, not map the place out. LOPEZ: The rock looks good but if the system goes much lower it\u2019ll be underwater. No way are we equipped for that. URBANEK: Then we\u2019ll turn back. Until then, we are a go. I want weapons stowed and safetys on, down here you\u2019re more likely to kill one of us with a ricochet than hit anything. WEISS: I thought we were looking for something spooky? URBANEK And if we have to shoot it then I\u2019ll give the order. Until then, fingers off triggers. WEISS: Jesus Christ. LYNCH: Remind me why we even bring you? WEISS: Because I\u2019m the explosives guy and you couldn\u2019t tell plastique from Play-Doh. URBANEK: We looking good, Abbot? ABBOT: We\u2019re negative for radiation and toxins. Good to go. LOPEZ: You think we\u2019re gonna run into radiation down here? ABBOT: We assume we\u2019re gonna run into everything. URBANEK: Move out. Stick close. Lopez, lead the way. ( The team moves into the cave system. I-28 Delta\u2019s recording system was both audio and visual, but no video data could be reconstructed. The team moves slowly and with difficulty, with C-Class Lopez directing them through narrow and partially flooded passageways. They encounter several dead ends. Signal triangulation puts them approximately three hundred metres east of Lake Apesawa and fifteen to thirty metres underground. The cave system descends gradually, prompting concerns the way ahead will be flooded. ) LYNCH: A lot of tree roots down here. Is that normal? LOPEZ: Through solid rock? No. WEISS: Oh great, we gotta cut our way through. Not enough we\u2019re underground, we have to be in a bloody jungle too. URBANEK: Lynch, you\u2019re the muscle. Get this crap out of our way. ( I-28 Beta presumably pulls out a machete and, from audio, standard issue Containment Handsaw, and begins to cut through the tree roots. ) WEISS: I should just blast a sodding path for us. LOPEZ: And bring the whole place down on our heads? WEISS: Looks solid enough to me. LOPEZ: Then the pressure wave will kill us instead. That\u2019s progress. LYNCH: We\u2019re through. Shit, my arm\u2019s all cut to hell though. What is this stuff? ABBOT: Hey, it opens up just ahead. See? It\u2019s a cavern. Got stalactites and stuff. WEISS: Stalagmites. ABBOT: Which is which again? LOPEZ: Hey, he\u2019s right. This is one beautiful gallery. We got\u2026 we got plants down here. That\u2019s not right. You get animals, bugs and bats, but not plants. There\u2019s no sun. URBANEK: So it\u2019s weird? LOPEZ: It\u2019s weird. WEISS: Stalagmites come down from the ceiling. Stalactites are on the ground. Didn\u2019t you go to school? ABBOT: Nah, I think it\u2019s the other way around. Lynch, which is it? Lynch? LYNCH: Guys, I don\u2019t\u2026 I ain\u2019t doing so great. ( Various medical sounds: muscle tearing, bone cracking. There is the sound of creaking wood. I-28 Beta cries out. ) URBANEK: Lynch! Lynch, what\u2019s wrong? LYNCH: Something inside me. In my chest. Under the ribs. URBANEK: Abbot, get the med stuff out! LOPEZ: Oh Jesus, I can see it moving. LYNCH: You gotta cut it out. It\u2019s growing. URBANEK: Do it, Abbot. ABBOT: OK. Keep as still as you can. ( I-28 Delta takes the Containment Handsaw and presumably begins emergency field surgery techniques. I-28 Beta cries out again ) LYNCH: Get it out! Get it out! ABBOT: It\u2019s like\u2026 a fibrous growth. Real tough. It\u2019s tangled around the ribs. WEISS: Bloody hell, it\u2019s got my arm! ( A biological ripping sound as I-28 Gamma rips the \"fibrous growth\". I-28 Beta cries out a third time ) ABBOT: The lungs are full of it. Lynch? Lynch, you still with us? ( I-28 Beta produces ragged breathing. ) URBANEK: That\u2019s not survivable. Stand down, Abbot. ABBOT: We can\u2019t just\u2026 URBANEK: We can and we will. We got a biological threat and I got standing orders not to mess with that kind of shit. Leave Lynch and keep going. WEISS: Aw, hell. The roots are blocking the way back. It would take a bulldozer to open it up. We gotta keep going deeper. URBANEK: Then that\u2019s what we do. Lopez? LOPEZ: The cave goes further in. Can\u2019t tell its full extent. I guess we\u2026 we keep in sight of each other and don\u2019t get separated. URBANEK: Then move out. Abbot, pack up your gear. ABBOT: Bye, Lynch. ( The team continues moving through the large gallery. Lopez finds an opening leading further westwards and the team are again navigating narrow and partially-flooded passageways. ) LOPEZ: We gonna talk about that? ABBOT: About what? LOPEZ: We just left someone behind. ABBOT: Urbanek was right. It didn\u2019t look survivable. LOPEZ: But Lynch might still be alive. ABBOT: Not for long. You saw it too, right? Half the chest cavity was full of that stuff. Wood or roots, or whatever. LOPEZ: I thought you guys were soldiers? Never leave one behind, all that stuff? ABBOT: That\u2019s regular military. Most of us trained that way but when you get assigned to an MTF, you learn fast how the rules change. The kind of things the Foundation sends us against, sometimes it\u2019s better not to be saved. Plus if we bring a critically wounded soldier or a body back with us, God knows what it might be infected with. Not saying you gotta like it but that\u2019s the way it is. We got priorities more important than lives. Even our own people\u2019s. LOPEZ: I\u2019m glad I\u2019m a C-Class. WEISS: Hate to break it to you, but you\u2019re kind of in the same situation as the rest of us down here. LOPEZ: Would you leave me behind? WEISS: I\u2019d watch you die for a piece of chicken. LOPEZ: Screw you. ABBOT: What the hell, Weiss. WEISS: Gallows humour, buddy. We all gotta deal somehow. LOPEZ: What about those roots, or whatever they are? You seen that before? ABBOT: Nope. But then that\u2019s what we work with, right? Stuff no one\u2019s seen before? URBANEK: Hold up. We got more of those plants up ahead. They ones with the fruit or the seed pods. Lopez, you got any ideas what they are? LOPEZ: Never seen anything like that growing underground. You get a few mushrooms and fungi, nothing like these. URBANEK: Gonna grab one as a sample. ( I-28 Alpha attempts to remove a seed pod from one of the plants, but it bursts and emits a cloud of spores. I-28 Alpha breathes in these spores before getting clear. ) WEISS: Oh shit. ( The sound of I-28 Alpha coughing through a protective mask. ) ( The recording becomes distorted and audio data cannot be reconstructed for the next portion of the mission. I-28 Delta\u2019s location is estimated at five hundred metres west of Lake Apesawa and between thirty and forty metres underground. The next recoverable audio occurs twenty-seven minutes later. ) ( There is the sound of a large animal growling, wetly, and of wood creaking. They get fainter and fainter until they are no longer audible. ) ABBOT: It didn\u2019t see us. LOPEZ: What the hell is it? ABBOT: I\u2026think it used to be Urbanek. He breathed in the spores. LOPEZ: Did you see what it did to Weiss? God, the whole face was gone\u2026 ABBOT: Hey, you haven\u2019t been here before, but I have. You think too much about what you just saw and you\u2019ll freeze up. Put it aside and keep going. You can lose your shit over it later, once we\u2019re out. LOPEZ: We\u2019re underground, man! There\u2019s no magic rule that says there even is a way out! ABBOT: Doesn\u2019t matter. We keep moving until we find an exit or we die. \u2018Cause the other option is to curl up and wait for whatever that thing is to find us and I\u2019m not about that. LOPEZ: I don\u2019t know if I can do this. ABBOT: Just follow me. Here, take my sidearm. ( The soft clack of a handgun being pulled out and handed over. ) LOPEZ: What am I supposed to do with this? ABBOT: Shoot the bad guy. Okay, we move. Try not to breathe in the spores. LOPEZ: Try not to breathe. Great. ( The remaining two members of the underground team move through the passageways, attempting to do so quietly. The sound of something large moving and breathing in the distance can occasionally be heard. Voice stress and breathing pattern analysis indicate distress, exhaustion and shock. ) LOPEZ: Wait. This passage is flooded. We gotta go back. ABBOT: I don\u2019t think there is a \u2018back\u2019 any more. LOPEZ: Well it\u2019s either that or grow gills. ABBOT: Looks wide enough to swim through. LOPEZ: No way. No, no way. Even with a full diving team I\u2019d think twice. ABBOT: I think\u2026 I think it turns upwards again. Can\u2019t tell how far. Twenty metres, maybe. LOPEZ: You can\u2019t judge anything underwater. I know guys who died thinking they could. ( Nearby snuffling sounds and growling, likely from the Urbanek-creature. ) LOPEZ: Oh man, you\u2019re shitting me. ( Rock breaking as the Urbanek-creature crashes into the chamber ) LOPEZ: I\u2019m not dying here! I\u2019m not dying here! ( Three gunshots. The Urbanek-creature roars. C-Class Lopez screams. There is the sound of teeth crunching into flesh. ) ABBOT: Ah, what the hell. ( A splash. ) ( Rushing water from beneath. Abbot groans as he attempts to hold his breath. There is a moment of silence. A splash. Abbot gasps and sputters ) ABBOT: Holy\u2026 holy shit. Lopez? Lopez? ( I-28 Delta continues walking for the next thirty-one minutes. ) ABBOT: Okay. This is I-28 Delta, Abbot. I don\u2019t know how long I have to go before I find a way out and I don\u2019t even know if there is one. Urbanek, Weiss and Lynch are gone, and I guess Lopez, too. If anyone is receiving this, I\u2019m turning off recording to save the battery. If I find anything, I\u2019ll transmit again. If not, I\u2019m dead. Sayonara, guys. ( No further data is received for approximately nineteen hours. The C-Class engineering support crew carried out a preliminary investigation of the cave entrance but were under orders not to enter the cave without MTF support. They found evidence the MTF had entered the cave but none that anyone had exited. After this period of silence, Iota-28 Delta begins transmitting again. ) ABBOT: This is Iota-28 Delta Abbot. I\u2019m down to the lowest light mode on my flashlight and I have one flare left. I haven\u2019t found an exit, obviously. I think I\u2019m a lot lower than I started out but other than that I got no idea where I am. Caver wisdom is probably to stay put but I know you\u2019re not going to send anyone to find me, even if someone does hear this. ABBOT: We weren\u2019t the first people down here. I found a skeleton a ways back. It looked like it\u2019s been down here for decades. It was in dark green fatigues. Looked military. There was a name label on the chest that read \u2018Stenforth\u2019. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good omen. Maybe they got lost down here, too. I kind of hope so. Is that weird? I\u2019d rather starve here than run into whatever else might have killed the guy. ABBOT: There\u2019s a big cave ahead. I don\u2019t know how deep it goes. There are plants everywhere. The ones with the seed pods, and others like huge ferns. Bugs like maggots the size of my forearm and these beetles in all bright colours. It\u2019s humid and close. Way too warm. If there\u2019s anything toxic like those spores from before then I\u2019ve already got lungfuls of it. And there\u2019s a pulse, like something huge breathing. I can\u2019t hear it. It\u2019s more of a feeling, in my head. ABBOT: Well, here goes. ( A flare lights. ) ( The audio distorts. ) ABBOT: It\u2019s\u2026 oh my god. ABBOT: It\u2019s a worm. ABBOT: It\u2019s the size of the goddamn Red October. It has so many eyes\u2026 so many eyes\u2026 ( There is a deep rumbling; just the beginning of a large organism moving. ) ABBOT: Its mouth is opening\u2026 ( The rumble intensifies ) ABBOT: Who the hell are you?
