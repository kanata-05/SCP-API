Areas deemed possibly affected are to be investigated by RTF-Zeta-27 (\"Homeowners Association\").\n\n\nAny phenomena confimed to be in line with SCP-4575 is to be reported to the Global Occult Coalition, in line with the REACT treaty of 2033.\n\n\nIn the event of a repeat ECCENTRICITY event, containment efforts are to be undertaken in full liaison with the Global Occult Coalition until the cessation of the event, in line with the REACT treaty of 2033. When applicable, SCP units will placed be under the command of GOC units experienced with ECCENTRICITY event conditions.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4575 is an ontokinetic anomaly that occurs during REM sleep. If an individual undergoes SCP-4575, a location which they have an emotional connection to (such as a childhood home) will become an instance of SCP-4575-A. SCP-4575-A experience degradation and damage associated with neglect and improper maintence, including as mold, water damage, flooding, and collapse. Individuals affected by SCP-4575 report a vague sensation of unfamiliarity with associated SCP-4575-A instances, and will eventually abandon the property.\n\n\nGenetic material of an unknown echinoderm species is commonly found in water inside SCP-4575-A instances.\n\n\nSCP-4575 manifestation is connected with hurricane Morgan of 2033, and the associated anomalous phenomena, which are collectively designated an ECCENTRICITY event.\n\n\nThe factors which cause an individual to undergo SCP-4575 events are unknown.\n\n\nAddendum: Supplemental Material\n\n\n\n\nError!

Its related to that house thing that you put me on leave about, i did some digging and i really think that its connected, also to the dream thing that we looked into and also that fifth church group, its all really complex. If i am RIGHT however (and i probably am its all ive been thinking about for the past four months) if you can get into dreams and kill the things that are causing the house thing it should stop Morgan. I dont know how to but its the only way i can think of end the phenomena.\n\n\nI know its hard to take me serious, and this even less.
