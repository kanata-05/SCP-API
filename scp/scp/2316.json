SCP-2316 manifests as a group of human corpses\n1\n floating in a small group at the surface of the water. The identities of these corpses are [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED] \n[Automated Change: UNKNOWN]\n, though DNA testing has been inconclusive.\n\n\nWhile SCP-2316 appears to be individual instances, it is theorized that SCP-2316 may instead be an entity composed of a collective consciousness. Individual instances of SCP-2316 do not act on their own, but do seem to be able to act collectively as a\n2\n single unit. The individual instances of SCP-2316 are\n3\n unrecognizable, and you do not recognize the bodies in the water.\n\n\nSCP-2316 hosts a powerful cognitohazardous effect, causing those who have viewed SCP-2316, are aware of certain parts of its nature, or who were enrolled in the [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED] \n[Automated Message: INVALID]\n to believe that the individual instances of SCP-2316 are human beings they recognize, typically from their childhood\n4\n.\n\n\nAttempting to come into contact with SCP-2316 instances, by way of entering Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 or touching an instance of SCP-2316, will cause other instances of SCP-2316 to appear. You do not recognize the bodies in the water. The additional instances only serve to reinforce and add to the strength of the cognitohazard\n5\n, compelling affected individuals into the lake. Individuals who enter the lake in this way are lost, and to date none have been recovered.\n\n\nAddendum 2316.1:\n Interview\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYou\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0this.\u00a0They\u00a0were\u00a0your\u00a0friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERROR: UNRECOGNIZED USER.
