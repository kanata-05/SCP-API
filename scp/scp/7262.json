Due to the nature of the anomaly, SCP-7262 has been permitted to wear a short sleeve t-shirt and athletic shorts for ease of documentation.\n\n\nWithin its first week at the Foundation, SCP-7262 requested the following items:\n\n\n\n\nA television - \nApproved\n\n\nA Nintendo switch - \nPending\n\n\nA selection of books - \nApproved\n\n\nAccess to social media - \nDenied\n\n\nAccess to only Discord - \nDenied\n\n\nAn art tablet - \nPending\n\n\nTraditional art supplies - \nApproved\n1\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7262 is permitted to submit requests for items, which are subject for approval depending on their nature. SCP-7262 is not to be permitted access to any items it could use to potentially harm itself.\n\n\nSCP-7262 is to be administered Quetiapine, Fluvaxomine, and Bupropion on a regular basis by its medical team. Requested augments to this regimen are to be reviewed by Site-264's medical staff.\n\n\nSCP-7262 is to have weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Kenneth Hart. As SCP-7262's mental state is linked with its anomalous properties, staff are to refrain from relaying upsetting information to SCP-7262 unless deemed absolutely necessary. Failure to do so may trigger its anomalous properties. Additionally, usage of SCP-7262's preferred name and pronouns is recommended when interacting with it.\n\n\nEdit as of 05/11/2022:\n Due to SCP-7262's aversion to eating as a result of its poor mental state, culinary staff have been notified to provide meals that it has expressed favoritism towards in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork SCP-7262 drew during its second week in containment.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7262 is a 24-year-old non-binary human formerly identified as Jonathan \"Gutz\" Everett. When in a heightened emotional state, SCP-7262\u2019s body will undergo multiple physiological changes that would typically result in death. These changes typically entail damage to the structure and function of joints, ligaments, and tendons, as well as complex fractures. Organ damage, internal bleeding, and gross distension of limbs, trunk, and head are also common.\n\n\nDuplication or disappearance of organs and bodily fluids has also been observed. It is also typical for bodily fluids to become discolored or to be replaced with various beverages. However, this damage does not appear to cause SCP-7262 any emotional distress or discomfort. For a list of documented alterations, see \nSCP-7262 Alteration Log\n. When SCP-7262 returns to its emotional baseline, all of the damages will reverse with no complications.\n\n\nIt has been noted that SCP-7262's medical records prior containment indicate that it had recently sustained three broken ribs, a broken arm, and a broken nose. When discovered, no proof of this injury was present, leading to the conclusion that SCP-7262's anomalous properties reset any non-anomalous injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7262 was discovered on 04/16/2022 when it called emergency services upon observing its anomalous properties.

That is what you\u2019ll be known as, for clarification.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Oh, cool.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n \u2018Cool\u2019?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Yeah. That\u2019s cool. Just \u20187262\u2019 would do. But yeah. That\u2019s a cool name.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I have to admit, I\u2019ve seen a lot of sapient anomalies and not one of them thought their SCP designation was cool.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[shrugs]\n What can I say? I like that better than my deadname. If I had to chose the name you people called me, it would be Gutz. Cause that\u2019s my name. But, the number is like\u2026 a cool nickname.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n \u2018Deadname\u2019. Are you gender non-conforming?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Yeah. I\u2019m non-binary. I\u2019m still like, super confused about all of this, but it makes me really happy that you asked. You guys are cool with that, right?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I\u2019m personally fine with it. In general here, your identity doesn\u2019t really matter to us since we\u2019re not going to be addressing it.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Cool with me! \n[smiles]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n How are you feeling right now?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Weird. I\u2019m\u2026 feeling a lot of emotions\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 super confused. Why is this happening?\n\n\n[Multiple disembodied eyes with pink and purple irises as well as black scleras\n3\n materialized around its body. These eyes began to produce cyan blue tears. As this occurred, its eyes took on the same appearance.]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I was next going to ask how you noticed the first manifestation. How did it feel? Did you feel anything just now?\n\n\n[SCP-7262 lifted its arms, pulling up its sleeves.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Ah- it happened again! This one is uh, less freaky somehow. I\u2019m not literally missing organs. I don\u2019t think. And uh, no. I didn't feel anything.\n\n\n[SCP-7262 smooths its fingers under one of the eyes on its arm, causing the eye to blink.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Freaky.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Pull up your jumpsuit leg.\n\n\n[SCP-7262 does as instructed.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n God, it seems they\u2019re everywhere.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Is your vision affected?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n No. I can see just fine. I- this is what it was like last time! I was uh\u2026 going through it. And suddenly, the pillow I was hugging caved into my stomach. I lifted my hoodie, and I saw it.\n\n\n[SCP-7262's calm smile fades.]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Can you see out of those other eyes?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n No. I can feel the tears against my skin, though. This is so weird\u2026\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I see. \n[writes something down]\n SCP-7262, we noticed that on a private account of yours, you draw artworks containing people in similar situations to your anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Oh, yeah. Uh, pastel gore, aesthetic gore art work. It\u2019s kinda how I get out my feelings when times are tough. Instead of um, gouging out my organs, I draw characters gouging out their organs. It\u2019s calming.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I see. That\u2019s definitely something we will be looking into.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[laughs]\n It\u2019s not like, an anomaly or whatever. Many people draw it.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Yes, but there\u2019s a reason that your artwork started to reflect in real life. That\u2019s definitely not a coincidence.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n I suppose it isn\u2019t.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Yes, and your recent artworks depict characters that look like you.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[pause]\n So?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n It was just an observation.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[pause]\n It's weird you guys are just okay with me. Being\u2026 how I am. I know I have a lot of problems\u2026 mental, physical, and now uh\u2026 this. And I'm also just\u2026 really anxious being here. I know that- I don't really know anything about this place. I just want to go home.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Well, the whole reason you're here is so we can help you with your anomaly. We see all sorts of people in situations like yours. We can help you with your other issues, too. We promise.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[pause]\n You\u2019ve got a scar on your face that seems kinda shiny.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n A-Ah, yes.\n\n\n[Dr. Diamond smooths his index finger over his scar.]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n There are crystal pieces imbedded in it.

A pink substance, later identified to be SCP-7262's blood, seeps through its clothing and stains its hand. SCP-7262 then performs a pulling motion, revealing a human heart colored similarly to SCP-7262's blood. SCP-7262 looks to Dr. Diamond. He notes seeing SCP-7262's iris shift color to match its blood, as well as having a misshapen pupil which Dr. Diamond described as 'heart-shaped'.

SCP-7262 should not be interviewed until this happens. I also recommend that it be allowed a t-shirt and shorts due to the nature of its anomaly. Cataloguing changes will be easier that way. - Dr. Diamond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week of SCP-7262's entrance into the Foundation, a thorough psychological evaluation was conducted on SCP-7262 by Dr. Hart. The following are the results.\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-7262's anomaly appears to be triggered when it enters a heightened emotional state, primarily negative emotions. SCP-7262 has the following diagnostics on file:\n\n\n\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not an exhaustive list, the following behaviors have been observed:\n\n\n\n\nPoor self esteem;\n\n\nSelf defeating and harming behaviors;\n\n\nSuicidal ideation;\n\n\nPanic and anxiety attacks with no external trigger;\n\n\nExtreme emotional swings;\n\n\nDissociation;\n\n\nReliance on social media;\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7262 has been kept on its previously prescribed medications to attempt to alleviate its symptoms.\n\n\nAdditionally, SCP-7262 appeared incredibly distressed by the fact that it would not be allowed to contact any one from the outside world for the entirety of its time in containment. In response, its anomalous effect has been rapidly activating multiple times a day. Attempts to alleviate this stress in other ways are currently being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was decided that as SCP-7262's mindset appears to play an integral part in its anomaly's function, research is to be done into its past relations and interactions.\n\n\nThe following will be split into three separate addenda:\n\n\nAddendum 2-A: In-person Relations\n4\n\nAddendum 2-B: Interpersonal Relations\n\nAddendum 2-C: Familial Relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2-A: In-Person Relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation psychologist Dr. Kenneth Hart reached out to a collection of persons that SCP-7262 has known within recent years for further information about SCP-7262. All interviewees were told that SCP-7262 is a missing person.\n\n\nAlthough many interviews revealed similar information, below are relevant portions of these interviews that revealed unique information. During the interviews, SCP-7262 was referred to with masculine honorifics. The transcripts have been altered to reflect its identity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewed: Dylan Bray (former friend)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n You only knew [Mx.] Everett for a few years, then?\n\n\nMr. Bray:\n Yep. We weren't best friends or anything, but I got along with him fine. First few years of high school. I don't think I could tell you anything about why he'd be missing.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Well, any information is helpful. What type of person was he back then?\n\n\nMr. Bray:\n Less weird. He made more efforts to actually interact with the other guys in his grade.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n What does that mean?\n\n\nMr. Bray:\n It means what I said it means. I kinda stopped associating once he started identifying as \"non-binary\" or whatever. I thought only girls subscribed to that shit. He started focusing more on school then, anyway.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewed: Alan Ryan (college peer)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n When did [Mx.] Everett\u2019s activity begin to dwindle?\n\n\nMr. Ryan:\n First semester, third year. His first and mostly second year, he was one of the club\u2019s most active and hard working members. But, he came back the next year different. I think it was stress. He had his first seizure during the club, his health issues probably took a toll on him. He eventually just stopped showing up all together. Which is a shame, he\u2019s a really talented artist. I wonder what he\u2019s doing now. Besides uh, being missing.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see. So you think he began to miss because of his health issues?\n\n\nMr. Ryan:\n That, and something else. Even before his seizures started that next year, he was different. I could tell something else was going on. His health issues didn't help.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Physical health issues tend to induce mental health issues. If I'm right, he already had mental health issues, which was probably rather tough on him.\n\n\nMr. Ryan:\n Yeah\u2026 I felt bad for him.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n What types of artwork did [Mx.] Everett do? Do you still have any of his club assignments?\n\n\nMr. Ryan:\n Oh, I have a few. But obviously not with me. He did these really fun cartoony-style human drawings. He did this one piece with tons of colors and a figure with their head coming off. It was an assignment for a piece based on personal experience. It's the last illustration he submitted before his activity began to fully tank.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see.\n\n\nMr. Ryan:\n Yeah. Like I said, he was a real talent. I \u2026 I hope you guys find him.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterviewed: Xander Wells (current friend)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Wells:\n We\u2026 last met in person a few months ago. Their car got totaled early last month, so they haven't been able to go too many places. It has had to uber if he really needs it, but knowing him, he's primarily stayed in its house. Ordering things to the house. I offered to go to his place, or pick him up and drive to mine, or just be the one that drives us around, but he turned me down.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Why do you think that is?\n\n\nMr. Wells:\n Poor thing suffers from a boatload of issues. They assumed that I'd see it as a burden that he doesn't want to do the driving. I tried to insist, but he wasn't hearing it. I've been really worried about its mental state.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Expand on that.\n\n\nMr. Wells:\n He\u2019s been withdrawing from social stuff. We\u2019re in this Discord server together. They've been talking more in the vent channel. I messaged him about it privately, and it dodges the questions. They\u2019ve said some really concerning things.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Like?\n\n\nMr. Wells:\n \u201cIt would be easier if I could just disappear\u201d. \u201cI wish I could scoop out my insides\u201d. \u201cI feel like cutting my arms into pieces\u201d. Stuff like that. He does gore art work, and it\u2019s beautiful. Usually he just draws his OCs- his characters. But recently the character they\u2019ve been drawing looks like them.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see. So he\u2019s been expressing the urge to hurt himself?\n\n\nMr. Wells:\n \n[Nods]\n Yeah. I\u2026 I really miss him. I hope he\u2019s alive. I\u2026 I need him to be alive.\n\n\nNOTICE:\n Mr. Wells discord profile has been identified as user \ntelecryptid\n nicknamed \n\ud83d\udcfaLocal TV Man\ud83d\udcfa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2-B: Interpersonal Relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch indicates that in recent years, SCP-7262 had more online relationships than in person. Below are transcripts of conversations and posts on social media deemed relevant.\n\n\nFor reference, the following are SCP-7262 accounts on each platform:\n\n\nDiscord - gl1tt3rygutz - nicknamed <- Full of strawberries\n\nPrivate Instagram - mrdrmenowplz\n\n\n\n\nServer\n5\n: cool queer cats\n\nChannel: #general\n\nDate: 01/09/2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbees\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:02\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nSup everyone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:03\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:03\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nHi!!!\n\nOh yay, PKs\n6\n working! it wasn't earlier (\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:04\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nIt happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:04\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nGUTZ!!!!!\n\n(\u3064\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\u3064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:04\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nHey Ayame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:04\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nHi! how are you doing, friend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:04\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nlol\n\nim doing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2655 \u15ea\u1587E\u15e9\u15f0 \u146d\u1587I\u144e\u1455E \u2655\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:05\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nHey Gutz.\n\nWhere\u2019ve you been?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:05\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nAround\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2655 \u15ea\u1587E\u15e9\u15f0 \u146d\u1587I\u144e\u1455E \u2655\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:05\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nSpecific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:05\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nLmao\n\nWell, what\u2019s up everyone\n\nI\u2019ll catch up while I\u2019m here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:06\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nMai had her puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:06\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nOMG\n\nPUPPIES\n\nYOU HAVE YO SEND PICTURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd90\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:06\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nI already did silly\n\nIn \n#animalssss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:07\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nWell Flower probably saw them, but I didn't!\n\n\uff61\uff9f(\u0b87 \u2038 \u0b87\u273f)\uff9f\uff61\n\nOMG\n\nSO CUTE\uff08\uff61>\u203f\u203f<\uff61 \uff09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:07\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nCool\n\nThey\u2019re cute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfaLocal TV Man\ud83d\udcfa\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:07\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nGutz\n\n!!!!\n\nYou\u2019re here!\n\nAnd you changed your avatar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:07\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nYep\n\nWhy are you all so surprised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbees\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:08\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nI mean, it has been a few weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<- Full of Strawberries\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:08\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not that long\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf53\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n01/09/2022\u00a05:08\u00a0pm\n\n\n\n\nYes it is!

It was discovered that SCP-7262 was raised by its father Robert Everett with its mother Jane Everett absent. It was raised alongside its older brother Aaron Everett.\n\n\nSCP-7262\u2019s father refused further interrogation claiming he wanted nothing to do with SCP-7262. Fortunately, it\u2019s brother agreed to participate in questioning about SCP-7262. The resulting interview is documented below.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Open\u00a0Interview\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWED:\n Aaron Everett\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Hart\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Hello, Mr. Everett. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n No problem. I- it's been a bit since I've talked to Jon. I can't believe he's missing. I have no idea where he could've gone. Besides, you know. \n[hesitates]\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Yes?\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n The afterlife. It would make sense if he just\u2026 couldn't take it one day.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see. Mr. Everett, is there anything going on in your brother's life that you think would cause him to attempt serious harm to himself?\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n I mean, he has BPD. Everything makes him think that way. But, in particular\u2026 \n[hesitates]\n He called dad asking for money. Jon \nnever\n asks dad for help. Dad told him to meet in person, so he ubered over there despite being broke. He must have been super desperate. I don't really know how the conversation went. But it didn't end in any money lent. That's all I know.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n I see. What type of relationship does your brother have with your father?\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n They don't have one. Not now, anyway. Dad kicked him out of the house for being non-binary the second he turned 18. Literally, he woke him up at two in the morning and said he had twenty minutes to gather his belongings.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n That's terrible. Where did he go?\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n He stayed with a friend until I moved out just a few months after. Then, he stayed with me until I helped with the funds for him to go to college. I-I don't know that much about his identity and stuff, but he's always gonna be my brother- er, I don't know what term he prefers. Anyway, I'll always care for him. I do my best to help him out. But, his recent financial troubles have been getting at him. He\u2026 he doesn't ask for help. I had to beg him to take the ride to college. Whatever happened made him desperate enough to ask dad.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Are you still in regular contact with your father?\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n No. Dad never officially cut me off or anything, but I kinda strayed from dealing with him as time went on. Because he's\u2026\n\n\n[Mr. Everett points to his head with his index finger pointing outwards, moving his wrist in a circular motion.]\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n I'm tempted to ask what happened. To ask my dad. But he'd probably give me some twisted version of the story. Jesus. I'd never forgive my dad if he's the reason I'll never see my brother again. I-I know he was on the ledge a lot\u2026 \n[sighs]\n this is all so nightmarish.\n\n\nDr. Hart:\n Thank you for your time. You'll be updated if we have any updates.\n\n\nMr. Everett:\n Thanks. I'd do anything to just ensure that he's safe.

This interview took place in SCP-7262's containment unit. The objective of this interview was to learn SCP-7262's perspective newly learned information.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n[Dr. Diamond enters SCP-7262's containment unit carrying a dinner tray.]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Evening, 7262. I was asked to give you your dinner since I was scheduled to come in here anyway.\n\n\n[Dr. Diamond sets the tray on the beside table.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n \n[quietly]\n I'm not hungry.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n You need to eat. How are you feeling?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n The same. The same as every other day. I don't want to be here anymore.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Well, I'm really sorry about that. But, we can't release you. It could be dangerous with an anomaly as unpredictable as yours.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n This fucking sucks. I just- \n[trails off]\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Well, I have some questions to ask you. We noticed while looking through your socials-\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n You went through my messages?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n We needed to find any information that could help us find what events may have lead to why your anomaly manifested. We've noticed a topic that was mentioned a lot was your relationship with your father. And an alleged conversation that took place the day before your anomaly manifested. Could you elaborate on what happened?\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n I don't want to talk about what happened.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Alright, you don't have to. Next, I wanted to ask about your friends.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n My friends? You mean the ones you're letting think I'm dead?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n That's still being discussed. You seemed to grow distant from them, particularly in the last few months.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n So?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n It was clear that they cared a lot about you. They all seemed really worried about your mental decline.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n I was just being a bother. They shouldn't have worried so much.\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n I\u2026 see. Specifically, I wanted to ask you about your relationship with Xander Wells.\n\n\n[SCP-7262 visibly flinches. It crosses its arms, turning its head away from Dr. Diamond.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n What about him?\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n From our research, he appears to care a lot about you.\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Yeah. He does. I\u2026 I care a lot about him, too. \n[mutters something]\n\n\n[SCP-7262 was quiet for a moment.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Why do you care? You're never gonna let me see any of them again. I'll never see them, I'll never see him!\n\n\n[SCP-7262's voice raises.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Why did this have to happen to me? My dad always said people had to walk around eggshells on me, that I complain too much! So I try to not ask for help. The one time I asked for help it leads to this fucking mess!\n\n\nDr. Diamond:\n Take a few deep breaths, 7262. It's going to-\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Be okay? Fuck off with that bullshit!\n\n\n[SCP-7262 begins to cough, coughing up a lime green liquid. The skin and fabric on its throat and chest begins to decay, revealing its bones, which were wrapped in snapdragon flowers. Lime-green tears flow down its cheeks.]\n\n\nSCP-7262:\n Nothing is ever gonna be okay again! This is fucking miserable!
