Foundation staff should be aware of their surroundings when viewing SCP-6777's stream. Viewing SCP-6777's stream outside the designated area is unallowed. Criticism of SCP-6777 to reduce the number of subscribers is encouraged.\n\n\nIf SCP-6777's manifestation in the real world is confirmed, \nDepartment of Tactical Theology and Mobile Task Force Eta-77 (\"Spheres Within Spheres\")\n will be in charge of the suppression and containment of SCP-6777.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6777 is an entity that performs virtual YouTuber\n1\n activities under the name \"Ichifuji Bakuu (\u4e00\u5bcc\u58eb\u3070\u304f\u3045)\". To date, SCP-6777 has created a total of 23 accounts, including ones which are publicly known such as YouTube channel, Twitter and Steam. However, none of these accounts have provided sufficient information which could be used to discover SCP-6777's identity.\n\n\nSCP-6777 is a Level-4-or-higher \nPistiphage Entity\n, and its interference with reality expands in proportion to the number of fans who show a strong liking for it. It is believed that this effect is strengthened the more fans actually take action, and it has been found that it is greatly influenced by the number of subscribers to SCP-6777's YouTube channel.\n\n\nThe following are some of the examples of SCP-6777's interference in reality that have been confirmed so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference by SCP-6777\n\n\nCorresponding subscribers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated Twitter account\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated a YouTube channel\n\n\n0 (Twitter followers were 128 at the time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated a Steam account\n\n\n135\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference with deletion of each account\n\n\n~Approx. 300,000 (Details unknown)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference with fans' dreams, manifestation\n\n\nApprox. 300,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of Japanese nationality (Deletion via Foundation interference was possible)\n\n\nApprox. 660,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of Japanese nationality (Deletion via Foundation interference is impossible)\n\n\nApprox. 820,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above speculation, as well as SCP-6777's own statements in the past, the SCP-6777 research team speculates that SCP-6777 will be able to manifest within reality when the number of subscribers to SCP-6777's YouTube channel exceeds one million. At this time, based on the past \nmanifestation pattern 2576\n, one of the following scenarios are assumed to occur.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6777 appears in the real world as an entity that looks very similar to its virtual form. It doesn't have any abnormal abilities, and can be quickly secured in some cases. (The best possible scenario in the case of Pistiphage Level 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6777 appears in the real world as an entity that is roughly similar to its appearance in the stream, or as an entity that is completely different in appearance, capturing only its features. It is highly likely that it will possess meme-contaminating capabilities. (The most likely scenario to occur in the case of Pistiphage Level 4~6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appearance of SCP-6777 (in any form) causes an immediate HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario. (Worst possible scenario for Pistiphage Level 7 or higher. However, based on SCP-6777's own behavior and other factors, the probability of this scenario occurring is estimated to be extremely low).\n\n\n\n\nSee \nDocument 6777-SNR\n for details of all scenarios.\n\n\nSCP-6777 has been active as a virtual YouTuber on the Internet under the name \"The Hungry Baku God (\u7a7a\u8179\u306a\u308b\u8c98\u306e\u795e)\" since before the discovery of its abnormality. In particular, SCP-6777's eccentricities such as Simultaneous performance of piano playing and singing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, five times in a row in a single online streaming, and making abnormal screeching sounds when it got excited, which triggered a lot of attention on the Internet. An investigation by the foundation reported that no abnormalities such as psychological effects were found in its activities as a virtual YouTuber.\n\n\nThe fact that SCP-6777 is an anomaly was discovered after SCP-6777 enacted a celebrating stream about that the number of channel subscribers exceeded 300,000. From that night to two mornings later, a number of SCP-6777 fans, including 36 Foundation employees, reported that Bakuu had appeared in their dreams and thanked them directly. The affected Foundation staff is currently under observation.\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with one of the researchers who claimed that SCP-6777 appeared in his dream.\n\n\nInterview Log 6777-3\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Seimei\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Researcher Muranoi\n\n\nInterviewed in:\n Site-8171\n\n\nNote:\n This interview was conducted before detailed information about SCP-6777's anomalous properties were known, and the numbering had not yet been done. The interview was conducted in Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0Now, please explain the dream you had.\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0Well, far as I can remember, I found myself in the middle of the scramble crossing in Shibuya. I guess that's where the dream started. The sky was full of stars, but it was as bright as daytime, and there were many orbs floating around me.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0So you didn't just suddenly see Ichifuji Bakuu?\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0Yes, she appeared some time after the dream started.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0I see. Please continue.\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0When I was looking around, I suddenly saw a light in front of me, and Bakuu appeared. As soon as I saw her, she immediately guessed my handle and thanked me for supporting her and gave me a hug. \n(Laughs)\n. I've never had a girl do that to me before\u2026\u2026\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0Uh, yes. Is that all?\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0No, and then some. She moved nimbly around the area, gouging out buildings and eating them, and, swallowing orbs. She said, that it's not enough to interfere with my life, and, it'll be back to normal after a while. I wonder if she's done something dangerous. Nothing has changed for now though.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0That's what we'll have to determine with the follow-up, for now. Anything else?\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0She talked about her future prospects. She said \"everything is free in dreams,\" but \"they are ephemeral, disappearing as soon as they are forgotten.\" So, she said with enthusiasm that she would increase the number of subscribers and show them that one day she would become real. When she finished saying that, she said she had to go visit her other fans and said goodbye to me. I said goodbye too, and that's when I woke up from my dream.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0Thank you very much. Do you have any questions?\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0Well, if you're asking me this much, is it still a given that Bakuu-san, that Ichih Fuji Bakuu, is an abnormal being?\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0I can't say definitively yet, but if there are many similar reports from all over the world, I think it is certain that it will be assigned an official number as an SCP object.\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n \n(Silence)\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n I know how you feel.\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0\u2026\u2026Thank you. I was still shocked to find out that my fave was a subject to contain. I had been supporting her by buying her goods. \u2026\u2026I have no more questions.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0Certainly. The goods will be sent for inspection due to the possibility of an abnormality, and you will be temporarily removed from all duties, also, you will be monitored for a while.\n\n\nResearcher Muranoi:\n\u00a0OK. I will endure as a Foundation employee for now.\n\n\nDr. Seimei:\n\u00a0This interview is concluded.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nEnd Report:\n No anomalous effects have been confirmed for the group of merchandises with the SCP-6777 motif, as well as for Researcher Muranoi and Dr. Seimei. Also, due to the claims of other researchers and civilians, all of the above statements described by Researcher Muranoi are considered to be true.
