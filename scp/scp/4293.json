Records of its courses and speeds should be catalogued.\n\n\nNon-Foundation vessels\n must remain \nwithin 3,500 metres of sea-level while with\nin the \nHellenic Trench\n region. All \nvessels\n attempting to\n, or successfully,\n surpass \na depth of 3,\n50\n0\n metres must be apprehended, questioned \nand amnestised, if recoverable\n. Lethal force is permitted \nif vessels resist apprehension\n.\n\n\nAll manned Foundation vessels must remain above 4,000 metres below surface at all times while within the Hellenic Trench region.\n All \nmanned\n Foundation \nvessels\n must remain \nat least 20\u00a0km\n away from SCP-\n3924\n at all times. \n(See: Addendum III.)\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-\n3924\n is \na\n mobile\n, submersible object that roams the hadal zone of the Hellenic Trench region\n. SCP-\n3924\n typically moves at 4\n0\n km/h and at depths of 4,45\n0 to 4,980\n metres below surface, but is capable of \nreaching speeds of \n55\n 33\n7\n km/h\n1\n and depths of 5,250 metres\n. In all encounters, SCP-\n3924\n has evaded \nvisual\n observation\n; because of this, its approximate physical appearance is only known through sonar imaging (Depicted above)\n.\n\n\nSCP-3924 perpetually emits an indeterminate sound, depending on its current \u201cstate\u201d; although the sonics change depending on whether or not SCP-3924 is passively roaming or actively engaged in battle, \nat no point does SCP-3924 cease emitting noise\n. (See: Addendum III.) Because of SCP-3924\u2019s normal depth, these sound are heavily distorted due to seawater; ongoing audio analysis has identified an ongoing rhythm between the various sounds, suggesting they may be musical in nature. To date, no patterns typical of vocalisations have yet been identified.\n\n\nWhenever \na vessel approaches a depth of 4,100 metres below surface while within the Hellenic Trench region,\n SCP-\n3924\n enters an active state, \nimmediately changing course to intercept and broadcasting an alternate audio signature (unique to this state) directly at the encroaching vessel. This will continue until the vessel rises above a varying depth.\n2\n\n\nIf the offending vessel dives below 4,100 metres,\n SCP-\n3924\n becomes hostile and will attack \nby use of incendiary torpedoes and/or rising mines\n; SCP-\n3924\n will become increasingly aggressive in tactics \nthe longer the vessel is below the 4,100 metre threshold, the deeper it gets, and\n the more aggressive the \nvessel becomes in\n retaliation \n(if at all)\n. SCP-\n3924\n will continue attacking until \nthe encroaching vessel either rises above 4,100 metres below surface, or is\n catastrophically destroyed; \ndue to the fact SCP-3924\u2019s primary strategy\n appears to be focused upon \nrupturing ballast tanks,\n the \nlatter is the most common\n outcome. If \na vessel\n rises above \nthe\n 4,\n1\n00-metre \nthreshold\n, SCP-\n3924\n will immediately cease \nattacking, but will remain in an\n active state \nuntil the vessel rises above a \u201csufficient\u201d depth\n.\n\n\nSCP-3924 periodically enters an active/hostile state in the absence of any encroaching vessels; in all such cases, SCP-3924 appears to broadcast, and attack, an indeterminate object/entity between it and the seafloor. To date, sonar has failed to detect any such objects/entities.\n\n\nAddendum I:\n \nIncident 3924-A\n\n\nOn \nJanuary 9,\n 2018, \nSCP-3924 entered a hostile state and began firing munitions towards the seabed. During this time,\n a \npre-prepared and un\nman\nned submersible\n was deployed \nseveral hundred kilometres away\n in an attempt to reach \nthe Hellenic Trench seafloor while\n SCP-\n3924\n \nwas preoccupied\n.\n\n\nOnce the submersible passed the 4,100-metre threshold, SCP-3924 immediately began firing torpedoes in its direction, despite showing no awareness of the submersible beforehand. SCP-3924 made no attempts to intercept the submersible, apparently prioritising the unseen threat below it.\n\n\nAfter thirteen minutes, SCP-\n3924\n \nceased firing towards the seafloor and\n immediately changed course to intercept \nthe submersible (which had reached a depth of 4,954 metres). SCP-3924 rapidly accelerated to 337\u00a0km/h\n, reaching \nthe submersible\n within several minutes and destroying it \u2014 \nsonar\n observation detected portions of SCP-\n3924\u2019s\n \nhull\n shedding during this \nmanoeuvre\n.\n\n\nSCP-\n3924\n then ascended to a depth of 4,50\n0\n metres \nand began deploying rising mines in an attempt\n to damage \nor sink ships at\n the \nsea\u2019s\n surface; [DATA REDACTED], [DATA REDACTED] \nand\n [DATA REDACTED] \nwere\n critically damaged \nand sunk\n. SCP-\n3924\n remained aggressive \nto surface vessels\n for \na further\n three hours, after which it resumed normal behaviour. To date, this is the only time SCP-\n3924\n has attacked \nvessels\n outside \nof\n its active zone.\n\n\nFurther attempts to surpass the 4,100 metre threshold are strictly forbidden.\n\n\nAddendum II:\n Incident \n3924-B\n\n\nOn \nApril 3,\n 2018, SCP-\n3924\n \nagain entered a hostile state in response to an undetected threat. Unlike previous renditions, SCP-3924 continuously fired towards the seafloor for 334 consecutive hours\n3\n, during which it\n progressively descended to a depth of 5,250 metres.\n\n\nOn April 17, SCP-3924 ceased firing and began broadcasting a previously unrecorded audio signature in all directions;\n three minutes later, SCP-\n3924\n \nrapidly descended towards the seafloor, but\n disappeared from sonar detection \nimmediately prior to impact\n.\n\n\nAttempts to locate SCP-\n3924\n \nor its wreckage throughout the Hellenic Trench\n, either through sonar or visual detection, \nare currently ongoing, but\n are thus far inconclusive.\n\n\nSCP-\n3924\n tentatively reclassified Uncontained/Neutralised.\n\n\nAddendum III:\n Incident \n3924-C\n\n\nOn \nApril 20,\n 2018, SCP-\n3924\n was detected \nby sonar within the Calypso Deep region of the Hellenic Trench,\n approximately 7\n5\n km from where it disappeared. \nSonar imaging shows that SCP-3924 appears to have suffered catastrophic rupturing of most, if not all, ballast tanks, but is attempting to ascend under (assumed) thruster propulsion alone.\n Since reappearance, SCP-3924\u2019s behaviour has drastically changed\n; SCP-3924 will only respond to vessels within a 15\u00a0km radius, which it will aggressively fire upon, and SCP-3924 no longer produces any detectable audio\n.\n\n\nSCP-3924, at its current heading and speed, is estimated to return to its regular roaming zone by 23 March, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-\n2493\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures \n(Revision 2)\n:\n SCP-\n2493-1\n is to be kept at \nLunar Area-32 or at\n its designated containment chamber \nlocated 100km away, accessible by high-speed rail\n. SCP-\n2493-1\n is to \nwear SCP-2493-2 whenever outside their designated containment chamber, and is to\n be restricted from attempting to leave their chamber \nuntil it is ensured SCP-2493-2 is correctly secured\n. \nSCP-2493-1 is to be provided with three meals each day, transmuted into antimatter by use of designated devices received from 2493\u2019. (See Addendum 3.)\n\n\nSCP-\n2493-1\n is to be psychologically evaluated twice weekly, and medication to be administered as required\n.\n\n\nA list of SCP-2493-1\u2019s requests for updated containment procedures is to be submitted to the Ethics Committee on a bi-weekly basis for review and approval or rejection. Proposals to rescind approved requests are to be submitted to the Ethics Committee\n; \nany other\n attempts by staff to impede \napproved requests\n will result in severe reprimands \nat the discretion of the Overseer Council. The full list of approved and rejected requests are outlined in Document 2493-1; \u201c\nApproved & rejected requests by SCP-2493-1 for updates to containment procedures\n.\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSpecial\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0(Revision\u00a01)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\u00a0These\u00a0procedures\u00a0are\u00a0no\u00a0longer\u00a0in\u00a0effect!\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is to wear SCP-2493-2 at all times. SCP-2493-1 is to be kept in its modified humanoid containment cell at Lunar Area-32. The cell is to be filled with pure helium gas at a pressure of approximately 20 kilopascals, and kept at a temperature of approximately 280 Kelvin. The interior of the room is to be kept above a minimum of 270 Kelvin, to ensure continued biological function of SCP-2493-1.\n The interior surface of SCP-\n2493-1\n's containment cell is to be padded with a three centimetre thick layer of soft rubber. No sharp corners or points are to be present within SCP-2493-1's cell; all such corners or points are to be removed or padded. \nIn the event of SCP-2493-2 becoming punctured, it and\n SCP-\n2493-1\n \nare to be immediately jettisoned from the facility. MTF Gamma-4 (\"Blondebeard's Crew\")\n is to be \nnotified to adjust the trajectory of the anomaly as required, and to\n prevent \nit\n from \nentering the earth's atmosphere and\n causing a \nU\nK-Class \nGlobal Irradiation\n event.\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 is to be supplied at least 2 kilograms of waste matter daily, to a maximum of 10 kilograms.\n\n\nOnce weekly, a signal requesting contact is to be sent through the extradimensional anomaly located on the rear of SCP-2493-2 by use of a 4\u00a0MHz radio wave.\n The entity is \nalso\n to be under surveillance at all times, and any \nattempts to hinder\n communication with the entity\n\u2019s location of origin are\n to be reported \nto the site director\n immediately. \n(See Addendum 3.)\n\n\nA list of SCP-2493-1\u2019s requests for updated containment procedures is to be submitted to the Ethics Committee on a bi-weekly basis for review and approval or rejection. Proposals to rescind approved requests are to be submitted to the Ethics Committee; any other attempts by staff to impede approved requests will result in severe reprimands at the discretion of the Overseer Council. The full list of approved and rejected requests are outlined in Document 2493-1; \u201c\nApproved & rejected requests by SCP-2493-1 for updates to containment procedures\n.\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n \nSCP-2493 is the collective designation for two components; SCP-2493-1 and SCP-2493-2.\n\n\nSCP-\n2493-1\n is a male humanoid entity \napproximately 1.7 meters in height, and weighing approximately 95 kilograms\n. SCP-\n2493-1\n is \ncomposed entirely of antimatter, but\n physically \nappears to be\n an ordinary human. SCP-\n2493-1\n \nresponds to the name of Joe Smith, and\n claims to originate from an alternate dimension \ncomposed primarily of substances with similar atomic composition to his\n. Psychological evaluation of SCP-2493-1 has revealed that it suffers \nfrom nostophobia\n4\n \nand\n an obsession with completing their mission. \n(See Addendums)\n\n\nSCP-2493-2 is a suit composed entirely of a previously undiscovered and currently poorly-understood substance that SCP-2493-1 refers to as \u2018Buffer\u2019, superficially resembling an airtight type 1 hazmat suit. This substance is entirely non-baryonic in nature, uniformly reflects all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation resulting in a mirrored surface, and is also capable of preventing interaction between matter and antimatter. These properties prevent the contents of anything composed of this material from being examined by use of X-ray scanning, and severely impede physical examination. The material comprising SCP-2493-2 is flexible in a manner comparable to rubber, but has a texture consistent with polished metal. An impermeable barrier replaces the substance around SCP-2493-1\u2019s facial region, serving as a two-way visor. The interior of the suit is also capable of emitting light from an undetermined source, and will do so upon instruction by SCP-2493-1.\n\n\nOn the back of SCP-2493-2 is a multifunctional backpack that serves as an air recycler, \na method of exchanging resources obtained by SCP-2493-1 for canned provisions,\n5\n and an airtight input for canned provisions. SCP-2493-1 has never been observed to physically ingest these supplies; the entity states that this is attributable to nanites present within the interior of the suit, which constantly reassemble small sections of food within his mouth whenever available. \nIt is theorized that the device is connected to SCP-2493-1's reality of origin via a stable extradimensional anomaly in the device, as this is the only reasonable explanation of how the provided waste materials can be converted into edible substances composed of antimatter.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a01:\u00a0Information\u00a0Summary\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0summary.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of information regarding SCP-2493-1\u2019s origins, obtained during several interviews. \nIt should be noted that the only source of such information is the entity itself, and as such cannot be confirmed to be factual.\n (See Addendum 3.)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2493-1 originates from an alternate reality (Henceforth 2493\u2019) consisting entirely of antimatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society of 2493\u2019 has access to or has developed technology that is significantly more advanced than that of our own, with such technology requiring large quantities of electrical energy to operate, typically exceeding the range of petajoules on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology within 2493\u2019 \napproximately 200 years ago\n 173 years ago produced large quantities of waste materials as by-products of their operation. Such technology has since been adapted to recycle their waste materials. These produced waste materials were transported to a poorly-understood location of abnormal geometry, described as being physically located between two of the three axis present within normal three-dimensional space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter \nan undefined period of time\n 40 years the inhabitants of this space began transporting their own waste materials to 2493\u2019, with several described objects exhibiting anomalous phenomena sufficient to be classified as SCPs. This prompted the inhabitants of 2493\u2019 to develop devices capable of severely hindering the transit of such waste material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unidentified object, presumed to be of abnormal geometric origin, initiated an XK-Class Vacuum Decay within 2493\u2019. Technology developed specifically to counter such a scenario spontaneously activates, protecting a small portion of 2493\u2019 from the event; however, such technology is required to be powered continuously in order to sustain such protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous working-class citizens of 2493\u2019 have been deployed to alternate realities to obtain matter and transport it back, for the purpose of powering antimatter reactors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a02:\u00a0Recovery\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0log.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-\n2493-1\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was conducted shortly after the acquisition of the entity, before the \nantimatter\n nature of SCP-\n2493-1\n had been confirmed.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n:\n What is the suit you are wearing made of?\n\n\nSCP-\n2493-1\n:\n \nThere's no atoms.\n Why are you detaining me?\n\n\nResearcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n:\n We need to ask you some questions. \nWhy do you need the suit?\n\n\nSCP-2493-1:\n Because you're made of antimatter.\n6\n One plus negative one equals ka-fucking-boom.\n\n\nResearcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n:\n Would you care to elaborate upon your objective?\n\n\nSCP-\n2493-1\n:\n \nI grab some of your stuff, send it back home.

The superiors of SCP-2493-1 apologized for the extended period of time taken for them to respond, and requested to speak to SCP-2493-1 personally. Several of SCP-2493-1\u2019s claims, as well as additional false claims, were requested for confirmation to ensure that cooperative disinformation could not be attempted; all claims made by SCP-2493-1 (detailed in Addendum 1) were clarified and confirmed as true, with all additional false claims being denied. SCP-2493-1 was allowed to communicate with his superiors, and was noted to praise Lunar Area-32 staff repeatedly throughout their conversation, promoting trading prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, negotiations for trade between representatives of 2493\u2019 and the O5 Council was conducted. It was agreed that in return for digital information regarding assorted 2493\u2019 technology, the Foundation was to provide a continuous supply of matter in the form of waste material. The bulk of this waste material was sourced from the five major ocean gyres and various global landfills.\n\n\nThe majority of the information received from 2493\u2019 was oriented towards containment or destruction of anomalous entities, specializing in entities, objects or locations with abnormal geometric properties. Additional information enabled large advances in medical science, and artificial food production. Schematics for an antimatter reactor were also utilized to create the prototype FAM-Reactor.\n\n\nFurther negotiations were conducted to obtain controlled amounts of antimatter from 2493\u2019 in return for random samples of modern music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, \nLunar\n Area-\n32\n received a transmission \nfrom 2493\u2019 stating that several devices critical to the continued existence of 2493\u2019 were failing due to physical strain due to their extended usage. The Foundation was informed that while maintenance would delay total failure, 2493\u2019 was expected to be destroyed within a year\n.\n\n\nSeveral weeks later a second transmission was received, stating that the devices preventing 2493\u2019 from receiving waste material from the location of abnormal geometry had outright failed, and that 2493\u2019 was now being overrun with severely detrimental anomalous objects.\n Staff at \nLunar\n Area-\n32\n was advised to prepare to receive \nseveral objects essential to ensuring\n SCP-\n2493-1\u2019s\n \ncontinued biological function.

The success of this attempt is irrelevant; if the host believes they have exposed another individual to \"TYRFING\", the secondary properties will initiate. During this secondary phase \"TYRFING\", and all concepts the host (who is designated \"-TYRFING\" from then on) related to it, will exhibit antimemetic properties for the host alone \u2014 they will be unable to recall any information relating to the concept/s.

When transferred to an alternate computer system, TYR005.aic was fully-functional, but could not interact with any regions of data containing information about \u201cTYRFING\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTYR007.aic\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nAs with the previous test\n, \nthe computer hosting the AIC program\n became incapable of accessing any files \ncontaining information\n about \u201c\nTYRFING\n\u201d. \nThe TYR007.aic also became incapable of accessing information about\n \u201c\nTYRFING\n\u201d\n; however, it was also incapable of performing functions that involved it interacting with other AICs \u2013 while indirectly communicating with AICs (via modifiable text documents), it believed it\n was speaking to \ntesting\n personnel. Questioning revealed \nthat TYR007.aic believed it was a human consciousness implanted within a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTYR009.aic\n\n\nStopping, Deletion\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nThe\n \u201c\n-TYRFING\n\u201d \nTYR009.aic\n was \nin\ncapable of \nceasing any programs, functions, and/or\n deleting \nany\n data. This property \ndid not\n extend to \nthe computer system hosting the AIC; testing\n personnel \nwere able to close and delete data on the system. Impediments regarding documents containing \u201cTYRFING\u201d information were consistent with previous (and successive) tests\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Incident Log \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-01\n\n\nThree\n researchers were infected with \u201c\nTYRFING\n\u201d during a scheduled round of testing \nwith D-Class personnel\n on \n10/04/\n2018. \nThe automated redaction system used to automatically censor attempts to communicate \u201cTYRFING\u201d infectious material during conversation between researchers and test subjects had been updated the day prior; however, the update caused a stack overflow to occur, disabling the program.\n\n\nWhile \u201c+TYRFING\u201d, Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n14\n sent an indeterminate text message to an unknown phone number \u2013 due to Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 being found to be suffering from the secondary properties of \u201cTYRFING\u201d, it is assumed that this text message contained \u201cTYRFING\u201d infectious content. Due to the antimemetic properties of the anomaly, Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is unable to be questioned regarding these actions, nor can the recipient phone number be retrieved. An investigation is underway into whether\n this was a premeditated action\n, or compliance with the compulsive effect\n of the anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum \n2\n:\n\nOngoing surveillance of \nthe three researchers involved with Incident \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-01 has revealed an additional, hereditary property of\n \u201c\nTYRFING\n\u201d\n; all offspring of Researcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \u2588\u2588\u2588 that were conceived after 10/04/2018\n have shown \nperceptual alterations identical to Researcher \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\n \u2588\u2588\u2588; specifically,\n they are \nall\n unable to \nperceive or\n learn of the existence of \npears. Testing with the offspring has, however, shown that they are still susceptible to \u201cTYRFING\u201d infection and therefore, can experience further\n perceptual shifts.\n\n\nNo abnormal genetic markers have yet been identified to correlate to \u201cTYRFING\u201d infection. Research into identifying potential \u201cTYRFING\u201d markers has been allocated as high-priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2394\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-\n2394\n is to be kept in a chemically-induced dream state \nat the veterinarian wing of Bio-Site 84\n. SCP-\n2394\n is to be supplied with nutritional package \nNP2394\n by \nmethod of\n intravenous drip. Should SCP-\n2394\n awaken pre-emptively, \nno less than two veterinarian\n staff are to respond immediately and resume SCP-\n2394\n's dream state.\n\n\nSCP-2394's mental health is to be observed once per week by use of accessing its neurological files using \"2394filing.exe\", and a complete copy of all files should be made once per bi-annual period. Attempts to alter the neurological files of SCP-2394 are to be approved by the site director prior to execution. Research staff assigned to SCP-2394 are authorised to monitor SCP-2394's dreams by use of the \"2394REM.exe\" program at any time.\n Research staff \nnot assigned to SCP-2394\n must be \ngranted permission by level 2 personnel\n assigned to \nSCP-2394\n to monitor SCP-\n2394's\n \ndreams\n.\n\n\nSCP-\n2394\n is \nnot to be neurologically accessed by any computer connected to any networks at the time, and is\n to be thoroughly scanned for \nany potential manifestations of a digital\n consciousness \nof SCP-2394 prior to connecting to any networks\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-\n2394\n is a single \ninstance of \nLitoria caerulea\n, or\n Australian \ngreen tree frog\n. The entity is \ngenetically identical to common members of its species, and is\n physiologically normal \nexcluding several aspects added by SCP-2394's previous captors\n. \n(See Addendum 3.)\n\n\nThe entity has \nbeen surgically modified in several manners to\n extend its lifespan indefinitely\n, the most prominent of which is an artificial injection site located above the left portion of the hipbone, and an anomalously-powered artificial heart that has yet to cease operation. SCP-2394 also has a Firewire (IEEE 1394) port surgically attached to the top of its skull; this port is directly connected to several parts of the entity's brain, enabling it to be monitored by use of appropriately formatted software. (See Addendum 1 & 2.) Observation of the entity's thought processes and actions have revealed that it is sapient\n.\n\n\nSCP-2394 can \ninstantly\n teleport to any location that it has previously physically observed. \nThe mechanism by which the entity is capable of relocating in this manner is unknown, as it does not feature any abnormal organs or genetic sequences from those of its species, and apparently had the ability prior to its surgical modification. (See Addendum 4.)\n SCP-2394 can activate this ability by certain conscious thoughts, and thus is unable to utilise its ability while unconscious or dreaming.\n15\n \nNo successful method of replicating the entity's anomalous properties have been determined, and all attempts to convey the ability to SCP-2394's offspring have failed, suggesting the ability may not be a genetic trait. SCP-2394 has thus far never teleported to a location depicted in a photograph or film, however if this is a conscious decision on its part or an actual limitation has not yet been determined. Documents obtained during\n SCP-\n2394's\n \nrecovery state that the entity\n was capable of teleporting objects and organisms \nalong with itself, as long as they were in physical contact with it\n. This capability was a conscious decision by the entity\n, however testing by Foundation researchers have thus far failed to replicate this effect\n. \nAttempts to force SCP-2394 to relocate personnel with it are currently pending review by the Ethics Committee.\n SCP-\n2394\n is able to teleport to certain locations on the Australian\n, South American and African\n continent\ns, the southern region of the United States, and the central region of Asia.\n\n\nSCP-2394 can be neurally interfaced with any device capable of receiving a signal from a Firewire 800 cable either directly or by use of an adapter. The entity does not internally contain downloadable driver software, which must be installed onto devices in order for them to interpret SCP-2394 as an external port.\n16\n The original software recovered during the raid in which the entity was recovered from has been reverse engineered and improved for testing purposes by Foundation technicians. Two separate programs have been developed that utilise this driver software; \"2394filing.exe\" and \"2394REM.exe\", both detailed below. It is currently unknown if SCP-2394 has the potential capability to upload its consciousness to a device via the Firewire connection, but precautions are to be taken to prevent it from uploading itself to the Foundation network or the Internet if it is capable.\n\n\nAddendum 1: 2394filing.exe\n\nThe 2394filing.exe software enable devices connected to interpret various aspects of SCP-2394's consciousness as text documents that are numerically ordered in an ascending fashion, with each file allocated a random numerical value. \"2394filing.exe\" has an inbuilt feature that enables researchers to locate specific files relating to a topic, context or content. SCP-2394 is always locked in a read-only state, preventing any files from being added, altered or deleted from the entity in any way. No method of 'unlocking' SCP-2394 has been determined thus far, if it is at all possible.\n\n\nAddendum 2: 2394REM.exe\n\nThe 2394REM.exe software enables researchers to monitor SCP-2394's delta sleep constructs in a visual and auditory format. 2394REM.exe renders the constructs as a three-dimensional environment that can be navigated by the user, however regions that are outside SCP-2394's field of vision are significantly less detailed than regions within and audio that the entity is not consciously aware of fades at a rate of 5 decibels per second.\n\n\nObservations of SCP-\n2394\n \nusing 2394REM.exe\n has shown that \nit is unaware that it is in a dream state, and\n if conscious would actively avoid capture and containment \nby any humanoid being\n. Also of note is that \nSCP-2394 visualises itself as an ordinary frog of its species, with\n the distinguishing features of the entity absent from it\ns person\n.\n\n\nAddendum \n3\n:\n Recovery \nlog\n\nSCP-2394 was recovered during a raid \non a Chaos Insurgency base of operations\n. Having studied the entity for \n\u2588\u2588\n years, they \nhad developed functional software drivers for SCP-2394 and\n were \nutilising a prototype program in order to\n influence the entity to utilise its ability \nfor their benefit\n. Its anomalous capabilities were being utilised \nto relocate high-priority personnel and items\n undetected. \nThe program was designed to automatically monitor the thought processes of the entity, and engaged a failsafe of cerebral overstimulation\n17\n to keep it contained on location. A similar method of electrical stimulation of specific areas of the brain associated with memories of locations was also utilised to induce SCP-2394 to use its abilities in a desired manner.\n\n\nSCP-\n2394\n was showing signs of extreme distress upon retrieval, \nand was discovered to have been exposed to a cognitohazardous agent designed to induce rapid brain death in an attempt to prevent acquisition of the entity by Foundation agents. The entity was improperly exposed to the agent, resulting in it\n functioning incorrectly and causing \nan\n extreme mental strain \non the entity\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a04:\u00a0SCP-2394\u00a0File\u00a0samples\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Showing\u00a0sample\u00a0files.\n\n\n\n\nThe following format will be used:\n\n\n\n\nSearch Keyword/s:\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nRelated Content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Keyword/s:\n Old, Different, Head, Change\n\n\nNote:\n Sample was obtained using an early prototype of 2394filing.exe.

        "Interviewed: SCP- 2493-1 Interviewer: Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 Foreword: This interview was conducted shortly after the acquisition of the entity, before the antimatter nature of SCP- 2493-1 had been confirmed. <Begin Log> Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : What is the suit you are wearing made of? SCP- 2493-1 : There's no atoms. Why are you detaining me? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : We need to ask you some questions. Why do you need the suit? SCP-2493-1: Because you're made of antimatter. 6 One plus negative one equals ka-fucking-boom. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Would you care to elaborate upon your objective? SCP- 2493-1 : I grab some of your stuff, send it back home. Doesn't matter what it is, as long as I send it back. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : What do you require the resources for ? SCP-2493-1: Fuel. The explosion makes a lot of energy, which can be turned into electricity. I need to get uhh\u2026 two\u2026 two? Yeah, two kilograms minimum of antimatter per day. I uh, think that\u2019s how much they said would keep everything powered at least. Or was it five? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : What are you referring to? SCP- 2493-1 : Mainly home electrics, water recycling, food production and vehicle electricity. There\u2019s some more important things too, so could you please let me get back to work? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : If you are made of antimatter, aren\u2019t you aware of the ramifications that will occur if your suit is punctured ? SCP- 2493-1 : I die and my employers lose a supply line, it was on the contract. It\u2019s an acceptable loss, considering they can just find another source . Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : It would be safer to simply send you back. If you cooperate , we should be able to devise a method of sending you back . SCP- 2493-1 : You don\u2019t need to send me back, I\u2019m fine here . Just let me stay. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Why shouldn\u2019t we send you back? SCP- 2493-1 : It\u2019s safer here. From what I\u2019ve seen of here, we\u2019ve been ahead of you in regards to technology for ages , but you\u2019ve been able to handle waste much better than we did . We got lazy and sent it off to some vague location between dimensions for a couple of years , but as it turned out there were\u2026 things, living there, and seeing as we were fine with sending them our garbage, they seem to have decided to send their garbage to us as well . You know what sort of things that be i ngs from between dimensions consider garbage? <End Log> Closing Statement: Theoretical calculations of the interaction of 2kg masses of matter and antimatter as described by SCP-2493-1 would produce 360 petajoules of energy; in comparison, the Three Gorges Dam in China, the world\u2019s largest power station as of writing, produces 356 petajoules of energy per year. Questioning SCP-2493-1 in regards to the technology necessitating electrical input at this magnitude on a daily basis is currently underway.",
        "On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, contact with 2493\u2019 was successfully established by use of a 4\u00a0MHz radio wave transmitted through the extradimensional anomaly located on the rear of SCP-2493-2. The superiors of SCP-2493-1 apologized for the extended period of time taken for them to respond, and requested to speak to SCP-2493-1 personally. Several of SCP-2493-1\u2019s claims, as well as additional false claims, were requested for confirmation to ensure that cooperative disinformation could not be attempted; all claims made by SCP-2493-1 (detailed in Addendum 1) were clarified and confirmed as true, with all additional false claims being denied. SCP-2493-1 was allowed to communicate with his superiors, and was noted to praise Lunar Area-32 staff repeatedly throughout their conversation, promoting trading prospects.",
        "On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, negotiations for trade between representatives of 2493\u2019 and the O5 Council was conducted. It was agreed that in return for digital information regarding assorted 2493\u2019 technology, the Foundation was to provide a continuous supply of matter in the form of waste material. The bulk of this waste material was sourced from the five major ocean gyres and various global landfills. The majority of the information received from 2493\u2019 was oriented towards containment or destruction of anomalous entities, specializing in entities, objects or locations with abnormal geometric properties. Additional information enabled large advances in medical science, and artificial food production. Schematics for an antimatter reactor were also utilized to create the prototype FAM-Reactor. Further negotiations were conducted to obtain controlled amounts of antimatter from 2493\u2019 in return for random samples of modern music.",
        "On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, Lunar Area- 32 received a transmission from 2493\u2019 stating that several devices critical to the continued existence of 2493\u2019 were failing due to physical strain due to their extended usage. The Foundation was informed that while maintenance would delay total failure, 2493\u2019 was expected to be destroyed within a year . Several weeks later a second transmission was received, stating that the devices preventing 2493\u2019 from receiving waste material from the location of abnormal geometry had outright failed, and that 2493\u2019 was now being overrun with severely detrimental anomalous objects. Staff at Lunar Area- 32 was advised to prepare to receive several objects essential to ensuring SCP- 2493-1\u2019s continued biological function. Several devices constructed of the same material as SCP-2493-2 manifested a short distance outside Lunar Area-32, including a large room with airlock capable of safely containing SCP-2493-1 in a vacuum environment, which has since been relocated away from the Area, connected via high-speed rail and further reinforced .",
        "On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, a large burst of digital information was received from 2493\u2019, primarily consisting of historic records of 2493\u2019, photographs of various regions of 2493\u2019 and several schematics for devices capable of recycling various non-biodegradable materials into reusable resources. All information received has been archived as required . To date, no further transmissions have been received from 2493\u2019.",

An interview was conducted to question SCP- 3492 regarding these revelations. <Begin Log> Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Good morning 3492, how are you doing ? SCP- 3492 : About as well as you can be while know ing you're illegal. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588: I\u2026 see. We're working with your creator to find out how you came into our possession, to avoid it in future . Speaking of which, we've come across some\u2026 discrepancies, which we would like your help with . Are you willing to help ? SCP- 3492 : I guess. No t like I can get any more illegal . < SCP-3492's left thumb extends until it touches the ceiling of the room, after which it returns to its normal length. > Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Ok. You will periodically move along a spatial axis higher than the standard three we exist within, correct ? SCP- 3492 : Yeah, that's what happened the last time we spoke. It just happens whenever it wants . Which is what you get for being ILLEGAL . < SCP-3492's right leg is seen shifting before disappearing. > Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Yes, well, are you aware that issue was resolved in one of the earlier versions of your software? < SCP- 3492's right leg re appears. > SCP- 3492 : Really? Well, that's odd. But then again, it's probably back because I'm ILLEGAL. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Well, there's several other anomalies that have been listed as resolved as well, such - SCP- 3492 : Maybe they weren't fixed in copies that are ILLEGAL. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : I would appreciate if you stopped emphasising that point. SCP- 3492 : What, that I'm ILLEGAL?

Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Well, there are also several aspects of you that were never included as features in the software. You claim that you have been renamed to \"Dicks McSquigee,\" correct? SCP-3492: That \u2026 yeah, I \u2026 Is that\u2026 ? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Unfortunately, yes.
