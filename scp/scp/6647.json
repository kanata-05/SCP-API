Should any other instances be recovered, they should be stored within Item Locker 6647 after recovery \nand testing\n. No further procedures are considered necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6647 is a liquid substance stored in a red glass perfume bottle. SCP-6647 is comprised of a lemon extract, a lime extract, an unknown liquid substance, and a human blood-like substance. The bottle is labelled \"Imperception de Citron.\"\n1\n The bottom of the bottle possesses a series of unidentified thaumaturgical symbols carved into the glass.\n\n\nWhen SCP-6647 is applied directly to the skin using the bottle's spraying device, the wearer's presence is forgotten by other persons at the wearer's discretion. These persons will be unable to perceive the wearer unless they are directly touched. Immediate memories of the wearer will be removed from the memory in a manner similar to the application of a Class-A amnestic. This is true for wearers being viewed on live video feeds and similar media as well, although recordings which are at least ten minutes old are unaffected.\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-6647 will dissipate within ten minutes, or when the subject is perceived by touch. Lost memories of the wearer, as well as memories of perceiving the wearer while under its effects, will return to those affected by it. This often creates brief moments of panic or confusion. The substance emits a Hume level of 100.25 and creates a notably strong citrus scent.\n2\n\n\nSCP-6647 was discovered on 8/1/2022, when Site-19 security personnel were alerted to a suspicious package which manifested in the site's mail room. The package was investigated and found to have a Hume level of 100.5. The package was found to contain SCP-6647 and a note. The note provides the global positioning coordinates of \nGoI-6696,\n and a request to \"clean them up.\" This information is included for its relevancy to Investigation 6647 to aid investigators and may not be relevant to this article.\n\n\nAddendum 6647-1:\n Testing Logs\n\n\nNOTICE: Due to the nature of SCP-6647 and the possibility of successful escape attempts being made by Class-D Personnel, testing is to be halted indefinitely. Requests for testing may be made to your Site Director's office, accompanied by proof of Level-3 credentials.\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 01\n\n\nDate:\n 8/1/2022\n\n\nSubject:\n D-8675309\n\n\nProcedure:\n Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Believing the subject had not yet been brought to the testing lab, researchers contacted site security to request a new test subject be brought to them. On realizing this, D-8675309 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons, even while under SCP-6647's effects.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Thanks solely to the labyrinthine nature of this facility, D-8675309 was recaptured without issue, but they very easily could've left if they knew the route. I suggest we halt testing entirely, unless someone on staff would like to volunteer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 02\n\n\nDate:\n 8/1/2022\n\n\nSubject:\n D-8675310\n\n\nProcedure:\n Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin.\n\n\nForeword (opt.):\n This test was performed as a result of the previous test, prior to the effect wearing off.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Before researchers could contact site security to bring a new test subject, the effect from Test #01 wore off, causing researchers to panic and contact site security to locate D-8675309. On realizing this, D-8675310 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n D-8675310 managed to locate the exit and was apprehended at the front gate after the effect wore off.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6647-2:\n Incident Information\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a06647-1\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Incident Report: 8/2/2022\n\n\nInvolved Items/Persons:\n SCP-6647, PoI-6647\n\n\nIncident Description:\n At 1655 hours, a young man dressed in a top hat and a suit and tie (PoI-6647) entered Site-19 via the primary garage entry while wearing SCP-6647.\n3\n They held the door open as someone left and entered through the opened doorway. An automatic intruder alarm was triggered, however, due to the effects of SCP-6647, site security were unable to perceive PoI-6647 and the person entered the facility. PoI-6647 attempted to navigate Site-19 before becoming apparently lost, at which point the effects of SCP-6647 dissipated. Site security located PoI-6647, who was immediately detained and interrogated. A transcription of the interrogation is included below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrogation Log: 8/2/2022\n\n\nInterrogator:\n Security Agent Stromm\n\n\nDetainee:\n PoI-6647\n\n\nOthers (opt.):\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\n\n\nAgent Stromm sits back in his seat and stares at PoI-6647 for a few seconds before talking.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n So who are you?\n\n\n\n\nPoI-6647 stares at Agent Stromm, upset.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n I said, who are you? Silence won't save you here. We take intrusion seriously, especially on your level. You're better off telling us who you are before we take you and find out.\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n Fuck you.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-6647 spits on the interview table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStromm takes a deep, exasperated breath.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n Yeah, alright, fucker. Let me explain something to you. Do you know where you are? Do you know what we do here? We lock things up. I mean we keep hold of some pretty fucked up shit. We kill things just to satiate horrors the likes of which you've never seen. I've killed people, I mean I have fucking slaughtered people. You think you're big game? You think you and whatever little gang you're part of is hot shit? We have ethics committees built just to stop me from breaking you into pieces, but you had better give us something, or I swear to god you will experience a level of pain the likes of which you will never fucking forget.\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n I've sworn an oath. You don't scare me. I'm not telling you jack shit. I serve mom to the end. ..wait.\n\n\nStromm:\n Do you seriously expect me to believe th-\n\n\n\n\nPoI-6647's handcuffs and restraints fall to the ground and PoI-6647 slaps Agent Stromm across the face.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n What the fuck.\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n Come on man, handcuffs and rope are the first trick in the book. You ever hear of Harry Houdini? Man was-\n\n\n\n\nAgent Stromm jumps over the interview table and tackles PoI-6647, restraining him again. Agent Stromm slams PoI-6647's head into the interview table.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n Who the \nfuck\n do you work for!?\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n Agh! Christ man, I already told you!\n\n\n\n\nAgent Stromm slams PoI-6647's head into the interview table again.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n Do you seriously expect me to believe that you work for your mother!? Do I look like a fucking dumbass!?\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n Oww, fuck man, no! Th-the M.O.M.!\n\n\nStromm:\n Never heard of them, explain.\n\n\nPoI-6647:\n No. I'll tell you that much, you'll have to kill me for the rest.\n\n\n\n\nStromm grabs PoI-6647 by his shirt collar.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n That can be arranged.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patra is speaking from an observation room.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n Stromm! Good lord, let the kid go a little.\n\n\nStromm:\n I don't appreciate being slapped, Cleo.\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n Me neither, but don't kill him. I really would have to report you and probably get Ethics involved. Just send him back.\n\n\nStromm:\n Fuck. Fine.\n\n\n\n\nPoI-6647 is escorted out of the room by site security. Dr. Patra enters the interview room. Stromm reaches for the recorder.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n No, let it roll for a moment.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patra sits in the interviewee chair, across from Agent Stromm.\n\n\n\n\nStromm:\n So.. who's the M.O.M.?\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n We don't know much, honest. They're magicians, best as we can determine.\n\n\nStromm:\n Okay? Why isn't thaumaturgy in here yet then?\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n Different kind of magic. Like.. like street magic, but real. Pulling rabbits out of top hats and the like. They use odd, jerry-rigged thaumaturgy that we don't understand to cheat some bigger tricks, but in general, it's some new kind of thing.\n\n\nStromm:\n Not sure I'm following.\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n Well.. his handcuffs, for example. He didn't flip a little secret lever or pull a key from his pocket. He just got out of them. Didn't pick the lock, didn't pry them off. It's the trick of a street magician, but it's not a trick.\n\n\nStromm:\n And you know all this because..?\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n ..I can't say until the O's get back to me. If you ever come into contact with someone like him again, you need to tell me immediately. Anyone from the M.O.M., anyone who performs this sort of magic. Crash kids' birthday parties if you have to.\n\n\nStromm:\n ..You got it, boss.\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a06647-2\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Incident Report: 8/2/2022\n\n\nInvolved Items/Persons:\n PoI-6647\n\n\nIncident Description:\n At 2335 hours, security cameras in Detainment Block C recorded PoI-6647 appearing to have a conversation with someone.

The vehicle ceases spinning and returns to a regular driving orientation, maintaining a speed approaching 105mph.\n\n\n\n\n1 - PoI-6647:\n Okay, okay!\n\n\n\n\n1 - \nPoI-6647 climbs over the divider and into the driver's seat as PoI-7746 climbs out of the driver side window and onto the hood of vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n2 - Stromm:\n What the fuck is he doing!?\n\n\n\n\n1 - \nPoI-7746 stands on the hood of the vehicle, with his left foot against the passenger side of the windshield. Note that the vehicle's speed has increased to 110mph, which should ordinarily be fast enough to throw PoI-7746 over the roof. PoI-7746 holds his arms out as if holding a rifle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - \nVehicle 3's left front tire is shot by a .22LR round, causing it to pop. The vehicle begins veering to the left uncontrollably, crashing into vehicle 6 and pushing them both off the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll - \nThe remaining vehicles open fire on vehicle 1 again. PoI-7746 takes a shot at vehicle 2, puncturing the vehicle's windshield and narrowly missing Security Agent Stromm's left shoulder. PoI-7746 climbs back into the vehicle through the driver side window, forcing PoI-6647 to move back to the passenger side while the vehicle sustains heavy gunfire.\n\n\n\n\n1 - PoI-7746:\n Okay, new plan! Too much gunfire, we lose them in the tunnel!\n\n\n1 - PoI-6647:\n What!? How!?\n\n\n1 - PoI-7746:\n It's a new trick I learned! Toss me your rit knife!\n\n\n\n\n1 - \nPoI-6647 removes his hat and reaches into it, then removes a long knife with a slightly curved blade. PoI-7746 takes the blade from him and cuts PoI-6647 along the upper left shoulder, causing PoI-6647 to bleed a purple liquid. PoI-7746 covers the blade in the liquid, then stabs the blade into the front of the steering wheel, causing the airbag to deploy. PoI-7746 cuts away the airbag and quickly carves a series of thaumaturgical symbols in the steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\nN/A:\n Roadblocks are set up, they won't know what hit 'em!\n\n\n2 - Stromm:\n Good! We'll chase 'em into the tunnel and corner 'em there!\n\n\n\n\n1 - \nThe vehicle's speed increases at a rate faster than should be possible, eventually plateauing at roughly 195mph.\n\n\n\n\n2 - Stromm:\n Keep firing! They're coming up on the overpass tunnel!\n\n\n1 - PoI-7746:\n Meep meep!\n6\n\n\n\n\nAll - \nVehicle 1 races through the tunnel entrance, at which point vehicle 1's video feed is lost. Bullets begin to strike the entryway to the tunnel, revealing that the tunnel has closed and has transformed into a hyper-realistic painting of the tunnel's entrance. The other vehicles collide with the painting, which has been made on solid concrete. In the painting, vehicle 1 can still be seen driving away from the entrance and out the other side. Due to the collision, five security agents, including Security Agent Stromm, are severely wounded and one is killed. Vehicle 1 does not appear at the other side of the tunnel.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Log\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n I swear to god I'm gonna \ntake a ride to Chucky Carjack's vehicular magic show!

Believing the subject had not yet been brought to the testing lab, researchers contacted site security to request a new test subject be brought to them. On realizing this, D-8675309 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons, even while under SCP-6647's effects.

Before researchers could contact site security to bring a new test subject, the effect from Test #01 wore off, causing researchers to panic and contact site security to locate D-8675309. On realizing this, D-8675310 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons.

Stromm: So who are you? PoI-6647 stares at Agent Stromm, upset. Stromm: I said, who are you? Silence won't save you here. We take intrusion seriously, especially on your level. You're better off telling us who you are before we take you and find out. PoI-6647: Fuck you. PoI-6647 spits on the interview table. Stromm takes a deep, exasperated breath. Stromm: Yeah, alright, fucker. Let me explain something to you. Do you know where you are? Do you know what we do here? We lock things up. I mean we keep hold of some pretty fucked up shit. We kill things just to satiate horrors the likes of which you've never seen. I've killed people, I mean I have fucking slaughtered people. You think you're big game? You think you and whatever little gang you're part of is hot shit? We have ethics committees built just to stop me from breaking you into pieces, but you had better give us something, or I swear to god you will experience a level of pain the likes of which you will never fucking forget.

Do I look like a fucking dumbass!? PoI-6647: Oww, fuck man, no! Th-the M.O.M.! Stromm: Never heard of them, explain. PoI-6647: No. I'll tell you that much, you'll have to kill me for the rest. Stromm grabs PoI-6647 by his shirt collar. Stromm: That can be arranged. Dr. Patra is speaking from an observation room. Dr. Patra: Stromm! Good lord, let the kid go a little. Stromm: I don't appreciate being slapped, Cleo. Dr. Patra: Me neither, but don't kill him. I really would have to report you and probably get Ethics involved. Just send him back. Stromm: Fuck. Fine. PoI-6647 is escorted out of the room by site security. Dr. Patra enters the interview room. Stromm reaches for the recorder. Dr. Patra: No, let it roll for a moment. Dr. Patra sits in the interviewee chair, across from Agent Stromm. Stromm: So.. who's the M.O.M.? Dr. Patra: We don't know much, honest. They're magicians, best as we can determine. Stromm: Okay? Why isn't thaumaturgy in here yet then? Dr. Patra: Different kind of magic. Like.. like street magic, but real. Pulling rabbits out of top hats and the like. They use odd, jerry-rigged thaumaturgy that we don't understand to cheat some bigger tricks, but in general, it's some new kind of thing. Stromm: Not sure I'm following. Dr. Patra: Well.. his handcuffs, for example. He didn't flip a little secret lever or pull a key from his pocket. He just got out of them. Didn't pick the lock, didn't pry them off. It's the trick of a street magician, but it's not a trick. Stromm: And you know all this because..? Dr. Patra: ..I can't say until the O's get back to me. If you ever come into contact with someone like him again, you need to tell me immediately. Anyone from the M.O.M., anyone who performs this sort of magic. Crash kids' birthday parties if you have to. Stromm: ..You got it, boss. End Log",

A 7.62x39mm round pierces vehicle 1's back windshield and lodges itself in the front windshield. 1 - PoI-6647: Oh shit! Oh god! 1 - PoI-7746 opens his mouth and pulls a screwdriver out of it, then stabs the screwdriver into the side of the steering column. He pushes the gear shift into neutral and throws the steering wheel to the left, causing the vehicle to spin violently around its center of gravity. The vehicle somehow continues moving in the same direction and at the same speed. 1 - PoI-7746: Hang on to something, kid! 1 - PoI-6647 is yelling incoherently. 1 - The vehicle spins around the road erratically, though manages to avoid most gunfire, with most of the bullets striking non-vital portions of the vehicle's hull. 2 - Stromm: Somebody call the locals before they manage to drive onto the freeway! Security Agent Stromm's in-vehicle phone begins calling the local authorities. N/A: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Police Department, Chief Handlon speaking. 2 - Stromm: This is Chris Sturk for Shield and Cross Prison, we're chasing two escaped convicts! You need to shut down the I-\u2588\u2588 immediately! N/A: Hah! What, you don't speak to us for months, and now you only call whe- 2 - Stromm: God damnit Handlon, do it or I cut so much fucking funding you won't be able to feed your kids! Put up a roadblock after the tunnel! N/A: Yes, sir! 1 - PoI-7746: Okay, kid! I need you to take the wheel! 1 - PoI-6647: I- what!? No fucking way! 1 - PoI-7746 slaps PoI-6647 across the face. PoI-7746 then removes the screwdriver from the steering column and pulls the gear shift back into drive. The vehicle ceases spinning and returns to a regular driving orientation, maintaining a speed approaching 105mph. 1 - PoI-6647: Okay, okay! 1 - PoI-6647 climbs over the divider and into the driver's seat as PoI-7746 climbs out of the driver side window and onto the hood of vehicle. 2 - Stromm: What the fuck is he doing!? 1 - PoI-7746 stands on the hood of the vehicle, with his left foot against the passenger side of the windshield. Note that the vehicle's speed has increased to 110mph, which should ordinarily be fast enough to throw PoI-7746 over the roof. PoI-7746 holds his arms out as if holding a rifle. 3 - Vehicle 3's left front tire is shot by a .22LR round, causing it to pop. The vehicle begins veering to the left uncontrollably, crashing into vehicle 6 and pushing them both off the road. All - The remaining vehicles open fire on vehicle 1 again. PoI-7746 takes a shot at vehicle 2, puncturing the vehicle's windshield and narrowly missing Security Agent Stromm's left shoulder. PoI-7746 climbs back into the vehicle through the driver side window, forcing PoI-6647 to move back to the passenger side while the vehicle sustains heavy gunfire. 1 - PoI-7746: Okay, new plan! Too much gunfire, we lose them in the tunnel! 1 - PoI-6647: What!? How!? 1 - PoI-7746: It's a new trick I learned! Toss me your rit knife! 1 - PoI-6647 removes his hat and reaches into it, then removes a long knife with a slightly curved blade. PoI-7746 takes the blade from him and cuts PoI-6647 along the upper left shoulder, causing PoI-6647 to bleed a purple liquid. PoI-7746 covers the blade in the liquid, then stabs the blade into the front of the steering wheel, causing the airbag to deploy. PoI-7746 cuts away the airbag and quickly carves a series of thaumaturgical symbols in the steering wheel. N/A: Roadblocks are set up, they won't know what hit 'em! 2 - Stromm: Good! We'll chase 'em into the tunnel and corner 'em there! 1 - The vehicle's speed increases at a rate faster than should be possible, eventually plateauing at roughly 195mph. 2 - Stromm: Keep firing! They're coming up on the overpass tunnel! 1 - PoI-7746: Meep meep! 6 All - Vehicle 1 races through the tunnel entrance, at which point vehicle 1's video feed is lost. Bullets begin to strike the entryway to the tunnel, revealing that the tunnel has closed and has transformed into a hyper-realistic painting of the tunnel's entrance. The other vehicles collide with the painting, which has been made on solid concrete. In the painting, vehicle 1 can still be seen driving away from the entrance and out the other side. Due to the collision, five security agents, including Security Agent Stromm, are severely wounded and one is killed. Vehicle 1 does not appear at the other side of the tunnel.
