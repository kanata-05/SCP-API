Any requests for the item's testing or use must first be approved by Site Director Fraise.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6962 is a 30\u00a0cm tall stuffed doll, designed to look like a red wizard donning an eyepatch\n1\n, kept inside a square plastic container. When held, SCP-6962 allows its wielder to detonate any item within viewing distance, to varying degrees of success.\n\n\nAddendum 6962.1 - Testing Logs:\n\n\nThe following is a list of tests done to discern SCP-6962's anomalous capabilities and limitations. The tests, unless otherwise specified, were performed in Site-32's testing rooms, with a D-Class being told to attempt to detonate the specified item, and the relevant researchers overseeing.\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond\n\n\nTested Object:\n A graphite pencil.\n\n\nResults:\n The pencil explodes from its center, sending shards of graphite and wood across the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond\n\n\nTested Object:\n A square-meter metal cube.\n\n\nResults:\n The top of the cube loudly pops, as if an air bubble burst underneath it, causing a loud metallic noise. The involved D-Class refused to continue testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond, Researcher Brown\n\n\nTested Object:\n A malfunctioning fridge, brought from the site's cafeteria.\n\n\nResults:\n Flames erupt from inside of the fridge as the fridge door flies at the observation window, cracking it. The inside of the fridge is molten and black. \nLet's not do more tests on big metal objects. - Researcher Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond, Researcher Brown\n\n\nTested Object:\n A page, written on with ink. The D-Class was told to attempt and detonate the text itself.\n\n\nResults:\n The ink explodes, leaving large dark soot marks on the page and some smoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond, Researcher Brown\n\n\nTested Object:\n A house of cards.\n\n\nResults:\n A singular card explodes. The house falls weakly on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond, Researcher Brown\n\n\nTested Object:\n A house of cards, this time instructed to view the house as a collective rather than multiple individual cards.\n\n\nResults:\n The cards loudly pop from the top to the bottom, each burning in the air before hitting the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Osmond, Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown\n\n\nTested Object:\n The D-Class was instructed to detonate a memory from another D-Class's mind, who was also in the observation room.\n\n\nResults:\n After a few minutes of futility, one of the second D-Class's hairs lit on fire. \nOk so abstract concepts are a no-go. - Junior Researcher Hadar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS TESTS REMOVED FOR BREVITY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Zhu, Researcher Schmidt\n\n\nTested Object:\n Water inside of a sealed container.\n\n\nResults:\n The water instantly turned into gas. Due to the expansion of space, the container broke, sending some shards towards the D-Class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Zhu, Researcher Schmidt\n\n\nTested Object:\n SCP-6962\n\n\nResults:\n This test was done without permission following the previous test's results. The item did not detonate. Instead, a loud pop was heard from the D-Class's hand, leaving a scorch mark. \nUnsure if it was the SCP protecting itself, or just the tester messing it up. - Researcher Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n \nN/A\n\n\nTested Object:\n SCP-6962\n\n\nResults:\n Test declined. \nIf it works you just blew up a perfectly good research item. No. - Site Director Fraise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Schmidt, Senior Researcher Barsky\n\n\nTested Object:\n The air inside of a helium balloon.\n\n\nResults:\n The balloon quickly inflated to near-bursting size, before quickly returning to the previous state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Schmidt, Senior Researcher Barsky\n\n\nTested Object:\n The knot of the helium balloon.\n\n\nResults:\n The knot popped, sending the balloon flying across the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Schmidt, Senior Researcher Barsky\n\n\nTested Object:\n The knot of another helium balloon, refilled by Senior Researcher Barsky.\n\n\nResults:\n The knot popped, sending the balloon flying across the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Schmidt, Senior Researcher Barsky\n\n\nTested Object:\n The knot of another helium balloon, refilled by Senior Researcher Barsky.\n\n\nResults:\n The knot popped, sending the balloon flying across the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n Junior Researcher Hadar, Researcher Brown, Researcher Schmidt, Senior Researcher Barsky, Senior Researcher Ibanez\n\n\nTested Object:\n The knot of another helium balloon, refilled by Senior Researcher Barsky.\n\n\nResults:\n The knot popped, sending the balloon flying across the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS TESTS REMOVED FOR BREVITY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n \nN/A\n\n\nTested Object:\n The knot of another helium balloon, refilled by Senior Researcher Barsky.\n\n\nResults:\n Following Barsky's eighth walk to the storage room in twelve minutes, Site Director Fraise inquired as to the reasoning for it.

We already know how SCP-6962 interacts with water. We know how it interacts with clusters of items. We know how it interacts with gas. There is absolutely, positively, certainly no need to cause what will likely be the most egregious breaking of the veil proposed in my entire tenure as site director. I don't get what about this item is making you all turn into schoolchildren, but please - we're more professional than this. - Site Director Fraise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervising Researchers:\n \nN/A\n\n\nTested Object:\n Site Director Fraise's desk.\n\n\nResults:\n Test Denied. \nTesting is suspended until further notice. - Site Director Fraise\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6962.2 - Transcript:\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\nDATE:\n 2019/06/21\n\n\nNOTES:\n This log is of an impromptu discussion between Site Director Fraise and Researcher Brown, the latter of which was assigned to SCP-6962's testing.\n\n\n\n\n(Site Director Fraise can be seen sitting in his office chair, flipping through mountains of paper laid at his desk.
