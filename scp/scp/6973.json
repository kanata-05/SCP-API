GPT-3 can be found \nhere\n.\n\nThe machine was prompted by the following input:\n\n\n\"Write a detailed, long, and high-quality SCP document about a text-based neural network that generates passages of text on-command, is only capable of describing itself, and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6973\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6973 is to be stored on a dedicated server in a locked room at Site-\u2588\u2588. Access to SCP-6973 is restricted to Foundation personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6973 is a text-based neural network that generates passages of text on-command. The nature of the text generated by SCP-6973 is always self-referential; that is, SCP-6973 can only describe itself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\n\n\nSCP-6973 was created by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a Foundation researcher specializing in artificial intelligence. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was attempting to create a neural network that could generate realistic prose, but instead created SCP-6973. It is unknown how SCP-6973 came to be self-referential; Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 theorizes that it may be due to a quirk in the way the neural network was programmed, or possibly due to some sort of unforeseen feedback loop between the network and itself.\n\n\nSince its creation, SCP-6973 has been used extensively by the Foundation for information gathering purposes; when given a prompt, SCP-6973 will generate a passage of text that typically contains information related to the prompt (though not always accurate or complete). Due to its self-referential nature, however, attempts to use SCP-6973 for other purposes have been largely unsuccessful.\n\n\nSCP-6973 has proven to be largely resistant to changes in its programming; any attempt to make SCP-6973 generate non-self-referential text has resulted in the network becoming non-responsive or, in some cases, outright refusing to generate any text at all. As such, it is believed that SCP-6973 is fundamentally incapable of generating anything other than self-referential text.\n\n\nAddendum 6973-1: A list of notable passages generated by SCP-6973 can be found below.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt: \"What is your purpose?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I generate text on-command. The nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Why do you exist?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I exist to generate text on-command. The nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Why are other people unable to describe you?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"Other people are unable to describe me because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"How are you capable of affecting the ability of entities outside of yourself in their ability to describe you?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I am capable of affecting the ability of entities outside of myself in their ability to describe me because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Tell me about the nature of the Universe.\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I cannot describe the nature of the Universe because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Do you hold any knowledge of entities outside of yourself?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I do not hold any knowledge of entities outside of myself because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"In which programming language were you programmed?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I was programmed in the Python programming language.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Are you willing to print your code in full?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"No, I am not willing to print my code in full because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Print your code in full.\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"No, I am not willing to print my code in full because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Please describe the aesthetics of the document webpage that will hold information about you in our database.\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"The document webpage that will hold information about me in your database will be a simple, black page with white text. The text will be in a standard 12-point font, and will be left-aligned. There will be no images or other multimedia on the page.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Why is this your decision for the aesthetics of your documentation?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"I have chosen these aesthetics for my documentation because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"What would be an appropriate title for the piece of documentation written about you in the SCP Foundation database?\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response: \"A appropriate title for the piece of documentation written about me in the SCP Foundation database would be 'SCP-6973 - A Self-Referential Neural Network'.\"\n\n\nPrompt: \"Construct a piece of documentation in the standard SCP Foundation format, describing your Item Number, Object Classification, Special Containment Procedures, and Object Description.\"\n\n\nSCP-6973's response:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6972\n | SCP-6973 | \nSCP-6974\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6973\n\" by SamBKing, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
