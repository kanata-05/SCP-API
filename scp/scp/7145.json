A keycard lock has been outfitted onto Item Locker #7145 requiring Level 4 access or higher with the exception of Dr. Patra's keycard, which will be denied at any level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7145\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7145 is a standard magic 8-ball fortune-telling novelty item produced by Mattel, Inc. The outer shell of the object is constructed of plastic and colored to appear similar to an oversized number 8 billiards ball with the exception of a window allowing the user to view the object's interior. The interior consists of roughly 100ml of alcohol and a single 20-sided icosahedron die floating within. The die is inscribed on each side with varying answers to binary yes-or-no questions.\n\n\nWhenever a subject asks a binary yes-or-no question and shakes SCP-7145 immediately proceeding, the die will display one of the 20 sides inscribed with an answer to the question. If the question asked relates to a matter which can be proven with unequivocal fact, the returned answer will always be correct. This is true regardless of whether or not the events required to transpire in order to prove the answer correct have occurred. Investigation is currently ongoing into whether the object alters reality such that its responses are correct or if the object is only capable of correctly predicting what is already going to happen.\n\n\nAddendum 7145-1:\n Testing Logs\n\n\nCertain logs have been redacted for brevity. You may request a full list of test logs from your site's documentation department.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Pre-Voluntary\u00a0Testing\u00a0Period\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 001\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86753\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will those assholes in the booth ever shut up?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"As I see it, yes.\"\n\n\nResults:\n Per standard protocol, assigned testing staff were silent. It is uncertain if this was also due to SCP-7145's properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 002\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86753\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Does Mary still love me?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Don't count on it.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Mary McKay was questioned by an undercover MTF agent, who confessed that her feelings for D-86753 had waned during his incarceration and no longer cared for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 003\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86753\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will I ever see Mary again?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"You may rely on it.\"\n\n\nResult:\n As part of an unrelated investigation, Mary McKay was brought in to Site-19 for questioning. D-86753 confessed to seeing her as she was being escorted to an interview room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 008\n\n\nSubject:\n D-77238\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will I be a millionaire tomorrow?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"As I see it, yes.\"\n\n\nResult:\n The following day, D-77238's mother, father, and grandfather were all killed in a vehicle collision. The resulting life insurance payouts and transfers from the individuals final wills total roughly $1.3 million dollars. D-77238's assets were frozen within the following hour.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Following this test, SCP-7145 was cleared for voluntary staff testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Voluntary\u00a0Testing-inclusive\u00a0Period\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 12\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will the cafeteria lunch be any good today?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Ask again later.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Null. This is the first instance of SCP-7145 returning an inconclusive response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 17\n\n\nSubject:\n D-68750\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will I be getting out of here any time soon?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Most likely.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Security teams have been advised of the potential for D-68750's escape. At the time of writing, nothing has occurred to confirm the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 18\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Connors\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will D-68750 escape the facility?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"My sources say no.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Inconclusive. This appears to contradict the output of the previous test. This has lead to the belief in some research staff that SCP-7145 will lie to subjects in order to bring them comfort. Confirmation of this theory would imply some level of sentience inherent to SCP-7145.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 19\n\n\nSubject:\n D-68750\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Is there an afterlife?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"It is certain.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Inconclusive. This test was performed informally. During pre-testing object retrieval, SCP-018 broke containment, then bounced down a corridor and into the anomalous item storage facility, where it struck D-68750. D-68750 sustained three broken ribs and a ruptured lung. Test was performed as D-68750 lay injured on the facility floor. D-68750 was pronounced dead within ten minutes, and was transferred to an off-site graveyard. Following this incident, involuntary D-class testing has been phased out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Involuntary\u00a0Testing\u00a0Ban\u00a0Period\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 21\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will the cafeteria lunch be any good today?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Ask again later.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Null, results have not varied relative to test number 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 22\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Sheeran\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will I finally receive a promotion at the meeting tonight?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Outlook good.\"\n\n\nResult:\n On 1/24/2022, Dr. Sheeran received a promotion to the status of Level-4 Senior Researcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 23\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Sheeran\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Oh magic ball, will you ever do me wrong?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Dr. Sheeran retrieved SCP-7145 for testing excitedly, but left the storage facility after returning it to its locker markedly downtrodden. Dr. Sheeran would be \nstruck by a commuter bus\n on his drive home later that night, rendering him unable to continue service. Following this incident, all testing has been phased out. Requests to use SCP-7145 for testing must be directed to Dr. Patra for approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0By\u00a0Request\u00a0Only\u00a0Testing\u00a0Period\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 24\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will the cafeteria lunch be any good today?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Ask again later.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Null, results have not varied relative to test number 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 25\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Will the cafeteria lunch be any good today?\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Ask again later.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Null, results have not varied relative to test number 12.\n\n\n\n\n38 redundant logs redacted for brevity.\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 63\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Please, just tell me if the food is gonna be good or not.\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Ask again later.\"\n\n\nResult:\n Null, results have not varied relative to test number 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 64\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n \"Is the response to the next question I ask going to be 'ask again later?'\"\n\n\nOutput:\n \"Without a doubt.\"\n\n\nResult:\n This is the first deviation in output to testing wherein Dr. Patra is the subject. This caused Dr. Patra to stare at SCP-7145 for a considerable length of time, before performing test number 65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Number:\n 65\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Patra\n\n\nInput Statement:\n Null.

This is just embarrassing. God, and the fucking headache.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patra grabs her head gently, attempting to massage her temples.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wheeling:\n Hey, I've seen people come in here for far more embarrassing first-times. I promise this one's not as dumb as it could be. Although, what did you go and do that for in the first place?\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n I really don't want to answer that.\n\n\nDr. Wheeling:\n As much as I'd like to say I'm only asking out of curiosity, I'm also asking for procedure.

I have to keep going back! I'm not talking about your average unfulfilled curiosity, I don't have a choice! I can't just not go back and ask about my fucking lunch again.\n\n\nDr. Wheeling:\n If it helps, it wasn't the cafeteria's best ham and potatoes today.\n\n\nDr. Patra:\n Thanks for the gesture, but it doesn't help.

You've also got a pretty decent wound and a lot of bruising where you attempted to bash your skull in, which, come to think of it, I'm surprised actually isn't fractured.
