After reviewing my records for the last three years, I\u2019ve noticed that not once have I given a grade higher than B to a single Lexington act. Must be something in the water. Anyways: boring vocals, uninspiring riffs. There\u2019s worse screamo, but there\u2019s also much, much better. \nC+\n\n\nThe Death Tape\n [Born Loser Records, 12/16]\n\nLo-fi production does not a good mixtape make. \nC\n\n\nDeath On The Plains\n [Born Loser Records, 7/17]\n\nAccording to my partner (who has the unfortunate pleasure of spending his summer months in Lexington) Skendrix played Death On The Plains\u2019s release show in full faux-western getup, dusters and hats and all. They\u2019re committed to the gimmick \u2013 and it shows, with a full three tracks on the album being dedicated to Morricone-esque instrumentals haphazardly sowed to slightly atypical screamo yells. It doesn\u2019t \nnot\n work. \nB-\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nMylarama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMylarama\n\n\nQuiet Coughing, Slow Death\n [Born Loser Records, 4/17] \nC+\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\nQuiet Coughing, Slow Death\n [Born Loser Records, 9/17]\n\nSide project of the Lexington band Skendrix \u2013 which I\u2019ve been listening to a lot lately, despite what my prior reviews might indicate. This is a no-frills death metal album. Too no-frills: there\u2019s nothing here I haven\u2019t heard a thousand times before, and the end product is just uninspired. Would be a C, but it scratches a strange itch that I can\u2019t quite describe. \nC+\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nYou're Looking At It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're Looking At It\n\n\nSagittarius/Libra\n [Born Loser Records, 1/17] \nB+\n\n\nScreams and Silence\n [Born Loser Records, 5/17] \nF\n\n\nRecognized\n [Born Loser Records, 9/17] \nA\n\n\nThe Names\n [Born Loser Records, ?/17] \nD-\n\n\nSagittarius/Libra\n [Born Loser Records, 1/17]\n\nLexington post-hardcore, featuring Paul Mason, Skendrix\u2019s bassist. I enjoyed this album as a quasi-ambient experience: I changed my clock alarm to the title track, \u201cJames Axestone\u201d, and burned an .mp3 rip I made for my commute. There\u2019s something about it. \nB+\n\n\nScreams and Silence\n [Born Loser Records, 5/17]\n\nSorry for the recent spree of retro reviews \u2013 I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Skendrix and Skendrix-adjacent projects lately, and haven\u2019t had a chance to get to any fresh releases. I didn\u2019t like this album. I tried to make myself like it. I spent hours upon hours poring over every cut on the album, and didn\u2019t stop until my roommate informed me that it\u2019d been a whole three days since I\u2019d even left my bedroom.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t like it. It didn\u2019t sound right. It was missing something. And I figured out what it it was: Mason left the band in March, and Screams and Silence was recorded without his input. A few of his riffs are on there, but that\u2019s it. The living man was gone. The connection to Skendrix, cut. F\n\n\nRecognized\n [Born Loser Records, 9/17]\n\nEarly on in college I started smoking to make myself look cool as I figured it to be the one chemical vice that wouldn't fuck with my brain. This was stupid of me, because as it turns out there's a reason nicotine's a billion-dollar industry \u2014 it's a pain to kick, and it was six long months after my last pack before the cravings stopped.\n\nThen, one boring evening two years later, I drove to a drugstore in a town about an hour out from where I lived and bought a 14-count pack of nicotine patches. I stuck the entire box on my arm in the parking lot, and came in for a pack the next weekend. I kicked smoking in two months, but this time the cravings never quite went away.\n\nThis was all my deliberate decision. To this day I still don't entirely understand why I did it, although I was very much present in the moment.\n\nI feel like I am smoking very often now. This is the power of good music, or perhaps not exactly good \u2014 \npowerful\n music, I guess you could call it. I am developing a theory around this. Good music provides an enjoyable experience \u2014 but powerful music, which I think this is, \nreplaces\n experience. I've stopped listening to music when I drive \u2014 it makes it incredibly difficult to concentrate on the road. I veer left and right in tune to the vocals and accelerate to match the BPM, which led me to nearly rear-end a tractor-trailer in my used Civic going to work last Tuesday. In light of this I have, for now, resigned. I plan to make this my full-time career.\n\nI am rambling. \nA\n\n\nThe Names\n [Born Loser Records, ?/17]\n\nThis is the last review I will ever do of any Skendrix-affiliated band (or Skendrix itself, for that matter) period. I\u2019ve started to hear Death On The Plains quietly, in moments of total silence \u2013 chunks and wisps of songs, pieces of disconnected riffs. I have zero memory of anything I've written in the last week.\n\nAnd it still doesn\u2019t sound good. Imagine that: falling to such a level of total obsession that all you can hear is mediocre screamo. Not an enviable fate. So I\u2019m going cold turkey.\n\nThis is a demo tape of You\u2019re Looking At It that I recovered in some sort of web-frenzy. I remember it only vaguely: nerves fried off of a pot of black coffee at 4 am, scrolling through the band\u2019s Facebook, looking for even the roughest track or cut. \u201cTotal obsession\u201d may be underselling it.\n\nIt\u2019s not good. The lyrics are awful. The production is hideous, lo-fi or not. I listened to it once. I don\u2019t feel the need to listen to it again. \nD-\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nSkendrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkendrix\n\n\nAnd So We Go\n [Born Loser Records, 8/16] \nC+\n\n\nThe Death Tape\n [Born Loser Records, 12/16] \nC\n\n\nDeath On The Plains\n [Born Loser Records, 7/17] \nB-\n\n\nMusic\n [Independent, 12/17] \nA+\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\nAnd So We Go\n [Born Loser Records, 8/16]\n\nI don\u2019t really recognize myself in the mirror any more. I have headphones on all the time now. My roommate leaves food at the door. The landlord knocks and I don\u2019t listen.\n\n\nThe Death Tape\n [Born Loser Records, 12/16]\n\nThere are signals in the noise.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened yesterday: my loving partner of 3 years came by. He knocked on the door, looked in, saw me, and broke down sobbing. He held me in his arms and begged me to take off the headphones \u2013 which I did, to the surprise of even myself. He carried me out on his shoulders, my emaciated body bony against him, and exhaled only once he\u2019d put my seatbelt on for me.\n\nWe drove to his building and sat in the parking lot for a while. Things were silent until I started crying. It was my fault, I said, and always had been \u2013 I\u2019d gotten used to giving up so much for my career that eventually I\u2019d go a bridge too far and start neglecting the very basic fundamentals of my self. It\u2019d happened before. I\u2019d gone two days without eating, once. Apathy and a quiet unease with my figure made it easy. It was an interesting feeling, letting myself go for my work. I was a bullet in flight, clear, glassy-eyed \u2013 dedicated uncompromisingly to a single goal.\n\nHe\u2019d stopped me then. It was our third date. I told him about it quite casually after I\u2019d asked him not to make me anything, as I didn\u2019t want to be a bother. An hour later, sitting in his arms, I promised to see a therapist.\n\n\u2013 When was the last time you talked to her?\n\n\u2013 A few months, maybe. Not since this all started. I\u2019m sorry. Are you mad?\n\nWe cried, for a while. He made pasta, his eyes still red from tears. He looked skinny, too. And I promised not to even think about music for the next month, maybe, while he tried to see what we \u2013 us, together, as a team \u2013 could do about the unpaid bills and my pending eviction.\n\n\nDeath On The Plains\n [Born Loser Records, 7/17]\n\nI pretended to fall asleep. I knew his rhythms \u2013 the quiet snores, the rustling, the way his arms would grab me and soothe me to sleep when the stress had been too much. I shrugged them off my body and snuck out the window.\n\nThe sun was cresting in the distance when I arrived back at my apartment, my bare feet covered in sores and bruises from the seven-mile walk down the highway.\n\nI bolted my door. I deleted his contact from my phone, and for good measure, threw it out the window.\n\n\nMusic\n [Independent, 12/17]\n\nIt\u2019s always playing. They cut the power a week ago, but it\u2019s still playing. I can hardly move. My throat burns from thirst \u2013 no water, too, either. It\u2019s still playing. I can always hear it, no matter what. The perfect volume, not too loud. I don\u2019t like it loud. It hurts my ears when it\u2019s loud.\n\nHe liked it loud. I remember that he liked it loud and when we would drive somewhere we would have not-all-that-serious fights about the volume.\n\n\u2013 If you don\u2019t turn it down I\u2019ll kiss you.\n\n\u2013 So what. Try it. Kiss me.\n\nWe would usually end up kissing, most or all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
