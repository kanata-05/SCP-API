Any infringement is to be considered a lost cause.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-8523 is a gravitational phenomenon observed in the ocean of the terrestrial planet HD 50655 Ad, located 20 light-years away from Earth. SCP-8523 is activated when an object crosses HD 50655 Ad's bathypelagic zone\n1\n, correspondingly adjusting the gravitational pull for the object to sink indefinitely.\n\n\nRegarding its effects on living beings, it is currently believed either SCP-8523 does not affect any form of organic matter anywise or the several creatures inhabiting HD 50655 Ad's deep ocean have simply adapted to survive in an anomalous environment.\n\n\nFinally, the very behavior of other laws of physics and matter itself in the areas affected by SCP-8523 is equally deviant from Normalcy \u2014 but throughout irregular periods of time. Extensive investigation of this phenomenon is being conducted; for detailed information on its nature, see the section below.\n\n\n\n\nItem History:\n\n\nOn September 6, 2344, the United States Space Administration (USSA) designated the astronauts Agatha Ripley and Leah Weaver to the Nyx Project, a human spaceflight program intended to discover extraterrestrial life on the ocean world\n2\nHD 50655 Ad following the detection of high concentrations of dimethyl sulfide\n3\n by Elizabeth Kane Telescope.\n\n\nAlthough the operation was primarily focused on remote data gathering and field researches of the mesopelagic zone\n4\n, Weaver eventually embarked on the submarine Nyx 1 to commence exploration of the deep sea, activating SCP-8523. This led to the mission being called off on October 9, 2353.\n\n\nThe Foundation would only discover SCP-8523 on December 24, 2363, following suspicions regarding the inconclusive details released about Weaver's death and the immediate disappearance of Ripley from the media after her arrival in the past month.\n\n\nThe following transcriptions were conceded by the USSA for archival and further research. The original footage was recovered with the help of the multi-information system interconnecting Nyx 1 to the spaceship Hermes 1, where Ripley was stationed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG NUMBER #1\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n July 27th, 2353\n\n\nNOTES:\n Upon reaching a depth of 1,336\u00a0m, Nyx 1 began preparations to return to the surface. SCP-8523 is seen for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nWeaver is sitting on a chair in a white room built out of titanium. In front of her, instrument panels to operate the submarine functions are adjacent to a sonar, displaying readouts of her route and position. She is tampering with the ballast control while monitoring the readouts but stops after a few minutes to reach for the communicator, a confused look on her face.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Hermes 1, do you hear me?\n\n\nRipley:\n I do. Any problem?\n\n\nWeaver:\n I'm not going up. 1,339\u00a0m as of now.\n\n\nRipley:\n Have you double-checked?\n\n\nWeaver:\n Yeah. I'm sinking\u2014\n\n\nShe turns to check her position again on the sonar when an abrupt ping reverberates through the sub. It is the proximity alarm.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Hold on.\n\n\nRipley:\n What's wrong?\n\n\nThe alarm pings twice. It is closer. There is a beat of silence, then it pings three more times.\n\n\nRipley:\n Nyx 1?\n\n\nWeaver:\n There's something around here.\n\n\nWeaver takes a photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRipley:\n What is it?\n\n\nWeaver:\n I wouldn't know. It's well hidden.\n\n\nThe pinging stops. The presence remains in the sonar for a few seconds, then disappears.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Weird. It seems to be gone.\n\n\nRipley:\n I'm preparing the ROVs\n5\n. Hang in there.\n\n\nWeaver:\n You sure that's necessary already?\n\n\nRipley:\n Better safe than sorry. Just call me if you need anything, okay?\n\n\nWeaver:\n Sure.\n\n\nThree hours pass as Ripley prepares all the equipment, coming back from time to time to check on Weaver. She is nervous, restlessly tapping her fingers against the panel. Nyx 1 is at a depth of 1,391\u00a0m when the ROV Soteria 2 is finally launched, with Soteria 1 prepared to intervene and support its sister at all times.\n\n\nRipley:\n How are you feeling?\n\n\nWeaver:\n A bit anxious.\n\n\nRipley:\n Oh, my love. Wanna talk about it?\n\n\nHer fingers stop. She lets out a sharp exhale.\n\n\nWeaver:\n I just don't know what to expect.\n\n\nRipley:\n It's not because our future is unknown that it'll hurt us. My mom loved to say that.\n\n\nWeaver:\n She also loved to say you're a magnet for 'weird stuff'. Maybe that's why all of this is happening, at the end of the day.\n\n\nRipley:\n \u2026 You remember she would include you among the 'weird stuff' too, don't you?\n\n\nWeaver:\n I do, and I prefer to ignore that part.\n\n\nThe two laugh. A few seconds later, a sharp noise echoes across the sub, followed by a faint scratching. Soteria 2 has arrived, and Weaver follows Ripley's instructions for the next few minutes without any complications.\n\n\nRipley:\n What's your position, please?\n\n\nWeaver:\n 1,419\u00a0m. Sinking yet again.\n\n\nRipley:\n Alright, sending Soteria 1 down there.\n\n\nThe sonar displays an amorphous presence nearby, but there's no pinging from the alarm. Weaver doesn't seem to notice it, and then it quickly surrounds Nyx 1 before fading away.\n\n\nRipley:\n It's ready. Where are you?\n\n\nWeaver:\n 1,431\u00a0m. What about the ROVs?\n\n\nRipley:\n Both are at 1,425\u00a0m.\n\n\nThe proximity alarm pings.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Hold on.\n\n\nShe takes a photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaver:\n There are three\u2026 things nearby. They're small. Also remind me of a hive.\n\n\nShe zooms in on the photo.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Should we investigate?\n\n\nRipley:\n You're the priority for now, so ignore the mission. I'll just change our route.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Roger that.\n\n\nShe sighs.\n\n\nWeaver:\n But what a shame.\n\n\nRipley:\n Relax. We'll have time for them later.\n\n\nThe operation is conducted for the following hour with no further results. The two are silent throughout, and the sound of water crashing against the sub is prevalent, heavy and close.\n\n\nRipley:\n Can we call it a day, Leah?\n\n\nWeaver:\n Do I have a choice?\n\n\nRadio silence for a few moments.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Sorry. I'm just nervous.\n\n\nRipley:\n Hey, hey. It'll be fine. Accidents happen.\n\n\nWeaver:\n It's worse when you're far from home.\n\n\nWeaver pauses and shakes her head. Silence.\n\n\nWeaver:\n What you always say when I'm down?\n\n\nRipley:\n Love today, and seize all tomorrows.\n\n\nWeaver nods to herself, sighing. A slight smile.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Okay then. I will try my best.\n\n\nRipley:\n \nWe\n will. Tomorrow is another day.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Collection #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,772\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3,220\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,857\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,933\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG NUMBER #2\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n August 5th, 2353\n\n\nNOTES:\n Following the loss of communication with Soteria 1 and 2 on August 1st, as well as two other fruitless rescue attempts on August 2nd and 4th, a message was sent to the USSA asking for support. The average response time is two months. Nyx 1 is at a depth of 6,038\u00a0m.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nWeaver is lying against a wall in the command room, reading a book. She has an exhausted look on her face, noticeable bags under her eyes, and her curly, big red hair is mussed up. As soon as Hermes 1's communicator turns on, she yawns and gets up to sit on her chair.\n\n\nRipley:\n Morning. How are you today?\n\n\nWeaver:\n Hey honey. Still tired, but I've found some motivation to keep reading your books.\n\n\nRipley:\n Oh, what are you reading now?\n\n\nWeaver:\n \nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\n, by Jules Verne. It's a very old one.\n\n\nRipley:\n Won't that one make you feel paranoid?\n\n\nWeaver:\n It's been surprisingly helpful, actually. Reading relatable experiences is always good.\n\n\nWeaver smiles as she lets out another yawn.\n\n\nWeaver:\n But now that you mention it, you think giving me this doomed me? By any chance?\n\n\nRipley:\n Come on, that's nonsense.\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\nRipley:\n It's a funny coincidence though.\n\n\nWeaver:\n \nFunny\n?\n\n\nRipley:\n It's a dark one, sure! But mostly funny.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Being weird really is your charm, huh.\n\n\nRipley:\n Not this again\u2014\n\n\nThe sub is suddenly hit by something outside, moving back and forth as Weaver is thrown to the ground and her head crashes against the panel. The proximity alarm begins to ping over and over, its echoing overlayed by that of the security alarms illuminating the room in red.\n\n\nRipley:\n Leah?! Are you okay?!\n\n\nWeaver groans in pain as she gets up.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Something hit me!\n\n\nShe takes a photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaver:\n What the hell?\n\n\nRipley:\n What's wrong?\n\n\nWeaver:\n It's\u2026 I dunno, it's like\u2014\n\n\nRipley:\n Fuck that. Are you alright?\n\n\nWeaver places her hands on her head, letting out a frustrated sigh. Her legs are shaking.\n\n\nRipley:\n My love?\n\n\nShe sniffles as her eyes become teary.\n\n\nRipley:\n Hey, hey. Don't cry. It's gone now, okay?\n\n\nRipley assists Weaver with a few breathing exercises for the next few minutes, the latter hugging herself throughout, hidden between her thighs. Once she is relaxed, she takes a deep breath and rubs her now reddish eyes.\n\n\nRipley:\n Feeling better?\n\n\nWeaver:\n A lot. Thanks for taking care of me.\n\n\nRipley:\n It's what I'm here for. I love you.\n\n\nWeaver smiles.\n\n\nWeaver:\n I love you, too.\n\n\nRipley:\n So, wanna read together again?\n\n\nWeaver:\n Oh\u2014 that's a good idea. And we can read Frankenstein later, too. It's your favorite.\n\n\nRipley:\n I'm glad you remembered!\n\n\nWeaver:\n Rip, we're married.\n\n\nRipley:\n That reminds me our birthday is just around the corner\u2026 only three more weeks.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Don't you mean 'anniversary'?\n\n\nRipley:\n Same word in Portuguese. It's tricky.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Tenho que praticar mais, ali\u00e1s\n6\n.\n\n\nRipley:\n Tem mesmo, mas n\u00e3o agora \u2014 c\u00ea sabe que eles \ndetestam\n quando a gente faz isso\n7\n.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Qual\u00e9, s\u00e9rio mesmo\n8\n?\n\n\nRipley:\n N\u00e3o quero levar outro esporro n\u00e3o\n9\n.\n\n\nWeaver:\n But you're speaking it already.\n\n\nRipley:\n Oh fuck.\n\n\nWeaver chuckles, leaning back on her chair.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Anyway, we're old.\n\n\nRipley:\n I'm not adding up those hypersleep years to my age, so I'd say I'm still kicking.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Your white hair tells me otherwise.\n\n\nRipley:\n Don't do me like that.\n\n\nThe two laugh, and a few hours pass as they talk and read together. They say good night to each other eventually, agreeing to conduct a rescue attempt the next day. Silence follows.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Collection #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7,792\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7,989\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8,411\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9,001\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG NUMBER #3\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n August 12th, 2353\n\n\nNOTES:\n The rescue attempt of August 6th has failed as well.

Then another one falls, and yet another. It lasts for an hour, but the dripping is still present afterwards, now heavier. The proximity alarm pings, and the sonar is occupied by an amorphous presence.\n\n\nFor the first time, Nyx 1 stops sinking, and there is only silence until a sharp, guttural sound is heard outside, echoing and coming back to itself in a moment. The sub shudders and goes back to sinking; the water flows yet again, faster; and the presence moves away.\n\n\nHalf an hour later, hurried footsteps are heard from the hallway leading to the command room. When the door opens, Weaver is seen with her body covered in sweat. She seems to be experiencing an episode of sleepwalking and begins to cough aggressively, her knees shaking. She places her hands over her belly and vomits water on the floor before leaving.\n\n\nAfter three hours, Weaver is back at the room. The water has completely evaporated at this point, and she turns on her communicator.\n\n\nWeaver:\n Are you there?\n\n\nRipley:\n Yep. What's wrong honey?\n\n\nWeaver:\n I'm scared.\n\n\nRipley pauses and sighs, remorse in her voice.\n\n\nRipley:\n I know, my love.

Her expression is reluctant.\n\n\nWeaver:\n I don't wanna give you even more problems. You're not feeling good too, are you?\n\n\nRipley:\n It doesn't matter. You're not a burden.\n\n\nWeaver covers her face with her hands, and takes a deep breath. Her shoulders are tense.\n\n\nRipley:\n 'For sickness and in health, and not even death do us part.'

They lasted for a good couple of years, and it was a pain in the ass to go through the night terror over and over. But \none\n day, it went away and never came back.

Weaver jumps into the water to swim towards the door, and when she arrives, she presses her hand against the scanner.\n\n\nThe door opens in an instant, and there is a small white room filled with several boxes and shelves with supplies and medical equipment, protected by locks and glass.

Weaver seems to hesitate at first, but turns the communicator off and leans against the wall.\n\n\nRipley:\n Why\u2014\n\n\nAn implosion is heard, followed by the brief, moist sound of Weaver's body being crushed. Communication with Nyx 1 is lost definitely, and the recording's point of view switches to Hermes 1. Footage shows a large room where several stars are visible through the windows. Ripley is shaking, and her breath begins to fail.\n\n\nRipley:\n No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\u2026\n\n\nRipley:\n Are you there?! Leah are you there?!\n\n\nRipley:\n Answer me!
