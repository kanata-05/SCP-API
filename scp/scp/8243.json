Due to the historically low threat posed by the object, more urgent duties may take precedence if needed, but retrieval is not to be delayed without cause.\n\n\nThe website \"www.geocaching.com\"\n1\n is under continuous monitoring by the automated \"ChestSeeker\" script, and is to remain so. In addition to alerting containment staff to the details of each remanifestation, the script also automatically hides the newly generated listing from the general public. Activities and websites similar and/or alternative to Geocaching\n2\n are to be preemptively monitored as well.\n\n\nUpon request and analysis, the agent tasked with recovering an SCP-8243 manifestation may be allowed to keep its contents, as long as they pose no form of threat and confirm fully non-anomalous.\n3\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8243 is a roughly 18cmx12cmx7cm plastic food container with a locking lid. Outside of remanifestation events it is completely inert, and ignoring minor identifying details, indistinguishable from similar non-anomalous containers.\n\n\nSCP-8243's anomalous properties activate roughly once a week. Whether assembled or not, all of its constituent components spontaneously vanish, and reappear concealed at a seemingly random hiding location near a facility with stationed Foundation personnel. To date, this has included locations around the Earth, beyond the Earth, and within said Foundation facilities\n4\n.\n\n\nFurthermore, two secondary effects are observed: First, SCP-8243 is filled with an assortment of minor items, usually confectioneries\n5\n, small toys, novelty items, and souvenirs from the country the remanifestation event takes place in. Second, a listing is generated on the website \"geocaching.com\", highly similar to those of regular geocaches, offering information regarding some nearby civilian point of interest, and more crucially, details, hints, puzzles and possibly direct GPS coordinates intended to help locate SCP-8243.\n\n\nUpon being recovered, SCP-8243 remains inert until next remanifestation.\n\n\nSelect Addenda:\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a08243.4\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Remanifestation\u00a0Events\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a08243.4\u00a0Log\u00a0of\u00a0Remanifestation\u00a0Events\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifestation Number\n\n\nGeocache Type\n\n\nHiding Location\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nTree stump\n\n\nAccompanied with a private message addressed to a personal Geocaching account of a Foundation researcher stationed nearby. So far the only manifestation to be announced directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nPark bench\n\n\nFirst manifestation containing edible items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nMulti\n\n\nUnderpass of an urban road\n\n\nFirst manifestation of the Multi-Cache type, requiring multiple locations to be visited. Locations consisted of famous landmarks of Prague, Czech Republic. Noted as a \"pleasant experience\" by recovering agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nMystery\n\n\nFake breaker box compartment on a public street\n\n\nFirst Mystery Cache type, requiring a puzzle to be solved. Recovering agent, an occasional geocacher, completed retrieval in a high-visibility vest and work overalls. Disguise recommended for future use in urban environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nSide of a brook\n\n\nAgent mentioned SCP-8243 contained his favorite confectioneries. As a precaution, previous recovering agents contacted. Nearly all confirmed similar affinity to contents of SCP-8243 as per their finds. Research on SCP-8243 elevated in priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nCrevice dug out in an ice sheet\n\n\nSCP-8243 manifested in Antarctica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nWherigo\n\n\nTree stump\n\n\nFirst Wherigo Cache type. Recovery complicated by technical issues with the Wherigo website and the \"cartridge\" file. Noted standard for the geocache type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nLetterbox Hybrid\n\n\nNear a public lookout tower, under a large rock\n\n\nFirst Letterbox Hybrid type. \"ChestSeeker\" script updated to work on websites similar/related to Geocaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n\n\nMystery\n\n\nFake birdhouse\n\n\nAgent recovered a golden wedding ring from SCP-8243. After examination, recognized the ring as her own, having lost it in the year prior. Allowed to keep it after analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\nMystery\n\n\nTree, suspended by a pulley mechanism, along with other containers\n\n\nMechanism belonged to a non-anomalous geocache hidden in the same manner at the same location. Hider contacted and archived visitor logs cross-referenced. Visitors noted to have included a number of Foundation staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\nMulti\n\n\nMissing section of a wall, hidden by a brick\n\n\nNotable for having manifested in FP-01, Three Portlands. Recovery completed by the Unusual Incidents Unit on Foundation request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nSite-19 cafeteria, under a table\n\n\nResearch priority increased. Staff interrupted during lunch quickly introduced to the nature of SCP-8243 by recovering agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\nMulti\n\n\nAbandoned lakeside fast food stall\n\n\nSCP-8243 contained a handwritten note. Writing cross-referenced as per standard procedure, providing a 99.8% match to Ji\u0159\u00ed Ondr\u00e1\u010dek, a late Foundation researcher.

Naturally, not everyone involved found it as amusing as you would have hoped, either. As Foundation staff, we have ultimately had to treat SCP-8243 as any other object requiring our attention. We're sure you understand.\n\n\nThat said, we confess that many field agents we've sent to recover the hides claimed to enjoy the experience.
