Only the word \"ledger\" was directly taken, however.\n\n\nThe word \"Hypercat\" comes from Counter/Weight Episode Zero: If Han Solo Used to be Beyonc\u00e9 from the podcast Friends at the Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8132\n\n\nContainment Class:\n Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront Cover of SCP-8132.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\nThe physical location of SCP-8132 is to be kept secret from any Foundation personnel working at Site-43. As such, the current head of MAUDE\n1\n (at time of writing, Gregory J. Chudley) is to assign it a new location in a minimal-maintenance anomalous items storage warehouse at least once every six months, where it is to be kept within a nested series of containers at least three deep.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-8132 is a book, measuring 11 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 1 inches (sic). The book, entitled, \"Vikander-Kneed Technical Media Presents: The ViKarious ToMe\u2122\", consists of a rulebook for a tabletop role-playing game.\n\n\nEven though scans have shown it to have sixty pages, a person opening the book will find it to have a number of pages ranging from five to a theoretical infinite number with cardinality \u2135\n1\n. Page numbers range from one to five, inclusive, but are not restricted to integers\n2\n.\n\n\nMeasurements of the item, and in ideas derived from it, can only be reported in US Customary Units.\n\n\nTesting has shown ideas based on the ruleset within to have a highly infoallergenic properties\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8132's illustration accompanying one creature of its' bestiary, the Hummingoat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8132-1:\n\n\n \n\n\nAs most of the noteworthy events concerning SCP-8132 also concerned the containment of another anomaly, the information related to that anomaly's time of containment within Site-43 is included herein.\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n ajmcinnis@43NET\n\n\nFrom:\n \nten.PiCS|ttekcarbr#ten.PiCS|ttekcarbr\n\n\nSubject:\n Request for temporary containment transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Director McInnis,\n\n\nHello. I am the head of the \nSCP-7132\n project.\n\n\n\n\nEvery three days, the current individual known as SCP-7132 spontaneously combusts and is replaced by a different person.\n\n\nUnless we help each person through their personal emotional problems and traumas, upon this combustion, worldwide consequences result. (Termination of its' form beforehand negates this, but is a last resort.)\n\n\nAt present, SCP-7132 is stuck reincarnating into the same form: a ten-year-old child who wants to be told the greatest story ever. We have read her all the books we can think of, have played her every important stage drama, and yet she remains unsatisfied.\n\n\n\n\nAs our Site has failed to comfort this iteration, and as your Site is known for unconventional containment solutions, would you be interested in taking this iteration on? It's minimal maintenance for a Keter-class anomaly, which will raise your credibility in the statistics come budget time.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nSite-81 Senior Supervisor Rita Brackett\n\n\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8132's illustration accompanying one creature of its' bestiary, the Sommelier.

She stares not at the cascade of the seating, but at the abyss of the stage.\n\n\nChief Ibanez:\n It's just water, you know.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I know.\n\n\nChief Ibanez:\n It's been water since you started watching ten minutes ago, and it's going to be water ten minutes from now.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I know.\n\n\nChief Ibanez:\n So why stare into the drain?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Because that gurgle is always a different gurgle. That flow is always a different flow. And yet in spite of all its' variation, it is constant.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I stared down the storm drains of my own neighborhood, before I died.

Do you want to visit those?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n What would be the point?\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Same point as looking into a storm drain.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n There's a difference.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n What difference?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n So much less control.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I get overwhelmed by stimuli easily, especially when I don't choose the stimuli. Waterfalls are huge and loud, and going there is your idea, not mine. But the storm drain? That's all my idea. Nobody else plans for it, so there's less pressure, and I can stand safely above the chaos, master of all I see.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n I don't know about that. There's beauty in the things you can't control or tame. That's what my wife told me just before the divorce.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n What is the use of beauty, when you're too scared and overwhelmed to appreciate it?\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n And that's what I told her, just before the divorce.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n How did she take it?\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n She divorced me.

Darn, I was hoping Djoric would get the first move.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n One morning at Site-\u2026 Site-44, Dr. Xettle got up and thought, \"You know, I think people will respect me more if I make more of an effort to go to the gym!\"\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Gordon moves to crush Djoric with the paw of her own hypercat!\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n And so, Dr. Xettle went.

And those paths don't travel to a success region of the brain or a failure region, but connect a truly multifarious, byzantine network of regions that say, \"focus\" or \"remember\" or \"pretend to your significant other that you don't have a truly spectacular collection of pornography hidden behind his bathroom mirror.\"\n\n\nOur patented method of fictional-character mentalism is reproduced below. If living human skin is not available, you can use a very low-threshold memory foam. Make sure the side lengths of the square representing the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus are exact, or the earthworms may overexert themselves trying to reach it, and then the stitches holding them to the spiders will come undone.

Where are Xettle and Stormbreath? This is their presentation, after all.\n\n\nDr. Clank:\n Xettle? That gorgeous hunk of mutton should be here any moment.\n\n\nP6-3:\n You don't keep the Panopticator Directorate waiting! He should know that by now!\n\n\n13:20:00:\n \nDjoric Stormbreath lands her Hypercat, sheathing her katanas as she does so. Dr. Xettle steps down from the Hypercat's talons, clutching tightly to lab equipment.\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n Sorry we're late, fellow scientists; Jordan C. Gordon's friend Gordon C. Jordan- whose voice sounds surprisingly close to that of Dr. Xettle attempting a bad French accent- waylaid us, trying to steal our evidence.\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n \u2026Yes. How\u2026 unfortunate. I, Dr. Xettle, in a way completely in character, was appalled by Gordon's actions. And I thought that accent was pretty convincing\u2026\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n Ladies and gentlemen of Panopticon, our reality is nothing but a tabletop role-playing game in the mind of an idiot and a genius.\n\n\nP6-2:\n Can you show us evidence that we're in such a fantasy as you describe?\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n Of- of course.\n\n\n13:25:\n \nDr. Xettle wheels in a cart containing a live fulvous whistling-duck, a graduated cylinder of green oil, a pipette, and a clear rectangular container divided into twenty-nine vertical sections.\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n Watch carefully.\n\n\n13:25-13:27:\n \nDr. Xettle drops one droplet of oil at a time onto the back of the duck; these droplets fall into each of the twenty-nine rectangular sections. Soon, a curve forms, as some sections fill up more quickly than others.\n\n\nP6-2:\n What is the significance of this display?\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n This is the standard method of determining the accuracy of a ranged attack in the rules of TDQ-XXXY. As you see, repetition over time creates this probability curve. Now, if one or more of you would take this blindfold\u2026\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n Although we completely understand if none of you want to submit to such an indignity\u2026\n\n\nP6-4:\n No, I'll do it.\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n\u2026 Great. Just great. Exactly what I wanted to hear.\n\n\n13:28:\n \nDr. Djoric Stormbreath proceeds to blindfold P6-4, and has him throw a large quantity of darts at a target. There is a laser sensor array indicating how close each one comes to the center of the target, and plotting the frequency of each value on a histogram. Rather than a continuous spectrum, there are only twenty-nine discrete values.\n\n\nP6-13:\n It's the exact same curve as the duck method made!\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n Precisely.\n\n\nP6-12:\n And this coincidence of probability is how you know we're in a sort of analog simulation?\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n Not only that.\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n One would imagine that every duck in existence has a slightly different body shape and mannerisms.\n\n\nP6-13:\n Naturally.\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n Then would it surprise you to learn that as of the end of today's testing of a sample of forty-three ducks, \neach one produces the same curve?\n\n\nMillihammer:\n Meaning what?\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n Ladies and gentlemen, all ducks seem like individual ducks, because the masters of reality can describe one as different compared to one another.\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n But whoever they are, they can't describe with their words what a random result looks like. They have to run the duck test each time we do. \nAnd they only have one duck.\n\n\nDr. Millihammer:\n But if we're saying this is a tabletop role-playing game, they don't need to do the test every single time, do they? That would get really boring. They can just say, \"Oh, this one's curve is slightly higher than that one and has slightly more bumps on the left side than on the right\", and we, in-universe, won't know the difference.\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n Yes, that's how yesterday's tests went. All the curves were slightly different. I thought about calling the whole thing off\u2026\n\n\nDr. Djoric Stormbreath:\n But that urge was completely against his character. \nAny strenuous decision will prove that, Dr. Xettle.\n So we changed the approach of the experimental setup today.\n\n\nDr. Millihammer:\n How?\n\n\nDr. Xettle:\n I\u2026 I kept them on the hook by doing interesting things in between every roll.\n\n\nTIME:\n 14:30:00\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8132-9: Excerpts from materials produced by testing sessions 8132-23 through 8132-46, by Dr. Wettle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuck\n\n\nTest Number\n\n\nInterest Renewal Ritual\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaddlorf\n\n\n7\n\n\nExperimenter began taking sword-fighting lessons from Djoric Stormbreath, who introduced experimenter to the seventeen-sword technique as an easy-to-learn prelude to the five-sword technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremiah Q.

I don't even have \nmyself\n in the void. My time is all spent in what Xettle would do, what Xettle would say\u2026 and as the character gets more established, she's allowing me less and less wiggle room. I'm trapped putting my energy into Xettle, and I'm missing everything that made him fun.\n\n\nDr. Reynders:\n I hear, though, that the core of these games is just talking. Just having a conversation with another person. That's the difference between playing the ToMe\u2122 and writing a novel.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n She won't let me.

A request to tell her a great story was so exciting of an opportunity for them, they didn't want to conceive that there were other layers to the solution.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Huh.

She loved stories, but stories grew hollow. It was either the same thing over and over again, or it was a maddening digression from what she wanted to read.\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n She once got a high from reading, but that passed. The stage and screen feel dull. She had to consume ever more to get the same novelty in the details, but in such large quantities she felt overwhelmed. Shut down. The rivers either rose from the storm drains roaring for blood, or left them bone dry.\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n Your character, Wettle, asked my character why she stopped reading. And that was when the overwhelm in her memory rushed back. She knew she wanted the greatest story, but\u2026 every session, she realized, less and less got done. So she seized control of the game the best she could, to keep things on track. To keep the one thing that remained to her \nsafe.\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n If you bring in a bunch more people to talk and distract, all you're going to do is shut me out of the one thing I feel safe in.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Oh, crap, I didn't think of that.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n It makes sense. Like the folks at Site-81, we're not psychologists; we're just shoehorning our own fun into this ghost's therapy session.\n\n\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n Right.\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n But this Teal Orphan character\u2026 they seem to have punished my character's decision to do this, though I can't think of why. So maybe your character's plan does have some merit. If so, it needs to be introduced in small doses so my character doesn't feel overwhelmed. It needs to come without any pressure to her at all: If she doesn't feel it's working, we can drop it and go back to the default for a while. And it needs to be, at the beginning, directed by me. I need to feel in control.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n That\u2026 that makes sense. How do you want to start?\n\n\n\n\nRBO-7131:\n Something like:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n And at that point, Dr. Clank admitted the one great sticking point in his attraction to Dr. Xettle.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n I'm attracted to you, Xilliam, and I can see us in a relationship together. It's just\u2026 I don't understand your fascination with storm drains. What do you see in them? They're just so goddamn boring.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n To which Dr. Xettle replies:\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n When I stare into a storm drain, Iarry, the sunlight flashes upon the roaring water in the darkness\u2026 and I imagine it's your eyes as you ride towards me through the void.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n You\u2026 you stare into storm drains, Wettle?\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Of- of course not, Blank, she made it up for the sake of a sample topic!\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n Shame\u2026 that was a good line\u2026\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Well, truth be told-\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Ok, but can we talk about how she's writing events from a narrative layer above us? Doesn't that seem at all important to anyone? Are we fiction?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Of course not. That's just the way I felt the most in control expressing my thoughts, by imagining I was a narrative god.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n That's how we'll start.

The characters of Dr. Xettle and Dr. Stormbreath try to make preparations to ascend; however, they are obstructed from doing so by having to react to the actions of the remaining thirty-seven player characters, each of which has a separate agenda and \nmodus operandi\n.\n\n\n10/20/2012:\n Twelve test personnel unite in a common goal and have their player characters go on a mission to steal the rights of the names from popular franchise \nThe Mord of the Sings\n from the current holders, Uolkein Fnterprises, so that they can finally use the words \"Iobbit\", \"Fnt\", and \"Calrog\".\n\n\n11/30/2012:\n Dr. Xettle's efforts, far too distracted to complete his own ascension, manifest in his own player character, Dr. Yilliam Y. Yettle, ascending to his plane. Dr. Yettle is immediately promoted to Panopticon Directorate status. Dr. Xettle plans to try again with Dr. Zettle, now ascended to Dr. Yettle's former narrative plane.\n\n\n01/30/2013:\n In spite of Dr. Wettle's prediction, Dr. Xettle and Dr. Djoric Stormbreath, having been repeatedly waylaid, arrested, lost, transmogrified, and mailed to the Zukon of Danada, have been far too busy to complete the ascension process.\n\n\n01/30/2013:\n SCP-7132 has been enjoying the story for months, and has undergone her PHOENIX events without incident regularly.\n\n\nResearcher's note:\n\n\nThanks, everyone! - Dr. Wettle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8132-16: Excerpt from SCP-8132, pg. 3.141592653589793\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Transitioning From the Basic Ruleset To the Advanced Ruleset\n\n\nLet's drop the pretense for a moment.\n\n\nNobody \nneeds\n this ruleset. If you want to tell stories with your friends, you can go and tell stories with your friends without paying us a penny.\n\n\nAll we are is the cardboard that makes up your rocket ship. We provide the stiffness so you can cut us up with scissors to form cones, fins, and windows. You don't need us to have fun.\n\n\nBut at the same time, you need us very much.\n\n\nYou need an \nexcuse\n to exercise your imagination with your friends. You need some way of making sure that you're all prim and respectable to the outside world. You aren't a child anymore; your playtime must have rigorous rules. You need to feel like you're taking a gamble when your characters' actions fail, rather than failing when you feel it makes sense in the story. If you choose when your character fails, after all, aren't you a born loser? And when your character succeeds all the time, aren't they a Mary Sue?\n\n\nSo we will be your excuse and your crutch. We have rules for every situation, should you begin to worry that this is all so childish. If you desire it, we have rules so dense so that a character cannot sneeze without having to make some sort of gamble. And you will feel that that sneeze is inherently better than if you had done it independently; this sneeze was in accordance with the \nrules.\n\n\nBut there is a price, as with all crutches.\n\n\nThe price of basing your ideas off of our rules is that your ideas are based off of our rules.\n\n\nAnd therefore, we own them.\n\n\nEvery gamble you make based on our ruleset is marked in a dusty ledger. Every roleplay, we log.\n\n\nAnd as you have made our rules come to life, we live a little through you every session.\n\n\nDon't look behind you, you won't see anyone.\n\n\nYou are completely and utterly alone in this room.\n\n\nIsn't that right, Dr. Wettle?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8132-17:\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/10/2013\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Okay. Starting recording\u2026\n\n\nDr. Okorie:\n Vdo Pkorie whispers to Dr. Clank, \"Now's your moment.\"\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n All right, Dr. Clank comes up to Dr. Xettle.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Hey, Dr. Clank.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n Hey, Xillie.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n I grab popcorn and go to the security room to watch.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n I'm sorry I haven't been there for you in these past months. You all have kept me so busy\u2026\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n Hey, it's okay.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n And it wasn't until Kettle ascended and became Supreme God of the Meta\n18\n-Multiverse, that I started wondering, what's the point?\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n It's like the wool on the sheep of your character, shorn off by obsession, had grown back in in your distraction.\n\n\n21:19:\n \nDr. Lillihammer elbows Dr. Blank in the stomach.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Strange metaphors aside, what does it matter if we're all in a story? Even if nobody narrates us, we're all narrating ourselves. We have to have a coherent self-image, and we tell ourselves our own story every day.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n I'm in a story with a brilliant cast, full of people who love and respect me.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n Well\u2026 I wouldn't say\u2026\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Shut up. This is Xettle talking, all your characters love him!\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n \"You're right,\" says Dr. Clank. And he leans in for a kiss.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n And Xettle leans in to it.\n\n\nDr. Lillihammer:\n And Millihammer fishes a twenty-dollar bill out of her pocket and gives it to Eelfina. \"You won the bet,\" she says.\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n And then Clank looks disappointed. \"I thought there would be some sort of spark\u2026 but I don't feel anything beyond the base attraction.\" he says. \"Let's just be friends.\"\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n Damn!\n\n\nDr. Blank:\n What can I say? I don't like my character's love life being established before I even get into the campaign.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n I\u2026 I can respect that.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Djoric Stormbreath walks over to her Hypercat. She places her hand on its' nose.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n \"Meeeow?\"\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n You can leave now, Hypercat. Go stay with Jordan C. Gordon and Gordon C. Jordan.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n \"Meow!\" protests the Hypercat. \"Hey, thanks for that, this is going to make our crime sprees real smooth!\" says Gordon C. Jordan.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I know that, Hypie. I just don't need you anymore.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n A personality enslaved to a dice or a duck is no better than a robot.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n But Cervantes' plot derailments\u2026 introducing new characters and having them tell their stories with no regard for the main plot\u2026 they made the book better. It keeps readers on their toes when the antics they desire could be frustrated at any moment. It makes the book more alive.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n And for all people remember the stunts and the windmills, the true beauty in that book is in Quixote's conversations with Sancho.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n There is beauty in digressions. A maddening beauty, maybe, to leave the plot behind, but which of us can truly say we are not mad?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n So leave me here, Hypercat. I need friends, not plot devices.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n \"Mrrr\u2026 MEOW!\" \nFwoosh!\n The hypercat launches into the midnight sky! It eclipses the moon, and soars into the stars!\n\n\n21:23:\n \nEveryone cheers.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Wettle? Can I talk to you alone?\n\n\n21:25:\n \nEveryone besides Dr. Wettle and SCP-7132 leave the room.\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n I think that's it. I think I can leave now.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n You realize I'm the only one of my kind who's stayed this long, right?\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n \u2026\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n Thank you for helping me write the story that finally got what I needed through my head.\n\n\nDr. Wettle:\n I\u2026 I can't lose you!\n\n\nSCP-7132:\n You don't need to. You have our story, and a story lasts forever. No matter where you are, you can remember our story, and the growth and change it caused in you, and you'll have me in your memory.\n\n\n21:30:\n \nSCP-7132 glows. She rises into the air, eyes closed, arms raised, and in a ball of fire and lightning, vanishes.

        "Character Actions and Choices (Advanced) Other role-playing games seem to think of mental challenges as a sort of pass-fail state system, resolvable by a roll of the dice. But brains know no pass-fail. They know only the paths they engrave over time. And those paths don't travel to a success region of the brain or a failure region, but connect a truly multifarious, byzantine network of regions that say, \"focus\" or \"remember\" or \"pretend to your significant other that you don't have a truly spectacular collection of pornography hidden behind his bathroom mirror.\" Our patented method of fictional-character mentalism is reproduced below. If living human skin is not available, you can use a very low-threshold memory foam. Make sure the side lengths of the square representing the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus are exact, or the earthworms may overexert themselves trying to reach it, and then the stitches holding them to the spiders will come undone. You don't want that. Would you want a limb to fall off while you played Twister?",
        "Now that you've ensured your own eternal torment by converting to the faith espoused by Dr. Wettle, it's time to get to the rules of the game! After all, it's all you'll have to pass the time in the fiery void! Rule 1: Let imaginary people pretend to be you. Rule 2: Tether your sense of achievement to the whims of a capricious universe.",
        "One death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic. Ergo, the emotional impact of an event is inversely proportional to its physical impact. A tragedy is one-millionth of a statistic, and a million times stronger. If we keep dividing the physical impact into smaller and smaller portions, the emotional impact will be stronger still. What is the name of a trillionth of a statistic? A vigintillionth? Is there a name for the devastation of an impact felt by a handful of atoms, whose magnitude dwarfs the observable universe?",
        "Making Characters (Advanced): Step 1: The brain stem",
        "On Transitioning From the Basic Ruleset To the Advanced Ruleset Let's drop the pretense for a moment. Nobody needs this ruleset. If you want to tell stories with your friends, you can go and tell stories with your friends without paying us a penny. All we are is the cardboard that makes up your rocket ship. We provide the stiffness so you can cut us up with scissors to form cones, fins, and windows. You don't need us to have fun. But at the same time, you need us very much. You need an excuse to exercise your imagination with your friends. You need some way of making sure that you're all prim and respectable to the outside world. You aren't a child anymore; your playtime must have rigorous rules. You need to feel like you're taking a gamble when your characters' actions fail, rather than failing when you feel it makes sense in the story. If you choose when your character fails, after all, aren't you a born loser? And when your character succeeds all the time, aren't they a Mary Sue? So we will be your excuse and your crutch. We have rules for every situation, should you begin to worry that this is all so childish. If you desire it, we have rules so dense so that a character cannot sneeze without having to make some sort of gamble. And you will feel that that sneeze is inherently better than if you had done it independently; this sneeze was in accordance with the rules. But there is a price, as with all crutches. The price of basing your ideas off of our rules is that your ideas are based off of our rules. And therefore, we own them. Every gamble you make based on our ruleset is marked in a dusty ledger. Every roleplay, we log. And as you have made our rules come to life, we live a little through you every session. Don't look behind you, you won't see anyone. You are completely and utterly alone in this room. Isn't that right, Dr. Wettle?",
