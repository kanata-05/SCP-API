A perimeter of 5 meters radius, centering on SCP-1830-A, is marked with a red line to indicate SCP-1830-B's area of appearance. A medical team should attend to SCP-1830-A's treatment on a daily basis. Should SCP-1830-A recover from the comatose state, one psychotherapist specialized in autistic spectrum disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder should be added to the team. This member must speak fluent Cantonese. During treatments, one member of security staff must be present outside the perimeter. Such arrangement exists not due to any threat from SCP-1830-B's part, but solely to reduce surprise caused by its sudden appearance. All personnel must be exposed to at least three sightings of SCP-1830-B before taking their posts.\n\n\nAny request to utilize SCP-1830-A for medical training on comatose treatment should be made in Form-1830-MT and delivered to Sector-07's site director.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1830-A, formerly \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 Leung, is an Asian male, currently sixteen years old. At the time of containment, the subject is 1.6 meters in height and weighs 51\u00a0kg. SCP-1830-A has been in comatose state since being victimized in a criminal assault in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 public estate, Hong Kong. Examination found extensive contusions on the head, arms and trunk. Incised wounds, carved into derogatory phrases in traditional Chinese characters, are found on the pelvis and inner thighs.\n\n\nPrior to containment, SCP-1830-A studied in Form 5\n1\n at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 Secondary School. Interviewees in the school described the subject as an unsociable person, who frequently displayed bizarre behaviors such as sharp \"hisses\" and convulsive \"nods\". Some interviewees attribute this to SCP-1830-A's diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. It is unclear whether these behaviors were coping mechanisms against difficult circumstances in school, neglect on the part of the subject's sole parent, or related to SCP-1830-B.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0content\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-1830-A's\u00a0school\u00a0bag\u00a0found\u00a0on\u00a0scene\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0content\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-1830-A's\u00a0school\u00a0bag\u00a0found\u00a0on\u00a0scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItems\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Edition Senior Secondary Chinese (5B)\n, Hong Kong Educational Publishing\n\n\nWords scrawled on the cover: \"FATHERLESS FREAK\".

Fifty-two magazines belonging to this series are found in SCP-1830-A's room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Learner\u2019s English-Chinese Dictionary (6th Edition)\n, Oxford University Press\n\n\nHeavily worn. One-sixth of its pages were torn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool diary\n\n\nThe photograph on the \"Personal Information\" page was torn. The rest of the page was overwritten in derogatory words not consistent with SCP-1830-A's handwriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwiss Army knife\n\n\nDNA testing of blood stain on the blade matched SCP-1830-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: except as specified, most books were found with extensive drawings of military vehicles, firearms, and figures in uniforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1830-B is a visual phenomenon that manifests within five meters of SCP-1830-A. The duration of SCP-1830-B\u2019s appearance varies from fifteen to sixty minutes, after which it vanishes on the spot. When movement is made, SCP-1830-B's visibility becomes inversely proportionally related to the distance from SCP-1830-A, with complete disappearance occurring at five meters. On each manifestation, SCP-1830-A's brain activity shows a sharp increase. Correlations have been found between peaks of brain activity and violent, desperate gestures on the part of SCP-1830-B. The prevalent theory is that SCP-1830-B is a projection from SCP-1830-A's mind.\n\n\nSCP-1830-B can manifest alternatively in two humanoid forms:\n3\n\n\n\n\n\"Ludwig\", a middle-aged Caucasian male with the appearance of a WW1-era German soldier in the \nSturmtruppen\n formations.\n4\n\n\n\"Ling-kuo\", an Asian male who appears to be in his late twenties, with the appearance of a Chinese soldier in the National Revolutionary Army circa 1930s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1830-B's activities\n\n\nOccurrence (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding guard.\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrolling in circle around SCP-1830-A with weapon leveled.\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveling weapon and shouting in a threatening manner.\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixing bayonet and charging. This eventually results in SCP-1830-B vanishing.\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiring weapon.\n\n\n28%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStroking SCP-1830-A's head and whispering into his ear.\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral activities involve SCP-1830-B utilizing weapons in a direction not facing SCP-1830-A. This is physically harmless, due to the entities' non-corporeal nature, and it does not produce sound. No mental effects except for surprise are found after SCP-1830-B or its weaponry passes through human subjects. During subsequent tests, blindfolded subjects showed no awareness of such contact until being notified afterward.\n\n\nSCP-1830 was brought to the Foundation's attention when Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an undercover agent embedded in the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), noticed reports of anomalous sightings at the crime scene and SCP-1830-A's emergency ward in witness' testimony. Under pretext of patient transferal, SCP-1830-A was transported from the local hospital to Sector-07. SCP-1830-A's limited social circle smoothed disinformation efforts considerably. The four suspects, arrested by local police on-scene, were released after administration of Class A amnestics.\n\n\nExcerpt of interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Ng, SCP-1830-A's mother\n\n\n\n\nI:\n Do you know much about your son's school life?\n\n\nN:\n I\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard enough to deal with daily living, you know. Sometime \u2013 many times \u2013 he came home with a few bruises, or some buttons missed, or some ball-pen strokes on his uniform. He never talked about it. We never talk anyway. He just dropped his head, dodged my gaze and walked to his room like I was not here. I used to call him out for that, sometimes a beating or denied him dinner, but as he grew older I just couldn\u2019t be bothered.\n\n\nI:\n What did he do in his room?\n\n\nN:\n Who knows? Slaving on his computer like every Post-90s\n5\n I guess? I heard chatter from his room. Perhaps he did chat with friends online, afterall.\n\n\nI:\n Do you know those friends? \n(Note: subsequent inspection found no peripheral capable of vocal chat on SCP-1830-A\u2019s custom-built desktop. Ms. Ng shows limited knowledge of computer technology.)\n\n\nN:\n Well, honestly I don\u2019t know much about his circle. But sometime he talks pretty loud, so I did hear something. One of them is called Ling-kuo. Sometime I heard him spill his guts with all those self-worthless talks and\u2026 You know, it's really rare to hear him talk that much to other people. They must be close friends. After a while I heard another name. That\u2019s a foreigner name, can\u2019t remember it.\n\n\nI:\n Did he talk differently with that other friend?\n\n\nN:\n Very different. He never spoke angrily before, but with him he did. I overheard him growling, uttering words like \u2018butcher them\u2019, \u2018burn alive\u2019, \u2018die die die\u2019. Sometimes he muttered something like that\u2019s how you use a gun, and a bunch of other probably military terms - he likes that stuff you know, his room\u2019s lined with books about jets and guns.\n\n\nI:\n Do you know this person? \n(Interviewer produces a photograph of SCP-1830-B \"Ling-kuo\")\n\n\nN:\n What the - Where did you get it? Is \nthat\n what he keeps with himself everyday?\n\n\nI:\n That\u2019s Ling-kuo.\n\n\nN:\n You\u2019re kidding. That\u2019s his dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0eyewitness:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0eyewitness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI:\n Please describe what you saw.\n\n\n\n\nE:\n Okay\u2026I was taking a smoking break from my tea-restaurant. It was 5\u00a0pm I think, when I heard shouts from that soccer yard behind the school. There're five of them, all in school uniforms. Four of them were pushing this little boy into the yard. He was stumbling back, then someone punched him hard and he fell. That's how I saw his face. Someone squatted down and fingered his cheeks, then this bully with buckteeth took his eyeglasses. He tried to take them back, but they just pressed him on the ground.\n\n\n\n\nI:\n Go on.\n\n\nE:\n One of them grabbed a blade then sawed on his belt. It must have been pretty rough because that boy was jerking and moaning. He didn't even cry for help, just turned his head away and let the tears fall. They threw away his pants and underwear [IRRELEVANT REDACTED] scolding, and poking, with that knife. That boy, his face\u2026 it was like -\n\n\n\n\nI:\n \n(Interrupting)\n On the phone you have mentioned an \"unnatural\" occurrence. Can you describe that?\n\n\nE:\n Yeah I am getting to that. There was this \u2026 smoke \u2026 appeared out of thin air somewhere behind them. It moved closer to the group, and its shape became more defined. Then I found myself looking at a big soldier.\n\n\n\n\nI:\n Can you describe him?\n\n\nE:\n He's a blond westerner, wearing this grey uniform and carrying a long gun. He unslung and trained it on the bullies. That boy was staring at him\u2026 he stopped resisting even when those bullies kept wrecking him. They weren't facing there. They didn't even know what was coming, and he fired.\n\n\n\n\nI:\n What happened?\n\n\nE:\n \nNothing.\n Nothing at all. I saw the flash but it was completely silent. Yes, I was covering my ears but I should have still heard the bang. Someone should have been shot, right? But no, those guys were still jerking the boy as if nothing had happened. That soldier cocked his gun, and shot again, and again, but it just didn't work. Maybe he's frustrated or something, he pulled out this bayonet and attached it on the rifle. The next thing I saw, he was charging at them. His mouth was wide-open but I didn't even hear anything.\n\n\nHe thrusted it into the buckteeth's back. I saw that bayonet stick out from his chest, but guess what? That sick-fuck just kept carving pictures on the boy's flesh as if nothing happened. That soldier stabbed for several more times in vain, then he \u2026 faded into thin air.\n\n\n\n\nI:\n What about the boy?\n\n\nE:\n He finally cried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0drawing\u00a0found\u00a0in\u00a0mathematics\u00a0notebook:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0drawing\u00a0found\u00a0in\u00a0mathematics\u00a0notebook:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
