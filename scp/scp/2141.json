Mobile Task Force Omega-23, under the command of Site Administrator L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, has been designated as the primary unit responsible for secure containment procedure regarding SCP-2141.\n\n\nLogistics for containment of SCP-2141 are provided by Provisional Containment Site-141, located at 44.0437\u00b0 N, 73.9265\u00b0 W, 6\u00a0km due east-by-northeast of SCP-2141. This Site operates under the front of a Forest Service outpost.\n\n\nWhen SCP-2141-1 emerges from SCP-2141 and attempts escape, personnel must record the date and time of the anomaly\u2019s appearance and its observable movement patterns, including average velocity and any instances of SCP-2141-1 delving underground. Following acquisition of requested data, personnel must fire upon SCP-2141-1 with rubber ammunition, only, until it is incapacitated. Personnel must lastly contact Site Administrator L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to confirm that SCP-2141 has retrieved SCP-2141-1 and returned to its underground dormant state.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2141 is an immense earthworm-like creature located within a derelict tunnel at 44.0345\u00b0 N, 73.9416\u00b0 W, near the Adirondack Mountains. SCP-2141\u2019s dimensions exceed the dimensions of the tunnel, with an average diameter of 8.5\u00a0m and a currently undefined length; no instance of SCP-2141\u2019s emergence has resulted in the emergence of its entire body. It is theorized that SCP-2141 is a spatial anomaly, able to \u201ccondense\u201d its body while within the tunnel in order to compensate for its massive size.\n\n\nMild video and radio interference occurs within approximately 5\u00a0km of the tunnel\u2019s entrance. However, all electronic equipment used beyond 49\u00a0m of the entrance becomes permanently nonfunctional.\n\n\nFollowing Incident-2141-I, SCP-2141 periodically emerges from a chasm of unknown depth estimated 200\u00a0m beyond the entrance of the tunnel between intervals of \n23\n 18 days. Upon emergence, SCP-2141 deposits SCP-2141-1 at approximately 50\u00a0m within the tunnel.\n\n\nSCP-2141-1 is a disfigured female humanoid believed to be a thorough mutation of the body of Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 after extensive exposure to SCP-2141. Its prominent features include a severely bloated abdomen as well as a viscous coating of pale yellow fluid. To achieve displacement, SCP-2141-1 aligns itself face-up and parallel to surfaces upon which it \u201cslithers,\u201d using this fluid to mitigate frictional forces. This fluid also bestows SCP-2141-1 increased resistance to physical trauma, allowing the anomaly in one event to survive and make limited recovery from lower body amputation.\n\n\nFollowing Incident-2141-II, SCP-2141 is considered to be using SCP-2141-1 as a form of gestational \u201cnesting probe\u201d to discover suitable habitats for the birth of its offspring. Consequentially, SCP-2141 is fiercely protective of SCP-2141-1 and will immediately pursue it if it is incapacitated. However, SCP-2141 does not appear to respond to other non-fatal damage to SCP-2141-1.\n\n\nUnless SCP-2141-1 is incapacitated outside of the tunnel during escape attempts, SCP-2141 does not attempt egress, facilitating containment procedures. However, SCP-2141 will not return to its dormant state unless it has retrieved SCP-2141-1 following incapacitation. When undergoing retrieval SCP-2141's high speeds (between 5\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588 kph) and size cause extensive damage to the landscape as a consequence of its size.\n\n\nIn rare circumstances, SCP-2141-1 has been known to emulate the behavior of SCP-2141, such as its velocity and tendency to momentarily delve underground (See Incident 2141-III).\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-I\u00a0(5/31/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-I\u00a0(5/31/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the emergence of SCP-2141:\n Discovery of SCP-2141 occurred during routine SAR\n1\n mapping of the Northeastern U.S. in an effort to detect further instances of subterranean anomalies following discovery and containment of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Radar imaging due northwest of the Adirondack Park revealed imaging distortion surpassing absolute thresholds, prompting researchers to send one (1) remote-controlled GPR\n2\n unit to the affected coordinates to conduct a subsurface survey. Electromagnetic interference prevented the unit from detecting subsurface anomalies, but a video feed attached to the unit, while subject to interference, eventually discovered SCP-2141\u2019s habitat at the above coordinates, upon discovering a trail not found on any known maps.\n\n\nFoundation agents embedded in the Forest Service were activated to secure the perimeter of the tunnel. However, agents reported that it existed within the private property of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family, consisting of one vacation home seasonally occupied by a married couple of one (1) year (Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588). Discrete surveillance and exploration of the area continued, and two (2) field agents posing as Forest Service rangers were sent to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 upon their arrival to extract official permission to survey the tunnel under the guise of removing hazardous material and dangerous local fauna.\n\n\nUpon the arrival of field agents to his home, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reacted violently when questioned regarding the tunnel housing SCP-2141, lunging at the agents with a ceremonial knife which could not be recovered from the scene. Agents responded with force, shooting Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 twice in the abdomen. The wounds were believed to be non-fatal, but upon being injured, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 self-terminated by slashing his throat. Within three (3) minutes, SCP-2141 arrived at the seasonal home, demolishing the structure and \"consuming\" Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nThe surviving agent was gravely injured, but managed to recover the following document upon arrival of Foundation personnel on-scene.\n\n\n\n\nDocument recovered from the home of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nThe mother must not be denied her offspring.\n\n\nThough tomorrow I betray your trust, beloved, know that it is in the service of maternity beyond the ken of both man and woman. And know that I shall pay for any wrong I have done unto you in my own blood, as is the cost of paternity.\n\n\nBut the father must not be denied his birthright.\n\n\nThough my father, and my father\u2019s father, and their fathers before them all failed to fulfill their paternal obligation, my father did pass on to me the knowledge of how to claim my inheritance. Yet it is not the will of my forefathers I invoke, but the will of primordial existence long denied the fruits of labor undeservedly enjoyed by humanity.\n\n\nDo you not know, \u2018twas not for humanity that carnal knowledge was intended, but the Wyrm?\n\n\nWe depart in the scorching condemnation of daylight. I feel my resolve wavering before me in the lines of stinking heat. But tonight, the moon shall be full with the promise of delivery. And so let deliverance come.\n\n\nNo, I shall not ask for forgiveness. You will not bear our son, but you will bear witness to something infinitely greater. In your twenty-first year of womanhood, you shall free us from our original sin.\n\n\n\n\nThe organism revealed to reside within the tunnel\u2019s chasm has since been termed SCP-2141. Both individuals are now effectively considered deceased. Ownership of the territory surrounding SCP-2141\u2019s habitat has since been transferred directly to the Foundation, facilitating effective containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-II\u00a0(6/23/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-II\u00a0(6/23/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\nRegarding Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s reappearance:\n Until further notice, SCP-2141-1 has been designated to describe all instances of Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s reemergence. The first such emergence occurred at 8:41 p.m. on 6/23/20\u2588\u2588, interrupting research being conducted near the tunnel to determine the geological age of the site.\n\n\nSenior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ordered personnel to non-lethally incapacitate SCP-2141-1 for retrieval and biopsy to confirm her hypothesis that SCP-2141 had selected Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as a host for its offspring. She further ordered personnel to delay recovering SCP-2141-1 in the event that SCP-2141 emerged in an attempt to reclaim the body.\n\n\nSCP-2141 emerged shortly after incapacitation of SCP-2141-1 and reclaimed its body before immediately returning underground. Senior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 thus recommends incapacitation of SCP-2141-1 immediately after any initial appearance. Containment procedures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n\nWhile researchers were unable to collect SCP-2141-1 for testing, fluids collected on the scene left by SCP-2141-1 are somewhat consistent with trace elements of amniotic fluid. Senior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s earlier conjecture that SCP-2141 may be incubating offspring between intervals of its emergence is considered confirmed.\n\n\nSenior Researcher L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 received a promotion to Provisional Site Administrator for her prudence and leadership on-site.\n\n\nTests conducted regarding the geological age of the area within and immediately surrounding the tunnel were inconclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-III\u00a0(7/04/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident\u00a02141-III\u00a0(7/04/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Incident-2141-II, provisional containment procedures were established under order of Site Administrator L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, including the construction of a barricade to obstruct the motion of SCP-2141-1. At 2:37 p.m. (within six (6) minutes of finalization of construction), SCP-2141-1 appeared just outside of the constructed barrier, emerging from underground. It immediately moved due south-by-southwest at an approximated velocity of between 5\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588 kph, continuing to delve underground and resurface between very short intervals as few as 0.03\u00a0s. At the time such movement patterns were unprecedented, and on-site personnel were unable to incapacitate SCP-2141-1 and prevent containment breach.\n\n\nSCP-2141-1 was instead incapacitated following a collision on Interstate 91 with a trailer truck, which resulted in the amputation of SCP-2141-1 above the knees. SCP-2141 reclaimed both the incapacitated body of SCP-2141-1 and its severed remains upon arrival.\n\n\nFoundation agents on the scene reported 7\u2588 casualties, 1\u2588 of which were Foundation personnel. Additionally, severe structural damage was caused to Interstate-91, with property damage incurred of $8,\u2588\u2588\u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nThe aftermath was publicly explained as a series of avalanches, mudslides, and sinkholes prompted by nearby activity of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 & \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Drilling Company. After the consequential bankruptcy of the company, the Foundation was able to significantly increase its presence in the area near SCP-2141 by offering front services to repair damages and by occupying many vacant Forest Service positions.\n\n\nIn spite of having travelled a distance of \u2588\u2588\u2588 km, SCP-2141 was noted to be continuous for the entire length of its \u201chead\u201d to its initial point of origin. Additionally, the anomaly has been determined to be the source of video and radio interference originating within SCP-2141, with this effect extending along its entire length. It is believed that this interference results from the anomalous spatial effects caused by SCP-2141. Class A Amnestics administered by agents posing as paramedics on scene thus ensured that the public remained unaware of SCP-2141's existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02141-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258820\u2588\u2588\u00a0(\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0Log\u00a02141-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258820\u2588\u2588\u00a0(\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Provisional Containment Site-141 Administrator, D\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\u201cDL-141\u201d)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Site-28 Administrator (\u201cAdmin-28\u201d)\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-28, New York, New York\n\n\n<Begin Log: 7:25 p.m., \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588>\n\n\nDL-141:\n An interview room.

SCP-2141 doesn\u2019t have eyes \u2013 how it gets around, how it detects SCP-2141-1\u2019s location is all a mystery to us \u2013 so that\u2019s just one piece of evidence that SCP-2141-1 is becoming more like its\u2026\n\n\nAdmin-28:\n Progenitor.\n\n\nDL-141:\n Yes. But there\u2019s others.\n\n\nAdmin-28:\n The delving underground, the erratic velocities.\n\n\nDL-141:\n Yes. Nothing like what we saw during Incident 2141-III, but enough to make us worry.

For all we know the thing can probably regenerate. \n(hesitates)\n I\u2019m proposing \u2013 \n(pauses)\n \u2013 \u201cneutralizing\u201d SCP-2141.\n\n\nAdmin-28:\n I \u2013 \nwhat\n? How? The sheer size alone \u2013 if we even \ncould\n kill it \u2013\n\n\nDL-141:\n - Neutralize it.\n\n\nAdmin-28:\n \n(pauses)\n Neutralize it \u2013 how would we \u2013\n\n\nDL-141:\n Dispose of the remains? I know. But something has to be done. I \u2013 I \ntried\n hindering the movement of SCP-2141-1. It doesn\u2019t work, and I do not recommend trying it again. Even if it could work, the costs of a mistake are \u2013 they\u2019re excessive. Especially if we don\u2019t get the kind of godsend we got from that frickin\u2019 18-wheeler. \n(pauses)\n Do you know how close its projected path put it to this Site? What would have happened if that truck hadn\u2019t hit it?\n\n\nAdmin-28:\n And then we don\u2019t even know what would have happened if the collision had neutralized it.\n\n\nDL-141:\n Exactly. And look, further down.\n\n\nAdmin-28 \n(reading)\n:\n \u201cPersonnel on-site have additionally reported increased seismic activity in the immediate vicinity of SCP-2141 while dormant.\u201d Fuck.\n\n\nDL-141:\n Exactly, again. And we can\u2019t get a reading of whatever is happening down there.

Though tomorrow I betray your trust, beloved, know that it is in the service of maternity beyond the ken of both man and woman. And know that I shall pay for any wrong I have done unto you in my own blood, as is the cost of paternity. But the father must not be denied his birthright. Though my father, and my father\u2019s father, and their fathers before them all failed to fulfill their paternal obligation, my father did pass on to me the knowledge of how to claim my inheritance. Yet it is not the will of my forefathers I invoke, but the will of primordial existence long denied the fruits of labor undeservedly enjoyed by humanity. Do you not know, \u2018twas not for humanity that carnal knowledge was intended, but the Wyrm? We depart in the scorching condemnation of daylight. I feel my resolve wavering before me in the lines of stinking heat. But tonight, the moon shall be full with the promise of delivery. And so let deliverance come. No, I shall not ask for forgiveness. You will not bear our son, but you will bear witness to something infinitely greater. In your twenty-first year of womanhood, you shall free us from our original sin."

        "Interviewed: Provisional Containment Site-141 Administrator, D\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\u201cDL-141\u201d) Interviewer: Site-28 Administrator (\u201cAdmin-28\u201d) Location: Site-28, New York, New York <Begin Log: 7:25 p.m., \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588> DL-141: An interview room. What the fuck. Admin-28: You called me; you told me it was serious. Now it\u2019s serious. This is standard procedure. You have urgent information to share regarding 2141, correct? You think we had you airlifted from upstate so you could make a courtesy call? \u201cOff-the-books\u201d isn\u2019t a card you have in your hand right now, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. DL-141: I called the O5s, \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 \u201c twenty-eight ,\u201d not you. They \u201cdeferred\u201d me to your \u2013 (snorts) \u2013 \u201c expertise. \u201d Admin-28: The point, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. What the O5s decide isn\u2019t something I decide, you know that. DL-141: Don\u2019t give me that crap. This is because of Incident[-2141]-III. They don\u2019t trust my \u2013 what\u2019s the term? Operational judgment? Professional discretion? What\u2019s the terminology for you all thinking I\u2019m \u201ca hysterical bitch\u201d? You all air-hauled me out here so I could explain myself. Admin-28: There was a lot of damage. Not only Foundation lives lost, but civilians\u2019. We cleaned it up \u2013 we\u2019re still cleaning it up \u2013 but I think it\u2019s reasonable if the O5-Council would like someone to confirm that what you have for us today isn\u2019t going to result in another \u2013 DL-141: So this is \u201cthe point,\u201d huh? Fuck you , twenty-eight. You think you would have done better? You\u2019ve seen the reports. \u201cUnprecedented.\u201d I \u2013 we \u2013 had no reason to believe that blocking off 2141-1\u2019s exit \u2013 to such a limited extent, I might add \u2013 would cause a containment breach. The damn thing\u2019s \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 she\u2019s been learning. Admin-28: From SCP-2141. You claim. DL-141: It\u2019s fucking Euclid-class, twenty-eight. Most of what I have is claims. But they\u2019re claims backed by solid evidence. Since Incident 2141-I, she\u2019s \u2013 Admin-28: \u201cIt.\u201d \u201cSCP-2141-1.\u201d I would think that at your position you would have learned a degree of professional distance, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. (quietly) Lord knows I\u2019ve had to. DL-141: (silent) Admin-28: Look, Administrator. We\u2019re on your side. But you have to understand that this isn\u2019t politics. This is protection. These are priorities. Secure, contain \u2013 DL-141: Protect. (sighs) I know. (pauses) I fucked up. (quietly) I fucked up. Admin-28: You \u201cmade an operational error due to the high variability of anomalous properties complicating containment.\u201d (quieter) You need to get used to this, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. You\u2019re right. We \u2013 I\u2019ve \u2013 seen the reports. And there were other researchers on-site who agreed with your decision to revise containment procedure. Those deaths aren\u2019t your fault any more than SCP-2141-1\u2019s predicament is \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 the fault of the \u201cdeceased\u201d wife. The only one who\u2019s to blame is \u2013 well actually, it might as well be our reality. DL-141: (laughs) This is some kind of psych eval, huh? Admin-28: (laughs) As I said, standard protocol. We don\u2019t think you\u2019re \u2013 what was your term? DL-141: \u201cA highly-pressured upper-level employee of the Foundation subject to typical stressors and psychological distress in the course of professional operations.\u201d Admin-28: You\u2019re learning. DL-141: Yeah, I guess I am. Admin-28: We are taking you seriously, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. What do you have for us? DL-141: (exhales) Here. (hands a document to Admin-28) Admin-28 (reading) : Increased instances of SCP-2141 delving underground. (continues reading) And SCP-2141-1 is emerging at a greater average frequency. DL-141: Around every eighteen days or so. Admin-28: But existing containment procedure has been effective? DL-141: If this keeps up, they won\u2019t be. Admin-28: What do you mean? DL-141: Like I was saying \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 it\u2019s learning. The anomaly is emulating the behavior \u2013 and in some cases, the appearance \u2013 of SCP-2141. That viscous coating \u2013 she\u2019s had that from day one, but we\u2019ve noticed other things. Admin-28: Such as? DL-141: Her eyes. Her sclerae, her irides, they\u2019ve darkened considerably. And what looks like cataracts on her eyes makes us think she\u2019s not using them \u2013 if she ever was. For the first few emergences after \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 after Incident 2141-III, she was bumping into walls, moving more erratically \u2013 but that\u2019s since stabilized. SCP-2141 doesn\u2019t have eyes \u2013 how it gets around, how it detects SCP-2141-1\u2019s location is all a mystery to us \u2013 so that\u2019s just one piece of evidence that SCP-2141-1 is becoming more like its\u2026 Admin-28: Progenitor. DL-141: Yes. But there\u2019s others. Admin-28: The delving underground, the erratic velocities. DL-141: Yes. Nothing like what we saw during Incident 2141-III, but enough to make us worry. If it ever exhibits that kind of behavior again\u2026 Admin-28: Existing containment procedures won\u2019t suffice. DL-141: Correct. Admin-28: Are you proposing terminating SCP-2141-1 to prevent containment breach? DL-141: Fuck no. For all we know the thing can probably regenerate. (hesitates) I\u2019m proposing \u2013 (pauses) \u2013 \u201cneutralizing\u201d SCP-2141. Admin-28: I \u2013 what ? How? The sheer size alone \u2013 if we even could kill it \u2013 DL-141: - Neutralize it. Admin-28: (pauses) Neutralize it \u2013 how would we \u2013 DL-141: Dispose of the remains? I know. But something has to be done. I \u2013 I tried hindering the movement of SCP-2141-1. It doesn\u2019t work, and I do not recommend trying it again. Even if it could work, the costs of a mistake are \u2013 they\u2019re excessive. Especially if we don\u2019t get the kind of godsend we got from that frickin\u2019 18-wheeler. (pauses) Do you know how close its projected path put it to this Site? What would have happened if that truck hadn\u2019t hit it? Admin-28: And then we don\u2019t even know what would have happened if the collision had neutralized it. DL-141: Exactly. And look, further down. Admin-28 (reading) : \u201cPersonnel on-site have additionally reported increased seismic activity in the immediate vicinity of SCP-2141 while dormant.\u201d Fuck. DL-141: Exactly, again. And we can\u2019t get a reading of whatever is happening down there. Interference blocks off all attempts to use GPR beyond \u2588 km. Admin-28: Jesus Christ. DL-141: So you see why I\u2019m here. There\u2019s a timetable on this. We don\u2019t know what SCP-2141 is doing in response to our containment procedures. We can\u2019t guarantee that any containment procedure we do design will prevent unprecedented anomalous behavior. This isn\u2019t the first time that a scip has presented a threat to existing containment procedures, but this one is coming faster than we\u2019re ready to deal with it. Those greater frequencies of SCP-2141-1\u2019s emergence \u2013 they represent decreases in the time it takes for SCP-2141 to incubate one of its offspring. Admin-28: What do you have to support that claim? DL-141: Not much. But if these things need to be carried to term, as they apparently do, it\u2019s unlikely that all the shit we put SCP-2141-1 through allows those gestating shits to survive inside of her. At the very least, we think SCP-2141 is doing damage control whenever it reclaims SCP-2141-1. Rehabilitating the trauma to the infant. But even one more of these things would be hell on our ability to contain the situation. Not to mention hell on our budget. Admin-28: I\u2019ve yet to see hell freeze over cold enough to freeze out our funds, D\u2588\u2588\u2588. DL-141: Yeah, and that\u2019s probably because it\u2019ll be the last thing you see. Admin-28: True. (pauses) I\u2019m sending a log of our conversation over to the O5. I\u2019ll endorse your recommendation. We\u2019re prioritizing termination of SCP-2141. DL-141: Fantastic. (sound of shuffling sheaves of paper) Admin-28: Wait. One more thing. DL-141: What is it? I\u2019ve got a flight to catch, in less than five minutes, apparently. Admin-28: That document from Incident 2141-I. The O5 wants your assessment of it. It\u2019s not included in the report. DL-141: That lunatic\u2019s writings? (laughs derisively) I don\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s on about, and frankly, I don\u2019t care. Maybe there is some pre-civilization legend about this thing we\u2019re dealing with. (quietly) What I am worried about is that there might be more idiots like him. Or even other locations where things like this are lying dormant. (pauses) My assessment of that document is that there is only one SCP-2141, given the way he refers to the anomaly as unique. But it\u2019s not an airtight conclusion.
