The content (A soap opera titled \"Period Drama\") is broadcast between 0200 to 0300 local time. The program (which is broadcast in English with poorly translated Spanish subtitles) follows the Periad\u00f3s, a wealthy ranch owning family. Several subplots involve the financial and romantic troubles of the working class individuals surrounding the central family.\n\n\nThe starring individuals of the program are anthropoid examples of punctuation. Their resemblance to humans varies between individuals, though each has arms, legs, and a face, regardless of the type of punctuation they represent. Only named characters appear as punctuation. The remainder of the characters are baseline humans. Human characters treat the stars of the drama as though they were human in almost all interactions.\n\n\nThe program is generally structured with a cold open, then opening title screen, followed by the remainder of the episode. Various commercials are presented throughout. All content broadcast alongside the program, as well as the program itself, are produced by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media.\n\n\nThe following is a typical example of the program's cold open.\n\n\n\n\nMaria Periad\u00f3s, a comma, is seen in a hospital bed. Jonathan Millon, a question mark, paces outside the room as a number of doctors attend to Maria's needs. Maria appears to be in pain, and it is slowly revealed that she is in labor and will soon give birth.\n\n\nJonathan is comforted by Ruiz S\u00e1nchez, a colon. The two appear startled as Maria cries out, and Jonathan bursts into the hospital room.\n\n\nThe doctor slowly turns to face the camera with a bundled child and speaks.\n\n\n\"It's\u2026 it's a semi-colon.\"\n\n\nThe camera pans over to Ruiz who is standing at the door. There is a delay of 3.4 seconds as the sounds of the crying child can be heard in the background and the camera slowly zooms in on Ruiz's face.\n\n\nSmash cut to black. The title card slowly fades in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod Drama\n\n\nEpisode 96. \nThe Pregnant Pause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to locate the object producing SCP-6613 broadcasts are currently underway.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Civilian reception of the analog signal is now impossible with commercial grade equipment as the Foundation's Anomalous Broadcast Security Directive has transitioned the US market to use digital signals only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6612\n | SCP-6613 | \nSCP-6614\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6613\n\" by Doctor Cimmerian, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
