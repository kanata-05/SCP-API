Civilian entry into SCP-8372 is to be prevented per standard protocol.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-8372 is an abandoned underground storage facility located in northern Tibet. Consisting of four levels, it acts as a warehouse for numerous minor anomalous and mundane objects of interest connected to the late Daevite Empire from various ages of its existence, contained and cataloged by SCP-8372's previous overseers. The facility at large possesses no anomalous qualities. The door leading into the structure \u2014 which had been barred from the inside prior to Foundation discovery \u2014 bears a placard that reads:\n\n\n\n\n\u7570\u5b78\u6703\u8ca1\u7522\n\n\u7981\u6b62\u8a2a\u554f\n1\n\n\n\n\nThe Abnormality Institute was a Foundation precursor organization that was dissolved following its integration into the emergent Foundation in 1870. During the aforementioned merge, all Institute facilities, personnel, and documentations were integrated into Foundation control and structure; it is unknown why SCP-8372 was not. Similarly, none of the other aforementioned materials bear any references or even suggestions as to the facility's existence.\n\n\nThe purpose of SCP-8372 \u2014 if any existed at all, other than the storage of the artifacts contained therein \u2014 remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 8372-1:\n Description of SCP-8372 Floors\n\n\nThe first floor contains various pieces of art \u2014 tapestries, vases, paintings, scrolls, etc. \u2014 depicting and/or relating to Daevite royalty. Though all pieces invariably depict said royalty in the background of disastrous events\n2\n all low Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) individuals who interact with these works will invariably be incapable of focusing on said events, instead wholly fixating on the depicted royalty, whom they describe as \"civilized\" and \"cultured.\"\n\n\nThe second floor houses royal memorabilia which had once belonged to the Maharani of Daevon and her matriarchal court, such as the royal crown, jewels, rings, and ritual daggers. Although most of these objects are not of Daevite make, low CRV individuals will not be capable of recognizing them as such, claiming that they have been made, found, and (when directly confronted) secured from destruction from the locals by the Daevites.\n\n\nThe third floor stores statues of varying sizes and makes, depicting various different Maharanis of Daevon. The most frequently depicted monarch is Ridhima VII, known for her conquest and enslavement of proto-N\u00e4lk\u00e4 peoples. Although low CRV observers will be incapable of recognizing this fact, all of her statues are constructed utilizing carnomancy, an art only practiced by N\u00e4lk\u00e4 cultures. Though Ridhima VII's depictions vary, a large majority of them show her riding a great steed, beneath which several other individuals of different cultures follow in its wake.\n\n\nThe fourth floor holds armaments utilized by Daevite military forces. It is the only part of the entire SCP-8372 complex which is not covered by a thick layer of dust and shows no signs of age. Low CRV individuals who get in any way wounded by the weapons refuse to acknowledge this, often resorting to anger and violence when confronted with direct and irrefutable evidence of their wounds. When asked to explain their injuries, none of the subjects have been capable of forming a coherent answer.\n\n\nAlthough the staircase which connects all floors ends with the fourth floor, Foundation scans revealed the existence of one more area directly beneath it. Following the removal of a thin layer of unevenly stacked tiles, personnel discovered a large cave that contained approximately 50,000 human bodies.\n\n\nAll of them have been unnaturally preserved and show no signs of decomposition. The corpses appear to have been carefully stacked inside the grotto into meticulously even positions, similar to the placement of bricks. Together, the bodies create a structure which appears almost like scaffolding. It reaches high into the cave, right next to its ceiling and the place in which it connects to the SCP-8372 complex, which it appears to be propping up; it is unclear whether the facility would hold up without it.\n\n\nAll individuals \u2014 no matter their CRV \u2014 are fully incapable of recognising or describing the faces of any of the corpses. All of the bodies bear clothing of non-Daevite make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8371\n | SCP-8372 | \nSCP-8373\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8372\n\" by Ralliston, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
