His ears rang from his whirling thoughts; \u201cif anything happens, let it be known that it was for Him\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+53\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nAnakes & Celestial Tophat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we authored more articles, we would put them here.\n\n\nInstead, we decided to make our first article an 8kcon entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A slow sort of country!\" said the Queen. \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\"\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRed Queen hypothesis\n, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a species must constantly adapt and evolve to keep pace in a metaphorical 'arms race' against their competitors and predators, who are also constantly co-evolving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestored image of POI-2531.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 1970\n. You were sitting in your lonesome sanctum, detached from the outside world. Your eyes trudged through pages of requisition reports with a tired droop. Your cohort of Thirteen had taken time out of their schedules to enjoy themselves. They even elected to invite you on the way out. Despite your status as the Administrator, you were far from immune to peer pressure. With a playful eye-roll in rebuttal, you would join them.\n\n\nThe night was a mess of barely coherent memories. The visages in your mind were broken by the mind-melting hands of inebriation. One moment, you were with your colleagues. The next, you were rubbing shoulders with people from all walks of life. Amongst all of the people you talked to, there was one who stuck out to you: a woman.\n\n\nIt was a tale as old as time itself\u2014it only took one glance. Your mind was completely, and utterly, compromised: she was the saboteur. By the time she had introduced herself, a mess of words that barely sounded like English spilled from your mouth. For the rest of the night, you had shared what few hours were left of it together: you were enthralled.\n\n\nOver many months, your colleagues would comment about how you would leave your office more. Your closest friend and loud-mouthed business partner, Roland Foster, would tease you about a smile that never quite left your face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\nCC:\n \nO5 Council (group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvening Winston,\n\n\nWe've just wrapped up our meeting on the recent Insurgency activity. It's a shame you couldn't be in attendance, but I understand.\n\n\nI've gone through the effort of dropping off a file that contains the minutes of the meeting and the possible POIs. Site-19's offered guys from their Strat Intel wing to head the effort so don't worry, you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\n\nBefore I forget, are we still on for tomorrow?\n\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\n\nRoland\n\n\nO5-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 17, 1980.\n Insurgency activity was emboldened as a new wave of defections struck your organization. It had been a while since you had stepped foot into Site-01, but you still had your obligations. You groan to yourself as you prepare for another long night in your study, you almost didn\u2019t notice the door behind you opening. As you swing around on your chair, your eyes lock with the woman you had grown so familiar with. In the dim lighting, the band nestled upon her finger sparkles slightly. She gives you a soft smile as she places a hand on your shoulder, her other hand resting upon her abdomen. With only a few words, she convinces you that the pages can wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow is another day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Winnie,\n\n\nFirst: that's amazing news! Since I'm sure you've had a lot on your mind, so let me assure you that I haven't told a soul about any of this. Not even Overwatch knows. It's unheard of for men and women like us to fraternize with civilians, but I suppose we all have skeletons in our closets\u2014just so happens yours are remarkably tame.\n\n\nSecond: I know this is unrelated, but I sent a copy of SCP-8020 over to you to look over. They found some real interesting stuff while digging out Site-03 that I think you might be somewhat interested in.\n\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\n\nRoland\n\n\nO5-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 21, 1981\n. Your mind is a mess. Your hand clutches hers as distress fills both of your bodies. Medical staff flank you in a race against human biology. You kept her as close as you could, but not close enough. When they came back, the doctor quietly shook his head. But your world had not ended yet, not entirely. Contained within your hands was your future: a boy. He was small and fragile, but to you? He was perfect in every way that mattered. For her sake, you promised yourself that you would keep the boy secure and protected.\n\n\nThe first year was the hardest, but eventually, you found an even tempo. You were far from the perfect father for the boy, but you were attentive and you were patient. That was more than what many others could say. With that aside, you have work to do that's far overdue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRETRIEVE\u00a0FILE\u00a08020.1\u00a0||\u00a01980\u00a0-\u00a02001\n\n\n\n\nLet's\u00a0see...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \nSCP-8020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nsafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\n{$secondary-class}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\ndark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\ncaution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest entrance to SCP-8020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigned Site\n\n\nSite Director\n\n\nResearch Head\n\n\nAssigned MTF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-03\n\n\nSite Director E.

Access is to be denied unless a full proposal has been accepted by the incumbent Director of Research. Routine shearing of SCP-8020 is to be conducted by no more than two (2) Class-D personnel under the oversight of a security guard.\n\n\nSub-instances SCP-8020-1 through to -12 are to be stored separately within secure containment chests stored inside Sector-10's Safe-Containment Wing. Due to its size, SCP-8020-13 is to be stored within an anomalous weapon locker.\n\n\nWhen handling any instance of SCP-8020, personnel are to adhere to ASL-2\n3\n safety procedures including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nWearing lab coats, gloves, and facial protection when in direct contact with the objects\n\n\nPossession of contact details for the facility's HMC Liaison\n\n\nThe presence of at least one (1) member of security with a certificate in hazardous material handling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020 is the collective designation given to a subterranean catacomb and its contents, first unearthed during the construction of Armed Research and Containment Site-03. Despite its location within the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, the architecture displays techniques more commonly associated with early medieval Europe. Several nonanomalous objects have been retrieved from SCP-8020 since its discovery, many depicting themes of death, judgment, and conflict. Extensive water damage has severely degraded a large majority of SCP-8020\u2019s contents, greatly slowing research and containment efforts. To date, only 27% of associated items have been secured and properly cataloged.\n\n\nThe complex\u2019s full extent has yet to be fully mapped but consists of over 70 distinct earthen chambers across five floors, centered around a massive circular burial chamber. This central burial chamber is characterized by the presence of thirteen identical stone sarcophagi, designated SCP-8020-1 through -13, each adorned with a variety of yet-to-be-deciphered symbols. Radiocarbon dating has suggested that these sarcophagi are upwards of 50,000+ years old.\n\n\nCurrently, only a subsect (-1, -5, -8, -10, -13) has been successfully opened for further examination. Each sarcophagus contains the remains of a humanoid, each in various states of decay. The cadavers are characterized by extensive branching bronze growths engulfing significant portions of their remains, which have displayed constant growth since they were exhumed in 1982. Contents found alongside each body are noted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020-1\n\n\nSCP-8020-5\n\n\nSCP-8020-8\n\n\nSCP-8020-10\n\n\nSCP-8020-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM RETRIEVED:\n A small book, bound in human leather with a bronze spine.

You peer from your study to see the boy nestled calmly upon the floor. His hands were noticeably clasped around an odd grey rectangle, marked with two red dots and a black cross. His fingers, perfectly coordinated, pushed down on the buttons in a rhythm with the screen. Your eyes bore witness to the outcome of his commands: the red man jumps over a beast and collapses the bridge beneath it. When the boy turned to see you, his eyes were filled with an indescribable light. His expression is complimented by a wide grin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey Boss,\n\n\nJust wanted to get clarity on something. In the list of things you needed done, you had included a research project for SCP-8020?

You took note as the sands of time sharpened his wit, his tact, and his tongue. But, no matter what, he was still your boy. Whenever you looked at him, you realized just how much he looked like her.\n\n\nWhen Y2K came and went, and when you were certain he was ready, you approached him with an offer. It was about time you got back on your feet again, and you wanted to bring the boy with you. The way his face lit up when you offered to bring him on as an assistant was something you'd not soon forget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething happened in SCP-8020, Winston.

You had thought he'd have issues with the bookkeeping; only natural. Bureaucracy was a tricky mistress, but she appeared to be far kinder to the boy. When you and Roland first shook hands on the day the Foundation was birthed, the pair of you barely knew the first steps to proper documentation.\n\n\nHow the time flies.\n\n\nIn practice, you held no regrets for your decision. The boy was always on time\u2014always with papers in hand. He appeared perfectly content to live in your shadow. His alias even reflected that fact: \"Thaumiel\". When Thaumiel had gone to meet other councilmen, he was reportedly nothing but cordial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate your advice.

I'm looking down a half-dug hole and I see the bust of some sort of statue- its hands are clasped in prayer. Some of the marble has broken off, revealing mummified flesh. It's like some fucked up angel.\n\n\nIt tells me to rebuild their empire of bronze.\n\n\nI'm getting worried.

D-Block security moved to investigate, reinforced by TRT \"HALBERD\". Rogue subjects, including two security agents, were noted to have already overwhelmed personnel at the western checkpoint and were beginning to regress deeper into the facility.\n\nAt 1635 Hrs, rogue subjects had arrived at the Safe-Class containment wing and would barricade themselves within the eastern checkpoint. The autonomic service system identified one (1) of the turncoat personnel regressing deeper into the facility.\n\nAt 1636 Hrs, TRT \"HALBERD\" would engage subjects barricaded at the checkpoint. Additional security agents, guided by the service system, would motion through evacuation routes to try and intercept the bad actor before loss of containment of any objects could occur.\n\nAt 1645 Hrs, TRT \"HALBERD\" gains control of the checkpoint with only one wounded. 3 suspects are confirmed KIA, 6 suspects wounded, 1 suspect surrendered. The regressing subject remains at large.\n\nAt 1650 Hrs, SCP-8020-13 was removed from its chamber.

Following multiple containment breach attempts, SCP-8020 has been reclassified to Keter and has been moved to the appropriate wing.\n\n\nAll materials within the chamber are to be completely devoid of metal to prevent accidental assimilation. To provide mental stimulation, SCP-8020 will be provided with recreational items that do not contain prohibited materials.\n\n\nAny personnel handling SCP-8020 are to be stripped of any electronics or metallic objects. Exceptions may be made by the head researcher.\n\n\nAs of August 2001, efforts to fulfill the Foundation's primary\n4\n and secondary\n5\n sub-directives have yet to begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020 is an animate humanoid entity first discovered in the caverns underneath Site-03, following the disappearance of items SCP-8020-1 through SCP-8020-13. The entity, first measuring approximately two meters in height and 300 kilograms in weight, has steadily grown since its recovery in March 2001. A significant portion of its anatomy has been replaced with mechanical analogs, including multiple organ systems. While the conversion of its organic components to their bronze counterparts is undeniable, the exact nature of its spread remains unknown.\n\n\nSCP-8020 has been designated a Class-4 Regenerator\n6\n and is capable of completely regenerating lost or damaged structures via the consumption of metallic and/or organic matter. Consumed matter is assimilated into SCP-8020\u2019s anatomy with a high level of conservation and is even capable of preserving the functionality of integrated technological devices and foreign organic matter.\n\n\nDespite showing signs of human-like cognizance, SCP-8020 is incapable of producing coherent sentences, instead communicating with Foundation personnel solely through garbled electronic transmissions and nonsensical, emulated speech. The entity has a volatile temperament, frequently experiencing bouts of unprompted aggression, distress, or panic. Attempts to mitigate these behaviors have been unsuccessful.\n\n\nAs a result of multiple containment breaches within a short time frame, SCP-8020 is currently being investigated for additional anomalous capabilities and has been reclassified from Euclid to Keter in the interim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreach Report #1\n\n\nBreach Report #4\n\n\nBreach Report #9\n\n\nBreach Report #12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of Breach:\n Lock mechanism failure.\n\n\nOverview:\n Following routine cell maintenance by engineers, SCP-8020-13's chamber lock mechanism was swapped with a faulty replacement. After discovering this, SCP-8020-13 attempted to open the door. Upon successfully doing so, -13 would begin to wander the halls of the Euclid Containment Wing before reaching the Safe Containment Wing. Security teams were alerted thirty minutes after the fact via a manual alarm initiation. By the time security personnel arrived to escort SCP-8020-13 back to its chamber, the humanoid was found interacting with SCP-8020-5 before accidentally assimilating it via unknown methods.\n\n\nSCP-8020-5 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n\nNotes:\n Post-breach, SCP-8020-13 was observed possessing scale-like growths along its entire torso region. Following a full-panel SAED\n7\n, SCP-8020-13 was noted to have a slight reality anchoring effect in its immediate vicinity. Further testing is pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of Breach:\n Overt sabotage by third party.\n\n\nOverview:\n An infiltrator, operating under the pseudonym \"Cassie McLaren\" within the Security Department, used their clearance card to deliberately release SCP-8020 during an ongoing containment breach of another SCP object. McLaren, seemingly cognizant of the previous breach attempt, would guide SCP-8020-13 towards the holding chest of SCP-8020-8. After the humanoid assimilated with the object, the infiltrator attempted to escape before the facility's automated service system was able to alert security forces of their suspicious behavior. After an hour of searching, agents were able to capture and interrogate the infiltrator.\n\n\nSCP-8020-8 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n\nNotes (1):\n Infiltrator resisted questioning and appeared unaffected by the administration of mind-influencing compounds. POI held no notable form of ID aside from a moving copper ring in the shape of a snake.\n\n\nNotes (2):\n Post-breach, SCP-8020-13 was witnessed possessing horn-like features. Radios within the vicinity were observed to become disrupted.\n\n\nNotes (3):\n Audio recordings during the breach had shown SCP-8020-13 repeatedly asking the infiltrator if it would take them to its creator. As of now, its supposed creator is unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of Breach:\n Overt sabotage by SCP subject (memetic).\n\n\nOverview:\n SCP-8020-13 managed to escape containment by sabotaging the radios of a nearby guard control and broadcasting an unknown memetic hazard. Hazard resulted in the guard appearing enthralled with SCP-8020-13, whereby it would release the humanoid. As SCP-8020-13 continued to wander the facility, more personnel were infected by the audiohazard. Automated Service System declared a sector-wide lockdown and an immediate deployment request for MTF H-10 (\"See No Evil\") and mobilization of on-site Tactical Response Teams. MTF H-10 severed communications within the facility while Response Team \"FLAIL\" began detaining affected suspects. SCP-8020-13 managed to evade capture for sixty minutes before eventually being tracked and located by MTF H-10. Prior to re-containment, the instance was found gnawing on SCP-8020-1 before completely assimilating it.\n\n\nSCP-8020-1 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n\nNotes:\n Post-breach, an interview with SCP-8020-13 resulted in it reciting several pieces of classified Foundation strategic data. Furthermore, SCP-8020-13 purported mild gastric discomfort despite a lack of appropriate nerve cells within the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of Breach:\n Remote Door Override\n\n\nOverview:\n SCP-8020-13 managed to escape containment following a remote override of the door systems. The origin and nature of the override was unknown. No logs of the occurrence could be retrieved from the Automatic Service System. Several doors would begin to initiate lockdown procedures, preventing security personnel from responding whilst also guiding SCP-8020-13 toward SCP-8020-10. Upon arrival, SCP-8020-10 would consume the oil held within.\n\n\nCameras would observe SCP-8020-13 collapsing and beginning to convulse as bronze growths began to expand at an accelerating rate. During this event, SCP-8020-13 is thought to have gained upwards of 25 tons of additional mass alongside 5 extra feet of height. Audio recording devices picked up a mixture of wailing sounds (interspersed with calls for its creator) and proclamations about its hunger. SCP-8020-13 would proceed to wander the facility and consume any metal in its sight. This includes, but is not limited to, bulkhead containment doors, wiring, weaponry, and containment equipment. The influx of mass resulted in SCP-8020-13 growing further at an even more accelerated rate, further causing an uneven distribution of mass which put considerable anatomical stress on SCP-8020-13.\n\n\nAs a result of the excessive damage, a containment breach cascade would occur. The service system noted that 8 additional objects had escaped containment, which coincided with a complete rescission of all lockdown overrides. In response, a state of emergency would be declared and MTF E-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") would be dispatched to support on-site combative elements and resecure the facility. After 4 hours, all 8 escaped subjects (alongside SCP-8020-13) would be re-contained. Upwards of 35 casualties of on-site personnel were reported, of which 13 were KIA.\n\n\nSCP-8020-10 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n\nNotes (1):\n SCP-8020-13 has begun to continuously generate additional mass, resulting in the object appearing considerably malformed. Distressed, SCP-8020-13 was observed to begin self-mutilating to try and control these growths. At several points, the self-mutilation required the intervention of security teams. A request for a psychological evaluation is pending.\n\n\nNotes (2):\n Following the neutralization of all known SCP-8020 items, SCP-8020-13 has been redesignated as SCP-8020 by RAISA authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM-8000.1: Prediction #2014-001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROPHET HAS SEEN INTO THE FUTURE.\n\n\n5\u00a014\u00a04\u00a015\u00a018\u00a08\u00a05\u00a09\u00a03\n\n\nARAL WILL DRY, SAND WILL SEE THE SUN.\n\n\nALPHA, DELTA, WHISKEY.\n\n\nSOLDIERS DONNING HELMETS MADE OF SKY WILL WALK THE FLATS.\n\n\n3\u00a015\u00a01\u00a012\u00a09\u00a020\u00a09\u00a015\u00a014\u00a09\u00a019\u00a020\n\n\nTHEY WILL FIND THE GRAVE OF A MONARCH.\n\n\nROMEO, ECHO, DELTA.\n\n\nIGNORANT, THEY WILL TRY TO DESTROY IT.\n\n\n3\u00a015\u00a012\u00a012\u00a01\u00a016\u00a019\u00a05\n\n\nTHE PARADIGM WILL SHIFT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou had failed.\n\n\nWhat more was there to be said?

The Overwatch's attention is on him.\n\n\nADMIN:\n I'm sorry, my mind must have wandered.\n\n\nO5-10:\n Of course. We're moving on to the next item on our agenda, yes?\n\n\nADMIN:\n Er- yes- yes I believe we are.\n\n\nThe Administrator gets his papers in order and clears his throat. The rest of Overwatch do not break their gaze.\n\n\nADMIN:\n Next in the order of our- uh- agenda: SCP-8020's reclassification from Keter to Thaumiel.\n\n\nADMIN:\n For context: in an interview conducted in the early months of 2002, SCP-8020 spoke of a catastrophic situation befalling the Coalition. It divulged information about an anomalous artifact that they would discover and attempt to terminate: a statue.\n\n\nADMIN:\n An investigation was opened and remained open until three weeks ago. It would be closed for a lack of evidence.\n\n\nADMIN:\n Last week, we received an emergency communication requesting that Foundation assets support Coalition operations inside of ADW-01\n8\n.\n\n\nADMIN:\n Tactical Response agents from Site-03 and Site-19 were deployed to the location, with MTF-Nu-7\n9\n on standby. After about six hours, Foundation and Coalition agents were able to suppress the situation.\n\n\nADMIN:\n Since then, SCP-8020 has made 40 additional predictions. This includes, but is not limited to: the containment breaches of varying magnitudes, hostile incursions, major veil threats, etcetera. All of them correct to some degree.\n\n\nADMIN:\n With that being said, the Council may proceed with the discussion. Additional information can be found in your folders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour ears drank in the mixture of words once you gave the Council the floor. Their discussions wandered through the pros, cons, and ethical concerns, all down to the very last detail. Meanwhile, you were busy thinking about what could have been.\n\n\nNonetheless, you couldn't help but notice something: Roland was completely silent. When the topic of fulfilling the Foundation's sub-directives arose, you saw his brow furrow and his hand twitch slightly. When he was addressed directly, his usual informality and warmth had left him. He was cold and curt. When he caught onto your staring, he'd stammer before correcting his attitude.\n\n\nYou began to squint\u2014then your eyes widened. You felt your face run cold. Your adrenal glands were squeezed of everything they had. Your legs began to tremble beneath the table.\n\n\nThe words \"No\u2026\" silently pushed past your lips. When the vote concluded, you couldn't leave that meeting any faster than you had.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|1-5O#tni.pcs.10etis|1-5O\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinston,\n\n\nI couldn't help but notice you were acting odd in the meeting.

With heavy reluctance, your head pulls itself away from the hard-wood surface as your spine cranes your form into an upright position.\n\n\nYour eyelids, initially sealed shut by the near-unconquerable forces of fatigue, slowly peel themselves apart. You fell asleep at your desk again. For the past several years, it was the closest thing you could call a bed. Empty alcohol bottles are strewn about the floor.\n\n\nThe consequences of your actions would sooner or later catch up with you as your nervous system screeches in terror, awakening your limbic system. Hot, pounding, pain thrums along both hemispheres of your brain. An incessant ache ripples up your neck and wedges itself neatly at the base of your skull. You helplessly cradle the ache.\n\n\nInhale.\n\n\nExhale.\n\n\nThis is where it ends, isn't it? A pitiful man, lost in a sea of hopelessness and booze. You allow yourself to stew amongst your self-pity for several minutes\u2014you've earned that right. However, the buzzing of your mobile seems to disagree. Lifting it up, your eyes adjust to the blinding screen: an email. A sigh escapes your lips, and then a rolling groan overtakes it.\n\n\nWith a heavy finger, you press against the power button of your terminal. The start-up messages rush right past you and the lights of your desktop flush your face in the token whites, blacks, and dull yellows of the facility's operating system. Your cursor, after taking much longer than it needed to, strikes upon the icon of an envelope; whereupon, you are frozen in your seat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO:\n \ntni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda#tni.pcs.10etis|rotartsinimda\n\n\nFROM:\n \ntni.pcs.tenpics|ylperon#tni.pcs.tenpics|ylperon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello ADMINISTRATOR,\n\n\nPages you're currently following have been updated:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020\n\n\n\n\nThe file can be accessed via the ninth catalog under the SCiPnet database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou were hesitant for a moment.

Additionally, personnel are to avoid making contact with the apex of any protrusions (spines) in the spinal, dewlap, or oral regions as they serve as a vector of transmission for a potent genotoxin.\n\n\nElectronics, metallic objects, etcetera, are strictly prohibited within SCP-8020\u2019s containment and immediate sectors surrounding it. Exceptions may be made by a ruling body of Level-5 clearance assigned to the SCP-8020 project, or any member of the O5 Council.\n\n\nAs of January 2014, SCP-8020 has been reclassified from Keter to Thaumiel and its clearance requisite has been amended appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020 is the designation given to the heavily altered remains of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, currently 12 meters tall and weighing 140 tons, which has been significantly transformed by the extensive mechanical augmentations responsible for its prolonged existence. Now designated a Terminarch-Class entity\n10\n and Class-7 Regenerator\n11\n, SCP-8020 is perpetually growing in size and complexity, generating profound quantities of bronze components and poorly differentiated organic matter daily.\n\n\nDespite multiple attempts to regulate its growth, SCP-8020\u2019s anatomy has become increasingly deformed by progressive gigantism and self-mutilation. Superficially resembling the Persian manticore, disproportionate allocations of mass have resulted in grotesque elongation of the spine and neck, along with the formation of numerous ornamental structures, including flightless wings, horns, and a tail. No longer capable of supporting a vertical posture, the extent of SCP-8020\u2019s size and alteration have forced the subject into a quadrupedal gait.\n\n\nThe subject\u2019s identifiable organic components, consisting only of the skull, nervous system, and scattered tissue fragments, remain intact but heavily distorted to fit SCP-8020\u2019s extreme anatomy. Blood continuously seeps from crevices in SCP-8020\u2019s exterior plating and is hypothesized to assist in cooling and lubricating its various components. The functionality of SCP-8020\u2019s central nervous system has demonstrated a slow but irreversible decline in recent years - despite continued animation of the construct, attempts to differentiate the subject\u2019s consciousness from digital emulations have been inconclusive.\n\n\nWhile initially adverse to its augmentations, SCP-8020 has slowly come to conceptualize its transformation as a form of human transcendence, likening it to GOI-004B\u2019s practice of \u201cStandardization\u201d. Since its reclassification to Thaumiel, the subject has become enamored with its mechanical state, actively shaping the growth of its components and referring to itself as a fragment of the Church\u2019s namesake deity, \u201cMEKHANE\u201d. While efforts conducted by the Division of Para-anthropology have found little in the way of suggesting that the automaton is the Broken God, SCP-8020 possesses several attributes that appear to be consistent with its delusions of grandeur (most notably its robust predictive faculties) and are believed to stem from paratechnological components found within it. These components have been designated as sub-instances (SCP-8020-1 to SCP-8020-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020-1\n\n\nSCP-8020-5\n\n\nSCP-8020-8\n\n\nSCP-8020-10\n\n\nSCP-8020-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the absence of a large and small intestinal tract\n12\n, SCP-8020 possesses upwards of 30 advanced data storage banks with a make that resembles DEEPWELL catalogs\n13\n of Foundation origin (designated SCP-8020-1). Their continued method of operation, despite the immense internal temperature of SCP-8020, is unknown. As of 29/12/2022, engineers and technical researchers were able to extract heavily encrypted data from all catalogs. However, AIC-assisted cryptanalysis has yet to yield any viable results.\n\n\nThis broad dataset has been utilized to its fullest extent by SCP-8020's processors, allowing it to generate highly detailed predictive models. These models have successfully been used as an early alert system, predicting 162 significant incidents with 97% accuracy since 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral plated scales that completely cover the torso of SCP-8020. Initially disregarded as a mundane facet, mass spectrometry has allowed researchers to discover that the scales are not derived from a standard bronze alloy. Rather, the scales are made up of beryllium bronze that are complimented by unknown runes. Now designated SCP-8020-5, they appear to protect SCP-8020 from the effects of reality warping. Applications are pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially purely decorative, SCP-8020's horns (designated SCP-8020-8) have recently become the source of a potent beta-type audiohazard\n14\n that can be received by most electronic radios within a 5-mile radius of the entity's containment well. First observed during Incident-8945.3, the audiohazard in question appears to only be effective on subjects with a mind-affecting resistance score (MARS) of, or below, 5 out of 10. Subjects affected by the audiohazard appear enthralled with SCP-8020 (to the point of religious zealotry) and proselytizing fantastical, albeit entirely fabricated, stories centering around the entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8020 possesses a potent genotoxic venom (designated SCP-8020-10) that is administered either via fangs or contact with the apex of one of its many serrated protrusions along the dewlap and spine. Oral venom sacs appear to have replaced salivary glands, whilst spinal and dewlapine sacs are located in an analogous hypodermic region. Subdermal injection of SCP-8020-10 results in the rapid replacement of most visible organic tissue with bronze as a result of an anomalous chromosomal aberration which alters and replaces the production of collagen I with the latter. It is important to consider that SCP-8020 has previously referred to this process as \u201cStandardization\u201d, a phrase used by GOI-004B to denote submission in preparation for anomalous enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA protective layer made of ivory. Appears to shield sections of the central nervous system (notably the spine). It's known to regenerate faster than other components and is believed to be the reason why bronze growths have not been found within the central nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM-8000.2: Prediction #2020-124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROPHET HAS SEEN INTO THE FUTURE.\n\n\n23\u00a09\u00a014\u00a019\u00a020\u00a015\u00a014\n\n\nA MAN WILL BE CONDEMNED.\n\n\n18\u00a015\u00a012\u00a01\u00a014\u00a04\n\n\nTHE PARADIGM WILL SHIFT.\n\n\n18\u00a05\u00a04\u00a00\u00a017\u00a021\u00a05\u00a05\u00a014\n\n\n1981 - THE SUN IS SETTING.\n\n\nSIERRA, UNIFORM, NOVEMBER, DELTA, OSCAR, WHISKEY, NOVEMBER\n\n\nCHARLIE, OSCAR, NOVEMBER, SIERRA, PAPA, INDIA, ROMEO, ALPHA, CHARLIE, YANKEE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelish in what you have seen: your son is an abomination of metal and organs.

        "At 1621 Hrs, Site-03's autonomic service system triggered an emergency alarm due to an unauthorized release of multiple Class-D subjects. D-Block security moved to investigate, reinforced by TRT \"HALBERD\". Rogue subjects, including two security agents, were noted to have already overwhelmed personnel at the western checkpoint and were beginning to regress deeper into the facility. At 1635 Hrs, rogue subjects had arrived at the Safe-Class containment wing and would barricade themselves within the eastern checkpoint. The autonomic service system identified one (1) of the turncoat personnel regressing deeper into the facility. At 1636 Hrs, TRT \"HALBERD\" would engage subjects barricaded at the checkpoint. Additional security agents, guided by the service system, would motion through evacuation routes to try and intercept the bad actor before loss of containment of any objects could occur. At 1645 Hrs, TRT \"HALBERD\" gains control of the checkpoint with only one wounded. 3 suspects are confirmed KIA, 6 suspects wounded, 1 suspect surrendered. The regressing subject remains at large. At 1650 Hrs, SCP-8020-13 was removed from its chamber. A lockdown was initiated by the service system. At 1651 Hrs, the lockdown is rescinded. At 1655 Hrs, security agents arrive at SCP-8020's containment and verify that only one of the thirteen instances is missing. A full sweep of the S-Wing is conducted. Neither suspects nor SCP-8020-13 can be located.",
