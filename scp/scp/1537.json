SCP-1537-\u2588\u2588 is contained in the same manner as SCP-1537-B instances, with several specifications. The chamber is constructed of lead-lined steel and equipped with dosimeters. Should said equipment detect gamma radiation at levels of 10 grays per hour or greater, it will be assumed that SCP-1537-\u2588\u2588 is displaying extra-dimensional properties [DATA EXPUNGED] If 10 grays per hour or greater are detected, the chamber is to be saturated with nitrous oxide until the event has been neutralized. SCP-1537-\u2588\u2588 has been observed to sleep, pace, meditate, and converse with itself (or possibly an unknown entity). Any activity that does not fall within these parameters must be reported immediately to a Level 5 supervisor. In the event that nitrous oxide saturation fails to subdue SCP-1537-\u2588\u2588, Contingency-Hadraniel-Alpha must be implemented (see Secure-File-Thanatos-1537). The failure of Hadraniel-Alpha constitutes the immediate detonation of Area-\u2588\u2588\u2588's on-site thermonuclear device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1537 is a language associated with a group identified as \"The Brothers of Akul'hil\" (TBOA). SCP-1537 demonstrates no connection to or similarities with any known terrestrial language. Details regarding the origin and purpose of TBOA are presently speculative. The first known incident traced to SCP-1537 occurred in 1982 and involved several prolific groups of interest, specifically the Global Occult Coalition. Further information on SCP-1537's discovery may be found in Document-SCP-1537-Alpha.\n\n\nSCP-1537-1 is a phrase in SCP-1537 which, when spoken aloud, produces an anomalous reaction in human beings that perceive it. There are two discrete presentations of this reaction (SCP-1537-A and SCP-1537-B). SCP-1537-1 is roughly translatable as [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSCP-1537-A is the more common reaction (over 99% of subjects). Individuals affected by SCP-1537-A will undergo the following progression of symptoms:\n\n\n\n\nInitial exposure: Asymptomatic\n\n\n1-2 days: Metallic taste, fever (39 degrees Centigrade)\n\n\n2 days - 1 week: Fatigue, shortness of breath, mild jaundice\n\n\n1 - 2 weeks: Internal bleeding, angina\n\n\n2 weeks: Death and subsequent transformation\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after exposure, the subject's body will rapidly disintegrate, producing a mass of pseudo-liquid material. What comprises this mass is inconclusive: some human organic materials are present, however, the majority of its composition remains unidentified. These entities are either autonomous or sentient, and are capable of both locomotion and altering their mass/shape (mass increases of 200% have been observed). The variety of shapes that SCP-1537-A entities can assume is virtually limitless, and they are capable of increasing their durability to approximately the strength of steel. The amorphous and metamorphic nature of SCP-1537-A render them resilient to most forms of physical damage; immolation is thus far the only known method of termination. In combat, SCP-1537-A have been observed to produce various appendages and structures, most often tendrils of varying length. SCP-1537-A are exceptionally agile and can propel themselves at speeds reaching 81km/h. While mainly inert, SCP-1537-A may be provoked into violence by hostile action against it, or if ordered to by SCP-1537-B instances and members of TBOA.\n\n\nSCP-1537-B is a rarer reaction (less than 1% of subjects) and produces no physical symptoms or effects. Subjects affected by SCP-1537-B demonstrate progressively fluent awareness of SCP-1537 and are capable of reproducing the language in both text and speaking. SCP-1537-1 is universally the first phrase that SCP-1537-B instances comprehend. SCP-1537-B do not display any observed psychological changes or abnormalities in contrast to their prior mental state and demonstrate a reasonable degree of surprise in response to their own comprehension of SCP-1537. However, SCP-1537-B appear to be more vulnerable to suggestion and persuasion by TBOA.\n\n\nSCP-1537-B instances are capable of giving instructions to SCP-1537-A instances in both SCP-1537 and terrestrial languages. These instructions may encompass anything from simple chores to attack orders. In addition, SCP-1537-A are both entirely loyal towards and extremely protective of SCP-1537-B, and will use their bodies as shields for the latter.\n\n\n\n\nDATA EXPUNGED: INFORMATION REGARDING SCP-1537-\u2588\u2588 HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO SECURE-FILE-THANATOS-1537 (CLEARANCE 5/1537 REQUIRED).\n\n\n\n\nAddendum [1537-001]:\n Recovered Materials\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0documentation\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\nThe following materials were recovered from the Global Occult Coalition in 1982.\n\n\n\n\nFile 0423-7B\n\n\nReconnaissance Report\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\nThe source was two men (Caucasian: 25-35, Brown/Green; Middle Eastern: 30-40, Black/Brown) claiming to be \"the representatives of Akul'hil.\" We have no reports of any terrestrial, extraterrestrial, or extra-dimensional entities matching this identification. Intelligence from our sources within other organizations are likewise negative, though that stance is tentative.

I can't make head or tail of it, neither can anybody else. They keep repeating this one phrase: [DATA EXPUNGED] Nobody else thinks anything of it, but I keep hearing the words [REDACTED] in my head whenever I hear them say that. What on earth is that about?
