It is to be placed on a pedestal and shielded with impact-resistant glass during experiments. Only one subject at a time is allowed to be in the testing chamber with SCP-7211.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7211 is a 40\u00a0cm tall porcelain doll resembling a human male dressed in a red jester uniform, it is noted to have a distressed expression on its face. SCP-7211's anomalous properties will be triggered if there is at least one human being in SCP-7211's close proximity (2 meters or closer).\n\n\nOnce its anomalous properties are triggered SCP-7211 will become animate and start to speak. Usually, there is no conversation between SCP-7211 and the subjects, it usually stands up in front of the subjects and starts to tell various jokes, and puns. If the subjects don't find SCP-7211's performance funny they will start to cause self-harm and showcase temporary anomalous properties. (See Experiment log).\n\n\nIf the subject leaves SCP-7211's vicinity regardless of willingly or not, SCP-7211 will return to its dormant state. Interviewed subjects described the experience as \"second-hand embarrassment cranked up to eleven\" in unison.\n\n\nExperiment log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nJoke\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-8567\n\n\nI'm afraid for the calendar. Its days are numbered.\n\n\nThe chair D-8567 was sitting on suddenly transformed into a 100\u00a0kg tomato. D-8567 tried to lift it up and throw it at SCP-7211 but it was too heavy for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-1462\n\n\nHow do you follow Will Smith in the snow? You follow the fresh prints.\n\n\nD-1462 began to scream then a glass window manifested on the wall and D-1462 jumped through it. The window itself disappeared and D-1462 was later found lying unconscious on Site Director Katona's office desk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-9966\n\n\nI only know 25 letters of the alphabet. I don't know y.\n\n\nD-9966 ripped off both of his legs from mid-thigh and swallowed them whole then both legs grew back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-0007\n\n\nWhy couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired.\n\n\nD-0007 transformed into a bicycle and attempted to run over SCP-7211. Once the security personnel removed him from the testing chamber D-0007 transformed back but for the next two hours, he was only able to make sounds similar to a bicycle bell instead of human speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-2377\n\n\nI once had a dream I was floating in an ocean of orange soda. It was more of a Fanta-sea.\n\n\nD-2377 yelled \"I'm sick of this planet!\" and his uniform transformed into a Superman costume then he breached containment by flying through the ceiling but later he was recaptured when he approached \nArea-32.\n His anomalous properties ceased an hour later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-4544\n\n\nI'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it.\n\n\nA bottle of Class-\u2588 amnestic agent manifested in D-4544's hands which he drank resulting in the loss of at least five years of memories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-4269\n1\n\n\nWhen does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.\n\n\nD-4269 began to laugh so hard that he started to hyperventilate and was transferred to the medical wing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the experiment with D-4269, SCP-7211's facial expression turned from distressed to cheerful and refused to tell jokes to subjects except for D-4269.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Using D-4269 for the test was originally recommended by the rest of the Site-228's D-Class personnel population because he is infamous for having a bad sense of humor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-7210\n | SCP-7211 | \nSCP-7212\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7211\n\" by Cremo, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
