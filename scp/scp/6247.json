All noticeable debris emerging from SCP-6247 is to be retrieved and stored in a secure containment unit at Site-184. Constant monitoring of SCP-6247 for fluctuations in anomalous activity is to be carried out.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6247 is the designation given to a structure found on the seafloor of the Atlantic Ocean. SCP-6247 exists in a constant state of flux between an unconfirmed number of realities, rendering a full mapping of the structure unfeasible. From time to time, debris is violently expelled from SCP-6247 in a manner consistent with that of an explosion. Of note is that all debris recovered from SCP-6247 has exhibited signs of stress consistent with depths of -6,000 meters below sea level.\n1\n\n\nA secondary anomalous effect that has been attributed to SCP-6247 manifests as a series of messages encoded through standard Foundation methods; these messages are transmitted repeatedly at regular intervals. The content of these messages is displayed below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[UNKNOWN COLLISION IN SECTOR 4B. PLEASE REMAIN CALM.]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n[CHARYBDIS PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTED.

Upon retrieval, the contents of the box were examined and sent to Site-184 for study due to the site's proximity. The box contained documentation on several unobserved aquatic anomalies attributed to a non-existent Foundation facility located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nNo data recovered has been linked to any existing Foundation operation, and is to be disregarded.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The Atlantic Ocean has an average depth of 3,646m, with a maximum depth of around 5,000m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6246\n | SCP-6247 | \nSCP-6248\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6247\n\" by Fishish, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
