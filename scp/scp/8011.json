All subjects pictured are deceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n All SCP-8011-A instances are to be captured and taken to the nearest Foundation Site as soon as possible. Due to dangers of SCP-8011-A instances attacking or retaliating against Foundation operatives during the process of capture, provisions such as bite-proof gloves, helmets, neck guards, and body armor must be made for the protection of the operatives.\n\n\nAs SCP-8011-A instances are formally deceased, no provisions are have to be made for their sustenance and comfort while in containment. Care must always be taken in order to prevent total destruction of specimens during capture or containment. Aside from this, however, all damage to instances is acceptable.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8011 describes a worldwide phenomenon where individuals who died on or after November 23, 2019 are \u201cresurrected\u201d. All instances of SCP-8011 resurrection events have been shown to transpire exactly 368 days after death\n1\n. Individuals resurrected in such events are designated SCP-8011-A instances.\n\n\nUpon resurrection, an SCP-8011-A instance displays the following traits:\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced or active decay typically expected of a corpse. After resurrection, continued decay in SCP-8011-A instances is observed to be markedly delayed.\n\n\nVocalizations that can include low growling, pained moaning, or loud screaming.\n\n\nHyperaggressive behavior towards one specific targeted person at a time, usually resulting in the death of the targeted person\n\n\nThe tendency to consume only one part of their victims\u2019 body, typically the face or hands.\n2\n\n\nAn animalistic intelligence facilitating tool use\n3\n and hunting strategies.\n\n\nAn imperviousness to physical damage, such as with firearms, bladed weapons, and blunt weapons.\n4\n\n\nA tendency to lower the hume count\n5\n of any particular area by a negligible amount once in a \u201clucid state\u201d following successful consumption.\n6\n\n\n\n\nThese traits have been observed to continue until the SCP-8011-A instance has consumed a select part of their victim\u2019s body. Upon consumption, the SCP-8011-A instance abruptly ceases attacking and flees the scene, typically to a hiding place heretofore referred to as a burrow [see Addendum 8011.2]. At this time, an SCP-8011-A instance has shown to be capable of articulate speech, with some being capable of entering \u201clucid states\u201d under select circumstances. After an extended time (typically 5 days to 2 weeks), the SCP-8011-A returns to its aggressive stance and pursues a different victim, continuing the cycle.\n\n\nAddendum 8011.1:\n Based on extrapolation from later events, the first resurrection event occurred on November 25, 2020. The first cases of murders reasonably thought to have been due to attacks by SCP-8011-A instances, however, occurred as late as November 31, 2020. This has been thought to have been due to the time that SCP-8011-A instances would have spent emerging from their burial places, with instances that had been shallowly buried or had been buried with coffins made out of fragile materials (such as wood) emerging first. Likewise, any case of early killings by SCP-8011-A instances in developing countries could have been underreported, further adding uncertainty to the possible first case of an SCP-8011-A attack.\n\n\nBelow is a list of selected cases of the first SCP-8011-A attacks, along with relevant details about the persons involved.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n November 30, 2020\n\n\nLocation:\n Tokyo, Japan\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Unidentified, presumed to have died between November 23, 2019 and November 28, 2019. Index case, classified as SCP-8011-A-1\n\n\nName of Victim:\n Michiko Niida\n\n\nDescription:\n At 22:21, the Japanese emergency police hotline received a request for help from Niida, who had reported that there was a dissheveled man following her as she walked through the streets of the Akasaka District. Upon being asked for details about her pursuer, Niida reported that she did not know who he was, and that he was holding a rock. The emergency dispatcher attempted to ask her for further details, but was cut short by Niida screaming, followed by sounds of her running. At 22:22, Niida is heard dropping her smartphone. Six seconds later, a man\u2019s maniacal laughter is heard.\n\n\nAt 22:26, Japanese police officers arrive at the scene. After two minutes of searching, they find the body of a woman in a remote alley. Early attempts at confirmation of the victim\u2019s identity were delayed due to severe facial disfigurement, with most of the flesh having been removed from her facial region. Later autopsy results would conclude that the woman had died due to blood loss secondary to blunt force trauma to her skull and her previously mentioned facial injuries, which showed signs of injury from human teeth. As such, she has thought to have still been alive when her pursuer removed her face.\n\n\nAttempts at investigation by Japanese authorities were hampered by the apparent disappearance of the suspect from the scene of the crime. Bloody handprints were discovered 20m from the scene, leading to a manhole into the sewers. Upon further exploration of the sewers, Japanese authorities found a half-eaten nose belonging to Niida. However, no sign was found of her killer.\n\n\nWhen interviewed, people living close to the manhole reported hearing \u201ccackling\u201d laughter, followed by crying. These noises were said to have been punctuated by chewing and choking noises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n December 1, 2020\n\n\nLocation:\n Dasmarinas City, The Philippines\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Anya Santos, died on November 23, 2019. Classified as SCP-8011-A-2\n\n\nName of Victim:\n Guillermo Luis Santos III\n\n\nDescription:\n At 6:23, a call is made from the home of the recently deceased Anya Santos to a house in Manila inhabited by Gina Torres, her mother. Due to the fact that Torres was an elderly person habitually taking sleeping pills, she was not awoken by the phone ringing.\n\n\nFrom 06:23 to 06:50, 18 more calls were made to the landline of the residence, to no avail. At 06:52, a message was sent to the account of Gina Torres from her 8 year old granddaughter, Haruka Santos, the daughter of Anya Santos. This was followed by several more messages, which stopped at 07:12. At 09:13, Gina Torres wakes up and checks her phone. The messages sent by Haruka Santos to Gina Torres are included below. These have been translated from Filipino for posterity.\n\n\n\n\n06:52 - \u201cgrandma, mommys back and she keeps crying outside the door and she woke us up by knocking on the door\u201d\n\n06:52 - \u201cermo is scared, hes hugging me\u201d\n\n06:53 - \u201cgrandma mommy keeps crying she says she wants to see me again\u201d\n\n06:58 - \u201cermos hiding in his room\u201d\n\n07:12 - \u201cgrandma mommy found the key\u201d\n\n\n\n\nUpon seeing the messages, Gina Torres immediately dressed up and drove from Manila to Dasmarinas City, but was delayed by heavy traffic. She was able to arrive at the Santos residence at 11:14.\n\n\nUpon arriving, Gina Torres found Haruka Santos crying in the room of her 6 year old brother, \u201cErmo\u201d, whose real name was Guillermo Santos III. Blood was found on Guillermo\u2019s bed, but neither the child nor SCP-8011-A-2 are found. Gina Torres attempted to ask her what had happened, but Haruka Santos was not able to speak articulately for several days following the incident. Upon arriving at the scene, police officers were unable to ascertain where Guillermo had gone, or who had been the perpetrator for his disappearance. They were able to track a woman in a bloody white dress running from the direction of the Santos residence at 7:14 AM on nearby security cameras, but were unable to find her.\n\n\nOn December 5, 2020, Haruka\u2019s father Guillermo Santos II returned home on emergency shore leave. Upon meeting his daughter, Haruka immediately ran to hug her father while crying uncontrollably. In between bouts of crying, Haruka was heard saying \u201cMommy wanted to see me again. So Mommy ate Ermo\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\n\nThe Santos case was reported on the local news and was the topic of online conversation for several days. Following several more cases of similar attacks in other countries, Foundation observer staff were asked to further investigate a possible anomaly behind the cases, with instructions to dispatch Foundation Mobile Task Forces to the scene of a possible attack.\n\n\nAs of June 20, 2021, the bodies of both Anya Santos and Guillermo Santos III have not yet been found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n December 6, 2020\n\n\nLocation:\n Boston, The United States\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Arnold Malkovich, died on November 23, 2019. Classified as SCP-8011-A-14\n\n\nName of Victim:\n Anna Bornholm\n\n\nDescription:\n At 12:32 in the afternoon, a \u201chomeless man in a tattered suit\u201d is reported breaking into an office building in Boston. According to security camera footage, the man, identified to be the deceased Arnold Malkovich (heretofore referred to as SCP-8011-A-14), is seen walking into the glass doors of the office building while displaying a shambling gait. After a short altercation with security officers, it is able to enter one of the building\u2019s elevators and use it to travel up to the fifteenth floor.\n\n\nWhile inside, it is seen shaking with rage, often stumbling while pacing in circles. It is also seen punching the walls of the elevator cab while screaming. As the elevator doors open on the fifteenth floor, SCP-8011-A-14 is seen running at a full sprint outside of the cab, bumping into several people passing by. As it passes several meeting rooms, it is seen looking into the windows of each one. Eventually, it comes to a stop outside of meeting room 8901, where department head Anna Bornholm is conducting a business meeting with company executives. Seeing Bornholm, SCP-8011-A-14 immediately jumps through the window of the meeting room, breaking the glass. Upon stumbling to his feet, SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s eyes focus on Bornholm, and it immediately attacks her. For several seconds, the subject is seen grabbing Bornholm\u2019s hair and banging her head on the nearby plywood wall, creating a small hole. One of the executives in the room immediately attempts to call security.\n\n\nOutside of the room, Catherine Marsh, a friend of Bornholm, calls 911 and describes the situation while in a panic. Upon hearing this, observation staff at the nearby Site-18 immediately dispatch a small MTF to investigate the disturbance.\n\n\nIn the 12 minutes between the initial attack and the arrival of Foundation operatives, SCP-8011-A-14 continues to attack Bornholm. 9 minutes after the first attack, SCP-8011-A-14 finally ceases attacking Bornholm after eating three fingers from her right hand. Realizing that Bornholm was dead, SCP-8011-A-14 runs from the scene, biting two officers who attempt to restrain it as it escapes. As it runs down the stairs to the lobby, Foundation operatives disguised as police officers arrive at the scene and attempt to subdue Malkovich through the use of taser guns. When this was proven ineffective, the operatives opted for physical restraint instead. Like earlier, SCP-8011-A-14 attacks those who come close to it, and is only successfully subdued when an operative tackles and then restrains it on the ground.\n\n\nRecognizing that SCP-8011-A instances always attempt to flee from the scene of the attack, SCP-8011-A-14 is implanted with a tracker at the instruction of Site-18\u2019s director. The subject is then allowed to escape, with Foundation researchers at Site-18 observing the path that it takes to its destination and remotely listening in to the microphone feed. [See Addendum 8011.2]\n\n\nFollowing the attack, Anna Bornholm was rushed to the hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. Her cause of death was repeated blunt force trauma to the head.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8011.2:\n The following addendum describes the observations and subsequent interviews conducted on SCP-8011-A-14 following its tracker implantation on December 6, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 6, 2020:\n The instance is seen running north from the city of Boston without stopping. It avoids major roads when needed. In cases where it is impossible to cross an area with major foot traffic, SCP-8011-A-14 instead opts to wait in hidden places.\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2020:\n SCP-8011-A-14 spends most of the early morning continuing to walk north, arriving at the Middlesex Fells Reservation by 05:23. It again takes care to avoid other people, before entering an access point into the sewers below the reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Middlesex Fells Reservation burrow, located within the sewers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:10\n - Upon entering, SCP-8011-A-14 is heard mumbling to itself and tapping on the nearby pipes. It is heard whistling soon after. It continues to slowly walk through the sewers.\n\n\n7:22\n - SCP-8011-A-14 is heard running quickly through the sewers, before inserting a thin object through an unknown slot. It is heard speaking intellegibly for the first time, stating \u201cFuck, I was almost late there.\u201d It is then seen entering a dead end in the sewers through the tracker. It is heard ruffling its clothes and running a hand through its hair.\n\n\n7:27\n - Afterwards, SCP-8011-A-14 rushes to a small recessed room in the sewers, before it is heard sitting down in a corner and tapping on the floor as if it were a keyboard. Occasionally, it makes clicking sounds as if trying to replicate the clicks of a mouse. It is then heard grumbling to itself, before exclaiming \u201cGoddamnit, another audit.\u201d From there, SCP-8011-A-14 pretends to work until 11:30.\n\n\n11:30\n - SCP-8011-A-14 stands up from its corner and walks out of the recessed room to take its \u201clunch break\u201d. It is eventually heard sitting down again as it converses with another imaginary coworker who it refers to as \u201cCat\u201d. Eventually, SCP-8011-A-14 begins to talk to another coworker, who it calls \u201cAnnie\u201d. The subject continues to talk at length about its promotion to middle management, as well as comforting Annie on her being passed up for the promotion in favor of it. At the end of its \u201cbreak\u201d, SCP-8011-A-14 returns to the recessed room and continues to pretend to \u201cwork\u201d.\n\n\n13:30\n - SCP-8011-A-14 slowly walks outside, towards the many voices outside its recessed room. As it gets closer, at least 12 individual voices can be discerned, ranging from children to the elderly. Unusually, however, none of the voices seem to be replying to one another. Instead, they seem to be having different conversations individually. Likewise, SCP-8011-A-14 makes no further indication that it can hear the voices around it. SCP-8011-A-14 then continues to \u201cwork\u201d through its day.\n\n\n16:30\n - Eventually, at the end of its shift, SCP-8011-A-14 once again stands up from its room. It is heard slotting a thin object through the pipes again, and walking deeper into the sewers. With it, the voices from the previous area slowly disappear with distance.\n\n\n17:00\n - SCP-8011-A-14 comes to a room. Inside it, it is heard laying down on the floor and sighing to himself. It is heard saying \u201cHome at last.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14 calls out to a person it specifies as \u201cHoney.\u201d It then calls out again, only to be apparently met with no imaginary reply. After waiting for several seconds, it is heard collapsing to the ground.\n\n\n17:32\n - SCP-8011-A-14 begins to cry to itself.\n\n\n20:32\n - SCP-8011-A-14 is heard snoring.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 8, 2020:\n SCP-8011-A-14 repeats its routine from the day before. However, at 7:57, a new voice is heard speaking unintellegibly as it enters the room where SCP-8011-A-14 is in. The instance makes no indication that it can hear the newly entering person.\n\n\n8:00 - 11:30\n - Both SCP-8011-A-14 and the new person are heard speaking over each other as both pretend to \u201cwork\u201d at their jobs. With each time it picks an object up, the new person asks \u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d before conversing with another imaginary person. Both then continue to \u201cwork\u201d until the end of their \u201cshifts.\u201d\n\n\n17:00\n - SCP-8011-A-14 goes back \u201chome\u201d. It once again calls out to \u201cHoney\u201d. After not being answered after several tries, it is heard collapsing against a wall once again and crying.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2020:\n Both the subject and the other person then continue to \u201cwork\u201d until their lunch breaks.\n\n\n12:30\n - As SCP-8011-A-14 eats lunch with imaginary coworkers, the other person is heard screaming from the recessed room. It repeatedly shouts \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d to itself before banging its head on the walls. Bones are heard cracking as it does so. SCP-8011-A-14 makes no indication that it hears this or the other voices in the room. Soon after, the other person runs out from the room screaming, with the sound echoing throughout the greater room that SCP-8011-A-14 is. It disappears as the other person grows more distant.\n\n\n17:00\n - SCP-8011-A-14 comes \u201chome\u201d. It calls out to \u201cHoney\u201d once again, before crying in a corner. It keeps repeating \u201cI can do this, I can do this\u201d to itself.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 10, 2020:\n SCP-8011-A-14 continues its normal activities. Several more voices are heard in the greater room outside the subject\u2019s \u201cworkplace.\u201d As one is heard screaming hysterically, SCP-8011-A-14 is heard pausing its tapping on the floor. Afterwards, it resumes.\n\n\nUpon going home, SCP-8011-A-14 no longer calls out for \u201cHoney\u201d. Instead, it immediately lays down and goes to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 11, 2020:\n Upon arriving at its \u201cworkplace\u201d, the sound of the other person occupying SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s room is heard once again taking another call in a manner akin to a 911 dispatcher\n7\n Upon hearing the other person\u2019s voice, SCP-8011-A-14 visibly stops at the entrance, before slowly sitting at the part of the room furthest away from the other person. Upon doing this, SCP-8011-A-14 continues to \u201cwork.\u201d\n\n\n12:30\n - Upon conducting its lunch break, SCP-8011-A-14 continues to converse with its imaginary coworkers, but stops at multiple points due to the loud noises made by the other voices in the room. It is heard hyperventilating as this happens.\n\n\n13:30\n - After it ends its lunch break, SCP-8011-A-14 enters the recessed room and attempts to continue to \u201cwork.\u201d As the other person begins to take another call, SCP-8011-A-14 abruptly ceases typing for several minutes. It resumes only after the other person stops talking.\n\n\n16:30\n - Afterwards, SCP-8011-A-14 exits the room, only to stop in order to greet one of its imaginary coworkers. As it attempts to converse, the other person in the room is heard also making conversation with an imaginary coworker. During this time, SCP-8011-A-14 completely stops making conversation with its respective coworker, and instead is seen standing still at the doorway. Several minutes later, SCP-8011-A-14 is heard saying \u201cAre you done?\u201d in an angry tone to the other person. When it is met with no reply, SCP-8011-A-14 is seen approaching them and is heard crouching down. It repeats saying \u201cAre you done?\u201d in an angrier tone.\n\n\n16:38\n - The other person is then heard taking another call. SCP-8011-A-14 shouts \n\u201dAre you done?!\u201d\n at it, but is met with no reply. In response, SCP-8011-A-14 is heard screaming loudly with anger before gripping the head of the other person and smashing it against the wall repeatedly. As SCP-8011-A-14 does this, the other person continues to talk in a cordial tone to the imaginary person on the other end of the call that it is taking. Its voice weakens at two minutes later, when SCP-8011-A-14 presumably damages its trachea or vocal cords.\n\n\nThe other person continues to talk until it completely ceases five minutes after the attack commenced, when SCP-8011-A-14 has presumably completely destroyed its skull. Despite this, however, more sounds are heard as SCP-8011-A-14 continues to assault the other person\u2019s body. It ceases three minutes later. SCP-8011-A-14 then begins to cry uncontrollably.\n\n\n16:50\n - SCP-8011-A-14 stands up from the recessed room and walks \u201chome\u201d. More voices are heard on the other side of the microphone, still talking over each other as seen in previous cases. SCP-8011-A-14 mutters \u201cI can do this\u201d over and over as it walks across the room, but is occasionally interrupted by loud noises from the other voices in the area.\n\n\n16:55\n - SCP-8011-A-14 arrives home. It is heard slumping against the wall. It continues to repeat \u201cI can do this\u201d to itself. A few seconds later, SCP-8011-A-14 calls out to \u201cHoney\u201d once again. Upon being met with no reply, SCP-8011-A-14 screams in frustration and anger and is heard punching the wall repeatedly. It is heard shouting \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d again and again.\n\n\n17:00\n - SCP-8011-A-14 runs out of the room and out of the sewers.\n\n\n17:10\n - It exits the borders of the Middlesex Fells reservation and continues to run at full speed in full view through the towns of Winchester, Lexington, and Bedford. At this time, Foundation operatives are dispatched from Site-18 in order to pursue SCP-8011-A-14 and apprehend it once it reaches its target.\n\n\n21:00\n - SCP-8011-A-14 arrives at its destination at a small cabin close to the town of Concord. Foundation operatives are still en route to its location. Upon arriving, SCP-8011-A-14 crashes through the front door of the cabin before quickly turning to enter the dining room. At the time of SCP-8011-A-14's entry into the cabin four non-anomalous individuals were gathered in the dining room for a meal, and exclaimed in surprise at the sudden intrusion. Immediately, SCP-8011-A-14 attacks the individual at the furthest end of the table, a thirty-two year old man named Jonah Marlowe. According to eyewitness accounts, SCP-8011-A-14 directly seized Marlowe by his hair and repeatedly banged his head on the wooden table, shattering the plate directly in front of the victim. As Marlowe falls from his seat, SCP-8011-A-14 blinds him with its fingernails as he lays prone on the floor. It then continues to assault Marlowe by bludgeoning him repeatedly in the face with both arms.\n\n\nTwo other people in the room, including Marlowe\u2019s wife Nicole Tyler-Marlowe and his mother-in-law Mariana Tyler, watch in horror as this transpires. Meanwhile, Marlowe\u2019s father-in-law, Jacob Tyler, exits the room and enters thirty seconds later with a Colt M1911 pistol in his hand. Jacob Tyler fires three shots into SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s abdomen and chest, but is not able to stop the subject from assaulting Marlowe. Soon after, SCP-8011-A-14 bites into Marlowe\u2019s face, first devouring part of his right cheek and following by eating his lips. Jacob Tyler continues to fire his gun at Marlowe, but to no avail. Upon running out of rounds, Jacob Tyler flees the room.\n\n\nUpon fully eating the skin from Marlowe\u2019s face, SCP-8011-A-14 abruptly desists in its hyperaggressive behavior. As described by Nicole Tyler-Marlowe, SCP-8011-A-14 slowly stands up, wipes its bloodied mouth, and smiles at her. SCP-8011-A-14 then steps forward towards Tyler-Marlowe and tenderly says \u201cHey, Honey. I\u2019m home.\u201d\n\n\nAt this point, Foundation operatives arrive at the cabin. As SCP-8011-A-14 moves forward to embrace Tyler-Marlowe, it is quickly apprehended by operatives in full riot gear and armed with batons. SCP-8011-A-14 responds to this with aggression, attempting to bite those restraining it to the nearby table. Quickly, operatives are able to handcuff Marlowe and tie a secure gag to its mouth before carrying it to the Foundation vehicle. Two operatives remain in order to control the situation under the disguise of SWAT team members. Shortly after, Foundation medical staff arrive to administer first aid and provide amnestics. Jonah Marlowe\u2019s death is later concluded to have been the result of a mishandling of acidic chemicals.\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14 arrives at Site-18 four hours later. It is taken to a humanoid containment cell, where it continues to exhibit aggressive behavior towards researchers on the other side of its cell. By 23:45, SCP-8011-A-14 calms and curls up on one side of its cell, and begins to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 12, 2020:\n SCP-8011-A-14 awakens in its cell at 9:12. Unlike its disposition prior, it is smiling and seemingly groggy as it awakens. Carefully, SCP-8011-A-14 rises from its spot as if avoiding waking up an imaginary person next to it. It then rubs its eyes, before moving to stand in front of a table in its cell. SCP-8011-A-14 then grabs an imaginary object from the table and drops his wrist as if pouring a liquid from a pitcher. It then sets down the imaginary object that it was previously holding and starts drinking from an imaginary cup. It sighs with relief.\n\n\nMoving to the other side of the room, it then begins to put on an imaginary apron and pretend to cook. SCP-8011-A-14 continues to perform these movements for several minutes, before arching his arm in order to scrape the cooked food from the imaginary pan onto the plate. It then bends down to sniff it, before moving to the corner where it once slept.\n\n\nIt then begins to speak while smiling, speaking to another person in a tender manner about breakfast in bed. It then begins to converse with this other person while miming eating from a plate, before taking both imaginary plates back in order to pretend to wash them in a sink. As it does so, it continues to converse and laugh occasionally.\n\n\nCrossing the room, SCP-8011-A-14 responds to an unheard request to turn on a television, which it obliges by pretending to retrieve a remote from the table and pressing a button on it. It then sits on the floor in front of the blank wall, while arching his hand out to embrace someone who is not there.\n\n\nAt this time, Head Researcher Ulm arrives to observe and interview SCP-8011-A-14 outside the reinforced glass wall of its containment cell. As SCP-8011-A-14 reclines on the floor, Head Researcher Ulm begins to read out from a pre-prepared list of interview questions. SCP-8011-A-14 does not respond, even when Ulm calls its attention. Due to this, the Head Researcher decides to passively observe the subject outside of the containment cell.\n\n\n11:22\n - SCP-8011-A-14 continues to recline in its seated position, only changing the position of its arms to accommodate the imaginary person beside it. It is heard speaking to the imaginary person multiple times, maintaining a casual and loving demeanor as it does so. Eventually, the topic of SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s conversation switches to an alleged invitation to a family dinner, which SCP-8011-A-14 graciously accepts, before abruptly shaking it head. As it does so, SCP-8011-A-14 attempts to continue the conversation again, but is unable to do so. It puts its head in its hands, and starts to scream in frustration. It attempts to violently punch the wall of its containment cell, enough to break several of its finger bones and cause the carpal bones in its hand to crack audibly. As it does so, Head Researcher Ulm begins to turn on his microphone to speak into the containment cell. Included below is the transcript of the interview.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin log>\n\n\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cHello, Mr. Malkovich? Can you hear me?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 continues to punch the wall and scream in frustration.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cHello? Can you please respond? Desist from punching the wall now.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 gives no reply. It continues to punch the wall.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich, please respond.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 stops and slowly brings its arms down. It bows its head and remains unmoving.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cDo you know where you are, Mr. Malkovich?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 does not respond.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Mal-\u201d\n\n\n[As Ulm speaks, SCP-8011-A-14 turns to the glass wall where Ulm is observing him from and runs at full sprint towards it. Due to the glass\u2019 tempered nature, it bounces off and lands on the floor one meter away.]\n\n\n[In response, SCP-8011-A-14 snarls with aggression, before charging again at the glass and repeatedly banging on it.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cLET ME OUT!\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cSir, if you do not desist-\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cLET ME THE FUCK OUT!\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang on the glass with its hands, before switching to using its head to attempt breaking it.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich, this is reinforced glass. You will not be able to get past it.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang its head on the glass. Rotting skin is seen peeling from its forehead.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!\u201d\n\n\n[Immediately, SCP-8011-A-14 collapses to the ground. It slowly begins to sob.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 remains unresponsive.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich, can you please respond? Do you know where you are?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 begins to hug its knees and cry.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Arnold Malkovich, please res-\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14 [shakily]:\n \u201cNo. No I f-fucking don\u2019t. Is this the hospital? Jail?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou are currently in a holding cell due to two recent incidents which you were involved in.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201c\nIncidents?\n What do you mean? \u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cThe deaths of Anna Bornholm and Jonah Marlowe.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cAnnie\u2019s dead? How?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cWe\u2026 we thought you would like to shed some light on that.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 shakes its head, before slowly standing up. It wipes its tears and grits its teeth.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cListen, Doctor, all I know is that my wife is out there and not two seconds ago was I with her. Now, I\u2019m here. Can you please explain that?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm notes something down on his clipboard.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cSo you remember nothing at all of the incident that transpired last night and one week ago?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cNothing. Can I now please talk to my wife-\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm notes his observation on the clipboard again.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cDoctor? May I now please talk to my wife?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich, you will only be allowed to talk to your wife once we are done with our investigation. In order to do that, you must cooperate?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cDoc, she must be worried sick by now-\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMr. Malkovich, can you please tell us your name?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 stares at Ulm, then closes his eyes and sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cMy name is Arnold Malkovich, Department Head at Augustus Life Incorporated. Listen, if I had my business card, I\u2019d hand it to you.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm glances at his clipboard, then back up at SCP-8011-A-14.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou are a Department Head at Augustus Life Incorporated? Not a team leader?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYes, is there something wrong?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm notes down an observation in his clipboard.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cNo, nothing at all. I believe there may be something wrong with our records. Can you tell me about who your parents were, as well as where you were born?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cI was born in the Massachusetts General Hospital on September 20, 1989. My parents are Judy and Nash Malkovich.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm continues to note on his clipboard.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cEarlier, you were discussing your wife. May I ask who that is?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYou mean, there isn\u2019t anything about her on those records of yours?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cWe just wish to test your orientation to your surroundings.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cFine. My wife\u2019s name is Nicole Tyler-Malkovich, born on October 15, 1989. Does that answer your question?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm visibly stops writing on his clipboard.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm makes another note, then looks at SCP-8011-A-14.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cWhen were you and Mrs. Tyler-Malkovich married?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWe were married\u2026 just recently.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cMay you please give me a date?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cUh\u2026 December 23, 2019. Just before Christmas. She insisted on it.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm nods and writes on his clipboard.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cHow did you know Anna Bornholm?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cAnnie, she\u2026 she was a friend at work, yeah. One of the other team leaders. We eat lunch together at work.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cSo you say she was one of the team leaders?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYeah. I think she was jealous when I got promoted, but she got over it. We\u2019re friends. We talked at work yesterday.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm notes on his clipboard again.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYour work wasn\u2019t affected at all by the pandemic?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 cocks his head.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm looks up with a questioning expression.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYour company hasn\u2019t been affected by lockdowns? Lay-offs? The switch to work from home?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cNo, not at all. We go to work, same as we always have.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm is silent for several seconds, staring at SCP-8011-A-14. He then looks down and notes something down on his clipboard.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor, but\u2026 what the hell are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm continues to write on his clipboard. He does not reply to SCP-8011-A-14.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAlright. Now, how do you know Jonah Marlowe?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cJonah Marlowe, who died last night.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAre you sure about that, Mr. Malkovich?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 looks at Ulm.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cListen, did something bad happen to Annie and this\u2026 Jonah?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cNot particularly, Mr. Malkovich.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cThen why the hell are you keeping me here? Asking these questions from me? Why the \nfuck\n won\u2019t you let me call my wife?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cI am not at liberty to say.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 stands up and bangs on the glass with his palm.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, talk to me straight for once!\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm stares at SCP-8011-A-14 for several seconds. He checks the clipboard, then looks back up at the subject.]\n\n\n[Ulm visibly pauses for several seconds as he looks at SCP-8011-A-14.]\n8\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAlright, Arnold. I will lay the situation out to you.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm moves forward on his seat.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAre you ready for what I am about to tell you?\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cA week ago, Anna Bornholm was murdered by a man who had broken into the Kanzler building. This man knew where the floor which Augustus Life Incorporated was occupying, and also knew the approximate area where Anna Bornholm would be.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cNo, \nlisten to me\n. Once he saw her, the man violently burst through the window of the meeting room and attacked Bornholm, repeatedly slamming her head against the wall until she was dead. Then, this man, seized by some violent hysteria, ate three fingers from her hand.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cDoctor, what are you saying-\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cNext: last night, another murder occurred outside of Concord. This time, a man named Jonah Marlowe was eating dinner with his wife and in-laws. Then, at 8:22 PM in the evening, a man broke into the house which they were eating at and immediately pounced on Marlowe, physically assaulting him to such a degree that he was half-dead. Then, not satisfied, the man then bit pieces out of Marlowe\u2019s face. He did this so violently, in fact, that parts of the victim\u2019s skull were exposed by the time he expired. \nDoes that sound familiar?\n\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cThen, with no compulsion for guilt whatsoever, the man then stood up, straightened his tattered suit, wiped the blood from his face, and smiled to Marlowe\u2019s newlywed wife, Nicole Tyler-Marlowe.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 has a clear expression of shock on its face. It does not immediately offer a reply.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201c\u2026What the fuck are you saying?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cDo you know the reason why you\u2019re here, Arnold?\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm smiles ungenuinely at SCP-8011-A-14.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re the one who committed these murders. That\u2019s why we took you in. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm clicks the pen in his hand.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying.\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou died on November 23, 2019. You never married Nicole Tyler. You were never promoted to department head. Other people did that in your place.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm clicks the pen in his hand again.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cAnd now you killed Jonah and Annie, just so that you could pretend to be what they are\u2026 that you never were. You\u2019re living a lie, Arnold. Wake up.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYOU\u2019RE FUCKING LYING!\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYOU\u2019RE LYING!\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass again, eliciting loud cracks from its right hand.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cGET ME OUT OF HERE, YOU LYING SON OF A BITCH!\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass repeatedly with both of his hands, causing multiple fractures across the phalanx bones and carpals. SCP-8011-A-14 does not notice them.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cFUCK YOU! YOU\u2019RE LYING! FUCK YOU!\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 stops punching the glass. Tears are streaming down both of its cheeks.]\n\n[After a few seconds, SCP-8011-A-14 falls to the ground and hugs its knees to its chest. It starts to rock itself back and forth. It begins to cry loudly, followed by whimpering.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying. You\u2019re lying. \nYou\u2019re lying.\n\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm stands in front of SCP-8011-A-14, his arms folded across his chest.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t even feel it, did you?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 sniffles.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYour hands.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201c\nWhat about my hands?\n\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cThey\u2019re broken to hell. Look at them.\u201d\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cWhy the hell would I?\u201d\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou have nothing to lose by looking at your hands, SCP-8011-A-14. Look at them.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s face twitches.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cGo on. Look at them.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 brings its hands up to look at them. Its eyes widen in horror.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou\u2019re \ndead\n, Arnold. You can\u2019t feel a thing. Look at your suit. Look at your skin. You\u2019re \nrotting.\n\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 moans in horror. It stumbles back as it continues to look at its hands.]\n\n\nSCP-8011-A-14:\n \u201cNo\u2026 no no no no no\u2026\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 starts whimpering. It attempts to grip the table near him for balance as it continues to step back, but its broken hand is unable to support its weight. It falls to the ground.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou were never promoted. You never married Nicole Tyler. Instead, on November 23rd, 2019, you died in a car accident\u2013 scared, alone, and slowly bleeding out.\u201d\n\n\n[Ulm stands up from his chair.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cYou\u2019re \ndead,\n Arnold. Accept it.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 screams in anguish while on the floor. It continues to do this for forty seconds.]\n\n\n[Afterwards, SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s anguished screams decrease to low, repeating whimpers.]\n\n\n[Ulm watches expectantly at SCP-8011-A-14.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cArnold? Are you still there?\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 lies in a ball on the floor, motionless.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cArno-\u201d\n\n\n[Suddenly, SCP-8011-A-14 launches itself at the glass wall in a hyper-aggressive state, repeatedly banging its head against the glass. It starts screaming in extreme rage, before pummelling the glass wall with what is left of its hands. Its right hand is seen falling from its forearm.]\n\n\n[Ulm smiles in fascination.]\n\n\nUlm:\n \u201cI\u2019ll take note of this.\u201d\n\n\n[SCP-8011-A-14 screams louder in response, before banging its head against the glass wall again.]\n\n\n[Ulm begins to animatedly write in his clipboard. He turns away as SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang against the glass wall in rage.]\n\n\n<end log>\n\n\n\n\nWhen later questioned as to his unprofessional conduct during his interview with SCP-8011-A-14, Head Reseacher Ulm stated that it was done in order to discern if breaking SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s constructed reality would cause it to revert to a hyperaggressive state. According to Head Researcher Ulm, SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s reaction was able to adequately fulfill his aims.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8011.3:\n Following the capture of SCP-8011-A-14, an initiative was undertaken in Site-18 in order to capture SCP-8011-A specimens before they assumed or reassumed their hyperaggressive states in order to further study them. The first target for this initiative was the burrow situated in the sewers under the Middlesex Fells Reservation. Twenty-five SCP-8011-A specimens were captured in the first operation. Due to safety protocols and the initially docile states of the specimens upon first encounter, no personnel were injured in the operation. Upon arrival at Site-18, specimens were identified through local records. Below is a list of selected subjects from this operation, followed by relevant details.\n\n\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Rodrigo Perez, classified as SCP-8011-A-15\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8011-A-15 used to work as a bank teller before expiring on November 23, 2019. After its presumed resurrection event on November 5, 2020, SCP-8011-A-15 stalked one of its clients, a wealthy thirty-seven year old woman called Janice Salisbury. Upon attacking Salisbury, SCP-8011-A-15 bit into and devoured her neck, killing her almost instantly. Upon arrival to the Middlesex Fells Reservation burrow, SCP-8011-A-15 began pretending to be of affluent status.\n\n\nWhen later selected for interview during its lucid state, SCP-8011-A-15 was stated as saying that it was \u201cheading to Kobe\u2019s game.\u201d After being further asked as to who it was describing, SCP-8011-A-15 elaborated that it was \u201cgoing to be his best game yet.\u201d When further inquired about how Kobe Bryant would play a game amidst pandemic restrictions and his expiration earlier in 2020, SCP-8011-A-15 expressed visible puzzlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Julius Shane, classified as SCP-8011-A-19\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8011-A-19 used to be a student at Middlesex School near the town of Concord before expiring due to an allergic reaction suffered while playing videogames at the house of Nathan Casa, a classmate of SCP-8011-A-19. After resurrection, SCP-8011-A-19 attacked its classmate, eating both of his thumbs as well as his left index and middle fingers. Upon arrival to the Middlesex Fells Reservation burrow, SCP-8011-A-19 was observed pretending to play videogames via a controller.\n\n\nAfter being interviewed on the video games that it played, SCP-8011-A-19 stated that \u201cFortnite crashed and burned, but Overwatch just got a new big overhaul, so me and my friends are playing that!\u201d\n9\n. When asked further about its interest in Overwatch, SCP-8011-A-19 mentioned that \u201cthe sequel was cancelled a while back so that they could focus on Overwatch 1. I was bummed about that, the PVE looked so good.\u201d\n10\n After researchers acquired further as to its relationship to Nathan Casa, SCP-8011-A-19 stated that it was best friends with Casa, and states that they \u201chit it off\u201d after winter break around January 2020, with the two of them playing Overwatch together until the present. Upon further cross-referencing with sources close to SCP-8011-A-19 and Nathan Casa, it has been determined that neither party had interacted with each other prior to SCP-8011-A-19\u2019s death in November 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture of SCP-8011-A-28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Name of SCP-8011-A Instance:\n Claudine Colt-Barrella, classified as SCP-8011-A-28\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8011-A-28 used to be a housekeeper before expiring on November 23, 2019 due to unspecified causes. Upon resurrection, SCP-8011-A-28 attacked its employer Angelina Magalang, killing her with a kitchen knife before eating her right shoulder and feet. Upon arrival to the Middlesex Fells Reservation burrow, SCP-8011-A-28 was observed to walk from room to room in the sewers while pretending to wear high heels and holding a handbag over her shoulder.\n\n\nWhen interviewed in containment, SCP-8011-A-28 stated that it was \u201cgoing to the mall everyday\u201d, and that doing so tired it due to \u201call the money\u201d it felt it \u201chad to spend\u201d. When inquired as to how it got the money for shopping, SCP-8011-A-28 stated that it got it all from her husband, before correcting the interviewing researcher when she referred to it as \u201cMrs. Colt-Barella\u201d. Instead, SCP-8011-A-28 wished to be considered as \u201cMrs. Magalang\u201d. When asked as to what its husband did for a living, SCP-8011-A-28 stated that its husband worked as a stock manager. When the researcher further inquired as to how the husband could have made money after the pandemic-caused stock market recession in early 2020, SCP-8011-A-28 said that \u201cthere was never a recession\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nAfter this initial success, Foundation authorities in Site-18 launched several more operations in located burrows within the state of Massachusetts. By the end of these successive operations, a total of 120 instances were contained in the humanoid containment wing of Site-18. However, due to concerns with overcrowding, a provision was made to expand the approved capacity of each 7 square meter humanoid containment cell. This raised the number of SCP-8011-A instances in a given cell to 9. It was at this point that the SCP-8011 research team at Site-18 began noting small hume decreases in the cells where SCP-8011-A instances were contained, as well as a wider decrease in the humanoid containment wing of Site-18. These, however, were deemed too negligible in order to warrant a definitive action.\n\n\nA few days later, on January 4, 2021, reports began emerging from the town of Arellano, Florida of an alleged \u201cmass hysteria\u201d incident resulting in at least 60 fatalities. Suspecting a potential SCP-8011-A attack, Foundation authorities tasked Site-18 staff with addressing the situation. Upon arrival at the town of Arellano, Florida\n11\n, operatives reported that casualty rates were higher than first assumed. 90 fatalities were determined to have been suffered by the town following the attack, with all victims having had their throats and feet completely eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture of the town of Ni\u00f1o, Florida, in the aftermath of Hurricane Dylan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy interviewing the locals, the operatives were able to discern that all of the culprits had come from and had went in the direction of the destroyed town of Ni\u00f1o\n12\n. This caused the operatives to travel to the site, whereupon they encountered 112 SCP-8011-A instances celebrating together by dancing and singing.\n13\n. Faint music was also described being heard played at the site, but was dismissed as auditory hallucinations. Following this, all SCP-8011-A instances were apprehended without incident.\n\n\nThe common point of origin for the SCP-8011-A instances was determined to be a nearby cemetery, which had been the site of rushed burials following the deaths of 112 persons in Ni\u00f1o during Hurricane Dylan. This disaster then prompted the town to be abandoned. Later research into the town\u2019s history revealed that its patron saint was Saint Elizabeth Seton, whose feast day was on January 4th.\n\n\nFollowing the incident, all instances were brought to Site-18. This brought the total number of contained SCP-8011 instances to 232. Due to the high amount of SCP-8011-A instances in the humanoid containment wing, however, the area\u2019s hume level began to decrease by a noticeable level. Due to this, personnel began reporting hearing faint \nfiesta\n music being played in the humanoid containment wing, which matched the dances that the newly contained SCP-8011 instances were conducting. Likewise, objects related to the delusions of other SCP-8011 instances began manifesting. This included a handbag fastened around the shoulder of SCP-8011-A-28 and a video game controller in the right hand of SCP-8011-A-19, as well as musical instruments in the containment cells of instances originating from Ni\u00f1o.\n\n\nThis incident prompted the placement of a Scranton reality anchor in the humanoid containment wing, which only worsened the reality bending effects through a previously theoretical Pull Event.\n14\n Because of this, fiesta decorations and musical instruments began manifesting in the humanoid containment wing in the first few seconds of the incident, with the earlier reported music getting progressively louder. Due to the closely-packed nature of the SCP-8011-A instances, some of the manifested objects came into existence in the same space as other contained subjects. This, incidentally, had no consequence on their body functions or the performance of their delusions. Of more concern, however, were the objects manifesting through the walls of the containment cells, which compromised the structural integrity of the cells.\n\n\nShortly after, it was realized that the Pull Event\u2019s manifesting objects were caused by the increased number in SCP-8011-A instances in the humanoid containment wing as well as the presence of the Reality Anchor. As such, Head Researcher Ulm mandated site security staff to temporarily relocate half of all contained instances to other containment wings, with the instances originating from the town of Ni\u00f1o being particularly separated from one another. The Scranton Reality Anchor was also removed from the wing, which lessened the intensity of the reality bending effects. The emergency caused by the Pull Event was then declared ended several hours later.\n\n\nDue to this occurrence, Head Researcher Ulm and his team began investigating the nature of the SCP-8011-A instances\u2019 reality bending capacity in relation to the delusions that they are experiencing. It was then realized that the SCP-8011-A instances\u2019 reality bending capacity was caused by their capability to reach into another universe while commencing their delusions, and that the likely cause for their delusions originates from within this aforementioned universe\n15\n. In line with this, a proposal for an experiment with a prototype machine was created in order to determine the universe that they were interacting with.\n\n\nAn excerpt of the proposal is included below.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026in order to determine the universes that SCP-8011-A interact with while under their delusions, this team requests that the following actions be performed:\n\n\n\n\nThe procurement of necessary materials and personnel as stipulated below\n\n\nThe construction of a large reality-bending-resistant containment matrix, along with the installation of a standard Foundation supercomputer in accordance with the specifications enumerated below\n\n\nThe procurement of the heads of 150 SCP-8011-A instances who are currently experiencing delusions\n\n\nThe connection of the heads to the supercomputer via telepathic wires\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026)\n\n\nAfter construction, the machine will then commence a 2 minute start-up procedure. Electricity consumption is determined to increase markedly to .10 gigawatts\n16\n. The humes within the containment matrix are also expected to dramatically plummet to an expected 5 to 10 humes, with items being expected to be manifested within the containment matrix. This, however, will not affect the outside environment, with the heads of the SCP-8011-A instances inside being protected by internal protective safeguards.\n\n\nOnce the start-up procedure is performed, the supercomputer will then calculate the identity of the universe which the instance selected by the user is interacting with. For reference, our home universe has been designated the number \u201c000-000-000\u201d, with neighboring universes being classified according to their relative distance from our universe.\n\n\n(\u2026)\n\n\nBy performing these actions, this team hypothesizes that they will be able to discern the specific universe that SCP-8011-A instances connect to in their capacity as Pull Agents. Through this, this team aims to further understand the SCP-8011 phenomenon, as well as the implications that the SCP-8011-A\u2019s reality-bending properties have on the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a short deliberation with the Ethics Committee\n17\n, the proposal was approved by the Site-18 Research Board.\n\n\nThe experiment was then conducted on January 27, 2021. An eyewitness account, as recorded by Junior Researcher Irmgard Marlowitz, is included below.\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026) Then, suddenly, Doctor Ulm declared \u201clights out\u201d, causing the room to be put in complete darkness. The only things I could see in front of me were the battery-powered lanterns all around, lighting the machine up but nothing else. You could feel that\u2026 even in the darkness, everyone was dead fucking nervous.\n\n\nAs the lights went off, Doctor Whent immediately went to work on the panel. As she fiddled with the knobs and whistles on the console, I saw her make the go signal to Doctor Ulm, who was standing right next to the big box where they kept all the heads in.\n\n\nYou know\u2026 it was kinda strange, honestly. Doctor Ulm seemed to be distracted, listening in to the box. The heads were silent, of course. Whent explained to me the day before that the -As no longer had lungs or vocal cords to speak with. But Ulm\u2026 Doctor Ulm seemed to be listening in nonetheless. Then I saw his ears perk up as he saw Whent\u2019s signal. He was ready.\n\n\nI saw Ulm nod, and then Whent flipped a switch. The machine started humming\u2026 first this low droning buzz, like a bee. Then, it started getting louder, and I realized it was coming from the computer. Outside, where the lights were on, I heard the power flicker in and out. It was expected, though. Ulm and his team got us oriented on that before we started. We were just here to watch and wait in case things went wrong.\n\n\nAfter a while, the room began to light up a bit more. It was\u2026 ethereal. A bright kind of light\u2026 I don\u2019t really know how to describe it. It was as if the wires, the big wires that connected the box to the computer were glowing. There was nothing inside the wires, no big chemicals going through it but\u2026 at the same time, it felt like something actually was.\n\n\nThen the computer powered on. It was this big screen that dominated the room. First it was dark blue- nothing on it. Then suddenly, it started to turn on properly, flashing on and off as letters quickly went in and out on the screen. The buzzing kept getting louder. It was like one of those old computers my dad had from the 80s, screaming like it was getting murdered electronically.\n\n\nThe flashing and the buzzing continued for what felt like twenty minutes. Whent, Ulm, Doctor Marlon and the others were just staring up at it, waiting for it to come on. The other officers were looking up too, watching and waiting. Watching\u2026 and waiting.\n\n\nWhent then started calling out numbers. \u201c70 percent\u2026\u201d she said. \u201c80 percent\u2026 90\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThen, once we reached the home stretch, we heard something coming from the box.\n\n\nThe -As\u2026 they were \ntalking\n. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible, but we heard it. They were talking loudly, shouting things like \u201cViva el Cristo Rey!\u201d, \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d. I looked at Jan, the site security officer standing right next to me, and she was just as surprised as I was. The heads weren\u2019t talking when the team put them in a few days ago. How the hell were they talking now?\n\n\nUlm seemed to be giddy now, not shocked like we were. It was like he knew what was coming. Whent was concentrated on the numbers on screen, so I\u2019m not sure she even heard it. The other scientists were just waiting and watching, with some staring so intensely at the screen it was like their lives depended on it.\n\n\n\u201c96,\u201d Whent said. \u201c97\u2026\u201d\n\n\nIt was then we heard the -As \nscream\n- scream so loudly that it pierced through our eardrums. The screams echoed through the walls of the experiment room, bounced up and down the floors, into our heads\u2026 it was like their souls were getting \nripped\n right out of them.\n\n\nWhent was staring at the screen. She never noticed. She kept counting. \u201c98\u2026 99\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThen we heard the buzzing go its loudest, echoing through the room along with the screams. It was this gigantic cacophony, almost\u2026 screams and electric screams all mixing in our heads.\n\n\nThen Whent finished it: \u201c100.\u201d\n\n\nIn the space of a single second, everything went quiet.\n\n\nAll we heard was the hum of the computer and all we saw was the glow of the lanterns and the screens.\n\n\nI looked at Ulm. His smile was wide with delight. He was enjoying this.\n\n\nHe crossed the room, to Whent, and then patted her back. Said something to her along the lines of \u201ccongratulations\u201d. Then, he turned to the us, his team, and declared: \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\n\nNo one responded. They were too busy watching the screen. The screen with nothing but a flashing blank on it, waiting for orders.\n\n\nUlm turned around to type something on the keyboard. \u201cStart query\u201d, the screen said, as he typed it out.\n\n\nHe pressed enter. The screen replied: \u201cSelect instance.\u201d\n\n\nUlm answered with \u201cInstance 1.\u201d Then he pressed enter again. The computer screen went black. We heard its gears whirring. It sounded like it was calculating things, trying to give us an answer.\n\n\nEarlier on, Doctor Marlon gave us a run down of what the numbers meant. \u201cAll zeroes for us,\u201d Doctor Marlon said. \u201c000-000-000. Then it\u2019s 111-111-111 for Alagadda, 222-222-222 for the Library, 333-333-333 for the Daeva.\u201d Marlon was holding a big, really old catalog at the time that he was talking, full of big numbers implying big universes. It dated back to the 70s, and we were only just pulling it out now.\n\n\nMarlon was holding that book then, looking at Ulm and Whent and the console from his seat. He was holding it tightly to his body, like he was waiting for a sign to open it and start looking through.\n\n\nThen the computer went back on\u2026 and we all saw it.\n\n\n\u201c000-000-000.\u201d That\u2019s what the computer said. All zeroes.\n\n\nEveryone stared at the screen.\n\n\nWhat felt like an hour passed.\n\n\nThen Doctor Marlon jumped to his feet, carrying the book, running to Ulm and Whent at the console.\n\n\nThey started talking. Quietly. But angrily. Ulm was looking at Whent, asking if she got the connections right. Whent was trying to defend herself, saying everything was right, and had been double-checked, triple-checked, quadruple-checked. Marlon was cutting in, trying to say that maybe it was a bug, or a fluke, and that if they tried again they\u2019d see where the -As were coming from.\n\n\nUlm looked at Marlon, then nodded. He looked at the console again, told Whent to type. Whent started typing.\n\n\nThe screen flickered out. The buzzing started again.\n\n\nThen that same number came out. \u201c000-000-000.\u201d All zeroes.\n\n\nWhent tried again, another -A.\n\n\nThe screen flashed, the buzzing came and went.\n\n\nAll zeroes.\n\n\nShe did it again.\n\n\nAll zeroes.\n\n\nUlm ran behind the screen to check the connections. See if everything was alright. Nothing. He looked at the box, checked it for damage. Nothing. He looped back to Marlon and Whent, checked the console.\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\nThe computer was right.\n\n\nThe researchers started buzzing amongst themselves, talking, whispering. They looked at the computer and back again, while Ulm and Whent tried more and more and more -As.\n\n\nEarlier on, a theory was floating around the team- something that Ulm refused to acknowledge but something that we were talking about nonetheless.\n\n\nWe all knew from the interviews that the -As were consistent. They were all drawing from the same source. If ever we got a number from the machine, they should have been the same number, or the same group of very close numbers.\n\n\nThen, one time, Doctor Marlon joked \u201cIf it was zero, that\u2019d be fucking bullshit.\u201d Then Whent asked \u201cWhy would it be bullshit?\u201d\n\n\nMarlon then went on to say that if it was zero, it meant that the -As were imagining being in our universe- but that couldn\u2019t be true, since what they were experiencing was so different from ours. Much less scary, even if it were still the fucked-up world we all remember. A more mundane hellhole\u2026 a more \nnormal\n kind of bad. In the world of the -As, after November 2019, different things happened. There was no COVID, no economic recessions, no crises, no wildfires, no hurricanes like Dylan and Ainah. \u201cErgo,\u201d Marlon said, \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. All zeroes is impossible.\u201d\n\n\nThen Whent piped up. \u201cWhat if it weren\u2019t bullshit? What if the zeroes meant that the -As were dreaming of the world as it \nshould\n be, and that we wandered off the path somewhere?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo date, we\u2019ve busted 300 burrows. 8,000 dead ones across sites from around the world, with hundreds of thousands more thought to be under the ground, trying to get out. But we\u2019ve never gotten anything before November 23, 2019.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we get all zeroes, what if the lives that they\u2019re living in their heads are what we\u2019re supposed to be living right now? What if the reason that they\u2019re coming back is because they aren\u2019t supposed to be dead\u2026 but because things changed, they are now?\u201d\n\n\nMarlon had no response to that. Just chuckled and said \u201cIt\u2019s a wild guess, for sure.\u201d\n\n\nBack then, I looked at the senior researchers, and I had no idea what they meant.\n\n\nI know it now.\n\n\nWhent was right.\n\n\nThe -As had the script we were supposed to be quoting from, and they were quoting from it successfully. Them eating people- it\u2019s all a means of getting back the lives that they were \nsupposed\n to be living.\n\n\nThe shit that we all went through since 2020\u2026 the pandemic, the storms, the fires\u2026 it was because \nwe\n were the ones that were off-track.\n\n\nWe\n were the ones that were off-script.\n\n\nAnd the dead\u2013 in all of their thousands, tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands\n- are the ones trying to hurt us to get back on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. For example, the first SCP-8011 resurrection event, which affected corpses who had expired on November 23, 2019, was estimated to have occurred on November 25, 2020.\n\n\n2\n. In some cases, SCP-8011-A instances have been known to target a victim\u2019s mouth, neck, legs, feet, or genitalia.\n\n\n3\n. SCP-8011-A instances have been observed to use blunt objects and knives while killing a victim. In a few cases, SCP-8011-A instances have been observed to force entry into residences and buildings through brute force or the use of keys.\n\n\n4\n. To date, only the use of immolation through fire can totally destroy an SCP-8011-A instance. Methods involved in damaging an instance\u2019s brain have been ineffective at neutralizing it. Decapitation has only been successful at negating an instance\u2019s capabilities, with the head still continuing to operate in the absence of the body.\n\n\n5\n. The measure of reality in a given area\n\n\n6\n. Individually, SCP-8011-A instances have shown to pose no notable reality bending properties. The reason for this property has not yet been definitively proven.\n\n\n7\n. This coincides with a case of another likely SCP-8011-A attack in the nearby town of Manchester-by-the-Sea, where a retired 911 dispatcher was killed and had her face torn off by her attacker.\n\n\n8\n. From this point, Head Research Ulm deviates from the questions prepared beforehand.\n\n\n9\n. As of the time of writing on June 20, 2021, the videogame Overwatch has not yet received an update since June 16, 2020.\n\n\n10\n. As of the time of writing, Overwatch 2 has not yet been cancelled.\n\n\n11\n. A site infamous for narrowly avoiding being destroyed following Hurricane Dylan in 2020\n\n\n12\n. A town destroyed in 2020 following Hurricane Dylan\n\n\n13\n. This marks the first time that SCP-8011-A instances were recorded to be able to interact with each other.\n\n\n14\n. First proposed by Anna Lang in 1995, the condition for a Pull Event first occurs when an agent (hereafter referred to as Pull Agent) weakens the boundary of their universe by pulling from another nearby universe, lowering the hume count of the surrounding area. If this Pull Agent comes into close contact with other Pull Agents, they can compound to progressively weaken the boundary of their universe and allow objects from one universe to manifest into another.\n\nAs a Scranton Reality Anchor performs its primary hume-increasing effect by pulling humes from other universes, it can be termed as a powerful Pull Agent.\n\n\n\n\n15\n. With these delusions being from the fact that SCP-8011-A instances are living in this universe themselves.\n\n\n16\n. For reference, 1 gigawatt is equal to 1 billion watts.\n\n\n17\n. When asked as to whether the proposed decapitation of SCP-8011-A instances was necessary, Head Researcher Ulm stated that it was in order to allow for a smaller reality-bending resistant matrix to be constructed, as well as acting as a precautionary measure in case any of the SCP-8011-A instances reassumed a hyper-aggressive state. When later asked whether the decapitations were humane, Head Researcher Ulm replied that SCP-8011-A instances have been shown to be incapable of feeling physical pain, with any emotional distress from the decapitations being nullified by their current delusional state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\nImage created by AnAnomalousWriter\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8010\n | SCP-8011| \nSCP-8012\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8011\n\" by Ecronak, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Addendum 8011.1: Based on extrapolation from later events, the first resurrection event occurred on November 25, 2020. The first cases of murders reasonably thought to have been due to attacks by SCP-8011-A instances, however, occurred as late as November 31, 2020. This has been thought to have been due to the time that SCP-8011-A instances would have spent emerging from their burial places, with instances that had been shallowly buried or had been buried with coffins made out of fragile materials (such as wood) emerging first. Likewise, any case of early killings by SCP-8011-A instances in developing countries could have been underreported, further adding uncertainty to the possible first case of an SCP-8011-A attack.\nBelow is a list of selected cases of the first SCP-8011-A attacks, along with relevant details about the persons involved.",
        "Addendum 8011.2: The following addendum describes the observations and subsequent interviews conducted on SCP-8011-A-14 following its tracker implantation on December 6, 2020.",
        "Addendum 8011.3: Following the capture of SCP-8011-A-14, an initiative was undertaken in Site-18 in order to capture SCP-8011-A specimens before they assumed or reassumed their hyperaggressive states in order to further study them. The first target for this initiative was the burrow situated in the sewers under the Middlesex Fells Reservation. Twenty-five SCP-8011-A specimens were captured in the first operation. Due to safety protocols and the initially docile states of the specimens upon first encounter, no personnel were injured in the operation. Upon arrival at Site-18, specimens were identified through local records. Below is a list of selected subjects from this operation, followed by relevant details.\nAfter this initial success, Foundation authorities in Site-18 launched several more operations in located burrows within the state of Massachusetts. By the end of these successive operations, a total of 120 instances were contained in the humanoid containment wing of Site-18. However, due to concerns with overcrowding, a provision was made to expand the approved capacity of each 7 square meter humanoid containment cell. This raised the number of SCP-8011-A instances in a given cell to 9. It was at this point that the SCP-8011 research team at Site-18 began noting small hume decreases in the cells where SCP-8011-A instances were contained, as well as a wider decrease in the humanoid containment wing of Site-18. These, however, were deemed too negligible in order to warrant a definitive action.\nA few days later, on January 4, 2021, reports began emerging from the town of Arellano, Florida of an alleged \u201cmass hysteria\u201d incident resulting in at least 60 fatalities. Suspecting a potential SCP-8011-A attack, Foundation authorities tasked Site-18 staff with addressing the situation. Upon arrival at the town of Arellano, Florida 11 , operatives reported that casualty rates were higher than first assumed. 90 fatalities were determined to have been suffered by the town following the attack, with all victims having had their throats and feet completely eaten.\nBy interviewing the locals, the operatives were able to discern that all of the culprits had come from and had went in the direction of the destroyed town of Ni\u00f1o 12 . This caused the operatives to travel to the site, whereupon they encountered 112 SCP-8011-A instances celebrating together by dancing and singing. 13 . Faint music was also described being heard played at the site, but was dismissed as auditory hallucinations. Following this, all SCP-8011-A instances were apprehended without incident.\nThe common point of origin for the SCP-8011-A instances was determined to be a nearby cemetery, which had been the site of rushed burials following the deaths of 112 persons in Ni\u00f1o during Hurricane Dylan. This disaster then prompted the town to be abandoned. Later research into the town\u2019s history revealed that its patron saint was Saint Elizabeth Seton, whose feast day was on January 4th.\nFollowing the incident, all instances were brought to Site-18. This brought the total number of contained SCP-8011 instances to 232. Due to the high amount of SCP-8011-A instances in the humanoid containment wing, however, the area\u2019s hume level began to decrease by a noticeable level. Due to this, personnel began reporting hearing faint fiesta music being played in the humanoid containment wing, which matched the dances that the newly contained SCP-8011 instances were conducting. Likewise, objects related to the delusions of other SCP-8011 instances began manifesting. This included a handbag fastened around the shoulder of SCP-8011-A-28 and a video game controller in the right hand of SCP-8011-A-19, as well as musical instruments in the containment cells of instances originating from Ni\u00f1o.\nThis incident prompted the placement of a Scranton reality anchor in the humanoid containment wing, which only worsened the reality bending effects through a previously theoretical Pull Event. 14 Because of this, fiesta decorations and musical instruments began manifesting in the humanoid containment wing in the first few seconds of the incident, with the earlier reported music getting progressively louder. Due to the closely-packed nature of the SCP-8011-A instances, some of the manifested objects came into existence in the same space as other contained subjects. This, incidentally, had no consequence on their body functions or the performance of their delusions. Of more concern, however, were the objects manifesting through the walls of the containment cells, which compromised the structural integrity of the cells.\nShortly after, it was realized that the Pull Event\u2019s manifesting objects were caused by the increased number in SCP-8011-A instances in the humanoid containment wing as well as the presence of the Reality Anchor. As such, Head Researcher Ulm mandated site security staff to temporarily relocate half of all contained instances to other containment wings, with the instances originating from the town of Ni\u00f1o being particularly separated from one another. The Scranton Reality Anchor was also removed from the wing, which lessened the intensity of the reality bending effects. The emergency caused by the Pull Event was then declared ended several hours later.\nDue to this occurrence, Head Researcher Ulm and his team began investigating the nature of the SCP-8011-A instances\u2019 reality bending capacity in relation to the delusions that they are experiencing. It was then realized that the SCP-8011-A instances\u2019 reality bending capacity was caused by their capability to reach into another universe while commencing their delusions, and that the likely cause for their delusions originates from within this aforementioned universe 15 . In line with this, a proposal for an experiment with a prototype machine was created in order to determine the universe that they were interacting with.\nAn excerpt of the proposal is included below.\nFollowing a short deliberation with the Ethics Committee 17 , the proposal was approved by the Site-18 Research Board.\nThe experiment was then conducted on January 27, 2021. An eyewitness account, as recorded by Junior Researcher Irmgard Marlowitz, is included below."

Desist from punching the wall now.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 gives no reply. It continues to punch the wall.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich, please respond.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 stops and slowly brings its arms down. It bows its head and remains unmoving.] Ulm: \u201cDo you know where you are, Mr. Malkovich?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 does not respond.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Mal-\u201d [As Ulm speaks, SCP-8011-A-14 turns to the glass wall where Ulm is observing him from and runs at full sprint towards it. Due to the glass\u2019 tempered nature, it bounces off and lands on the floor one meter away.] [In response, SCP-8011-A-14 snarls with aggression, before charging again at the glass and repeatedly banging on it.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cLET ME OUT!\u201d Ulm: \u201cSir, if you do not desist-\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cLET ME THE FUCK OUT!\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang on the glass with its hands, before switching to using its head to attempt breaking it.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich, this is reinforced glass. You will not be able to get past it.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang its head on the glass. Rotting skin is seen peeling from its forehead.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!\u201d [Immediately, SCP-8011-A-14 collapses to the ground. It slowly begins to sob.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 remains unresponsive.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich, can you please respond? Do you know where you are?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 begins to hug its knees and cry.] Ulm: \u201cMr. Arnold Malkovich, please res-\u201d SCP-8011-A-14 [shakily]: \u201cNo. No I f-fucking don\u2019t. Is this the hospital? Jail?\u201d Ulm: \u201cYou are currently in a holding cell due to two recent incidents which you were involved in.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201c Incidents? What do you mean? \u201d Ulm: \u201cThe deaths of Anna Bornholm and Jonah Marlowe.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cAnnie\u2019s dead? How?\u201d Ulm: \u201cWe\u2026 we thought you would like to shed some light on that.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 shakes its head, before slowly standing up. It wipes its tears and grits its teeth.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cListen, Doctor, all I know is that my wife is out there and not two seconds ago was I with her. Now, I\u2019m here. Can you please explain that?\u201d [Ulm notes something down on his clipboard.] Ulm: \u201cSo you remember nothing at all of the incident that transpired last night and one week ago?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cNothing. Can I now please talk to my wife-\u201d Ulm: \u201cI see.\u201d [Ulm notes his observation on the clipboard again.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cDoctor? May I now please talk to my wife?\u201d Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich, you will only be allowed to talk to your wife once we are done with our investigation. In order to do that, you must cooperate?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cDoc, she must be worried sick by now-\u201d Ulm: \u201cMr. Malkovich, can you please tell us your name?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 stares at Ulm, then closes his eyes and sighs.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cMy name is Arnold Malkovich, Department Head at Augustus Life Incorporated. Listen, if I had my business card, I\u2019d hand it to you.\u201d [Ulm glances at his clipboard, then back up at SCP-8011-A-14.] Ulm: \u201cYou are a Department Head at Augustus Life Incorporated? Not a team leader?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYes, is there something wrong?\u201d [Ulm notes down an observation in his clipboard.] Ulm: \u201cNo, nothing at all. I believe there may be something wrong with our records. Can you tell me about who your parents were, as well as where you were born?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cI was born in the Massachusetts General Hospital on September 20, 1989. My parents are Judy and Nash Malkovich.\u201d [Ulm continues to note on his clipboard.] Ulm: \u201cEarlier, you were discussing your wife. May I ask who that is?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYou mean, there isn\u2019t anything about her on those records of yours?\u201d Ulm: \u201cWe just wish to test your orientation to your surroundings.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cFine. My wife\u2019s name is Nicole Tyler-Malkovich, born on October 15, 1989. Does that answer your question?\u201d [Ulm visibly stops writing on his clipboard.] Ulm: \u201cUnderstood.\u201d [Ulm makes another note, then looks at SCP-8011-A-14.] Ulm: \u201cWhen were you and Mrs. Tyler-Malkovich married?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWe were married\u2026 just recently.\u201d Ulm: \u201cMay you please give me a date?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cUh\u2026 December 23, 2019. Just before Christmas. She insisted on it.\u201d [Ulm nods and writes on his clipboard.] Ulm: \u201cHow did you know Anna Bornholm?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cAnnie, she\u2026 she was a friend at work, yeah. One of the other team leaders. We eat lunch together at work.\u201d Ulm: \u201cSo you say she was one of the team leaders?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYeah. I think she was jealous when I got promoted, but she got over it. We\u2019re friends. We talked at work yesterday.\u201d Ulm: \u201cAlright.\u201d [Ulm notes on his clipboard again.] Ulm: \u201cYour work wasn\u2019t affected at all by the pandemic?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 cocks his head.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cThe what?\u201d [Ulm looks up with a questioning expression.] Ulm: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d Ulm: \u201cYour company hasn\u2019t been affected by lockdowns? Lay-offs? The switch to work from home?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cNo, not at all. We go to work, same as we always have.\u201d [Ulm is silent for several seconds, staring at SCP-8011-A-14. He then looks down and notes something down on his clipboard.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor, but\u2026 what the hell are you talking about?\u201d [Ulm continues to write on his clipboard. He does not reply to SCP-8011-A-14.] Ulm: \u201cAlright. Now, how do you know Jonah Marlowe?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWho?\u201d Ulm: \u201cJonah Marlowe, who died last night.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d Ulm: \u201cAre you sure about that, Mr. Malkovich?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 looks at Ulm.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cListen, did something bad happen to Annie and this\u2026 Jonah?\u201d Ulm: \u201cNot particularly, Mr. Malkovich.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cThen why the hell are you keeping me here? Asking these questions from me? Why the fuck won\u2019t you let me call my wife?\u201d Ulm: \u201cI am not at liberty to say.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 stands up and bangs on the glass with his palm.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, talk to me straight for once!\u201d [Ulm stares at SCP-8011-A-14 for several seconds. He checks the clipboard, then looks back up at the subject.] [Ulm visibly pauses for several seconds as he looks at SCP-8011-A-14.] 8 Ulm: \u201cAlright, Arnold. I will lay the situation out to you.\u201d [Ulm moves forward on his seat.] Ulm: \u201cAre you ready for what I am about to tell you?\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ulm: \u201cA week ago, Anna Bornholm was murdered by a man who had broken into the Kanzler building. This man knew where the floor which Augustus Life Incorporated was occupying, and also knew the approximate area where Anna Bornholm would be.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Ulm: \u201cNo, listen to me . Once he saw her, the man violently burst through the window of the meeting room and attacked Bornholm, repeatedly slamming her head against the wall until she was dead. Then, this man, seized by some violent hysteria, ate three fingers from her hand.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cDoctor, what are you saying-\u201d Ulm: \u201cNext: last night, another murder occurred outside of Concord. This time, a man named Jonah Marlowe was eating dinner with his wife and in-laws. Then, at 8:22 PM in the evening, a man broke into the house which they were eating at and immediately pounced on Marlowe, physically assaulting him to such a degree that he was half-dead. Then, not satisfied, the man then bit pieces out of Marlowe\u2019s face. He did this so violently, in fact, that parts of the victim\u2019s skull were exposed by the time he expired. Does that sound familiar? \u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d Ulm: \u201cThen, with no compulsion for guilt whatsoever, the man then stood up, straightened his tattered suit, wiped the blood from his face, and smiled to Marlowe\u2019s newlywed wife, Nicole Tyler-Marlowe.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 has a clear expression of shock on its face. It does not immediately offer a reply.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201c\u2026What the fuck are you saying?\u201d Ulm: \u201cDo you know the reason why you\u2019re here, Arnold?\u201d [Ulm smiles ungenuinely at SCP-8011-A-14.] Ulm: \u201cBecause you\u2019re the one who committed these murders. That\u2019s why we took you in. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d [Ulm clicks the pen in his hand.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying.\u201d Ulm: \u201cYou died on November 23, 2019. You never married Nicole Tyler. You were never promoted to department head. Other people did that in your place.\u201d [Ulm clicks the pen in his hand again.] Ulm: \u201cAnd now you killed Jonah and Annie, just so that you could pretend to be what they are\u2026 that you never were. You\u2019re living a lie, Arnold. Wake up.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYOU\u2019RE FUCKING LYING!\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYOU\u2019RE LYING!\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass again, eliciting loud cracks from its right hand.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cGET ME OUT OF HERE, YOU LYING SON OF A BITCH!\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 punches the glass repeatedly with both of his hands, causing multiple fractures across the phalanx bones and carpals. SCP-8011-A-14 does not notice them.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cFUCK YOU! YOU\u2019RE LYING! FUCK YOU!\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 stops punching the glass. Tears are streaming down both of its cheeks.] [After a few seconds, SCP-8011-A-14 falls to the ground and hugs its knees to its chest. It starts to rock itself back and forth. It begins to cry loudly, followed by whimpering.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying. You\u2019re lying. You\u2019re lying. \u201d [Ulm stands in front of SCP-8011-A-14, his arms folded across his chest.] Ulm: \u201cYou didn\u2019t even feel it, did you?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 sniffles.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWhat?\u201d Ulm: \u201cYour hands.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201c What about my hands? \u201d Ulm: \u201cThey\u2019re broken to hell. Look at them.\u201d SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cWhy the hell would I?\u201d Ulm: \u201cYou have nothing to lose by looking at your hands, SCP-8011-A-14. Look at them.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s face twitches.] Ulm: \u201cGo on. Look at them.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 brings its hands up to look at them. Its eyes widen in horror.] Ulm: \u201cYou\u2019re dead , Arnold. You can\u2019t feel a thing. Look at your suit. Look at your skin. You\u2019re rotting. \u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 moans in horror. It stumbles back as it continues to look at its hands.] SCP-8011-A-14: \u201cNo\u2026 no no no no no\u2026\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 starts whimpering. It attempts to grip the table near him for balance as it continues to step back, but its broken hand is unable to support its weight. It falls to the ground.] Ulm: \u201cYou were never promoted. You never married Nicole Tyler. Instead, on November 23rd, 2019, you died in a car accident\u2013 scared, alone, and slowly bleeding out.\u201d [Ulm stands up from his chair.] Ulm: \u201cYou\u2019re dead, Arnold. Accept it.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 screams in anguish while on the floor. It continues to do this for forty seconds.] [Afterwards, SCP-8011-A-14\u2019s anguished screams decrease to low, repeating whimpers.] [Ulm watches expectantly at SCP-8011-A-14.] Ulm: \u201cArnold? Are you still there?\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 lies in a ball on the floor, motionless.] Ulm: \u201cArno-\u201d [Suddenly, SCP-8011-A-14 launches itself at the glass wall in a hyper-aggressive state, repeatedly banging its head against the glass. It starts screaming in extreme rage, before pummelling the glass wall with what is left of its hands. Its right hand is seen falling from its forearm.] [Ulm smiles in fascination.] Ulm: \u201cI\u2019ll take note of this.\u201d [SCP-8011-A-14 screams louder in response, before banging its head against the glass wall again.] [Ulm begins to animatedly write in his clipboard. He turns away as SCP-8011-A-14 continues to bang against the glass wall in rage.] <end log>",
