Information on SCP-8410\u2019s past, especially its involvement with Incident 140-CK, is to be restricted to individuals with level 4/8410 clearance. Individuals are only to be given such clearance after a panel of Foundation psychologists has performed a background check and psychological analysis and concluded that they are unlikely to harm SCP-8410 in retaliation for its role in Incident 140-CK.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8410 is a twelve-year-old humanoid male. SCP-8410 currently possesses no outwardly apparent anomalous properties. However, for several years prior to Incident 140-CK, SCP-8410 experienced nightly paracognitive dreams seemingly set in a fictionalized version of Northern Asia c. the 1700s B.C.E. Although these dreams were not reliably accurate in their depiction of the region, they contained a significant amount of classified information regarding anomalous elements active at that time. SCP-8410 denies accessing classified information regarding the period and claims to have never witnessed any anomalous phenomena prior to its first encounter with the Wanderer\u2019s Library, which occurred several years after these dreams began.\n\n\nDescriptions of several of these dreams are given in the document below.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8410 first came to the Foundation\u2019s attention when, in the aftermath of Incident 140-CK, it was discovered by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588, a member of MTF Sigma-3 (\u201cBibliographers\u201d), near the Wanderer\u2019s Library\u2019s copy of \nSCP-140\n. The entity was unconscious due to severe blood loss. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588 transported it to Site-\u2588\u2588, where it was resuscitated.\n\n\nAt the time of its capture, SCP-8410 was in possession of a handwritten, hardcover journal. Its contents have been transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\n\nHey there!\n\n\nI guess me and my mom are the only ones likely to read this, so, if you are reading this, you already know that this is the dream journal my mom got me for my 12th birthday so I could start writing down the strange dreams I have. I\u2019ve had one every night since I was six.\n\n\nNot some nights. Not most nights. Every night.\n\n\nThe dreams are about an ancient world of magic and monsters. It\u2019s not the Middle Ages. It\u2019s farther back, with weapons and shields and armor made of bronze.\n\n\nMagic is everywhere. All the best weapons and armor are magical, and those who wield magic in battle are feared and respected. Magic isn\u2019t just for fighting, though. There are pens that supply their own ink. There are spells that preserve food and make it taste better than anything in real life. There are paintings that move like TV screens, statues that come to life, and guqins that pluck their own strings. There are huge magical creatures. Pegasi, krakens, dragons, mogwai, spirits, ghosts, yokai, and giant tartigrades. Some of those creatures speak, and some can be ridden into battle, like my tartigrade mount, Snowflake.\n\n\nIn this world, there are four strange magical kingdoms. The Mekhanite kingdom is full of magic machines. Adytum is weird and creepy, with people who reshape their bodies. The Daevite Empire is full of slaves and led by evil tyrants bent on conquering the world, and my country, the Ortothan Kingdom, is the Empire\u2019s greatest enemy.\n\n\nIn this world, I\u2019m a heroic Warrior Prince, master of spear and spell alike. Sometimes I fight monsters. Sometimes I battle enemy armies. Sometimes I solve mysteries, explore strange ruins, or quest for ancient and powerful treasures. I do all these things on behalf of my mother, the queen, a kind and noble ruler, beloved by all the land. She looks and acts just like my real mom. She\u2019s just as caring, just as sweet, and her face lights up the same way when I tell her about my adventures.\n\n\nAlmost every morning, during breakfast, I tell my mom about my latest dream while we eat the amazing banana pancakes she makes every morning. She loves everything she hears.\n\n\nShe\u2019s the only one who knows about my dreams. I\u2019ve tried to tell my best friend Cory, because he\u2019s also in them sometimes, but he\u2019s never really wanted to hear about them. Dad doesn\u2019t know either. He\u2019s already at work by the time I wake up, so he doesn\u2019t hear about the dreams at breakfast. That\u2019s honestly fine with me. He hardly has any time to spend with me. He doesn\u2019t deserve to know about them.\n\n\nMom has always said I should write my dreams down, and that I should try to make them into books someday. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go that far, but I don\u2019t mind writing them down here. That way, I can come back and revisit them when I want to relive one of my adventures.\n\n\nLast night, I fought a grand battle.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been marching on the Daevite Empire for weeks. After our victory at the battle of Omass, where we stopped their march into our kingdom, we\u2019ve been pressing our advantage. We\u2019ve left a trail of slain Daevas and freed slaves as we\u2019ve moved through their lands. Now, we\u2019re closing in on their capital, where we can put an end to their tyranny once and for all.\n\n\nTheir army is thousands-strong and headed by enormous walking trees that could crush our knights into paste.\n\n\nFortunately, we have machines of our own.\n\n\nI mentioned that my best friend Cory shows up in my dreams. He has ever since I met him. In real life, Cory is the smartest person I know. In my dreams, he\u2019s a genius inventor from the Mekhanite kingdom, who builds fantastic machines to use in our adventures. Thus, just as the Daevites were piloting enormous trees, me and my companions were piloting great machines of clockwork and bronze as our kingdoms\u2019 armies did fierce battle below us.\n\n\nMy battles with the enemy\u2019s machines were fierce. I traded blows with one for more than ten minutes before a great blow to its head caused its pilot to fall out of it. Soon after, when one charged at me, I took it out with a spell that opened a giant pit under it.\n\n\nI left Cory to fight the last machine while I attacked the capital\u2019s outer wall. I could hear Daevite soldiers scrambling to get away from the chunks of rock I sent flying with every punch and kick. I kept wailing on the wall until I\u2019d opened a massive hole for our army to pour in through.\n\n\nOnce we had a way inside, we unmade their city, defeating their warriors, and freeing every slave.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Daevite royal family, including their evil queen, got away. The cowards had fled before we arrived.\n\n\nStill, this was a glorious day. We\u2019d dealt a blow to their empire from which they would never recover.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\n\nLast night, we were back at the queen\u2019s palace, holding a grand feast to celebrate our victory against the Daevites. The food was amazing. A dozen courses. Rice in wonderful sauce. Succulent goose covered with something that was sweet and sour at the same time. Small, sweet cakes, frosted with sweeter cream.\n\n\nAt the end of the feast, the Queen called me, Cory, and several more of her bravest warriors to be commended for our heroism. She gave a speech about our bravery as she slipped medals around our necks.\n\n\nI dream about a celebration like this at the end of most of my adventures. Mom always likes hearing about them. I wish I could\u2019ve kept telling her about the dream all day, but eventually, it was time to hug each other goodbye, so I could go off to school and she could go to work.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\n\nGrandma came to school during lunch today, while I was talking with Cory about a show he\u2019d watched.\n\n\nThe look on her face worried me.\n\n\nShe asked me to follow her into the hallway. A pit formed in my stomach. I glanced at Cory for a moment, then followed her out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked once we were in the hall.\n\n\n\u201cSweetie,\u201d she said, \u201cyour mother was in a car crash.\u201d\n\n\nThe pit grew tighter. I asked how bad it was.\n\n\nIt was bad enough that Grandma felt the need to come get me and bring me straight to the hospital.\n\n\nIt turned out to be pointless. The doctors didn\u2019t let me see my mom. She was having surgery the whole time.\n\n\nA few times, I overheard the doctors talking with my grandma. They sugarcoated things when they realized I could hear them, but when they didn\u2019t, it was clear that they didn\u2019t think mom would live.\n\n\nDad didn\u2019t make it to the hospital. He was too busy with work. Grandma had to drive me home.\n\n\nI can\u2019t wait to go to sleep tonight.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\n\nIn last night\u2019s dream, I was in the hall outside the Queen\u2019s bedchamber. The Queen had been poisoned at the feast by a Daevite spy, and now she was lying unconscious on her bed. While the greatest alchemists in the land scrambled to find a cure, I was fighting the grim reaper that had come to claim her.\n\n\nIt was the hardest battle I\u2019d ever fought, and the first one to ever frighten me. The reaper was huge, like the skeleton of a giant, dressed in an impossibly pure black robe. Despite how big it was, it was incredibly fast, zipping freely through the air, dodging every thrust of my spear.\n\n\nMy screeching alarm woke me up before the battle concluded.\n\n\nMy dad had left a note by my bed, telling me he was busy at work, and that I should eat cereal for breakfast and get ready for school on my own.\n\n\nI hate cereal.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\n\nGrandma came to get me at school again. She told me to follow her into the hall. I did.\n\n\nShe put her hand on my shoulder. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she said, \u201cyour mother is gone.\u201d\n\n\nI could hardly stand. My eyes were blurry with tears. Grandma grabbed me and pulled me into a firm hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\n\nI didn\u2019t have a dream last night.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t happen. Not once since my fantasy dreams started.\n\n\nFor once, dad was still home when I woke up. We ate breakfast together. Cereal again.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no one left who knows about my dreams. This book is now the only record of them outside my own memories.\n\n\nI could tell someone else. Grandma would probably be willing to listen. I could even start calling her to tell her about them every morning, just like I used to do with Mom.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019d make me feel better, though. Doing that with someone else would just remind me that I couldn\u2019t do it with my mom.\n\n\nDad told me about the funeral.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be short. Just a little service at the side of her grave.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy not a proper funeral?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have wanted to inconvenience everyone like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think she would want everyone to have a chance to say goodbye.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe service will be enough for that.\u201d\n\n\nIt won\u2019t be, though. At least, it will be less than she deserves. Saying goodbye to her is not an \u201cinconvenience.\u201d She was the best person in the world, and she deserves to be celebrated.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\n\nAnother dreamless night.\n\n\nThe \u201cfuneral,\u201d is tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 13, 2024\n\n\nThe funeral lasted less than half an hour. Dad barely looked sad.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think he cares at all.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\n\nI finally had another dream.\n\n\nIt was the end of my battle with the grim reaper.\n\n\nI fought with everything I had. My spells were tearing up the palace, ripping apart the walls, destroying beautiful, priceless decorations, making chunks of the ceiling rain down. None of that mattered. The only thing that mattered was fighting this monster off. The Queen was counting on me.\n\n\nAn ill-timed lunge left the hall to my right wide-open. The reaper rocketed past me, toward the Queen\u2019s chamber. My eyes went wide. I spun around and thrust at the monster with everything I had.\n\n\nMy spear pierced the creature\u2019s robe and shattered the base of its spine. It stopped moving. Its head turned all the way around to give me a final, hateful glare, then it crumbled into ash.\n\n\nRelief overtook me. Relief so powerful I couldn\u2019t help laughing. I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d saved her. As soon as I regained my composure, I went into the room. Mom was already sitting up on her bed. I ran over and hugged her.\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d\n\n\nAs soon as I was awake, I started crying. Not because I was sad. I wasn\u2019t sad. I was happy. Happy that there was a place where I could still see her.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\n\nThere was another feast, with increased security, to celebrate the Queen\u2019s survival. Both of us were showered with gifts, and all the realm praised me for winning a duel with death himself.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\n\nIt was time for the queen to give me my next mission.\n\n\nMe and Cory met her in the throne room.\n\n\n\u201cNow that the Daevites have fallen,\u201d the Queen said, \u201cthere is one final thing that must be done to ensure that their light is snuffed out forever.\u201d\n\n\nShe told us about a magical artifact called the Chronicle of Ages. It was an ancient and powerful book, whose magic could rewrite reality, even change the past, to make all your dreams come true.\n\n\nIf a surviving Daevite got a hold of it, they would be able to rewrite history to undo our conquest of their capital.\n\n\nThe book was in the \u201cWanderer\u2019s Library,\u201d a magical library on a far-off island. We would need to cross the Kingdom of Adytum to get to it. That made Cory nervous. The Adytites were bitter enemies of Cory\u2019s people.\n\n\nStill, knowing how important this quest was, he agreed to come with me.\n\n\nWhen I woke up, a burst of excitement overcame me. Finally, another adventure. The dreams of questing were always my favorite. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell mom.\n\n\nThen I remembered.\n\n\nI looked over at my alarm clock. Dad had left the note by my bed again, telling me to get ready for school on my own.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t. I just laid back, I closed my eyes and tried to fall back to sleep.\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\n\nDad chewed me out for skipping school.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t find out about it until he checked his phone at the end of the day and saw he\u2019d missed a call from the school\u2019s administration, but once he listened to the message they\u2019d left him, he called me and told me I was grounded for two weeks.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t like the tone I said that with, so he added another week for being \u2018disrespectful.\u2019\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\n\nWe set off on our adventure last night.\n\n\nAdytum is dangerous. Almost as soon as we crossed the border into their kingdom, we were set upon by strange, flying monsters. Blood-sucking fusions between humans and bats that zipped through the air to dodge every shot from Cory\u2019s mechanical crossbow.\n\n\nI had to use a lightning spell to bring them down. It arced from monster to monster, making them fall to the ground, stunned. I rode Snowflake from man-bat to man-bat, thrusting my spear through each of their hearts.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 18, 2024\n\n\nNext, we had to cross a patch of land where every living thing had been consumed by a terrible disease that made them look like they\u2019d melted. According to Cory, the Adytites had created this disease as a weapon against their enemies, but it had somehow accidentally been released within their own lands.\n\n\nI cast a spell to keep us from getting infected, but we still had to fight our way through.\n\n\nI slew every single monster in the name of the Queen.\n\n\nThanks to my grounding, I haven\u2019t hung out with Cory since Mom died, but the time I spend with him in my dreams is something Dad can\u2019t take away from me.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\n\nAdytum gave us one last battle on our way out of it. In the land\u2019s strange forests of flesh, we did battle with a monster whose mouth was half its body. The thing\u2019s sticky tongue managed to grab Cory, and it swallowed him. I flipped the thing over by raising a pillar of earth underneath it, then used the tip of my spear to cut the creature\u2019s stomach open so I could pull Cory back out.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\n\nAs soon as dad got home from work, he told me he needed to talk to me.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, as respectfully as I could.\n\n\nHe sat down on the bed. \u201cHarold,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should know, I\u2019ve started dating someone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust a few weeks after mom died?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cHer name is Sarah. I know it\u2019s not been very long, but I didn\u2019t choose when I would meet her. It happened when it happened. I know you\u2019ve had a hard time dealing with things, and I\u2019ve not had enough time to spend with you.\n\n\n\u201cMom can\u2019t be replaced.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, but Sarah\u2019s still coming over for dinner tomorrow, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\n\nAt least I\u2019m not the only one upset. A few hours later, I happened to walk into the room while he was on the phone with Grandma. She was yelling at the top of her lungs, accusing Dad of having been with this woman since before mom died.\n\n\nI bet she\u2019s right. Dad hasn\u2019t given a crap about Mom in years. Why wouldn\u2019t he start seeing someone else?\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\n\nOur battle with the frog-thing behind us, we arrived at a coastal town of fishermen and fleshcrafters. With Cory in disguise, we managed to rent a small ship we could use to sail away from Adytum, toward the island where we\u2019d find the Wanderer\u2019s Library.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\n\nSarah came over for dinner.\n\n\nShe was an olive-skinned woman with short hair. She was nice, at first. She told me she was sorry about my mother\u2019s death, and that she was happy to meet me. She said she\u2019d heard a lot about me, how creative and curious I was, and that she hoped \u201cour relationship\u201d would be \u201cfruitful.\u201d\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what she meant by that, but I thanked her anyway.\n\n\nShe seemed to have Dad wrapped around her finger. She sat down and directed him to set the table. Dad would never have done that for Mom, but when Sarah told him to do it, he didn\u2019t even complain.\n\n\nSarah did most of the talking once the meal started. Dad was seemingly just there to nod and agree with everything she said. I think I was there for decoration. Neither of them said a word to me until Sarah cut herself off mid-sentence to turn to me and say, \u201cand please do chew with your mouth \nclosed\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t raise your voice.\u201d\n\n\nI huffed. Sarah found this huff extremely disrespectful. She looked at Dad, expectantly, who quickly swallowed the bite of chicken he\u2019d been working on and declared that I was grounded for another week.\n\n\n\u201cOh C\u2019mon!\u201d I said.\n\n\nThis got me sent straight to my room. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to take my food there with me.\n\n\nIf this keeps up, I\u2019m going to be grounded for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2024\n\n\nThe Wanderer\u2019s Library sat alone on a sandy island. It was green and yellow, as if its bricks were made of gold studded with emerald. It looked more like a palace than a library.\n\n\nNo. Not even a palace was made of solid gold.\n\n\nLuckily, the island had a dock where we could leave our boat. Once we\u2019d secured it, we approached what we thought was the library\u2019s front entrance. From afar, it looked like a door made of red stone. Once we reached it, we could see that it wasn\u2019t a door at all. It was a section of brick wall. Not old, clay or stone brick. Modern, red-brown brick, with a single bright red block near its center, and most of the word \u201cawesomesauce\u201d spraypainted across the top of it.\n\n\nEven weirder, I\u2019d seen this section of wall before, in an alley next to a game store Mom used to take me to. It\u2019s only a few miles away from my house.\n\n\nAs I stared at the wall, trying to make sense of how something so real and modern had found its way into my dream world, Cory asked how we were going to get into the library without a door.\n\n\nI started to say that I didn\u2019t know, but before I could get the words out, I realized I did know. I didn\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew. I stepped up to the wall, knocked on the bright red brick five times and made a strange noise. Cory started to ask what the heck I was doing, but just a second later, we were inside.\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t walk inside. No door opened. We didn\u2019t step forward. We simply found ourselves inside the building, with a similar section of brick on the wall behind us.\n\n\nThe building was green and gold on the inside too, and it was impossibly huge. The hall seemed to stretch on forever both in front of us and above us, with all that infinite space lined with well-stocked bookshelves.\n\n\n\u201cGods,\u201d I muttered.\n\n\n\u201cThis is more than we could possibly search through,\u201d Cory said.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we could find a librarian?\u201d I asked.\n\n\nAfter walking around the library for a while, we were able to find what seemed to be a help desk.\n\n\nThe thing sitting behind it was a strange mound of feathers and mushrooms with no visible eyes. As soon as he saw it, Cory reached for his crossbow, but I held out my hand to stop him. I asked the thing where we could find the Chronicle of Ages. It extended one of its many wings to point to its left, down the hall.\n\n\n\u201cCan you be more specific than that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\nThe creature just kept pointing.\n\n\nAfter walking for a long time, we came across a small door imbedded in one of the shelves.\n\n\nWe went inside. Unlike the handful of other side rooms we\u2019d seen, this room had only a single book, ornate and blue, sitting on a pedestal. Its cover bore a bright red title in a foreign language. I could only presume it said, \u2018Chronicle of Ages.\u2019\n\n\nStanding next to the pedestal was a woman in a long, hooded black robe that obscured her face and hair. She looked straight at us as we entered. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Harold,\u201d she said.\n\n\nI went still for a moment. No one in the dream world ever uses my real name. I\u2019m always \u201cthe Warrior Prince\u201d or sometimes \u201cHero\u201d or \u201cHoly Warrior.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I know your name?\u201d the woman asked as I stared at her. \u201cI\u2019m in your dream, after all.\u201d\n\n\nI glanced at Cory, worried about how he might react to the claim that he was in a dream of mine. Cory wasn\u2019t reacting, though. He wasn\u2019t moving at all. \u201cCory?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI just turned him off for a moment. He would only get in the way of the talk we need to have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\nShe thought about that for a moment. \u201cA Queen,\u201d she said. \u201cNot your Queen, of course. Another one. You wouldn\u2019t know my name if I gave it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cI need to tell you something very important. Something you must have suspected for some time. I need to help you understand the true nature of this place, of everything you see in your dreams.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that you never guessed it. At the very least, you must have hoped for it. This world is too large, too detailed to be the product of a single child\u2019s dreaming imagination.\u201d\n\n\nAdmittedly, I have had that thought before.\n\n\n\u201cWhatever suspicions you might have had, I am here to confirm them. This whole world, in which you have been adventuring for years, is real. It is a slice of the past. A picture of the world as it once was. When magic and splendor flowed freely through all the lands of the earth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cI do not begrudge you thinking so. Fortunately for both of us, there is a way for you to confirm what I say. The place from which you entered the Wanderer\u2019s Library, did you recognize it?\u201d\n\n\nI hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo to that alley. Knock on the lone bright red brick, just as you did here, and you will find yourself in the Wanderer\u2019s Library.\u201d\n\n\nI stared at her. This was ridiculous. Completely and utterly insane. Beyond anything that could ever be possible.\n\n\nSure, my dreams are strange. I\u2019ve never been able to find another example of someone\u2019s dreams telling them continuing stories, night after night, for years on end, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s possible for magic to be real.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t have the opportunity to say that, though, because just after the woman finished talking, the dream ended.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2024\n\n\nAs soon as I got home from school today, I came up to my room to look through my journal. I don\u2019t know exactly what I was looking for. I guess something that would help me make sense of what that hooded woman said.\n\n\nI read through the whole journal several times, and tried to remember everything I could about the dreams I had before mom gave it to me. I was there for hours, so long that I was still reading when Dad got home.\n\n\nHe opened the door. His appearance was so sudden that it made me jump. \u201cHello,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cSarah is coming over for dinner again tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, as flatly as possible.\n\n\nHe nodded. He was just about to leave when his gaze shifted to my hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s that book you\u2019re holding?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with it a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy\u2026 my dream journal,\u201d I told him, my mind racing to try to figure out why he would care.\n\n\nHe walked over to me. He held his hand out. Reluctantly, I handed him the book. He started flipping through it. \u201cSo these are dreams you\u2019ve had?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI write them down because sometimes Mom is in them.\u201d\n\n\nThat made him think for a moment. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s healthy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClinging to the past can be a bad idea. At worst, it could be a form of denial. Sometimes, something horrible still needs to be accepted\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t take it away,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was Mom\u2019s gift for my last birthday. It\u2019s the last thing she ever gave me.\u201d\n\n\nHe looked down at me. After a moment, he handed the book back. \u201cAlright then, you can keep it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut, if your behavior doesn\u2019t get better than it\u2019s been these past few weeks, that might change.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBehave yourself, and it won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n\n\nI thought of complaining, but I know from experience that Dad considers that to be misbehavior, so I was silent as he left the room.\n\n\nAs soon as he shut the door, I looked over at the window. The alley I saw in my dream is within walking distance of my house. I could go there.\n\n\nBut I can\u2019t do that while Dad\u2019s here. If he gets it into his head that the journal made me sneak out, he\u2019ll definitely take it away from me.\n\n\nI\u2019m going to hide this journal. I think there\u2019s a place in my room where it\u2019ll be safe. I won\u2019t say where in case he somehow ends up reading this.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\n\nThe dreams are gone again.\n\n\nAs if there weren\u2019t enough else wrong with my life. I still have weeks of grounding left. I\u2019ve barely spoken to Cory.\n\n\nTomorrow is Saturday. Dad is going to be at work all day. If I\u2019m going to go to that alley, if I\u2019m going to test what that woman said, tomorrow will be the easiest time to sneak out.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\n\nDad was already gone when I woke up.\n\n\nI left out the front door, locking it behind me with a spare housekey. I walked to the alley from my dream and approached the single, bright red brick at the center of the wall. I made sure no one was watching me, then I knocked on it five times and made the same noise I had in my dream.\n\n\nIt worked.\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand how. It\u2019s impossible. I know it\u2019s impossible. Nothing like this could be real. Maybe it\u2019s not real. Maybe I\u2019m just going insane. I don\u2019t know. All I can say is what I saw.\n\n\nI found myself in a library. Not quite the same library from my dream. The ceiling wasn\u2019t infinitely high, though it was way higher than the building I\u2019d knocked on. Every wall was covered in well-stocked wooden bookshelves. There were all kinds of books there. Long books. Short books. Black books. Red books. Old, yellow books. Brand new, bright white books. Hardcover books. Notebooks. Diaries. Textbooks. Novels. Newspapers. Magazines, and guidebooks.\n\n\nThere were creatures crawling on the shelves. Weird, skinny monsters, each using several legs to climb around the shelves. No two of them looked quite the same. One was a bird. One was a rodent. One was a cross between a spider and an octopus.\n\n\nIn my dream, I gotten to the Chronicle of Ages by going straight for several hours until I found the room it was in. I decided I\u2019d do the same thing here. Even if I didn\u2019t find the Chronicle, I figured that as long as I kept going straight, I couldn\u2019t get lost.\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s wrong to call the path I took \u201cstraight.\u201d I didn\u2019t turn any corners where I could help it, but the path I was on curved, twisted, rose, and fell. There was one place where the hall seemed to turn on its side. I thought for a moment that this was going to force me to start walking on the bookshelves, but as the floor curved, gravity curved with it, and I found myself walking comfortably on the sideways floor.\n\n\nAbout an hour into my trek, I found a lounge. There were a handful of people there. Some of them looked normal. Some of them really, really didn\u2019t. On the far side of the room, a man with bright blue skin conversed with a giant bird who held a small white book in his wingtips. I couldn\u2019t help but stare until the bird thing looked back at me. I turned away and hurried toward the opposite hall.\n\n\nBefore I could make it, someone approached me. Not a monster, thank God. Just a woman with long black hair. I stopped walking. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cAre you alone here?\u201d she asked.\n\n\nI wondered for a moment if I should admit that I was, but there was no point in lying. Anyone could see that there was no one else with me. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully young to be here alone,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs this place dangerous?\u201d\n\n\nShe tilted her head. \u201cThis place?\u201d she asked. \u201cPlease tell me you at least know where you are.\u201d\n\n\nIt took me a second to remember what this place was called, but when I did, I put all the confidence I could muster into saying, \u201cI\u2019m in the Wanderer\u2019s Library.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cAs for whether the library is dangerous, it depends on if you follow the rules. As long as you do, it\u2019s the safest place in the multiverse. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be lucky if you ever leave again.\u201d\n\n\nShe went on to explain what the rules are. Don\u2019t fight anyone else. Don\u2019t damage any books. Always return them on time.\n\n\nI assured her that I would obey all of those rules.\n\n\nShe started to walk away, but I told her I had one more question. I asked her if she knew anything about the Chronicle of Ages, or where I could find it.\n\n\nShe said she had never heard of it before.\n\n\nAfter that, I continued down the hall.\n\n\nI tried very hard not to stare at anyone else, no matter how strange they looked. The only other gathering of people I encountered was a small crowd that was waiting for an enormous, slimy worm to finish crawling across a hallway I needed to pass through.\n\n\nI wish I\u2019d thought to bring some water. Walking for hours and hours is a lot more tiring when it\u2019s not part of a dream. There were bathrooms, thankfully, and I was able to get some from their sinks.\n\n\nI pushed forward, and, eventually, \nfinally\n, I reached the room containing the Chronicle of Ages.\n\n\nLike the rest of the library, it looked different than it had in my dream. It was a normal door, rather than a bit of bookshelf that swung open. There was a sign posted outside it. \u201cNo books or liquids may be brought into this room.\u201d\n\n\nA strange rule, but I didn\u2019t have any books or liquids with me, so I went inside.\n\n\nIn my dream, the room with the Chronicle had been so dark you couldn\u2019t have actually read inside it. This room was lit brightly. It was narrower than the one in my dream, and a lot longer. I had to walk another hundred feet or so to get to the pedestal with the book on it. This pedestal was taller, made of stone instead of wood, and the Chronicle was attached to it by a thick chain.\n\n\nI opened the book.\n\n\nAs soon as my eyes met its pages, I felt a powerful urge to read it cover to cover, right then and there. For some reason, I was completely sure that it would be the most interesting thing I\u2019ve ever read.\n\n\nI had to resist the urge, though. The book was hundreds of pages long. It would\u2019ve taken me hours to read it, and I didn\u2019t have time to do that and walk all the way back home before Dad noticed I was gone.\n\n\nI had to settle for skimming the book. Fortunately, it had plenty of illustrations.\n\n\nAs I went through it, making note of those illustrations, and of the bits of it here and there that I did read, I realized that this book was about the world of my dreams.\n\n\nSketched onto those pages, I saw the seven-pointed star of the Ortothan Kingdom. The crest of the Daevite Empire. The banner of Adytum. An artist\u2019s rendition of my great battle with the Daevites\u2019 walking trees. There was a passage about the fey folk, another about the great sea serpent, still another about the immortal dragon who always seemed to slip away before I could finish him off.\n\n\nAnd, at the end of the book, the final defeat of the Daevite Empire.\n\n\nDoes that mean that what the woman said was true? That I\u2019ve been dreaming about the past?\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\n\nDad came into my room after he got home from work yesterday.\n\n\nI was on my bed, reading a history book I\u2019d borrowed from the school library, trying to find more evidence that the Daevites or Ortothans might have been real.\n\n\n\u201cSarah and I had a talk about that journal of yours,\u201d Dad said.\n\n\nI looked up at him. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cSarah doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to cling to the past like that. You need to accept what\u2019s gone and move on. We won\u2019t throw the book away, but it\u2019s going up in the attic for a while. Where is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI already got rid of it.\u201d\n\n\nHe clearly hadn\u2019t expected to hear that.\n\n\n\u201cI realized you were right,\u201d I continued. \u201cI need to move on. Besides, I\u2019m too old for fairy tales.\u201d I held up the book I was holding \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m reading a history book now, about things that really happened. I threw the dream journal away. You can look around for yourself if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\n\nHe did. He looked all over my bookshelf and my bedside table. He looked under my bed, and my pillow. He dug through every drawer, and looked behind everything he could move. For a few minutes, he was dangerously close to my hiding place, but he wasn\u2019t quite clever enough to find it.\n\n\n\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re telling the truth,\u201d he said. He smiled. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw him smile. \u201cGetting rid of that book on your own was very mature. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\n\nI smiled back. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said.\n\n\nHe left.\n\n\nI lucked out today, but I\u2019m not going to be able to keep this journal hidden forever. It\u2019s still in my room. If I keep taking it out to write in it, he\u2019s eventually going to see me with it again. When he does, he\u2019ll take it away, and my last connection to the world of my dreams, to Mom, will be gone.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n\nI finally had another dream.\n\n\nI was in the same room as before, the dream version of the Wanderer\u2019s Library, with the hooded woman and the Chronicle of Ages. Cory was still frozen next to me.\n\n\n\u201cI believe you\u2019ve been to the Wanderer\u2019s Library?\u201d The woman asked.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cNever mind that. The important thing is, you\u2019ve seen that everything I said was true?\u201d\n\n\nI hesitated. \u201cIt looked real,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cVery good. Now, with that established\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho are you, really?\u201d I asked.\n\n\nHer face shifted to a slight frown. \u201cI told you. I am a queen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not a real answer.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it is the answer you will receive.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow are you talking to me in my dreams?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen that magic is real. How do you think I\u2019m doing it?\u201d\n\n\nI studied her. There was something familiar about her, but I couldn\u2019t place it. Her face was hidden by her hood and the dim light of this room. \u201cThe library looked a little different in real life,\u201d I said, \u201cbut, the blue book that was on its own in the huge room, it was the Chronicle of Ages, right?\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\n\u201cCan the Chronicle of Ages really make all your dreams come true?\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYes, it can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen\u2026\u201d I hesitated again, \u201c\u2026could I use it to make my dreams come true? These dreams, where I\u2019m in this land full of magic and adventure. Where my mom is still the Queen. Is still alive?\u201d\n\n\nThe woman\u2019s face lit up, just like Mom\u2019s used to when I told her about my dreams. \u201cYou are a clever boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just about to bring up that very subject.\u201d She gestured at the Chronicle of Ages. \u201cThis book, this glorious book, does indeed have that power. To rewrite the world. To bring back the magic and adventure that it has lost. To take this wonderful past and drag it forward into the present.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow do I make it happen?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult. The Chronicle has the power to write itself. The only thing it cannot do is supply its own ink. Give it something to write with, any dark fluid you can find, and it will do the rest. You will emerge from the library to find your world rewritten. Your dreams made real. You shall be a hero. A Warrior Prince. You will be able to see your best friend, and your mother\u2019s reign shall continue.\u201d\n\n\nIt seemed too good to be true, but why shouldn\u2019t it be true? If that library and all the fantastical creatures I saw in it could exist, why shouldn\u2019t there be a book that could make all your dreams come true?\n\n\nThere was a problem, though. \u201cI can\u2019t bring any ink to the book,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the library, the real one, there\u2019s a sign outside this room that says you can\u2019t bring liquids into it. I don\u2019t think I should disobey that. I\u2019ve been told that breaking the library\u2019s rules is very dangerous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe Library is not to be trifled with.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cThere is, of course, one liquid they cannot stop you from bringing into the room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t done before. Magic, in this world, often comes at one particular price.\u201d\n\n\nI started to ask her what she meant, but then I realized.\n\n\nThere\u2019s something about my dreams that I\u2019ve been leaving out of this journal. Something even Mom never knew. Ortothan magic, the whole Ortothan religion, is full of blood. We give blood offerings to our gods. Only small amounts, from willing doners. Usually, it\u2019s a gift, to empower the gods to protect the world, but, sometimes, the offerings are payments, given in exchange for miracles. That\u2019s how I cast many of my most powerful spells. It's how I summoned lightning to take down those bats, and how I opened that giant pit underneath the Daevites\u2019 moving tree.\n\n\n\u201cHow much blood will the book take?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cNo more than you give in your offerings.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd in exchange for that, I can have my mother back?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. You can.\u201d\n\n\nI looked at her. I still couldn\u2019t make out her face. Her eyes. All I could see was that she was smiling.\n\n\n\u201cI understand that this is a lot to take in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can take some time to think it over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need time,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it.\u201d\n\n\nSomehow, her smile grew even wider. \u201cExcellent,\u201d she said. \u201cMake your way to the library as soon as you can. Give the Chronicle of Ages an offering, and it will rewrite the world.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, the woman vanished.\n\n\nJust a moment later, Cory started moving again. I looked over at him. He looked back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you see something strange?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\nI walked up to the pedestal. This Chronicle of Ages wasn\u2019t chained to it. I took the book, walked the long path back out of the library, and used my magic to return to my mother\u2019s throne room.\n\n\nMom stood as soon as she saw that I\u2019d appeared. Her gaze was warm. Loving. I ran up to her and hugged her. She hugged me back. I held her tight. I cried.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\u201cNothing. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve come through for me again, my Warrior Prince, as you always shall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\n\nIt\u2019s Wednesday. A school day.\n\n\nI don\u2019t care. After what I\u2019m going to do today, I\u2019ll never have to go to school again.\n\n\nI\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019ve grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen and the big water bottle Dad used to take on his morning walks. I\u2019m going to go back to the Library, give the Chronicle an offering, and change the world.\n\n\nI\u2019m taking the journal with me, too. I won\u2019t break the rules by taking it inside the room, but I want to keep it close. I don\u2019t want the Chronicle of Ages to erase it when it changes the world.\n\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see Mom again.\n\n\n\n\nShortly after composing this document, SCP-8410 appears to have approached the Wanderer\u2019s Library\u2019s copy of \nSCP-140\n and lacerated itself.
