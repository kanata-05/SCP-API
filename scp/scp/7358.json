Further research into several different as of yet unknown mechanical functions of SCP-7358 is currently underway. The implications of SCP-7358's death should not be made clear to the research team or the maintenance bodies currently working on it.\n\n\nSurviving public records of any anomalous abilities displayed by SCP-7358 are to be confiscated and stored within its file. Any currently available public records on SCP-7358 should be minimized in importance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7358 is the corpse of the mythological horse Catalan, ridden by \u0218tefan cel Mare\n1\n during his rule of Moldavia.\n\n\nWhile possessing no apparent outward differences compared to a member of the \nEquus caballus\n2\n species, SCP-7358's structure, and major body functions are all mechanical in nature, with multiple additional features present, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nMetallic outer layer, composed of interlocking seamless plates for physical resistance,\n\n\nSignificantly altered brain with memory-recording implants present,\n\n\nZoom eye implants, engineered for long-distance scoping,\n\n\nHoof-mounted gyroscopic balancers, granting SCP-7358 the ability to stand upright,\n\n\nRetractable 15'' hoof steel blades.\n\n\n\n\nThe remains of SCP-7358 were discovered in an inactive, damaged state in the northeastern range of the Carpathian Mountains, nearing the border of Ukraine and Moldova. Upon discovery, the majority of the mechanical modifications possessed by SCP-7358 were severely damaged and decayed, though some features have been partially restored through extensive effort. Information gleaned during these repair efforts has led to the conclusion that the anomaly \"died\" and was deactivated sometime in the early 1920s.\n\n\nIndividuals working on SCP-7358 should not be made aware of its increased significance post-mortem.\n\n\nThrough continued efforts, approximately 0.0037% of the available memory data from SCP-7358 has been restored and copied. Below is an archive of important data collected from SCP-7358, though several files have been recovered in different stages of corruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum \n7358.1\n\n\nARCHIVE LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved\u00a0SCP-7358\u00a0Memory\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a004/14/1457\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved\u00a0SCP-7358\u00a0Memory\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a004/14/1457\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n For accessibility, the log below has been translated to English using an .aic language translator.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-7358 is situated in a forest clearing, overlooking a skirmish, later identified as the 1457 Battle of Orbic. SCP-7358 focuses on a fight between \u0218tefan cel Mare and Petru Aron.\n3\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n I have you cornered now, Petru! This shall be the day you draw your last breath, bastard!\n\n\n\u0218tefan can be seen clutching a long sword, standing over an injured Petru. A pair of soldiers are sneaking up on the two, which SCP-7358 notices.\n\n\nPetru:\n Do not be so sure about that, \u0218tefan\u2026 You won't take the throne, not from me at least, with your hot temper!\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n Maybe I will fail later on in my mission, but for you, this is your last failure.\n\n\nAs \u0218tefan is ready to impale Petru, the two men jump in the action, clashing with \u0218tefan, as Petru is prepared to run. Seeing \u0218tefan lose the battle between himself and the two men, SCP-7358 charges in.\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n [\u2026] Children of Satan! Gah, you will not take me down! \n(slash)\n Never!\n\n\nUnidentified Male:\n That's what they all say, scum!\n\n\n\u0218tefan, stabbed, takes a few steps back, as SCP-7358 enters the skirmish. Rising on two hooves and drawing blades, SCP-7358 and the two men enter a short battle. SCP-7358 dodges half a dozen blade thrusts, as the men scream in terror. \u0218tefan looks at the horse, bewildered, and then slowly rises up.\n\n\nShortly after, SCP-7358 manages to fatally wound one of the men, using his body to dispose of the other attacker.\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n W-what are you, foul beast?! The Devil in disguise, are you?! Curse you, monster!\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n Quell your anger, \u0218tefan. I am not of the Devil but neither God. I know who you are, and I have come here to save you, child. Do not be fooled by my appearance, I am more than a mere horse. But, only you will know that.\n\n\nSCP-7358 retracts its hoof-blades, and returns to a four-legged position.\n\n\n\u0218tefan\n How can I be sure of that?! That you aren't a wicked demon, who will lead me to the deepest pits of hell?!\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n You have to. \n(neigh)\n Until the day you die, I will be at your side, and your side only. Master.\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n I will deal with you later, but, where is Petru?!\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n I can still see him from here, he's entering the forest. Leave him be, as fate requires it to be. He will pose no threat to you anymore.\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n \u2026Fate?\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n Yes, fate.

Approximately 34 minutes pass before SCP-7358 moves, this time raising itself on two hooves, and waving at \u0218tefan, who notices and heads out to SCP-7358.\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n So?\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n It went well.\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n Of course. Have you thought about how you want to proceed from here? You have a lot of land to manage, and very little time.\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n I will figure out a way, for one who stumbles across the well-worn path will fare poorly in the wilderness. If what I have in front of me will be the biggest challenge for my rule, then I shouldn't even rule.\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n If you say so. What about the Poles?\n\n\n\u0218tefan:\n We have to act. With Petru gone, he's most likely there. We'll strike hard and fast.\n\n\nSCP-7358:\n Very well.

We could kill it now, but using it as a bargaining chip would potentially bring us many riches. He has always loved his horse.\n\n\nUnidentified Man 3:\n Do not rush to a conclusion, has this horse not been proclaimed as devilish before?

Since we have brought it in, it has only brought us bad luck.\n\n\nUnidentified Man 3:\n Would it not be simply better to kill it? After all, it could prove to be a huge blow to the morale of Istefanos.\n\n\nUnidentified Man 1:\n You may be right, indeed. Shall we consult further, with our brothers? Or finish it off right here?\n\n\nUnidentified Man 3:\n The horse can die. It's not good for anything, especially if it's tainted.\n\n\nUnidentified Man 1:\n So be it.\n\n\nThe three men head towards SCP-7358, ready to lead him away.
