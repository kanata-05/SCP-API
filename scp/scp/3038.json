A 10m\n2\n reinforced glass antechamber surrounds the object, accessible only by key card, and remains under constant surveillance. A perimeter has been established around Warehouse 52 manned by security personnel at all times.\n\n\nNo internet enabled devices are permitted beyond the perimeter. All requests and reports regarding SCP-3038 must be handwritten and delivered via specially assigned couriers. No other form of submission will be accepted. Research personnel must be psychologically assessed at least once a month, with any signs of mental deterioration detailed, and low evaluation scores resulting in immediate reassignment.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3038 is a white, wooden door. It has an ornate Victorian brass door knob and a large key hole through which light cannot penetrate. It is unknown whether it opens inwards or outwards, if at all. Individuals report a sense of discomfort when within 5 meters of SCP-3038.\n\n\nWhen in operation, all companies utilising Warehouse 52 declared bankruptcy within three years, each one claiming staff shortages. When investigated, SCP-3038 stood out as being out of place. The object does not appear on any warehouse floor plans, and while connected to an external wall, it can not be located anywhere from the building exterior. There is no record of anyone opening SCP-3038, even when clearance is given.\n\n\nCurrently, little is understood about SCP-3038, and in general progress has been unsatisfactory. While frequent, reports are often inconsistent, repetitive, and difficult to verify. Numerous experiment proposals have been granted. However, subsequent reports only contained further proposals. These proposals often stressed a need for more materials and D-class personnel in a tone implying that the initial experiment was never carried out.\n\n\nA number of hypotheses have been collated from all submitted reports. Each outlines a possible attribute of SCP-3038.\n\nSee Addendum 3038.1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.1:\u00a0Assembled\u00a0Data\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.1:\u00a0Assembled\u00a0Data\n\n\n\n\nThe following hypotheses, denoted by prefix \"Hy-\", have only circumstantial evidence to support them.\n\nThey are therefore officially considered as neither fact nor proven false.\n\n\nHy-Breakdown\n\nSCP-3038 has a permeating effect on the human psyche, brought on by prolonged exposure to the immediate surroundings of the object. Symptoms include but are not limited to memory loss, disorientation, obsessive behaviour, and erratic tendencies.\n\n\n:- Evidence includes psychology reports.\n\nThere is ongoing debate as to whether SCP-3038 directly induces mental breakdown, or if this is a by-product of other properties.\n\nResearchers are required to maintain a personal written account of their experiences to aid in psychological assessment.\n\n\nHy-Dopel\n\nSCP-3038 is capable of spawning exact duplicates of individuals following direct contact. The nature of these duplicates remains unknown, with their whereabouts unverified.\n\n\n:- Evidence includes surveillance data and personal testimony.\n\nSuch entities have yet to be encountered by security personnel.\n\n\nHy-Invasion\n\nSCP-3038 is a gateway for entities of unknown size, shape, and corporeality, referred to hereafter as SCP-3038-1. These entities are thought to be responsible for a number of disturbances including shifting of furniture, disruption of archival material, and tampering of recording equipment. There are also accounts of the antechamber being found unlocked without explanation.\n\n\n:- Evidence is limited to personal testimony.\n\nNeither Security personnel nor surveillance data has confirmed the existence of such entities.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Despite many requests for Keter reclassification of SCP-3038, the lack of evidence verifying any details regarding SCP-3038-1 means that such requests are invariably denied.\n\n\n\n\nHy-Synthesis\n\nSCP-3038 is capable of synthesising self-referential documents, both written and digital. Possibly the most concerning hypothesis as this may include any of the documents pertaining to SCP-3038 including requests, official reports, and personal accounts. If confirmed, this may explain the many inconsistencies and repetitions within the documents received so far.\n\n\nOf greater concern is that SCP-3038 may have synthesised a number of personnel files on the Foundation database. Such files are indistinguishable from authentic files, but when colleagues, friends, and family referenced therein are interviewed, they show no recognition for the subject mentioned, and are often confused and distressed by the questioning. Plans to perform database-wide searches for all synthetic personnel files are currently pending approval.\n\n\n:- Evidence includes personal testimony and independent research.\n\nIt is unknown how SCP-3038 may have gained access to Foundation databases. As a precaution all internet enabled devices are banned within and around Warehouse 52.\n\nActivity from SCP-3038-1 cannot be ruled out as a cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.2:\u00a0Personal\u00a0Account\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.2:\u00a0Personal\u00a0Account\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n What follows is a series of journal entries written by Dr. O\u2019Neil. His personal account while examining SCP-3038 remains one of the few primary sources obtained from Warehouse 52 that can be verified as authentic.\n\n\nExcerpt 001\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m worried about Dr. Patel. He\u2019s been getting worse for a while now, but the last few weeks has really put things into focus. I\u2019m still quite shocked by the depths of his fall. Dr Patel is, or at least was a world leader in trans-dimensional mechanics. When I first arrived, I admit I was a bit star struck to learn I was working under such a scientific giant.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think anything back then indicated what would happen. While always formal, he was analytical, cautious, and very understanding. He seemed to take a liking to me when we were first introduced. I thought perhaps he recognised my name from my thesis. We got to work within the first few weeks, mostly recording electromagnetic interference and such other measurements, but really we were waiting until our first arrival of D-class so we could finally see what was behind that \ndoor\n. But for whatever reason, they never arrived.\n\n\nIt all came to a head following the wire experiment. The idea was to get some plumber\u2019s wire and feed it through the keyhole to get a better idea of what lay behind it, except we couldn\u2019t find any wire at all. Dr. Bard was certain she had ordered in a whole spool of the stuff, and the store log confirmed the order, but it simply wasn\u2019t there. Thinking back, I don\u2019t think any of us recall whether the delivery had even arrived. Dr. Patel was struggling to maintain his composure but managed long enough to walk away at least.\n\n\nWhich brings me to yesterday. Before I left for the night, I saw Dr. Patel standing in the antechamber, I called out to him but he didn\u2019t seem to hear me and instead walked slowly towards the \ndoor\n. I caught him moments before he reached the handle and pulled him back. He was screaming and fighting, attracting the attention of Dr. Lu and Dr. Bard. It took all three of us to subdue the man who lay on the ground in utter hysterics, flailing his arms around wildly, giving Dr. Bard a bloody nose in the process.\n\n\nAfter he calmed down, he spoke to me candidly. He was due for psychoanalysis in a few days, and was certain he wouldn\u2019t be cleared to return. He spoke about how he was first researcher assigned to SCP-3038 \u2588\u2588 years ago, and initially he was working alone with very little support from the Foundation. Since then, nothing has progressed, and Foundation support has only been decreasing. He punched the table and screamed profanities about the Foundation, the likes of which I don\u2019t feel comfortable committing to paper. After that, he broke down into tears, calling himself a failure; that today was his last chance to finally know\u2026 something, he became difficult to understand, but the whole thing was horrifying to watch. I never thought I\u2019d see a man as great as he in such a state of utter anguish, he was like a completely different person. I sincerely hope he gets some time away from this dreary place.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 002\n\n\n\n\nToday I found myself standing in the antechamber with no clue as to why I was there. Entering the antechamber is always a surreal experience. The first time, I felt a strange sense of foreboding as I got close to the door. That\u2019s the antechamber door rather than the \ndoor\n door, the SCP door. Getting near the \ndoor\n door was something else entirely. I could feel pressure in the back of my neck, and as I got closer I felt all the teeth in my mouth vibrate. Dr. Bard assured me that this sort of thing is pretty normal and isn\u2019t dangerous, though I\u2019m not so sure. These days I\u2019d often hear a low pitched rumble or murmur, but I assumed that was normal too so I didn\u2019t question it.\n\n\nThis recent event was new, however. I could remember opening the antechamber door, and stepping in, but I was out of breath and could feel a sense of panic in my lungs, and as I stared at the \ndoor\n ahead of me\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t figure out what I was doing here. The only thing in my hands was the card key. Dr. Bard put it down to overworking. She told me she\u2019s had many experiences like this, and that I should not think too hard on it. But it didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\n\nI thought the cameras might have captured something, so I spoke with Andy. The software for managing the video and audio stuff is a nightmare to work with, utterly inadequate, incredibly prone to slowdown and freezing, heck, there isn\u2019t even a live feed option. Andy just knows how to work it. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do without him; but even with his help, it\u2019s still a monotonous slog of a task.\n\n\nAfter a few hours, he found something. Moments before I entered the antechamber, there was a figure standing right there in the middle of the room, they slowly walked right up to the \ndoor\n, paused, and looked directly at the camera, at us. Playback stuttered for several seconds, and when it was restored, the figure was gone. Excited, we showed the others. Dr. Bard was convinced this was proof of entities on the other side of the \ndoor\n. We immediately sent out a request for D-class to attempt communication with them. Perhaps now we have some proof the Foundation will be a bit more willing to grant our request.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 003\n\n\n\n\nThe psych session did not go well. They were not happy when I said that all of us had begun sleeping in the warehouse. I tried to explain it was the only way to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anything. But it was like arguing with a rock. Psychologists aren\u2019t real scientists, they wouldn\u2019t understand how essential it is to be there, to catch this sort of thing in its essence.\n\n\nWhile waiting for the Foundation to get back to us, I\u2019ve been helping Dr. Lu sort through the archived files. Well, they\u2019re not so much files as a couple shelves worth of disorganised mess piled on top of itself, but it still needs to be gone through all the same. She\u2019s been mainly focusing on sorting the real documents, that is, the ones we know were written by real people, from the synthetic ones.\n\n\nDr. Lu has a system where she divides synthetic documents into two categories. The first are the \u201cPure synthetic\u201d, authored by completely synthetic sources. The second are the \u201cTemplated synthetic\u201d which copy the style and substance of real documents. To illustrate, she showed me two journals, the first her own, the second a templated synthetic. The handwriting was identical between them, but the synthetic one kept making references to a \u201cDr. Sun\u201d who, by this account, was heavily involved in Dr. Lu\u2019s work prior to my arrival. There wasn\u2019t anything about a Dr. Sun in the brief I was given, and Dr. Lu was certain no one named Dr. Sun had any involvement with SCP-3038 at any point. She pulled a number of Pure synthetics from table and sure enough, this Dr. Sun character was a frequent presence in all of them.\n\n\nI asked her where she found this templated synthetic journal. Eventually she pointed somewhere on the shelf, saying that there were a lot of synthetics in the pile. I\u2019ve yet to find any journals with my handwriting, but that might be because I never put this journal down. It\u2019s always either in my pocket or in my hand.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 004\n\n\n\n\nI woke with a start last night to a loud slamming sound. I went over to investigate and found the antechamber door wide open. I raised the alarm and security came in to search the area while the three of us waited for the all clear. This took a lot longer than it should have however.\n\n\nThey said they wanted to know where the \u201cothers\u201d were. Apparently their register had a total of 7 names signed in. We examined the list and noticed several problems with it. For one, Dr. Sun\u2019s name was listed close to the top, for another, my own name, Dr. O\u2019Neil, was listed twice with different initials. Dr. Bard took one look at the rest of it and scoffed, she had not heard of any of these people, and she\u2019s been here the longest out of all of us. The register was clearly a fake, perhaps even an example of incomplete template synthesis.\n\n\nWhen pressed, not even the security guards could really say they knew who these other names were or even recalled them ever signing in. We asked for details on where they kept the list, but they refused to tell us.\n\n\nIn the end, security was unable to find anything. Despite this Dr. Bard was convinced we had a containment breach, as was I. Dr. Lu may be less certain, citing something she read in the archive, but how else do you explain an open cell? While Dr. Bard wrote out an incident report, I took a look at the footage, but stopped when I saw what was on the screen. Two figures, one standing stock still in the middle of the room with a turban on their head. Walking to their side was someone that looked like\u2026me? It was me, or at least, it looked like me. I, or it, was holding what appeared to be a long metal wire, but I don\u2019t remember this moment, no, this couldn\u2019t have been me, this never happened. Was this another kind of synthetic?\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 005\n\n\n\n\nI found Dr. Lu making a very elaborate diagram. She said she had discovered something in the archives, that it made something click in her mind and that we all had to read it. Dr. Bard brushed it off but I humoured her. After what happened, I welcomed the distraction. It was another synthetic journal, most likely Pure. The tell-tale Dr. Sun made an appearance, but there was something about the entries that made it more\u2026difficult to dismiss?\n\n\nThe events they wrote were startlingly similar to our own, from requests to D-class being ignored to the strange \u2018Breach-like\u2019 events. At a personal level, there was something about the writing that felt oddly familiar. I also noticed they had signed every entry with \u201c-Mike\u201d. As I re-read it, I noticed that Dr. Sun was mentioned frequently in the early entries, but after a certain point, all reference to them had stopped. I managed to pinpoint the exact entry they were last mentioned. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nI knew there was something significant about this date, so I searched through our video records, and found something. Two humanoid figures were standing in the antechamber. One of them was the same figure in the turban I had seen before, the second one, however, looked strangely like me, but different. They were bald and had stubble, but their face looked so much like mine, almost like an inexact copy. They were joined by a third figure who I didn\u2019t recognise at all. This tall figure looked like they were directing the actions of the other two, but then something happened, there was a dispute? It looked like a struggle was about to take place, but the camera froze before I could see what happened.\n\n\nI can\u2019t express enough how frustrating this software is. I couldn\u2019t even find the audio which accompanied the footage, making it really difficult to even guess as to what was going on. You\u2019d think the Foundation would have the budget for less terrible equipment, or at the very least assign a technician to go through it for us, but no. I guess that shows how much contempt they really hold for us.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 006\n\n\n\n\nThere was another incident today. I\u2019m not sure if I could call it a breach, but Dr. Bard certainly does. The area was in utter chaos. The archive was strewn across the floor, some of the books lay half open with piles of reports all over the place. Even stranger was the crazed writing on the wall. It almost looked like a conspiracy theorist\u2019s whiteboard, but on glass. Most unnerving was the only sentence written backwards on the inside of the glass, as though it was specifically for us. It read \u201cRemember The Lost\u201d.\n\n\nDr. Bard looked just as on edge as I felt. She began hurriedly writing a number of requests for extra security personnel for the inside of the building. The cameras were useless, all either misaligned or out of focus, probably tampered with by whatever did all this. Perhaps it was still here with us, watching us from the shadows\u2026 I don\u2019t care what security says, just because they couldn\u2019t find anything doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing to find. The worst part is that the antechamber door was left untouched, and something wrote on both sides of the glass. I thought about the thing that looked like me from the video\u2026 Did that have something to do with this?\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 007\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m worried about Dr. Bard. She has taken to walking around the facility with a knife. I tried to bring up what I saw in the video with her, thinking it could give her something different to focus on, but now I think that was a mistake. She started looking at me strangely and demanded to know why I only just now informed her. As she got closer, the knife in her hand flashed my eyes and I started to back away. She must have seen how terrified I was because she calmed down and apologised.\n\n\nI decided not to write an incident report for the behaviour. She was at breaking point after all. We both were. It must have been the letter from the Foundation that pushed her over, I know it pissed me off when I read it. They said they were denying our requests for enhanced security, that we had exceeded our request allowance for D-class personnel, and then generally complained about our lack of progress overall. I still can\u2019t believe it. They never sent us any D-class and have barely supported us as it is! What the hell do they expect from us? Do those bastards even read the reports we send them?\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 008\n\n\n\n\nDr. Connor O\u2019Neil\u2019s log, Date: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nMajor events: I found myself in the antechamber opposite SCP-3038, a trail of blood leading from the centre of the room towards the object. A knife discarded by the entrance with blood clearly dripping from the blade. However, I myself only sustained mild non-life threatening injuries.\n\n\nComments: I have trouble recalling what happened moments before this event. I have slight memories of screaming, a woman\u2019s voice, a struggle, but nothing more. The noise from SCP-3038 has changed, amongst the murmur there was also a high pitched cry. The longer I listened the louder these noises become until it all resembled white noise. Security personnel brought me out of the antechamber and towards an on-site medical bay, where I write this now.\n\nEnd log.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt 009\n\n\n\n\nI have been advised by the psychologist to write out everything that that\u2019s going through my head. The first thing they asked me was \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Probably the single most useless question you could ask anyone. Isn\u2019t it your job to already know how I feel? How would you feel if you just spent eight months cooped up in a warehouse working on a research project with no support, and no one but a few guards around for company!? Here\u2019s how I feel. I feel like you\u2019re a complete idiot! And what the hell was the point of this log book anyway if it\u2019s not an official report? Is it just for you psych people to peek into our lives?\n\n\nI\u2019ve, just read through this log book and\u2026 it\u2019s not actually a log book at all. It\u2019s a journal? This doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 there weren\u2019t any other researchers in that warehouse, only me. But it did have very accurate details, I remember the reports, the refused requests, the breaches and the videos. All of that happened, but I was alone. I mean who the heck is Dr. Patel!? This book reads like one of those synthetic journals from the archives. Perhaps I picked it up by mistake? But the writing, it\u2019s undeniably mine. When I trace the letters with a pen I can even remember writing them, but the content feels so synthetic. I know I wrote these entries. But they\u2019re not real? What about this, the words I\u2019m writing now? They are real, they must be. This is Real, This is REAL. But the moment I stop writing, will it still be real? Will it become synthetic? Another template? Was there another me out there who remembers these events? Are my memories synthetic? No, as I write I prove I am real. I know that. My name is \nConnor O\u2019Neil\n \nNeil O\u2019Connor\n, Connor O\u2019Neil. Which one was it? When did my name feel so distant? Are neither real? But I know that I am real, I am not synthetic. I know that. I know\u2026 I just know.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of excerpts\n\n\nComments:\n In light of these accounts, the special containment procedure of SCP-3038 is currently under review. All personnel assigned to SCP-3038 must be alert for any and all pending updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.3:\u00a0Supporting\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a03038.3:\u00a0Supporting\u00a0Footage\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Following reception of Dr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s personal account, the visual and audio data acquired in Warehouse 52 has been analysed for corroborating evidence. What follows is a transcript of the video with synced up audio depicting that described in Addendum 3038.2-E-005.\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Video\n>\n\n\nCamera is centred on the door of the antechamber, through the glass two figures are seen walking towards the door, opening it, and stepping inside. On the left is a male of Indian descent wearing a turban, referred to here as Subject 1. On the right is a male Caucasian with a bald head and short beard, referred to here as Subject 2.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n With hope, this time we should get some answers Dr. O\u2019Neil.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Yes, and please, must we be so formal? You can call me Mike.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I prefer to remain as professional as possible while working, and encourage all my staff to do so, if you don\u2019t mind Dr. O\u2019Neil.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n No\u2026 of course Dr. Patel. I apologise.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n Now then, let us begin.\n\n\nThe visual changes to a different camera, the perspective is now looking straight at SCP-3038 while both Subject 1 and 2 approach holding a large spool of wire.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I want you to feed this through the keyhole. We\u2019ll make a mark along the wire if we hit something.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Seems a bit basic, wouldn\u2019t this have been tried by now, Dr. Patel?\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I thought so too.\n\n\nSubject 2 takes the wire and starts to push it through the keyhole of SCP-3038. As it enters, interference appears on both video and audio feeds, presenting in static around the corners of the video, and crackling in the recording. Subject 2 does not stop feeding the wire through.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n How is it going.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Nothing yet, it\u2019s like it\u2019s just falling into a void.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n That in itself could be very interesting.\n\n\nThe Antechamber door is heard opening, another male, tall, East Asian, referred to here as Subject 3, enters the frame.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n Good evening Dr. Sun.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Evening.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n We are currently carrying out the wire test as discussed.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Finally. This test has been a long time coming. Dr. O\u2019Neil is it?\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Yes, good evening Dr. Sun.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n I hear congratulations are in order.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n They are?\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Well, it\u2019s not very often that family members are accepted into the Foundation, and in the same field as yourself, you must be proud.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Yes, thank you Dr. Sun.\n\n\nSubject 2 continues to feed the wire through until he is almost at the end.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n Ok Dr. O\u2019Neil, that\u2019s enough, bring it back.\n\n\nSubject 2 begins to pull the wire but it resists.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n It\u2019s stuck\u2026\n\n\nSubject 1:\n Stuck? Did you hit something?\n\n\nSubject 2:\n I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like something is pulling on it.\n\n\nSubject 1 moves to help Subject 2 in pulling the wire out from SCP-3038. They lose their grip and the wire disappears into the keyhole. The static and crackling intensifies as this happens, the video freezes for a couple of frames. When restored, Subject 2 is seen on the floor.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n What are you doing down there?\n\n\nSubject 2:\n I\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I must have fallen.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Well get up, this is no time for a lie-down.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Sorry Dr. Sun, of course.\n\n\nSubject 2 gets to their feet while Subject 3 addresses Subject 1\n\n\nSubject 3:\n And where\u2019s the wire?\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I asked Dr. O\u2019Neil here to retrieve it.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n And?\n\n\nSubject 2:\n I\u2026 well\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Well? Where is it?\n\n\nSubject 2:\n I must have forgotten it.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Forgotten it!? Then go get it! Now!\n\n\nSubject 2:\n I\u2019m sorry Dr. Sun.\n\n\nSubject 2 hastily runs out of the room. Subject\u2019s 1 and 3 do not act until Subject 2 returns.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n It\u2019s uh\u2026 It\u2019s not here, Dr. Sun.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Dr. Patel! I thought you said a new supply had arrived.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I thought it did\u2026 but I can\u2019t remember seeing it.\n\n\nSubject 2:\n Neither I. And I just checked, it\u2019s not where it would be if it was.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n So what are the two of you doing here then!?\n\n\nSubject 1:\n I\u2026 uh\u2026 hmm.\n\n\nSubject 3 becomes noticeably more angered by the lack of response from the other two subjects.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Dr. O\u2019Neil.

Show these D-Class subjects to me. How many times have we made requests for D-Class only to be ignored? I\u2019m tired of waiting Dr. Patel, I\u2019m tired of admin breathing down my neck on our lack of results. We\u2019re sorting this out today. Dr. O\u2019Neil, proceed.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n You don\u2019t have to do this.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Proceed!\n\n\nThe room is silent for a moment with neither subject making any movement.\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Fine! If you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll just do it myself.\n\n\nSubject 1:\n Dr. Sun, you can\u2019t!\n\n\nSubject 3:\n Let go of me!\n\n\nSubject 1 grabs on to Subject 3 while Subject 2 attempts to get close to Subject 3. Subject 3 breaks free of Subject 1\u2019s grasp, walks towards SCP-3038 and reaches for the handle as Subject 1 reaches out to prevent them.

        "I\u2019m worried about Dr. Patel. He\u2019s been getting worse for a while now, but the last few weeks has really put things into focus. I\u2019m still quite shocked by the depths of his fall. Dr Patel is, or at least was a world leader in trans-dimensional mechanics. When I first arrived, I admit I was a bit star struck to learn I was working under such a scientific giant. I don\u2019t think anything back then indicated what would happen. While always formal, he was analytical, cautious, and very understanding. He seemed to take a liking to me when we were first introduced. I thought perhaps he recognised my name from my thesis. We got to work within the first few weeks, mostly recording electromagnetic interference and such other measurements, but really we were waiting until our first arrival of D-class so we could finally see what was behind that door . But for whatever reason, they never arrived. It all came to a head following the wire experiment. The idea was to get some plumber\u2019s wire and feed it through the keyhole to get a better idea of what lay behind it, except we couldn\u2019t find any wire at all. Dr. Bard was certain she had ordered in a whole spool of the stuff, and the store log confirmed the order, but it simply wasn\u2019t there. Thinking back, I don\u2019t think any of us recall whether the delivery had even arrived. Dr. Patel was struggling to maintain his composure but managed long enough to walk away at least. Which brings me to yesterday. Before I left for the night, I saw Dr. Patel standing in the antechamber, I called out to him but he didn\u2019t seem to hear me and instead walked slowly towards the door . I caught him moments before he reached the handle and pulled him back. He was screaming and fighting, attracting the attention of Dr. Lu and Dr. Bard. It took all three of us to subdue the man who lay on the ground in utter hysterics, flailing his arms around wildly, giving Dr. Bard a bloody nose in the process. After he calmed down, he spoke to me candidly. He was due for psychoanalysis in a few days, and was certain he wouldn\u2019t be cleared to return. He spoke about how he was first researcher assigned to SCP-3038 \u2588\u2588 years ago, and initially he was working alone with very little support from the Foundation. Since then, nothing has progressed, and Foundation support has only been decreasing. He punched the table and screamed profanities about the Foundation, the likes of which I don\u2019t feel comfortable committing to paper. After that, he broke down into tears, calling himself a failure; that today was his last chance to finally know\u2026 something, he became difficult to understand, but the whole thing was horrifying to watch. I never thought I\u2019d see a man as great as he in such a state of utter anguish, he was like a completely different person. I sincerely hope he gets some time away from this dreary place.",
        "Today I found myself standing in the antechamber with no clue as to why I was there. Entering the antechamber is always a surreal experience. The first time, I felt a strange sense of foreboding as I got close to the door. That\u2019s the antechamber door rather than the door door, the SCP door. Getting near the door door was something else entirely. I could feel pressure in the back of my neck, and as I got closer I felt all the teeth in my mouth vibrate. Dr. Bard assured me that this sort of thing is pretty normal and isn\u2019t dangerous, though I\u2019m not so sure. These days I\u2019d often hear a low pitched rumble or murmur, but I assumed that was normal too so I didn\u2019t question it. This recent event was new, however. I could remember opening the antechamber door, and stepping in, but I was out of breath and could feel a sense of panic in my lungs, and as I stared at the door ahead of me\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t figure out what I was doing here. The only thing in my hands was the card key. Dr. Bard put it down to overworking. She told me she\u2019s had many experiences like this, and that I should not think too hard on it. But it didn\u2019t sit right with me. I thought the cameras might have captured something, so I spoke with Andy. The software for managing the video and audio stuff is a nightmare to work with, utterly inadequate, incredibly prone to slowdown and freezing, heck, there isn\u2019t even a live feed option. Andy just knows how to work it. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do without him; but even with his help, it\u2019s still a monotonous slog of a task. After a few hours, he found something. Moments before I entered the antechamber, there was a figure standing right there in the middle of the room, they slowly walked right up to the door , paused, and looked directly at the camera, at us. Playback stuttered for several seconds, and when it was restored, the figure was gone. Excited, we showed the others. Dr. Bard was convinced this was proof of entities on the other side of the door . We immediately sent out a request for D-class to attempt communication with them. Perhaps now we have some proof the Foundation will be a bit more willing to grant our request.",
        "The psych session did not go well. They were not happy when I said that all of us had begun sleeping in the warehouse. I tried to explain it was the only way to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anything. But it was like arguing with a rock. Psychologists aren\u2019t real scientists, they wouldn\u2019t understand how essential it is to be there, to catch this sort of thing in its essence. While waiting for the Foundation to get back to us, I\u2019ve been helping Dr. Lu sort through the archived files. Well, they\u2019re not so much files as a couple shelves worth of disorganised mess piled on top of itself, but it still needs to be gone through all the same. She\u2019s been mainly focusing on sorting the real documents, that is, the ones we know were written by real people, from the synthetic ones. Dr. Lu has a system where she divides synthetic documents into two categories. The first are the \u201cPure synthetic\u201d, authored by completely synthetic sources. The second are the \u201cTemplated synthetic\u201d which copy the style and substance of real documents. To illustrate, she showed me two journals, the first her own, the second a templated synthetic. The handwriting was identical between them, but the synthetic one kept making references to a \u201cDr. Sun\u201d who, by this account, was heavily involved in Dr. Lu\u2019s work prior to my arrival. There wasn\u2019t anything about a Dr. Sun in the brief I was given, and Dr. Lu was certain no one named Dr. Sun had any involvement with SCP-3038 at any point. She pulled a number of Pure synthetics from table and sure enough, this Dr. Sun character was a frequent presence in all of them. I asked her where she found this templated synthetic journal. Eventually she pointed somewhere on the shelf, saying that there were a lot of synthetics in the pile. I\u2019ve yet to find any journals with my handwriting, but that might be because I never put this journal down. It\u2019s always either in my pocket or in my hand.",
        "I woke with a start last night to a loud slamming sound. I went over to investigate and found the antechamber door wide open. I raised the alarm and security came in to search the area while the three of us waited for the all clear. This took a lot longer than it should have however. They said they wanted to know where the \u201cothers\u201d were. Apparently their register had a total of 7 names signed in. We examined the list and noticed several problems with it. For one, Dr. Sun\u2019s name was listed close to the top, for another, my own name, Dr. O\u2019Neil, was listed twice with different initials. Dr. Bard took one look at the rest of it and scoffed, she had not heard of any of these people, and she\u2019s been here the longest out of all of us. The register was clearly a fake, perhaps even an example of incomplete template synthesis. When pressed, not even the security guards could really say they knew who these other names were or even recalled them ever signing in. We asked for details on where they kept the list, but they refused to tell us. In the end, security was unable to find anything. Despite this Dr. Bard was convinced we had a containment breach, as was I. Dr. Lu may be less certain, citing something she read in the archive, but how else do you explain an open cell? While Dr. Bard wrote out an incident report, I took a look at the footage, but stopped when I saw what was on the screen. Two figures, one standing stock still in the middle of the room with a turban on their head. Walking to their side was someone that looked like\u2026me? It was me, or at least, it looked like me. I, or it, was holding what appeared to be a long metal wire, but I don\u2019t remember this moment, no, this couldn\u2019t have been me, this never happened. Was this another kind of synthetic?",
        "I found Dr. Lu making a very elaborate diagram. She said she had discovered something in the archives, that it made something click in her mind and that we all had to read it. Dr. Bard brushed it off but I humoured her. After what happened, I welcomed the distraction. It was another synthetic journal, most likely Pure. The tell-tale Dr. Sun made an appearance, but there was something about the entries that made it more\u2026difficult to dismiss? The events they wrote were startlingly similar to our own, from requests to D-class being ignored to the strange \u2018Breach-like\u2019 events. At a personal level, there was something about the writing that felt oddly familiar. I also noticed they had signed every entry with \u201c-Mike\u201d. As I re-read it, I noticed that Dr. Sun was mentioned frequently in the early entries, but after a certain point, all reference to them had stopped. I managed to pinpoint the exact entry they were last mentioned. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I knew there was something significant about this date, so I searched through our video records, and found something. Two humanoid figures were standing in the antechamber. One of them was the same figure in the turban I had seen before, the second one, however, looked strangely like me, but different. They were bald and had stubble, but their face looked so much like mine, almost like an inexact copy. They were joined by a third figure who I didn\u2019t recognise at all. This tall figure looked like they were directing the actions of the other two, but then something happened, there was a dispute? It looked like a struggle was about to take place, but the camera froze before I could see what happened. I can\u2019t express enough how frustrating this software is. I couldn\u2019t even find the audio which accompanied the footage, making it really difficult to even guess as to what was going on. You\u2019d think the Foundation would have the budget for less terrible equipment, or at the very least assign a technician to go through it for us, but no. I guess that shows how much contempt they really hold for us.",
        "There was another incident today. I\u2019m not sure if I could call it a breach, but Dr. Bard certainly does. The area was in utter chaos. The archive was strewn across the floor, some of the books lay half open with piles of reports all over the place. Even stranger was the crazed writing on the wall. It almost looked like a conspiracy theorist\u2019s whiteboard, but on glass. Most unnerving was the only sentence written backwards on the inside of the glass, as though it was specifically for us. It read \u201cRemember The Lost\u201d. Dr. Bard looked just as on edge as I felt. She began hurriedly writing a number of requests for extra security personnel for the inside of the building. The cameras were useless, all either misaligned or out of focus, probably tampered with by whatever did all this. Perhaps it was still here with us, watching us from the shadows\u2026 I don\u2019t care what security says, just because they couldn\u2019t find anything doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing to find. The worst part is that the antechamber door was left untouched, and something wrote on both sides of the glass. I thought about the thing that looked like me from the video\u2026 Did that have something to do with this?",
        "I\u2019m worried about Dr. Bard. She has taken to walking around the facility with a knife. I tried to bring up what I saw in the video with her, thinking it could give her something different to focus on, but now I think that was a mistake. She started looking at me strangely and demanded to know why I only just now informed her. As she got closer, the knife in her hand flashed my eyes and I started to back away. She must have seen how terrified I was because she calmed down and apologised. I decided not to write an incident report for the behaviour. She was at breaking point after all. We both were. It must have been the letter from the Foundation that pushed her over, I know it pissed me off when I read it. They said they were denying our requests for enhanced security, that we had exceeded our request allowance for D-class personnel, and then generally complained about our lack of progress overall. I still can\u2019t believe it. They never sent us any D-class and have barely supported us as it is! What the hell do they expect from us? Do those bastards even read the reports we send them?",
        "Dr. Connor O\u2019Neil\u2019s log, Date: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Major events: I found myself in the antechamber opposite SCP-3038, a trail of blood leading from the centre of the room towards the object. A knife discarded by the entrance with blood clearly dripping from the blade. However, I myself only sustained mild non-life threatening injuries. Comments: I have trouble recalling what happened moments before this event. I have slight memories of screaming, a woman\u2019s voice, a struggle, but nothing more. The noise from SCP-3038 has changed, amongst the murmur there was also a high pitched cry. The longer I listened the louder these noises become until it all resembled white noise. Security personnel brought me out of the antechamber and towards an on-site medical bay, where I write this now. End log.",
        "I have been advised by the psychologist to write out everything that that\u2019s going through my head. The first thing they asked me was \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Probably the single most useless question you could ask anyone. Isn\u2019t it your job to already know how I feel? How would you feel if you just spent eight months cooped up in a warehouse working on a research project with no support, and no one but a few guards around for company!? Here\u2019s how I feel. I feel like you\u2019re a complete idiot! And what the hell was the point of this log book anyway if it\u2019s not an official report? Is it just for you psych people to peek into our lives? I\u2019ve, just read through this log book and\u2026 it\u2019s not actually a log book at all. It\u2019s a journal? This doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 there weren\u2019t any other researchers in that warehouse, only me. But it did have very accurate details, I remember the reports, the refused requests, the breaches and the videos. All of that happened, but I was alone. I mean who the heck is Dr. Patel!? This book reads like one of those synthetic journals from the archives. Perhaps I picked it up by mistake? But the writing, it\u2019s undeniably mine. When I trace the letters with a pen I can even remember writing them, but the content feels so synthetic. I know I wrote these entries. But they\u2019re not real? What about this, the words I\u2019m writing now? They are real, they must be. This is Real, This is REAL. But the moment I stop writing, will it still be real? Will it become synthetic? Another template? Was there another me out there who remembers these events? Are my memories synthetic? No, as I write I prove I am real. I know that. My name is Connor O\u2019Neil Neil O\u2019Connor , Connor O\u2019Neil. Which one was it? When did my name feel so distant? Are neither real? But I know that I am real, I am not synthetic. I know that. I know\u2026 I just know.",
        "< Begin Video > Camera is centred on the door of the antechamber, through the glass two figures are seen walking towards the door, opening it, and stepping inside. On the left is a male of Indian descent wearing a turban, referred to here as Subject 1. On the right is a male Caucasian with a bald head and short beard, referred to here as Subject 2. Subject 1: With hope, this time we should get some answers Dr. O\u2019Neil. Subject 2: Yes, and please, must we be so formal? You can call me Mike. Subject 1: I prefer to remain as professional as possible while working, and encourage all my staff to do so, if you don\u2019t mind Dr. O\u2019Neil. Subject 2: No\u2026 of course Dr. Patel. I apologise. Subject 1: Now then, let us begin. The visual changes to a different camera, the perspective is now looking straight at SCP-3038 while both Subject 1 and 2 approach holding a large spool of wire. Subject 1: I want you to feed this through the keyhole. We\u2019ll make a mark along the wire if we hit something. Subject 2: Seems a bit basic, wouldn\u2019t this have been tried by now, Dr. Patel? Subject 1: I thought so too. Subject 2 takes the wire and starts to push it through the keyhole of SCP-3038. As it enters, interference appears on both video and audio feeds, presenting in static around the corners of the video, and crackling in the recording. Subject 2 does not stop feeding the wire through. Subject 1: How is it going. Subject 2: Nothing yet, it\u2019s like it\u2019s just falling into a void. Subject 1: That in itself could be very interesting. The Antechamber door is heard opening, another male, tall, East Asian, referred to here as Subject 3, enters the frame. Subject 1: Good evening Dr. Sun. Subject 3: Evening. Subject 1: We are currently carrying out the wire test as discussed. Subject 3: Finally. This test has been a long time coming. Dr. O\u2019Neil is it? Subject 2: Yes, good evening Dr. Sun. Subject 3: I hear congratulations are in order. Subject 2: They are? Subject 3: Well, it\u2019s not very often that family members are accepted into the Foundation, and in the same field as yourself, you must be proud. Subject 2: Yes, thank you Dr. Sun. Subject 2 continues to feed the wire through until he is almost at the end. Subject 1: Ok Dr. O\u2019Neil, that\u2019s enough, bring it back. Subject 2 begins to pull the wire but it resists. Subject 2: It\u2019s stuck\u2026 Subject 1: Stuck? Did you hit something? Subject 2: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like something is pulling on it. Subject 1 moves to help Subject 2 in pulling the wire out from SCP-3038. They lose their grip and the wire disappears into the keyhole. The static and crackling intensifies as this happens, the video freezes for a couple of frames. When restored, Subject 2 is seen on the floor. Subject 3: What are you doing down there? Subject 2: I\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I must have fallen. Subject 3: Well get up, this is no time for a lie-down. Subject 2: Sorry Dr. Sun, of course. Subject 2 gets to their feet while Subject 3 addresses Subject 1 Subject 3: And where\u2019s the wire? Subject 1: I asked Dr. O\u2019Neil here to retrieve it. Subject 3: And? Subject 2: I\u2026 well Subject 3: Well? Where is it? Subject 2: I must have forgotten it. Subject 3: Forgotten it!? Then go get it! Now! Subject 2: I\u2019m sorry Dr. Sun. Subject 2 hastily runs out of the room. Subject\u2019s 1 and 3 do not act until Subject 2 returns. Subject 2: It\u2019s uh\u2026 It\u2019s not here, Dr. Sun. Subject 3: Dr. Patel! I thought you said a new supply had arrived. Subject 1: I thought it did\u2026 but I can\u2019t remember seeing it. Subject 2: Neither I. And I just checked, it\u2019s not where it would be if it was. Subject 3: So what are the two of you doing here then!? Subject 1: I\u2026 uh\u2026 hmm. Subject 3 becomes noticeably more angered by the lack of response from the other two subjects. Subject 3: Dr. O\u2019Neil. Step in front of the object. Subject 2: What? Subject 3: That\u2019s an order. Step in front of the object. We are going to find out what is behind this thing once and for all. Subject 1: Dr. Sun, with all due respect, you cannot order your staff like this. Subject 3: Do you challenge my authority Dr. Patel? Subject 1: I challenge nothing; merely remind you that this kind of test are why we have D-Class subjects. Subject 3: And where are they then? Show these D-Class subjects to me. How many times have we made requests for D-Class only to be ignored? I\u2019m tired of waiting Dr. Patel, I\u2019m tired of admin breathing down my neck on our lack of results. We\u2019re sorting this out today. Dr. O\u2019Neil, proceed. Subject 1: You don\u2019t have to do this. Subject 3: Proceed! The room is silent for a moment with neither subject making any movement. Subject 3: Fine! If you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll just do it myself. Subject 1: Dr. Sun, you can\u2019t! Subject 3: Let go of me! Subject 1 grabs on to Subject 3 while Subject 2 attempts to get close to Subject 3. Subject 3 breaks free of Subject 1\u2019s grasp, walks towards SCP-3038 and reaches for the handle as Subject 1 reaches out to prevent them. The video freezes for about 15 seconds, during which time nothing but static plays on the audio. Once the video restores, only Subject 1 and 2 are visible. SCP-3038 seems to remain untouched. Subject 2: Dr. Patel? What are you doing? Subject 1 looks at their outstretched hands Subject 1: I\u2026 must have been trying to measure SCP-3038 Subject 2: Measure it? But we have none of our tools here. Subject 1 looks around Subject 1: That appears to be so\u2026 Did you not bring anything? Subject 2: I didn\u2019t\u2026 I suppose I thought you would bring them? Subject 1: I see\u2026 we must have forgotten. Both Subject 1 and 2 are seen walking away from SCP-3038. Subject 1: Make a note, if this becomes a recurring phenomenon, it might be an effect of close proximity to SCP-3038 Subject 2: Yes Dr. Patel. Subject 1: By the way, I heard somewhere that congratulations are in order. Subject 2: Why is that? Subject 1: I\u2019m not too sure\u2026 something to do with family I think. The sound of the antechamber door is heard opening and closing off-screen. The antechamber falls to silence. < End of video >",
