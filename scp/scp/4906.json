Foundation Site-4906, located on Yuzhny Island, Russian Federation, powers a solenoid of magnetic flux density 1.072 tesla to augment the magnetic flux density of SCP-4906-North. Should Event-4906-\u042e\u0433 recur, Mobile Task Force Sigma-58 \"Turkey Shooters\" shall reverse the polarity of Site-4906's solenoid in order to trigger Event-4906-\u5317. Once Event-4906-\u5317 is complete, MTF Sigma-58 shall return Site-4906 to normal operation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4906 consists of three parts: SCP-4906-Omicron, an anomalous organism; and SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South, a pair of magnetic anomalies. Current understanding is SCP-4906-Omicron keeps the anomalous properties of SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South localized to a radius of 50.37m. Prior to containment, SCP-4906-Omicron performs regular migrations between SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South. These migrations are designated Event-4906-\u042e\u0433 and Event-4906-\u5317, and are related to the weakening of the magnetic flux density of SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South.\n\n\nSCP-4906-Omicron appears to be a \nMegaptera novaeangliae\n (humpback whale) specimen, 70158.7\u00a0m in length from nose to tail. SCP-4906-Omicron is currently submerged and completely inert. Biopsies of SCP-4906-Omicron has yielded DNA of two species, \nMegaptera novaeangliae\n (humpback whale) and \nFalco amurensis\n (Amur falcon).\n\n\nSCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South are a pair of geomagnetic anomalies which form a dipole with an estimated magnetic flux density of 2.317 tesla (about 36,000 to 93,000 times the strength of Earth's magnetic field). Through an unknown mechanism, SCP-4906-Omicron has limited the anomalies' effect to a radius of 50.37m. The rapid ionization of seawater from SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South's magnetic forces creates severe weather patterns in their respective areas.\n\n\nSCP-4906-North is located at 74.311, 50.074, at a depth of 47.13\u00a0km which is a point in the Barents Sea, and is located 150.00\u00a0km away from the shore of Yuzhny Island, Russian Federation.\n\n\nSCP-4906-South is located at 24.435, 133.191, at a depth of 47.13\u00a0km which is a point in the Philippine Sea, and is not located within 250\u00a0km of any significant landmass.\n\n\nEvent-4906-\u042e\u0433\n triggers when storms with wind speed exceeding 131\u00a0km/h approach SCP-4906-North. SCP-4906-North's magnetic flux density will drop to 1.246 tesla over a period of 52 minutes. Simultaneously, SCP-4906-Omicron transforms into what appears to be a large specimen of the \nFalco\n genus (falcon), growing large wings as its fins reshape into legs and claws, and its skin begins to grow metallic, dart-like feathers. The wingspan has been estimated to be in excess of 70km.\n\n\nAfter SCP-4906-Omicron transforms, the Barents Sea cavitates at the location of SCP-4906-North, rapidly forming walls of water that are over 100\u00a0km in length. SCP-4906-Omicron would then take flight and rise to an orbit of 3000\u00a0km from sea level. It then follows the orthodromic path to the location of SCP-4906-South. SCP-4906-Omicron sends regular pulses in the Earth's magnetic field while in flight. The meanings of these pulses, if any, are unknown. SCP-4906-Omicron returns to its original form once completely submerged in seawater. The entire process takes about 93 days.\n\n\nNotably, occurrences of Event-4906-\u042e\u0433 are tied to significant Foundation losses within the Soviet Union. There is currently insufficient evidence on causality between the events and the losses.\n1\n\n\nEvent-4906-\u5317\n occurs in the same manner as Event-4906-\u042e\u0433, but with the origin being SCP-4906-South and the destination being SCP-4906-North. Occurrences of Event-4906-\u5317 are tied to significant Foundation losses within the United States.\n\n\nEvent Log 4906\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\u042e\u0433\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nJune 1st, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation researchers inadvertently witnessed the event while conducting a routine expedition to the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss Date\n\n\nJune 13th, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4 Agent Genrikh Lyushkov\n2\n defected to the Japanese Empire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasualties\n\n\n1 Foundation casualty, 76,928 non-Foundation casualties\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes and Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log-4906-\u042e\u0433-1945\n\n\nDate:\n August 20th, 1945\n\n\nLocation:\n Imperial Japanese Intelligence Office, Dalian, China\n\n\nSubject:\n Defector Genrikh Lyushkov\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Takeoka Yutaka, Level 2 Agent\n4\n\n\n\n\nLyushov\n: Gentlemen, I understand what you're here for.\n\n\n\n\nTakeoka\n: Genrikh, please have a seat.\n\n\n\n\nLyushkov\n: I can still be of service if you allow me to go to America.\n\n\n\n\nTakeoka\n: Please leave us, [IJA Soldier], I would like to talk to General Lyushkov personally.\n\n\n\n\n[IJA Soldier]\n: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n\nTakeoka\n: Genrikh, I can get you to America if you answer some questions, but you absolutely must tell the truth.\n\n\n\n\nLyushkov\n: I will.\n\n\n\n\nTakeoka\n: Why did you betray us?\n\n\n\n\nLyushkov\n: I never betrayed the Empire!
