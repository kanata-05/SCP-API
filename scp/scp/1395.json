A barbed wire fence measuring three metres in height and twenty metres in length shall be erected to prevent unauthorized access to SCP-1395, with at least three security outposts stationed in the surrounding area. Unauthorized civilians attempting to access SCP-1395 shall be administered Class B amnestics and redirected elsewhere.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1395 is a cave located near Mount \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Greece. Carbon dating of human remains and artifacts present within the cave suggest human habitation first began around \u2588\u2588\u2588 BCE, which is consistent with SCP-1395-A's claimed history (see below). Surveys conducted by Foundation personnel suggest a depth of at least five hundred metres; \nfurther exploration of the cave is scheduled pending approval.\n (Requests no longer accepted; see addendum 1395-A)\n\n\nSCP-1395's anomalous properties manifest when persons travel approximately three hundred metres inside the cave. After reaching this point, SCP-1395-A will manifest, blocking the path leading deeper into the cave (though not with any apparent hostile intent). SCP-1395-A is a humanoid entity, appearing to observers as a silhouetted apparition roughly 1.8 metres in height. Though it will not forcefully impede any attempts to leave the cave, \u2588\u2588% of persons encountering SCP-1395-A report a strong desire to stay within its presence.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A identifies itself as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and claims that it lived in the Ancient Greek city-state of Carystus around \u2588\u2588\u2588 BCE. Through unknown means, it was \"bound\" to the cave (see Interview Log), and apparently cannot manifest anywhere outside of it. SCP-1395-A speaks in the native language of whomever it is addressing; when questioned, however, it will insist it is speaking Attic Greek.\n\n\nIf approached by an individual or group, SCP-1395-A will engage the subject(s) in conversation, appearing to derive pleasure from describing and recounting its presumed life. Following the encounter, SCP-1395-A will demanifest, erasing all memories of the encounter from the individual(s)' mind. This will likewise affect written material, rendering writing on any sort of physical surface during the event illegible; however, digital records are not affected, making recording equipment a necessity when interacting with SCP-1395-A.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0SCP-1395-A\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Hello, SCP-1395-A.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Another has come? For so long, there was nothing, \nnothing\n\u2026 and now, it seems the visits have become more frequent.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How so?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Time is a difficult thing to measure in the Void\u2026 the days and the months and years fold in, collapse upon the weight of the blackness. But I have managed. You and your\u2026 \"Foundation\", was it? You have an interest in me.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We do, yes. Specifically, we would like to inquire about the details of your current condition, and its origins.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Ask. I will answer, though I must confess my memories have faded over time.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You claim to have been a man living in Carystus during the Ancient Greek era. Is that true?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n \"Ancient\"? That you would use such a term tells me a very long time has passed indeed. I wonder what has become of my home\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Please answer the question.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Yes, I once called Carystus my home. I was a simple merchant, living a comfortable existence. I was not wealthy, but neither was I starving, which is more than I could say for many of my countrymen.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How did you first encounter this cave?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n It was a warm day in spring\u2026 or was it summer? I cannot remember. Business was good, despite a few thieves trying to take from my stall. I was about to close up for the day, when an old man came up to my stall. He was a beggar, and asked me for a few morsels to subsist off of. Naturally, I refused.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Why?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n It was a time of famine! The crops had dried up inexplicably, and people were desperately sacrificing to the gods to reverse our fortune. I am not heartless, but had I given food out to everyone who asked, I would have been broke in three days!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I see. What happened next?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n He stared at me\u2014a more deadly and intent gaze I have yet to encounter. He cursed me in the name of the Pantheon, and declared me 'forsaken in the eyes of the gods'. I assumed he was a priest, as he had the curse memorized.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What did he do after that?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n He ran. He thought, correctly, that I would give him a thrashing for cursing me in such a way.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How long was it before you found yourself in this state?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Four months. Nothing occurred in the intervening time, aside from the usual fluctuations in business familiar to any merchant. It was the beginning of the cold season, and I had closed my shop for the evening when I was attacked by a thug. It was over in a few moments; I felt his blade go through me and my life deteriorate. And then, the blackness. I\u2026 [he pauses.]\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yes?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n It has been an eternity, yet I still remember his eyes. Those eyes\u2026 I felt as if I could see Hades through them. As if he were possessed by the Gods themselves\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Moving on. How long was it until you were first discovered?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Do you remember what I told you earlier? Time moves differently in the Void. It is\u2026 difficult to describe, to a presence of flesh. But if I were to estimate, I would say a few decades.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Describe your first contact with a human.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n [a distortion is heard, presumed to be laughter of some sort.] I was not as composed as I am now. The first one I met was an old one-an Athenian, judging by his attire. I screamed, so he ran, naturally. Then I felt myself imparting something upon him, and I vanished once more.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n The amnesiac effect you have?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n If that is what you would refer to it as, yes. It went like that during my first awakenings. A traveler chanced upon my cave, I appeared, they ran, and they forgot. It was not until some time later that I had my first true conversation.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Do you remember what this person looked like?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n He was dressed in a form of armor I did not recognize, and had a strange cross symbol upon his chest. I assumed he was a foreigner, yet he spoke Greek, despite his insistence he was speaking a language he called \"Aenglisc\".\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n How did he react to you?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n I had composed myself to the point where appearing was no longer a shock, so I greeted him. He asked if I was the ghost of a \"Christ\". When I said no, he asked if I was another fellow named \"Peter\". This went on for a while until I explained my origin, as I am to you now. We talked for a while, then he left.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n This is how your meetings have gone since then?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n I suppose so, yes. I am not some trickster God, looking to fool those who speak to me. I am merely a restless, lonely soul, looking for a way to stem the eternal emptiness for a time.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n One final question. Your amnesiac effect is not voluntary, correct?\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n Making them forget? Of course not. I would love for people to return. I suspect it was part of the curse; what sort of suffering is worse than being alone forever?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you, SCP-1395-A. That will be all.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n [Gestures to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's tape recorder]. These devices of yours\u2026 they allow you to remember?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n In a manner of speaking, yes.\n\n\nSCP-1395-A:\n That is good\u2026 if you remember, return once more. The coldness, the Void\u2026 it weighs upon me, and if I am never to leave this place, at least I shall have some company.\n\n[SCP-1395-A demanifests. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's memory of the encounter erased as expected.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its discovery by Foundation personnel, SCP-1395-A has been consistently cooperative.
