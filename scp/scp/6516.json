The ruined building does not exist on any plan of the area and is assumed to be an apparition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6516\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6516 is closed to the public and no access is permitted except with the permission of the Director of Site-44. The Foundation has purchased the Harbrook Estate from the National Trust under the guise of a private heritage fund, and has announced through a front agency that SCP-6516 is to be treated as an experimental human-free nature reserve. Foundation liaison with the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is ongoing and cordial, allowing a number of useful exceptions to be written into existing environmental and heritage law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6516-A, with the cord used to ring it from ground level visible in the foreground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6516 is All Hallows Wood, a wooded area of approximately 425\u00a0ha (4.25\u00a0km\n2\n) in the estate of Harbrook House, an eighteenth-century stately home in north-western Lincolnshire, England. The site has been preserved from logging since before the Norman Conquest; after the Conquest, it passed between several families before finally being acquired and entailed by the Harbrook viscountcy in the late sixteenth century. The last Viscount Harbrook sold the property to the National Trust in 1965.\n\n\nSCP-6516 is, in most respects, typical of wooded areas in Northern England. Its anomalous properties become clear only when visitors arrive.\n\n\nVisitors to SCP-6516 typically lose their way for several hours, up to an entire day from sunrise to sunset, until they encounter SCP-6516-A (see below). On the way, visitors experience shifts in topography and geography that cause the layout of SCP-6516 to radically diverge from satellite imaging and mapping of the area.\n\n\nIn addition, visitors to SCP-6516 will repeatedly encounter apparitions of people known to them who have died, as well as buildings they recognise and other images from their past. Human apparitions are mute and non-hostile, and are typically perceived by those who encounter them as warm and friendly. They will typically not approach the visitor closely, but in most cases will watch from further into the wood, demanifesting upon a close approach.\n\n\nSCP-6516 is also known to increase the strength and tangibility of unrelated hauntings and spectral apparitions that happen to enter SCP-6516. Cross-testing with other SCP objects is currently not permitted by the Department of Spectral Phenomena, but cross-testing with mundane and unclassified spectral activity is an active avenue of research.\n\n\nThe visitor will continue to experience apparitions until they encounter an aged bell housed in a brick tower ten metres in height (collectively designated SCP-6516-A). Upon ringing SCP-6516-A, all spectral activity in the area will cease, and the visitor will immediately become aware of an easy way out to the edge of the wood, even if no such exit route was visible before. Although visitors to SCP-6516 cannot find their way out of SCP-6516 on their own, repeated testing has determined that they will inevitably encounter SCP-6516-A before any harm is likely to come to them from exposure.\n\n\nOnce a visitor has rung SCP-6516-A, they will never experience the anomalous effects of SCP-6516 again.\n\n\nExploration 6516-Foxtrot:\n The most recent exploration of SCP-6516 was undertaken by Site-44 Senior Field Agent Penelope Ash at her request, on Friday 10 June 2022. An exploration log is attached below.\n\n\nA full log of all Foundation testing and exploration of SCP-6516 is available on request.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an audio transcript of Senior Agent Ash's exploration of SCP-6516 on Friday 9 September 2022, gathered from a high-quality microphone in her lapel.\n\n\nThroughout her expedition into SCP-6516, Agent Ash was accompanied by Agent Stephen Browning, another agent at Site-44. As of 2022, Agents Ash and Browning had been in a romantic relationship for eight years.\n\n\nTo respect the agents' privacy, Agent Ash's body-mounted microphone was not monitored during Exploration 6516-Foxtrot, and was only reviewed upon her return to base.\n\n\nExploration Log 6516-Foxtrot, Part 1 [Morning]\n\n\n08:32. BEGIN LOG.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n OK. I think we're good to go.\n\n\nA car door closes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's a long trip. You alright to drive the whole way, sweetheart?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah. It's not so bad, we should be there before noon.\n\n\nThe car starts.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Alright.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I'm glad you're here.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Hey. It's alright. Wouldn't be fair on you if I couldn't come with. 6516 can be pretty rough.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah. Yes.\n\n\nThey are quiet for some time while they reach the main road out of Southend.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Are you OK, sweetheart? You're a bit quiet.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah, I'm fine. Promise. Just getting myself ready.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah, I understand. I'm sure it won't be easy for either of us. We've both lost people.\n\n\nPages turning can be heard on the recording.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n But it's not every day we get to go on a country walk for work, is it?\n\n\nAgent Ash chuckles.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's not. It's been a while.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It has, hasn't it. I wonder why it's been so long? We used to do it all the time.\n\n\nThere is a brief silence.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n These things happen, I suppose.\n\n\nThe recording is silent for a few more minutes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What about some music?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh, there's an idea.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The Carpenters?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Soppy. Sounds good.\n\n\nThe sounds of Agent Browning putting a CD in the car stereo are audible on the recording. 'Top of the World' begins to play.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n \n[singing softly]\n Such a feeling's coming over me\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[singing]\n There is wonder in most everything I see\u2026\n\n\nBoth:\n \n[singing louder]\n Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes, and it\u2026\n\n\nThey giggle.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Haven't heard this in ages.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Me neither.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It \nis\n a lovely day, isn't it?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah. Won't look so nice on the M25 though.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n God, don't remind me.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Or worse, the M11.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh, \nstop\n.\n\n\nExtraneous conversation excised. Full transcript available on request.\n\n\n \n\n\nExploration Log 6516-Foxtrot, Part 2 [Early afternoon]\n\n\n11:56. BEGIN LOG.\n__\n\n\nIn the background, 'I Won't Last a Day Without You' can be heard on the stereo. Agent Ash later reported that they had played\n Only Yesterday: Richard and Karen Carpenter's Greatest Hits \ntwice through on the journey.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Here we are.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Hmm?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You were somewhere else entirely, love.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Oh, yeah. Oh, Harbrook House.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It looks bigger in the file, don't you think?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I think it looks about the same.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Mmm.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hey, look \u2014 didn't I say I'd get us here before noon?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I never doubted you.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I should think not.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Not after Andalucia\u2026\n1\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It was an open road!\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n You're a lunatic.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Don't complain. I always got us there on time.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Mostly in one piece.\n\n\nAgent Ash begins to laugh, but stops herself suddenly and clears her throat.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Well.\n\n\nThe engine stops.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n All Hallows Wood.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Looks like it.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It doesn't look very haunted, does it?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Not really, no.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Reminds me of the New Forest. Remember?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Actually, yeah.\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Shall we?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You go first, I want to check the mic. Wait for me over by the gate.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Alright.\n\n\nThere is a small sound on the recording; Agent Ash later clarified that Agent Browning had leaned over and kissed her on the cheek.\n\n\nThe car door opens and Agent Browning can be heard stepping onto the gravel outside the car. Agent Ash breathes out very heavily and clears her throat. She takes several deep breaths and opens the door.\n\n\nBirdsong is audible on the recording, and the sound of gravel crunching underfoot.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n All good?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah, all good.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What a lovely day we got for it. I know I said already, but it's perfect.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Isn't it?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The air is so fresh. I feel\u2026energetic.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Good!\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Anyway \u2014 remind me again what 44 wants out of our little walk.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's just an exploration mission. Check for consistency with other results. I think they're just going down the list of field agents, because you can't do it twice. Take some photographs. Record sounds.\n\n\nA gentle thumping sound is audible on the recording, presumably from Agent Ash tapping her mic.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Then report back.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Righto. Sally went recently, didn't she?\n2\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah, earlier this year.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What did she see? I've read the report, but\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah. She didn't really say. I thought it better not to pry and the report has the information we need. She seemed alright about it though. Calm. It made her smile to think about it, I think.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Mmm.\n\n\nThere is a brief pause on the recording.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Well, ready when you are.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Alright.\n\n\nThe sound of a gate squeaking open is audible, as are two sets of footsteps on the pathway. Neither agent speaks for several minutes. Birdsong continues and becomes slightly louder.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Twelve-oh-nine. You reread the file on the way up, didn't you? Remind me what it said about when it's supposed to\u2026begin.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Varies, apparently. For some the anomaly kicks in almost immediately; other people have had to wander around for hours before they see anything. There are pre-containment reports of people going through All Hallows Wood and not seeing anything unusual, but either they're very unobservant or\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \u2026they haven't lost anyone, right.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Lucky them.\n\n\nBoth agents lapse into silence for around eight minutes.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Wait.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What's up?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n That stump over there, look.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n We walked past it earlier.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n But that's impossible. We've not left the path.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It must be kicking in about now. Hold on.\n\n\nThere is a rustling sound as Agent Ash retrieves her smartphone from her pocket.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n GPS is scrambled, it can't get a lock, look.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Just bouncing around. God, that's weird.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I didn't even notice.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Nor me. I wonder when it kicked in. The files say it tends to happen when you aren't paying attention.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n No way to know.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I was just listening to the birds.\n\n\nThey laugh.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[forcefully]\n God, I've missed this.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Field work?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Field work with you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's been a while. How long?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[quietly]\n A long time.\n\n\nA quiet rustling sound can be heard. Agent Ash explained later that Agent Browning had pulled her into a hug at this point.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Well, we're here now.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Don't you just feel so \nalive\n here?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Alive?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Something about the air and the sunshine, I don't know. Haven't felt like this in ages.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You \nare\n very perky.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I hope I'm not being annoying.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Not at all.\n\n\nShe gasps sharply.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Look, over there. Look!\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What? There? I don't\u2014\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Ah, too late. I saw someone. They're gone now.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Who?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Not sure. An old lady. Too far away to be sure.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n \u2026mine or yours, do you think?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Mine. I'm pretty sure.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Why?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I could be wrong, but I think it was\u2026Mrs Dixon?\n3\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Who's Mrs Dixon?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n My old Year Three teacher.\n4\n She died a year or two after I left primary school, I remember hearing about it over Christmas.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Your teacher? I wonder why her?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n God knows.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n People have reported rather unexpected apparitions. It's not always people you were close to.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I certainly wasn't expecting to see her again.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Did you like her?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Not\u2026particularly, no. I mean, she was fine. I don't remember much about it. She was very pernickety about handwriting. I remember one day she told us off about our Zs. But she smiled a lot.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I see.\n\n\nThey walk on, in silence.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What's that?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n That building?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yes. It's not on the map. But then I have no idea where on the map we are now, anyway.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Apparition, then.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It looks familiar.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh my God.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's Granny Ginny's house.\n5\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Your grandmother? Liz's mother?\n6\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The fire\u2026\n7\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n God, that was ages ago. But it looks like new. Look, the roses over the door. She was so proud of those. I pricked myself on the thorns once when I visited her, and she was so gentle with me.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, look. Upstairs.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh, Gran\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Is she\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash later reported that the apparition of Mrs White waved at them from her upstairs window. Agent Ash can be heard clearing her throat on the recording.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n She looks just like she does in that photo on the mantelpiece, when you were a kid. Right outside that door.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hasn't aged a day. Maybe it's because I remember her so strongly from when I was that age.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Maybe.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh, there she goes. Bye Gran.\n\n\nThere is a long pause.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Twelve forty-two. We've been out here a while.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Can you figure out where we are \nsupposed\n to be?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hang on.\n\n\nAgent Ash later reported that they both studied the paper satellite map of the area for several minutes.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I think\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah, there. You can see that big tree and the bend in the path.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n But that doesn't make sense, because the bridge is over there, on the right of the map, and we've just crossed it.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Welcome to All Hallows Wood, I suppose.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Steve, look.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Granny Ginny's house is gone.\n\n\n \n\n\nExploration Log 6516-Foxtrot, Part 3 [Late afternoon and evening]\n\n\nIn debrief, Agent Ash reported that she encountered the following apparitions within the subsequent few hours:\n\n\n\n\nGregory Ash, Agent Ash's paternal uncle (died 2009).\n\n\nAn unknown detached, two-storey house, later identified as Agent Ash's home in Somerset for several years during her infancy (demolished 1996).\n\n\nAn unknown elderly woman, later identified as Rachael Paisley, Agent Ash's great-aunt on her maternal grandfather's side (died 1993).\n\n\nAn unknown elderly woman, later identified as Matilda Wolfe, Agent Ash's maternal grandmother (died 1992).\n\n\nJasmine Hunter, a schoolmate of Agent Ash at primary school, who died of a brain tumour aged nine (died 1999).\n\n\n\n\nAll apparitions were, as with every encounter within SCP-6516, friendly and mute. The full transcript of these encounters can be retrieved on request, but is excluded here for brevity.\n\n\nThe following extract covers the final hours of Agent Ash's exploration into SCP-6516.\n\n\n16:42. BEGIN LOG.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I don't remember the last time I walked this far.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Nor me. I'm surprised we haven't seen the bell yet.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Mmm. Isn't it normally at sunset?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Not always, it varies. It's never in the morning, but other than that it's not clear. There's some suggestion in the reports that time is a bit weird here, too.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Weird?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Hours taking longer than they should, or the sun setting sooner than it should.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Right.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Whoever comes next should bring the temporal equipment and try and get a reading.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's a good idea. I'll suggest it. I'd do it myself, but\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah, it only works once.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Actually, I've been thinking.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n First time for everything.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Shut it. I've been thinking about why it is that\u2014\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hang on. Shush.\n\n\nThey fall silent. The sound of an animal can be heard indistinctly on the recording.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Is that a dog?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I think so.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n No dogs in the wood, so it must be\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n An apparition. But\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n \u2026oh, Pen.\n\n\nThe sound is louder and is clearly distinguishable as the barking of a dog.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh no. Surely not.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, love.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n That's not fair.\n\n\nThe sound suddenly becomes very loud. Analysis indicates the source was within range of 10 meters.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[calling]\n Banjo! Here, boy!\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Banjo!\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n There you are. Oh, Banjo. Good boy.\n8\n Look at him, Steve. Here, boy! Here!\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Can't come any nearer, Banjo? That's OK.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Just look, he's so healthy.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I know, Pen. When I knew him he was a little lame in his old age but he still had the fire in him.\n\n\nAgent Ash takes a deep breath.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n How come he's barking?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n That \nis\n strange.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I haven't heard that barking in so long. He was quieter when he was older. Shhh, Banjo! It's like he's a puppy again.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The apparitions are mute here. Maybe it's just words, language.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Something like that.\n\n\nBanjo whimpers loudly.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Where's he\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n There between the trees. Is that a little path?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I didn't even notice it.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n That's because it wasn't there before.\n\n\nBanjo barks.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n He wants us to follow him, I think.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Go on, boy. We're coming.\n\n\nThe recording goes quiet for several minutes except for the sound of the agents' breathing, Banjo panting from a distance, and leaves and twigs underfoot. Soon, Banjo's panting fades.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Steve, I don't see him. I think he's gone.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n He must just have been guiding us into this path.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n That pup\u2026 We loved him so much. Dad was never the same after he died. He couldn't face getting another dog.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I remember. You and I hadn't been together that long when Banjo died, had we?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n A couple of years I think. Maybe a little less.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah. You were just inconsolable.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n He was a wonderful dog.\n\n\nThe recording goes quiet again for a moment.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, look, behind us.\n\n\nAgent Ash breathes out heavily on the recording. She reported in her debrief that she turned around to discover that the path behind them had vanished into the trees.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n God.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah. Nowhere to go but forward.\n\n\nThere is quiet on the recording for several minutes.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, why did you volunteer for this?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[brightly]\n Oh, no particular reason.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n C'mon, Pen. That's bullshit.\n\n\nAgent Ash sighs.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You're right, it is.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n So?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Well, I just\u2026wanted to see people again. Doesn't everyone want that?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah. I know what you mean. But we all do. People don't volunteer for 6516 without a good reason. Traumatic.\n\n\nA short pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's your dad, isn't it?\n9\n\n\nA short pause.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes, it is.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The Foundation demands a lot from us.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It does.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n But missing your father's funeral is no joke. It makes sense why you'd volunteer for this.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes. I knew that going in, though. I knew this job would take a lot from me. But it gave me a lot, too. It gave me you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Aww.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I'm serious.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Alright. But yeah, I understand now.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Do you? Mm.\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I just wish I could work out what the point of this place was.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n The point?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Some people at the Foundation think all the anomalies we work with have some point or message to them.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n What's the point of the \nlizard\n?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Well, exactly. But it's something to think about. And this place doesn't seem to make sense. It's almost too kind.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Too kind?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It just lets people see the ones they've lost again. Everyone wants that. It's like wish-fulfilment.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Maybe sometimes you'll see people you don't want to see again.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Not according to the records. The Charlie expedition was done by a D-class, who'd killed his abusive father in a fight. Never saw him.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Never?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's like the wood is set up this way, to be good to people. But that seems too nice.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You're so jaded, Steve. Sometimes there's good in our work.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I suppose so. You're right.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \u2026yes. \n[she clears her throat]\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Anyway, I was\u2026Hang on.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I hear it too.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Where is it?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Just up ahead, it's\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n \u2026oh.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hi, Dad.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I missed you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n He looks exactly the same. Exactly the same.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n He always stood so straight. I used to be a bit scared of him. His height, his bearing.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n My friends used to call him the Captain, after his rank in the army. He didn't like it. It was too much.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Is he\u2026?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgents Ash and Browning take a few steps forward.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The files say they don't come this close.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[softly]\n Shhh.\n\n\nAgent Ash reported in her debrief that her father's apparition approached closer and closer, eventually stopping less than two metres away from them. Before this incident, no apparition had approached closer than approximately ten metres.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Dad\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Hello again, Ed.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n He's\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Why's he looking at me? Ed? What is it?\n\n\nAgent Ash reported that at this point, the apparition of her father smiled at her, then made a beckoning gesture to Agent Browning, and led them further down the pathway.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n OK. OK.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah.\n\n\nOnly footsteps and birdsong can be heard for several minutes. Agent Ash reported at this point that she and Agent Browning joined hands as they walked.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The sun's getting low in the sky, look.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Mm.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It can't be long now.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n No.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen. I've been thinking.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Hmm?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n They've all been you. Everything that's appeared today has been something from your life, not mine. Why has it chosen you?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Chosen?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I thought it would show us\u2026both of us. It's like the wood picked you instead of me.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n No, I don't think so. I think it's just chance.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, that's bullshit, come on. There's something you aren't telling me. Something that's not in the files.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n \n[desperately]\n No, there isn't, I\u2014\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen. Pen, please. What's happening here?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Oh, love. I'm so sorry. \n[she coughs, and audibly holds back tears]\n That's the trouble, love, you don't remember.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What don't I remember?\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Penelope. Please. Tell me.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's six months today. You were driving home from an assignment in Scotland.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Scotland. The Campbell matter.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes. It was near the Borders. You\u2026they said it was a blind corner. There was a truck, a tanker. You never had a chance.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n \u2026what?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You don't remember. Ever since it happened, you've appeared to me in the passenger seat of my car, every single day, and you don't remember. Time doesn't seem to work the same way for you any more.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Something\u2026 \n[he pauses for a moment]\n I remember noise, and headlights\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n They said you didn't suffer, love.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I\u2026Pen, I'm\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's alright. I've had you for six months longer. I've taken drives with you, just to feel your hand on mine in the car. But you've never been able to get \nout\n of my car. You're stuck somehow.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Stuck\u2026but here\u2026\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yeah. You could walk with me again. One last time.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The bell. I understand.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes. The bell should unstick you, they said. I\u2026I can't do it any more. I can't live like this, every day, stuck. It's not right. You can't stay any longer. The bell can let you move on, they think.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I didn't want to. And I didn't think you'd remember anyway. You don't remember things well now. Today you remember better.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's the wood. It's making things clearer.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Yes.\n\n\nA short pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n What's he pointing at?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Look. There.\n\n\nAgent Ash reported that SCP-6516-A came into view at this point, within a clearing. At this point, the apparition of her father turned around, stepped close to them and shook Agent Browning's hand, before waving goodbye to her and demanifesting.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Bye, Dad. See you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I can touch him.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You're closer to him than I am now.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Closer. Yes.\n\n\nFootsteps are audible on the recording as they approach the belltower.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n The sun's going down. It won't be light for much longer.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n No.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's\u2026it's time to go, isn't it?\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I don't want you to. I've missed you so much. In the car I've had your shadow, but today I've had you again.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I have to, though. Now we're here I can feel it. Like gravity. Oh, Pen. I'm sorry.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n It's OK. Really. I've wept for you long enough now. We had everything in our eight years. But I wanted to grow old with you. I wanted\u2026\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I know, sweetheart. It just wasn't to be. These things happen.\n\n\nThere is a pause. Agent Ash reports that at this point she was gripping the cord of SCP-6516-A.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I can't do it. I can't. I can't send you away. Can you do it?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I can't. I don't know why. It just\u2026it has to be you. I know it somehow. I'm sorry.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I love you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I love you too. So much. Please, never forget it.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n I won't. I'm coming after you too, one day. There's somewhere to go, I know that now.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yes. Somewhere deeper in the wood.\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Pen. It's time, sweetheart.\n\n\nShe takes a deep, shuddering breath. Moments later, the bell rings, a bright, full, echoing peal. Agent Ash begins to cry softly. A rustling sound is heard on the recording as they embrace.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's starting. I feel\u2026lighter.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n And look, I can see the way out now. There's the gate.\n\n\nThere is a brief pause.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n I think I've worked out what it is.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n The wood?\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Yeah. It's something like a departure lounge. A concourse. A train platform. Somewhere to say your goodbyes.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Mmm. Maybe you're right.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n C'mere. Give me your hand. I'll walk you to the edge.\n\n\nTwo sets of footsteps are audible on the path again.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n It's been a perfect day.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n Thank you.\n\n\nAgent Browning:\n Travel safe, sweetheart.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You too.\n\n\nGradually, the two sets of footsteps fade to one as Agent Ash approaches the gate out of the wood.\n\n\nAgent Ash:\n You too.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Footnotes\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Agent Ash clarified during debrief that this was a reference to a holiday the two had taken in 2018.\n\n\n2\n. Agent Sally Guest, a colleague and friend of Agents Ash and Browning, also attached to Site-44. Agent Guest conducted the 6516-Echo expedition in February 2022.\n\n\n3\n. Identified as Mrs Kathleen Dixon of Weston-super-Mare; died of a stroke in 2003.\n\n\n4\n. The equivalent of the US second grade.\n\n\n5\n. Agent Ash's grandmother, Ginevra \"Ginny\" White.\n\n\n6\n. \"Liz\" is Elizabeth Ash, Agent Ash's mother.\n\n\n7\n. Following her death from cancer in 2011, Ginevra White's former house burned down in an unexpected and catastrophic fire the following year, thought to have been set by squatters or local adolescents.\n\n\n8\n. Banjo, a German Shepherd, was Agent Ash's family pet. He died of natural causes aged 15, in 2016.\n\n\n9\n. Edward Ash, Agent Ash's father, died of a massive heart attack in June 2021 at the age of 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6515\n | SCP-6516 | \nSCP-6517\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndxvi's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-6063\n \n(+269)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6182\n \n(+127)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6106\n \n(+181)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Demonstration\n \n(+21)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\ndxvi's author page\n \n(+47)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6516\n\" by dxvi, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

The site has been preserved from logging since before the Norman Conquest; after the Conquest, it passed between several families before finally being acquired and entailed by the Harbrook viscountcy in the late sixteenth century. The last Viscount Harbrook sold the property to the National Trust in 1965.",
