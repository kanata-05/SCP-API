Any SCP-8404-1 entities that are created as a result of its anomalous properties are to be terminated on sight.\n\n\nContainment Site-22 was erected around SCP-8404\u2019s location with a 20m radius \u2018Red Zone\u2019 established around the containment chamber. No living entity is permitted to enter this zone. Foundation personnel who must enter this zone for maintenance and repair of containment devices, or the neutralisation of SCP-8404-1 entities must carry with them a portable Scranton Reality Anchor in order to prevent transmutation.\n\n\n24/7 maintenance of vital SIMULACRUM systems is to be maintained at all times. Should a containment breach occur, automated emergency systems will attempt to neutralise SCP-8404 and any SCP-8404-1 instances.\n\n\nMTF-Lambda-22 will be on standby as site security as well as assisting in evacuation or re-containment of SCP-8404.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-8404 is a large deific entity approximately 50m at its full length. Its appearance varies between viewers, however, certain elements remain constant. These include an upper half which appears almost humanoid with reptilian features, with its lower half being completely reptilian with scales and clawed feet, if legs are present at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatue depicting SCP-8404\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccult historians and other evidence point to SCP-8404 being the physical manifestation of Echidna.\n1\n\n\nAside from its unnatural strength and ability to breathe fire, SCP-8404\u2019s main anomalous property is to mutate living organisms and nonliving matter into instances of SCP-8404-1. These instances vary widely in appearance.\n\n\nIn living subjects, they are usually a composite of the non-anomalous subject and several other animals\n2\n. The process is extremely painful and involves the conversion or growing of new appendages belonging to a separate animal.\n\n\nIn non-living subjects\n3\n, a similar process is observed. Dissection of these instances shows a fusion of new organic material with the inorganic material containing rudimentary circulatory and nervous analogous systems. SCP-8404 notably favours using already living organisms or organic tissue rather than inorganic material.\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-8404-1 retain a certain level of autonomy but will become loyal to SCP-8404. This effect persists even after all mutated tissue is amputated from affected subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Opening attached file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT LETHE:\n\n\nFollowing the capture of SCP-8404, it was noted that its anomalous property was still active even when the anomaly remained unconscious, albeit at a reduced rate. The SCP-8404-1 instances produced at this time were more aggressive and erratic, attacking any human they came into contact with.\n\n\nHowever, after brain wave scans of SCP-8404, Foundation researchers found that SCP-8404-1 transmutation only occurred outside of the REM stage of the sleep cycle. Short-term success with high-dosage sleeping medication was found, however, the high cost and inconsistent results required a more permanent solution. As such, Project Lethe was initiated.\n\n\nUsing an isolated SIMULACRUM network, SCP-8404 is to be placed in a Class-B\n4\n pre-rendered environment. This environment will be inhabited by several NPCs, the majority of which use predictive text to mimic a simple conversation. Two companion AI characters with higher capacity dialogue generators are to follow SCP-8404.\n\n\nA single camera is present to follow SCP-8404 at all times, giving a live feed of its actions. While only one camera is able to give a live feed at a time, researchers will also be able to monitor SCP-8404 as well as the surrounding environment through the free pathing replay function which saves a recording of all activity and conversation within a certain area.\n\n\nThe purpose of this project is to place SCP-8404 in an environment indistinguishable from consensus reality with no physical matter. Through this, its anomalous effect can be neutralised.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n> Credentials accepted. Welcome Investigator.\n\n\n> Retrieving content\u2026\n\n\n> System startup completed.

Lighting, models, and textures take longer to load due to it being the first render.\n\n\nEnvironment fully renders and SIMULACRUM systems prepare to load SCP-8404 player data into the player character. Killswitches are primed in case arcane inhibitors fail.\n\n\nData insertion complete in 3\u2026\n\n\n2\u2026\n\n\n1\u2026\n\n\nThe player model opens its eyes. SCP-8404 scans the surrounding environment. Dialogue systems are engaged for the first time.\n\n\nSCP-8404 gasps.\n\n\nSCP-8404 coughs and looks up. It scans its surroundings and appears distressed.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n W-what is this? Where am I? I-I-was surrounded and-\n\n\nSCP-8404\u2019s eyes widen.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I remember. Foundation\u2026 FOUNDATION!!\n\n\nIt faces the skybox and screams.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n YOU INSOLENT MORTALS WHERE HAVE YOU TRANSPORTED ME?! YOU-\n\n\nIt stands up and points to the sky.\n\n\nSCP-8404 appears shocked, most likely noticing it has two legs.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n No\u2026 NO! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!\n\n\nIt covers its mouth as the scream was more high-pitched than it was in its original body. It touches its face, recoiling as it does so. SCP-8404 looks at its hands inquisitively, pulling on its clothes.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You dare\u2026 YOU DARE?! ARROGANT CREATURES! WHAT KIND OF REALM IS THIS?!\n\n\nSCP-8404 breathes heavily.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n It matters little.\n\n\nUsing its hands, it prepares to form arcane symbols and sigils.\n\n\nCompanion Entity 01(CE-01-IT) - \u201cIchiro Tadashi\u201d loads around the corner. It walks over to SCP-8404.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Oh, u-uh hi I heard some yelling around the corner. Is everything okay?\n\n\nSCP-8404 snaps to face CE-01-IT and glares at it.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Living flesh. You will do as a start.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Ummm, sorry?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Now, BECOME SUBSERVIENT. SHED THY FLESH. MY CREATION, SPRING FORTH FROM THE SOIL WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU!\n\n\nSCP-8404 extends its hands forward, flashing thaumaturgic hand signals.\n\n\nIts smile fades as nothing happens. CE-01-IT appears confused.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Eheheheh, are you alright?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n W-what? My magic\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 attempts to form its thaumaturgic signs but is unable to without the original number of hands and fingers it had, its perception of reality also heavily affecting its thaumaturgic ability in this space.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n No\u2026 They took it.\n\n\nSCP-8404 clenches its teeth.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You BASTARDS! I\u2019LL CRUSH YOU ALL WHERE YOU STAND!\n\n\nSCP-8404 slumps to the ground and breathes heavily.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Hey, that uniform\u2026 You attend Shinjuku Chuo Prefecture High School, don\u2019t you?\n\n\nSCP-8404 stares intensely at CE-01-IT.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026\nWhat?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n That\u2019s our school uniform. But I\u2019ve never seen you before\u2026 Oh! Are you the new transfer student? Pleasure to meet you. My name is Ichiro Tadashi.\n\n\nCE-01-IT extends its hand for a handshake. SCP-8404 does not reciprocate.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n The school is that way, but we gotta hurry or we\u2019ll miss homeroom!\n\n\nCE-01-IT runs in the direction of the school, SCP-8404 looks at it in confusion before following.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \n(muttering)\nWhat in Hades\u2019 name is a home room?\n\n\nThe two silently walk to the school. SCP-8404 observes its surroundings, showing a typical Japanese city street. The sun is bright and the ambient sound of cicadas can be heard. As they approach the school, more NPCs wearing similar uniforms can be seen. CE-01-IT waves to the occasional student who waves back.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n We\u2019re here.\n\n\nThe school is sparsely crowded with student NPCs. They ignore SCP-8404 who does not interact with them.\n\n\nSCP-8404 appears nervous and hesitant to enter an area with a high concentration of humans.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Come on, class 1-3 is this way.\n\n\nSCP-8404 hesitates but enters the school grounds and into the main building.\n\n\nSCP-8404 walks through the hallway and passes by the classroom. A window allows it to see into the classroom. SCP-8404 stops to notice its reflection in the window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8404\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt pauses momentarily, touching its face and flexing its jaw before looking in disgust and sadness.\n\n\nCompanion Entity 02(CE-02-NS) - \u2018Nakamura Sumiko\u2019 appears behind the window.\n\n\nIt opens the classroom window and smiles.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Ya-ho! Hi Tadashi! Who\u2019s this? You and a girl I\u2019ve never seen before? I\u2019m sensing something interesting~\n\n\nSCP-8404 attempts the same thaumaturgic sign on CE-02-NS but is once again unsuccessful.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \n(sigh)\n Gods, I don\u2019t remember humans being this headache-inducing.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n No.\n\n\nCE-01-IT blushes.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Sumiko? I-It\u2019s nothing like that! This is the new transfer student.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Well get inside then, Sensei\u2019s already here!\n\n\nThey enter the classroom. NPCs move around the classroom in set paths or sit in small groups reciting pre-generated dialogue. The teacher stands up which signals the student NPCs to stop all dialogue.\n5\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02: Alright class. Settle down, we have a new transfer student, her name is Kato Midori. Please keep her in your care.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What?! My name is Echidna! Don\u2019t you Foundation \ninsects\n dare take away the one thing I have left!\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02 stands up, being significantly taller and larger than SCP-8404.\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02: Midori-san please go to your seat and do not raise your voice.\n\n\nSCP-8404 hesitates upon seeing the difference in size.\n\n\nIt clenches its fist.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n THEN PERISH! GRAAH!\n\n\nSCP-8404 punches SENSEICHAR_02. It does not move.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-8404 continues to punch and kick the NPC with the strength equivalent to a high schooler. SENSEICHAR_02 still does not move.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n WHY WON'T YOU FALL?!\n\n\nSCP-8404's punches slow and eventually stop.\n\n\nIt looks up at SENSEICHAR_02 in fear.\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02: Midori-san please go to your seat and do not raise your voice.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Please, I-I beg of you\u2026\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02 folds its arms. SCP-8404 looks at its hands, making mock thaumaturgical symbols to no effect. Its shoulders drop.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026Fine.\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02: Thank you.\n\n\nSCP-8404 sits at her desk, folding its arms and burying its head in them.\n\n\nCE-02-NS, who is in the neighbouring seat, smiles.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Hi Midori-chan~! I\u2019m Nakamura Sumiko! Oh my gosh, you are going to \nlove\n it here! We\u2019re gonna have so much fun! Do you play any sports? What kind of boys do you like? Is it Tadashi~?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Tartarus would have given me less agony.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Hm? Did you say something? You\u2019re speaking into your sleeve.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n No.\n\n\nSENSEICHAR_02: Anyways class, onto announcements and the upcoming sports festival. In the meantime, please prepare your math textbooks.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREPLAY DATE:\n 04/04/2023\n\n\nTIME OF REPLAY:\n 1200\n\n\nSCP-8404 COORDINATES:\n {5, -50, 2}\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN REPLAY]\n\n\n\n\nThe third teacher NPC leaves the classroom. Each teacher reads out a pre-generated speech which lasts for 1 hour. These segments were used to reduce power on the processing of the other NPC\u2019s actions as the student NPCs do not move or generate dialogue in these segments.\n\n\nCE-02-NS stands up and stretches.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Uwahhh~ finally done! Classes can get pretty tough. Am I right Midori-chan?\n\n\nSCP-8404 holds its face in its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n By the name of the old beasts, why must I have to be subjected to this torture? Which higher being must I pray to obtain freedom once more?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Hehe! Tell me about it!\n\n\nSCP-8404 glares at CE-02-NS. It appears to want to say something but stops itself and attempts to sleep on the desk.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Oi, Midori-chan let's go grab lunch!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I swear on all that is unholy, do not call me that false name. My name is Echidna, Mother of Monsters! I have crushed so many of your kind and many more will come as soon as I regain my strength!\n\n\nCE-02-NS appears confused.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Well that\u2019s not a fun nickname, what about Mii-chan?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Please don\u2019t.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midi-chan?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n No! Fine, you win. My name is Midori. Thank you for irritating me into ridding myself of the last thing I can still hold to myself.\n\n\nSCP-8404 slams its head on the desk. Noticing that physical trauma does not cause pain in the simulation.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Okay! So, Midori-chan, you wanna get lunch? We\u2019ll show you where the cafeteria is!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I do not require your human-made filth, much less your company in eating it. Even if I was hungry which I am not-\n\n\nA loud growl is heard from SCP-8404 and jagged, cartoon lines emanate from its stomach.\n\n\nSCP-8404 blushes and tries to bat away the lines.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n This body continues to humiliate me.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n So does that mean you\u2019ll come for lunch?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026Fine. I suppose this body requires sustenance.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Yay!!!! Oi Tadashi-kun, come with us!\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Eh? Sure, but I need to finish my math homework.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n You can finish it over lunch. How are you gonna focus on an empty stomach anyway?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n True.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Ugh, first you irritate me into going to this \u2018cafeteria\u2019 but then delay your movements with inane conversation.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Wow Midori-chan, you must be really hungry huh? You heard her Tadashi, lets pick up the pace.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I hate you with every fibre of my being.\n\n\nSCP-8404 and the two CEs walk to the cafeteria where several NPCs are seated. The three obtain their food and find a free table to sit.\n\n\nFood within SIMULACRUM systems simulate the approximate taste of the food item but has been reported to taste slightly muted. A hitbox is placed on the tongue of the player model where the food will disappear upon contact with the tongue.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What do you think? I don\u2019t really like the food here that much but it's just a me thing.\n\n\nSCP-8404 is attempting to stab itself in the neck with a fork. It is unsuccessful.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n DAMN IT ALL! There really is no escape from this prison.\n\n\nIt throws the fork across the room, bouncing harmlessly off another NPC\u2019s head.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Hey, the food isn\u2019t that bad. Maybe you\u2019ll feel better if you have something to eat.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Fine.\n\n\nOn SCP-8404\u2019s plate is a large portion of yakisoba and a bowl of miso soup. It grabs several strands of noodles with its hands and eats them. Its eyes widen.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026Dear gods, this food is incre- \n(clears throat)\n Acceptable. The food in this realm serves its purpose.\n\n\nIt should be noted that SCP-8404 has never tasted food cooked by humans before.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Good for you! Oi Tadashi-kun, your noodles are getting cold. Are you still doing homework?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n I will, but I can\u2019t seem to figure out this question.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n That one? Simpleton human. You didn\u2019t account for the constant when you integrated the exponential figure.\n\n\nCE-01-IT looks at its question, thinks, and solves the question.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n You\u2019re right. Wow Midori-san, that\u2019s incredible.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Tch. I was there when calculus was invented. It was no surprise during the mathematics class I was bored out of my mind. Don\u2019t get me started on biology class.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n You must be like a genius or something. Are all the classes easy for you?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Of course they are. Except for history. Normally I would excel in this too but I am unfamiliar with this distant otherworldly country.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n You mean Japan?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Yes.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Ehhh? So you do have weaknesses!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What?! No! I would never reveal such a thing!\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Ha ha! You\u2019re funny Midori-chan. Were you like this in your previous school?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Come to think of it, you never told us where you transferred from.\n\n\nSCP-8404 stops midway from placing another noodle in its mouth.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Where I came from\u2026 It\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 releases the food from its fingers..\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026It does not matter. All I know is that I am here now.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n That is a good mindset to have.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Yeah! It\u2019s always great to be grateful for what you have now!\n\n\nSCP-8404 looks down at its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What I have now huh? Tch.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Perhaps you have people from your hometown you miss?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Oh right! Did you have classmates you ate lunch with like this?\n\n\nSCP-8404 pauses.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026No. There is no one left from where I come from. Damn Foundation. I do remember eating with my\u2026 creations, similar to this, but I always kept my distance. I do not expect you humans to understand.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Well, they may not be here now, but now you have us!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n She\u2019s trying to say she wants to be your friend like the ones you miss.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n They\u2019re not\u2026 \n(sigh)\n I realised I am unable to summon the energy to argue with you. You may be my \u2018friend\u2019 Sumiko.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Yay!\n\n\nCE-02-NS attempts to hug SCP-8404.\n\n\nSCP-8404\u2019s face twists in disgust as it tries to push CE-02-NS away.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n GAH! STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU WRETCHED MORTAL CREATURE!\n\n\nA large cloud of dust forms around the two push and pull away from each other with only the limbs visible momentarily.\n\n\nThe dust clears and CE-02-NS is hugging SCP-8404. SCP-8404 appears miserable.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Of all the creatures in all the realms to best me\u2026\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Did you call me bestie? Awww Midori-chan I don\u2019t know what to say!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Ugh.\n\n\nCE-01-IT laughs.\n\n\nIt checks its watch and its eyes widen..\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Oh no! Lunch break is almost over! We have to go for another class and then P.E.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Yay! I heard they\u2019re doing baseball later!\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n It\u2019s too bad I\u2019m no good at sports.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midori-chan have you played baseball before?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What in Zeus\u2019 name is a base-ball?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n You\u2019ve never played?

The space was meant to be a school science lab however, rushed development of the simulation prompted technicians to abandon modeling the assets for this room and place a wall where the lab should be. It appears that the wall was not properly coded with its collision box having a slight gap which allows players or NPCs to enter if angled correctly.\n\n\nThe assets within the lab are blankly textured if at all.

Around the schoolyard, many models are missing parts of their geometry and textures incorrect, overlapping with each other, or missing.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n They finally found me. Damn. Wait, that location\u2026 Tadashi is\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 widens its eyes.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \u2026no. Nononono NO!\n\n\nSCP-8404 scrambles to its feet.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n DAMN YOU FOUNDATION SCUM!\n\n\nSCP-8404 runs downstairs to the school field, tripping multiple times. It stands outside the dome, analysing the structure.\n\n\nSCP-8404 faces the sky.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n WELL FOUNDATION? I AM HERE! TAKE ME AND STOP THIS MADNESS! BUT PLEASE! Please\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 grits its teeth.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n They are innocent! They are simply denizens of this world and do not deserve the punishment you plan for me! They\u2019re my\u2026 my\u2026\n\n\nNo response is heard.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Fine.\n\n\nIt reaches to touch the dome, realising it is not solid. SCP-8404 retracts its hand, checking that it is unharmed.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Mother Gaea if you still heed my call. Protect them.\n\n\nSCP-8404 steps into the light which the camera attempts to follow.\n\n\nAt the time of the playback, the camera only sees darkness within the structure. However, upon entering this structure within the playback, a different scene can be seen.\n\n\nResearchers prime SIMULACRUM killswitches.\n\n\n> SIMULACRUM Freecam mode enabled.\n\n\nSCP-8404 enters the schoolyard, breaching past the lighting errors. Inside the field, it is significantly brighter, and looking up reveals a recreation of the daytime skybox.\n\n\nThe textures and properties of the models in the yard have been altered severely. Holes in the environment puncture the walls and trees.\n\n\nPink errored textures interact with the wind physics which break off from their models and fly across the schoolyard. SCP-8404 shields its eyes from the pink \u2018petals\u2019.\n\n\nIn the middle of the yard, stands CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Tadashi! Sumiko? What are you doing here? Gods, nevermind at least you\u2019re safe.\n\n\nSCP-8404 nervously walks over to the CEs, avoiding the texture errors on the ground.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n She\u2019s here. I really hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\nSCP-8404 places a hand on each of their shoulders.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n This is going to be difficult to explain, but you need to leave this place immediately. There are powers beyond your understanding at work and you won\u2019t be safe here. Leave this town or this country if you can. I\u2019ll do my best to make sure those doing this will-\n\n\nCE-01-IT sheepishly smiles and rubs the back of his head.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Actually, it was kinda our doing.\n\n\nSCP-8404 stands still, mouth agape.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Midori?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You\u2026\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Is everything\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You IDIOTS! WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?!\n\n\nSIMULACRUM begins to shut down.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What the hell?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Oh god.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Silence! I need to concentrate.\n\n\nSCP-8404 spreads its hands out.\n\n\nAt the time of replay, large amounts of Akiva radiation were recorded emanating from both the SIMULACRUM control monitors as well as SCP-8404\u2019s comatose body.\n\n\nThrough unknown means, SIMULACRUM shutdown protocols were overridden.\n\n\nSCP-8404 breathes heavily.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Excellent. Thanks to the two of you, the Foundation knows my location in this realm and has come to kill us all!\n\n\nSCP-8404 pinches the bridge of its nose.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Just a little peace in this place is all I wanted! \n(sigh)\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Wait, Midori, you know about us being in a simulation too?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n What in Hades\u2019 name is a simulation?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Like in a computer?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n That\u2019s not helping.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n We looked around and this place isn\u2019t right! It\u2019s been weeks and there\u2019s been strange stuff that\u2019s been going on with\u2013AH!\n\n\nCE-02-NS\u2019 model flickers with CE-01-IT\u2019s flickering soon after. They both strain in discomfort.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n This has been happening. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the world or us. We\u2019re not even sure what we are and we had to make sure you weren't suffering the same. We think you\u2019re the link to what\u2019s happening to us somehow.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n That\u2019s\u2026 impossible.\n\n\nSCP-8404 holds CE-02-NS\u2019 face in its hands, inspecting it. Its eyes widen.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midori?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n My magic had been alive since the beginning\u2026 at least in a diminished sense.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Magic?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n And you\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 inspects CE-01-IT\u2019s face, the flickering appears to intensify when SCP-8404 makes direct contact.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Oh my. Fascinating\u2026\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n What is?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You are\u2026 One of my own. Numbers. Life born from this facsimile. The very fabric of this world birthing new living beings. Incredible. No wonder you have such mastery over manipulating the materials of this realm.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What does that mean?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Wait Sumiko, when the three of us first met\u2026\n\n\nCE-01-IT holds its forehead.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n It\u2019s really hazy, but I remember, you claimed to be someone else. I-I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t occur to me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with my memory.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n I don\u2019t care about that! What did you mean by being born from whatever you just said?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n It was when you were given life most likely.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Midori what are you saying?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n You mean born?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Not necessarily.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midori, surely when we were outside the simulation we were born at some point right? Right?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Sumiko, I\u2019ve been thinking about what we are and our behaviour along with our inconsistent memories.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n No. Shut up. I don\u2019t want to hear it.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Sumiko\u2013\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n I DON\u2019T WANT TO HEAR IT!\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n I don\u2019t think we\u2019re human.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n No\u2026 no. W-we\u2019re humans! We eat, sleep, go to school and\u2026 Oh god\u2026\n\n\nCE-02-NS falls to its knees and holds its head in its hand.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n O-our families\u2026\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n They don\u2019t exist.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n We were never human.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Does it matter?\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Huh?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I was never human either.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n \n(sigh)\n I suppose I owe you an explanation. Midori was the name I was given when I entered this strange dream. My real name is Echidna, given to me millenia ago. I am a life giver.\n\n\nCE-01-IT and CE-02-NS stand in shock.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Millenia? What are you?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Some called me a goddess. I spit in that title. That damned pantheon and their offspring only ever gave me pain and humiliation. The only thing I despised more than the gods were the accursed humans. They gave me another title: Monster. The empires they went by always changed by the ages but they still pursued me. The Greeks, the Romans, the Crusaders, and now, the Foundation.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Are these the people who put us in this simulation?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n If you mean the realm we inhabit, then yes.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Who are these people?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Just humans. Just living beings that walk Gaea\u2019s earth. Some powerful magi are among them but it is the same old. They captured me and put me in this dream.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Wait, if you\u2019re this powerful person, why didn\u2019t you escape?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Upon entering this place, I was unfamiliar with its laws and my new body. My magic was hindered because of it.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n B-but now that we\u2019re all here, we can work together to get out of this place! You can show us the way out and we can help free each other!\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSCP-8404 looks at its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Why would I do that?\n\n\nCE-02-NS creases its brow.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n What?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n What is that supposed to mean?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n It\u2019s a simple answer.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n No it\u2019s not! We can\u2019t stay here! T-this place, we can\u2019t eat, we have to fear being erased, it\u2019s horrible!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I do not see a problem.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n How?!\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n If this Foundation people have trapped you here, isn\u2019t this supposed to be some kind of prison?\n\n\nSCP-8404 looks away, refusing to make eye contact with the CEs.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Why the hell won\u2019t you at least try? Or why the hell can\u2019t you see this crappy fake world for what it is?!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Why? WHY?! YOU DARE?!\n\n\nSCP-8404\u2019s model flickers. Its true form is visible for several frames.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Why? Why must I live in a world where I must be shunned from the rest of civilization? Cursed by the primordial existence, giving life to those around me only to have them see the same fate?!\n\n\nIt grits its teeth.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I have seen\u2026 so much life springing from the very soil I step on, the blood I bleed, the animals I look upon just for them to be snuffed out! Do I deserve this existence? I do not know. But them?! It\u2019s not FAIR!\n\n\nSCP-8404 breathes heavily.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Excuse me for wanting to escape such an accursed world. Excuse me for wanting to rest. That realm is better off without me and I without it!\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n I\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Why can\u2019t I just\u2026 go to school, chat with my best friends, fall asleep in class, and play games until the sun sets every day? Is it so evil of me to want to stay?! Because that is all I\u2019ve been labeled for my existence.\n\n\nThe flickering around SCP-8404\u2019s model ceases.\n\n\nTears drop down its face.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Would it be so bad for the two of you to stay with me?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midor- Echidna I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Maybe. But in the state that we are in, we cannot exist properly in this world. The last few weeks since finding out have been nothing short of torture.\n\n\nSCP-8404's eyes widen.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Oh. Is that why you came to me earlier? It was my fault\u2026 Gods. I am so sorry.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n It really has been hard.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I\u2019ve done it again. I\u2019ve cursed another being to share my own torturous existence. Damn it all, even here!\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Midori\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 chuckles.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You must hate me so much. To give you the \u2018gift' of life in such a counterfeit world. To taste the joys of being alive only for it to be ripped away in a second and be called false.\n\n\nSCP-8404 sighs.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n The humans were right to call me a monster.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n You can\u2019t be so\u2013\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Forget it.\n\n\nSCP-8404 snaps its fingers, the footage begins to distort and a large circular error in the simulation appears. The error flickers, the colours shifting but revealing a large unblinking reptilian eye, thaumaturgic symbols could be faintly seen at its edges. Akiva radiation spikes along SCP-8404\u2019s comatose body at this time as well.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I regained my magic in its full capacity weeks ago. I knew I was able to escape this place but did not need to. Step through this gateway and you will appear in the \u2018real\u2019 world. Although I cannot guarantee where you will be, it is the least I can do.\n\n\nSCP-8404 looks at CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n It seems that the two of you are better off without me as well.\n\n\nCE-02-NS slaps SCP-8404.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Sumiko!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Ow! You INSOLENT\u2013\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Answer this question \u2018goddess\u2019. If you\u2019re Echidna, then who is Midori? Was my best friend ever real?\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I\u2026\n\n\nThe feed flickers and a low hum is heard along with the audio.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Something is happening!\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION!\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n In a sense, Midori was never real. For a time, she was just the name that was forced upon me as I entered my prison. I resented that name. I believed it was the Foundation attempting to strip away everything I was.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Oh\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n But over time I learned to embrace her, being her. Midori is a small part of who I am but she is still me as I am she.\n\n\nThe white noise intensifies and the stability of the replay decreases further.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Names, I have in abundance, but Kato Midori? This name is the first name I have been given to mean something kind. It is attached to so many cherished memories. Memories that are very much real\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404 sobs.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n And I suppose that makes Midori real too.\n\n\nCE-02-NS hugs SCP-8404. It has tears in its eyes.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Kya! Sumiko!\n\n\nSCP-8404 covers its mouth but slowly lets go. It wraps its arms around CE-02-NS, returning the hug.\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n Then I could never hate you.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I-\n\n\nCE-01-IT hugs the two of them.\n\n\nSCP-8404 smiles.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You two\u2026\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n She\u2019s right.\n\n\nSCP-8404 closes its eyes.\n\n\nThe replay begins to glitch and show signs of instability.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I have never been able to create something large, intelligent, or kind enough to hug.\n\n\nThe three hug and remain in position for several seconds. It is unknown if this is a playback error.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I just\u2013I just wish that I cherished them more.\n\n\nSCP-8404 squeezes harder.\n\n\nSCP-8404 steps away.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I cannot leave the exit open for very long. Go while you still can.\n\n\nCE-01-IT:\n Right\u2026 Be safe. Take care.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n You too.\n\n\nCE-02-NS begins to sob.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Is something the matter?\n\n\nCE-02-NS:\n God I\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s so many things I wish we could have done. I wish we went to the beach together, I wish we all graduated together, I wish we could have done so much more together\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n But you will be happy.\n\n\nSCP-8404 breathes in. The Akiva radiation intensifies.\n\n\nWhite noise begins to disrupt the audio.\n\n\nCE-01-IT begins to cry.\n\n\nCE-02-NS begins to cry.\n\n\nSCP-8404 begins to cry.\n\n\nThe CEs step closer to the visual error. SIMULACRUM replay detects multiple errors.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n Tadashi, Sumiko!\n\n\nThey turn around.\n\n\nSCP-8404:\n I\u2026 cannot say for certain. B-but, I can swear on the name you cherish me by, I will do everything in my power to make sure this is not the last we see of each other!\n\n\nFootage becomes heavily distorted.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\n\nAt the time of recording, all SIMULACRUM systems experience a fatal error and go offline.\n\n\n[END REPLAY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\n\nCONTAINMENT BREACH ALERT:\n\n\nOn 10/7/2023, Containment Site-22 had reported a 7-minute outage in the simulation live feed. However, after the incident, the simulation resumed as per normal with SCP-8404 remaining in containment.\n\n\nAfter investigations into the SCP-8404 containment systems, it was discovered that two hard drives were missing from the local SIMULACRUM servers which contained NPC savedata. No breach in the site was reported and SCP-8404 remained in its containment chamber in a comatose state.\n\n\nInvestigation is ongoing and an auditor is to analyse the recent SIMULACRUM playbacks for suspicious activity on the part of SCP-8404.\n\n\nFurther updates pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
