The subject is to be provided with one gallon of goat's blood by no less than two D-class personnel on the first day of each month. Investigation into SCP-7254's origin remains ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7254 is a Tartarean entity of unclear classification, presently inhabiting the body of eight year old Abigail Burr.\n\n\nSCP-7254 exhibits most of the characteristics associated with possessive daemons - namely, unnatural strength, heightened resistance to injury, and insatiable appetite for human flesh. As determined through ectographic imaging techniques, SCP-7254's natural form is that of a tall chimeric humanoid typical of \nDaemonium vulgaris\n, possessing porcine\n1\n, corvine\n2\n and piscine\n3\n attributes. SCP-7254 has shown no ability to communicate whilst in Foundation custody (see Addendum).\n\n\nConventional methods of excising SCP-7254 have thus far been unsuccessful, though the subject remains in a heavily subdued state through a combination of defensive chants and runes. The \nDepartment of Mythology and Folkloristics\n has been tasked with consulting relevant historical sources for information regarding SCP-7254, under the presumption that uncovering its true name may grant the Foundation some degree of influence.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-7254 came to Foundation attention after killing 36 civilians at a compound belonging to a (now defunct) Christian sect known as the Fellowship of the True Faith, of which Burr's parents were recent initiates. A cover story was dispensed, stating the deaths to have been a case of mass suicide. Fellowship doctrine was noted for its unorthodox views on the nature of disease, attributing all physical ailments to daemonic possession.\n\n\nThree weeks prior to SCP-7254's manifestation, Abigail Burr was subject to trepanation\n4\n by Fellowship doctors. This was ostensibly in an effort to cure her epilepsy, with group prayer and herbal therapy having failed to mitigate her symptoms. There is no evidence to suggest that SCP-7254 was deliberately invoked: Foundation daemonologists have suggested that the entity may have become stranded in the material universe at some point in the past (likely the result of a failed summoning attempt), and gravitated towards Burr as her open skull cavity allowed ease of access to a living host.\n\n\nThe sole surviving church member was Dr. Anthony Harrigan, whose wife and son were both killed, and partially consumed in the attack. Dr. Harrigan, who was one of the physicians tasked with overseeing Burr's trepanation, later testified that in the midst of the massacre, speaking in coherent English, SCP-7254 personally thanked him.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
