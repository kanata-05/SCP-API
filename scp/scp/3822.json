    "all_text": "SCP-3822\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+15\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\nObject Class\n Da'aS Elyon\n1\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the size of SCP-3822, full containment is currently unfeasible. As a result of this, the following measures are to be maintained to ensure the safety of the populations of both Earth and its Moon, with security forces stationed at both SCP-3822-1 instances to ensure their execution:\n\n\n\n\nPassengers exiting SCP-3822 will be guided to the nearest SAMD\n2\n by STF Terra-1 (Earthbound Deltas) members.\n\n\nShould nothing be found during the scan, they will be placed in a quarantine cell within the basement of Earth's SCP-3822-1 instance for one week to be monitored and, if needed, treated for any disease they may have contracted on their travels.\n\n\nShould something be found during the scan, the passenger will be apprehended and be placed within a quarantine cell for one week. After exiting quarantine, they will face charges, varying on what was discovered.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3822 is an interplanetary railway constructed by the now defunct IPGA\n3\n in 2196 to help ease transportation to other planets, measuring over 5.37 million light-years in length. The system operated in both the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy, acting as a method of intergalactic trade. Since the organization's liquidation in 2235, the railway began exhibiting numerous anomalous properties.\n\n\nSince 2238, those riding on SCP-3822 do not age during their time on the train. Due to this property, numerous people have taken residence within SCP-3822. The IPF,\n4\nthe successor to the IPGA, who currently manage SCP-3822, is in the process of evicting and punishing those who are living within SCP-3822.\n\n\nSCP-3822 is capable of functioning without any external sources of fuel, preventing it from stopping unless it is turned off. As of this time, the source of its propulsion and energy is unknown.\n\n\nSCP-3822-1 is the designation for the stations which SCP-3822 stops at when reaching a planet or moon that was registered in the IPGA prior to its liquidation. There are anywhere between one and four SCP-3822-1 instances on each registered planet or moon, depending on their size. In the years since, the stations have been renovated multiple times to hold more individuals and have more efficient electrical and plumbing systems, with these modifications being made as technology has progressed.\n\n\nAddendum 3822.1:\n Experiment Log\n\nA series of tests were conducted involving SCP-3822 and its properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n\nOUTCOME\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fresh gala apple was placed in the cabin of SCP-3822.\n\n\nThe apple displayed no signs of rot or deterioration after one week.\n\n\nAfter results were noted, D-356524 was instructed to eat said apple. He displayed no effects from consuming it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fresh gala apple was placed in the cabin of SCP-3822.\n\n\nThe apple displayed no signs of rot or deterioration after several months.\n\n\nUpon being consumed by D-356524, he displayed no effects, but when he exited SCP-3822, he described a \"strange\" sensation within his stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Gallic rose (\nRose gallicanae\n) was placed in an APCC\n5\n unit located on SCP-3822.\n\n\nAfter several days without sunlight and water, the rose remained the same, showing no signs of wilting or dying.\n\n\nWithin 3 hours of exiting SCP-3822, the rose wilted and died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA four-month-old Eastern cottontail rabbit (\nSylvilagus floridanus\n) was placed in an APCC unit located on SCP-3822.\n\n\nAfter several weeks, it displayed no signs of aging or disease.\n\n\nAfter exiting SCP-3822, the rabbit was noted to be more susceptible to disease, contracting \nPasteurellosis\n and \nMyxomatosis\n. Its lifespan was not noticeably affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of the species \nHomo evelerre\n6\n captured during a raid on a illegal planetary refugee camp in the Sahara Desert was placed in an APCC located on SCP-3822.\n\n\n(Experiment still in progress)\n\n\n(Experiment still in progress)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the events of Addendum 3822.2, plans for testing the effects of SCP-3822 on human passengers have been indefinitely placed on hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3822.2:\n Incident Log\n\nOn December 7th, 2238, an incident involving Robert Bryson, a civilian who formerly resided on SCP-3822, occurred. The following is a log of surveillance camera footage taken from SCP-3822.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\nAn unknown passenger walks into one of SCP-3822's carts at the SCP-3822-1 instance on Mars. All the seats are full. Robert Bryson is noted to be taking up two seats while laying down. Onyx approaches him.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Excuse me, but can you maybe move? There's no other s-\n\n\nRobert Bryson sits down on one seat, leaving the other open, without looking from his phone.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unknown passenger examines the phone in Robert's hands.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n I'm sorry, but is that the actual iPhone 32? Do you know how rare those are?\n\n\nRobert turns and stares at the unknown passenger.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n What's an\u2026*\ncough\n* \"iPhone\"?\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Are you not from Earth?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n No. My parents are.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Never mind then. Where'd you find it?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Does it really matter?\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n To me, yes, it does.\n\n\nRobert examines the phone in his hands.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Why?\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n I'm an archaeologist. That right there is almost 100 years old. It belongs in a museum.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n It's mine.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Where'd you get it?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Can you please leave me\u2026 *\ncough\n* alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyx shifts in his chair.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n Sorry. For bothering you.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Don't be. It's fine.\n\n\nUnknown passenger:\n No, no, it's my fault.\n\n\nOnyx extends his hand towards Robert. Robert shakes it.\n\n\nOnyx:\n My name's Onyx.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I'm Robert. Onyx is a badass name.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Is it? My parents named me after some prehistoric bat. They didn't even spell it right.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Still a *\ncough\n* badass name.\n\n\nThey both laugh.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Nice to meet you.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Ditto.\n\n\nOnyx:\n So\u2026 where are you headed?\n\n\nRobert hesitates for a moment.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Everywhere yet nowhere.\n\n\nOnyx:\n \u2026\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I live on the train.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Oh. Ok.\n\n\nThe MLPAS\n7\n beeps.\n\n\nMLPAS Announcer:\n We will be arriving at the planet of Mars shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I know what you're thinking.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Huh?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n That a businessman like yourself should not be speaking to someone like me, someone who can't provide for himself.\n\n\nOnyx:\n What? No-\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I get it. It's fine. I'd probably think the same if I was in your position.\n\n\nOnyx opens his mouth to speak, but does not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyx again shifts uneasily in his seat.\n\n\nOnyx:\n If you don't mind me asking, why are you here. I mean, what led to you being in\u2026 this situation?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Cowardice and -\n\n\nRobert coughs multiple times.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n greed. The two flaws of mankind. I was once an ambitious man, like *\ncough\n* yourself. I lusted for power. Hungered for it. Ran a company on Titan long ago. I was constantly trying to find ways to grow it, experimenting with the anomalous, digging in places I shouldn't have, until the shovel finally hit a pipe and burst. Everything else came too fast: controversy, defamation, corruption, betrayal\u2026 murder, next thing you know I'm here. Hiding away, *\ncough\n* repenting.\n\n\nOnyx:\n What are you afraid of then?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Myself.\n\n\nOnyx:\n \u2026 Why?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I\u2026 don't know. I'm just afraid that\u2026. that I'll\u2026 never mind. I don't mean to vent at you.\n\n\nOnyx:\n No it's\u2026 okay. Sometimes you just have to let it all go. We're all afraid of something.\n\n\nThe MLPAS beeps.\n\n\nMLPAS:\n Now arriving on Mars. Please stand clear of the gates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyx is visibly zoned out.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\nI lied.\n\n\nOnyx flinches.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Hmm?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I lied.\n\n\nOnyx:\n About what? To m-\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I'm not afraid of myself. I'm afraid of death. That's why I'm here. Not because I'm hiding away. Because I'm a *\ncough\n* coward.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Well, exactly how long have you been here?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Months. Years. I've lost track of time. I know what I'm doing is illegal, but what else do you want me to do? Sit around and wait for me to *\ncough\n* die? Then what? What happens after?\n\n\nOnyx pauses for a moment, with a confused expression.\n\n\nOnyx:\n I\u2026 don't know.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Outside this train, there are timers above everyone's heads. Tick, tick, ticking away. Waiting until they can drown their next victim. I don't want to be a victim. I don't want to die. I don't want to die.\n\n\nRobert brings both of his hands through his hair and then puts his face in them.\n\n\nOnyx stares at the floor for several moments.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Don't you ever want to be at peace?\n\n\nRobert looks at Onyx with a confused expression.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I don't follow.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Hmm. How do I explain th- Oh.\n\n\nOnyx clears his throat.\n\n\nOnyx:\n \"We all die. The goal isn't to live forever, but to create something that will.\" That's a quote my mother told me before she passed. Dying isn't about who you were or the power you had. It's about what you've left behind. If you don't die, you can never have the peace of knowing that you did something, anything, with your life. What happens after is peace.\n\n\nRobert stares blankly at Onyx.\n\n\nOnyx:\n I'll ask again. Don't you ever want to be at peace? To know that you've accomplished something before you pass on.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n \u2026 Yes.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Good. Now I think it's time you face your fear.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Sorry, but wha-\n\n\nOnyx:\n Shhh. You'll see.\n\n\nMLPAS:\n We will shortly be arriving on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Thank you. Thank you for this.\n\n\nOnyx:\n No problem. Y'know you aren't the only one keeping secrets here.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Huh?\n\n\nOnyx:\n I've known why you were here since the beginning.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Are you\u2026 what?\n\n\nOnyx:\n Robert, I understand how loss can cause people do to\u2026 questionable things. I'm not here to apprehend you. I'm here to help you. To \"heal\" you.\n\n\nRobert stands up.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I don't understand\u2026 why?\n\n\nOnyx:\n Because you're you. You're special, even if you might not know it.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n What? How do yo-\n\n\nOnyx:\n Don't worry, your secret's safe with us.\n\n\nRobert stares an Onyx for several moments with a confused and shocked expression.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Now are you ready or not?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I\u2026 I am\u2026 Yes, I am.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Was that hesitation I heard?\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n I'm ready.\n\n\nMLPAS:\n Now arriving on Earth. Please stand clear of the gates.\n\n\nOnyx:\n That's our cue.\n\n\nOnyx stands up from his chair. He gestures at the doors to Robert. Robert stares at them with a bleak expression.\n\n\nOnyx:\n Trust me, it's ok to feel scared, but I know you can do it.\n\n\nRobert takes a deep breath. SCP-3822's doors open and several other passengers in the cart leave. He stares at it for several moments before walking towards it. He hesitantly steps out of the cart and into Earth's SCP-3822-1 and turns around to look at Onyx, who is no longer there.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n \u2026 Onyx?\n\n\nRobert's body suddenly begins to rot, starting as his foot. He looks down at his feet. Civilians around him begin to scream and stare at him.\n\n\nRobert Bryson:\n Fuck. No, no, no, no, no-\n\n\nRobert's skin begins to pale, and he begins becoming thinner. Eventually, his skin begins to flake and disintegrate, while Robert's teeth have notably more stains on them. Within several minutes, Robert's cadaver has entirely decomposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation into the identity of \"Onyx\" is ongoing.\n8\n Usage of SCP-3822 on Earth has been prohibited until it is confirmed it is safe to use through testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
