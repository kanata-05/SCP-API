And remnants of the anomalous temporal device have been retrieved and are being studied to determine its origin in both manufacturing and time period. While remnants of the device have been retrieved, approximately only 46% of it has been determined to be in custody. Foundation archaeologists are presently still locating the remaining pieces of the time machine, and the possible operator of the device.\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n\nAfter further anomalous temporal examination, the area where SCP-6783 was discovered seems to have its own anomalous temporal or evolutionary properties.\n\n\nResearch into whether or not the temporal device has anything to do with it is ongoing. It should be noted that during the Proterozoic Era, no trees or animals were present. However, evidence shows flora and fauna appearing within the range of SCP-6783.\n\n\nThe anomalous \u201cEvolution Space\u201d dubbed by Foundation researchers caused biological evolution to rapidly progress.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nThe following file is Level 4/6783 classified. Unauthorized access is forbidden.\n\n\n\n\n6783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[INPUT\u00a0LEVEL\u00a04/6783\u00a0SECURITY\u00a0CREDENTIALS].\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[CREDENTIALS\u00a0APPROVED]\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-6783\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nSafe\n Neutralized\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\n\nAbove all else: Dr. Evelyn Moore is to never view this document under any circumstances. If Dr. Moore does discover the true nature of SCP-6783, she is to be administered Class B amnestics to remove all details of SCP-6783. This particular procedure is only relevant until \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 when she is determined to vanish.\n\n\nAll and any unauthorized documentations of the true nature of SCP-6783 are to be replaced with falsified information like the false document above. If Dr. Moore requests access to SCP-6783, she is to be given the false document.\n\n\nDiscoveries about the true nature of the \u201cBoring Billion\u201d are to be replaced with false information and researchers that took part in the discovery are to be administered Class B amnestics.\n\n\nResearch into other temporal anomalies similar to SCP-6783 is currently being conducted.\n\n\nDevelopments for a meme to persuade viewers of SCP-6783 not to view the document are currently in progress.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-6783 is a series of notes from Foundation researcher Dr. Evelyn Moore, designated SCP-6783-1, from approximately 1.8 billion years ago. This has been confirmed by anachronistic anomalies that have landed in Foundation custody.\n\n\nEvelyn Moore, as of the moment compiling this information is a Level 3 researcher and part of Project: Centureic, an effort to develop a viable way of temporal transportation through anomalous means and without the negative side effects. Project: Centureic has been designated as SCP-6783-2.\n\n\nAccording to information from SCP-6783, precisely on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. Moore will be the victim of a temporal anomaly while working on Project: Centureic and be transported to the Proterozoic Era.\n\n\nFurther examination suggests that SCP-6783-2\u2019s anomalous qualities had completely halted biological evolution for approximately 1 billion years when first landing. Furthermore, it seemed to have dramatically slowed or stopped Dr. Moore\u2019s aging process altogether.\n\n\nOngoing searches for SCP-6783-1\u2019s notes are in progress. So far, approximately 67% of the notes have been retrieved and the majority redacted for present Dr. Moore\u2019s sake.\n\n\nAddendum-1:\n\nAn incident report appeared on the desk of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, head of Project: Centureic, containing information of the incident that would be Dr. Moore\u2019s fate. The report was confirmed to be written by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, however, they don\u2019t recall writing it.\n\n\nIncident Report 6783-1:\n\nOn \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSpacetime anomaly appeared in the testing chamber of Project: Centureic upon activation of the device. SCP-6783-1 along with the device was engulfed in the spacetime anomaly.\n\n\nDr. Moore is presumed dead.\n\n\nNotes: Presumably the anachronistic copy of the incident report was sent back in time to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s desk during the incident.\n\n\nAddendum-2:\n\nDuring an archaeological dig at [REDACTED], a notebook with the Foundation insignia on the front cover was discovered and contents were salvaged for examination.\n\n\nMany of the pages were unintelligible and unreadable presumably because of either age or erosion over the course of its burial. Carbon dating and anomalous temporal examination date it to 1.8 billion years ago.\n\n\nArchaeological Site-101 was established in the area where SCP-6783 was discovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0SCP-6783\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accessing\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-1:\n\n\nThis is Dr. Evelyn Moore, I am a Level 4 researcher for the SCP Foundation and stationed at Site-\u2588\u2588. If you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019ve either rescued me and are going to document the incident of what I can only assume is some sort of spacetime anomaly. Or you\u2019re reading these in the future and I\u2019m \ndead.\n Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the former.\n\n\nI\u2019m writing to whoever reads this that Project: Centureic was an unfortunate failure and when the time comes, no pun intended, that you can stop me from going through. I sure hope you do, and that my husband will be able to see me again and vice versa.\n\n\nI haven\u2019t exactly pinpointed my location yet, or even when I am, it\u2019s definitely before the Foundation. Way before, there\u2019s nothing but an open field here along with trees and a mountain range I can see in the distance. Project: Centureic is busted at the moment, so it can\u2019t tell me the time period I\u2019m in, but I suspect around 100 years ago perhaps, maybe a bit farther.\n\n\nI would say the area is serene enough for me to relax, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about how I\u2019m gonna get back home.\n\n\nI will document whatever I can. I\u2019m gonna try and relax.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-2:\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, it\u2019s been about a week since I got here and wrote, luckily Project: Centureic is still able to log how long it\u2019s been. Speaking of which, yesterday I managed to do minor repairs on the machine and it\u2019s currently calculating the time period I\u2019m in. It\u2019s taking a long time, kinda getting worried.\n\n\nAnother thing to note, I walked around for a couple of days and I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of animals. Life still exists, at least plants do, but I see no sign of fauna around me.\n\n\nIt\u2019s quiet\n\n\nI took a sample, and I\u2019m going to try and preserve it in the Time Box. Another thing to note is that I\u2019ve started to call Project: Centureic the \u201cTime Box\u201d, though it would keep my spirits up and make me feel like one of those adventurers that travel through time. I feel like Doctor Who, except more lost.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder if they\u2019ll ever find me. I\u2019m gonna take a nap and sleep it off. Luckily the Time Box has enough space inside for it, no mattress or sheets though. It\u2019s gonna be a long night.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-3:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, still no sign of animals, the silence is unsettling. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t really \u201cspoken\u201d in about 3 weeks. No point to it since there\u2019s nothing to talk to. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m eventually gonna go crazy, it\u2019s been so long.\n\n\nI\u2019ve noticed something else while being here, I haven\u2019t felt hunger or thirst while here. I can still eat and drink though, I tried, but I don\u2019t feel like I need to eat. I wonder if the Time Box has anything to do with it, and if it does, I wonder what else it\u2019s affected.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-4:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, it\u2019s been about two months, I haven\u2019t written in a while. I was trying to get my mind off the situation right now, the machine-finished calculating when I am.\n\n\nAccording to it, I\u2019m in the Protezoeic Era, basically 1.8 billion years in the past.\n\n\n1.8 billion years from home.\n\n\nI don\u2019t feel like writing right now.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-5:\n\n\nEvelyn here, I walked into the woods and just kinda sat there for a long time. That\u2019s all.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-6:\n\n\nThis is Evelyn, I walked back to the woods, this time I stayed longer and I think I\u2019ve come to a few conclusions.\n\n\nOne thing, apparently my sense of time has been messed up, I was in those woods for a long time apparently. Like REALLY long, I was in there for 5 years.\n\n\nAnother thing to note is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m aging, or I\u2019m just doing it really slow. Something tells me I\u2019m in it for the long haul.\n\n\nSecondly, I remembered something about the Proterozoic Era that my husband Eric told me, that evolution for some reason completely halted and nothing happened for a billion years, hence the Boring Billion.\n\n\nThe only form of life would be eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, which got me thinking.\n\n\nhow is there a woods?\n\n\nI need to think for a bit. Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-7:\n\n\nEvelyn here, the weirdest thing happened when I woke up. I heard birds.\n\n\nThere are no animals\n\n\nI looked outside, and there on one of the trees was a prehistoric-looking bird.\n\n\n[Dr. Moore drew a crude image of the bird onto the page]\n\n\nFrom what I can ascertain, it\u2019s an archaeopteryx\n2\n\n, which won\u2019t appear for another billion years or so. So that means either the machine is wrong and I\u2019m not a billion years in the past and are somewhere in the Tithonian era, or something is causing evolution to jumpstart.\n\n\nI\u2019m a scientist, I need to find out. It\u2019s in my blood.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-8:\n\n\nEvelyn here.\n\n\nOkay, I may not have the equipment I had back in the Foundation, but I was also an engineer. I managed to build a makeshift lab using spare parts from the Time Box to analyze what the hell is going here.\n\n\nAfter some failed experiments and a few accidents, I saw something amazing. After fighting that bird for about an hour for its feather and looking at it closer I saw that its cells were rapidly evolving at an extraordinary rate. Millions of years in a month.\n\n\nI guessed that after I walked into the woods, things were left alone long enough to evolve some more.\n\n\nOh and speaking of the woods, I took a closer look at one of the trees after cutting it with a makeshift saw for a long time and saw it only had 5 rings.\n\n\nI checked with a few more trees in different areas of the forest and saw the same result. I was in there for five years, so it makes sense why they would have rings, but does that mean that they grew when I landed?\n\n\nI\u2019ll do some more research, Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-9:\n\n\nOkay, it\u2019s been a couple of months since I did a personal entry, some of my research overtook space in the notebook, but I have some discoveries and conclusions to document.\n\n\nIt turns out, not only the Time Box is causing things to rapidly evolve, but it also causes them to age quickly. For some reason, not me, but when I went to check on the tree trunk sample again, it had grown 10 rings a day after I brought it in.\n\nNot everything around me is affected by the Time Box, I trekked for a bit in a mile or so and found out that when you exit the 1-mile radius, evolution is barely happening at all. Still barren. I concluded that the Time Box has a certain range that can affect evolution and aging. I call this range the \u201cEvolution Space.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t ascertained how fast it evolves and how strong it gets closer to the Time Box yet, but I have a feeling that it may be a decade every day within the machine.\n\nThe most depressing conclusion I\u2019ve come to is that, while this is beautiful, I don\u2019t think the Foundation is coming for me.\n\n\nI can\u2019t let that stop me from figuring out all of this. Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-10:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, it\u2019s been a long time since I last wrote. I took a piece of the Time Box, or a part of the main power source with me to do a field test.\n\n\nThe heart of the box is a Tachyon Superfluid Drive or TSD. In layman's terms, the TSD manipulates the superfluidity of spacetime to allow rifts in the universe to transport us to timelines.\n\n\nThe creation of the TSD was the basis of Project: Centureic, it may have also been a colossal failure due to the fact I was sent back in time and all that.\n\n\nAnyways, I took one of the TSDs with me and trekked far away from the box for a long time. Long enough for me to test its effects on nature. On that note, another anomalous effect the box had on me was apparently my sense of time is warping even more than when I first noticed. What I thought was a few hours, turned out to be a few weeks. Days turn to months and so on. When I came back from my field test, over a decade had passed already.\n\n\nAs for the field test, I attached a test log on the next page for you when this book gets recovered.\n\n\nI\u2019ve started to look at the bright side, at least I won\u2019t notice how much time passes. Maybe I can just wait it out. I\u2019m gonna go do some more te-\n\n\n[Dr. Moore suddenly stops writing, a streak from the pencil appears on the page. Supposedly something interrupted her.\n\n\nTesting Logs From SCP-6783:\n\n\nTest A\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Acorn from a nearby tree.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Acorn was buried approximately 5 meters away from TSD\n\n\nResults:\n In approximately 10 hours, a fully grown tree had been produced. Appearance resembles an ash tree.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Why the TSD had made it an ash tree when the acorn I harvested was completely different is beyond me. I hypothesize that the \u201cEvolution Space\u201d that the TSD creates also genetically mutates whatever evolves and grows. This implies a myriad of different possibilities.\n\n\n\n\nTest B\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Angiosperm samples\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n Placed approximately 1 meter from the TSD\n\n\nResults:\n Various flowers started to sprout and spread around the TSD, including the flower species Montsechia vidalii in the span of 3 hours\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Angiosperm is how flowers evolve and spread, there were many theories that dinosaurs may have eaten angiosperm and spread it around to evolve it. I think I just created the first flower, which is exciting.\n\n\n\n\nTest C\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nProcedure:\n Item placed 1 inch from the TSD for [REDACTED]\n\n\nResults:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Evolution is powerful, and there are some things we shouldn\u2019t mess with. Whatever just happened there took a week to kill and took me another week to recover from its venom. I\u2019m eating its remains tonight.\n\n\n\n\nI am never doing that again. On another note, next time I go out for a field test, bring some weapons.\n\n\nDr. Moore\u2019s Notes: Something had occurred to me while doing tests, the subjects all evolved rapidly when in close proximity to the TSD. So what\u2019s happening to me?\n\n\nI carried this all the way out here, I\u2019m around it all hours of the day and I even slept near it, back in the Time Box too. I wonder if it\u2019s been affecting me as well?\n\n\nTest D\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Dr. Evelyn Moore\n\n\nProcedure:\n Stationed on top of the TSD for several weeks.\n\n\nResults:\n No changes found\n\n\nAnalysis:\n I\u2019ve determined that whatever caused my anomalous eternal youth is also preventing me from evolving biologically.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-11:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, God that took a long time, sorry about that. For context, while I was gone, one of the animals apparently stuck around for a while and it turned into a dinosaur. I don\u2019t even know how that happened, maybe this Evolution Space is more anomalous than I previously thought. I definitely need more defenses, or at least find a way to stop dinosaurs attacking me.\n\n\nI\u2019m gonna go lie down to recover from the apparent dinosaur assault. Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-12:\n\n\nYou bastards. You knew. You\u2019ve always known. I don't know how long, and I don\u2019t care, you knew.\n\n\nI woke up like usual and made myself a meal, I didn't need to eat, I just did it so I can have some resemblance to my old life. While I was eating, it clicked in my brain. Something finally made sense.\n\n\nSCP-6783, I\u2019m it aren\u2019t I?\n\n\n\u201cNotes from a billion years ago\u201d all that bullshit, you always knew I was gonna go back huh? That this entire mess would happen. It always confused me whenever I read the SCP-6783 file, why was it so simple? Why was it so important? Now I know, you gave me a fucking fake.\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you stop me? Did you want this to happen? I can\u2019t believe that the Foundation just sat back and watched as I built the machine that would destroy my life.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI think I get it now, you\u2019re the most powerful organization in the whole world with numbers in the millions. You don\u2019t save lives, you make sure you keep existing even at the cost of your own blood.\n\n\nYou \nsecure\n. You \ncontain\n. You \nprotect\n.\n\n\nBut when it comes to things like this, you\u2019d watch from afar and see what happens, and make note of it for future use. That\u2019s science. You secure, contain, and protect all you want and there are thousands of us dying to whatever we\u2019re containing and no one else will ever know.\n\n\nWe die in the dark, so you can live in the light.\n\n\nI\u2019m done here, Moore signing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Testing\u00a0Logs\u00a0From\u00a0SCP-6783\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accessing\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-3:\n\n\nMany of SCP-6783-1\u2019s notes were recovered after her supposed fallout with the Foundation, she seemed to have kept writing in her journal about her findings, perhaps as a way to keep herself sane or for the sake of stimuli.\n\n\nAfter a certain number of pages, the notes start to get incoherent and nonsensical. It was determined SCP-6783-1 started to write in a cryptogram to hide her research, perhaps as a way to spite the Foundation and impede our research.\n\n\nOptions to have present-day SCP-6783-1 decode it has been denied on the precedent that she might become suspicious.\n\n\nFoundation cryptologists were tasked to decode SCP-6783-1's notes, this proved difficult as SCP-6783-1 developed more cryptograms to impede research more. Researchers have been able to decrypt approximately 5% of the recovered instances of SCP-6783.\n\n\nA majority of SCP-6783-1's notes are still encrypted and efforts to decode them are still in effect.\n\n\nDecrypted Testing Logs from SCP-6783:\n\n\nTest E\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Two unknown species of fish\n\n\nProcedure:\n One fish was placed in a container of room temperature water. The other fish was placed in an identical container, but the temperature was drastically lowered using Project: Centureic\u2019s liquid nitrogen cooling system. Both containers were placed approximately 2 meters away from Project: Centureic.\n\n\nResults:\n The fish in the room temperature water evolved normally and grew to an adult fish in a matter of minutes. The fish in the frigid water aged the same, however, it seemed to have evolved to resist the colder climates after an autopsy.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Biodiversity wished it could be this good, quick evolution for the fish to adapt to the cold climates without having to go through natural selection.\n\n\n\n\nTest F\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n Nearby tree\n\n\nProcedure:\n Had animals eat pieces of the leaves and place a TSD 5 meters away while being eaten for approximately 3.4 minutes.\n\n\nResults:\n The tree had evolved into a Cycas Revoluta. Fauna consuming the tree reduced greatly.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n As expected, the Evolution Space had influenced the tree to evolve into a Cycas Revoluta.\n\n\n\n\nTest G\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n A third fish\n\n\nProcedure:\n Placed a TSD 1 meter next to it for approximately 10 minutes.\n\n\nResults:\n The subject grew legs and walked on land\n\n\nAnalysis:\n It\u2019s incredible, I caused the evolution of land animals. It never occurred to me that this would happen. I had to wait a couple of centuries though to make sure I don\u2019t mess anything up, but it\u2019s amazing to think this little guy would become a dinosaur one day.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nOn that note, I should move the TSD away now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Further\u00a0SCP-6783\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accessing\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-13:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, I know what I said, but I came back for a reason.\n\n\nIt seems I have been given a responsibility. For context, I examined the area and cellular life outside the Evolution Space and found something disturbing.\n\n\nMost likely when I landed here, evolution had completely stopped. Not just here, but the whole planet. Not only am I the cause of evolution happening, but I also caused the \u201cBoring Billion\u201d.\n\n\nWhen I landed, the temporal properties must\u2019ve halted the evolutionary line. All life on Earth just stopped growing, I determined that the Evolution Space is a sort of reset zone for the evolutionary halt, but also acts as a speed boost.\n\n\nWhen something enters the Evolution Space, it negates the effects caused by the Time Box\u2019s initial landing. So that means one thing if life is to exist on Earth, and for humanity to also exist, I need to find a way to expand the Evolution Space and hopefully counteract its negative effects.\n\n\nDon\u2019t think I\u2019m doing this for the Foundation, I\u2019m doing this for my husband, for my family, and all of humanity. You\u2019re just lucky to be a part of it.\n\n\nI still don\u2019t forgive you. Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-14:\n\n\nI tried fixing the Time Box\u2019s mobility units, no luck. I also tried attaching animals to it and trying to pull it like a chariot, they evolved and broke free to kill me. I had to kill them first, I may be eternally young, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fully immortal.\n\n\nAfter many other failed attempts, I came up with a different solution. I made makeshift wheels, a pulley system, and placed the Time Box on top of the wheels to make it into a sort of cart. I decided the only way to do my mission is to pull it myself.\n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long walk\u2026\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-15:\n\n\nEvelyn here, I\u2019m gonna start my expedition soon, but first I should explain the plan.\n\n\nI can\u2019t find any way to remotely reverse the effects Project: Centureic caused. The only plausible way to actually reverse it in my current situation is to expose every square inch of the Earth\u2019s surface to the Evolution Space. The only way to do that is manually, so I made a makeshift cart to put the Time Box in and I\u2019m gonna pull it all over the Earth.\n\n\nIt sounds tedious and inefficient, but it\u2019s the best I got. I can\u2019t enlist animals since they\u2019ll rapidly evolve into [DATA EXPUNGED], so it\u2019s up to me.\n\n\nThis will be my last entry for a while, I need to keep moving so things don't get out of control. Everything from the landing site is already anomalous enough, we don\u2019t want it to get out of hand.\n\n\nI still don\u2019t forgive the Foundation for what they\u2019ve done, but I hope I can accept your choices. I\u2019ve already accepted I\u2019m stuck here, maybe I can evolve to forgive you.\n\n\nOne day.\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, signing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum-4\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accessing\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-4:\n\n\nFoundation archaeologists managed to locate the remnants of SCP-6783-2. 78% of the machinery according to the schematics brought back to the past has been designated as missing or destroyed. No explanation has been given as to why due to the fact the Tachyon Superfluid Drive, now designated SCP-6783-3, was functioning as intended from SCP-6783-1s notes, the degradation of SCP-6783-2 should have lasted the allotted time frame it was in.\n\n\nAdditionally, while SCP-6783-1\u2019s notes were found close to SCP-6783-2, the remains of SCP-6783-1\u2019s have yet to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 5/6783 CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 5/6783 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Input\u00a0Level\u00a05\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Credentials\u00a0Accepted\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-5:\n\nThe remnants of Dr. Evelyn Moore were located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 with the remains of her notebook that contain more contents of SCP-6783.\n\n\nThe last pages detail her final days and what happened to SCP-6783-2.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-16:\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been, but all I know is that dinosaurs started appearing everywhere. I guess I did my mission right. I deactivated the TSD so it stops, I\u2019m gonna wait a few thousand years in this cave to make sure evolution is continuing normally. I\u2019ll update you all when I can.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-17:\n\n\nOH MY GOD.\n\n\nTHIS IS DR. MOORE, THE DINOSAURS JUST DISAPPEARED. I SWEAR TO YOU, I WOKE UP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY\u2019RE DEAD.\n\n\nThere was no meteor, there was no sound, I checked the Time Box, and apparently, I just skipped over 61000 YEARS IN ONE NIGHT. WHAT THE HELL? THEY JUST UP AND VANISHED.\n4\n\n\nWhy did it have to be me? Why was I the one who had to go back in time? Does the universe despise me so much that I have to witness the birth of nature as a form of punishment? I must\u2019ve been terrible in a past life to deserve this.\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, going to take a long nap.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-18:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, oh my God, I was walking around after the whole dinosaur thing. I apparently was asleep for a while, and I just spotted some humans near me, primitive and they\u2019re all just corralled in a cave. I think this is a hunter-gatherer society I stumbled upon.\n\n\nDid I cause them? Was I responsible for the evolution of man? This is a little much for me, but I won\u2019t approach them, just in case they accidentally worship me as a god or something and mess up the future.\n\n\nI'm seeing something strange right now as I write this. I\u2019ll get a closer look and get back to you. Dr. Moore signing off for now.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-19:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, I found something incredible, I believe I found SCP-1000\n5\n or the first generation of it at least.\n\n\nI\u2019m hiding in the cave right now making sure they don\u2019t see me, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve risen to power just yet. They still seem very primitive, I wonder if I can witness them evolve to how the report describes them. I'll need to observe more carefully.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI just came back from observing the instance of SCP-1000, I couldn't stay long because I thought they saw me so I escaped. On the bright side, I can confirm that it is definitely SCP-1000. I noticed that they looked at the primitive humans for a long time before leaving. SCP-1000 never interacted with them and instead just avoided them, almost as if it were scared.\n\n\nI will try to be a lot more careful the next time I spy on SCP-1000. Dr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-20:\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, it\u2019s been a long time, maybe a thousand years. I just realized that I\u2019ve been saying that a lot nonchalantly, but I\u2019ve had a few close calls with SCP-1000. Every time they come close to the cave, I try to close up the cave with a boulder.\n\n\nI made a pulley system to close the cave entrance using a pull of a vine. I didn\u2019t get a doctorate in engineering just by being decent. This is going to be a temporary home until both the humans and SCP-1000 leave the area. I feel like I\u2019m going to be here for a while.\n\n\nSpeaking of which, I studied the behavior of SCP-1000 some more. I found this spot where I could observe them in secret and I noted a few things.\n\n\nWhenever SCP-1000 had a clear line of sight of the primitive humans, it would normally observe them as I do in a secluded area where the humans wouldn't notice. But usually, if a human happens to approach the area SCP-1000 is watching, it would back off and escape. This time was different, an instance of SCP-1000 approached a group of humans, but the humans were the ones who backed off this time. SCP-1000 seemed to have noticed this and continued to pester the humans.\n\n\nLuckily one of the humans approached SCP-1000 and appeared hostile, that's when the instance of SCP-1000 backed off. Something tells me that this won't be the last time SCP-1000 will provoke the humans. I'll document whatever I can.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off for now.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-21:\n\n\nBAD NEWS\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore, and something terrible happened.\n\n\nI went out to go study the SCP-1000 instances more without being spotted, I wasn\u2019t caught, but when I came back Project: Centureic was missing!\n\n\nI don\u2019t know who stole it, but I have my suspicions. They managed to figure out how to move the door, and I\u2019ve determined that they brought a group to lift the Time Box. If they figure out how to work the TSD, we\u2019re fucked. I need to go find them.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-22:\n\n\nDr. Moore here, I know the truth now. I knew SCP-1000 stole Project: Centureic, but I know why now. I don\u2019t know if the Foundation knew, something tells me they didn\u2019t until they found my notes, but it's very clear now.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of decades, I managed to track them down.\n\n\nThey were using the TSD and the machinery from Project: Centureic to build their society.\n\n\nI hypothesize that the long-term exposure to the now reactivated TSD had evolved their brains to modern human capacities. Once they gained enough intelligence, SCP-1000 managed to reverse engineer the machinery from Project: Centureic and use the Evolution Space produced by it to hyper-evolved the flora and fauna around them to utilize nature as the file described.\n\n\nIf I\u2019m recalling correctly, humanity should eradicate them soon. I just need to wait for more.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-23:\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time, maybe a century, and nothing yet. Maybe It\u2019s a lot later than I thought?\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-24:\n\n\nStill waiting, I realized I didn\u2019t write much last time since I was just waiting, but I should mention that SCP-1000 has mastered transportation using hyper-evolved animals.\n\n\nAlso, a thought occurred. Why would they fence off the humans? Are they zoo animals to them? Are they too scared?\n\n\nCould it be they realize that the device they used to evolve themselves, can also be used to evolve the humans? Do they fear that humans could evolve? Evolve past them?\n\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting thought.\n\n\nThe Evolution Space is a powerful anomaly, it will eventually run out of power, but by then they would have evolved past it. I also have a hypothesis of why it hasn\u2019t changed them as it did to [DATA EXPUNGED] all those millennia ago. The TSD only has so much power, and a majority was used to fix the mess Project: Centureic made 1 billion years ago.\n\n\nThe less power it has, the slower that the Evolution Space affects living things. Eventually, it will run out of power, but they won\u2019t need it anymore. The rate they\u2019re going, they should be beyond modern humans in about a decade. I don\u2019t understand why the humans haven\u2019t done anything yet.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nMaybe they need a push, it\u2019s risky, but I have no other choice.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-25:\n\n\nI approached a group of the humans in the forest, they seemed scared by my outfit from the future. I tried to reassure them I\u2019m not a threat, but they ran off. This is gonna be difficult.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-26:\n\n\nOkay, I managed to convince a smaller group to listen to me in the forest.\n\n\nSide note: I stole some of the tools from SCP-1000, in hopes to teach them how to use them.\n\n\nThey don\u2019t speak any languages, but I was able to interpret using gestures and pictures. I\u2019m going to teach them how to use the tools tomorrow. I need to rest for now.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-27:\n\n\nI noticed something when I woke up, my skin was wrinkly. I think time is finally catching up. I don\u2019t know why, but I need to hurry.\n\n\nI\u2019ll be back once I finish teaching them.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI was thinking, the story from SCP-1000 about how humanity revolted. I wonder if I was the cause? Maybe it was best for me to go back.\n\n\nOn another note, lessons with the humans are going well, which is good since SCP-1000 had just mastered aerial transportation.\n\n\nHopefully, I manage to teach them enough before time catches up with me.\n\n\nDr. Moore signing off.\n\n\nSCP-6783 Log-???:\n\n\nThis is Dr. Moore\u2019s final message.\n\n\nThe humans have started to teach each other. Soon they\u2019re going to be able to revolt and cause an SK-Class-Dominance-Shift-Scenario.\n\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m barely able to write, my skin is becoming grey and wrinkly. My hands are bony, my hair is white. I can feel the ages catching up to me, why it just started I have no idea, but I had enough time to help humans.\n\n\nBefore I die, I want to get a few things out there.\n\n\nEric my love, I\u2019m sorry. Our time was short, but it was for the best. I hope when I\u2019m gone, you move on and find love again.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the head of Project: Centureic, thank you for being one of my best friends in the Foundation. Try not to get killed out there.\n\n\nAs for the SCP Foundation. I forgive you all. I can die knowing why this happened. Make sure I never find out the true nature of SCP-6783 until my time comes. No matter what I say, she will eventually be at peace with her destiny.\n\n\nI can die peacefully in the dark, knowing that humanity can live in the light.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nDr. Evelyn Moore, signing off for the last time.\n\n\nAddendum-5:\n\nMany of SCP-6783-1's notes have been determined to be missing. The notes on how Dr. Moore was able to teach the primitive humans, further tests, and further experiences in the past have either not been recovered or have been archived elsewhere from this document. Missing instances of SCP-6783 are currently being searched for.\n\n\nFinding new notes might shed some light on the nature of SCP-6783 and the experiences Dr. Moore had during the time she had been trapped in the past. It may also reveal where the missing parts of SCP-6783-2 may be located, in hopes for the Foundation to salvage to possibly rebuild the device at a later date.\n\n\nThe capabilities of SCP-6783-3 in producing the \"Evolution Space\" may be reverse-engineered to aid the Foundation in some way. Though rudimentary in evolving living things, a way to refine it may be possible.\n\n\nOne note was found sometime after Dr. Moore's final message to the future:\n\n\n\"The flowers are blooming Eric, they look beautiful\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Final\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accessing\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-6:\n\n\nThe recovered cadaver of Evelyn Moore is to be preserved in Archaeological Site-101 and kept hidden away from present Dr. Moore.\n\n\nA false missing person case is to be fabricated in the event of present Dr. Moore's eventual disappearance. The future corpse will be relocated to a nearby area of Dr. Moore's residence to be given a proper burial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage from O5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6783\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6783 is unique. It is the fact we know the fate of Evelyn Moore, and we must keep it a secret from her. If it seems unethical to keep her in the dark, you must remember what is at stake. If Dr. Moore does not go back in time, she can never help humanity become the dominant species. To ensure our existence, we must cast aside the sympathy for her and let nature take its course.\n\n\nRemember what she sacrificed for us, for humanity.\n\n\nShe died in the dark, so we can live in the light.\n\n\n\u2014 O5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. referred to as \u201cThe Boring Billion\u201d\n\n\n2\n. a genus of bird-like dinosaurs.\n\n\n3\n. plural noun: angiosperms\n\na plant that has flowers and produces seeds enclosed within a carpel.

        "Subject: Acorn from a nearby tree. Procedure: Acorn was buried approximately 5 meters away from TSD Results: In approximately 10 hours, a fully grown tree had been produced. Appearance resembles an ash tree. Analysis: Why the TSD had made it an ash tree when the acorn I harvested was completely different is beyond me. I hypothesize that the \u201cEvolution Space\u201d that the TSD creates also genetically mutates whatever evolves and grows. This implies a myriad of different possibilities.",
        "Subject: Angiosperm samples 3",
        "Procedure: Placed approximately 1 meter from the TSD Results: Various flowers started to sprout and spread around the TSD, including the flower species Montsechia vidalii in the span of 3 hours Analysis: Angiosperm is how flowers evolve and spread, there were many theories that dinosaurs may have eaten angiosperm and spread it around to evolve it. I think I just created the first flower, which is exciting.",
        "Subject: [DATA EXPUNGED] Procedure: Item placed 1 inch from the TSD for [REDACTED] Results: [DATA EXPUNGED] Analysis: Evolution is powerful, and there are some things we shouldn\u2019t mess with. Whatever just happened there took a week to kill and took me another week to recover from its venom. I\u2019m eating its remains tonight.",
        "Subject: Dr. Evelyn Moore Procedure: Stationed on top of the TSD for several weeks. Results: No changes found Analysis: I\u2019ve determined that whatever caused my anomalous eternal youth is also preventing me from evolving biologically.",
        "Subject: Two unknown species of fish Procedure: One fish was placed in a container of room temperature water. The other fish was placed in an identical container, but the temperature was drastically lowered using Project: Centureic\u2019s liquid nitrogen cooling system. Both containers were placed approximately 2 meters away from Project: Centureic. Results: The fish in the room temperature water evolved normally and grew to an adult fish in a matter of minutes. The fish in the frigid water aged the same, however, it seemed to have evolved to resist the colder climates after an autopsy. Analysis: Biodiversity wished it could be this good, quick evolution for the fish to adapt to the cold climates without having to go through natural selection.",
        "Subject: Nearby tree Procedure: Had animals eat pieces of the leaves and place a TSD 5 meters away while being eaten for approximately 3.4 minutes. Results: The tree had evolved into a Cycas Revoluta. Fauna consuming the tree reduced greatly. Analysis: As expected, the Evolution Space had influenced the tree to evolve into a Cycas Revoluta.",
        "Subject: A third fish Procedure: Placed a TSD 1 meter next to it for approximately 10 minutes. Results: The subject grew legs and walked on land Analysis: It\u2019s incredible, I caused the evolution of land animals. It never occurred to me that this would happen. I had to wait a couple of centuries though to make sure I don\u2019t mess anything up, but it\u2019s amazing to think this little guy would become a dinosaur one day.",
