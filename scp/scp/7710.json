SCP-7710 is to be contained in a large biohazardous containment cell retrofitted for a large animal. Its cell is to be lined with common industrial plastic with imprinted thaumaturgic sigils. SRAs\n1\n are to be placed at the corners of the containment cell. Use of fire is approved in re-containing the anomaly. Personnel are required to wear hazardous material suits while in SCP-7710's cell. Testing temporary sigils must be made with a liquid mixture 1:7:10 ratio of silver dust:salt:blood (unspecified).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7710's location of discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7710 is a biohazardous entity retrieved from the Saginaw Bay in Bay City, Michigan, USA. The entity will take on the appearance of an extinct, extinct in the wild, or critically endangered species. Its current form is a black rhinoceros. SCP-7710 is three times the size of its non-anomalous counterparts. The anomaly's mass is made up of biohazardous and acidic slime; it has an exo-skeleton composed of oxidized iron and copper. At this time, no specific cause for SCP-7710's manifestation has been found.\n\n\nIn testing, SCP-7710 has been found to emit low levels of TRE.\n2\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7710.1\n\n\n \n\n\nEmail Logs 7710.1\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n Jr. Researcher Mordecai Ryder\n\n\nFrom:\n Head Researcher Leah Kr\u00f3lik\n\n\nSubject:\n New Assignment\n\n\nDate:\n 2022/09/20\n\n\nTime:\n 08:41\n\n\n\n\nGood morning Mordecai,\n\n\nI have some wonderful news for you!

The entity melts into corium.\n\n\n09:33: The blast shields protect the researchers from the sudden radioactive burst. Containment Specialist Samson alerts the facility to a containment breach.\n\n\n09:35: All personnel begin evacuating.\n\n\n09:43: Jr. Researcher Mordecai trips and falls down. He tends to his ankle.\n\n\n09:47: SCP-7710 breaches containment. Its original biohazardous exoskeleton has grown back. It ceases emitting radioactivity.\n\n\n09:48: Mordecai weakly stands up and hobbles down the hall.\n\n\n09:51: SCP-7710 sluggishly crawls down the hallway, still recovering from the meltdown.\n\n\n09:55-10:04: Hopping into an empty conference room, Mordecai stretches his ankle. He pulls out a tube of eyeliner and writes around the bruise while \nmuttering\n.\n\n\n10:05: Roaring is reported to come from Temporary Containment Wing-B. Mordecai stands and flexes his ankle. He evacuates the conference room and heads toward the security checkpoint.\n\n\n10:07: SCP-7710 barges down the hall, and into the open office floor. Despite Mordecai's prior injuries, he is able to run down the next hallway. The anomaly barrels after Mordecai.\n\n\n10:08-10:15: The entity launches its biohazardous sludge at the researcher. The researcher cups his mouth and \nyells\n. A wall of light appears before him. The sludge is absorbed by the wall. Mordecai appears to be \nspeaking\n while launching thaumaturgically charged spheres at SCP-7710, which explode on impact. The wall disapates. Recovering from the explosives, SCP-7710 continues to pursue Mordecai.\n\n\n10:15: Mordecai reaches the security checkpoint. The vault doors are locked. The researcher uses the checkpoint intercom.\n\n\n\n\nIntercom Recording\n\n\n\n\nMordecai:\n Anyone there?\n\n\nSecurity:\n Yes. We aren't able to open the doors until SCP-7710 is re-contained.

Mordecai ends the call.]\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Footage (Video Only)\n\n\n\n\n10:18-10:23: The researcher turns and faces the anomaly again. Mordecai removes his lab coat, and rolls up his sleeves. He pulls out the tube of eyeliner again and frantically scrawls on both forearms. SCP-7710 launches refuse at Mordecai. The researcher's eyes begin glowing as he waves his hands, manifesting a wall of light. It absorbs the attack.\n\n\n10:24-10:35: Mordecai strafes left. The entity rams into the doors. The researcher's eyes glow brighter and light begins to outline Mordecai's body. SCP-7710 recovers and appears to bellow. Mordecai \nyells\n and a shortbow made out of light appears in his hand. He points it at SCP-7710. Pulling on the string Mordecai manifests an arrow. He quickly lets out 3 arrows. The entity writhes as the arrows embed into its exposed flesh. Mordecai \nwhispers\n into his left hand, summoning another thaumaturgical explosive orb. Throwing it in the direction of SCP-7710, Mordecai sprints and ducks behind a trash can. The footage washes out for a minute.\n\n\n10:37-10:43: SCP-7710 recovers. There are two new cracks in its exoskeleton; it leaks crude oil. Mordecai de-summons the shortbow, centers his weight and begins to dance. The anomaly bombards Mordecai with refuse. The researcher's \nmouth moves\n as he extends his arms above his head. Light around Mordecai expands. A thick, wall of plasma expands and atomizes the refuse. Mordecai is overexposed for the rest of the footage.\n\n\n[On site temperature read outs report an average increase of 5C site wide at this time. Containment Wing-B reports an increase of 7C.]\n\n\n10:46-10:51: The anomaly struggles, dragging its mass toward the security checkpoint. Mordecai rushes toward SCP-7710. Light levels increase around Mordecai as he approaches the entity. An appendage flows out of him and makes a large fist. Upon impact with SCP-7710 Mordecai punches it. There is another bright flash and a report of an increase in heat. The rest of the footage is corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJr. Researcher Mordecai was discovered unconscious, clothes burned, severely dehydrated, and covered in first degree burns. SCP-7710 was found contained in a dome of plasma.

I need to speak to Dr. Cornell alone now.\n\n\nSamson:\n Alright, we'll begin work immediately.\n\n\n[Samson leaves the room.]\n\n\nCornell:\n Tell me what you remember.\n\n\nMordecai:\n Something went wrong with the sigil, and 7710 melted into nuclear sludge. Thankfully the blast shields were up, (wheezes) I tripped while evacuating and twisted my ankle. I don't remember much from then to when the rhino rushed me.\n\n\nCornell:\n Try to remember your fight with the rhino.\n\n\n[Silence for roughly 2 minutes.]\n\n\nMordecai:\n I remember writing \nPSALMS\n\u2026something, on my forearm, and \nGUIDANCE\n on the other.
