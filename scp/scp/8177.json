It is to receive a daily ration of 60 grams of standard cat food. Access to SCP-8177\u2019s containment chamber is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or lower. Interaction with SCP-8177 by unauthorized personnel is prohibited.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8177 is a feline entity that can only be perceived by individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Those who can perceive SCP-8177 describe it as an adult cat, with fur colors and patterns that vary based on the observer\u2019s personal preferences or sources of comfort. The entity emits a calming aura, significantly reducing stress, anxiety, and sensory overload in those who can perceive it.\n\n\nSCP-8177 can be photographed, but only when captured using a black-and-white camera operated by an individual who can perceive it. When photographed with modern digital or color film cameras, SCP-8177 does not appear in the resulting images.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a08177-1:\u00a0Origin\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a08177-1:\u00a0Origin\n\n\n\n\nSCP-X-001 was discovered on the streets of California, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, found sleeping inside a cardboard box with the words \"ADOPT ME!\" scrawled on the front. Initially, SCP-8177 appeared to be an ordinary stray cat to Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588, who was unaware of its anomalous properties. However, when the Foundation investigated, personnel without ASD were unable to perceive the entity, leading to initial skepticism regarding its existence. The anomaly was confirmed when a second agent, diagnosed with ASD, independently verified its presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a08177-2:\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\u00a08177-2:\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 8177-01\n\n\nDate: 08/02/2001\n\n\nSubject:\n D-2930, male, 29 years old, diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 13 years ago.\n\n\nProcedure:\nD-2930 was instructed to enter SCP-8177\u2019s containment chamber and interact with the entity.\n\n\nResults:\n D-2930 reported an immediate sense of relief and comfort, later stating, \"I wish I could take it home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 8177-02\n\n\nDate: 08/04/2001\n\n\nSubject:\n D-4087, female, 33 years old, diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 22 years ago.\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-4087 was instructed to enter SCP-8177\u2019s containment chamber and interact with the entity by petting and caressing it.\n\n\nResults:\n D-4087 emerged from the chamber in an excited state, describing the experience as \"the most pleasant and comforting moment of my life.\" However, several days after the experiment, D-4087 tragically [REDACTED] herself, likely due to distress caused by separation from SCP-8177.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a joint decision by the Overseer Council and the Ethics Committee, all experimentation involving SCP-8177 has been officially suspended.
