(Hover to enlarge.)\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:\n \n[Containment suspended.]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-139 designates the disappearance of Lucian Saxe, formerly a Foundation-employed security specialist. Saxe had, until SCP-139's occurrence, acted as a consultant for Site-97 on the matter of esoteric reanimation methodology.\n\n\nSCP-139 is considered anomalous both due to a persistent infohazard encountered following its occurrence [\n1\n] and due to the cut-off of information pertaining to SCP-139 after April 4, 1978. Despite Site-97's best efforts, neither Saxe's past-or-present whereabouts nor the location of a cadaver have been uncovered. Extradimensional travel is suspected but not confirmed.\n\n\nNo primary suspects which could be responsible for SCP-139 have been identified, owing to the largely inconclusive results of investigative efforts. As such, SCP-139 is currently considered a cold case [\n2\n] and is expected to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS:\n\n\n\n\nMarch 5, 1978\n\n\nSaxe clocks in at Site-97 and declines usual chatter with personnel at the front entrance. Ze enters hir office and does not exit for the remainder of the workday.\n\n\nFor a period of twelve hours, Saxe queries forty-two SCiPNET entries pertaining to thaumaturgic workings, global ley-line activity, and available research into Way and Knock techniques. This idle activity contradicts hir otherwise exemplary productivity record and raises concern among Site-97 staff; sensor agents are dispatched appropriately.\n\n\nNo further abnormalities occur until Saxe has punched out and arrived at hir residence in suburban Albany. By 10:45 PM, ze vacates hir residence, presumably on foot to avoid detection, and exits the city limits.\n\n\nMarch 6\n\n\nA paper trail of bus and train tickets suggests Saxe traveled approximately two-thousand kilometers to Topeka, Kansas, arriving at 12:15 PM. Of note, interviewed civilians occasionally describe hir as \"that traitor\" when recounting this eighteen-hour period. [\n3\n]\n\n\nMarch 7 \u2013\u00a0April 4\n\n\nAfter Topeka, the paper trail terminates, and reports of Saxe's location during the following month become increasingly irregular. A car ze is believed to have rented is sighted in Salt Lake City, Utah and Lubbock, Texas on March 10 and March 15 respectively \u2014 although the windshield and rightmost tail-light shattered between the two cities. Ze is last documented in Tucson, Arizona after residential police implicate hir in a resist-and-flee incident on suspicions of vagrancy. [\n4\n]\n\n\nOn April 4, sensor agents embedded within the Tucson USPS remove the following letter from the mail pool.\n\n\n\n\nTo the ones I'm running from,\n\n\nI hate you.\n\n\nI hate what you've done, and what you're doing to me, and what I think you did to the others who ran. I hate how I'd find lenses in the eyes of paintings and strange fingerprints on my belongings. I'm curious by trade,\u00a0but you've really got me beat.\n\n\nI'm not the first to run. But I might be the first to break free.\n\n\nI'm going someplace without cameras or fingerprints, someplace you can't follow. It was fun while it lasted, but you lost this one. And soon I'll be back, and you're going to lose more.\n\n\nThe Hand's\n always been welcoming to people like me, anyways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1. See the constructed timeline below.\n\n\n2. As determined by the Site-97 Forensics Board.\n\n\n3. Despite this, no sensitive data leakage pertaining to hir employment at Site-97 was discovered.\n\n\n4. This police report was filed on April 3 at 3:48 AM and is considered the last documented sighting of Lucian Saxe by the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscp-139-addendum.pdf\n\n\n\n\nscp-139-addendum.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum.139.1\n\n\n\n\nSCP-139 officially concluded on April 27, 1993, when a minor structural failure revealed a small air-pocket within Site-97's concrete foundation. Although this led to a temporary lockdown due to the destruction of Site-97's courtyard, integrity was eventually restored. Models of the air-pocket prior to the structural failure indicate it resembled a prostrate human body fitting Lucian Saxe's height and build.\n\n\nAfter the initial excavation, the following personal effects were discovered:\n\n\n\n\nThe necrotic flesh of a heavily-decayed human cadaver and several human bones, most pulverized by the aforementioned structural failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Foundation keycard for a Site-97 security specialist; ID number scratched out, suggesting deep shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA forbidden thaumaturgic ritual to preserve its user's spirit after their death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map of ley-line positionings in the contiguous United States, often referenced by enemies of the Foundation. A circle had been drawn around a nexus on the US-Mexico border near Tucson, AZ.\n\n\n\n\nSaxe's cause of death is believed to be terminal dehydration, following several days of entombment.\n\n\nDuring the investigation of this air-pocket, Site-97 excavators punctured a secondary cut-out hidden within the concrete. Due to the considerable strain that excavation would put on Site-97's foundation, this cut-out has not been analyzed extensively. What can be determined, however, is that it contains a large number of partially-decomposed human eyes, believed to exceed one thousand in total.\n\n\nPerforations within the concrete would have allowed these eyes to observe their target on all sides until ze expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-138\n | SCP-139 | \nSCP-140\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-139\n\" by Nagiros, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
