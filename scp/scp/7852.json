Only personnel cleared by either Lead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek or Interim Site Director Anna Dubois are allowed entrance to SCP-7852 for containment locker retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance to SCP-7852 after initial clean-out of debris was completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel entering SCP-7852 are to wear the specialised containment suit to cover all non-anomalous clothing and accessories. Only anomalous items are allowed on the premises of SCP-7852 outside the suit. Containment lockers are not to leave office space designated for testing, and are to be returned upon completion of test.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7852 is the former office of Field Agent Jan Claessen, located in Site 312 in Nieuwegein. From 2002 to 2018, this office was used by Agent Claessen for assignments in the Netherlands.\n\n\nSCP-7852 contains a near-complete vacuum, capable of draining all batteries and power sources of electric energy on the premises. All non-anomalous items left in SCP-7852 are ejected into the hallway. SCP-7852 is currently used as a storage unit for containment lockers 1 to \n10\n due to its inherent dampening abilities.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n Over the course of 2017 and early 2018, several reports were made by Site 312 personnel about maintenance issues at the site's office space.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod\n\n\nSummary of events\n\n\nFollow-up\n\n\nSCP-7852-a's effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-OCT/NOV\n\n\nTemperature fluctuations were noticed by on-site personnel in the hallway, coming from SCP-7852.\n\n\nMr. Gijs van Oosterbeek requested inspection of the heating and venting systems.\n\n\nNot recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-DEC\n\n\nDir. Anna Dubois noticed a strong draft going into SCP-7852.\n\n\nDir. Dubois implemented a policy to check for closure of windows and vents.\n\n\nNot recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-JAN\n\n\nCluttering in the hallway outside SCP-7852.\n\n\nDr. Ayse Demir volunteered to help Agent Claessen reorganise.\n\n\nFirst known ejection event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-FEB\n\n\nMx. Harrit Swanepoel heard \u201csoft whining\u201d coming from the office.\n\n\nPest control audit found an infestation of mice.\n1\n\n\nMx. Swanepoel expressed concern about Agent Claessen's wellbeing to Mr. Van Oosterbeek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\n Alongside these events, a change in Agent Claessen\u2019s personality was noted by Site 312 personnel, including emotional responses and a \u201csnappy\u201d demeanour. Agent Claessen complained about a lack of trust in his capabilities when offered help.\n\n\nThe existence of SCP-7852-a was proposed by Dr. Demir to explain a correlation between these reports and Agent Claessen when building inspections couldn\u2019t determine an underlying cause. Going forward, the effects of SCP-7852-a on Agent Claessen's wellbeing are recorded alongside the relevant SCP-7852 activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod\n\n\nSummary of events\n\n\nSCP-7852-a's effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Week 10-12\n\n\nHarrit Swanepoel noticed water damage on the floor and wall on several occasions. A leaking radiator was later discovered and replaced.\n\n\nEmotional outbursts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Week 13\n\n\nGijs van Oosterbeek reported flickering lights in the hallway. Several lightbulbs were replaced and the fusebox was serviced.\n\n\nIrritable behaviour and increased time spent writing reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Week 14\n\n\nHarrit Swanepoel reported a return of the water damage. A newly broken radiator pipe was discovered.\n\n\nEmotional outbursts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\n Lead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek attempted to engage Agent Claessen in conversation concerning their mental workload several times, but was rebuffed with concerns about clearance restrictions.\n2\n\n\nDespite this, Van Oosterbeek introduced several alterations in work flow that indirectly decreased workload pressure for Agent Claessen. In reports to Director Dubois, Agent Claessen noted relief and \"being able to better prioritise\" as a result.\n\n\nMx. Swanepoel spent several hours working on the technical infrastructure in SCP-7852, while engaging Agent Claessen in discussions about his family and Flemish culture. These unplanned tech updates were later reported to correlate with a decrease in activity in SCP-7852.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nReporter\n\n\nSummary of events\n\n\nSCP-7852-a's effect\n\n\nFollow-up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-10 and -12\n\n\nGijs van Oosterbeek\n\n\nHeat coming from SCP-7852\n\n\nAngry outbursts, \u201ctemperamental\u201d.\n\n\nDeescalated outbursts with humour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-16\n\n\nAnna Dubois\n\n\n\u201cStrong Draft\u201d going in and out of office\n\n\nLate at meetings, tired.\n\n\nDir.

Swanepoel took several long walks through Nieuwegein with Agent Claessen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-04-25\n\n\nAyse Demir\n\n\nElectronics plugged into electrical socket do not charge, but remain functioning with the same energy level.\n\n\nIncrease of overtime worked.\n\n\nSeveral of Agent Claessen\u2019s containment tasks were taken up by Dr. Demir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-05-02\n\n\nHarrit Swanepoel\n\n\nInformal complaint of \u201cair pressure\u201d or \u201cthin air\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-7852-1\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\n A meeting was requested by Gijs van Oosterbeek in April to discuss the matter with Anna Dubois, Interim Director for Site 312, during her next monthly visit to the site. This meeting never happened due to the SCP-7852-1 event.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nOn 2018-05-02, a fire broke out within Agent Claessen's office. Non-anomalous fire suppression measures were ineffective in subduing the fire. After initial shock subsided, it was noted that the fire did not cross the boundaries of the office space.\n\n\nDuring the fire, hereafter referred to as SCP-7852-1, all furniture and generic office equipment were destroyed. Foundation documentation and anomalous artefacts stored in containment locker 7\n4\n remained unaffected. Further inquiry established that the contents of containment locker 7 played no role in the SCP-7852-1 event.\n5\n\n\nThe specific trigger for SCP-7852-1 is unknown. No SCP-7852-1 event has taken place since, and building maintenance issues have subsided. Only items related to anomalous or Foundation efforts are allowed entrance to SCP-7852 as a precaution.\n\n\nTo date, there is no indication as to the exact nature of SCP-7852-a\u2019s origin, or how it latched onto Agent Claessen. An interconnection between anomalous and non-anomalous circumstances has been proposed, but due to ceased activity in SCP-7852, no further actions were taken.\n\n\nAfter the SCP-7852-1 event, Agent Claessen used a flex office for on-site work for the remainder of his tenure.\n\n\nUpdate 2019-07-01:\n Classification updated from \u2018Safe\u2019 to \u2018Thaumiel\u2019 as SCP-7852 has been repurposed as an on-site anomalous containment storage.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwanTran4.2 File Collection Complete\n\n\nHi there, Anna Dubois!\n\n\nOne additional file was located linked to this entry.

Dubois\u2019s office at Site 312. He looks tired, with a pale complexion and bags under his eyes.\n\n\nDir. Dubois points to the chair in front of her desk.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Take a seat.\n\n\nAgent Claessen sits down.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n How are you, Jan?\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n Good, good. I\u2019ve almost finished outlining the new Field Agent training manual for Site 583, and I\u2019m on track for this quarter\u2019s containment reviews. I\u2019ve also considered your proposal for redistribution of anomalous item containment at Site 312, but haven\u2019t worked out the details yet. All in all, I\u2019m on schedule for this year\u2019s goals.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Glad to hear it. Is that why you requested this meeting?\n\n\nAgent Claessen is silent for a moment.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n How are \nyou\n, Jan?\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I\u2019m fine. Could use a vacation, I guess. But don\u2019t we all?\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n You don't need to go through me to request vacation time. But I\u2019ve had some reports \u2013\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n [Defensively] Is there a problem with my work?\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n There isn\u2019t a problem with the quality of your work, but I am worried about the toll it takes on you.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I \u2013\n\n\nAgent Claessen looks away.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re a bit tense lately. Not just with me, but also with colleagues. Including a vocal altercation with Gijs earlier this month.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n I know he can be a little rough around the edges, but you don't usually let him get to you like that.\n\n\nAgent Claessen is visibly struggling to get his words out. He looks down to the floor.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n We\u2019re all just a little bit worried about you. \nI\u2019m\n a bit worried about you. Is everything alright?\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I \u2013 I\u2019m fine. I am fine.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I have it all under control.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n I never doubted that.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n It\u2019s just Site 312. No Keters, no big treats. We don\u2019t even have D-Classes to monitor.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Jan \u2013\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I can handle that. I can handle it!\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Jan, I know. It\u2019s okay.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n It shouldn\u2019t be an issue. It\u2019s goddamned Site 312, it\u2019s not dangerous. It\u2019s barely a joke. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? A stoner getting a scare over an unscheduled coffee shop refill?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n It shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n But it\u2019s just a lot right now, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nAgent Claessen gasps for air, and starts to sob.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n It feels like I can\u2019t breathe sometimes.\n\n\nAgent Claessen sobs in silence for several seconds.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n I can\u2019t fail.\n\n\nAgent Claessen starts to cry uncontrollably at this moment.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n You're not failing.\n\n\nHe grabs a tissue Dir. Dubois handed him.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n You\u2019ve done decades of amazing work for the Foundation. Stressful work, often while underfunded, and you\u2019ve done amazing things. I don\u2019t know where I would have been without you. Now does that sounds like failing to you?\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n [Quietly] I know..\n\n\nHe wipes the tears from his face.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to take some time off? A nice vacation with Jacqueline. Spend some time with the grandkids.\n\n\nAgent Claessen nods while staring at the floor.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Let\u2019s do that. And in a couple of weeks, you and I are going to see what else you need.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n [Quietly] I don\u2019t want to give up.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n You\u2019re not. You\u2019ve given so much to the Foundation, it\u2019s time we gave something back. Doesn\u2019t that sound fair?\n\n\nAgent Claessen nods again.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Site 312 can survive for a while. You\u2019ve made sure of that. Why don\u2019t you go home early today?\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n There is stuff I need to finish! I need \u2013\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Write them down. Make a list. I\u2019ll make sure they get done, by me or the rest of the team.\n\n\nDir. Dubois sits down next to him as they compose a short list of tasks. Agent Claessen visibly calms down during this interaction.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n Are you feeling a bit better?\n\n\nShe places a hand on his upper arm. Agent Claessen smiles weakly and nods.\n\n\nCLAESSEN:\n Can I \u2013 can I wait a moment in here? I don\u2019t want them to see me like this.\n\n\nDUBOIS:\n As long as you need.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this evaluation, Jan Claessen accepted 4 weeks of paid administrative leave, after which he started partial retirement. His current responsibilities cover auditing containment protocols of SCPs he contained during his tenure, and training new Field Agents.\n\n\nAlthough already qualifying for the Foundation retirement plan, Agent Jan Claessen requested to enter full retirement in mid-2019, stating a desire to oversee a full transfer of his responsibilities himself. Foundation Arbo arts\n6\n and therapist Sterre de Veer agreed that this course of action would be beneficial to Agent Claessen\u2019s mental wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7852\n\" by FlyPurgatorio, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
