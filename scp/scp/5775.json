Therefore, public knowledge of SCP-5775\u2019s true composition should be suppressed by any means necessary. This includes dissemination of false geological data, feigned historical reports, and other details elaborated upon in Document 5775-7. Public interest in landing on Mars at this time does not pose a concern, as many seem to be unaware of SCP-5775 and its neighbor. However, updated containment procedures are being worked on should public interest turn toward them.\n\n\nOperatives on Specialized Lunar Containment and Research Area (AKA Lunar Area 32) are to monitor SCP-5775 and SCP-5775-1 for unusual behavior. Expeditions to SCP-5775 through the use of SCP-5775-1 must obtain the approval of Site Director Dan Howell and Head Researcher Naomi Lyons. Groups are to consist of two armed agents in addition to required personnel. Teams are advised to report in every hour.\n\n\nADDENDUM \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Following the events of Expedition IV, Mobile Task Force Delta-6 (Marvin Martians) has been created for further explorations of SCP-5775, as well as finding SCP-5775-B. SCP-5775-A is being held in a standard humanoid containment cell in Lunar Area 32. Further expeditions to SCP-5775 are discouraged unless deemed absolutely necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5775 is publicly known as Mars\u2019s smallest moon, Deimos, named for the Greek God of terror. Object has a surface area of 495.1 km2 and a mass of 1.48 * 10\n15\n kg. SCP-5775\u2019s appearance as a normal celestial body is believed to be a combination of holographic illusion and millions of years of damage.\n\n\nSCP-5775 is a large spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. There is debate over whether the craft is from native Martians or another species of alternate origin. The craft possesses several internal hallways, rooms, and wiring powered by an unknown fuel source, enough to sustain life as seen in previous explorations. Exploration of SCP-5775 has been hindered due to its distance from main Foundation operations. SCP-5775's true nature was discovered in 1999, following the discovery of SCP-5775-1.\n\n\nSCP-5775-1 is a 6.4-kilometer platform of unknown material located in the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon. When stepped on, the object can transport a subject and forty (40) kilograms of equipment to an exterior room in SCP-5775. The room appears to be a hanger, with a single ship, inoperable save for guns attached to the front, being present. The exterior wall, when walked through, returns a subject to SCP-5775-1. The room is sealed with a door of similar material that has so far been unable to be damaged and has hindered the first three expeditions. However, development on a key to hack into the systems of SCP-5775 has been ongoing.\n\n\nIncident Report \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n The following transmission was received from SCP-5775 and picked up on dead channels of GRU Division \u201cP\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nWe have been waiting. Help us.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Memo, Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz to Head Researcher Naomi Lyons\n\n\n\n\nSo, I heard we\u2019re going on another expedition. That\u2019s exciting! I also heard you were looking to bring a Junior Researcher. I was hoping you would pick me.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure the site director has given you \nsome details on my history\n, so I may seem like a bit of a gamble. But I like to think of it more as experience that can help me in the field. Not to mention, between the 3008 incident and every time I\u2019ve taken lead on the research with the stuff we have gotten from 5775, I think I\u2019m as qualified as someone of my position can be.\n\n\nPlus, I'm very observant. I have all sorts of questions. Who sent this message? Why now? Why is it in English?\n\n\nI hope you consider me for the expedition.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5775 Expedition IV FOR LEVEL 3 ONLY\n\nFollowing the transmission from SCP-5775, Head Researcher Dr. Naomi Lyons requested a team to investigate, citing the prototype of a key able to open the doorway from the hangar. After discussions with the Site Director and O5 Council, the following team was gathered:\n\n\n\u2022 Dr. Naomi Lyons, Head Researcher (56)\n\n\u2022 Dr. Regina Beale, Researcher (45)\n\n\u2022 Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz (26)\n\n\u2022 Agent Helen Troy (39)\n1\n\n\u2022 Agent Jonathan Bell (31)\n\n\nAgents Bell and Troy were outfitted with cameras, while Dr. Beale was designated to take written notes and Junior Researcher Yaltz to take photographs.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\u00a0Log\u00a0Part\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team has used SCP-5775-1 to arrive in the hangar.\n\n\nBell:\n And we\u2019re rolling. Journey to the Martian Moons, Scene 7, Take 4, Mar-\n\n\nLyons:\n Stop it.\n\n\nBell quiets. Beale approaches Lyons.\n\n\nBeale:\n Are we walking into a trap?\n\n\nLyons:\n Most likely.\n\n\nBeale:\n So what are we doing here?\n\n\nLyons:\n Just because it\u2019s a trap doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to gain from it.\n\n\nThe team approaches the door. Troy pulls Yaltz aside.\n\n\nTroy:\n Are you gonna be alright, kid? You\u2019re overdue for a shift.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Yeah, I\u2019ll be fine. I've seen worse. And I mean, you\u2019re here to protect me, right? Since it\u2019s your job?\n\n\nTroy:\n Today was supposed to be my day off.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Oh, uh\u2026\n\n\nTroy:\n Kidding. Come on.\n\n\nThey rejoin the team. Dr. Lyons pulls the key, a black card, from her pocket and scans it against the door. The door slowly slides open. The hallway it opens to is empty and seemingly abandoned. It is three meters tall.\n\n\nLyons:\n Shall we?\n\n\nThey move through the hall.\n\n\nBeale:\n There\u2019s writing on the walls. Look.\n\n\nYaltz looks, then shields his eyes.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Shit, is it memetic?\n\n\nBeale:\n I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s \nOrtrothan\n. Don\u2019t suppose any of you can speak it.\n\n\nThe team moves on. More writing is discovered on the walls. Later analysis shows the writings roughly translate to \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cMercy\u201d. The team enters a large chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\u00a0from\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Regina\u00a0Beale\u00a0during\u00a0Expedition\u00a0IV\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-5775\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nThe size of the chamber was the first thing that stood out to me. It wasn\u2019t really that it was tall, but the architecture of the rest of the room with the hallway suggested it was of average size for whatever species roamed here. Not human.\n\n\nAnother thing that popped out about the chamber were the six cells surrounding us. The doors were flung open and emptied. Still, we all picked one to analyze. Bell seemed to almost hope a monster would leap out at us. Lyons focused on the central pillar.\n\n\nI followed her eyeline. Above us was what seemed to be a keyboard and a monitor. We didn\u2019t bring any equipment to climb up there, but there was a piece of paper we managed to knock down. The texture suggested something other than paper, but the details were the same- some kind of map.\n\nDr. Lyons has some experience with rockets and spacecrafts. She pointed out what seemed to be a launch site for this thing. Other geographic details lined up with the Martian surface below us.\n\n\nThis craft is definitely designed for war, but Yaltz pointed out the cells were more like something the Foundation would have for study.\n\n\nBright side? The architecture isn\u2019t randomly shifting like \nSite-13\n, so\u2026 there\u2019s that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\u00a0Log\u00a0Part\u00a02\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team moves on from the chamber and through the halls. As they round a corner, Agent Troy encounters a body on the floor. The subject appears to be roughly 2 meters tall, with a physical similarity to a praying mantis.\n\n\nTroy:\n Fucking hell! Back!\n\n\nShe pushes the team back. Dr. Lyons looks over her.\n\n\nLyons:\n I think it\u2019s dead, Agent Troy.\n\n\nAgent Troy relaxes. Dr. Lyons and Dr. Beale approach the subject.\n\n\nBeale:\n I think we found what operated those computers.\n\n\nLyons:\n And what killed it. Look.\n\n\nLyons flips the body over. It displays a curved bullet wound, winding through the area designated its hip and out of its neck.\n\n\nBeale:\n That ain\u2019t right.\n\n\nYaltz raises his camera.\n\n\nTroy:\n Thomas!\n\n\nYaltz:\n It\u2019s for research!\n\n\nHe snaps a picture. Dr. Lyons takes out a pair of pliers and removes a bullet/fly-hybrid from the creature\u2019s neck.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Is that a fly?\n\n\nLyons:\n It\u2019s been modified. Bio-organic technology. This \u201cfly\u201d was fired.\n\n\nYaltz:\n From a gun? That\u2019s so cool!\n\n\nEveryone looks at Junior Researcher Yaltz.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Sorry.\n\n\nAgent Troy pats his shoulder.\n\n\nBell:\n Hey, what\u2019s that?\n\n\nAgent Bell points further down the hall to a room. Inside, a deceased pterodactyl-like creature is seen crashed through the hull of the ship. On the side of the creature appears to be a door. The team enters the room. There are two other exits, one being closed. A large monitor with a keyboard of various symbols sits in the corner. Dr. Beale goes to touch the creature.\n\n\nVoyich:\n I wouldn\u2019t touch that if I were you.\n\n\nAgents Troy and Bell spin toward the man, an average sized man in a cosmonaut suit. He appears to be of Ukrainian descent. Both agents have pointed their guns.\n\n\nTroy:\n Who the hell are you?\n\n\nVoyich:\n I am Colonel Aleksandr Voyich, but I should be asking you that question. I\u2019ve only ever seen my comrades in this place.\n\n\nDr. Beale slowly steps in front of the agents.\n\n\nBeale:\n My name is Dr. Regina Beale. I\u2019m a Researcher with the SCP Foundation. We came to investigate a transmission. Did you send it?\n\n\nVoyich:\n I have been sending transmissions for what feels like ages. I thought my comrades would pick it up. But I will not complain.\n\n\nBeale:\n Are there more of you?\n\n\nVoyich:\n Yes. Wait here. Smirnov! Kuznetsov! Help has arrived!\n\n\nVoyich runs down the hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRU\u00a0Division\u00a0\u201cP\u201d\u00a0Memo\u00a0\u2013\u00a04\u00a0July\u00a01969\u00a0(translated)\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear President Brezhnev,\n\n\nOn 3 July, at 3:00pm Moscow time, we launched the Volstok 7, manned with seven of our finest cosmonauts. Thanks to the use of [DATA EXPUNGED], we were able to get the seven-man crew among the stars within minutes.\n\n\nHowever, we suffered a technical error with the crew. The navigation system directed them past the moon and out of our radio communications\u2019 broadcast length. We have been unable to reestablish contact. The scientists called it \u2013 we have lost them. We do not know where they have landed. Or if they will land.\n\n\nAs directed, we have kept the details of this mission from the public. We will await your further instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\u00a0Log\u00a0Part\u00a03\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoyich returns with two men. Smirnov is taller and of Soviet descent, while Kuznetsov is of average height and build.\n\n\nVoyich:\n These men are Vladamir Smirnov and Anatoly Kuznetsov. They\u2019re what remains of the crew.\n\n\nYaltz:\n What happened to the rest of the men?\n\n\nSmirnov:\n Some\u2026 walked away\u2026 never return. Others vanish\u2026 while we sleep.\n\n\nYaltz:\n When did you guys launch?\n\n\nSmirnov:\n Fourth of July, nineteen-sixty-nine.\n\n\nThe team exchanges glances with each other.\n\n\nBeale:\n Whatever took your men might still be here. We should leave.\n\n\nLyons:\n Not yet.\n\n\nBeale:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Lyons approaches the monitor.\n\n\nLyons:\n There may be some information we can get from this. Are any of you familiar with these computers?\n\n\nSmirnov:\n Kuznetsov, [speaks Russian].\n\n\nKuznetsov approaches the monitor and exposes some wires. After a few moments, the monitor beeps to life.\n\n\nVoyich:\n Perhaps we should be going?\n\n\nLyons:\n Are you kidding? We\u2019re getting close to answers! This whole ship must be powered by solar energy. At least as a back-up.\n\n\nDr. Lyons slowly works her way through the computer. Yaltz takes pictures.\n\n\nLyons:\n This is all in Ortrothan, so I can\u2019t read much. There are maps in here. Seems they came from another galaxy. And they were invading, but it looks like\u2026 looks like they were running from something.\n\n\nTroy:\n Oh, good. The scary aliens were running from something scarier. Seems you\u2019re just turning up more questions, doc.\n\n\nLyons:\n We might get more answers behind that door. Agent Bell, open that door for me?\n\n\nDr. Lyons hands Agent Bell the key. He approaches the door.\n\n\nBeale:\n I thought we were leaving after this?\n\n\nLyons:\n We are. I just want to look very quickly.\n\n\nVoyich:\n I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good-\n\n\nAgent Bell opens the door. A partially decomposed human corpse drops through.\n\n\nBell:\n Body! Human body!\n\n\nDr. Beale and Smirnov approach.\n\n\nSmirnov:\n That\u2026 uniform. Is\u2026 ours.\n\n\nVoyich:\n Whatever did this might be here now. We should leave!\n\n\nBell:\n He\u2019s got a tag on him!\n\n\nKuznetsov:\n Aleksy? Sergei?\n\n\nBell:\n It says, \u201cVoyich\u201d.\n\n\nThe team turns to Voyich, who is staring at the ground.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n You just had to look, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\nMultiple black rods shoot from Voyich\u2019s body. Two from his chest, three from his back, two from his right hip. Kuznetsov is stabbed through the eye and drops. Agent Bell is stabbed through the heart. Life signs terminated quickly. Dr. Beale and Smirnov drop to the floor and narrowly avoid the attack. Agent Troy pulls Yaltz to the ground. Dr. Lyons is stabbed in the leg.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n I said we should leave! That thing could be in here! Well, guess what? I am! And I\u2019m pissed!\n\n\nVoyich grabs Kuznetsov by the neck, who whimpers and struggles to breathe.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n I\u2019ll give you this, \u201ccomrade\u201d. You guys were the most fun I\u2019ve had in hundreds of thousands of cycles. Last thing before that, these guys sent me to destroy a planet. The violence, Kuznetsov. The mind games. Oh, that was art. Before you guys, all I had were corpses.\n\n\nVoyich snaps Kuznetsov\u2019s neck.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n But now I can leave this place. I have no use for you anymore.\n\n\nVoyich approaches Dr. Lyons. As he is focused on her, the others back away.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n Dr. Lyons, was it? Oh, I\u2019m going to have fun with you.\n\n\nLyons:\n All of you, run!\n\n\nLyons pulls out her gun.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Dr. Lyons!\n\n\nAgent Troy grabs Yaltz and pulls him away. Smirnov follows them. Dr. Beale stays by the door.\n\n\n\u201cVoyich\u201d:\n What does that thing do? Shoot metal? That won\u2019t stop me.\n\n\nLyons:\n Then get out of the way!\n\n\nDr. Lyons shoots the control pad on the door. It slams shut. Another shot is heard, followed by the sound of depressurization. Dr. Beale continues to stand at the door.\n\n\nTroy:\n Dr. Beale! She bought us some time! We need to move!\n\n\nShe follows. The team arrives back at the hangar.\n\n\nYaltz:\n That thing knows where we came from. If it's survived this long, it'll probably get out of there. Can we close the door?\n\n\nTroy:\n I think Bell had the key.\n\n\nBeale:\n Shit.\n\n\nShe looks at the ship.\n\n\nBeale:\n Then we blow the hangar to kingdom come. You guys go.\n\n\nYaltz:\n No, I\u2019ll stay. You go.\n\n\nBeale:\n Yaltz, I admire the resolve, but as of now, I\u2019m the leader. I won\u2019t leave you here with no way out.\n\n\nYaltz:\n Have you read my file, Dr. Beale?\n\n\nBeale:\n What does your personnel file have to do with this?\n\n\nYaltz:\n No, my special containment procedures file.\n\n\nTroy:\n Thomas\u2026\n\n\nYaltz:\n I\u2019m SCP-507.\n\n\nBeale:\n The teleporting kid?\n\n\nYaltz:\n I\u2019m twenty-six at this point, but yeah. If I stay, I\u2019ll teleport off this thing eventually and get back home.\n\n\nBeale:\n Then we\u2019ll all stay.\n\n\nYaltz:\n You have an anomalous subject with you. I think they\u2019d understand it if you left. I\u2019ve been handling weird shit since I was born, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll be okay.\n\n\nTroy:\n And I\u2019ll stay with him. I\u2019m your handler, kid. You don\u2019t get a say.\n\n\nBeale:\n If you\u2019re doing this, she stays.\n\n\nYaltz opens his mouth, then closes it and nods. Dr. Beale and Smirnov suit up and return through SCP-5775-1. Yaltz and Agent Troy, also suited up, board the smaller ship.\n\n\nYaltz:\n To kingdom come?\n\n\nTroy:\n To kingdom come.\n\n\n\n\nAfter-Action Report: SCP-5775 Expedition IV\n\nFollowing the events of Expedition IV, a large explosion was detected from SCP-5775. Three life signatures and numerous piles of debris emerged through SCP-5775-1. The explosion was explained as a meteor strike. Dr. Regina Beale was promoted to Head Researcher of SCP-5775, while Dr. Naomi Lyons and Agent Johnathan Bell were posthumously honored. Vladamir Smirnov was designated SCP-5775-A. Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz and Agent Helen Troy were discovered in Waco, Texas nine days later, with non-threatening injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslations\u00a0from\u00a0SCP-5775:\u00a0Expedition\u00a0IV\n\n\n\n\n-Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\nThe Walls:\n\n\n\n\nHelp us.\n\n\nThey are killing us.\n\n\nWe did not want this.\n\n\nIs this our punishment?\n\n\nMay the gods be merciful.\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer:\n\n\n\n\nAfter much searching, we have found their origin point. We have sent a team and discovered there is another species, similar in intellect but far less advanced. We are sending an operative, Odd Entity-777, to instill chaos and hopefully topple our enemies.\n\n\nWe have seen your play. We have lost our homeworld, but we will still hold on to our other worlds.

The navigation system directed them past the moon and out of our radio communications\u2019 broadcast length. We have been unable to reestablish contact. The scientists called it \u2013 we have lost them. We do not know where they have landed. Or if they will land. As directed, we have kept the details of this mission from the public. We will await your further instructions.",
        "Voyich returns with two men. Smirnov is taller and of Soviet descent, while Kuznetsov is of average height and build. Voyich: These men are Vladamir Smirnov and Anatoly Kuznetsov. They\u2019re what remains of the crew. Yaltz: What happened to the rest of the men? Smirnov: Some\u2026 walked away\u2026 never return. Others vanish\u2026 while we sleep. Yaltz: When did you guys launch? Smirnov: Fourth of July, nineteen-sixty-nine. The team exchanges glances with each other. Beale: Whatever took your men might still be here. We should leave. Lyons: Not yet. Beale: What? Dr. Lyons approaches the monitor. Lyons: There may be some information we can get from this. Are any of you familiar with these computers? Smirnov: Kuznetsov, [speaks Russian]. Kuznetsov approaches the monitor and exposes some wires. After a few moments, the monitor beeps to life. Voyich: Perhaps we should be going? Lyons: Are you kidding? We\u2019re getting close to answers! This whole ship must be powered by solar energy. At least as a back-up. Dr. Lyons slowly works her way through the computer. Yaltz takes pictures. Lyons: This is all in Ortrothan, so I can\u2019t read much. There are maps in here. Seems they came from another galaxy. And they were invading, but it looks like\u2026 looks like they were running from something. Troy: Oh, good. The scary aliens were running from something scarier. Seems you\u2019re just turning up more questions, doc. Lyons: We might get more answers behind that door. Agent Bell, open that door for me? Dr. Lyons hands Agent Bell the key. He approaches the door. Beale: I thought we were leaving after this? Lyons: We are. I just want to look very quickly. Voyich: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good- Agent Bell opens the door. A partially decomposed human corpse drops through. Bell: Body! Human body! Dr. Beale and Smirnov approach. Smirnov: That\u2026 uniform. Is\u2026 ours. Voyich: Whatever did this might be here now. We should leave! Bell: He\u2019s got a tag on him! Kuznetsov: Aleksy? Sergei? Bell: It says, \u201cVoyich\u201d. The team turns to Voyich, who is staring at the ground. \u201cVoyich\u201d: You just had to look, didn\u2019t you? Multiple black rods shoot from Voyich\u2019s body. Two from his chest, three from his back, two from his right hip. Kuznetsov is stabbed through the eye and drops. Agent Bell is stabbed through the heart. Life signs terminated quickly. Dr. Beale and Smirnov drop to the floor and narrowly avoid the attack. Agent Troy pulls Yaltz to the ground. Dr. Lyons is stabbed in the leg. \u201cVoyich\u201d: I said we should leave! That thing could be in here! Well, guess what? I am! And I\u2019m pissed! Voyich grabs Kuznetsov by the neck, who whimpers and struggles to breathe. \u201cVoyich\u201d: I\u2019ll give you this, \u201ccomrade\u201d. You guys were the most fun I\u2019ve had in hundreds of thousands of cycles. Last thing before that, these guys sent me to destroy a planet. The violence, Kuznetsov. The mind games. Oh, that was art. Before you guys, all I had were corpses. Voyich snaps Kuznetsov\u2019s neck. \u201cVoyich\u201d: But now I can leave this place. I have no use for you anymore. Voyich approaches Dr. Lyons. As he is focused on her, the others back away. \u201cVoyich\u201d: Dr. Lyons, was it? Oh, I\u2019m going to have fun with you. Lyons: All of you, run! Lyons pulls out her gun. Yaltz: Dr. Lyons! Agent Troy grabs Yaltz and pulls him away. Smirnov follows them. Dr. Beale stays by the door. \u201cVoyich\u201d: What does that thing do? Shoot metal? That won\u2019t stop me. Lyons: Then get out of the way! Dr. Lyons shoots the control pad on the door. It slams shut. Another shot is heard, followed by the sound of depressurization. Dr. Beale continues to stand at the door. Troy: Dr. Beale! She bought us some time! We need to move! She follows. The team arrives back at the hangar. Yaltz: That thing knows where we came from. If it's survived this long, it'll probably get out of there. Can we close the door? Troy: I think Bell had the key. Beale: Shit. She looks at the ship. Beale: Then we blow the hangar to kingdom come. You guys go. Yaltz: No, I\u2019ll stay. You go. Beale: Yaltz, I admire the resolve, but as of now, I\u2019m the leader. I won\u2019t leave you here with no way out. Yaltz: Have you read my file, Dr. Beale? Beale: What does your personnel file have to do with this? Yaltz: No, my special containment procedures file. Troy: Thomas\u2026 Yaltz: I\u2019m SCP-507. Beale: The teleporting kid? Yaltz: I\u2019m twenty-six at this point, but yeah. If I stay, I\u2019ll teleport off this thing eventually and get back home. Beale: Then we\u2019ll all stay. Yaltz: You have an anomalous subject with you. I think they\u2019d understand it if you left. I\u2019ve been handling weird shit since I was born, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll be okay. Troy: And I\u2019ll stay with him. I\u2019m your handler, kid. You don\u2019t get a say. Beale: If you\u2019re doing this, she stays. Yaltz opens his mouth, then closes it and nods. Dr. Beale and Smirnov suit up and return through SCP-5775-1. Yaltz and Agent Troy, also suited up, board the smaller ship. Yaltz: To kingdom come? Troy: To kingdom come.",
        "Help us. They are killing us. We did not want this. Is this our punishment? May the gods be merciful.",
        "After much searching, we have found their origin point. We have sent a team and discovered there is another species, similar in intellect but far less advanced. We are sending an operative, Odd Entity-777, to instill chaos and hopefully topple our enemies. We have seen your play. We have lost our homeworld, but we will still hold on to our other worlds. You will pay for your actions. Fear the Empire of the Big Foot",

Therefore, public knowledge of SCP-5775\u2019s true composition should be suppressed by any means necessary. This includes dissemination of false geological data, feigned historical reports, and other details elaborated upon in Document 5775-7. Public interest in landing on Mars at this time does not pose a concern, as many seem to be unaware of SCP-5775 and its neighbor. However, updated containment procedures are being worked on should public interest turn toward them.",
