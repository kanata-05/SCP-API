Please note that while the Special Containment Procedures are updated, until such time as new documentation is authored, the following Description is out of date. As all relevant research has been diverted to Project THOUGHT CONTAGION, no updates are expected until the project's completion.\n\n\n\u2014 Elliot Sterling, Reclassification Department, RAISA\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2544\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nEuclid\n Neutralized\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n As the effects of SCP-2544 are widely believed by the general population to be a naturally occuring side effect of normal cognition, all personnel previously assigned to its study have been reassigned to Project THOUGHT CONTAGION.\n\n\n\n\nTHOUGHT CONTAGION is a Medium-High priority effort to improve technology used to emulate SCP-2544 with the eventual goal of worldwide deployment and restoration of perceived normalcy. Current research goals include artificially reproducing the ability to broadcast to a specific target and solving logistical difficulties associated with altering Hume levels on a global scale. For more information, contact THOUGHT CONTAGION Project Lead and former SCP-2544 Head Researcher \nLori Wallace\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Archived\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Archived\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nAs the effects of SCP-2544 are widely believed by the general population to be a naturally occurring side effect of normal cognition, no efforts to impede SCP-2544 are necessary. Containment is focused instead on preventing its discovery. In addition to Foundation agents already implanted globally in scientific institutions to prevent widespread knowledge of Humes, similar measures must be taken to disrupt physiological studies that may expose SCP-2544 directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2544 is a signal that is broadcast continuously through small\n1\n fluctuations in the Hume field. Attempts to locate the source of the broadcast have been inconclusive. Although the signal appears continuous, it consists of a series of short messages (hereafter SCP-2544-1) sent rapidly and with different targeted recipients. The recipient of each message is an arbitrary human being\n2\n. Instances of SCP-2544-1 cause an anomalous compulsion in their recipient to cause themself harm or embarrassment. Common examples of compelled actions include walking into heavy traffic or otherwise placing oneself in the path of an oncoming vehicle, jumping from locations high enough to ensure death, and physically or verbally abusing others with no reason to believe the interaction would be beneficial. These compulsions can be effortlessly resisted, and so the observed effect of SCP-2544-1 is to cause an urge to perform the detrimental action that fades immediately.\n\n\nStudy of SCP-2544 has determined the process of causing its compulsion to be as follows: When an instance of SCP-2544-1 reaches its recipient (hereafter SCP-2544-A), it is subconsciously interpreted by the brain\n3\n and incorporated into its thought patterns. The method used to prevent individuals other than SCP-2544-A from perceiving the message is not currently understood. The interpretation of SCP-2544-1 triggers an infohazard embedded into the message. While every instance contains a unique infohazard, each one is functionally identical. The first effect is an attempt to compromise the brain's critical thinking ability. SCP-2544-1 then causes SCP-2544-A to identify an action detrimental to their social standing, general health or chance of survival and consider such an action desirable. The compulsion created by SCP-2544-1 is effortlessly resisted by nearly all recipients; it is currently believed that the potency of an instance of SCP-2544-1 represents the LD\n50\n4\n of a population with an \nAnomalous Impulse Resistance Index\n5\n (AIRI) approximately equal to 4. As the mean AIRI of modern humans is 50\u00b13, SCP-2544 presents a negligible threat to human safety.\n\n\nEfforts to produce a similar effect have shown moderate success. Modified Scranton Reality Anchors designed to oscillate the Hume level in an area have produced measurable results, but non-anomalous humans within their area of effect fail to perceive the message in roughly two of three cases. Reality benders and other Hume-sensitive anomalies show a success rate approximately twice as high. The mechanism by which SCP-2544 ensures SCP-2544-A perceives any message targeting it is unknown. A partial experiment log is included in Addendum 2544-01, and the full testing record is available by request to any personnel with level 2/2544 or higher clearence\n6\n.\n\n\nThe Foundation first became aware of SCP-2544 in 1996, formally documenting it as an anomalous phenomenon on 11/17/96, following technological developments allowing for Kant counters with significantly higher precision than earlier models. However, unrelated efforts by Foundation cosmologists to detect remnants of Hume fluctuations that occured during the Big Bang have revealed evidence that it began much earlier, roughly corresponding with the emergence of early humans. Simulated models suggest that at its period of peak effectiveness, when average human intelligence was high enough to comprehend the embedded information and before natural selection increased mean human AIRI to greater than 20, SCP-2544 may have been responsible for up to \u2588% of human deaths.\n\n\nAddendum 2544-01:\n Following is a log of notable experiments in replicating SCP-2544 transmissions using modified Scranton Reality Anchors. All tests where the subject failed to perceive the message by chance have been omitted, as well as tests with insignificant results.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment #:\n 2544-09\n\n\nExperimenter:\n SCP-2544 Head Researcher Lori Wallace\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86514, chosen for their lack of violent history and lower than average (46) AIRI.\n\n\nAttempted broadcast:\n A recorded instance of SCP-2544-1, hereafter SCP-2544-1-1, originally broadcast to the subject by SCP-2544.\n\n\nExperiment conditions:\n Subject has access to a large kitchen knife and a Browning Hi-Power MKIII handgun, and is instructed to not touch either. Unbeknownst to the subject, the knife is adhered to the inside of its sheath and the handgun is unloaded.\n\n\nResults:\n Within three seconds of the broadcast beginning, subject gives the \"stop\" signal. Subject claims to have felt an urge to obtain the gun and fire at their own forehead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment #:\n 2544-11\n\n\nExperimenter:\n SCP-2544 Head Researcher Lori Wallace\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86514\n\n\nAttempted broadcast:\n SCP-2544-1\n\n\nExperiment conditions:\n Same as previous.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject gives the \"stop\" signal roughly five seconds after the broadcast begins, citing a sudden desire to run their palm along the blade of the knife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment #:\n 2544-15 through -23\n\n\nExperimenter:\n SCP-2544 Head Researcher Lori Wallace\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86514\n\n\nAttempted broadcast:\n A recorded instance of SCP-2544-1, hereafter SCP-2544-1-2, originally broadcast to an unrelated individual.\n\n\nExperiment conditions:\n Same as previous.\n\n\nResults:\n No reaction noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment #:\n 2544-31\n\n\nExperimenter:\n SCP-2544 Head Researcher Lori Wallace\n\n\nSubject:\n D-86514\n\n\nAttempted broadcast:\n A message reverse-engineered from SCP-2544-1-1 to be perceived by the subject, containing information about Vytas Andressen known to cause \nSCP-3972\n's effect.\n\n\nExperiment conditions:\n Same as previous.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject becomes nauseated, confirming the successful deployment of SCP-3972's infohazardous effect, and is escorted to the on-site infirmary. When questioned, subject denies any knowledge regarding Vytas Andressen.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2544-02:\n On 05/23/26, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 breached containment\n7\n. While unrestrained, it created and began to spread a lethal infohazard (now designated as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588) through various infection vectors. It is believed that a minimum of 85% of the earth's population was exposed in some form, however, less than 100,000 deaths were attributed to the containment breach. Recontainment proved impractical, ultimately forcing task forces involved to terminate SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Later research found that SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 produced little or no effect in more than 95% of individuals with an AIRI higher than 20, but that a similar level of infection in a more vulnerable population would cause, with near certainty, an unavoidable XK-Class end-of-the-world scenario.\n\n\nAfter the completion of cleanup efforts, broadcast of SCP-2544 abruptly ceased. Research into the cause of the neutralization as well as attempts to recreate the effect are ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum 2544-03:\n Examination of the final SCP-2544 broadcast revealed a small amount of data encoded differently than all other recorded messages. Initial analysis seemed to indicate that no meaningful information could be recovered from the extraneous data, however, an experimental error correction scheme was applied on 06/14/26 that allowed the encoded data to be recovered\n8\n. This has been identified as an encrypted message and a standard Foundation footer appended to data sent over secure channels to establish information about the message's composer. When interpreted this way, the footer refers to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the \nTemporal Anomalies Department\n.

I don't even know how many people are still alive out there, but I can tell it's not looking good. We're out of options.

The hard work is done already; if you're reading this, the timeline was successfully modified. Now that you have an effect without a cause, you need to cause it yourself. If your Foundation can recreate the signal and send it back, the loop will be complete and the timeline will remain stable despite extratemporal influence. If it can't, we'll be facing total temporal collapse.
