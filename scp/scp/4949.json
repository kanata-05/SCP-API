This success ranges from being able to record accurate data regarding the subject's vital functions, to performing a coronary bypass surgery. Notably, no components outside of SCP-4949 are needed to perform any steps of these tasks.\n\n\nThe following document is included in SCP-4949's packaging.\n\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0SCP-4949\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Wondertainment\u2026\n\n\nand dado\n\n\nProudly Present\u2026\n\n\n\n\ndr playtime kit for the kiddos!\ntm\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to be a doctor just like in those TV shows, or maybe even like your mom or dad?

During this process, surgeon utilized one plastic syringe to administer a shot to D-1839's left thigh.\n1\n\n\nSurgeon utilized plastic Metzenbaum scissors to cut away excess flesh surrounding the visible bone break. Surgeon then used their hands to set the bone. Surgeon commented on difficulty of handling the bone due to slickness, but completed the procedure after 6 minutes.\n\n\nAttending physician directed surgeon to close D-1839's wounds. Surgeon subsequently utilized plastic suture needle to sew surgery wounds shut.\n\n\nNOTES:\n Post surgical x-rays reveal that not only were the tibia and fibula transposed in position, they appear to have been fused into a single, contiguous bone at two separate contact points. D-1839 reports no loss of mobility or balance, though has commented that their leg 'creaks' more than it used to.\n\n\nWhen debriefed, Joshua described the procedure as 'fun', indicating that he enjoyed the 'game'. Notably, at no point was D-1839's discomfort during the procedure acknowledged by Joshua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST #4:\n Extent of restorative properties.\n\n\nPATIENT AND AILMENT:\n D-3317, suffering from an inoperable brain tumor.\n\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON:\n Dr. Lucas Whitehall attending, Joshua Whitehall, age 7, operating.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n Surgeon instructed to anesthetize D-3317 and remove the tumor.\n\n\nTEST RESULTS:\n Surgeon utilized two plastic syringes to administer shots to D-3317's left and right thighs.\n2\n Surgeon proceeded to utilize stethoscope to listen to various places on D-3317's head for 3 minutes.\n\n\nSurgeon subsequently inserted 1 curette into patient's left nostril, inserting the tool 15cm into the nasal cavity before withdrawing the tool, which was trailing a 5cm mass of tumor cells.\n\n\nSubsequent imaging and blood tests confirm the absence of tumor cells within D-3317's brain.\n\n\nNOTES:\n D-3317 remains within Site-55's long-term care facility in a vegetative state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST #5:\n Extent of restorative properties.\n\n\nPATIENT AND AILMENT:\n D-8997, suffering from advanced coronary artery disease.\n\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON:\n Dr. Lucas Whitehall attending, Joshua Whitehall, age 7, operating.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n Surgeon directed to paralyze patient and perform coronary bypass surgery.\n\n\nTEST RESULTS:\n Surgeon utilized 1 syringe to administer a paralytic injection. Surgeon subsequently utilized stethoscope to listen to patient's chest and neck over the course of 1 minute before utilizing the bonesaw to bisect D-8997's neck between the axis and C3 vertebrae over the course of 7 minutes.\n\n\nSurgeon placed patient's head aside, and utilized tissue forceps to remove the patient's lungs through the neck, by way of clamping down and pulling on the patient's trachea. Surgeon followed by withdrawing the stomach via severed esophagus. Total organ removal time recorded at 12 minutes.\n\n\nSurgeon subsequently reached through D-8997's neck to withdraw his heart.\n3\n Surgeon utilized 1 scalpel to cut away a .6g mass of tissue from patient's heart.\n4\n\n\nSurgeon returned lungs and stomach to patient's torso cavity, before replacing patient's head and sewing it back in place utilizing suture needle.\n\n\nNOTES:\n Despite the arrangement of respiratory and digestive systems no longer linking to the subject's throat, D-8997 experiences no difficulty eating or excreting, and has reported only mild discomfort while taking deep breaths. Further testing confirms full recovery from coronary artery disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST #17:\n Extent of anomalous capabilities.\n\n\nPATIENT AND AILMENT:\n D-3824, no known ailments.\n\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON:\n Dr. Lucas Whitehall attending, Joshua Whitehall, age 7, operating.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n Surgeon directed to test patient for any ailments, then to increase the patient's muscle mass by 50%.\n5\n\n\nTEST RESULTS:\n Surgeon utilized otoscope, stethoscope, and reflex mallet to perform a basic physical on patient over the course of 5 minutes. Surgeon identified undiagnosed Huntington's disease, but noted no further ailments.\n\n\nSurgeon proceeded to utilize all 4 syringes to deliver a series of shots to the patient's chest and throat over the course of 8 minutes.\n6\n\n\nD-3824 observed to begin hyperventilating and heavily perspiring over 30 seconds following the final injection. Subject's skin observed to bulge and split over the following 6 minutes as muscles swelled up and burst through the skin. Following the reaction, D-3824's musculature is observed to have increased roughly 350% in mass and over 800% in volume.\n\n\nNOTES:\n D-3824 remains in Site-55 long-term care facility in a chemically induced vegetative state.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4949-17-L:\n SCP-4949 test 17 transcribed audio log.\n\n\n\nShow\u00a0transcript\u00a0of\u00a0audio\u00a0log\u00a04949-17\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0transcript\u00a0of\u00a0audio\u00a0log\u00a04949-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n< Begin log>\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n We'll use this one to make him lay still. Then, um. I don't really know how much bigger 50% is in muscles.\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n Well, just try to make his muscles a bit bigger all over his body. One and a half times their normal mass will be\u2026 well, it will be noticeably bigger.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n Alright then, I guess this one's next. The next shot will combine with it, uh, and that will start a\u2026 what's it called, da \u2014 Dr. Whitehall? We talked about it the other day.\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n A chain reaction. It will start a chain reaction, go on.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n Right, the next shot will start a chain reaction with this one. [D-3824's heavy, ragged breathing becomes audible.] I'm getting bored of this game, why do I have to keep playing it with them?\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n Joshua, please continue administering the procedure we discussed.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n This isn't fun anymore, and look\u2026 I don't think he likes the game either, can't we stop dad?\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n Joshua, listen, you were\u2026 I selected you for this project because \u2014 well because it wouldn't be right to have anyone else's kid go through this. I'm here with you, Joshua, I promise, it's ok. Please, continue.\n\n\n[D-3824's breathing becomes extraneously labored. Joshua is heard crying.]\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n It's ok. There's nothing to cry about, son.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n Dad, please?\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n Joshua, stop crying and continue the procedure.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n L-listen to him, h-he doesn't want t-to play, c-c-can't we s-stop?\n\n\nDr. Whitehall:\n Joshua Michael Whitehall, if you don't stop crying, and get over there and do as you're told, I'll give you a reason to cry.\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n [Sobbing] No, d-don't, please. I'll d-do it, dad\u2026\n\n\n[Joshua is heard to continue sobbing. D-3824's breathing becomes irregular.]\n\n\nJoshua Whitehall:\n T-there, those two w-will make his m-muscles big.\n\n\n[D-3824 begins screaming.

I shouldn't need to tell you, Doctor, that your actions during the tests didn't do you any favors, either.\n\n\n\nHowever, seeing as the request to have Joshua removed from the project and returned to his mother's custody also came from you, we are inclined to show lenience. You will be censured for a period of six months. Your expertise in directing tests of SCP-4949 have been determined to be of significant value, and as such you will not be separated from the project.\n\n\n\nFurther testing will occur with properly selected test subjects.
