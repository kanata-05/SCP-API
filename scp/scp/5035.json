The chamber is outfitted with a Chalmez-Forte Matter Stabilizing Stasis Gate.\n\n\nFollowing Incident I5035-A, access to SCP-5035 for any purpose is denied to all personnel.\n\nAccess to SCP-5035 is limited to members of Project CHARON.\n\n\nSCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B instances are to be collected and held in Dangerous Goods Storage Block 17C according to the Biosafety Level 3 standard.\n\n\nIn the event of a containment breach, all museums and institutions falling under Protocol 5035-CB are to be put under Foundation surveillance until SCP-5035 can successfully be contained. MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") are assigned to the recapture of SCP-5035 due to the risk of hazardous materials potentially manifested by SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5035 is a plaster and cloth statue depicting an African-American male wearing 19th century period accurate clothing. Attempts to remove SCP-5035's clothing have proven futile, as the anomaly is capable of quickly generating a new set using its own internal materials to enact SCP-5035-B.\n\n\nSCP-5035 spontaneously appears in museum diorama scenes relating to the American Civil War. This begins a process observed to take from one hour to seven months in completion- termed an \"Infestation Event\"- that results in the creation of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Those observing the diorama prior to the completion of an Infestation Event do not notice the presence of SCP-5035 unless explicitly told to.\n\n\nSCP-5035 will change the physical properties and appearances of objects making up the diorama to that of their real life counterparts. These transformed objects are referred to as SCP-5035-A. SCP-5035 also has the ability to modify existing objects in mass and position- taking on the appearance of entirely new objects. Modified objects are referred to as SCP-5035-B. For examples of these instances, refer to \u201cInfestation Events Log\u201d below.\n\n\nFollowing a transformation, SCP-5035 will cause the object to rapidly decompose. An Infestation Event is considered complete when SCP-5035 stops creating instances of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Upon completion, SCP-5035 will remain in the diorama until its effects are observed by a certain number of persons. The criteria- if any- for how SCP-5035 decides this is unknown, but can be inferred that it is based on the size and scale of the Infestation Event.\n\n\nSCP-5035 transforms and manipulates a diorama as an apparent form of communication, and the object appears to identify itself with an African American freedman. The end result is that of a calculated work intended to be interpreted by the observer. Upon the completion of an Infestation Event, SCP-5035 will manifest itself at a new location to repeat the process. Despite appearing only in the United States, studies show no discernible travel pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Access\u00a0Document\u00a05035-II-40022\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Infestation\u00a0Events\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Infestation Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManassas, Virginia\n\n\n5/30/2019\n\n\nA contingent of Union soldiers suffering heavy casualties at The Battle of Shiloh. A commander on horseback points forward. Soldiers load an artillery cannon. Several injured soldiers lay propped against trees, clutching their bloodstained uniforms. A soldier kneels and mourns the loss of a dead comrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Infestation Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoldiers appear posed on opposite sides of the diorama- pointing their firearms at themselves. All soldiers' faces have been changed to an unrecognizable mixture of heavily damaged organs and muscle tissue. Uniforms are unaffected except for a small, cleaved hole in the chest of each soldier, where the heart would be located. The horseback commander appears face down in a pool of blood, laying atop of his fallen horse. His arm is still outstretched forward. The horse's innards are exposed, with patches of rotting skin still attached. The skin around the torso of the animal is arranged in a pattern that appears to spell the word 'SLAVES'. SCP-5035 stands in the center of the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania\n\n\n6/10/2019\n\n\nA diorama depicting the signing of the Treaty of Appomattox. Union General Ulysses S. Grant shakes the hand of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Behind them stands a troop of Union soldiers and a few Confederate officers. A desk and a fireplace are present as scene dressing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Infestation Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entirety of the scene has been encompassed into a single, rectangular mass- in the shape of a \"\nstainless banner\n\" confederate battle flag attached to a flagpole. The pole is made of the scene's furniture and flooring, while the flag consists entirely of skin, wrapped around the collective innards of the statues. The flag's stripes are composed of the statue's cloth uniforms, with the word 'SKIN' carved into the design. SCP-5035 stands in the center of the scene. Upon further examination, the flag's innards were found in a state of decay, and were harboring a colony of maggots- sustaining themselves on the rotting organs and tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania\n\n\n6/28/2019\n\n\nA group of Union soldiers occupy a camp. Several men are standing at attention before a commanding officer. Others are sitting fireside, making rations. A drummer boy observes his instrument near a tent. The American flag stands in the rightmost corner of the diorama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Infestation Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll soldiers are kneeling in a line, chained to one another by a rope tied around each statue's neck. Uniforms and clothing have been removed, and modified into head-wraps, covering the face of each soldier. The back layer of skin of each statue has been exposed, with flaps of skin still hanging. The extraneous material from the rest of the camp has been modified into a large wooden cross, stationed at the back of the diorama. The outlines of faces in various states of distress are carved into the wood of the cross. SCP-5035 stands in the center of the scene, holding the rope connected to the chained soldiers. Drops of blood run down the face of SCP-5035, resembling tears. In front of the statue is the drum, positioned on it's side. The words 'POWER' are carved into the skin of the drum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation Area-179, Standard Containment Testing Floor\n\n\n2/29/2020\n\n\nLab 3F contained all standard-issue lab equipment found under Test Protocols V2.331-S. Lab had been properly cleaned and prepared since last usage. SCP-5035 had been compliant in testing for six hours and thirty six minutes before triggering an infestation event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Infestation Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree personnel were mutilated and killed. The innards of two were used to create sculptures that roughly resembled Area-179's senior staff. The third personnel's internal organs were compressed and removed from the body through a laceration made on the wrist- causing the personnel to appear as if they were deflated. Wasps began to manifest out of SCP-5035's form, and quickly filled the testing lab. Blood and bodily fluids from the killed personnel was collected and made to spell the word 'MASTERS' on the room's back wall. Infestation Event was stopped before completion. (See Incident Report I5035-A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0I5035-A\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Incident\u00a0Report\u00a0I5035-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Filed:\n 3/1/2020\n\n\nDate Of Occurrence:\n 2/29/2020\n\n\nLocation:\n Area-179, D-Wing, Standard Containment Testing Floor, Lab 3F\n\n\nAnomaly Involved:\n SCP-5035\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n J.

That's what SCP-5035 is classified as, and for the past seven months- that's what it was. Our tests were proving successful, and there was a certain refinement to the scenes it created- regardless of their undeniably disturbing content. This object wasn't just rotting corpses for no reason- when it altered a scene it knew what it was saying. We came to this conclusion months ago. We also came to the conclusion that- because the object was clearly fixated on visual metaphors for unpaid reparations and the sociopolitical ramifications of slavery in the United States- keeping it locked in a cell unattended with zero non-standard containment procedures was probably a shit idea. We were right.\n\n\nAround 19:00, Junior Researcher M\nartinez\n, Officer S\nmith\n, and Lab Assistant D\navies\n were performing tests on SCP-5035 in Laboratory 3F. Security feeds show that at 19:23, SCP-5035 began manifesting its anomalous effects in the form of a SCP-5035-A instance that resulted in M\nartinez\n's scalp suddenly tearing itself open, exposing her cerebrum. S\nmith\n attempted to reach for his firearm, but SCP-5035 had elongated and twisted the officer's digits, rendering them useless. Mass began to rapidly generate in S\nmith\n's hands, forcing him to the ground. D\navies\n was able to sound an alarm, but the doors to Laboratory 3F were unable to be opened. The footage shows what appear to be string-thin veins exposed from the wrists of D\navies\n being pulled across the laboratory floor and into the door's vacuum duct, clogging and sealing the door shut. D\navies\n was repeatedly slammed against the door, pulled by his veins. The security team was unable to access the door to Laboratory 3F. At approximately 19:28.32, the security feed cut out, presumably due to an unseen SCP-5035-B instance interfering.\n\n\nFor the next thirty minutes or so, the security team tried to cut into Laboratory 3F. Then, I showed up. The team had already gotten in, so I was able to see the monstrosity SCP-5035 had created using the remains of the testing group- which now resembled crude depictions of Area-179's staff. That fucker even had the gall to make a sculpture of me out of M\nartinez\n\u2018s muscle tissue, complete with a bottle of \nbrand name\n in one hand, and a noose in the other- funny joke. As I anticipated, my [DATA EXPUNGED] proved useful in dealing with the anomaly, and was able to keep it occupied until we were able to retrieve a Stasis Gate from offsite. Why we didn\u2019t have a spare in storage or for emergency purposes is beyond my understanding. Such is the state of Area-179. Regardless, it\u2019s secure now.\n\n\nSpecial containment procedures update and object reclassification to Euclid pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING ADDENDUM IS LEVEL #4/5035 CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/5035 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    ID\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        bd694afdec5b43978a08fc866cc1fe85_1740236675\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    PASSWORD\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        dd19dd41a33bb53b39c052fbd33c25c7_1740236675\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Edward T.
