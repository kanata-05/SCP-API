Ritual-7006 must be performed exactly once each year, as further detailed in this document.\n\n\nIf Ritual-7006 is performed unsuccessfully, the Foundation must act according to Level Gamma emergency procedures until the next year arrives.\n\n\nDue to its deep connection to the Foundation\n.\n \nRadix:\n Item has been integrated into the Foundation's command structure.\n , information regarding SCP-7006 and Ritual-7006 must be kept secret. Groups of Interest external to the Foundation learning of SCP-7006 is considered a failure of the Veil Protocol.\n\n\nIn the event that Ritual-7006 loses its potence, Foundation thaumatologists are to be employed in order to engineer a new, successful variant of it as soon as is possible.\n\n\nThe date presently dedicated to the completion of Ritual-7006 is August 1st.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-7006 is a powerful thaumaturgical bond which closely links the SCP Foundation to three conceptual entities existing outside of normative reality, maintained and strengthened by the \nRitual of Absolution\n.\n\n\nThese three entities \u2014 classically referred to as the \nTriad of Absolutes\n (or: the \nTriad\n; the \nAbsolutes\n) \u2014 collectively exert a formidable, generalized influence on the day-to-day affairs and activities of the Foundation at large; this extends to the following areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment efforts\n\n\nRitualistic practices\n\n\nThaumaturgical practices\n\n\nParascientific innovation\n\n\nStrategic practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBureaucratic processes\n\n\nInternal and external security\n\n\nDefensive practices\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe influence exerted on the above areas of Foundation activity is, of great note, wholly positive \u2014 while a sufficient relationship between the Foundation and the \nTriad\n is maintained through Ritual-7006, the Foundation's efforts will, seemingly by chance, yield fruitful results.\n\n\nThough both SCP-7006's and the \nTriad's\n full history with the Foundation is not known, it is understood that this bond is one that has acted as a longstanding boon for almost the totality of our organization's existence. While SCP-7006 is maintained, the Foundation flourishes. It is presumed that the bond's presence is responsible for propelling the Foundation to the grandiose logistical successes it knows today.\n\n\nIf Ritual-7006 is not performed during a given year, or fails, SCP-7006's positive effects will begin to diminish; this progresses on an annual basis for an unknown duration, presumably ending with the bond's total severance. According to record, this has never occurred.\n\n\nIt is not known what such an event entails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRITUAL-7006:\n Ritual-7006 (\nRitual of Absolution\n, \nCeremony of Absolution\n, \nThe Providence\n) is an ornate thaumaturgical procession which alters probability (also known as 'luck', 'chance', 'fate' or \u2018destiny\u2019) to favor the Foundation's mission of Securement, Containment, and Protection. This is accomplished through a series of rites which involve several 'lucky' or 'unlucky' items, events, sigils, signifiers, and superstitions. Among these are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRitual-7006, as expressed via recursive iconographic notation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conduction of a lottery among select Foundation staff; the winner is awarded a cash prize, and the winning ticket is torn into sevenths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe burning of forty four-leafed clovers atop a ritual pyre, which uses 1/7th of the aforementioned lottery ticket as fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlipping a gold coin until it comes up heads ten times in a row, and then biting down on the coin so that it bends in half.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temporary retirement of a member of the O5 Council, so that the Council numbers twelve instead of thirteen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConducting no work on Friday the 13th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling dice fashioned from magical materials such as human bone and meteorites, and the destruction of such dice that roll below their median more than 50% of the allotted time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance of Ritual-7006-Warden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARDEN:\n Ritual-7006-Warden is a unique rite in which the conditions of each \nAbsolute\n are allegorically appeased inside of a constructed fictional environment. The performance of Ritual-7006-Warden is by far the most difficult and variable part of Ritual-7006, as for it to be effective there must be a non-negligible possibility of failure.\n\n\nRitual-7006-Warden makes use of a role-playing framework recovered by the Foundation from an anomalous \"wargames\" society operating in England during the late 19th century. Lightly changed by Foundation thaumatologists to suit the needs of Ritual-7006, this framework has proven immensely effective at fulfilling the symbological and ritualistic needs of the \nTriad\n in an environment with an efficiently low level of immediate physical consequences.\n\n\nThrough 7006-Warden, ritualists play the roles of Avatars, together forming a fantastical \"party\" collectively representing the Foundation, embarking on three missions representing the qualities of each \nAbsolute\n. Succeeding in these missions (henceforth called \"modules\") contributes to Ritual-7006's efficiency; if one or more are failed, this likely causes Ritual-7006 as a whole to fail, or to be massively weakened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformances of Ritual-7006-Warden take place atop a Foundation sigil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRULESET:\n A condensed form of Ritual-7006-Warden's rules have been provided below; for a full version, personnel may consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n7006-Warden\n\n\nOFFICIAL HANDBOOK\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nABILITIES:\n\n\nSTR:\n Physicality, brawn & toughness.\n\n\nDEX:\n Speed, sneaking & precision.\n\n\nCTRL:\n Willpower, charm & the weird.\n\n\n\n\nSAVES:\n\nRoll d20 equal to or under target \nAbility\n. The party at most risk in a contested action makes the save.\n\n\n\n\nHIT PROTECTION:\n\n\nHP\n reflects an Avatar's ability to avoid damage (both from Damage and Stress).\n\n\n\n\nHEALING:\n\nA quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the Avatars exposed. \nAbility\n loss requires a week's rest with medical intervention or magical means.\n\n\n\n\nDEPRIVATION:\n\n\nDeprived\n keeps an Avatar from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to an Avatar's inventory. \nFatigue\n takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times.\n\n\n\n\nINVENTORY:\n\nAvatars each have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. \nBulky\n items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.\n\n\n\n\nMAGIC:\n\nA new spell is created each morning. It is random or is a copy of one from the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell. If deprived or in danger, a CTRL save may be required to avoid dire consequences. See \nthis table\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\nACTIONS:\n\nOn their turn, Avatars may move up to 40ft and take a single action. Actions may take the form of casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable activity. These take place simultaneously.\n\n\nRetreating\n from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.\n\n\n\n\nFor the \nStart of Combat\n round, Avatars must pass an DEX save in order to act.\n\n\nSubsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.\n\n\nCOMBAT:\n\nAll attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their \nStress\n or \nDamage\n die, subtract any protections from \nArmor\n (Damage) or \nStability\n (Stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess Damage is dealt to STR and excess Stress is dealt to CTRL.\n\n\nIf there are \nMultiple attackers\n, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.\n\n\nUnarmed\n attacks always do 1d4 Damage. \nImpaired\n attacks (position of weakness) reduce Damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. \nEnhanced\n attacks (position of advantage) increase Damage die to 1d12. \nBlast\n affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.\n\n\n\n\nDAMAGE:\n\nDamage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid \nCritical Damage\n. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.\n\n\nHaving STR 0 means \ndeath\n; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 means they are lost.\n\n\n\n\nSTRESS AND FALLOUT:\n\nRitualist chooses from the \nStress Fallout\n table when either:\n\n\n\n\nStress reduces an Avatar's HP to exactly 0.\n\n\nAn Avatar takes Critical Stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)\n\n\n\n\nEach Stress Fallout entry:\n\n\n\n\nCan only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).\n\n\nConsumes an inventory slot.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the six Avatars prepared for this year's 7006-Warden performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVATARS:\n Ritual-7006-Warden is intended to be performed with two to six pre-constructed Avatars (player characters, party members) created using the game system, collectively representing aspects of the Foundation. These Avatars are refreshed annually in order to adapt to the changing circumstances befalling the previous year.

She was grown to be in peak physical condition at twenty-five years of age, but nobody counted on her being intelligent.\n\n\nThe Foundation required a brute who responded to chemical signals and electrical stimulus. They were gifted with a predator who learned to read at three days old, learned to escape her cell at four days old, and killed her \u2018father\u2019, the head of Project Bellona, before the month was out. Since then, she\u2019s been used by the Foundation to eliminate\u2026 \u2018priority targets\u2019.

His father was a museum curator, and he was always told to follow in his footsteps and keep the family tradition alive. However, in the process of growing his collection, he ran afoul of a certain organization.\n\n\nAn artifact brought to him from the far east was found to be trafficked by an insurgent organization working against the Foundation. The artifact, a small piece of jade shaped like a pill, let off an aura that beckoned whoever was near it to consume it. Orville kept it locked under glass, which seemed to abate the effect. However, the artifact\u2019s properties were known to the Foundation, who soon came knocking.\n\n\nOrville was reluctant to part with it, but part with it he did \u2014 or he attempted to, at any rate. Instead, he found himself absently stuffing the pill down his throat while explaining its anomalous properties. From that day, a single command overrode his psyche: Collect. He did not know what to Collect, or why. But when the Foundation saw this change, they offered him either surgery and amnesticization, or a position.\n\n\nHe took the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\n\n\n\n\nStudy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvatar\n\n\nDr. Imani Monroe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP \n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEX \n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTRL \n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Features\n\n\n\n\nWell-Studied\n\n\n\n\nOnce in each Combat, this Avatar may roll an opposed CTRL Save.

This was because Imani\u2019s affliction was spiritual \u2014 she was being haunted by a creature that none could see.\n\n\nThat was until a fateful day, when she was still a teenager. Imani suffered a horrible acute headache: a swelling. The best course of action the doctors could think of was to cut open her skull to relieve the pressure. When she awoke, she could see the thing haunting her in all its detail. It was not long before she set about trying to kill it.\n\n\nWhen she read that charms of bone can repel evil, she carved a charm using a piece of her own skull (since replaced by metal plates) and managed to destroy her tormentor.

It was given to him by a woman with vibrant green eyes \u2014 an old guardian \u2014 who gave him his mission to be a storyteller. His name is inside the book, but it is transient, travelling from page to page, cover to cover. There are seven-hundred and seventy-six other names in the book, storytellers all; he often finds the names crossed out, and the storytellers dead, vanished, or somehow corrupted.\n\n\nHe discovered the Foundation after investigating a name linked to them, and was abruptly exposed to the wider world of the anomalous. Bayan accepted the supernatural with open arms, for he knows that the only way to unravel the secret of his book is to find the woman who gave it to him, and to do that, he must become familiar with this new world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense\n\n\n\n\nDefense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvatar\n\n\nEtzli Montenegro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP \n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR \n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEX \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTRL \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Features\n\n\n\n\nTil' My Last Breath\n\n\n\n\nIf this Avatar receives Critical Damage, they may make a CTRL Save.

The patient demonstrated this by causing two other patients in the same tent \u2014 who had been recovering \u2014 to keel over in a pool of their own blood.\n\n\nThis thing, not a human, was being targeted by the Foundation for containment, and when they learned Etzli was responsible for its death, the Foundation delivered an ultimatum: join us, or never work as a medic again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\"We have everything to lose, but everything to gain.
