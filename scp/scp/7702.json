The current iteration is restricted to the involved detachment of Mobile Task Force Nu-7 \"Hammer Down\" until the threat posed by SCP-7702-D is stabilized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map of SCP-7702. SCP-7702-A is visible in the center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-7702\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to its capabilities, permanent containment of SCP-7702 is not possible. In lieu of this, the Buyan Protocol has been developed at Site-59 to minimize civilian exposure to SCP-7702.\n\n\nProject Buyan consists of the following tools:\n\n\n\n\nBuyan-1 is a computer cluster designed to co-opt civilian and military satellite mapping systems to track all SCP-7702 appearances. As such, it can triangulate SCP-7702's new location in a minimum of five minutes after a relocation event.\n\n\nBuyan-2 is an automated webcrawler that locates and suppresses any discussions on the internet about SCP-7702.\n\n\nBuyan-3 is a heavily armored remote-controlled drone driven by propellers. Through the usage of its experimental Buyan-3A module\n1\n, it can instantaneously relocate two kilometers above any whole-number latitude/longitude input on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nOnce a new location is identified and mapped by Buyan-1, Project Buyan staff will examine the surrounding area and determine whether to implement Response Buyan-A or -B.\n\n\n\n\nBuyan-A: If SCP-7702 is in an area with a low population density, Foundation Agents will be stationed in the surrounding area to discretely bar civilians from entry.\n\n\n\nThis is to be done with discretion, so as to delay another relocation event for as long as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyan-B: If SCP-7702 is in an area where a higher population density increases the likelihood of civilian encounters, Buyan-3 is to be deployed to SCP-7702's location and infiltrate the perimeter.\n\n\n\nThe infiltration must be done as noisily and obviously as possible. If this fails to instantly force a relocation event, the drone operator is to take the following actions until relocation is obtained:\n\n\n\nVandalism of SCP-7702-A with the onboard paint gun.\n\n\nFlying obnoxiously close to SCP-7702-B.\n\n\nUsage of the onboard speakers to cheerfully inform SCP-7702-B that the area is under SCP Foundation control. Should this fail, the conversation will continue in an increasingly irritating manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll instances of SCP-7702-C are to be cordoned off from the public under the cover of private land development.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7702 refers to an area of forested wetlands comprising one square kilometer.\n\nThe interior of SCP-7702 consists of a circular pond surrounded by a thick border of mangroves. The trees have an anomalous repulsive effect on matter trying to pass between them.\n\n\nSCP-7702 is capable of teleportation through unknown means. The range of its teleportation is unknown, but all reported sightings have been in temperate, humid biomes, with most recorded appearances occurring in the Southeastern United States, Africa, and South Asia.\n\n\nAccess to SCP-7702 is only possible through an opening on the southern border. The opening leads to a wooden pontoon bridge across the pond to SCP-7702-A.\n\n\nSCP-7702-A refers to a 200 meter x 200 meter x 10 meter barn built on a wooden pier on the center of the pond. The barn has no doors; the only known way to intentionally enter the barn is through a small corrugated-metal shack attached to the southern wall.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B is a humanoid entity of variable appearance. In Buyan-1 surveillance footage, SCP-7702-B is most often seen on a lawn chair next to the shack's entrance. SCP-7702-B changes its appearance and spoken language to suit the community's majority mental image of a hospitable, eccentric, and harmless bartender.\n\n\nWhen provoked, SCP-7702-B can trigger a relocation event by clapping. These are most often provoked by what SCP-7702-B perceives to be anyone who, in its own words, \"came for something other than a drink.\"\n\n\nThe only other known anomalous capability of SCP-7702-B is that its urine has a pH of 0.5. (See addendum)\n\n\nAreas previously occupied by SCP-7702 become instances of SCP-7702-C: a one-square-kilometer patch of thin, black slime primarily consisting of genetic material that does not correspond to any mundane organism. Making physical contact with the slime causes a human subject to experience an intense feeling of paranoia, which ends once the slime is removed.\n\n\nIt's unknown what happens to anything within SCP-7702's new location before it materializes, but nothing has been recovered.\n\n\nBehavior:\n SCP-7702-B uses SCP-7702 to lure humans into SCP-7702-A. Through unknown means, the appearance of SCP-7702 triggers rumors in the surrounding community of a secret bar where \"the best drink in the Universe\" is served. The name and type of the purported beverage is inconsistent, usually aligning with the community's preference.\n\n\nOnce a human subject arrives, SCP-7702-B welcomes them inside the shack for a sample of the beverage. While SCP-7702-B will allow a subject to refuse the offer and leave, no subject who has accepted the offer has ever been recovered.\n\n\nExploration:\n On 1/12/22, Undercover Foundation researchers in the extradimensional space known as \nThe Wanderer's Library\n reported consistencies between SCP-7702 and a predatory entity in \nCorbenic\n known as [DATA EXPUNGED]. To properly assess this relationship, an undercover exploration of SCP-7702 was ordered for 2/5/22. In addition to a hidden body camera, the agent involved would be implanted with SCP-2922 in order to explain, if needed, the post-mortem effects of SCP-7702.\n\n\nThough this was meant to be done with a D-class staff member, Dr. Amelia Salas, a researcher at Site-59, expressed great interest and volunteered for the mission.\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Lisle Naismith [\npcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl#pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl\n]\n\n\nTo:\n Overseer Council\n\n\nSubject:\n Personnel Change Request\n\n\nRelevant Employee Information:\n\n\nPersonal Details\n\n\nName:\n Dr. Amelia Victoria Salas Maldonado\n\n\nGender:\n Female\n\n\nAge:\n 27\n\n\nBirthplace:\n Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\n\nLanguages Spoken:\n English, Spanish, Japanese\n\n\nSpecialty:\n Anomalies involving electronics, computers, and radio waves\n\n\nAdditional Skills:\n Attained a fifth-dan ranking in kendo as a civilian; often called in for testing with sword anomalies\n\n\nProfessional Details\n\n\nPosition:\n Class-C Researcher at Site-59\n\n\nSecurity Clearance:\n Level 4\n\n\nCurrently Assigned Item:\n \nSCP-2527\n\n\nPreviously Assigned Items:\n \n(abridged list \u2014 more information available in her \nSCiPnet listing\n.)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7373\n\n\nSCP-3162\n\n\nSCP-3137\n\n\nSCP-2845\n\n\nSCP-3034\n \u2014 \nNote:\n Used experimental radio-wave hacking technology to identify the entity responsible for the transmissions. Due to the resulting intense psychological trauma, amnestics were issued.\n\n\nSCP-2803\n \u2014 \nNote:\n Longest assignment. Developed a pacifying rapport with SCP-2803-A. Upon leaving, Dr. Salas was named \"honeraryee TotleighSoft SHAR HLODER off teh MUNF!\" \n(sp)\n by SCP-2803-A.\n\n\nSCP-231\n \u2014 \nNote:\n Due to staff shortages and logistical issues, Dr. Salas was called in on 4/19/21 to oversee Procedure 110-Montauk. Amnestics were issued immediately thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil,\n\n\nI've been looking into the history of the volunteer you've allowed to participate in the upcoming 2922-assisted exploration of SCP-7702. I'd be the last to deny that she has - at one point - been a valuable asset here at Site-59. The aspect of sending her on a potential suicide mission sobers me.\n\n\nBut that's not why I'm making this request. Site-59's internal mental health department has brought an important variable to my attention.\n\n\nThere have been reports of Dr. Salas remembering things she shouldn't have. Nothing illicit, but seemingly mundane information, such as what her breakfast was on the morning before she was amnesticized.\n\n\nThere is a nonzero chance that Dr. Salas is immune to amnestics.\n\n\nThis is only hypothetical, of course. I'm doubtful that the cause is anomalous; more likely, the product of genetics and incompatible brain chemistry.\n\n\nBut if true, this would be the first recorded case of this condition, which the research team and I have since named Myosotis\n2\n. I suppose if you extrapolated this problem, we would need to screen all employees for potential Myosotis.\n\n\nOn a more relevant note, if Dr. Salas does indeed have Myosotis, then that would mean she remembers having assisted with some of the most mentally scarring assignments we have to offer \u2014 including Procedure 110-Montauk, the containment procedures for \nSCP-2845\n, and [5/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 CLEARANCE REQUIRED].\n\n\nIn all likelihood, she puts up a front of ignorance to avoid termination, while internally processing an inordinate amount of psychological trauma when alone.\n\n\nThe behavioral citations may also have something to do with this. Over the course of her five years of service, I've personally seen her grow more bitter, aggressive, and melancholy by the day. The only times she shows any positive emotions anymore are when she's destroying our morale with tasteless wisecracks. Her poor attitude has alienated her colleagues save for a handful of friends in the IT department, and even they have to walk on eggshells to keep her from cursing someone out.\n\n\nThis has also negatively affected her performance. She only really shines when she's working with TotleighSoft anomalies. Word of mouth among staff is that she finds something in the blind naivete of \"P. Hudson Gock\" that makes her feel nostalgia for when she was still dreaming of joining the Foundation one day, rather than actually participating.\n\n\n(When she first joined us, her enthusiasm for the science of anomalies was infectious. Truth be told, I find it hard to hold this negativity against her \u2014 if even the brightest mind among us were resistant to amnestics, they, too, would be struggling like this.)\n\n\nThe point is, Dr. Salas's mind is in a very bad place right now, so she may not have volunteered in good faith. I believe she's trying to use an anomaly with a near-100% disappearance rate as a means of suicide.\n\n\nConsider this my request to remand Dr. Salas into observation until an alternative method of amnestics can be implemented.\n\n\n- Director Naismith\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Overseer Council\n\n\nTo:\n Lisle Naismith [\npcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl#pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl\n]\n\n\nSubject:\n Personnel Change Request\n\n\nRequest denied. Send her into SCP-7702 as planned.\n\n\n\"Myosotis\" is definitely worth looking into, but it's still only a hypothesis. More research is needed before this condition can be a deciding factor in our operations.\n\n\nAs for Dr. Salas \u2014 your concern for your employees' well-being is commendable. But you would do well to remember how common it is for civilians to grow to hate their job \nwithout\n supernatural aid.\n\n\nSCP-7702 has not yet appeared in Central Park on a hot day. But the fact that this is hypothetically possible means that we can't waste any more time in finding a way to prevent that from happening.\n\n\nBesides, if she \ndoes\n want to die, then that makes her a more ethical candidate for this investigation than someone who doesn't.\n\n\n- O5-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation Log - 2/5/22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The time is 12:59 EST. Dr. Salas activates the hidden camera on her lapel as she steps on the pontoon bridge.)\n\n\n(Proceeding down the bridge, Salas swats away a swarm of gnats.)\n\n\nSalas:\n Fuck off.\n\n\n(More gnats surround her as she approaches SCP-7702-A. One lands on the camera lens.)\n\n\nSalas:\n \n(mumbling)\n It's all coming together. This state has more than enough land assholes. They gotta fill the air with assholes too. That's \nscience.\n\n\n(She smashes the gnat on the camera, causing severe turbulence in the footage.)\n\n\n(The sudden movement has startled SCP-7702-B awake from a nap in its chair. SCP-7702-B takes the appearance of a middle-aged Caucasian man with a Cajun accent. He wears a striped outfit with a bowtie typical of turn-of-the-century American bartenders.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Aw, hell, did I die in my sleep? Cause you got a look about the eyes like you're the grim reaper himself. Rest of you ain't too bad, though! \nRawr.\n\n\nSalas:\n Thanks for the opinion. Eat a dick.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Speakin' of which, I assume you're here 'bout \nL'Orgasmaise?\n\n\nSalas:\n The what, now?\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B gasps with delight. He stands up.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n My sister in Christ, you don't know about \nL'Orgasmaise?!\n\n\nSalas:\n I'm too thirsty to know or care what that is. Do you have something to drink?\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Ain't that a coincidence. \nL'Orgasmaise\n is absolutely something to drink. It is \nthe\n thing to drink! It's a special kinda moonshine made from a recipe found scrawled on the wall of a dead lunatic's cell in a Baton Rouge asylum. The poor bastard up and went nuts in pursuit of the greatest white lightning on Earth. And he died for it \u2014 but the minute he walked past them gates, all the purdiest angels in Heaven lined up two-by-two just to yank up their skirts and twiddle his pickle, 'cause hot DAMN did he ever succeed in what he set out to do!\n\n\n(Salas audibly tries to force a more pleasant tone of voice.)\n\n\nSalas:\n You know something? I genuinely hate you. Get me your drink and fuck off.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n That's the spirit, \ncher!\n Less talkie, more drinkie. Come on in and drink you some. First one's free!\n\n\n(Salas follows SCP-7702-B into the shack. They sit down at opposite ends of a circular patio table lit by a single kerosene lamp. There's a damp wooden door in the back. A streak of dried blood on the rug leads to the bottom of the door.)\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B pulls out a blurry glass bottle and two shot glasses from a nearby cabinet.)\n\n\nSalas:\n How can I be sure this isn't just cyanide?\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nAlors pas,\n darlin' \u2014 I'm havin' a shot, too. What's wrong? Have I given you any reason not to trust me? What lies have them Foundation eggheads been tellin' ya?\n\n\nSalas:\n What \"Foundation?\"\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B snickers. He leans down and addresses her hidden camera directly.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Check out your girl, all \n\"wHaT fOuNdAtIoN?\"\n\n\n(Judging from the sound and SCP-7702-B's reaction, Salas reaches for her gun.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Awww, ain't no need for that, sugarplum!\n\n\nSalas:\n Give me one reason why not.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Just one? Aim higher! I could give ya \ntwelve.\n\n\nSalas:\n Enough with the bullshit.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nD'accord, d'accord\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B's voice completely changes. It drops the accent and addresses Salas with a somber but sympathetic tone.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n So long as we're both dropping the act, let's start over. Good afternoon, Dr. Amelia Salas.\n\n\n(Salas's heart rate in the corner of the camera feed spikes.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n I've heard a great deal about you from my master. He knows what the Foundation has made you go through. I've seen the memories you've been trying to purge for five years.\n\n\nSalas:\n How much does your \"master\" know?\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B glances at the camera, then back to Salas.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Enough to know that you deserve better. So here's my question to you: we both know what the Foundation wants here, but what do \nyou\n want?\n\n\nSalas:\n To get this bullshit investigation over with.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n But after that?\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n(Salas places her elbows on the table and holds her forehead in her hands.)\n\n\nSalas:\n \u2026I want it to stop.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n And \"it\" is\u2026\n\n\nSalas:\n Everything! Fucking everything, all right?! I wanna go back to ten years ago when I didn't know anything about the Foundation. It's\u2026 look, I wanna get it off my chest, but there's not a lot I can ethically justify explaining to an enemy.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Who says you have to be literal about it? Just look at Aesop. He knew that his morals wouldn't have had such lasting power unless he used talking animals.\n\n\nSalas:\n I guess. I've done things for the safety of the world that require me to\u2026 tear out my \"I'm still a good person\" gland and throw it away. Then immediately afterwards, they give me a prosthetic gland as compensation. But they never have the prosthetic in my size \u2014 and if I let them know that, I'm dead.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n I'm sorry, but that's objectively the shittiest metaphor I've ever heard.\n\n\nSalas:\n Fuck off.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n But let's work with it anyway. When you have to tear it out again, do you just tear out something else inside you to keep up the illusion \u2014 until you're empty?\n\n\nSalas:\n \u2026pretty much, yeah.\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B nods, then pours out two shots of the substance in the bottle \u2014 a greenish-brown liquid similar in consistency to olive oil.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n My master has spoken. He says he'll give you the peace you seek. There are two ways we could go about giving it to you. The first\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B waves its free hand. Seventeen rusty pipes with sharpened tips fly up from the floor. They float in the air around Salas. She looks around to see what's going on. The camera moves with her enough to display that the bladed end of the pipe is pressing against her femoral artery.)\n\n\n(Her heart rate doubles in the corner of the screen.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n ..that's the easy option. But any reward you get out of it will be over before it can be enjoyed.\n\n\nSalas:\n And what's the other option?\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B grabs one of the full shot glasses and motions for Salas to do the same. She does, causing the pipes to fall against the floor all at once.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n It's this. You've probably inferred by now that it isn't whiskey.\n\n\nSalas:\n Then what is it?\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n I can't truly explain it in any way that makes sense to a human. So here's the short answer: it's the only path to the true serenity that self-important traitors like JALAK\u00c5RA have denied your race. The only way to truly \nexist.\n\n\n(Seven seconds of silence. The glass quivers in Salas's hand.)\n\n\nSalas:\n What does it taste like?\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n Orange Faygo.\n\n\nSalas:\n Fuck it, sold.\n\n\n(They toast. Salas drinks it quickly.)\n\n\n(The heart rate suddenly shifts to zero, where it remains. She falls backwards in her chair.)\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B looms over her. It grins menacingly at the hidden camera. It indicates the full glass of liquid in its hand before shattering it against the wall.)\n\n\n(Over the next minute, SCP-7702-B drags Salas's body into SCP-7702-A. Only bits and pieces of the ceiling can be seen through the camera. Hundreds of flies appear in every sunbeam peeking through the cracked roof.)\n\n\n(The labored breathing of an enormous, unidentified animal can be heard on the other side of the barn.)\n\n\n(Salas falls approximately three meters down a pit in the floor. The sound of her landing is soft and wet. It's too dark to see. More flies are heard.)\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B falls into the pit feet-first. It turns over Salas's body and removes the camera from her blazer. In the process of moving the camera, it's shown that Salas has been placed on top of an unidentifiable amount of decomposing human bodies.)\n\n\n(After climbing up a ladder back to the floor of SCP-7702-A, SCP-7702-B places the camera on the floor. The accent from the initial meeting returns.)\n\n\nSCP-7702-B:\n \nAlors,\n before I pack my bags again, I got a present for y'all. This here's a performance art piece I like to call \"\nLa seule chose que je dis \u00e0 la Fondation\n\", and it goes a little somethin' like this\u2026\n\n\n(SCP-7702-B disrobes and starts angrily urinating on the camera. The feed cuts off seven seconds later.)\n\n\n(Note: The camera's remains were recovered in the resulting instance of SCP-7702-C, along with a small puddle of the caustic substance that destroyed it.)\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n Immediately following Dr. Salas's death in the investigation, the phone at Site-59 assigned to her SCP-2922 implant received 2,384 voicemail messages over the course of five seconds. (It is unknown how SCP-2922 was able to circumvent the phone's data storage limits.)\n\n\nEfforts to transcribe the messages and to contact Dr. Salas are ongoing via Project Th\u00f6kk\u2026\n\n\n@\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Project\u00a0Th\u00f6kk\u00a0Logs,\u00a0Part\u00a01\u00a0of\u00a02\u00a0[abridged]\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[Close]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice from the Project Th\u00f6kk Transcription Team\n\n\nFirst of all, this log has been abridged to allow for only the significant portions. For the unabridged log, please contact us directly.\n\n\nI've heard reports from the telepathy research department about Dr. Salas's particular iteration of SCP-2922. They've been tinkering with a copy of the SCP-2922 to make a newer version that could better help the exploration of areas like Corbenic. This prototype version was given to Salas.\n\n\nWhat this means in the way of transcription is that the logs also pick up any noise picked up by Salas's ears. We don't believe that Salas was aware that she had transmitted some of these.\n\n\n- Keith Pauling, Chief Transcription Liaison for Project Th\u00f6kk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The sound of a light breeze blowing through dense foliage is heard.)\n\n\nSalas:\n \u2026there's an afterlife, isn't there? Godfuckingdammit.\n\n\n(Footsteps through thick grass, presumably Salas's.)\n\n\nYou know what I hate the most about 2922? No dial tone. You can never tell if it's working. So I'm just gonna leave this shit on for as long as possible until someone picks up the phone. Shouldn't be too hard.\n\n\nAnyway, hey guys, it's \nme,\n Janet Spiegel of the Three Moons Initiative. I hate you guys so much that I ditched my husband to eat the Spider God's asshole for eternity or whatever.\n\n\n(She chuckles.)\n\n\nFOR SECURITY PURPOSES I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT I'M KIDDING. \u2026fuckin' tightwads.\n\n\nLast thing I can remember was having a shot of something that absolutely did \nnot\n taste like Orange Faygo. My chest seized up as soon as the first drop hit my tongue. I heard my head crack against the floor. It sounded like someone breaking a handful of chalk by squeezing their fist.\n\n\nIt disturbed me, all right. But in terms of pain\u2026is it weird that dying was just mildly uncomfortable, at the worst? That poison must have also numbed me.\n\n\nOH! That reminds me! I'm dead, so I'm no longer under the disciplinary team's jurisdiction. With that in mind, here's my uncensored opinion of everyone at Site-59, in alphabetical order\u2026\n\n\n[This section ran for 28 minutes and 15 seconds. The transcription team has voted unanimously against adding it to the record.]\n\n\n\u2026eh, I'll just finish this later once I remember that janitor's name.\n\n\nBut it's not like I have anything better to do, so I'll describe my surroundings.\n\n\nSky: pastel pink. Overcast with white clouds. I can't find the sun, but it's pretty hot here; I'd say 30\u00b0 C. I'm in a rainforest with some white limestone plateaus in the near distance. I'm surrounded by navy-blue ferns, green-petaled sunflowers, and black ponds. Everything's wet. The air smells like a mile-high heap of ground cinnamon - it's hard to breathe sometimes.\n\n\nThe only animals I've seen so far are these tiny black & white frogs. Their front legs are the amphibian equivalent of bat wings. They don't croak or chirp, they just make this low booming moan sound, loud enough for a creature twenty times its size. They can fly and swim, but they seem to have trouble walking. There's a ton of these little fuckers.\n\n\nWhat's more, I woke up with my clothes. Or at least I think they are. It takes the appearance and color of what I was wearing, but the material feels different \u2014 almost like dry leaves.\n\n\nI felt some vines under the small of my back snap as I got up. I'm starting to think that some kind of jungle plant grew some clothes around me. That's\u2026 nice of that plant, I guess. Bet it didn't think I'd reward it with mutilation. Lemme check where my back was.\n\n\n(Her footsteps sound again.)\n\n\nYep, the clothes plant is dead.\n\n\nLook, I've heard talk about 7702 being associated with Corbenic, but this isn't like anything from the reports from \nGalahad\n. This ain't Corbenic. Part of me still doubts Corbenic even exists in the first place.\n\n\nI don't know what the hell this place is. Then again, I also haven't moved more than five feet from where I woke up.\n\n\nYou know what? I'll go ahead and give this dimension a serious look-around for y'all \u2014 but only on the condition that if other humans find it, we don't start immediately murdering the natives and putting Burger Kings over their monuments. I don't wanna put \"I helped with that\" on my resume.\n\n\n(She laughs sardonically. The laughter quickly fades.)\n\n\nOn second thought, I've done worse by default.\n\n\n(Leaves are heard violently rustling nearby.)\n\n\nHuh?\n\n\n(There's a sudden, piercing sound that has the properties of a howl, a purr, and a battle cry. While menacing, there's also an inexplicably joyful tone in the sound.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #2\n\n\n\n\n(Salas breaths heavily.)\n\n\nSalas:\n So, uh, think I lost him for now. I wanna say I ran into some kind of local apex predator, but\u2026 it was wearing pants. Just, these baggy and crudely-woven linen trousers. But it was trying to pounce on me teeth-first. I feel like knowing why the local carnivore wears pants is above my pay grade, and\u2014\n\n\n(The sound happens again.)\n\n\nSalas:\n Aaaand, here he is now. Say hi, jackass.\n\n\n(Snarling. The sound of a struggle.)\n\n\n[Note: The tone of Salas's voice carries a different cadence than her telepathic transmissions. Hereafter, \"(V)\" will be used to indicate what she speaks rather than what she thinks, whereas (M) will denote mental transmissions.]\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Get the fuck off me!\n\n\n(The struggle stops.)\n\n\n(The entity that made the howling noise vocalizes questioningly.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n What?!\n\n\n(It speaks in a raspy and animalistic basso-profundo tone, notably masculine.)\n\n\nEntity:\n The food talks?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Call me \"the food\" again. \nDo it.\n\n\n(The entity groans with disappointment. Its body can be heard slumping off of Salas's.)\n\n\nEntity:\n Talk-food is not eat-food.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n The hell are you talking about?\n\n\nEntity:\n Um\u2026 were you really looking forward to being eat-food? Sorry to disappoint you. I mean, if it's anything, I \ndo\n think you look tasty, it's just \u2014 I don't know how to describe it, but eating talk-food always has this big pile of \nsad\n about it afterwards, you know?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nI am not food.\n\n\nEntity:\n Look, talk-food, I dunno how to tell you this, but everything in the Universe is either food or try-real-hard-food.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nMy name is Amelia.\n\n\nEntity:\n Melyah-food! That's a new one.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nFUCK OFF!\n\n\n(The entity gasps with delight.)\n\n\nEntity:\n I like yelling, \ntoo!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Ugh, just\u2014\n\n\nEntity:\n \nYELLING! \nYEEEELLLIIIING!\n\n\n(It laughs triumphantly.)\n\n\nEntity:\n You must be a warrior. I like you!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n That's great. I want to bash your fucking head in.\n\n\nEntity:\n See? Warrior! If my intuition is correct \u2014 and it never isn't not incorrect \u2014 I think the good talk-foods of Beaconridge are \nalso\n gonna make liking-you noises at you.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Stop touching my face. \nNow.\n\n\n(The Entity can be heard backing away.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Thank you.\n\n\nEntity:\n Did you just issue me an order? \u2026and then thank me for my service? \nBy the mist below!\n Do you have any idea what this means?!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n That you understand the bare minimum about personal boundaries.\n\n\nEntity:\n It means you're also a \nKING!\n\n\n(The entity's body slams against the ground, presumably in prostration.)\n\n\nEntity:\n \nSire!\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I'm leaving. Do not follow me.\n\n\n(Footsteps. The entity's voice is now in the distance.)\n\n\nEntity:\n Awaiting your next command, Melyah-King!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nI'M A FUCKING WOMAN.\n\n\nEntity:\n Forgive me, Melyah-KingWarrriorTalkFoodWoman!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Trickling water.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Finally got some distance between me and the weirdo. Sitting by a stream. Found some small fish that were pretty mundane-looking until I saw their folded-up arthropod legs. The fish don't talk \u2014 which means they can't say stupid crap about talk-food, so they're now tied with the flying frogs for my favorite animals here.\n\n\nNow that I think about it, this could part of Corbenic after all. Maybe a very distant part of it where you can't see the Moons. I say this because all the cuts and scrapes I took from fighting off that freak healed back up in less than five minutes. Save for the memories of taking the blows, I feel good as new.\n\n\nSpeaking of that guy earlier \u2014 and he seemed pretty masculine, so I'm calling him a guy until I learn otherwise \u2014 I should probably describe him while I still have some peace and quiet.\n\n\nFor starters, I got a closer look at the pants. They're not actually linen. I think they might be made from the woven fibers of an extremely soft and pliable kind of wood. I hope it chafes like hell.\n\n\nBipedal, four limbs, stood upright, thin, a human mouth\u2026But that's where the similarities to a human end.\n\n\nHe's covered in these smooth scales that are dull-golden in color. There are black circles around his eyes \u2014 not like it's from fatigue, more like two permanent black eyes. Black lips. Fangs, blue eyes with pupils like vertical slits. A nose more like a cat than that of a primate. Four-fingered hands tipped with black claws. I didn't get a good look at his feet \u2014 I think he keeps his heels hidden in his pants, always standing on his three lanky tiptoes. No nipples or bellybutton.\n\n\nAt first I thought he had this huge head of fluffy white hair \u2014 it's feathers. Long white feathers, dotted here and there with smaller red ones, sticking up half a meter from his head. Down his back. On the backs of his forearms. It smells like wildflowers.\n\n\nIn short, he looks like the eventual genetic result of a thousand generations of every animal in the world systematically fucking each others' brains out.\n\n\nOh, I almost forgot to mention the weirdest part: he's about three meters tall, at the absolute least. Whenever he spoke to me, he had to squat like a Russian teenager. He'd touch my face every now and then. It didn't feel like he was asserting dominance or anything, more like\u2026exploring? He must have been curious.\n\n\n(Sigh.)\n\n\nNow that I think about it, he didn't seem malicious at all once he found out I could talk. In his own way, he was trying to treat me like a guest. Maybe I was too hard on him.\n\n\nThen again, I'm dead, so he did meet me at a pretty stressful time of my life. I hope I get see him again so we can explain ourselves better.\n\n\nSo, until he tells me his name, I'm gonna call him\u2026 Tallboy, I guess? Reasons being: 1. He's pretty tall, and 2. I miss booze\u2026\n\n\n\u2026oh, my God, that's right. I don't know if this dimension has anything I could get drunk with.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nThat one lab report in sixth grade. We had to make wine out of grape juice from concentrate. They even let us sip a little for posterity. Everyone but me said it tasted awful.\n\n\nHow did we do it?!\n\n\nThe one time in my life I have to reverse-engineer it, and\u2026why the \nfuck\n didn't I pay attention?!\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n(The sound of a human fist hitting a tree at a high velocity.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #4\n\n\n\n\n(Aggressive splashing noises.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Heh, yeah, it's me again. Listen\u2026 remember when I said I hoped I'd get to see Tallboy again?\n\n\nEntity\n \nTallboy:\n Melyah! MELYAAAAH!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nKill\n me.\n\n\n(Even more aggressive splashing.)\n\n\nTallboy:\n \n(Unintelligible; closest approximation is \"look how many fish I can fit in my mouth!\")\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yes. Yes. You are an excellent hunter-gatherer. \nGo away.\n\n\nTallboy:\n \n(Unintelligible)\n\n\n(Splashing noises, followed by fast-approaching stomping.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n What are you doing\u2026?\n\n\n(The stomping grows closer.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n No! STOP THAT\u2014!\n\n\n(Squishing, flapping sounds. Amelia screams and chokes.)\n\n\nTallboy:\n Astounding! That's even more fish than I started out with. You'll fit right in at Beaconridge, my dear talk-food!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \n(Muffled yelling.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #5\n\n\n\n\n(A campfire crackles nearby.)\n\n\nTallboy:\n \u2026so you're telling me that your species \ndoesn't\n like being fish-throated?\n\n\n(Salas's struggles to speak for a few seconds, but her throat regenerates.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I mean, if you did that in my world, I'd choke and die.\n\n\nTallboy:\n What is \"die?\"\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Well, it's\u2014\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Hang on, \nno\n. I don't wanna deal with the philosophical implications of introducing the concept of death to a world that knows nothing about it.\n\n\nTallboy:\n \nOhhh,\n do you mean the thing the fish do when you hit them a lot?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I \u2014 yes, that's exactly what happens. Their wounds don't regenerate?\n\n\nTallboy:\n They stop moving forever, if that's what you mean. The smaller animals can't heal like we do.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n So what's your word for when a fish does that?\n\n\nTallboy:\n Dinner!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \n\u2026don't laugh \u2014 dont encourage him \u2014 stiff upper lip, Amy\u2026\n\n\nTallboy:\n Why do you smile?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nFUCKING SHIT ON A ROUNDED WHORETANGLE.\n\n\nTallboy:\n Ah, I'm sure you've got your secret Melyah-King reasons for smiling. Reminds me, though \u2014 have I told you \nmy\n name yet?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I don't think you have.\n\n\nTallboy\n \nFeck:\n I'm Feck. I don't know how to spell it, but this one guy in Beaconridge says it's \"F-E-C-K.\"\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Lemme guess, is he Irish?\n\n\nFeck:\n What is \"Irish?\"\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \n(With an Irish accent)\n Does he talk like this, boyo?\n\n\nFeck:\n \n(Tiny gasp)\n You know him!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Called it.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Not him, just where he came from before he went to, uh\u2026 what do you call this place, anyway?\n\n\nFeck:\n The part you \nwant\n to see is Beaconridge. The rest? Like here? This forest? Those mountains? The mist below the cliff?\n\n\n(He sighs sadly.)\n\n\n\u2026the name of this place is \"the reason you'll want to stay in Beaconridge.\"\n\n\n(Sounds consistent with a large man standing up from a log.)\n\n\nListen - not even a warrior-king like you would be safe out here for much longer. If I promise not to fish-throat you again, could I take you to Beaconridge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Finally found the \nreal\n name for this dimension: it's called \"Kegelapan.\"\n\nTrue to my guess, Beaconridge is Kegelapan's human settlement. It's bigger than I anticipated; I'd say between 400-600 people live here. Apparently every human who lives here fell for SCP-7702-B's little trick at one point or another, whether or not they remember it. The only exception is Lord Vee, who's just\u2026 \nalways\n been here, and he doesn't remember why. (More on Lord Vee in a moment.)\n\n\nFeck took me as far as the gate. He refused to go in. He had this look about his face that was between sad and humorous when he said he wasn't allowed in.\n\n\nI'm still not sure what exactly he was talking about, but here's what Feck told me about his standing in Beaconridge\u2026\n\n\nFeck, his twin sister Trow\n3\n, and this human king named Lord Vee have been living in Kegelapan longer than any of the other humans here \u2014 so long that their memory only goes a few decades back.\n\n\nVee rules the humans in Beaconridge, Feck guards the humans of Beaconridge from the jungle's monsters, and Trow\u2026\n\n\nTrow's the local Grinch. Feck's the only one who shows any positive emotion when he speaks of her, and even he's a little conflicted. Maybe it's because they're family?\n\n\nShe lives up high in the nearby plateaus. (Again, Grinch.) She hates the crap out of humans \u2014 especially Vee \u2014 and sends these monsters called \"Scrapes\" every now and then to carry off whatever prisoners they can.\n\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, that's also the reason that Feck can't enter the town. Vee thinks very highly of Feck, but everyone else\u2026 well, being Trow's brother carries the typical guilt-by-association bullshit. So he's been trying to fight off Trow's monsters to get back on the town's good side. He's been trying for decades now, and not making much headway. He can only live in a nasty little cave in a hill over Beaconridge, where he rests in-between guard duties.\n\n\nI really hope someone goes out there to be his friend. Maybe he's completely insufferable, but who wouldn't be after decades of being treated like him?\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026I swear to God, if I'm actually getting emotionally invested in this giant golden moron, I'm gonna pluck out my eyeballs and eat them on garlic toast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #10\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Getting settled in here in Beaconridge. Everyone speaks the same language here; my guess is that it's a perception-filter situation. Just to confirm, I spoke with this one priest dude who said he only spoke English. I asked him several questions in Spanish and Japanese, and he understood them perfectly.\n\n\nThe whole town's on the edge of a cliff over a huge chasm. No one's seen the bottom of the chasm \u2014 there's this pale green mist all over the bottom. (That's where they get the name of a town, by the way. The edge of the cliff is marked by purple-flamed torches after dark.)\n\n\nMost basic amenities (food, clothes, etc.) come from these little plants called \"serfblooms\" growing at the edges of town. The first serfbloom I dealt with was the one that grew clothes around me. Having clothes grown around you is just as much of a daily ritual here as brushing your teeth.\n\n\nThe main industry here comes in the form of the \"finders.\" Everyone either is a finder or wants to eventually become one. Finders like rappelling down the cliff and into the caves on the side. Apparently the caves are full of random treasure. And I mean \nreally\n random \u2014 it's never shit like diamonds or jewelry, but food, books from different worlds, animals, livestock, toys, clothes \u2014 sometimes it's the most mundane shit, other times it's the kind of things you'd expect to find contained at one of our facilities.\n\n\nYou'd think the caves would run out of this stuff \u2014 but no, it's a different cave with different stuff every day. Brownie points to whoever their god is for finding a way to alleviate boredom.\n\n\nThe biggest find last week was a unicorn. And not even a figurative unicorn or a statue of one, I mean an honest-to-god white unicorn. I saw it shown off the town square. \u2026poor little shit's covered in fleas.\n\n\nI'm about to meet Lord Vee for my intake. Vee's right-hand man is this buff guy with curly hair. He answers to \"The Greek.\" (His proper name must be an unlockable privilege for the local-est of locals.) The Greek doesn't say much, but ever since I brought up the Foundation, I don't think he trusts me that much\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #11\n\n\n\n\nThe Greek:\n Conduct yourself with reverence when the curtain opens. You cannot kill Lord Vee, but it is entirely possible to ruin his day, and that is equally unforgivable.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Okay, but where did I indicate that I had any interest in killing him?\n\n\nThe Greek:\n Where did I indicate that you are entitled to my trust, woman?!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nI hope you get a Lego stuck under your right eyelid and it cheese-graters your eye into a fine, gelatinous sludge over the course of twelve years.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Fair enough!\n\n\n(A curtain is drawn back.)\n\n\nThe Greek:\n Master.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n That is a nine year old Mormon boy sitting on a throw pillow.\n\n\nVee:\n That's a Dr. Amelia Salas, all right. \nWa-ooooh.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \u2026who talks like an old chain smoker on quaaludes. Yeah, why not?\n\n\nVee:\n See what I did there, that was me drawing out \"wow\" for a long time. Makes it two syllables.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah, I figured. Are you all right?\n\n\nVee:\n Pardon?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n It's just, you seem a little\u2026\n\n\nThe Greek:\n She has disrespected you, sire. Shall I throw her off the cliff?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nShit.\n\n\n(Vee suddenly breaks into sleepy fits of giggling.)\n\n\nVee:\n Noooooo! No no no nooo! Don't do her a throw off the cliff! You're so \nsilly.\n See, Dr. Salas, I'm feeling a little loopy because I'm in the middle of some very intense meditation.\n\n\n(Vee slaps a hand repeatedly against something.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Just noticed this now. His right hand is bulky. It's covered by an ornately woven silk handkerchief of some sort.\n\n\nVee:\n I'm an Esto practicioner. Esto is the art of attaining true happiness. My forefathers perfected it over many ages. I'm one of the last people alive who can teach it. I'm teaching the Greek right now. Aren't I?\n\n\n(The Greek chuckles through his nose haughtily.)\n\n\nThe Greek:\n There is no purer satisfaction. But I have only scraped the surface as of yet. Even a man like the Buddha could only dream of what Lord Vee has achieved.\n\n\nVee:\n So don't mind me if I seem a little silly. How about you, Dr. Salas? What brings you here?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I mean, if you know my name, you probably know how I got here.\n\n\nVee:\n Sure! But I wanna hear \nyour\n answer.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Okay, well\u2026\n\n\n(Salas explains the story so far.)\n\n\nVee:\n WA-oooh.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah.\n\n\nVee:\n \u2026to clarify, that was me taking \"wow\" and\u2014\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Y-yeah, you don't have to tell me that again.\n\n\nVee:\n Well, usually when people get this far in Beaconridge, they wanna learn how to be a finder. Who knows what you'll find in the caves? You could even find your way back home.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I would rather shit into my open mouth than go back to being the Foundation's traumatic memory pincushion.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I hope I find something else.\n\n\nVee:\n \n(Laughing)\n Don't shit into your open mouth! That's silly!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \u2026can this little fucker read my thoughts?\n\n\nVee:\n Your thoughts are \nsilly.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I did \nnot\n mean to call you that.\n\n\nVee:\n Well, I can see your thoughts. I can see what you want.\n\n\nYou've seen a universe that's unsalvageably chaotic. You've been forced to compromise every value that separates you from monsters in the name of job safety.\n\n\nWhen you started working for the Foundation, you wanted to use the power of science to save the world. You spent your tenure at Site-59 being told, over and over, that there's nothing to save but the status quo. So what do you want?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I want it to stop.\n\n\nVee:\n You want a fight you can win. Something you can save without complications.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I \nwant\n it to \nstop.\n\n\nVee:\n But what's \"it\"?\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Fighting a losing battle.\n\n\n(Vee giggles again.)\n\n\nVee:\n I talked to Mr. Feck. He says you're a warrior.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n He only called me that because he heard me yell a few times. By that logic, he'd probably think a trombone is a warrior.\n\n\n(The sound of metal being drawn against metal is heard.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Vee just pulled a sword out of thin air. A European hand-and-a-half longsword, by the looks of it.\n\n\nVee:\n This was found in the cave last month. Wes was the finder, so it belonged to him.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n And where's Wes?\n\n\nVee:\n The Scrapes took him away.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nIt belongs to \nyou\n now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Fires crackle. A church bell rings. Some people are yelling indistinct evacuation orders.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I finally got a look at one of those \"Scrape\" things. Imagine a sea urchin, but every spine is the blade of an old, rusty pair of scissors with a poisoned tip. The spines can bend enough that they can be walked on like a hundred disorganized pairs of legs.\n\n\nEach Scrape's about the size of one of a U-Haul truck. They carry their victims away by impaling them on the tips of their spines like decorations. And worst of all\u2026\n\n\n(A high-pitched chirping noise accompanies the scraping of metal on cobblestones.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \u2026their voices are so fucking \ncute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #16\n\n\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \u2026but you have a goddamn \npitchfork.\n There's a bulbous wad of flesh in the middle of each and every one of them. How many arteries could you sever at once with a single thrust?\n\n\nFarmer:\n They're invincible.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nYou literally just said that their wounds don't regenerate fifty-three seconds ago.\n\n\nAnother Farmer:\n Leave him alone! His son was taken by the Scrapes.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Then let's avenge him!\n\n\nFarmer:\n My son said the same things you do.\n\n\nMerchant:\n So what if they can die? Lord Vee said that fighting a Scrape is forbidden to everyone but Feck.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nSo, what, is this what fucking happens when everyone in a town full of puppets asks the Blue Fairy to turn them into a real BITCH?!\n\n\nPriest:\n Your need inner peace. Have you tried the Way of Esto?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #17\n\n\n\n\n(The church bells sound more quickly. Scrapes can be heard chirping in a dissonant chorus. Every so often, one screams a little shriller, followed by the clattering of steel on the ground.)\n\n\n(Feck laughs though his warbling war-cry.)\n\n\nFeck:\n WAR-FOOD!\n\n\n(Flesh tears from flesh. Feck gargles liquid that pours into his mouth.)\n\n\n(Running footsteps. The gargling draws closer.)\n\n\nFeck:\n Melyah?!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yo.\n\n\nFeck:\n It's nice to see you, but the not-getting-hurt direction is the other way.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n That's great. I have a sword and I need an outlet for my anger issues.\n\n\nFeck:\n What is \"outlet?\"\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Fuck you.\n\n\nFeck:\n You're still running in the get-stabbed-a-lot direction. Curious as to why.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Don't care. Wounds regenerate. Gonna fight the Scrapes.\n\n\nFeck:\n But can you \nuse\n the war-hurt-thing?\n\n\n(Wet, squelching noise. Feck vocalizes in brief, extreme pain.)\n\n\nFeck:\n I see. Very good!\n\n\n(More Scrape vocalizations. The noise converges on Salas.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \u2026am I supposed to not be feeling this much pain? Did my nervous system just \nquit?!\n\n\n(Wet stabbing noises. She shrieks.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nMommy, I would like to go home now.\n\n\n(A series of brief, rapid chirping. It sounds vaguely like laughter.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nStop JUDGING ME!\n\n\n(Stab. A Scrape cries out in extreme pain.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Oh my sweet merciful shit, that actually worked.\n\n\n(The Scrapes chirp nervously.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n It just fell apart with one thrust. Is that normal? I mean, Feck's been ripping them apart by the blades, but\u2026\n\n\n(Feck chuckles.)\n\n\nFeck:\n They're \nscared,\n Melyah. I've destroyed many. But they've never seen \nyour\n kind do it.\n\n\n(The Scrapes' movements fade into the distance.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I don't know what to say. When's the last time I felt like this? It's\u2026 nice.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Hey, Feck?\n\n\nFeck:\n HA! Forgetting my name is an enemy in itself, and you have destroyed \nthat\n as well!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Can we, I dunno, do this again sometime?\n\n\nFeck:\n The war-food comes \nalways.\n If you enjoy their coming, you'd be one of two people with that opinion.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n And who's the other person?\n\n\nFeck:\n The one who's about to throw you into the air in triumph.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Wait, wha\u2014\n\n\n(Sounds of a brief struggle.)\n\n\nFeck:\n VICTORY THROW! THE SKY KISSES YOUR FACE!\n\n\n(His voice fades into the distance.)\n\n\nFeck:\n WAIT, IS THIS ALSO A THING YOU DON'T LIKE?\n\n\n(Splat.)\n\n\nFeck:\n Ohhh\u2026 just a minor criticism: the ground is not a good place to put your viscera.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nWhy aren't you guys answering the fucking phone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #18\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Took me a whole year, but I finally found someone else who was with the Foundation in Beaconridge. Her name's Dr. Rodina Nicolescu. She used to be with Site-19. Maybe her name will pop up in your records somewhere.\n\n\nDr. Nicolescu worked with temporal anomalies for the most part. Through talking with her, I went over the problems I've been having with your chronic failure to answer the phone when I call. And as much as this solution sickens me, it seems to make the most sense.\n\n\nShe thinks there's some kind of time-dilation effect in this dimension. One second would pass in your world, but here, it would take\u2026 weeks? Months? Maybe years? Either way, sorry for nagging you guys so much. Even if you could pick up the phone at this point, it would probably sound like \n(makes some quick, high-pitched \"chipmunk\" noises)\n or something.\n\n\nAnyway, it's been about a year (our time) since my last transmission.\n\n\nVee was impressed with how I handled my first Scrape. He still doesn't think the other humans should fight them \u2014 keeps saying they're \"not ready\" \u2014 but he appointed me the co-protector of the city, along with Feck.\n\n\nI've been learning more about these Scrape things. The poison on the tips of their blades isn't actually poison - it's a crude anesthetic. If I didn't know better, I'd say these Scrapes aren't here to kill anyone.\n\n\n(chuckles)\n\n\nSorry, I just realized how stupid that sounds. No human dies here. But they're not here to torture, either \u2014 just to terrify and subdue. I guess Trow has something resembling a conscience, or at least a moral compass.\n\n\nBut even if she does, no one's seen hide or hair of her for years, and no one knows her motivation other than \"fuck off, humans.\" For all we know, she could be gone, leaving an educated Scrape in charge.\n\n\nI'm having more fun than I did at Site-59, no doubt. I'd be lying if I said this was all fun and games, but at least I'll never have to see [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED], or take part in [REDACTED] again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #73\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalas (V):\n The fuck are you on about?!\n\nWallace\n4\n:\n I \nsaid,\n your barter's no good here.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I got that part. What I need is an explanation.\n\n\nWallace:\n Need it, then.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \u2026so, am I \nstealing\n the beer I was asking for \u2014\n\n\nWallace:\n Leave before I call the Greek over.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Adorable. You really think he's gonna risk losing more people to Scrapes by throwing half the security force off the cliff?\n\n\nWallace:\n What, are we supposed to trust you, now? After all you've done to enable Feck? He's been waiting for his chance to let all the Scrapes in through the back door for his sister, and here you are, thinking, \"Wow. That's a real stand-up sorta guy. I'd better help him.\"\n\n\n(A small bottle uncorks.)\n\n\nWallace:\n What are you doing? \u2026is that paint? Is this your idea of vandalism?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Scrape mating pheromones. Your booth's about to meet the love of its life.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n (Actually, it's berry juice.)\n\n\n(Wallace shuffles through supplies, trying to find something to wipe it off.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \n(Chortling)\n Oh, it doesn't wipe off. It just spreads.\n\n\nWallace:\n What's the point of this? Petty revenge?! Well, \nmission accomplished.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n The point is \nhand over all your beer. Now.\n\n\nWallace:\n Why?!

Vee tried to vouch for me, but Wallace's drinking buddies make up the entire justice council. So until I come back into the townspeople's good graces, I have to live in this stupid cave with \u2014\n\n\nFeck:\n Melyah! Look! Look!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n One sec.\n\n\nFeck:\n I made you a teller-vision for your sleep-room! You can watch all your story-shows on it.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Feck's showing me this slab of wood. He drew a picture of a frowny face on it with berry juice.\n\n\nFeck:\n You like drama-story-shows, right? This is called \"The man who is always sad.\" Try as he might, his expression never changes \u2014 SCRAPES!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Where?!\n\n\nFeck:\n Behind you! Quickly!\n\n\n(Her sword clatters in her hands.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Come out, motherfuckers, I'll \u2014 where are they?\n\n\n(Feck snickers.)\n\n\n(Salas sighs.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Okay, what did you do?\n\n\nFeck:\n Look at the teller-vision again.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n He just drew angry eyebrows on the frowny face.\n\n\nFeck:\n PLOT TWIST!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #239\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Hey, remember the Greek? Dude's warmed up to me a little. But I'm starting to think that being on his good side is a little worse than being on his bad side.\n\n\nHe told me the most fucked-up story yesterday. I ended up writing down most of what I could. Some of it was from memory.\n\n\nI think it gave me some insight into this \"Esto\" religion that keeps making the rounds. Now I'm positive that it's something I wanna stay as far away from as possible.\n\n\nLemme see if I can pull it up \u2014 oh, hey, forgot my handwriting's basically \"monkey taking a piss in the shape of the alphabet\" tier. This might take a while.\n\n\n\n\nBefore I came here, my name was Xanthias. I was a slave from the first time I opened my eyes to the last time I closed them on Earth.\n\n\nMy one living relative was an older brother named Medon \u2014 he was also a slave. I cherished him more than anything else. His were the unwavering arms that sheltered me from our cruelest masters.\n\n\nI was born in Athens. It was never a good life \u2014 Medon and I were passed around from master to master, praying to Athena that this one would be a little kinder.\n\n\nBut once the Persians took the city, I began to yearn for the past, when life was merely intolerable rather than excruciating. King Dareios and his demons blamed all Athenians equally for some nonsense in Ionia. The stench of corpses choked the air of every street.\n\n\nWe were handed off to one of Dareios's close associates, a general who lived in Ecbatana. The general gave me the title of cupbearer. He never once asked me to bear a cup. \"Cupbearer\" must have been a euphemism for everything else he did to me.\n\n\nAs my torments grew daily, so did Medon's desire for revenge. One night, when the general had too much to drink, Medon smothered both him and his wife as they lay in their beds. And since they were the general's guests at the time, Medon turned his blade on King Dareios. Had he drawn the knife an instant sooner, you would have known Medon today as the man who slew Darius the Great.\n\n\nMedon was sentenced unto the boats. Have you heard of it? \u2026before I describe it to you, have you eaten recently?\n\n\nThe boats were the Persians' specialty. Medon was clasped in a coffin of two boats facing one another. His hands, feet, and head were exposed. Torturers forced milk and honey down his throat. Bathed him in it. Medon and his prison were left in a pond to decay in the open sunlight. Every so often the Persians would come to feed him once more.\n\n\nI fled my new master and searched throughout the countryside for Medon. For two weeks, I was unsuccessful. But on the fifteenth day, when I found him, every manner of verminous pest had been summoned by two weeks of vomit and excrement.\n\n\nHe was being devoured from within.\n\n\nAnd he was smiling.\n\n\nOnce I had finished weeping, I leaned down to break his neck.\n\n\nBut my brother spoke, and a mouthful of biting flies slurred his speech.\n\n\n\"No, Xanthias. The darkest and coldest house in Hades is reserved for he who kills his own brother out of jealousy.\"\n\n\n\"Jealousy?\" said I.\n\n\n\"Is it so unusual that you would be jealous? Thousands upon thousands of new and curious children are born from my flesh. Life has begun upon my soil, and I have become a world.\n\n\nThe instant I ceased my resistance, Prince VUUOU\n5\n \nanointed me in my waking dreams. My agony cleansed me of all worldly and temporary joys. Only the secret immortal light remained, the one that shines the brightest in adversity.\n\n\nAnd when that light was no longer smothered by mundane comfort\u2026 I became the king who rules myself. By my divine right, I abolished everything but truth and beauty from my kingdom. Fiakh Duhazh Esto. Fiakh Duhazh Esto! FIAKH DUHAZH ESTO!\"\n\n\nBy then, I had broken his neck. His last breath was spent on a squeal of joy, as if he were in the arms of a vicious lover twice his size.\n\n\nHis broken body burned itself into my mind as an ashen silhouette. It was not even my fear that overcame me - I was mystified by how anyone could find such happiness in the worst tortures imaginable.\n\n\nI had no want of his fate.\n\n\nBut I \nneeded\n the peace he had found.\n\n\nFor years, I was in the thrall of that singular image worse than I had ever been in the thrall of a slaver. I thought I was going mad. Seeking anything to take my mind off that moment, I wandered aimlessly toward the east, stealing meals from towns I'd never visit again, scraping by as a vagrant.\n\n\nMy madness only ended the day I died, alone and naked, in the stable of someone else's diseased horse.\n\n\nBecause when I closed my eyes for the last time\u2026 I opened them to see VUUOU, smiling down upon me.\n\n\nHe asked of me, \"Did it hurt when you died?\"\n\n\nI nodded.\n\n\n\"Did the littlest creatures of the stables feast upon you?\"\n\n\nI nodded.\n\n\n\"And how did it feel?\"\n\n\nI replied: \"I still do not understand.\"\n\n\n\"You \nwill\n, Xanthias. The longer the adversity, the more beauty is forged within\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #432\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I think I have a serious problem.\n\nI should preface this with Feck's new side gig. He's always wanted to go on those little \"finder\" missions for treasure.\n\n\nBut there used to be this Catch-22 about it: on one hand, the humans get \nreally\n pissed if Feck joins them during daylight hours. (Y'know, because they're morons.) On the other, he could go down and do it properly at night \u2014 but nighttime's when the Scrapes attack. So up until a few months ago, Feck's been confined topside.\n\n\nBut one night, Feck remarked that I've grown strong enough to hypothetically handle a Scrape attack on my own.\n\n\nSo I told myself, \"y'know what? This guy's been working his ass off to protect people who won't even give him the time of day. He deserves a day off.\" I offered to let Feck go down the cliff for one night a week while I handled the spiky boys.\n\n\nThat made Feck so happy that he\u2026 punched himself in the head a few times? (Good to know he can still be confusing as hell.)\n\n\nSo the little deal we had going on worked without a hitch for a few weeks. I was worried I'd get in over my head, but the little pit and net traps I've set up for the Scrapes seemed to be doing the trick.\n\n\nBut here's where my aforementioned problem comes into play\u2026\n\n\nYesterday was Feck's day off again. When he came back, he brought a few cases of Modelo with him. (Apparently the treasures in the caves comes from the residents' subconscious being given form.) But he came back five hours late.\n\n\nBecause when I saw him rappel down as usual, his rope snapped.\n\n\n(Sigh.)\n\n\nI mean, obviously he's okay \nnow\n, he climbed back up. He made it out like he always does. And he's immortal like I am!\n\n\nBut I saw him go flailing into the mist.\n\n\nI must have stared after him for an hour. I left when the Scrapes started coming.\n\n\nIf anything, the intense emotions I was feeling at the time helped with fighting them off. Put a little extra fuel in each thrust.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nThis is so fucking embarrassing.\n\n\nBarring the collective free space of my infancy, I have cried a total of six times in my life.\n\n\nThe first was when my goldfish died, two through four was when my dogs died, the fifth was after my turn with Procedure 110-Montauk.\n\n\nThe sixth was for this stupid-ass dinosaur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #583\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVee:\n Dr. Saaaa.\n\nSalas (V):\n We came as soon as we could. What's going on \u2014\n\n\nVee:\n Laaaaas.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nPlease\n let this conversation take less than five minutes.\n\n\nFeck:\n Is this about the having-a-lot-of and being-all-over-the-place that the Scrapes have been doing of late?\n\n\nVee:\n How very astute!\n\n\nFeck:\n Teehee. \nAss toot.\n\n\n(Salas stifles a giggle.)\n\n\nThe Greek:\n Feck, for the love of\u2014\n\n\nVee:\n Feck may speak as he sees fit. But yes, this does regard the Scrapes. I'm not so much concerned with the number of Scrapes as with the number of my fellow humans going missing.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah, about that \u2014 this isn't sustainable. Ten people were carried off in the last week alone.\n\n\nFeck:\n Melyah, we're doing the best we can\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Exactly! We've been busting our asses and it's only gotten worse. There's only one solution: we \nneed\n more people on the defensive.\n\n\n(Vee sighs.)\n\n\nVee:\n You're right\u2026 you're very right. In a perfect world, I'd have everyone pulling their weight.\n\n\nBut do you know why I made the taboo against fighting the Scrapes in the first place? Because you and Feck are the only people who know how to fight them effectively.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Who says we can't train some new people?\n\n\nVee:\n And who says they'll listen? It's a shame that their distrust runs so deep, but that's the human experience in a nutshell.\n\n\nBut I didn't come here just to tell you it's hopeless. I've come into some new information. Something that could make Scrape attacks a distant memory.\n\n\nFeck:\n You found Trow?!\n\n\nVee:\n Yes.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Great, so when do we gank her?\n\n\nFeck:\n NO!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nOh, right, they're a dysfunctional family.\n\n\nFeck:\n Trow is \nnot\n a bad person-thing. Trow is\u2026 \nconfused\n. The Scrapes must have mind-changed-around her. Turned her into Fake-Trow. \nReal\n-Trow is kind. Sweet. And almost as pretty as Melyah!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \nNever call me that again.\n\n\nFeck:\n I refuse to say lie-words!\n\n\nThe Greek:\n Your sister is a murderer.\n\n\nFeck:\n Your mouth is a shit-craftsman.\n\n\nVee:\n Guys, guys\u2026 I'm not telling you to kill her. Whatever we think of Trow, she's just as immortal as any of us.\n\n\nBut Feck has a point. Trow is not acting on her own free will. Keep this on the down-low, but I've heard whispers among the frogs and the weasel-mice of the valley.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Because of fucking course he has.\n\n\nVee:\n And they've said that the reason for Trow's hatred of mankind is something in her possession called the Plate of Remembrance.\n\n\nIf you take that Plate of Remembrance away from her, then not only will your sister come to her senses, Feck, but the attacks will stop, and the people of Beaconridge will see how wrong they've been about you.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n That sounds like a good idea. Right, Feck?\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nFeck:\n I don't care what the talk-foods think of me. So long as they're being happy with the other talk-foods, Feck is happy. But the other goal-stuff sounds nice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #584\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n It was three-day-long shitshow getting up the Stairs Made of Cliffs - it's literally called that on this map of Kegalapan, by the way - but I'm just about to crawl over the last cliff.\n\n\nFeck's handling the Scrape attacks back home. (I can't believe I just called it \"home\" just now.) Only a few Scrapes saw me on the way up, and I took care of them pretty quickly.\n\n\nWhat really concerns me is the potential nest of Scrapes I'm about to enter.\n\n\nWell, just gonna peek my head over for posterity, and \u2014\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nWhat in the hickory-dickory-\ndick\n am I looking at?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #585\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I'm at the edge of Kegalapan. I don't mean a border - it's the literal goddamn edge of the world.\n\n\nBehind me, there's a horizon, a cloud layer, and a distant path to the mist below. In front of me, there's\u2026\n\n\nNothing.\n Empty white space. It's too bright to look at sometimes. The ground ends in jagged, triangular cut-outs. If I look closely, the cut-outs correspond to the same shape that makes the Scrapes' blades. Is this how the Scrapes are made? Are they constructed from these shards of empty space being painted and sharpened to a point?\n\n\nThe only thing beyond the edge is this crooked path leading to a hill where these spatial-fragments have been piled up on top of one another. Like a heap of scrap paper.\n\n\nThere's big hole in the top of the pile from the walkway.\n\n\nNowhere to go but in\u2026\n\n\n\"Childe Roland to the dark tower came.\"\n\n\n\u2026oh, fuck off, that's the one cool thing I remember from AP English Lit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #586\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Cacophonous chirping and cutting noises.

It was like I'd just found the Ark of the Covenant. But he wouldn't elaborate on why the plate was important, he just said some crap like \"this is \nbig\n, and when something's big, we've got to get people discussing it.\"\n\n\nHe got everyone Beaconridge together for a huge meeting in the square. Feck was there too - we had front-row seats to Vee's speech. There was some jeering when people saw Feck in the city borders, but it subsided once Vee gave a single order to knock it off. (It makes me wonder how much of this bullshit Feck has to deal with can be directly attributed to Vee only helping him when it's convenient.)\n\n\nHe read the contents of the tablet like it was storytime at kindergarten. He was making extra sure that Feck didn't take a look at the hieroglyphs \u2014 he didn't \nsay\n it was a cognitohazard to Feck and/or Trow, but he more or less implied it.\n\n\nI still don't understand the finer details, but apparently Kegelapan was formed by some kind of immortal creature named \"Trowfeck\" having a dream. There's some kind of horrible parasite controlling the dream. Also, Feck and Trow are manifestations of two of Trowfeck's brains, and\u2026\n\n\nLook, controlling the bullshit threshold of what I'm dealing with is above my pay grade.\n\n\nWhether or not the story's true, there's been three changes going on steadily ever since.\n\n\n\n\nThe Scrape attacks \u2014 growing fewer and far between. I'm starting to think maybe Trow's about to finally throw in the Towel. (Trowel?)\n\n\nThe people of Beaconridge \u2014 person-to-person conflict has been increasing. The story told from the tablet has put the whole town into two factions. It used to be just a few peaceful demonstrations here and there, but now you can't go on day without a full-on brawl breaking out between the Sleepers and the Wakers. And anyone who isn't aligned to either side is hounded day and night by both sides until they pick one.\n\n\n\nOne side \u2014 the \"Wakers\" \u2014 is led by Dr. Nicolescu. Some of them are afraid of the Parasite manipulating and enslaving them. Others think they have a moral and ethical obligation to help Trowfeck out. Either way, they want to wake up Trowfeck from its slumber.\n\n\nThe other side \u2014 the \"Sleepers\" \u2014 is led by Wallace the grocer. They insist that if Trowfeck is awoken, that'll mean either everyone dies or their comfortable way of life will be compromised. The Sleepers have the majority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n\n\n\nFeck's been growing uneasier by the day. He hardly makes that adorable war howl he used to make, even when he's fighting. I keep trying to get him to tell me what's wrong, but\u2026 I don't think \nhe\n knows, either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,084\n\n\n\n\n(A riot is heard outside from within in a small hut. The Greek can be heard yelling appeals to restore order.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n This better be important, Vee. I had to wade through half of the shopping district trying to stab me.\n\n\nVee:\n Wa-ooh. Stabbings. Did you repay the favor?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Do you know me?\n\n\nVee:\n Your energy is intoxicating, my friend.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n So's the thing I could be cracking open instead of talking to you. Say your piece and leave me alone.\n\n\nVee:\n As you wish. Feck is missing.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n What?!\n\n\nVee:\n He broke into my hut, grabbed the Plate of Remembrance, stared at it for under an hour \u2014 and by the time I woke up to see him, he stole away with the plate toward the Southern horizon with mortal terror in his eyes.\n\n\n\u2026in fact, I dare say it's the same terror I see in your eyes now\u2014\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Don't patronize me. My Feck's in danger.\n\n\nVee:\n \nYour\n Feck? Is there more than one?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nJUST KILL ME NOW\n\n\nVee:\n There is a great disturbance in your soul. You wish to scramble off after him haphazardly with little chance of success.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n That's the idea, yeah.\n\n\nVee:\n If I could offer an alternative\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Make it quick.\n\n\nVee:\n A brief Esto exercise, to clear your mind.\n\n\nI know your aversion to Esto. But there's a way to dip your feet into the waters, enough to clear your head, then to leave without completely submerging.\n\n\nSit close\u2026\n\n\n(The sound of Salas sitting cross-legged on a pillow on the floor.)\n\n\nEsto is the art of radically allowing yourself to exist. The closest thing you humans have is meditation. But that only skims the surface of what it means to accept existence.\n\n\nClose your eyes, Dr. Salas.\n\n\nYou must take everything the world around you has to offer as a gift. Thank the world for each and every one, no matter how it feels. All misfortune is rooted in resistance to these gifts.\n\n\nInhale. Feel the air enter your lungs.\n\n\nHold your breath. Feel it remain in your lungs.\n\n\nExhale. Feel it leave your lungs.\n\n\n\u2026You've got that much down, at least.\n\n\nNow, let's try something different. Something with more questions. Answer them only with your mind.\n\n\nInhale. Feel it slither down your throat like prying fingers. How does it taste on every ridge and curve of your windpipe?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n The fuck?\n\n\nVee:\n Concentrate!\n\n\nHold your breath. Feel it churn. Feel the air beg petulantly to go back home. How much does it sting your clenching chest to keep it contained?\n\n\nExhale. Feel its fingernails scrape the lining of your windpipe.\n\n\nOpen your eyes.\n\n\n(Fabric shifts)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n He's\u2026 taking off the silk over his right hand. He's had his hand stuck in a mason jar full of cloudy water the whole time. I don't know what to say.\n\n\nVee:\n Then say nothing.\n\n\nI don't remember how long ago I put my hand in this jar. In years, I'd put it in multiples of a hundred.\n\n\nThis water was once crystal clear. Now, who can say what it's become? I dissolve a little more every day. The water seeps into my skin and takes whatever little particles it desires. It's a snowglobe of flesh. Because through the unending pain and disgust, every irrelevant thought falls away. Only the most immortal positivity survives.\n\n\nComfort is just another addiction. That's what is really trying to enslave you.\n\n\nIn order to truly be free, you must allow yourself to exist.\n\n\nYou must allow yourself to \nrot.\n\n\n(Rapid footsteps.)\n\n\nWhere are you going, Dr. Salas? I was just getting to the best part\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,085\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nFUCK\n THIS TOWN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,410\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I lost count of the days I've been out here. It's a godsend that Feck has such pointy and distinguishable feet. He left miles upon miles of tracks in the dirt. You'd think it was a cartoon. But three little spiky toes leaving triangular spots in the dirt has taken me this far.\n\n\nAnd if I don't find him? Maybe there's another town somewhere in Kegelapan. Somewhere where the smartest human isn't a cult leader trying to make moonshine out of his own skin.\n\n\nSpeaking of Vee, this sword that he gave me was wonderful against the Scrapes, but it's dog shit against everything else. I saw some new animals in the southward trek. Particularly some five-legged reptilian antelopes. I figured they looked the tastiest.\n\n\nThe sword cuts like butter. Clarification: it cuts like it's a stick of butter. Even with all my kendo training, it's little more than a very thin club.\n\n\nI killed exactly one lizard-antelope with this stupid thing. Turns out they taste like waxy ashes. At least this crooked horn I got cuts better, so I ended up throwing the sword in a stream.\n\n\nI'm convinced that Vee gave me a sword that the Scrapes are allergic to on purpose. If he did that, he could have given \neveryone\n a sword like this, and the whole \"we're the only ones who can fight\" business was bullshit.\n\n\nHow much has Vee been manipulating us? And why?\n\n\nHe's been around here since \"the dream\" started.\n\n\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd say Vee's this \"Parasite\" the tablet was talking about\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,509\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeck:\n Go away.\n\nSalas (V):\n I just wanna talk!\n\n\nFeck:\n Go \naway!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n \u2026no.\n\n\n(Feck runs up to Salas. The next 21 seconds are hard to differentiate over the voicemail recording; it's too loud, resulting in heavy static and feedback.)\n\n\n(Brief pause.)\n\n\n(Feck sits on the ground, laughing sadly.)\n\n\nFeck:\n Still a warrior. You didn't even flinch.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Why did you leave?\n\n\n(Feck grumbles.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Was it something I did?\n\n\n(He grumbles louder, but with a twinge of melancholy.)\n\n\nFeck:\n Is that what I made you believe? The talk-food mind makes such lie-noises when it's starving for information. It's not your fault at all, Melyah. You're the only talk-food I miss from that stupid gather-place.\n\n\n(The ruffling of smooth metal against feathers is heard.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n The Plate\u2026\n\n\nFeck:\n You heard the stay-words that were put here, right?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah. I was there with you when it was being read. \u2026that's really what it says, right? Vee wasn't bullshitting us, was he?\n\n\nFeck:\n Mm. That's what it says in talk-food words, and every word is true. But this is written in Feck-and-Trow letters. When my kind sees these letters, we're forced to remember.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Remember what?\n\n\n(Ten seconds of loaded silence.)\n\n\nFeck:\n Listen, Melyah. You can stay out here with me for a while. If you like.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n I don't think I'd mind that\u2014\n\n\nFeck:\n BUT! Only if you listen to my truth-story.\n\n\n(Something wooden and metal clatters against the dirt.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \u2026did he just pull a whole-ass German zweih\u00e4nder out of his feather mane?\n\n\nFeck:\n That was one of my finder treasures. I tried to hide it from you. It was gonna be\u2026 for your birthday.\n\n\n(Thumping sound analogous with Salas's pulse sounding in her ears.)\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nFUCKING \nSTOP\n THAT I AM A WOMAN OF SCIENCE THIS IS \nPLATONIC\n\n\nFeck:\n Guess it'll be more useful this way. If my intuition is correct \u2014 and it's never not \u2014 you're gonna get really hate-anger at me when I finish my story. You'll probably wanna use it on me to stand-still-hunt a lot.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Okay, Feck? Usually I can understand your hyphenations, but\u2026\n\n\nFeck:\n Stand-still-hunt is when I stand still and you do hurt-things to my flesh.\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Bruh\u2026\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Okay. Well, if you're ready for me to prove you extremely wrong, tell me your story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,510\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A crackling campfire.)\n\n\nFeck:\n To begin with, Vee is\u2026 it's short for \"Prince VUUOU of the Murk.\" You may have heard Trow or the Greek talking about him.\n\n\nVUUOU is the \"Parasite.\" A long time ago, VUUOU lived in this place called Corbenic. He was a god \u2014 the weakest and tiniest god of his seven brothers.\n\n\nBeing weak on its own isn't a bad thing - if food weren't weak, we wouldn't have anything to eat. But VUUOU's only strength stemmed from cruelty.\n\n\nAnd he didn't even need to be cruel for the sake of his job, like some of the other Princes. He didn't have any patronage over despair or impurity - he was the god of rivers, trees, and cloudy days, completely inoffensive things like that. He was just mean all on his own.\n\n\nHis corner of Corbenic looked just like Kegelapan. It was even \ncalled\n Kegelapan. But Old Kegelapan was bigger - there were way more cities than just Beaconridge.\n\n\nOld Kegelapan was a very bad place to live. Every talk-food that lived there was kidnapped from some other part of Corbenic. VUUOU's agents would spread rumors among the talk-foods to start up civil unrest. And when all the tension and fighting came to a head\u2026\n\n\nThat's when the Murk would overflow, where it would flood Old Kegelapan for a few ages \u2014 until VUUOU got bored started over again.\n\n\nNow, about the Murk\u2026 that's the stuff in the lake at the bottom of the cliff. Greenish-brown-black liquid. It's the kind of poison even gods stay away from. One drop of Murk lands on your skin, and everything happens to that patch of skin at once. Mushrooms and plants grow from you. You age a million years and regress into a glob of primordial sludge at the same time. New species of animals are born from you. You feel it all in excruciating detail.\n\n\nVUUOU lived deep in the Murk. He loved the way it made him feel bad.\n\n\nThis was all part of VUUOU's think-style. \"Esto.\" It's all rooted in the idea that if a talk-food feels nothing but horrible forever, then sooner or later, they'll start feeling nothing but \ngood\n forever. VUUOU thought his cycle of tortures made the talk-foods happier and smarter.\n\n\n\u2026I don't get it either.\n\n\nWhen VUUOU came into control of the dream and made this \nNew\n Kegelapan, he did the same thing.\n\n\nEveryone lives in the illusion of safety for a while. Once someone takes the Plate of Remembrance from Trow, everything starts spiraling out of control. Just when the talk-foods least suspect, the Murk overflows and turns Kegelapan into a lake\u2026\n\n\nThen Trowfeck wakes up.\n\n\nBut VUUOU's got his string-hands wrapped Trowfeck's head-guts. He can make Trowfeck go back to sleep.\n\n\nAnd when he does, the talk-foods start over, forget everything that's ever happened, and it all starts up again. I forget too. Only VUUOU and my sister remember.\n\n\nI do not know how many times this cycle has repeated itself. But VUUOU will keep doing this forever until he's satisfied. He'll never be satisfied. This isn't his Old Kegelapan, and it never will be - but VUUOU will forever think he's just one more cycle away from seeing his old kingdom again.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n And what about you?\n\n\nFeck:\n Huh?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Where's this part where you're so horrible that I'm going to have to fight you about it?\n\n\n(20 seconds of silence. Feck sighs heavily.)\n\n\nFeck:\n VUUOU can only do so much on his own. He's got one string-hand wrapped around \nme\n, too. And when the talk-foods start to catch on to his plans and try to fight back\u2026\n\n\nThat's when the instincts I hate-anger so much kick in.\n\n\nI'm VUUOU's reluctant enforcer.\n\n\nThe poor talk-foods \u2014 I've killed and smashed and squished and tore and bled them more times than I can count. Sometimes I tore the limbs off the talk-foods and put them back on in the wrong places, regenerating them into pain-statues. Ate them. Gargled their juices.\n\n\nI know I'm not the one in control, but I feel like there's something else I could do-think to make sure it never happens again. And I hate myself when I start to love-feel the pain-noises they make.\n\n\nAnd worst of all?\n\n\nThe Murk can't flow over the cliffs without me crying out to give it permission.\n\n\n(After a brief pause, Feck's knees land on the grass gently.)\n\n\nFeck:\n \u2026ready when you are.\n\n\n(Salas makes no audio indication of picking up a sword.)\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Relatable.\n\n\nFeck:\n What is \"relatable?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk Transmission #1,511\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalas (V):\n [REDACTED]\n\nFeck:\n You tried to get them to stop, right?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n [REDACTED]\n\n\nFeck:\n So what happened to [REDACTED]?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n [REDACTED]\n\n\nFeck:\n \u2026by MUZD and His Black Hammer.\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah.

SCP-7702-B is contained in a lead-lined metal canister in a standard containment locker at Site-59.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7702 refers to two organisms contained in the aftermath of SCP-7702-Black. Both specimens are functionally immortal and do not require food or water.\n\n\nSCP-7702-A is a massive\n12\n bipedal organism with both reptilian and avian features. Any damage inflicted upon SCP-7702-A completely regenerates within a period of five minutes.\n\n\nSCP-7702-A is in a permanent state of REM sleep. According to intelligence provided by the Three Moons Initiative, this is irreversible.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B is a tumor-like mass composed of 20\u00a0kg of black, waxy flesh. DNA samples extracted from SCP-7702-B have no match with any mundane organism. The only organs visible on the entity are a beaked mouth, three compound eyes, and 42 threadlike pseudopods.\n\n\nSCP-7702-B is extremely hostile. Seventeen hours of uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with a living host can result in SCP-7702-B overriding the host's consciousness. However, SCP-7702-B has no other anomalous capabilities, moves at a maximum speed of 0.3 meters per hour, and has a maximum bite strength of 0.4\u00a0kg.\n\n\n\n\nMemorandum on SCP-7702-B from the Ethics Committee\n\n\nSCP-7702-B's containment measures are still under development.\n\n\nThe Ethics Committee hasn't come to this much of an impasse in years. While permanent solitary confinement in a cramped metal canister would be abject cruelty for any other sentient anomaly, 7702-B appears to prefer these conditions.\n\n\nOne researcher even remarked that upon opening 7702-B's canister for routine cleaning, the entity slapped its cleaning tool away and vocalized the words \"JOY UNENDING\" and \"THE TRUTH IS INSIDE ME.\"\n\n\nBy contrast, all attempts to create a larger and more humane enclosure for the entity have resulted in near-constant shrieks of distress and flailing.\n\n\nSome have posited that this is an attempt at reverse psychology on the part of a clever prisoner. However, this could have something to do with the philosophy that 7702-B has displayed in the records of Project Th\u00f6kk - i.e. \"rotting\" to attain spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\nIf this is true, then we have another problem: the Foundation's strict adherence to the \"not a hotel\" policy. At the same time, while 7702-B's actions in the past are undoubtedly heinous, the Foundation does not exist as a supernatural criminal justice system.\n\n\nSo we're left at a crossroads:\n\n\n\n\nDo we keep it bottled and allow the enemy to be happy forever through what might secretly be cruelty?\n\n\nDo we expend additional resources to torture the entity with what might secretly be mercy?\n\n\nDo we alternate between the two?\n\n\nOr perhaps there's some fourth option hidden in plain sight?\n\n\n\n\nIf Director Naismith were to advise us directly on this matter, it would be appreciated. We've had 12 separate hung referendums about the 7702-B question\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Th\u00f6kk - Final Transmission\n\n\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I've been lying here in this meadow for the past two months. My eyes have been closed. I've heard a few animals here and there, and the wind has been warm against my nose.\n\n\nI don't know why I haven't moved. I guess I'm just waiting for the other shoe to fall. Going through as much long-term Murk torture as I have can't be good for the psyche, but I just\u2026\n\n\nI remember it, but I don't remember feeling it.\n\n\nPerhaps this was a little bonus from Traufek. \u2026once I leave, I should really start spelling the names the way they were originally. T-R-A-U and F-E-K. It's gonna be hard to get used to.\n\n\nI wonder what Trau's up to these days. If she's not trying to save Traufek's dream, what sort of work does she have lined up instead?\n\n\nAs for Fek\u2026\n\n\nI'm not entitled to him. I've gotta have some contingency plan lined up in case he doesn't feel the same way he used to about me. But at the bare minimum, I'm gonna get to see him again at some point \u2014 and that'll be more than enough.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nI remember the first time Dr. Lisle Naismith told me that the world couldn't truly be saved. \nYou could only save a few perfect days\n, and that was what was truly worth fighting for.\n\n\nI gave him a lot of shit, but Lisle was one of the handful of genuinely good guys at Site-59. I guess that's why he was in charge.\n\n\nBut if I ever get the chance to see him again (I mean, that'll never happen, but fuck you, this is rhetorical), I'll have to correct him on one minor point: it is entirely possible to save your world, the one that's within your purview.\n\n\nIt's possible even if you've done what I've done, and even if you've been as completely and utterly boned as I have. I was stuck at the bottom of an ocean of caustic filth for over 500 years (still not convinced, but that's what Massy told me), and even then I was able to find a way to improve my situation using only what I had available. If even an idiot like me could do it\u2026\n\n\nI guess that was the \"evergreen\" bullshit that VUUOU was on about. But it'll be a cold day in Corbenic before I let him take credit for what Fek and I accomplished.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nNo more waiting. I'm ready to open my eyes.\n\n\nFek:\n Food?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n \nGAAAH WHAT THE FUCK DUDE YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN INCH OVER ME JESUS\n\n\nTrau:\n \nNow\n what are you doing, Fek?!\n\n\nFek:\n Trau, look over here! I thought this eat-food over here was dead-kill but it \nmoved!\n\n\nTrau:\n For the last fucking time, not everything with skin-flesh is\u2014\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Actually, I'm talk-food.\n\n\nTrau:\n SEE?!\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Sorry, guys. Talk-food isn't eat-food.\n\n\nTrau:\n Psh. Everyone knows \nthat.\n\n\nFek:\n Wait a moment\u2026\n\n\n(Footsteps approaching Salas.)\n\n\nDo you \nknow\n this talk-food?\n\n\n(Trau rapidly files through paper in a notebook)\n\n\nTrau:\n Actually, I've never cataloged this one before\u2026\n\n\nFek:\n It's a \nnew\n talk-food. And it knows one of our rules. Has that ever happened before?\n\n\nTrau:\n Well, have you considered that \nmaybe\n it's such a stupidly obvious rule that even a neophyte could understand it?\n\n\nSalas (V):\n Yeah. Eating a talk-food always has this big pile of \nsad\n about it afterwards, doesn't it?\n\n\nTrau:\n \n(Prolonged gasp)\n\n\nFek:\n Fascinating\u2026\n\n\nTrau:\n I am \nso, so sorry,\n Talk-Food, but I need you to come with me \nright now\n so I can ask you \u2014 \n(checks notebook)\n \u2014 273 questions for the scroll I'm writing on talk-foodology!\n\n\nSalas (M):\n Oh no, she's adorable\u2026\n\n\nFek:\n You're \nscaring\n her, Trau. She's new here, remember?\n\n\n(Fek's voice comes closer; the sound is consistent with being hugged.)\n\n\nSorry about my sister \u2014 she can be a little go-do-now when she sees something new. But since you're here\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nTalk-Food?\n\n\nSalas (M):\n I'm home.\n\n\nTrau:\n \u2026is the talk-food crying? \nWhy is the talk-food crying?!\n\n\nFek:\n Oh, dear.

        "From: Lisle Naismith [ pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl#pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl ] To: Overseer Council Subject: Personnel Change Request Relevant Employee Information: Personal Details Name: Dr. Amelia Victoria Salas Maldonado Gender: Female Age: 27 Birthplace: Albuquerque, New Mexico Languages Spoken: English, Spanish, Japanese Specialty: Anomalies involving electronics, computers, and radio waves Additional Skills: Attained a fifth-dan ranking in kendo as a civilian; often called in for testing with sword anomalies Professional Details Position: Class-C Researcher at Site-59 Security Clearance: Level 4 Currently Assigned Item: SCP-2527 Previously Assigned Items: (abridged list \u2014 more information available in her SCiPnet listing .) SCP-7373 SCP-3162 SCP-3137 SCP-2845 SCP-3034 \u2014 Note: Used experimental radio-wave hacking technology to identify the entity responsible for the transmissions. Due to the resulting intense psychological trauma, amnestics were issued. SCP-2803 \u2014 Note: Longest assignment. Developed a pacifying rapport with SCP-2803-A. Upon leaving, Dr. Salas was named \"honeraryee TotleighSoft SHAR HLODER off teh MUNF!\" (sp) by SCP-2803-A. SCP-231 \u2014 Note: Due to staff shortages and logistical issues, Dr. Salas was called in on 4/19/21 to oversee Procedure 110-Montauk. Amnestics were issued immediately thereafter. Council, I've been looking into the history of the volunteer you've allowed to participate in the upcoming 2922-assisted exploration of SCP-7702. I'd be the last to deny that she has - at one point - been a valuable asset here at Site-59. The aspect of sending her on a potential suicide mission sobers me. But that's not why I'm making this request. Site-59's internal mental health department has brought an important variable to my attention. There have been reports of Dr. Salas remembering things she shouldn't have. Nothing illicit, but seemingly mundane information, such as what her breakfast was on the morning before she was amnesticized. There is a nonzero chance that Dr. Salas is immune to amnestics. This is only hypothetical, of course. I'm doubtful that the cause is anomalous; more likely, the product of genetics and incompatible brain chemistry. But if true, this would be the first recorded case of this condition, which the research team and I have since named Myosotis 2 . I suppose if you extrapolated this problem, we would need to screen all employees for potential Myosotis. On a more relevant note, if Dr. Salas does indeed have Myosotis, then that would mean she remembers having assisted with some of the most mentally scarring assignments we have to offer \u2014 including Procedure 110-Montauk, the containment procedures for SCP-2845 , and [5/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]. In all likelihood, she puts up a front of ignorance to avoid termination, while internally processing an inordinate amount of psychological trauma when alone. The behavioral citations may also have something to do with this. Over the course of her five years of service, I've personally seen her grow more bitter, aggressive, and melancholy by the day. The only times she shows any positive emotions anymore are when she's destroying our morale with tasteless wisecracks. Her poor attitude has alienated her colleagues save for a handful of friends in the IT department, and even they have to walk on eggshells to keep her from cursing someone out. This has also negatively affected her performance. She only really shines when she's working with TotleighSoft anomalies. Word of mouth among staff is that she finds something in the blind naivete of \"P. Hudson Gock\" that makes her feel nostalgia for when she was still dreaming of joining the Foundation one day, rather than actually participating. (When she first joined us, her enthusiasm for the science of anomalies was infectious. Truth be told, I find it hard to hold this negativity against her \u2014 if even the brightest mind among us were resistant to amnestics, they, too, would be struggling like this.) The point is, Dr. Salas's mind is in a very bad place right now, so she may not have volunteered in good faith. I believe she's trying to use an anomaly with a near-100% disappearance rate as a means of suicide. Consider this my request to remand Dr. Salas into observation until an alternative method of amnestics can be implemented. - Director Naismith",
        "From: Overseer Council To: Lisle Naismith [ pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl#pcs.noitadnuof|htimsianl ] Subject: Personnel Change Request Request denied. Send her into SCP-7702 as planned. \"Myosotis\" is definitely worth looking into, but it's still only a hypothesis. More research is needed before this condition can be a deciding factor in our operations. As for Dr. Salas \u2014 your concern for your employees' well-being is commendable. But you would do well to remember how common it is for civilians to grow to hate their job without supernatural aid. SCP-7702 has not yet appeared in Central Park on a hot day. But the fact that this is hypothetically possible means that we can't waste any more time in finding a way to prevent that from happening. Besides, if she does want to die, then that makes her a more ethical candidate for this investigation than someone who doesn't. - O5-2",
        "Notice from the Project Th\u00f6kk Transcription Team First of all, this log has been abridged to allow for only the significant portions. For the unabridged log, please contact us directly. I've heard reports from the telepathy research department about Dr. Salas's particular iteration of SCP-2922. They've been tinkering with a copy of the SCP-2922 to make a newer version that could better help the exploration of areas like Corbenic. This prototype version was given to Salas. What this means in the way of transcription is that the logs also pick up any noise picked up by Salas's ears. We don't believe that Salas was aware that she had transmitted some of these. - Keith Pauling, Chief Transcription Liaison for Project Th\u00f6kk",
        "Before I came here, my name was Xanthias. I was a slave from the first time I opened my eyes to the last time I closed them on Earth. My one living relative was an older brother named Medon \u2014 he was also a slave. I cherished him more than anything else. His were the unwavering arms that sheltered me from our cruelest masters. I was born in Athens. It was never a good life \u2014 Medon and I were passed around from master to master, praying to Athena that this one would be a little kinder. But once the Persians took the city, I began to yearn for the past, when life was merely intolerable rather than excruciating. King Dareios and his demons blamed all Athenians equally for some nonsense in Ionia. The stench of corpses choked the air of every street. We were handed off to one of Dareios's close associates, a general who lived in Ecbatana. The general gave me the title of cupbearer. He never once asked me to bear a cup. \"Cupbearer\" must have been a euphemism for everything else he did to me. As my torments grew daily, so did Medon's desire for revenge. One night, when the general had too much to drink, Medon smothered both him and his wife as they lay in their beds. And since they were the general's guests at the time, Medon turned his blade on King Dareios. Had he drawn the knife an instant sooner, you would have known Medon today as the man who slew Darius the Great. Medon was sentenced unto the boats. Have you heard of it? \u2026before I describe it to you, have you eaten recently? The boats were the Persians' specialty. Medon was clasped in a coffin of two boats facing one another. His hands, feet, and head were exposed. Torturers forced milk and honey down his throat. Bathed him in it. Medon and his prison were left in a pond to decay in the open sunlight. Every so often the Persians would come to feed him once more. I fled my new master and searched throughout the countryside for Medon. For two weeks, I was unsuccessful. But on the fifteenth day, when I found him, every manner of verminous pest had been summoned by two weeks of vomit and excrement. He was being devoured from within. And he was smiling. Once I had finished weeping, I leaned down to break his neck. But my brother spoke, and a mouthful of biting flies slurred his speech. \"No, Xanthias. The darkest and coldest house in Hades is reserved for he who kills his own brother out of jealousy.\" \"Jealousy?\" said I. \"Is it so unusual that you would be jealous? Thousands upon thousands of new and curious children are born from my flesh. Life has begun upon my soil, and I have become a world. The instant I ceased my resistance, Prince VUUOU 5 anointed me in my waking dreams. My agony cleansed me of all worldly and temporary joys. Only the secret immortal light remained, the one that shines the brightest in adversity. And when that light was no longer smothered by mundane comfort\u2026 I became the king who rules myself. By my divine right, I abolished everything but truth and beauty from my kingdom. Fiakh Duhazh Esto. Fiakh Duhazh Esto! FIAKH DUHAZH ESTO!\" By then, I had broken his neck. His last breath was spent on a squeal of joy, as if he were in the arms of a vicious lover twice his size. His broken body burned itself into my mind as an ashen silhouette. It was not even my fear that overcame me - I was mystified by how anyone could find such happiness in the worst tortures imaginable. I had no want of his fate. But I needed the peace he had found. For years, I was in the thrall of that singular image worse than I had ever been in the thrall of a slaver. I thought I was going mad. Seeking anything to take my mind off that moment, I wandered aimlessly toward the east, stealing meals from towns I'd never visit again, scraping by as a vagrant. My madness only ended the day I died, alone and naked, in the stable of someone else's diseased horse. Because when I closed my eyes for the last time\u2026 I opened them to see VUUOU, smiling down upon me. He asked of me, \"Did it hurt when you died?\" I nodded. \"Did the littlest creatures of the stables feast upon you?\" I nodded. \"And how did it feel?\" I replied: \"I still do not understand.\" \"You will , Xanthias. The longer the adversity, the more beauty is forged within\u2026\"",
        "Incident Log - Incident-7702-Blue Date: 2/10/22 Time: 10:02 AM EST <Begin Log> (Junior Researcher Cliff Daniels is loading a D-class staff member's remains into a body bag toward the northern wall of the testing field. Through his headset, he's connected to SCP-2527-2's operator, Junior Researcher Carl Grodin.) Daniels: What could even cause these injuries? Grodin: Funny story. Someone looked into the source code and found a bunch of abilities that TotleighSoft was keeping hidden. Some kind of secret bonus content. Now, Massy can pull someone's limbs apart with telekinesis. Daniels: No kidding. Who found that? Grodin: (Chuckles) Your favorite person\u2026 Daniels: You're shittin' me. Grodin: The very same. Massy was Dr. Salas's little pet project. Daniels: Don't even remind me of that edgy b \u2014 (A red phone on a wall of the enclosure starts ringing.) Grodin: \u2026what the hell? Daniels: Is that for me? Grodin: That's impossible. That phone goes to the breach desk. It's one-way. \u2026you'd think they'd have taken the ringer out. (The phone keeps ringing.) Daniels: I'm assuming that's not gonna go to voicemail\u2026? Grodin: Pick it up. (Daniels does so.) Daniels: Hello? O5-2: Does the Black Moon Howl? Grodin: Hoo boy\u2026 Daniels: Uh\u2026 only on Bloody Sunday? (Sotto voice) That's what I'm supposed to say, right, Carl? O5-2: Close enough. To whom am I speaking? Daniels: Junior Researcher Cliff Daniels, sir. O5-2: Ah, yes, the one with the annoying voice. Daniels: You know me? O5-2: Er, that is, I was undercover. But that's not important. I am sorry to place this burden on your shoulders, but if what I'm about to ask you isn't done five minutes ago, the human race is doomed. Daniels: What's going on?! O5-2: I'll explain later. For now, I need you to place this receiver against the side of SCP-2527-1's head. Now. Daniels: Uh\u2026 Carl, this cord only goes so far. Grodin: I'm on it.

Salas: Thanks. For the record, Carl, I maintain the sentiment from the \"uncensored opinions\" transmission that you have the cutest butt in Site-59.

        "Note: SCP-2527-1 \"Just after Incident-7702-Black wrapped up, Daniels and I noticed that a new instance of SCP-2527-1 appeared in its containment crate out of nowhere. And for five seconds, the screen of SCP-2527-2 read \"LIFES REMANEING: 98.\" - Carl Grodin, Experiment Coordinator for SCP-2527",
        "Memorandum on SCP-7702-B from the Ethics Committee SCP-7702-B's containment measures are still under development. The Ethics Committee hasn't come to this much of an impasse in years. While permanent solitary confinement in a cramped metal canister would be abject cruelty for any other sentient anomaly, 7702-B appears to prefer these conditions. One researcher even remarked that upon opening 7702-B's canister for routine cleaning, the entity slapped its cleaning tool away and vocalized the words \"JOY UNENDING\" and \"THE TRUTH IS INSIDE ME.\" By contrast, all attempts to create a larger and more humane enclosure for the entity have resulted in near-constant shrieks of distress and flailing. Some have posited that this is an attempt at reverse psychology on the part of a clever prisoner. However, this could have something to do with the philosophy that 7702-B has displayed in the records of Project Th\u00f6kk - i.e. \"rotting\" to attain spiritual enlightenment. If this is true, then we have another problem: the Foundation's strict adherence to the \"not a hotel\" policy. At the same time, while 7702-B's actions in the past are undoubtedly heinous, the Foundation does not exist as a supernatural criminal justice system. So we're left at a crossroads: Do we keep it bottled and allow the enemy to be happy forever through what might secretly be cruelty? Do we expend additional resources to torture the entity with what might secretly be mercy? Do we alternate between the two? Or perhaps there's some fourth option hidden in plain sight? If Director Naismith were to advise us directly on this matter, it would be appreciated. We've had 12 separate hung referendums about the 7702-B question\u2026",
