This restriction is to be enforced on all non-Foundation aircraft. A fenced perimeter of 2 kilometers is to be maintained at all times surrounding SCP-2621.\n\n\nFoundation survey, excavation, and exploration of SCP-2621 must be approved by the 2621 project director, the Ethics Committee and the current O5 supervisory member for the 2621 Project.\n\n\nSatellite and ground based surveillance is to be carried out regularly on the site and any changes in the behaviors of SCP-2621-1 instances are to be reported to the 2621 project director. High level surveillance of SCP-2621 is to be carried out daily for a period of 6 months following the conclusion of Operation 2621-1 and any future operations.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2621 is a collection of ruins approximately 16 kilometers south of the city of Hillah, Iraq. Physical approach of closer than 1.3 kilometers to SCP-2621 is difficult due to the presence of several entities (identified hereafter as SCP-2621-1 instances) around the ruin's perimeter. These instances attempt to prevent outside access to SCP-2621. SCP-2621-1 vary in appearance but most are exceptionally tall, winged, and white clothed humanoids carrying swords.\n\n\nWhile the majority of SCP-2621 is only accessible via an underground cavern, several ruined buildings still stand above ground. SCP-2621-1 instances use several of these ruined structures as access points for the underground caverns.\n\n\nSCP-2621 is believed to have been inhabited during a period of time lasting between 2440-2291 BCE. Satellite photography and limited spectrographic analysis indicates that anachronistic materials and methods were used in their construction. Several of these buildings utilized reinforced concrete, a technology that did not see wide use until the mid 1800s.\n\n\nWhat danger, if any, the central anomaly may represent is currently unknown. As the SCP-2621-1 instances will use lethal force to protect SCP-2621, exploration without military accompaniment is not advised.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Access\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Operation\u00a02621-1\u00a0Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation 2621-1\n\nOn August 19th 2016, an archeological expedition to determine the true nature of SCP-2621 was approved by relevant project staff, the Ethics Committee, and the supervisory member of the O5 council for the 2621 project.\n\n\nSeveral MTFs were assembled for this purpose, including MTF Epsilon-3 (\"The Joneses\"), MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\"), and MTF Tau-5 (\"Samsara\"). Utilizing satellite imaging of SCP-2621 and behavioral data relating to SCP-2621-1 instances, a plan to acquire information was approved. The joint over-watch commander for this operation was designated as Agent Bradley.\n\n\nIt was determined that Tau-5 would provide a direct physical distraction for the SCP-2621-1 instances while Nu-7 would use its aerial assets to assist in rapid insertion and extraction of Epsilon-3's combat trained archeologists. All three teams were used during the planning phase and given over-watch responsibilities alongside the remaining 2621 staff during the operation.\n\n\nThe following is an event log detailing this operation.\n\n\n<13:12:39>\n Agent Bradley orders ground elements of Tau-5 cross the 1.3 kilometer exclusion zone from the south of SCP-2621 in two motorized troop transports. SCP-2621-1 instances posted around the surface of SCP-2621 take to the air and move rapidly to intercept the transports.\n\n\n<13:14:01>\n Eight SCP-2621-1 instances approach the troop transports. The transports stop and 16 members of Tau-5 exit the vehicles.\n\n\n<13:14:15>\n First contact with SCP-2621-1 instances. All -1 instances draw their swords which ignite immediately in flames. Tau-5 engage the -1 instances.\n\n\n<13:14:17>\n Nu-7 begins a rapid northern approach of SCP-2621 with elements of their helicopter squadron. Nu-7 crosses into the exclusion zone without a response from SCP-2621-1 instances.\n\n\n<13:14:29>\n Tau-5 has killed or subdued all 8 attacking -1 instances. 18 more -1 instances emerge from below SCP-2621 and begin moving rapidly towards Tau-5.\n\n\n<13:14:58>\n Nu-7 approaches within 300 meters of SCP-2621 and encounters a previously unidentified hovering entity. This entity appears as a disembodied head at the center of two flaming, nested, and perpendicular wheels. The outside of both wheels are covered with golden eyes which begin to fire several beams at Nu-7. After a second and a half delay, Agent Bradley gives orders to fire AGM-114 Hellfire missiles at this entity. All missiles strike the target which breaks into pieces and falls to the ground. Nu-7 continues to approach SCP-2621.\n\n\n<13:16:23>\n Tau-5 encounters the 18 approaching instances of SCP-2621-1. These instances attempt to keep range on Tau-5 and send streams of flame through their swords at Tau-5. These attacks are remarkably inaccurate and the -1 instances are either incapacitated or killed over a period of 47 seconds.\n\n\n<13:17:18>\n Despite a clear weather forecast, the sky begins to darken as Nu-7 arrives above SCP-2621. A team of 12 Epsilon-3 members rappel into the ruins. While -1 instances are present underground, Epsilon-3 meet little hostile resistance. These instances are not armed. Members of Epsilon-3 begin taking samples and collecting data.\n\n\n<13:22:40>\n Agent Bradley informs Tau-5 of an approaching object. This object appears as a large flaming cross that splits the clouds as it falls to earth. The object embeds itself in the ground approximately 20 meters from Tau-5 and several dozen SCP-2621-1 instances emerge from the object's glowing sides to engage Tau-5.\n\n\n<13:24:54>\n Nu-7's helicopter squadrons begin to be buffeted by wind and rain. The sudden weather phenomena are well within the equipment's tolerance.\n\n\n<13:46:39>\n Tau-5 has encountered 338 SCP-2621-1 instances at this point, though the initial flow of instances has slowed considerably. Tau-5 sets up a perimeter around the glowing cross and begins to pick off instances as they exit.\n\n\n<13:48:33>\n Epsilon-3's survey and collection window as defined by the engagement plan is concluded. Epsilon-3 returns to the helicopter squadron.\n\n\n<13:49:09>\n Tau-5 has cleared the engagement zone of all SCP-2621-1 instances, with a current tally of 484 instances killed or incapacitated. The MTF has suffered several minor injuries during the engagement but remains at full strength. Agent Bradley orders Nu-7 to Tau-5's location to assist in their withdrawal from the field of operation.\n\n\n<13:50:51>\n Nu-7 moves south and provides close air support during Tau-5's withdrawal from the battlefield. 17 new instances of SCP-2621-1 emerge and are eliminated during this time. The task force general staff conclude that the cross must be destroyed to ensure a safe withdrawal.\n\n\n<13:52:30>\n Tau-5 fires several shoulder mounted rocket launchers while Nu-7 fires a number of Hellfire missiles at the object. Some pass through the center of the object while others impact the ground surrounding it. The object shatters into shards and collapses.\n\n\n<13:54:47>\n Tau-5 boards their troop transports and leave the area, followed by Nu-7's helicopter squadron.\n\n\n<14:00:12>\n Several SCP-2621-1 instances slowly exit SCP-2621 with their hands above their heads. After several minutes they begin the process of recovering the injured SCP-2621-1 instances along with the corpses. None are armed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0Access\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Evaluation\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the months following this operation several members of the joint task force suffered psychological issues relating to their experiences during the operation. Initial suspicion of long-term memetic or psionic effects were ruled out through testing. Regardless, several members of the team required a full course of amnestics in order to return to operating capacity. Agent Bradley was interviewed by 2621 project director Dr. Mart\u00ednez following these events. Relevant excerpts of that interview are below.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n Why do you think some of your team is having so much trouble with the operation?\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n That's hard for me to guess. Ramirez was raised Catholic and he was definitely hit the hardest.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n His profile lists him as an atheist.\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n Yeah. All of us were, for some pretty obvious reasons. Much as I'd like to think that it's a binary thing there are levels to that shit.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n So it's about their faith?\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n I mean, it's one thing to believe that there is no god, it's another entirely to mow down his avenging army like they're made of cardboard.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n What about you?\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n Even if we hadn't killed 500 of those things out in the desert, I think that collapsed tower at the center is a pretty good sign that some of the Bible might be true.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n And that doesn't bother you?\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n The Bible paints God as a petty and vindictive son of a bitch. But He's gotta follow rules like every other anomaly I ever heard of, and we saw some of those rules on the battlefield.\n\n\nDr. Mart\u00ednez:\n So you're not having the same kind of crisis of faith?\n\n\nAgent Bradley:\n No. I'm right where I was before this whole business started. If God exists, it can't shoot worth a damn and I've got close air support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Artifact\u00a0Listing\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Artifact\u00a0Listing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered artifacts are currently being evaluated by Foundation staff.
