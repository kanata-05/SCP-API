Due to its extreme durability and ability to withstand almost any form of damage, SCP-7163 does not need to be maintained regularly. Whenever its anomalous effects occur, affected personnel must inform the head of Applied Occultism of the exact advice given by SCP-7163. Currently, SCP-7163 is under the supervision of \nDougall Deering\n Udo Okorie.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7163 is a frog sculpture constructed of sand. The frog is depicted sitting on a rock, and its forelegs are crossed. The sculpture is remarkably resistant to nearly all forms of damage, including extreme environmental conditions. SCP-7163 can be preserved for an exceedingly prolonged period of time, potentially indefinitely. Carved into the back of the sculpture is the English sentence \u201cI Will Be Here Whenever You Need Me The Most.\u201d\n\n\nOn a random day every year, SCP-7163 will telepathically speak to a member of Site-43\u2019s staff, and beckon them to visit it. SCP-7163 usually selects staff that are undergoing a situation that is affecting their mental health considerably. Once that member of staff reaches SCP-7163, the anomaly will begin telepathically giving advice to that member of staff that would help solve that staff member\u2019s current situation, and improve their current well-being. When followed, the advice given is very beneficial to help solve these issues, and personnel have reported that their general mental well-being improved significantly after conversing with SCP-7163.\n\n\nResearch is ongoing in order to determine the creator of SCP-7163, and the exact mechanics behind SCP-7163\u2019s telepathy and its advice.\n\n\nAddendum 7163.1:\n Phenomenological Overview\n\n\nSCP-7163 was discovered on 1999/03/14 at North Grand Bend Beach when an MTF spotted the anomaly as they were pursuing a loup-garou\n1\n that had escaped containment. The loup-garou that they were pursuing attempted to run through the sculpture, however, the sculpture was not broken through, and the creature was impeded long enough for the MTF to recapture it. SCP-7163 was subsequently taken to Site-43.\n\n\nThree months after its discovery, its primary anomalous capabilities were uncovered when Junior Researcher Ezekiel Hargreaves reported hearing a voice in their head directing them towards the location of the anomaly. After following this voice, it revealed itself to be the sculpture, and it began to give advice to Ezekiel and consoled them about their current familial issues, including the recent passing of a close family member. Ezekiel reluctantly decided to follow its advice, later reporting feeling much better mentally, and that they are slowly beginning to resolve their relationship with their family.\n\n\nOn 2000/10/03, SCP-7163 contacted janitor Martin Whittle, who was suffering from depression at the time. Once Martin finished his conversation with SCP-7163, he decided to go talk to a therapist about his mental health, and was given anti-depressants and ways to help cope with his depression. Martin later confirmed that the advice that SCP-7163 had given helped him make that decision to visit his therapist, and that his depression became much more manageable to deal with. SCP-7163 then went inactive for the second time, and did not become active again until 2001/05/17, when it contacted Junior Researcher Parker Genrikh, who had anxiety troubles after first arriving at Site-43. SCP-7163 then gave Parker advice that would help him stay calm in stressful situations.\n\n\nThe head of Applied Occultism, Dougall Deering, saw this pattern of activity and began to take interest in the anomaly, and commenced research on the anomaly to determine its origin and the exact mechanics of its telepathy. Initial inquiry into the anomaly revealed that the sand used to construct the sculpture dated back to 4000 BCE. The sculpture also emits faint traces of Akiva radiation, suggesting religious association. However, SCP-7163 does not correspond with any other artifact of known deities.\n\n\nAddendum 7163.2:\n Further Inquiry into SCP-7163\n\n\nOn 2001/11/25, Dougall Deering resumed his research after a hiatus focusing on higher priority projects. For this research, he brought in Researcher Udo Okorie, whose thaumaturgic Talent allows her to manipulate granules of sand, and perform numerous tasks with these granules. Deering began to perform multiple experiments with Okorie to determine clues about SCP-7163, its properties, and its origins.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nFootage captures SCP-7163\u2019s containment chamber. The sculpture is sitting on a pedestal in the center of the chamber.\n\n\nDeering and Okorie enter the chamber.\n\n\nDeering:\n Here we are.\n\n\nDeering steps closer to the sculpture, and makes his way next to the pedestal and turns around.\n\n\nDeering:\n Alright. So, Udo, today we are going to work on a project that I had to put off for a while, but now that we\u2019re beginning to expand the capabilities of your Talent, I feel like we can finally make progress. And it\u2019s all because of \nthis\n.\n\n\nDougall rests his shoulder around the sculpture and taps it on the side of its head.\n\n\nOkorie:\n A frog sculpture?\n\n\nDeering:\n Yes, but not just any sculpture. This anomaly right here has been quite the peculiarity for my team and I. On a random day two years ago, it spoke to one of our junior researchers directly in their head, and they were on the other side of the site at the time, mind you. It told them a lot of information about their relationship with their family, which only they knew about, and asked them to walk right into its chamber so that it could supposedly help them.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Did they go up to it?\n\n\nDeering:\n They did, yes. And I can see why they did. It would be terrifying to find out that something out there knows everything about you, even information that\u2019s meant to be kept secret.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Like all the projects you keep up there?\n\n\nOkorie taps the side of her head.\n\n\nDeering:\n Most definitely. There are some projects of mine that I don\u2019t want getting into the wrong hands. Especially the ones that matter. I can\u2019t afford to lose those.\n\n\nDeering looks up at Okorie for a second, before looking back at the sculpture.\n\n\nDeering:\n But that\u2019s not the point. Once the researcher entered this anomaly\u2019s chamber, it began to start giving out advice to help this researcher deal with issues that they had with their family. They didn\u2019t think this advice would be effective, I didn\u2019t either when they told me about it, but they did eventually follow the advice, and it worked! The advice helped this researcher push through uncharted waters, and helped them make amends with their family, just like that.\n\n\nOkorie:\n That could make an effective therapist.\n\n\nDeering:\n If it started being more active, maybe Anoki could use an assistant from time to time. But it only ever became active twice more since, with each occurring on two separate years. We tried several directions to see what this sculpture could represent and where it came from, but those all came up as dead ends. I only got one more chance to finally figure this all out, so we can use this anomaly for the benefit of our personnel. And that\u2019s where you come in.\n\n\nDeering:\n Since you\u2019re starting to unlock your fullest potential, I thought it would be good to take on a little side project, just for fun. Maybe we can try exploring some other pathways that your Talent can cross. There are so many things that we can do with it, but it requires a lot of focus. And we can start with one, for now. From when you were younger.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Is this the thing I told you about when I was nine?\n\n\nDeering:\n Yes. When you were at the beach with your family.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Look, that was just a one-time thing. I didn\u2019t even know how I did it. I thought it was just my imagination.\n\n\nDeering:\n But it did happen. You focused on what you wanted to see, to feel right there in the sand, and you saw something.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I guess I saw impressions of something. Flashes of events that the sand experienced, that it felt. I think I even saw the beach when it was first formed. But when I started looking for too long, I got a severe headache, and I had to stop.\n\n\nDeering:\n But it did work. And now we can do it again. Because you have the reins, now. You can control it.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I don\u2019t know if I can do it again. It\u2019s been years.\n\n\nDeering:\n It has, but I think you can tap in there again. You have the potential, you just need to focus on what you want to see. Just breathe, and focus.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Alright. I\u2019ll try.\n\n\nOkorie begins to pull out a bag full of sand, however she is stopped by Deering.\n\n\nDeering:\n I don\u2019t think you need those.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Are you saying that I shouldn\u2019t use my reagents? You know I can\u2019t use my magic with just my bare hands.\n\n\nDeering:\n But you did, didn\u2019t you? You didn\u2019t have those reagents when you were nine. But you still pushed through, and found what you wanted. I think you can do it again.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Are you sure about this?\n\n\nDeering:\n I am. I think you\u2019ll find what you need.\n\n\nDeering:\n Let\u2019s see how deep this connection goes.\n\n\nOkorie slowly steps forward towards SCP-7163, and reaches out to touch it. She closes her eyes and begins to focus.\n\n\nDeering:\n Do you feel anything?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Yes! I can feel\u2026 something. I don\u2019t know what. There\u2019s something in here, and it\u2019s moving around. I think it\u2019s- Oh, it went away.\n\n\nDeering:\n That\u2019s interesting. See if you can try to push closer.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Okay, I will.\n\n\nOkorie grabs the sculpture from its pedestal and holds onto it, feeling around it as if searching for something.\n\n\nDeering:\n If you aren\u2019t finding anything else of note, we can try again tomorrow.\n\n\nOkorie:\n No, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll keep looking. I\u2019ll find something eve- Ow, shit!\n\n\nOkorie drops the sculpture and begins to clutch her forehead in pain. The sculpture remains intact. Deering rushes to check on the sculpture, making sure that it\u2019s intact, before rushing to Okorie\u2019s side.\n\n\nDeering:\n Udo! Can you hear me? Are you alright? Udo?\n\n\nUdo:\n It hurts. It \nhurts\n.\n\n\nOkorie then collapses onto the floor. Deering crouches down to check on her before standing and turning away from her.\n\n\nDeering:\n I\u2019m going to call Health and Pathology, get some help. You\u2019ll be alright. It\u2019s all going to be alright.\n\n\nDeering reaches for the emergency phone line and begins to dial to reach Health and Pathology. Just as he places the phone to his ears, Udo lets out a scream and releases her hands from her ears. The pain begins to subside.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Dougall\u2026\n\n\nDeering:\n This is Deering. We have an emergency. One of my researchers-\n\n\nOkorie:\n Dougall!\n\n\nDeering:\n Udo? Hang on for just a second.\n\n\nDeering rushes back over to Udo and helps her stand.\n\n\nDeering:\n Are you alright?\n\n\nOkorie:\n I feel fine. It only hurt for a little bit.\n\n\nDeering:\n At least the sculpture is intact. Who knows what would\u2019ve happened if it shattered when you dropped it. I would\u2019ve lost all the progress I made for my research in just seconds.\n\n\nDeering:\n We can work on something else tomorrow, take a little break.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I did find a few things, from the sand. It was just flashes again, but I did glean a few things when I touched the sculpture.\n\n\nDeering:\n What did you see?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Okay. This was a doozy, but- Ow! It\u2019s still burning in my brain.\n\n\nDeering:\n It\u2019s still fresh in your mind.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Yeah, I can see it clearly. There were flames, lots of flames. A huge, raging fire that just kept on burning. Then I found myself falling through the floor, a straight freefall down past many stars. I saw entire constellations whirl around me, constantly and without ever slowing down. Then I landed in darkness, flat on my face, right into the void. I looked up, and I saw something in the distance. Some kind of entity.\n\n\nDeering:\n What did this entity look like?\n\n\nOkorie:\n It was too blurry to make out at first, but I do know it was a very bright white. It hurt my eyes just seeing it. It looked human, but I couldn\u2019t make out any features beyond that. And I tried to crawl towards it, but then it reached out its hand, and I was brought back here.\n\n\nDeering:\n And you experienced all of that in thirty seconds?\n\n\nOkorie:\n That was only thirty seconds? Felt a lot longer than that.\n\n\nDeering:\n Hm. That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m glad that you did manage to find a few crumbs of information, but this is leaving me with more questions than answers.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t maintain my focus for longer. I could\u2019ve looked for more information, more hints.\n\n\nDeering:\n You did the best you could. You don\u2019t have anything to apologize for. You did great today, Udo. I\u2019m proud of your progress so far.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Thank you, Dougall.\n\n\nDeering:\n No, thank you, for being such a big help.\n\n\nDeering:\n This concludes our experiment for today. Udo, if you may.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right.\n\n\nOkorie picks the sculpture back up and returns it to Dougall, who places it on the pedestal. Dougall motions for Udo to follow him, and they both start to exit the chamber.\n\n\nDeering:\n We\u2019re going to do great things together. I just know it.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7163.3:\n Incident 7163.1\n\n\nOn 2002/09/08, the following incident took place near SCP-7163\u2019s containment chamber. At 16:45, Dougall Deering was seen walking towards SCP-7163\u2019s containment chamber. It is presumed that SCP-7163 contacted Deering to enter its chamber. The following incident occurred directly after this event.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDougall Deering enters the chamber. He closes the door behind him, and heads toward the center of the chamber.\n\n\nDeering:\n It\u2019s been a while.\n\n\nNo verbal response from SCP-7163. Deering tilts his head slightly, indicating that he is reacting to SCP-7163, and it is speaking telepathically.\n\n\nDeering:\n I see you\u2019re not willing to spill secrets. That\u2019s alright. I now have a chance to finally speak with you, after all this time.\n\n\nDeering:\n So, tell me. Why did you bring me here, to you? Why are you active for only a single day every year?\n\n\nThere is silence. The next five minutes are spent in this silence, with Deering staring at SCP-7163. Suddenly, Deering takes a step back, expressing confusion.\n\n\nDeering:\n \nWhat\n?\n\n\nDeering steps even closer to SCP-7163, inches away from its face. Another three minutes pass. Dougall then steps back, looks up at the ceiling, and begins to ponder about something.\n\n\nDeering:\n Well, that does make sense. But why?\n\n\nDeering stares at the sculpture for another two minutes, before nodding and placing his hands in his pockets.\n\n\nDeering:\n Before I go, I\u2019d like to thank you for helping me, whoever you are. I still have many questions, but I think I\u2019ll save those for another time. Besides, you have to go through a lot more people here before you get to me, anyway.\n\n\nDeering:\n I\u2019ll be going, now. It\u2019s been an enlightening experience, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\nDeering heads for the chamber doors, and exits the chamber, closing the doors behind him.\n\n\nDeering walks throughout all of the Applied Occultism Section, and starts to work on many minute chores, whistling as he does so.\n\n\nOnce he completes these chores, he enters one of the hallways that criss-crosses the Section, still whistling as he walks through. Once he passes Okorie\u2019s chamber, he glances at it for a few seconds, and smiles before continuing to head through the hallway.\n\n\nAs he makes his way through the hallway, he suddenly stops, turning his head to one side as though he was hearing something, and then mumbles a single word before his eyes roll back in his head as blood fills the sockets, and he falls to the floor at a bad angle, snapping his neck.\n2\n\n\nThe body of Dougall Deering was not discovered until a few hours after these events occurred, where Researcher Okorie stumbled upon his body after sealing a containment cell. Security and Containment personnel arrived to see Okorie sitting against the wall, pulling her legs up against her chest and sobbing, and staring at the body of Dougall Deering.\n\n\nAfter these events, nothing of interest occurred until two days after, on 2002/09/10 at 2:30 hours, when motion was detected inside SCP-7163\u2019s chamber. Camera footage shows Okorie standing in the doorway to the chamber proper, staring at SCP-7163 in the dark.\n\n\nOkorie:\n What did you tell him?\n\n\nThere is no response.\n\n\nOkorie:\n What did you \ntell him\n?\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nOkorie:\n It doesn\u2019t make sense. It couldn\u2019t be you because that\u2019s not what you do. You don\u2019t telepathically send someone a kill agent, you give them advice. You help them. But I need answers. That\u2019s the only thing that matters now. What did you tell him?\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nOkorie:\n It can\u2019t be you. But it might be you. I don\u2019t know. Why won\u2019t you tell me? What did he say to you? Before he- left me. What did he say?\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\nOkorie:\n You\u2019ve got to help me. Please. I need to know. Please.\n\n\nThere is silence. Udo waits for a moment, then begins to step closer to the sculpture, placing her hand on its forehead. She closes her eyes, and stands in this position for a moment. Nothing of significance occurs during this period. She then opens her eyes, and turns away from the sculpture. She leaves the chamber, closing the doors behind her, and does not look back.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7163.4:\n Counseling Log 7163.1\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of a mandatory check-in session between clinical psychiatrist Dr. Nhung Ngo and Udo Okorie that took place on 2012/09/09. Before this session took place, there have been no new major discoveries pertaining to SCP-7163 and its origins. A section of this session contains information about the investigation behind SCP-7163, and what Researcher Okorie had been doing to investigate this anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nNgo:\n I\u2019m very pleased that you could make this session today, Udo!\n\n\nOkorie:\n Yeah, I managed to find a time that would work for today.\n\n\nOkorie is seen in Ngo\u2019s office, sitting on a desk chair. Ngo can be seen with a clipboard on her lap and a pen in her hand.\n\n\nNgo:\n I get it, you\u2019re busy with all your projects. But today I thought you would be with your colleagues, at-\n\n\nOkorie:\n The remembrance events. I know, for the anniversary.\n\n\nNgo:\n Ten years.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Only ever felt like ten months. Especially considering I missed thirty percent of all that.\n\n\nNgo:\n I never thought that we\u2019d have to deal with an annual magic gunk explosion and have to take that seriously, but I guess that\u2019s just what life is for us now. We have to deal with it. We can\u2019t undo it, or reverse it. We just have to keep on moving.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I guess so.\n\n\nNgo:\n Back on topic, I brought you in here so that I can check in on you, see how you\u2019re feeling after all this time.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I feel fine. Just swell.\n\n\nNgo:\n I\u2019m sure you are. I have a few questions to ask you. First of all, you\u2019re still working while everyone else is off the clock. Why is that?\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019m just busy. Got a lot of projects to work on.\n\n\nNgo:\n Do you spend any time to, I don\u2019t know, take a break? Go out with friends? Go to the movies?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Sometimes.\n\n\nNgo:\n That\u2019s good to know. But you have been particularly busy as of late. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just because of every project that you have to do under the sun. No, I think it\u2019s because of something else. A project that you personally wish to complete. And here\u2019s my question: what kind of project has to make you spend all that time on completing instead of taking time off?\n\n\nOkorie:\n It\u2019s not important.\n\n\nNgo:\n I think it is. For you specifically. It\u2019s your pet project.\n\n\nOkorie:\n No, it\u2019s his. Or, was his.\n\n\nNgo:\n Can you elaborate on that?\n\n\nOkorie:\n There\u2019s a project that Dougall used to work on constantly. It was one of the first projects I ever worked on. It\u2019s still unfinished. We never got any concrete answers.\n\n\nNgo:\n What kind of project?\n\n\nOkorie:\n It\u2019s a frog sculpture. Constructed from sand, that\u2019s why he brought me in. We were trying to find information on where it came from, and examine how its anomalous properties functioned.\n\n\nNgo:\n It was Dougall\u2019s, and now it\u2019s yours. Are you continuing to experiment on this anomaly to finish what he started? In his memory, perhaps?\n\n\nOkorie:\n He\u2019s a body that drops right onto the floor at 5:18 in the afternoon, every year. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m commemorating anymore. He\u2019s just a memory, now.\n\n\nOkorie:\n But that sculpture\u2019s been sitting there for the longest time, and sometimes when I go past it I feel like it\u2019s staring at me, like it\u2019s waiting for me specifically, somehow. I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t want it to go to waste regardless.\n\n\nNgo:\n It\u2019s not going to go to waste. Maybe you just need to wait for the right time for it to become active again.\n\n\nOkorie:\n That can only happen if I am at my lowest. SCP-7163 only goes active to give advice to our staff when they\u2019re at rock bottom, and then it goes silent again for another year. And it\u2019s entirely random. I don\u2019t know if it will ever speak to me.\n\n\nNgo:\n Well then, if it\u2019s not going to crack, why are you still trying to open it?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Because I need to get it done. This sculpture was one of my first projects, and it\u2019s just been sitting there collecting dust. If I can\u2019t even solve something as simple as a safe class object from ten years ago, what does that mean for me? I don\u2019t know, it just feels like I\u2019m not trying hard enough.\n\n\nNgo:\n You\u2019re doing the best you can. You\u2019re a very talented thaumaturgist, and I don\u2019t believe that a simple sculpture is going to change that.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I have been using my talent, as well. I\u2019ve been feeling the sand to try and replicate what I did, but it\u2019s not letting me show what I want. It\u2019s been giving me nearly the exact same vision every time. I\u2019m not getting any answers.\n\n\nNgo:\n I think you need to take some time off from this. Clear your head, take a break, go have fun with your friends. Once your mind is cleared of the stress, maybe you can look at this from a different perspective. There\u2019s all kinds of answers, waiting in different directions. Even if there are setbacks, you can make the best of those setbacks and still keep on going. All you have to do is move forward.\n\n\nOkorie:\n But what if there aren\u2019t any directions to go off of?\n\n\nNgo:\n Then make your own and stick with it. Just try. You\u2019ll never know what you might find if you don\u2019t try.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019ll think about it.\n\n\nNgo:\n You\u2019ll be alright.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7163.5:\n Interview 7163.1\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of an interview between Chief Delfina Ibanez and SCP-7163 on 2021/11/30. This interview was made possible through the usage of Telescribe\n3\n technology. This interview was established to further understand SCP-7163\u2019s capabilities, and to determine the creator of the anomaly. Chief Ibanez was contacted by SCP-7163, and once she reached its chamber she conducted an impromptu interview, which has been transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7163\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Delfina Ibanez\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nChief Delfina Ibanez enters the room, dragging a chair into the room. She places the chair in front of SCP-7163\u2019s pedestal, and sits down.\n\n\nIbanez:\n Afternoon. Let\u2019s get to the point. You\u2019re going to try and cheer me up, give me some words of wisdom, tell me that\u2019s it all going to be okay, and then send me on my merry way. Is that correct?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n This is not a consolation, Delfina. I can see that you are not looking for that right now. This is more of a discussion.\n\n\nIbanez:\n I know that this isn\u2019t a consolation, because I know that she\u2019s not dead.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Do you?\n\n\nIbanez:\n She can\u2019t be dead. She can\u2019t be. There might be an overwhelming amount of evidence against this, but she\u2019s not dead.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n And why do you think this is the case?\n\n\nIbanez:\n Look, pal, we were in Alagadda, trying to fix everything, save the world, stop the \nImpasse\n, and lo and behold the fucking Hanged King himself decided to come down and say hi. There was literally no chance that she could have survived against him, but she faced him anyway. She gave her life to save us. To save the world. To save \nme\n.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n But you think she\u2019s still alive.\n\n\nIbanez:\n She has to be. She has to.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n You\u2019re conflicted. I get it. Your planet has endured a great deal of hardship this year. But all of this stagnation will end soon, won\u2019t it? She did that for you. So that all the beauty of this planet could see the light of day again.\n\n\nIbanez:\n I know. But it doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\n\nIbanez:\n I haven\u2019t gone to the funeral. I didn\u2019t sign the papers. Everyone else is talking about her. Telling stories about the time they had with her. Like she was a memory now. I can\u2019t have that.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Maybe she is a memory. Maybe she isn\u2019t. What do you want to do about it? Are you going to move on, or stand your ground and hope that she\u2019s still out there?\n\n\nIbanez:\n I\u2019m not the type to just sit around and wait. I\u2019m heading back to hell city tomorrow.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n That\u2019s a very bold move.\n\n\nIbanez:\n I know she\u2019s out there. I\u2019m going to find her.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I wish you good luck on your journey, then.\n\n\nIbanez:\n You\u2019re not going to tell me otherwise?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n The easiest option would be for you to follow everyone else\u2019s footsteps, and take your time to grieve. But that\u2019s not what you want. You have faith in her. You have a certain kind of fire, one that does not go out easily. You listen to what your heart tells you, and then you follow that path. I think it might be better for you to, just this once, listen to it. Follow it, see where it leads you. You might find your friend, you might not, but I think there\u2019s a good chance that you will.\n\n\nThere is a short pause.\n\n\nIbanez:\n I did not expect that. Thanks, whoever you are.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n What\u2019s your next course of action?\n\n\nIbanez:\n Well, I was supposed to get some information out of you, and then afterwards I\u2019m heading out to 19, got some planning to do.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Right now, I\u2019m not really sure that I have much to give you.\n\n\nIbanez:\n Why\u2019s that?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I can\u2019t let it be known who I truly am. That would create a little bit of an issue for your superiors.\n\n\nIbanez:\n Well, can you at least explain why your advice is so effective? How do you know our personnel so well that you can solve their problems with just a few words?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I can shed some light into that.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I do not have the ability to see all of history, through the past and future. But I can see people. I can see character, wants and desires, flaws, and the qualities that make people unique from one another. I take all of that, their past experiences, and what they want for their future, and I give them advice that specifically helps them achieve their goals. I want to give them hope for their future, make them see what I see in them.\n\n\nIbanez:\n You want to genuinely help people.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Yes. All living beings are sacred, but humans? They are one of the most fascinating species that I\u2019ve ever got to know. You have advanced so far in technology since I last saw this planet. Even in the past two decades, your technologies have advanced considerably. I think you should be proud of that.\n\n\nIbanez:\n Sure, but there are a lot of things about us that I don\u2019t think you would like.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Yes. Humanity does have the capability to commit heinous acts in the name of what people think is right. But you still have the capacity for love and kindness. It might not feel like it, but there are people out there who do have compassion, empathy, and generosity for others. That\u2019s what makes you stand out. Those are the qualities of your species that cannot die out.\n\n\nIbanez:\n How long have you been away from this planet? Because right now, we\u2019re at a losing game with that.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I have been watching your planet as of recently, and yes, it does seem as if the evils of this world are turning the tides, but I still have hope that no matter what happens, good will triumph. Just like your hope for your friend. All we can do is take action, and hope for the best.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I do wish you good luck on whatever path you decide to take. You will find her. And once you do, say hi to her for me. I have a lot to discuss with Udo. But that\u2019s for another time.\n\n\nThe voice goes silent. Ibanez is left sitting in the chamber. After a short pause she nods, stands up, picks up the chair, and moves to exit the chamber.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7163.6:\n Interview 7163.2\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. Okorie and SCP-7163 on 2022/12/15. This interview reveals a few important pieces of information about the creator of SCP-7163, and details about the exact purpose behind the object.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-7163\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Udo Okorie\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Okorie enters the chamber. She closes the chamber doors behind her, and stands directly in front of SCP-7163.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Are you going to say anything?\n\n\nThere is a short pause, before SCP-7163 finally speaks.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n For what it\u2019s worth, I do apologize for shutting the door on you, after all this time.\n\n\nOkorie:\n At least you\u2019re here, now. But why now?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I wanted to talk to you about a few things.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n For starters, your former supervisor. My condolences for what happened to him. I wish I was there to help you, after his passing. But I could not, unfortunately.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I thought I would never feel as happy as I did with him ever again, but I still pushed through. I can\u2019t give up on the things that I still have, even if I lose something great.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Do you still wish to know what I told him?\n\n\nOkorie:\n I don\u2019t think it matters, at this point. That was something that he needed at the time, not me.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n It has been a while since I last remember my interaction with him, but I think I recall something about his brother. The details are getting lost on me.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n But that\u2019s not the only thing I\u2019m here to discuss with you. There was quite a revelation that you had about a year ago. And another loss of someone very close to you.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I thought it would end with Dougall. But I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. It was out of my control.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Sometimes things have to end. And sometimes, they end on the spur of a moment, without your knowledge, without even a chance to say goodbye. But your dad passed knowing that you\u2019ll stay strong. You\u2019ll keep your head up. And he got to spend every last second with someone he loved. I bet that was good enough for him.\n\n\nOkorie:\n It\u2019s still hard, without him. It\u2019s just me and mom now, and it doesn\u2019t feel the same.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n It won\u2019t ever be the same. But you\u2019ll still push through. You\u2019ll remember all the good times that you had with him, and you\u2019ll keep your head up, for a brighter future.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Before we separated on Corbenic, he told me something that he was keeping from me, for the longest time. That I\u2019m not human.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Another woman, one not from Earth.\n\n\nOkorie:\n He met her in Alagadda, but I don\u2019t believe that she\u2019s from there. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been researching to find out who this woman really is, but I\u2019ve got nothing so far.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Does your Foundation know about this?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Yes. They haven\u2019t put me in a cage, and I\u2019m still able to work, but this whole thing has still been wracking my brain.\n\n\nOkorie:\n When I place my hand on this sculpture, I can feel what it feels. I can see impressions of events in the past, from what this sculpture saw. I never knew how I did it. And I did it with my bare hands. I never did anything without my reagents before then. But now it\u2019s starting to make more sense.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n It\u2019s truly wonderful, the talents that you wield.\n\n\nOkorie:\n But I don\u2019t know what I am now. I don\u2019t know who this woman is, what her people are, what any of this means.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Regardless of where you came from, you\u2019re still you. You\u2019re Udo Okorie. You have friends to support you, and just because you\u2019re only half-human, does not make you any lesser than what you thought you were before.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m truly capable of.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n You can start experimenting. One last project, to mark a new era.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Me.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I have faith that you will find what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I hope you\u2019re right.\n\n\nOkorie:\n But for now, I need to address the elephant in the room.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n This sculpture is more of the amphibian type.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019m not talking about the sculpture. I\u2019m talking about what\u2019s inside it.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Ah, of course.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I have a few notions of what you\u2019re supposed to be, but I think it\u2019d be better if I got to confirm it from the source.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Very well then. I\u2019m not going to give you the full picture, but I bet you\u2019ll put the pieces together in time.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019ve spent twenty years for this. You should at least give me something that isn\u2019t a vague vision.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I\u2019ll make sure that your time won\u2019t be wasted.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Before I left your planet, I buried this sculpture right at the area where you would find it. Near your site. Once the time came, I moved it up to where you could see it.\n\n\nOkorie:\n You wanted us to contain the sculpture.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Correct.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Why?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n So that the people in this site could have hope. So that no matter what, they\u2019ll keep standing to fight for what they love.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Your Foundation does not respect the life that it contains. It takes life. It pokes and it prods at it, so that the world outside will not be able to experience all that hides under the floorboards, and in every nook and cranny. But it only takes a single match to start a fire. There\u2019s always a chance to turn things around, for the better.\n\n\nOkorie:\n You\u2019re on the side of change.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I am on the side of every living being, on every planet, and in every star system. I am on the side of hope, so that every fire can stay alight, so that people like you, Udo, can bring change to the world.\n\n\nOkorie:\n But you kept yourself in this sculpture, just to help us. You never came out of where you\u2019re hiding at.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I was unable to help your planet for the longest time. I left to help others who needed my guidance, and it\u2019s been millennia since. Everything\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve seen your species grow in so many wonderful ways, but I\u2019ve seen many terrible things as well. Things I could have prevented.\n\n\nOkorie:\n You had too much on your plate. It was out of your control. But that\u2019s okay.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Because some things have to change.\n\n\nOkorie:\n And when they do, you keep moving. You have to keep trying.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Now you are beginning to understand.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019ve got a long way to go before that.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n You\u2019ll get there.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I\u2019m still thinking about why you still need to hide.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I don't know if I should reveal myself this soon. Nothing good would come of that. I do not wish to cause more mayhem than what has already been brought upon your planet.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Then we can start slowly. Maybe we can help each other.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Are you suggesting that I should help your Foundation?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Not the wider Foundation. I was thinking back to what you said. You said you wanted to help our site specifically. So that we can change for the better.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I doubt the entire Foundation could change their ways completely. You almost took the right path, when you had that fateful vote, but it only took one Council member to kill any last hope that the entire system will change itself. I just want things to be better, for your subjects in containment, for all the deviations of this planet that you lock away, and for all walks of life. These beings all deserve to live.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I doubt I can interfere more than I already have. But I can help you succeed. You can start the fire that will change the world for the better, so that others can follow your stead, and take charge to fight for what\u2019s right.\n\n\nOkorie:\n I still have doubts on that, but I\u2019ll try.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n You can start with finishing what you started.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Are you saying-\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n The visions. Yes. I intentionally blocked those out, so my identity could remain a secret. But I think you should have at least a bit of closure to this story.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Alright. Thank you.\n\n\nOkorie steps closer to the sculpture, placing her hand on the top of the sculpture\u2019s head, and closing her eyes. Fifteen seconds pass before she opens her eyes once more, and takes a step back in shock.\n\n\nOkorie:\n So it was you.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Correct.\n\n\nOkorie:\n This entire time, it was- Wow. How did I not figure this out sooner?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I thought the hints I gave were very clear on who I am.\n\n\nOkorie:\n Well, that\u2019s going to be a lot to think about.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n At least your project is finally complete. That\u2019s something to celebrate, is it not?\n\n\nOkorie:\n Yeah, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s done, at least.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n The first step for change is always the hardest, but when it is done it does pay off to what comes next.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n One more thing before you go. I\u2019ve had this on my mind for a while. How is Ezekiel?\n\n\nOkorie:\n They\u2019re doing alright, last time I spoke to them. They transferred to another site, and are now a senior researcher, last time I checked. They seem happy.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n That\u2019s good. We had a wonderful conversation. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re living their best life, now.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n It\u2019s been nice knowing you, Udo.\n\n\nOkorie:\n See you next year?\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n I will always be here. For you, and all of these wonderful people.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n Have a Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.\n\n\nOkorie turns around, and leaves the room. Just as she closes the chamber door behind her, SCP-7163 speaks once more, to no one in particular.\n\n\nSCP-7163:\n \nWill wonders ever cease?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Addendum 7163.1: Phenomenological Overview\nSCP-7163 was discovered on 1999/03/14 at North Grand Bend Beach when an MTF spotted the anomaly as they were pursuing a loup-garou 1 that had escaped containment. The loup-garou that they were pursuing attempted to run through the sculpture, however, the sculpture was not broken through, and the creature was impeded long enough for the MTF to recapture it. SCP-7163 was subsequently taken to Site-43.\nThree months after its discovery, its primary anomalous capabilities were uncovered when Junior Researcher Ezekiel Hargreaves reported hearing a voice in their head directing them towards the location of the anomaly. After following this voice, it revealed itself to be the sculpture, and it began to give advice to Ezekiel and consoled them about their current familial issues, including the recent passing of a close family member. Ezekiel reluctantly decided to follow its advice, later reporting feeling much better mentally, and that they are slowly beginning to resolve their relationship with their family.\nOn 2000/10/03, SCP-7163 contacted janitor Martin Whittle, who was suffering from depression at the time. Once Martin finished his conversation with SCP-7163, he decided to go talk to a therapist about his mental health, and was given anti-depressants and ways to help cope with his depression. Martin later confirmed that the advice that SCP-7163 had given helped him make that decision to visit his therapist, and that his depression became much more manageable to deal with. SCP-7163 then went inactive for the second time, and did not become active again until 2001/05/17, when it contacted Junior Researcher Parker Genrikh, who had anxiety troubles after first arriving at Site-43. SCP-7163 then gave Parker advice that would help him stay calm in stressful situations.\nThe head of Applied Occultism, Dougall Deering, saw this pattern of activity and began to take interest in the anomaly, and commenced research on the anomaly to determine its origin and the exact mechanics of its telepathy. Initial inquiry into the anomaly revealed that the sand used to construct the sculpture dated back to 4000 BCE. The sculpture also emits faint traces of Akiva radiation, suggesting religious association. However, SCP-7163 does not correspond with any other artifact of known deities.",
        "Addendum 7163.2: Further Inquiry into SCP-7163\nOn 2001/11/25, Dougall Deering resumed his research after a hiatus focusing on higher priority projects. For this research, he brought in Researcher Udo Okorie, whose thaumaturgic Talent allows her to manipulate granules of sand, and perform numerous tasks with these granules. Deering began to perform multiple experiments with Okorie to determine clues about SCP-7163, its properties, and its origins.",
        "Addendum 7163.3: Incident 7163.1\nOn 2002/09/08, the following incident took place near SCP-7163\u2019s containment chamber. At 16:45, Dougall Deering was seen walking towards SCP-7163\u2019s containment chamber. It is presumed that SCP-7163 contacted Deering to enter its chamber. The following incident occurred directly after this event.",
        "Addendum 7163.4: Counseling Log 7163.1\nThe following is a transcript of a mandatory check-in session between clinical psychiatrist Dr. Nhung Ngo and Udo Okorie that took place on 2012/09/09. Before this session took place, there have been no new major discoveries pertaining to SCP-7163 and its origins. A section of this session contains information about the investigation behind SCP-7163, and what Researcher Okorie had been doing to investigate this anomaly.",
        "Addendum 7163.5: Interview 7163.1\nThe following is a transcript of an interview between Chief Delfina Ibanez and SCP-7163 on 2021/11/30. This interview was made possible through the usage of Telescribe 3 technology. This interview was established to further understand SCP-7163\u2019s capabilities, and to determine the creator of the anomaly. Chief Ibanez was contacted by SCP-7163, and once she reached its chamber she conducted an impromptu interview, which has been transcribed below.",
        "Addendum 7163.6: Interview 7163.2\nThe following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. Okorie and SCP-7163 on 2022/12/15. This interview reveals a few important pieces of information about the creator of SCP-7163, and details about the exact purpose behind the object."

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-7163 is kept on a pedestal and is housed in the Applied Occultism Section. Due to its extreme durability and ability to withstand almost any form of damage, SCP-7163 does not need to be maintained regularly. Whenever its anomalous effects occur, affected personnel must inform the head of Applied Occultism of the exact advice given by SCP-7163. Currently, SCP-7163 is under the supervision of Dougall Deering Udo Okorie.",
    "description": "SCP-7163 is a frog sculpture constructed of sand. The frog is depicted sitting on a rock, and its forelegs are crossed. The sculpture is remarkably resistant to nearly all forms of damage, including extreme environmental conditions. SCP-7163 can be preserved for an exceedingly prolonged period of time, potentially indefinitely. Carved into the back of the sculpture is the English sentence \u201cI Will Be Here Whenever You Need Me The Most.\u201d",
