Attempts to locate the source of SCP-5149 have been inconclusive, though it has been ascertained that the signal is coming from outside the Solar System.\n\n\nSCP-5149 consists of a short repeating message in UTF-8. The message is constructed of a series of forty-four dots laid out in a complex position pattern, interspersed with empty space in certain locations. Due to the extrasolar nature of SCP-5149's origin, this is believed to be an extraterrestrial communication or language system. At the moment, decryption of SCP-5149 is considered a Class-A priority; a team of cryptographers, linguists, and radio technicians are stationed at Lunar Site-34 for this purpose.\n\n\nAttempt Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt #\n\n\nDate\n\n\nComment\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.30.14\n\n\nRan it through all modern language translation systems for similarities.
