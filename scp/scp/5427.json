During the phenomenon a thick fog with no apparent cause will form around the edge of the coastline in the region; at the same time the coastal tide will intensify greatly, producing waves reaching heights of up to 300 meters despite no geological support for such tides. The resulting 'storm' may last anywhere between a few hours and 3 weeks and will deposit vast amounts of pure chalk sediment onto the coastline which will in turn quickly solidify and merge with the existing cliff-face. Due to this the coastline in the region expands at an extremely-high rate of 20-40 meters per month; if the phenomenon is allowed to occur uninterruptedly, only the forward facing/original cliffs will be affected. This produces a narrow land bridge growing directly toward Calais, France.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nAnnual Archive of SCP-5427 activity and its effects\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01951:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 26 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01952:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 32 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01953:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 30 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01954:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 24 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01955:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 32 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01956:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 39 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01957:\n Slight alteration to usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 60 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n Increase of activity, corrosion efforts paused for one week to allow for observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01958:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 67 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n Activity has stayed at a higher rate than previous years for the last twelve months -adopted as new norm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01959:\n No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 70 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation Report Jan 1\u00a01960:\n Major change to occurrence and effects.\n\n\nExpansion before operation:\n 0 meters.\n\n\nNotes:\n Steady decrease in average activity along the coastline over the last few weeks, major increase in one section of the coastline but with little to no expansion toward sea.
