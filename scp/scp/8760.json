The only entrance to the area is a hermetically sealed door comprised of the same specialised materials. It should only be opened to provide SCP-8760 with radioactive fuel, and for cleaning as ordered by the Project Head.\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s containment wing and the chamber holding the anomaly have been equipped with liquid nitrogen pump units on the ceiling. These countermeasures will incapacitate the anomaly and allow for safe transportation for up to 45 minutes. A small detachment of Mobile Task Force Nu-7 has been assigned to aid site security with containment, due to the lack of resources and training standard security personnel possess. See Addendum 1 \u2013 Ethics Committee Report.\n\n\nAll waste products are to be cleared daily, with two hours minimum being provided for the entity to prepare itself.\n\n\nAny colour changes that persist longer than 30 minutes are to be reported immediately.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8760 is a sapient humanoid 1.7 meters in height, comprised of various hazardous inorganic materials. Internal temperatures range between 1,500 and 11,000 Kelvin depending on materials the entity has access to. These materials cause SCP-8760 to emit radioactive alpha particles 6 hours after any material consumption. This is believed to be achieved via internal nuclear fission. External temperatures can vary between 300 and 3,000 Kelvin depending on the anomaly\u2019s stress level.\n\n\nSCP-8760 appears to follow the standard life cycle of a star, albeit at a vastly accelerated rate. The anomaly is believed to be in the \u201cwhite dwarf\u201d stage of its life cycle. It is unknown how the anomaly may progress, but efforts are being made to ensure that SCP-8760 does not become any form of supernovae following its death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe planet believed to have orbited SCP-8760's 'mother' star after it was damaged following a supernova event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8760 utilizes combustible or radioactive materials to achieve its fission process, which allows it to restore or alter damaged parts of its body, and to control its stress.\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s body is formed of varying layers:\n\n\n\u2022 The core that holds SCP-8760\u2019s body together is located in the stomach region.\n\n\n\u2022 The second layer of SCP-8760 is composed of magma.\n\n\n\u2022 The third layer is composed of flames and plasma.\n\n\n\u2022 SCP-8760\u2019s fourth layer is composed of a dark chondrite shell.\n\n\nThe head is a constantly burning flame, with a thin layer of its shell forming its face and two eye holes.\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames may change colour depending on its stress level.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1 - Ethics Committee Report:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation of Staff Conduct\n\n\nDate:\n 17/02/2017\n\n\nItem:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nStaff Under Caution:\n Level 3 Researcher Dr. Ethan Hayes\n\n\nEthics Committee Liaison:\n Marshall Graham\n\n\nIncident:\n During an extended period of inactivity and isolation under Dr. Hayes\u2019 care, SCP-8760 displayed significant emotional distress due to the conditions of its containment.\n\n\nDuring the first few weeks, SCP-8760 was not provided with the necessary materials to sustain itself.\n\n\nDuring the second month of containment, Dr. Hayes reportedly used the liquid nitrogen countermeasures without proper authorization to intentionally trigger SCP-8760, resulting in several staff fatalities, severe injury to the anomaly itself, and extreme damage to the site.\n\n\nFor approximately 30 minutes after this incident, SCP-8760 was in a state of emotional distress whilst attempting to destroy its containment chamber and engaging in self-harming behaviours.\n\n\nSCP-8760 was incapacitated for several days following this incident due to the combination of damage from Dr. Hayes' actions and its own self-inflicted harm.\n\n\nSite Director Carter reported the incident, and has denied any knowledge of the records kept by Dr. Hayes until they were disclosed to him by Dr. Iya Keina. He insisted that he would have never authorized the previous experiments if he had known Dr. Hayes\u2019 intentions.\n\n\n\n\nAction:\n Following a review by the Ethics Committee, Dr. Keina will be assigned to replace Dr. Hayes. Further, Dr. Hayes was demoted to D-Class pending termination and is undergoing treatment due to radiation poisoning after sustained contact with SCP-8760 during a meltdown event. His duties will start once he has recovered.\n\n\nSite Director Carter has been issued a formal warning by the Ethics Committee for authorizing the previous experiments and failing to maintain the Foundation Code of Ethics within Site-44.\n\n\nAll personnel assigned to work with SCP-8760 directly must be female and be under the age of 35 to avoid all resemblance with Dr. Hayes. This is subject to change should SCP-8760 show emotional improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-01\n\n\nDate:\n 07/08/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 11:45 AM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nForeword:\n Due to the current status of the anomaly, a heat-resistant barrier was temporarily installed in SCP-8760\u2019s containment chamber so Dr. Keina may communicate with it in person without risking injury. SCP-8760 was given an hour beforehand to prepare itself.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Good morning. I\u2019m Doctor Iya Keina, I hope you\u2019re feeling all right today.\n\n\nSCP-8760 does not respond.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Hello?\n\n\nSCP-8760 does not respond. Dr. Keina folds her arms, leans to the side, and proceeds to knock on the glass.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I understand you may feel overwhelmed with everything that\u2019s happened recently, but would it be alright if we just had a quick chat?\n\n\nSCP-8760 sits down next to the wall of its containment chamber, staring directly at Dr. Keina with no aversion, and with the segments of its shell locking together. A few small chunks crack and break off of SCP-8760 in the process.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Go away.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I appreciate that you don\u2019t know me, and that you probably think I\u2019m here to harm you, but I promise that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n As if you could be any better\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about him, and I don\u2019t want to speak with you. So go away already.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Do I really look that shady?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You dress like him\u2026What impression was I supposed to have?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n May I at least have one chance? Please let me explain myself, and if you still aren\u2019t interested, I\u2019ll be out of your hair\u2026 Well, out of your flames.\n\n\nSeveral seconds of silence pass between both Dr. Keina and SCP-8760 as Dr. Keina clears her throat and fixes her ponytail. SCP-8760 still does not look away.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m the new researcher who\u2019ll be working with you. I\u2019m a psychiatrist specifically\u2026 I brought you something to hopefully start us off on a good note.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n A gift? So you\u2019re seriously going to try bribing me with flowers.\n\n\nDr. Keina places a small piece of uranium inside of the lead-lined port in the divider.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019d have brought you more, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m allowed to give until we make a bit of progress together. Site director\u2019s orders, not my own.\n\n\nSCP-8760 remains silent for a few minutes as it picks up the uranium and quickly places it inside its stomach region. It maintains its line of sight on Dr. Keina.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Slow down, no one\u2019s taking it from you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m starving.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Sorry\u2026 It\u2019s a common joke where I\u2019m from, figured it\u2019d lift the mood a bit. I won\u2019t do that again if it doesn\u2019t help.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What do you want if I\u2019m not going to starve with you taking \"care\" of me? If you\u2019re so kind why not just let me leave?\n\n\nDr. Keina goes silent briefly, shuffling her paperwork and clearing her throat.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well the first thing on my agenda was to get some food in you. I would happily give you more, but it took three strongly-worded emails to just get you that little bit of food. Or fuel, whichever is more accurate.\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for several moments, before turning its head to face away from Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Give me more.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well\u2026 I\u2019d like to, but I have nothing else to give you-\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames briefly intensify following Dr. Keina\u2019s comment, as well as its shell chipping once again.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You go and get more! I\u2019ve been starving here for weeks! A fucking scrap can\u2019t fix that!\n\n\nDr. Keina falls silent for a few moments, with her expression morphing into a stern glare.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m trying to be nice because of what you\u2019ve been through, but please don\u2019t speak to me like that. If you want more, then you\u2019ll show me basic respect, at the bare minimum. I want to help you but I am not tolerating that kind of attitude.\n\n\nSCP-8760 gestures to the damage across its shell, particularly a large crack running down the side of its face.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m fucking starving! Do you not believe me or something? Where\u2019s your compassion?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Again, respect will get you much farther with me than trying to manipulate me. That kind of attitude reminds me of Hayes himself, and neither of us would want that.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Come on! How are we supposed to trust each other if you don\u2019t?\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames intensify as the entity expels some magma from its hands onto the chamber floor. Dr. Keina doesn\u2019t respond for a few moments.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n As for you starving, I\u2019ll make sure you get something to eat daily. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that I can\u2019t pull some out of thin air. Unless you want to eat my clipboard\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for a few moments whilst its flames die down once again.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Alright. I\u2019ll take that for now.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n \u2026 Oh. Of course you will.\n\n\nDr. Keina reluctantly places her clipboard through the port. Dr. Keina then proceeds to exit the room for a few minutes as she goes to speak with Director Carter to acquire more fuel, returning soon after with a more reassuring tone.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n There we are. May I ask you a question now?\n\n\nDr. Keina throws another piece of uranium to SCP-8760.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 What do you want?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I want to know how you feel. With everything that happened, it\u2019s important to understand so I can help you properly.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at the materials Dr. Keina brought into the room for several moments.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Why would I ever tell you that?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Because if I can\u2019t prove you want to help yourself, the Site Director won\u2019t waste materials to help at all. For me to help you as best as I can, you\u2019ll need to work with me.\n\n\nSCP-8760 doesn\u2019t respond for several moments.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I don\u2019t want to play this card, truly, but I\u2019m the reason that Dr. Hayes even got transferred to begin with. Is it unrealistic that I\u2019m still just trying my best to help with these questions?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n The last man only ever used me for his entertainment and his stupid aspirations. I don\u2019t see what else you need to know, so take what you can get and fuck off.\n\n\nDr. Keina proceeds to throw another small piece of uranium into SCP-8760\u2019s side of the containment chamber.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s\u2026 better. May I ask another?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Fine.\n\n\nDr. Keina shuffles through her research papers for a moment.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n How do you feel about being here? In containment? I\u2019m sure there are some improvements we could look at to make you more comfortable.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I want to leave. This place is full of memories I don\u2019t like, and I find you cruel to keep me here.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well I\u2019ll have to be \u201ccruel\u201d for now, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019d be irresponsible at best to let you free right now, even if you\u2019re hurting inside of here.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You said you were the only one working with me. If you\u2019re in charge, why don\u2019t you just let me out?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Because the Ethics Committee doesn\u2019t deem you as being cooperative enough for that.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You could just do it anyways. I\u2019d like you for that\u2026 I\u2019d like you a lot\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Not falling for that. I\u2019m a psychiatrist, this isn\u2019t a game that you\u2019re going to win.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Can you please just open the door once? I wouldn\u2019t burn anything.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Friends don\u2019t act like this, y\u2019know.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Can I at least get a bed?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That you won\u2019t burn through? Probably not, but I could certainly try.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n A book?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Again, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d be able to hold it.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I can control my heat! You\u2019d know that if I didn\u2019t have to pry a meal from everyone wearing a fucking lab coat.\n\n\nDr. Keina narrows her eyes at SCP-8760.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m not saying no, but how about we get you properly settled in before we do so? I wouldn\u2019t want people thinking you\u2019re ungrateful because you accidentally burned something. Can I ask another question?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Fine.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Appreciated\u2026 How do you feel about Dr. Hayes?\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames intensify.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I want him without those men with guns around\u2026 Without those stupid things on the ceiling to protect him\u2026 I want to hurt him. He deserves to see his opinions about me be true.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You want to prove you\u2019re what he says you are? I understand wanting to hurt him, he hurt you after all, but harming him would only prove to others that he was right. I believe you\u2019ve seen how that can go if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n How would it? He earned it, so it\u2019s his fault for whatever I do.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Yet without the context, you\u2019d simply have killed a man. Is that feeling of satisfaction you\u2019d have in passing worth the reputation you\u2019d have earned as a reward?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I need to be sure that he\u2019s dead. If he isn\u2019t then how will anyone else ever be safe? How can I believe I\u2019ll be safe with you if people like him just get away with all this shit?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n He\u2019s only one man, you know. No two people are the same, and I believe after enough time with me you\u2019ll see it. It\u2019s awful what he did to you, and he deserves nothing good for that. I would even agree if you had killed him in the moment then you wouldn't be wrong, but seeking revenge would only give others the illusion that he was right about you.\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames begin to turn blue and intensify further. The anomaly stands to its feet and approaches Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n So let them fucking have that idea. If I\u2019ll never get the justice that I\u2019ve earned for the pain I\u2019ve been through, then what\u2019s the point of waiting for it? What\u2019s the point of living?! I should give it up and bring all of you with me for allowing this shit!\n\n\nDr. Keina is silent for several moments, only looking at SCP-8760 with a concerned expression.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That wouldn\u2019t solve your problems the way you think it will, and I don't think that's what you want. If you essentially kill yourself, and everything on the planet, then all of that suffering would be for nothing. You would have thrown your chance at a better life away just for revenge, and you would have done so without even giving yourself a chance to see there\u2019s better for you in this world.\n\n\nBoth SCP-8760 and Dr. Keina go silent for a few minutes. Dr. Keina stands patiently whilst SCP-8760 slowly calms itself down and backs away into the corner.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t m-mean that. Please don\u2019t hurt me for that! I just wanted someone to listen\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I think you did mean it, but I\u2019m not going to punish you for how you feel.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It\u2019s just\u2026 It isn\u2019t fair! Why do I suffer and he gets nothing in return?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I doubt that he\u2019ll get away with it. I\u2019d distract yourself if you think about him again. Your emotions need to be addressed soon, but in your current state, I\u2019m worried that you might be pushed too far if we tried today.\n\n\nDr. Keina throws another piece of uranium through the divider.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I think you\u2019ve had enough of my questions for today. I\u2019ll come and see you soon though, promise.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Bring food.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I will\u2026 Goodbye.\n\n\nDr. Keina exits the containment chamber. SCP-8760 doesn\u2019t respond.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Following this interview, I\u2019ve decided to have the staff provide SCP-8760 with 5 kilograms of uranium per day. I hope that this will encourage them to converse with me more in our next meeting, allow them to repair the damage present on their body, and build our trust. I plan to see SCP-8760 at least once per week, though I will have my team do daily check-ins with SCP-8760 until further notice.\n\n\n- Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Summary Log \u2013 01\n\n\nDate:\n 04/10/2017\n\n\nActivity:\n Dr. Keina supplied SCP-8760 with four different radioactive materials it may consume to determine its meal preference, hoping to build some trust between herself and SCP-8760. The materials provided were 1 kilogram each of uranium, radium, iodine, and polonium.\n\n\nAfter several hours of hesitation towards Dr. Keina\u2019s gesture, SCP-8760 consumed all materials provided, before specifying uranium as its preferred source of energy.\n\n\nSCP-8760 was less aggressive in the interview that followed later that day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-04\n\n\nDate:\n 18/10/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 1:00 PM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-8760 was given an hour in advance to prepare itself for the interview. SCP-8760 requested to be given its full supply of food for the day in advance. Dr. Keina granted this request.\n\n\n\n\nBegin Log\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Good afternoon. You look a bit healthier than last time, though not that you looked bad before.\n\n\nSCP-8760 doesn\u2019t respond for a few seconds whilst staring at Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Thanks.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ve got a few things I wanted to talk about today, you can feel free to refuse any if you aren\u2019t ready.\n\n\nSCP-8760 goes silent for a few moments, staring at Dr. Keina as it waits for her to elaborate.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Firstly was to talk some more about Dr. Hayes\u2026 You\u2019re looking at me like it\u2019s a no.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Gotcha. Okay, well how about telling me a bit about yourself? We didn\u2019t get too far last time, so maybe start simple and see how we go.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Fine. Just don\u2019t\u2026 Just don\u2019t push it.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n No problem. Can you tell me a little bit about where you\u2019re from?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Space.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Right\u2026 Might you be more specific?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Is this an interview or a fucking interrogation? A star died, and then I existed after that.\n\n\nDr. Keina stares at SCP-8760 with her head tilted, her brow raised and arms folded over her chest.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n So a supernova created you?\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at Dr. Keina in silence for a few moments.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n If that\u2019s what it\u2019s called.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s quite beautiful in a way\u2026 Is there anything else? Or is that all, up until you got to Earth?\n\n\nSCP-8760 pauses momentarily, looking to the far wall of the containment chamber and moving to face away from Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I floated for a while to get here, if that interests you. I think you already know what happened when I got here, since you humans write everything down\u2026 and it was your fault.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Mhm, mhm. Yes we do, so please carry on if you feel comfortable. I suspect something else happened other than just \u201cfloating\u201d.\n\n\nSCP-8760 once again pauses for several seconds.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n There's no rush; I\u2019m not forcing you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n When stars die, something like me has a small chance of being made just before they explode\u2026 Something alive. When something like me is made, and then dies, it\u2019s guaranteed that another one will appear soon before their death. My first\u2026 memory, was seeing a planet die so I could live.\n\n\nDr. Keina looks at SCP-8760 with her brows raised.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n And how does that make you feel? Did you understand what you were seeing?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No, I didn\u2019t know. Then I got here and began to understand what I\u2019m going to be in the future. I learned what was lost just so I of all things could live\u2026 All that ever happens to me is I suffer, then I get that little bit weaker, and I\u2019ll eventually just die regardless, so why did all those lives have to end for me? I wish I lived in ignorance of it all\u2026 Or just didn\u2019t live at all, both would be the most mercy I\u2019ve had.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m guessing that mindset is quite strong for you, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nSCP-8760 doesn\u2019t respond vocally but does nod whilst looking at the floor. The entity is observed clutching its wrist tightly.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I also take it what happened with, well\u2026 him, hasn\u2019t exactly made you confident that you can change?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Yes\u2026 I hate that he could have been right. I hate how I gave in to his stupid fucking plan! I hate that I let myself hurt people just because of him!\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Is there anything I can do to help you cope?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Bring me more food and leave me alone. I could start to repair myself. At least then I can keep myself from killing you all so soon\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2026 will take that as kindness and not a threat. I\u2019ll up your supply the best I can, though if you still have some resolve, I can offer you something else too.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What is it? Another \u201cshower\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-8760 looks up to the ceiling for a few moments whilst gripping its thigh. The glow from its plasma underneath is visible through the newly formed cracks.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n No, it\u2019s something called \u201ctherapy\u201d. I can help you change the way you think, the way you react to your thoughts, and teach you how to manage your emotions. You might also learn that people aren\u2019t so bad. Most of them, anyways\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n And that actually works? Even if I\u2019m not a person?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Human. You\u2019re not a human, but you are still a person. And yes, it could work, and even if it doesn\u2019t, it has to be better than just letting yourself go right? If you only get to live one time why give it up?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n That has some sense in it, I guess.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Is that a yes?\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for a few seconds, before folding its arms and looking away.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Yes\u2026 I\u2019ll try.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s great to hear! I\u2019m glad you haven\u2019t given up completely, that\u2019s already a good place to start from. Much better than not even wanting to try.\n\n\nDr. Keina stands and gathers her things, then proceeds to walk towards the exit. SCP-8760 lunges up to the divider.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Wait-\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Hm? Did you need something before I go?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 When are you coming back?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019ll be back in a week, maybe sooner if the Site Director would care to read his emails this time.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Oh, well\u2026 right. Well go on then, l-leave.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n \u2026 Goodbye.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n I\u2019ve decided to increase the supply SCP-8760 gets per day, to assist with the physical healing process, and hopefully ease their stress as best as possible before starting therapy. I think I might ask them to name themselves, maybe that will help break them from the ideas they currently put so much weight into.\n\n\nOh, and Director Carter, I\u2019m well aware of the concerns that SCP-8760 is just trying to get fuel so they can break out. I\u2019ll ask you to remember that I\u2019m a psychiatrist, and Site Director or not, I won\u2019t have my assessment undermined because you don\u2019t care to listen to my briefings. Thank you.\n\n\n-Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Summary Log \u2013 02\n\n\nDate:\n 27/10/2017\n\n\nActivity:\n Dr. Keina showed SCP-8760 various illustrations of a \u201cCognitive Triangle\u201d, a diagram that displays how thoughts affect feelings, feelings affect behaviours, and how those behaviours reinforce thoughts.\n\n\nSCP-8760 didn\u2019t understand initially, but after the third attempt began to show comprehension of the subject. Dr. Keina proceeded to demonstrate some methods that could be used to interrupt certain stages of the cycle, thus improving the anomaly\u2019s ability to successfully manage its stress levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-05\n\n\nDate:\n 04/11/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 6:00 PM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-8760 was given the full supply of food for the day prior to the interview, and was given 30 minutes to prepare itself.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Good evening, SCP-8760. Had a good week?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It was okay. I found it was\u2026 too long to be with myself.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well, still an improvement over last week, right? Progress is progress, no matter how much. How\u2019s your body doing this week? Is the extra food helping with that?\n\n\nDr. Keina gestures towards SCP-8760\u2019s shell, which appears to have repaired itself somewhat.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It keeps the edge off my anxieties. Not for long, but\u2026 It helps.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re doing a bit better, at least. Now not to worry, but I\u2019ve got a few things I wanted to get through today\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Am I still allowed to say no?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Of course, but I\u2019d appreciate you giving it a try first.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What\u2019s on your list then?\n\n\nDr. Keina sits down in a chair that was placed inside the containment chamber and places her bag down at her side.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n So, to start our session today, I was thinking\u2026 Why don\u2019t we give you a name?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What would be the point?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You could express yourself, and you also get the rare opportunity to actually pick your name. Most people don\u2019t get to, you know?\n\n\nSCP-8760 goes silent for a minute, tapping its fingers against the floor of the containment chamber and facing away from Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Nova\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s what you want to be called?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2026 think I like it. After what happened when I was born, the memory used to make me afraid. So maybe I could\u2026 make something positive out of it.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I think that\u2019s a very creative way of looking at it. It\u2019s much more fitting than I thought it\u2019d be\u2026 Far better than calling you a number at least.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Thank you\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina takes out her notebook from her bag and leans back in her chair with her legs crossed.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Next up, I wanted to talk more about Dr. Hayes. I know you\u2019re still very stressed over this, but if you want to see improvement, you\u2019ll have to get a little bit uncomfortable each time.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No\u2026 No, I don\u2019t-\n\n\nSCP-8760 sits down and starts tapping its hands against the floor, looking away from Dr. Keina.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know, I get it, I\u2019ve been there. I understand how overwhelming it can feel. But please just take a moment to try and relax. We can go at whatever pace is comfortable for you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Iya\u2026 I don\u2019t want to, so just drop it!\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Let\u2019s slow things down a bit. Relax, breathe, have a few minutes\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent while it clutches its wrists, and after a few minutes, it nods to Dr. Keina. The anomaly\u2019s flames have become a pale blue colour.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Good. It\u2019ll be fine, Nova, I assure you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Thank you, go uhm\u2026 ahead.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n If you remember the last time I asked about what you felt when I brought Dr. Hayes up, you expressed how you\u2019d kill him. Has your view on that changed?\n\n\nSCP-8760 slouches forward slightly and rests its face in its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Of course it fucking hasn\u2019t.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Right\u2026 May I propose a perspective to you?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You\u2019ll do it regardless\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n What do you think about the idea that as long as you let the thought of him get you so worked up, he still controls you just as much as he used to?\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames begin to turn yellow, though it only slouches more and breaks a small piece of its shell away from its wrist.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No he doesn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m choosing to kill him.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n But what\u2019s leveraging your decision? Your sound, calm and certain conscience? Or is it the emotions that are reasonable, given what\u2019s happened, but not always helpful in certain situations?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Well why does it matter? I\u2019m still choosing to kill him, so it\u2019s me either way.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I can see your process on that, but I\u2019m hoping to explain how although your feelings on the situation are valid, and they\u2019re important, giving them too much control can lead you in the wrong direction.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at Dr. Keina for several moments, curling in on itself.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It\u2019s not who I want to be\u2026 I\u2019m just afraid it\u2019s who I am anyway\u2026 How are you so\u2026 normal? If you\u2019ve had bad things happen to you, how are you even content with your life?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n No one is any one way by nature, Nova. You can always change for the better if you want it for yourself, and nothing else. Every day the things that have happened to me will affect me, but with a lot of effort, I\u2019ve managed to keep them from controlling my life constantly. I have bad days, and so will you, even with therapy.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Every time you say something like this it just seems so out of reach to actually accomplish it\u2026 Does anyone ever succeed at \u201ctherapy\u201d? Is it just something humans do to feel better about those around them, knowing that it\u2019s all just to cope? It seems to me that once you\u2019ve passed a line, you\u2019re just fucked and that\u2019s the end of it\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina shifts in her chair and leans forward to look at SCP-8760 closely.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n People can try to succeed, and some people fail. Others succeed easily, whilst some comparatively lose more than they started with. I couldn\u2019t tell you how things might work out, but I can tell you that your current outlook on the situation will only end one way\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 sits down on the floor, cross-legged with its chin resting in its hands.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n That\u2026 isn\u2019t very reassuring, given how hopeless it sounded.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I just want you to think about it once a day. With the right outlook, you could draw a lot of motivation from your emotions, instead of them getting you stuck. Now\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina reaches into her bag and retrieves a few sheets of paper, shuffling through them briefly.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n The next thing I\u2019d like us to do today was to have you look at some art. I think you might give some interesting insights with your reactions, and it might be less problematic for you to start with.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2026 Fine.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Great. Would you tell me how this makes you feel?\n\n\nDr. Keina holds an image of Mobile Task Force Nu-7\u2019s insignia and shows it to SCP-8760.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I don\u2019t like that\u2026 The people who had that were helping\u2026 him. It scares me.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Do you remember what I told you before about how no two people are the same? Those who wear this are a group, and although the individuals you knew before weren\u2019t great people, there are plenty of quality personalities amongst them.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I think I\u2019m starting to see where this is going.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Yes, I would like you to meet some. At the very least just be around them.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n That sounds very uncomfortable.\n\n\nDr. Keina\n Hear me out, okay? I want to take you out of your room in the future. For a walk in the courtyard, but the Site Director isn\u2019t negotiating about the guards. So, two of them have to come with us.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No, so you can fuck off, p-please\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova\u2026 Come on now, no need for that.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re moving very fast, okay?! I don\u2019t know if I can, and that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got for you right now. I know, such impressive progress!\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You don\u2019t have to do it so soon, I\u2019m only proposing the idea. It would help you get comfortable with stress; it would let you have more control than you normally would, and at the minimum, it would get you out of this boring and frankly depressing room.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I think I want several weeks\u2026 Please.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Take as much time as you want, just tell the security personnel and I\u2019ll come fetch you. I\u2019ll see you then.\n\n\nDr. Keina turns around and heads towards the exit of the containment chamber.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No-\n\n\nSCP-8760 stands quickly and attempts to walk after her, but is stopped by the divider. Dr. Keina turns and smiles softly\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n What? You okay?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Sorry. Just uhm\u2026 I\u2019m a bit jumpy because, you know, what we talked about. Bye\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Goodbye, Nova. I\u2019ll see you soon.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a request from Dr. Iya Keina to Marshall Graham, SCP-8760 has been recognized as compliant following an extended period of cooperation with staff, and in the future is to be treated as a Class-III (Compliant) anomaly per the Ethics Committee guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-08\n\n\nDate:\n 13/12/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 09:00 AM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nEscorts:\n Agent Ashley Morgan, Agent Mia Winters\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-8760 was given twice the normal amount of supplies before the interview and was given two hours to prepare itself. The interview log was recorded using the bodycams of the MTF Agents present. All personnel involved were instructed to wear standard winter clothing instead of their tactical uniforms to seem non-threatening to SCP-8760.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Who are they?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n This is Mia, and this is Ashley. They\u2019ll just be escorting us outside, making sure you\u2019ve got plenty of space and so forth.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Why can\u2019t you just do that? I only wanted you.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I understand that, but with them helping us out I can keep my focus on you. Not on all the doors I have to open, and coworkers I have to avoid.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Fine, but they don\u2019t interrupt\u2026 please.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I promise it\u2019ll be as if they aren\u2019t even there when you get used to them.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Okay\u2026\n\n\nAgents Morgan and Winters remove the divider from the containment chamber, allowing SCP-8760 to walk out with them.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Are you coming for a walk then, Nova?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Yes\u2026 Just preparing first.\n\n\nSCP-8760 then exits the containment chamber. Dr. Keina leads the group towards the site courtyard, whilst the agents follow behind them.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n It\u2019s a lot colder being stood next to you than I thought it\u2019d be\u2026 So, our usual check-in first. How are you getting on physically? Feeling better than last week, I hope?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Yes. My leg\u2019s a lot better than it was\u2026 with him. I still hurt myself a bit in the bad moments, I'm sorry.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n How often do you have these bad moments?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Every few days, sometimes more than that\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Is there anything in particular that causes you to feel like you have to do that? Is it about Dr. Hayes?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm, no it\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s that I don\u2019t like being alone\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You never mentioned that before. Well, if this goes well then maybe we can go for walks more often. You might meet some people, or I can come visit more often if that\u2019d help you out.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I would like that\u2026 the visits, I mean. We uh\u2026 can see about the other stuff.\n\n\nThe group reach the site courtyard, and Agent Morgan opens the door.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Come on, Nova. You\u2019ll like the fresh air, I imagine.\n\n\nSCP-8760 leans down and touches some snow with its hand, before quickly retracting it back.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Is something wrong?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Sorry. it\u2019s cold and it reminds me of\u2026 when he would hurt me.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m sorry that it brought up some bad memories, but I promise you that snow can\u2019t harm you. You\u2019ll melt it quickly if you want to, so feel free to do so as long as you don\u2019t push yourself too much.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n If you\u2019re letting me, then\u2026 I guess.\n\n\nSCP-8760\u2019s flames turn blue as the anomaly begins to melt the snow around the group. Though it soon starts to draw in it instead.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n See? All\u2019s fine, and you even seem to enjoy it. Very pretty, mind you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Thank you\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Anyways, for our work today, I wanted to let you lead a bit. Hopefully, you might build your confidence up.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Lead? Why? It\u2019s easier when you do it.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know it is, but it\u2019s an easy way of you taking some control in general, without having any pressure on you. So please, whenever you\u2019re ready, Nova.\n\n\nSCP-8760 looks at Dr. Keina for several moments, with its posture slightly slouched forward.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm, sometimes when I\u2019m alone, I\u2026 sometimes think about what he did to me. When he used those tools to hurt me\u2026 It feels like when I start I just can\u2019t get it out of my fucking head! I can only cope by hurting myself. I know that I shouldn\u2019t and that you wouldn\u2019t like it, but the pain takes my mind out of it.\n\n\nSCP-8760 looks down at its forearms, where several small chunks are missing. Dr. Keina is silent for a few moments whilst she sits down on a bench, and looks up at SCP-8760.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m not upset with you, though I am concerned. Since you aren\u2019t human and I can\u2019t medicate you, and I\u2019d be hesitant to even if I could, the best I can do right now is to come and see you more often. Maybe I\u2019ll see about changing my schedule so that you can request to see me then and there, as opposed to having to wait.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I think that would help\u2026 thank you.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m very proud of you, you know. Most people aren\u2019t so easily forthcoming with things like that.\n\n\nSCP-8760 briefly stops drawing in the snow and turns its head to look at Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n There\u2019s also something else that I\u2026 sometimes worry about.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Oh? What is it?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I sometimes worry that I might lose control of myself again and that I might accidentally hurt you\u2026 You\u2019ve been very kind to me and the thought of accidentally doing that makes me feel ill.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n If I thought you were dangerous you wouldn\u2019t be out of your room. I can see how you\u2019d be afraid of that, given what Hayes has made you do in the past, but I\u2019m taking care of you. Based on my admittedly loose knowledge about how you work, I think I\u2019ll be fine.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You always seem so calm about things\u2026 It\u2019s reassuring.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s because I\u2019m not stressed. I can see that although your concerns are valid, they aren\u2019t likely to ever happen. There\u2019s no reason for you to worry about it.\n\n\nSCP-8760 rests its face in its hands while its flames intensify slightly.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You make it sound very easy. How am I supposed to learn when my own thoughts are hurting me, whilst trying to protect me from something that apparently wouldn\u2019t happen?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well that\u2019s the unfortunate part. Forgive me for being blunt here, Nova, but you\u2019ll have to just put up with it whilst we do these therapy sessions. Unfortunately, catastrophic thoughts don\u2019t go away so easily, and realistically even if I reassure you that things will work out, you\u2019ll only believe me for so long. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve seen people have so many issues, and all of them only started to improve after they\u2019d experienced their problems long enough to see that regardless of what their mind tells them, their worries simply have not happened.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You\u2019re saying I just suffer, and eventually I might not suffer so badly?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know that it\u2019s not very encouraging, but I\u2019d only be harming you more if I sugar-coated it.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares down at the floor for a few minutes, then sits down on the floor next to Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I really appreciate how you, y\u2019know, have been patient with me. I know that at first I wasn\u2019t the kindest to you, and admittedly\u2026 I was very difficult. I\u2019m sorry, but I wanted to thank you. You\u2019ve given me a little bit of myself back and\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure how to say what I think about it.\n\n\nDr. Keina begins to smile midway through SCP-8760\u2019s speech.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well I\u2026 thank you. It feels great to know that all of this is having a positive impact on you, even if some aspects of that progress aren\u2019t so obvious. I\u2019m glad that you told me that, as now I\u2019m starting to think maybe you\u2019re improving much quicker than you might of thought.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at Dr. Keina for several moments.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m trying to smile at you. I don\u2019t think I can\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well I appreciate it nonetheless. Maybe now that you\u2019ve seen that I\u2019m not out to hurt you, we could introduce you to some other people, and see how that goes. Would you be up for that?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019ll agree, but please let me choose when\u2026 Like you did this time.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Of course, just shout and I\u2019ll come fetch you again.\n\n\nDr. Keina then stands up and looks at SCP-8760.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I think we\u2019ve done enough for today. We can stay out here for a bit if you like.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No, I feel much better than I did last night\u2026 I\u2019m ready to go back now, and I\u2019ve run out of snow anyway\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Sure thing. Come on then, Nova. Let\u2019s get you back to your room.\n\n\nThe group walk back to SCP-8760\u2019s containment chamber, and SCP-8760 steps inside.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Thank you for the walk\u2026 Bye Iya\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Goodbye, Nova. I\u2019ll come see you tomorrow, or maybe I\u2019ll even start coming here for my lunch breaks.\n\n\nSCP-8760 waves at Dr. Keina, before Agents Morgan and Winters close the containment chamber door.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-10\n\n\nDate:\n 28/12/2017\n\n\nTime:\n 1:00 AM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Keina was called into work following an incident involving SCP-8760, who refused to cooperate with security personnel and insisted on speaking to Dr. Keina alone. To avoid any further escalation, this request was granted.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Keina enters SCP-8760\u2019s containment chamber. Her eyes are narrowed at SCP-8760 and her lips pursed.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova? It\u2019s very late\u2026 Everything okay?\n\n\nSCP-8760 is in the corner of the containment chamber, tucking into itself and scorching the floor beneath it.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n What did you need so late at night?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I got stressed and I s-started thinking about him- And they started telling me I had to c-calm down, but I can\u2019t calm down and they didn\u2019t want to listen when I asked for you-\n\n\nDr. Keina puts her hand up towards SCP-8760.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova\u2026 Take some breaths, and slow down. I can\u2019t understand you when you\u2019re hyperventilating.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at Dr. Keina for several moments before curling up further and breathing heavily for a few minutes. Dr. Keina waits quietly for a few minutes.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Right, doing great, Nova\u2026 Just keep breathing, whatever\u2019s stressing you out, I\u2019m going to help you with it\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for a few more minutes before it crawls towards Dr. Keina and sits beside her.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been having a shit night and\u2026 I can\u2019t stop obsessing over everything that\u2019s happened and it\u2019s driving me fucking crazy.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Just\u2026 Settle down. You know me. I wouldn\u2019t just take the word of my coworkers as fact without asking you your side of things first. So, what happened?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2026 I got stressed like I said, and I started to\u2026 break some of my shell off. The people outside started telling me to stop but I couldn\u2019t stop and then they started yelling, and it reminded me of him so I may have broke too much off-\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n What do you mean you broke too much? What exactly did you break?\n\n\nSCP-8760 goes silent for a few moments, then gestures towards its thigh. The outer shell is completely missing, exposing the flowing magma underneath.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Don\u2019t yell\u2026 Please.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova, I\u2019m not going to get angry, but this isn\u2019t a good thing. Did you try to do what we\u2019ve been learning before you did this?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n They didn\u2019t give me a chance! They said if I didn\u2019t calm down, they would freeze me again\u2026 like before.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n They shouldn\u2019t have said that while you were stressed, but you know that not everyone will listen when you tell them\u2026 Are you alright physically? Do you need anything?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No\u2026 I\u2019m not supposed to have anything right now.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Says who? If you want something, then I\u2019ll get it. Your needs aren\u2019t up for debate, Nova.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Sorry\u2026 it\u2019s just an old habit saying that\u2026 I want food but I also don\u2019t want you to leave\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Right\u2026 Well in that case, would you like to talk about why you\u2019ve done this?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Because of him\u2026 Why else do I do anything?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Oh dear, Nova\u2026 Is this going to stress you out more? If so, I think it needs to wait, given what\u2019s already happened tonight.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I swear I\u2019ll be fine! I just need to tell someone so I can get it out of my fucking head\u2026 Or at least not seem so stupid for worrying\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina raises a brow at SCP-8760 with a tilt of her head, before sitting down on the floor beside it and folding her arms.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Alright\u2026 Go ahead.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Right\u2026 Okay\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for a few moments whilst it tucks into itself beside Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n From the first time he saw me he would always be so kind and empathetic\u2026 He\u2019d listen to me, ask how I was doing since he last saw me, always praising everything I did\u2026 Everything he wanted me to do. At first, I believed him. I thought he meant the things he said, but then I learned he only meant what he said when no one else heard him\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina smiles softly at SCP-8760 and places her hand on its shoulder, but doesn\u2019t speak.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n He came into my room after I didn\u2019t do what he asked one day, and just stood there for a bit\u2026 I expected him to praise me like he usually did, though when I tried to speak, he hurt me with those things on the ceiling\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 looks at the injured part of its thigh briefly, then to Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n He said that he\u2019d missed some opportunity because of me fucking up, and how I\u2019d have to compensate him for the problems I caused\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You don\u2019t have to continue if you don\u2019t want to. This is all you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2026 want to keep going. Hiding from it won\u2019t fix anything\u2026 Every week after that, he\u2019d keep expecting more and more from me, and every time I failed, he would find a new way to hurt me\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 is briefly silent again.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Anything from freezing me, to the acid, or if I really fucked it all up he\u2019d bring out tools and-\n\n\nDr. Keina's face contorts slightly as she clasps her hands together.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova, I\u2019m very sorry to stop you, but I\u2019m\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina rubs her eyes and takes a few deep breaths.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Actually, just continue if you're comfortable.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Sorry, it\u2019s just that talking out loud helps me to understand things\u2026 I still can\u2019t understand why he did any of that to me\u2026 I never hurt anybody before he knew me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova, in all honesty, no one ever did understand why he did the things that he did. Most of us never even knew he was like that, to begin with\u2026 To the outside world people like him are exceptional at appearing normal, keeping their motivations out of your sight and using you for them.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Then how did you figure out he wasn\u2019t right\u2026? How do I know that other people won\u2019t just be the same?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Because I didn\u2019t know, Nova. I noticed some records weren\u2019t around when they should\u2019ve been, and so I asked him. You know where that conversation ended up?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Where?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n With me dragged into his office, his hand around my neck, and him making every possible threat he could. People like that try forcing you into things when they can\u2019t manipulate you into them. He tried it on me, and although it\u2026 caused some issues later, I overcame those feelings of anxiety eventually\u2026 To some extent.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stares at Dr. Keina for a few moments whilst tilting its head.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You usually have some deeper meaning when you say something like that\u2026 So what was that one?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That in reality he has no power now. He had plenty when he abused you, and he had plenty when he got into it with me. In the present, however, he\u2019s got nothing left\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina yawns and stretches her arms out.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n The lesson, If I can come up with one at this time of night, is that you shouldn\u2019t believe that he can do what he\u2019s done again. Being afraid of what\u2019s already happened makes perfect sense, though logically, he won\u2019t ever be doing it again. Why scare yourself even more about the possibilities of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Because my brain won\u2019t let me believe that he can\u2019t, even if it\u2019s irrational\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Key word is \u201cirrational\u201d, Nova. As worried as you might get over it, it likely won\u2019t happen\u2026 Few people are like him, though it is unfortunate how hard it is to see anything but them\u2026 Anyway, he\u2019s a prisoner now. He couldn\u2019t get to you regardless of how hard he tried.\n\n\nSCP-8760 is silent for a few moments and tilts its head at Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n So you\u2019re protecting me?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2026 If that\u2019s how you want to look at things Nova, then fine. I\u2019m protecting you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Why were you so hesitant to say that? I feel much safer after hearing it.\n\n\nDr. Keina pinches the bridge of her nose, smiling slightly towards SCP-8760 as she places her hand on its back.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Because me reassuring you isn\u2019t good for your therapy, but I\u2019ll let you off with it, just for tonight\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Can\u2019t you do this every night?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Are you going to be reimbursing my wages for the overtime?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What is \u201creimbursing\u201d?\n\n\nBoth Dr. Keina and SCP-8760 are silent for several seconds.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Just go to sleep.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-11\n\n\nDate:\n 06/01/2018\n\n\nTime:\n 10:00 AM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Keina insisted on checking in with SCP-8760 after a previous incident, despite being informed it was likely unnecessary by her team.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Keina enters SCP-8760\u2019s containment chamber, yawning whilst tying her hair back.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You look tired\u2026 Sorry about the other night.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You know it\u2019s fine, Nova\u2026 Just a light session for today though, given what happened.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Okay. So, what are we going to chat about?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I wanted to talk about how you seem to prefer me over everyone else. I get it, but you need to give other people a chance at least.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n But you\u2019re nice\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know I am, but other people are nice too, you know this.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n You\u2019ve been the nicest to me, though\u2026 Everyone always wanted something from me before you became my friend.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I appreciate that\u2019s true, and whilst you being so\u2026 content with just me is nice, you could benefit even more if you got to know some other people.\n\n\nSCP-8760 cocks its head to the side and folds its arms.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No? I\u2019ve said it before, but you\u2019ve been so kind when everyone else just wasn\u2019t\u2026 I want you to be my friend. Everyone else just seems like him.\n\n\nDr. Keina stares at SCP-8760 for several moments with her eyes narrowed and a soft smile.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m\u2026 flattered, really, but you should-\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n No.\n\n\nDr. Keina covers her mouth with her hands and laughs slightly.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You aren\u2019t budging, are you?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Mhm, mhm.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Okay. Would you be comfortable to talk about what you did the other day? When you hurt yourself?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm, yes? I know you won\u2019t be mad, at least\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m glad you understand that. Can you tell me what people did when you started getting upset?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n They said I had to just \u201ccalm down\u201d! It\u2019s not that easy! The only person who listened to me was Ashley, and then she called you\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m glad at least two people did the right thing that night. Did she do anything to help whilst you were waiting?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n She gave me some food, but she wouldn\u2019t sit with me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Did you find that it helped quickly? Is it more gradual?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Quickly. You were the main thing that helped, though.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know, Nova. You know that if you feel that way again, I\u2019d rather you damage your room rather than yourself. I\u2019ll make sure the staff get the proper briefings on your behaviour.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Can\u2019t I go for a walk when I get stressed? I\u2019d like that more than breaking things\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Are you going to be alright walking without me? I\u2019m not always at work, you know.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm\u2026 Ashley\u2019s quite nice, so\u2026 maybe?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well, maybe, we should have you take a few short walks with her to get comfortable.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I think I could maybe manage that!\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Up for next week?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Mhm, mhm.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Great. I\u2019d stay and chat some more, but if I\u2019m being honest I'm\u2026 well, fucking shattered. I\u2019ll see you soon Nova.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Bye Iya!\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Nova\u2019s making progress, and although he seems to be holding onto a few bad habits, I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll work them out in time. I\u2019ll request to have Ashley granted the authority to just come and pick him up if he wants to go out for a bit. Hopefully with how things are going Carter will go with it.\n\n\n- Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log \u2013 SCP-8760-15\n\n\nDate:\n 17/02/2018\n\n\nTime:\n 9:00 PM\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-8760\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\nEscorts:\n Agent Ashley Morgan, Agent Mia Winters\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-8760 was escorted outside to the courtyard without Dr. Keina present.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Heya, Novae-\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Nova.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Was worth a try\u2026 Seriously though, how are you tonight? Are you doing okay?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019m doing good. My legs even healed!\n\n\nSCP-8760 gestures to its thighs that were previously damaged.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n That\u2019s lovely to see\u2026 Novae-\n\n\nSCP-8760 looks at Dr. Keina with a flat expression and folds its arms.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Funny. Amusing even. Now stop winding me up-\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Okay, okay I\u2019ll stop. Come on, sit down and we\u2019ll chat.\n\n\nSCP-8760 sits down on the floor in front of Dr. Keina with its back facing her.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I meant on the bench, but if you\u2019re comfortable down there, you be you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I wanted to draw.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n But there\u2019s no snow- and you\u2019re just scorching the ground, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t notice.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDr. Keina and SCP-8760 sit in silence for a minute whilst SCP-8760 burns the pavement, and Dr. Keina runs her hand over SCP-8760\u2019s head, with the flames fluttering around her fingers.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You know, we\u2019ve come a long way over the last couple of years. This is our final therapy session\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8760 tilts its head back to look up at Dr. Keina.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n What do you mean by \u201cfinal\u201d? What happens after?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Well, no more therapy. We\u2019ll still see each other often; it\u2019ll just be as friends.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Oh\u2026 that\u2019s fine then. That worried me for a minute\u2026 Asshole.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Sorry, Nova-\n\n\nSCP-8760 snaps its head back further to look at Dr. Keina whilst narrowing its eyes.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n See you thought I was going to say it again, didn\u2019t you?\n\n\nSCP-8760 folds its arms over its chest and attempts a British accent.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Arsehole.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Even stealing my curses, I\u2019m so proud. You're a bit high-pitched for our swears though.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2019ll burn you-\n\n\nDr. Keina gently turns SCP-8760\u2019s head back towards where it was drawing.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Shush. What\u2019ve you drawn?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Myself\u2026 I\u2019m quite beautiful, just can\u2019t use any colours besides black\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina looks down at the ground where SCP-8760 has been drawing. A 1:1 portrait of SCP-8760 has been burned into the ground.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Just like your favourite song, it is Beautiful. Get it?. If I knew how much you liked drawing, I'd have introduced it to you sooner.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I wouldn\u2019t want to change how things went anyway\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Is that so? Even the bad moments?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Mhm. They weren\u2019t fun, but they made me better in the end, so I\u2019m grateful to have had them.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Wow, not many people think about things that way\u2026 Shows how strong your resolve is, Nova. I\u2019m proud of you.\n\n\nDr. Keina smiles down at SCP-8760 and continues running her hand through the flames.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll burn you?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I wasn\u2019t afraid that you would burn me the first time we met. I\u2019m not going to get scared of you now.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n That\u2019s surprising\u2026 Most people said I was scary then.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n And now most people here like you. You were having a pretty good laugh with Ashley the other day, so I\u2019m told.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n She was on her break, so she came to sit with me for a bit. She brought me dinner after you fed me too.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Oh did she now? I\u2019ll let you off for once, as a little celebration of your accomplishments.\n\n\nSCP-8760 attempts to cross out its art on the pavement. Dr. Keina gently moves its hand away to stop it.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I don\u2019t think I deserve a celebration.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Nova, come on now, don\u2019t go down that route again.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n But I\u2019m broken\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You aren\u2019t \u201cbroken\u201d, just have a few lingering problems, but we can handle those at another time. I mean, think back to how you were in October! You\u2019re in a far better position than you were then, right?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I\u2026 Yeah, I am. I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m better.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n There you go, that\u2019s the right way to look at things. Even your bad moments have much quicker recoveries than they used to.\n\n\nDr. Keina and SCP-8760 sit quietly for several minutes whilst SCP-8760 draws, and Dr. Keina plays with its flames.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Can I ask you something?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n You know you don\u2019t have to ask permission for that right?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It\u2019s a habit!\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know, you\u2019re too polite not to. Go on then, Nova.\n\n\nSCP-8760 stops drawing and curls into itself slightly whilst leaning back.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm\u2026 What happens when you aren\u2019t here anymore?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-8760 pauses again.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Like when you\u2026 you d-die?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I don\u2019t\u2026 have an answer for you. No one knows what happens after they die. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be, if anywhere, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen to you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n That\u2019s not comforting\u2026\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n It\u2019s the truth though, Nova. Nobody finds that comforting.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n It\u2019s also not the answer I wanted.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I\u2019m only twenty-seven, Nova. I like to imagine I\u2019m not going anywhere soon. You should try not to imagine it either.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Do you know how hard it is to not worry about your friend?\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Yes, actually, because I do the same thing. Though my name isn't getting called for many more years, so you shouldn\u2019t spend the time we\u2019ve got to be friends worrying about when our time might run out.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n I know that you\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t feel any better hearing it\u2026 I wanted you to pander to me.\n\n\nDr. Keina rubs SCP-8760\u2019s shoulder with her hand slightly.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n It\u2019s a scary topic, and it's something no one likes to think about, Nova. Spending your life thinking things won\u2019t happen to people will only make it hurt more when it does. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that to you.\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n Uhm, thank you for doing what was right\u2026? I would feel better if you didn\u2019t, though\u2026 Sometimes I just want to be ignorant of some things so I can enjoy them.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n I know\u2026 We\u2019d all like to forget things, but we remember for a reason.\n\n\nDr. Keina and SCP-8760 are silent for a few moments.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Can I do something?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask\u201d, sure.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Ugh, so cheeky for no reason.\n\n\nDr. Keina leans forward and hugs SCP-8760. SCP-8760 puts its hands on her forearms and leans back slightly.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Do you feel better?\n\n\nSCP-8760:\n \u2026 Yes.\n\n\nDr. Keina:\n Good.\n\n\nSCP-8760 and Dr. Keina sit quietly for the rest of the session.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n I am not sure what I want to even write, in all honesty. Nova has made so much progress over the past year since I was first transferred to now, and seeing the difference is just too shocking for me to put on paper. He has not made a full recovery, and I think I want to keep these therapy sessions going so I can do my best for him. Though truthfully he did far more than I thought he would all that time ago.\n\n\nI am so proud.\n\n\n- Dr. Iya Keina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8759\n | SCP-8760 | \nSCP-8761\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8760\n\" by Enayy, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-8760 is contained in a specialised radiation-hardened humanoid containment chamber. The only entrance to the area is a hermetically sealed door comprised of the same specialised materials. It should only be opened to provide SCP-8760 with radioactive fuel, and for cleaning as ordered by the Project Head.",
    "description": "SCP-8760 is a sapient humanoid 1.7 meters in height, comprised of various hazardous inorganic materials. Internal temperatures range between 1,500 and 11,000 Kelvin depending on materials the entity has access to. These materials cause SCP-8760 to emit radioactive alpha particles 6 hours after any material consumption. This is believed to be achieved via internal nuclear fission. External temperatures can vary between 300 and 3,000 Kelvin depending on the anomaly\u2019s stress level.",
