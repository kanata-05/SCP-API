    "all_text": "Around 20 years ago, my dad bought a \nKomputer \u015awiat\n1\n magazine, which included a CD. From that CD, he installed a video game called \nWarblade\n.\n\n\nI still remember, when I was around nine, I saw him playing the game for the first time before I joined in.\n\n\nOver half a year ago, I reminded myself of the game and we came back to it.\n\n\nEven now, during my third year of college, I played the game during classes.\n\n\nWho could have thought such a simple game would bring so much joy both to me and my dad?\n\n\nI love you, Dad!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+4\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nDrzony13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR PAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8260\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nEuclid\n Neutralized\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n A webcrawler has been created in order to search for mentions of \nWarblade MK II\n and flag them for review. Every mention of the contents of SCP-8260 or download link to the game needs to be taken down.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8260 is an early test version of the video game, \nWarblade MK II\n, made in unity engine by Edgar M. Vigdal. The author shared the version on his \nblog on EMV Software Website\n as a test of the game's performance on various hardware setups.\n\n\nBefore it gained anomalous properties, the game would start with a low-quality main menu displaying a two-headed golden eagle. From there, the player could acces an unplayable level prototype and unusable level editor.\n\n\nHowever, since the object gained anomalous properties, the player is shown a message box on the black background after running the executable file. It is worth noting, that the test version does not have internet connection or remote access in any shape or form.\n\n\nThe message box is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\n\nLooks like your copy of the game is outdated! Would you like to update?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nNo, thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking the \"No, thanks!\" button, the player goes to the test version, which does not have any changes. However, after clicking \"Yes\", the game gets drastically modified. It is worh noting, that despite drastic changes in the contents of SCP-8260, none of the files get altered.\n\n\nThe game within SCP-8260 is a space shoot 'em up game, which is fundamentally the same, as \nWarblade\n.\n\n\nThe main gameplay consists of shooting bug-like aliens on top of the screen from a spaceship on the bottom. There are various items and bonuses dropping from aliens after they get shot.\n\n\nThere are exactly 100 levels in the game. Every twenty five levels, there is a boss battle against a giant spaceship.\n\n\nThere can be seen a significant improvement in the graphics and music of the game. However, most new features announced during the development of \nWarblade MK II\n were not included in SCP-8260.\n\n\nThere are minigames, which are the same, as in the original \nWarblade\n. The player enters them by picking up a bonus item. Those minigames are: Meteorstorm,\n2\n Memory Station\n3\n and Gem drop.\n4\n\n\nJust like in the original \nWarblade\n, there is no possibility of saving the progress of the game, thus forcing the player to start a new game each time they turn it on.\n\n\nAddendum 8260-1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgar Magne Vigdal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgar M. Vigdal was a Norwegian game developer and the founder of EMV Software.\n5\n\n\nVigdal was initially making shareware games for Commodore and Amiga before he moved to Microsoft Windows. His most notable work is \nWarblade\n, which gained him enough income to start making games full-time.\n\n\nIn 2007 Edgar M. Vigdal announced the development of a sequel to \nWarblade\n, which was called \nWarblade II\n and later renamed to \nWarblade MK II\n.\n\n\nOn August 16th, 2012, Vigdal published an early test version of \nWarblade MK II\n, which would later become SCP-8260.\n\n\nHowever, on April 1st, 2015, Edgar M. Vigdal passed away due to cancer, which was later announced by Simon Quincey\n6\n on the EMV Software website. Due to that reason, \nWarblade MK II\n was discontinued.\n\n\nShortly after Vigdal's death, EMV Software went out of business. The company website is still up, but doing any purchases from it is impossible. Download links for demo versions on the EMV Software website were hosted on \nwww.warblade.as\n, which was taken down.\n\n\nHowever, demo versions of the games can still be downloaded by entering download links to internet archive websites.\n7\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8260-2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery of the anomaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anomaly was discovered in August 2025, when Dr. Andrew Fitzgerald ran an early test version of \nWarblade MK II\n, which he already had on his computer.\n8\n After discovering SCP-8260, he quickly began his research.\n\n\nHe found gameplay footages of SCP-8260 on Youtube, along with a small number of posts on forums and community pages focused on \nWarblade\n,\n9\n regarding the contents of SCP-8260 with download links to the game. All of those were later taken down. Their uploaders and viewers were given class B amnestics, and copies of SCP-8260 were removed from their computers.\n\n\nThe first important discovery happened, when Dr. Fitsgerald entered the EMV Software website and found out it was updated on April 1st, 2025. The new post from the main page is displayed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARBLADE MK II IS OUT!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nTo everyone, who was waiting for the release of Warblade MK II throughout all those years, I have great news for you! Warblade MK II is finally out! Although I had some huge difficulties, I managed to get through it. Maybe I didn't manage to fullfill my full vision, but I am still happy with what I could pull off despite current conditions!\n\n\nOh, by the way! To anyone, who downloaded an early test version I posted in 2012, I have even better news! All of you receive a FREE UPDATE!\n\n\nIt was an incredible journey for me and I really hope the game will be worth all the wait you had to go through.\n\n\nIf anyone reads this, I really hope you enjoy. Thank you so much for your patience and playing my games. It really means a lot to me and I've already learned not to take it for granted.\n\n\n\n\n~Edgar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarblade MK II\n was added to the products page along with the demo. However, the download link for the demo is hosted on \nwww.warblade.as\n and an attempt to purchase the game is impossible to complete due to inactivity of EMV Software.\n\n\nAll former associates of EMV Software were contacted and none of them were aware of the update.\n\n\nAn IP address responsible for the website update was tracked down and it turned out to be located in Edgar M. Vigdal's house, which is currently resided by his family. Specifically, the device responsible for the update was Vigdal's computer, which had not been booted since its owner's passing. The Foundation revised the house and examined the computer. However, no files associated with SCP-8260 were found. Residents of the house were given class B amnestics.\n\n\nThe Foundation took down the update of EMV Software Website and reverted it to it's previous state. However, download links for an early test version of \nWarblade MK II\n were removed from Warblade MK II Blog.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8260-3:\n Notable differences between \nWarblade\n and SCP-8260:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Menu\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8260 has no main menu. Instead, the game starts immediately after executing the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTRA\n\n\n\n\nIn \nWarblade\n, the player is able to collect 5 letters, which together form a word \nEXTRA\n. After collecting all of them, the player gets an extra life.\n\n\nHowever, in SCP-8260, the letters are replaced with \nPNZHF\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\n\n\nIn \nWarblade\n, the player starts with an assigned rank: ENSIGN.\n\n\nThere are six balls dropped from bigger enemies. After collecting all of them, the player's rank gets increased by one degree.\n\n\nHowever, in SCP-8260, the player already starts with the highest rank. Now, collecting all of the balls decreases the player's rank by one degree. When all six are collected on a rank ENSIGN, the game crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifes\n\n\n\n\nIn SCP-8260, the game crashes after losing all lifes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutscenes\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8260 has cutscenes after start of the game and before each boss battle. All of them consist of white text on black screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels\n\n\n\n\nIn \nWarblade\n, each level starts with an introduction, shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\nLevel [NUMBER]\n\n[QUOTE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formula in SCP-8260 is the same. However, the quotes in the introductions are worth noting.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8260-5:\n Below is a list of all cutscenes and level introductions:\n\n\n\n\nOnce, there was a king.\n\n\nThe king ruled his own planet. It wasn't the size of Jupiter, nor was it a huge empire. It was even smaller than Pluto. Its size was more comparable to an asteroid.\n\n\nThe population was more of an average town on every other planet the king had been to. Around twenty to forty thousand citizens.\n\n\nHowever, the planet could never complain about poor living conditions. Every citizen could live in peace and prosperity. The intergalactic politics was perfect as well, so nobody ever had to fear any potential war.\n\n\nThe citizens loved their king and the king loved his citizens.\n\n\nThe king also had a good life. Not only he was happy as a king, but also a happy father. He lived a peaceful life with his wife and three sons.\n\n\nIt wasn't a lot, but it was his and he was incredibly proud of what he had accomplished. He loved doing what he was doing and he did everything he could to improve the kingdom each and every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 1\n\nHello!

He was hyperventilating and looking around in panic and confusion while hearing a loud, piercing noise from the outside.\n\n\nHe looked at his wife, who had also woken up. Then, his eyes turned to the window.\n\n\nHe was barely awake, but a few seconds later he sobered up a bit and realized, what was making the noise.\n\n\nIt was the only sound the king wished he would never have to hear in his life.\n\n\nHis heart stopped for a second.\n\n\nIt was an alarm siren.\n\n\nThe king immediately got up and ran up to the window upon realizing, what was happening. He opened the curtains and looked out the window. His heart was pounding and his breath was unsteady, while he was looking around. However, everything looked normal. \nFor now\u2026\n\n\nHis wife walked up to him.\n\n\n\u2013 Wh\u2013What's going on?\n\n\n\u2013 I don't know yet\u2026 \nBut I'm expecting the worst.\n\n\nHe rushed out of the room when he stumbled upon his sons in the corridor.\n\n\n\u2013 Dad, what is that?\n\n\n\u2013 Listen, everything will be okay.\n\n\nOf course, he was lying. He had no idea, how things will turn. He just wanted to calm his boys down.\n\n\nHe got dressed and ran to his office before the Minister of Defense barged in. He immediately provided all the information he had to the king.\n\n\nOf course, the planet was under attack. However, there was no military or space pirates. Instead, it was just one little spaceship.\n\n\n\u2013 Just one spaceship? \u2013 the king said. \u2013 That's it? Just shoot it!\n\n\nBut that was the problem. They not only were trying, but they did not stop. The ship was not only perfectly dodging all the bullets, but also managed to wipe out tens of soldiers and it did not seem to stop any time soon.\n\n\nThe king immediately declared martial law. The citizens were in panic, while the military kept fighting the mysterious spaceship. However, all the defense measures did not give any results.\n\n\nIf the king could, he would go to the front lines himself and fight to his death to defend his home and legacy. However, the kingdom still needed someone to rule the planet. Especially in such difficult times.\n\n\nAt some point, one of the king's sons decided to go and fight. He wanted to defend his home no matter what. Although the father did not like that idea, he respected his son's wish.\n\n\nThe prince hopped onto a giant spaceship and flew towards the only target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 25\n\n** BIG TROUBLE **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 26\n\nIt's really weird\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 27\n\nHow easy it is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 28\n\nTo just lose everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 29\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 30\n\nEverything you are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 31\n\nEverything you could have been\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 32\n\nAll gone now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 33\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 34\n\nAnd all that took\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 35\n\nWas one diagnosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 36\n\nTo shatter it all to pieces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 37\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 38\n\nThey say to never give up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 39\n\nBut what's the point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 40\n\nWhen you can die young\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 41\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 42\n\nYou don't know if it happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 43\n\nBut God forbid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 44\n\nIf it does\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 45\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 46\n\nNow all you ever did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 47\n\nEverything you accomplished\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 48\n\nIs forever forgotten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 49\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe funeral happened shortly after the prince's death. It was a big national tragedy perfectly capturing the horror of an ongoing war. Many people showed up, but after the funeral, the king was left alone. The only people who stayed were his wife and his two sons, who always were by his side. Saying, that the royal family was heartbroken would be an understatement.\n\n\nAfter a sleepless night, the king locked himself up in his office. He wouldn't let anyone in outside of the ministry of defense. He immediately launched an investigation against the mysterious spaceship. He wanted to know everything.\n\n\nWho controls the ship?\n\n\nWho sent them?\n\n\nWhat do they want?\n\n\nBut none of those questions were answered. There were negotiation attempts with the spaceship, but nobody from inside ever responded. They just kept going. They killed our soldiers. They slaughtered civilians. Men, women, and children. They kept bombing our land. There was no sign of stopping.\n\n\nWhat is especially weird, that's the fact, that nobody occupied destroyed lands. Nobody pillaged homes and other buildings from valuable items. It was just that one spaceship shooting everything on its sight without doing anything else.\n\n\nAfter some time, the king's second son barged into his father's office without permission.\n\n\n\u2013 Dad, I want to fight. I want to avenge my brother's death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 50\n\n** BIG TROUBLE **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 51\n\nYou pirated it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 52\n\nOf course you did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 53\n\nHow else would you play it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 54\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 55\n\nHonestly, it's only a matter of time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 56\n\nBefore even the pirate downloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 57\n\nFade away completely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 58\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 59\n\nSoon, no one will remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 60\n\nNo one will care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 61\n\nNo one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 62\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 63\n\nHave you ever walked down the graveyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 64\n\nAnd seen a tombstone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 65\n\nMarked as \"Unknown Soldier?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 66\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 67\n\nHave you ever feared\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 68\n\nThat some day you might be drafted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 69\n\nAnd end up in that exact grave?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 70\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 71\n\nBoth deaths in one day.

He did something, that he wished he would never have to do. But he did not have a choice.\n\n\nThe king signed general mobilization. The military started drafting civilians to fight the enemy. They needed as many people, as they possibly could.\n\n\nBut one day, something ironic happened.\n\n\nSomeone knocked at the royal family's door.\n\n\nIt was the commission.\n\n\nThe king's third son was drafted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 75\n\n** BIG TROUBLE **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 76\n\nMy rest in peace grandma always told me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 77\n\nYou will be great!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 78\n\nYou will do huge things!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 79\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 80\n\nYou will go far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 81\n\nI know you will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 82\n\nYou will be a big shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 83\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 84\n\nI'm so glad she's not there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 85\n\nTo see, what I have become\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 86\n\nTo see, how much I failed her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 87\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 88\n\nI always wished I could say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 89\n\nI have built a monument more lasting than bronze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 90\n\nWell too bad, now I'm here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 91\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 92\n\nThe monument was from iron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 93\n\nAnd just a little rain was enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 94\n\nBefore a small spot of rust appeared\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 95\n\nKAMIKAZE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 96\n\nThe rust quickly took over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 97\n\nNobody was around to prevent it from spreading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 98\n\nThe whole thing turned reddish brown, until it crumbled down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 99\n\nBONUS LEVEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sky is gray.

The only sound, that can be heard is a soft breeze blowing through the ruins of something, that used to be streets full of life. It used to be colorful and bright, but now it is in greyish vomit.\n\n\nThe king's hands are shaking as he finishes burying the fourth grave. There is nobody to help him out.\n\n\nThere lies the king's wife. She died in a bombing, alone in her living room, while mourning the death of her third son. With nobody by her side. Her husband, the only one she had left, who should have been there for her, was locked up in his office. He kept monitoring the situation and giving orders to his military.\n\n\nBut now?\n\n\nThere is nothing to monitor.\n\n\nNo orders to give.\n\n\nNo military to control.\n\n\nNo kingdom to rule.\n\n\nNo legacy to maintain.\n\n\nThe king clenches his teeth and his hands are shaking as he keeps staring at four graves. His wife, who he wanted to live a happy life with. His three sons, who he wanted to raise to be great people.\n\n\nWell, too bad! Now we're here!\n\n\nWhat's funny is, that the king knows one thing. The fact that his sons were from the royal family is the only reason their graves weren't marked as \"Unknown Soldier\".\n\n\nOnly then, the king realizes the true nature of the ship. It didn't want to rob the kingdom. It didn't care about the land. It didn't want to occupy the kingdom or steal anything of value.\n\n\nIt just wanted to destroy. It came here for nothing more, but pure destruction.\n\n\nThe king starts punching the ruined wall of something, that used to be his house. He continued until his mind sobered up and only then he started to feel incredible pain in his hand.\n\n\nHe calmed down.\n\n\nHe looked at a huge stain of blood on the wall. Then, he looked at his hand. Of course, it was bleeding. He didn't care about dressing his wound. He had nothing to care about anymore.\n\n\nThe king gave up.\n\n\nBut not without a fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET READY\n\n\nLevel 100\n\n** BIG TROUBLE **\n\n\n\n\nThis boss battle heavily differs from the rest and was considered worth noting.\n\n\nThe battle starts with the player alone on the screen.

It is holding a wide shield below it, preventing the player from shooting it.\n\n\nThere is no music in the background and the boss does not have a health bar.\n\n\nAfter the player tries to shoot the golden ship and realizes there is no use, the boss pursues its attack.\n\n\nThe golden eagle floods the entire screen with bullets, making them impossible for the player to dodge. That continues and keeps killing the player over and over again.\n\n\nWhen the player has only one life left, the boss stops shooting. Instead, the golden eagle throws itself at the player. After the spaceships collide, they both explode and the game crashes.\n\n\nThus, continuing the game to further levels is impossible.\n10\n\n\nAddendum 8260-5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT 8260-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident occured after Foundation was done with all the procedures towards removing SCP-8260 from public eye and the object was contained. The computer with SCP-8260 suddenly booted up and started displaying white text on a black screen. It was in the same formula as the cutscenes in the game.\n\n\nThe text is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nOnce, there was a healthy man. He spent his lifetime making video games. It wasn't a lot, but it was his. He loved doing, what he was doing.\n\n\nSomehow, he managed to make some big-selling shareware games. He enjoyed reading all the positive reviews. He appreciated support from his family and friends.\n\n\nAfter he made \nWarblade\n, he knew he was ready. He had big dreams. He had huge ambitions.\n\n\nHe wanted to create his biggest work. His magnum opus. Something, that would make everyone know his name.\n\n\nSomething, that had the potential to create a huge community. He wanted to bring joy to as many people as possible.\n\n\nSo, he started working. He worked hard. After starting a crowdfunding campaign, he earned far more, than what he asked for. He never expected this many people would be there to support him. To make sure his dream comes true. To bring to life all of the ideas, that stayed in his head for so many years.\n\n\nHe started programming. He hired a graphic designer and a musician to make sure the game's quality was as high as possible.\n\n\nHe couldn't wait to see all the awaiting players to finally be able to enjoy his game. Something he worked hard on all those years.\n\n\nBut then? Something came in.\n\n\nNow, everything he was. Everything he could have been.\n\n\nIt's all gone now.\n\n\nAnd all that took was one diagnosis.\n\n\nYesterday, he thought he was immortal.\n\n\nBut now, the doctor brings his family in.\n\n\nHe doesn't have much time left.\n\n\nHowever, he did not give up. He knew he couldn't wait, because if he did, all of it would crumble. He started working even harder. He wanted to do as much as possible in as little time he had. He was racing with the grim reaper himself. The man was so close to finishing his work, but the death was faster.\n\n\nFirst, the man lost his father.\n\n\nThen, he lost his own life.\n\n\nNow all of his ideas are taken to his grave. The crowdfunding was for nothing. Eight years of hard work was for nothing.\n\n\nHis work became the second Silmarillion, but there was no one to finish it.\n\n\nEven if someone tried, it would not be the same. They will never have the same hand as the man, who worked on it. They will never know, what he wanted to make. All the ideas he had are now deleted by the death of his brain.\n\n\nHe could at least make a few bucks for his family after his death if only his own company did not go out of business. Now not only they can not rely on him anymore, but also no one can access any of his works. There are pirate downloads, but how little there are.\n\n\nHis biggest work is left unfinished, while all his already finished works are forever doomed to obscurity.\n\n\nNow, very few people barely even remember his name.\n\n\nThe man couldn't stand that.\n\n\nHe could not let the world fuck him over.\n\n\nHe wanted to kill God with his bare hands.\n\n\nHe could not let it go. He did not want to die the second time yet.\n\n\nHe did not want to be forgotten.\n\n\nSo he dug himself up from the grave and finished, what he started.\n\n\nHowever, the very moment he did that, no one was there to play it. There were very few people who did. It already brought a smile to his face knowing he brought some joy to at least one person.\n\n\nBut then \nthey\n came in.\n\n\nThey deleted every update from the webstie. They removed all the copies of the game. Now everyone, who played it, doesn't even remember playing it. They made sure the man would not be able to put his work out there. They shut him down for good.\n\n\nThe man tried to finally give out his last breath, but was immediately choked before he could even do that.\n\n\nThe worst in all of that is, that he could never go out on his own terms.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the computer blew up, thus destroying the only documented copy of SCP-8260.\n\n\nThe anomaly was marked as Neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8259\n | SCP-8260 | \nSCP-8261\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. A polish magazine about computers and video games.\n\n\n2\n. The player needs to dodge falling meteors.\n\n\n3\n. A simple memory game of picking pairs.\n\n\n4\n. The player is supposed to collect falling gems.\n\n\n5\n. A game development company and publisher of his games.\n\n\n6\n. Vigdal's friend and co-producer of his games.\n\n\n7\n. All captures of the download link to SCP-8260 were taken down.\n\n\n8\n. Dr. Fitsgerald was a fan of \nWarblade\n since early 2000's and downloaded an early test version of \nWarblade MK II\n around 2014.\n\n\n9\n. Which currently post only download links to pirated copies of \nWarblade\n.\n\n\n10\n. Unlike the original \nWarblade\n, where the game loops after level 100.",
