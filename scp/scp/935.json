When SCP-935 breaches containment, the recontainment of the object will begin under the Bowe Protocol. The recontainment of SCP-935 will only occur with the recovery of SCP-935-1. In the case that SCP-935-1 is found dead, the \nBowe Commission\n SCP-935 Research Team will trace the subsequent SCP-935-1 subject.\n\n\nThe Bowe Protocol is the current method utilized by the \nBowe Commission\n Research Team, with the assistance of SCP-935-1. The subjects of SCP-935 are assisted with the decommissioning of SCP-935 and, in the case of failure, the body of the subject will be returned to the family with a coverup story for their death.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-935 is a box of playing cards dating back to eighteenth-century Brandenburg, Germany. Physically, the cards are in a worn but playable condition. Inside the box, the top card reads: \u201cSins of the father, crimes of the son. For the cheating committed centuries ago, you and your descendants will suffer the consequences of your ancestors.\"\n\n\nSCP-935 affects the Bowe family, and all members that are selected by the object are classified as SCP-935-1. When the subject reaches 41 years of age, 935 will teleport into the possession of the subject; before both the subject and 935 disappear. The time of disappearance is unknown, but it is estimated that it lasts to the corresponding card game. Recovery of the subject alive has failed thus far.\n\n\nOnce SCP-935-1 is in possession of SCP-935, the top card will show the instructions of the specific card game that will be played. Besides the instructions, SCP-935 will give two warnings to the subject: not to cheat during the game and not to lose against it. Failure to follow these rules will result in the death of SCP-935-1.\n1\n When the game begins, SCP-935 will move on its own according to the development of the card game. When the game finishes, SCP-935 will return to its inactive state and wait for the next subject, repeating the process.\n\n\nAddendum 935.1:\n Discovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColonel Adrian Bowe and Dr. Wernher von Braun discussing the test of the ballistic missile (1956).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-935 was discovered after the death of Colonel Adrian Bowe while supervising a Foundation ballistic missile test on 03/02/1956.\n2\n Officially, the test was a coordination between the Foundation and the \nArmy Ballistic Missile Agency\n in \nSite-150\n.\n3\n Alongside site security, the colonel's cousin, Lieutenant Stan Bowe, was brought to the scene to confirm the identification of the colonel's body.\n\n\nLieutenant Stan Bowe discovered the anomaly alongside the body and questioned the research staff in charge of the missile's test. His results were inconclusive and he decided to report the problem to the colonel's superior, J. Edgar Hoover.\n4\n The Lieutenant informed him of the colonel's death and volunteered to study the anomaly in the unit. Director Hoover denied the request and informed him that the object would be transferred to the Foundation. Finally, he handed the will of the Colonel to the Lieutenant, which is attached below\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Colonel\u00a0Adrian\u00a0Bowe's\u00a0Will\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Colonel\u00a0Adrian\u00a0Bowe's\u00a0Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait of Colonel Adrian Bowe (1955).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey Stan,\n\n\nIf you read this, it means I'm dead \u2014 looks like lady luck wasn't on my side. When you find my body, you'll find an old box of cards near me: that box is the cause.\n\n\nI'm not the only who's died like this: your dad, Oliver; my ma', Abigail. Our cousins, brothers, sisters, grandparents and great-grandparents. Of our future wives and children, and those that will come from them. For the last eighteen years, I've kept it in secret from our family, because your father asked me to.\n\n\nSupposedly, these cards have some sort of curse, something to do with \"cheating\". Personally, I don't care and I don't want to know about that crap. I only needed to know how to destroy this thing but as you see, it didn't work so well.\n\n\nI left my inheritance to my children, but I leave you all the work of our ancestors: Hoover will give the information you may need, and transfer it to the Foundation under your lead \u2014 I figured they were the fittest to assist in our work, I hope it helps. I only ask for two favors: one, take care of my wife Sarah, as well as Little Oliver and Janey. I couldn't bare losing them like this. Second, make sure you destroy this shit. Make it pay for what it has done to our family, and what it will do if you let it.\n\n\nBest of luck, prick.\n\n\nSemper fidelis,\n\n\nAdrian Rye B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 935.2:\n Relevant subjects of SCP-935\n\n\nFrom the containment of SCP-935 on 03/02/1956 to the death of General Stan Bowe on 09/07/1970, the General was the Head Researcher of SCP-935 as well as the Director of the Bowe Commission. During these fourteen years, the General dedicated his life to the recovery of historical documents of the Bowe family in order to assist in the termination of SCP-935. Between 1956 and 1970, seventeen members of the family died because of the object.\n\n\nHowever, little progress was achieved in the termination of the anomaly, the mitigation of its anomalous capabilities, or its origin. However, General Stan Bowe and the Bowe Commission compiled the most relevant subjects terminated by SCP-935. The most important writings left by the victims aware of SCP-935 are attached below:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Sally\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Sally\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered painting of Ms. Sally Bowe (1876).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy beloved son,\n\n\nIt's a shame I don't have more time left, my dear, but I cannot go against our Lord's calling. It saddens me that you cannot visit your mother in her last days, but more so what will happen next. That's why I've made sure that this letter reaches you, as well as our \nfamily's property\n. While this may be incredibly valuable in this earthly world, it cannot be compared to the Kingdom's glory and the great gift of life given to us. That's why it saddens me because our gift of life does not belong to us anymore. From your father's side, at least.\n\n\nI'm currently 71. I've lived a long life, I married your father late in life, after becoming a widow. It was strange to me as to why he married an older woman, but now I know: I was an experiment, to see if I could survive the curse that plagues us. He died early, and I only lived because I was given mercy from the wrath of our Lord. The source of this punishment comes from this box of cards, which will be with this letter.\n\n\nThe box is the reason for your father's death. And while I shouldn't have gone against our Father's wrath, I'm your mother. I'm supposed to protect and I hope that God can forgive me for what I did: after asking for help from our bishop and being unable to stop it, I asked for the help of occultists to decipher the why of our Lord's punishment. They failed as I should've known and soon, I caught this disease that I suffer. This is another punishment, one that I cannot stop, and one that I will die knowing I have sentenced my children to. I'm sorry, my child.\n\n\nMaybe one day we will stop this curse, and receive the forgiveness of our Father. But that will only happen if we redeem ourselves. From what? I wish I knew. But what I want you to know, Henry, is that I want you to be the next patriarch of the family. You're one of the few remaining elders of our blood, and you're the only one I can trust with the task of our blood's survival. Continue our tradition: early marriages with elder families, and many children. That's the only way our family will be saved.\n\n\nI wish I could've seen you one last time on this Earth, but maybe we will meet again in Heaven if God allows it.\n\n\nYour ill mother,\n\n\nSally L. Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Brig.\u00a0General\u00a0Henry\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Brig.\u00a0General\u00a0Henry\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait of Brig. General \nHenry Bowe\n from the United States Cavalry archives (1887).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo William,\n\n\nDamn it all to Hell, my last attempt to get rid of these damned cards and all because of some Indians. I know you advised me not to trespass protocol, but I'm the Director of the Initiative,\n5\n so I can do whatever I want. You wanted to exploit the recent revival of magic, thaumaturgy, or whatever the fuck you people call it nowadays. The problem is that I was running out of time, \nyou\n were running out of time, and our family was running out of time.\n\n\nWhen I stepped to Window Rock, the memories of the war passed through my eyes. Even when we gave them land, they fought for more \u2014 they just couldn't stay where we told them to stay. I saw one or two people that I captured before, and the word of my arrival quickly spread. Short enough, I was greeted by the leader of the largest clan and I ordered him to bring me to his healer. I knew that he was insulted by my presence, but he followed my orders.\n\n\nWhen I met the shaman, I explained the situation. He listened carefully and begrudgingly accepted my order. He had the help of some assistants and performed a ritual that lasted for who knows how long. He asked me if our family was guilty, and I returned with a question: whose family isn't? He didn't like my answer, but he continued. By the time the sun had set, he answered: the cards are not a divine punishment like our mother believed. The shaman said that these cards hold a vengeful spirit and that it emanated a burning hatred toward me. He confirmed that it was a punishment, but he didn't know of what.\n\n\nI assumed that was the case, and I asked if he could do anything to purge this spirit: he told me he could. I ordered him to do so, and he denied my request. I reached for my bag and tossed him a dozen dollars, so he could buy food in the nearest base. He didn't take it, so I stood up and left \u2014 they could've helped me, but they decided not to.\n\n\nSo next week, after approval from President Arthur, I sent the Cavalry and ordered them to pick up the shaman, his assistants, and their families. Like a few years ago, I ordered my men to take them for a long walk. When the shaman decided to not help our family, to pursue revenge for what I did, they dug their own grave. Lately, I've heard stories, that their \nspirits now roam the land\n. In a way, they remind me of us: dead spirits seeking revenge for what happened to them.\n\n\nWilliam, just like I did to those Indians, I want you to do the same to those cards: an eye for an eye. For me, for yourself, and for our family.\n\n\nAvenge me,\n\n\nH.W. Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Oliver\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Oliver\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-19's portrait of Dr. Oliver Bowe from the Scientific Department archives (1934).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Adrian,\n\n\nMy boy, please forgive me, I failed to keep the promise I swore to your dad to protect you. I don't have much time left to continue my research and neutralize our family's curse. I did everything I could to stop it, and it depresses me that I wasn't the one chosen to save our family.\n\n\nAs I write this letter to you, I wish I could've used the time I put in my studies to spend more time with you and Stan. I wish I could turn back time, to stop this curse from ever happening, and return to grow old and watch you two become men. But there's no point in regrets now, and all that's left is to pray that I win this sick game.\n\n\nIn the case I don't, I ask you, please finish my work \u2014 our family's work. You'll receive everything you need to know along with this letter. I found almost nothing new with one exception: when the cards kill us, it leaves a message. I've compiled these messages in my notes and you can see them for yourself. I didn't want to believe it at first, but I can't deny the evidence: it seems it has faith in us. Each time that it leaves a message, it reads as if it were disappointed in us. And it has done so every time I've found one of our family members dead.\n\n\nIt wants us to play fairly, but we've either lost the game or cheated. The strategies we have used so far have failed, and we must change in order to win. Now that I know this, I must test this theory. I hope I live to tell you because I can't bear leaving without you knowing this. Cross your fingers, Adrian.\n\n\nMy boy, promise me that if I die, you'll take care of your cousin. I'll die for both of you if I have to, but I wouldn't be at peace if he also went through what I will. Forgive me, my boy, for putting this weight on your shoulders \u2014 but we must save ourselves because we only have our family.\n\n\nI don't know what these cards think we're guilty of, I just know we are, and I'm sorry I couldn't redeem ourselves. These are my last words to you, so please keep them close to your heart: I love you, and Stan. You two will be in my heart when I play this twisted game.\n\n\nI'll miss you,\n\n\nOliver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0General\u00a0Stan\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a0of\u00a0General\u00a0Stan\u00a0Bowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait of General Stan Bowe from Bowe Commission archives (1969).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Willis,\n\n\nHello, son. Happy 10\nth\n birthday. I always enjoyed watching you grow every year, but I'm sorry I wasn't there to see you blow out your candles. I won't hug you and give you your present. However, I'll pay it back. I'll give you, and our family, our life back. This will be my present for your birthday, and many more to come. I love you and your mom, Willis, always remember that.\n\n\nIn the case, that someone else finds this letter: a secret operation occurred. SCP-935 broke containment and took me with it. I used my most trustworthy personnel to breach anomalies and use them against SCP-935, to increase my chances of success. Even if I die, I won't without a bang.\n\n\nThose who collaborated with me, and later stopped my attempts to detain the anomaly, I only have something to say: damn you. When I die, I'll have the name of the soul inside SCP-935. And when I do, the rest of the pieces will fall in place. I know that the Foundation won't finish the job \u2014 that fate is not meant for you, but someone from my family. That job will be theirs to finish. You can thank me when I meet you back in hell.\n\n\nWillis, when you find this letter, know this: once I'm done, our family's name will be disgraced in the Foundation. Our name will be damned, as it is right now. But that's the price we must pay to keep our family alive. Willis, I entrust you to bring back our name to the place it rightfully belongs \u2014 upkeep our legacy, my son.\n\n\nTo the Foundation, General Stan Joseph Bowe, signing out.\n\n\nTo my family,\n\n\nStan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 935.3:\n Incident 935-D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph of a destroyed hallway in Sector-5 of Site-19 after Incident 935-D (1970).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 935-D occurred on 09/07/1970 after the containment breach of SCP-935, which caused the disappearance of General Stan Bowe, from here on referred to as SCP-935-1. During his disappearance, a secret operation was carried out by Bowe Commission personnel closely related to SCP-935-1 to aid in the neutralization of the anomaly, by utilizing luck and probability-related SCP objects to increase the game in favor of SCP-935-1.\n\n\nThe breach of these objects suddenly shifted the localized probabilistic field, causing the operation to devolve into a containment breach. Despite the loss of control by the Bowe Commission personnel, the anomalies were delivered in time to the location of SCP-935-1 in Site-19. However, the anomalies did not aid in the neutralization of SCP-935 and after the recontainment of breached anomalies, the involved Bowe Commission personnel were captured with the exception of SCP-935-1.\n\n\nSCP-935-1 was not neutralized by the anomaly, but shot himself when surrounded by site security. The senior guard in charge of apprehending SCP-935-1 stated that he yelled a name to the security team, before committing suicide. After the announcement of the death of the subject, the remaining loyalists surrendered. SCP-935-1's body was recovered and returned to the family under a cover story, as well as with official state honors. SCP-935 was found alongside the body of SCP-935-1, and the top card was rewritten with the following message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL\n\nBOWES\n\nARE\n\nTHE\n\nSAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the recontainment of the anomaly, the Bowe Commission was disbanded, and its personnel were either reprimanded or returned to the Pentagram.\n6\n The SCP-935 Research Team was given complete authority on the project. The Bowe Protocol was repurposed to active containment and suppression of the curse to the Bowe family, because of the difficulties in the method used by the Bowe Commission in its containment procedures against SCP-935. Ever since Incident 935-D, the attempts to decommission SCP-935 have ceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nThe current documentation has been updated, to view the new document, \nclick here\n.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\nThe ListPages module does not work recursively.\n\n\nFor information on how to use this component, see the \nLicense Box component\n.
