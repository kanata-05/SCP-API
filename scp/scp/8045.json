Access to SCP-8045 requires Level 2 clearance. Testing involving SCP-8045 must be conducted in a controlled environment with surveillance cameras monitoring the testing area. No anomalous items (including other SCP objects) or sentient creatures are to be left underneath SCP-8045 overnight.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8045 is a standard-sized 51\u00a0cm. x 56\u00a0cm. goose down feather pillow, with no discernible manufacturer's label or markings. The pillow is composed of ordinary materials consistent with those found in non-anomalous pillows.\n\n\nSCP-8045 exhibits its anomalous properties at night\n1\n when placed on a bed\n2\n with an item left underneath the pillow, between itself and the bed. These properties manifest only when all human individuals in direct sightline of the bed are either sleeping in the bed or are otherwise unconscious. If a fully conscious individual is present throughout the entirety of the night, SCP-8045 will not exhibit its anomalous effects.\n\n\nWhen these conditions are met, a fairy\n3\n (labeled SCP-8045-1) corresponding to the specific item type left underneath SCP-8045 will manifest in the room. SCP-8045 consistently summons the exact same SCP-8045-1 instance for any given item. All SCP-8045-1 instances wear miniature nametags identifying them as the fairy of that particular type of item.\n\n\nThe fairy will approach SCP-8045, retrieve the item left underneath it, and subsequently attempt to depart the room by flying away, disappearing shortly thereafter. In exchange for the item, the fairy will leave behind a form of payment; usually (though not exclusively), it will leave behind some kind of currency, most commonly in the form of a single quarter (25\u00a2 USD) coin.\n\n\nIf an SCP-8045-1 instance is interrupted in some manner before it is able to retrieve the item left underneath SCP-8045, it will prematurely disappear. It will attempt to complete its task later in the night when the conditions for its appearance are met once again. Surveillance footage indicates that SCP-8045's effects are not impeded by the presence of cameras.\n\n\n\n\nTesting Log - SCP-8045\n\n\nNote:\n Each test consists of the same procedure, leaving an object underneath SCP-8045, laid over a designated bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe \"Tooth Fairy\" manifests, taking the object and leaving behind a quarter coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 dog tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSame as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 synthetic human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Tooth Fairy manifests, taking the object and leaving behind a counterfeit quarter coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 printed photograph of a human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nA distinct \"Paper Fairy\" manifests, taking the object and leaving behind a quarter coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 quarter coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe \"Money Fairy\" manifests, taking the object and leaving behind a human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 twenty dollar bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Money Fairy manifests, taking the object and leaving behind an entire set of human teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 counterfeit quarter coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Money Fairy manifests, taking the object and leaving behind a synthetic human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\nNone.

Subsequently, they engage in a continuous exchange, taking the item left by the other fairy and replacing it with their own, creating an infinite loop. This exchange persists for approximately two hours underneath SCP-8045, at which point the Fairy Fairy manifests, taking both fairies away and leaving behind two quarter coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 human tooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNo result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNo result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest O\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n1 pillow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Pillow Fairy manifests, taking both the object and SCP-8045 itself, leaving behind two quarter coins before flying away and de-manifesting alongside SCP-8045, which has not been recovered since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJorgeMtzb's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-7229\n \n(+62)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7192\n \n(+12)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7911\n \n(+33)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-500-J\n \n(+153)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7424\n \n(+10)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8022\n \n(+92)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-719M4-J\n \n(+228)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7121\n \n(+118)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7194\n \n(+38)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5031-J\n \n(+32)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\nJorgeMtzb's Author Page\n \n(+22)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8044\n | SCP-8045| \nSCP-8046\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-8045\n\" by JorgeMtzb, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
