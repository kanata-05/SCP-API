Should the phenomenon manifest itself in an area repeatedly, the Department of Paraecology is requested to carry out a survey of the region for any observable abnormalities.\n\n\nFoundation personnel are advised to exit an area with immediate effect in the event of experiencing SCP-7187-like conditions or sighting unidentifiable entities within forests.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7187 is a phenomenon that manifests as a near-complete cessation of all auditory stimuli within a forest or similar wooded area within North America. The reasons behind SCP-7187\u2019s onset, initial creation or circumstances for occurrence remain unknown, despite extensive records of the event.\n\n\nWhile the phenomenon initially presents itself by creating unusually quiet environments, it has been noted that upwards of 70% of cases have resulted in the sightings of anomalous entities in the area\u2019s proximity. While such organisms are occasionally known to the Foundation, they are commonly unidentifiable and presumed to be uncontained anomalies at-large within deep woods. It is presently believed that in the remaining 30% of cases, the individual involved is simply unaware of the entities\u2019 appearance.\n\n\nCurrent theories suggest that SCP-7187 is itself non-anomalous and is rather a state created by the presence of an anomalous organism or group of organisms.\n\n\nAddendum 7187.1:\n Reported Cases\n\nSince 1902, around 700 instances of SCP-7187 have been officially recounted to local authorities or the US Fish and Wildlife Service, usually in an attempt to achieve identification regarding their experience. While many of these accounts are incomplete or lack evidence, the following is a record of prominent recent manifestations known to the Foundation as of 10/10/2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #004:\n1\n 11/07/2009, Mt Hood National Park\n\n\nDetails:\n A lone hiker (James Son, 26) was walking through Mt Hood National Park at midday before allegedly feeling as though he was under observation. Son\u2019s concerns grew as the sound of distant rocks being thrown was audible and the ground cover became thicker. Ultimately, SCP-7187\u2019s effect would take place at around 14:38 when the subject took note of a lack of all sounds aside from those created by himself. He froze before gazing towards a small ridge in a forest clearing, atop which stood a bipedal entity that appeared to be attempting to camouflage as a tree, albeit unsuccessfully. Both stared at one another before the entity took a staggered step forward and the subject fled the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #011:\n 14/10/2011, Sequoia National Forest\n\n\nDetails:\n Subject (Millie Harris, 38) was partaking in a group hike throughout the Sequoia Forest area before unknowingly stepping off-trail and becoming situated in an isolated position. In panic, she begun to call to the party and attempt to regroup, though following 8 minutes of calling realised that her vocalisations were the only sound present in the wood. It was shortly thereafter that the subject reportedly begun to notice a consistently shaped bush that progressively followed her for around an hour. Having begun to run at this realisation, the subject was able to identify that the object was in fact a humanoid wearing a \u201cghillie suit\u201d. The subject regrouped with her party following the encounter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #038:\n 27/04/2013, North Cascades National Park\n\n\nDetails:\n A civilian (Neil Fisher, 24) was patrolling the westernmost boundary of the North Cascades in light woodland while walking his domestic dog. An hour into the trek, the subject\u2019s dog begun to behave irrationally and suddenly paused before sprinting into the underbrush without barking; an act uncharacteristic of canids. Fisher chased after the animal into deep woodland for around 10 minutes before noting that SCP-7187\u2019s characteristics had taken place and the only prevailing sound was that of the canine running up ahead. Eventually the subject emerges into a glade where his dog is stood, still, pointed at a bush. As the animal begins to bark, a large instance of \nSCP-6644\n stands up, its arms containing a bundle of fungi. It stares at the canid before slowly walking away. The subject grabs the animal, runs in the opposite direction and in wake of the encounter alerts authorities. A visit to the site found only a scattered trail of mushrooms leading back to \nHowling Woods National Park\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #052:\n 06/09/2015, Tongass National Forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTongass National Forest, Alaska\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails:\n Subject (Rupert Morris, 56) is watching television in his home in rural Alaska, bordering the National Forest. He briefly pauses his viewing in order to prepare himself a meal from the kitchen, during which time no anomalous activity is reported, though CCTV displays a sudden lack of movement of tree foliage suggesting an immediate drop in wind conditions; this remains as one of the only occurrences of SCP-7187 that also prompted a lack of sound via the weather. Upon return to the living room, Morris seems intrigued by something outside. A single white rabbit is seen to be moving outside within reach of the tree line. The subject opens the back door and exits the home in an attempt to coax the animal into feeding from his hand, though once it tastes the offering, it immediately appears disgusted. The animal is dragged backwards, revealing it to be attached to a thin tree limb that retracts into a hollow in a mechanism similar in nature to that of an anglerfish. The tree promptly uproots itself and walks away utilising it\u2019s large root system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #075:\n 21/10/2019, Appalachian Trail\n\n\nDetails:\n A hiker (Mel Cottis, 41) is part-way through a 3 day trip through the rural Appalachian area. Around midday, she departs from her temporary shelter, noting the disappearance of several items of silverware from her kit, though continues regardless. The subject is travelling through a somewhat regularly used trail, though is alone for the majority of the afternoon, including the evening. At approximately 19:50, she gazes upwards and photographs early \u2018stars\u2019 appearing in the night\u2019s sky. The objects in question shine a dull red and are, in fact, not believed to be stars. 30 minutes pass before Cottis recollects the notion that all ambient sounds had ceased aside from that of the fire\u2019s. Atop a ridge 20 metres from the subject\u2019s camp stands a malformed deer. The subject stares at the entity, thought to be an instance of \nSCP-6448\n, before it rears up on its hind legs and begins to ambulate towards Cottis, at which point she retreats to her tent. According to the subject, the instance remained outside of the shelter for the duration of the night before the sound of birds returned upon daybreak. Trail cam footage revealed the instance to have been sitting at the campfire consuming roasted marshmallows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7187 Instance #082:\n 18/05/2021, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 [OPERATION LOCATION REDACTED]\n\n\nDetails:\n Operative Myers of MTF Gamma-4 was patrolling \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Woods in rural Washington State during the containment of an unrelated anomaly before breaking off from his team in order to cover more ground. Myers soon discovered a small cave that showed limited signs of habitation and hence showed relevance to the ongoing search operation; the operative soon alerted Task Force members and requested an aerial survey of the area. Nestled within a collection of rocks and foliage, a single sheet of A4 paper read \u201cdon\u2019t go back\u201d and, ignoring the message, the operative turned towards the cave entrance as silence had suddenly occurred. In a small opening in the trees a few metres from the cave stood a humanoid entity resembling Operative Myers. Seconds after this, a helicopter light illuminated the area, causing the entity to demanifest. A subsequent search of the area revealed no evidence of the individual\u2019s presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this log compiles only confirmed, detailed accounts of the phenomenon, this represents a limited fraction of total SCP-7187 manifestations; the full amount of which is unknown. Many were publicly explained under cover stories 190\u03a9 \u201cUFO Fever\u201d or 898\u0393 \u201cMissing 411\u201d.\n\n\nAddendum 7187.2:\n Containment Update\n\nOn 15/10/2022, Director Woods of Site-198 consulted with Researcher T. Davis (Head of SCP-7187 Research) regarding proposals surrounding a more direct approach to the anomaly\u2019s containment, specifically the use of hostile force in order to capture and study anomalous entities. The abridged conversation is found in the following:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Proposal\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Proposal\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-198, Department of Paraecology\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n Dir. Woods, Researcher Davis\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n Where\u2019re you going with this?\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n I\u2019m advising that we use more\u2026 direct methods of containment towards SCP-7187.\n\n\n(4 seconds of silence)\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n How so?\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n Use of lethal force to attempt to capture anomalies we observe alongside SCP-7187.\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n \n(Stutters)\n I know I have a duty to study these entities in more detail if possible, but I don\u2019t think this is where we should have our priorities, Director. I understand your consideration of terminating the entities if possible, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right course of action. It\u2019s worth noting that very little, none even, of the encounters result in hostility and, ignoring my stance as a researcher, maybe we should allow them to be left alone.\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n Really? Well if you think they\u2019re harmless then why do they cause their surroundings to go quiet? Isn\u2019t that an indicator that other organisms in the woods take them as a threat?\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n No. I think it\u2019s like, uuh, a similar effect to when it rains.\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n You think this is caused by the rain?\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n No! I\u2019m saying that, like when it rains, the wildlife quietens down because they all hide and shelter from the downpour. An animal doesn\u2019t know what rain is, or that it poses no direct threat to their life, but still they remain quiet.\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n Right. Either way, there\u2019re hundreds of unidentifiable anomalies in our woodlands so I propose that we begin termination attempts until we can at least ID what they ar-\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n You\u2019re missing the real point of 7187, Director! Of the 700 reports, how many were we able to identify?\n\n\nDirector Woods:\n Uh. Something like 203, 204.\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n Exactly. It serves as a reminder of how much we don\u2019t know, but if this is \nreally\n what you want to do, I suggest you get to work. The woods go deep, Director, deeper than you realise.\n\n\n(Davis\u2019 phone receives a notification)\n\n\nResearcher Davis:\n And that\u2019s 701. Mobilise Gamma-4.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing recent accounts of SCP-7187-like occurrences spawning outside of North America, active hunting of its related entities has been authorised.
