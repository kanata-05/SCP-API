Once a protocol to decommission SCP-7022 has been devised, it is to be implemented with utmost haste.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7022 is the designation given to the Foundation's current state of decline in certain aspects such as government support, technological development, and available funding. This currently causes an increasing amount of problems such as mass containment breaches, issues regarding the funding of various projects, and the possibility of external Groups of Interest overtaking the Foundation in certain sectors of research or technology.\n\n\nWhile the cause of SCP-7022 is unknown, current theories vary from the possibility of SCP-7022 being non-anomalous to it being the result of an unknown entity. On discovery of the true nature of SCP-7022, the Overseer Council will convene to discuss adjusting the procedures for handling SCP-7022.\n\n\nNobody\u2019s really sure what\u2019s happening here. I\u2019ll just append some files as we go. ~ Researcher David Ingram\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7022.1: Expanded Incident Report\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-19\n\n\nDate of Incident:\n 7/14/2020\n\n\nDescription of Incident:\n Potential containment breach and/or anomalous interference.\n\n\nResponding Unit:\n Nu-7 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\")\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the incident, Site-19 was fully stable and operational before becoming unresponsive to communication attempts for several hours. Attempts to access security camera footage were unsuccessful. As a result, a task force battalion was quickly assembled in nearby Area-726 to arrive at the site on near thirty minutes notice.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Relevant\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Relevant\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbridged Site Dossier: Site-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-19, ground level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file has one audio log attached.\n\n\nAh, how good it is to be the Site Director at the largest (and nicest, I might add!) Foundation facility in the world. Hiding in plain sight right outside the city of Atlanta, we use an counterconceptual obscuring device, a machine developed from the fruits of our local antimemetic division's research. Many other sites have tried to replicate it, but we were the ones that made it work first, so a pat on the back for us!\n\n\nI still remember the good ol' days of the site in its early days, before we had all these fancy devices that keep us safe. I was only 22 years old, the youngest of any Site Director of my time, and yet I got appointed to be the guardian of what was then one of the more\u2026 lower quality sites around. Think less of a Foundation facility, and more like some Area-51 dump. So not very good, and we started with only a handful of anomalies and\u2026 I think around a hundred people? O, I forget the numbers, but you get my point.\n\n\nYou remember 173? \n[Chuckle]\n Oh, who am I kidding, you are probably rolling your eyes at my mere mention of it. It was one of our first, and hell, I even took the picture for the darn thing and put it on the file! But apparently that's \"unprofessional\" and\u2026 \n[Distant murmuring]\n \u2026 oh, you hush, I'll rant all I goddamn want, its \nmy\n memorandum! Hm, where was I? Oh, right, early days. I tried to live up to that one quote about a king leading his men into battle. Who said that? Sun Tzu?\n\n\nAnyways, I was much more of a risk taker then, and now I'm stuck in this damn wheelchair and can't do squat except paperwork! I had a dream, to expand our site as much as I damn well could and look where it got me! Our oh so hardworking team made discovery after discovery, creating new departments where applicable, and saved the world a couple times, here and there. Our tiny facility couldn't handle this amount of anomalies, so we had to keep expanding underground! This spiraled, and what the hell, you probably get what came next. 1 basement turned into 60 levels!\n\n\nI think us alone are now approaching nearly five thousand anomalies in our care. Quite a large number, I might add! Think about it, can you even name five thousand people? I think its made everything a bit confusing now. We now even have a group of Sub-Site Directors for micromanaging some things. Not what I imagined for a greater Site-19, but if it works, it works!\n\n\nRegardless, whether you are transferring over, trying to find information for an anomaly, or just browsing, I'm happy to have made your acquaintance, and I hope we can work together to make the best Foundation we can! Signing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assigned task force arrived at the site at 13:42, approaching the building from behind. The initial task force consisted of five personnel, with more prepared outside the facility as reserves in the case of the initial task force becoming unresponsive.\n\n\nThe purpose of the mission is to investigate the given problem and remaining personnel with the containment of any anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nCo-Leader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one audio log attached.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nFoxtrot:\n Begin to approach the building slowly.\n\n\nThe five task force members walk to the back of the building. The door in the middle of the large concrete wall is visible through the cameras attached to the personnel.\n\n\nFoxtrot:\n Begin to examine our surroundings.\n\n\nThe task force begins to the outside of the building and the area around it for any abnormalities.\n\n\nZulu:\n Looks clear.\n\n\nFoxtrot:\n Alright. Lets prepare to\u2014\n\n\nA cracking sound is heard from above, interrupting Foxtrot.\n\n\nKilo:\n Hell was that?\n\n\nThe other task force members begin to look up and make sounds of shock. There is a man, elderly in appearance, hanging from one of the windows with no signs of life.\n\n\nFoxtrot:\n \u2026Okay. Echo? You know what to do, right?\n\n\nEcho:\n \n[Sigh]\n\u2026 Yeah, yeah.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n After the body was collected and sent back to mission command, an autopsy confirmed its identity as the Site-19 Director. No information regarding the cause of this has been uncovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter entering, communications with the task force became difficult due to memetic interference. As a result, communications were limited to only brief reports sent out by the task force as mission command worked to counteract the interference.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n One of the files sent by the task force after the reconnaissance report. Recovered from the office of Level 3 Senior Technician Sidney Sinclair, which contained more memetic interference than the rest of the facility. Rest of the files uncovered in the office still undergoing memetic deconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REPORT A381\u00a07/10\n\n\n\n\nInspected Region:\n Reality Stabilization Module Room #2913\n1\n\n\nNotes:\n Does anyone ever really read these things? Yes, the region is fully stable and active. Has been since I was transferred here. It's not like the machines are just going to grow wings and fly out of the room. Trust me, we've accounted for that possibility. Reality manipulation is weird.\n\n\nAnyways, hate to use this report to give warning of my lunch break, but I'm heading out for a bit. Bye bye!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe second report was received nearly 7 minutes after the previous file. The team was reported to have descended 17 floors in an elevator before the elevator became non-operational and had to be broken out of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nCo-Leader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mobile task force was covering floor 17 when the report came through. The floor was covered in a thick, unidentified black tar-like substance. The task force continued on, before coming across a hallway that was unable to be illuminated by their flashlights despite its strength.\n\n\nBefore they were able to react, a humanoid flesh-like entity burst out of the shadows and lunged at Foxtrot, before the other task force members began opening fire. Standard firearms had no effect, however an experimental weapon made by Echo was used, terminating both Foxtrot and the creature.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Entity was able to be identified as a human that underwent sarkic transformations. No sarkite-related items exist at Site-19, leading to the conclusion that the site was infiltrated by a terrorist. How they got inside is unclear. The task force was cleared for further descent.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Foxtrot was confirmed to be deceased, a second breakaway battalion was prepared in case the rest of Battalion 5 was to become unable to continue.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n A second file recovered from Technician Sinclair's office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REPORT J817\u00a07/11\n\n\n\n\nThis report has one file attachment.\n\n\n\n\nOkay? This thing on? Sorry about the whole audio log thing, hands are kind of full and I don't feel like writing shit today. Currently in the \n[Huff]\n \u2026 uh \u2026 third psychometic reaffiliation deconstruction chamber \u2026 \n[Pause]\n \u2026 who in the hell comes up with the names for these things? Last week I had to perform maintenance on a machine with a seventeen word name, it's like there's some lazy sci-fi author who pulls out a thesaurus to name these so they can sound smart\u2026\n\nAnyways, second system here looks to be just fine\u2026 Ah, wait, shit, did I really\u2026 \n[Yelling]\n HEY! YOU DOWN THERE! WHAT TIME IS IT? \u2026 hm \u2026. goddammit, I missed my damned lunch break. At least I \u2026 \n[Huff]\n \u2026 get paid extra for the time I missed.\n\nTheses things are pretty big\u2026 You'd think that a lot of people end up screwing things up around these parts every now and again. And yes, you'd be right. Just last week I had somebody blow up a\u2026 long-named thingie. It's been happening more and more recently, it almost makes you want to slap our personnel recruiters\u2026 who manages that department again?\n\nSeventh system here is also fully operational. If it wasn't that, then what's causing this leak? Oh yeah, forgot to mention, was called here because this machine was leaking some no-no hume emitting fluid. Don't know what it does, those big burly guys won't let me anywhere near the substance. Who knows, maybe its an SCP of some sort?\n\n\n[Huff]\n\u2026 This is the last system. I don't see any problems, this thing should be fully stable.\n\nWhat's the problem with this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDue to the combined presence of potentially dangerous heavy machinery at the lower levels as well as the lack of encountered personnel throughout the facility, accessing the lowest levels was deemed a top priority.\n\n\nUsing a hatch to access a series of maintenance tunnels, the team found a way to bypass another 16 levels of the building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nLeader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe task force approaches floor 33 from a maintenance tunnel located on the side. There is a brief argument on who should open the door and head in first, before Zulu orders Bravo to undergo the task. After opening the door and preparing for any potential threats, the entire floor actually seemed to be filled completely with dirt.\n\n\nThe task force continued on through floor 32. Floor 32 abnormally took on the appearance of a still-in-construction part of the facility, noted by building materials laid out over the floors, scaffoldings, and unfinished walls, and no anomalies despite normally being one of the largest floors.\n\n\n\n\nUpon learning of the state of floor 32, the O4 council\n2\n has stepped in to redact information pertaining to the incident. Reason for redaction is unclear.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The third and fourth files recovered from Sidney Sinclair's office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REPORT A173\u00a07/12\n\n\n\n\nThis report has one file attachment.\n\n\n\n\nYep, here I am again. This time inspecting the\u2026 uh\u2026 mass temporal anchor. That's right, floor 60. This thingie here is meant to make sure our timeline shenanigans don't get too shenanigan-y. Sorts out paradoxes and what-not. And I was called here because apparently its broken down for the first time in\u2026 has it ever broken down before?\n\nFun little history fact! Nobody knows the origin of this thing\u2026 now that I think about it, that describes over half of our anomalies\u2026\n\n\u2026I'm walking through the halls of this thing. Just looks old is all, I think that may have caused it. I'd recommend a new thermal plating on the exterior, that should be all. Hell, maybe we'll be graced with a miracle and another fully-built floor with built-in wifi will show up one day. Before you ask, person listening to this, yes, that did happen.\n\nAnyways, got some more work to do and some more reports to craft, so for now, I'll be signing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBUDGET PROPOSAL 5074\u00a07/12\n\n\n\n\nProposed by Technician Sidney Sinclair, reviewed by the Site Budget Coordinator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full replacement of thermal plating covering the exterior of the temporal anchor\n\n\nProposal Denied; \nThe budget does not allow for something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you feel this decision was a mistake, please contact our employee helpline!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGoing through a second staircase allowed the task force to descend down to floor 40 before another full report was sent through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nLeader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe task force walked into the floor, before being greeted with personnel conducting experiments on anomalies on the floor. Under interrogation, they all claimed to be active Foundation personnel, despite any checks inside the database for their names turning up no results. All of the personnel claimed that there was no containment breach within the facility.\n\n\nThe team checked in the space behind the containment cells, however the chamber for the containment specialist appeared to be completely removed. With no containment specialist chamber, there was no chance that the containment for anomalies present on the floor would still be functional.\n\n\nUpon hearing of the contents of the floor, the O4 Council gave orders on behalf of command to kill the personnel claiming to be part of the Foundation. The task force members refused at first, but after some repeated negative reinforcement, the task force members complied and shot at the researchers. One of the researchers pulled out a revolver, shooting and killing Zulu before dying.\n\n\nReasoning behind the order is redacted.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the previous report, a second team was sent down to aid with the containment of anomalies. In the meantime, the team was instructed to continue with their efforts to reach floor 60 of the facility.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The fifth file recovered from Sidney Sinclair's office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REPORT L914\u00a07/13\n\n\n\n\nThis report has one file attachment.\n\n\n\n\nFunny thing about those site directors and other higher-ups. They're completely out of touch with reality. Not really anything new with powerful people, that's kind of been a problem since the dawn of man. But with the Foundation, there usually isn't any other option than trusting them, since the alternative is death.\n\nWhat if I told you that the main option also leads to death?\n\nYes, I'm talking to you lot reading this from the comfort of your own level 4 lounge after the mass site containment breach \u2014 fuck you.\n\nIf you weren't aware, my last request was to replace the thermal plating for a key component to keeping this place running. It got rejected for budgetary reasons. But there's no budget problems, so why would they do that?\n\nWell, loyal listener. Looking through blueprints in the archives, or rather the lack thereof, it turns out that there was no blueprints for this machine. No records of it ever being built. Just showed up, with a dead body in it. The people here have been using this thing to clean up their own messes without even knowing how it works or where it came from. And now that it's causing problems, the irreplaceable resource that they've built their whole organization around is now running out, and they continue to extract favors from it.\n\nYes, I was demoted to level 2 and assigned to fix the air conditioner. And I'm fucking livid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe next maintenance tunnel allowed for the descent to floor 52, however the team let out at floor 51 due to the presence of high-danger keter anomalies at floor 52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nLeader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe task force arrived on floor 51, an advanced technological region for maintenance of both digital anomalies and experimental machinery. The floor also seemed to be covered in a thin coating of the same tar-like substance found on floor 17. Two bare skeletons bearing several burn marks were found in the corner of the entrance, right by the ventilation shafts.\n\n\nAfter walking through to the other end of the facility, the existence of the black-tar began to cease. However, while preparing to walk out and go down the final staircase, a solidified, black, tar-like substance broke through the ventilation shaft right by the entrance and latched onto both Bravo and Kilo. Both task force members began to scream for Echo to do something, as Echo began to open fire. Both task force members were pulled through the ventilation shaft before Echo was able to aid.\n\n\nEcho was instructed to keep moving.\n\n\n\n\nEcho left to go down the final staircase at 16:33.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n The final file recovered from Sidney Sinclair's office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REPORT Z7022\u00a07/14\n\n\n\n\nThis report has one file attachment.\n\n\n\n\nThings come to a head today.\n\nFunny thing, knowing you're about to die. Normally the first rule of dying would be not to, however, knowing it's inevitable, it makes you feel almost at ease.\n\nYeah, this isn't a standard tech report. Was assigned to unclog the toilets. Instead I'm in my office accessing secret files. People outside are preparing to use a battering ram to break open this barricade I set for myself.\n\nI found a couple\u2026 disturbing things. Those random appearances of floors? Turns out, I wasn't going crazy. The reason this site has expanded this much was because things kept popping up out of nowhere, meaning an increase of size for the facility, meaning more funding. And things keep disappearing too. And when they do, \"oh no, tragedy\", and an increase of funding as a \"Get-well-soon\" gift to their dear biggest site.\n\nBut what is causing these things to swap places in both different times? What if, since the time anchor is now breaking down, and said time anchor was fueling the whole site's activities, it's now malfunctioning and sending entire floors from our fully developed site to the past?\n\nAnd what do we get back from the past?\n\nYou know the answer to this question, Echo. Yes, I know you're reading this, with a surprised look on your face. I'm kind of a genius, I can do some looking into the future if I wish, present of our time-bomb. You know exactly what you need to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEcho arrived on floor 60 at 16:46.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONNAISSANCE REPORT 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \u2014 Breakaway Battalion 5 (\"All-Seeing Eye\") Personnel Report:\n\n\n\n\nLeader:\n Foxtrot\n\n\nLeader:\n Zulu\n\n\nRanker:\n Kilo\n\n\nRanker:\n Bravo\n\n\nSapper:\n Echo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one audio log attached.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nEcho:\n Good evening command, how are you doing? Listening on to me?\n\n\nEcho walks out into the ledge surrounding the temporal anchor.\n\n\nEcho:\n Too bad you couldn't tell me not to read the files. Woah, what a scandal that would be if it got out.\n\n\nEcho stops and examines the temporal anchor before her.\n\n\nEcho:\n I was the top of my class. A mechanic I was, before I got assigned to mobile task force duties. Apparently I was good enough to turn my duties, y'know, mobile.\n\n\nEcho stops to sigh.\n\n\nEcho:\n The others were never meant to make it here. Or I guess the better phrasing would be that you didn't care if they made it here. You only cared if I did. And for what reason?\n\n\nEcho continues to walk around the temporal anchor\n\n\nEcho:\n To fix the problem that you sat here and caused. You want me to fix this to sort out the paradoxes that you created, and you can go right back to abusing it. Yes, I know how to fix this situation, but it probably wasn't what you were hoping for.\n\n\nEcho begins to start tampering with the inside of the temporal anchor.\n\n\nEcho:\n This \nthing\n showed up because it just appeared out of nowhere. But, behold the greatest paradox yet to be sorted out, who made it appear? This thing doesn't just change timelines on its own.\n\n\nEcho finishes tampering around with the temporal anchor and takes a step back.\n\n\nEcho:\n You want something to sort out your paradoxes? Well guess what the best temporal anchor in the universe is \u2014 surprise, it's the universe itself!\n\n\nThe temporal anchor begins to undergo some form of self-repair. As it begins to go active once more, it causes the room to begin to shake.\n\n\nEcho:\n Nighty night, Overseers.\n\n\nThe feed cuts to static.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNote - Jesus christ, take a look at this. ~ Researcher David Ingram\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Relevant\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Relevant\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbridged Incident Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-19, ground level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 14th of July, 2020, an explosion has occurred in the region formerly designated Site-19, thereby completely destroying the site.

However, given the situation, it was decided to be used as the O4 council convened with full attendance for the first time in 43 years.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nA large amount of talking and bickering is heard amongst the participants.\n\n\nS. Kowalski\n4\n:\n Silence!\n\n\nThe entire meeting room goes quiet.\n\n\nS. Kowalski:\n Thank you. Now, as you all know, we will be hosting the thirteen overseers in our meeting room today.

Kowalski:\n Sorry, what was that?\n\n\nO5-13:\n Ah, sorry, connection error. Just wanted to say not to worry about that stuff, we've got more\u2026 pressing matters\u2026 to deal with.\n\n\nC. Raph\n5\n:\n Like, for example, Site-19 blowing up?\n\n\nS. Kowalski:\n Raph!\n\n\nC. Raph:\n It's true!\n\n\nO5-1:\n Gentlemen, if you'd please. Yes, yes, the rumors are true.

Kowalski puts his hands up.\n\n\nS. Kowalski:\n \nWhat?\n\n\nL. Donna:\n The only reason you suggest that is because \nyou\n own over the next-largest site, and would be the benefactor of said funding. None of the rest of us want our paychecks cut for your idiocy.\n\n\nS. Kowalski:\n A large amount of Foundation-owned machinery was in Site-19. It has to be replaced one way or another.\n\n\nL. Donna:\n Site-19 made their own technology from the ground-up. If you want some of your own, just go make it yourself!\n\n\nMore arguing all around is heard, continuing until all sounds are unable to be heard.\n\n\nO5-1:\n SILENCE!\n\n\nThe meeting room goes quiet once more.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Thank you. Site-19 hasn't been the only problem to the Foundation. A downward trend has been present in almost all sectors of the Foundation for a long while now. If we can pinpoint the cause of this downward trend, then we could possibly stop it.\n\n\nD. Ingram\n8\n:\n \u2026And you think they know the answer to that problem, why?\n\n\nO5-13:\n Huh?\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n We've been working on the solution to that problem well over 5 years. These guys haven't got a clue.\n\n\nO5-1:\n We think it may be anomalous activity. It's our duty to figure it out.\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n Is it? Well, once you figure out whether it's the hand of god doing this or if it's little 'ol Johnny down the street causing our downfall, do you think that will really change the situation?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nI. Carnigee\n9\n:\n \u2026Right. I think our main solution here is that we need to put on a face for everyone else.\n\n\nO5-3:\n A face?\n\n\nI. Carnigee:\n Yes. That's how we get all of our funding, no? We contain the anomalies. They give us money to keep the ball rolling and the pits of hell out of their back doors.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Right. This happened in the United States, we can request emergency funding for them under the pretense of defending against potential threats. Donna?\n\n\nL.

The pilot was notified over radio of the mistake, but continued to fly onwards.\n\n\nWhat is noted to be anti-memetic weaponry was dropped from the bomber and onto the facility, where it then destroyed a large piece of the Coalition's air-way. The bomber was able to flee before being destroyed by the anti-air in the region.\n\n\nThe Coalition has notified the Foundation of a potential error, with no response made. Instead, several more similar incidents have occurred across various Global Occult Coalition owned regions, leading to the assessment that this was a coordinated strike of some kind. A retaliation response is being prepared.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n War?! That's your solution to this problem? War?\n\n\nO5-1:\n You just walked into the office of an overseer and begun yelling at me? \nThis\n is what you use your Site-01 credentials for?\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n Do you realize how mind-bogglingly stupid this idea is?\n\n\nO5-1:\n It's not stupid. The Foundation rose up from conflict. What's a little more to continue the cycle?\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n You sound like a stereotypical movie villain right now.\n\n\nO5-1:\n I've heard that one before. Listen, we've run all the calculations. Our manpower may not be as large, but our technology allows us to outrank all other militaries combined. If we win in conventional combat, our longstanding problem will go away and we can go right back to growing. All of the other overseers agree with me on this one.\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n Just last year, the Foundation stood behind its vast amounts of intelligent solutions to difficult problems and its brains-behind-the-operations. What are you now apart from a warmonger?\n\n\nO5-1 slams his hands on his table.\n\n\nO5-1:\n The Foundation stood for its resilience despite adversity. I'm simply continuing that trend.\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n One dead body at a time? Did all the intelligent people burn alongside Site-19?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Get out of my office. Now.\n\n\nD. Ingram:\n Fine.

Apparently since we didn't have the funds to recapture them, they were acquired by various other groups of interest.\n\n\nAs far as exact numbers go, we've had 73 containment breaches across all Foundation sites with an estimated 182 anomalies lost.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Office of the First Overseer\n\n\nTo:\n Foundation Head of Containment Ailish Gerd\n\n\n\n\nThat should be fine. We are currently in the process of reclaiming those anomalies anyways. Just do your best to stretch out whatever funding we have for containment of remaining anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Foundation Head of Containment Ailish Gerd\n\n\nTo:\n Office of the First Overseer\n\n\n\n\nThat's just our problem. I can reinvest money previously put into employee retirement funds and place it in containment as a temporary wartime measure, but the issue is, nobody wants to actually work anymore.

He puts out the cigar in his hand, and leans forward.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n I'm sure it goes without saying why we are here?\n\n\nThe other members nod, and Mariano continues his speech.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n Right, well, in the past few weeks, it has been a tough time for the Foundation. I've understood that. As a result, I was willing to turn a blind eye to some of the\u2026 extraneous\u2026 measures that the Overseer council has put in place.\n\n\nE. Chase:\n And I've told you from the beginning we shouldn't have let that slide. Now we're at war.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n Yes, yes, I know. I got the report too. But what caught my eye was what was being done with SCP-2000. Alice, debrief?\n\n\nH. Alice:\n Yes, of course. We've been in a real pinch with manpower. It's been hard to find new members, and people are now quitting left and right now that the Foundation has mobilized.\n\n\nP. Prish:\n Yes, we read the report.\n\n\nH. Alice:\n But, what's interesting is, to combat this, the overseer council has given certain commands to SCP-2000\u2026 they're using it to generate clones to cover the manpower deficit.\n\n\nThe committee bursts into loud talking and arguing in reaction to this new piece of information. Mariano slams his hands on the table in front of him, and everybody goes quiet.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n This is the exact thing we are here to prevent. These anomalies are meant to save humanity, if we use it for combat, we're no better than the insurgency I say.\n\n\nSounds of agreement are heard across the committee chamber.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n Then it's agreed. We will hold a vote in 10 minutes, and decide what to do next.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nO5-1:\n Look at these beautiful guys!\n\n\nO5-1 waves his hand in front of a guard's face. The guard seems relatively unfazed.\n\n\nO5-1:\n These guards are programmed to follow my every command. Isn't that just spectacular? And we have, just about an infinite amount of them. Why didn't we think of doing this before?\n\n\nO5-1 turns to the other two overseers standing in the room with him, O5-2 and O5-13.\n\n\nO5-2:\n \u2026because it's unethical?\n\n\nO5-1:\n Hm? I thought that this was a marvelous idea, do you not agree?\n\n\nO5-2:\n No, no, it's not\u2026\n\n\nO5-2 takes several steps back.\n\n\nO5-2:\n It's not that I don't like the idea, it's just that we may run into problems with the ethics committee\u2026\n\n\nO5-1:\n The Ethics Committee?\n\n\nO5-2:\n Yes, we just heard back from them. Apparently they sent an order for us to cease our current activities associated from the conflict. Threatened sending Law's Left Hand over here.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Hah! You serious?\n\n\nO5-2:\n Serious as can be.\n\n\nO5-13:\n \u2026I really think they had a point there.\n\n\nO5-1:\n What was that?\n\n\nO5-1 walks up to O5-13.\n\n\nO5-13:\n This conflict has been nothing but disastrous for us. I voted based on our initial estimates of victory, by the department of anomalous warfare and SCP-7022 personnel, but I really didn't think it'd end up like this.\n\n\nO5-1 pauses for a moment before turning to the clone guard.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Treason, then. Take them away.\n\n\nThe clone guard moves towards O5-13, preparing to take them away. O5-13 takes out what appears to be a pistol, and takes several shots at the clone guard until they fall to the ground. He points the pistol at O5-1, before another clone guard comes from behind him and knocks O5-13 out, and drags them away.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Now, Mariano. Your move.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nE. Chase:\n You sent the order?\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n Sure did. Alice, did you send the notice to task force?\n\n\nH. Alice:\n Yep. They should be fully mobilized in two hours.\n\n\nA slamming is heard against the committee chamber's door. The guards in the chamber exchange looks of concern, and begin to congregate around the door.\n\n\nP. Prish:\n What's going on?\n\n\nGuard:\n Just stand back.\n\n\nWith another slam, the door bursts open and several identical Foundation personnel walk into the room.\n\n\n???:\n On order of the overseer council, you are now being expelled from your position due to insubordination.\n\n\nA. Mariano:\n W-What?\n\n\nThe clone personnel begin exchanging gunfire at the committee members, as the guards try to fire back. The guards manage to kill a few off, however several more flood in to take their place.\n\n\nGuard:\n It's no use! You have to evacuate!\n\n\nE. Chase:\n We're trying! The secondary door is fucking jammed!\n\n\nWith precision, the guards alongside each and every committee members get shot until they are no longer responsive. When the job is done, the guards stand there, idle for a few seconds, before walking back out the door.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7022.8: Results of Warfare\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n Office of the First Overseer\n\n\nTo:\n Department of Non-Anomalous Warfare Head Kernal Bernet\n\n\n\n\nHow's my favorite department director doing?

Due to the facility's presence on a lake island, Kernal Bernet ordered a makeshift bridge to be created to allow the personnel access through the lake. Establishing a footing on the facility was designated top priority.\n\n\nHowever, halfway through construction of the bridge, Global Occult Coalition bomber planes, as well as artillery lined up around key points begun firing on the bridge, destroying it before Foundation soldiers could make a landing. Mission designated a failure, and orders given to retreat.\n\n\nUpon attempting to retreat, the task force was surrounded by what appeared to be guerilla forces, and were systematically wiped out. Casualties estimated at 4,482 personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7022.9: Overseer Council Meeting\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nO5-2:\n You've all been informed of recent events?\n\n\nO5-2 looks at the council before her.

One isn't here.\n\n\nO5-9:\n I was going to vote against it all at first, but after what happened to the Ethics Committee, I didn't want to take any chances.\n\n\nO5-5:\n Yeah\u2026 the thing about the Ethics Committee is that it needs the power over the council under circumstances like these, otherwise it doesn't actually work.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Right. And if we have nothing we can do without causing worldwide mayhem, then we need somebody who still \ndoes\n have power over the council.\n\n\nO5-8:\n Like who? Who like that still exists apart from, y'know, us?\n\n\nO5-2 clears her throat.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Do you all remember the story of how the Foundation was created?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Christ, that's all one talks about now.\n\n\nO5-2:\n What he neglected to mention was the fact that this was done with help by none other than the Administrator.\n\n\nO5-6:\n Well, two, have you ever made contact with this Administrator?\n\n\nO5-8:\n He may not even be alive anymore.\n\n\nO5-7:\n If they were even real in the first place.\n\n\nO5-2:\n But that's all we have. I made sure to develop an .aic to locate and send a file to them pleading for help.\n\n\nO5-3:\n You sure that would work?\n\n\nO5-2:\n It's worth a shot.

But there's no budget problems, so why would they do that? Well, loyal listener. Looking through blueprints in the archives, or rather the lack thereof, it turns out that there was no blueprints for this machine. No records of it ever being built. Just showed up, with a dead body in it. The people here have been using this thing to clean up their own messes without even knowing how it works or where it came from. And now that it's causing problems, the irreplaceable resource that they've built their whole organization around is now running out, and they continue to extract favors from it.

People outside are preparing to use a battering ram to break open this barricade I set for myself. I found a couple\u2026 disturbing things. Those random appearances of floors? Turns out, I wasn't going crazy. The reason this site has expanded this much was because things kept popping up out of nowhere, meaning an increase of size for the facility, meaning more funding. And things keep disappearing too. And when they do, \"oh no, tragedy\", and an increase of funding as a \"Get-well-soon\" gift to their dear biggest site. But what is causing these things to swap places in both different times? What if, since the time anchor is now breaking down, and said time anchor was fueling the whole site's activities, it's now malfunctioning and sending entire floors from our fully developed site to the past?

As a result, I was willing to turn a blind eye to some of the\u2026 extraneous\u2026 measures that the Overseer council has put in place. E. Chase: And I've told you from the beginning we shouldn't have let that slide. Now we're at war. A. Mariano: Yes, yes, I know. I got the report too. But what caught my eye was what was being done with SCP-2000. Alice, debrief? H. Alice: Yes, of course. We've been in a real pinch with manpower. It's been hard to find new members, and people are now quitting left and right now that the Foundation has mobilized. P. Prish: Yes, we read the report. H. Alice: But, what's interesting is, to combat this, the overseer council has given certain commands to SCP-2000\u2026 they're using it to generate clones to cover the manpower deficit. The committee bursts into loud talking and arguing in reaction to this new piece of information. Mariano slams his hands on the table in front of him, and everybody goes quiet. A. Mariano: This is the exact thing we are here to prevent. These anomalies are meant to save humanity, if we use it for combat, we're no better than the insurgency I say. Sounds of agreement are heard across the committee chamber. A. Mariano: Then it's agreed. We will hold a vote in 10 minutes, and decide what to do next.",
        "O5-1: Look at these beautiful guys! O5-1 waves his hand in front of a guard's face. The guard seems relatively unfazed. O5-1: These guards are programmed to follow my every command. Isn't that just spectacular? And we have, just about an infinite amount of them. Why didn't we think of doing this before? O5-1 turns to the other two overseers standing in the room with him, O5-2 and O5-13. O5-2: \u2026because it's unethical? O5-1: Hm? I thought that this was a marvelous idea, do you not agree? O5-2: No, no, it's not\u2026 O5-2 takes several steps back. O5-2: It's not that I don't like the idea, it's just that we may run into problems with the ethics committee\u2026 O5-1: The Ethics Committee? O5-2: Yes, we just heard back from them. Apparently they sent an order for us to cease our current activities associated from the conflict. Threatened sending Law's Left Hand over here. O5-1: Hah! You serious? O5-2: Serious as can be. O5-13: \u2026I really think they had a point there. O5-1: What was that? O5-1 walks up to O5-13. O5-13: This conflict has been nothing but disastrous for us. I voted based on our initial estimates of victory, by the department of anomalous warfare and SCP-7022 personnel, but I really didn't think it'd end up like this. O5-1 pauses for a moment before turning to the clone guard. O5-1: Treason, then. Take them away. The clone guard moves towards O5-13, preparing to take them away. O5-13 takes out what appears to be a pistol, and takes several shots at the clone guard until they fall to the ground. He points the pistol at O5-1, before another clone guard comes from behind him and knocks O5-13 out, and drags them away. O5-1: Now, Mariano. Your move.",
        "E. Chase: You sent the order? A. Mariano: Sure did. Alice, did you send the notice to task force? H. Alice: Yep. They should be fully mobilized in two hours. A slamming is heard against the committee chamber's door. The guards in the chamber exchange looks of concern, and begin to congregate around the door. P. Prish: What's going on? Guard: Just stand back. With another slam, the door bursts open and several identical Foundation personnel walk into the room. ???: On order of the overseer council, you are now being expelled from your position due to insubordination. A. Mariano: W-What? The clone personnel begin exchanging gunfire at the committee members, as the guards try to fire back. The guards manage to kill a few off, however several more flood in to take their place. Guard: It's no use! You have to evacuate! E. Chase: We're trying! The secondary door is fucking jammed! With precision, the guards alongside each and every committee members get shot until they are no longer responsive. When the job is done, the guards stand there, idle for a few seconds, before walking back out the door."
