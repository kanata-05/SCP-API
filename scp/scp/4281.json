SCP-4281-1's location is marked with a white arrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4281\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The room containing SCP-4281 should remain locked and marked with an \"out of service\" sign. Unauthorized individuals found trespassing within this area are to be questioned, then given Class-A amnestics. Two security personnel will remain on site at all times, posing as casino staff. Communication with SCP-4281-1 is forbidden outside of approved testing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4281 is a lavatory stall located inside the first floor men's washroom of the Holy Roller casino, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1 is a sapient entity residing inside this stall. Visual confirmation of SCP-4281-1 is only possible via the 20cm gap under the stall's walls/door. Viewing the interior of SCP-4281 by any other means reveals only an empty stall. If SCP-4281 is forcefully entered, either by bypassing the interior rotatory lock or simply breaking down the stall door, SCP-4281-1 will be entirely absent. Closing the door, or leaving the washroom unoccupied and unobserved for any period of time will cause SCP-4281-1 to re-appear. Due to this effect, SCP-4281-1 has only ever been observed as the calves of a white male, wearing white-red striped socks and blue-white 1995 Adidas Orion running sneakers.\n\n\nWhen an individual enters the stall directly adjacent to SCP-4281, within 10-15 seconds SCP-4281-1 will begin conversing with the occupant. SCP-4281-1 is described as having an up-beat, mild south-west American accent, and being prone to lengthy personal anecdotes, unsolicited advice, and long-winded opinions on current affairs. SCP-4281-1 will continue speaking regardless of response, or a lack thereof, often bridging natural pauses in discussion with phrases such as \u201cThat\u2019s right, huh? Of course it is.\u201d, \u201cAnother thing about that\u2026\u201d, and \"Heck, you know what that reminds me of?\u201d\n\n\nWhile most often discussing mundane topics, SCP-4281-1 has, on rare occasions, demonstrated an insight into various anomalous subjects, including \nthaumatology\n and hemogenic evocation. Additionally, SCP-4281-1 appears to possess a great deal of personal and classified information on the Foundation and several GOIs. Attempts at guiding the conversation towards these subjects has proven highly ineffective, as SCP-4281-1 seems unwilling or incapable of deviating from its chosen \u201cdiscussions\u201d. As such, the full scope of SCP-4281-1's knowledge, or how it is acquired, is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a0SCP-4281-1-01\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a0SCP-4281-1-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log - 4281-1-01\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4281-1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. M.

SCP-4281-1, can you repeat that? Are you saying you're familiar with both [DATA EXPUNGED] and \nHeka\n blood rituals?\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Oh I'm heck-a sure I am! Hah! Just a little river-valley joke for ya. 'Course, you probably know those rituals are a messy business! 'Aint worth botherin' with, if you ask me. That-there dog ended up with an awful temper, eatin' all the meat out of the fridge, puttin' claw marks in the car door. Real active on walks though, kept ol' Carter in shape I guess b-\n\n\nDr. Clarke:\n No, not the dog. Could you go back to th-\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n -orth it. Barkin' at nothin' all the time!

The test was officially terminated at 5:56AM, roughly an hour after SCP-4281-1 began discussing its favorite types of bean salad.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a0SCP-4281-1-05\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a0-\u00a0SCP-4281-1-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log - 4281-1-05\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4281-1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher O.

Name\u2019s Cam.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Good to know ya\u2019 Cam! You know, I met a Cam once, out in West Bank, had to be fifteen years-\n\n\nWilliams:\n Oh hey, say, what\u2019s your name?\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Ah I\u2019m just an old rambler, but Cam, my Cam y\u2019know, he was the kind of fella who-\n\n\nWilliams:\n Oh yeah, hah, we all know a guy like that. We had lots of them back East. So where are you from?\n\n\nGiven previous conversations, Researcher Williams had been instructed to aggressively head off SCP-4281-1 to prevent a \"rant\", while still appearing friendly.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Wherever the wind takes me, you know how it is! Well, no, you don\u2019t. You never even left Warrenton before all this! I guess that\u2019s East of somethin\u2019, all things relative, so I won\u2019t call you a liar.\n\n\nWilliams:\n I-\u2026 hah, you got me buddy. Caught my accent huh? I traveled West to get here so-\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Oh-ho-ho! Not bad! \"Never lie. A half-truth is much easier to swallow.\" Agent Porter would be proud!\n\n\nResearcher Williams goes silent, awaiting instruction. Director Imani, his handler, tells him via earpiece to continue the test.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Alright, since you know who I work for, I'll stop with the pretense. Honestly though, I'm just here to chat. I want to get to know you! My name actually is Cam-\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n You hate bein\u2019 called Cam.

Then again Matt never was the thinkin\u2019 type. Big though. Big, mean, held back two years, Daddy always givin' him the belt. He took that out on you, the little bastard. Him and his gang.\n\n\nWilliams:\n Yes- well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got plenty of stories abo-\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n \u2018Creepy Cam\u2019, always reading those big old books, dressing in black, drawing strange little doodles in his notebook. Smart as a whip, didn\u2019t even need to try. Matt resented that, y\u2019know. The guidance counselor was right, he was jealous! 'Course, knowing that didn't stop him from shovin' you in a trash can. That wasn't so bad though. Now mouthin\u2019 off about your Ma, that was the worst. Even Matt regrets that. He didn't know, y'know? He didn't know she'd gotten sick. He feels bad about crossing that line, even today. He even apologizes to you in his sleep, then wakes up with wet eyes.\n\n\nWilliams:\n L-\u2026 Listen, could we talk about something else? I don\u2019t think-\n\n\nSCP-4281-1 creates a thumping sound against the dividing wall, three open-palm slaps.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Ah cmon, buck up! It got better, right? Matt\u2019s off pumping gas these days, and look at you! Big fancy science man at a secret lab! Hoo-wee! If those kids could see you now!\n\n\nDirector Imani calls to terminate the test given SCP-4281-1's current topic. Researcher Williams stands, and moves to open the door.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Hey, whoa there! I didn't mean to offend! I thought we were getting to know each other!\n\n\nResearcher Williams exits the stall. SCP-4281-1 is heard shouting.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Hey, cmon Cam- er, Cameron! It's all in the past, y'know? You're a popular guy now! Lots of \"creepy\" friends, right?\n\n\nDirector Imani instructs Researcher Williams not to engage. Researcher Williams moves to exit the washroom.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Shame what's happening to Lawrence though!\n\n\nResearcher Williams stops with his hand on the door, pauses, then turns and re-enters the stall. Director Imani reiterates that the test has ended.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Not surprising, y'know. He never was quite as clever as you. Kind, though. Real kind. Sat with you on that first day, introduced you to everyone, even taught you how to kick the vending machine just right for a free soda! Good man, good man. Doesn't deserve what's happening to him, no sir.\n\n\nWilliams:\n What do you mean \"happening\". Lawrence is\u2026 he's dead.\n\n\nDirector Imani tells Researcher Williams not to divulge any additional information. Researcher Williams disconnects his earpiece and microphone, dropping them to the stall floor.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Hah! Dead!? Not by half! Real kick in the pants, that. \u2018Course, if I walked into a big angry cave full of screamin' rocks I\u2019d sure-\n\n\nWilliams:\n Wait, please, what do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n -think twice about not bringin' a map!

Uh, well, alright then! Have a good night fellas! Come back any time!\n\n\nNo audio is recorded for 4 minutes.\n\n\nAt 1:49AM, Researcher William's microphone picks up several labored breaths, and a long, deep sigh. SCP-4281-1 is heard speaking quietly.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n God dang it. Things were going so well. What'd I do wrong? People like talkin' about themselves, right? \u2026 I shoulda' just told him the trucker story. Everyone loves that story. Or maybe I shoulda' mentioned-\u2026 nah, he would have found that boring. Maybe I coulda'- no, that's just stupid. Dang it. Dang it!\n\n\nAnother 10 seconds elapse.\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n Dang it.\n\n\nAnother 45 seconds of silence follows.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4281-1:\n \u2026Why am I like this.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4280\n | SCP-4281 | \nSCP-4282\n \u00bb",

So where are you from? Given previous conversations, Researcher Williams had been instructed to aggressively head off SCP-4281-1 to prevent a \"rant\", while still appearing friendly. SCP-4281-1: Wherever the wind takes me, you know how it is! Well, no, you don\u2019t. You never even left Warrenton before all this! I guess that\u2019s East of somethin\u2019, all things relative, so I won\u2019t call you a liar. Williams: I-\u2026 hah, you got me buddy. Caught my accent huh? I traveled West to get here so- SCP-4281-1: Oh-ho-ho! Not bad! \"Never lie. A half-truth is much easier to swallow.\" Agent Porter would be proud! Researcher Williams goes silent, awaiting instruction. Director Imani, his handler, tells him via earpiece to continue the test. Williams: Alright, since you know who I work for, I'll stop with the pretense. Honestly though, I'm just here to chat. I want to get to know you! My name actually is Cam- SCP-4281-1: You hate bein\u2019 called Cam. Always have. \u2018Creepy Cam\u2019. Williams: That-\u2026 what? SCP-4281-1: That\u2019s what they used to call ya, right? \u2018Creepy Cam\u2019. Hah! Not very creative. Then again Matt never was the thinkin\u2019 type. Big though. Big, mean, held back two years, Daddy always givin' him the belt. He took that out on you, the little bastard. Him and his gang. Williams: Yes- well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got plenty of stories abo- SCP-4281-1: \u2018Creepy Cam\u2019, always reading those big old books, dressing in black, drawing strange little doodles in his notebook. Smart as a whip, didn\u2019t even need to try. Matt resented that, y\u2019know. The guidance counselor was right, he was jealous! 'Course, knowing that didn't stop him from shovin' you in a trash can. That wasn't so bad though. Now mouthin\u2019 off about your Ma, that was the worst. Even Matt regrets that. He didn't know, y'know? He didn't know she'd gotten sick. He feels bad about crossing that line, even today. He even apologizes to you in his sleep, then wakes up with wet eyes. Williams: L-\u2026 Listen, could we talk about something else? I don\u2019t think- SCP-4281-1 creates a thumping sound against the dividing wall, three open-palm slaps. SCP-4281-1: Ah cmon, buck up! It got better, right? Matt\u2019s off pumping gas these days, and look at you! Big fancy science man at a secret lab! Hoo-wee! If those kids could see you now! Director Imani calls to terminate the test given SCP-4281-1's current topic. Researcher Williams stands, and moves to open the door. SCP-4281-1: Hey, whoa there! I didn't mean to offend! I thought we were getting to know each other! Researcher Williams exits the stall. SCP-4281-1 is heard shouting. SCP-4281-1: Hey, cmon Cam- er, Cameron! It's all in the past, y'know? You're a popular guy now! Lots of \"creepy\" friends, right? Director Imani instructs Researcher Williams not to engage. Researcher Williams moves to exit the washroom. SCP-4281-1: Shame what's happening to Lawrence though! Researcher Williams stops with his hand on the door, pauses, then turns and re-enters the stall. Director Imani reiterates that the test has ended. SCP-4281-1: Not surprising, y'know. He never was quite as clever as you. Kind, though. Real kind. Sat with you on that first day, introduced you to everyone, even taught you how to kick the vending machine just right for a free soda! Good man, good man. Doesn't deserve what's happening to him, no sir. Williams: What do you mean \"happening\". Lawrence is\u2026 he's dead. Director Imani tells Researcher Williams not to divulge any additional information. Researcher Williams disconnects his earpiece and microphone, dropping them to the stall floor. SCP-4281-1: Hah! Dead!? Not by half! Real kick in the pants, that. \u2018Course, if I walked into a big angry cave full of screamin' rocks I\u2019d sure- Williams: Wait, please, what do you mean? SCP-4281-1: -think twice about not bringin' a map! Heck, I nearly got lost one time in this big ol\u2019 K-Mart off the I-29. Y\u2019know, back in- Williams: Wait, just wait-! SCP-4281-1: - the day before they shut down. Funny story there. See, the manager of that-there K-Mart had a- Williams: Please, please just stop talking for one second! Please! Is Lawrence alive!? How can I find him!? Security personnel enter the washroom. Researcher Williams is advised to leave the stall. SCP-4281-1: -welve horses! Can you believe it? The poor kid on cash was there with a mop until past midnight just tryin' to- Williams: Wait! Guys- just listen, he knows something about- No, please, just give me another five minutes to- Security Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588 : [REDACTED] After a short pause, Researcher Williams is voluntarily escorted out of the washroom. SCP-4281-1: So I said to him- Oh! Uh, well, alright then! Have a good night fellas! Come back any time! No audio is recorded for 4 minutes. At 1:49AM, Researcher William's microphone picks up several labored breaths, and a long, deep sigh. SCP-4281-1 is heard speaking quietly. SCP-4281-1: God dang it. Things were going so well. What'd I do wrong? People like talkin' about themselves, right? \u2026 I shoulda' just told him the trucker story. Everyone loves that story. Or maybe I shoulda' mentioned-\u2026 nah, he would have found that boring. Maybe I coulda'- no, that's just stupid. Dang it. Dang it! Another 10 seconds elapse. SCP-4281-1: Dang it. Another 45 seconds of silence follows. SCP-4281-1: \u2026Why am I like this. <End Log>"
