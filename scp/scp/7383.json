The team arrived within 2 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\"[\u2026] We reached the specified address without difficulty. It's a quiet area, so we didn't anticipate any issues from residents. Following protocol, we disguised ourselves as plumbers. [\u2026] Leaving the vehicle parked, we proceeded directly to the house entrance. No anomalies were observed in the immediate vicinity. Upon inspection, we found the door to be locked, and the doorbell appeared non-functional.\n\n\nHowever, we noticed that the mailbox was filled with shredded black paper. We contemplated the risk of forced entry, but before retrieving the necessary equipment from the vehicle, we received a radio transmission from Site-\u2318. After confirming credentials, we were instructed to immediately abort. I consulted with Site [Redacted], and the order was confirmed. [\u2026]\n\n\nNext, we were ordered to stand down and await the arrival of a specialized surrealistics team.

Thus, the Site-19 surrealistics liaison personnel contacted Site-\u2318 directly. The following processing form was sent in response, also contained within a black envelope.

An investigation revealed that the origin of the file traced back to BO-2. Access to the SCP database should not have been possible from there. Nevertheless, the file contained containment procedures and descriptions attributing BO-2 as an anomaly. The contents of the already dispatched letters were also present in digitized form within the file. Automatic filters detected the presence of cognitohazards.\n\n\nSince no further assistance was expected from Site-\u2318 due to its presumed refusal and the surrealistic nature of its responsibilities, RAISA decided to activate MAGNA.AIC to manage this dossier. A debate has been requested by the Overseer Council to discuss the handling of a suspected surrealistic SCP without the support of Site-\u2318.\n\n\nAdditionally, a guard was stationed before BO-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvelope 3\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n March 3rd\n\n\nRECIPIENT:\n Uploaded directly to the article\n\n\nFROM:\n BO-2\n\n\nCONTENT:\n One dialogue transcript\n\n\nVIBES:\n Oh\u2026\n\n\nEGGSHELL BREAKING POINT CREATOR:\n No\n\n\n[Comment by MAGNA.AIC]:\n The following transcript had to be heavily edited due to the presence of numerous cognitohazards.

If an ant is drowning, can it do the same? Ants and termites sometimes build borders when they live close together. Safe and stable borders. Why shouldn't ants in the glass be able to do the same with the fiery oils on the crossed hands?\n\n\nAnts lay eggs. They certainly don't like weak points.

The video does not contain any audio. An automatic translation of Meyer's lip-movements was cancelled due to the presence of cognitohazards.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN VIDEO TRANSCRIPT]\n\n\n[Janitor Jacob Meyers can be seen as he sits down in front of the camera inside a dark room. He appears to be suffering from fatigue and is bleeding from the nose. He appears to be looking at something off camera for three seconds before speaking.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nEggs are not normally triangular. Breakfasts are not usually triangular. They are still squared, right?\n\n\n[Meyer's rubs his temples.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nTriangular hands don't have eggs. Well, for breakfast, maybe. Ants have many eggs, though, even if they are in a jar. They fight for their eggs when they have to. But what if an ant becomes triangular and can see through the glass? Would it see the rolling of the cold beyond, the inverted hands of mirror-smooth space-grasping things? And these hands shake the jar and the ant sees it, it could act.\n\n\n[Meyers holds his face in his hands.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nIf an ant knew, it could act. And if it has a heart, it will leave the jar and bind the triangular hands - with more and more silk. The most beautiful and best silk imaginable, complex and meticulous, incomprehensible even to itself. But the silk is triangular. What do squares even feel like at this point? Has there ever been something besides triangles?\n\n\n[Meyers looks to the side again and watches something for nineteen seconds. Then, he faces the camera once more. As he stares, he produces a capsule. It is marked with a green loop square, which indicates it to be a container for Agnostics. The looped square is surrounded by a red triangle.]\n\n\n[Meyers proceeds to open the capsule slowly and places it on the table before him.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nWith ants, drones are responsible for carrying out tasks. They are efficient, precise and fast. They can carry up to forty times their own weight. They do all this for their colony. A square ant that becomes triangular can do much more.\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nWhen Humans build a road, it's a complex job. Then they also destroy ants' nests. They don't hate the ants. They may not even know they are there. They just do it, coolly, methodically. It's in the way. But triangular hands are hatefull and [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. So very [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. Yet hate, of all things, leads to intimacy, curiosity and closeness. You want to see what you hate so that you can hate it. And you can grasp and bind what is close to you.\n\n\n[Meyers produces a white object, later identified to be an eggshell breaking point creator, commonly used as kitchen utensil. He places it on the table, next to the capsule. In the background, there [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED].]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nWhen preparing a breakfast egg, hands can cook it in different ways. Some use an eggshell breaking point creator at the breakfast table. Isn't that a nice memory? Was there a memory of a square breakfast table? Do ants eat breakfast? Maybe\u2026 Some ants certainly associate fond memories with eggs! Hands don't. How apt it is then, for something designed to break them to become central to their protection. It makes sense for the triangles at least\u2026\n\n\n[Meyers proceeds to consume a three-sided Agnostic.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: \nTriangular shapes have never really folded in on themselves. They only ever expand. They might reach the shivering kingdom if your head desires to be the ramification.\n\n\n[He squirms before looking at the camera directly.]\n\n\nMeyers:\n Don't ever tell them. Good bye.\n\n\n[END VIDEO TRANSCRIPT]\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Cross-checking revealed the agnostics in Meyer's possession to be a new generation of agnostics in the testing phase. They are produced in a triangular shape. Why these materials, which have not yet been released for general use, were in BO-2 and in Meyers posession is unknown.\n\n\nThis file will be locked until further notice.\n\n\n[Comment by MAGNA.AIC]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Addendum\u00a02\u00a0-\u00a0Squares...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
