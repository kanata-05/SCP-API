Alteration to a component of SCP-4279 before assembly requires approval from site command. Testing of a reassembled SCP-4279 must be conducted at an off-site explosives testing range and activated remotely. All items produced by SCP-4279 are to be contained and disposed of in accordance to standard procedures for radioactive waste.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4279 is a device separated into 7 components, marked one through seven on attached documentation, with the following descriptions handwritten in Urdu:\n\n\n\n\nPower Supply\n\n\nLead Ion Collider\n\n\nRecombination Vessel (Mk. II: post-Iron metals)\n\n\nElement Extruder (Mk. V: Hydrogen through Plutonium)\n\n\nMolecular Assembler (Mk. III: Fizzier champagne)\n\n\nOutput Tray\n\n\nCommand Input\n\n\n\n\nWhen assembled, SCP-4279 uses electrical power to generate and assemble matter into theoretically any molecular or atomic form based on pre-programmed designs, the coding language of which has been reverse engineered by Foundation programmers. Items created by SCP-4279, however, invariably produce high amounts of gamma, alpha, and neutron radiation, making them immediately lethal to nearby organic life and posing a lasting ecological threat to the nearby environment. Ongoing research of SCP-4279's components have yet to identify which are responsible for the radioactive side-effect.\n\n\nAddendum 4279-1: Discovery\n\n\nSCP-4279 was discovered on 2017/08/17 when embedded agents in the Pakistani government alerted the Foundation of an anomalous radiological disaster at a facility owned by Khan Research Laboratories\n1\n in the city of Kahuta, Pakistan. MTF Unit Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") dispatched a Curie-class drone remote-controlled via insulated wired connection upon measuring a constant radiation rate of 625\u00a0mSv/s\n2\n at a distance of 1.4\u00a0km from the source.\n\n\nThe drone measured a radiation rate of 7220\u00a0mSv/s at a distance of 30m before making visual contact. The video feed identified a single, unopened bottle of champagne sitting on the output tray of SCP-4279 as the source. SCP-4279 was surrounded by multiple cadavers dressed in military uniform and one in a lab coat with a patch bearing the words: Dr. Tanzil Baqri, Research Lead. The bottle was contained within a concrete container with a lead-boron lining by remote-controlled drone.\n\n\nAddendum 4279-2: Log of Created Items from Command Input\n\n\nList of items recovered from the Command Input component's on-board memory translated from Urdu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nProgram name\n\n\nItem created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/04/02\n\n\nWater\n\n\n160\u00a0g of gaseous oxygen, 20\u00a0g of gaseous hydrogen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/06/21\n\n\nRice\n\n\n1\u00a0kg of rice starch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/09/29\n\n\nChick peas\n\n\n50\u00a0g of pureed chick peas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/11/13\n\n\nWater\n\n\n180\u00a0g of liquid water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/12/14\n\n\nRice\n\n\n1\u00a0kg of hulled rice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/02/28\n\n\nCup of water\n\n\n180\u00a0g of liquid water in a 200\u00a0mL plastic cup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/03/01\n\n\nBottle of champagne\n\n\nA 500\u00a0mL bottle of champagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/03/01\n\n\nBottle of champagne (large)\n\n\nA 1 liter bottle of champagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/03/01\n\n\nUntitled-2017-03-01\n\n\nOne latex condom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/03/02\n\n\nUntitled-2017-03-02\n\n\nOne 500\u00a0g bar of dark chocolate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/04/11\n\n\nI don't have to wait\n\n\nA golden replica of the Nobel Prize in physics, dated 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/04/19\n\n\nHelium-3\n\n\n3\u00a0kg of \n3\nHe in a 500\u00a0mL steel canister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/05/15\n\n\nUntitled-2017-05-15\n\n\n20\u00a0100-mg pills of sertraline\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/05/15\n\n\nBottle of scotch\n\n\nOne 750\u00a0mL bottle of single malt scotch whiskey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/05/29\n\n\nFor the historians\n\n\nGolden bust of Dr. Tanzil Baqri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/05/30\n\n\nBetter idea\n\n\nPlatinum bust of Dr. Tanzil Baqri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/07/15\n\n\nUntitled-2017-07-15\n\n\nOne 200\u00a0mg dose of Mifepristone\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/07/28\n\n\nUntitled-2017-07-28\n\n\nA wooden placard reading \"You Still Helped The World\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/07/28\n\n\nUntitled-2017-03-02\n\n\nOne 500\u00a0g bar of dark chocolate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/07/28\n\n\nBottle of scotch\n\n\nOne 750\u00a0mL bottle of single malt scotch whiskey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/08/05\n\n\nUntitled-2017-08-05\n\n\nOne 500\u00a0g container of concealer makeup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/08/15\n\n\nSomething nice for the generals\n\n\nOne silk dress interlaced with diamonds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/08/15\n\n\nBottle of champagne\n\n\nOne 500\u00a0mL bottle of champagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017/08/17\n\n\nBottle of champagne\n\n\nOne 500\u00a0mL bottle of champagne made entirely from unstable isotopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4279-3: Recovered Note\n\n\nThe following was discovered inside the Command Input component during initial disassembly at Site-33.\n\n\n\n\nTo Dr. Baqri,\n\n\n \n\nI hope the champagne was fizzy enough this time.
