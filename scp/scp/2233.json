The Site has been designated a paper-media-free zone, and no form of printed media (including books, magazines, and other forms as specified in the SCP-2233-1 Appendix 3) are to be brought within a 1\u00a0km radius of any instance of SCP-2233-1 outside of approved testing.\n\n\nUpon the discovery of new SCP-2233-1 instances, MTF-Lambda-2 \"Academics\" is to sanitize the area of all affected media. New instances are to be immediately incinerated. A Lambda-2 member is to be inserted into the pedagogical board of every college with average enrollment larger than 30,000 to ensure a fast response in case of an SCP-2233-2 event.\n\n\nIn case of a Jehoiada event, the lecturing venue is to be quarantined immediately and Procedure Styx-Lethe-Acheron applied.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2233 is an academic discipline called \"Sociosophy\", manifesting through SCP-2233-1 instances and SCP-2233-2 events.\n\n\nSCP-2233-1 is a book labeled \"Polylogue \u2013 Over the horizon of postmodern relativism\", published by \"The Club of Friends of Sociosophy\"\n1\n in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2014. The authors are listed as StbB. Emil Franti\u0161ek; BasSc., WtaN. Herbert Mu\u017en\u00fd; DmbS. et DmbS. Martin P\u0159\u00edklopa; and collective\n2\n. It is unclear if all of the authors are real persons, as only a few had been seen during the Jehoiada events. Unconfirmed authors include [REDACTED].\n\n\nThe book contains theories on pseudo-academic subjects, such as \"Polylogue\" as an improvement of conversing, \"Problemology\" as a discipline concerning various life issues, or \"Neonovoplatonism\" as a religiously philosophical practice.\n\n\nThe practice of the disciplines seems nonsensical, unless affected by the presence of associated Persons of Interest. See Report of Event-2233-02-1 for a noteworthy Jehoiada event, involving the creation of E-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and E-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by unknown reality-bending abilities.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-2233-1 manifest when placed in close proximity (max. 600m) to other paper media. After about 3\u20135 hours, the media start to mention sociosophy in various forms. For example, newspaper headlines mention recent sociosophy breakthroughs.\n\n\nThe existing content of the media is also modified; for example, in the work of [REDACTED], a bibliography entry \"FOUCAULT, Michel: \nThe History of Sexuality: Vol. 2: The use of pleasure.\n Vintage books, New York, 1990.\" was changed to \"MU\u017dN\u00dd, Herbert: \nSexuality in Sociosophy, Vol 1: Practiced Episthemophilia\n. EX crementum bovinum, Little Hill, 2002.\"\n\nInitially, no such book was found, but after a \u2588\u2588-hour exposition of \nThe History of Sexuality, Vol. 2\n to SCP-2233-1, the contents of Foucault's book have been completely altered into the new anomalous publication described above.\n\n\nAffected media exhibit the same anomalous properties as 2233-1 instances.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Examples\u00a0of\u00a0modified\u00a0media\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor/Title:\n Renfrew, Colin. \nPrehistory: The making of the human mind.\n\n\nDescription:\n The author surveys the intellectual world of the prehistorical man before written records were made.\n\n\nModified Author/Title:\n Bumberell, Peter. \nHistory on the couch.\n\n\nDescription of the modified book:\n The author describes prehistorical inventions in a jovial style, calling the man who first found fire and the man who invented the wheel as the \"First protosociosophists\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor/Title:\n Cassirer, Ernst. \nPhilosophy of symbolic forms.\n\n\nDescription:\n The book argues that man is a \"symbolic animal\", creating its universe out of symbolic meanings.\n\n\nModified Author/Title:\n Franti\u0161ek, Emil. \nSubjectophobia: A psychological disorder or a natural evolution of human spirit?\n\n\nDescription of the modified book:\n The author describes the dangers of inventing new words, such as jargon, considering their usage \"an intellectual robbery of a simple, hermeneusophistic vocabulary\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor/Title:\n \u010capek, Karel. \nTalks with T.

The princess uses her time in the tower to practice said discipline, which is never described, only cited from secondary sources. The prince meets her \"on the level of the right sub-stratum\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew 2233-1 instances have been discovered inside publishing houses, and during SCP-2233-2 events. The publishers take SCP-2233-1 as a satirical book, ignoring its anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-2233-2 is a designation for lectures on various disciplines of sociosophy by people who read SCP-2233-1 or attended a 2233-2 event in the past. These occur mainly in college environments, such as universities, mensas, or fraternities. SCP-2233-1 instances are often given out during these lectures.\n\n\nPoI associated with SCP-2233 appear in average 60% of the lectures, constituting a Jehoiada event. When a copy of 2233-1 is signed by the PoI, the efficiency of the book's anomalous properties have been shown to increase by \u2588% - \u2588\u2588\u2588%, including increased speed of infection and range of influence.\n\n\nUncontained SCP-2233-2 events constitute a major containment breach and if left unchecked, amount to a IK class end-of-the-world scenario \"Information breakdown\".\n\nNo pattern in the frequency and location of 2233-2 has been established.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Report\u00a0of\u00a0event\u00a0SCP-2233-02-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2014, the first Jehoiada event took place in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Prague, a college caf\u00e9.

Herbert Mu\u017en\u00fd, who fell from the window of his study on a rock garden riddled with houseleek, per capitam.\"\n\n\nDuring the event, several PoI had brief lectures on the disciplines of sociosophy, during which several reality-bending phenomena were observed to take place. This 2233-2 event also celebrated the release of SCP-2233-1 to the public.\n\n\n[ACCESS DENIED]\n\n\nThe event helped constitute the parts of Procedure Styx-Lethe-Acheron and agents T\u016fma and Bla\u017eejovsk\u00fd were voluntarily administered Class-C amnestics after-action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Excerpts\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0book\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Chapter 17: Problemology, sub section 3: \"Preproblemology: We have a problem and we know about it\".\n\n\n\n\nProblemology is a new conceptutally-rhetorically-nontotalitarizating metadiscipline, which is typical for its socialscientifically-philosophical character.

BasSc., WtaN. Herbert Mu\u017en\u00fd's last work can also be read as a polemic with the \nGeometrical basis\n3\n: while in Franciscan\n4\n epistemosophy the information is infinitely divisible, Mu\u017en\u00fd postulated a certain minimal quantum of information.\n\n\nA minimal quantum corresponds with a minimal meaningful conclusion. The \"size\" of such a conclusion is determined by the quantum level in use, the discourse, or the medium, if you will.
