Any individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-3186 are to be interviewed and administered amnestics as is appropriate for their level of exposure.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3186 is an area, referred to by locals as 'Roger's Hill', located on the outskirts of Tursley, Massachusetts. Prior to its development of anomalous properties, SCP-3186 was used by local teenagers as a location for romantic socialization.\n\n\nWhen an individual is within SCP-3186 and looks up at the night sky, they will perceive the stars as moving to spell out a sequence of messages. There are nine messages in total, and the stars will move through this sequence on a loop until the viewer leaves SCP-3186. Note that this phenomenon is purely visual in nature, and no actual alteration of the stars is taking place.\n\n\nAnalysis of SCP-3186 suggests the use of thaumaturgy was involved in its creation using techniques described in several occult texts known to currently be in circulation.\n\n\nAddendum 3186-1 (Message Sequence):\n\n\n\n\nHI BECKY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME + YOU FOREVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWILL YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH ME?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE MESSAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMESSAGE COMPLETE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCANCEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCANCEL MESSAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE CANCEL MESSAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUCK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3185\n | SCP-3186 | \nSCP-3187\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3186\n\" by Tanhony, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
