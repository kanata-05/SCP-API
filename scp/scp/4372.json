The boundary of SCP-4372 must be monitored to ensure it does not come into contact with the walls of the containment unit. \nExploration teams must to be tethered to a recovery winch anchored beyond the border of SCP-4372.\n\n\nThe Ashby Protocol was enacted by Dr. Joseph Edmunson on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/17. Therefore, manned exploration of SCP-4372 is no longer permitted. No contact is to be attempted with effects/entities within SCP-4372. Communications originating from SCP-4372 are not from Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4372 is a gaseous substance that forms a half-sphere reaching 4.5\u00a0m in height and fluctuates between 10\u00a0m and 14\u00a0m in diameter. The substance resembles a dense smoke, and physical contact leaves a dusty residue comprising of carbon, calcium, phosphorus, and other molecules believed to have biological origins. It is unknown if living matter can be safely recalled from SCP-4372.\n\nExternal testing during manned exploration suggests that matter within the boundaries of the SCP-4372 is compressed into increasingly smaller, flatter dimensions as it approaches the center. Individuals within SCP-4372 do not seem to notice this effect.\n\n\nDue to these compression effects, the internal topography of SCP-4372 appears vastly larger than its outer dimensions. Crossing the threshold of the gaseous substance reveals a barren, desert-like environment completely saturated in SCP-4372, which is otherwise devoid of notable features.\n\n\nSCP-4372-1 is a light source that appears to float at the center of the gaseous substance. External observation measures SCP-4372-1 emitting visible light at 3500 lumens. Reports from inside SCP-4372 depict the light in the distance, resting near the horizon. Attempts by Foundation personnel to reach SCP-4372-1 are not believed to have succeeded.\n\n\nManned expeditions have confirmed the presence of humanoid entities within SCP-4372. Neither intent nor agency of these entities has been confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached Addenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4372.1: Exploration Logs\n\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017, Dr. Mai Giang L\u00ea oversaw the first and only manned exploration of SCP-4372. A Provisional Exploration Team (PET) was assembled including two D-class personnel experienced in exploratory testing and equipped with modified Foundation chemical HAZMAT equipment. Dr. Mai and Researcher Edmunson supervised the mission from the control room overlooking SCP-4372, while Specialist Addaway was assigned to personnel recall duty within the containment cell.\n\n\nPhysical actions recorded by cameras in the control room and containment cell were transposed into these transcripts when applicable. No useable footage from inside SCP-4372 was recovered.\n\n\n\n\nExploration 4372.1 Audio Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017, 0617 hours\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Dr. Mai Giang L\u00ea, Head Researcher\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nD-82626:\n Well, now I feel like an astronaut. Just like I always dreamed.\n\n\nD-30199:\n How's your airflow?\n\n\n(D-82626 gives the \"thumbs up\" sign.)\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Gentleman, please vocalize all responses for the record. Drone cameras haven't sent much back, so we don't know if we'll get any useful video.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Yep, okay. The suit's fine. I can see a scratch on the faceplate, is that okay?\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Yes, we saw it during suit check. It's just a scratch in the reflective coat. Addaway, please hook up the recall winches.\n\n\n(Addaway nods at the camera and clips tethers into the back of the PET's HAZMAT suits.)\n\n\nD-82626:\n That smoke shit is weird. What is it?\n\n\nD-30199:\n No idea. It's not supposed to be dangerous, though. Just dusty.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Why the spaceman suits if it isn't dangerous?\n\n\nD-30199:\n You can go naked if you want.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Seriously, though?\n\n\nD-30199:\n Maybe it's only dangerous if you're playing around in it.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Right. Boss, could you please remind me of our mission objective?\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n You're to enter SCP-4372 and investigate the nature of 4372-1.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Yeah. I thought so.\n\n\nAddaway:\n Don't worry, guys. You're pros, right? And I've done this a thousand times.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Pulled idiots out of scary clouds?\n\n\nAddaway:\n No, uh. You know. The winch. Pulled this lever.\n\n\n(D-82626 looks to D-30199 and grunts.)\n\n\nAddaway:\n I guess I can go on break if you want.\n\n\nD-30199:\n No, no, we very much respect your winching expertise. Glad you're here, right Twenty-Six?\n\n\nAddaway:\n Seriously, I can leave it to you. I missed breakfast. There's a sandwich waiting for me in the fridge.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Gentleman, all precautions have been taken. The filters will block particulate matter, and the suits are rated for gamma radiation.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Yes, boss.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n You'll be fine. Please proceed into SCP-4372.\n\n\nD-30199:\n Roger. Let's go, Twenty-Six.\n\n\n(PET-4372 approaches the boundary of SCP-4372. D-82626 hesitates, extending a hand into SCP-4372, before he is gently pushed beyond the boundary by D-30199.

Edmunson:\n Affirmative. Data confirms what the drones sent back.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n What do you see?\n\n\nD-82626:\n It's like standing on dirty glass. Slippery. We should have brought cleats.\n\n\nD-30199:\n There's nothing out here, Doctor. Just this dust everywhere. We can see the light. It's pretty far away. Temperature's fine, though. Thought it'd be colder.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Your camera lens is obscured. Can you try to clean it?\n\n\nD-30199:\n Yeah, uh, just a second. Is that better?\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Not really, no. Same as the drones. It is what it is. Just describe what you're seeing.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Nothing. There's nothing here except dust and a whole lot of flat.\n\n\nD-30199:\n And the light. The dust seems like it's blowing toward it. I want to try something, just a second.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Shit. Let me try.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n What are you seeing?\n\n\nD-30199:\n Uh, a slight pull. I'm holding my tags out, hanging them over the ground, and the chain is sort of pulling toward the light. Just a little, I can barely feel it, but I can see it.\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Understood. Your mission hasn't changed. Please proceed toward the light.\n\n\nD-82626:\n You know when you say it like that, it's a lot more terrifying.\n\n\nD-30199:\n Shut it, let's move. Quick in, quick out.\n\n\nD-82626:\n Yep, yeah, okay.\n\n\n(Irrelevant communication excised. PET continued in the direction of SCP-4372-1 for one hour, twenty-two minutes.)\n\n\nD-82626:\n No, seriously, an ATV, like those Foundation military guys used to chase the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 back when we were at Site-\u2588\u2588.

Can you find him?\n\n\n(No response.)\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? Ninety-Nine? Please respond.\n\n\n(Light breathing continues. No response.)\n\n\nDr. Mai:\n Fuck. Fuck. Bring up Twenty-Six.\n\n\nR. Edmunson:\n Yes ma'am. Three, two, one.\n\n\nD-82626:\n -leave me, wouldn't leave me. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. Wouldn't leave me, wouldn't leave me, wouldn't leave me. I'm going home, I'm-I can hear you there, I heard the pop. Please, say something. I know you're there again. Doctor? Ninety-Nine? I've been getting dragged for so long. God help me. \nSomeone\n help me, please. I can't get up. I can't disconnect. I can't get up. Someone please-\n\n\n(Communication cut by R. Edmunson.)\n\n\nR. Edmunson:\n Ma'am? Dr. Mai? Dr. Mai, wait, if you go-\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that exploration logs have been transcribed exactly as recorded. Linguistic analysis has been unable to definitively distinguish communications of the exploration team from \"echoes\" produced by anomalous effects and/or entities inside SCP-4372.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4372.2: Public Reprimand and Record of Personnel Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Dr. Johannes Ashby\n\nTo: Dr. Mai Giang L\u00ea\n\nSent: 12:31 AM, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 2017\n\nSubject: Transfer to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDr. Mai,\n\n\nWe have received and confirmed the following complaints lodged against you by Dr. Joseph Edmunson regarding the manned expedition into SCP-4372 on the date of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017, and the following incident recorded six days later on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017:\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Human Resources documents on D-Class personnel without an approved need-to-know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing personal information about D-class personnel without approval, including but not limited to breaching protocol regarding terms of address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempting extraordinary and unapproved methods in an attempt to recover D-class personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting Foundation research staff (yourself) at unnecessary risk in attempting to interact directly with a dangerous SCP object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolation of the Ashby Protocol and risking unauthorized, potentially dangerous communication with an unknown anomalous entity.\n\n\n\n\nEffective immediately, Dr. Brian Haskell will be taking over managing containment for SCP-4372. You are to report to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which extensively employs D-Class personnel for testing and maintenance purposes. I believe that in this position, you will gain a deeper understanding of how the Foundation utilizes our D-class personnel, and that with practice, you too will effectively wield the diverse resources that the Foundation offers you and your research.\n\n\nI hope that working with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will help you adjust to the admittedly unorthodox life of a Foundation researcher, and that you will grow into the scientist we know you can be. Please be safe, as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is extremely hazardous, and we may not be lucky enough to intercept your case of poor judgement in the future.\n\n\nWe all expect great things from you, Dr. Mai. Please be more cautious in your future work with the Foundation.\n\n\n-Dr. Johannes Ashby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4371\n | SCP-4372 | \nSCP-4373\n \u00bb",
