Review of any potential matches is subject to specialized monitoring and identification protocols, which should include direct searches and analysis of no more than 25% of constituent text from any single given instance by any single web-crawler or analogous Foundation software.\n1\n\n\nLaw enforcement reports, online forums and media, and external news sources are to be similarly monitored for any potential references to SCP-6094 instances and activation events, with special focus given to reports indicative of novel versions beyond those already cataloged; as well as any potential leads relating to Person-of-Interest 6094 (PoI-6094)\u2019s identity, background, scope of anomalous capabilities, and/or their possible accomplices. External incidents involving the activation of any SCP-6094 instance are subject to immediate response by Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (\"Hecate's Spear\"), with appropriate amnesticization and misinformation protocols application tailored to the context of any particular version of SCP-6094 involved in any given incident.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6094 is the collective designation of at least twenty-four related versions of thaumaturgically charged text that continuously appear and self-propagate across the internet.\n2\n Each version closely resembles standard \nLorem Ipsum\n placeholder text commonly used in physical and virtual modern written media (such as new or unfinished web pages where SCP-6094 tends to manifest), with instances textually differing only slightly from non-anomalous pieces of text, as well as from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0Historical\u00a0Background?\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text constituting the modern \nLorem Ipsum\n text derives from a section of a Latin-language work \nde Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\n (\nThe Extremes of Good and Evil\n) by the Roman philosopher Cicero. However, the wording has undergone various major changes and mutations from the source material over time, primarily with the beginning of its use as dummy text in the Renaissance-era printing and typesetting industries. As such, the verbiage does not express any particularly meaningful or coherent semantic message even in the Latin language on which it is based, but does vary enough from word to word so as to be minimally distracting when used as filler text while focusing on development of non-textual elements in various written and digital media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXCERPTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison and reference, the most common or \u201cstandard\u201d modern iteration goes as follows:\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\n\n\n\n\nThe original section of Cicero\u2019s work from which the above text is based reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2026dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum[d] exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? [D]Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla pariatur? [33] At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus, qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti, quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint, obcaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa, qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of an instance of SCP-6094 results when an individual visually perceives and actively begins to read (whether audibly or silently) any part of the constituent text. Onset of effects usually begins about 25% to 35% of the way through in most cases across most versions, with the strength of their effects usually increasing in some manner based upon the reader\u2019s continued progression. Though this renders small enough portions of the text to be effectively non-anomalous if removed from the rest of the instance, it also enables new instances to spread unnoticed for extended periods of time.\n\n\nArtificial intelligences can usually trigger SCP-6094's effects by the same methods as humans, though the nature of the effects on any artificial programs and constructs may vary somewhat based on the exact properties of a given version. New SCP-6094 instances can appear after an existing instance has been activated by spreading to some other open or recently accessed web page on the device from which it was activated. \nThis is the only known way new instances are generated.\n (Update: See Addendum 6094.03)\n\n\nOther than this common method of propagation, the exact anomalous effects of each version of SCP-6094 text when activated vary significantly from version to version. However, each has so far been found to contain one or more changes based on wordplay, based on English, Latin, or both; or otherwise intuitive references to the nature of a given version's anomalous effect, always at least partially contained within the first sentence and its own textual deviations. However, such \u201cclues\u201d are usually too vague to convey any particularly meaningful details to a reader without actually reading along far enough to trigger the effect anyway and thus experience the results, leading to a fairly limited utility of this property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6094.01: Documented Versions and Effects\n\n\n\n\nThe following entries consist of the first sentence from known versions of SCP-6094.\n3\n Words diverging from standard, non-anomalous \nLorem Ipsum\n are coded in blue, with particular mutations that specifically appear to refer to or indicate an instance's particular activation effect bolded as well.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0Sample\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur \nad piscis\n elit, sed do \neis modei\n tempor incididunt \ntu\n labore et dolore \nmagna \naqua\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n The reader temporarily gains the ability to breathe underwater, while simultaneously losing the ability to breathe outside of it.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Duration of the primary effect, running from approximately 2 and a half minutes to 48 hours as the reader progresses.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Affected individuals almost always appear to instinctively realize their sudden need of water for continued respiration, and as such rarely finish through the entire text. However, D-class testing has shown that, if pushed, a full or near-full reading will result in rudimentary gills beginning to form at the base of the neck, and the duration of the effects will greatly lengthen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem \nopossum\n dolor sit con \nevocari\n adipiscing elit, \nseod\n eiusmod tempor \ninterpono labor et dollar\n magna aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n At least one member of the order \nDidelphimorphia\n4\n and/or similar mammals will appear after a variable amount of time, and attempt to interrupt or otherwise add unnecessary difficulty to whatever tasks the subject is engaging in by the time of the animals' arrival. Priority will be given to any employment or money-making endeavors, and any loose currency or financial instruments may also be taken during these incidents.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Generally, larger and larger quantities of animals will appear as more of the SCP-6094-2 instance is read, though it is currently unknown if the primary factor in this is increasing range of effect or simply a matter of the increasing number of affected animals in a pre-determined area.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Variation in the number and type of animal(s) that arrive appears to also be in part a result of the fact the anomalous effect simply affects and attracts nearby wildlife, rather than \ncreating\n new creatures. For example, members of \nDidelphimorphia\n almost always appear when the effect is activated within a given species' geographic range, while the type of mammals attracted in areas outside these regions may become much more broadly applied in terms of genetic or phenotypic similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor \ncrame erret\n consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do \ncoi lorete\n tempor \ncoincid ranci\n ut labore et dolore \nmagma\n aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n Heats any nearby igneous rock, or any objects and materials directly derived from such rock, to a temperature slightly more than that given mineral\u2019s melting point over a period of about 15 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Impacted area of the primary effect expands, running from approximately 13 meters to 45 meters as the reader progresses.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Once the maximum temperature is reached, the heat from the affected material begins to dissipate at normal rates based on non-anomalous physical properties of the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem \ninfernum\n dolor sit amet, consectetur \nadipsting helit\n, sed do \nasmodeus\n tempor \nincidia duture aboret\n dolore magna aliqua\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\nA Sheol-class\n5\n demonic entity manifests.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n The longer one reads, the longer the entity remains in baseline reality.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Experimentation shows that if proper thaumaturgic defenses are applied, the summoned entity will be bound in a similar manner as more traditional rituals; however, this must be done \nprior\n to SCP-6094-3 activation as the spell itself does nothing to bind or otherwise contain the entity, only summon it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOremlay ipsumyay olorday\n sit amet, \nonsecteturcay\n adipiscing elit, sed do \neiusmodyay emportay\n incididunt ut labore et \noloreday agnamay\n aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n Any human within a radius of approximately 12 meters will begin to undergo targeted alterations to some physical feature or features in such a way as to more closely resemble the features of members of the \nSus\n genus.\n6\n Such alterations will appropriate existing body parts and tissue as needed, and have been reported to be extremely painful. Examples of porcine physical features and traits generated by SCP-6094-13 include:\n\n\n\n\nPointening of the ears\n\n\nFlattening of the nose to resemble a snout\n\n\nModification of hands and/or feet into hoof-like structures\n\n\nGrowth of small and sometimes curled tail\n\n\nThe development of \u201ctusks\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Increasingly drastic or consequential physical alterations in affected subjects.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Similar porcine features can be approximated through different mechanisms from iteration to iteration. For example, the development of tusk-like protrusions usually involves the splitting of the jaw at the middle and the outward shift of each side through the remains of the mouth along with the shedding of the bottom teeth; however, one experiment resulted instead in a subject removing two of their own ribs (apparently under involuntary compulsion) and placing the broken ends in each side of their mouth, where they then fused to the surrounding tissue in the back of the mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem \nipsio umo\n dolor sit \naspectus et audio\n piscing elit, sed do eiusmod \nrecordum incident\n ut labore \neto rexoma gana\n aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n The nearest other SCP-6094 instance, regardless of version, gains a secondary anomalous effect which gives control of device camera and microphone in order to record effects of future activation.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Unknown, if any.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Brief periods of testing and external monitoring protocols quickly appeared to confirm the effects to act largely as described by PoI-6094 in recovered BlackHatSorcery threads as underlined in Addendum 6094.03.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6094.02: Investigation into Origins of SCP-6094\n\n\n\n\nResearch into the origins of SCP-6094 eventually led to the discovery of relevant posts by an individual posting under the user ID \"ModernMagicModder\" on the deep web forum \"BlackHatSorcery\", which is primarily geared towards discussions, guides, and broader developments regarding techno-thaumaturgical practices; especially in regard to usage in conducting various criminal and illicit activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirmation of the veracity of the connections to SCP-6094 and related claims made by the user known as ModernMagicModder took major investments of time, manpower, and technical resources. Two specialized Deep-web crawlers and one specialized AI construct were irreparably damaged and ultimately decommissioned due to various defensive wards, glyphs, and rituals, (as well as at least one advanced but ultimately non-anomalous virus) embedded within the site to deter and/or disable any outside scrutiny.\n\n\nAfter twenty-four days of attempts to clandestinely access the forum meeting varying levels of success, enough evidence was gathered to establish with a significant level of confidence the direct involvement of ModernMagicModder in the creation and dissemination of SCP-6094; they have been designated Person-of-Interest 6094 (PoI-6094) as a result.\n\n\nThough little is yet known about the identity or personal background of PoI-6094, some important facts and information about their abilities and motivation in creating SCP-6094 have been gleaned from the accessed forum posts and comments. Relevant Samples are included below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackHatSorcery posts\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a representative sample of relevant conversations involving screened and modified-as-needed to remove or neutralize any latent thaumaturgic hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0April\u00a010\u00a0forum\u00a0posts\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nHey all, kinda been workin on a new idea for spells, and could use some feedback lol\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nWow MMM ur always so frustratingly vague or bafflingly specific but never inbetween\u2026.##\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nAnd I see our criticism is as unconstructive as ever, TT. Obviously, I was gonna get to the detail very shortly\u2026 Anyway, I've been playin around with some standard online hidden-hex type shit, just doin some research and all, when I mistyped a URL and came to this undeveloped webpage. Basically just a few paragraphs and broken links.\n\n\nNow, the paragraphs were all that broken-Latin filler wording, but w my mind being where it was, I didn\u2019t even realize I was on the wrong page at 1st and thought it was some archaic spells lol. I quickly realized the truth ofc, but it gave me an idea. If even a pro like me can get that crap mixed up with spells, maybe I could actually turn it into one! Or five, or fifty\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nlol \u201cPRO like me\u201d Good one.\n\n\n\n\nOW stop that\n\n\n\n\niOfNewt_1313\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nHaha hey, that\u2019s what you get for wagering a voodoo doll of yourself last month and losing, dumbass\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be gone by now, we agreed only two weeks!\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nAnd yet I still have it. Weird, huh.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, back to my devious epiphany. People already use multiple versions of Lorem Ipsum (thats what its called) all the time, so I\u2019m pretty sure that if I could generate a \u201cspell\u201d or a few that just \nlook\n to casual passersby, search engines, and maybe even magic-detection software like normal run-of-the-mill placeholder text.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nOk sure maybe, but\u2026 why? What are you even trying to accomplish? How could you make any sort of profit off this?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nNot everything has to be about making money, ThaumaScrooge. Whatever happened to the love of the art, of a fascinating new problem to conquer?\n\n\n\n\niOfNewt_1313\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\nYou just want to magically troll random strangers from the internet, don\u2019t you\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n10/04/2022\n\n\n\u2026It can be both\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0April\u00a013\u00a0forum\u00a0posts\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nOk so I\u2019ve been tinkering around with the mechanics of my Lorem ipsum spells idea.

Look at you Tom, being helpful for once.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nWhatever.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I know this seems to mainly be for the simple sake of noble curiosity (read: shits and giggles) but its especially important to consider this then; how violent or destructive are you willing to go?\n\n\n\n\nModertnMagicModder\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nModerately, I'd say. I\u2019m not on this forum because I\u2019m overly-hesitant to break eggs if I want me an omelet, but I also don\u2019t see a need for putting innocent people in like, GRATUITOUS danger.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, I think in most cases I'm more likely to meet my logistical limits before my ethical ones\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nSo summoning a demon, for example, might be a bit much?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nFun as that would be, one could argue so.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nWhat if you just did a weak one, like an imp or something\n\n\n\n\nDid you seriously just pat my voodoo doll on the head?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nThat was another Good Idea! You\u2019re being a very good boy.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nWow. Just don\u2019t do it that hard next time.\n\n\n\n\nWTF THAT DID NOT MEAN DO IT HARDER\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nGod I love the dark arts.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0April\u00a019\u00a0forum\u00a0posts\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nOk so I\u2019ve been doing my research on how to craft my new spells, seeing how to really Lorum some Ipsums, if you will. Newt and two IRL colleagues of mine already helped check my work and agreed to join in the ritual, and we are pretty sure we have one that will work without requiring participants to be in the same location! They do need to exist in the first place tho, so I\u2019ma need some volunteers.\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nI will!\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nHow much you offering?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nIsn\u2019t being at the forefront of a small but very real, very novel development in the thaumaturgic arts payment enough, Tom?\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nLol of course not. So how much?\n\n\n\n\nJesus STOP, tell you what I\u2019ll do for free if you either send back or SAFELY decommission the doll.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nHmmm. Interesting offer. How about $200 instead?\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nNope. Doll or nothin.\n\n\n\n\nAH Damnit, are you fr? Also, using it again right now doesn\u2019t really make me want to change my mind you know!\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nI thought you guys agreed to like a week or two, MMM still has that Tom-doll?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nWell yeah\u2026 Ok see when I bound the doll, I technically set the enchantment for \ntwo weeks of available use\n, not \navailable for use over two weeks.\n So the clock kinda pauses indefinitely whenever I\u2019m not actively poking it, or hitting it against a table or whatever.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n13/04/2022\n\n\nWAIT WHAT\n\n\n\n\nMerlinFromBerlin87\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nHey so I\u2019ve just been lurkin so far lol, but I\u2019d be happy to help!\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n19/04/2022\n\n\nGreat, that makes six! It\u2019ll be midnight GST on Wednesday, I\u2019ll DM you and Arc the Discord invites. Never mind Tom, we have enough, thanks anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 02/06/2022:\n Continued clandestine monitoring of the BlackHatSorcery deep-web forum identified by Foundation agents identified a then-ongoing conversation between PoI-6094 and other members of the site, wherein they appear to realize Foundation involvement in ongoing containment and suppression of SCP-6094 and resulting incidents of anomalous activity. The following transcript was retrieved and is included below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0June\u00a02\u00a0forum\u00a0posts\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nSooooo bit of a problem. Remember how I mentioned last week Merlin and Newt helped me develop another Lorem Ipsum spell that acts on the other spells, and that basically adds a virus-type property to the spell to give me access to any device webcams so I can watch the results in real-time?\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nWait, I don\u2019t remember this actually. Why would you not just do a regular working on all the spells at once? Why craft another Lipsum spell?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nWell I was doing something similar for each spell activation one at a time at first, but it turns out that that is hard and both time- and energy-consuming. Doing them all at once would be exponentially harder. First off, there's not a similar connection; getting a normal type of thaumic act to affect a different/ \u2018unlike\u2019 act is already a big ask, but when you consider how \nWonderfully\n successful my spells have been so far at spreading far and wide, it\u2019d be almost impossible.\n\n\n\n\nIf I narrowed it down to just a few spells at a time though, I\u2019d still have to do a separate re-cast every time, and I don\u2019t have the time, money, or manpower for that lol. Buuuut If I craft one big new single spell within the same class as the spells its affecting, then not only is it use less energy to make, I also don't have to recast it since its self-propagating!\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nHow do you actually view the videos though?\n\n\n\n\nMerlinFromBerlin87\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nWe just made the effect that every time someone activates the new spell by reading it, it enables the nearest spell of any other type that\u2019s loaded on a page to also commandeer the webcam and mic of the hosting device!\n\n\n\n\nIt just starts recording whenever the modified spell is activated, and then sends the footage of the following few minutes to MMM\u2019s phone.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nYep! Honestly it's been a fun couple weeks for the most part. You haven't lived until you watch a possum piss on a businessman's laptop in Starbucks while a raccoon pulls out the guy's wallet as he's too angrily distracted to notice.\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nAmazing\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nYeah\u2026 ngl tho, theyre not all quite as whimsical. Imps turn out to be a little more clever than I gave them credit for, for example, and the pig thing\u2026\n\n\n\n\nI might have overpowered the pig one, I'll just leave it at that.\n\n\n\n\nOh right, but the new issue! So I was catching up on some submissions like half an hour ago, and saw this:\n\n\n\n\n[VIDEO DELETED]\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nOh shit, take that down NOW\n\n\n\n\nPretty sure those are the Jailors, the uniforms and the logo looks like they're from one of their superpowered SWAT team emblems.\n\n\n\n\nYou do not want to be posting videos if they're involved, just firing a metaphorical flare gun into the virtual sky for their crawlers and clairvoyants to notice like you\u2019re trying to broadcast \u201cHEEEY I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND IM UP TO SOMETHING\u201d\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nI think you might have lost the thread on that metaphor, Robert Frost. And who are the jailors, exactly?\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nDELETE THE VIDEO and then I\u2019ll tell you.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nJeez alright there. Happy?\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nCloser, at least. The jailors are kind of like\u2026 Tryna think of how to describe them.\n\n\n\n\nThey're like NWO-level super-cops for anything paranormal, extraterrestrial, extradimensional, etc., including magic/thaumaturgy.\n\n\n\n\nBasically anything or anyone who poses a threat to larger society\u2019s blissful ignorance of the weirder parts of reality, they want to suppress all activity and info about them and then lock it in a cage, literal or metaphorical.\n\n\n\n\nMerlinFromBerlin87\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nOOOOH wait I know who you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re right! Never heard \u2018em called jailors before tho\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nOh sorry, that\u2019s the nickname the \ngroup I used to run with\n always called them. Nomenclature isn\u2019t really the big issue here though\n\n\n\n\nArcane_Arca9\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nEven if there checking this deep in the deep web, do you really think they could get past all this site's defenses?\n\n\n\n\nMerlinFromBerlin87\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nImmediately? Probably not. Eventually? Probably, if they reeeally tried. They do have some top-notch collaborationist mages.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nYeah, opressing tbeir kind for who-knows-what twisted reasons. Probably money.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless, if they\u2019re responding this quickly to the aftermath of MMM\u2019s little project\u2026 Well I (don't really) hate to say it, but you might be fucked.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nOK well as usual, I\u2019m both optimistic and brazenly out of my element here, so I need you peeps to tell me everything you know so I can get out of this little pickle.\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nOh now that the wicked witch has become the damsel in distress, I\u2019m supposed to risk my own skin helping YOU?\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nI mean we both have access to your skin, remember?\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nDo you mean\u2026\n\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t be serious.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, Tommy boy.\n\n\n\n\nTell you what though, as a sign of gratitude and quasi-respect (and also to ensure you don\u2019t sabotage me), I\u2019ll decommission your doll once trouble blows over. That\u2019s about 13.4 days of usage left that I\u2019m graciously agreeing to surrender\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nJesus\u2026\n\n\n\n\nAlright, but ONLY if you agree to promise to not use it anymore even until then. And I mean I want all this im a full-on, hardcore binding pact.\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nGreat! It\u2019s settled then, and I\u2019ll stop using the doll\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThaumaTom\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to help you in your time of need.\n\n\n\n\nOOW WHAT THE HELL YOU FUCKER!!!\n\n\n\n\nModernMagicModder\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\n\u2026Staaaarting now!\n\n\n\n\nMerlinFromBerlin87\n\n\n02/06/2022\n\n\nUm heya pals, maaaybe we should take any further discussion to an even more discrete venue? One with less of a direct trail in case these Men in Black types or whatever IS eventually able to worm its way in here?\n\n\n\n\nOh and also, delete this entire thread immediately, of course. I'm gonna go alert the mods too.\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n As the Foundation had already surpassed the heavy security measures (anomalous and non-anomalous) and encryption to infiltrate the BlackHatSorcery forums, live-monitoring agents were able to transcribe this last thread in real-time before it could be deleted.\n8\n Other threads even tangentially related or alluding to SCP-6094 activity on the forums were quickly deleted as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6094.03: New Versions\n\n\n\n\nFrom June 7 to June 10, 2022, the Foundation discovered that at least four new versions of SCP-6094 have been introduced and have begun to propagate. The first instances of each were discovered within less than four hours of each other. Unlike most of the initial versions, these new versions of SCP-6094 appear to have been geared toward initiating a much more aggressive spread of SCP-6094 as a whole, and/or obfuscating Foundation efforts at suppressing its influence. A description and partial segment for each new iteration, gleaned from a mix of initial D-class test runs and external incident monitoring, is given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u25b7\u00a0View\u00a0Breakdown\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew versions of SCP-6094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem \nipi sussum\n dolor \nasitam\n, consectetur elit \nod des gnicsipida\n, eiusmod tempor incididunt \net lobore ut dalore\n magna aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n Scrambles words and numbers on any open pages, random files, and even underlying code from the device from which the instance is read from into nonsensical configurations.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n More files and programs are affected as a reader progresses farther through the text.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n It appears that the SCP-6094 instance itself is the only type of text which never appears to be subject to mutation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem \nGypsum\n dolor sit\nmeta\n , consectetur adipiscing, sed do eiu \nodom tempora\n incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n Causes another, seemingly random version of SCP-6094 to appear as a physical new instance via writing carved out of the nearest source of concrete.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Unknown, if any.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Whether the resulting instance maintains anomalous activation effects is inconsistent, but appears to largely depend on which version generates. For example, SCP-6094-2 appearances have maintained their effects in 95% of recorded instances, while SCP-6094-22 has only been successfully activated once.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor \nsite\n amet, \nconnect et url\n adipiscing elit, sed do \neusi modo\n tempor incididunt ut labore et \ndolorem aqina\n aliqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n Makes readers develop a strong urge to immediately create or develop websites devoted to a particular passion or interest they already hold. Those with insufficient technical skill or background in such projects will usually seek out online courses related to beginner-level web development first. Though the subjects that these new websites are dedicated to vary wildly from creator to creator, these individuals will always place instances of both SCP-6094-24 as well as of some other SCP-6094 version.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n Duration of compulsions, ranging from approximately three hours to as long as \nfive weeks\n ten days.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n Upkeep of web pages created under the influence of SCP-6094-24 appears to be rare once the effect has worn off, though not unheard of. One affected individual continually recreated close variations of their previous site each time Foundation web-crawlers took it down.\n10\n\n\nWhile initially believed to be under prolonged anomalous compulsive effects, it is now believed that the individual had simply been recreating the sites out of sheer stubbornness using consistently updated backups, as a one-time shift in tactics to simple removing only the SCP-6094 instances for three days before finally taking down the whole site again saw the individual\u2019s subsequent version no longer contained any SCP-6094 instances.\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6094-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor \ncoit\n amet, \nconsect eturca\n adipiscing elit, sed do \ndisseminare et indicator of data\n labore et dolore \nmagnalqua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Effects:\n [REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\nProgression Effects:\n [REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n [REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the inherent and increasing risk of continued experimentation, all further testing has been suspended indefinitely, and phenomenological research should be refocused solely to external incidents.\n\n\nAdditionally, as of June 9, 2022, Foundation researchers and software have lost access to BlackHatSorcery deep web forums. Additional staff and resources have been assigned to assist in bypassing the presumably upgraded cybersecurity and thaumaturgical defenses of the site, as well as to bolster efforts more broadly in investigating, identifying, and eventually apprehending PoI-6094.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Likewise, at least five unique, separate programs are to be used jointly to review and verify portions of all relevant text at any given time, in order to prevent inadvertent activation of any SCP-6094 instances from individual readings of a quarter or more if constituent text.\n\n\n2\n. Individual versions are sub-designated numerically, starting with SCP-6094-1 and increasing based on the chronological order of their respective discovery by the Foundation.\n\n\n3\n. The first sentences alone are not sizable enough portions in any known version to initiate anomalous effects without further progression.\n\n\n4\n. Commonly known as possums or opossums.\n\n\n5\n.
