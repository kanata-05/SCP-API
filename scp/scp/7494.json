SCP-7494 must be stored in a room without windows, or otherwise completely covered from sunlight when not testing. Testing with SCP-7494 must be approved by at least one Site-28 Level \n2\n 4 researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7494 is a small sculpture weighing 421g and measuring 7.9cm x 7.1cm x 8.7cm at its longest, widest, and tallest points respectively. It is entirely made of \nguan\u00edn\n1\n beryllium bronze. The hollow sculpture seems to abstractly depict the [DATA EXPUNGED] with four hollow eye sockets, and [DATA EXPUNGED] while exhibiting bilateral symmetry at a vertical bisection.\n\n\nAcquisition\n\n\nSCP-7494 was obtained by the Foundation from an art merchant, S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in Poland who was attempting to sell it to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd on behalf of Gra\u017cyna Kulczyk, a well known Polish art collector. The merchant described SCP-7494 as a zemi\n2\n of the Ta\u00edno\n3\n, originally found in a cave in the jungle, El Yunque, in Puerto Rico.\n\n\nIt is in a notably different style than other zemi sculptures, suggesting it may not be of Ta\u00edno origin or further, that it is anachronistic. In sunlight of at least 500 lumens SCP-7494 reflects the light at approximately double the brightness. This reflection is in concentrated beams of 2.2cm in diameter (the size of each eye socket). The reflection continues to shine light for four seconds after the light source has been removed (or the angle diverted), diminishing in intensity over said duration. This effect can be replicated with sufficient ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n\nThe art merchant claimed it was cursed, which was a highly unusual claim for them and so the veracity of the sculpture\u2019s origin came into question, causing it to gain traction in media. This traction was noticeably suppressed, presumably by Marshall, Carter, and Dark. This was picked up by Mobile Task Force Mu-3 \"Highest Bidders\" (MTF M-3) who investigated these claims and subsequently recovered SCP-7494. The merchant was questioned and SCP-7494 was obtained from them after administering Class-A amnestics. The merchant claimed SCP-7494 was watching and, at moments, speaking to them in a language they did not understand, yet they strongly felt it was giving them a curse because it was taken from indigenous lands. The merchant was convinced they must return it to the Puerto Rico to lift the curse. Further research has shown that the same phrase is heard by every subject under the effects of SCP-7494, and there is no connection found to the merchant's claims of a supposed curse.\n\n\nWaking Dream\n\n\nSCP-7494's primary anomalous effects manifest when someone holding SCP-7494 causes the eye socket reflection of sunlight to occur. The subject, hereto referred to as SCP-7494-1, hears a Ta\u00edno phrase which has been difficult to translate. It likely translates to \u201cWill/may I make [the] clouds/skies surround/encircle [the] setting sun, that you will/may not see [the] sunset\u201d. If SCP-7494-1 accepts this offer, they enter into the \u201cwaking dream\u201d trance. This acceptance can be in seemingly any language and can even simply be thought. SCP-7494-1 can accept the offer regardless of if they understood the language of the offer. SCP-7494\u2019s light fades over the course of four seconds as SCP-7494-1\u2019s eyes begin to emit the same light in more focused beams at the size of their pupils. After the transfer of light is complete, SCP-7494-1 performs rapid eye movements (REM) with open eyes, continuing to produce light. SCP-7494-1 remains in this trance for seven minutes and twenty four seconds. During this time SCP-7494-1 remains in their position and does not respond to stimuli. SCP-7494-1 can be moved, although with effort as their posture is rigid, similarly found in those under certain hypnotic trances. Taking SCP-7494 away from SCP-7494-1 has no effect. However, SCP-7494 will not anomalously reflect light until SCP-7494-1 has exited their trance. When exiting the trance, SCP-7494-1 instances have unreliable memory of their experience, similar to recalling a dream.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-7494-1 have all described a similar experience after exiting their trance. SCP-7494-1 is blinded by the bright light from SCP-7494 and then it fades as they enter into the area of their waking dream, hereto referred to as the dreamscape. They awake at the base of a rocky hill with a dirt and gravel path leading up. This dreamscape is described to be a vast valley enclosed with mountainous terrain. It is a relatively small area that SCP-7494-1 instances are confined to, and it is unknown whether this is the entirety of this dreamscape or a small part of it. The light source is always a setting sun over the valley and the sky is filled with stratus clouds of a dark yellow hue. Sometimes birds are seen flying around but only in the unreachable distance. One subject expressed having seen this dreamscape before. It was then verified by all subsequent observers as the depiction of a painting titled \nGate\n by Polish painter Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski. It is believed that the painter had somehow been a SCP-7494-1 instance himself. The \u201cGate\u201d, as depicted in the painting, has a sentient intelligence, hereto referred to as SCP-7494-2.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2 has a vertically long face with a general lack of facial features save for a mouth and large hollow sockets with no eyes. While not speaking, SCP-7494-2 is in a resting neutral expression. While speaking, SCP-7494-2 moves its stone lips and has human facial expressions as it speaks. Despite SCP-7494-2\u2019s enormous size and regardless of distance, its voice is always at a comfortable volume and sounds like that of a normal human. Specifically, its voice is that of an older man with an accent seemingly from London, England during the mid 1900s, but in the respective native language of SCP-7494-1 (still retaining the accent). SCP-7494-2 always addresses SCP-7494-1 instances and invites them further in the dreamscape. SCP-7494-2 treats SCP-7494-1 as a guest. It is important to note that the dreamscape affects the passage of time experienced by instances of SCP-7494-1. The experience in no way correlates to the time they actually spend in the trance and reportedly lasts variably longer with some lasting for numerous hours.\n\n\nAfter polite greetings and introductions, SCP-7494-2 will ask the SCP-7494-1 instance if they would like to play a game of their choice, as long as it is a game that can be played with two players and does not require a mobile body, as SCP-7494-2 is immobile. SCP-7494-2 prefers board games the most and has only ever declined pop culture referencing games and word games, especially when used to try and gain personal information. When a game is decided on, SCP-7494-2 directs SCP-7494-1 to behind one of the many rectangular carved stones where that exact game will happen to be found. The game is always in perfectly playable condition, but is noticeably old. SCP-7494-1 will then set up the game on a stone slab. SCP-7494-2 is able to manipulate the game remotely in order to play it. If SCP-7494-2 has not played the game before it becomes eager to learn it and provides all that might be necessary to do so. SCP-7494-2 is slow to learn, but very attentive and asks questions with an earnest desire to learn. SCP-7494-2 has even been able to provide, learn, and play video games when those are chosen. However, it will decline first person shooters or anything that depicts graphic violence.\n\n\nThe vast majority of SCP-7494-1 instances stated that they had a genuinely good time playing with SCP-7494-2 and described it as a good sport. It has been noted that SCP-7494-2's favorite game is Senet (with a certain set of rules it insists on using), which it is exceedingly good at. SCP-7494-2 rivals the level of masters at Chess and Mahjong, and it quickly became skilled at the video game \nAge of Mythology\n. In contrast, SCP-7494-2 has expressed that no matter how much it practices, it has never been able to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube and thus they make it very frustrated.\n\n\nAfter a game is chosen, or denied (which SCP-7494-2 finds to be rude), SCP-7494-2 asks why SCP-7494-1 accepted the offer to change their past. It is subsequently discussed how SCP-7494-1 would change their past while SCP-7494-2 makes authoritative decisions on whether or not it would allow such changes. If SCP-7494-2 denies changes, it offers suggestions it would allow. The exact criteria SCP-7494-2 uses is not well understood, but it seems it believes it is behaving benevolently. SCP-7494-2 is decisive in these denials and has not as of yet changed its mind on any denials. When a final decision is made SCP-7494-2 will finish any ongoing game and then say a farewell to SCP-7494-1. SCP-7494-2\u2019s hollow eye sockets will glow with light until it obscures SCP-7494-1\u2019s vision. SCP-7494-1 will then awaken from their trance.\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nUpon exiting the trance, SCP-7494-1 instances usually report new memories of their past. They allege a past life that was apparently changed by SCP-7494-2\u2019s agreement. They will report having been transported into a moment in their past with knowledge of their future. They allege they made the changes agreed upon with SCP-7494-2. They believe these changes are new, having left the existence of their previous life as just a memory. This is despite having described their life in the same way both before and after interacting with SCP-7494. Investigations into the life of a SCP-7494-1 instance both before and after interacting with SCP-7494 report no changes. However, these investigations were made difficult due to SCP-7494-1 instances always having hazy unreliable memories of their alleged past life and time within the dreamlike trance. Despite subjects acknowledging this, they will staunchly believe these memories to be true. At psychological debriefing, SCP-7494-1 instances do not have any new mental issues. In fact, they tend to have a more positive outlook on their life with a marked improvement in overall mood. The reason behind SCP-7494 incepting these false memories is not understood.\n\n\nOne D-Class and several agents were cycled through entering SCP-7494's dreamscape in order to collect information on SCP-7494-2. After initial info was collected, special Agent L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Graph of MTF \u03b6-7 (\u201cTotal Recall\u201d) was chosen to question SCP-7494-2 as he has undergone exposure to \nSCP-868\n4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7494-Graph Interview\n\n\n7494-Graph Debrief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Graph was briefed and became an SCP-7494-1 instance. Here is a transcript as he described it.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Graph awoke within SCP-7494\u2019s domain. SCP-7494-2 was in the distance, approximately 500 meters away. Despite this distance, SCP-7494-2 sounded as if it was a comfortable speaking distance away and it could hear Agent Graph at his normal speaking volume as well.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Well you're a sight for my sore eyes. Come along then, you know it's not as far as it looks.\n\n\nAgent Graph proceeded at a brisk walking pace that seemed to move him forward much faster than it should have until he was approximately 50 meters away from SCP-7494-2.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Hello SCP-7494-2, I am Agent Graph with the SCP Foundation. I am here to ask you some questions. Are you okay with that?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n \u201cAgent\u201d? How professional. (\npauses\n) A rather queer thing to do, naming someone else, and a very queer name to give to anyone. Whatever does it mean?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n It is the designation we at the Foundation have assigned to you. It has no meaning besides a unique connection to our records. Is there a name you would prefer?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n (\nchuckles\n) Well of course, I would prefer mine own. Without it, who would I be?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n And what is your name then?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Archibald. My name is Archibald, how do you do?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Alright Archibald, may I ask you some questions?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n You may, but before we begin, how about a game? Dealer's choice.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Is playing a game necessary?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n No it is not. I simply enjoy a good game.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Fine. How about chess?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Chess it is then. You can find it over there.\n\n\nAgent Graph has the exact locative knowledge implanted into his mind and thus walks over to a large rectangular stone slab in which a wood carved chess game is found packed neatly inside a foldable wooden chess board. It is worn with use but nothing is missing or heavily damaged. Agent graph sets up the chess game on a stone slab close to SCP-7494-2.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n What is your connection to the sculpture we have designated as SCP-7494? It depicts the [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nAgent Graph proceeded to describe the sculpture in detail.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I am aware of its existence and the connection it has to me by bringing dreamers to me. It was fashioned by the handsome artist Macocael. Who had desperately wanted to change his past, and he did. Before you ask, yes there are other such things that have been made. And no, I will not tell you of them.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n How is it you anticipated my question? Are you aware of my inner thoughts?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n No Agent Graph, I simply know your kind.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n And what kind is that?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n The vehemently inquisitive.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n What is the criteria in which you allow or deny the changes of one's past?\n\n\nAs Agent Graph says the previous line SCP-7494-2 is heard saying \u201cspeaking of\u2026\u201d under his breath.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n A good question indeed Agent Graph. Do you perhaps have academics in your lineage? Given your unique name.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I am unsure on the origin of my surname. Please stay on subject.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I see. It is fate that decides through me, I certainly have no part in it.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Do you know a single thing about the process?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Taking such an accusatory tone is unbecoming of you mister professional agent man. I am not being deceitful. Fate decides the criteria.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n You were omitting information by not telling me you know the criteria even though this knowledge comes from fate.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I was politely giving you the information I am willing to give. My apologies. (\npauses\n) It is difficult to describe. I simply know certain things, by the way of feeling as well as mine own wisdom.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n You decide who can alter their history by gut feeling?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n (\nsighs\n) There\u2019s that tone again. No. It is not such a simple \u2018gut feeling\u2019 as you put it. I don\u2019t have a gut to feel in the first place. I know things by ways that are ineffable.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Alright. Can you describe any of these people for me please?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Yes, they are all dreamers, like you. Many of them become time travelers through me. Every time traveler I have ever encountered, save one, has always been in a hurry and it confuses and amuses me to no end. How could you be in a hurry, when you are about to travel through time? The whole point of hurrying is due to not being able to time travel in the first place. But alas, their sense of urgency or perhaps excitement or impatience always gets the better of them.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Which one wasn\u2019t in a hurry?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Pardon?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n You said \u2018save one\u2019, who was the one that was not in a hurry?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Oh right, she was a well educated woman, and seemed very experienced in the weird, yet had no idea of my existence until first arriving here. It was a rather odd experience for the both of us, it seems, as I had previously always felt the wisest person in the room, but not with her. However, I feel as if I should not talk so much about the specifics of others I have had personal conversations with, especially to people like you. So, I will stop right there. I hope you understand.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Have there been any visitors that were not human?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n There was a cat that spoke to me, but didn\u2019t say anything out of the ordinary. And Macocael of course.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Wait, so what was Macocael?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n As I said, he was a handsome artist. He was similar in shape of humans but \nfairer\n. He had decided to go against his \u2018superiors\u2019, as they were. A noble deed, which someone like you could never understand. (\npauses\n) I believe I have this match Agent Graph.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Yes you win.\n\n\nAgent Graph concedes by tipping over his king piece\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Any other non-humans?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Not that I know for certain. All my other visitors, besides that one cat and also the birds that already live here, have all appeared as human as you. Although many times they have acted abnormally.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Any of those abnormal people stand out to you?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Well, now that you mention it, yes. One seemed to have no interest in my offer. The man, who was wearing a dapper suit I might add, refused to get very near me as he described me having been guarded by ghouls. When I insisted there were obviously no ghouls near me and in fact the two of us were the only ones there, he described the ghouls specifically stating their black skin and then went on about how much he detested the skin. He described them in disturbing ways of which I have no intention of repeating. It was so detestable that I cast him out in a poof of mist. First time I learned I could do that. You wouldn\u2019t happen to have a phobia of black skinned people or see any ghoulish folk around here, would you?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n (\ngestures to himself\n) I obviously wouldn\u2019t have any phobia of black people, no. And no, I see no other people here at all, or ghouls.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Pardon, if I may be the questioner now, but why would that be so obvious?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Because I\u2019m black.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Pardon me once again, but I must most assuredly point out that your skin is clearly a shade of brown.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n(\nsighs\n) I\u2019d rather not have to explain to you the complexities of humanity\u2019s race issues.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n (\nchuckles\n) Well now you're acting like a time traveler. Do you fear to run out of time here?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Now, have you ever allowed someone into their past who obviously wanted to change said past in a way that would affect others?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Well that was rude. You ignored my question.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I assumed it was rhetorical.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n It was. Still rude to ignore it.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Fine. No, I\u2019m not afraid to run out of time. I would just rather not explain the subject in question.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n (\nsarcastically\n) After I\u2019ve gone and answered all your questions, hmm? Well, fair enough. Where were we?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Have you allowed someone into their past who to change said past in a way that would affect others?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Right! Thank you. Yes, on a few occasions, I have allowed it.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n And what were their goals?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I don\u2019t feel too comfortable sharing most of them with you, to be honest. I will say that one of them simply wanted to make sure an artist was denied admission into the art school they were professing at. I found that one rather interesting indeed, as they were horribly affected by the nuisance the student had become, despite them having been so kind to offer him study in the first place. So yes, that one affected the art student who had no say in this decision, but I had decided to allow it. After all, art is subjective. I\u2019m sure he continued on in his own way.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Have you met any other SCP Foundation members or anyone who mentioned the SCP Foundation?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Well yes of course, they were you, specifically the you before you changed your past to become who you are now. It is interesting to me because you did not notice it. I was surprised, to say the least. This has never happened before.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Impossible. I don\u2019t recall any of that. How long ago was this?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Oh not too far along ago there. But then again I am very patient. \u2018The devil dictates when you hurry\u2019. An old painter taught me that phrase.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Perhaps things don\u2019t work chronologically here. Did I appear different than I do now?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Yes Agent Graph, quite a bit different indeed. Your voice was gruff and your face was too. Your hair was longer and unkempt, but I am sure of it. It was you. You were no agent, either, simply L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Graph.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n What exactly did I do the last time you saw me?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n We had introductions and played a game of Stratego, I think you were more honest about your pick that time. You were actually having some fun in the game, to which you won, I might add. Despite your gruffness, you were much more patient and polite.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Did you offer to change my past?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Yes, I asked and we talked of what you might want to change and you revealed that you were something called a \u2018D-Class\u2019 at the Foundation. You wanted to change that and I did not blame you, of course. They seem to be treated rather unfairly.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n (\ninterrupts\n) They are D-Class due to having been found guilty and put on death row.\n\n\n(\npause\n)\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n The D-Class \u2018you\u2019 did not think of it as fair. Feel free to argue with yourself. Anyway, where was I\u2026 (\npauses\n) Oh yes. You revealed to me that, years ago, you had committed the rather serious crime of murder. However, the target of your violence was deserving of it as you were defending your sister from being assaulted. Unfortunately, the way in which it all occurred had left you with no evidence besides you and your sister\u2019s witness accounts. Also, this would-be assailant was the son of a rich and influential family.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n (\ninterrupts\n) The Sweagles.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n The very same. And so, it did not go your way in court. You were unjustly found guilty. Through ways ineffable, I understood you were in the right and the jurisprudence of the land had failed you. So yes, I allowed you into your past to change such things. It seems you also kept your knowledge of the Foundation and decided to get a better role this time around.\n\n\nThere is a long pause. Agent Graph notes he was thinking.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n This is very confusing.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Indeed. This place has worked the same for all my visitors, save you, Agent Graph. I myself have wondered why it is none can visit me twice. You, or perhaps your Foundation, have done something to change this. I wonder if it will continue this way.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n This place, we call it a \u2018dreamscape\u2019, what is it exactly? Is it extradimensional, or perhaps a physical place on Earth, but secluded somehow?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n It is a beautiful valley. It is my home. Beyond that, I have no answers, as I prefer not to be interfered with by your Foundation.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n What is your origin? Were you human once?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I was never human, no. As for my origin, that is a rather dangerous thing to ask those of my kind. However, you are lucky I am the kinder of my kind and know your kind, in kind. (\npauses with a smug smile\n) I am and have always been Archibald. No it is not my surname, nor is it my given name. It is simply mine. Although it was once more properly pronounced Eorcenbald [\u02c8e\u035cor\u02e0k.\u0251n.b\u0254\u02d0ld], if you will excuse my prescriptivism. In your tongue it might literally translate to \u201cgenuinely bold\u201d or perhaps \u201cboldly genuine\u201d; I\u2019m preferential to the latter myself, yet it is still a gross understatement of who I am. And as one of you dreamers pointed out, I am also quite physically an arch. Funny how that turned out. How about you then, L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Graph?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n We humans have no such focus on our names. My origin is the United States of America; right in the boring middle area. I was born to a mother and father of lower class standing in a bland suburb between rural and city. It is all unremarkable up until I became an agent at the Foundation. I now have the remarkable ability of perfect recall.\n\n\nAgent Graph was later reprimanded for revealing this.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Ahh, it seems this is why you grade things so harshly on a scale of remark. For everything you remark is forever remembered. It must get rather frustrating to be cursed with curiosity.\n\n\n(\npause\n)\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n That old painter, the one who taught you the phrase \u2018The devil dictates when you hurry\u2019, was he Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Indeed it was him, although you are butchering his name. Perhaps now you are the one reading my mind, hmm?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I know because he painted you, in this place. It is somewhat famous.\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n Well how wonderful! Perchance I shall see it one day. (\nsighs\n) Alas.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n What are you then? You said \u201cthose of my kind\u201d, so who are they?\n\n\nSCP-7494-2:\n I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be answering your last question. I have left that all behind me and prefer the company of others, such as humans with your human games. And as much as I enjoyed seeing someone for the second time, I will not offer you a second change to your past. So I bid you farewell, Agent Graph.\n\n\nAgent Graph sees a bright light emanate from SCP-7494-2\u2019s eye sockets until he can no longer see. Agent Graph then wakes up from his trance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward: Debriefing conducted by Dr. N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Singaram, head researcher of SCP-7494 at Site-28. Debrief interview was conducted with Agent L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Graph 16 hours after Agent Graph had recounted his conversation with SCP-7494-2.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Good evening Agent Graph. How are you feeling?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I\u2019m fine Doctor S. I assume you will also tell me you\u2019re fine.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Yes, I wouldn\u2019t want to clog up your memory with pleasantries. So, after recounting your conversation with SCP-7494-2\u2013\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n (\ninterrupts\n) Archibald. His name is Archibald.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Yes, I read your report. Let\u2019s follow standard procedure, with the numeric designations. You had said you now do recall the previous time you supposedly had talked with SCP-7494-2.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Yes, and I also see you have signed the contract to keep me from facing legal charges.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n You should know it\u2019s unnecessary. These memories were implanted\u2013incepted\u2013by SCP-7494. There is no evidence of a previous life you have had, anomalous or not. That is actually why I asked how you felt. I believe 7494 is incepting these memories for a yet unknown memetic effect on the subject.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Listen, we\u2019ve worked together for years now, but I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t know Stratego was my favorite board game when I was younger.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Well you were never involved in game nights.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n My point is, had I not been briefed on Archibald\u2019s favorite games I would have chosen Stratego.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Now isn\u2019t the time to ask to be invited back to game nights; how is this relevant?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n In my memories as a D-Class I chose Stratego as the game to play with Archibald. How would he have known that? He even knew my first name. You don\u2019t even know my first name.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Then it seems 7494, or -2 there within, has some mind reading capabilities.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n He even knew all the details of that bastard who assaulted my sister.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Agent Graph, that did not happen. Those memories were incepted by 7494. You\u2019ve never murdered anyone. You are not guilty of it.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I did kill him.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n You are trusting your memory because it has never failed you since your use of SCP-868. I understand that, but this anomaly is able to confuse your memory in a way that is apparently stronger than 868. Maybe it has circumvented it by the function of memory inception. Your perfect memory is from consolidation into long term memory\u2013right?\u2013by the hypothalamus. So these were simply also consolidated in the same way. 868 may not have been affected at all.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Sure, if those memories were incepted, then that all makes sense. But you aren\u2019t understanding me. I killed that man. He is dead, currently.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n The Foundation does background checks, especially extensive ones on MTF agents such as yourself, and they would-\n\n\nAgent Graph stands up while slamming the table.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n (\ninterrupts\n) I killed him! I knew exactly what to do and how to do it! This time I made sure there were no witnesses and left no evidence. I killed him before he could even think of assaulting her. I killed him with a [DATA EXPUNGED] and dumped his body [DATA EXPUNGED]. (\npauses\n) You can look it up. To this day he is an unsolved missing persons case. (\npauses\n) I even knew all about the Foundation. I set myself up as the perfect candidate for the MTF unit.\n\n\n(\nsilence\n)\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I killed that man, Doctor S. And I\u2019d do it again- I did! (\nlaughs\n) I did \u201cdo it again\u201d!\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Graph, please calm down.\n\n\nAgent Graph sits back down.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n You\u2019re admitting to murder, now? Premeditated murder based on these implanted memories?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n How do you not- It would have happened, because it did happen but then I went back and prevented it.\n\n\nAgent Graph pantomimes the timeline as he explains it.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n You are an Agent of the Foundation. You are behaving erratically as an anomalous effect of 7494 or a non-anomalous emotional outburst from the anomalous experience. Either way, you need to calm yourself, you are being illogical. Before your interaction with 7494, you still had this same life.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I- (\nsighs\n)\n\n\n(\nAgent Graph stretches his shoulders and leans back in his chair\n)\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Okay, I\u2019m calm.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Maybe you viewed an alternate timeline. That would solve the issue of the basic paradox of not needing to change your life since it was already changed.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n No, cus\u2019 I remember changing things, not just viewing. Is it really illogical to reconcile that this all actually happened?\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n It is inherently paradoxical, and thus illogical to conclude that it happened and more logical to conclude it was an implanted memory, or-or-or an alternate timeline. (\npauses\n) I-I mean-How? How would you have gone back in time and changed your life while not knowing that was your goal?! How were you actively pursuing a goal you were unaware of?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n First: It did not happen like that. Second: An incepted memory is just as anomalous as a paradox.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n No, I don\u2019t think it is.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Oh what, is there a chart for this? Did you get a doctorate in what\u2019s more or less anomalous? How would that even scale?\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n No, none of my multiple doctorates that you don\u2019t have involve that. I am simply stating that it is more understandable for a memory alteration than altering time itself.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I don\u2019t need your doctorates to know that anomalies do not scale by what is understandable to us.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n We are getting nowhere with this. (\npauses\n) You apparently perfectly got away with murder. Let\u2019s say you did. Do you recall having to reconcile being aware of your potential future?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Yes. I knew that my whole life had been carefully calculated up to this point; a lucid dream I knew all the details to. I reconciled it by thinking myself above everyone else. I just thought I was smarter than everyone, with some kind of \u201csuper intuition\u201d.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n That actually seems to follow. But you don\u2019t think that now?\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Yes, correct. I do not. And even if I did, I am out of that lucid dream now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. And you, Doctor S, I remember what you told me when I was a D-Class. You promised me freedom, but I thought\u2013knew, really\u2013by the way you said it, it was a lie. Despite that, I still had hope. Do you lie to all the D-Class like that?\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n We need them to be compliant. You know this. The D-Class are in D for a reason.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n And I was in there for the wrong reason. I was innocent.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Agent Graph, none of that happened.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n Jesus fu\u2013Go there! Go to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Or send a team, whatever. You\u2019ll find that bastard with [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n That would only prove you to be a murderer, not a time traveling murderer. A person who later becomes a highly trained agent of the Foundation, also being capable of meticulously planning and getting away with murder is more likely than time travel.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n And SCP-7494 is just a trick of the light, then!? Cus\u2019 that\u2019s more likely, right? (\npauses\n) Is it not, Doctor S? Or does it have an anomalous effect like all the other anomalous art you\u2019ve got here? Cus\u2019 on the scale of likelihoods, it has just got to be a trick of the light.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n It is obviously anomalous. A trick of the light could not put someone into a trance.\n\n\nAgent Graph:\n I\u2019m sure I could find something on hypnosis with light to disregard it on the scale of likelihoods logic.\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Just stop it Graph. I am sorry I called you illogical. It was out of line. (\npauses\n) I respect your opinion, and I greatly appreciate your completion and report of this test. My conclusion, however, is that the SCP, 7494, is anomalous in that it has incepted false memories and delusions of grandeur that have already heavily affected your personality. That is what is going in my report. This is all also going into my report. My peers can decide if I\u2019m wrong.\n\n\n(\nsilence\n)\n\n\nDr. Singaram:\n Agent Graph, this concludes the debrief. You are dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7494.01:\n A body was found matching the identification, location, and wound that Agent Graph described.\n\n\nAccess to SCP-7494 has been upgraded to Level 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrbalorb's Works\n\n\n\u00ab | \nSCP-7146\n | SCP-7494 | \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7494\n\" by Orbalorb, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
