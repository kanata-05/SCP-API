SCP-6340-1 is to be inspected twice a month for any sign of corrosion.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2 is to be contained in a standard Anomalous Vehicle Containment Bay. The walls of SCP-6340-2's chamber are to be reinforced to resist 12.8\u00a0cm armor piercing rounds and high explosive shells.\n\n\nA teacher specialized in English and German is to be assigned to SCP-6340-2 on Wednesdays and Thursdays for 4 hour sessions of class to assist SCP-6340-2 in learning both languages to ease communications. A psychiatrist is to be assigned to SCP-6340-2, with scheduled meetings weekly to monitor the mental state of SCP-6340-2.\n\n\nVarious toys are to be provided to SCP-6340-2 for its entertainment. Said toys are to be temporarily removed from the containment bay as a disciplinary action if SCP-6340-2 is to ever fire its main gun without proper authorization. Once a week, SCP-6340-2 is to be maintained and cleaned under the guise of a doctor's visit.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-6340 is the designation for two German 12.8\u00a0cm Selbstfahrlafette auf VK 30.01(H) self-propelled anti-fortification guns,\n1\n respectively designated SCP-6340-1 and SCP-6340-2.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2 generates a constant stream of white noise only audible less than 10 meters from SCP-6340-2. The noise generated by SCP-6340-2 is able to be translated to speech by placing a radio set to the frequency of 115.08\u00a0GHz in the proximity of SCP-6340-2. The voice emanating from SCP-6340-2 is similar to that of a 6-year-old boy.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2 is autonomous. Interviews with SCP-6340-2 have demonstrated that it is capable of firing its main armament. It is unknown how SCP-6340-2 is capable of seeming typical operation without fuel and ammunition.\n\n\nDue to the neutralized status of SCP-6340-1 prior to being acquired by the Foundation, it is unknown if SCP-6340-1 shares the same anomalous properties as SCP-6340-2 or not, although discussions with SCP-6340-2 seem to suggest the former to be true.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-6340-2 were discovered in April 1993 when a tour guide at the Kubinka tank museum notified the museum owners of strange static emanating from the captured \"Sturer Emil\" tank on exhibition. This tank was eventually designated SCP-6340-2. Later that year, SCP-6340-2 escaped from the museum during the night before stopping 700 meters away from its initial position. Agents of the Russian branch of the Foundation present at the museum came into contact with SCP-6340-2 and took it into custody. Workers and visitors of the museum were informed that the \"Sturer Emil\" tank exhibit had been taken to a different facility for restoration.\n\n\nInterview 6340-2 #1:\n\nIn the initial year of its containment, several attempts had been made to try and produce meaningful communication from the static generated occasionally by SCP-6340-2. The following is a transcript of the first successful communication with SCP-6340-2:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a02\u00a0Access\u00a0required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[START OF LOG]\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n -tempt 45, Zrinyi please set the frequency to 102.9\u00a0GHz.\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Frequency is set, sir.\n\n\nStatic can be heard growing louder as SCP-6340-2 approaches Researcher Zrinyi. The radio used is unresponsive.\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n \nSigh\n Well, nothing on that one either. Another frequency, sir?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n Uhh, I don't know Zrinyi, just set it to a random frequency at this point and just hope you land on the right one. I'm going to get us some coffee. Marten, take my place while I'm gone.\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Sure, it's easy when you're not down there with an autonomous machine that's constantly moving around making a ruckus\u2026.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n [distant] What was that? Couldn't quite hear you over the sounds of your 35-ton friend moving around! By the way, do you two want anything? My treat.\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n I wouldn\u2019t mind a cup of tea, actually!\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n I\u2019ll pass, but thanks.\n\n\n2 hours go by without any change in the radio. SCP-6340-2 is heard moving around the whole time.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n Well, I\u2019ve had enough, set it to 115-ish and if it doesn't work then we\u2019ll be done here. We'll try it again with Tur\u00e1n tomorrow.\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Fine by me.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n All right then [Clears throat] Attempt number 88. Zrinyi, proceed with the frequency.\n\n\nThe radio used is unresponsive.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n I\u2019ve seen enough, let's g-\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Hallo? Kannst du mich h\u00f6ren?\n2\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Wait, was that a kid?\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Holy hell, it worked.\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n What in the world, Marten! Get down here and translate.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Roger that, sir.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Ich bin schl\u00e4frig..\n3\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Hold on, we\u2019re getting you a translator.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten is heard entering the room and approaching SCP-6340-2. The rest of the conversation has been translated for ease of understanding.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Hello there, can you hear me?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Hi..\n\n\nResearcher Zrinyi:\n Go on, he won\u2019t hurt you, I promise.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n O-okay.. Who are you, sir? Are you here to play with me?\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Maybe later, can you tell me your name?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n I'm Moritz, sir! What's your name?\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n You can call me Dietrich. Say, Moritz, can you tell me about yourself? Like\u2026 Where are your parents?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Of course! I- Uhh.. I'm 6 years old! I don\u2019t have parents but, uhh, I have a big brother, his name's Max!\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n A brother.. Can you tell me about him? Is he like you?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Yes! Although.. I haven\u2019t really seen him in awhile. The last time we were together, we were playing with our friends, but he had to leave somewhere and didn\u2019t tell me where. I hope he is okay\u2026\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Oh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that Moritz, I\u2019m sure your, uh, brother is fine. You mentioned friends? What did you mean?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n They were always with us; we played lots of games with them! The game we played the most was hide n' seek! Although we were always the seeker\u2026 When we found someone, our friends told us to play a prank on them with my firecrackers and they would be happy! Max was very good at it.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Firecrackers, you say.. Fuck, these guys had a twisted sense of humor to call that a prank\u2026\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp\n: Dietrich, sorry to interrupt your chat, but we shouldn\u2019t continue further. We need to inform the higher-ups and await orders for what to do next.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Roger that. \nAhem\n Alright, thank you, Moritz, although now I have to leave, okay? It's getting late.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n But I don't want you to go\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Don't worry, I will be back tomorrow, okay? I'll even bring in some toys!\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Really?! I haven't had toys in so long! Goodnight, mister Dietrich.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Goodnight, Moritz.\n\n\n[END OF LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the initial interaction with SCP-6340-2, measures were taken to update its containment procedures accordingly. Several interviews were scheduled with SCP-6340-2 to learn more about its past. Security Officer Marten was from now on assigned personally to SCP-6340-2, due to the attachment SCP-6340-2 displayed to him, while also acting as a translator.\n\n\nA search was initiated to try and possibly recover the remains of SCP-6340-1 using both German and Soviet reports of where SCP-6340 fought during the Second World War. SCP-6340-1 was eventually discovered preserved in a swamp in 2004 by a group of scavengers looking for WWII memorabilia. Following the news, SCP-6340-1 was retrieved and examined; test results showed SCP-6340-1 to be no different from a typical tank's wreckage.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2 was assigned lessons with a specialized language teacher at the request of Senior Researcher Wasp in the hopes of SCP-6340-2 eventually being able to communicate more easily with other members of the Foundation without the need of a translator.\n\n\nInterview 6340-2 #4:\n\nIt was suggested by Senior Researcher Wasp to introduce a child psychiatrist to SCP-6340-2 to better understand it. Security Officer Marten also suggested to reward SCP-6340-2 for its good behavior with a toy in the form of a giant ball to accommodate for SCP-6340-2\u2019s size. Both requests were accepted by the Site Director. The following is a transcript of the interview:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Access\u00a0required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[START OF LOG]\n\n\nThe blast door to SCP-6340-2 chamber is heard opening followed by footsteps. SCP-6340-2 is unresponsive, seemingly sleeping.\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie :\n Wow, I know I was briefed on this, but seeing a tank vibrate like that is still quite the odd sight. Are you sure this is safe?\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Moritz's sleeping, he often does at this hour.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n It's as safe as a tank with the temper of a kid could be\u2026\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Come on, Moritz ain\u2019t like that. He hasn\u2019t shown any aggressive behavior since he arrived here, he is just a kid. Now then, let me wake him up. [With a raised voice] Moritz come on, it\u2019s already 9AM, you need to wake up.\n\n\nThe sound of an engine starting is heard from SCP-6340-2 as it is awakens.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n H-Hello mister Dietrich, oh hello mister Wespe! Who is the lady with you?\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie:\n Hello Moritz! I\u2019m a friend of Dietrich, you can call me Emilie.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Emilie is going to ask you a few questions about your past, she\u2019s a doctor like Wasp. You don't need to be afraid, we\u2019re going to be both nearby.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n O-Okay!\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie:\n Splendid, now can you tell me a bit about your past? You told Dietrich about your previous\u2026 friends when you were with your brother, can you tell me a bit more about them?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n They were very nice to me and Max although we were only allowed to talk to them, apparently the others didn\u2019t like kids. When Max had to go to the doctors they would always sleep with me because I was scared of the dark..\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie:\n They sound like nice people. When was the last time you saw them ?\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n Th-They were arguing about something I didn\u2019t quite hear.. Afterwards there was a huge noise and everything went black! When I woke up I was all alone\u2026\n\n\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie:\n Oh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to hear that Moritz. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t do this on purpose. Now, Moritz, for this next question I want you to tell me what you remember about the last time you heard from your brother Max.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n I\u2026I don\u2019t really remember..\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Go on Moritz, don\u2019t be afraid. We are just trying to help you.\n\n\nSCP-6340-2:\n O-One of my friends came to me one day, they told me that Max wouldn\u2019t come back.. I cried and.. and-\n\n\nA loud engine noise similar to a small explosion is heard, cutting off SCP-6340-2. After a few minutes the subject remains unresponsive and halts all movements. Sounds that were generated by SCP-6340-2 also cease.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n M-Moritz?!\n\n\nPsychiatrist Emilie:\n I-is that normal for him?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n No, that\u2019s new.. And I don\u2019t like it. Marten try and manually start him from the driver seat!\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten can be heard climbing inside SCP-6340-2 followed by the sound of an engine failing to ignite.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Fuck! Come on Moritz, wake up!\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n We\u2019re ending the interview here. Marten! get out of there and escort Emilie out!\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n But sir-\n\n\nSenior Researcher Wasp:\n This is an order, I\u2019m staying with Moritz until he wakes up.\n\n\n[END OF LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6340-2/2006:\n\nOver the course of the year 2006, the mental state of SCP-6340-2 worsened. After a thorough debate between project staff, it was decided to inform SCP-6340-2 of the death of SCP-6340-1 in order to allow the anomaly to properly grieve SCP-6340-1 and allow its mental state to recover.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a02\u00a0Access\u00a0required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[START LOG]\n\n\nSCP-6340-2 is heard playing with a few toys, after a few minutes the blast door is heard opening allowing Security Officer Marten and Reseacher Zrinyi to enter the chamber.\n\n\nSecurity Officer Marten:\n Alright here goes..\nAhem\n Hello buddy!
