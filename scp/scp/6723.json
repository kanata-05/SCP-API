It should be simpler, at least. I'll just stick to the objectives.\n\n\nI know I messed up, but being transferred to this site feels like a bit much. As far as I can tell, they really don't have many resources here. It just seems to be where the higher-ups dump things that aren't big or important. Despite the obvious lack of funding, though, my division head is in everyone's business, acting like the Foundation actually cares if we get this stuff done.\n\n\nI'll be submitting material requests soon; have to think about what would help determine the whole not decaying thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/03/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\nIdeas:\n\n\n\n\nAutopsy\n\n\n\nPros: Quick compared to others, could provide insight into cause of death + possible anomalies\n\n\nCons: Destructive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeding whole body w/ bacteria, fungus, etc\n\n\n\nPros: Provides insight into possible anomalies - can things grow?\n\n\nCons: Could be destructive, possibly time-consuming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing bacteria, fungus, etc on sample\n\n\n\nPros: Provides insight into possible anomalies w/o damaging whole body, less time-consuming than whole body\n\n\nCons: Possibly less accurate - anomaly could be w/ whole body, possibly time consuming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessing w/ environment\n\n\n\nPros: Will find out how body reacts to different environments\n\n\nCons: Uses a lot of space, time consuming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring temperature?\n\n\n\nPros: Unclear\n\n\nCons: Unclear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI'll submit these ideas for approval and then request materials. I don't know if the temperature one would actually help anything, but Derek suggested it when I said the body was cold, so who am I to argue?\n\n\nApparently, I'm the only one on this project. I'm not complaining, but it feels weird after being at 19 for so long. At least this means there are fewer people that could mess this up for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/04/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThe sample idea got approved. If I don't get much in the way of results, I'll move on to seeding the whole body, which will, of course, complicate things a bit.\n\n\nWhile I'm waiting on the Petri dishes, I'll look into Ruth's past; I'm curious as to whether there may have been someone in her life on our side of the veil. Maybe thaumaturgy?\n\n\nCutting out the samples was a bit difficult. Not in a physical way, but I kind of feel like I'm still being punished for my mistake. \neven after losing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/05/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\nBackground info:\n\n\n\n\nFrom small town\n\n\n\nRedwick, PA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree siblings\n\n\n\n\nCondition:\n\n\n\n\nNo changes around the area that the sample was taken from.\n\n\nDusty again\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI didn't have much luck in investigating her \nbackgru\n background online. I'll see if I can get anything with Foundation-based resources, but I doubt that they keep records on random people.\n\n\nI cleaned off the dust since I was a bit worried about it accumulating in the sample area. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have done that; it could have interfered with the anomaly. I think it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/06/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\nBackground notes:\n\n\n\n\nAverage grades\n\n\nParents seemed not to care much\n\n\n\n\nCondition:\n\n\n\n\nNo noticeable changes.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nUnsurprisingly, I didn't have much luck with Foundation resources, either. Derek told me to focus on the actual anomaly, so no more background research, I guess.\n\n\nMy hand kind of hurt when I woke up this morning. Nothing bad, but it's pretty itchy now. Hopefully, the thing didn't come back for my remaining hand.\n\n\nI'm going to sample the dust and make sure it's not the \ncas\n cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/07/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\n\n\nCondition:\n\n\n\n\nNo noticeable \nca\n changes aside from dust accumulation.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI was a bit nervous about looking into the dust after Derek's comments on my investigation, so I ended up not doing it.\n\n\nProbably just me, but I kind of wish he'd stay out of everyone's business; he's not even a scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/08/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\n\n\nCondition:\n\n\n\n\nDust\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI've mostly been waiting around today.

Since I'll be checking the samples tomorrow, I'll ask about the dust.\n\n\nI've been thinking about the incident from the last project, and I'm wondering if Derek knows. Hopefully not, but it would explain why he's been hovering over my shoulder so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/10/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\n\n\nTrial 1:\n\n\n\n\nInconclusive results; no growth in control or test groups.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI must have done something wrong, \nsei\n seeing as nothing grew. I made sure to double-check everything for the second trial, so hopefully, whatever I did wrong won't come up again.\n\n\nI failed to ask about the dust, but I did ask if they had any other \nim\n information. It turns out they did a CT scan and failed to give me the report. Hopefully, I'll get it within the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/11/21\n\n\nItem #: SCP-6723\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n\nReason it doesn't decay\n\n\nCause of death\n\n\n\n\nCn\n\n\nCondition:\n\n\n\n\nDusty\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI \nti\n think my migraines are starting to come back. It's unrelated to the case at hand, but I thought \nt\n it was worth pointing out.\n\n\nI was thinking about the incident again, and I realized my \nmas\n mistake shouldn't have mattered as much as it did.
