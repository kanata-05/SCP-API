Both SCP-7196-A and SCP-7196-B must occur without incident, with SCP-196 terminating during SCP-7196-B. Any actions, within reason that lead to the fulfillment of SCP-7196-A, SCP-7196-B, and the resolving of SCP-7196 are authorized by the O5 Council.\n\n\nFailure to do so will result in disciplinary action and a potential ZK-Class (\"End of Time\") Scenario.\n.\nWhile the effects of a time paradox are unknown in practice, working models theorize that a ZK-Class Scenario would operate as the most likely outcome.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7196 is the temporal paradox surrounding \nSCP-196\n. SCP-7196 is separated into two events, SCP-7196-A and SCP-7196-B.\n\n\nSCP-7196-A\n is the event that displaces the pre-existing version of SCP-196, designated SCP-196-A, to 06:29:22, April 26th, 2002 in April of 2016. SCP-196-A was reportedly recruited through standard D-Class recruitment programs and was displaced by an unknown anomaly.\n.\nInformation about SCP-7196-A was reported by SCP-196 shortly after his displacement. As such, additional information is vague and unclear.\n Due to continuous intervention by the Ethics Committee over the last two decades, the D-Class program has dropped to minimal activity, bottlenecking the chances of SCP-196-A's admission into the program.\n\n\nSCP-7196-B\n is the event that results in the termination of SCP-196. SCP-196 appeared in Site-17 on November 7th, 1968, where he was killed by SCP security personnel during a break-in. At the time of his death, SCP-196 was much older, with gray hair, and was carrying an unknown anomaly and several purely mundane weapons. Said anomaly, currently designated SCP-7196-1, has not yet been discovered as of December 2015 and is stored in Locker #196 in Sub-Level 1's Safe Wing within Site-17.\n\n\nSCP-7196-1\n is a spherical, hand-held temporal displacement device, capable of shifting the user to a chosen point in time while maintaining their physical position relative to the Earth. The input apparatus consists of a small numpad, where a date can be inserted,\n.\nYYYY/MM/DD\n along with an optional selection for the time of day.\n.\nH:M:S, 24-hour clock\n When a destination time is inserted, it will display on a horizontal screen above the input, and a button, located underneath the input will displace the user and other connected persons to the desired time. The methods of displacement utilized by SCP-7196-1 are poorly understood.\n\n\nAddendum 7196.1:\n Potential Disruption\n\n\nThe following notice was sent to Site-17 with no traceable point of origin on March 11, 2016. Personnel are to be reminded that the \"Temporal Anomalies Department\" is \nnot\n a recognized Foundation division, and all messages from them do not carry any authority.\n\n\nIt should be noted that a security breach had occurred three months prior, where an unregistered Foundation ID accessed a list of temporal anomalies, including SCP-196 and SCP-7196.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the containment team of \nSCP-196\n and \nSCP-7196,\n\n\nRegarding the upcoming SCP-7196-A event, it has become clear that the prerequisites have not been met to fulfill SCP-7196. We are sure that this has come to your attention, however, we ask that the following actions be taken.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-196 is to be left within his containment cell unattended between the times of 12:00 and 14:00 every day, from March 16th to March 26th. No cameras are to be active during this time to avoid any additional informational paradoxes. In the event of his disappearance, no information can be recorded or logged about it until the end of the ten days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo temporal anchors are to be used at Site-17 or near SCP-196 during the aforementioned ten-day period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo investigation, Foundation or otherwise, surrounding suspicious activity on June 20th, 2016 may take place. Any reports regarding potential incidents must be ignored until the following day. If this delay is not feasible, investigations can only occur at 0900 hours at the earliest.\n\n\n\n\nFulfillment of these requests will resolve SCP-7196. There is no reason to involve yourselves in SCP-7196's containment further. We have the situation under control.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n deviate from the above requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\n-The Temporal Anomalies Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving this message, it was discovered that the crime ring responsible for kidnapping SCP-196-1 was apprehended via an anonymous tip several months earlier, ensuring that SCP-7196-A would not occur without Foundation intervention. Due to the temporal manipulation needed to disturb SCP-7196-A, GOI-75722, a temporal terrorist organization, is believed to be responsible for the complication of SCP-7196.\n\n\nShortly after this discovery, SCP-7196 was raised to a Class-I Priority (\"Immediate Attention\").\n\n\nAddendum 7196.2:\n Mission Briefing\n\n\nIn light of the events outlined in Addendum 7196.1, MTF Psi-76 (\"Time's Arrow\") was paired up with Sr. Researcher Alex Adams, the head researcher of SCP-7196, and Dr. Nancy Bennett, a representative from the Foundation's \nofficial\n temporal department, the \nDepartment of Chronology\n, to ensure SCP-7196-A.\n\n\n\n\nMISSION BREIFING\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 14th, 2016, 13:00\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-17, Conference Room 2\n\n\nPersonnel Present:\n Sr. Rsrch Adams, Dr. Bennett, Agent Martinez (\u03a8-1)\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nBennett:\n Everyone is caught up on the SCP-7196 file, right? We're running on borrowed time here.\n\n\nAdams:\n Really? It's time travel, we have all the time in the world, so we can \ntake\n our time.\n\n\nBennett:\n No, it can't-\n\n\n(Bennett sighs. She pulls out a piece of notebook paper covered in notes regarding SCP-7196 and lays it flat on the table. Both Martinez and Adams stare at the paper in bewilderment.)\n\n\nBennett:\n (rambling) There are a number of inconsistencies in 7196 that need to be addressed. I've developed plans for initiating -A, -B will be relatively easy to handle, provided we're vigilant, the -1 loop needs to be closed, so we'll jump forward and collect it from ourselves. I have a few questions about 196 answered, so if you-\n\n\nMartinez:\n Slow down! What is this?!\n\n\nAdams:\n Yeah, a week ago the containment procedures said we had to do nothing at all. You guys sent the memo, what's the problem?\n\n\nBennett:\n No, you can't-\n\n\n(Bennett massages the bridge of her nose and paces around the room, visibly frustrated. She returns to the head of the table and places her palms down, staring between Adams and Martinez.)\n\n\nBennett:\n (condescendingly) Listen. \nWe\n are the Department of Chronology, \nnot\n the \"Temporal Department\". The Bees\n.\nFoundation nickname for GOI-75722 (\"B\")\n sent that in to taunt us while they mess around with who knows what. The fact that they're involved means they're going to \ntry\n to do something \nbad\n. We are here to ensure everything runs \nsmoothly\n and \nefficiently.\n Have I made myself clear?\n\n\n(Adams uncomfortably shifts in his seat while Martinez avoids eye contact with Bennett, her eyes darting between the carpeted floor and the door.)\n\n\nBennett:\n So, how did one-ninety-six get into the D-Class program?\n\n\nAdams:\n From what I gathered, human trafficking. He was drugged and kidnapped, probably to sell his organs on the black market. He was in the back of a truck when Foundation operatives intercepted and took them all in. He was sent to Site-19 afterward.\n\n\nBennett:\n Any other details, like when he was drugged, for how long, what he did in Site-19, anything?\n\n\nAdams:\n Not anything I remember.\n\n\nBennett:\n Good.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Site-19 doesn't \nuse\n the D-Class program. They've got drones or clones for any of that.\n\n\nBennett:\n Site-19 doesn't have to. SCP-196-A is the only person we have to fool. As long as he \nbelieves\n all of that happens, it might as well have.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Wouldn't that just cause another paradox?\n\n\nBennett:\n No, it- (shakes head) I'm done, I'm not explaining this anymore. (snaps fingers towards Adams) What's 196's name, where are we doing this?\n\n\nAdams:\n Uh, it's- (flips through papers) Yohannes Tesfay, Seattle, WA.\n\n\nBennett:\n Okay, the plan is simple. We fake a crime ring to kidnap this guy and get him acquired by Site-19. From there, we fake the testing of an anomaly to send the younger 196 back. That's the -A event. Then, we take our current one-ninety-six, give him -1, and send him back to -B. Then, we all get to go home. Any questions?\n\n\n(Martinez raises her hand.)\n\n\nBennett:\n (flat) What?\n\n\nMartinez:\n We can't use the current SCP-7196-1 because that's the one we got from SCP-7196-B. So we need to find the original and give that one to one-ninety-six.\n\n\nBennett:\n I already said that we're going to the future to pick it up. Were you not listening?\n\n\nAdams:\n What, how?\n\n\nBennett:\n We'll just go to the future and I'll ask to borrow it. And before you say anything, I don't know how the Future Foundation got it in the first place either, so it's not an informational paradox.\n.\ninformational paradox:\n A paradox where information or objects, etc. are transported from the future to the past, providing no point of origin for the object or information in question. \nex.\n Telling a mathematician in the past a mathematical proof that they wrote, leading to them writing it down, removing any point of origin for the proof itself.\n\n\nMartinez:\n We still don't know what that is.\n\n\nBennett:\n And \nthat's\n why I'm here. So (points to Martinez) round up your MTF and get ready. I hope y'all were in theatre because I'm not giving acting classes.\n\n\nAdams:\n So we're just kidnapping him?\n\n\nBennett:\n We're \nfaking\n a kidnapping. There's a difference.\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the mission briefing, the SCP-7196 containment team was relocated to Site-32 in Seattle, WA for Operation: Paradoxical Fallacy. Personnel at Site-17 were instructed to place SCP-196 under strict containment guidelines by Dr. Bennett to avoid any potential breaches.\n\n\nAddendum 7196.3:\n Incident Logs\n\n\nThe following files have been added to provide a timeline of SCP-7196's development, currently under review by the Department of Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nCONTAINMENT UPDATE\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n March 14th, 2016\n\n\nLocation:\n Site-17, SCP-196's containment cell\n\n\n\n\n[13:26]:\n SCP-196 lies on his bed for thirty minutes.

Three other members of MTF Psi-76 are stationed in the backseat, waiting for SCP-196-A, aged 40, to complete his shift.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n It'll be fine. Site-32 took care of law enforcement, so as long as we move quickly, we'll get to the rendezvous point fine. Don't think about it.\n\n\nAdams:\n No, I mean, morally. This man is at his lowest point and we're about to drive him deeper.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nAdams:\n I wish we didn't have to do it.\n\n\n(Martinez glances at Adams and continues looking out the window.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n Don't think about it.\n\n\nAdams:\n I mean, couldn't we have asked Dr. Bennett if there was some other way?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Nancy already has this shit figured out. If this is the way things have to go, then it is what it is.\n\n\nAdams:\n But you\u2019re just an agent, you kinda just do whatever Command tells you.\n\n\n(Martinez swivels her head to glare at Adams.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n No, you don\u2019t get to say that. You just sit in your office and never have to think about what you tell us to do, so I\u2019ll be the first to tell you. The world. Isn\u2019t. Fair.\n\n\n(Pause.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n I mean, the \none\n time you come along for the mission, and you\u2019re already looking at the situation with your little \u2018Woe is me\u2019 eyes. This isn't text on a screen telling you what happened. We're going to violently kidnap him and throw him into the back of this van. The alternative is a ZK Scenario. No matter how shit the situation is, we have to deal with it.\n\n\nAdams:\n (timidly) Okay.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Now repeat what I say: The ends justify the means.\n\n\nAdams:\n The ends justify the means.\n\n\nMartinez:\n The ends. Justify. The means.\n\n\nAdams:\n The ends justify the means.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Good.

Personnel are to be reminded that the \"Temporal Anomalies Department\" is not a recognized Foundation division, and all messages from them do not carry any authority.\nIt should be noted that a security breach had occurred three months prior, where an unregistered Foundation ID accessed a list of temporal anomalies, including SCP-196 and SCP-7196.\nAfter receiving this message, it was discovered that the crime ring responsible for kidnapping SCP-196-1 was apprehended via an anonymous tip several months earlier, ensuring that SCP-7196-A would not occur without Foundation intervention. Due to the temporal manipulation needed to disturb SCP-7196-A, GOI-75722, a temporal terrorist organization, is believed to be responsible for the complication of SCP-7196.\nShortly after this discovery, SCP-7196 was raised to a Class-I Priority (\"Immediate Attention\").",
