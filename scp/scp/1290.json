Activation experiments involving SCP-1290 have been indefinitely suspended pending a better understanding of its operational principles.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1290 is a pair of prototype electronic devices that were built by Prometheus Labs as part of research into long-range teleportation. Each device consists of a platform 2\u00a0m in diameter attached to a 5\u00a0m x 20\u00a0m x 3\u00a0m main unit, both of which draw power from a dedicated generator. The two copies of SCP-1290 are located at diametrically opposed (antipodal) locations of the Earth, with SCP-1290-1 located in [REDACTED], Colombia and SCP-1290-2 located in [REDACTED], Singapore.\n\n\nWhen an object is placed on the platform of SCP-1290-1 and the main unit is activated, the object is instantaneously (\u226410\u00a0ms delay) teleported to the platform of SCP-1290-2. However, due to what is suspected to be a design or engineering flaw, the object retains its orientation and velocity relative to the axis of the earth. That is, when a stationary object enters SCP-1290-1, it exits SCP-1290-2 upside-down and traveling east at approximately 930\u00a0m/s. See Addendum 1290-01 for more information.\n\n\nSCP-1290 came to the Foundation's attention following the closure of the Prometheus Labs main facility and was secured and contained on \u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588 by elements of Mobile Task Force Mu-4 (\"Debuggers\"). The chief engineer in charge of SCP-1290, Dr. [REDACTED], is wanted for questioning by the Foundation and has yet to be located. SCP-1290 is currently being reverse-engineered by Foundation research teams in an effort to understand and replicate its technology.\n\n\nAddendum 1290-01:\n Incident Report, Initial Activation Experiment on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nIn order to establish the functionality of SCP-1290, Foundation researchers attempted to teleport a regulation 14-pound (6.35\u00a0kg) bowling ball from SCP-1290-1 to SCP-1290-2, resulting in three casualties and severe damage to the research facility and a neighboring warehouse. Until SCP-1290 is fully functional and the source of this flaw is identified, activation experiments have been suspended until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1289\n | SCP-1290 | \nSCP-1291\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1290\n\" by Aelanna, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
