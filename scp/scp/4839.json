Further involvement on the part of the \u263d\u263d\u263d Humanity Defense Corps would have only exacerbated the situation and led to cross-dimensional casualties.\n\n\nAs an additional means to ensure eternal quarantine, JALAK\u00c5RA Himself has whispered the hymn of silent flesh into Iteration 4V. While regrettable, this action was a product of absolute necessity, and executed to protect the multi-dimensional majority of humans. Fortunately, extraterrestrial life in 4V continues to thrive.\n\n\nWe will now provide you with 4V's document SCP-4839,\n1\n if only as a warning. We know your cause is just \u2014 but for your own sake, know when to stop.\n\n\n\n\nYou are watched. You are Protected. You are loved.\n\n\u263d\u263d\u263d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 1 - 4/27/2022 (archived)\n\n\nIteration 2 - 6/13/2028 (archived)\n\n\nIteration 3 - 2/1/2032 (archived)\n\n\nIteration 4 - 7/20/2305 (archived)\n\n\nIteration 5 - 10/30/5792 (archived)\n\n\nIteration 6 - 11/18/9047 (FINAL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKullervo counter specifications for SCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4839\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nThreat Level:\n Black \n\u2022\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within \nSCP-2400\n. MCZ-4839 is composed of two warehouses for storage of SCP-4839, living quarters for staff, and barracks for guards. Each warehouse will be equipped with a Kullervo Suppressor, thereby neutralizing the dangerous effects of contained instances.\n\n\nItems that carry SCP-4839 are to be contained as-is. Living instances are to be accommodated with nutrition and other sustenance. Deceased instances are to be contained, as well.\n\n\nAcquisition of additional SCP-4839 is to be carried out through the use of Kullervo Detectors, available at every major Foundation site. Any usage of Kullervo Detectors that deviates from the provided instruction manual is grounds for immediate termination of employment with the Foundation and the administration of Class-C amnestics.\n\n\nThough SCP-4839 poses no threat while contained, it is estimated that only 4% of SCP-4839 in existence is currently under containment. Failure to contain at least 70% of SCP-4839 by 12/2/2065 will result in a ZK-class reality failure scenario.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4839 is a subatomic particle that can only be detected with a Barton-Salas Kullervo Detector\n2\n. It is discovered SCP-4839 cannot be transferred from its host object, and does not affect the object\u2019s mass.\n\n\nIt is extradimensional in origin, and is believed to be the catalyst of another reality\u2019s forced assimilation of our own.\n3\n\n\nSo far, SCP-4839 has been discovered in the following objects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nAcquisition Strategy\n\n\nCover Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulep-brand window-mounted air conditioners manufactured after 1986\n\n\nJulep Electric seized by the Foundation and dissolved. A product recall is in effect.\n\n\nAsbestos contamination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bangka slow loris (\nNycticebus bancanus\n)\n\n\nAll wild instances, approximately 70% previously captive specimens, and approximately 40% of deceased specimens have been captured and contained.\n\n\nThe species is extinct in the wild due to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe works of the Italian baroque painter, Artemisia Gentileschi\n\n\nCaptured in raids; owners amnesticized.\n\n\nLost in a warehouse fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaves of the Ginkgo tree (\nGinkgo biloba\n)\n\n\nAcquisition ongoing. Complete containment would prove impractical; at most, 70% of live and deceased specimens can be contained.\n\n\nA virus from the Mesozoic Era that preyed upon ginkgo plants has been released from Arctic permafrost due to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore items may be added to this list, pending the discovery of SCP-4839 elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKullervo counter specifications for SCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 6/13/2028, revisions have been made to this article.\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4839\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nThreat Level:\n Black \n\u2022\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within \nSCP-2400\n.

Disassembly of the broken unit revealed no capacity to detect anomalous energy sources.\n\n\n- Document-4839-Charlie: Written confession from Dr. Aaron Hamlin that the existence of GoI-4817 \u201cGreen Sky Tavern\u201d was fabricated at the behest of an anonymous third party.\n\n\n- Document 4839-Delta: \u2014 a sworn declaration from GoI-419 \u201cThree Moons Initiative\u201d claiming that the Seventh Prince of Corbenic (their benefactor) was unaware of any of its alleged plans outlined in SCP-4839. In addition, the entity is not named \u201cDread Kullervo\u201d, and is considering extradimensional legal action against the Foundation for libel. Document was provided by an SCP-2578-D instance and stamped with lie-detecting thaumaturgical glyphs.\n\n\nEVIDENCE FOR AUTHENTICITY\n\n\n- Document 4839-Tango\n5\n \nas provided by the Administrator.\n\n\nO7 COUNCIL VOTE TO DECOMMISSION SCP-4839:\n\n\nYea: 4\n\n\nNay: 7\n\n\nAbstain: 2\n\n\nVOTE FAILED. SCP-4839 UPHELD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been changes made.\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4839\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n-eschaton\n\n\nThreat Level:\n Black \n\u2022\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within \nSCP-2400\n. MCZ-4839 is composed of \nas many\n warehouses \nas needed\n for storage of SCP-4839, \net cetera\n. Each warehouse will be equipped with a Kullervo Suppressor.\n\n\nItems that carry SCP-4839 are to be \nput in boxes and never taken out.\n\n\nAcquisition of additional SCP-4839 is to be carried out \nby any means necessary, and over all other Foundation priorities\n. In addition, due to the Administrator\u2019s crucial function in the containment of SCP-4839, he is to be kept alive by any means necessary, as an equal priority. All staff are advised that anomalous means to extend the human life have been retroactively approved by the O7 Council prior to their dissolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough SCP-4839 poses no threat while contained, it is estimated that only 4% of SCP-4839 in existence is currently under containment. Failure to contain at least \n96%\n of SCP-4839 \nas soon as possible\n will result in a ZK-class reality failure scenario.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4839 is a subatomic particle that can only be detected with a Barton-Salas Kullervo Detector. It is discovered SCP-4839 cannot be transferred from its host object, and does not affect the object\u2019s mass.\n\n\nIt is extradimensional in origin, and \nvery dangerous.\n So far, SCP-4839 has been discovered in \n13% of all matter on Earth, as well as every anomalous item in foundation custody.\n\n\nIn addition, it has been confirmed that SCP-4839 is directly responsible for the hostile military action upon the foundation by agents of the Three Moons Initiative, as well as the subsequent \u201cIteration 4V Dimensional Quarantine\u201d event that has yet to be explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges.\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4839\n\n\nObject Class:\n \nBad\n\n\nThreat Level:\n \nReally Bad\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n \nKeep putting it in the boxes.

Stop saying it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4839\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n \nNone needed.\n\n\nAddendum - Notice from the Administrator:\n\n\n\n\nLook, I know there\u2019s been a lot of changes lately. More sad people. More screaming. More people not wanting to put things in the box. More people not wanting to be in the box. More people thinking that the boxes are bad, that there are too many boxes. That I can\u2019t fit a whole planet in a box. That too many people are dying in the boxes. That we can\u2019t put a box of all boxes in a box, that\u2019s a pair of ducks or something. That there\u2019s no real reason to keep putting things in boxes. That this was all some kind of K-class scenario in itself.\n\n\nIt\u2019s confusing \u2014 I get that. It makes my head hurt. It takes really, really, really, really smart people to understand it. And that\u2019s where you guys come in! I love all the work you\u2019re doing. You do what I can\u2019t, because I\u2019m not human anymore. Which is okay \u2014 just a part of give and take, right? There was a story where a guy gave his right eye to another guy for wisdom. I forget how the rest of it goes. Point being, necessary sacrifices.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been having problems too? There\u2019s something that makes me sad. It goes like this: see, I\u2019m the Administrator. That means I administrate. All the things in the Foundation are here because \nI have them.\n And even then, there are people who think that I\u2019m going too far.\n\n\nPutting things in boxes is bad.
