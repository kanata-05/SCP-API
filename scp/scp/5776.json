A reality anchoring device must be kept inside the cell, attached to SCP-5776 at all times. If it is for any reason to breach containment, its recapture is to be of alpha priority and all expendable resources must be spent to resecure containment and prevent an XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario. If it cannot be recontained, then SCP-5776 must be left to roam the planet, as interfering is likely to further anger it. \nIt really wants to destroy everything!\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5776 is an extremely powerful entity capable of causing devastating amounts of destruction to human civilisation. Pretty terrifying if I say so myself. It seems SCP-5776\u2019s primary goal is to destroy everything it can and seemingly nothing is able to prevent it completing this goal if it is not contained, so we need to make sure it doesn\u2019t get out 0_0.\n\n\nDespite what you may be told, it is \n100% not a common food product\n.\n\n\nSCP-5776 is absolutely capable of drastically altering its shape, mass and even cellular or genetic makeup. Due to this ability, its primary objective can be carried out swiftly and effectively, making it extremely important that containment is not lost. It is believed that the entity is capable of causing humanity\u2019s extinction in a matter of days or even hours if it is able to escape. SCP-5776 appears extremely eager to escape custody, expressing heightened frustration to the Foundation, claiming it will destroy us first.\n1\n\n\nDespite a reality anchoring device being attached directly to SCP-5776 at all times, it still is able to carry out its shape-shifting abilities to a limited degree (which is annoying, almost as much as being locked up). \nThe following is a list of all forms SCP-5776 has taken while in secure containment, in order of when SCP-5776 initially materialised as them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5776 prior to containment. As you can see, it is horrifyingly scary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. An unknown large beast\n\n\n. An unknown winged scorpion\n\n\n. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n.

A small, white cylinder, not a small edible product (current form)\n\n\nNotably, when SCP-5776 alters appearance, including into other anomalies, it gains the item or entity\u2019s abilities, though these effects can be dampened by a reality anchoring device. This further makes it an immensely powerful entity, so SCP-5776 must not gain knowledge of any other anomalies that are presently contained by the Foundation or any other groups of interest otherwise it will destroy everything!\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a05776\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Recovery\u00a0Log\u00a05776\n\n\n\n\nThis file has been removed by order of 05-\u2588 because it was too scary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5776 is capable of communicating with researchers depending on its current form. Due to this, attempts have been made to reason with SCP-5776 and have a conversation with it. These attempts can be found in Interview Log 5776-1 and Interview Log 5776-2.\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a05776-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a05776-1\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Ox\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5776\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Ox:\n H-Hello?\n\n\nSCP-5776:\n (\nsilence\n)\n\n\n(\nSCP-5776 begins to resemble SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, presumably to be able to speak\n)\n\n\nResearcher Ox:\n Wow you are very scary.
