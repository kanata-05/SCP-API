Foundation agents embedded in private and government operated space programs restrict spaceflights to paths and windows that minimize the chance of an encounter with SCP-4954.\n\n\nOrbital Task Force \u0938-2 (\"Dust Busters\") operates a series of 1,000 remote piloted craft in upper-earth orbit, each equipped with an electromagnetic pulse generator capable of disabling any SCP-4954 within 500\u00a0km. Any instances found reaching the fourth phase of their development are to be tagged and tracked to determine their most likely reentry path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4954 offspring recovered from a captured Phase 3 SCP-4954 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4954 is a series of self-replicating satellites, currently \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in number, that subsist off of orbital debris and sunlight for the purposes of creating thrust, expanding in size, and reproducing. SCP-4954 instances are rectangular in shape and range from 5\u00a0cm to 500\u00a0m in length on their longest axis depending on their age. SCP-4954 is theorized to produce thrust by breaking down collected debris into ionized hydrogen through an unknown method and accelerating it out of its shell.\n\n\nSCP-4954 will generate new components on its interior and exterior surfaces to aid in the catching of orbital debris if provided raw materials and sunlight. The process by which it accomplishes this is as of yet unexplained but microscopic imaging of SCP-4954 have shown parts growing out of it on the molecular level. All SCP-4954 instances, regardless of generation and stage in its life cycle, possess a USB port through which its programming and memory can be accessed.\n\n\nSCP-4954 has four distinct phases in its lifespan. The first phase is the only portion of the SCP-4954 life cycle in which it does not require outside materials to expand its hardware, instead using a preexisting block of various metals and plastics until it reaches at least 30\u00a0cm in length in any one axis. SCP-4954 enters phase two after this where it performs its primary function of collecting orbital debris to convert into additional components. SCP-4954 enters the third stage once it has accumulated a mass greater than 100\u00a0kg. During this phase, it will generate and release a new generation of SCP-4954. Newly generated SCP-4954 copies will form and modify components based on what the previous iteration found most effective for collecting debris. Afterwards, SCP-4954 enters its final phase during which it transmits its on-board memory to other instances within communication range before placing itself on a reentry path. The time between transitions in phases depends primarily on the amount of debris the instance encounters, with the average age of a fourth-phase SCP-4954 being between 3 and 5 years old.\n\n\nAddendum 4954-1: Thaumiel Reclassification\n\nA request to the O5 council to reclassify SCP-4954 as Thaumiel was made by the recently formed Ad Astra program under the argument that the Earth developing Kessler Syndrome\n1\n would endanger their potential to contain space-based anomalies. Following the installation of a neutralization protocol in OTF \u0938-2 in case SCP-4954's reproductive or end-of-life behaviors change, the request was approved.\n\n\nAddendum 4954-2: Recovered On-Board Memory\n\n\nNote: The following is a record of programs referenced by the source code of a SCP-4954 instance recovered on 2023/06/10 in order of execution. The discovery of partially formed first phase SCP-4954s in the interior of the captured instance indicates it was recovered early in the third portion of its life cycle.\n\n\n\n\nTimestamp:\n 2020/01/03\u00a012:01 AM (UTC)\n\n\n\n\n>run Happy_Birthday.mp3\n\n\n\n\nPoI-4954-1:\n Why hello there!
