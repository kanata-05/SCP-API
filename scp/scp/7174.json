Hazardous material and radiation detectors are to be installed over the burial site. Foundation communication satellite FCOM-P022 is to continue operation normally until the end of its designed lifetime.\n\n\nCislunar spacecrafts are to be advised away from the site of Incident 7174-RE.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7174 was an assortment\n1\n of 167 anomalously-enhanced wireless communication devices designed to facilitate communication between Lunar Area-32 and terrestrial Foundation assets. Each of these devices were capable of opening small\n2\n two-way Einstein-Rosen bridges\n3\n to fixed geocentric coordinates above the Earth's North Pole, whereupon the (otherwise unaltered) Foundation communication satellite FCOM-P022 would pick up and relay the signal transmitted by these devices to terrestrial network.\n\n\nAll SCP-7174 instances began malfunctioning on December 21st, 2012. Simultaneous usage of the instances as well as minute shifts in constellations vital for the anomalous modification resulted in unexpected interference between the wormholes, culminating in Incident 7174-RE: the opening of an extradimensional rift at the approximate midpoint between Lunar Area-32 and the target coordinate above FCOM-P022. Fortunately, due to the distance and scale involved, the rift had caused close to zero disruption to the Veil.\n\n\nInvestigation to the nature of this interdimensional rift as well as its impact beyond the gravitational echo typical for such rift is ongoing. Both destruction and continued use of SCP-7174 had been deemed as unnecessary and dangerous, hence the current containment procedure.\n\n\nAddendum 7174.A:\n Abridged list of SCP-7174 that were active during Incident 7174-RE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nItem #\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nAdditional Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSCP-7174-9\n\n\nA Motorola RAZR V3 cellular telephone\n\n\nCommunications disrupted during the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nSCP-7174-12\n\n\nA Nokia 2610\n\n\nExperienced disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nSCP-7174-19\n\n\nA Nokia 3310\n\n\nThe only device that faced no interruption during the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nSCP-7174-21\n\n\nA Nokia 6120\n\n\nExperienced disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\nSCP-7174-33\n\n\nA Siemens C65\n\n\nExperienced disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n\nSCP-7174-43\n\n\nA Sony Ericsson K800\n\n\nExperienced disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\nSCP-7174-47\n\n\nA Sony Ericsson W800\n\n\nExperienced disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Irrelevant entries omitted]\n\n\nAddendum 7174.B:\n FCOM-P022 internal self-diagnostics log during Incident 7174-RE\n\n\n(Internal clock was set to UTC+0)\n\n\n\n\n0000 Status: All systems functioning.

Lunar Area-32 had also helpfully attached the report from Department of Thaumatology, who had been able to review and analyze the event faster than the Office of Tactical Theology.\n\n\nDepartment of Thaumatology had reported that the interference caused by shifting constellations and \"cross-talk\" between individual thaumatic workings would necessarily collapse into \"fail-safe\" scenario. That is, the result of the interference would be the \"hardening\" of the path between the SCP-7174 devices and its target coordinate from external sources of further distortions, thaumatic or otherwise. It was then nigh-impossible, or so the report claimed, that the interference caused the interdimensional rift by and of itself. The Department of Thaumatology had continued to pursue the possibility that a third party had attempted to intrude on the thaumatic working of the devices.\n\n\nOffice of Tactical Theology defers to the Department of Thaumatology on the matter of such analysis. Instead, the Office would present relevant data from Near-Earth Akiva Radiation Monitoring Network (NEAR-MoNk) satellites; the Office has successfully extracted Akiva radiation density data of the relevant spaces from the chaotic flux that had enveloped the planet for the majority of year 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkiva radiation density data from NEAR-MoNk. Left hand side is Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bands of this graphs represent different faith \"channels,\" filtered to only represent faiths relevant to 2012 Eschatological Panic. The thick green band represent the Akiva radiation density corresponding to the faith of Planet X/Nibiru Cataclysm. As the graph demonstrates, the green band experiences sudden jump in density some distance away from Earth, roughly coinciding with the region of space where interdimensional rift that caused Incident 7174-RE had manifested.\n\n\nThis density was expected, due to the Nibiru Cataclysm being a popular space-based eschatology. Similar or even larger spike should have occured in the Sun, due to popular eschatologies focusing on it. Unfortunately, we are yet to have the capability of untangling the mess of Akiva \"channels\" that converged on the Sun. But we digress.\n\n\nThe Office of Tactical Theology hypothesizes that the interdimensional disturbance that occured during Incident 7174-RE were caused by the spike of popular interest in the Nibiru Cataclysm eschatology, and SCP-7174 fail-safe collapse had conversely hampered the interdimensional rift from fully manifesting.\n\n\nThe inexplicable case of SCP-7174-19 instance continuing to function despite the imminent breakdown of space-time continuum was, unsurprisingly, not explainable through the currently known model of thaumo-akivic interference. But, if you would allow some personal opinion within this report, I would presume that it was related to popular faith related to the device model itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Full manifest available upon formal request\n\n\n2\n. With diameters in the order of 10\n-15\n meters. As reference, the diameter of a proton is roughly 1.7x10\n-15\n meters.\n\n\n3\n.
