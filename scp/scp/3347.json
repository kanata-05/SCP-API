At least one Foundation agent is to maintain residence of SCP-3347 at all times, as well as provide necessary maintenance. No personnel are to reside in SCP-3347-1 or SCP-3347-2 for extended periods of time unless authorized to do so for experimentation purposes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3347 is a split level ranch style house located in a suburban neighborhood in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, New Jersey. SCP-3347 is comprised of a living room, a recreational room, a kitchen, a dining room, two bedrooms, three bathrooms, and several closets. Most of these rooms within SCP-3347, including all of the major living quarters, bear no known anomalous properties, and are equipped with furniture and appliances typical of a contemporary home.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-3347 occur in relation to two bedrooms, designated SCP-3347-1 and SCP-3347-2, located adjacent to each other on the third floor. SCP-3347-1 contains a queen-sized bed, two dressers, a closet, and a central light fixture. SCP-3347-2 is entirely empty when not in the process of a Transposition Event.\n\n\nA Transposition Event is triggered whenever two fertile humans of opposite sex sleep in the bed located in SCP-3347-1. Humans of the same sex, sterilized or menopausal humans, and groups of more than two individuals have all failed to trigger a Transposition Event. During a Transposition Event, the contents of SCP-3347-2 will change instantaneously on a daily basis. These changes, referred to as Transposition Shifts, always occur at 12:00 AM EST. Changes within SCP-3347-2 during Transposition Shifts vary between Transposition Events, but usually involve the appearance of objects such as furniture, carpeting, books, clothes, toys, and wallpaper, as well as the disappearance and rearrangement of said objects. If allowed to proceed to fruition, Transposition Events will always continue for exactly 18 days, resulting in 18 Transposition Shifts. Any outside objects left within SCP-3347-2 will disappear during Transposition Shifts, making surveillance of the transposition process via security cameras impossible. At the conclusion of a Transposition Event, all objects within SCP-3347-2 will disappear, and SCP-3347-2 will return to its initial empty state. SCP-3347-2 will return to this state prematurely if one or both of the subjects stop sleeping in SCP-3347-1 on a nightly basis.\n\n\nSubjects who have triggered Transposition Events have reported feeling a desire to spend time near or around SCP-3347-2 during the event, as well as an overwhelming sense of sadness and loss following the event\u2019s conclusion. Psychiatric evaluation is considered unnecessary in most cases, as these feelings tend to subside within a few days. Subjects have also occasionally reported hearing sounds from within SCP-3347-2 during Transposition Events. Such reports have included the sound of laughter, crying, and muffled speech. All attempts to locate the source of these sounds have been unsuccessful.\n\n\nAddendum 3347.1:\n \nExperiment Logs\n\n\nThe following Experiment Logs catalog three deliberately triggered Transposition Events, and include all furnishing alterations, object disappearances, and otherwise preternatural phenomena resulting from these events.\n\n\nDuring each experiment, two subjects were instructed to remain within SCP-3347 until the Transposition Event was completed and to sleep together (platonically) within SCP-3347-1 every night. Two Foundation agents were administered to the site in order to oversee the experiment and take daily observations of the objects within SCP-3347-2.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03347-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSubjects:\n D-4217 (Male) and D-9951 (Female)\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Subject D-4217 and D-9951 were chosen deliberately due to their familiarity with each other, having both previously been assigned to experiment with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. It was believed that this familiarity would prevent interpersonal problems from arising due to the close proximity of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\nDay 1:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 became adorned by yellow wallpaper with a repeated floral pattern. A standard child\u2019s crib appeared within SCP-3347-2, along with a dresser drawer, a rainbow-striped carpet, and a stuffed rabbit.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n\nObject observations:\n Furnishings within SCP-3347-2 were unaltered save for the addition of a box containing large foam building blocks and a mobile attached to the rim of the crib.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n D-9951 claimed to have been awoken by the sound of crying coming from SCP-3347-2 at around 2:45 AM. The crying reportedly subsided about an hour later. All personnel within SCP-3347, including subject D-4217, were asleep during this time and did not report any auditory phenomena.\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nObject observations:\n Crib was replaced by a standard child-sized bed. A bookshelf equipped with children\u2019s books appeared. A stuffed dolphin replaced the stuffed rabbit.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 5:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A poster displaying each letter of the alphabet and a corresponding animal (alligator, baboon, etc.) appeared on the right wall of SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 6:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 7:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The wallpaper of SCP-3347-2 was removed and replaced by blue paint. A mural depicting an ocean, complete with fish, coral, and dolphins, covered the entirety of the back wall of SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 8:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The child sized bed within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a twin sized bed, underneath which was a box of LEGO bricks. The box of foam building blocks and the poster displaying the alphabet both disappeared.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Subject D-4217 reported the sound of muffled speech coming from within SCP-3347-2. Once alerted, D-9951 was able to hear it as well, although none of the other Foundation agents could. The noise ceased once the door of SCP-3347-2 was opened.\n\n\nDay 9:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 10:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A second bookshelf, containing more books, appeared adjacent to the first one. A Nintendo 3DS appeared on the bed.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 11:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 12:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A standard office desk, topped with a desk lamp, a pile of lined paper, and several pencils appeared in the left corner of SCP-3347-2. The twin sized bed was shifted further toward the right corner.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 13:\n\n\nObject observations:\n An HP brand laptop appeared on top of the desk within SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n High pitched laughter was heard from SCP-3347-2 by both D-4217 and D-9951. The noise ceased once the door to SCP-3347-1 was opened.\n\n\nDay 14:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 15:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The twin sized bed within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a queen-sized bed.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 16:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The box of legos and the Nintendo 3DS disappeared.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 17:\n\n\nObject observations:\n Approximately 75% of the books contained in the bookshelves of SCP-3347-2 disappeared.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 18:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Subjects D-4217 and D-9951 reported feeling a growing sense of sadness on the evening of Day 18. This feeling persisted through the night and reached its peak the next morning, at which time all furnishings within SCP-3347-2 had disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Day 18, SCP-3347-2 returned to its empty state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03347-B\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSubjects:\n D-7619 (Male) and D-3732 (Female)\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n Subject D-7691 has undergone multiple incarcerations prior to Foundation recruitment for crimes such as physical assault and domestic abuse. Subject D-3732 was incarcerated following the physical neglect of her child (now located in a foster care facility). Security agents are advised to be especially observant in order to prevent physical altercations between the subjects.\n\n\n\n\nDay 1:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A standard child\u2019s crib appeared within SCP-3347-2. No other furnishing alterations were observed.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Security personnel were awoken at around 3:45 AM by D-7619, who was shouting obscenities and banging his fists against the wall of SCP-3347-1. Subject reported \u201cnot being able to get any damn sleep because of all that fucking crying\u201d. Security personnel observed no anomalous auditory phenomena.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n The sound of crying emanating from SCP-3347-2 was reported by both subjects at around 2:15 PM. Subject D-7619 slammed his fist against the door of SCP-3347-2, and the crying ceased.\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nObject observations:\n An empty plastic bedpan appeared in the far right corner of SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 5:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The crib within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a standard child-sized bed.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 6:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 7:\n\n\nObject observations:\n Miscellaneous articles of children\u2019s clothing appeared across the floor of SCP-3347-2 in a random, disheveled fashion.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 8:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Subject D-7619 attempted to break down the door to SCP-3347-2, despite the fact that the door was unlocked. Subject was restrained by security personnel before the door could be breached. Upon questioning, D-7619 reported no anomalous observations other than a violent compulsion directed toward SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nDay 9:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 10:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 11:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A hole, approximately 12 centimeters in diameter, appeared in the east wall of SCP-3347-2. The hole appeared to have been created through the application of blunt force. This is the first recorded instance in which the structural constitution of SCP-3347-2 itself has been altered.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 12:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The child-sized bed within SCP-3347-2 disappeared and was replaced by a synthetic dark blue sleeping bag.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 13:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 14:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 15:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 16:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no anomalous furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Subject D-7619 entered SCP-3347-2 and systematically destroyed the contents of the room. This included cutting through the sleeping bag and much of the present clothing with scissors, snapping the bedpan in half, and creating several more holes in the walls. Subject was detained by security personnel and promptly terminated. Subject D-3732 was delivered class A amnestics and reassigned, and the experiment was prematurely concluded. All signs of activity within SCP-3347-2, including damage made to the walls of SCP-3347-2, disappeared the following day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a03347-C\u00a0(Warning:\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Required)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSubjects:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Lavinson (Male), Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Morris (Female)\n\n\nInformation of Note:\n In order to prevent research complications resulting from unprofessionalism, as seen in Experiment 3347-2, Dr. Lavinson volunteered to activate a Transposition Event for research purposes. Dr. Morris, assistant researcher of SCP-3347-B, agreed to partake in the process.\n\n\n\n\nDay 1:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 became furnished with pink wallpaper and purple carpeting. A standard child\u2019s crib appeared within SCP-3347-2, along with a dresser drawer and several stuffed animals, including a bear, a cat, and an elephant.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n The sound of crying from within SCP-3347-2 was observed by both Dr. Lavinson and Dr. Morris at around 2:30 am.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n\nObject observations:\n More stuffed animals appeared within SCP-3347-2, along with a bookshelf containing several children\u2019s books.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Crying was once again heard from within SCP-3347-2 at around 2:45 AM. Dr. Lavinson entered SCP-3347-2, causing the crying to cease. Dr. Lavinson did not exit SCP-3347-2 until around 5:00 AM.\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The crib within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a standard child-sized bed. A two-story dollhouse containing four plastic female dolls appeared in the front right corner of SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No miscellaneous occurrences of note.\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nObject observations:\n SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Dr. Lavinson heard laughter emanating from SCP-3347-2 for most of the day. No anomalous auditory phenomena were detected by Dr. Morris or any other personnel.\n\n\nDay 5:\n\n\nObject observations:\n A wooden rocking horse and a nightlight in the shape of a heart both appeared within SCP-3347-2.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n Dr. Lavinson spent the entirety of the day within SCP-3347-2. Dr. Morris entered SCP-3347-2 at around 10:30 PM and found Dr. Lavinson talking in a jovial manner to a nonexistent entity. Attempts to persuade Dr. Lavinson to leave SCP-3347-2 were unsuccessful. At 11:30 PM, security personnel entered SCP-3347-2 and attempted to remove Dr. Lavinson by force. Dr. Lavinson displayed uncharacteristically violent behavior, incapacitating one agent and forcefully removing the other from SCP-3347-2 before barricading the door (presumably with the bookshelf and the dresser drawer). Dr. Lavinson could be heard singing various lullabies up until 12:00 am, the time of the sixth Transposition Shift, at which time all noise from within SCP-3347-2 ceased.\n\n\nDay 6:\n\n\nObject observations:\n The bookshelf and dresser drawer within SCP-3347-2 had returned to their original positions. No other changes were observed.\n\n\nMiscellaneous observations:\n No signs of Dr. Lavinson were found within SCP-3347-2. The walls and windows of SCP-3347-2 were unbroken, making an escape through normal means impossible. Experimentation on SCP-3347 was permanently halted, and Dr. Morris was removed from the premises and promptly reassigned.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: On \u2588/\u2588/20\u2588\u2588 (10 days after Experiment 3347-C was concluded), Dr. Morris reported hearing the sounds of muffled speech and laughter at approximately 2:30 AM within her place of residence. The following morning, Dr. Morris found a note written on lined paper at the foot of her bed. The contents of said note are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nHello, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nSorry to disturb you. It won\u2019t happen again. She just wanted to see what you looked like. She never believed me when I told her how much she looked like you. I wish you were able to see her, she would have loved that so much, and I think you would have too.\n\n\n-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3346\n | SCP-3347 | \nSCP-3348\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3347\n\" by Wildman8, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

Miscellaneous observations: Crying was once again heard from within SCP-3347-2 at around 2:45 AM. Dr. Lavinson entered SCP-3347-2, causing the crying to cease. Dr. Lavinson did not exit SCP-3347-2 until around 5:00 AM. Day 3: Object observations: The crib within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a standard child-sized bed. A two-story dollhouse containing four plastic female dolls appeared in the front right corner of SCP-3347-2. Miscellaneous observations: No miscellaneous occurrences of note. Day 4: Object observations: SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations. Miscellaneous observations: Dr. Lavinson heard laughter emanating from SCP-3347-2 for most of the day. No anomalous auditory phenomena were detected by Dr. Morris or any other personnel. Day 5: Object observations: A wooden rocking horse and a nightlight in the shape of a heart both appeared within SCP-3347-2. Miscellaneous observations: Dr. Lavinson spent the entirety of the day within SCP-3347-2. Dr. Morris entered SCP-3347-2 at around 10:30 PM and found Dr. Lavinson talking in a jovial manner to a nonexistent entity. Attempts to persuade Dr. Lavinson to leave SCP-3347-2 were unsuccessful. At 11:30 PM, security personnel entered SCP-3347-2 and attempted to remove Dr. Lavinson by force. Dr. Lavinson displayed uncharacteristically violent behavior, incapacitating one agent and forcefully removing the other from SCP-3347-2 before barricading the door (presumably with the bookshelf and the dresser drawer). Dr. Lavinson could be heard singing various lullabies up until 12:00 am, the time of the sixth Transposition Shift, at which time all noise from within SCP-3347-2 ceased. Day 6: Object observations: The bookshelf and dresser drawer within SCP-3347-2 had returned to their original positions. No other changes were observed. Miscellaneous observations: No signs of Dr. Lavinson were found within SCP-3347-2. The walls and windows of SCP-3347-2 were unbroken, making an escape through normal means impossible. Experimentation on SCP-3347 was permanently halted, and Dr. Morris was removed from the premises and promptly reassigned.",
