Watchtowers disguised as civilian commodities are to be built around areas where SCP-4717-1 instances frequent. After SCP-4717-1 instances have left the area, Class-A amnestics will be provided to witnesses. A disinformation campaign has been put in place to cover the events as a PSA campaign from a Foundation front company. The PSAs are to replicate SCP-4717 events exactly, with the shooting locations to be where SCP-4717-1 instances reside.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4717 is an anomalous phenomon centered around the coastal areas of Australia, localized around the Eastern Coastline, stretching from Weipa, Queensland, to Melbourne, Victoria. The anomaly only activates if three certain conditions are met:\n\n\n\n\nThe location is within 300 metres of a beach area.\n\n\nThe location has a history of high profile drownings (specifically relating to riptides).\n\n\nThe location features a human currently caught in a riptide event.\n\n\n\n\nOnce these conditions are met, humanoid entities will manifest (designated SCP-4717-1), usually in a pair. SCP-4717-1 are humanoids resembling young adults in swimwear. These entities hold large signs that resemble gloved human hands, pointing either to the left or the right of the beach. Approximately 3 seconds after manifesting, they will proceed to the edge of the shoreline. After locating the person caught in the riptide, they will call out to the drowning individual, repeating the phrase: \"To escape a rip, swim parallel to the beach!\"\n\n\nIf the drowning individual notices the humanoids during this time, they will automatically understand the context and the instructions given to them, regardless whether the individual can physically hear the SCP-4717-1 instances. The individual will then swim along the coastline, eventually escaping the riptide and getting to safety. After the individual is confirmed to be no longer at risk of drowning, the instances will exit the immediate area and demanifest.\n\n\nIn all documented cases, there have been a total of eight fatalities during SCP-4717 events, despite the presence of SCP-4717-1.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-4717-A:\n During the manifestation of SCP-4717-1 instances, one humanoid noticed a Foundation agent (now designated SCP-4717-L), and fled the scene early, prompting a pursuit and capture for interrogation. The second humanoid demanifested before agents could apprehend and detain.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0SCP-4717-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Interview\u00a04717-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\nSCP-4717-L\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Alright, and we are live.

You're not gonna put my real name out there though, right?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No, your name will be censored, along with your voice. I wouldn't be able to pick you from a crowd.\n\n\n(Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 pulls out a notepad and places it on the table.)\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Right, so first things first.

Weird, but okay.\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Hey, can you not, like, say stuff like that? It may be silly, but at least it's unique!\n\n\n(Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 scribbles down on his notepad.)\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n: Sorry, I just haven't heard a name like that before, is it Greek?\n\n\n(SCP-4717-L chuckles.)\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n If only it was! I'm actually from Walloongoong.\n1\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh, really? I'm from there too.\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n What!? Oh fuck yeah! We got another Gong'r!\n\n\n(SCP-4717-L goes for a high five, which Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reciprocates.)\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Man, it's so good to see someone from my town!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Same here, man! But we going slightly off topic. What if we talked after this, huh?\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Yeah, that would be awesome!\n\n\n(Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 flips a page of his notepad.)\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n To be honest, there's only one question I need to ask you. What is it that you do exactly? Like do you work for someone, or is it just you?\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Oh, is that it? I can give you a few details, but the rest you'll have to talk to my manager about, he knows more than me. I'll give you his details. Can I borrow that notepad?\n\n\n(Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 pushes the audio tape closer, and gives his notepad to SCP-4717-L, who talks whilst writing.)\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Truth is, I work for a company, Sorl's Surfing and Lifesavers' Club. And while I really want to be a lifeguard, I can't swim very well, shows what school does for ya!\n\n\n(SCP-4717-L laughs for a brief moment).\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Oh man, I hated high school. But anyway, instead of throwing my dreams away like a fuckwit, I decided to save people another way, with signs! Now I can't tell you how they work, but I can say that they work tremendously well! I just hope I can keep my job here, it's a competitive business.\n\n\n(SCP-4717-L pulls out an ID card from its breast pocket and hands it to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, along with the notepad.)\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Aaaand there we are, here's my ID, in case they ask, and my managers number. Just ring him up, he\u2019ll help you with anything you ask. You need anything else?\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No, that's actually pretty good, thanks for this! The police should escort you out soon, I'll meet you outside.\n\n\nSCP-4717-L:\n Nice! I'll be sure to wait for you!\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-4717-L demanifested after exiting the interview room. \nAfter extensive testing, the number and ID given by SCP-4717-L were proven to be falsified, as the phone company that used 04\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had it discontinued in 1976, due to electrical problems in Southern Queensland.

Using other people's intellectual property without a single ounce of regret or remorse?

I wasn't a part of the meeting, nor did I film the ads. I merely authorized it.\n\n\nSCP-4717-M:\n Oh, stop lying Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, you were present at the shooting locations from day one!

You were the director, and therefore you were responsible for the broadcasting of these adverts. You knew what the consequences of infringing on the Sorl's company was, and yet you decided to go ahead and the green light it anyway!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n No, no no no, you can't just sue us!

I don't want to have to go through all the paperwork and the fees, not to mention the fine you guys would end up dishing out afterwards.
