I mean, should I just watch my words around you all the time?\u201d\n\n\nI carefully choose my words before I respond.\n\n\nI have to.\n\n\nBecause I don\u2019t get the same luxury as you.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I get what you\u2019re saying. I understand. But you could\u2019ve said it differently. You could\u2019ve been nicer/quieter/kinder/less public about it.\u201d\n\n\nI scream into the void. Quietly. I lock away the hurt and anger and humiliation and pain and carefully place my hand on your shoulder and tell you I get it, it is hard, I\u2019m so glad you try, but please, please don\u2019t say that, please don\u2019t, please just respect me for who I tell you I am, please,\n\n\nI swallow the tears and curse words because if I don\u2019t, it\u2019ll just be \ngiving you a reason to disregard my request\n.\n\n\nWe live in a binary world, trapped in binary minds. You said a Bad Thing, but you\u2019re a Good Person. And saying a Bad Thing is something a Bad Person does, and you\u2019re not a Bad Person. So I must\u2019ve interpreted it wrong, or misunderstood your intentions. You have to explain to me you\u2019re a Good Person, still.\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even enter your mind that sometimes, Good People still do Bad Things. The world doesn\u2019t judge you by your intentions. I certainly don\u2019t.\n\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you that. Because you\u2019ll never listen to me again if I do.\n\n\nI have to earn being heard.\n\n\nSo I swallow. And I hide. And I ask you, kindly, calmly, please: just hear me. Just accept who I tell you I am. It\u2019s not binary. You can be a third thing: a Better person: someone who learned.\n\n\nAnd I support you through the hurt I caused you by being hurt.\n\n\n\n\nSwanTran tool update: Special Containment Procedures entered.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Please enter a description\n\u2013 a random \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset 3\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut if they find your bones 200 years from now, what would they call you?\u201d\n\n\nHave you ever wondered what would flash before your eyes? What would you see in that last moment before the lights go out? One bright spark, a shock to the system before shutdown.\n\n\nSo many memories to choose from. A lifetime worth of data, little 1s and 0s, strung together.\n\n\nWe live in a binary world. A world of facts, data, 1s and 0s. But we colour it. Turn it into a spectrum of colours and nuance. A beautiful painting of depth and perspective.\n\n\nA perspective unique to just me. Isn\u2019t it all just an amazing feat. A beautiful trick of the mind.\n\n\nI\u2019m not anyone\u2019s story to tell. I am my own. They can find my bones 200 years from now, tell a new story with those building blocks. God knows how true that story will be \u2013 but here\u2019s the kicker: it doesn\u2019t have to be. A story is only a truth for the person telling it.\n\n\nThe narrative they\u2019ll tell with my bones, it\u2019ll only say something about the narrator. Their perspective. Their experience of the world. Plenty of stories of people like me have been forgotten. Rewritten, renamed, deadnamed, by those who get to decide.\n\n\nSo first we hide. Then we revolt. Then we celebrate. Take Pride in who we are, yell at that binary world in colours and perspectives previously unheard. Redacted. Removed.\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll keep on yelling. Screaming. Until we are heard. Until all of us are heard.\n\n\nUntil we are no longer exceptions. Until the day we are mundane.\n\n\nGod, I can\u2019t wait to be mundane.\n\n\n\n\nSwanTran Tool: Analysis complete. Compose file?

There is no available connection for an external power source, and no detectable internal battery. Current hypothesis is that it is powered by absorbing energy from organic matter in its surroundings.\n\n\nThe attached visual display switches between 3 headers on a 10 second timer, reading \"EAST\", \"WEST\" and \"CENTRAL\", with no accompanying text underneath. The counter in the top right corner indicates the existence of 10 available headers in total.\n\n\nSCP-7422 came into Foundation possession as part of a collection of anomalous technological artifacts seized after a tip from the AIVD.\n1\n\n\nOn 2023-11-10, the device activated unexpectedly during analysis of its components. An electrical shockwave transmitted from the device disconnected most of Site-312\u2019s integrated systems, resulting in a site-wide blackout. The investigator and only attendant, Site-312 Head of Technical Infrastructure Mx. Harrit Swanepoel, was the sole casualty.\n\n\nThe body of Mx. Swanepoel was disintegrated completely upon activation of SCP-7422. Their ashes were returned to their family after thorough analysis showed no anomalous properties.\n\n\nDocumentation for SCP-7422 was uploaded via the SwanTran tool to lead researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek's review queue, and has been included unaltered.\n\n\nSCP-7422 has not activated since.\n\n\nSwanTran Tool: Update, additional data found.\n\nOn 2024-04-22, a 4th header and additional text appeared on the visual display of SCP-7422.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Header: URGENT\n\u20131s and 0s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01001001\n\n00100000\n\n01100001\n\n01101101\n\n00100000\n\n01100001\n\n01101100\n\n01101001\n\n01110110\n\n01100101\n\n00001010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7422\n\" by FlyPurgatorio, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
