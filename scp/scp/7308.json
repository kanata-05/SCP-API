All attempts to perceive the true appearance of SCP-7308 have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7308 was discovered in Poplar Grove, Illinois after reports of an \"orb\" wandering a local apple orchard. Following the capture of SCP-7308, Gate B of Site-309 was blasted down by Soupglop, a known reality bender residing in Three Portlands, demanding that SCP-7308 be returned to her.\n\n\nAfter fourteen hours of standard de-escalation procedures, Dr. Noah Addams managed to conduct an interview with Soupglop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n Are you ready to cooperate? Or am I going to have to call in the tranq unit again?\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Fine. \nFine.\n But mark my words, young man, I'm gonna be casting \nsooooo\n many hexes on you later. I'm gonna\u2026\n\n\nSoupglop gestures her hands in the air wildly.\n\n\nSoupglop:\n And you're gonna be \nSORRY\n.\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n I\u2026 Okay. Well, to start, what \nis\n SCP-7308?\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Ha! What is it? It's my INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, that's what it is.\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n To be clear, I'm talking about the\u2026 red circle thing.\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Wait, \ncircle?\n I thought I upgraded to the \norb\n package! Goddammit. I'm so fucking mad. I suck at contracts. Always using so much \nLANGUAGE\n. I\u2014\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n No\u2014 it's\u2014 you did fine. It's an orb. I just misspoke. Sorry.\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Huh. How the fuck did you go from orb to circle? There's a whole DIMENSION of difference. I thought you people were supposed to be smart!\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n I just misspoke. I'd appreciate moving on now.\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Peh. Fine.\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n So, again. What is SCP-7308, and why can we only perceive it as an orb?\n\n\nSoupglop:\n You see him like that because you hold \nno\n shares! Nobody does! Because all the shares are \nmine.\n I copyrighted him!\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n Well\u2026 then what do \nyou\n see it as?\n\n\nSoupglop:\n He's a large man with white fur. He has big muscles. He would be my husband but he's kind of stupid, so I copyrighted him instead. I call him \"Yeti\" and he's one of a kind. That's why Lord Alrights allowed me to finalize the ritual.\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n Hm. One moment, please.\n\n\nDr. Addams stands, retrieves a manilla folder, then pushes it towards Soupglop. She begins inspecting its contents.\n\n\nDr. Addams:\n Did you know that \nthere\n \nare\n \ncountless\n \nentities\n that are almost identical to your \"Yeti\"? Therefore\u2026\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Oh\u2026 oh no.\n\n\nA tear in reality suddenly forms above Soupglop. An eye emerges, staring directly at her.\n\n\nUNKNOWN:\n SOUPGLOP. YOU HAVE \nLIED\n, AND BETRAYED LORD ALRIGHTS. FOR THIS YOU WILL BE PUNISHED.\n\n\nSoupglop:\n Wait, wait, I didn't know! I didn't\u2014\n\n\nUNKNOWN:\n IGNORANCE IS \nNOT\n FORGIVEN. PERISH.\n\n\nSoupglop disintegrates into a pile of salt, and the tear closes.\n\n\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the interview, it was discovered that SCP-7308 had disintegrated into a pile of ground black pepper.
