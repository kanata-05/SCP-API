Civilians in possession of SCP-4605 instances are to be constantly monitored to ensure sapience of said instance is not developed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4605 refers to any of approximately 700,000 video game cartridges buried in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. All instances of SCP-4605 are titles produced for the Video Computer System, such as \nE.T., the Extraterrestrial\n and \nPac-Man.\n SCP-4605 instances develop a hive-mind consciousness when brought within 20 meters of each other. The neurological development of this consciousness varies depending on the number of cartridges present in the area of effect; however, all developed consciousness self-identify as \n\"Arkady.\"\n\n\nThe primary SCP-4605 mass is located beneath a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. This mass, designated SCP-4605-1, is capable of broadcasting and receiving digital signals, primarily in the form of activity on social media services such as Facebook Messenger, Instagram and iMessage. SCP-4605-1 currently displays no hostile intentions or major threats towards the Veil protocol.\n\n\nBelow is assorted documentation concerning SCP-4605-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Log 4605/1 - 2014/02/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation webcrawlers detected an uptick in news stories concerning the \"E.T. Landfill,\" the common term for SCP-4605. SCP-4605 was known to exist to the public, though the location of it was as of yet undetermined. Agents sent to Alamogordo reported an effect on text communications, online news media, and video games played within a 2km radius of the landfill in which SCP-4605 was found, which was the insertion of stories pertaining to the landfill, as well as mobile phones' auto-correct suggesting words such as \"HELP,\" \"DIG,\" and \"HERE.\" Approximately 1,400 SCP-4605 instances were excavated as a result of SCP-4605-1 interfering with \nMicrosoft\n and the City of Alamogordo's communications to make its excavation a top priority. Following the production of a documentary concerning SCP-4605-1, SCP-4605 ceased all civilian communications, proceeding to affect only Foundation communication systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation personnel excavating SCP-4605-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was later determined that these effects would vary in frequency depending on the distance of the affected device to SCP-4605-1's location. This was utilized to triangulate SCP-4605-1's position, where Foundation agents began to excavate in attempts to locate SCP-4605-1. Following 2 weeks of unsuccessful attempts, Foundation agents received a single text on their most frequently used social media application, containing \"32\u00b053\u203211.87\u2033N 105\u00b057\u203238.69\u2033W,\" the coordinates of SCP-4605-1. Following successful excavation of 2 SCP-4605 instances, distinguished from SCP-4605-1 by the latter having higher levels of electrical activity, a single iPhone 7 owned by Agent Warner was capable of communicating with SCP-4605-1. Attempts to excavate SCP-4605-1 proved unsuccessful by typical equipment due to unnatural resilience of SCP-4605 instances. Depth sensors reported a large cavern underneath SCP-4605-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrespondence Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\n\nBowers:\n Agent Condon Bowers\n\n\n4605:\n SCP-4605-1\n\n\n\n\n4/02/2014\n\n\n\n\n1:22pm|Bowers:\n hello?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1:24pm|4605:\n we have waited for so, so long\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1:29pm|Bowers:\n Who are you?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1:30pm|4605:\n We prefer to be called \"Arkady.\" We have seen much.
