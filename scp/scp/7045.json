SCP-7045's containment locker is to fit with a motion detector and miniature camera. If SCP-7045 breaches containment, on-site security are to search for SCP-7045. Once found, SCP-7045 is to be examined for recordings and is to be escorted back into its containment locker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7045 was the designation used to describe a 2001, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand, hand-held microcassette tape recorder. SCP-7045 was of standard design, with pause, play, fast forward/rewind, and record buttons. All recordings recovered from SCP-7045 are of a sound-quality consist with that of similar recording devices.\n\n\nSCP-7045 had the anomalous ability to teleport and record without external input. SCP-7045 was estimated to have had a teleportation radius of approximately 1.2\u00a0km. The content of SCP-7045's recordings have varied, but the majority have involved important historical events, generally related to or involving the Foundation.\n\n\nWhen SCP-7045 teleports, a new tape is replaced within its cartage. This caused extreme difficulty in retrieving audio recordings from SCP-7045. After attempting to record an event in reality \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-7045 ceased all anomalous activity. The cause of SCP-7045's sudden neutralization remains unknown.\n\n\nAddendum 7045.1\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n[HOWLING WIND BLOWS AGAINST THE MICROPHONE. FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH THE DIRT AS SOMEONE APPROACHES.]\n\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n\nHm? How did this get here? Ah, whatever. There's no point in worrying about it now, what with the end of the world and all.\n\n\n[UNKNOWN PAUSES BEFORE PICKING UP SCP-7045.]\n\n\nAlthough, it is nice to have someone- sorry, something to talk to. My name is Victor, I work for this, organization. You \nmight\n have heard of us. We're kind of the cause of this whole mess.\n\n\nI work for the SCP Foundation.\n\n\nWe contain the nastiest creatures and anomalies of the world and whatnot, but I guess one of our gruesome monstrosities got out, and the world is now ending. I would try and do something to stop this apocalypse, but sadly there doesn't seem to be anything I can do. To whomever it may concern, SCP-[REDACTED] has breached containment, and now\u2026 well, the only way I can describe it is that the world\u2026 is afraid.\n\n\nThe world is afraid and nothing but. The sky has been torn in two, a rift to some other reality having warped our own. Biomes have switched places entirely, while our reality slowly succumbs to pure, unmotivated chaos. Or maybe there was some motivation behind the end of our world. Who knows?\n\n\nI now walk alone- well, if you don't count Harry. I think he's off looking for food\u2026 we travel together as the world ends, looking for a solution to our world's madness. But there's\u2026 nothing.\n\n\nSorry, I know that was both an information dump and slightly ominous at that. I've\u2026 always enjoyed horror, so I guess the creepy, esoteric tone just comes naturally. What I'm trying to say is the world went to hell and all I can-\n\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n\nVictor? Are you over here?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nI'm over here, Harry. Look what I've found- oh god\u2026\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nI know\u2026 It's getting worse.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nShould I check my foot as well?\n\n\nHarry\n\n\n[HARRY USES A DISGUSTED TONE.]\n\nDon't. I'd rather not see another person's bones.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\n[INDIGNATION.]\n\n\nExcuse me?\n I look at your arm-\n\n\nHarry\n\n\n[IGNORES VICTOR.]\n\nWhere'd you get the tape recorder?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nOh, I found it. It was already recording and everything.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\n[CONCERNED.]\n\nDo you think it's anomalous?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nDo you think it matters right now? Look around us, Harry. Do you want to talk about work when the entire world is doing just that?\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nI- I don't know. I just was asking what you thought-\n\n[DISTANT HOWLING IN THE DISTANCE.]\n\n\u2026\n\nWe should get moving.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nAgreed.\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n[A SLIGHT HUM FILLS THE BACKGROUND OF THE RECORDING.]\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nThe air is\u2026 thin. It's not the thin air that someone would breathe when climbing a mountain. It's the thin air of a world falling apart. As the oxygen begins to slowly break down with everything else in the world, I feel my own body begin to break apart as well.\n\n\nYou know\u2026 I didn't expect death to be so slow. I always thought my death would be in some hospital with my life-support getting pulled. But no, I'm being erased from existence-\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nDo you \nhave\n to talk to that thing while I'm sitting right here?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nWell, sorry, but I just don't feel safe when walking around. If society hadn't lost its cool and the wilderness hadn't absorbed the cities across the globe, I would \nhappily\n walk away and spare your ears. But, right now, that isn't the case. Deal with it.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nFine. Sorry.\n\n\u2026\n\nDo you think this is salvageable? Do you think the O4 Council can\u2026 fix this?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nI'm pretty sure it's the \"O5\" Council.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nAre you sure? I thought Level 4 was our highest security level.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nHarry. \nWe're\n at a level 4 security.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nOh\u2026 I guess you're right\u2026 Sorry, I guess the end of the world is getting to me.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nIt's fine. And I think they \nmight\n be doing something. Or\u2026 maybe they realize how far-gone the world is and they are kicking their feet back and are waiting it out like us.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\n[LACK-LUSTER CHUCKLE]\n\nYeah, I guess that wouldn't be too far off. I mean, how would they even fix this?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\n\u2026\n\nDo you have any family back home? I- I know it's a touchy subject right now, but I'm not sure what else we can really\u2026 talk about.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nI've got a wife and a daughter. We live in the city next to where our Site is.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nHmm. I've got a wife, but no kids. We weren't able to make that work.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nUnderstandable- Oh.\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nJesus- that hurts\u2026\n\n[GROANS OUT OF PAIN.]\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nThis is taking so long. Who- Who knew that a dematerializing body would hurt so bad?\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nYou know what? Screw it. If I'm dying I'm going to spill my guts on something that won't get annoyed when listening.\n\n\nHarry\n\n\nHey, I try-\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nKidding, \nkidding\n. I'm still going to go spill my guts though-\n\n\nHarry\n\n\n[CHUCKLES HALFWAY THROUGH A GROAN OF PAIN.]\n\nAll right, go ahead, I guess.\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nAh, well. Where to start? I guess I can share how it all started-\n\n\n[AN EXPLOSION SIMILAR TO A BREAK IN THE SOUND BARRIER BOOMS IN THE DISTANCE.]\n\n\nAh, well. Guess that's my cue to get on with it. I guess it all started with me going to work. I got to our site and clocked in as per usual. And until around midday, everything was fine. Until things went sideways faster than you could say \"Boo.\" Literally.\n\n\nThere was a bang, kind of like the one you just heard, except it was loud enough that even news stations on the other side of the world were reporting on it. And then\u2026 the rip opened. It was a break between whatever barrier the Foundation used to describe the multiverse.\n\n\nWhen the rift opened, things began to change, slowly. But-\n\n\n[GROANS IN PAIN.]\n\n\nThe process has \nsped up,\n as to say. Anyways, though, we did our best to get people to safety, but there have been some\u2026 road bumps, along the way. I'll keep those details to myself, thanks.\n\n\n[STATIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND.]\n\n\nLike how I've wondered how death would feel, I also have wondered what is beyond this life. Will I even move on, if I am erased from existence? I guess I will find out soon. I wish I could have seen my wife, Rosey, again before the end. Or maybe I wouldn't want to see her die. No, I wouldn't have liked to see that.\n\n\nMaybe I won't go back to Harry. No, we weren't meant to die together. We simply work together, but I barely know him.\n\n\n[STATIC INTENSIFIES]\n\n\nWell, I guess I get to know then, the answers to my questions.\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n[THE HUMMING OF AN UNKNOWN TUNE.]\n\n\nDr. Richardson\n\n\nOh? When did you get there? Did Binkard leave you here on record?\n\n\n[CLICK]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7045 was found in Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Richardson's office, sitting on his desk. Dr. Richardson reported the object once his assistant had denied placing SCP-7045 on his desk.
