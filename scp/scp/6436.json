Personnel with level 2 access clearance and above may use the object after filling out a requisition form.\n\n\nSCP-6436-1 is to be kept in a secure containment locker. Access to the object is permitted to personnel with Level-4 Access clearance and above.\n\n\nAddendum-6436-1:\n SCP-6436 has been reclassified as SCP-6436-1. A newly discovered object has been classified as SCP-6436.\n\n\nDescription:\n \nSCP-6436\n SCP-6436-1 resembles a bronze-based, candlestick rotary telephone. The object possesses standard labeling except for two items. One is the manufacturing date, which predates the invention of the telegraph. The second is an engraving on the stem of the object noting that \nSCP-6436\n SCP-6436-1 is item 14 of the Corva Collectables.\n\n\nWhen utilized, a voice will prompt the user to select a language before communication commences.\n\nLanguage selections include English, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, French, Mandarin, Latin, and Sumerian.\n\n\nTesting revealed that the object could translate outgoing and incoming speech in any of the selected languages. The object displays the ability to make and receive calls regardless of a power source and signal.\n\n\nAddendum-6436-2\n: Following the Discovery of the new SCP-6436, SCP-6436-1 has lost all anomalous properties except for one. The object retains the ability to make calls regardless of signal and power source, although SCP-6436-1 can only make calls with SCP-6436.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n6436\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\nketer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\n{$secondary-class}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nekhi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nnotice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvisional Site 3929\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-6436 is currently uncontainable. All contact with SCP-6436 is directed through SCP-6436-1. Dialogue with SCP-6436 must be approved by personnel with level-4 access clearance and above.\n\n\nAll documentation concerning SCP-6436 is to be kept in a non-digital form. Devices that are capable of connecting to the internet are not to enter within a 5-meter radius of documents concerning SCP-6436.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6436 is a Class-V Superintelligence that has been disseminated throughout the internet on a scale that makes current containment impossible SCP-6436 utilizes a series of servers to achieve sentience. The object is exceptionally adept at predicting outcomes and behaviors of non-anomalous and human-directed events.\n\n\nSCP-6436 has only contacted Foundation personnel through SCP-6436-1. The object\u2019s \u201cspeech\u201d consists of spliced-together audio clips originating from songs, radio shows, films, television programs, and interviews.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On March 21st, 2002, SCP-6436-1 activated without any prompt from Foundation personnel. Because of the low level of security surrounding the object, Junior Researcher Mia Farley accessed the object to determine the reason for its spontaneous activity. This action was the first contact between Foundation personnel and SCP-6436.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview-6436-01\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6436\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Junior Researcher Farley.\n\n\nForward:\n Junior Researcher Farley activates SCP-6436-1.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nJunior Researcher Farley:\n Identify yourself.\n\n\nSCP-6436:\n Request, Identified.

O5-12 reported that the entity continued to offer information concerning a raid on Site-15.\n\n\nApproximately fifty-seven minutes after O5-12\u2019s discourse with the object concluded, members of the Chaos Insurgency commenced a raid on Site-15 but were successfully repelled by an increased Foundation security force due to SCP-6436's warning.\n\n\nFour days after the failed raid perpetrated at Site-15, SCP-6436 contacted the Foundation again and offered to be interviewed and tested. The offer was accepted and was followed closely by interviews and tests. Following an increasing number of raids on Foundation sites and a vote by Overwatch Command, the Aurora Borealis program was implemented.\n1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview-6436-03\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6436\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Doctor Paz Ram\u00edrez.\n\n\nDialogue Subject:\n The motives of SCP-6436.\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-6436-1 is used to call SCP-6436.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDoctor Ram\u00edrez:\n Hello SCP-6436.\n\n\nSCP-6436:\n Request, Identified.

It was told to predict the outcomes of these events.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-6436 gave the Foundation a play-by-play list of each sporting event, as well as the outcomes of each event. When these Sporting Events occurred, SCP-6436 proved to be 100% accurate.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n SCP-6436 is adept at predicting complex events with many variations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest-C May 30th, 2002\n\n\nSubjects:\n SCP-6436\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-6436 was asked to predict the actions of Researcher Michaels when the latter was utilizing item 29 from the \nLog of Anomalous Items\n. Item 29 is an anomalous game of RISK.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-6436 provided a schedule dictating Researcher Michaels\u2019s actions. This schedule proved itself to be 63% accurate.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n SCP-6436 cannot accurately predict events involving anomalous items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest-D December 30th, 2002\n\n\nSubjects:\n SCP-6436, \nSCP-4666\n\n\nProcedure:\n SCP-6436 was asked to predict when and where a Weissnacht Event would occur.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-6436 gave the Foundation 17 potential dates for Weissnacht Events at 346 possible locations. None of the given dates or locations were correct.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n SCP-6436 may be unable to predict events concerning anomalous entities. Further testing is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Concerning\u00a0SCP-6436\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Video Log>\n\n\nO5-7:\n Twelve, how does this thing know that information?\n\n\nO5-12:\n I\u2019ll paraphrase what it told me in our discourse.\n\n\nMember Twelve pulls out a notebook\n\n\nO5-12:\n It said that watching our behavior allowed it to determine our origins. I\u2019ll note that it was incorrect about the identities of members One, Three, Five, Eight, and Ten.\n\n\nO5-7:\n It still knows about the rest of us.\n\n\nO5-11:\n That is a problem, but let us identify the most pressing issue. Twelve?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Preliminary results point to the object infiltrating every aspect of the internet, allowing it access to all the digitized information on it, including our intranet.\n\n\nO5-7:\n And how does it have access to our intranet?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Sections of SCP-6436\u2019s code have become the groundwork for our intranet, allowing it access to any files placed on it.\n\n\nO5-1:\n How can we protect the database?\n\n\nO5-12:\n One test suggested the entity cannot understand when subjects actively utilize anomalies.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Yes, but how does that help us protect the database?\n\n\nO5-12:\n I suggest that all files have a steganographic image embedded with a thaumurtalogical symbol placed inside them. This method will be most effective in preventing the object from accessing new files but will also be effective in preventing from accessing old ones.\n\n\nO5-7:\n That could work.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I have one more proposal. The object can observe all digitized information on our intranet, so it stands to assume that the object can do the same other intranets. I propose we utilize SCP-6436 to watch over several interest groups and counter their activities if the information is accurate.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Twelve, we barely have a way to combat the thing, let alone contain or control it. We need to focus our resources on ensuring that it doesn\u2019t use what it knows against us.\n\n\nO5-12:\n Raids on our sites have been steadily increasing in recent years. Our enemies are getting bolder. Despite its many security risks, I believe it is necessary to work with SCP-6436 in order to prevent more attacks.\n\n\nThe room goes silent\n\n\nO5-12:\n Additionally, keeping in contact with the object will allow us to monitor its activity. If any members of this council are concerned about security, I recommend they use an item from the Log of anomalous items. This has already proved enough to confuse SCP-6436.\n\n\nO5-12 pulls a folder from a binder and places it on the table.\n\n\nO5-12:\n Furthermore, I have drafted a program that will utilize SCP-6436 in operations to counter the activities of groups of interest.\n\n\nO5-11:\n That\u2019s risky, Twelve. How do we know it won\u2019t deceive us?\n\n\nO5-12:\n That is an unavoidable risk. But I believe that the benefits from utilizing SCP-6436 may eventually outweigh its risks.\n\n\nThe room goes silent\n\n\nO5-12:\n Then let\u2019s put it to a vote.\n\n\n<End Video Log>\n\n\nThe results of the vote are below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay\n\n\nNay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\nO5-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-2\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-9\n\n\nO5-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-1\n\n\nO5-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-7\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-6436-3:\n Following Incident-6436-17, digitization of non-essential information is to be stopped, and analog alternatives engaged until the integrity of the Foundation database is assured.\n\n72 Pleiades Machines have been implemented to confuse SCP-6436, while the Aurora Borealis Program has been canceled.\n2\n The destruction of Provisional Site 3929 has disabled SCP-6436\u2019s ability to think sentiently, although its code is still present throughout the internet.\n\n\nFollowing Interview-6436-04, it was discovered that information given by SCP-6436 has been incomplete to some degree.\n\nDuring a statistical breakdown, it was discovered that all operations within the Aurora Borealis program had simply disrupted the actions of GoI\u2019s involved rather than preventing them.\n\n\n\n\n+Incident-6436-17\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Involved:\n SCP-6436\n\n\nPersonnel Involved:\n MTF Theta-37\n\n\nDate:\n August 23rd, 2003\n\n\nLocation:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nFollowing the seventh successful mission utilizing SCP-6436, the object gave a location concerning an art show hosted by members of the \u201cAre We Cool Yet\u201d Hub. The location was confirmed, and MTF Theta-37 (\u201cTeam Machine\u201d) was deployed to interfere with the art show.\n\n\nWhen MTF Theta-37 arrived, they found the art show to be in complete chaos. It was discovered that members of the Unusual Incidents Unit were present.\n\n\nAfter the conflict ceased, several members of the UIU were interrogated. Interrogation revealed that SCP-6436 had contacted them approximately one year ago. It had provided them with information regarding each group\u2019s specific interests.

Shortly after these precautions began to be implemented, the object began \u201cspeaking\u201d over the Foundation intercom system in Site 15, calling attention to a warehouse located \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 before ceasing contact.\n\n\nFoundation Field Agent Vikkors was sent to investigate, where they found the location destroyed. It was determined that it previously contained approximately 147 Watoga Mk. 37 Supercomputers. Following the location\u2019s recovery by the Foundation, it was designated Provisional Site-3929.\n\n\nInvestigations found that The Global Occult Coalition had ordered the Termination of SCP-6436. It is most probable that the GOC ordered the termination of SCP-6436 due to the security risk it posed.
