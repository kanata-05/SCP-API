The entity is permitted to attend weekly Greek lessons with the goal of facilitating communication. SCP-4721 is allowed access to mathematical resources and learning materials on request, contingent on good behavior.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4721 is an anachronistic middle-aged male human who identifies himself as Euclid\n1\n. The entity possesses considerable skill in geometry and mathematical construction. SCP-4721 is fluent in Ancient Greek, permitting a rudimentary dialogue to form between the entity and Modern Greek speakers.\n\n\nSCP-4721 was discovered near the Bibliotheca Alexandria, a national library located in Alexandria, Egypt. Temporal analysis indicates SCP-4721 originated from before the activation of the first Abrahamic eigenweapon, approximately 2,000 years ago. No further anomalous properties have been observed; the investigation into the cause of the entity\u2019s temporal displacement is ongoing. The identity of SCP-4721 was suspected after Dr. Krain, the first researcher to initiate contact, recognized that the entity was attempting to communicate through repeatedly tapping the first four prime numbers.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n1\n. Author of mathematical textbook \nElements\n and considered the father of geometry.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4721-1:\n Following the initial containment of SCP-4721, Dr. Krain requested an interview to assist the entity in adjusting to captivity. A partial transcript is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4721\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Connor Krain\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview assisted by a translator in real time; all statements transcribed in English.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Hello there. My name is Dr. Krain, and I\u2019ll be helping you acclimate to this facility. And you are?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I\u2019m Euclid, a mathematician from Alexandria\u2026 Where am I, exactly? Nothing seems the least bit familiar.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n It\u2019s\u2026 complicated to explain. You\u2019re a long time away from when you last remember. For safety reasons, you\u2019ll be required to stay in this cell.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n What do you mean, \u201ca long time away\u201d?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Euclid, you\u2019ve somehow found yourself over two-thousand years in the future.\n\n\nSCP-4721 remains silent for approximately thirty seconds\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n And I can\u2019t get back to my time?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n No, unfortunately. We don\u2019t know how to do that.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n This\u2026 this doesn\u2019t make any sense. I was walking to the library, and, next thing I know, I\u2019m somewhere completely unfamiliar, surrounded by strangers in unusual clothing.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n We don\u2019t know how this happened either, but you\u2019ll be required to live here from now on.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I can\u2019t leave? Ever?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Well, you see, a lot of things have changed, and you would have trouble fitting in, especially since your native tongue isn\u2019t spoken anymore. As such, we feel it is better for everyone if you stay here.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n And do what? Rot away for the rest of my days?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Not quite. You would have access to a variety of different activities. Writing, reading\u2026 mathematics.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n Mathematics?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Of course. You are in the future, after all. I\u2019m sure you would be interested in seeing where the field has gone after all this time.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n Did\u2026 was my life\u2019s work influential? Did anything ever come of it?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Euclid, I think you\u2019ll find that your work grew into the backbone of an entire branch of mathematics, which has produced countless results and sprouted new areas of study you couldn\u2019t even imagine.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n And\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to work and learn on this from in here?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n As long as you follow our directions, you would be allowed access to all the mathematics you\u2019d like.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n That\u2019s spectacular! Where do I even start? I can\u2019t fathom the developments that have occurred since my time.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n I\u2019m glad you\u2019re so excited. First, you should start with understanding what\u2019s changed about the fundamentals. Have you ever heard of the number zero?\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAfter this interview, SCP-4721 proceeded to indulge himself in mathematical literature of varying complexity. In the months afterwards, he eventually settled into a pattern of reading and studying, beginning with learning symbolic representation and its application to arithmetic.\n\n\nAddendum 4721-2:\n Following over two years in containment, SCP-4721 grew notably unmotivated and distressed in any form of mathematics, despite having progressed through elementary algebra relatively well. This sudden change in behavior prompted an interview on May 27th, 2019.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4721\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Connor Krain\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview assisted by a translator in real time; all statements transcribed in English.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Hello, Euclid. How are you today?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n Greetings, Doctor. I\u2019m\u2026 alright.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n I notice that you haven\u2019t picked up a book all week.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I\u2019ve been\u2026 busy. Why do you ask?\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Well, ever since you first learnt about all the mathematics that\u2019s been discovered since your time, you\u2019ve constantly had your nose deep in a book. That is, before this year, when your checkout rates slowed to a halt. I was just asking if there was a particular reason why?\n\n\nSCP-4721 pauses before answering\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I just\u2026 I don\u2019t desire to do so, anymore.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Do you want to talk about it?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I suppose it\u2019s inevitable. Might as well.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Go ahead.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n Well, I\u2019m growing older. I\u2019m not as agile as I used to be, and ideas don\u2019t come to me as quickly as they used to.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n You\u2019ve been struggling?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n Not just that. Struggling implies I have a chance. I feel like I\u2019m completely overwhelmed by the amount of mathematics I have yet to and will never learn.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n It\u2019s a big field, and you have a lot to catch up on. You can\u2019t take that personally.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n It\u2019s just\u2026 before, I used to be leading the charge. I was discovering the patterns of prime numbers; I was formalizing the postulates of geometry. And now, I\u2019m struggling with problems even children easily surpass.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n You have to realize the paradigm shift between your time and ours. So much has been developed over two millennia that the best anyone can hope for nowadays is to specialize in one particular area.\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n But that\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m not even good enough to specialize in the field I founded! My work has been built on and expanded upon so much that it has become intertwined and inseparable from areas of math I haven\u2019t even heard of! I\u2019ve been left behind without the tools or ability to get back, nor the time or resilience to acquire such.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n And this has been upsetting you so much so as to disrupt your daily life?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n It\u2019s\u2026 I have nothing to do in this stone prison other than math, and every time I do so I encounter nothing but frustration and disappointment.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Well, I could look into other activities that you could-\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n No, that wouldn\u2019t solve it. I\u2019m past my prime, and I just wish I could forget all about mathematics. My intellect can serve it no more.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n You\u2026 want to forget it? All of it, even the geometry you discovered?\n\n\nSCP-4721:\n I wish I could just forget everything and escape this numerical torment. But alas, it seems I am doomed to spend the rest of my years in this torturous cave.\n\n\nDr. Krain:\n Actually, I may be able to help with that. Let me call in a few favors.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4721-3:\n On June 21st, 2019, after a two-week long deliberation, the O5 Council voted 6-6-1 on the issue of releasing SCP-4721. As a result of this deadlock, the decision advanced to the Ethics Committee, which unanimously passed the motion to fully amnesticize SCP-4721 and release and reintegrate him into society. This was motivated by the lack of additional anomalous properties of SCP-4721 besides his anachronistic nature, and the mental distress brought upon him through containment.\n\n\nUpon the completion of the procedure, SCP-4721 is to be reclassified as neutralized. To ensure no anomalies develop as a result of the operation, Euclid shall be monitored at all times for the rest of his natural life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4720\n | SCP-4721 | \nSCP-4722\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4721\n\" by GrimmCreeper, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
