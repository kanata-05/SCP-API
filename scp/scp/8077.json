The containment chamber has been modified to the extent that once every hour, a specialized aerosol will be released into the containment chamber that severely inhibits the production of saliva within the mouth when inhaled. Due to a hypothesized post-traumatic unresponsiveness toward Foundation questioning, beginning shortly, SCP-8077 will be visited by a Foundation-sanctioned psychiatrist for regular sessions. While the chosen psychiatrist will be permitted to wear a provided mask or face covering during their sessions, SCP-8077 is to remain exposed to the specialized aerosol at all times.\n\n\nShould future testing and / or psychiatric-related sessions necessitate SCP-8077 to be removed from its containment chamber, a mask constructed from an enhanced, corrosion-resistant material will be provided to cover the lower portion of its face. In addition to this, multiple industrial canisters of the specialized aerosol are to be delivered to the location outside of its containment chamber prior to its arrival to be utilized by assigned personnel at any sign of a potential containment breach\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8077 is a 16-year-old Caucasian female of European descent possessing the anomalous mutation of producing saliva that displays extremely caustic properties. While SCP-8077\u2019s organs and tissue are immune to the corrosive effects of its saliva, it has been observed to drastically affect most other materials (organic and inorganic) that it has come into contact with, resulting in the rapid corrosion and decomposition of said material. Most notably, the saliva has displayed a fatal efficiency toward eating away at all forms of organic (specifically human) organs and tissue.\n\n\nUpon SCP-8077\u2019s discovery by Foundation personnel, it was transported to Site-81-5 from its original home of \nSalvation\n, Indiana.\n\n\nAddendum - 8077.1:\n Supplementary Information\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nAs SCP-8077 was in the process of being uncovered, six agents of MTF Epsilon-6 (\u201cVillage Idiots\u201d) were deployed into Salvation to accomplish two different assignments. Three of the agents were tasked with conducting rudimentary interviews with specific townspeople to gain additional information regarding SCP-8077 and what exactly had transpired on the night of its discovery. The same three were also to be responsible for the town\u2019s amnesticization following their investigation. The additional three agents were tasked with locating a person of interest who was believed to be SCP-8077.\n\n\n\n\nMTF Epsilon-6 (\u201cVillage Idiots\u201d):\n Town-Side Team\n\n\nTeam Members:\n E6-02 (Beta), E6-03 (Gamma)\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n E6-01 (Alpha)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8077\u2019s name is Florence Ignis. It was born in October 2008, in Salvation, Indiana, where it resided until it was taken into Foundation custody. Its anomalous mutation is congenital, though neither of its parents tested positive for similar (or otherwise) anomalous properties. The anomalous mutation appeared to have developed gradually, over time, from approximately the ages of three to 13. Since that point, the lethality of its anomalous mutation gradually ceased increasing.\n\n\nSCP-8077\u2019s parents, Joseph and Marilyn Ignis, refused to outright confirm whether or not they had known about their daughter\u2019s anomalous mutation. However, the presence of significantly charred eating utensils made from a Polytetrafluoroethylene (colloquially known as \nTeflon\n) based compound found within their home suggests that its parents were aware of its anomalous mutation, modifying their home accordingly to accommodate their daughter.\n\n\nWhen interviewed by the Town-Side Team under the guise of gathering research for an article on declining religious affiliations in Indiana, Trent Linklater, a teacher at Salvation High School, corroborated similar accounts that during its attendance at the school, SCP-8077 was quiet, reserved, and lacked social connections to its peers and the school\u2019s faculty.\n\n\n\n\nLinklater:\n You know, now that you\u2019ve got me thinking about it again, I did notice something strange back when she\u2019d (SCP-8077) been a student in my homeroom class. I must\u2019ve forgotten about it just as quickly as I\u2019d realized it. She never ate or drank anything while in school. I remember it was a student\u2019s birthday, he\u2019d brought in a platter of cupcakes that his mother had baked to share during homeroom. Everyone in the class had gotten one, the mother had baked one for every student, you see, until he arrived at her desk. She politely declined but\u2026 it was the look in her eyes, despite the tone of her voice, that struck me. She looked\u2026 afraid? Nervous. As if the pastry were about to leap from the tray and devour her instead of the other way around! I think the birthday boy ate the leftover cupcake himself, I can\u2019t quite remember. But since that moment\u2026 I began watching a bit more closely. Nothing. She never ate or drank a thing. Not in the cafeteria, not between classes, never. A strange quirk for a strange girl, no? I just hope that it wasn\u2019t a sign of some kind, a warning of things to come. One in such a position as mine can\u2019t help but feel somewhat responsible for what\u2019s happened\u2026 oh well. What\u2019s done is done. Something to add to the confessional, I guess, right?\n\n\n\n\nWhen interviewed by the Town-Side Team, Roger Beltide, a volunteer chaplain at Salvation High School, told the agents that he\u2019d believed that SCP-8077 had begun to improve after meeting 18-year-old Morgan Finlay (POI-8077-01) during its Sophomore year. According to Beltide and similar accounts from others close to Finlay, she quickly became extremely interested in SCP-8077, the two forming an intense friendship just several months preceding Finlay\u2019s graduation.\n\n\n\n\nBeltide:\n The truth is, we simply don\u2019t have all of the facts about what happened. But if what people are saying turns out to be true, then our belief must dictate that this wasn\u2019t some awful accident, crime, or mistake to have occurred. But that it was an act of divine retribution, no? Jot this down for your little puff piece or whatever it is you\u2019re doing. The Devil is a roaring lion\n1\n\u2026 and we are not to enter the thicket in search of the lion, for He is a hungry beast with an appetite for childish and naive temptations made manifest. The girl (POI-8077-01) was always of the curious sort\u2026 and if she went looking for trouble, we can\u2019t rightly pretend to act surprised that she found it, can we? I can only hope that the Lord deigned to bless her with an opportunity for repentance before it was all over\u2026 this I can only hope.\n\n\n\n\nWhen interviewed by the Town-Side Team, 18-year-old Roman Shelby, Finlay\u2019s partner at the time, told the agents that he\u2019d been embarrassed and perturbed by her friendship with SCP-8077. When asked to elaborate and for more specific details regarding their sudden relationship, Shelby admitted that he hadn\u2019t known much, only that, oddly, their preferred mode of communication involved the passing of handwritten notes back and forth, despite each having the other\u2019s phone number saved in their respective contact lists. According to Shelby, he would often (and aggressively) attempt to pressure SCP-8077 into divulging the contents of these notes against Finlay\u2019s wishes, however, it would refuse each of his marked threats.\n\n\n\n\nShelby:\n One day, I didn\u2019t even know she (SCP-8077) existed. The next, I can\u2019t seem to get away from her for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Look. I get that Mo\u2019s (POI-8077-01) allowed to have her own friends and all but you\u2019ve gotta admit, it got out of hand. I mean, she\u2019s my girlfriend, first and foremost\u2026 or was, I guess. Weird. That\u2019ll take some getting used to. But some of my best memories in this town were of running off the football field and into her arms after games. Playing hooky to kiss under the bleachers, you know? We were teens in love, man, what else is there to say? But after they\u2019d met, every time I hugged her, I was forced to stare at that fucking gimp over her shoulder, following her around like a lost puppy. Football games, parties\u2026 church! I couldn\u2019t even pray to God without the cunt within five feet of me! Maybe Mo just had a thing for broken dolls whose heads you could twist on backward, who fucking knows. All I know is this. I\u2019m never getting that image out of my head. Never. If they don\u2019t find that demon soon, I know of a couple of boys who\u2019d be itching for a chance at a proper witch-hunt. The books all tell you that your best weapons are holy water and the strength of your own faith. Well, my faith is strong. And they don\u2019t say anything about bullets but I\u2019ll take my chances.\n\n\n\n\nWhen interviewed by the Town-Side Team, Finlay\u2019s mother provided a brief account of her feelings toward her daughter\u2019s relationship with SCP-8077.\n\n\n\n\nJulia Finlay:\n Our girl (POI-8077-01) gave everything she had for that deviant pariah. What spark of divinity she saw in the little beast, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But I do know this. Pests fly into fires because of the glamour it casts upon their primitive minds. Morgan\u2019s light must\u2019ve seemed a mighty glamorous flame reflected in that beast\u2019s black eyes.\n\n\n\n\nNotably, out of everyone that the Town-Side Team had interviewed, Shelby appeared far more angry at the prospect of SCP-8077 not being found than he was distraught at Finlay\u2019s sudden death. Aside from the general apathy that most townspeople displayed toward the death of the young woman, most (aside from a select few) also seemed to share in Shelby\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 8077.2:\n Incident Report\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nOn the night of June 15th, 2024, Shelby, Finlay, and SCP-8077 had all been in attendance at an unsupervised party thrown by a classmate while his parents were out of town on a work-related excursion. The party was thrown within the classmate\u2019s home, the home\u2019s security system (including most of the security cameras) had been deactivated at the time, and alcohol had been present within the home that night despite later claims from certain individuals that it had been a \u201cdry and drug-free\u201d event. The only security camera that hadn\u2019t been deactivated at the time was a tree-mounted security camera that the classmate was unaware of and displayed a view of the home\u2019s front door. Multiple eyewitness accounts corroborate the reality that Shelby and Finlay in particular had both been exceedingly inebriated while SCP-8077, on multiple occasions, outright refused to partake in any offered substances.\n\n\nThe following Incident Report represents the Foundation\u2019s most cogent interpretation of the night\u2019s events, gathered from the extensive interviewing and cross-referencing of all persons involved by Epsilon-6\u2019s Town-Side Team.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 06 / 15 / 2024 - 06 / 16 / 2024\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(11:30 p.m.):\n The footage from the tree-mounted security camera shows Shelby, Finlay, and SCP-8077 arriving at their classmate\u2019s home. Shelby is carrying a cardboard six-pack of beer but only two drinks are being held. Finlay is holding a half-empty bottle of red wine in one hand and one of SCP-8077\u2019s hands in her other. The front door is unlocked, Shelby opens it, and the three enter.\n\n\n(12:25 a.m.):\n Two of Shelby\u2019s classmates see Finlay and SCP-8077 entering a bathroom on the home\u2019s second floor. According to these sources, Finlay was extremely intoxicated and had pulled SCP-8077 into the bathroom with her, closing the door behind them. One of the classmates informs a friend of Finlay\u2019s about what he\u2019s seen.\n\n\n(12:50 a.m.):\n The footage from the tree-mounted security camera shows SCP-8077 exiting the classmate\u2019s home. While it remains largely silent, it is crying profusely. Its entire body is trembling. It appears to be acting in an erratic, paranoid state, constantly looking around itself as it vacates the property heading north. An unknown substance (presumably vomit matter) is caked onto both of its hands.\n\n\n(1:00 a.m.):\n Shelby claims to have noticed Finlay and SCP-8077\u2019s absence at this time. Finlay\u2019s friend informs Shelby about what she\u2019d been told by one of his classmates.\n\n\n(1:10 a.m.):\n Shelby goes to the second floor bathroom to investigate for himself. The door is closed but unlocked. He opens the door and finds Finlay\u2019s body lying on the tile floor. Her head is sat in a pool of its own blood and there are two massive wounds to her mandible and chest respectively.\n\n\nA splash of dark red on the bathroom counter\u2019s edge suggests that she\u2019d cracked her skull as she fell.\n\n\nHer mandible had almost completely dissolved, leaving a cavity of gored and rotted flesh in its place. The corroded skin separating the injury from the remainder of her lifeless face was discolored a dark green, almost black. Nearly all of her tongue had dissolved alongside her mandible but what little remained toward the back of her throat had blackened and shriveled. Strangely, the positions of her maxilla (upper jaw) and what little remained of her mandible suggests that as she died, she was smiling.\n\n\nThe wound to her chest displayed a similar caustic origin to that of her mandible. The entirety of her torso was either partially or completely dissolved, skin sloughing from bone and pooling into small mounds of flesh on either side of her body. Her rib cage had been exposed and her sternum was dripping liquified bone and marrow into the slurry of dissolved organs and skin contained within her chest cavity.\n\n\nLater forensic evidence would reveal several characteristics regarding her sustained injuries. First, the wound to her mandible must have occurred slightly before the wound to her chest. Second, vomit matter was detected within and around the wound to her chest.\n\n\n(1:15 a.m.):\n The local police station of Salvation is called to the classmate\u2019s home. The partygoers quickly vacate the property leaving Shelby and the classmate who\u2019d thrown the party to meet with the police as they arrive.\n\n\n(1:45 a.m.):\n The classmate\u2019s home is completely cordoned off as police begin their investigation of the crime scene. Simultaneously, a Foundation AIC (Artificially Intelligent Conscript) notifies the personnel of Site-81-5 regarding social media posts that have been made in reference to Finlay\u2019s death and SCP-8077. As the AIC begins its cleanup protocol, erasing any and all posts or comments referencing the incident before they can begin to spread, the three agents of Epsilon-6 that would later become the Town-Side Team are sent to the home to take control of the situation.\n\n\n(2:00 a.m.):\n Both Shelby and the classmate who\u2019d thrown the party are driven back to Shelby\u2019s home by an officer and dropped off before the officer returns to the crime scene.\n\n\n(2:30 a.m.):\n Posing as members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the three agents secure the cordoned crime scene and begin a rudimentary forensic analysis of Finlay\u2019s body (see above). The three agents hold their positions within the classmate\u2019s home until additional Foundation support could arrive to relieve them. The AIC successfully quells the spread of information pertaining to Finlay\u2019s death and SCP-8077 from across various social media platforms.\n\n\n(3:00 a.m.):\n Finlay\u2019s body is collected by Foundation personnel and transported back to Site-81-5 to be placed within its cold storage facility for further analysis and potential testing purposes.\n\n\n(5:00 a.m.):\n Epsilon-6 is split into the Town-Side and Retrieval Teams and given their assignments by Researcher Riley Aimes.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 8077.3:\n Recovery Log\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Finlay\u2019s death, the three agents of Epsilon-6 tasked with locating SCP-8077 consulted all available cameras active on the night of the 15th (traffic, storefront, home security, etc\u2026) and determined the path that it must have taken from its classmate\u2019s home out of Salvation. The Retrieval Team located SCP-8077 the next day, as they had tracked its path through a forest outside of the town\u2019s limits. Prior to engaging, the Retrieval Team observed it for several hours as it walked through the forest. It was during this period of observation that SCP-8077\u2019s anomalous mutation was first witnessed and confirmed by the Retrieval Team as it attempted (and failed) to cook a raw fish that it had caught from a nearby river by coating its carcass in its saliva. The transcript of the Retrieval Team\u2019s eventual encounter with SCP-8077 is provided below.\n\n\n\n\nMTF Epsilon-6 (\u201cVillage Idiots\u201d):\n Retrieval Team\n\n\nTeam Members:\n E6-04 (Chi), E6-05 (Psi)\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n E6-06 (Omega)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 06 / 16 / 2024\n\n\nOverwatch:\n Researcher Riley Aimes\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8077\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe Retrieval Team is crouched behind a small rock face approximately 75 yards from SCP-8077. SCP-8077 is sitting in front of an extinguished fire pit in a makeshift camp, picking meat from the bones of a half-corroded fish carcass. Omega turns his back to the rock face and presses the comm. built into his helmet.\n\n\nOmega:\n Overwatch. We\u2019ve got eyes on the girl.\n\n\nAimes:\n And?\n\n\nOmega:\n It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been looking for. It\u2019s anomalous, it produces some kind of acidic saliva, or vomit, and its effects appear to match our POI\u2019s cause of death.\n\n\nAimes:\n What else?\n\n\nOmega:\n It\u2019s alone. We\u2019re in a forest northwest of Salvation, four, maybe five klicks deep.\n\n\nAimes:\n No worries, we\u2019ve got your locations.\n\n\nThe comm. goes silent for a moment before Aimes continues.\n\n\nAimes:\n Alright then. You\u2019ve got a green-light, Retrieval Team. Bring it in.\n\n\nOmega:\n Ma\u2019am.\n\n\nOmega nods and presses the comm. a second time, switching it off. He turns toward Chi and Psi.\n\n\nOmega:\n We\u2019re good to go. Masks up.\n\n\nThe Retrieval Team each slide on a tactical gas mask clipped to their belt.\n\n\nOmega:\n With me.\n\n\nOmega peeks out from behind the rock face, pauses for a moment, then starts walking, closing the distance between them and SCP-8077. Chi and Psi follow close behind. When the Retrieval Team is approximately 25 yards from SCP-8077, Omega raises a hand, and Chi and Psi stop. With two fingers extended, he gestures toward SCP-8077. With his index finger extended, he makes a circular motion. He slowly counts down from five on the fingers of one hand and clenches his fist. Chi and Psi nod and silently break off from him in opposite directions, beginning to circle around SCP-8077 from either side.\n\n\nApproximately two minutes pass as the Retrieval Team secures their positions. Omega and Chi stand behind two trees while Psi is crouched down in a patch of wild shrubbery. Omega peeks out from behind his tree and receives a silent wave from Chi. Five seconds pass. The Retrieval Team duck out from their positions and begin their approach from all sides of SCP-8077.\n\n\nSCP-8077 looks up and drops the fish carcass. Omega is in front of it while Chi and Psi hold diagonal angles behind it. Its body doesn\u2019t move but its eyes dart rapidly.\n\n\nOmega:\n Florence Ignis. Surrender peacefully and you won\u2019t be harmed.\n\n\nSCP-8077 remains still for a moment longer before standing and attempting to run between Omega and Chi.\n\n\nOmega:\n Chi.\n\n\nChi intercepts SCP-8077 before it can split the gap. She grabs it and holds it in place from behind with an arm around its throat. Psi rushes toward them, turning the valve attached to a steel canister of nitrous oxide horizontally fastened against the small of his back. He readies an oxygen mask connected to the canister with a hose, pressing it against SCP-8077\u2019s face. It quickly inhales, thrashing its body and legs wildly in an attempt to free itself from Chi\u2019s grasp, then spits onto the inside of the oxygen mask. The plastic immediately begins to dissolve where the saliva made contact with it. Psi rips the oxygen mask from SCP-8077\u2019s face and throws it away.\n\n\nPsi:\n Omega!\n\n\nThe tarnished oxygen mask lands at Omega\u2019s feet and he immediately stamps it into the ground. The corrosion slows. He stamps it again. The corrosion ceases. Psi retrieves a nozzle holstered to his hip and connects it to the hose.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n Wait!\n\n\nPsi levels the nozzle at SCP-8077\u2019s face and pulls the trigger.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n Wait, wait, wait\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8077\u2019s thrashing quickly slows as the nitrous oxide begins to take effect. Chi releases it and it stumbles between the Retrieval Team, slowly swaying from side to side.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n S-She kissed me, I\u2026 I swear\u2026 she kissed me, she kissed me\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8077 falls to its knees, clasping its trembling hands in front of its chest as it tilts its head upward, staring into the sky. Its voice is hushed and it is speaking rapidly. The Retrieval Team stands around it and watches.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n O-Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be t-thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will b-be done; on earth as it is\u2026 as it is in h-heaven\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8077 appears to clear its throat once, twice, before spiraling into a fit of strangled coughing. It covers its mouth with its hands as it begins to vomit, however, nothing emerges but saliva. The saliva dripping down from its chin and between its fingers immediately begins melting through the dirt and dead leaves beneath it but does not affect its hands. SCP-8077 raises its trembling, saliva-coated hands in front of its face, looking from them to the melting ground beneath it and back.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n Why is my heart burning\u2026 why is there fire in my veins\u2026\n\n\nSCP-8077\u2019s voice has lowered to a hoarse whisper. It drops its hands to the ground, its fingers digging into the decaying earth. It looks up at Omega, its expression one of abject horror, and it begins to cry.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n \u2026why is my heart burning?\n\n\nSCP-8077\u2019s eyelids begin to twitch before its eyes completely close, it collapses onto its stomach, then goes silent. Psi disconnects the nozzle, slides it back into its holster, and turns the valve attached to the canister. Omega reaches down, picks up the destroyed oxygen mask, and stuffs it into a pouch clipped to his belt. He peels off his tactical gas mask and returns it to his belt as well. Chi and Psi follow suit. He presses the comm. on the side of his helmet.\n\n\nOmega:\n Overwatch. We\u2019ve secured the anomaly without issue. Heading to the extraction point now.\n\n\nA moment passes before Aimes responds.\n\n\nAimes:\n Excellent work, Epsilon-6. We\u2019ll meet you town-side shortly.\n\n\nOmega:\n Ma\u2019am.\n\n\nOmega nods and presses the comm. a second time, switching it off. Psi gently lifts SCP-8077 from the ground, hooking one arm beneath its knees and wrapping the other around its shoulders.\n\n\nPsi:\n What should we do about its anomalous property?\n\n\nChi:\n Pray it doesn\u2019t wake up and that the Extraction Team will have something figured out by the time they arrive.\n\n\nOmega nods in agreement.\n\n\nOmega:\n That\u2019s not our department, kid. Let\u2019s get going.\n\n\nThe Retrieval Team starts off toward the extraction point with SCP-8077.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 1:30 p.m. on the day of retrieval, the Retrieval Team arrived at the chosen extraction point with SCP-8077. It was still unconscious from the initial dosage of nitrous oxide given to it by the Retrieval Team. While unconscious, the Extraction Team fastened an oxygen mask to its face, connected with a hose to a steel canister of the specialized aerosol that would later be utilized in its containment chamber. Researcher Aimes, who\u2019d accompanied the Extraction Team to Salvation, ordered the Retrieval Team to remain on standby within the town\u2019s limits until the Town-Side Team had finished their investigation and amnesticization of the townspeople. While the Retrieval Team assumed their new position, SCP-8077 was loaded into a Foundation vehicle, along with Researcher Aimes and the Extraction Team, and taken to Site-81-5.\n\n\nDuring the drive back to Site-81-5, SCP-8077 awoke from its induced sleep. Initially extremely panicked, it attempted to remove the oxygen mask fastened to its face but was unable to, as it had been restrained within the vehicle. Eventually, following multiple assurances of its (and its family\u2019s) safety, Researcher Aimes succeeded in calming it, though it continued to attempt to free itself from its restraints throughout the drive back to Site-81-5. As it had begun to calm down, Researcher Aimes asked it what had happened between it and Finlay on the night of her death.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n You heard them. I deserve this. The Devil poured hellfire down my throat because He knew what I was, what I could do for Him. I am red-hot temptation served cold on a silver platter. It\u2019s her fault she fell for me. It\u2019s her fault she\u2019s dead.\n\n\nSCP-8077 begins to sob.\n\n\nSCP-8077:\n Why\u2026 God, why? I didn\u2019t ask for this to happen\u2026 it\u2019s just what I am. Don\u2019t you understand? Don\u2019t you understand?\n\n\nAimes sits in silence for a moment. And another moment passes. She sighs.\n\n\nAimes:\n \u2026the heart wants what it wants, Florence. You can't choose who you love. It's love that chooses us.\n\n\nSCP-8077 stares at Aimes, drops its chin back to its chest, and continues to sob.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this brief exchange, SCP-8077 has yet to speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum - 8077.4:\n Artifact Recovery\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the retrieval of SCP-8077 by the Retrieval Team, the Town-Side Team began the process of administering Class C amnestics to the inhabitants of Salvation. Following their amnesticization, they were fed the devised masquerade that several months prior, Morgan Finlay had committed suicide by drowning herself in a large river southwest of the town. Her body was never recovered. Last week, Florence Ignis had also commit suicide at the tail end of an enduring depressive episode stemming from Finlay\u2019s death. Joseph and Marilyn Ignis chose to have their daughter\u2019s body cremated and the ashes spread in the river where Finlay had been seen last.\n\n\nBefore leaving Salvation with the Retrieval Team, the Town-Side Team conducted a final interview with Joseph and Marilyn Ignis within their home. The transcript of their interview is provided below.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log Transcript\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Joseph and Marilyn Ignis\n\n\nInterviewer(s):\n E6-01 (Alpha), E6-02 (Beta), E6-03 (Gamma)\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nThe Town-Side Team sits around a small table in the connected kitchen-dining room of the home. Alpha sits at one head of the table with Beta and Gamma on either side of him. A black duffle bag sits against the legs of Beta\u2019s chair. Marilyn sits at the other head of the table, constantly moving her hands from her lap to the table and back. Joseph walks from the kitchen to the table, an ornate teacup in his callused hands, and sits next to Marilyn. He slides the teacup in front of her, smiling.\n\n\nJoseph:\n \n(whispering)\n \u2026careful. It\u2019s hot.\n\n\nMarilyn taps the teacup with her fingers several times before slowly picking it up. She smiles.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n \n(whispering)\n \u2026thank you.\n\n\nShe takes a sip of the teacup\u2019s contents. Joseph turns toward the Town-Side Team.\n\n\nJoseph:\n Are you sure I can\u2019t get you folks anything? Some water, maybe coffee?\n\n\nAlpha shakes his head.\n\n\nAlpha:\n No, thank you, Mr. Ignis. We don\u2019t plan on staying long, you see.\n\n\nJoseph shrugs.\n\n\nJoseph:\n Suit yourself. You said that you were here about Florence, didn\u2019t you? How can we help?\n\n\nAlpha:\n If it\u2019s alright with the both of you, we\u2019ve got some questions that we\u2019d have you answer for us.\n\n\nMarilyn takes another sip from her teacup.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n She should be home from\u2026 f-from school any minute now. Wouldn\u2019t you rather wait until then? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions!\n\n\nHer eyes appear to unfocus for a moment before returning to the Town-Side Team. Joseph doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Alpha glances at Beta out of the corner of his eye and she nods.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \u2026that\u2019s alright, Mrs. Ignis. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll have all the answers we need.\n\n\nMarilyn smiles.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n Alright then, if you\u2019re sure.\n\n\nAlpha returns her smiles with one of his own.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Great. Was your daughter acting different or unusual in any way throughout the days leading up to Morgan Finlay\u2019s death?\n\n\nMarilyn sighs and looks down into her teacup.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n The poor thing\u2026 it was such a shock for everyone. A girl as beautiful and bright as Morgan doesn\u2019t deserve to have her life snuffed out at such a young age. And her parents, God, I can\u2019t even imagine. The pain of losing your child, it\u2019s\u2026 it must be indescribable. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I didn\u2019t have Florence to dote on.\n\n\nMarilyn smiles and Joseph takes one of her hands into his own.\n\n\nJoseph:\n Morgan\u2019s death\u2026 you\u2019ve gotta understand, it hit Florence pretty hard. Florence never had many friends growing up. Maybe that\u2019s partially our fault, we kept her a bit sheltered, you see. But Morgan\u2026 a gift from God, I imagine. She really took a liking to Florence, took her under her wing.\n\n\nJoseph laughs softly to himself.\n\n\nJoseph:\n \u2026we used to joke that the two were joined at the hip. After they\u2019d met, it felt like we\u2019d never see Florence without her somewhere nearby, like the only exception was when we\u2019d tuck her in at night! They spent a lot of time here. Sometimes they\u2019d go back to Morgan\u2019s house but\u2026 well, mostly they\u2019d be here.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \u2026and before Morgan\u2019s death?\n\n\nJoseph:\n Right, right\u2026\n\n\nJoseph raises his free hand and rubs one of his temples.\n\n\nJoseph:\n \u2026sorry about that. Florence was\u2026 she\u2026\n\n\nMarilyn speaks up.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n \n(fondly)\n \u2026in all honesty, she was the same brand of strange that she\u2019d always been.\n\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n Although, if I had to pick out something stranger than usual from before Morgan\u2019s death, there was one thing. It was this\u2026 note, or paper, that she\u2019d been reading obsessively, over and over again. I swear, any time I\u2019d find her in her room, she\u2019d be reading it, the same one! Isn\u2019t that right, Joey?\n\n\nMarilyn squeezes Joseph\u2019s hand and he smiles wearily.\n\n\nJoseph:\n Yes, yes\u2026 I do remember that.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n I thought that maybe it was a report card for her classes or something. I was just happy that she\u2019d finally begun to take her studies more seriously, another effect that Morgan had had on her. But she\u2019d never let anyone read it.\n\n\nMarilyn sighs.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n After Morgan\u2019s death, I\u2026\n\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n \u2026you know what? I can grab it for you.\n\n\nGamma:\n Are you sure? We\u2019d hate to invade your privacy any more than we already have.\n\n\nMarilyn smiles.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n You\u2019re kind. But if you\u2019re writing about Morgan, I\u2019m sure Florence would be alright with you reading it. I\u2019ll be right back.\n\n\nMarilyn stands and walks from the table, presumably upstairs to SCP-8077\u2019s bedroom. A moment passes in silence. Then another. Joseph clears his throat.\n\n\nJoseph:\n So\u2026 you said this was for a newspaper article?\n\n\nAlpha nods.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Yes.\n\n\nJoseph:\n What paper? I\u2019ll have to keep an eye out!\n\n\nAlpha pauses for a moment before responding.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \u2026we\u2019ll send you a copy.\n\n\nJoseph:\n Ah\u2026 okay.\n\n\nMarilyn returns, sitting down at the table. She holds up what appears to be a folded piece of paper in her hand.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n Well, here it is.\n\n\nStrangely, certain edges of the folded piece of paper appear to be slightly charred.\n\n\nAlpha:\n You were saying that you\u2019d found out what it was?\n\n\nMarilyn shakes her head.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n No, I\u2026 I could never bring myself to read it. Not when it seemed so important to Florence, it just wouldn\u2019t feel right. But I know what it might be.\n\n\nAlpha:\n What\u2019s that?\n\n\nMarilyn:\n A few months ago, Florence had started burning papers in a small fire pit that we have in our backyard.\n\n\nShe turns in her chair and points toward a window that looks out upon the property behind their home.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n When we asked what she was burning, she told us that they were just little notes that she\u2019d written to herself. Things to remember, to do, to keep track of\u2026 stuff like that.\n\n\nMarilyn laughs softly to herself.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n Just one of her little idiosyncrasies. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that this is one she decided to keep around for some reason. It looks like she started to burn it\u2026\n\n\nShe gestures to the folded piece of paper\u2019s charred edges.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n \u2026but never finished the job for some reason.\n\n\nThe Town-Side Team stares in silence for a moment before she continues.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all we know about it. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t have been of more use to you but like I said earlier, if you\u2019re happy to wait a little while longer, I\u2019m sure Florence would be happy to answer your questions herself!\n\n\nAlpha:\n That\u2019s quite alright, Mrs. Ignis. You\u2019ve been plenty helpful.\n\n\nMarilyn sighs.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n In any case, you\u2019d better take this with you. I know you\u2019ll do right by our girls.\n\n\nMarilyn holds out the folded piece of paper and Alpha takes it from her, placing it into his back pocket.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Thank you both. You\u2019ve truly helped us more than you know.\n\n\nJoseph smiles.\n\n\nJoseph:\n If we don\u2019t help our neighbors, who will?\n\n\nBeta peeks down at a watch on her wrist and turns to Alpha.\n\n\nBeta:\n It\u2019s time.\n\n\nAlpha nods.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Alright then. Masks up.\n\n\nBeta reaches down to the black duffle bag sitting against her chair and unzips it. Inside are three tactical gas masks. She passes the first to Alpha, who hands it to Gamma, passes the second to Alpha, and keeps the third for herself. The Town-Side Team each slide on their gas mask. Joseph and Marilyn watch them curiously but seem strangely unconcerned by their actions. The Town-Side Team stands. Joseph and Marilyn\u2019s eyes seem to unfocus, their eyelids growing heavy.\n\n\nAlpha:\n We\u2019ll be taking our leave now. We\u2019re terribly sorry for your loss, Mr. and Mrs. Ignis. Florence was an amazing girl. She\u2019ll be missed dearly.\n\n\nMarilyn grabs at the sides of her head for a moment, groaning, her eyes squeezed shut. She slowly opens her eyes. Her voice is soft, barely above a whisper.\n\n\nMarilyn:\n Our\u2026 loss? Right, right\u2026 yes, thank you, God bless her, God bless them both. May they both rest in peace\u2026 finally.\n\n\nJoseph looks up at the Town-Side Team, his head swaying gently from side to side.\n\n\nJoseph:\n \u2026can I g-g-get you fellas anything? Water? Maybe\u2026 iced t-tea?\n\n\nAlpha:\n We really must be going, Mr. Ignis. Thank you.\n\n\nJoseph and Marilyn slowly rest their heads atop the table and fall silent. Alpha retrieves a small radio from his pocket and holds it up to the front of his gas mask, pressing down its push-to-talk button.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Overwatch. The amnesticization has been taken care of. We\u2019re heading to rendezvous with the Retrieval Team, then we\u2019ll head to the extraction point and prepare for a lift back to 81-5. Over and out.\n\n\nAlpha releases the push-to-talk button and slides the radio back into his pocket. He nods toward the front door.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Come on, let\u2019s get going. It\u2019s getting stuffy in here.\n\n\nAlpha walks to the front door and steps out. Beta and Gamma follow close behind and Gamma closes the door behind them.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nThe folded piece of paper retrieved by the Town-Side Team was Finlay\u2019s last known message to SCP-8077. It reads as follows.\n\n\n\n\nHey, Flo!\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow was your day? I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t be there to ask you in person, Roman\u2019s dragging me to his football game after school today. I wish you were going, too, but I guess you\u2019ve built up a resistance to my peer pressuring by now haha. By the way, they had ice cream sandwiches in the cafeteria today, the ones with giant cookies for buns! I know you don\u2019t like to eat in front of other people so I grabbed one for you and put it in your locker! Wait, shit, I put an ICE CREAM sandwich in your locker\u2026 how am I just realizing how much of a bad idea that was as I\u2019m writing this? Okay, let me know if there\u2019s melted ice cream all over your locker after school, and I\u2019ll clean it up! (It\u2019s the thought that counts, right?)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou\u2019re going to Jameson\u2019s party on Saturday, right? Who am I kidding, of course you are! Maybe I\u2019ll even get you to do a shot with me. But don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t go too crazy, I\u2019ll spare you the trouble of having to take care of me at the end of the night (even though I think you\u2019re really good at it). And then I was thinking, after the service on Sunday, maybe we\u2019d go back to your place for a bit? If we can\u2019t, that\u2019s totally cool, just let me know. I know we see each other almost everyday but I really want to see you. Oh well. I guess it can wait until Saturday. Roman and I will pick you up like usual, yeah? Can\u2019t wait!\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCan I tell you something? With graduation in a few days, I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of things. I\u2019m about to get all mushy by the way so\u2026 consider yourself warned. Anyway. Roman and I aren\u2019t going to make it doing the whole \u201clong distance\u201d thing. He doesn\u2019t know that yet but I do. I've tried to make myself feel guilty about how easy of a decision that was for me to make but I just can't. I don\u2019t care about him enough. I know that sounds harsh but you\u2019re the only one that I can talk to and I hope you know where I\u2019m coming from. You also know that I\u2019m going to school in Connecticut. That\u2019s not too far from Salvation! I\u2019ll make sure to visit whenever I get the chance. If I see Roman while I\u2019m back, I\u2019ll tell him that I\u2019ve missed him, but I\u2019m only coming back for you. And my parents, I guess. AND MY DOG!\n\n\n\n\nThe note continues on the other side of the folded piece of paper.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2026you know something funny? I keep thinking about this. We only met because you bumped into me in the hallway. At least you\u2019ve started to look up while you\u2019re walking since then. But I\u2019m really happy that you didn\u2019t back then\u2026 hey, Flo? I know it\u2019s only been, like, half a year since we met but I feel like I\u2019ve known you my entire life. Like I\u2019m going to know you for my entire future, too, if that makes any sense. I don\u2019t want to leave you. But I need to leave this place. It\u2019s suffocating me, I can feel it. I think it\u2019s suffocating you, too. I feel so torn. I know that I\u2019m leaving soon but a part of me can\u2019t follow if you\u2019re not leaving with me. I want to see you so bad. I need to see you. When you leave, too, will you find me? Promise me that you\u2019ll find me, Florence. I\u2019ll make you promise on Saturday but for now, just writing it down is making me feel a bit better, so it\u2019ll have to do.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI know it\u2019s only two years, and maybe this is silly in the grand scheme of things, but I need you to know that I\u2019m going to wait for you. I don\u2019t care how long it takes. I\u2019ll wait fucking forever. I won\u2019t forget about you, Spitfire. I promise. Don\u2019t go forgetting about me.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nyour M. Always.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScattered across the front of the note are spots where the folded paper has been faintly charred. These spots occur exclusively along the margin of the note, as if made purposefully so as not to cover any of the note\u2019s words. Upon closer inspection and rudimentary DNA sampling, however, the charred spots appear consistent with marks that would\u2019ve been made from a pair of lips. On the orders of Researcher Aimes, Finlay\u2019s note is to be returned to SCP-8077 within its containment chamber to do with as it pleases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-8076\n | SCP-8077 | \nSCP-8078\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Linklater: You know, now that you\u2019ve got me thinking about it again, I did notice something strange back when she\u2019d (SCP-8077) been a student in my homeroom class. I must\u2019ve forgotten about it just as quickly as I\u2019d realized it. She never ate or drank anything while in school. I remember it was a student\u2019s birthday, he\u2019d brought in a platter of cupcakes that his mother had baked to share during homeroom. Everyone in the class had gotten one, the mother had baked one for every student, you see, until he arrived at her desk. She politely declined but\u2026 it was the look in her eyes, despite the tone of her voice, that struck me. She looked\u2026 afraid? Nervous. As if the pastry were about to leap from the tray and devour her instead of the other way around! I think the birthday boy ate the leftover cupcake himself, I can\u2019t quite remember. But since that moment\u2026 I began watching a bit more closely. Nothing. She never ate or drank a thing. Not in the cafeteria, not between classes, never. A strange quirk for a strange girl, no? I just hope that it wasn\u2019t a sign of some kind, a warning of things to come. One in such a position as mine can\u2019t help but feel somewhat responsible for what\u2019s happened\u2026 oh well. What\u2019s done is done. Something to add to the confessional, I guess, right?",
        "Beltide: The truth is, we simply don\u2019t have all of the facts about what happened. But if what people are saying turns out to be true, then our belief must dictate that this wasn\u2019t some awful accident, crime, or mistake to have occurred. But that it was an act of divine retribution, no? Jot this down for your little puff piece or whatever it is you\u2019re doing. The Devil is a roaring lion 1 \u2026 and we are not to enter the thicket in search of the lion, for He is a hungry beast with an appetite for childish and naive temptations made manifest. The girl (POI-8077-01) was always of the curious sort\u2026 and if she went looking for trouble, we can\u2019t rightly pretend to act surprised that she found it, can we? I can only hope that the Lord deigned to bless her with an opportunity for repentance before it was all over\u2026 this I can only hope.",
        "Shelby: One day, I didn\u2019t even know she (SCP-8077) existed. The next, I can\u2019t seem to get away from her for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Look. I get that Mo\u2019s (POI-8077-01) allowed to have her own friends and all but you\u2019ve gotta admit, it got out of hand. I mean, she\u2019s my girlfriend, first and foremost\u2026 or was, I guess. Weird. That\u2019ll take some getting used to. But some of my best memories in this town were of running off the football field and into her arms after games. Playing hooky to kiss under the bleachers, you know? We were teens in love, man, what else is there to say? But after they\u2019d met, every time I hugged her, I was forced to stare at that fucking gimp over her shoulder, following her around like a lost puppy. Football games, parties\u2026 church! I couldn\u2019t even pray to God without the cunt within five feet of me! Maybe Mo just had a thing for broken dolls whose heads you could twist on backward, who fucking knows. All I know is this. I\u2019m never getting that image out of my head. Never. If they don\u2019t find that demon soon, I know of a couple of boys who\u2019d be itching for a chance at a proper witch-hunt. The books all tell you that your best weapons are holy water and the strength of your own faith. Well, my faith is strong. And they don\u2019t say anything about bullets but I\u2019ll take my chances.",
        "Julia Finlay: Our girl (POI-8077-01) gave everything she had for that deviant pariah. What spark of divinity she saw in the little beast, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But I do know this. Pests fly into fires because of the glamour it casts upon their primitive minds. Morgan\u2019s light must\u2019ve seemed a mighty glamorous flame reflected in that beast\u2019s black eyes.",
        "Incident Report DATE: 06 / 15 / 2024 - 06 / 16 / 2024 [BEGIN LOG] (11:30 p.m.): The footage from the tree-mounted security camera shows Shelby, Finlay, and SCP-8077 arriving at their classmate\u2019s home. Shelby is carrying a cardboard six-pack of beer but only two drinks are being held. Finlay is holding a half-empty bottle of red wine in one hand and one of SCP-8077\u2019s hands in her other. The front door is unlocked, Shelby opens it, and the three enter. (12:25 a.m.): Two of Shelby\u2019s classmates see Finlay and SCP-8077 entering a bathroom on the home\u2019s second floor. According to these sources, Finlay was extremely intoxicated and had pulled SCP-8077 into the bathroom with her, closing the door behind them. One of the classmates informs a friend of Finlay\u2019s about what he\u2019s seen. (12:50 a.m.): The footage from the tree-mounted security camera shows SCP-8077 exiting the classmate\u2019s home. While it remains largely silent, it is crying profusely. Its entire body is trembling. It appears to be acting in an erratic, paranoid state, constantly looking around itself as it vacates the property heading north. An unknown substance (presumably vomit matter) is caked onto both of its hands. (1:00 a.m.): Shelby claims to have noticed Finlay and SCP-8077\u2019s absence at this time. Finlay\u2019s friend informs Shelby about what she\u2019d been told by one of his classmates. (1:10 a.m.): Shelby goes to the second floor bathroom to investigate for himself. The door is closed but unlocked. He opens the door and finds Finlay\u2019s body lying on the tile floor. Her head is sat in a pool of its own blood and there are two massive wounds to her mandible and chest respectively. A splash of dark red on the bathroom counter\u2019s edge suggests that she\u2019d cracked her skull as she fell. Her mandible had almost completely dissolved, leaving a cavity of gored and rotted flesh in its place. The corroded skin separating the injury from the remainder of her lifeless face was discolored a dark green, almost black. Nearly all of her tongue had dissolved alongside her mandible but what little remained toward the back of her throat had blackened and shriveled. Strangely, the positions of her maxilla (upper jaw) and what little remained of her mandible suggests that as she died, she was smiling. The wound to her chest displayed a similar caustic origin to that of her mandible. The entirety of her torso was either partially or completely dissolved, skin sloughing from bone and pooling into small mounds of flesh on either side of her body. Her rib cage had been exposed and her sternum was dripping liquified bone and marrow into the slurry of dissolved organs and skin contained within her chest cavity. Later forensic evidence would reveal several characteristics regarding her sustained injuries. First, the wound to her mandible must have occurred slightly before the wound to her chest. Second, vomit matter was detected within and around the wound to her chest. (1:15 a.m.): The local police station of Salvation is called to the classmate\u2019s home. The partygoers quickly vacate the property leaving Shelby and the classmate who\u2019d thrown the party to meet with the police as they arrive. (1:45 a.m.): The classmate\u2019s home is completely cordoned off as police begin their investigation of the crime scene. Simultaneously, a Foundation AIC (Artificially Intelligent Conscript) notifies the personnel of Site-81-5 regarding social media posts that have been made in reference to Finlay\u2019s death and SCP-8077. As the AIC begins its cleanup protocol, erasing any and all posts or comments referencing the incident before they can begin to spread, the three agents of Epsilon-6 that would later become the Town-Side Team are sent to the home to take control of the situation. (2:00 a.m.): Both Shelby and the classmate who\u2019d thrown the party are driven back to Shelby\u2019s home by an officer and dropped off before the officer returns to the crime scene. (2:30 a.m.): Posing as members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the three agents secure the cordoned crime scene and begin a rudimentary forensic analysis of Finlay\u2019s body (see above). The three agents hold their positions within the classmate\u2019s home until additional Foundation support could arrive to relieve them. The AIC successfully quells the spread of information pertaining to Finlay\u2019s death and SCP-8077 from across various social media platforms. (3:00 a.m.): Finlay\u2019s body is collected by Foundation personnel and transported back to Site-81-5 to be placed within its cold storage facility for further analysis and potential testing purposes. (5:00 a.m.): Epsilon-6 is split into the Town-Side and Retrieval Teams and given their assignments by Researcher Riley Aimes. [END LOG]",

        "Recovery Log Transcript Date: 06 / 16 / 2024 Overwatch: Researcher Riley Aimes Subject: SCP-8077 [BEGIN LOG] The Retrieval Team is crouched behind a small rock face approximately 75 yards from SCP-8077. SCP-8077 is sitting in front of an extinguished fire pit in a makeshift camp, picking meat from the bones of a half-corroded fish carcass. Omega turns his back to the rock face and presses the comm. built into his helmet. Omega: Overwatch. We\u2019ve got eyes on the girl. Aimes: And? Omega: It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been looking for. It\u2019s anomalous, it produces some kind of acidic saliva, or vomit, and its effects appear to match our POI\u2019s cause of death. Aimes: What else? Omega: It\u2019s alone. We\u2019re in a forest northwest of Salvation, four, maybe five klicks deep. Aimes: No worries, we\u2019ve got your locations. The comm. goes silent for a moment before Aimes continues. Aimes: Alright then. You\u2019ve got a green-light, Retrieval Team. Bring it in. Omega: Ma\u2019am. Omega nods and presses the comm. a second time, switching it off. He turns toward Chi and Psi. Omega: We\u2019re good to go. Masks up. The Retrieval Team each slide on a tactical gas mask clipped to their belt. Omega: With me. Omega peeks out from behind the rock face, pauses for a moment, then starts walking, closing the distance between them and SCP-8077. Chi and Psi follow close behind. When the Retrieval Team is approximately 25 yards from SCP-8077, Omega raises a hand, and Chi and Psi stop. With two fingers extended, he gestures toward SCP-8077. With his index finger extended, he makes a circular motion. He slowly counts down from five on the fingers of one hand and clenches his fist. Chi and Psi nod and silently break off from him in opposite directions, beginning to circle around SCP-8077 from either side. Approximately two minutes pass as the Retrieval Team secures their positions. Omega and Chi stand behind two trees while Psi is crouched down in a patch of wild shrubbery. Omega peeks out from behind his tree and receives a silent wave from Chi. Five seconds pass. The Retrieval Team duck out from their positions and begin their approach from all sides of SCP-8077. SCP-8077 looks up and drops the fish carcass. Omega is in front of it while Chi and Psi hold diagonal angles behind it. Its body doesn\u2019t move but its eyes dart rapidly. Omega: Florence Ignis. Surrender peacefully and you won\u2019t be harmed. SCP-8077 remains still for a moment longer before standing and attempting to run between Omega and Chi. Omega: Chi. Chi intercepts SCP-8077 before it can split the gap. She grabs it and holds it in place from behind with an arm around its throat. Psi rushes toward them, turning the valve attached to a steel canister of nitrous oxide horizontally fastened against the small of his back. He readies an oxygen mask connected to the canister with a hose, pressing it against SCP-8077\u2019s face. It quickly inhales, thrashing its body and legs wildly in an attempt to free itself from Chi\u2019s grasp, then spits onto the inside of the oxygen mask. The plastic immediately begins to dissolve where the saliva made contact with it. Psi rips the oxygen mask from SCP-8077\u2019s face and throws it away. Psi: Omega! The tarnished oxygen mask lands at Omega\u2019s feet and he immediately stamps it into the ground. The corrosion slows. He stamps it again. The corrosion ceases. Psi retrieves a nozzle holstered to his hip and connects it to the hose. SCP-8077: Wait! Psi levels the nozzle at SCP-8077\u2019s face and pulls the trigger. SCP-8077: Wait, wait, wait\u2026 SCP-8077\u2019s thrashing quickly slows as the nitrous oxide begins to take effect. Chi releases it and it stumbles between the Retrieval Team, slowly swaying from side to side. SCP-8077: S-She kissed me, I\u2026 I swear\u2026 she kissed me, she kissed me\u2026 SCP-8077 falls to its knees, clasping its trembling hands in front of its chest as it tilts its head upward, staring into the sky. Its voice is hushed and it is speaking rapidly. The Retrieval Team stands around it and watches. SCP-8077: O-Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be t-thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will b-be done; on earth as it is\u2026 as it is in h-heaven\u2026 SCP-8077 appears to clear its throat once, twice, before spiraling into a fit of strangled coughing. It covers its mouth with its hands as it begins to vomit, however, nothing emerges but saliva. The saliva dripping down from its chin and between its fingers immediately begins melting through the dirt and dead leaves beneath it but does not affect its hands. SCP-8077 raises its trembling, saliva-coated hands in front of its face, looking from them to the melting ground beneath it and back. SCP-8077: Why is my heart burning\u2026 why is there fire in my veins\u2026 SCP-8077\u2019s voice has lowered to a hoarse whisper. It drops its hands to the ground, its fingers digging into the decaying earth. It looks up at Omega, its expression one of abject horror, and it begins to cry. SCP-8077: \u2026why is my heart burning? SCP-8077\u2019s eyelids begin to twitch before its eyes completely close, it collapses onto its stomach, then goes silent. Psi disconnects the nozzle, slides it back into its holster, and turns the valve attached to the canister. Omega reaches down, picks up the destroyed oxygen mask, and stuffs it into a pouch clipped to his belt. He peels off his tactical gas mask and returns it to his belt as well. Chi and Psi follow suit. He presses the comm. on the side of his helmet. Omega: Overwatch. We\u2019ve secured the anomaly without issue. Heading to the extraction point now. A moment passes before Aimes responds. Aimes: Excellent work, Epsilon-6. We\u2019ll meet you town-side shortly. Omega: Ma\u2019am. Omega nods and presses the comm. a second time, switching it off. Psi gently lifts SCP-8077 from the ground, hooking one arm beneath its knees and wrapping the other around its shoulders. Psi: What should we do about its anomalous property? Chi: Pray it doesn\u2019t wake up and that the Extraction Team will have something figured out by the time they arrive. Omega nods in agreement. Omega: That\u2019s not our department, kid. Let\u2019s get going. The Retrieval Team starts off toward the extraction point with SCP-8077. [END LOG]",
        "SCP-8077: You heard them. I deserve this. The Devil poured hellfire down my throat because He knew what I was, what I could do for Him. I am red-hot temptation served cold on a silver platter. It\u2019s her fault she fell for me. It\u2019s her fault she\u2019s dead. SCP-8077 begins to sob. SCP-8077: Why\u2026 God, why? I didn\u2019t ask for this to happen\u2026 it\u2019s just what I am. Don\u2019t you understand? Don\u2019t you understand? Aimes sits in silence for a moment. And another moment passes. She sighs. Aimes: \u2026the heart wants what it wants, Florence. You can't choose who you love. It's love that chooses us. SCP-8077 stares at Aimes, drops its chin back to its chest, and continues to sob.",
        "Interview Log Transcript Interviewed: Joseph and Marilyn Ignis Interviewer(s): E6-01 (Alpha), E6-02 (Beta), E6-03 (Gamma) [BEGIN LOG] The Town-Side Team sits around a small table in the connected kitchen-dining room of the home. Alpha sits at one head of the table with Beta and Gamma on either side of him. A black duffle bag sits against the legs of Beta\u2019s chair. Marilyn sits at the other head of the table, constantly moving her hands from her lap to the table and back. Joseph walks from the kitchen to the table, an ornate teacup in his callused hands, and sits next to Marilyn. He slides the teacup in front of her, smiling. Joseph: (whispering) \u2026careful. It\u2019s hot. Marilyn taps the teacup with her fingers several times before slowly picking it up. She smiles. Marilyn: (whispering) \u2026thank you. She takes a sip of the teacup\u2019s contents. Joseph turns toward the Town-Side Team. Joseph: Are you sure I can\u2019t get you folks anything? Some water, maybe coffee? Alpha shakes his head. Alpha: No, thank you, Mr. Ignis. We don\u2019t plan on staying long, you see. Joseph shrugs. Joseph: Suit yourself. You said that you were here about Florence, didn\u2019t you? How can we help? Alpha: If it\u2019s alright with the both of you, we\u2019ve got some questions that we\u2019d have you answer for us. Marilyn takes another sip from her teacup. Marilyn: She should be home from\u2026 f-from school any minute now. Wouldn\u2019t you rather wait until then? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions! Her eyes appear to unfocus for a moment before returning to the Town-Side Team. Joseph doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Alpha glances at Beta out of the corner of his eye and she nods. Alpha: \u2026that\u2019s alright, Mrs. Ignis. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll have all the answers we need. Marilyn smiles. Marilyn: Alright then, if you\u2019re sure. Alpha returns her smiles with one of his own. Alpha: Great. Was your daughter acting different or unusual in any way throughout the days leading up to Morgan Finlay\u2019s death? Marilyn sighs and looks down into her teacup. Marilyn: The poor thing\u2026 it was such a shock for everyone. A girl as beautiful and bright as Morgan doesn\u2019t deserve to have her life snuffed out at such a young age. And her parents, God, I can\u2019t even imagine. The pain of losing your child, it\u2019s\u2026 it must be indescribable. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I didn\u2019t have Florence to dote on. Marilyn smiles and Joseph takes one of her hands into his own. Joseph: Morgan\u2019s death\u2026 you\u2019ve gotta understand, it hit Florence pretty hard. Florence never had many friends growing up. Maybe that\u2019s partially our fault, we kept her a bit sheltered, you see. But Morgan\u2026 a gift from God, I imagine. She really took a liking to Florence, took her under her wing. Joseph laughs softly to himself. Joseph: \u2026we used to joke that the two were joined at the hip. After they\u2019d met, it felt like we\u2019d never see Florence without her somewhere nearby, like the only exception was when we\u2019d tuck her in at night! They spent a lot of time here. Sometimes they\u2019d go back to Morgan\u2019s house but\u2026 well, mostly they\u2019d be here. Alpha: \u2026and before Morgan\u2019s death? Joseph: Right, right\u2026 Joseph raises his free hand and rubs one of his temples. Joseph: \u2026sorry about that. Florence was\u2026 she\u2026 Marilyn speaks up. Marilyn: (fondly) \u2026in all honesty, she was the same brand of strange that she\u2019d always been. She pauses for a moment before continuing. Marilyn: Although, if I had to pick out something stranger than usual from before Morgan\u2019s death, there was one thing. It was this\u2026 note, or paper, that she\u2019d been reading obsessively, over and over again. I swear, any time I\u2019d find her in her room, she\u2019d be reading it, the same one! Isn\u2019t that right, Joey? Marilyn squeezes Joseph\u2019s hand and he smiles wearily. Joseph: Yes, yes\u2026 I do remember that. Marilyn: I thought that maybe it was a report card for her classes or something. I was just happy that she\u2019d finally begun to take her studies more seriously, another effect that Morgan had had on her. But she\u2019d never let anyone read it. Marilyn sighs. Marilyn: After Morgan\u2019s death, I\u2026 She pauses for a moment before continuing. Marilyn: \u2026you know what? I can grab it for you. Gamma: Are you sure? We\u2019d hate to invade your privacy any more than we already have. Marilyn smiles. Marilyn: You\u2019re kind. But if you\u2019re writing about Morgan, I\u2019m sure Florence would be alright with you reading it. I\u2019ll be right back. Marilyn stands and walks from the table, presumably upstairs to SCP-8077\u2019s bedroom. A moment passes in silence. Then another. Joseph clears his throat. Joseph: So\u2026 you said this was for a newspaper article? Alpha nods. Alpha: Yes. Joseph: What paper? I\u2019ll have to keep an eye out! Alpha pauses for a moment before responding. Alpha: \u2026we\u2019ll send you a copy. Joseph: Ah\u2026 okay. Marilyn returns, sitting down at the table. She holds up what appears to be a folded piece of paper in her hand. Marilyn: Well, here it is. Strangely, certain edges of the folded piece of paper appear to be slightly charred. Alpha: You were saying that you\u2019d found out what it was? Marilyn shakes her head. Marilyn: No, I\u2026 I could never bring myself to read it. Not when it seemed so important to Florence, it just wouldn\u2019t feel right. But I know what it might be. Alpha: What\u2019s that? Marilyn: A few months ago, Florence had started burning papers in a small fire pit that we have in our backyard. She turns in her chair and points toward a window that looks out upon the property behind their home. Marilyn: When we asked what she was burning, she told us that they were just little notes that she\u2019d written to herself. Things to remember, to do, to keep track of\u2026 stuff like that. Marilyn laughs softly to herself. Marilyn: Just one of her little idiosyncrasies. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that this is one she decided to keep around for some reason. It looks like she started to burn it\u2026 She gestures to the folded piece of paper\u2019s charred edges. Marilyn: \u2026but never finished the job for some reason. The Town-Side Team stares in silence for a moment before she continues. Marilyn: I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all we know about it. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t have been of more use to you but like I said earlier, if you\u2019re happy to wait a little while longer, I\u2019m sure Florence would be happy to answer your questions herself! Alpha: That\u2019s quite alright, Mrs. Ignis. You\u2019ve been plenty helpful. Marilyn sighs. Marilyn: In any case, you\u2019d better take this with you. I know you\u2019ll do right by our girls. Marilyn holds out the folded piece of paper and Alpha takes it from her, placing it into his back pocket. Alpha: Thank you both. You\u2019ve truly helped us more than you know. Joseph smiles. Joseph: If we don\u2019t help our neighbors, who will? Beta peeks down at a watch on her wrist and turns to Alpha. Beta: It\u2019s time. Alpha nods. Alpha: Alright then. Masks up. Beta reaches down to the black duffle bag sitting against her chair and unzips it. Inside are three tactical gas masks. She passes the first to Alpha, who hands it to Gamma, passes the second to Alpha, and keeps the third for herself. The Town-Side Team each slide on their gas mask. Joseph and Marilyn watch them curiously but seem strangely unconcerned by their actions. The Town-Side Team stands. Joseph and Marilyn\u2019s eyes seem to unfocus, their eyelids growing heavy. Alpha: We\u2019ll be taking our leave now. We\u2019re terribly sorry for your loss, Mr. and Mrs. Ignis. Florence was an amazing girl. She\u2019ll be missed dearly. Marilyn grabs at the sides of her head for a moment, groaning, her eyes squeezed shut. She slowly opens her eyes. Her voice is soft, barely above a whisper. Marilyn: Our\u2026 loss? Right, right\u2026 yes, thank you, God bless her, God bless them both. May they both rest in peace\u2026 finally. Joseph looks up at the Town-Side Team, his head swaying gently from side to side. Joseph: \u2026can I g-g-get you fellas anything? Water? Maybe\u2026 iced t-tea? Alpha: We really must be going, Mr. Ignis. Thank you. Joseph and Marilyn slowly rest their heads atop the table and fall silent. Alpha retrieves a small radio from his pocket and holds it up to the front of his gas mask, pressing down its push-to-talk button. Alpha: Overwatch. The amnesticization has been taken care of. We\u2019re heading to rendezvous with the Retrieval Team, then we\u2019ll head to the extraction point and prepare for a lift back to 81-5. Over and out. Alpha releases the push-to-talk button and slides the radio back into his pocket. He nods toward the front door. Alpha: Come on, let\u2019s get going. It\u2019s getting stuffy in here. Alpha walks to the front door and steps out. Beta and Gamma follow close behind and Gamma closes the door behind them. [END LOG]"

The containment chamber has been modified to the extent that once every hour, a specialized aerosol will be released into the containment chamber that severely inhibits the production of saliva within the mouth when inhaled. Due to a hypothesized post-traumatic unresponsiveness toward Foundation questioning, beginning shortly, SCP-8077 will be visited by a Foundation-sanctioned psychiatrist for regular sessions. While the chosen psychiatrist will be permitted to wear a provided mask or face covering during their sessions, SCP-8077 is to remain exposed to the specialized aerosol at all times.",

While SCP-8077\u2019s organs and tissue are immune to the corrosive effects of its saliva, it has been observed to drastically affect most other materials (organic and inorganic) that it has come into contact with, resulting in the rapid corrosion and decomposition of said material.
