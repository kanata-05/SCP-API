To prevent unintentional alteration of this document, do not proceed unless accessing this page from an approved Site.\n\n\n\u2014 Dr. Jaskes, Senior Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are currently accessing this document from: \nSite-01\n.\n\n\nAccess approved\n, retrieving document\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem#:\n \n4870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Class:\n\n\neuclid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Class:\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption Class:\n\n\nvlam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Class:\n\n\nnotice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n No iteration of this file is allowed on Site-17 servers at this time. All documentation pertaining to SCP-4870 may only be accessed on different Sites' servers until further notice. Moreover, data servers at Site-17 are to be modified with a unique digital signature that will prohibit access to documents that could potentially be modified by SCP-4870.\n\n\nAll SCP-4870-1 instances discovered are to be destroyed or reverted to unaffected iterations if possible. Research into the cause of SCP-4870 is still underway and any discoveries on the subject are to be brought to Dr. Jaskes' attention at once. All potential research inquiries regarding the Neutralization of SCP-4870 are to be considered, as no current means to do so has yet been found.\n\n\nIf found, SCP-4870-2 is to be contained at once. Due to the unknown and potentially hazardous nature of SCP-4870-2, extreme caution is to be exercised during this process.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4870 is a phenomenon affecting Site-17 by which the content of certain documents physically present or digitally accessed at the Site, thereafter designated SCP-4870-1, have a chance of being anomalously altered to include text suggesting the existence of a specimen of \nGopherus Polyphemus\n1\n, designated SCP-4870-2, at or near Site-17.\n\n\nDocuments susceptible to SCP-4870 commonly share one or more of the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\nCover topics of or relating to herpetology\n2\n or chelonian entities\n\n\nDirectly name or refer to Site-17\n\n\nAre written or compiled before 1998\n\n\nContain the words 'substantially,' 'densest,' or 'subterranean'\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of SCP-4870-1 \u201cwrite-ins\u201d are minor, consisting of brief mentions of SCP-4870-2, phrased in a way that makes the writer appear fond of SCP-4870-2 and refer to it in a positive manner.\n\n\nBeyond the text added by SCP-4870, the original content of SCP-4870-1 instances remains unaltered. Digital records, printed text, and even handwriting is subject to SCP-4870's effects if they should meet the above conditions. (See Addendum 4870-A) Susceptible documents are affected at a rate of an average of three documents per week, though the changes appear to be made instantaneously.\n\n\nTo date SCP-4870-2 has not been discovered, if it indeed exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are viewing an archived version of this file.\n\nClick \nhere\n to view its most recent iteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
