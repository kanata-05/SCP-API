Research is ongoing to find a reliable way to identify instances of SCP-7402-1. In the event that SCP-7402 activates, Mobile Task Force Beta-1 (\u201cCauterizers\u201d) is responsible for the investigation and termination of all SCP-7402-1 instances. Depending on the situation, other Mobile Task Forces may be deployed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7402 is a recurring anomalous phenomenon that manifests an alternate version of Foundation personnel and replaces them. These alternate personnel are designated SCP-7402-1. Current information shows that all SCP-7402-1 originate from an alternate SCP Foundation, having the motto of \u201cSabotage, Control, Purify.\u201d As of now, SCP-7402-1 instances appear to be identical to the replaced personnel.\n\n\nThe aim of all SCP-7402-1 is to invade and control the world by sabotaging Foundation operations. SCP-7402-1 instances have utilised their false identities to cause widespread containment breaches and assassinate personnel to destabilise the Foundation. Currently, there is no way to identify instances of SCP-7402-1 with certainty.\n\n\nThe amount of SCP-7402-1 instances varies with each activation of SCP-7402. During the first activation of SCP-7402, approximately 37% of Foundation personnel were replaced by SCP-7402-1 instances. The following activations only replaced approximately 1-6% of personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 3 CLASSIFIED\n\n\n\n\nACCESS TO THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 3 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND LEAD TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[Input\u00a0security\u00a0credentials]\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[Accessing\u00a0file...]\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 7402-A:\n Incident Report\n\n\nOverview:\n The following is a transcription from Agent William Stone's bodycam footage.

We've been on standby for almost 6 hours and we still don't know what's going on.\n\n\nParker:\n From what I've been told, it's something about a group of rogue personnel in Site-44 killing the damn Site Director. They've been neutralised already though.\n\n\nStone:\n What\u2019s Command so concerned about then?\n\n\nParker:\n Their actions seem like the Chaos Insurgency's work, but nothing was found on their bodies. Command thinks that the same thing might happen here.\n\n\nKing:\n Just because it happened to a Site in the same country as this one doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll happen to us too.\n\n\nBailey:\n King\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t take a smart-ass like hers to realise it.\n\n\nKing:\n I\u2019m taking that as a complime-\n\n\n<Site raid alarms start blaring, operatives of MTF \u03b2-1 scramble into position.>\n\n\nCommand:\n Multiple hostile agents in Sector 3. They've terminated the Ethics Committee Liaison and are headed for the Department Head offices. You are authorised to terminate any suspects.\n\n\nParker:\n Understood, moving toward targets.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 sprint towards Sector 1, other personnel are running the other way. Turning the corner, Parker almost runs right into the back of a Security Officer.>\n\n\nStone:\n (\nYelling and pointing gun\n) Get your fucking hands up!\n\n\n<Security Officer turns around and lifts his gun up but gets shot down by King. Bailey runs up to inspect the body.>\n\n\nBailey:\n Kill shot. No signs of being an Insurgent either.\n\n\nParker:\n Command, rogue Security Officer down in Sector 2. Continuing pursuit.\n\n\nCommand:\n Roger, we've been cut out of the security camera system but the Department Heads are probably in the lecture hall.\n\n\nParker:\n (\nTurns to others\n) Come on, let's go.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 breaks into the lecture hall. Department Heads are kneeling, surrounded by approximately 80 personnel. MTF \u03b2-1 fires shots before taking cover behind desks, a barrage of bullets zips overhead.>\n\n\nStone:\n Shit. How are there so many of them?\n\n\nBailey:\n Shoot first, ask questions later, they're clearly hostile!\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 engages with gunfire. After a few minutes, all the hostiles seem to be injured or dead. 3 of the 9 Department Heads are dead.>\n\n\nParker:\n Command, approximately 60 hostiles eliminated or detained. Department Heads are secure, although three of them were caught in the crossfire.\n\n\nCommand:\n Well done, backup team arriving soon.\n\n\nKing:\n There's no way that the Chaos Insurgency corrupted so many of our personnel. I mean, 80 rogues is like 20% of the Site staff!\n\n\nStone:\n It does seem odd\u2026 Maybe it was an anomalous thing?\n\n\nParker:\n Anomalous or not, we'll probably learn more during the debrief.

MTF Beta-1 in operation debrief.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nParker:\n You may begin, sir.\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n Okay. Let me start by appraising your fast reaction, if it wasn\u2019t for all of you, all of the Department Heads in there would\u2019ve probably been killed.\n\n\nKing:\n Thanks to trigger-happy Bailey over here. What was it? \u201cShoot first, ask questions later\u201d?\n\n\nBailey:\n Hey now, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea, was it?\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n (\nClears his throat\n) Continuing on, the rogue agents we\u2019ve detained will be interrogated soon.\n\n\nStone:\n Do we know who they might be working for?\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n Well, not really. There aren't any hints from their gear, so we can't be too sure. Some of them were actually long-term members of the Foundation, we still don't know what got them to turn.\n\n\nParker:\n Couldn't it be a sleeper agent situation? Maybe they were compromised during an earlier operation.\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n It's possible. We need to dig deeper into their backgrounds and communica-\n\n\n<A tablet notification buzzes, the Administrative Personnel checks his tablet.>\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n Sorry, seems like you guys have a new mission and\u2026 Hold on, O5-12 will personally brief you.\n\n\n<The Administrative Personnel presses a few buttons on the tablet and the screen behind him changes to the face of O5-12.>\n\n\nO5-12:\n Hello Beta-1, I have other things to tend to so this will be quick. In the past few hours, Sites around the globe have declared an emergency or containment breach and requested backup, but contacted us again after a few minutes claiming it was a malfunction. Your objective is Site-45.\n\n\nKing:\n No time for any brekkie?\n\n\nBailey:\n Well that\u2019s just great, going on an empty stomach. The stomach growling might as well give away our position.\n\n\nStone:\n Not now, Bailey. Any background info on what we're going into?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Site-45 declared an emergency an hour ago claiming that the Site Director was assassinated, but said it was a false alarm a few minutes later. Onsite security staff also supported this claim, but our intel makes us suspect rogue personnel have taken over. I trust that you remain professional.\n\n\nBailey:\n Right, sorry\u2026 So we're sent to clean out the rogues?\n\n\nO5-12:\n Correct, you are sent to investigate what happened at Site-45 and subdue any suspected rogues, termination is also deemed necessary. Remember, don\u2019t take this lightly. I will be overseeing this operation.\n\n\nAdministrative Personnel:\n I'll also be mobilising more Beta-1 to help, you may leave now.\n\n\nParker:\n Thank you. Okay, team, check your gear, we leave in 5.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 walks out of the debriefing room and is joined by more members of MTF \u03b2-1.>\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/01/14\n\n\nNOTE:\n 200 meters away from Site-45.

Stone, Lennox, King, Bailey, and Anderson, check Sectors 3 and 4. The rest of you, with me to Sectors 1 and 2. Let's go.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 enters Site-45 through the main gate and splits up. As the team turns the corner, multiple bodies are lying on the ground, all with gunshot wounds.>\n\n\nBailey:\n I\u2019m gonna say it again\u2026 It\u2019s them Insurgents.\n\n\nStone:\n Command, you seeing this? We might need more backup.\n\n\nCommand:\n Yes. Looks like something is definitely wrong there. Security measures also seem to be down, proceed with caution. As for the backup\u2026\n\n\nO5-12:\n Your request for backup has been denied. We cannot have too many operatives in the same place.\n\n\nStone:\n Copy that. Anderson, check if they\u2019re alive.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Alright\u2026 Let\u2019s see here. (\nChecks pulse of a nearby body\n) This one's dead.\n\n\nLennox:\n Hate to be the one to say it but with all those gunshot wounds, these guys ain't surviv-\n\n\n<Lights flickers a bit before turning off.>\n\n\nBailey:\n Shit, what the hell?\n\n\nStone:\n Activate NVGs and stay alert. Command, lights just went out?\n\n\n<Radio silence for twelve seconds.>\n\n\nStone:\n Command, do you copy?\n\n\n<Radio silence for six seconds.>\n\n\nKing:\n Jammed comms maybe?\n\n\nStone:\n It's a possibility. Lennox, Anderson, Bailey, check the electricity generators. King, with me to the control room, if anyone is jamming our comms it should be there.\n\n\nLennox:\n Roger.\n\n\n<Lennox, Anderson, and Bailey run off in the other direction. Stone and King sneak forward in the dark.\n\n\nStone:\n (\nWhispering\n) Stay close, I don't like the feeling of this.\n\n\nKing:\n (\nLooks around\n) What the hell happened here\u2026\n\n\n<They approach the control room door, which is slightly open. Stone signals King to take point.>\n\n\nStone:\n On three. One\u2026 two\u2026 three!\n\n\n<They barge into the control room, the large screens flicker with static and desks are messy. There are more bodies on the ground.>\n\n\nKing:\n (\nLooks around\n) There doesn't seem to be anything jamming our comms here, try again.\n\n\nStone:\n Command, do you copy?\n\n\n<Radio silence for eight seconds.>\n\n\nStone:\n Still nothing on the radio. Try accessing the security footage, something is definitely not right\u2026\n\n\nKing:\n (\nAccessing computer terminal\n) I can\u2019t access any systems, everything\u2019s locked down.\n\n\nStone:\n Try the code \"4R94H3E5\", it's an override.\n\n\nKing:\n (\nShakes head\n) Doesn't seem to work eith-\n\n\n<A loud blast echoes from the hallway outside, followed by footsteps. Stone and King tense up, aiming their weapons at the door.>\n\n\nKing:\n We need to regroup with the others. (\nMoves towards the door\n)\n\n\nStone:\n No, don't. Whoever's out there might see us.\n\n\nLennox:\n (\nDistant and yelling\n) Stone! King! Are you there?\n\n\nKing:\n (\nYelling back\n) Yes! We're in here! What the hell is going on out there?!\n\n\n<Lennox, Anderson and Bailey enter the control room, visibly exhausted.>\n\n\nKing:\n You guys okay?\n\n\nLennox:\n For now, yeah. We checked the generators like you asked and a few security dudes shot at us, safe to say they're not alive anymore. They were the ones who disabled the lights beyond repair.\n\n\nBailey:\n We tried to radio it in but comms was still down and we heard that blast, so we ran here to check up on you two.\n\n\nStone:\n Yeah, we couldn't find anything that was jamming our comms here.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Well this is the only place where there could be a jamming device with a large range, if it's anywhere else, it has to be portable which comes with the downside of a very low range.\n\n\nKing:\n So it ain't here.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Doesn't seem like it\u2026\n\n\nStone:\n We were locked out of the Site's system too, even with the override code we were given as a contingency.\n\n\nLennox:\n Pretty sure the only people capable of that are the people at Command, no?\n\n\nStone:\n Are you suggesting Command went rogue and locked us out?\n\n\nBailey:\n Pfft, no way! Didn\u2019t they have this whole thing about that last month?\n\n\nAnderson:\n It's very plausible, Command can also jam our comms incase of \"auditory anomalies\" to protect themselves.\n\n\nKing:\n If that's the case, we need to find Parker right now\u2026\n\n\nStone:\n Let's go then, shall we?\n\n\n<The team runs toward Sector 3, shooting down hostiles on the way. As they turn the corner, Dr. Babel and two security guards have their backs to the team.>\n\n\nAnderson:\n (\nYelling\n) Hey!

(\nHolds up screwdriver\n)\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I di- didn't defect, dude! I come from an alternate universe from yours and I work for an alternate version of the Foundation.\n\n\nLennox:\n Go on.\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n Uhm\u2026 Instead of researching how to containing SCPs, we sort of focus more research into how to control them and use them to our own advantage to sabotage governments and purify the world. So, instead of your motto of \"Secure, Contain, Protect\", our motto is \"Sabotage, Control, Purify.\"\n\n\nStone:\n Why are you here? Or, properly speaking, how?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I don't know\u2026 One minute I was working normally and then I was suddenly here. Everything felt the same but something felt off, you know?\n\n\nStone:\n Hold on, if you didn\u2019t know what was going on, how did you know what to do? How do you know about our world?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I think I was contacted shortly after I arrived by someone with very high authority\u2026\n\n\nLennox:\n Who?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I can\u2019t remember who, but they were high enough on the chain of command to send me classified files containing information on what your Foundation does and new instructions without alerting anyone else.\n\n\nStone:\n There\u2019s a functioning computer terminal here, show us.\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\n\n\nLennox:\n (\nThrusts screwdriver\n) Why the hell not?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n DUDE! We were ordered to delete all of it after we memorised it. What do you want me to do?!\n\n\nLennox:\n Okay then, how many of you are there?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n It's\u2026 Complicated. I don't even know what the others are doing, let alone how many of us have come here. All I know are the orders given to my team.\n\n\nLennox:\n (\nLooks over back at Stone and Bailey\n) Any other questions?\n\n\nStone:\n Well then, Dr. Babel, what were your most recent orders?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n To kill all of you in Site-45 then board a plane to Site-01.\n\n\nBailey:\n (\nQuietly\n) Fuck.\n\n\nLennox:\n Site-01? Why?\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n Something about taking control\u2026 I don't really know the details, but I do know that most of us should be there within 24 hours.\n\n\nStone:\n And you're sure of this information? I'll kill you if I find out you're lying.\n\n\nDr. Babel:\n I'm very sure, yes.\n\n\nStone:\n (\nTo Lennox\n) Stay here, I need to make a call.\n\n\n<Stone walks out of the room and sees Anderson and King.>\n\n\nStone:\n You two, get back inside.\n\n\nAnderson:\n How 'bout you?\n\n\nStone:\n I have to go make a call.

Please state the emergency regarding the O5 Council.\n\n\nStone:\n I have a theory about all of the Sites that declared an emergency but said it was a malfunction a few minutes later. Our team was sent to investigate Site-45, in which we realised there were large amounts of rogue agents.\n\n\nGraves:\n I see.\n\n\nStone:\n We've taken one of the rogue agents and interrogated them. I have reason to believe that all the Sites that declared the false emergency has been taken over by rogue agents.\n\n\nGraves:\n Other Mobile Task Forces dispatched to investigate have either reported suspicious activity or have disappeared, but I fail to understand how this threatens the O5 Council.\n\n\nStone:\n The agent also gave information regarding a potential attack on Site-01 within the next 24 hours.\n\n\nGraves:\n I understand. Please give me a moment.\n\n\n<Six minutes go by>\n\n\nGraves:\n Apologies for the wait, Agent Stone. By order of the O5 Council, Mobile Task Force Beta-1 is to arrive at Site-01 as soon as possible.

MTF Beta-1 arriving at Site-01.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSecurity Guard:\n Greetings, we have been expecting you. Please follow me.\n\n\nStone:\n Lead the way.\n\n\nKing:\n (\nLooking around\n) Man, I\u2019ve almost forgotten about this place.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Maybe they should use stronger amnestics on you next time? Purge all your memories in the process too.\n\n\nLennox:\n The jokes Bailey were funnie-\n\n\nStone:\n Enough, we\u2019re going inside and we have to act professional.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 enter Site-01 and get through security. They meet Graves.>\n\n\nGraves:\n Welcome, the O5 Council are waiting for you. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to leave your gear here, we don\u2019t want any danger to come close to them.\n\n\nStone:\n Of course.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 gets searched and screened more times before entering the O5 Council meeting room, followed by Graves. 7 members are present, including O5-1, O5-2, O5-4, O5-8, O5-9, O5-11, and O5-13. O5-12 is on a screen. MTF \u03b1-1 is stationed around the room.>\n\n\nO5-1:\n Pleasure to meet you again, Stone. You\u2019ll have to excuse the missing members, they are still en route here and some we can\u2019t even get in contact with. Now please, tell us what you know.\n\n\nStone:\n As you already know, some Sites have been reporting malfunctioning in their systems which is the cause of their so-called false alarms and breaches. We have interrogated a rogue personnel from Site-45 and they\u2019ve revealed that the other Sites experiencing similar problems have rogue agents within too.\n\n\nO5-11:\n How does this affect us then?\n\n\nStone:\n The large amount of rogue agents suggests that this may be an anomalous phenomenon over an GoI trying to invade us, this suspicion was also backed up by the interrogated agent. And they\u2019ve also said that these agents are headed here, to take control.\n\n\nO5-4\n Can someone verify that?\n\n\nGraves:\n The satellite network shows multiple cargo and fighter planes headed in our direction, problem is these planes are registered as our own.\n\n\nStone:\n We have to assume they\u2019ve taken control already then. We have to prepare for an invasion.\n\n\nO5-2:\n How sure of this are we? I don\u2019t want another false alarm happening.\n\n\nGraves:\n The cargo planes originate from Site-06-3, Site-42, Site-106, and Site-107. All of which have not contacted us since the malfunction. The first plane will arrive in approximately 1 hour.\n\n\nStone:\n That proves my point, and more are definitely coming. How many people can the planes store?\n\n\nGraves:\n Each plane is designed to carry large cargo, so the maximum amount of personnel that can fit is 102, but there could be more.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Which brings the total to more than 400\u2026\n\n\nO5-4:\n Can\u2019t we just shoot them down before they reach us?\n\n\nGraves:\n They\u2019re modified, so normal missiles can\u2019t work. And our anomalous missile silos have probably been taken over, we don\u2019t have contact with them.\n\n\nO5-13:\n I assume sending our own to intercept probably isn\u2019t a good idea too then.\n\n\nGraves:\n Sadly, no. Their convoy is too armed and any effort to try and fight them in the sky won\u2019t work.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Hold on, does that mean there are probably rogue agents already inside of Site-01?\n\n\nStone:\n Most likely, yes. But the fact that they didn\u2019t try to overthrow us yet suggests that they don\u2019t have the manpower ye-\n\n\n<An alarm starts sounding, interrupting the the meeting.>\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n Warning, missile alert. Warning, missile alert. Missiles inbound.\n\n\nO5-9:\n (\nTo Graves\n) I thought you said an hour?\n\n\nGraves:\n They might as well start sending their missiles against us, that way we can\u2019t use it against them if we take back the missile silos.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Can\u2019t we evacuate? To get away from all this.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I don\u2019t think missiles can do anything to Site-01.\n\n\nGraves:\n Not anymore, our escape tunnels are going to be destroyed by the missiles and the helicopters can\u2019t lift off with missiles in the air. New information suggests that the rogue agents have numbers up to six hundred thousand, they\u2019ll hunt us all down anyway.\n\n\nO5-12:\n The best option is to stay here. We cannot risk it outside.\n\n\nO5-4:\n How sure are we of this, Twelve? That we won\u2019t be overthrown from the inside.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I\u2019m fairly certain everything is fine. As Stone said before, the rogues have not tried to overthrow us from the inside, meaning they lack the personnel to do so.\n\n\nO5-1:\n Okay then. Graves, initiate Procedure Sentinel-01. Stone, please bring your team down to the staging area, a commander will be there.\n\n\nGraves:\n Of course. (\nInto radio\n) Control, initiate Procedure Sentinel-01.\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n Procedure Sentinel-01 initiated by O5-1. Site lockdown activated.\n\n\nO5-12:\n I\u2019ll notify all the offsite Council members. Good luck in there.\n\n\nStone:\n Yes sir.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 run towards the staging area, but are stopped by a squad of MTF \u03b1-1 in the hallway.>\n\n\nAnderson:\n What the hell man? We have direct orders from O5-1.\n\n\nAlpha-1 Operative:\n O5-4 has requested Agent King. The rest of you are to continue as ordered.\n\n\nKing:\n Well\u2026 I guess I can\u2019t not go.\n\n\n<King walks away with the MTF \u03b1-1 squad. MTF \u03b2-1 continue towards the staging area.>\n\n\nLennox:\n What the hell was that?\n\n\nStone:\n You never know what\u2019s going to happen when you\u2019re dealing with the O5 Council, let\u2019s just listen to our orders.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 reach the staging area, members of different MTFs and security personnel are busy gearing up. MTF \u03b2-1 meet a Alpha-1 Commander.>\n\n\nStone:\n Sir, what do you need us to do?\n\n\nAlpha-1 Commander:\n Try to sniff out any rogue agents in here for now, when the first plane arrives I want your team to be stationed at Sector 2.\n\n\nStone:\n Of course. (\nTo other members\n) Come on, guys.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 wander around the staging area, occasionally asking some questions to suspicious personnel. King returns, accompanied by the MTF \u03b1-1 squad.>\n\n\nKing:\n Hey, Stone.\n\n\nStone:\n Welcome back, we need help wi-\n\n\nKing:\n I\u2019m leaving with these guys, they gave me a new mission. This one is more important.\n\n\nStone:\n More important than defending here?\n\n\nKing:\n Unfortunately, yes\u2026 Good luck to you, and see you later.\n\n\nStone:\n Wait-\n\n\n<King turns around and leaves, followed by the MTF \u03b1-1 squad.>\n\n\nAlpha-1 Commander:\n (\nOver speaker\n) Attention, I\u2019m sure you all have questions on why you have been gathered. Rogue Foundation agents are headed here, and their manpower is equivalent to or even surpassing ours. An estimated total of six hundred thousand rogue agents will be arriving over the span of 48 hours to try and take over. We cannot fail, because if we do, the world will too. Starting today, all of you are the SCP Foundation\u2019s defenders, and the world's protectors.\n\n\n<Thirty-four minutes pass. Personnel resume preparation for invasion, Stone tells Lennox and Anderson about King's departure.>\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n Missile strike contact in 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026 Contact. Scranton Reality Anchors disabled. Site cloaking disabled. Security drones damaged. Six minutes before enemy contact.\n\n\n<Seven minutes pass, all personnel are geared up and in position. MTF \u03b2-1 is stationed near the entrance.>\n\n\nIntercom:\n Enemy combatants are parachuting down. All personnel are authorised to terminate them. Do not fail, the world depends on you.\n\n\nStone:\n (\nTurning to team\n) You heard them, guns up and stay sharp.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Well this is it, huh?\n\n\nStone:\n Yes. Remember, focus for headshots.\n\n\nIntercom:\n All personnel, prepare for incoming hostiles. Engage only if necessary, focus on defence.\n\n\n<Overhead screens display red warning signs as the first rogue agents reach the ground and start setting up an unknown device.>\n\n\nLennox:\n Hold on\u2026 Isn\u2019t that \n1290\n?\n\n\nStone:\n Shit. (\nTo radio\n) All combatants, hostiles seem to have brought SCP-1290 and are attempting to forcefully break through the site entrance. All personnel at Sector 1 must retreat back to Sector 2 immediately.\n\n\nSecurity Guard:\n (\nFrom radio\n) Roger that, retreating now.\n\n\n<Combatants are seen retreating to Sector 2. Twenty-one seconds later, detonations outside can be heard.>\n\n\nAnderson:\n Are they throwing explosives at the door?\n\n\nLennox:\n More like teleporting them.\n\n\nIntercom:\n Blast doors have been broken through. Hostiles have now entered the facility.\n\n\nStone:\n Let's do this, shall we?\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 and combatants hide behind sandbags, aiming towards the hallway entrance. Flashbangs and smoke grenades are thrown into the hallway before gunshots ring out.>\n\n\nStone:\n Keep calm, we have enough firepower to hold this position.\n\n\n<Crossfire goes on for nine minutes, both sides hold their ground.>\n\n\nIntercom:\n SOMEONE HEL-\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n System override activated. Procedure Sentinel-02 initiated by UNKNOWN. Site lockdown lifted. Shutting down systems\u2026\n\n\nAnderson:\n Shit. What the hell?\n\n\nAlpha-1 Commander:\n (\nFrom radio\n) We are experiencing a system breach. Personnel in Sector-2, hold your ground. Personnel in Sectors 3, 4, 5, and 6, be on alert. Beta-1, check out command center. Alpha-1, head to respective O5 personnel.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 leave Sector 2, making their way to the command center. The hallway lights suddenly turn off.>\n\n\nLennox:\n Man\u2026 Again?\n\n\nStone:\n Stay quiet, we kill on sight.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 reach the command centre, the screens placed around the room show simultaneous camera footage from different angles.>\n\n\nStone:\n (\nTo commander\n) What do you need sir?\n\n\nAlpha-1 Commander:\n Find out if anyone in here is rogue, I want to you interrogate all of them and detain any of them that you suspect. We cannot have anything go wrong here. Report back to me once you're done.\n\n\nStone:\n Yes sir.\n\n\n<MTF \u03b2-1 interrogate each person inside the command center one by one. After fifty-two minutes, four personnel are detained and put in holding cells. They arrive back in the command room.>\n\n\nAnderson:\n So, what now?\n\n\nStone:\n (\nTo radio\n) Commander, all personnel have been interrogated, and suspected rogues have been detained. Awaiting orders.\n\n\nAlpha-1 Commander:\n (\nFrom radio\n) Stay there and keet a watch on the people there. There has to be some good liars in there that got pass your interrogation techniques. We're fine on defending right now, Tau-5 have been deployed to assist.\n\n\nStone:\n Roger. (\nTo Lennox and Anderson\n) We're staying here.\n\n\nAnderson:\n Bet. What do you think is going on here though?\n\n\nLennox:\n Might as well ask. (\nTo a manager\n) Excuse me, what's this footage showing?\n\n\nManager:\n See for yourself.\n\n\n<The manager unplugs his headphones and changes the volume output to speakers. Voices of MTF a-1 can be heard. >\n\n\nAlpha-1 Operative:\n (\nFrom radio\n) Command, thirty-nine minutes out.\n\n\nManager:\n Copy that, reach out when you're five minutes from target.\n\n\nAnderson:\n What target?\n\n\nManager:\n For your authorisation, that's classified. You are, of course, still allowed to watch since you've been ordered to stay here.\n\n\n<Forty-one minutes pass, nothing eventful. Foundation personnel continue to defend against oncoming rogue agents.>\n\n\nLennox:\n (\nLooks at screen\n) Hey, isn't that Kin-\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n System onlin-\n\n\nO5-12:\n (\nOn intercom\n) That's too sad\u2026 You've put up a good fight, but if we can't fight the Foundation, we'll just it blow all up.\n\n\nAutomated Intercom:\n -ceedure Cataclysm-00 initiated by O5-12. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles headed for all Foundation Sites. Site-01 Nuclear Warhead detonation in one minute.\n\n\nLennox:\n Wh- What?\n\n\nStone:\n FUCK! How did we not think about that?!\n\n\nAnderson:\n O5-12 is a rogue\u2026?\n\n\nManager:\n No, no, no\u2026 (\nTo radio\n) PTF Xi-0, you are to engage immediately. I repeat, you are to engage immediately. Enter \nSite-\u03b8\n now and initiate Procedure Lazarus-01.\n\n\nAlpha-1 Operative:\n (\nFrom radio\n) Roger that, moving in.\n\n\n<Command center personnel begin to panic. The screens shows a team running into a Yellowstone park ranger station.>\n\n\nAnderson:\n Shit\u2026 Are we really going to die\u2026?\n\n\nAlpha-1 Operative:\n (\nFrom radio\n) King, activate it. We'll shut the doors\n\n\nKing:\n (\nFrom radio\n) Right. Command, we require an access code.\n\n\nManager:\n (\nPanicking\n) Uhm- Hold on\u2026 I'm notifying the O5s to\u2026\n\n\nAnderon:\n Wait- Why is she there?\n\n\nStone:\n KING!
