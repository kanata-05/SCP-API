The mess is not cleanable.\n\n\nAs of this memo, SCP-6892 is currently located in Research Room 3 of B-Wing. Do not remove SCP-6892, as I still have important work to finish.\n\n\nIf staff report sightings of an individual displaying paranormal properties, such as intangibility or levitation, do not be alarmed. These are simply the properties of SCP-6892-1.\n\n\nTo O'Hara and Director Roberts, I would like to extend a thank you for your constant attendance and prayers on the anniversary of my death; it means more than I could ever express.\n\n\n- Snr.
