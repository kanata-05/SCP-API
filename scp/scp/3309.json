Narrativic inoculation is required, as this document contains several embedded narrativohazards.\n1\n Personnel without inoculation against such anomalies may experience a narrative paraphrasing event.\n\n\nAre you sure you wish to continue?\n\n\n\n\nNarrativic inoculation disseminated.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, we don\u2019t fade until it\u2019s too late.\n\n\nUntil we\u2019ve withered, withered, to the bone. And at the end, there\u2019s nothing left. It\u2019s forgotten. Memories, hopes, and dreams: \nwe\n are forgotten.\n\n\nHow would we be sure if these memories, hopes, and dreams were truly ours? If they were real? Who would forget us if nothing were there to begin with? We fade from the minds of others, but never our own. We live with ourselves until we can\u2019t live any longer. Until we forget if there were ever any way we could have lived in peace. And then, we fade away.\n\n\nFade, fade away.\n\n\n\n\nInoculation completed! You may continue.\n\n\n \n\n\nItem Number:\n SCP-3309\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n All documentation on anomalies affected by SCP-3309 is to be preserved in a paraphrased format and kept within the RAISA Archive database. After the containment of an instance, all personnel assigned to the affected anomaly must undergo amnestic treatment and transfer to unrelated projects.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3309 is a phenomenon in which catalogued anomalies spontaneously disappear. Items affected by SCP-3309 have included anomalous objects, entities, locations, and conceptual structures. Anomalies affected by this phenomenon appear to lack a causal relation; SCP-3309 activity is indicated by a note of unknown origin (designated \nSCP-3309-1\n).\n\n\nBetween 24 and 36 hours before the disappearance of an anomaly, SCP-3309-1 appears appended to the item's file. Documents undergoing SCP-3309 become wiped from all known file systems, including Protected Site-01 and RAISA Archives. Afterward, the anomaly itself becomes effectively neutralized or otherwise disappears.\n\n\nThe contents of SCP-3309-1 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not the author and you want to rewrite this article, you may reply to this post asking for the opportunity to do so. Please obtain permission from the author.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3309 affects backups created for disappearing documents. SCP-3309 also affects the documents of anomalous items encountering SCP-3309; about 71% of disappearing documents are connected to other, unaffected anomalies. This leads to a weakening in the Foundation's anomaly containment network, potentially escalating to an ADK-Class \u201cComplete Anomalous Destabilization\u201d Scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. \nNarrativohazard:\n A cascading hazard affecting elements of a narrative and its mode of transmission, often leading to their mutual destruction. Definitions of a narrative differ among cultures but typically describe a story and its medium.\n\nN.B.: Anomalies such as \nSCP-2747\n, \nSCP-5309\n, and \nSCP-5875\n fall under this categorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDA MATERIALS\n\n\n\n\nI.

Researchers assigned to SCP-3309 have identified an emerging pattern and developed a list of criteria:\n\n\n\n\nAffected items are documented as having been contained with excessive containment procedures, such as chambers constructed from heavy-duty titanium alloy. This indicates either a misunderstanding of the anomaly's nature or an unprofessional level of care taken to contain it.\n\n\nThe affected item itself is powerful enough to threaten a K-Class \u201cEnd-of-the-World\u201d Scenario. Documentation outlines only partial consequences of the anomaly, and any Provisional Containment Procedures typically align with that of the first criteria.\n\n\nThe affected item's documentation \u2014 including any added supplements \u2014 is poorly written, improperly formatted, or filled with logical and grammatical errors.\n\n\n\n\nBased on these observations, the containment team has proposed Project: TAPERED SPEAR. TAPERED SPEAR outlines the adaptation of these criteria for use against high-risk anomalies to neutralize them. As this contravenes the Foundation's mission, an \nEthics Committee\n special tribunal has contested the execution of TAPERED SPEAR.\n\n\nThe results of this tribunal are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT: TAPERED SPEAR\n\n\nTRIBUNAL RESULTS\n\n\n\n\nFOR:\n \n21\n\n\nAGAINST:\n \n20\n\n\nABSTAIN:\n \n2\n\n\nOUTCOME:\n TAPERED SPEAR is authorized.

Attached is an experimentation log, the results of which will determine a final decision.\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL EXCERPT\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL:\n Use SCP-3309 to neutralize \nSCP-4463\n: A complex water-based spatial anomaly capable of flooding North America within 50 years.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n SCP-4463 is a water-based anomaly affecting parts of the Chihuahuan Desert in the state of Arizona. SCP-4463 describes the gradual transformation of a substantial area of the desert into an equal area of wetlands.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, desertification of southeastern Arizona has occurred at a rate of 2\u00a0km\n2\n per month. This desertification increased at a rate of 0.5% per year until 2008, when 1\u2009200\u00a0km\n2\n of previously arable land had been rendered incapable of bearing healthy vegetation. In response, the government of Arizona considered this phenomenon an ecological disaster and enacted plans to reverse the spread of desertification. This occurred as a response to mass protests by members of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in the neighbouring Tucson region beginning in November 2006.\n\n\nIn August 2008, 60% of desiccated topsoil per square metre began transformation into water by an unknown anomalous effect. At present, 45% of the previously desertified area has transformed into wetlands, preventing any native animal or human development in this territory.\n\n\n\n\nFURTHER ACTIONS TAKEN:\n \nSCP-4463's file was updated to contain heavy grammatical errors and significant inconsistencies among related effects of the anomaly\n. Various fabricated addenda and an unrelated image depicting a large ocean wave were also added.\n\n\n\n\nRESULT:\n SCP-4463 was erased from all Foundation databases within a 28-hour period. After further research and observation into the former location of SCP-4463, its risk had been nullified, and the area again became desertified.\n\n\n\n\nAfter continued debate and experimentation involving 19 different anomalies, SCP-3309 has passed the second stage of voting within the Ethics Committee special tribunal. SCP-3309 has been additionally classified as Thaumiel and authorized for use in TAPERED SPEAR. The first round of post-reclassification research involving 49 anomalies is under way.\n\n\n\n\nRESEARCHER NOTE\n\n\n\n\nI don't understand how one round of testing could burden a man like this. I think I saw my first white hair this morning \u2014 or an entire patch of white hairs?\n\n\nFading to dust \u2014 how does that feel? Would it burden my senses the way an illness might? Or might it leave me numb? I think, if I had to go out, I would want to continue feeling, even into my final moment. To know I'm still here, as everything else fades away.\n\n\nThere's something wrong.\n\n\nI've locked myself in my office. I'm going numb. This isn't what I would have wanted. But the end doesn't much care about one man's wants and needs, does it? There is nothing, nothing.\n\n\nDid we ever find out where those neutralized anomalies went? Surely it can't be so straightforward, to do what we did \u2014 to see \njustice\n without repercussions. That's unlike us. But it feels like everyone, everyone except me, forgot what happened.\n\n\nIs it that simple? Have we simply \nforgotten\n?\n\n\nI don't want to be \nforgotten\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014Researcher Adamo Smalls\n\n\nMemetics and Infohazards Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIII.

He no longer appears on any of our itineraries, and his name has been expunged from my project files. If there has been an immediate project alteration or a change in schedules that I was not informed of, please let me know \nimmediately\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014Researcher John Calzaroli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn, are you all right? Yes, there was indeed a 3-hour schedule change, but no \u201cResearcher Smalls\u201d has ever been involved with this project. I can assure you \u2014 \nno one\n named Researcher Smalls has worked with us.\n\n\nPlease, John, take a break; the stress must be getting to you. I know that testing has been \ncutthroat\n these past few weeks. I feel it, too.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014Dr. Robert Woods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're mistaken. You \nmust\n know the man. He's the most exceptional memeticist we have.\n\n\nBut, if you truly claim there is no Researcher Smalls, well, there must be something more to this. SCP-3309 erases anomalies and the files associated with them. We haven't discussed where exactly these anomalies \ngo\n, and I'm sure we've all had our questions.
