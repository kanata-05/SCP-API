At all times, at least one Foundation agent is to wait at the baggage claim in Newark Liberty International Airport. Whenever SCP-6902 appears in this baggage claim, said agent is to take it to a secluded location until it dematerializes. In the event that an unknown party claims SCP-6902, the identity of said party is to be determined as soon as possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6902 is a red rolling suitcase that lacks any form of branding or iconography. Approximately every six hours, SCP-6902 will dematerialize from its current location and rematerialize within a baggage claim carousel at Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\n\nUpon discovery, SCP-6902 had a baggage tag identifying it as belonging to flight 1814 from PHX\n1\n to EWR\n2\n, on January 12th 2004. Notably, this flight crashed due to a mechanical failure, killing all passengers on board. This baggage tag has since been removed.\n\n\nAs SCP-6902 dematerializes, all items within it will become an SCP-6902-1 instance. Whenever SCP-6902 materializes, all SCP-6902-1 instances will materialize within it as well.\n\n\nThe following list comprises all SCP-6902-1 instances:\n\n\n\n\nFive long sleeved dress shirts;\n\n\nA pair of dress shoes;\n\n\nThree neckties;\n\n\nSeven pairs of underwear;\n\n\nFour pairs of dress socks;\n\n\nA pair of sunglasses;\n\n\nA black leather belt;\n\n\nA disposable camera;\n\n\nA toiletries kit;\n\n\nAn empty leather folder;\n\n\nA gift bag containing a stuffed bear.\n\n\n\n\nThe following message is embroidered on the inside of SCP-6902 itself. \"For Jason. You won't lose this one.\"\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. IATA airport code for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport\n\n\n2\n.
