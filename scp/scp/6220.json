the full size of SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's containment unit is approximately 2km\n2\n, both entities are encouraged to reside within containment area 1A's greenhouse, for ease of communication. Under no circumstances should any flora, funga or fauna be removed from containment area 1A, without explicit permission from either SCP-6220-A or SCP-6220-B. Immediate disciplinary action, the outcomes of which can include job termination, will be taken upon any personnel found to violate this order.\n\n\nDuring working hours\n1\n, Dr Keitin\n2\n is expected to supervise both entities from within their cell, acting as a liaison to between SCP-6220 and Foundation personnel. Any requests either entity make in regards to supplies, or aid needed for their 'garden', should be fulfilled by Dr Keitin. In circumstances where a request cannot be immediately granted, SCP-6220's research department\n3\n should be contacted to discuss further details.\n\n\nRegardless of clearance level, all staff who wish to access SCP-6220's containment unit must consult Dr Keitin beforehand, and should expect to wait up to 1 week before access is either denied or granted. Personnel should not speak directly with either SCP-6220-A or SCP-6220-B, neither entity will engage in communications if Dr Keitin is not present to mediate the discussion.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that, while Dr Keitin is granted the position of co-head, he is not permitted to make decisions in regards to extraneous resource allocation to SCP-6220, nor security measures, without the primary head's approval.\n \nInformation out of date\n; from 10/03/2017, Dr Keitin will be deemed the sole head over SCP-6220's continued research. Resource allocation will be monitored, and thusly maintained, by the Entomological department's administrative head, in addition to the security team. Should indications of SCP-6220-A or SCP-6220-B's influence over Dr Keitin's behaviour become apparent, Dr Myceil is to overtake Dr Keitin's position immediately.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6220 is the collective designation between two deities, one which claims dominion over all \nFunga\n4\n, and the other \nInsecta\n5\n organisms, referred to as SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B respectively. Both entities claim they are in the process of creating their own 'garden', which has been documented to function identically to natural ecosystems. The largest difference, being all life forms present have been created exclusively by SCP-6220-A or SCP-6220-B.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6220-A is solely comprised of fungal matter. Aside from its head and upper limbs closely resembling human anatomy, its form below the upper torso is an amalgam of different fungal species, which have grown together to form a cloak over its lower extremities. It is currently unknown whether or not the 'cloak' is a part of SCP-6220-A, or if it's only used as a form of clothing. SCP-6220-A is believed to physically attach itself to all mycelium networks it creates, allowing it to use them as a nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6220-B does not have a fixed form, and is known to regularly change its physical attributes. However, it will most commonly take on a humanoid-Esque appearance in the presence of humans, often partially comprised of anatomy consistent with multiple insects, it most commonly manifests with beetle-like appendages.\n\n\n\n\nWhile both entities are capable of heavily distorting reality, in addition to designing and creating life forms falling under their respective dominions,\n6\n it is not currently known if either entity is capable of creating beings, that fall outside of their alleged dominions.\n\n\nDiscovery 6220:\n SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's 'garden' was first discovered after embedded officers near Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, Tasmania, reported a roughly 500m\n2\n area, harbouring unidentifiable funga and flora.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 15/2/2000, 08:54\n\n\nPERSONNEL:\n Dr Anne Tina, Dr Leroy Keitin\n\n\nNOTE:\n At this time, personnel were not aware of SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B. The following log has been included for records keeping, after Ecological personnel encountered both entities, while documenting the area for an official classification.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n C'mon, let's get a move on. I want to finish this in time for a second breakfast at that cafe.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Oh, we're not taking samples yet?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Nope. We can leave that for the return trip.\n\n\n[Words are not exchanged for the next 10 minutes, both personnel traverse the area.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Awfully quiet over there, eh?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Huh?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin crouches down.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Where?\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina is heard chuckling.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n I see that got you talking.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin stands up.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Oh! Uh, I've just been focused on taking the notes and all. Are we supposed to be talking? It's not getting in the way of the recording, is it- Oh wait, is it?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n This recording is just a safety measure should anything happen while we're out here in the field. I wouldn't worry too much about it.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Huh\u2026 So, could I ask about the application then? I know it's like the 50th time and all, I just, want to know what to expect.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Well, don't expect much. Entomology is already a niche anyways. So unless you got somethin' big on the line, chances are, you're not getting any bites.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Well errm\u2026 How does one get \"somthin' big\" on the line?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Leroy, believe me, you don't want something big. There's a damn good reason we're starting you at a low-risk anomaly. Keep a level head, and you'll be tackling the bigger and better things in no time.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin nods.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n You ought to relax a bit more too. Helps get the work done quicker. And speaking of work, it's about time we get to it.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Command, Foliage nearing SCP-6220's centre is appearing denser. A pathway leading to an open stone pavilion is-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n \n[distantly]\n I would disagree on utilising our subjects for such purposes. Leave our defences to my non-sentient creations. It'll save your denizens from the pain. Speaking of which, \nthis\n should do nicely, it will stay in this state year-round too.\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina halts and holds an arm out towards Dr Keitin. She non-verbally shushes him and they move closer to SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Command, two sapient entities are present. Appearing non-hostile. How do we proceed?\n\n\nCommand:\n \n[inaudible]\n\u2026 Approach with extreme caution, wait at your location until further notice.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n They're not even your subjects, and yet you've grown attached already? I must say, this bodes well for our union. Though I would prefer we don't rush our practice, at least finish our palace first, our creations will do much better with\u2026 Warmer conditions to grow in.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I would agree. However, I must not understate the urgency of our matters, much longer, and such filthy creatures as-\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina takes another step forward, standing over a network of mycelia, which appears to gain the attention of SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Well. Seeing as such creatures now deem it acceptable to trample my form, I believe my concerns have been realised.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A turns to look directly at Dr Anne Tina and Dr Keitin.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Show yourselves!\n\n\n[Both Dr Tina and Dr Keitin slowly try to back away, though notice their previous passage has been blocked by a wall of thorns. Both personnel slowly make their way to the path. While Dr Anne Tina kneels down, Dr Keitin remains standing.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I do not recall you being granted permission to stand.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n My apologies. My associate will not commit this act again.\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina quickly grabs Dr Keitin's hair, and pulls him down.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n \n[whispers]\n Listen to me carefully, \ndo not engage with them\n. Look straight at the ground, and stay that way. Understood?\n\n\n[Keitin nods, and quickly looks to the ground]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n I must thank you for your hospitality, neither I nor my associate meant to intrude on your province.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n If it were not your intention to intrude, then may I ask, why you are here?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n We were sent to document your\u2026 creations. My organisation was not aware of your involvement. But, if permissible, may I ask why you are here?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A tilts its head to the left, appearing to squint at Dr Anne Tina]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n These lands are not to my or my dear partner's liking, it does not reflect our standards. Through our union, we've decided we wish to create an adequate world we can rule\u2026 Together.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n So, your intentions are to convert the earth's surface to your standards?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n It is not our intention to encroach on other deities' work.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n I'm afraid I don't understand. Your plan is to convert a small area to your standards?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We would not refer to our area as small. Furthermore, we will not be persuaded into such predatory dealings your organisation is known for.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Dealings? May you specif-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We are well aware you are affiliated with the Foundation. We will not be entertaining your poorly masqueraded intentions to sanction our kingdom.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin momentarily looks up, and makes eye contact with SCP-6220-B. After noticing him quickly putting his head back down, SCP-6220-B begins to walk toward him. It stops between him and Dr Anne Tina.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Oh, of course! We would not propose you must downsize! I'm just trying to understand your desires-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Pardon my intrusion, I haven't yet heard your 'associate' speak. Does it even have a name?\n\n\n[All parties remain silent for approximately 1 minute. SCP-6220-B looks towards Dr Keitin expectantly]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Are you incapable of such a simple task, or are you willfully ignoring an order?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin mouths \"what do I do\" to Anne, who mouths back \"wait\".]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n My patience is wearing\u2026 Awfully thin.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin looks to Dr Anne Tina, who mouths \"\nwait\n\". SCP-6220-B goes to speak again, though is cut off.]\n\n\nDr Ann Tina:\n I wish to apologise, my associate is not capable of speaking.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B squints at Dr Anne Tina, before redirecting its attention to Dr Keitin.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Is this true? Can you not speak?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \u2026Perhaps you would require an incentive?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B goes to kick Dr Keitin, stopping before impacting him. It does not receive a response. It then picks a thorn, cutting his forearm lightly, upon still not receiving a response, it stands.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n What \nis\n your name? I expect it \nnow\n.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin remains silent. He looks up to SCP-6220-B, they stare at each other for 1 minute.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I've seen enough, that will be all\u2026\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B walks back towards the pavilion]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Very well, now that you are aware of our intentions, you both may leave.\n\n\n[In the moments following, a group of armoured insects, closely resembling pill bugs, surrounded both Personnel and ushered them outside of SCP-6220's area. Quickly disbanding at the edge of the 'border'.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n \n[whispers]\n Keitin. Keitin? Are you ok? Look, that was \nnot\n, in any way shape or form meant to happen the way it did.\n\n\nDr keitin:\n \n[whispsers]\n is \nthat\n what you mean by bigger and better? I think I handled that pretty ok ehh\u2026 What's a name?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n \n[sighs]\n I can't stress this enough. If you ever encounter an entity like that again, you \nmust\n continually ask for someone who knows what they're doing.\n\n\nDr keitin:\n \n[whispers]\n You got away scot-free? Is my name that fucking bad?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n They were testing you. The fact you're not seeing that is why it's so dangerous. If a small cut means they'll stop bothering you, \nthen take it.\n\n\n[Anne holds her earpiece.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Command? Prepare a biohazardous quarantine chamber for the both of us. We're on our way back.\n\n\n[Anne takes a deep breath and looks at Keitin]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Come on. It's out of our hands now, we're going to be fine.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n Both personnel have been transferred to a temporarily installed quarantine outpost, established in close proximity to SCP-6220's encampment (hereby referred to as Site-95-OP). They will remain in quarantine for a period of 1.5 weeks.\n\n\nWithin the following two hours from this recording, a dense 15m wall of thorns was grown, assumably by both entities, to mark a perimeter. Further efforts to communicate will be underway soon.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6220-01:\n With the difficulty expedition teams have in re-entering SCP-6220's area, in addition to SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's temperments and high likelihood at which a violent conflict can be avoided, through communication. Further expeditions, or otherwise invasive methods of containment, will be postponed to first attempt to contain entities peacefully.\n\n\nProceeding this decision, Dr Corey, the containment team's head, wrote a letter addressed to both entities. The contents outlined a meeting place and time, topics that would be discussed, in addition to the possible requests or accommodations the containment team could provide.\n\n\nDuring attempts to deliver the letter via the use of an MTF agent specialising in diplomatic affairs, it was noted megafauna appearing anatomically similar to pill bugs (now deemed SCP-6220-1), would passively position themselves in front of personnel, presumably to block entry.\n\n\nWhile this development initially led to debate over whether or not peaceful contact was sustainable, the order to remain neutral was left in effect. The letter was then sent via attaching multiple copies to SCP-6220-1 instances. In hopes either entity would notice the letters, should instances return to their vicinity.\n\n\nAddendum 6220-1.1:\n Neither entity made an appearance on the specified date, though the proposed meeting point was noted to have a high concentration of SCP-6220-1 instances during the time the meeting was set.\n\n\nIn the days following the meeting's date, SCP-6220's area expanded by approximately 50m\n2\n, and almost perfectly covered the meeting point detailed in the letters, prompting the immediate implementation of high-grade SRA fencing\n7\n to slow further expansion.\n\n\nIn light of peaceful contact now being considered highly unlikely, it was deemed necessary for an exploration team to contact SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B directly. If applicable, it is encouraged that teams capture either one or both entities.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 24/2/2000\n\n\nPERSONNEL:\n\n\n\n\n3 MTF agents.

Rather, SCP-6220-B lifts its hand as if to both silence, and stop agents from approaching.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I must say, their incessant whining is beginning to wear on my patience.\n\n\n[In the seconds following, SCP-6220-1 instances surrounded agents.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n First, they place those unsightly sticks outside of our domain.

However, the wall of thorns abruptly stopped abruptly at the SRA fencing.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6220-02:\n Two days from the expedition, an SCP-6220-1 instance emerged from the perimeter to approach personnel. While initially thought to be an attack, the instance was found to be in possession of a letter addressed to the Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nTo Whom it may concern,\n\n\n \n\nWe have thoroughly considered your letters and would like to discuss a compromise. However, we will decide the terms, and time, at which this arrangement will take place.\n\n\n \n\nWe would \nbluntly\n humbly ask that until we have established our means of communication, you refrain from trespassing.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnkindly\n Kindest regards,\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, additional expeditions will be put on hold, as to encourage a peaceful outcome.\n\n\nAddendum 6220-2.2:\n SCP-6220-1 instances have been noted to start traversing around Site-95-OP's preliminary buildings, in the days following SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's letter. the purpose of this behaviour is not currently known.\n\n\nWhile debates surrounding whether or not standard protocols surrounding free-roaming should be implemented in this case, the decision to keep instances from walking amongst the establishments were maintained. Being put into effect immediately, Site security have erected a buffer zone between SCP-6220's perimeter Site-95-OP's buildings. Instances, thus far remaining passive, attempting to cross the buffer would be physically deterred via the use of a cow prod.\n\n\nAddendum 6220-03:\n A coordinated security breach on the Site-95-OP's quarantine sector was enacted by SCP-6220-B. The target of which was Dr Keitin, who was isolated and subsequently rushed beyond the perimeter, before on-site security could interfere.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 27/02/2000\n\n\nNOTE:\n The incident was recorded by on-site CCTV, and has been logged for records keeping.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n03:18:\n \n[SCP-6220-B emerges from the perimeter, taking the form of an SCP-6220-1 instance.

It is noted security initially missed SCP-6220-B when attempting to re-direct Instances.]\n\n\n03:24:\n \n[SCP-6220-B enters the quarantine sector, beginning to survey the establishments. It then finds Dr Keitin's room, positions itself nearby, and waits for approximately two minutes.]\n\n\n03:26:\n \n[SCP-6220-B heads towards Dr Keitins window, and hardily nudges the wall, causing the room to shake slightly. Dr Keitin is seen waking up in moments following, he takes notice of SCP-6220-B, though assumes it is an SCP-6220-1 instance.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n What on- oh that was\u2026 You? Right\u2026\n\n\n03:39:\n \n[Dr Keitin begins to walk to towards the cells radio, presumably to report the instance.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Is that perhaps\u2026 Speaking? I hear. I must say, your initial resolve had me convinced you could not engage in such a simple task. My partner, however, tends to have an eye for seeing through such performative measures.\n\n\n03:41:\n \n[Dr Keitin jumps at hearing SCP-6220-B's voice. He turns to face it, covering his mouth with his hands. SCP-6220-B then takes its previous form, unhinges the window, and steps into the room. Dr Keitin ignores SCP-6220-B and continues toward the radio. SCP-6220-B appears offended at his refusal to address it.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I must ask, do you enjoy\u2026 Perhaps, appreciate? such a mundane function as breathing?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin pauses momentarily, though doesn't acknowledge SCP-6220-B. He continues to step toward the radio.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Clearly you mustn't?! Considering your continued insolence.\n\n\n03:43:\n \n[SCP-6220-B quickly steps forward, blocking the radio. It takes hold of Dr Keitin's wrist and pulls him toward the window. It then positions one of its particularly sharp tarsi\n8\n over his chest. During this, Dr Keitin was noted to remain silent.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I do not wish to get your filthy blood on such a regal being as myself. Though given such blatant disrespect, I find myself quite tempted.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B, upon not hearing a response, begins to press its tarsi into his chest. Despite not vocalising, Dr Keitin is visibly starting to sob.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n However\u2026 You needn't cry over such a worthy punishment\u2026 As the gracious being I am, might, perhaps, present you with a single opportunity to redeem yourself. Understood?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin hesitantly nods, starring at SCP-6220-B's tarsi.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \nSay\n it.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I\u2026 Understand. But I- I want to talk with command-\n\n\n[SCP-6220 releases Dr Keitin.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Very well. We invite you, singularly, to negotiate \"containment\" terms. As you low beings seem to call them. If \nyou\n refuse us, your organisation will'nt be given the opportunity to speak with us \nagain\n.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I want to talk with command first-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Are these terms acceptable. Or not?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I want to talk with-\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B's eyes narrow. It raises one of its tarsus, emphasising the claw.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I'm starting to think you did not deserve your opportunity\u2026 Do go on though, I must insist you say that word again\u2026 \"Command\" was it?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I\u2026 Agree.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A most splendid of choices! It is of utmost importance we leave to discuss our terms \nnow\n.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I need to get the radio. I want to talk with Dr Corey.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You will not be allowed outside input during our negotiations. Do come along now.\n\n\n03:49:\n \n[SCP-6220-B dismissively reaches to grab Dr Keitin's wrist. He recoils and backs away.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Wait! Uhh, I need to get the\u2026 Terms\u2026 From Dr Corey! I can't speak unless I know-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We have many copies of such \"terms\" already. Your letters' \"terms\", were utterly infuriating to read, we can discuss that during our meeting.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n No, I have to talk with Corey. I agreed-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You most certainly did agree, of your own free will might I add. You will uphold \nwhat\n you agreed to.\n\n\n03:53:\n \n[SCP-6220-B sharply grabs Dr Keitin's arm, and forcefully drags him outside. Dr Keitin begins to scream, alerting on-site security, who raises the on-Site alarm. SCP-6220-B sprints back towards the perimeter, with Dr Keitin in tow, crossing before on-Site security could intervene.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Following this recording, all previously roaming SCP-6220-1 instances made their way back to the perimeter.

Overlooking the greenhouse's central room.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n \n[sighs]\n Now, I believe my partner has already discussed why you're here.

Though first, \nyour name\n.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Uh, name?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You have failed to adequately disclose it, this will be the final time I ask politely.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Keitin.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n At last!

Now we have such a formality out of the way\u2026 Do state what your organisation will provide for us.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I\u2026 Don't really know what they can do.

On what terms would we be relocating?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Uhh, well, the letter-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We would best hope, you are not about to parrot the obscenities written on that most terrible paper.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n No, no!

On what terms are you proposing we relocate?\n\n\nKeitin:\n We Could Give you triple the size\u2026 Of your current area? I'm sure you could grow your garden there too?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B turn to look at each other.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Triple our initial plans. For the small price of re-locating?! I must say, your decision to wait out these\u2026 Rapscallions, has been quite fruitful.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I would agree. Hopefully, this would quell your doubts that he was indeed the correct choice to aid our interests?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B turn to look back at Dr Keitin.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We find these terms quite favourable. You have proposed a most excellent of comprises!\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n And err\u2026 Maybe I could perhaps try to get you extra resources for your garden\u2026 Like\u2026 uhh maybe you'd want some help with getting everything in order.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin Turns to face SCP-6220-B.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Like- like your insects? Right?! Wouldn't you like a group to help with uhh\u2026 Your creations?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A most thoughtful of offers, I would certainly appreciate such a kind gesture from your organisation, as to aid our lovely home. A most excellent idea!\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I'd just need to get to command to err\u2026 Verify everything. I'm uhh, not allowed to make the decision without err\u2026 Corey to also agree- which I'm sure he will, I uhh, just need to talk to him.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Do tell me, how can you assure us these terms will be fulfilled to a satisfactory degree?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin remains silent for approximately 1.5 minutes, both entities look to him expectantly.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I don't know how I can assure that\u2026 I'd need to talk to Dr Corey-\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A's eye's narrow.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I\u2026 Maybe we could all go? They'd be able to set this up on the spot! They wouldn't ask any questions of course.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n You are aware of your organisation's, tactics, On beings such as my partner and I, correct?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Certainly! But I promise I have your best inter-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I have half a mind you may be one such tactic, you propose a most pleasing of offers. Then try strong-arm us into allowing you to consult with your superiors\u2026 To, I'll assume, draw us out?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n No! No! Of course not, I -I can agree on their behalf! I just need to talk with them to\u2026 Uhh, approve it. Maybe I could just go alone, and you'll be here safe and sound?!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n And yet, you seem incapable of coming to an assured agreement without their input. I simply cannot trust in good faith you will represent us impartially.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n O- oh well we have our agreement already right?! I just need to enact the procedures that's all!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Does that not contradict what you \njust\n said? If I'm recalling correctly, you needed them to verify these terms. You then \nneeded\n them to help set the terms, and now you seem capable of outright enacting our demands? It seems we \nrequire\n, this \"command\" to move forward, now doesn't it?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n That- err\u2026 Is very correct! I just need to talk with them yes! I'll uhh, just go now, right?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We cannot trust you will be impartial. How do we know your attempts to speak with them are in good faith?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B stares at an SCP-6220-1 instance, dramatically appearing to contemplate. It then turns to SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Darling, perhaps if he could make a commitment of sorts, to us. We could settle this most tragic of stalemates?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n A splendid idea darling! Keitin, we would like you to pledge yourself \nto us\n. If we are to allow you to converse with this \"command\".\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n W-well yeah, but I- I can just do that without-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We do not trust a lowly creature, representing such a shady organisation, to represent us in an impartial light. Though, if you perhaps had our likeness, a true indicator of our interests, we could be more trusting.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Your words will implicate \nyou\n as much as they implicate \nus\n. An equal, fair, method going about our negotiations. Would you not agree?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I agree! Of course!\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n And if you agree, would this not be a most simple of decisions?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Uhh\u2026 M- maybe?\n\n\n[Dr keitin starts to back toward the entrance, though is blocked by SCP-6220-1 instances.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You will not leave this room until you have made a decision, your organisation's antics are ending \nhere\n. Are you taking a most gracious of offers? such a kind being as myself has allowed. Or will you be leaving?!\n\n\n[Dr Keitin begins to try pushing past the SCP-6220-1 instances.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Of course, I might add the latter choice does let your organisation down, doesn't it? Their only chance to speak with us would be squandered by \nyou\n. Do pick wisely\u2026\n\n\nDr Keition:\n I- don't know.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Then find out.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n M- maybe I could just go outside to think? I- uhh, need really, really need the plants to clear my head.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A gestures dramatically to the plants within the room. Dr Keitin hesitantly starts to pace around the room, he leans against the wall, eventually slumping to the ground. He remains near the entrance, and is unresponsive for the next hour.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n A- and this will make you both consider talking with command, I- I it'll mean I can fix this whole thing right?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Yes.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Most certainly.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin looks to his hands, which are appearing to shake.

I'd say his new form is coming along quite nicely, a truly beautiful creation darling.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Though, I do propose we allow him something dear. Even his legs are starting to buckle.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I might disagree on this occasion. We shouldn't be acknowledging such disrespectful behaviour by awarding him.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n This, does raise a good point.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin tries to speak, but is cut off by SCP-6220-B.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Not a word! I and my partner, have not 30 minutes left to enjoy the serenity.\n\n\n[Entities resume their tea session, while Dr Keitin remains at the window.

Though, do walk in future.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Of course, yep, we really should be going now right?!\n\n\n[Dr Keitin starts to speed walk outside, SCP-6220-B grabs him by his second set of arms, and walks him out of frame slowly.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n SCP-6220-A, SCP-6220-B and Dr Keitin, were recorded at the perimeter approximately fifteen minutes after entities left the frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 27/02/2000, 08:34\n\n\nNOTE:\n While standard procedure mandates unverified personnel possessing an anomaly must be apprehended, Dr Keitin was expedited from the procedure, on account that neither entity would resume negotiating without him present to mediate.\n\n\nFirst contact took place with Dr Corey, who was stationed at the edge of the buffer zone, in addition to on-site security.

C'mon look, I got them talking right. I'm going now- okay?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin takes a step towards the site. Dr Corey holds his arm out to stop him, he looks to a security member, who starts to reach towards two pairs of handcuffs.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n How very indecent of you to expect we follow\u2026 Such a tactless command. We follow our terms as detailed in our letter. We remain completely neutral. Yet\u2026 You thieves decide to capture \nour\n convoy to repay our patience?\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I understand your frustrations, however, we can't compromise our operation as its risks everyone's safety. Could I take some requests to make you both feel more comfortable during our interview?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n \nNo\n. You disrespected the terms we outlined. We will not be corresponding further. To think, dear, we had such a lovely arrangement planned with Keitin.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A tragedy indeed. May we discuss our losses over tea? Our failed dealings have made me\u2026 Tempted, to expand further.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n This sounds quite pleasant. Keitin, you may return to \nus\n now. We have further work for you.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin appears indecisive. He looks to the security guard, now having the cuffs open, and beginning to step towards him. Dr Keitin obstructs his arms from the guard, and starts to slowly step towards the perimeter.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n \n[whispers]\n Corey\u2026 Corey, what are you doing!? I- I want to go home, please- I'm not one of them. I- I'm not supposed to be in a cell.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Keitin, please do not resist. Remain where you are. You'll be transferred-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I beg your pardon?! What preposterous order did you just bestow upon our subject?\n\n\n[Dr Corey goes to respond, but is abruptly cut off after SCP-6220-B walks over the perimeter. It waves its hand down aggressively, resulting in upwards of 200 SCP-6220-1 instances charging personnel. While instances stopped before impacting personnel, they were noted not to be affected by physical deterrence, such as bullets. During this event, Dr Corey was noted to stand in place.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Let this be a warning. Should you set foot in our province, attempt to push back our fairly discussed expansions\u2026 Or heavens forbid, \ndare\n order around my loyal subject again, and your kind will face severe punishment.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n With due respect, we have put measures in place to prevent further 'expansion'. You may have noticed the SRA posts. Furthermore, I may remind you this is not the first time the Foundation has-\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A steps beyond the perimeter.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n With due respect?! Such a disingenuous term to be used in this context! Your kind only seems to \"respect\", our work when it benefits \nyou\n. You would feel such an entitlement that dare opposes two, most benign deities, to create a most lovely home through their union?! Perhaps we shall deny \nyou\n the right to a home.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Could you elaborate, please?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We needn't remind you that you're, quite literally, \nstanding\n on our work. Your home is quiet\u2026 Reliant, on our continued support after all. It sure would be a shame if our support were too\u2026 Diminish, now wouldn't it?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Darling, perhaps we should enact punishment? This creature's \"respect\", has at last broken my resolve to care about its kind.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B raises its hand lightly. In the seconds following, all insects from the surrounding area are seen moving towards the perimeter, in addition to surrounding SCP-6220-B.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n My, unappreciated, work will not remain in such a terrible organisation's presence\u2026 I must say, perhaps my creations will remain safer, if I simply called \nall\n of my dear children back to me?\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Are\u2026 Are you threatening to remove all insects from the world's ecosystem?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We do not wish our work around your organisation any longer\u2026 You should not wish to find out how much our favour will Diminish, if you dare speak with us again. Furthermore, is that in all honesty what those sticks were for? a fence?!\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A raises its hand lightly, subsequently causing the SRA fencing to overgrow with SCP-6220-A's created flora, in addition, the perimeter wall expands approximately 4 meters over the SRA fence.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Much better.\n\n\n[Dr Corey Radio's into command, while SCP-6220-B waves SCP-6220-1 instances to collect Dr Keitin. Site security attempts to approach Dr Keitin, though he begins to back towards the instances.]\n\n\nDr Corey:\n \n[covers the radios mic with his hand]\n Keitin! Keitin! What what did they \"agree\" on with you?!\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n They uhh\u2026 Triple their area!\n\n\nCommand:\n \nGrant it\n. Keep them talking.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n SCP-6220-A, SCP-6220-B! May you hear a final offer?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B waves the SCP-6220-1 instances away from Keitin.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Make your utter insult of a compromise quick.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n We would be willing to compromise on the spot, with the terms agreed upon by Dr Keitin. You will have triple the size of your current area. If you have any additional term-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n For the utter lack of regard you have displayed, we will not settle for \nanything\n under four times our current area. In addition, we have further demands that we expect will not be withheld.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I can assure you, we can accommodate the area requirements. Though, I'm not yet aware of what your other needs are. Would you be open to discussing this further?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B turns to SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I would be so inclined as to give them a final chance?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I must agree.\n\n\n[Entities turn to face Dr Corey.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We are expecting, this time around, that our subject remains with \nus\n, for discussions?\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Of course. May I ask we perhaps\u2026 Move to you into a holding area for further discussion, it will be right next door to your full area.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n \n[whispers]\n Core- Corey? What are you doing?! I- I'm supposed to leave now? Right?!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n This sounds, most intriguing. Keitin, we expect you will first follow this\u2026 Creature, to scout our new location.\n\n\n[Dr Corey waves for site security to stand down. He gestures Dr Keitin to follow him towards an ATU\n9\n.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n \n[whsipers]\n Corey\u2026 \nCorey\n\u2026 Please, say something? Come on- please, I- I didn't mean to run away- just give me another chance.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B tentatively begin to follow Dr Corey and Dr Keitin, maintaining their distance. After nearing the ATU Both entities abrutly stopped following Dr Corey, appearing displeased. they wave Dr Keitin to approach them.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Would he believe we are so ignorant, as to trust this is not a cage?\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n It's a- a transport Unit?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n And why might it look more like a cage, than a unit for transportation? Must such a low creature believe such beings as \nus\n, are blind to such trickery?!\n\n\n[Dr Keitin looks over to Dr Corey, who mouths \"to protect you\".]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n It has to be reinforced to\u2026 Uhh- to keep you protected?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A's eyes narrow.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Sweep the inside of this\u2026 Box. We will not enter otherwise.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin walks through the transport unit and gives an all-clear, after walking back outside. Both entities walk in tentatively, seating themselves close to the gate.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Keitin, what is keeping you? We are expecting you to join us now. We mustn't dally after all.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Oh, I think I'd better be going with Dr Corey.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n You will remain with \nus\n for this excursion. Now, do take a seat.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A points to a spot between it, and SCP-6220-B.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n What about uhh, s-seat belts? I- uh, I really need to go with Corey anyway, it's very important\u2026 Right, Corey? Right?!\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I think you'd best stay with them.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B stands and approaches Dr Keitin. It grabs his wrist and drags him into the unit, after sitting next to him, it then grabs his arm.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A simple solution to your concerns. I would expect you to trust \nmy\n holding you upright, will suffice?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin nods slowly.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n May we visit our new area now?\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Of course. We should arrive in about 15 minutes.\n\n\n[For the next 20 minutes, SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B discussed a range of topics, while Dr Keitin remained silent. Upon the transport unit being stationed in a secure location within Site-95, Dr Corey returned to the unit and unlocked the gate. SCP-6220-A exits first.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Our journey here took longer than you initially proposed. Much longer and I would've feared you\u2026 Creatures, had attempted an abduction.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n We had some difficulty selecting a safe area for your exit.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B walks out of the unit, still holding Dr Keitins arm, and looks to SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Forget the timing, dear, I'm sure he can adequately deliver us to our area.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Your cell is down the hall from here, we can discuss any further needs when we arrive.\n\n\n[Keitin, abruptly pulls his arm from SCP-6220-B's grasp, and hurriedly makes his way towards Dr Corey.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Are you deaf to simple instructions?! \nWalk\n.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I- Just thinking ahead. Uh- you want me to scout the area? R-right?!\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I must say, darling, it is quite endearing he's so eager.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A promising sight indeed, though you needn't go ahead here. Return to me now.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n You're sure? I err\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \nNow\n.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin looks to Dr Corey and mouths \"help\". After no response is given, Dr Keitin hesitantly walks back towards SCP-6220-B. All entities follow Dr Corey to the cell.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n This is not acceptable.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n This room is barer than the insufferably minimal interior I came across my subject in. You expect we wait \nhere\n?! I'm beginning to think this may be another trick\u2026\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I must apologise for the inconvenience, part of the reason I wished to bring you here is to discuss your Preferences. My teams were not sure how to best prepare this holding cell for you.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Your meaning to tell us you had such forethought, as to request our very input on how to best prepare our cell? This certainly is an accommodating response.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Dear, I would not be so fast as to trust such shady beings. I'm not entirely sold this a genuine kindness. Keitin, verify this room is not trapped, such a trustworthy source as yourself is required.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin slowly begins to walk through the room's door, and starts to walk the perimeter. Both entities, followed by Dr Corey, start to enter after approximately 2 minutes. They examine the walls.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n When shall you expect we satiate our requirements with this room?\n\n\nDr Corey:\n You may do so now, so long as it won't interrupt the Sites ability to properly function. Though I would much prefer we discuss any further needs you have first.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Keitin, come here.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin begins to slowly walk towards SCP-6220-A, it crouches to his level.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n \n[whispers]\n I would like a watering system \n[inaudible]\n Perhaps a natural light source too? I cannot be expected to \n[inaudible]\n sunlight.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n We can of course implement a watering system. Sunlight will be a difficult request to fulfil, but it can be granted-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n In future, address our subject when answering questions. That is why he is here.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n On that thought. Keitin do tell this creature of your most thoughtful of ideas.\n\n\n[Dr keitin remains silent for approximately 1 minute.]\n\n\nKeitin:\n I- they, want a group to aid their garden. They want Entomologists, uh- Botanists, and mycologists.\n\n\n[Dr Corey looks to Dr Keitin.]\n\n\nDr Corey:\n That could take some time to prepare. Though, I can disclose Dr Keitin specialises in Entomological studies-\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B looks to Dr Keitin, appearing pleased.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n A most wonderful turn of events! You alone will not suffice of course. However, I find I am immensely pleased by your involvement in such a prestigious study.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n It is certainly good to hear this. Though, I do want to push the topic of Dr Keitin further.\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina comes into frame, escorted by four security members. Dr Keitin quietly starts to make his way towards her.]\n\n\nDr Corey:\n Ahh, good timing! This is Dr Anne Tina, she specialises in Botany and takes a secondary specialisation in Entomological studies. I've brought her to help with containment measures.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n We do remember this, thing, yes.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We are not keen on its presence. We feel it is a bad influence on our subject.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B notices Dr Keitin attempting to approach Dr Anne Tina.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Keitin. whatever might you be doing over there? Return to my side.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin turns to face SCP-6220-B, he remains in place. After a minute of silence, he turns around and begins to sprint towards Dr Anne Tina.]\n\n\nKeitin:\n Anne! Anne! Please, I- I need your help, I- I'm not supposed to be here! C'mon, I- I need to go home, right?!\n\n\n[Security obstructs Dr Keitin from leaving the cell, he becomes visibly distraught. Dr keitin shows security his clearance card, though upon being told it is not valid due to his anomaly, he begins to sob, attempting to push past security. He then attempts to pull his additional arms and keratin plating off his person, resulting in security restraining him.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Keitin. Keitin! Hey\u2026 Hey, I need you to calm down, listen to me!\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina shows security her clearance card, and asks they escort Dr Keitin to the adjacent room.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B\n And what might be the meaning of this?! I expect such a conniving creature to bring my subject here. How dare you attempt to fill his head with meaningless instructions yet again!\n\n\n[Dr Anne Tina goes to speak, but is cut off by SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Your instructions during our first meeting were, painfully, obvious. It made our task as to choose his aid\u2026 Difficult.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B turns its attention to Dr Keitin, who has begun to lay on the floor in the foetal position, loudly sobbing.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Must you be so fragile as to seek this \"Anne's\" aid over such a gracious being as \nI\n? Stop embarrassing yourself. I am quite bothered by your lack of loyalty to us.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I might wish to intervene here, there is a good chance Keitin is currently in shock. A very normal response to\u2026 This drastic of a change. I may propose he leave anyway while we discuss his status, it may help his nerves.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n We will allow such a kind gesture if it aids\u2026 Such a sudden affliction.\n\n\n[Dr Corey looks to Dr Anne Tina, who escorts Dr Keitin to the adjacent room. Dr Keitin is sat down at a table, Dr Anne Tina pulls a second chair to sit next to him. Dr Keitin remains unresponsive.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Hey, I\u2019m sorry Leroy\u2026 But, I \nreally\n need you to look at me now\u2026 Hey- C\u2019mon does my hair look that bad?\n\n\n[Dr Keitin's sobs begin to quieten, he looks up momentarily.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Thought that\u2019d get you. Now, I need you to listen to me-\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I- I can\u2019t, Anne- Anne, just let me go home\u2026 I- I quit! Right? Y- you can't \nmake\n me work for them!\n\n\nDr Anne Tine:\n It can't work like that anymore-\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I'll just go to containment, they- they can't -\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \n[to Dr Corey]\n \nNo\n, part of the reason we chose our subject is due to his affiliation with your organisation! How might he adequately represent us from within our cell?!\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n \n[forces a chuckle]\n Oh dear, I think Corey\u2019s starting to strike a nerve with them.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Wai- Wait, what does it mean in \nour\n cell?! It- it doesn't mean that right?\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Just breathe. Corey is not gonna put you in danger, we're getting this sorted-\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n \n[to Dr Corey]\n Such a pertinent issue of split commitments. Perhaps we allocate him the evening hours to uphold his other commitments? During the day we would like him within our immediate vicinity, we simply \nmust\n have him to cater to us.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n No\u2026 No! I'm not committed to anyone! I- I did this so I could leave! I- I quit! I quit!\n\n\nDr Anne Tinna:\n Leroy-\n\n\nDr Corey:\n \n[to SCP-6220-A]\n We could always bring you another correspondent. Perhaps allow Dr Keitin free of his commitment to you, and we can replace him with someone more qualified?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \n[to Dr Corey]\n We selected Keitin for his loyalty, he is untainted by your organisation's twisted influence. And therefore, our \nonly\n method to ensure we remain content. Even with these statements, I have grown somewhat fond of the idea he will be my subject.\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Anne- Anne!? Say something\u2026 Please- just anything! Thi- thi isn't fair.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n \n[to SCP-6220-B]\n Given the circumstances I\u2026 Can allow him under your supervision. Though I need him to have access to our resources, furthermore his work, while in your vicinity. in addition, he must be allowed to leave your cell during the evenings, maybe 6 PM? If you cannot uphold these terms, we cannot allow him to remain employed.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \n[to Dr Corey]\n A difficult compromise, though if it means he is allowed to remain as your employee, then I believe it necessary\u2026 Now, where might I find him?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B begins to walk toward the hall. Dr Keitin abruptly stands and runs for the doorway, though is blocked by security, he runs back to Dr Anne Tina.]\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n I- I have to go, p-please, just let me go. C'mon, I already quit!\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Leroy-\n\n\nDr Keitin:\n Anne. I quit! I don't work here- I don't work for them-\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Leroy, calm down. There's nothing I can do-\n\n\nDr keitin:\n No\u2026 No! This isn't fair, I- don't want to do this.\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n Please\u2026 SCP-6220-C, please remain silent.\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n W-what\u2026 I'm n-not one of them. I'm not one of them!\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n This wasn't fair, your right. But I can't do anything about that.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C abruptly stops, he looks to Dr Anne Tina and begins to back away. Dr Anne Tina stands and starts to leave.]\n\n\nDr Anne Tina:\n It goes without saying our mentorship is\u2026 Ended now.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B comes into frame and stands at the doorway. Dr Anne Tina exits the room.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Keitin, we have settled your employment. You may come with me now. We have much work to get to before this organisation will steal you away\u2026 I believe your former superior mentioned 6 PM?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n No\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n I want to- go h-home\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Must you be so ungrateful?!\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B approaches SCP-6220-C, grabs his arm and walks him back toward their cell. SCP-6220-C is told to stand next to the gate, and remains there for the next 6 hours, while both entities re-form the interior of the cell to resemble their greenhouse.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I must say. A cup of tea would be quite pleasant after all of that work.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Dear, I do believe our cups and other such ingredients, are at our previous dwelling?\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Sweety, I never forget to bring such bare resources as a tea set, ingredients of course are a simple fix.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A procures a tea set from the amalgam of fungal growths on its lower extremities. It then procures a jar of an unidentified liquid, and begins to fill the cups.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You simply know my preferences too well!\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n It's of no difficulty to remember your sweet tooth dear.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Speaking of a sweet tooth, I do believe our subject might enjoy such a blend.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B looks to SCP-6220-C, who was staring at the floor. It gestures for him to approach, though he does not respond.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You may come here now. I am quite impressed you have remained silent for once, we have a reward for such behaviour.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C does not respond. SCP-6220-B goes to address SCP-6220-C again, though is cut off by SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n May his non-response be due to his shift end? Perhaps an unforeseen requirement was he not address us when catering to his organisation?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A procures a pocket watch from its fungal amalgam.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Goodness, the time sure does fly, it is 6:05 already!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n This must explain such silence. We expect you back here by 6:00 AM tomorrow. You may leave.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C runs towards the gate, he starts to audibly sob.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Whatever is the matter? Should returning to such a shady organisation be this traumatic?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C ignores SCP-6220-A. He attempts to scan his clearance card at the reader. SCP-6220-B begins to walk toward him.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n If this might be such a terrible experience, perhaps we make arrangements to keep you here for lon-\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n \n[to cell radio]\n Corey? Corey?! I- I want to go home, please, just let me go. Come on- it's 6! They said I could go-\n\n\nDr Corey:\n \n[over radio]\n Security is going to escort you to a separate cell while your file gets processed. Until then, your clearance card will be invalid.\n\n\n[The cell gate opens. Two security personnel begin to escort SCP-6220-C to a nearby cell.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n Dear, I do believe he is in their hands now.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B walks back towards SCP-6220-A.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I would suppose so. Speaking of \"their hands\", however, I find myself quite concerned on their handling of our creations\u2026 I do believe it was\u2026 Neglected as a topic? I would see we inform our correspondent of this matter.\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n While we have him, I do suppose we shouldn't leave such grievances unaddressed. He should not be running to that organisation over \nus\n.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Well, I would like to see this dealt with now regardless. If I heard correctly he is attempting to quit.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B walks to the cell radio.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n \n[to cell radio]\n I must demand Keitin is returned to us, we have a request of utmost urgency to correspond with him on.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n \n[over radio]\n I can take your request in SCP-6220-C's stead for the time being-\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Sensitive information regarding our creations, is not to be entrusted with such thieving cretins! I am well aware you monsters would attempt to exploit and dissect our hard work. I must \ninsist\n we speak with Keitin at once.\n\n\nDr Corey:\n I can allow a short visit. He will be called back.\n\n\n[Aproximatley 5 minutes later, SCP-6220-C is returned to the cell. Security remains outside.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Thank heavens! Keitin, I must have you oversee the transportation of our creations, have the following instructions relayed to-\n\n\n[SCP-6220-A notices SCP-6220-C is beginning to quietly sob.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-A:\n I suppose, we shall address your grievances?\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Our correspondences may take, an additional few moments.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B guides SCP-6220-C to a nearby seat, it retrieves two cups from SCP-6220-A and returns.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Do inform me of your affliction.\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n My Life\u2026 Is\u2026 O-over.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n And what might you mean?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n What\u2026 What do think I mean?

You have your employmen-\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n I don't \nwant\n my employment! The only fucking reason I'm here is that you fucking threatened to kill me! I don't want this!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Such language is wholly unnecessary! Do not address me in this manner again.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C flinches. An application is visible from his left pocket.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n What might that be?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B picks up the application.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You wish to start a department, solely dedicated to such beings as myself?! Have you submitted such a document yet?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n I quit.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Was this not what \nyou\n wanted from the start? Must the only denominator in your decision be your new form?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n The \"new form\" just got me ousted by everyone\u2026 My own fucking mentor just labelled me as a monster and left\u2026 My family, my friends they're gone now\u2026 What the fuck do I have left? Nothing!\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I overheard such a conversation where you were referred to by your number, I must give my condolences. Though, I'm sure our guidance would certainly suffice as a\u2026 Replacement?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n I just want my life back\u2026 I quit. Just undo this. I'm going home.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Watch your tone\u2026 Such a form is a dear improvement from what you were. You have \nus\n now regardless.\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n Exactly\u2026 I have \nyou\n\u2026 I \ndon't\n want this. I want my life back- this- this isn't fair.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I must ask, what in heavens name was so enticing about your previous life?! What were you working towards- an organisation where you likely would've ended up dead? a romantic interest\u2026 Children?\n\n\nSCP-6220-C:\n \u2026 Free will.\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n You \ndo\n, to an extent, have such a commodity under us\u2026 You are our first sapient subject, to inhabit what will be such a lovely kingdom after all. Was it not your organisation that has placed restrictions on you? This organisation that is apparently disallowing you to leave? How quickly did they turn on you after the pressure got to them?\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B gives the application back to SCP-6220. It then hands him a cup of tea.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n I must insist you pursue such an endeavour, we will personally ensure you are given\u2026 An adequate position, to help you win back your independence from such an organisation. Now, do drink your tea, it's quite sweet, though I'm sure you'll take a liking to it.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-C hesitantly starts to examine his mandibles. He looks to the cup.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n Do expect them to clamp when you try to eat\u2026 Though, your cup will not break.\n\n\n[Dr Keitin slowly lifts the cup to his mouth and begins to drink, his mandibles clamp over the cup. SCP-6220-B appears amused at SCP-6220-C's attempts to pull the cup from his mandibles after finishing.]\n\n\nSCP-6220-B:\n While we are on the topic of tea. I have further requests, that I require you see are handled. \nOur\n kingdom, Keitin, will not be undermined.\n\n\n[SCP-6220-B begins to whisper further instructions to SCP-6220-C, after Approximately 6 minutes, he exits the cell. After relaying SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's instructions to Dr Corey, SCP-6220-C is escorted back to his cell.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6220-4.0:\n On 03/03/2000, Dr Keitin formally submitted a Department application, the purposes of which surrounds Entomological studies. At this time, a Foundation-wide department is not deemed necessary, due to the necessity of Entomology as a specialisation, being in too little demand beyond Site-95. However, Site-95 has been deemed eligible to receive its own Entomological office, in addition to Mycology and Botany. As a direct result of SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's requirements to remain content within their containment.\n\n\nAddendum 6220-4.1:\n From 10/03/2000, Dr Keitin has been granted the co-head position of SCP-6220's containment department. On account, neither SCP-6220-A nor SCP-6220-B would correspond with the previous lead, without Dr Keitin to oversee or vote on affairs pertaining to their containment.\n\n\nAddendum 6220-4.3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE\n\n\n\n\nAS OF 10/03/2017, AN OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENTOMOLOGICAL STUDIES HAS BEEN DEEMED NECESSARY, ON ACCOUNT OF THE RISING DEMAND FOR TRAINED ENTOMOLOGISTS, IN ADDITION TO THE RISING NUMBER OF ANOMALIES CONCERNING INSECTS.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that, while SCP-6220's containment department will be merged Dr Keitin will not be deemed eligible for the department head, due to a possible conflict of interest. However, on account of SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's containment needs, Dr Keitin will be granted the regional head over Australia and New Zealand. So as to ensure correspondence between both entities and the Foundation remain stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. 6:00 - 18:00\n\n\n2\n.

        "Addendum 6220-01: With the difficulty expedition teams have in re-entering SCP-6220's area, in addition to SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's temperments and high likelihood at which a violent conflict can be avoided, through communication. Further expeditions, or otherwise invasive methods of containment, will be postponed to first attempt to contain entities peacefully.\nProceeding this decision, Dr Corey, the containment team's head, wrote a letter addressed to both entities. The contents outlined a meeting place and time, topics that would be discussed, in addition to the possible requests or accommodations the containment team could provide.\nDuring attempts to deliver the letter via the use of an MTF agent specialising in diplomatic affairs, it was noted megafauna appearing anatomically similar to pill bugs (now deemed SCP-6220-1), would passively position themselves in front of personnel, presumably to block entry.\nWhile this development initially led to debate over whether or not peaceful contact was sustainable, the order to remain neutral was left in effect. The letter was then sent via attaching multiple copies to SCP-6220-1 instances. In hopes either entity would notice the letters, should instances return to their vicinity.",
        "Addendum 6220-1.1: Neither entity made an appearance on the specified date, though the proposed meeting point was noted to have a high concentration of SCP-6220-1 instances during the time the meeting was set.\nIn the days following the meeting's date, SCP-6220's area expanded by approximately 50m 2 , and almost perfectly covered the meeting point detailed in the letters, prompting the immediate implementation of high-grade SRA fencing 7 to slow further expansion.\nIn light of peaceful contact now being considered highly unlikely, it was deemed necessary for an exploration team to contact SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B directly. If applicable, it is encouraged that teams capture either one or both entities.",
        "Addendum 6220-02: Two days from the expedition, an SCP-6220-1 instance emerged from the perimeter to approach personnel. While initially thought to be an attack, the instance was found to be in possession of a letter addressed to the Foundation.\nAt this time, additional expeditions will be put on hold, as to encourage a peaceful outcome.",
        "Addendum 6220-2.2: SCP-6220-1 instances have been noted to start traversing around Site-95-OP's preliminary buildings, in the days following SCP-6220-A and SCP-6220-B's letter. the purpose of this behaviour is not currently known.\nWhile debates surrounding whether or not standard protocols surrounding free-roaming should be implemented in this case, the decision to keep instances from walking amongst the establishments were maintained. Being put into effect immediately, Site security have erected a buffer zone between SCP-6220's perimeter Site-95-OP's buildings. Instances, thus far remaining passive, attempting to cross the buffer would be physically deterred via the use of a cow prod.",
        "Addendum 6220-03: A coordinated security breach on the Site-95-OP's quarantine sector was enacted by SCP-6220-B. The target of which was Dr Keitin, who was isolated and subsequently rushed beyond the perimeter, before on-site security could interfere.",
