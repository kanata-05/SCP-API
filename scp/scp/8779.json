    "all_text": "YOUR GONE TO HOLYWOOD!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+23\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SCP-8779 cartridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-8779\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n All instances of SCP-8779 are to be secured in a standard containment locker at Site-59. Any copies discovered of SCP-8779 are to be confiscated immediately or are purchased using allotted funds.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8779 is an unlicensed video game titled \"Americans Idel\" created by the Totleigh Software Corporation for the Nintendo DS. SCP-8779 is a karaoke-style game designed after the American television series \n\"American Idol.\"\n\n\nSCP-8779 comes with a game manual within its box alongside the game's cartridge. The manual consists of broken English and misspellings typical of TotleighSoft, detailing the game's basic controls and mechanics along with the following blurb:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR GONE TO HOLYWOOD!\n\n\nYouv'e seen AMERICANS IDEL. But asking, whach bout yuo? When are youre tim to shine? Shine is now! Make SIMNON COWBELL hapy ANYWERE! ANYTIME! ANYWAY! Very imersive. So SING now! Shwo HIM, what are you made off!\n\n\n\n\nUpon running an instance of SCP-8779, a catalog of song titles would appear on the lower screen of the console. This collection includes music released in the 1960s to the present day and is updated daily. While a search function is available, it is considered unreliable, as song titles are often misspelled or entirely different.\n\n\nGameplay for SCP-8779 initiates once a song is selected, prompting an instrumental track of the selected song to play. On the lower screen of the console, a pulsating microphone icon appears at the center. Lyrics to the song are shown below the icon, scrolling horizontally from right to left, these lyrics are often incorrect.\n\n\nThe upper screen of the console displays what appears to be live-action footage of Simon Cowell\n1\n, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, and a second instance of Simon Cowell\n2\n, all seated in this order. Ryan Seacrest is also shown to appear momentarily at times. The setting closely resembles a typical audition scene from the show \n\"American Idol\"\n as it aired in the early 2000s, all personalities featured in the video also reflect their appearances from that period. When asked, all individuals depicted and mentioned within the game claimed to be unaware of their involvement in its production or of any association with TotleighSoft.\n\n\nThe judges are able to interact with players in real-time, as seen when they respond to a player's actions along with their usual comments. Gameplay for SCP-8779 culminates with either a positive or negative response from the judges, with each verdict and interaction producing varying effects on human players.\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 8779-59-1:\n\n\n\n\nPlayer:\n D-36921\n\n\nSong:\n Man did ( \"Mandy\" by Barry Manilow )\n\n\nResults:\n After the first chorus, both instances of Simon raise their hands, halting the performance. Paula greets D-36921 by his real name. Simon-1 proceeds to praise D-36921's voice, Simon-2 then objects, stating: \"But Hollywood? Maybe Chicago.\" Randy boos at Simon-2's remarks. After the judges delivered their verdicts, Randy announces that D-36921 is \"gone to Hollywood.\"\n\n\nD-36921 is given three yesses by the judges and earns a golden ticket, denoting success.\n\n\nD-36921 exhibited marked elation and improvement in mood during the following weeks. The subject had also taken interest in singing and songwriting. When asked about these newfound interests, the subject consistently responded that it was in preparation for \"Hollywood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer:\n D-63457\n\n\nSong:\n Baby ( \"Baby\" by Justin Bieber )\n\n\nResults:\n After thirty-one seconds, Simon-1 begins to stifle his laughter, followed by Simon-2, then the other two judges. Ryan is briefly shown mouthing the word \"Yikes.\" The track then abruptly stops. Simon-1 mocks D-63457, saying: \"Dinner's served, and serve is shit! Hollywood? Holly-shit!\" Paula interjects and says: \"Not American!\" A close-up shot of Randy's mouth is then shown as he laughs. The judges continue to laugh and mock the subject for another minute as the subject begins to yell threats and profanities at the console. Simon-2 calls for security as the subject's outburst escalates. D-63457 then forcibly throws the console, causing it to break. Simultaneously, the subject falls to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\nThe judges are unable to give their final verdicts.\n\n\nSCP-8779 instance inside the console was retrieved after the incident without damage. D-63457 regained consciousness after five minutes, still exhibiting signs of agitation. It is noted that multiple bruises were found on the subject's head and torso. When interviewed during post-test evaluation, subject adamantly protested that he was deserving of a \"spot in Hollywood.\" The subject exhibited marked hostility and emotional volatility during the following weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer:\n D-34522\n\n\nSong:\n BOOMB ( \"Grenade\" by Bruno Mars )\n\n\nResults:\n After forty-four seconds, Simon-1 waves his hand, halting the performance. Simon-2 then insults his performance, stating: \"Who told be idol? Egad! Here I am become ridicule. Disappointment.\" Randy and Paula are shown nodding their heads. Randy then waves and says: \"No Hollywood. Sorry much.\" After the judges delivered their verdicts, Ryan is briefly shown shaking his head.\n\n\nD-36921 is given four noes by the judges, denoting failure.\n\n\nFollowing the test, subject exhibited significant restlessness and marked signs of distress. Over the subsequent weeks, the subject submitted twenty-two requests to play the game again, all of which were denied. D-34522 has been observed to loudly sing \"Grenade\" by Bruno Mars on a daily basis, interspersed with repeated pleas for a second chance at \"Hollywood\". Amnestic treatments have failed to reverse SCP-8779's effects on D-34522. Due to multiple complaints regarding this behavior, subject has been relocated to a soundproofed room. Though suffering from severe throat damage caused by consistent strenuous singing, D-34522 shows no signs of stopping this behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer:\n D-84833\n\n\nSong:\n No Nono Way ( \"Without You\" by Mariah Carey )\n\n\nResults:\n Thirty seconds into the subject's performance, the screen displays a close-up shot of Paula's eyes, visibly welling with tears. Both instances of Simon are then shown covering their faces with audible sobbing. Randy bows his head. Upon the song's conclusion, a somber background music begins to play as the judges clap in unison along with Ryan who is briefly shown. After the applause ended, Paula then wipes her tears and greets D-84833 with praise for her performance, stating: \"Very brave! Very American! Even of you are hurting muchly with cancers. So yes, praise be! Praise be! You're gone to Hollywood!\" All judges then say \"You're gone to Hollywood!\" in unison. After the judges delivered their verdicts, Ryan is briefly shown once more, clapping and weeping.\n\n\nD-84833 is given four yesses by the judges and earns a golden ticket, denoting success.\n\n\nIt is noted that subject was cleared of any abnormalities during initial screenings prior to testing. Following the test, D-84833 was examined and was found to have developed stage 3C breast cancer. The subject exhibited marked elation and improvement in mood during the following weeks and has taken interest in singing and songwriting. When informed about this diagnosis, subject dismissed the topic and stated that \"none of it mattered\" because she was \"going to Hollywood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident 8779-59-1\n\n\nOn 12/18/2024, 40 days after initial tests with SCP-8779, multiple D-class personnel were reported missing. A search was immediately initiated. Consistent between recovered belongings of all missing personnel were handwritten song compositions expressing themes of praise and adoration directed to Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, and most notably, Simon Cowell who are viewed as messianic figures. It is noted that all missing personnel received positive responses from SCP-8779 during previous tests. As of writing, their current whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
