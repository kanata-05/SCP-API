This perimeter is maintained by MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") as private property.\n\n\nOnce per day, MTF Beta-7 is to accompany Foundation technicians into Unit C to perform maintenance on 1 of the 6 incinerators. They are to follow a rotating schedule to ensure each incinerator's furnace is serviced once a week. Outside of this maintenance, every furnace is to remain lit and operational at all times. Reinforced steel hatches have been welded atop of each incinerator's 3 disposal chutes; these hatches are to remain bolted and locked.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2419-A found outside of Unit C's incinerators are to be immersed in concrete and shipped to an indefinite containment site.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2419 is a refinery and waste disposal facility located 75 kilometers north of Summer Springs, Colorado (USA). It was constructed in 1954 by the Foundation for the purposes of handling the incineration and long-term storage of hazardous wastes (primarily medical waste). A controlled evacuation was carried out in 1975 after it began to exhibit several anomalies.\n\n\nThe facility is divided into three units. Unit A was responsible for long-term storage of anomalous waste via a deep geological repository; Unit B received shipments of waste and processed them. Unit C disposed of non-anomalous waste via incineration.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2419-A present as human entities that occur within the interior of Unit C's incinerators. They exhibit anomalous regenerative abilities and are incapable of dying. Although they typically attempt to exit the incinerators via the disposal chutes, the heat from each incinerator's furnace is sufficient to stop them before they can make significant progress.\n\n\nSCP-2419-A instances do not communicate, and lack any sense of self-preservation. Although they appear to have no interest in each other, they show extreme hostility toward any sapient non-instance.\n\n\nAddendum 2419.1:\n Discovery\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/2419/incidents/001.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT LOG\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT #:\n 2419-001\n\n\nDATE OF OCCURENCE:\n 1975/05/21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly incinerated SCP-2419-A instance climbing up one of the incinerator's chutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers operating Unit C reported screams from inside of all 6 incinerators' ash-pits; after a brief investigation, the Site-Director ordered the burners on incinerator #4 snuffed.\n\n\nSeveral dozen severely burned entities immediately began to emerge from the incinerator's disposal chutes. They attempted to drag Foundation personnel back down into the ash-pit with them.\n\n\nThe Site-Director immediately ordered the on-site MTF team to terminate all hostile entities. After determining that these entities could regenerate, the Site-Director ordered the MTF team to force them back down the chutes via steam-lance. All the furnace's burners were re-lit; the #4 incinerator was put back into service without further incident.\n\n\nDuring the incident, the MTF team managed to subdue and capture five of these entities. They have been transported off-site for further study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/2419/interviews/109.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 1976/07/21\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n SCP-2419-A Instance (SCP-2419-A-5)\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Dr. Warren\n\n\nNOTE:\n On account of the hostility typically exhibited by SCP-2419-A instances, the interview was conducted behind a ventilated glass wall and with an armed guard observing.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nWARREN:\n Good morning, Number Five.\n\n\n(\nSoft ripping.\n)\n\n\nWARREN:\n You know, if you keep picking at your arm, it's never going to heal.\n\n\n(\nSoft ripping continues.\n)\n\n\nWARREN:\n We know you can speak.

Thank you for that.\n\n\nYesterday, I processed the body of D-263175. He was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. I boiled away the six hours he spent holding his sister's hand as she lay dying in a hospital bed. I boiled away the swell of pride he felt when his son took his first few steps. I boiled away all the kindness his mother ever showed him \u2014 until all that remained was her cruelty and abuse.\n\n\nI took away every moment of joy \u2014 and left behind a life of uninterrupted misery, pain, and rage.\n\n\nDo you know why the Foundation takes D-Class personnel from criminal populations, Shaun? It's because nobody stops us. \nNobody cares\n. A prison is where you put unimportant people. It's where you shave down whatever is left of their humanity until the monster you imagined them to be is all that remains. But no matter how hard we tried, there was always a sliver of decency left behind \u2014 some piece of them we couldn't quite reach.\n\n\nUntil now. We've done it. In death, D-263175 is finally the monster people imagined. I've burned away every last trace of his humanity. Now, I'm going to send his corpse to Unit C and burn away the rest.\n\n\nI pray to God that what's left \nwill\n burn.\n\n\nI can't stay. I'm sorry.

I'm getting a little tired of playing Cassandra here, but the situation doesn't look good. These things barely missed hitting critical mass back when we switched from oil burners to fuel-gas. All it's going to take is a technician making a mistake \u2014 or a burner failing for a little too long.\n\n\nYes, the incinerators have massive pits. Yes, if you get it hot enough, human fat will burn and do half the work for you. But none of that will matter if enough meat grows back to stuff the entire stack. Once that happens, the flue gas won't be able to get out \u2014 and good luck keeping those burners running without any room for oxygen. We'll lose all six incinerators just like that.\n\n\nAnd when that happens? They'll come back.\n\n\nAll of them\n.\n\n\nI checked the incineration logs. Incinerator #5 alone has incinerated over three thousand D-Class corpses. Combined, we're looking at ten thousand of these things \u2014 easy. All regenerators. All with every happy memory boiled away. All with 20 years worth of \nnew\n memories, primarily consisting of us burning them alive.\n\n\nI've been working for the Foundation for over 15 years.
