At time of writing, 186 such devices are in containment, collectively designated SCP-4951-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-2 in an unpowered state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on available information, SCP-4951 is believed to be the digitized consciousness of Horatio Avelar.\n1\n By the account of SCP-4951, components of SCP-4951-1 within Foundation custody account for roughly 0.085% of all such devices hosting a portion of its consciousness worldwide.\n\n\nSCP-4951 utilizes the combined computing power of its component parts in order to predict future anomalous activity. It utilizes this information to open shell corporations with the sole function of selling insurance policies covering very specific anomalous activities. Insurance policies generated in this way have proven successful in predicting anomalous activity and assisting with subsequent containment in 89% of cases.\n2\n\n\nAddendum 4951\u00a001:\n Abridged log of SCP-4951-1 components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1 Component\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-1\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a Lenovo ThinkPad E520. Screen and integrated user input devices are functional. 28% of internal memory is inaccessible.\n\n\nDevice intermittently submits online applications for various insurance business licenses through governmental websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-2\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a Nokia 5610 XpressMusic. Screen is inoperable. Device rests at 41\u00b0 C when in a powered state. Battery life when disconnected from power supply is 112 seconds.\n\n\nSCP-4951 either refuses to or is unable to communicate through other SCP-4951-1 components while SCP-4951-1-2 is in an unpowered state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-3\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a LG Optimus Pad V900. Touchscreen is functional. Default Media Player is the only installed application.\n\n\nAll communications from SCP-4951 directed at Foundation agents have occurred as .wav files loaded and played through SCP-4951-1-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-10\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a HP Pavilion p6200. Video output is functional. On boot, machine executes a single unrecognized process utilizing 2.6\u00a0kb of memory.\n\n\nDevice\u2019s function within SCP-4951 unclear, though communications generated by SCP-4951 while SCP-4951-1-10 is in an unpowered state are significantly more hostile than usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-14, SCP-4951-1-16, SCP-4951-1-22, & SCP-4951-1-28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach device is a Dell Inspiron 546. All instances fail to boot beyond BIOS screens.\n\n\nWhile any of the four devices is in an unpowered state, all communications from SCP-4951-1-3 are in French.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-71\n\n\n\n\nDevice is an IBM server mainframe located on the Los Angeles-class submarine Philadelphia.\n\n\nDevice powers off before completing boot sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-89\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a Dell Inspiron 400. Device attempts to launch Microsoft Outlook 2007 immediately following boot sequence. Program never launches, loads perpetually.\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-89 sends an email at 6:59 AM EST every Monday to \ncni.PPA|aromaZ.C#cni.PPA|aromaZ.C\n4\n containing a list of insurance policies protecting against various anomalous phenomena, with instructions directing which shell companies should offer each policy. This occurs regardless of whether or not SCP-4951-1-89 is in a powered state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-103\n\n\n\n\nDevice is a Cray brand Shasta supercomputer. Device devotes all memory to factoring seemingly random polynomials, and system cannot be shut down without removing power supply.\n\n\nThe 1-year success rate of insurance policies generated by SCP-4951 in predicting anomalous phenomena drops to 77% while SCP-4951-1-103 is in an unpowered state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951-1-175\n\n\n\n\nDevice is an Olympus DM-901 Wi-Fi enabled Digital Voice Recorder. Device's memory storage is inaccessible, and recorded audio cannot be replayed.\n\n\nSCP-4951 appears to 'hear' audio recorded on SCP-4951-1-175, utilizing SCP-4951-1-3 to generate a reply to any audio clip taken by SCP-4951-1-175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4951\u00a002:\n SCP-4951 initial interview log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Show\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-4951 (Vocal input via SCP-4951-1-175, vocal output via SCP-4951-1-3)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher Lilianne White\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-4951-1-1 and SCP-4951-1-10 were unpowered and in transit between facilities at time of interview.

Now, let's see what we got.\n\n\n[Researcher White attempts to play the recorded audio data.]\n\n\nResearcher White:\n Hm, nothing there? Guess the memory's fried.

Would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4951:\n You'd be upset too if the best parts of your brain were offline. And yes, I would very much mind telling you a single damn thing.\n\n\nResearcher White:\n I see. Not very forthcoming, are you?\n\n\nSCP-4951:\n Piss off.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Hostile AI(?) hosted within multiple electronic devices.
