MTF Rho-14 (\"Handschuhe\") is tasked with tracking the origin of the phenomenon and suppressing public knowledge of outbreaks. All instances of SCP-2494-1 should be captured, euthanized, and cataloged. One instance of SCP-2494-1 per major species is to be kept in Site-73 specimen storage.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2494 is a phenomenon whereby animals (SCP-2494-1) manifest human hands, integrated into their anatomy. To date, all instances of SCP-2494-1 have been vertebrates. The source and mechanisms of SCP-2494 are currently unknown, but the phenomenon has so far been centralized to the vicinity of the River Tweed along the Scottish/English border.\n\n\nHands related to SCP-2494 vary in size, but in SCP-2494-1 averaging more than 0.4m in length or 9\u00a0kg in weight are comparable to standard human hands. Hands typically occur (>90%) at the ends of forelimbs, less frequently (>60%) also on the hindlimbs. In rare instances, hands have been seen emerging from the cranium, along the spine, in place of the tail, or at the end of the nose. Hands are merged seamlessly with SCP-2494-1's physiology, and color varies according to the animal's own skin. DNA tests invariably return as that of the instance's species.\n\n\nSCP-2494-1 are generally not impeded by these hands, except in cases where placement overbalances the instance. Fine manipulation is possible, though instances will only use their hands in this manner if such behavior is typical for their species. However, SCP-2494-1 have been discovered clutching letters and flyers; the origin of these is currently under investigation. (See Addenda 2494-02 and -05.)\n\n\nAddendum 2494-01: Partial List of SCP-2494-1 Instances in Specimen Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2494-1-03-A\n\n\nMale Eurasian harvest mouse (\nMicromys minutus\n).

Hands at ends of forelimbs and in place of horns.\n\n\nTesting shows no appreciable difference between flavor of meat from body of SCP-2494-1-14 instances and meat from hands.

MTF Rho-14 was able to capture all instances and initiate counter-information procedures.\n\n\nEach instance possessed a single hand in place of its dorsal fin, visible above waterline. Movement in water was somewhat clumsy. Each hand clutched a plastic bag containing a small sheet of paper, text reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\nGreetings New Friends!\n\n\nWe Have Noticed You Watching With Your Eyes.

May You Find Always Happiness In Hands!\n\n\nSoft Hands\n\u00ae\n\n\n\n\nSince this event, instances of SCP-2494-1 have appeared more frequently with less advantageously placed hands, and greater numbers of hands per instance. Instances bearing communications have also increased. Investigation is ongoing; classification upgrade to Keter pending review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2493\n | SCP-2494 | \nSCP-2495\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2494\n\" by TL333s, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
