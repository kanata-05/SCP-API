Vittnner\n\n\nSr. Researcher Steele\n\n\nPi-76 (\"Time's Arrow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarrell High School, circa 1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Darrell County is under the direct purview of Site-115. All settlements within ten miles of SCP-7415's outermost perimeter of effect must be evacuated by 2030, using pro-urban life propaganda, economic decay for the surrounding area, and the creation of a false crisis to raise the urgency to move.\n\n\nThe perimeter of SCP-7415 must be surrounded by Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA), spaced twenty feet from one another. Outpost-7415 is responsible for monitoring SCP-7415 and SCP-7415-LAUREN. No further action is required.\n\n\nSCP-7415-STEPHEN is on the Foundation Watchlist. Interviews with SCP-7415-STEPHEN are to be conducted annually to assess their mental health.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7415 is a reality-altering area centered around Darrell High School and surrounding Darrell, Texas. SCP-7415 qualifies as a Class-B episodic time loop, where subjects within SCP-7415 are disconnected from their continuity, constantly reverting to their initial physical state when a change occurs.\n1\n SCP-7415's episodic loop is centered around the period of time from June 1975 to May 1976. Residents of SCP-7415 are unaware of this phenomenon, assuming SCP-7415 is a component of baseline reality.\n\n\nWhen a subject enters SCP-7415, they will experience a cognitohazardous effect that will mentally regress them to their late teens. Subjects that have gone through secondary school will integrate themselves into SCP-7415, reporting feelings of nostalgia and regret. These effects dissipate once the subject is removed from SCP-7415.\n\n\nSCP-7415 is maintained through two Type-Green reality-benders, designated as SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. All reality-benders are seniors at Darrell High School and seem to be aware of their influence on SCP-7415.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-7415 was discovered in 1998 when the U.S. Department of Education noticed records from Darrell High School indicating that no changes in the student population had occurred since the 1975-1976 school year. After multiple attempts to contact the school failed, a representative was sent to Darrell, Texas. Foundation forces intervened after the representative had been missing for two months.\n\n\nAddendum 7415.1:\n Observation Logs\n\n\nUpon Foundation intervention, Outpost-7415 was constructed to monitor SCP-7415 on the outskirts of Darrell, Texas. Video surveillance footage of Darrell High School was rerouted to Outpost-7415 for observation. Notable excerpts have been logged below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATION LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n September 5th, 1989, 8:53 AM\n\n\nLocation:\n Entrance\n\n\nContext:\n First day of school after the 1989 summer break. Students converse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n(Students stand by the entrance to the school next to a row of lockers. Idle conversations are made regarding their class and schedules.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill frame from Observation Log 1, [00:23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN walks into the building, followed by SCP-7415-LAUREN. They walk down the hallway and stop by their lockers.)\n\n\nLauren:\n We\u2019re sharing all of our classes again! Let\u2019s go snag some seats in the back before they\u2019re taken. I brought extra paper to pass notes with.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN glances down at his schedule. The ceiling slowly lowers, decreasing the hallway's height. Camera experiences mild visual distortion.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Again? Shouldn\u2019t we try some other classes?\n\n\nLauren:\n And leave everyone we know? No, you\u2019re staying with me. Come on, it\u2019ll be fine.\n\n\nStephen:\n If you say so. (pause) But-\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN waves at another student and motions them to come over.)\n\n\nLauren:\n Oh, Jenna! Over here!\n\n\n(A student, presumably Jenna, turns around and approaches SCP-7415-LAUREN)\n\n\nJenna:\n Lauren! How was your summer break? I haven't seen you in so long! You look so different, I could never!\n\n\nLauren:\n Aww, thank you! Honestly, I didn't even try today! I was too busy re-reading my catalog.\n\n\n(The conversation continues with unnotable discussion. Another student approaches SCP-7415-STEPHEN, who has been standing idly.)\n\n\nStudent:\n Hey Stephen, what classes do you have?\n\n\n(Student looks over SCP-7415-STEPHEN's shoulder and reads his schedule.)\n\n\nStudent:\n Ugh, you got Mr. Bobrick \nand\n Mrs. Taylor?! Good luck passing those classes man. If I were you, I'd be heading to class. Knowing them, they'd make you write an entire goddamn essay on the first day.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN slowly turns to the student. His face comes into the camera's view, looking dispirited.)\n\n\nStephen:\n So? It's not like I\u2019ll need a good grade anyways.\n\n\n(School bell rings. Students clear the hallways. The ceiling stops moving at a height of approximately six feet. SCP-7415-LAUREN coils herself on SCP-7415-STEPHEN\u2019s right arm.)\n\n\nLauren:\n Come on, we\u2019ve got to go!\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN grins as her face enters the camera frame. SCP-7415-STEPHEN slowly follows along, looking slightly agitated. SCP-7415-LAUREN drags SCP-7415-STEPHEN into a classroom.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n SCP-7415 is prone to frequent local reality distortions. Future exploration will require portable Scranton Reality Anchors.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVATION LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n June 2nd, 1991\n\n\nLocation:\n Gymnasium\n\n\nContext:\n SCP-7415-LAUREN is giving a speech at a graduation ceremony.\n2\n The interior of the gym was transformed into an expansive garden venue. SCP-7415-STEPHEN is standing behind her.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n(Sounds of birds chirping.)\n\n\nLauren:\n We always seem to find ourselves back here. It's been a great year, a great season, and a great time.\n\n\nThere's something haunting about sitting in these chairs, knowing that another year is behind us. But it's also beautiful.\n\n\nIt's beautiful that we get to try again. For those of you, that failed your classes, your friendships, and your relationships, you get another chance. For those of you who've had a fantastic year, you get to live through it all over again! Over and over, making new memories and cherishing our old ones.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN pauses. Students seem visibly bored and uninterested.)\n\n\nLauren:\n When I was younger, and I mean \nreally\n young, I'd listen to the record player. I mean, I still do, but not nearly as much as I used to. I'd listen to the same songs repeatedly. For hours at a time, I was singing the same melody, and I never tired of it. Now, in my first senior year, I was listening to one vinyl, \n\"Remember the Rain.\"\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN appears to be lost in thought. After about five seconds, she speaks.)\n\n\nLauren:\n When I listened to it, I was overwhelmed. I realized how lucky I am to be in the position I'm in now. I have a loving boyfriend, amazing friends, and wonderful parents, and in a couple of months, I would be leaving all that behind. Y'all showed me kindness when I thought no one else could.\n\n\nI'm- We are surrounded by the most wonderful people we may ever meet. They've stuck with us through all these years. There is no one that knows us better than the people in this room, no one else that would accept us.\n\n\n(An unidentifiable melody begins playing over the P.A. system. There is significant auditory distortion.)\n\n\nLauren:\n I'm so glad I get to spend this time with you.\n\n\n(The camera experiences heavy visual distortion.)\n\n\nLauren:\n Thanks for coming. I'll see you all next year.\n\n\n(Sounds of cheering and applause. All students remain seated and unmoving.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n Analysis of cognitohazardous material within the log bears similarities with \nother\n \ndocumented\n \nanomalies.\n Containment protocols have been updated to prevent hindrances in research and exploration. A CRV (Cognitive Resistance Value) above 16 is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7415.2:\n Exploration Preparations\n\n\nMembers of MTF Pi-76 were screened for their potential resistance to SCP-7415. Agent Miranda Martinez was chosen as the final candidate. The following briefing was conducted to finalize these results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERSONNEL BRIEFING\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n October 4th, 1999\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Sr. Researcher Stacy Steele\n\n\nSubject:\n Agent Miranda Martinez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nSteele:\n Alright, I've read through the briefings, but I wanted to hear what you had to say.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Am I the one going?\n\n\nSteele:\n You are. Your CRV is pretty high, you hated school, I just want to hear the specifics. Whenever you're ready.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Well, my mom worked in the military and was moving around. My dad and I followed her around until around the middle of my freshman year. I'd already been hit with the pain of making and losing friends in elementary and middle school, so I didn't really make friends when I arrived.\n\n\nThere wasn't really one notable event, it was just a lot of constant little things that added up. The food, the teachers, the people. It was just annoying, all of it. Add that to the fact that my mom wasn't present for most of it, and it becomes my own personal hellhole.\n\n\nSteele:\n Sorry to hear that. Was there anyone in particular that was close to you? Anyone you might \nremember?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Yeah, there was this one girl, Selena. She was the only person I could tolerate. She was in most of my classes, the only one that tried to talk to me when I moved in. The other kids ragged on her a lot through the years, made her the \"weird kid.\"\n\n\nOne time they started hiding her things. Anytime she was gone, they'd take her pens, her water bottle, she had this necklace she loved, last gift from her mother, and they hid it. When she couldn't find them, she just went to the bathroom and cried. That's when I knew that they were irredeemable.\n\n\nSteele:\n That's awful.\n\n\nMartinez:\n It's not even that, it's that these kids were the \"popular\" ones. They weren't popular, they were just flashy and we knew their names! When I found out what happened, I went and gave them flat tires. All of them. Fuckers deserved it. Worst years of my life.\n\n\nSteele:\n What happened to her after you graduated? Do you keep in touch?\n\n\nMartinez:\n No, we got into a fight near the end of it and didn't makeup. I don't know what happened to her. I don't even remember what the fight was about. I just regret losing my only friend.\n\n\nSteele:\n Okay, I think you're fit to go in. Your CRV will make up for any nostalgia you still have. Keep a sharp mind and check in with us regularly. I'll be on the other end.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Do I just go in there and do surveillance?\n\n\nSteele:\n No, we have a plan.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n Agent Martinez's negative experience with secondary school and high CRV (Cognitive Resistance Value) allows for a greater chance of resistance to SCP-7415's cognitohazardous effects.\n\n\n\n\nAgent Martinez has been tasked with going into SCP-7415 and attempting to extract SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. Due to the low rate of success associated with extracting reality-benders, Martinez will also place Reality Anchors at focal points\n4\n of SCP-7415, diminishing its effect, and allowing for more standard containment protocols.\n\n\nAgent Martinez has been equipped with a handheld Hume reader and a portable Scranton Reality Anchor.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7415.3:\n Interviews\n\n\nAfter establishing herself within SCP-7415, Agent Martinez isolated 7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN to convince them into containment under the pretense of college preparations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n October 9th, 1999\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Martinez\n\n\nSubject:\n Stephen Rainer (SCP-7415-STEPHEN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nMartinez:\n Good afternoon Stephen. Take a seat.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN sits down. He looks around the room and then back at Martinez.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Oh, did it happen again?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Did what happen again?\n\n\nStephen:\n You\u2019re just here to talk right? You\u2019ve never been here before and you want to talk.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Yes, I want to talk about your future aspirations. Where do you see yourself in five years?\n\n\n(Stephen stares blankly at Martinez. He then stands and begins pacing around the room.)\n\n\nStephen:\n I can only do so much. If you\u2019ve got any ideas for what to do next, I\u2019m open to it, but otherwise, I don\u2019t see how this\u2019ll help.\n\n\nMartinez:\n Have you considered leaving Darrell altogether? If you\u2019re bored, then it\u2019s time to get out and stop this.\n\n\nStephen:\n (pauses) No, I'm a good boyfriend. I\u2019d never leave Lauren like that. Besides, as long as we have each other\u2026.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN trails off. He begins mumbling to himself.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n You might as well do it.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN looks up. Small tears swell up in his eyes.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n Talk with her when you can. You can still be together after graduation. If you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll be stuck doing the same thing every year.\n\n\nStephen:\n But what if-\n\n\nMartinez:\n Listen. There\u2019s nothing for you here. Everything loses its shine if you linger. You said you were bored, right?\n\n\nStephen:\n Yeah?\n\n\nMartinez\n Well, you\u2019ll only going to get more bored. Rip the band-aid off now before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\nStephen:\n (sighs) Well, thanks for being here.\n\n\n(Martinez watches SCP-7415-STEPHEN as he gets up and opens the door.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Even if I made you up.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN leaves the room.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n October 9th, 1999\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Martinez\n\n\nSubject:\n Lauren Campbell (SCP-7415-LAUREN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nMartinez:\n Hello, Lauren. Have a seat.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN nervously takes a seat. Her eyebrows furrow as she looks at Agent Martinez.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n I've noticed that you haven't filled out any applications for college, so I just wanted to ask why.\n\n\nLauren:\n (stiffly) Ask why I haven't applied?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Yes, what's holding you back? The school's been wondering why you haven't done any planning.\n\n\nLauren\n Why do I need to? Everything's fine here. I don't have to go.\n\n\nMartinez:\n (sighs) Look, you can't-\n\n\nLauren:\n I can't just leave everybody behind! I tried so hard to get here, I'm not losing it because some stuffy official comes over and tells me to leave it!\n\n\nMartinez:\n If that's the issue, then we can arrange-\n\n\nLauren:\n (ranting) Don't you remember being a senior? How much fun you had? If you had the chance, I bet you'd want to be a teenager again. Just because I have that chance doesn't mean you can take it away from me!\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN quickly gets up from her chair and leans over the desk, pointing at Agent Martinez.)\n\n\nLauren:\n I don't know where you people are coming from, but you need to stay in your lane. I'll tell you what I told that other guy: Don't fuck with me. I can do things you wouldn't believe.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN angrily leaves the room and slams the door. The walls shake from the impact. Several seconds pass.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n (sighs) 'Course it didn't work, you can't convince benders.\n\n\n(Martinez pulls out her handheld Hume detector.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n Time for Plan B.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7415.4:\n Exploration Logs\n\nOutpost-7415 has identified three focal points of SCP-7415.

Hume levels are decreasing, so tread carefully.\n\n\n(As Martinez moves through the corridor, the interior progressively falls into disrepair. Light fixtures flicker before failing. Paint peels off of the walls and broken floor tiles are strewn across the floor.)\n\n\n(The Hume detector beeps faster as she approaches a door labeled \"Roof Access.\" As she ascends, its beeps speed up.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n Command, I\u2019m approaching a focal point. Stand by.\n\n\n(Martinez continues going up the staircase. After several flights, she stops for a break. The Hume detector continues to beep aggressively.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n (breathing heavily) Command, can you see where I'm at?

The humanoids, designated as SCP-7415-S\u03b1 and SCP-7415-L\u03b1 respectively, have no facial features, with their faces being composed of rubber-like, unbroken skin.)\n\n\n(Over the next several minutes, they glance at each other and the sky.

Martinez gets up and leaves the room. She walks down the hallway, retracing her steps.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n That's it?! That's all they were scared about? No family issues, no present danger, they're just some kids that don't want to grow up?!\n\n\nIt makes no sense. Why would anyone want to do this to themselves? Just live out the worst four years of their life.\n6\n\n\nCommand:\n Focus on the mission, Miranda \u2014 one more left.\n\n\nMartinez:\n (scoffs) You can\u2019t tell me what to do. Nobody can. Who do they think they are, forcing everything through this because they\u2019re babies about it?\n\n\nCommand:\n Martinez, are you okay? We\u2019re sending another counter meme, just in case.\n\n\n(Martinez groans in frustration and shuts the receiving end of her headphones. Command is still able to hear Martinez.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n (screaming) And I put up these anchors and what? They can just continue living their fantasy because they're too scared to get out of their own selfish, fucking heads! Is that it?! Are they just going to float around in their senior year and avoid growing up, while everyone else has to suffer because of them?\n\n\n(scoffs) I\u2019m dragging them out of here, and I'll give them a piece of my mind.\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLORATION LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n October 9th, 1999\n\n\nInvolved Personnel:\n Agent Martinez\n\n\nMission:\n Exit SCP-7415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n(Martinez reaches the front entrance. Heavy rain hits the front windows with an occasional clap of thunder. A crowd of students blocks the entrance. SCP-7415-LAUREN and SCP-7415-STEPHEN stand at the front, facing Agent Martinez. SCP-7415-LAUREN is visibly agitated.)\n\n\nLauren:\n Well, there you are! What have you been doing, sneaking around like that?\n\n\nMartinez:\n Both of you, turn it off. We\u2019re leaving.\n\n\nLauren:\n Turn it off? Turn it off?!\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN stomps her foot, causing the floor to shift to a sharp incline. Agent Martinez loses her balance and falls toward the crowd, who immediately swarm her.)\n\n\nLauren:\n (yelling) I am not letting another nosy outsider mess with this!\n\n\n(The crowd grabs at Agent Martinez\u2019s limbs, holding her down. All members of the crowd are faceless, with their rubber skin sinking into their orifices. Martinez is unable to overpower them.)\n\n\nLauren:\n I only wanted this to last! Don\u2019t you remember being a kid? Why would you want to take that away?!\n\n\n(Orchestral music is played from an indiscernible source. SCP-7415-LAUREN approaches Martinez and makes eye contact. The floor levels.)\n\n\nLauren:\n (shaking) You have to remember don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you remember your mom dropping you off at school? All your friends that you\u2019ve known all your life? Your boyfriend treating you to ice cream after a rough test? The football games, the school dances? Remember the smell of the damp carpet after a thunderstorm knocks out power in the middle of class? Can\u2019t you remember the rain?!\n\n\n(Tears begin forming in SCP-7415-LAUREN\u2019s eyes. Agent Martinez struggles for a minute, then spits in SCP-7415-LAUREN\u2019s general direction.)\n\n\nMartinez:\n Oh, grow up.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN\u2019s eyes widen. She clenches her hands into fists and glares at Martinez, mumbling to herself.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Uh, Lauren?\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN turns to face SCP-7415-STEPHEN. Her demeanor visibly relaxes. She gives a slight smile.)\n\n\nLauren:\n Stephen! Sorry you have to see this side of me, but I\u2019m doing this for\u2026 for us! We just need to-\n\n\nStephen:\n Lauren, I don\u2019t know how to say this, but I think the lady is right. We need a break from all this.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN smile drops immediately. She takes a step backward.)\n\n\nLauren:\n You\u2026 you want to leave?\n\n\nStephen:\n No, of course not! I\u2019m just saying we can leave together! It\u2019s just gotten a little boring, and-\n\n\nLauren:\n Boring?! I\u2019m too boring for you?\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN takes several steps backward, stepping on one of the crowd member\u2019s arm. It shrieks and lets go of Martinez\u2019s right arm, allowing her to pull out an emergency reality anchor and set it down.)\n\n\n(The crowd members release Martinez and enter a dazed state. They begin to claw at their faces in shock and panic. SCP-7415-LAUREN turns around and notices the member\u2019s autonomy.)\n\n\nLauren:\n (panicked) Calm down guys! It\u2019s only temporary, so just, uhm\u2026\n\n\n(Martinez attempts to leave the building but is interrupted by SCP-7415-STEPHEN.)\n\n\nStephen:\n (softly) Are you leaving the school?\n\n\n(Martinez glances at the door and then at SCP-7415-LAUREN, who is trying to calm the crowd members. She looks back at SCP-7415-STEPHEN and nods.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Then can you\u2026.\n\n\n(SCP-7415-STEPHEN looks longingly at SCP-7415-LAUREN.)\n\n\nStephen:\n Take me with you.\n\n\n(Martinez nods again, grabs SCP-7415-STEPHEN's hand, and begins moving towards the exit. SCP-7415-LAUREN notices and attempts to move toward them, tripping on wailing crowd members laying on the floor.)\n\n\nLauren:\n STEPHEN! No, don\u2019t go! We can- agh!\n\n\n(SCP-7415-LAUREN trips and falls. She reaches out her hand, tears running down her cheeks.)\n\n\nLauren:\n (softly) Please don\u2019t go.\n\n\n(Agent Martinez and SCP-7415-STEPHEN exit the school and approach Outpost-7415. As they distance themselves from SCP-7415\u2019s center, the weather begins to clear and the rain stops.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00abEND LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum 7415.5:\n Relocation\n\n\nSCP-7415-STEPHEN has since entered Foundation custody. He has been screened for potential issues and given Class-A amnestics. SCP-7415-STEPHEN has demonstrated a lack of reality-bending abilities and has been transferred to a non-anomalous public school to finish their senior year.\n\n\nOn June 4th, 2000, a day after SCP-7415-STEPHEN's graduation, Outpost-7415 received a message from SCP-7415:\n\n\n\n\nplease come back\n\n\nit's not the same without you\n\n\ni'm sorry\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, SCP-7415 experienced a temporary, but significant dip in Hume levels.

Instead of having graduating seniors, the ceremony was extended to all students regardless of grade level. Due to the lack of temporal progression in SCP-7415, the ceremony served as a celebration for the prior year.\n\n\n3\n.

The music has been flagged for containing nostalgic, cognitohazardous properties. A copy of the audio without these properties has been attached to the log.\n\n\n6\n. At this point, Martinez had succumbed to SCP-7415\u2019s cognitohazardous effect and mentally regressed to her teenage years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-7415\n\" by CowscantgoMoo, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "Addendum 7415.2: Exploration Preparations\nMembers of MTF Pi-76 were screened for their potential resistance to SCP-7415. Agent Miranda Martinez was chosen as the final candidate. The following briefing was conducted to finalize these results:\nAgent Martinez has been tasked with going into SCP-7415 and attempting to extract SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. Due to the low rate of success associated with extracting reality-benders, Martinez will also place Reality Anchors at focal points 4 of SCP-7415, diminishing its effect, and allowing for more standard containment protocols.",

Addendum 7415.3: Interviews\nAfter establishing herself within SCP-7415, Agent Martinez isolated 7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN to convince them into containment under the pretense of college preparations.\n\n\n\nOutpost-7415 has identified three focal points of SCP-7415. Agent Martinez is tasked with verifying these focal points and placing reality anchors to effectively contain SCP-7415.

SCP-7415 qualifies as a Class-B episodic time loop, where subjects within SCP-7415 are disconnected from their continuity, constantly reverting to their initial physical state when a change occurs.1 SCP-7415's episodic loop is centered around the period of time from June 1975 to May 1976. Residents of SCP-7415 are unaware of this phenomenon, assuming SCP-7415 is a component of baseline reality.",
