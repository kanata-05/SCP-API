Dr. Webber should be permitted to continue working as a researcher, given that its health remains stable.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6441, known as Dr. Webber, is a sapient, unidentified member of the order \nAnura\n possessing a memetic effect that causes those who view it to believe that it is human. Prior to the discovery of its anomalous effects, SCP-6441 was seemingly unaware of its non-human characteristics.\n\n\nUpon discovery of its anomalous effects, subjects will become aware of many non-human characteristics of SCP-6441; however, its body will still appear human.\n\n\nAddendum 6441-01:\n Discovery\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The following log is a transcript of a multi-department meeting at Site-56. Dr. Juno Payne is known to have an unusually high level of memetic resistance.\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 12:16\u00a004/20/2022]\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Is everyone here?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Juno's late again.\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Who's Juno?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Y'know, tall, four eyes, kind of a bitch?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I don't think I do.\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Eh, we can get started without her. So-\n\n\n[Dr. Payne enters hurriedly.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Sorry, got caught up in\u2026\n\n\n[A pause as Juno moves to take a seat.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n The fuck?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n What is it this time?\n\n\n[Dr. Payne points towards SCP-6441.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Why's there a frog?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n A frog. Why is there a frog sitting next to me?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Ah, ha-ha, because Webber.\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n No, dumbass. There's a frog right there!\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Hey, guys?\n\n\n[SCP-6441 stares at its hands.]\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I don't\u2026 think she's joking.\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I mean, she's not joking. These aren't\u2026 human hands. I don't\u2026\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Aaand it's talking. Great.\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Guys? I can't remember anything before 2018\u2026\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Correct me if I'm wrong, but frogs take two years to reach adulthood, right?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n That's\u2026 what I'm saying\u2026\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Oh, that's why the table was so slimy!\n\n\n[Dr. Payne squints.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n You didn't know the frog was there?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n No, I mean-\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n \n(quietly)\n Oh god, I'm a frog.\n\n\n[END LOG, 12:20]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6441-01:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Juno Payne\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. John Meyers\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 08:39\u00a004/21/2022]\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Thank you for coming.\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n I mean, I didn't really have much of a choice.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n I suppose. Anyway, what happened during the meeting yesterday?\n\n\n[Dr. Payne shrugs.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Not much, really. Walked in late, saw a frog in the chair next to me.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Hm. Had you met Dr. Webber before, or was this your first time?\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n First time.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Webber's the frog, right?\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Yes.\n\n\nDr. Payne:\n Yeah, first time.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n That'll be all, then.\n\n\n[END LOG, 08:41]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6441-02:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Aaron Frye\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. John Meyers\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 09:30\u00a004/21/2022]\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n I'm guessing this is about yesterday?\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Yes. You know Dr. Webber somewhat well, correct?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Uh, yeah, other than the whole\u2026 frog thing.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Had you noticed any unusual characteristics before yesterday?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Kind of? I saw her eating bugs once, but I didn't think anything of it.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Is that all?\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Mm-mm. Sometimes, things she touches are slimy.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Oh, and she always\u2026 sticks her hands in water? Like, she just sticks her hand in the glass. I've never seen her drinking it. Which, yeah, seems weird in hindsight.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n And none of these things seemed strange?\n\n\n[Dr. Frye shrugs.]\n\n\nDr. Frye:\n Uh\u2026 not really. I just didn't really think about them.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n I see. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n[END LOG, 09:35]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6441-03:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Bruce Stevens\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. John Meyers\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 10:33\u00a004/21/2022]\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Dr. Stevens.\n\n\n[Dr. Stevens nods.]\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n You were responsible for hiring Dr. Webber, correct?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Yes. Seemed like a good fit.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Why's that?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n She's brilliant. Great with physics, which happened to be what we needed.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Did you run a background check?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n Mhm. We found nothing. Literally nothing. No background.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n And you hired her anyway?\n\n\nDr. Stevens:\n I just\u2026 didn't think anything of it. Seemed normal for some reason.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Hm. Well, that's all I need from you.\n\n\n[END LOG, 10:35]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 6441-04:\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-6441\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. John Meyers\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 11:31\u00a004/21/2022]\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Dr. Webber. How are you?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I dunno. How'd you be if you found out you were a frog?\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n I'm sorry. This won't take long.\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I- [sigh] great.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Before yesterday, were you aware of\u2026 your species?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n No, I just said I wasn't.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n You didn't think anything of your odd behaviors?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Odd behaviors? Like what?\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Eating insects, absorbing water\u2026\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n That's normal.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n That's not normal at all.\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Oh\u2026 shoot.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Moving on, what's the earliest thing you can remember?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Uh, being alone, I think. I had\u2026 siblings. Something happened to them. I think, uh\u2026\n\n\n[A pause. SCP-6441 squints.]\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Some kids\u2026 did something\u2026? I dunno. It's kinda fuzzy.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n What happened after that?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Um\u2026 a woman said something, and\u2026 I could think.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Could you not think before that?\n\n\n[SCP-6441 shakes its head.]\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I didn't really have any thoughts before that.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n When did you enter human society?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n Pretty soon after. I was in grad school.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n What about your lack of a background?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I dunno. I didn't really think anything of it.\n\n\n[A pause.]\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I don't get it. How didn't I notice? \nWhy\n didn't I notice?\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n Well, we think it's some sort of memetic-\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n No, I mean, if I knew, I could've done more. My time\u2026 must be running out.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n How would you have known?\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I don't know. Whatever- whoever did this, she could've made it so I knew. I could actually do something to help if\u2026\n\n\n[SCP-6441 sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-6441:\n I just\u2026 don't know how to deal with this. It's a lot, really.\n\n\nDr. Meyers:\n I'm\u2026 sorry.\n\n\n[END LOG, 10:41]\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6441-02:\n On 04/23/2022, SCP-6441 submitted the following note to Dr. Meyers.\n\n\n\n\nI think I get it now.
