Due to the endemic nature of the population, no further containment measures are necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Photographed SCP-6573 instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6573 denotes the population of pigeons endemic to Site-357.\n\n\nWhile SCP-6573 instances are physiologically identical to rock pigeons,\n1\n observations from site personnel identified strange behavior patterns across all instances, which are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThey are passive in the presence of humans, rarely fleeing when personnel approach.\n\n\nInstances shred scavenged and unattended food with their beaks rather than consuming it.\n\n\nWhile they display mating behaviors, no SCP-6573 instance has been observed to produce offspring.\n\n\nPersonnel have reported feeling as though they are \"being watched\" by SCP-6573 instances.\n\n\nInstances have been recorded \"falling out of the air\", and appear to struggle to maintain flight for long periods of time.\n\n\nSite personnel note that instances \"walk weird\".\n\n\n\n\nDespite these traits, Site-357's SCP-6573 population has been steadily rising, measured at approximately 264 in the last population survey.\n\n\nIncident 6573-1:\n On 8/11/2023, Site Director Esther Sparks located an SCP-6573 instance within her office. After capturing the instance, she found the following note attached to its leg, coupled with a copy of the 6573 file.\n\n\n\n\nTook a gander at your review of my doves. Sorry they weren't quite up to scratch, but that's what happens when you wing it, eh! Lesson learned, I guess.\n\n\n \n\nI even agree with you! I agree! They aren't realistic at all, but I'd prefer you'd contact me directly, y'know, so I can actually do anything about it. Still, the batch sucks. I'm abandoning it, just so you know.\n\n\n \n\nWhatever though. Whatever. I don't care.\n\n\n \n\nPlease, just tell me to my face next time rather than being weird about it, ok? What do I even do about them \"walking weird\"?\n\n\n \n\nNevermind.\n\n\n\n\nYours in song,\n\nLovebird\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations into the whereabouts of PoI-6573 (\"Lovebird\") are underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree petrified SCP-6573 instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 6573-2:\n At 2:00PM on 8/13/2023, every SCP-6573 instance simultaneously underwent comprehensive petrification, the falling debris of which injured 15 members of staff, but killed none.\n\n\nFollowing the incident, on site MTF Psi-64 (\"Art Attack\") agents were deployed to recover all instances in the area. In total, while many were in a state of disrepair, approximately 305 petrified instances were recovered and show no further anomalous activity. Due to this, SCP-6573 is pending reclassification to Neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6573\n\" by IndustryStandard, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
