An automated system is to copy this entire document into Addendum-6804/C every hour without teal coloration.\n\n\nAdditional writing made to this document outside of Addendum-6804/C is to be written in teal colored text as to prevent SCP-6804 from consuming it.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6804 is a digital infohazardous phenomenon that is currently affecting the entire Foundation online database, including all SCP documentation, which causes written characters to be 'consumed' by SCP-6804.\n\n\nSCP-6804's consumption is a process in which characters affected by SCP-6804 will be spontaneously removed from their related documentation and source code, inevitably leading to the destruction of the affected information. After continuous testing, it has been determined that SCP-6804 has a higher probability of consuming certain characters in texts with a higher relation to itself, and that are in certain colors.\n\n\nSCP-6804 was consequently discovered after it had already consumed characters from multiple SCP documents, including sections of important information that constituted descriptions and Special Containment Procedures.\n\n\nAddendum-6804/B:\n Testing Log\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffected Text\n\n\nColor\n\n\nAmount Consumed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n23 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of infohazardous anomalies\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n92 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of predatory infohazardous anomalies\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n322 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n937 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n1021 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n791 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nRed\n\n\n1262 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nPurple\n\n\n570 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nBlue\n\n\n172 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nGreen\n\n\n56 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete description of SCP-6804\n\n\nTeal\n\n\n0 Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-6804/C:\n SCP-6804 Containment Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Containment\u00a0Text\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Containment\u00a0Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReload Containment Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6803\n | SCP-6804 | \nSCP-6805\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6804\n\" by IcedCat, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
