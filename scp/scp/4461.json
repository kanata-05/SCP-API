This location is not to be listed in any Foundation records or disclosed to any Foundation employee except this object's HMCL\n1\n. The database version of this containment file is not to includ\nfffffffffffffffff\n\n\nok so, at some point a bunch of stuff got deleted, but I didn't do it, I promise\n\n\ni am a janitor, i don't usually work with files. so i'm really sorry if this is in the wrong format or something, but I'm going to do my best. therer a lot of options on this screen and I am afraid of clicking the wrong one and messing everything up. so please stay with me, ok\n\n\nThe box is to be obviously marked as Foundation Property, with prominent instructions that if found, it should not be opened, but instead be delivered to the next person on Foundation Personnel List 8288-A (See \nAddendum 1\n). A physical copy of this containment file is to be printed on acid-free paper and the attached files downloaded onto non-volatile removable media. A copy is to be placed with SCP-4461 in the event the HMCL is unable to find a replacement before becoming incapacitated, or meets an unexpected death.\n\n\ntest test, can i add stuff? \nNash Pinkle\n woz here\n\n\noh shit how do i delete tat\n\n\nIn the event that the HMCL discovers any other Foundation employee (up to and including O5 personnel) is attempting to investigate SCP-4461, they are to immediately initiate the containment protocol listed in \nAddendum 3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4461 before containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4461 is a round sphere of leather, 73mm in diameter, stitched from two pieces of fitting leather scraps secured into a spherical pouch with twine. testing confirms it is filled with sand of unknown origin. Attempts to open the object for further testing do not work. \nit looks kinda like an acient baseball.\n\n\nSCP-4461 is an infohazard. When a person in a position of leadership becomes aware of SCP-4461, they immediately become an instance of SCP-4461-A. In a matter of time ranging from several weeks to several months, the organizational structure below SCP-4461-A suffers increased inefficiency, failure, and catastrophe that grows in severity.\n2\n\n\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nLoss of efficiency\n\n\nPolicy violations\n\n\nSickness\n\n\nIncreased turnover rate\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nSudden death\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the organizational structure reporting to SCP-4461-A will crumble. Further hierarchies under SCP-4461-A's command will also fail; notably, SCP-4461-A will not suffer these effects themselves (unless those above them in their organizational hierarchy are also affected).\n\n\nother things have been tried sometimes, but didn't work. but ya know, you can't really test it without people finding out, and then everything is fucked, rite\n\n\niffn im being honest i dont want to do this. so it was oh like two years or so ago I was workin janitor for site 52 outside manchester (COME ON U REDS), i get told 'pack yer shit up, Nash, yer goin to france.' so I get an address and a plane ticket, my flat gets sold overnight and i'm off to fuckkken france. i dont SPEAK FRENCH\n\n\nThis effect can only be stopped by SCP-4461-A's death. Uses of amnestics on affected subjects do not slow or inhibit the effects of SCP-4461.\n\n\nso i find out im the new trainee under this old guy. dean. wasn't much training. an i was SHIT at the job, right? thought I was gonna get fired, kept fuckin things up. and then one day he told me about this 4461. and told me i'd been promoted to HMCL. an i asked him what it meant and he gave me this usb sitck, told me to read the file. then he wished me good luck an was gone. never saw im again.\n\n\nAddenda\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a01.A:\u00a0Foundation\u00a0Personnel\u00a0List\u00a08288-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a01.A:\u00a0Foundation\u00a0Personnel\u00a0List\u00a08288-A\n\n\n\n\nFPL-8288-A is a list of 50 Class-0 Clearance Foundation Personnel who have the lowest scores on the Ranser-G Ambition Scale and no subordinates. This list is to be placed in an easily-accessible location with redundant backups and be available to all Foundation employees. It is to be self-maintaining without human intervention. Attempts to redact or expunge this document should be met with warnings regarding unspecified infohazardous \nit sucks being on this list. makes you a joke, nobody takes you seriously. i am Nash, king of shit hill.\n\n\nan like, when ur on this list, you go nowhere. never get promotions. but u also don get fired. look at the thing on the next section\n\n\nfuckin shitfuckshit\n\n\nok so, it was in the next one, it's not there anymore, i accidentally turned THE WHOLE FUKIN THING INTO BLOCKS and chant change it back, FUCK\n\n\nanyway, there's this thing about the job, right? you can't get fired. not allowed. if yer on that shit list, you stay there. for fuckin ever.\n\n\ni asked dean, before he left, if i had done a good job.\n\n\n'no,' he laughed, and i thought he was takin the piss. then he says 'you were shit at your job but youll get better. we all do.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a01.B:\u00a0Employment\u00a0status\u00a0and\u00a0FPL\u00a08288-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\u00a01.B:\u00a0Employment\u00a0status\u00a0and\u00a0FPL\u00a08288-A\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, [\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588] \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 [\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588] \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 [\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588] \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nUNDO\n\nUNREDARCT\n\n\nfuck, not working\n\n\noh but you know what you CAN do?
