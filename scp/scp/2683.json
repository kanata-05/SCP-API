Any instances of animals of the \nProboscidea\n order entering the anomaly are to be noted. Due to the isolated nature of SCP-2683, confrontation with civilians over containment is unlikely; as a precaution, signs are to be posted at the perimeter stating that the area contains large amounts of hazardous subterranean gases.\n\n\nIf any specimens not native to the area perish while in SCP-2683, the bodies are to be collected for analysis. After analysis, the bodies are to be incinerated. Genetic samples are to be stored.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2683 designates a forest clearing located in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 National Park, India. The clearing is 0.6km\n2\n in size, and is populated by local fauna. The clearing contains a large pond whose volume has not been observed to change either in droughts or during the rainy season.\n\n\nSCP-2683 is subject to a temporal and spatial anomaly. Various specimens of the order \nProboscidea\n have been seen to materialise on the edge of the clearing before making their way down to the pond in the centre. Native, non-native, and extinct species have all been witnessed. All specimens apparently exhibit the same behaviour pattern: touching the tips of their trunks to the surface of the water, and then expelling large amounts of tears from their eyes. Some individuals have been seen placing branches on the surface of the pond. The majority of specimens will de-materialise after a variable amount of time; however, specimens have been known to stand at the water until they die, apparently of malnutrition. A complete log of species sighted at SCP-2683 is found below (not including species native to the area).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinomial Name/Common name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoxodonta africana\n, African bush elephant\n\n\nLarge in size, species vulnerable in the wild\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoxodonta cyclotis\n, African forest elephant\n\n\nRarely seen in the wild\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMammuthus\n genus, presumed Columbian mammoth\n\n\nLived in Pleistocene epoch, hairless mammoth species. An attempt to capture an instance of this species failed, as it de-materialised after leaving SCP-2683\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMammuthus exilis\n, pygmy mammoth\n\n\nExtinct dwarf species, of which fossils have only been found on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMammuthus primigenius\n, woolly mammoth\n\n\nLarge, hairy. Instances of this species always arrive in large herds of 30-40 individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGomphotherium\n genus\n\n\nInstances of this species are fairly aggressive to personnel, and have caused several minor injuries. Instances possess four tusks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnancus\n genus\n\n\nInstances of this species possess extremely long tusks, the largest of which were estimated to be 4.2 metres in length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoeritherium\n genus\n\n\nEocene-era species; lacks tusks and has a minuscule trunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElephas celebensis\n, Sulawesi dwarf elephant\n\n\nHas lower tusks. Instances do not appear very often\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElephas maximus sumatranus\n, Sumatran elephant\n\n\nSmaller than most other species. One of the more common species sighted in SCP-2683\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified\n\n\nBlack, small, possessed flipper-like appendages, non-aggressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified\n\n\nDark-orange, large incisors, five tusks, extremely aggressive. Injured several personnel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparent instance of \nSCP-2082\n\n\nCaused deaths of \u2588 personnel through anomalous effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Researchers deployed a small aquatic drone to give a picture of the inside of the pond. The depth from the drone exploration was revealed to be around 15-17 metres. Footage revealed a large, elephantine skeleton is situated at the bottom of the pool; a 2-person dive is planned to recover large amounts of bone for analysis.\n\n\nUpdate:\n The two-man dive has been designated Incident-2683-A. Logs of this incident are found below.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n Comms are good on this end. Confirm, Couzens?\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n Confirm.\n\n\nDr. Hamidou:\n Alright. Descend.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n Affirmative.\n\n\nDivers descend further into the pool.\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n We have visual on the skeleton.\n\n\nDr. Hamidou:\n Good, proceed with collecting the bones.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n Got it, collecting samples.\n\n\nThe divers attempt to remove some of the bones from the sediment, but appear to fail.\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n These bones won't budge.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n I'm going to get a better grip, hold on.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, Agent Dhawan removes his gloves and makes skin contact with the bones. He pauses in his action.\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n What's up? You alright?\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n I know why I'm here. She has connected with me, and healed me.\n\n\nDr. Hamidou:\n Agent Dhawan, are you alright?\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n I can't believe that they\u2026 that you, killed her.\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n Dhawan, pull away. We're getting out of here, come on.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n This place\u2026 it was sacred, until they came.\n\n\nDr. Hamidou:\n Agent Couzens, pull up. We can retrieve Agent Dhawan later.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan:\n It's great that\u2026 she connected with us, so we could come here. I'm going back home, now.\n\n\nAgent Dhawan vanishes, leaving no trace.\n\n\nAgent Couzens:\n What the fuck? Where the hell did he go?\n\n\nDr. Hamidou:\n Get back here, Couzens. Quickly.\n\n\nAgent Couzens returns to the surface.\n\n\n\n\nFurther dives into the pond failed to locate Agent Dhawan.\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017, agents in Colombo, Sri Lanka, discovered Agent Dhawan in a psychiatric hospital, where he was designated SCP-2683-1. Dhawan mimicked the mannerisms and behaviour of an elephant, and did not display any human behavioural traits. Staff at the institution stated that Dhawan had been found wandering the streets, and was apprehended after assaulting several civilians. It was noted from records that Agent Dhawan was born in Colombo. No further dives are planned.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
