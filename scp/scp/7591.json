By nature, murders by use of SCP-7591 are unable to be confirmed, and any physical evidence is completely erased from the present reality. This includes a weapon, the deceased, traces of DNA, and other information that would lead to the confirmation of the murder.\n\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, those who encounter a person who used SCP-7591 will invariably become aware that a murder took place and that the user of SCP-7591 is responsible.\n\n\nAddendum 7591.1:\n Investigation\n\n\nOn December 24, 2019, Alex Thorley was transferred to Site-322 as part of unrelated investigatory research. During this timeframe, SCP-7591 was either created or discovered in secret by Thorley, who used it the same day.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nIt is pizza day, so the cafeteria is very crowded.\n\n\nHoover:\n Alex Thorley killed someone.\n\n\nSchantz:\n I knew it!\n\n\nHoover:\n Shhhhh!

The rest of the cafeteria guests begin to discuss the machinations of Thorley's murderous actions.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Lague and SCP-5595 enter the cafeteria and maneuver to the buffet line.\n\n\nLague:\n I don't need to tolerate this from you.\n\n\nSCP-5595:\n \nJUST LIKE YOU TOLERATE MURDER.\n\n\nLague:\n I told you to shut up.\n\n\nSCP-5595:\n \nOH, YOU'RE COVERING IT UP NOW, ARE YOU?

Thorley was told to be ready for transport by the end of the 25th. The following event took place on that date:\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\nThorley begins packing what little items they have, placing their work laptop, notebooks, loose pieces of paper, and a Rubik's Cube in a small shoulder bag.\n\n\nThorley goes to retrieve their clothing from their room's closet. As they open the door, a bloodied body falls out face first. Thorley is clearly startled and dashes to the opposite end of the room.\n\n\nSlowly, Thorley approaches the body, picking its arm up and rolling it over, revealing the body to belong to Alex Thorley.\n\n\nThorley stares at their corpse as they appear to calm down.\n\n\nThorley retrieves their phone and dials a three-digit number.\n\n\nThorley:\n Hey.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nThorley:\n It happened again.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nThorley:\n The closet this time.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nThorley:\n Yeah.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nThorley:\n Worse.\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nThorley:\n Everyone.
