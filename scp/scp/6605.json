If located, SCP-6605 is to be returned to Site-19's cold storage facility.\n\n\nFollowing Incident 6605-2 (see Addendum 6605-2), D-86753 is to be monitored by increased security detail until cleared and released into the public per standard D-Class amnestic release protocol.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6605 was the severed left foot of D-86753, which had been removed from the lower leg during an altercation at Stateville Correctional Facility in Crest Hill, Illinois. Despite being disconnected from any other sections of a human body, SCP-6605 is still capable of locomotion. Autopsy of SCP-6605 shows that the vessels and arteries of SCP-6605 continue to pump blood throughout SCP-6605 despite not being connected to a heart or any secondary method of blood production.\n\n\nSCP-6605 was first discovered while D-86753 was still a resident of Stateville Correctional Facility, after they engaged another resident in an argument which escalated to hand-to-hand combat. During the altercation, D-86753 produced a switchblade which was immediately taken by their opponent and used to cut into their left achilles tendon. After D-86753 collapsed, their opponent used the blade to cut through the cartilage connecting the tibia and fibula to the talus.\n1\n D-86753 was taken to the facility's infirmary where they recovered and received a prosthetic foot. SCP-6605 was brought to the Foundation's attention after SCP-6605 jumped from its temporary cold storage container and continued in the direction of the infirmary's exit despite the achilles tendon presumably still having been severed.\n\n\nD-86753 was admitted as a member of D-Class personnel in order to test for correlating anomalous phenomena.\n\n\nAddendum 6605-1:\n Incidents\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a06605-1\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Incident Report: 1/16/1985\n\n\nInvolved Items/Persons:\n SCP-6605, D-86753\n\n\nIncident Description:\n At 1235 hours, during the daily scheduled D-Class courtyard period, D-86753 shattered a window in Site-19's cold storage facility and was apprehended in the facility.\n2\n On inspection, SCP-6605 was found missing. D-86753 no longer wore a prosthetic but rather possessed a fully-functional left foot. D-86753 was interviewed, but showed no knowledge of how they arrived in the facility, nor the whereabouts of SCP-6605 or how they regained their foot. D-86753 was returned to their cell afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Incident\u00a06605-2\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Incident Report: 1/16/1985\n\n\nInvolved Items/Persons:\n D-86753, D-86753\n\n\nIncident Description:\n At 1247 hours, D-86753 was heard screaming from their cell. After inspection, D-86753 was found laying in their cell next to their own corpse. The corpse was identical to D-86753 except that its left foot had been severed and replaced with a prosthetic, and its neck had been slit open by a sharp object. D-86753 was found holding a shard of broken glass which had been covered in blood, presumably used to cut into the corpse's throat. D-86753's right arm was found to have been severed at the elbow. D-86753 was taken to the facility's infirmary, and the severed arm was taken to Site-19's cold storage facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. During the shock, D-86753 took the blade from their opponent and slit the opponent's throat.\n\n\n2\n. This occurred despite security footage showing D-86753 reading in the courtyard at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6604\n | SCP-6605 | \nSCP-6606\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6605\n\" by cwazzycwafter, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
