Any damage to the containment chamber must be repaired immediately. Containment Chamber #3942 must always be kept within the area of effect of at least two active Scranton Reality Anchors. No personnel are to enter Containment Chamber #3942 without prior approval from at least three on-site personnel with Level 4 or higher clearance.\n\n\nA minimum of four cooked trout must be deposited into Containment Chamber #3942 at least three times each day. Test subjects or personnel entering Containment Chamber #3942 are encouraged to deposit additional servings of trout, if able.\n\n\nD-24390 has been designated as a high-priority Person of Interest. D-24390, and all known associates, must be apprehended for interrogation.\n\n\nDescription:\n \nPENDING\n\n\nProvenance:\n Foundation agents were dispatched to Bingara, Australia on 27 June 2017 following reports of widespread panic and mass evacuation of the area. Questioning by attending agents was ineffective, as residents would not provide information explaining their panic or reason for evacuation; however, the agents were directed by civilians to several areas in and around the town.\n\n\nAfter requesting for assistance, the attending agents cooperated with Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\"); while inappropriate for the situation, the cooperation successfully minimised incurred injuries. MTF E-6 requested use of Containment Chamber #3942 (Approved), devising and initiating containment procedures upon arrival.\n\n\nThe surviving residents and ex-residents of Bingara were amnestised.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Testing Logs.\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 1\n\n\nSubject:\n D-24390\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-24390 instructed to enter Containment Chamber #3942, and remain inside for 30 minutes.\n\n\nResults:\n D-24390 enters Containment Chamber #3942.
