In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA's Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious \nHerald\n space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time \u2014 the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.\n\n\nAlterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to \nHerald\n as a counterpart to \nVoyager\n, usually replacing \nVoyager 2\n in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of \nVoyager 2\n are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of \nHerald\n, and what information is provided does not give any wider context.\n\n\nMentions of a 'Black Accusation' \u2014 a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by \nVoyager 1\n and \n2\n \u2014 are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 6088-1 (Alteration Log)\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a curated log of records altered by occurrences of SCP-6088. A full archive is available upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\"The director prefers\n Herald \nfor the name \u2014 he thinks it suits the intended purpose quite nicely, and I agree.\"\n\n\nSource:\n Internal NASA memo.\n\n\nOriginal Text:\n \n\"The director likes\n Voyager \nfor the name \u2014 he thinks it suits the project quite nicely, and I have to agree.\"\n\n\nWriter:\n Jonathan Cunningham, former project scientist for Voyager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[12m02s] Brazen Bull audio demonstration w/ volunteer Tom Hendrick.\n\n\n[09m19s] Kia quen audio demonstration w/ volunteer Hank Cotton.\n\n\n[03m51s] Schwedentrunk audio demonstration w/ volunteer Greta Harlister (requires re-record).\"\n\n\nSource:\n Manifest of audio content kept on Voyager's Golden Record.\n\n\nOriginal Text:\n \n\"[03m06s] Beatles'\n Here Comes The Sun \n(Have to wait for EMI to get back to us on this.)\"\n\n\nWriter:\n Unclear, no author listed on manifest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been reading over the records you want compiled onto the Accusation.
