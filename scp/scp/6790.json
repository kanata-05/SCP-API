Any other form of SCP-6790 or SCP-6790-1 found outside of containment is to be confiscated immediately.\n\n\nSCP-6790-1 is contained within a standard anomalous fauna containment kennel and is to be cared for similar to non-anomalous members of the \nAnas platyrhynchos\n.\nCommonly referred to as a Mallard Duck.\n species. Interviews with SCP-6790-1 are to be conducted bi-weekly, along with its psychological assessment.\n\n\nMTF Aleph-21 (\"fine customers\") are to continue their research on the PoI \"dado\".\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6790 is a powder-based narcotic closely resembling cocaine that, when ingested, causes the individual consuming the substance to instantaneously transform into a \nAnas platyrhynchos\n, hereby referred to as SCP-6790-1\n.\nCurrently, there's only one instance of SCP-6790 (\nSee Below\n).\n . The Foundation currently has no means by which to revert this, and the chemical study of SCP-6790 is ongoing.\n\n\nSCP-6790-1 is a \nAnas platyrhynchos\n previously known as Samuel Barlow, former mayor of Retrinald, New South Wales (Australia). SCP-6790-1 is capable of vocalization and contains a complete match for the human genome. SCP-6790-1 is otherwise non-anomalous.\n\n\nAddendum 6790 I:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-6790 was discovered after an investigation into the abnormal disappearance of one Samuel Barlow on September 9th, 2020. An investigation was performed by the Foundation Investigation Department. The local police were amnesticized and dismissed.\n\n\nThe investigation uncovered a small sample of SCP-6790 and SCP-6790-1 within the office of Mayor Barlow. Following an examination of the office, DNA samples were found, and the perpetrator was identified as Dean Conwell. The full supply of SCP-6790 was found after a raid on the before-mentioned individual's house.\n\n\nAddendum 6790 II:\n Recovered Conversation Log\n\n\n\n\n#hereisdado\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey uh, I hear you're the guy to call when you need something uh, medicine related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes hello this is dado how may i be of help 2 u?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRrrright.
