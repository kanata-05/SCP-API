SCP-6400 is neither to be obstructed nor penetrated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6400 is a circular window, currently located on the North-Western wall of Cell 2/23. It consists of a single circular pane of glass, with no gridding or opening mechanism.\n\n\nWhen damaged or obstructed from either end, SCP-6400 will disappear, reappearing in place of a nearby section of wall. The disappearance and subsequent reappearance of SCP-6400 appear to be instantaneous, and the area previously displaced is restored upon migration.\n\n\nSCP-6400 appears exclusively on exterior walls, with preference for rooms with little to no natural lighting. Offices, dormitories, and containment cells are frequently targeted by SCP-6400, comprising 94% of all manifestations.\n\n\nHumans and sapient entities within affected rooms are subject to a minor compulsion that semi-frequently directs them to look into SCP-6400. Time exposed to sunlight is negatively correlated with susceptibility to this effect, and those assigned an unrelated task are less susceptible than idle subjects at all levels. Among non-human and D-Class populations, weeping has been frequently observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 6400-A\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a photograph of SCP-6400, taken in its current position. Personnel are advised to report any lingering effects to the Department of Psychiatrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0Image\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-6400\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6400.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6399\n | SCP-6400 | \nSCP-6401\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6400\n\" by UraniumEmpire, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
