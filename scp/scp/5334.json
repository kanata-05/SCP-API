Published papers on observed anomalous activity are to be confiscated, and involved individuals dosed with Class-G amnestics.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5334 is a gaseous planet orbiting the star HD 44219, approximately 164 light years from Earth. SCP-5334 is roughly three-fifths the mass of Jupiter and is non-anomalous in composition, size, shape, or position. It orbits its host star at ~1.2 AU,\n1\n and possesses a single moon and ring system.\n\n\nSCP-5334's ring system is composed of ~2.7 billion glass bottles each containing various alcoholic beverages. Analysis of recovered bottles during an FTL Anomalous Exoplanet Survey suggest they are at least 800 years old, and each bottle's alcohol content is exceptionally high, ranging from 40-70%. The bottles have no discernible markings or identifying characteristics besides damage caused by micro-impacts.\n\n\nApproximately once every 200 days, roughly 20,000 to 150,000 glass bottles will spontaneously disappear from the ring system. Following this, SCP-5334 will undergo multiple erratic alterations to its orbit, deviating as wildly as 20 degrees from its stable configuration.\n2\n These erratic alterations will slowly become less prominent, and will eventually result in SCP-5334 returning to its original orbital path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-seven years after the anomaly was first observed, it underwent a radical change in behavior. The relevant logs have been attached below.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n October 5th, 2020, 1:42 UTC.\n\n\nNOTE:\n SCP-5334 had undergone a regular disappearance event only 54 days prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:00]\n |\n Approximately 50,000 bottles disappear from SCP-5334's ring.
