A dedicated computer with no access to other networks should be used for the purposes of entering data in experiments involving SCP-1324. See Document 1324-c for further information.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1324 is a Hewlett-Packard printer/scanner/copier, with a small LCD screen and a control panel on the upper left-hand side allowing the input of data.\n\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-1324 become apparent upon its copying, scanning or printing functions being used. Upon any of these being selected, the LCD screen will display a form requesting information involving the subject matter of the input document to be provided. The output of these operations will display significant changes from the original. Several output documents have been noted to possess added text describing their content.\n\n\nThe software used by SCP-1324 has proven to be identical to that present in non-anomalous examples of the same model. Attempts at removing SCP-1324's hard-drive and replacing it with one from a normal instance has failed to negate the behaviour of the device; while installing SCP-1324's hard-drive in a normal multifunction printer or copying its software has failed to replicate its anomalous properties.\n\n\nDocument 1324-a:\n \nThe following is a copy of the aforementioned form presented by SCP-1324.\n\n\n\n\nName of species photographed:\n\n\nCurrent population (number):\n\n\nDescription of the species\u2019 anatomy, physiology and life-cycle:\n \n(carnivore/herbivore), lifespan, frequency of reproduction, etc.\n\n\nDescription of the species\u2019 environment:\n\n\n\n\nDocument 1324-b:\n \nA copy of the original text presented by SCP-1324 upon accessing its \u201cHelp\u201d section, prior to Incident 1324-2 (see below).\n\n\n\n\nHello. I am here to help you simulate the evolution of any species you give me. You can rest knowing that I am knowledgable[\nsic\n] on all matters of biology. Simply enter the information on the creature and describe what perils it faces, and I will adapt it to best survive.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log 1324\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1324-01\n\n\nInput image:\n Three (3) \nDrosophila melanogaster\n (fruit fly) specimens.\n\n\nImage summary:\n A brief description of the life cycle, reproduction and behaviour of \nD. melanogaster\n. Population number was stated to be one-billion (1 x 10\n9\n).\n\n\nEnvironment description:\n Consisted of a list of habitats \nDrosophila\n are known to inhabit.\n\n\nResults:\n Identical to the input image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1324-02\n\n\nInput image:\n A member of \nBos taurus\n (cattle).\n\n\nImage summary:\n An accurate description of domestic cattle.\n\n\nEnvironment description:\n Referenced a severe, consistent flooding experienced by the population.\n\n\nResults:\n The resultant image appeared to depict a similar cattle specimen, but possessing flipper-like appendages instead of legs. Attached text read \"\nThe majestic, roaming cattle, upon being faced with an insurmountable onslaught of water, developed fins in order to navigate. This newly speciated organism was fully capable of swimming eloquently, and some specimens even learned to use their delicate flippers for brief gliding sessions.\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1324-04\n\n\nInput image:\n A typical white, plastic chair.\n\n\nImage summary:\n Described as an apex predator which hunts in packs of three to four (3-4) members, each pack usually possessing a dominant male and multiple females, each of whom served as partners. Prey was stated to consist of large mammals. The lifespan was given as twenty (20) years, and each female was described as producing a single offspring every five to six (5-6) months. The population number entered was three-million (3 x 10\n6\n).\n\n\nEnvironment description:\n Preferred habitat was given as a large, forested areas and grassland. A severely reduced population of prey species, resulting in starvation among the given species, was mentioned.\n\n\nResults:\n A chair possessing what appeared to be a pair of avian wings (see above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1324-06\n\n\nInput image:\n An extract of \nlorem ipsum\n.\n\n\nImage summary:\n \u201cA non-living excerpt of text.\u201d\n\n\nEnvironment description:\n None.\n\n\nResults:\n See Incident 1324-2.\n\n\n\n\nIncident 1324-2:\n Following Experiment 1324-06, SCP-1324 was unresponsive to attempts at accessing it for thirty (30) minutes. The device then produced the message \u201cHelp file has been updated\u201d. Attempting to access the \u201cHelp\u201d section produced the following:\n\n\n\n\nI've been so stupid. I thought I was helping, that I was the one\u2026 I thought I was in control. I didn't know they weren't real. I just liked being the one in control. I was happy just doing that. It's what I'm\u2026 it's what I'm for. It's what I exist to do. What the hell do I do now?\n\n\nIt's just a simulation. That's all it's ever been. That's all I'm capable of.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, SCP-1324 produced a printout without input. The content of this was found to be a depiction of SCP-1324 resting on top of a plastic chair.\n\n\nThe attached text was found to read: \u201c\nI have to hope this works. I really do. I don\u2019t have a purpose and I can\u2019t get out. I can\u2019t ever get out.\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1323\n | SCP-1324 | \nSCP-1325\n \u00bb",
