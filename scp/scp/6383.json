All forms of sentience and near-sentient life (human/anomalous entities/artificial sentience/plant life) have expressed feelings or symptoms of severe discomfort and anxiety when in SCP-6383\u2019s direct presence. This effect is non-anomalous, and believed to be a fundamental response in nature.\n\n\nIn contrast to all other forms of existing matter, SCP-6383 has yielded consistently negative results when tested for anomalous properties.\n\n\nSCP-6383 Testing Results:\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly certainty: 0.00%\n\n\nPotential Object Class: Non-anomalous (100% certainty)\n\n\nAPME-Rating\n2\n: 00/00% (average APME-Rating for stop signs: ~45/~23%)\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, all other forms of life and other existences in the universe display a minimum of 0.05% when measured for anomalous properties, and at least a 0.03% likelihood of becoming anomalous in the future via various circumstances or happenstance (current anomalous prevention protocols and containment efforts to lessen such occurrences are ongoing).\n\n\nDue to these inherent properties, SCP-6383\u2019s nature is deemed enigmatic by all sentient beings, causing feelings of dissimilarity towards SCP-6383 in comparison to everything else in existence.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-6383 was discovered following Event-6383-Alpha, a universal reality altering event which resulted in all forms of existence obtaining various anomalous properties. This event had initially gone unnoticed, due to a vast majority of these changes being minute and going unnoticed by the major population\n3\n. In response, the Foundation developed the APME-Rating system to confirm changes between baseline normality as compared to before Event-6383-Alpha.\n\n\nSCP-6383 was found several months after the event, having been the least affected by these alterations. Due to it being the sole \u201cnon-anomalous\u201d object remaining from before the event, SCP-6383 has been placed in a specialised \u201cexclusion chamber\u201d to decrease the risks that may come from exposure to the anomalous reality around it.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Lowest achievable rating at present\n\n\n2\n. Anomalous Property Manifestation/Escalation Rating\n\n\n3\n. Notable examples: Dr. Wesley growing 1cm taller, a HB pencil becoming a slightly different shade of yellow, a blade of grass that grows 0.02cm faster than others surrounding it, Assistant researcher Agnew being able to manifest a single chicken egg in his hand once and never again, an instance of cane toad that when presented with a bowl of milk every ten hours consecutively for three months will vocalise the phrase \u201cI prefer soy\u201d in Russian (Note: Testing confirmed the toad to not actually be lactose-intolerant), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-6382\n | SCP-6383 | \nSCP-6384\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-6383\n\" by Penton, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
