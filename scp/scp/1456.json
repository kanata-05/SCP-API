A Foundation outpost, disguised as a call centre, has been established in the town and is operated by TF-Omega 16 \u201cThe Contestants\u201d. The centre maintains \n60\n \n90\n 160 unique phone numbers, all publicly listed to Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Upon identification of instances of SCP-1456-1, the number presented is immediately called in sequence in order to intercept prize instances. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's listed residence and a block radius is to be monitored during active phases.\n\n\nA localized media campaign designed to discourage the population from entering the contests presented by SCP-1456-1 has been running for 16 years.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1456 is a series of anomalous phone-in contests advertised in print, radio, local television and billboards. The advertisements vary considerably in content, claiming to represent organizations both fictional and real presenting a contest or contests promising financial or physical prizes to winning callers. Each will predominately feature a unique phone number. Collectively, these advertisements are referred to as instances of SCP-1456-1.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-1456-1 appear spontaneously with no discernible external source. Billboards and print examples appear while the medium is unobserved, affecting sets of billboards owned by the same organizations and full runs of local newspapers and periodical simultaneously. Radio and television instances appear to replace regularly scheduled, legitimate advertisements. In either case, no discrepancies have been noted by the owners or operators of the transmission medium.\n\n\nCalling the number provided by SCP-1456-1 with a local phone number that has not yet been used to call in will result in a \u201cwin\u201d or \u201close\u201d result. Lose results are a simple tone, commonly described as \u201charsh\u201d or \u201cgrating\u201d, played three times before disconnection. A win result is a chime sound followed by a male voice announcing \u201cYou've won!\u201d. Attempting to call in multiple times with the same number will result in a continuous and increasingly loud instance of the \u201close\u201d sound, escalating with no known upper limit until the phone is disconnected.\n\n\nThree days after a successful \u201cwin\u201d result, a prize, loosely consistent with the advertised prize, will be delivered to the winner, defined as the owner of the phone number used to make the winning call. The prize appears at the residence of the winner through varying means depending on the contents, by methods both mundane and anomalous.\n\n\nSample Prize Instances:\n For a full list of recovered prize instances, refer to Document 1456-A.\n\n\nInstance 0054\n\n\n\n\nAdvertised Prize:\n 500 dollar cash prize.\n\n\nDelivery Mechanism:\n A homeless local deposited the prize on the doorstep of residence. When questioned, he could not recall the event.\n\n\nDelivered Prize:\n Five hundred dollars in assorted bills and small change in a blank envelope.\n\n\n\n\nInstance 0143\n\n\n\n\nAdvertised Prize:\n Non-specific cash prize\n\n\nDelivery Mechanism:\n Prize spontaneously manifested traveling at speed through the front window of the residence. Prize was contained inside plastic bag along with a brick.\n\n\nDelivered Prize:\n A stolen wallet belonging to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a local resident.\n\n\n\n\nInstance 0567\n\n\n\n\nAdvertised Prize:\n Trip to Rome\n\n\nDelivery Mechanism:\n A taxi was waiting at the curb the morning of delivery.

Driver refused to drive agent to the airport, and would not leave until paid.\n\n\n\n\nInstance 0985\n\n\n\n\nAdvertised Prize:\n Sports Car\n\n\nDelivery Mechanism:\n A truck belonging to an unidentified towing service delivered prize.
