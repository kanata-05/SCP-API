SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's anomalous properties are activated when it is irritated by another internet user or automated process.

These devices always differ and no connections have been identified. It has accounts on multiple services which it uses to interact with other users. These accounts have been replaced a total of 66 times in an attempt to avoid Foundation surveillance. Previously, it identified itself as Br\u00f3nach \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 but now uses pseudonyms with no correlation.\n\n\nKnown services used by SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n\n\nGMail[Replaced 16 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n\n\nFacebook\n[Deactivated and not replaced, 22/05/2016]\n\n\nYouTube[Replaced 12 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n\n\nMinecraft\n[Deactivated and not replaced, 25/01/2018]\n\n\nTwitter[Replaced 14 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n\n\nSkype\n[Account Abandoned, 14/8/2016]\n\n\nDiscord[Replaced 14 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n\n\nEpic Games\n[Replaced 5 times, Deactivated and not replaced, 13/05/2018]\n\n\nSteam.\n[Replaced 5 times, Deactivated and not replaced, 13/05/2018]\n\n\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 created its first known account on 08/06/2009 but did not display anomalous properties until 03/01/2015.

Should a change be noted, the cave is to be closed off from public access while repairs are made. Any individual coming into contact with SCP-5584 requires a loyalty score of 95% or higher.\n\n\nA camera and alarm system are positioned outside of SCP-5584-1's reach within its chamber. \nSCP-5584-1 spends approximately 23 hours a day sleeping so minimal observation is required.\n SCP-5584-1 requires no rest; should SCP-5584-1 attempt to enter a catatonic state, it is to be awoken immediately via the alarm.\n\n\nA whiteboard and an internet-accessible terminal with remote monitoring software installed are to be provided for communication and leisure. No audio surveillance is necessary. A single member of Foundation personnel with advanced experience in software development is to keep constant observation over SCP-5584-1's activities, switching out four times daily. The security personnel is to approve every action SCP-5584-1 makes on the terminal before a request is sent over the internet.\n\n\nIn the event this personnel becomes an instance of SCP-5584-1, backup incapable of reading \nboth English and Irish\n any language are to remove the original SCP-5584-1's terminal and whiteboard. The new instance of SCP-5584-1 is to be relocated and contained in a standard humanoid cell if possible, otherwise, the control room is to be retrofitted. The new instance of SCP-5584-1 will construct a word filter to prevent further transmission of the infohazard before regular containment returns.\n\n\nTwice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays, SCP-5584-1 is to be visited by Dr. Izem for cognitive behavioral therapy. SCP-5584-1 requires no sustenance and is capable of the majority of its own self-care. It is to be provided with the following supplies each week:\n\n\n\n\n1\u00a060mL bottle of shampoo\n\n\n1\u00a080mL bottle of conditioner\n\n\n1 bar of body wash\n\n\n1 portable shower system\n\n\n500L of freshwater\n\n\n1 black whiteboard marker replacement cartridge\n\n\n7\u00a060mg tablets of citalopram(One tablet administered orally once daily)\n\n\n7\u00a0100\u00a0mg tablets of quetiapine(One tablet administered orally once daily)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to the cave SCP-5584 is located in\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSCP-5584 is a carving in old Irish in the Ogham alphabet obscured behind SCP-5584-1\n2\n. Any individual who reads and comprehends the meaning of SCP-5584 is theorized to be converted into an instance of SCP-5584-1. Due to SCP-5584-1's body obscuring the full carving and its refusal to share the original meaning, further testing cannot be performed and the risk of personnel becoming an instance of SCP-5584-1 is minimal. However, should SCP-5584's meaning be spread to individuals liable to share it or posted to the internet, the resulting disruption event would be difficult to contain and potentially worldwide.\n\n\nOnly part of one line is visible behind SCP-5584-1: the phrase \"N\u00cdL A FHIOS AGA\"\n3\n. The final word of SCP-5584's visible line is partially obscured but can be assumed as a prepositional pronoun. The sentence is translated as: \"(You/I/You all/We) don't know\".\n\n\nOnly one instance of SCP-5584-1 is currently known and thus this individual will be referred to as such. SCP-5584-1 is a 29-year-old human female identified as Br\u00f3nach \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 fused to a wall in a concealed portion of Fingal's Cave on the Isle of Staffa, Scotland. It is attached by a web of flesh extending from the skin of its back. Its throat and jaw are split open and a large mass of approximately 200 tentacles extends from the hole. Due to the missing anatomy, SCP-5584-1 is mute. Its neck is broken and healed over, leaving it at an askew angle and severing its spinal cord. SCP-5584-1 cannot move or feel any part of its body from the neck down but has full control over the remaining parts of its face and the tentacles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of SCP-5584-1's tentacles with protractible tooth sockets visible.\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\nEach tentacle is between 3m to 4m long and 12cm to 20cm in diameter tapering to a flat paddle near the tip. Approximately 40cm down on each tentacle unilaterally is a row of 12 teeth that rest internally and can be protracted for use as weapons or to gain traction. Tentacles extend from the spinal cord located between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae.\n\n\nPeriodically SCP-5584-1 will attempt to enter a state of catatonia from which it is capable of telekinetic projection. It uses this to access the internet via unattended devices. This manifestation is hereby referred to as SCP-5584-2\n\n\nSCP-5584-2 can physically interact with and perceive its surroundings but cannot be perceived directly by others. If SCP-5584-2 is located within the 5-meter radius of SCP-5584 it is capable of teleporting where it pleases. If it has already teleported away from the range, it is only capable of teleporting back to SCP-5584. If SCP-5584-2 teleports while holding an object, the object will travel with it.\n\n\n\n\n+Documented\u00a0SCP-5584-2\u00a0Events\u00a0Correlated\u00a0to\u00a0Foundation\u00a0Actions\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31/12/2014\n\n\nFoundation makes initial contact and begins securing site\n\n\nSCP-5584-2 is absent from the internet for 3 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/01/2015\n\n\nSCP-5584-1 watches camera installed in the north corner of the containment chamber then enters a catatonic state for the first time since the start of containment.\n\n\nSCP-5584-2 teleports objects away from three internet users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17/02/2015\n\n\nInitial interviews with SCP-5584-1 is conducted by Dr. Mattias Brown following completion of site construction.\n\n\nSCP-5584-2 returns stolen objects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22/05/2016\n\n\nInterviews with SCP-5584-1 by Dr. Mattias Brown conclude.\n\n\nSCP-5584-2 teleports objects away from 1 internet user.

Dr. Brown: Jesus \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing Christ do we really need to show this? [Dr. Ellis displays the next image. SCP-5584-1 gestures hysterically towards the computer, wheezes, and produces a gurgling sound, presumably of distress. SCP-5584-1 stares at Dr. Brown with a pleading expression.]",
        "Dr. Ellis: What are you planning on doing SCP-5584-1? Spread the translation online? \u2026To harm yourself? I understand the stress of your situation, I do. We can help you feel better. Despite how frustrating working with you has been\u2026 even I don't want you miserable in containment. Dr. Brown: Dr. Ellis, please\u2026 [SCP-5584-1 looks away from Dr. Brown and turns towards the computer. It lashes toward the terminal in an attempt to destroy it. Dr. Brown takes a few steps closer to SCP-5584-1 holding his hands up.] Dr. Ellis: Hiding this from us to breach containment behind Dr. Brown's back is inexcusable! You clearly know you shouldn't be doing this. Why else would you try so hard to hide it?! Did you really think you were going to get away with this? Do you think we're that stupid ?! [SCP-5584-1 ceases attempts to destroy the computer and shifts its gaze between Dr. Ellis and Dr. Brown while producing gurgling noises. Tears form in its eyes. Dr. Brown moves towards the terminal.] Dr. Brown: With all due respect this has gone too f- [SCP-5584-1's tentacles go limp. The terminal is lifted telekinetically and thrown at high velocity at Dr. Ellis. Dr. Brown moves to Dr. Ellis and holds a hand up towards SCP-5584-1.] Dr. Brown: Please calm down! It's not worth it! Dr. Ellis: You\u2026 You think this is any way to prove you're fit to interact with the outside world unsupervised?! Even if you weren't a liability, even if you weren't stealing computers and vital hardware, you are acting like a child when we are just asking you questions! You are a grown woman! Act your \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing age! [SCP-5584-1 wheezes, gurgles, and begins to cry.] Dr. Brown: That is enough ! Florez cut the recording. Where's the medic?! <End Log> Closing Statement: Dr. Ellis required 5 stitches over her left supraorbital ridge and sustained a concussion but is expected to make a full recovery.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-5584-1 Interviewer: Dr. Mattias Brown, Level 3 Researcher Foreword: SCP-5584-1's whiteboard was returned following the previous interview. A second attempt was made by Dr. Brown exclusively. <Begin Log, 16/02/2019> [Dr. Brown gives a small smile. SCP-5584-1 avoids eye contact with Dr. Brown, stares at the whiteboard, and taps the still capped pen against it. Dr. Brown stops smiling.] Dr. Brown: You seemed upset\u2026. in those messages. That was\u2026 you\u2026 right? [SCP-5584-1 looks over to Dr. Brown then back to the whiteboard to uncap the pen and begin writing.] SCP-5584-1: Yes. Now go away. Dr. Brown: What? Dr. Ellis really messed up yesterday but don't you want to catch up a bit? DeNiro said you kept asking about me. [SCP-5584-1 does not respond.] Dr. Brown: I read some of those other messages. Good lord, you said some rude things about him , aye? [Dr. Brown laughs. SCP-5584-1 does not return his laughter.] SCP-5584-1: Do you have everything I said to my friends? Dr. Brown: It's standard procedure to keep records. SCP-5584-1: Of course it is. What about Percy? Am I ever going to get to talk to him again? Dr. Brown: Well you\u2026 you told him a lot he shouldn't know. We're going to have to\u2026 [Dr. Brown pauses.] Dr. Brown: I'll submit a request. <End Log> Closing Statement: SCP-5584-1 ceased communication following admission of guilt.",

    "description": "SCP-5584 is a carving in old Irish in the Ogham alphabet obscured behind SCP-5584-12. Any individual who reads and comprehends the meaning of SCP-5584 is theorized to be converted into an instance of SCP-5584-1. Due to SCP-5584-1's body obscuring the full carving and its refusal to share the original meaning, further testing cannot be performed and the risk of personnel becoming an instance of SCP-5584-1 is minimal. However, should SCP-5584's meaning be spread to individuals liable to share it or posted to the internet, the resulting disruption event would be difficult to contain and potentially worldwide.",
