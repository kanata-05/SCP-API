All active SCP-2873 components should be put into standby mode until further notice.\n\n\nTesting with SCP-2873 is strictly prohibited. Rehabilitation of active components pending approval.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2873 refers to a missile guidance assembly manufactured by Anderson Robotics, apparently a derivative work of [\nREDACTED\n] resulting in a less effective but highly miniaturized artificial intelligence system-on-a-chip. Individual SCP-2873 instances possess, on average, the intelligence level and personal development of adolescents.\n\n\nBased on recovered Anderson Robotics research materials and operation manuals, SCP-2873 instances exist in a simulation of education and indoctrination into nationalism, militarism, jingoism and self-sacrifice for a generalized, non-existent state. Out of the factory, SCP-2873 instances have simulated this pseudo-reality for fourteen years.\n\n\nAnderson Robotics testing resulted shows that the usage of these SCP-2873 chips as guidance units increased hit ratios by \u2588\u2588\u2588% while only slightly reducing overall reliability. However, operations manuals also discourage the use of SCP-2873 with chemical, biological, or radiological warheads due to this decreased reliability.\n\n\n\n\n+Intercept\u00a0Log\u00a02873-1\u00a0Level\u00a03/2873\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Authenticated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Raw process dump recovery established on via standard system troubleshooting per Anderson Robotics product manual.
