Terrariums are to be maintained as per standard for domestic rats, with a layer of pine shavings (cleaned weekly), a water bottle (changed daily), an exercise wheel, and standard toys for pet rats. Diet is to be standard nutritional pellets for rodents. All feeding and maintenance is to be carried out by hand; under no circumstances are automated feeding devices to be used.\n\n\nIn the event that the number of instances of SCP-2114 exceeds thirty (30) individuals, excess instance are to be euthanized and their remains incinerated. Any wild instances of SCP-2114 are to be destroyed. Male and female instances are to be kept strictly quarantined from each other except in the case of approved testing. Offspring of the original instances possess the same anomalous traits as their parents.\n\n\nAll tests involving SCP-2114 are to take place in rooms sealed from the outside; said testing rooms are not to be unsealed until all instances are contained or destroyed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2114 is the designation for a colony of \nRattus norvegicus\n originally discovered in a laboratory in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, in 20\u2588\u2588. They were acquired by Foundation agents pursuing reports of anomalous radio activity and an outbreak of auditory hallucinations.\n\n\nThe laboratory in question appeared to have been abandoned for less than \u2588 days. Investigation revealed that the laboratory was owned by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Incorporated, but company agents denied all knowledge of the location and its contents. The laboratory appeared to have been hastily stripped of all identifying material and much of its equipment. All of the remaining equipment was in a state of disrepair, as if it had been partially disassembled and/or destroyed. For a full list, see Document 2114-A\n\n\nWhen found, only \u2588 instances of SCP-2114 were alive, along with the material remains of \u2588 additional instances. All the instances were dyed with a two-digit number on the back, from \u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588 inclusive and \u2588\u2588 to \u2588\u2588 inclusive; this suggests at least \u2588\u2588 instances remain unaccounted for.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-2114 appear physically identical to the common white laboratory rat, and display normal behavior for their species. Examination has revealed no anomalous anatomical features, although slightly elevated levels of acetylcholine were present. It is assumed that SCP-2114 is cross-fertile with non-anomalous rats, but it is unknown whether their anomalous properties would be passed on to any offspring; testing is pending approval of the Site Director.\n\n\nWhen introduced to any sort of mechanism with complex moving parts, all instance will begin to examine it via vision, taste, and touch, including paws and vibrissae. After an \"examination period\" of 5-10 minutes, the instances will proceed to disassemble the mechanism, unscrewing screws and bolts, prying apart casings, disconnecting wires, and otherwise undoing all connections. SCP-2114 has been observed to use the minimum amount of force necessary to disassemble the target mechanism, and damage to the mechanism is rare and usually minor. Instances of SCP-2114 will cooperate to disassemble the target mechanism, displaying unusual levels of coordination, thus enabling them to manipulate objects too large and complex for a single rat.\n\n\nIf SCP-2114 finds themselves unable to effectively disassemble a mechanism, they may attempt minor, controlled damage; for example, soldered wires will be bitten through, and glued seams may be gnawed. In such cases, SCP-2114 appears to focus on gaining access to all the significant areas of the mechanism as opposed to complete disassembly.\n\n\nOnce the target mechanism has been disassembled, all present instances of SCP-2114 will examine the individual components with noses, paws, tongues and vibrissae, passing them back and forth among each other. This second \"examination period\" is usually of similar length to the initial 5-10 minute period, though it may be longer in the case of larger mechanisms.\n\n\nOnce the secondary examination period has been completed, SCP-2114 will proceed to reassemble the target mechanism. As with the disassembly process, all present instances will work together to reattach wires, insert pegs, and otherwise return the mechanism to its original state. In cases where SCP-2114 is physically unable to return the mechanism to its original state, it will be made as close as possible; for example, soldered wires that have been bitten off will be bent so as to maintain contact with their original contact points. Once the target mechanism has been reassembled to the best of SCP-2114's ability, the collective instances will appear to lose interest and resume normal rodent behavior.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588\n\n\nTest Mechanism:\n One electric clock-radio\n\n\nTest Subjects:\n Six (6) adult instances.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-2114 disassembled, examined, and reassembled clock-radio.
