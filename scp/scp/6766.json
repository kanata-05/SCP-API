The entity causes little to no disruption among the civilian population and its nature makes capture unfeasible and unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photograph of SCP-6766. It has been heavily screened to enable viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-6766 is a humanoid \nClass V Spectral Entity\n1\n of benign nature. There are usually over a thousand SCP-6766 manifestations occurring each day all over the world based on surveillance footage.\n\n\nSCP-6766 is approximately two metres in height and wears a black cloak concealing its body with its hood pulled over the head, obscuring its face. It possesses physical attributes that allow interactions with its environment. Additionally, SCP-6766 exhibits antimemetic properties which impede civilian and Foundation detection in most cases. During manifestations, the entity possesses a presumably wooden staff, over two metres in length, which appears to be charred. SCP-6766 has been noted to possess a skeletal body during its manifestations.\n\n\nThe majority of its manifestations occur at a graveyard, but others have been recorded in other areas marking the death of individuals. During SCP-6766 manifestations, the entity will emerge through a black viscous substance, manifesting in a nearby shadow. After fully materialising, the entity moves towards a gravestone\n2\n and proceeds to stand over it. In some instances, it produces a white cloth from within its cloak and attempts to clean the gravestone, removing any grime or dirt upon it. It then kneels and places an object or token in front of the gravestone before proceeding to stay stationary for approximately one minute. Following this period, it retreats to its manifestation point and collapses into the same black substance.\n\n\nAttempts to disrupt this routine have all been ineffective. When agents approached to apprehend SCP-6766, they stated to have undergone a great emotional episode and were thus unable to stop the entity. Agent Bacchus was one of the first individuals to have encountered SCP-6766 with anti-cognitohazard gear since the inception of its discovery. The entity had manifested at a graveyard nearby the recently established Site-175 and was swiftly detected by AICs reviewing the live footage of nearby surveillance cameras. An interview with the agent sent has been attached below.\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT:\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0attachment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Senior Researcher Jack Waelt\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Agent Ivy Bacchus\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n Alright, now, \n[sighs]\n could you please give me an explanation as to why you did not proceed with Command's instructions?\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n I, I dunno. I just couldn't\u2014\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n We missed the one damn shot to capture the thing. An uncontained anomaly. This site could've gone up the ranks in a fucking flash, and you\u2026 \n[groans and sighs]\n I'm, I'm sorry. Site administration work is just, really, like you know. Especially when we're new\u2026\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n It's alright.\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n I, \n[sighs]\n thank you. So let's begin with why exactly you did not follow our instructions as ordered. You won't be penalised. We just, we just need, like anything we can work with here and report. So tell us everything. Whatever happened, just say it.\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n I mean\u2026 I mean it was fine at first. We could see the thing, nothing was wrong. Nothing when I approached it either. Then I told it to turn around so we could detain it. \n[pauses]\n All it did was look at us, and\u2026 \n[remains silent for ten seconds]\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n Ivy? You\u2014\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n I, we, we were sad all over. It's just hard to describe you know. No, I just can't. It was like we were overwhelmed with sadness.\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n So you're saying this thing probably has mind-affecting properties? Probably empathic?\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n Listen Jack, I couldn't care less about the anomaly. The only thing on my mind was that, sadness. That, depression. It was like, this existential madness, and stopping it was something I mustn't do. I shouldn't try to disturb it, stop it. I felt that would've been rude\u2026 to them.\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n Who's them?\n\n\nAgent Bacchus:\n \nEveryone else, who's gone...\n \n[begins sobbing]\n\n\nDr Waelt:\n \n[hesitates]\n Uhm, okay. Er, thank you for your time Agent Bacchus. You'll be given paid leave for the next few days to rest and be quarantined.\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA log of several recorded SCP-6766 manifestations has been attached below.\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT:\u00a0SCP-6766\u00a0Manifestations\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0attachment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwner of headstone\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nAge of headstone\n\n\nObject retrieved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane McNab\n\n\nBuried in a prison cemetery.\n\n\n36 years\n\n\nA polaroid\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWei Yue\n\n\nA victim of matricide.\n\n\n125 years\n\n\nA few children's toy\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlo\u00efs Kaiser\n\n\nA soldier killed during the Second World War.\n5\n\n\n78 years\n\n\nA wristwatch\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunda Akinci\n\n\nA victim of maternal death.\n\n\n152 years\n\n\nA manuscript\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacques Snithson\n\n\nDied during the Great Influenza epidemic at the age of twelve.\n\n\n101 years\n\n\nA teddy bear\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoueauxseaux Jacquesson-Armistead\n\n\nThe gravestone was extensively vandalised.

They are discussing information of interest gathered by \nMobile Task Force Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\")\n pertaining to the \nChaos Insurgency\n following a raid on an uncovered compound. Several Keter class anomalies were discovered within the compound including some previously lost to raids by the Insurgency. The \nDepartment of Atypical Persuasion\n is currently interrogating the Insurgents captured.\n\n\nWhile consulting the possible uses of an anomaly recovered, a black viscous substance begins appearing on the centre of the round table. A figure rises from the substance. Screeners installed in the meeting room quickly neutralise the entity's antimemetic effects and SCP-6766 becomes visible.\n\n\nO5-4:\n Oh shit! Fuck is that?\n\n\nO5-6:\n Fire at it!\n\n\nAll O5s fire their thaumaturgic weapon implants at SCP-6766. It remains impervious and undamaged by the barrage.\n\n\nO5-2:\n Oi, Three! The hell is that? Is it something we've recorded?\n\n\nO5-3:\n Scanning files\u2026 Match, there is a 99.6 per cent chance that the entity is SCP-6766.

Call a containment team from Alpha-1.\n\n\nO5-3:\n Please note that SCP-6766 is a Class V Spectral Entity.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Class V?\n\n\nO5-13:\n Oh.\n\n\nO5-9:\n Shit, don't aggravate it. This could be dangerous.\n\n\nO5-7:\n Bit too late now ain't it?\n\n\nAll O5s are watching the entity and the barrier is pulled down. O5-1 then relaxes and addresses the entity\n\n\nO5-1:\n Uhm, is there any reason you have come here, to us?\n\n\nSCP-6766 twitches and looks towards O5-1's direction. It speaks in multiple amalgamated voices of different ages and genders, each voice displaced by a small duration of time.\n\n\nSCP-6766:\n You\u2026 have been taking them all\u2026\n\n\nO5-1:\n Huh?

The entity is sapient and may or may not pose a threat to living individuals. It is likely to have existed for multiple millennia, however, the reason for its prolonged life is unknown. It is probable that the entity has access to an undetermined pool of spectral energy, either within themselves or at an unidentified location.\n\n\n2\n. Said gravestones are usually over a hundred years of age. Though this is not always the case. The true pattern behind the gravestones visited by SCP-6766 is still undetermined.\n\n\n3\n. A picture of McNab's son, who had been killed two days prior to their arrest.\n\n\n4\n. Said toys were most commonly used in the era Wei was alive in. The toys were undamaged but in used condition.\n\n\n5\n. Kaiser enlisted in the army following the death of his parents during civilian bombing campaigns.\n\n\n6\n. The watch was broken and rusted beyond repair. Kaiser's initials were on the case back.\n\n\n7\n. The manuscript had aged quite considerably, requiring careful recovery, but was still readable. It held an unpublished poem written by Eren Akinci, Funda Akinci's son, about their mother's endeavours during childbirth.\n\n\n8\n. The toy was charred and mouldy throughout due to age. When SCP-6766 placed it on Jacqus' grave, \nthe object walked towards the headstone and hugged it\n. It has not been animate since recovery.\n\n\n9\n. The rock was fifteen centimetres in length and a crude child's painting of a small figure holding the hands of two other figures on either side was present on it when produced by SCP-6766. An analysis of the paint used also indicated an approximate age of 200 years.\n\n\n10\n.
