It is granted free roam privileges within designated low-risk zones of the facility, provided it does not attempt unauthorized access to restricted areas\n. As SCP-8128 has been reclassified to Neutralized, no special containment measures are required. SCP-8128 is to remain in a standard display case in Site-17\u2019s Non-Anomalous Object Storage for preservation. The recovered notebook and collar are stored alongside it.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8128 is a sentient taxidermy specimen of a domestic cat (Felis catus). It is a brown mackerel tabby with a dense, striped coat. The preserved specimen is in a curled resting position, though it is fully capable of movement, exhibiting typical feline locomotion, stretching, grooming behaviors, and even simulated biological functions.\n\n\nSCP-8128\u2019s exterior is composed primarily of tanned feline hide\n1\n, which is stretched and stitched over an internal structure. Analysis of this structure via X-ray and MRI scans has confirmed that there are no organic components or skeletal elements present. Only tightly packed wood wool (excelsior) and cotton stuffing. Despite its apparent fragility, SCP-8128 moves with the fluidity and coordination of a living cat, though it produces a faint rustling noise when in motion due to the shifting of internal stuffing.\n\n\nAround its neck, SCP-8128 wears a faded red leather collar. Affixed to the collar is a small, oxidized silver coin, etched with the words:\n\n\n\u201cBobby\u201d\n\n\n\u201c1932\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have loved and you were loved.\u201d\n\n\nThe collar is aged and cracked, and some areas show signs of splitting and dry rot. Despite the apparent brittleness, SCP-8128 has not exhibited any discomfort or attempts to remove it.\n\n\nAddendum 8128.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-8128 first came to the Foundation's attention on October 3rd, 2004, after multiple reports from residents of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Pennsylvania claimed to have seen a \"stuffed cat\" running loose in the neighborhood. Initial reports were dismissed as local pranks or misidentifications of a sickly stray. However, after a small group of children was witnessed chasing and throwing rocks at what was described as an \"old, messed-up cat that didn\u2019t bleed\", Foundation assets embedded in local law enforcement flagged the incident for investigation.\n\n\nAgents dispatched to the area located SCP-8128 in a dilapidated two-story house. The house was long abandoned and in the process of being condemned. The property was identified as the former residence of Elizabeth \u201cBetty\u201d Walker (1879\u20131950) and had been uninhabited for over five decades. SCP-8128 was found cowering beneath a collapsed wooden table, exhibiting signs of distress but making no attempt to flee when approached.\n\n\nThe structure where SCP-8128 was found was in a dilapidated state. An iron-barred pet cage that was heavily rusted and partially collapsed was discovered. Within the cage, a decayed leather-bound journal was found, containing only a single legible note written in faded blue ink:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey John, Aunt Betty passed away a week ago. We\u2019re moving some of her stuff out, and since you grew up with Bobby, we figured you should have him. They did a good job making him look alive. Visit us up north from time to time, we miss you. Take care. - Lukas, 1950.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nUpon containment, SCP-8128 exhibited a high level of affection toward Foundation personnel. It actively sought physical contact, such as rubbing against the agents' legs and purring audibly. No signs of hostility or aggression have ever been observed.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n Historical Analysis of SCP-8128\u2019s Post-Sentience Treatment and Repair\n\n\nFollowing an in-depth investigation into SCP-8128\u2019s history, it has become evident that the entity endured decades of cruelty prior to Foundation containment.\n\n\nEyewitness accounts from residents of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Pennsylvania , suggest that SCP-8128 was first seen exhibiting movement sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s as multiple individuals recalled stories of \"Old Betty\u2019s stuffed cat\" wandering the neighborhood.\n\n\nReports indicate that SCP-8128 was frequently chased, kicked, and thrown by children and teenagers. Many regarded it as an \"unholy thing,\" and \"a spawn of the devil,\" The question of when and how SCP-8128 first became sentient remains unanswered. Given the time frame of its known activity, it is possible that it only gained awareness after Betty\u2019s death.\n\n\n\n\nRepair Log:\n 04/12/2004\n\n\nSummary:\n Due to SCP-8128\u2019s deteriorating condition, on-site taxidermy specialists were assigned to conduct non-invasive preservation efforts.\n\n\nRepairs Conducted:\n\n\n1. Reinforced stitching along SCP-8128\u2019s underbelly and leg seams to prevent further separation of the hide.\n\n\n2. Application archival leather conditioner to SCP-8128\u2019s aged pelt.\n\n\n3. Glass eyes polished to remove minor clouding and surface scratches.\n\n\n4. Partial re-stuffing with acid-free cotton batting to reinforce structural integrity.\n\n\n5. Collar cleaned and treated with a specialized preservation wax to prevent further cracking.\n\n\n6. No internal modifications were made.\n\n\nDespite its deteriorated state, SCP-8128 did not exhibit any signs of pain during repairs and remained cooperative. It purred throughout the process and nudged researchers\u2019 hands when they paused.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3:\n Additional Items Recovered\n\n\nDuring a follow-up investigation at the site of SCP-8128\u2019s discovery, researchers recovered a small, brown, leather-bound notebook beneath the floorboards of the abandoned house. The cover bore the inscription:\n\n\n\u201cE.W.
