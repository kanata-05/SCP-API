As its anomalous effects only surface when a human subject plays SCP-2835 in a VCR, further viewing has been prohibited by the order of Dr. Naismith.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2835 is a VHS video cassette of a previously unreleased episode of \nThe Adventures of Paddy the Pelican\n, a short-lived WENR-TV cartoon series from the fall of 1950. The episode is titled \"Love Me, Do It!\"\n\n\nSCP-2835 is longer than the average episode of the show, running for 30 minutes as opposed to five minutes. Although the plot remains largely the same (Paddy the Pelican searching for his long-lost father), the content of SCP-2835 changes depending on the reaction of the viewer. The title character (referred to as 2835-1) will periodically interact with the viewers and prod them to express their opinion of the cartoon so far, often in a defensive, demanding, and threatening manner. Contrary to earlier episodes of the show, SCP-2835-1 displays characteristics of extreme paranoia and demands constant affirmation.\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 2835-D-2239\n\n\nViewer:\n D-2239\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n[Redacted for relevance]\n\n\nSCP-2835-1:\n So Freddy Fox knows who my real father is?
