How can I help you?\n\n\nDRAYTON: Hey Cody! I'm Leslie Drayton, calling from Site-64, and I wondered if we could talk about SCP-4353 for a minute.\n\n\nMACE: SCP-4353? I'm not familiar with it. Is that the \nvideo game full of cubes\n?\n\n\nDRAYTON: It's the lollipop\u2014\n\n\nMACE: Oh, I\u2026\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2014the lollipop you catalogued.\n\n\nMACE: You want to run some tests on the peppermint smell?

You're an SCP?\n\n\nDRAYTON: No, a TCD.\n\n\nMACE: I thought you said you were an SCP. Do you have a number?\n\n\nDRAYTON: I'm a TCD, a Technical Content Developer. I take care of the documentation. I wanted to ask\u2026\n\n\nMACE: What documentation?\n\n\nDRAYTON: The containment procedures. Things like, uh, I check for spelling errors, slang, clinical tone.\n\n\nMACE: Are you the woman who grabbed my shirt at coffee last week? Where are you?\n\n\nDRAYTON: I'm \u2014 I don't think so, I'm in Site 64. You're at Site 11?\n\n\nMACE: I was at Site 64 last week. You're the woman who grabbed my shirt at coffee.

TCDs aren't \u2014 we don't \u2014 we have to take amnestics each week because we need to edit everything, and we're not allowed to remember the things we've edited. What time did we speak?\n\n\nMACE: It was at coffee.\n\n\nDRAYTON: Around 11:30? Apparently I take my amnestics at 11:30, so \u2014\n\n\nMACE: I already told you, I don't want you changing my files.\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2014don't remember meeting you.\n\n\nMACE: What?\n\n\nDRAYTON: I don't remember meeting you.

Leslie Drayton?\n\n\nDRAYTON: Hey, that's right.

I'm sorry?\n\n\nMACE: I told you not to touch my files! How long have you worked here?\n\n\nDRAYTON: (\nlaughs\n) Well, it's kind of my first day?\n\n\nMACE: What? What did you just say to me? You're going to get someone killed and you're laughing?\n\n\nDRAYTON: No, I mean\u2026 I'm sorry. I'm a technical editor. We edit containment procedures for style, but we aren't allowed to keep our memories more than one week, and Monday morning is when I have to re-learn everything. If I've made a mistake I'm truly sorry and I want to make things right. Can I ask what edit I should fix?\n\n\nMACE: I've already fixed it.\n\n\nDRAYTON: OK, thank you. Can I ask for my records anyway, so I can make sure I don't make the same kind of mistake twice?\n\n\nMACE: Edit number seven-niner-oh-foxtrot-one-five-six-niner.\n\n\nDRAYTON: Thanks, let me just pull that up.\n\n\nThe sound of typing on a keyboard can be heard.\n\n\nDRAYTON: OK, I've got it here. I'd like to say sorry again for the wrong edit, it was an automated edit \u2014\n\n\nMACE: Who wrote the code? How does it work?\n\n\nDRAYTON: I'll check for you, sir, one moment. It was (\ntyping\n) oh, it was me. Uh, could I ask specifically what was wrong about the edit? I'd like to make sure my future edits are\u2026\n\n\nMACE: You shouldn't be touching my files.\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2026safe. Uh, OK.

What was that?\n\n\nMACE: I know what infohazards are!\n\n\nDRAYTON: OK, sir, to answer your previous question I've worked here for four and a half years, but because I'm a TCD I can only remember as far back as lunch on Friday. It looks like this automatic edit was applied to all Safe SCPs procedure docs that aren't tagged 'no edit' and that aren't tagged 'infohazard' \u2026\n\n\nMACE: You are not allowed to edit my files\u2026\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2026or 'memetic'. OK, sir. Maybe I could just say that this is a new project we're trying out. The only edit the automation would do is to move the words around, maybe add some tags\u2026\n\n\nMACE: No! I've told you three times now\u2026\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2026for clarity. Would you stop interrupting me?\n\n\nMACE: \u2026don't edit my files!

In fact, I'm not allowed to know anything classified at all, and I ask that you be careful not to tell me anything like that.\n\n\nDRAYTON: Oh, sure. Sure.\n\n\nMALONE: Do you know why we might be meeting today?\n\n\nDRAYTON: No, but\u2026 Am I in trouble?\n\n\nMALONE: Could you tell me about your relationship with Cody Mace?\n\n\nDRAYTON: I\u2026 can I use my laptop to check?\n\n\nMALONE: I'd rather you focus on the conversation, if that's OK with you. Just tell me in your own words whatever you think about Researcher Mace.\n\n\nDRAYTON: Right, sure. I don't remember meeting him.\n\n\nMALONE: You've never met him?\n\n\nDRAYTON: Well\u2026 I have to take these special drugs\u2026\n\n\nMALONE: Does Cody supply you with these drugs, Leslie?\n\n\nDRAYTON: No \u2014 it will be a different person each Friday. This week it's someone called \"Sara\". But these drugs are special\u2026\n\n\nMALONE: Let's keep on topic then, shall we? When did you last speak to Cody?\n\n\nDRAYTON: \u2026I'd prefer it if you didn't interrupt me.\n\n\nMALONE: Sorry, Leslie.
