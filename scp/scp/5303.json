One D-Class personnel linked to SCP-5303's sense of sight is to remain in the chamber, allowing for SCP-5303 to see its surroundings. This D-Class is not allowed to interact with SCP-5303 further.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5303 is a mute 1.6 meter tall female humanoid, the eye sockets of which are covered with skin. SCP-5303 is capable of seeing by hijacking the sense of sight from nearby individuals, allowing it to see from their perspective.\n\n\nSubjects under this effect are incapable of seeing their surroundings, and will instead perceive white light. Subjects will auditorily perceive the thoughts of SCP-5303 in this state, although a majority of its thoughts are unintelligible and incohesive. Comprehensible thoughts show that SCP-5303 has prominent feelings of romantic loneliness.\n\n\nPersonnel around SCP-5303 often report experiencing sensations of scopaesthesia\n1\n. These claims are currently under investigation.\n\n\nAddendum 5303-1 \u2014 Discovery:\n SCP-5303 was discovered on 2020/02/29, after a civilian hunter reported a sighting of a female without eyes or eye sockets in a Utah forest grove. Following this, Foundation agents cordoned off the area and placed an observation camera at the location to investigate the credibility of these reports.\n\n\nAt 20:04:30 on the same date, local college student Carl Neigiecie broke the perimeter and entered the surveillance area. The following was then recorded:\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n(\nNeigiecie sits on a tree branch for two minutes, appearing to be nervous. SCP-5303 emerges from an adjacent hole between several tree-roots, along with a large quantity of smoke.\n)\n\n\nNeigiecie:\n You're here!\n\n\n(\nNeigiecie stands. SCP-5303 walks over to Neigiecie, stopping in front of him.\n)\n\n\nNeigiecie:\n Finally. Now, okay, I know it's been long, I know. I've missed you. You missed me too?\n\n\n(\nSCP-5303 remains still.\n)\n\n\n\n\nNeigiecie:\n (\nChuckles.\n) You've always not been much of a talker. (\nPause.\n) Wait, shoot, I wrote a poem! I spent a bit on it, it's\u2026 it's not too good. But it's about you, I wrote it about you.\n\n\n(\nNeigiecie searches through his backpack. He becomes panicked, and dumps its contents on the ground.

He abruptly stops and turns around.\n)\n\n\nNeigiecie:\n Really?\n\n\n(\nNeigiecie stumbles back towards SCP-5303, tripping over a tree branch in the process.
