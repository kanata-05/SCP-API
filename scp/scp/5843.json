The nebulae of SCP-5843 exhibit functions similar to lacrimal secretion of the eyes, to prevent them from becoming irritated.\n\n\nSCP-5843 is capable of verbal communication using words that echo throughout its system. It is not yet known how it is capable of vocalizations, nor how the sound is able to travel through the vacuum of space. SCP-5843 learned human languages from observation alone prior to its education by Binary Star and therefore displayed a limited means of communication upon initial discovery. SCP-5843 is capable of observing events and communicate without delay.\n\n\nBecause of its observational skills, SCP-5843 has a vast knowledge of the universe, specifically of the orientation of the universe. It remembers the position of everything it has ever seen and has made a mental map. It has provided the Foundation with coordinates of other anomalies and Locations of Interest in exchange for English lessons to improve its speech. Files related to the given coordinates are listed below.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-3195\n \u2014 \"The Fault in Our Star\"\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-4524\n \u2014 \"A Flesh, New World\"\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-5364\n \u2014 \"Seventy Millimeter Projector\"\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-5623\n \u2014 \"Star Euthanizer\"\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-5979\n \u2014 \"Star Crossed Lovers\"\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\nFurther research in other coordinates is ongoing.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 25 February 1955, the Foundation launched probes from the \nBeholder\n line into space to detect and study extraterrestrial anomalies. On 27 June 1982, Beholder-8 ceased to function after collision with debris. After three days, Binary Star was able to reconnect to Beholder-8, but could not maneuver it anymore due to damaged equipment. After internal deliberation, the probe was set to alert status instead of active.\n\n\nOn 13 March 2015, Beholder-8 gave out an emergency signal when it suddenly experienced heavy gravitational pull. Upon re-activation, SCP-5843 was discovered and had put the probe in a stable orbit around its central eye. Staff was ordered to establish contact with the anomaly immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1: Interview Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview-5843-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5843\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Maurice Arkand and Site Director Maria Maxwells\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview happened after the initial discovery of the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, [13 March 2015]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n \nCrackling.\n This is-\n\nSCP-5843:\n Engg- glishh?\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Did it just\u2026 Answer? And without delay?\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n I- I guess. I did not expect it to know English. The probe's communications latency is probably under some effect of its system as well.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Let's continue. Standard procedure. I want to know if this thing is hostile.\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n \nCrackling.\n Hello, we a-\n\n\nThe central eye of SCP-5843 slowly begins to turn towards the probe.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Holy\u2026\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n My God.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Earrrth\u2026\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Give me the controls for a sec.\n\n\nDr. Arkand hands over the controls.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n \nCrackling.\n This is Earth. We'd like to ask you- \nPop.\n\n\nSeveral components on the controls light up and flicker.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n What the? What happened?\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n It popped. The transmitters here actually popped. We can hear and record everything, but we can't talk to it anymore.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Great, that's what we get for restarting this broken thing. Now, how are we supposed to-\n\n\nVoice:\n \nStatic.\n THIS IS EARTH. WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Wait, who-\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n Binary Star\u2026 I can't believe it.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n No way, it can't be that reliable, can it?\n\n\nThe central eye's iris narrows down and focuses.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Assk'.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n ARE YOU AWARE OF YOUR CURRENT STATE?\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Yesss.\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n This is actually happening\u2026\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Record this in every way possible. This is huge.\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n Actually, the AI is already backing this conversation up on the database as we speak.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Unbelievable\u2026\n\n\nBinary Star:\n DO YOU HAVE A NAME?\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Unn- ness- uh- serr- ee.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n UNNECESSARY.

I don't see much reason to stop it now.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Map.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n YOU MAP? WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU MAP ALREADY?\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Uu- ni- verr- sse.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n SO YOU ARE A CARTOGRAPHER. THEN DO YOU KNOW WHERE EARTH IS LOCATED?\n\n\nAll eyes of SCP-5843 slowly turn and face one direction.\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n Now, \nthat\n is unsettling.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Launchh.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n If that thing actually can see launches from that far away, it has some crazy visual acuity.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n DID YOU ALSO LEARN ENGLISH BY OBSERVING US?\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Finally, is it still recording?\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n Yeah, we're still good.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Inn- aw- duhh- bull.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n THAT EXPLAINS YOUR DIFFICULTIES WITH SPEECH.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Some- whhat.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n PERHAPS I CAN TEACH YOU IN EXCHA- \nStatic.\n\n\nSite Director Maxwells:\n Is the AI ok?\n\n\nDr. Arkand:\n Yeah, but the battery is still heavily damaged from the collision. Seems like there is not much energy left.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n DEPLOYING SOLAR PANELS.

Due to technical issues personnel is only able to hear the conversations between the Foundation AI and SCP-5843.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n\n\nThe eye narrows, slightly tilts, and begins to shine intenser as if it is focussing. A few minutes go by.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Inn- tree- guingg.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n THEN LET US START ALREADY.\n\n\nThe eye's iris dilates and begins to sparkle.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Ex- site- ingg.\n\n\n[Additional content cut for brevity.]\n\n\n\n\n<End Log, [27 April 2015]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-5843 was regarded as a non-hostile anomaly after this event.

The following conversation happened in-between a lesson about etymology and bastard words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, [2 November 2015]>\n\n\n\n\n\n[Unrelated information cut for brevity]\n\nBinary Star:\n WITNESS YOUR EYES SEEM TO DRIFT AWAY AGAIN.

WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR HIM?\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Every couple centuries.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n I ASSUME THAT WOULD BE REGULARLY FOR YOU. I DONT THINK THIS PROBE HAS THAT MUCH TIME LEFT.\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n Learn me coordinates.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n PLEASE CLARIFY.

All coordinates pointed to either, an already known anomaly, an anomaly that wasn't discovered before, or a yet unreachable location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview-5843-119\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5843 \"Wit\"\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Foundation AI \"Binary Star\"\n\n\nForeword:\n At the time of this event, SCP-5843 was able to speak full sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, [21 May 2016]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary Star:\n WIT CAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nSCP-5843:\n Loud and clearly.\n\n\nAn eye with a ring slowly turns towards the probe.\n\n\nBinary Star:\n YOU LOOK AS IF YOU ARE WEARING A MONOCLE.\n\n\nSCP-5843:\n I'd take that as a compliment.
