Agents or personnel who find clowns disturbing or not amusing must not be allowed to visit Site-2170.\n\n\nResearch personnel are to spend at least eight hours off-duty in Site-2170 before exposure to SCP-2170\n\n\nFor safety purposes, please view the following image inoculation before reading about SCP-2170:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\u00a0inoculation\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\u00a0viewing\u00a0time\u00a0is\u00a030\u00a0seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2170 are non-physical memetic entities which are experienced within the abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mine in Tonopah, NV. As memetic entities they exist within the senses of nearby sentient beings. Exposed personnel describe them as whispering voices and fleeting images.\n\n\nThe entities themselves are non-malicious and only seek interaction for the purpose of self-preservation, but exposure is detrimental to the long term physical and mental health of those who perceive them unless, for undetermined reasons, subjects have recently enjoyed thoughts about clowns.\n\n\nThere is no direct relation between clowns and SCP-2170 beyond this fact, and SCP-2170 expresses distaste for clown iconography.\n\n\nSymptoms of mild SCP-2170 exposure begin with an inability to accurately read written language due to auditory and visual hallucinations. Continued exposure results in paranoia, increased hostility, self-harming and seizures.\n\n\nSustained unprotected exposure to SCP-2170 leads to death in most cases except for individuals diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies.\n\n\nPlease view the following image inoculation before continuing:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\u00a0inoculation\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\u00a0viewing\u00a0time\u00a0is\u00a030\u00a0seconds\n\n\n\n\nsymptoms 100% lethal to adult males, after 24 hours body tissue becomes cancerous and generates sufficient heat to burn skin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2170 entities are dormant when not being perceived, and will cease to exist if not perceived on a regular basis. SCP-2170 enjoys regular communication with trained Foundation staff. Communication with SCP-2170 entities is best achieved indirectly via written messages. Although SCP-2170 cannot physically alter written material, they can alter a reader's perception sufficiently to communicate. This exposure is safe provided inoculation measures are carefully maintained.\n\n\nMost information regarding the history and nature of SCP-2170 has been given by the entities themselves. Local historical records do not corroborate the testimony of SCP-2170 and despite the benign nature of the entities no information that they provide is to be taken as fact until physically verified off-site by unexposed personnel.\n\n\nPlease view the following image inoculation before continuing:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\u00a0inoculation\n\n\n\n\nYou\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0feel\u00a0it,\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0happens\n\n\n\n\n[image]cute clown[/image] FILE NOT FOUND\n\n\n\n\nas memetic entities they are capable of existing within written documentation,\n \ntherefore all further references to SCP-2170 must be\n \ndeleted from Foundation records immediately\n specifically including new research regarding exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following material are communications and claims by SCP-2170 entities that have been transcribed by on site staff, including annotations from independent research. Please note that as SCP-2170 is memetic in nature even sanitized logs of communication with SCP-2170 can trigger symptoms of exposure. If you experience any feelings of unease or confusion please stare at the following emergency image inoculation to counteract SCP-2170 exposure:\n\n\n\n\nplease\u00a0DISPLAY\u00a0INOCULATION\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0own\u00a0safety\n\n\n\n\nwe\u00a0don't\u00a0like\u00a0it\u00a0either\n\n\n\n\nfragments of updated documentation remain, but corruption persists\n PLEASE PROCEED ALL IS WELL \nsubjects viewing old documentation with insufficient protection continue to suffer effects\n\n\nYou need to love clowns but nobody loves clowns not even us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nStatements from 2170 and context\n\n\nVerified/Not verified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1901\n\n\n\"Cracks in the night sky, falling stars open new world as they crumple in fire.\"\n Regarding first contact with human consciousness.
