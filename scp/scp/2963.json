Humidity of these cells is to be kept at 58%. SCP-2963-5 is to be fed once per day with liquid nutrient solution.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2963 refers to 7 distinct entities that formerly comprised D-3553-3, a D-Class individual previously used by researchers assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\n1\n under supervision of Dr. McCauley. D-3553-3 was converted into its current state during a failed containment attempt of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, which also resulted in the deaths of two additional D-class and four containment personnel.\n\nEach entity grows and functions as a non-anomalous organ system would. SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6 are able to speak in some capacity, despite lacking the necessary anatomy to do so. For records of such communications see sample interview logs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-1\n\n\nNervous System\n\n\nMost communicative instance, possesses personality very similar to D-3553-3\u2019s original personality. Able to locomote by pulling itself along horizontal surfaces, despite lacking necessary cell structure to do so. All nerve structures are intact and functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-2\n\n\nSkeletal System\n\n\nCommunicates very rarely, but appears to possess intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -3. Bones are held together in form of human skeleton by unknown force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-3\n\n\nMuscular System\n\n\nPossesses intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -2, communicates often. SCP-2963-3 is most prone to hostility and violence if provoked, and should be treated with caution. SCP-2963-3 typically maintains humanoid form, but is capable of moving as an amorphous mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-4\n\n\nCardiovascular and Respiratory Systems\n\n\nMoves in a similar fashion to SCP-2963-1, though it is able to scale sheer vertical surfaces. If SCP-2963-4 is deprived of oxygen, all 7 SCP-2963 entities will begin to suffocate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-5\n\n\nDigestive, Renal, and Excretory System\n\n\nSCP-2963-5 does not move, and is not believed to be self-aware. Entity must be fed a liquid nutrient solution in order to maintain entirety of SCP-2963. All waste produced by SCP-2963 is excreted by SCP-2963-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-6\n\n\nIntegumentary System\n2\n\n\nSCP-2963-6 is capable of communication, though does so rarely. Entity floats approximately one meter above ground by unknown means, and is capable of maneuvering through very small gaps. SCP-2963\u2019s containment chamber has been made airtight as a precaution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2963-7\n\n\nReproductive, Endocrine, and Immune Systems\n\n\nEntity moves similarly to terrestrial gastropods, with organs forming a foot to pull the instance forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are sample interview transcripts with SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6.\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0SCP-2963-1-4\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n At time of interview, SCP-2963 had been in containment for 2 months. Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, Senior Researcher assigned to SCP-2963, formerly assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and thus familiar with SCP-2963\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Hello again, how are you this morning?\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n Well, I still look like overcooked spaghetti and share a room with my own intestines, so you know, the usual.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Right. We have a few more questions for you today, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n Fire away.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n How much can you remember of your life prior to your current state?\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n You mean back when I was in one piece? All of it. Childhood, growing up, drug charges, other charges, death row, coming here, getting used like a lab-rat, and\u2026\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n And what?\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n And the kid. The bender kid.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n You mean \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n Yeah. Mark. That was his name.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Right. How much do you remember of your time assigned to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 team?\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n A lot. They used us to deal with the kid. I guess they were afraid of him. But the other Ds didn\u2019t talk much, but I got to know him pretty well. I liked him, good kid.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Until he tore your organs apart.\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n He was scared. What\u2019s a kid supposed to do when armed goons come after him?\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n They typically cry. He leveled a building.\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n An \nempty\n building! He wouldn\u2019t have done it if there were people there!\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n He killed six, and did this to you.\n\n\nSCP-2963-1:\n Because they were holding a gun to his head! He was scared! He\u2026he was just a kid. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Right. I think we can end here for now. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a0SCP-2963-3-5\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword:\n Interview conducted by Dr. McGann. SCP-2963 had been in containment for four months. Interview conducted through Plexiglas plate due to SCP-2963-3\u2019s history of violence.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Good afternoon, three.\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n Aaron. Don\u2019t use the number, I\u2019m not a D anymore.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n No, just a scp. 2963\n-3\n.\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n Use my damn name. You motherfuckers are the reason I got this way.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n No, that would be SC-\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault. You can\u2019t be mad at a bomb for going off. Especially if you planted it.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Quaint. We have a few more questions for you, if you\u2019ll cooperate.\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n Fire away.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Well as you know, we\u2019ve determined that D-3553-3\u2019s original personality was\u2026fragmented by the incident that resulted in your creation.\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n That\u2019s what you keep saying, yeah. I don\u2019t buy it. I\u2019m still me.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Partially. As far as we can tell it\u2019s -1 who got D-3553-3\u2019s original personality. You\u2019re close, but you display markedly higher aggression, host-\n\n\nSCP-2963-3:\n Maybe I\u2019m aggressive because I\u2019m a fucking meat-puppet! Because you sons of bitches made me this way! Because that judge had it in for me! Because the last 6 fucking years have been nothing but tests and labor and the inside of a cell! Because you killed the fucking kid, because you-\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Enough, -3.\n\n\nSCP-2963-3 throws itself at the glass, attempting to break through. During this, SCP-2963-3 screams unintelligibly.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Right, I think that\u2019ll be it for today then.

SCP-2963-2 requested an interview - request was granted as this was only the second attempt at communication -2 had made thus far.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Good evening, can I ask why you\u2019ve asked for this interview?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I have information.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Okay, did you not have this information when we tried to interview you previously?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n Yes.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Why didn\u2019t you tell us before?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I did not think it relevant.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Ok, what do you have to tell us?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I do not know who we are.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n We? You mean the rest of you?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n Yes. The Brain knows. The Muscle knows. I do not. The Skin does not. The others do not know enough to know anything.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Do you mean you possesses a separate memory from -1 and -3?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I do not remember living as the person we are.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n So your memories start after separation?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n No.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n What? What do you remember?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I remember a life. A different life. The details are faded. I think it was a place far away.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n And you believe you and -6 came from this other person?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n No. I did. The Skin is something else. From somewhere else. A shaper of flesh. A god-eater.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n I see. Do you have any idea why you were chosen for this? How you were pulled into D-3553-3's skeleton?\n\n\nSCP-2963-2:\n I believe we were tangent to this world. When the child was killed, it released an enormous amount of energy that tore through such barriers, and brought us here.\n\n\nDr. McGann:\n Ah. Well this is a lot of information to process.
