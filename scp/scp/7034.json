The file will be updated accordingly upon Foundation access to SCP-7034.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterstate Highway I-85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The exit ramp purportedly leading to SCP-7034 has been temporarily barred from public access for Foundation assessment. Further action is pending discovery of a conclusive entrance to SCP-7034, or lack thereof.\n\n\nThe Foundation is conducting an ongoing appraisal of the United States Interstate Highway System in an attempt to discern potential access points to SCP-7034. If necessary, efforts may expand to be global in scope.\n\n\nInformation regarding missing persons cases related to the United States Interstate Highway System is to be suppressed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7034 is an extradimensional space of indeterminate length, unverified composition, and unknown features.\n\n\nAccording to the sole account of SCP-7034, the space resembles a controlled-access interstate highway. It contains a single stretch of paved road, featuring eight lanes cordoned by guard-rails on each side. Other features, including those present beyond the guard railing, are indiscernible due to a heavy smog that lays over the area. Electronic signals, such as cellular service or internet access, are apparently impeded inside SCP-7034.\n\n\nSCP-7034 is highly congested with traffic, with all lanes occupied by vehicles of various make and model. The length of this congestion, including its end point, is unknown. Attempts to identify these vehicles via license plate numbers have been met with varying degrees of success. A number of automobiles align with missing persons reports, though some are geographically disparate from the supposed access point to SCP-7034.\n\n\nThe means by which SCP-7034 can be accessed remain unclear. The Foundation became aware of SCP-7034 following the disappearance of Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia, who entered SCP-7034 after emerging from a tunnel while commuting on interstate highway I-85 on December 3rd, 2022. Battaglia established contact with the Foundation several hours into the congestion, suspecting that he was experiencing an anomaly.\n\n\nAddendum.7034.1:\n Received Transmissions\n\n\nThe following are transcripts of recordings sent from Richard Battaglia to the Foundation via an emergency-use one-way communicator, a paratechnical device issued to select personnel in the event that traditional communication is impossible.\n\n\n\n\nTest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOkay, we\u2019re green. This is Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia, Area-179, Department of Containment. Don\u2019t know who at the mothership is going to be receiving this, but the emergency kit paid off. None of you can make fun of me for lugging it around anymore, okay? (\nLaughs\n)\n\n\nIf this is just an ordinary traffic jam, uh, just disregard. You can take all the piss you want once I get back.\n\n\nNot sure where I am. I\u2019m on my way home to Gainesville for Christmas and it\u2019s been awhile since I was on these roads. Uh, about\u2026 I want to say, an hour past state lines, I got out of a tunnel on I-85, and rolled up to a detour like normal, thinking \u201cShit, of course.\u201d\n\n\nBut I\u2019ve been stuck in traffic for\u2026 it\u2019s got to be ten hours now. Hard to tell with the fog. We\u2019re moving forward, but barely. Phone doesn\u2019t work. Pissed in a bottle twice already. I\u2019m about half a tank full, so I should be good there, but\u2013\n\n\n(\nA truck horn is heard in the distance.\n)\n\n\nAgain, Dr. Richard Battaglia, Department of Containment. I came off exit 242 on I-85. I'll keep in touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix in the morning. Still as dark as it was at midnight. Fog\u2019s not lifting, either. I tried to\u2013 (\nCoughing\n) Shit. I tried to roll the window down but there\u2019s this fucking awful smell. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exhaust or what. Christ. (\nBattaglia slaps his chest, coughing more.\n)\n\n\nI fell asleep a little, but the row ahead moved forward, like, an inch, so this knucklehead behind me just laid on the fucking horn. (\nPause\n) Cars are just building up, you can see it in the rearview.\n\n\nExit 242, I-85. Send someone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen o\u2019clock. The sky\u2013 not even exaggerating\u2013 the sky is still fucking black. I thought it was night at first, but\u2013 (\nBattaglia groans in frustration\n)\n\n\nI should be hugging my kid now, you know. Had a whole\u2026 a whole surprise day planned out for him since daddy was finally coming home from work. And I know she\u2019s been getting him excited for it, too. (\nSighs\n) What a fucking joke.\n\n\n\u2026 I\u2019m tired. Everyone here has to be. Staying awake with an energy drink and some old nu-metal CDs I haven\u2019t listened to since college. Yeah, I busted out the CDs. I\u2019m trying to squeeze my way onto the shoulder, but I don\u2019t think there is one. Just a far lane that\u2019s as packed as the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nSounds of horns are heard. Battaglia drums his fingers on the wheel to the beat of muted music coming from his vehicle\u2019s sound system..\n)\n\n\nThis guy just got rear-ended, uh, just now. Must have fallen asleep or something. Jesus. He\u2019s moving forward now, but wow. Wow.\n\n\nShould be fine for another few hours, I think. I\u2019ve stayed up longer, and this caffeine\u2019s putting work in. Other than that\u2026 same old, same old. Kiddo\u2019s probably up and asking what the surprise is. If I had to guess, Bree\u2019s called me at least a hundred times.\n\n\n(\nTrailing\n) My legs are fucking killing me, man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nCoughing\n) Christ, are you fucking kidding me? I can\u2019t even step out of the goddamned car. Exhaust. Fumes. It's everywhere. I mean, take one breath and the tears start welling while your lungs feel like they\u2019re seconds away from popping. Soon as I opened the door, just barely, so I didn\u2019t hit the car next to me, these fucks behind me flipped their lids. Honking, throwing their hands up, waving me back.\n\n\n(\nBattaglia punches the wheel, groaning in anger.\n)\n\n\nHow the fuck is this fair? I mean, on my way home. On my break. After a year of\u2026 nothing but paperwork and bullshit, I can\u2019t even spend time with my fucking family! (\nStuttering\n) A\u2013And to be stuck like this without, you know, food or water, or anything\u2013 I-I just don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do. I don\u2019t have field experience. I\u2019m not a soldier. I can\u2019t even fucking turn back if I wanted to, there\u2019s no room. There\u2019s\u2013 there\u2019s people all around me and they can\u2019t get out either, and\u2013 (\nHyperventilating\n)\n\n\n(\nBattaglia\u2019s breathing becomes labored. His exclamations are cut short.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry about\u2026 what I think I sent last night. I forget what I said. But it\u2019s been two days now. On the dot. I\u2019m living off a sip of water every six hours, no clue what anyone else is doing to fuel themselves. Haven\u2019t slept more than an hour before someone lays on the horn. It's all they seem to care about. Just moving forward.\n\n\n(\nSighs\n) The part of this that really fucks me up, is that if we *all* stepped out, we\u2019d be able to communicate with one another and\u2026 and maybe figure something out. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never talked to people. Organized things. I thought by now\u2026 you\u2019d think someone would have fucking done something, right?\n\n\nGoing to see if I can talk to the driver next to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nSounds of a window rolling down are heard. For the next ten minutes, wind, horns, and engines are heard above the sound of Battaglia speaking to another individual. The audio is largely irrelevant or indiscernible. The window rolls up.\n)\n\n\nDon\u2019t know if you got that. Been shouting through the windows the past few hours. Rolling them up and down every few minutes to offset the smog. Guy next to me is named Micheal, older guy. Got here off a different highway entirely, I-70. I'll get you his plate, hold on.\n\n\nSo, we\u2019re planning something. I\u2019m in the lane furthest to the right. If I was able to talk to him, he could talk to the driver next to him, and so on. Eventually, we\u2019ll have an entire row of cars that are willing to get out of their cars, right? And maybe if we all stop, the lane behind us will too. (\nPause\n) Or they won\u2019t, and they\u2019ll run us down the second the doors open. Worst case scenario? I have a gun.\n\n\n(\nExhales\n) I just need this to work. I\u2019m starving, I\u2019m\u2026 fucking scared. Bree\u2019s probably losing her mind over this. Yeah, it\u2019s not like you would fucking tell her what\u2019s happening, would you? We just need this to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\u2026 Micheal got through to the person next to him. And they\u2019re getting through to the car on their left. We might be able to pull this off. If this is my last message, I\u2019m either a pile of guts on the road or I died of a pulled muscle after sitting in my car for so fucking long. But it won\u2019t be, because we\u2019re getting out of here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(\nLaughs\n) Wow, that went better than I expected. I\u2019m laying down in the backseat right now. Fucking finally. Let me, uh\u2026 I\u2019m figuring out where to start. (\nCoughs\n)\n\n\nI hopped out of the car as soon as we stopped, gun in my pocket. Immediately the idiot behind me slammed on the horn, but they cut that out when they saw Micheal open his door too, and the woman next to him, and the one next to her. And then eventually, everyone in our row was standing in the road. The fumes choked the hell out of us, and\u2026 it\u2019s fucking scorching out there, too, but no one got back in.\n\n\nThen that row behind us funneled out. Ordinary people, each of them just as scared and tired and unwashed as the rest of us. That was\u2026 a major relief, honestly. I was half expecting monsters or something. (\nLaughs\n)\n\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to stay out in the open for more than ten minutes. Some folded in less. The air\u2019s too much. But we did organize a plan. People who wanted to move forward, they did so. Kept driving. The rest of us set up our cars in a sort of barricade along the road, leaving only the middle lane open for people to pass through. Such a fucking relief to be able to turn the car off and lay down in the back seat.\n\n\nAnd\u2026 that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no long term plan. I mean, there can\u2019t be. We\u2019ve secured some supplies from tractor trailers who\u2019ve come by. Warm water and soda. But we\u2019re screwed when it comes to anything else. Without refrigeration or electricity, we\u2019ll last a few days, at most. The air outside is a problem, but I\u2019m struggling to think of a solution. We either suffocate in a cramped car, or choke on exhaust. Problem for tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nBattaglia\u2019s voice echos. Others are heard speaking in the background.\n)\n\n\nSlept for the first time in days. I mean, I really slept. An eighteen-wheeler joined up, and I\u2019m recording this while sweating my ass off in the back. Somehow, it\u2019s still cooler here than it is out there.\n\n\nWe have a big enough space for a group to talk, at least for a bit. There\u2019s no consensus on what's happening here. Some say it\u2019s purgatory. Others aren\u2019t convinced it's supernatural. One woman thinks it's a dream. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m trying my hardest to tell everyone to keep their heads up, that help is coming, but it's been four days now, and I don\u2019t know if it is.\n\n\nI know these are going through, but I'm assuming you haven\u2019t found a way in yet. Or if you have, you\u2019re too far back in that fucking jam to reach me. I\u2019m going to try and keep our group together, so if you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll know where to find me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(\nCoughing\n) We made a pulley system from a tow truck. See, over the guard rails, there\u2019s just a bunch of fog, but\u2026 who knows what\u2019s through it. Fuck, my chest. It\u2019s worth a shot, right? Boilerplate final message, you know the deal. I\u2019ll be fine. Gotta get used to these fumes. Masks help, actually. A real COVID freak was stocked up on boxes in the back of her car. Makes it a little more tolerable.\n\n\nOnce we get out of this, I\u2019m living in the shower for the next month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nShuffling sounds\n)\n\n\nHey. Late message, I know. Was busy today. Got lowered over the railing.\n\n\nThere was about three hundred feet of rope\u2013 still couldn\u2019t see the bottom. Just fog, and a smell that got worse the lower you went. Hotter, too. I puked three\u2026 four times.\n\n\nI wanted to unhook myself, honestly. Just fall into the mist and see where I ended up, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I still want to get out of here, man. I love you\u2013 I mean. Fuck. (\nVoice weakens\n) I love my family. I\u2019m going to see them again. I know I will. But if I don\u2019t move forward, get back on the road, I\u2019m going to die. We\u2019re fucking starving. We have some water, but\u2026 we\u2019re wasting our time in one place. Have to move forward. Have to.\n\n\n(\nBattaglia sobs for an extended duration before collecting himself.\n)\n\n\nWhen they pulled me up, and I told them\u2026 I told them there was nothing down there, I could see the same realization settling in on their faces. (\nPause\n) Some were still optimistic, sure. The number of incoming cars had slowed down to the point where you could feasibly ride along the far lane without issue. According to my car, I drove just under 190 miles in two days, in completely stagnated traffic. With a clear road, I could do that in a few hours. Maybe there was a way out, the way we came in. I took someone\u2019s motorcycle, and just set off.\n\n\nI rode for hours, but\u2026 you can\u2019t recognize anything in here. No landmarks, no markings. Just a road that stretched on, forever. No matter how far I got, I was\u2026 here. But even with a helmet and a mask, the smog was too much. Had to stop and lay down twice. Could have gotten killed.\n\n\nNothing had to be said when I got back to the group. Some came out of their cars. Most just stared at me through the windows. They all wore those same tired, helpless faces, only this time, even under the masks, there wasn\u2019t a shred of hope left on any of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are starting to leave. Wondering whether or not I should follow. Had a meeting in the rig, decided it was for the best. We can cooperate all we\u2019d like, but we\u2019re wasting time we could be using to move forward. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re not in our cars most of the day anyways. God knows how much shit I inhaled yesterday.\n\n\nThere\u2019s what lays ahead, and whatever sits at the end of it, even if it's nothing. I could stay here and starve. I could hurl myself over the edge of the railing, too.\n\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, Shaun. Bree. I love you. I\u2019m going to see you again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nBattaglia is engaged in conversation with another individual, presumably \u2018Micheal\u2019. He does not appear to initially notice that the device is recording.\n)\n\n\nBattaglia:\n His birthday is the week after Christmas, so.\n\n\nMicheal:\n Oh, so you get to skimp on the gifts?\n\n\n(\nThey both laugh.\n)\n\n\nBattaglia:\n I always promised my wife I\u2019d never do that. My brother was a December baby, I totally understood.\n\n\nMicheal:\n Yeah. (\nPause\n) God, you wonder how some of these other folks are doing it? The people who didn\u2019t stop, where are they getting their water?\n\n\nBattaglia:\n Maybe there\u2019s a rest-stop. Little taco-bell or something.\n\n\n(\nMicheal laughs.\n)\n\n\nBattaglia:\n Um, honestly, if they didn\u2019t do something similar to what we did, just to refuel, then they probably didn\u2019t make it. We\u2019ll see, I guess.\n\n\nMicheal:\n Yes, we will. At least the traffic cleared up.\n\n\nBattaglia:\n For now, yeah. That was the worst, man. When I was out there I kept telling myself that the next time I\u2019d fall asleep it\u2019d be in my own bed, right next to my wife.\n\n\n(\nMicheal sighs.\n)\n\n\nBattaglia:\n Hey, watch those sips. We only have a case back there.\n\n\n(\nBattaglia takes notice of the recorder, and shuts it off.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, I\u2019m\u2026 finally on the road again. It came down to four of us in the group. Micheal, myself, and two sisters, college girls. We\u2019re all riding together. Not in the same car, you know, but\u2026 we\u2019re around. Easier in case something happens. Like if this piece of shit car dies.\n\n\nThe road\u2019s clear. No traffic. Still black as hell, but we\u2019re covering ground. We did over\u2026 400 miles today. There\u2019s so many cars parked on the sides. I don\u2019t know if they did something similar to what we did or\u2014 or they\u2019re dead, but if they didn\u2019t have water, then\u2026\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find. I\u2019m not\u2026 remotely prepared for bodies, and death, and all of that. I never saw a man die in my twenty years at the Foundation. That\u2019s got to be a record. But all we can do is move forward. There has to be an end. I can\u2019t just\u2026 I\u2019m going to hold out for as long as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings are getting worse. Saw a car in the middle of the lane, the driver was slumped over the wheel, laying on the horn. That\u2019s someone who\u2019s never going home. Whose family and friends are\u2013 they\u2019re going to be wondering where he is. What the last thing he said to them was. (\nVoice weakens.\n)\n\n\nI miss you. I love you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning out of gas. Going to have to hop into Micheal\u2019s car, or the girls. Or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. At night, there\u2019s cars parked along the side, and\u2026 No, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not going to do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe scavenged some food today, believe it or not. Someone blew the tires out on a tractor trailer marked as a supermarket distribution truck. Whole thing was on its side in the middle of the road. Half of the food was gone, and most of it was rotting, but\u2026 it\u2019s something. Didn\u2019t look for the driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not fucking equipped to handle this shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck. One of the girls\u2013 the sisters, uh, Euliana. She killed herself while we were sleeping. I was watching the cars, she just ran out of the fucking\u2026 out of the car and jumped off the side. And I fucking watched her. By the time I tried to move she was over the edge. And her sister\u2019s a wreck now. Micheal\u2019s with her. But she just did it. We\u2019re\u2026 goddamnit. Who cares? Who even cares?\n\n\n(\nBattaglia cries for the duration of the recording.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love you. Good night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of fuel. With Micheal now. Valentina is behind us, her car\u2019s still running. Poor girl. Yeah, I fucking told Micheal what I\u2019m doing. Who\u2013 Who cares? Amnesticize him when we make it out. I don\u2019t give a shit anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrain\u2019s getting worse. More crashes, some bodies. Bodies\u2026 Uh\u2026 (\nTrails\n)\n\n\nSaw some fuck with a flat tire stuck in the middle of the lane. I think he was part of our group from a few days back. Tried to flag us down, but he\u2019s more weight. We\u2019re already hurting for fuel. It\u2019s not like we couldn\u2019t have helped him. Micheal has a spare in the back. We have to move it from view when we get a chance\u2013 saw someone get raided the other night for theirs. We have problems of my own, like this fucking engine. Keeps fucking sputtering, and my knees are practically cooking from the heat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe fired a shot at us\u2013 some bastard firing behind his car. Sounded like a rifle, but I don\u2019t know. I took out one of their tires. Didn\u2019t fuck with me after that. There\u2019s easier targets to hold up than the guy who can fire back. Unless they have a spare, or take one from someone who does, they\u2019re screwed, but that\u2019s how it is here. I feel like scum. I don\u2019t even regret what I did. That\u2019s why. Hold on, I have to focus. Smog\u2019s getting thicker. Micheal\u2019s out, yeah. We\u2019re just driving in shifts instead of parking to sleep. Can\u2019t waste time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love you. I miss you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nYelling\n) Shit! We\u2019re out of gas. Don\u2019t know where Valentina is. I\u2013 I guess we just lost track of her. She was behind us a few hours ago, I\u2026 It\u2019s so hard to see with the fumes. Food\u2019s all bad too. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. There\u2019s never a car too far away, but\u2026 goddamnit. I don\u2019t want to fucking do this, man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot fuel. I don\u2019t care. They would have done the same to us. I didn\u2019t hurt anyone. I wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. Just happened to be the guy with the gun. It\u2019ll get me another couple hundred miles, as long as I don\u2019t hit that congestion again. I think Micheal wants to ditch me. He\u2019d be a fucking idiot if he tried to pull anything when I\u2019m the one with the gun. I don\u2019t even close my eyes around him anymore. I don\u2019t fucking trust him anymore. That\u2019s reasonable, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has to be over a week and\u2026 no, two weeks. That means\u2026 I missed Christmas, yeah. I\u2019m sorry, buddy. Daddy\u2019s sorry. I\u2019m going to make it up to you, I promise. When I get out of here, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve made enough money. I\u2019m taking my package early and I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life with you. I promise, I promise. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not going to let you down ever again. Please, God, please, just let me out of this. Ple\u2014 God, Let me out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s dead. Figuring something out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad to drop Micheal\u2019s car. Looking out\u2014 looking out for me now. For myself. There was a car right across from me. Smashed the window open and threw out the bodies. SUV with a family of five, all dead, half a tank left. Just horrible. There\u2019s corpses on the road. Bodies\u2013 track-covered, tarred, bloodied bodies all around. God, no, that\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not going to be me. Some of the cars are just covered in the stuff. There was a\u2026 a head in the grill of a pickup truck, just stuck there.\n\n\nI\u2019m so fucking thirsty. Water\u2014 Water all around me but I'm not\u2014 I wouldn't do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to drive straight. Too much shit on the road. I think I ran someone over, I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t know. Not thinking about it. There isn\u2019t traffic anymore. There\u2019s no room for it. Just burning wrecks and bodies. Sometimes I pass people. I figured\u2026 I\u2013 Sometimes they\u2019re eating the bodies.\n\n\nThey can die back there, but not me. I\u2019m getting out of this. I love you so much. I\u2019m getting further than anyone else because I love you. Gonna make it up to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a massive pile of\u2026 waste in the way. Cars. Wreckage. Bodies. Lots of bodies. Dozens of them. It\u2019s burning. I don\u2019t know what happened, but I can\u2019t even see the top. Fuck. I\u2019m going to have to climb over. Get out of the car and see what\u2019s ahead. Fuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nCoughing\n) Fuck. Fuck!\n\n\nFucking awful. Got to the top and (\nCoughing\n) Shit! I passed out on the wreckage. Cut myself so many fucking times I can feel the grease in my wounds. (\nExhaling\n) \u2026 I got over it. (\nCoughing\n) There\u2019s no cars ahead. Nothing. They couldn\u2019t get past the pile. The fires burn through the smog. Had to get in another car, had to\u2026 I\u2019m in a car again. Every second I\u2019m just thinking of getting home. Of coming out alive. I should be dead by now, but I\u2019m not. That means something to me. I\u2019m going to fucking pass out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were cars on my left. I don\u2019t know where they came from. Uh, god. What happened was\u2026 the one on my left came to a stop. The driver stepped out. Guess he was\u2026 just fucking weak. All of a sudden, this tractor trailer comes barreling out of nowhere. No horn, nothing. Ran him right over. Gut-splattered wheels. He just killed him. And if they ever do that to me, I-I\u2019m going to kill them too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome fuck just tried to run me off the road. Didn\u2019t let them do it. I don\u2019t care who it was. It feels like it\u2019s just me out here. Me and the bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s some sort of\u2026 (\nLaughs\n)\n\n\nThere\u2019s an incline. In the distance. It\u2019s going up, up. That has to be it. Through the clouds. (\nLaughing\n) My fucking god, it\u2019s something! I\u2019m making it out! I\u2019m not\u2026 holy shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nThe engine of Battaglia\u2019s vehicle is heard roaring.\n)\n\n\nFull speed. Racing up this hill for an hour now. Fuck you all. I\u2019ll be home soon.\n\n\nI know I deserve this. Thank god, I know I deserve this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nLaughing\n)\n\n\nI\u2019m in the fucking clouds now, it just keeps going higher and higher. The smog\u2019s clearing. Less black, more gray. This is it. This is it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad\u2019s evening out, sky\u2019s clearer. I\u2019m coming up to\u2014 wait, that\u2019s another car.\n\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\n\n(\nThe sounds of engines and horns are heard, louder than before.\n)\n\n\nThe lanes are thinning. There was\u2026 well, it\u2019s thinning into a single lane now. But there\u2019s cars ahead of me. I can fucking see them now. Fuck, fuck, no. No, I\u2019m not doing this again. How the hell did they get this far? Fuck you. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! Road\u2019s\u2014 the road\u2019s so thin. I can\u2019t even open my door, the railings there. This is the end, right? This is it. This is it.\n\n\n(\nBattaglia begins hyperventilating.\n)\n\n\nNo. No. No. No.\n\n\n(\nBattaglia sobs and screams for over twenty minutes. The sound of banging is heard. Battaglia screams, repeatedly punching the window of his car until it shatters. Transcript cut for brevity.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo transmission was received for eighteen hours, the longest gap between correspondences.\n\n\n\n\n(\nPeriodic banging sounds are heard between the cacophony of machine-like grinding.\n)\n\n\nHello? Have to speak up. Okay, good. Still good.\n\n\nThis is\u2026 Senior Researcher, Richard Battaglia. Area-179, Department of Containment. I\u2019ve processed that this is\u2013 is going to be my last message.\n\n\nThe smog cleared up a few hours ago and\u2026 I can see ahead of me now. There\u2019s a tunnel\u2026 at the end of the road. One massive, gaping tunnel, sitting up here in the clouds. Looks man-made, but\u2026 I know it can\u2019t be. Inside is pitch black, can\u2019t make any details out. There\u2019s these\u2026 bursts of fumes come from the inside. And the lane\u2014 the only lane\u2013 Fuck! (\nAnother banging noise is heard\n)\n\n\nWe\u2019re funneling into it. My car gave out. I\u2019m sure you can hear that noise\u2013 it\u2019s me getting pushed by whoever\u2019s behind me. Just\u2026 a slow approach into whatever the hell\u2019s in that tunnel. I already had my breakdown. Punched the shit out of my window, broke my hand, I think. I\u2019ve just\u2026accepted it now. That\u2019s either my way out, or it\u2019s over. I can\u2019t fully shake the hope, but it\u2019s\u2014 god, it sucks. What was it all for? What was any of that effort for?\n\n\nArticle 32.F of the Foundation employee\u2019s rights policy.

But I have enough time to\u2013 (\nBattaglia\u2019s car is shunted forward.\n)\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\nShaun, I\u2019m sorry that daddy couldn\u2019t be there for you. No excuses. I should have got out of this the second you came into my life. I\u2013 I won\u2019t ever see your graduation\u2026 your first day of first grade, or your face when\u2013 (\nBattaglia chokes\n) when you see your sister for the first time. I won\u2019t be there to watch either of you grow up. And that\u2019s my fault. I love you. You\u2013 You can hate me. I understand.\n\n\nBree\u2026 I knew. I always knew. Just promise me that whoever you bring around when I\u2019m gone loves you. Treats the kids right. You know that though. Uh\u2026 I love you. I never stopped loving you.\n\n\nIf I come out the other side, I want this burned.\n\n\n(\nAnother bang. The echo of engines and horns becomes louder, drowning out the audio.\n)\n\n\nGoing in now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther communication was not received until 12/17/2022, a week following Battaglia\u2019s last message.
