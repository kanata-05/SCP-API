The activity of SCP-5361-1 was to be monitored at all times. If SCP-5361-1 began to dematerialise, an inbuilt SRA would be activated.\n\n\nAs of 20/6/2021, SCP-5361 and -1 are considered neutralised.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5361 were a series of weather phenomena that occurred based on the emotional state of SCP-5361-1, a humanoid entity, superficially resembling the late Doctor Fordham who died on 27/5/2021.\n\n\nSCP-5361-1 produced an intermittent antimemetic effect on subjects viewing it and would manifest at a variable time at a variable location within the UK before beginning to wander without direction. After travelling for roughly 2 hours, SCP-5361-1 would dematerialise. SCP-5361-1 was not affected by outside stimuli, capable of walking through solid surfaces and would ignore any attempts at communication.\n\n\nAs of 20/6/2021 SCP-5361-1 has yet to manifest again.\n\n\nAddendum.1:\n Below are a series of text messages between Doctor Roberts and the late Doctor Fordham.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a025/05/2021\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a025/05/2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25/05/2021 at 11:43\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Not long till you're back now\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I can't wait for us to finally spend some time together\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I can't wait either\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Only a few days left on this project\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n And it's just in time for your birthday as well\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n We have to make this one extra special then\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n You know what else is coming up?\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Hmmm I wonder what?\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Nope, my calendar is completely empty ;)\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n You and your jokes lol\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n It will be our 3 year anniversary\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Oh I must have forgotten\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n :(\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I'm messing with you\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Of course I remembered\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I still remember that little work get together all those years ago\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Ah yes\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n When I first asked you out\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Good times\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I still reminisce about the old days\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n When things were much simpler\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I miss them as well\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n But the promotion allowed us to buy that new house we always wanted\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Opened up a lot of doors as well\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I know\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I just wish we had more time\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n We will soon enough\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I hope so\n\n\n\n\n25/05/2021 at 11:45\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Looks like it's time for me to head off now\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Will text you later\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Bye\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Good bye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a027/05/2021\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a027/05/2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27/05/2021 at 12:27\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Yay\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Coming back home today just in time for your birthday\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n I brought you your favourite\n\n\n\n\n27/05/2021 at 12:29\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Hey?\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n So when are you back home?\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Something's come up\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n ?\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Well Simon said that there's a potential promotion up for grabs if I decide to stay a little longer\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n What do you mean by staying a little longer?\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Well there is the whole tracking, observing and studying stuff and then all the paperwork has to be entered onto the database\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n It's a very tedious process, but you get the extra money and it could lead to a higher paying position\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Is this not a steady enough job for you at the moment\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n You might not even get it and it will just be more time wasted, when you could be home\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n We could always use the extra money\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Go on that holiday we always wanted\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Get a new car and stuff like that with the job\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n That's all well and good\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n But is it all worth it if you're always away on some research trip and never here\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n It would be nice to finally spend a bit of time together\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n We can have all the time in the world\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n It's just that moving up the ranks would benefit us\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Just imagine\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n When will it stop though\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I though this is what you wanted\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n A stable job\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Money for us\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I'm doing this for us\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n But what's the point if we can't enjoy our life together\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n It's always about work\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Ever since we first got together\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n It's just another week or so\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Yes, but when will it end\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n Every time you come home from your latest trip out of the country\n\n\nDr. Roberts\n:\n You're immediately off the next day to some other place\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I'm trying okay\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Balancing this job and still having time for us is frustrating\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n I just want to get it over and done with so things can go back to being about us\n\n\nDr. Fordham\n:\n Is that not what you wanted?

Doctor Roberts applied for a test to be conducted on SCP-5361-1. This application was approved.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 20/6/2021\n\n\nProcedure:\n Dr. Roberts would make contact with SCP-5361-1 and attempt to communicate with the entity.\n\n\nPurpose:\n To test whether SCP-5361-1 will react when presented with a person of interest from Dr. Fordham's life.\n\n\nResults:\n While SCP-5361-1 had begun to walk down an alley, Dr. Roberts rounded the corner and stood in front of SCP-5361-1. SCP-5361-1 proceeded to tilt its head downwards to observe Dr. Roberts, before they both embraced each other in a hug. SCP-5361-1 then proceeded to dematerialise.\n\n\nNote:\n After a prolonged absence of SCP-5361-1 once the test had concluded, the item was reclassified as neutralised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5360\n | SCP-5361 | \nSCP-5362\n \u00bb",
