Dr. Miller was granted permission to keep the remains as they exhibited no anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0archived\u00a0containment\u00a0procedures\n\n\n\n\nHide\u00a0archived\u00a0containment\u00a0procedures\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5732 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell and provided with standard furnishings and entertainment. Any water provided for drinking, bathing, or any other purpose must be distilled and any receptacle, including those used for bathing, thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before use. SCP-5732 is to be supplied its prescribed regimen of medication daily. New prescriptions can be approved by Dr. Miller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5732 was a female humanoid, aged 20 years. Any water that came into direct physical contact with it was instantly purged of any and all impurities. When SCP-5732 became submerged in any large bodies of water, roughly 1500 liters could be purified before the effect overtaxed the subject and rendered it unconscious.\n\n\nSCP-5732\u2019s anomalous ability seemed to be in direct conflict with its immune system and organs, with uses of the ability correlating to increased immunodeficiency and organ dysfunction. Distilled water was used to limit damage to SCP-5732\u2019s body caused by its anomaly.\n\nSCP-5732 was discovered on 14/3/2015 after it was hospitalized following an incident at a friend\u2019s swimming pool, in which SCP-5732 jumped into the water and immediately lost consciousness. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Foundation was working at the hospital, leading to a quick extraction of the anomaly and the cover story that it passed away during emergency surgery. Amnesticization of present family and friends was not required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview with Dr. Miller\n\n\nDate: 21 March 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Good morning, SCP-5732.\n\n\n[SCP-5732 doesn\u2019t respond]\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n I imagine you\u2019re probably feeling a lot right now. But I need you to work with me and answer some questions. Can you do that?\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Yeah.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n The incident that landed you in the hospital, it sounded intense. I\u2019d like to know how you\u2019re feeling, physically. We would like to make sure we aren\u2019t missing anything about your condition.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n I feel fine. Sick when I drink water, though. And I got really lightheaded when they let me take a shower.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n And this only happens when you come into contact with water?\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n It hasn\u2019t happened any other time.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Good. That means our researchers are on the right track with figuring out how to help you.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n You\u2019ve got a weird way of helping.\n\n\n[Neither speak for several seconds]\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n You miss your family.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n You couldn\u2019t have given me a chance to say goodbye?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Think of it this way. They think you\u2019re dead. If you actually died in that pool, would you have been able to say goodbye?\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n \u2026no.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Goodbyes are a luxury. Most people don\u2019t get them.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Have you?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Sorry?\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Have you ever- not gotten one\u2026 uh, have you ever lost somebody, I mean?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Yes.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n \u2026sorry I asked.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n It\u2019s alright.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n So what do I do now? I can\u2019t leave, I can\u2019t see anyone, what do I do?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n We\u2019ll start testing your ability in the next few days. We need to see the limits of what you can do so we can mitigate your condition properly.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n But what about outside of testing? What do I \ndo?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Humanoid anomalies like you get access to a rotating schedule of entertainment sources. We have items you can check out, books, video games, movies-\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Like the two copies of \nSpiderman 2\n they left me? I just sit around and watch those by myself?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n They only left you two copies of the same movie?\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n No. I also have \nOz: The Great And Powerful.\n But I would rather watch \nSpiderman 2\n twice.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Come on. Franco isn\u2019t that bad.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Do you hear yourself?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n I like you. You have a good attitude.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Well yeah, I don\u2019t have anything else, do I?\n\n\n[SCP-5732 is silent for a moment, before beginning to cry]\n\n\n[Dr. Miller removes a piece of paper from his pocket and sets it on the table]\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n I\u2019m ending this interview, SCP-5732. For security purposes we can\u2019t allow anomalies to talk with one another, but you can request means of socialization with a certified staff member from this list. We\u2019ve found it helps with mental stability.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Do you think I\u2019m mentally unstable?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n No. But you\u2019re in a very difficult position and you might find yourself needing someone to talk to.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n You\u2019re on this list.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n I\u2019m certified for the job.\n\n\n[SCP-5732 doesn\u2019t respond, but takes the paper]\n\n\n[End Log]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following requests were made following the release of SCP-5732\u2019s preliminary medical examination results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nRequest Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-severity pain medication\n1\n\n\nApproved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne electric blanket, twin sized\n\n\nApproved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell phone modified for communication with certified staff members\n\n\nApproved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelocation to above-ground dormitory with window\n\n\nDenied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview with Dr. Miller\n\n\nDate: 27 March 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n \n(Using an approximation of a Brooklyn accent)\n Give it to me straight, doc.

Probably. I\u2019m just going to wait until you\u2019re not here like I always do.\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n I understand. It\u2019s a lot to process.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n How long do I have?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n The estimate is about fifteen months.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Oh. That\u2019s not so bad.

Very few are animals, even fewer are humanoid.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n Like me?\n\n\nDr. Miller:\n Like you.\n\n\nSCP-5732:\n How many others have there been?

I\u2019d like to know how you\u2019re feeling, physically. We would like to make sure we aren\u2019t missing anything about your condition. SCP-5732: I feel fine. Sick when I drink water, though. And I got really lightheaded when they let me take a shower. Dr. Miller: And this only happens when you come into contact with water? SCP-5732: It hasn\u2019t happened any other time. Dr. Miller: Good. That means our researchers are on the right track with figuring out how to help you. SCP-5732: You\u2019ve got a weird way of helping. [Neither speak for several seconds] Dr. Miller: You miss your family. SCP-5732: You couldn\u2019t have given me a chance to say goodbye? Dr. Miller: Think of it this way. They think you\u2019re dead. If you actually died in that pool, would you have been able to say goodbye? SCP-5732: \u2026no. Dr. Miller: Goodbyes are a luxury. Most people don\u2019t get them. SCP-5732: Have you? Dr. Miller: Sorry? SCP-5732: Have you ever- not gotten one\u2026 uh, have you ever lost somebody, I mean? Dr. Miller: Yes. SCP-5732: \u2026sorry I asked. Dr. Miller: It\u2019s alright. SCP-5732: So what do I do now? I can\u2019t leave, I can\u2019t see anyone, what do I do? Dr. Miller: We\u2019ll start testing your ability in the next few days. We need to see the limits of what you can do so we can mitigate your condition properly. SCP-5732: But what about outside of testing? What do I do? Dr. Miller: Humanoid anomalies like you get access to a rotating schedule of entertainment sources. We have items you can check out, books, video games, movies- SCP-5732: Like the two copies of Spiderman 2 they left me? I just sit around and watch those by myself? Dr. Miller: They only left you two copies of the same movie? SCP-5732: No. I also have Oz: The Great And Powerful. But I would rather watch Spiderman 2 twice. Dr. Miller: Come on. Franco isn\u2019t that bad. SCP-5732: Do you hear yourself? Dr. Miller: I like you. You have a good attitude. SCP-5732: Well yeah, I don\u2019t have anything else, do I? [SCP-5732 is silent for a moment, before beginning to cry] [Dr. Miller removes a piece of paper from his pocket and sets it on the table] Dr. Miller: I\u2019m ending this interview, SCP-5732. For security purposes we can\u2019t allow anomalies to talk with one another, but you can request means of socialization with a certified staff member from this list. We\u2019ve found it helps with mental stability. SCP-5732: Do you think I\u2019m mentally unstable? Dr. Miller: No. But you\u2019re in a very difficult position and you might find yourself needing someone to talk to. SCP-5732: You\u2019re on this list. Dr. Miller: I\u2019m certified for the job. [SCP-5732 doesn\u2019t respond, but takes the paper] [End Log]",

        "[Begin Log] SCP-5732: (Using an approximation of a Brooklyn accent) Give it to me straight, doc. Am I dying for real this time? [Dr. Miller laughs briefly, but quickly sobers] Dr. Miller: Haha, uh\u2026 yeah. SCP-5732: Oh. Shit, huh. Dr. Miller: You don\u2019t seem terribly surprised. SCP-5732: I\u2019m\u2026 not? I feel really bad all the time, Dr. Miller. It\u2019s like getting the flu every time I drink something. Sorta just seems like the logical conclusion. Dr. Miller: I\u2019m sorry. [Neither speak for a moment] Dr. Miller: I\u2019m going to speak with the medical staff about putting you on medication to manage your pain. Is there anything else I can do? SCP-5732: I wanna meet James Franco. Dr. Miller: You want to meet- no. I can\u2019t do that. [Dr. Miller pauses] Dr. Miller: Franco? That\u2019s the first person that came to your head? SCP-5732: I was joking. Dr. Miller: You know, you can switch out which movies you have. SCP-5732: Oh, I know. I\u2019m keeping the Spidermans. Dr. Miller: You\u2019re taking this remarkably well. SCP-5732: Taking it badly wouldn\u2019t make me any less\u2026 dying. Dr. Miller: Good point. SCP-5732: \u2026but I am gonna cry after this. Probably. I\u2019m just going to wait until you\u2019re not here like I always do. Dr. Miller: I understand. It\u2019s a lot to process. SCP-5732: How long do I have? Dr. Miller: The estimate is about fifteen months. SCP-5732: Oh. That\u2019s not so bad. Plenty of time. Dr. Miller: Plenty of time. You\u2019re certainly a brave one. SCP-5732: Everybody\u2019s dying. What else can I do in here but wait? Dr. Miller: Well, let\u2019s see if we can do something about the waiting. [End Log]",

        "[Begin Log] Dr. Miller: I\u2019m real sorry, kid. SCP-5732: It\u2019s fine. It was a longshot. Worth a try. Dr. Miller: They did approve us, though. We just might have to wait longer. SCP-5732: I don\u2019t have longer to wait. And it\u2019s okay! It wouldn\u2019t have been the same with all those guards hovering around. Dr. Miller: They\u2019re not so bad. SCP-5732: Every single one I\u2019ve met has been a total hardass. Dr. Miller: It\u2019s just their job. SCP-5732: Did you get the projector, though? Dr. Miller: No. SCP-5732: What? Why not? Dr. Miller: They don\u2019t deem it necessary. [SCP-5732 pretends to cough] SCP-5732: What if I look really sick? Really sick like this? Ohh, I\u2019m dying and I need a projector to watch Spiderman 2 for the 800th time or my dead body will be SUPER anomalous\u2026 Dr. Miller: Stop. [A pause. Neither speaks for several seconds.] SCP-5732: Are you going to miss me? Dr. Miller: Of course. SCP-5732: Really though. You must have a million weirdo messed up people exactly like me all over this place. Dr. Miller: Not that many, really. I work with self-neutralizing anomalies. Plenty of anomalies are self-destructive, but usually inanimate objects. Very few are animals, even fewer are humanoid. SCP-5732: Like me? Dr. Miller: Like you. SCP-5732: How many others have there been? Humanoids? Dr. Miller: You\u2019re the fifth. SCP-5732: Do you miss them all? Dr. Miller: I miss them all. SCP-5732: You big sap. Dr. Miller: Absolutely correct. SCP-5732: Why do you keep doing it? Doesn\u2019t it suck? Dr. Miller: If you could have anything, if you could be guaranteed to have ANYTHING before you go, what would it be? SCP-5732: \u2026I don\u2019t want to be alone. Dr. Miller: That\u2019s why. [Dr. Miller sighs] Dr. Miller: And besides, a little time is better than none at all, right? I got to be there to help make some good experiences before they went. SCP-5732: But realistically, how much can you actually DO here? They don\u2019t even let us go outside. Dr. Miller: Eh, checking things off boxes isn\u2019t always what makes the time worthwhile.

Dr. Miller: I\u2026 don\u2019t know. I bought the one that looked good. SCP-5732: You bought it? Dr. Miller: Yeah, why not? They don\u2019t cost that much these days. Have you ever used one? SCP-5732: No. Dr. Miller: It\u2019s pretty cool. There\u2019s an ocean simulator that I think you\u2019ll really like. Want to get it set up tonight? SCP-5732: Actually, I\u2019m not really feeling up to it tonight. Tomorrow though! Dr. Miller: Sounds like a plan. We can get some more of that bucket list stuff crossed off. SCP-5732: Wanna see those animals. Dr. Miller: We can see as many as you want. SCP-5732: Wanna see the Franco in 4k. Dr. Miller: THAT I\u2019m not sure about. SCP-5732: Thank you, though. Really. I\u2019m so excited to make you watch me watch some CGI animals. Dr. Miller: I\u2019m glad I get to be included. [End Log]",
