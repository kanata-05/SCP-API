Standard LSWOD security protocols apply, and all observers and items placed inside the Dome are to be completely sanitized of SCP-440. The bottle in which SCP-440 was first discovered (hereafter referred to as SCP-440-Prime), is currently located in a security cabinet on Site-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-440 is a sample of fine-grain sand (sand grain of approximately 90 micrometers) that is chemically identical to typical silica-based sand. Its only difference is that it functions as if it were in a microgravity environment, regardless of the gravitational forces acting upon it. SCP-440 was found in a small glass bottle with no label on it, filled with a viscous fluid that, presumably, weighs down SCP-440 and prevents the grains from touching.\n\n\nSCP-440 is capable of giving this property to other samples of sand, essentially transforming it into SCP-440 itself\n1\n. The process governing this conversion is believed to be based on contact, requiring SCP-440 to be introduced into a sample of unconverted sand via compressed air. The rate of conversion from basic sand to SCP-440 is also unknown, but it is understood that approximately 30% (by mass) of 'seed sand' does not convert.\n\n\nWhen SCP-440 reaches specific levels of concentration within an environment, an SCP-440 based ecosystem forms. Because all SCP-440-based objects (environmental and sapient) are in constant gravitational freefall, there is less evolutionary pressure on gravity-defying traits.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Log\n\n\n03/10/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: In Examination Booth #6642, 2\u00a0g of SCP-440 injected into 4\u00a0L of fine-grain sand via air-powered hose.\n\n\n03/18/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sand-to-SCP-440 conversion ceases; approximately 1.2\u00a0L of sand remains unconverted. Small (0.5 to 1\u00a0cm) nodules of SCP-440 appear, floating aimlessly in the enclosure.\n\n\n4/30/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Request to expand experiment approved by O5-\u2588 to Examination Room #6135. 12\u00a0L of fine-grain sand added to the room.\n\n\n5/10/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: 3\u00a0L of fine-grain sand remains unconverted. Larger rocks (average size: 10\u00a0cm) float through the enclosure. First discovery of SCP-440-based life occur, hereafter referred to as SCP-440-1. SCP-440-1 (colloquially called \"dustbugs\") are 6\u00a0cm entities somewhat resembling brine shrimp. Specimens of SCP-440-1 spend their lives using their rough 'teeth' to shear off sections of rocks for consumption. Study of SCP-440-1 specimens reveal they are composed entirely of undifferentiated SCP-440. Experiment transfer to Animal Enclosure #42 approved, and enclosure is re-seeded with \u2588\u2588 L of fine-grain sand.\n\n\n6/7/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Floating rocks (average size: 41\u00a0cm) compose the majority of the enclosure. SCP-440-1 population increases dramatically, kept in check by a new entity type, hereafter SCP-440-2. SCP-440-2s are 75\u00a0cm long entities resembling rocky cephalopods, using their tentacles to push themselves off the environment to move. They are dubbed \"Rocktopods\" by staff. After much deliberation, O5-\u2588 ordered Animal Enclosure #42 shipped to Site-\u2588\u2588 for expansion purposes, owing to that Site's unused Large-Scale Wilderness Observation Dome. As with the previous transfer, approximately [DATA EXPUNGED] of fine-grain sand was placed in the Dome.\n\n\n9/19/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Rocks in environment have an average size of 6\u00a0m. Populations of SCP-440-1 and -2 have grown as projected. Over the past week, four instances of a new apex predator, SCP-440-3 (\"Sandsnakes\") are documented. SCP-440-3s are 1.5\u00a0m long entities with a snake-like body and a mouth shaped like a conventional rock crusher. Two SCP-440-3s are killed before reaching full maturity (one from another SCP-440-3, another from attacking a group of SCP-440-2s). The survivors establish a territorial system within the LSWOD. It is assumed that SCP-440-3 specimens are composed of SCP-440, but capturing an SCP-440-3 sample has proven difficult, owing to hostility by SCP-440-3s.\n\n\n10/08/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Permission to seek expansion for the environment denied by O5-\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Data:\n\n\nSCP-440 Exploratory Log A\n - 6/7/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSCP-440 Exploratory Log B\n - 9/10/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nA Detailed Examination Of The SCP-440 Ecology by Dr. Z\u2588\u2588\u2588 J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 \nFILE CURRENTLY PROCESSING\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
