It is unknown where the light, as little as it is, comes from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n A 3-kilometer by 3-kilometer perimeter has been constructed around SCP-8250, which security personnel are to patrol regularly. Any civilians approaching the containment facility are to be redirected around it or amnesticised, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Should any SCP-8250-1 instancs attempt to breach containment, MTF Lambda-11 (\"Night Terrors\") is to either neutralize or capture them, depending on the danger.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-8250 is a 2.5-kilometre squared forested area in Bragg Creek\n1\n Provincial Park. Instead of a regular forest, the area appears to have been replaced by a visually pure black dome. This dome appears to have a smoke-like texture and is in constant motion. The surface of the dome, at last measure, absorbs 99.8% of all light, contributing to the darkness.\n\n\nThe inside of SCP-8250, designated SCP-8250-1 appears to be relatively unchanged. However, there are a few major differences. The biggest change is the lack of most light, though not all. This has not changed since SCP-8250 cropped up. The wildlife within, designated SCP-8250-2 instances also appears to be substantially more hostile. They have also been observed to have increased ability in certain areas.\n2\n. This change has been attributed to an anomalous form of radiation causing rapid change on an atomic level.\n\n\nAt the center of SCP-8250-1 is a sphere shaped entity, designated SCP-8250-4. It resembles SCP-8250 and appears to display a memetic effect on those who come into contact with it, as well as theists who enter SCP-8250. The reason why theists are affected so drastically is unknown. It also appears to be the source of SCP-8250.\n\n\nGuarding SCP-8250-4 is SCP-8250-3, a mutated creature once known as Squad Leader Vasquez. Currently, SCP-8250-3 stands at 7 meters tall, and a lopsided form, shorter on the left side than the right. SCP-8250-3 has also displayed tremendous strength and musculature, being stronger than any SCP-8250-2 instance.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-8250 was discovered after several groups of hikers went missing in the area over the summer of 2022. Park rangers dispatched to the location also went missing. Several viral videos of the area were recorded and posted before being taken down and cited as misinformation. Foundation personnel were finally alerted following this and a Foundation presence was established.\n\n\nAddendum 8250.1: Documented SCP-8250-2 Instances\n\n\nThe following log details the 4 kinds of SCP-8250-2 instances found inside SCP-8250 and their differences to their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8250-2-A\n\n\nType of Animal:\n White-Tailed Deer\n\n\nNotes:\n Substantial increase in strength noted. Subjects capable of breaking through 7 inch thick steel walls over the course of 15 minutes. Canines\n3\n observed. Subject also seen eating live prey. Eye contact advised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8250-2-B\n\n\nType of Animal:\n Blue Jay\n\n\nNotes:\n Subject has dramatically increased in size, by nearly 12 times. Talons noted to be similar to those found in birds of prey. However, the beak has remained the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8250-2-C\n\n\nType of Animal:\n Beaver\n\n\nNotes:\n No outwardly obvious signs of change. However, massively increased intelligence has been observed. SCP-8250-2-C instances seen building highly advanced structures out of wood, and engaging in activities that generally only humans engage in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation:\n SCP-8250-2-D\n\n\nType of Animal:\n Eastern Gray Squirrel\n\n\nNotes:\n Subjects seen engaging in hive-mind behaviour, swarming prey in an attempt to kill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.2: SCP-8250 Discussion\n\n\n\n\nMEETING LOG\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n The following log details a meeting between Observation Post-12\n4\n personnel.\n\n\nPERSONNEL PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis\n\n\nResearcher Collins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n All present?\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n I'd like a present.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams looks at Researcher Collins sternly.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Some people, man. Lighten up, yeah?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Can we just get on with it? Now, are we all present?\n\n\nChorus of yes' heard.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Good. What do we have?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n We discovered that SCP-8250 is emitting some sort of energy. So yesterday I sent some guys over with Geiger counters. The energy it's emitting? Radiation, or some anomalous form of it. I've decided to call the type it gives off A-Radiation.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Why Geiger counters?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis shrugs.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Based on the imaging we've already done, I thought it was reasonable.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I did take the liberty of asking for assistance from MTF Lambda-11. They're uniquely suited to entering such territory.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Excellent. Collins, I need you to prepare them when they arrive, okay?\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Aye aye captain.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams sighs.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Take this seriously, please.\n\n\nResearcher Collins shrugs.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Yeah, sorry. Can't help it.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n I can understand that, I really do, but please just tone it back.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Of course. Apologies.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams nods at Researcher Collins.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Does anyone have anything else?\n\n\nEveryone shakes their head.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Very well. Meeting adjourned.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n MTF Lambda-11 arrived within an hour following the end of the meeting, and were met with Researcher Collins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.3: MTF Lambda-11 Preparation\n\n\n\n\nExploration Preparation\n\n\nExploration Team:\n MTF Lambda-11 (\"Night Terrors\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8250\n\n\nProject Lead:\n Head Researcher Williams\n\n\nProject Assistant:\n Researcher Collins\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Squad Leader Vasquez, Sergeant Chen, Corporal Barry, Corporal Rosanna\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nResearcher Collins is seen finishing up preparations for Lambda-11 to enter into SCP-8250.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n And\u2026 all set!\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Thanks. Anything we should know before we go in?\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Obviously it's highly radioactive in there, at least, we think so. The radiation is very anomalous and mutagenic. Not your normal radiation. I'm not sure how long the suits will protect you for. So my suggestion? Get in and get out as soon as you can.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Understood.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams enters and nods a greeting at the squad leader.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Welcome. I assume Collins gave a short briefing?\n\n\nSergeant Chen:\n Correct.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Good. All we want you to do is do a bit of observation. Don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. And if you feel like you need to draw back, do it.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez nods sharply.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Alright team. Move out.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Lambda-11 set off immediately following this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.4: SCP-8250 Attempted Exploration Log\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n MTF Lambda-11 (\"Night Terrors\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8250\n\n\nProject Lead:\n Head Researcher Williams\n\n\nProject Assistant:\n N/A\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Squad Leader Vasquez, Sergeant Chen, Corporal Barry, Corporal Rosanna\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nLambda-11 finally reaches the base of SCP-8250 after a long hike.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n In and out, as quick and efficiently as we can. Alright, let's move.\n\n\nEntry into SCP-8250 is achieved. Radio contact lost for 3.3 minutes.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n - you hear me?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nLoud and clear.\n\n\nSergeant Chen:\n It is \ndark\n here. Like, darker than anything natural.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nHold one moment, Lambda-11.\n\n\nThere's radio silence for 33 seconds before Head Researcher Williams talks again.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nSCP-8250-1 appears to have inherited many of the same properties of SCP-8250. That includes its absorption of nearly all light. The fact there is light at all is odd. And on that note, I would advise you switch over to night vision. Please continue.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Copy. Lambda-11, move out.\n\n\nAs they move, the darkness makes even the night vision struggle. Squad Leader Vasquez soon spots what appears to be a small herd of SCP-8250-2-A instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8250-2-A instances as captured by bodycam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Halt!\n\n\nLambda-11:\n Halting!\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Command, we've got something. Please advise, over.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nCopy. Appears to be a herd of SCP-8250-2-A instances. I'd advise you back away very slowly. They don't look like much, but they're much stronger than you. And don't break eye contact, whatever you do.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Copy that. Lambda-11, we're moving out. Back away slowly, don't break eye contact, alright?\n\n\nLambda-11:\n Understood.\n\n\nSuddenly, Corporal Barry sneezes and the deer tense up.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nRun!\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n Run.\n\n\nThe SCP-8250-2-A instances pounce, and Sergeant Chen is immediately taken down. The bodycam captures the noise of gunshots and screaming before turning off.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n All contact with Lambda-11 was lost following this event. Presumed deceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.5: Incident Log 1/8250\n\n\nThe following details an incident involving SCP-8250-2 shortly after the attempted exploration by MTF Lambda-11.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n12:07\n - SCP-8250 smokey pattern starts shifting faster.\n\n\n12:11\n - A herd of SCP-8250-2-A instances stampede out, followed by SCP-8250-2-B through C.\n\n\n12:17\n - All essential personnel evacuated out.\n\n\n12:19\n - Observation Post-12 overrun by SCP-8250-2.\n\n\n13:01\n - Reinforcements arrive and begin assault.\n\n\n13:13\n - Observation Post-12 defenses break. SCP-8250-2 instances pushed back into SCP-8250-1.\n\n\n13:14\n - Observation Post-12 retaken.\n\n\n15:24\n - More reinforcements flown in. Permanent paramilitary force established.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n This event led to the realization that the entities within SCP-8250 are able to leave SCP-8250-1 at any time. It is currently unknown why SCP-8250-2 does not do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.6: SCP-8250 Discussion #2\n\n\n\n\nMEETING LOG\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n The following log details the second meeting between Observation Post-12 personnel, in regards to recent events.\n\n\nPERSONNEL PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis\n\n\nResearcher Collins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nPersonnel file in and sit down. They all look shaken. Researcher Collins breathes in and blows out slowly.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Well we've certainly had a rough day.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n In a way, it was necessary, if you ask me.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n If we're thinking the same thing, then I agree with Meyers.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n And what's that?\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n We got too complacent. We didn't expect SCP-8250 to surprise us. Now we'll be ready.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Exactly.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n I hate to be that guy, but we need another MTF out here.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Didn't they just all die?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n No. That was merely a detachment of them. The rest are off doing whatever MTF's do in their spare time.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Well get them over here then. Except with proper equipment. Let's smoke these guys!\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n No! I will not risk unnecessary lives. End of!\n\n\nBefore Senior Researcher Davis can argue, a beeping sounds starts emanating from one of the computers. Senior Researcher Meyers quickly checks it and pales.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n It's\u2026 it's the camera footage from Squad Leader Vasquez.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Vasquez? Isn't he the one we sent into -\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Into SCP-8250? Yeah, he is.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Alright. Put it up.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.7: Further SCP-8250 Exploration Footage\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n N/A\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8250\n\n\nProject Lead:\n N/A\n\n\nProject Assistant:\n N/A\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Squad Leader Vasquez\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez stumbles along the forestline, muttering to himself.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n \nForest\u2026 forest won't take me.\n\n\nDifferent SCP-8250-2 instances can be sighted as Squad Leader Vasquez walks. For unknown reasons, they seem wary, and do not attack.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n \nBut God shall. God shall have me. For I have seen Its face. For God is the Great Orb\n\n\nIt is unknown what this face of god, nor the Great Orb, is that Squad Leader Vasquez kept referring to.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez\n \nGod is\n [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED].\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez:\n \nGod. I am yours.\n\n\nSquad Leader Vasquez rips off his Radiological Protection Suit\n5\n and collapses. The camera is obscured for most of the time, but it captures him writing on the ground. A mishappen anomaly, now designated SCP-8250-3 can be seen running off into the trees.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Head Researcher Williams ordered for a detachment of MTF Lambda-11 to assist shortly after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.9: Reaction\n\n\n\n\nMEETING LOG\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n The following log details Observation Post-12 Personnel's reaction to the final log from MTF Lambda-11's failed exploration attempt.\n\n\nPERSONNEL PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis\n\n\nResearcher Collins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n That was\u2026\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Disconcerting?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n What was that?\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n I just did a quick vitals check, and before he transformed, for lack of better word, he was emitting A-Radiation on a similar scale to SCP-8250.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n What? Why?\n\n\nResearcher Collins shrugs and Head Researcher Williams speaks up.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Perhaps you were right, Davis. I've asked for another detachment of Lambda-11 to come and assist us.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n About time.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Are we sure that's wise? The last detachment died pretty much instantly.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Wise? Perhaps not. Necessary? Yes.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I think Collins wants to go in.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Alright, listen here asshole. I -\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Will both of you JUST SHUT UP!\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers and Collins both quiet down.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n We're all supposed to be adults here. Act like it!\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Apologies.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I'm sorry.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams sighs.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n The reason I asked for them is because we need to find whatever it is Vasquez was talking about. The Great Orb, he called it.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Didn't that drive him crazy?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Or perhaps something else did.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Comforting.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n We can, at the very least, try and make sure they don't take their suits off.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n Then do it.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n On that topic, can we talk about what happened to Vasquez?\n\n\nEveryone looks at Researcher Collins.\n\n\nResearcher Collins:\n Well, he mutated into some weird Wendigo\n6\n thing in seconds. Is no-one going to comment on that?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Actually, he's got a point. We're going to have to assume this new Vasquez is just as hostile as the other SCP-8250-2 instances. What do we do if we meet him.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Neutralize him. End of.\n\n\nAn argument broke out following this statement. For the sake of brevity, it has been omitted from the record.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n If he acts hostile towards Lambda-11, they'll neutralize him. If not, they'll leave him be. Simple enough.\n\n\nThere's some grumbling, but no-one says anything.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n If that's all, this meeting is adjourned.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n A detachment from MTF Lambda-11 arrived at Observation Post-11\u00a03 hours after this meeting.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.9: Head Researcher Williams' Notes\n\n\nThe following details Head Researchers Williams thoughts on SCP-8250. They were taken shortly after the last meeting.\n\n\n\n\nThat was quite painful. It's like all the personnel here are children. But alas, I am not here to bitch about other people.\n\n\nI have been thinking about what Vasquez said. He said he saw God. I am not convinced he did not. Perhaps what we're witnessing is natures evolutionary ascent. I mean, look at it! Beavers with enhanced intelligence, squirrels with hive minds, deer strong enough to rip through steel. Life evolved in the dark, after all. And what is this if not evolution?\n\n\nIt's ironic. I have been a theist for all these years despite my work at the Foundation. I have been called crazy for it. And yet, here I stand, about to discover God. Maybe I was right. Maybe it was all worth it.\n\n\nOr maybe I'm just a tired old man who's had too much time to think, who's going crazy. But regardless of what it is, I \nwill\n figure this out. Lambda-11 shall be the surgical tool I use to cut this mystery open. And then we shall see what I am.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.10: MTF Lambda-11 Exploration Attempt #2\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n MTF Lambda-11 (\"Night Terrors\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8250\n\n\nProject Lead:\n Head Researcher Williams\n\n\nProject Assistant:\n N/A\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Squad Leader Klein, Sergeant Belson, Corporal Butler, Corporal Johanna\n\n\nNotes:\n The preparation log for this attempt has been omitted for brevity's sake.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nMTF Lambda-11 is seen in a truck this time around. As they pass through SCP-8250, the light level immediately drops.\n\n\nCorporal Butler:\n Sure is dark.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nHumanity evolved in the dark. You'll be fine.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Roger.\n\n\nSergeant Belson:\n What does that even mean?\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein shrugs.\n\n\nCorporal Johanna:\n That's what we're trying to figure out, right?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nSquad Leader Vasquez of the detachment went crazy after finding something in there. We need you to find it.\n\n\nSergeant Belson:\n Er, he sees the paradox in that, right?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nYes. It seems crazy.\n\n\nSergeant Belson jolts.\n\n\nSergean Belson:\n Oh shit. He can hear me?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nYes. And I agree, it is paradoxical. That's why you have updated SCRAMBLE goggles as part of your gear. It should prevent any visual cognitohazards.\n\n\nCorporal Johanna:\n Should? That's comforting.\n\n\nThe truck comes to a stop.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Alright. Let's go.\n\n\nMTF Lambda-11 disembarks from the truck and starts moving on foot.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Command, are you getting any readings?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nYeah. I'm getting some really weird radiation readings 3 klicks north of you. Odd that I can see it through SCP-8250.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Copy. Lambda-11, we're heading north.\n\n\nCorporal Butler:\n Boy am I glad we have these suits.\n\n\nApproximately 1.7 klicks into their journey, MTF Lambda encounters a hive of SCP-8250-2-D instances, who immediately attack. Luckily, Lambda-11's reinforced RPS' prevent any damage while the instances are taken care of.\n\n\nCorporal Butler:\n Command, have you ever fought a horde of hive minded squirrels before?\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Quiet.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nCan't say that I have Butler. Certainly wasn't on my to do list.\n\n\nCorporal Johanna:\n Good.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein shoots her a look of warning.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nKeep heading north. You're only about a click away now.\n\n\nMTF Lamdba-11 keeps walking and enters dense forest area. And there, in between the trees, is the Great Orb.\n\n\n[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]\n\n\nThe entire squad wince once they see it, presumed to be a reaction to the large amounts of radiation.\n\n\nSergeant Belson:\n Holy shit.\n\n\nCorporal Butler:\n Oh my God\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Command? What the fuck is that thing?\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nIt's\u2026 it's everything I imagined. It's beautiful.\n\n\nCorporal Johanna drops to one knee and unsteadily gets up again.\n\n\nCorporal Johanna:\n Painful is what it is. Can we go, Clark\n7\n?\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Command, we're getting out of here!\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nNo! Stay! Please!\n\n\nA piercing roar is heard as what used to be Vasquez enters the area. It's a very tall, muscular creature, slumped to one side. Lambda-11 immediately opens fire.\n\n\nSquad Leader Klein:\n Let's go!\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nThis is the culmination of everything I've ever dreamed of! You won't take that from me!\n\n\nUnknown\n8\n:\n \nWhat in Gods name are you doing?!\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nI'm doing it for them!\n\n\nA scuffle ensues on the other end of the radio, a few bangs heard, before it's reactivated.\n\n\nHead Researcher Williams:\n \nI'm sorry for this.\n\n\nAn electric shock passes through each of the members of Lambda-11, incapacitating them. Head Researcher Williams walks away from the radio as a series of squelching noises occur.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Head Researcher Williams, now designated POI-8250, was last seen entering SCP-8250.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.11: Final Meeting Log\n\n\n\n\nMEETING LOG\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n N/A\n\n\nPERSONNEL PRESENT:\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers and Senior Researcher Davis enter the room carefully and sit down.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Where's Collins? I want to apologize to him. I was an asshole. It's been a rough few days is all.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers doesn't answer immediately, just slumps over onto the table for a moment.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Collins is\u2026 is dead. Killed by POI-8250\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis clenches his fists and starts crying.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Bastard.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Yeah.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n We need to go after him. Before he kills someone else.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I'm not so sure that's a good idea.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Listen, I asked for a detachment of Lambda-11 again. Want to know what they said?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers looks at Senior Researcher Davis expectantly.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n They said they can't afford to help us like that anymore and that we better cut our losses.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n You must understand where they're coming from.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n And you must understand I'm going regardless.\n\n\nThe two men stare at each other for a minute before Senior Researcher Meyers relents.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Fine. But I'd rather not die for this. You think Collins would have wanted that? If things get too dangerous, we pull out, okay?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Deal.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Senior Researcher Davis and Meyers left Observation Post-12 shortly after.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.12: Final Exploration Log\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nExploration Team:\n N/A\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-8250\n\n\nProject Lead:\n N/A\n\n\nProject Assistant:\n N/A\n\n\nTeam Members:\n Senior Researcher Meyers, Senior Researcher Davis\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers and Senior Researcher Davis walk through SCP-8250. The drop in light is barely perceptible.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Did you see that?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Or rather, not see that?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I'd hazard a guess that SCP-8250 has gradually been spreading and we just didn't notice.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis nods.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n This may be stretching a bit, but doesn't it seem awfully convenient that Williams enters SCP-8250 and \nthen\n it starts expanding?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Yes. But the more important question is where are all the SCP-8250-2 instances?\n\n\nThe two senior researchers look around, and see nothing.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Somehow I wish we could see them. I don't like this.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Neither do I. But you made me come here.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis glares at Senior Researcher Meyers for a moment before relenting.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to be responsible for someones death.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers shakes his head.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n You'd go without me anyway. I can't let you go alone. Besides, I understand why you're going.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n I\u2026 thank you.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Shall we get a move on?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis sniffs.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Sure.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Then lets head north, shall we?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis nods. No SCP-8250-2 instances are spotted on the way there. As they approach the center of SCP-8250-1, they start to slow down. Sensors detect a spike in A-Radiation.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Yep, I feel that.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Get down!\n\n\nThe two crouch down. Roughly 50 meters away, a group of SCP-8250-2 instances can be seen. Oddly they appear to be doing nothing except standing in a circle around something. SCP-8250-3 presumed to be nearby.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Can you see what they're doing?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n I'm not sure I want to.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n I'm getting a better look.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n No!\n\n\nDespite Senior Researcher Meyers' warnings, Senior Researcher Davis starts to creep closer. Senior Researcher Meyers sighs and follows. They both stop 50 meters from the circle of SCP-8250-2 instances to reveal SCP-8250-3 and POI-8250 both in the center of the circle.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Is that\u2026?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Williams.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers looks at Senior Researcher Davis, who's gone pale. He then pulls out a pistol.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n No. Davis, no. Davis!\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis rushes out of hiding towards the circle, screaming. The SCP-8250-2 instances fail to react.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Williams!\n\n\nPOI-8250 looks towards Senior Researcher Davis with a sorrowful look.\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n Hello Davis. Are you here to kill me?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n After what you did, yes!\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis' hands start shaking. Back behind cover, Senior Researcher Meyers curses.\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n Yes, Collins. You must understand -\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n That you killed him in cold blood? Yes, I understand.\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n No. That he \nhad to die\n. God demands sacrifice. Evolution demands sacrifice.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis scoffs.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n God? What god?\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n The Great Orb. The one true God.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n The one true\u2026\n\n\nFrom out of the trees, SCP-8250-4 emerges. Akiva and A-Radiation levels spike. All Everyone in the area except Senior Researcher Davis kneel as best they can. Suddenly, Senior Researcher Meyers is yanked out of his hiding spot into the air, presumed to be by SCP-8250-4. Senior Researcher Davis quickly follows suit.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n Sonuva -\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n Meyers. I was wondering where you were. Hiding, were we?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers spits at POI-8250. POI-8250 doesn't react.\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n No matter. God loves you anyway. He shall help you evolve, just as he helped all these beings.\n\n\nSenior Researcher Davis:\n Evolve? Help us? You're a crazy bastard, you know that?\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n No no no. I only want what's best for humanity. I want us to be better, to evolve. Is that so bad?\n\n\nSenior Researcher Meyers:\n The way you want it? Yes.\n\n\nPOI-8250 looks at the two sadly.\n\n\nPOI-8250:\n So be it.\n\n\nTendrils extend from SCP-8250 and pierce straight through Senior Researcher Meyers and Davis and their bodycams shut off. They are presumed compromised. There has been no further contact with Observation Post-12.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Shortly after the events described here, several more SCP-8250 instances began to show over the country. A new religion calling themselves the Church of Evolutionism, designated GOI-8250 also showed up roughly at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 8250.13: Excerpt from POI-8250 Opening Speech\n\n\nThe following details POI-8250 opening speech as the Church of Evolutionism was established. It is unknown how he remains as he is, unmutated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Goal at the Church of Evolutionism\n\n\n\n\nEvolution. It brought us to where we are today. It brought us money, electricity. It brought us cities and towns, running water, and clean clothes. It brought us everything we have today. But humanity did not evolve in the light. It evolved in the dark, before lights, before fire.\n\n\nNow, we at the Church of Evolutionism do not believe we need to stop evolving simply because we have everything we have. No, we believe the most noble goal to strive for is to evolve. And to do that, we need to accept the dark. We need to accept the Great Orb, the trigger of all evolution, and the final destination of it.\n\n\nAccept the Great Orb my friend. Accept it, and you can have everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]\n\n[IMAGE REUPLOADING]\n\n[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]\n\n[IMAGE REUPLOADING]\n\n[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]\n\n[IMAGE REUPLOADING]\n\n[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]\n\n[IMAGE REUPLOADING]\n\n\u2026\n\n[IMAGE UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe evolved in the dark, and in the dark we shall evolve more.
