Typical amenities are to be provided, including cleaning services and provision of food per a designated dietary regimen. To aid with communication, SCP-7333 must at all times have access to a mobile device possessing a physical keyboard.\n1\n Spare devices and chargers are to be stored in the room as necessary.\n\n\nA team of dedicated Foundation stock traders is to be assigned to SCP-7333\u2019s containment cell, and kept on rotation watch to observe when it enters periods of lucidity. The team is to be provided with a probationary budget, to be used for investments based on SCP-7333\u2019s insights. All transactions are to be thoroughly documented, and reviewed on a weekly basis. The budget is subject to change based on monthly outcomes.\n\n\nAccess to SCP-7333 for interview purposes may be requested by any research personnel Level-2 or higher possessing requisite credentials in biological sciences. Any individuals seeking to submit such a request are to note that the stock trader team schedule is to be given priority for access to SCP-7333.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-7333 appears to be a male Western fence lizard (\nSceloporus occidentalis\n), possessing sapience in limited and irregular periods of lucidity. SCP-7333 is capable of communication in written American English through the use of various typing devices, but will only respond to conversation when verbally addressed by name.\n2\n While SCP-7333 does not appear to age, it sheds its skin more frequently than non-anomalous lizards typical of the same apparent species. Shed skin from SCP-7333 carries no immediately discernable anomalous properties.\n\n\nBased on information gathered from interviews, SCP-7333 purportedly fashions itself as \u201ca deity for a modern time\u201d (see Partial Interview Logs). It is noted that despite its claims, SCP-7333 has yet to exhibit any indication of greater capabilities beyond its communicative and predictive anomalies.\n\n\nWhen provided with appropriate resources, SCP-7333 has demonstrated the ability to provide profitable investments recommendations, particularly with regards to the trading of stocks. As of the SCP-7333 team\u2019s most recent portfolio review, it is believed that the frequency of SCP-7333\u2019s periods of lucidity inversely correlates with the total profit amassed by the beneficiary of SCP-7333\u2019s advice. Due to this, discussion is underway to determine an altered containment schedule to allow SCP-7333 ample recovery time in between consultations.\n\n\nSCP-7333 was initially discovered following investigation of animal control complaints from a series of houses within a suburban neighborhood. All such reports alleged that \u201clizards were breaking into houses to watch TV\u201d, with a disproportionately large focus on households that frequently consumed news-related media. A team of Foundation containment specialists was dispatched to multiple houses under the guise of carrying out an electricians\u2019 survey; the team first encountered SCP-7333 in a nursery bedroom typing \u201cHELLO\u201d repeatedly on a children\u2019s \u201cSpeak & Spell\u201d electronic hand-held toy, followed by \u201cI AM BUSINESS LIZARD\u201d. Following application of amnestics to the neighborhood occupants, the team secured SCP-7333 and transported it to the nearest Foundation facility.\n\n\nAddendum-7333-1:\n Partial Interview Logs: over the course of SCP-7333\u2019s containment history, it was observed that its lucid periods initially occurred for approximately four hours every four days. As of the most recent update to the SCP-7333 file, the entity averages four hours of lucidity every sixteen days. Interview logs of note corresponding to sessions purely for personal information gathering purposes are transcribed below. (Note, SCP-7333\u2019s mobile device keyboard typing is displayed without corrections for grammar or mechanics. All questions were voiced aloud by interviewers situated in the containment cell.)\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from Interview-7333-3:\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. R.
