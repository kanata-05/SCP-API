Three days prior to the object's transportation event, it is to be moved to a cold storage chamber alongside a cadaver of the specifications shown further into this document. After the object's transportation event, its contents are to be recovered, logged and stored appropriately.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1873 is a metal tin, of the design adopted by Crayola for its Dustless Crayons in 1905. During its initial manifestation, SCP-1873 exhibits slight damage suggestive of natural wear and tear.\n\n\nSCP-1873 undergoes a repeated cycle. At midnight (local time) on the 21st of each month, SCP-1873 undergoes a transportation event and instantaneously transports itself into physical contact with the nearest human cadaver which conforms to the following specifications:\n\n\n\n\nThe cadaver expired as the direct result of the violent actions of another human.\n\n\nThe cadaver expired within the last seven (7) days.\n\n\n\n\nIn the majority (>97%) of documented cases, SCP-1873 is transported in such a manner as to appear balanced atop the cadaver or placed within the cadaver's grasp. However, in rare (<3%) situations, the object may appear within the cadaver in question, displacing matter from within the cadaver. Any objects contained within SCP-1873 during the transportation event disappear, and are currently presumed unrecoverable. Upon the completion of the transportation event, SCP-1873 is found to contain one or more objects, alongside a handwritten note. Notes are usually written in American English with black or blue ballpoint pen on torn pieces of lined paper, although other forms are not uncommon.\n\n\nPartial log of SCP-1873 contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nContents\n\n\nAccompanying note\n\n\nCadaver used\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/03/199\u2588\n\n\nMummified left and right front paws of a star-nosed mole (\nCondylura Cristata\n)\n\n\nBury your troubles.\n\n\nD-3100-12, male, aged 43 at death.
