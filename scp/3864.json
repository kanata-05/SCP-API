Outside of scheduled tests, SCP-3864 is to be covered with a thick black cloth at all times. Should SCP-3864 grow too large to be completely covered by this cloth, D-Class personnel are to be dispatched immediately with an appropriately sized replacement.\n\n\nSCP-3864's containment chamber is to be kept well-lit and monitored via an infrared camera to ensure that it remains completely covered at all times. A decibel meter is to be placed no less than 15\u00a0cm from SCP-3864\u2019s surface. Any changes should be reported to the researcher in charge, which is currently Dr. Taylor Itkin at the time of this writing.\n\n\nEntry into SCP-3864's containment chamber requires Level-3 clearance. All personnel are required to wear infrared goggles while in SCP-3864\u2019s containment chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3864 is an \noil painting of an individual\n. The subject, coloration, and size are all subject to change. The only constants in the appearance of SCP-3864 are that the individual in the portrait is always a human, and testing shows the paint to always be oil based. At no point has more than one subject been witnessed inside of SCP-3864.\n\n\nSCP-3864 gives off a heat signature of 37\u00b0 Celsius, similar to that of the average human body temperature. This heat signature is not centered on a certain portion of the painting (such as the individual inside), but rather is given off by the painting in its entirety. SCP-3864 is safe to view through infrared goggles or filters.\n\n\nWhen a subject (henceforth referred to as SCP-3864-1) views SCP-3864 directly, within 15 minutes SCP-3864-1 will begin to gradually lose all pigmentation and most body heat. At this time, the likeness of SCP-3864-1 will begin to appear in SCP-3864. SCP-3864-1 will not be bothered by these processes. Within 30 minutes, SCP-3864-1 will become completely void of all pigmentation and have an average body temperature of 10\u00b0 Celsius, as well as SCP-3864 showing a full likeness of SCP-3864-1. SCP-3864-1 will then die of severe dehydration and hypothermia. There is no recorded method of halting or slowing these processes.\n\n\nAlthough the body of SCP-3864-1 will become inanimate and resemble a corpse, the consciousness of SCP-3864-1 is thought to be transferred into SCP-3864. This is evidenced by the likeness of SCP-3864-1 inside of SCP-3864 to be able to change poses and \u201cmove\u201d \u2013 though no record shows the likeness of SCP-3864-1 to be moving while being observed \u2013 in ways that sometimes appear to be attempts at communication or escape from SCP-3864.\n\n\nLikenesses of SCP-3864-1 inside of SCP-3864 also appear to be capable of verbal communication. It is unclear whether this is SCP-3864-1 communicating or simply an imitation by SCP-3864.\n\nAttempts at communication are currently underway.\n\n\nAddendum:\n SCP-3864 was recovered on 5/18 by \nMTF Eta-10\n from [REDACTED], Virginia. The Foundation became aware of SCP-3864\u2019s existence when Foundation staff planted in local police units were notified of multiple missing persons reports supposedly linked to viewing a painting. Upon securing SCP-3864, members of MTF Eta-10 were able to confirm with neighboring residents that SCP-3864-1 was in fact the man who owned the house SCP-3864 was recovered from. All those who confirmed this later appeared in SCP-3864, having viewed it directly. A Class-C amnestic was administered to all neighboring residents to cover the disappearances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Interview\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nInterview A \u2013 5/21/17\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n D-3976\n\n\nSubject B:\n SCP-3864-1 (formerly D-3977)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Taylor Itkin\n\n\nForeword:\n Subject B has only recently appeared in SCP-3864. Subject A and Subject B are former cellmates. Subject A has been instructed to attempt contact with Subject B. A high-gain microphone has been placed in front of SCP-3864.

Ask it that.\n\n\nSubject A:\n You seem rather calm about it, you know.\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n Lenny, in all honesty, if I had to choose between possible Keter testing and being stuck inside a damn painting? I\u2019m fine where I am. It\u2019s not that bad in here. I do kind of miss burgers, though.\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n Burgers?\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n I would \nkill\n for a bacon cheeseburger right now.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Ask it if it needs to eat to survive.\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n Um, why? Are you hungry?\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n Not really. I just love fucking cheeseburgers, man. You know that.\n\n\nSubject A:\n Yeah, especially after you almost got killed after you mouthed off to that guard who wanted yours.\n\n\nSubject B:\n \nNo\none messes with my fucking burger, Len. \nNo\none.\n\n\nSubject A:\n I wouldn\u2019t get between you and your burger if someone were pointing a gun to my head and telling me to.\n\n\nSubject B:\n See, you know how to keep yourself safe then.\n\n\nSubject A and Subject B share a laugh\n\n\nSubject B:\n Oh, man, do you remember that time Dug tried to bribe a guard to get out of Keter duty?\n\n\nSubject A:\n Yeah! Oh, man, he was so close, too. Too bad the guy\u2019s supervisor came along.\n\n\nSubject B:\n Yeah, has that guy been back?\n\n\nSubject A:\n Who, the guard? No, my guess is that he got fired or terminated or some shit.\n\n\nSubject B:\n Bah, I feel no pity for him. Bastards are always shoving their guns in our faces, why should I give a fuck about him?\n\n\nSubject A:\n My sentiments exactly.\n\n\nSubject B:\n \u2026If only Kelly hadn\u2019t actually gotten away with bribing \nhis\n way out\u2026\n\n\nSubject A:\n Hey, something great came out of that, didn\u2019t it? We-\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Alright, ask it if it\u2019s comfortable where it is.\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n \u2026Listen, Terry\u2026 you\u2019re not, like, you\u2019re not in pain or anything, right? You\u2019re okay?\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n I mean, I\u2019m comfortable enough. I\u2019m just\u2026 lonely, I guess. No one\u2019s here with me and most of the time that fucking cloth is covering my face.\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n I\u2019m sorry, man\u2026 I miss you, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n I miss you too!\n\n\nSubject A:\n I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck in there, Terry.\n\n\nSubject B:\n It\u2019s not your fault, Len. My goggles malfunctioned.

Now.\n\n\n\n\nSubject A:\n Terry\u2026 I- I miss you, man, but I can\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\nSubject B:\n Why not? I\u2019m so alone, Len\u2026\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Get him out of there.

You\u2019re back!\n\n\nSubject A:\n You can see me?\n\n\nSubject B:\n I may be in a painting, but whoever painted me was kind enough to give me eyes.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Is SCP-3864-1 insinuating that another entity actually paints SCP-3864?\n\n\nSubject A:\n Someone painted you?\n\n\nSubject B:\n What?\n\n\nSubject A:\n You said whoever painted you gave you eyes.\n\n\nSubject B:\n It was a joke, idiot.\n\n\nSubject A:\n Oh.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Ask it if time is passing. We want to know how time passes in the painting\u2019s world.\n\n\nSubject A:\n Uh, so, Terry, what have you been doing the last couple of days? Eating cheeseburgers?\n\n\nSubject B:\n Oh, yeah, because I have access to- wait, the last couple of \ndays?\n How fucking long have I been in here?\n\n\nSubject A:\n About a week, man.\n\n\nSubject B:\n A \nweek?\n Jesus\u2026\n\n\nSubject A:\n How could you not know?\n\n\nSubject B:\n I don\u2019t know! I mean\u2026 the sun never goes down. At least not that I can \nsee\n. I mean, there\u2019s only 2 windows.\n\n\nSubject A:\n Can\u2019t you go outside?\n\n\nSubject B:\n There\u2019s no door. It\u2019s like- I can see outside, I can see that there\u2019s this whole world, but\u2026 this room is all I\u2019m able to be in.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Has it not attempted escaping the room?\n\n\nSubject A:\n Have you tried breaking the window or something? Getting out?\n\n\nSubject B:\n Either I\u2019m really weak or everything is sort of, like, bolted down or something. I can\u2019t lift \nany\n of the furniture. And I tried ramming the walls and stuff with my body but\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s not even the weirdest part, Len.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Get it to elaborate.\n\n\nSubject A:\n What is, then?\n\n\nSubject B:\n I know they\u2019ve said I\u2019m in a painting, but everything here looks real. Until I look out the window. Outside is\u2026\n\n\nSubject A:\n Outside is what?\n\n\nSubject B:\n Well, it\u2019s paint. It looks like it\u2019s painted on a backdrop.\n\n\nSeveral moments of silence\n\n\nSubject B:\n Do you remember that night?\n\n\nSubject A:\n Which night? There are a lot of them.\n\n\nSubject B:\n The one a couple months ago.

Dr. [REDACTED] remains the current SCP-3864-1 instance at this time. Conclusion: SCP-3864 is able to loosely control or influence SCP-3864-1 to \u201clure\u201d prey. Further testing pending O5 approval.",
